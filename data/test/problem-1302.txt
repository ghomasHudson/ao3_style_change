“I have to sneak back up to the table,” Andromeda said as she turned to engulf Draco in a similar hug. “I thought you might like to mind Teddy for the meal, though.”
“Don’t act like you don’t have blood on your hands because you wouldn’t use some unforgivables, you bastard. You have the blood on your hands of every person who was hurt after you left and didn’t take anyone with you, of everyone who was hurt from the first
Pansy had finally made the decision for them all, declaring they would walk Harry to the Great Hall so he could eat with his friends while they waited in the eighth year common room for the end of breakfast. And this was how he had ended up curled up on the sofa before the fire, feet in Blaise’s lap and head in Pansy’s, feeling as though he was going to be sick.
“You’re not alright, Mr Potter, no,” Madame Pomfrey said from beside Professor McGonagall. “I’ve never seen such a large magical core depletion in all my time as a healer. It’s a wonder we didn’t have to send you to Saint Mungo’s – not to mention I’m shocked that you’re already awake.”
“Would you believe he didn’t say a word to me the entire time? Frankly I’m not quite sure he’s smart enough to speak,” Draco smiled at Harry, but it didn’t reach his eyes.
The rest of the week passed in a blur of much too much homework for a school year that had yet to even start. Harry met with McGonagall four times, directly after breakfast. He had chosen her to shadow to do his best to learn what running a school was like. So far, it was simply a mess of boring paperwork. He had met with Binns four times, too. The ghost had about as much personality as his teaching skills implied, but Harry was determined to do something about History of Magic at Hogwarts. After all, perhaps if they focused on the
For Draco, McGonagall had pulled some strings, it seemed, and under the guise of being supervised for “disciplinary measures” required by the ministry, she had put him in a Potions placement with the new Potions professor, who Harry hadn’t met yet and Draco was being stubbornly tight-lipped about, which he was enjoying immensely.
Harry looked down at his timetable as she walked away. It was, quite frankly, the most packed timetable he had ever seen. He glanced over at Draco’s – it was emptier. He had some time slots free. Pansy’s seemed more similar to Harry’s, packed full from breakfast to dinner, and sometimes after, too.
“They made my life miserable,” she said. “Malfoy called me slurs, Pansy reminded me I was ugly every chance she got.” In a fluid motion, she pulled up her left sleeve, revealing the word that Bellatrix Lestrange had carved into her skin less than a year ago. Mudblood. “They hurt people. They killed innocent people. And then we come back from Australia and you’re friends with them? No warning? No hi, Hermione, how was your traumatic experience putting your parent’s memories back into their heads? Just ‘Hi, Hermione, come meet my new boyfriend, Draco bloody Malloy.’”
“The holidays will be soon,” Andy said gently. “I’ll come through with you. If Minerva is there we can talk to her together. I daresay it may save you some trouble given that you left school grounds without permission.”
And maybe, ther was a chance they could chage that, starting now. They were all children in a war, after all. Andromeda had said that to him often.
Harry bit his collar bone, none too gently. “Nothing, particularly, except for all the Gryffindor’s getting pissed off some shit rum and this being the closest place to be sick from it.”
“Idiot,” Harry responded as he wrapped his fingers through Draco’s hair, pulling the other man’s head back and tasting the salty sweet of his skin. When Harry lifted his head, Draco was watching him. He watched right back, unabashedly taking in Draco’s flushed lips, the bruises forming on his neck.
Draco maneuvered him away from the wall for a moment so Harry could shake off his robes and shirt. Draco’s hands and lips trailed across Harry’s body as he pulled his clothes off, until he was a whimpering mess. He reached for his own tie but found Draco’s hands on his before he could even begin to undo it.
dilute magic blood. But that isn’t a reason to commit murder. With or without magic, we are all still humans and we can all adapt. I wish this was something I had understood all along. Magic was essential to me as breathing, until it wasn’t. Sometimes the sight of magic makes me sick after all the things I did and I am glad I can no longer use my wand for much.
“You are a bit of a prat,” Hermione said, looking at him from the side of her eye. With that, Harry knew he was forgiven. But he wasn’t done speaking.
“More for us to keep in line of course,” Pansy grumbled. Harry shook his head slightly at her – despite her words, she seemed gratified that they had so many students. He was…possibly a little bit excited at the prospect as well. After all, the first step to opening a proper school would be learning how to interact with children.
“I’ll meet you at the Slytherin table,” Harry said quietly, shrugging with the baby in his hands. Pansy just nodded curtly and walked away, leaving Draco standing helplessly between them. Harry rolled his eyes. “C’mon,” he said to Draco.
“They can be quite meddlesome,” she said, with a tilt of her head. “Now, what would you like to know?”
“And what if we cause in-fighting, or accidentally dismantle the whole government in the process?” Minerva asked levelly.
“Nope!” Mar said, emphasizing the word with a popping noise on the P. Ron wrinkled his nose, Harry saw out of the corner of his eye, which made him bristle with protectiveness.
“Not over the summer?” Draco asked – and in that moment he looked so vulnerable that Harry just wanted to hold him, although he guessed that that approach wouldn’t be particularly well-received.
“This is exhausting,” Pansy groaned from beside Harry. Their first week of classes at Hogwarts was complete, but instead of the weekend being the respite from work they all needed already, Harry was burying himself in lesson plans while Pansy was wading her way through a thick and unfriendly looking Dark Arts book.
When he had the tie in his hands, Draco reached up to take it from him. “Tell me if this isn’t okay,” he said, before guiding Harry’s arms behind his back and wrapping the tie around them. He didn’t tie it or bind him, really, in any way, but Harry felt his cock twitch in anticipation anyways. Draco smirked up at him.
Pansy had been expressly forbidden from telling anyone about who the new Defence professor was, but she absolutely gushed about her at every possible opportunity. Blaise was not enjoying Arithmancy with Professor Vector, and he made sure everyone knew it. Mostly, he had been stuck tutoring Harry, so Harry, at least, didn’t really blame him.
“I have a plan for how we should talk to the Slytherins tonight,” she said. She pursed her lips and reached around to whack Draco on the back. Harry couldn’t see what he had been doing, since he was currently leaning against the other boy, but presumably what he wasn’t doing was paying attention to Pansy.
“Harry!” It was Mar, of course, entirely unable to understand the tension of the situation she was approaching, as usual. “Guess what?”
“Its good to see you taking your House Guardian duties so seriously,” she said with a bemused sort of smile at the four of them.
The knocking came for a second time before Harry finally made it to the door. It opened to reveal the faces of Ron and Hermione, as Blaise had predicted.
“You and I have to plan for welcoming the Slytherins this evening,” Pansy said, then. “I was thinking we could after lunch. Draco and Blaise can help us.”
Bumping the door open with his hip, Harry stepped into the cottage. Andromeda was bustling around the kitchen, preparing dinner, most likely.
“We can,” said Pansy. Together, the three of them led the first years out of the Great Hall and towards the dungeons. It felt good and right and – it felt to Harry like he was truly, completely at home.
as he did so. He turned to see Draco standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room. “Yours is across the hall,” Harry said, by way of explanation. “Andy said we could keep it for you, for Christmas and the like, if you want to come here instead of stay at Hogwarts.”
Harry couldn’t actually tell what time it was, but they had found, once they had made it to their room the night before, that it had enchanted windows. They seemed to be similar to the ceiling of the Great Hall, showing with at least some accuracy the weather and time of day outside. Judging by the windows, the sun was just now peaking above the horizon.
“I cannot meet my aunt for the first time looking as if you just ravished me in her garden,” Draco said with a sigh, drawing his hands away from Harry’s waist.
He dropped into his bed in the eighth year dorms after his last class of the day, Arithmancy, and groaned. It wasn’t long before Draco, Pansy, and Blaise trooped in from Ancient Runes. Draco dropped onto the bed beside him.
He wasn’t sure why. It wasn’t the same as his nightmares when Voldemort was in his mind, either, although these nightmares felt just as real. And yet, if anything, the terror upon waking was worse than when he had woken fearing for Sirius, or Mr Weasley.
By the time class was due to start and all the students were settled, Professor Binns was still nowhere in sight. Feeling nervous, but deciding he may as well give it a shot, he cleared his throat to start class.
“Alright,” Harry said, bringing his hand up to caress Draco’s arm. He flung the covers back and stood up, intent on finding his shirt and some pants before he fell asleep.
I am SO sorry that i basically fell of the face of the earth. Life got accidentally too overwhelming and I had to hide for a minute there. I v much hope you all enjoy this chapter, I have reading week coming up so I'll be able to catch up on my writing and hopefully have a backlog for writing for this story now so it's easier to post more often. thank you thank you for sticking with me, this story is so much fun to write and i am in love with every single one of the characters and every single one of my readers who loves them just as much as i do <3
Blaise made a noise of protest while Draco, who was halfway to his feet, glared at her. “Look,” Pansy sighed, “Draco can’t get involved – sorry love,” she added direclty to Draco. “It will look bad. And dinner is soon, he can’t go down there alone, and Potter can’t go up to the Headmisstress’s office by himself. It’s asking for trouble. So Potter and I will go bond over arguing with McGonagall, and you two can do whatever you’d like, and we’ll meet you in the Great Hall.”
Soon they were in the corridor outside the potions room again. The air was cooler, here, and Harry felt himself breathing more easily, although he hadn’t recognized how stifling the potions room had been until he exited. Draco followed him out, flanked by Blaise and Pansy.
“You would be a sane person, Mr Potter,” McGonagall said, exactly as if he were a misbehaving teenager again. But she looked proud, which was something.
“I never realized magic was so technical,” was all Harry could think to say. “I didn’t think you could lose it.”
“Well, Mr Potter,” she said, seating herself in a conjured chair beside his bed as if he hadn’t said anything, “I had hoped the Hospital Wing would be seeing less of you, this year.”
Draco snorted, and soon the four of them were all laughing, much to the horror of those seated around them. They probably looked mad, Harry thought, snickering on like idiots after such a dark warning.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m not mad. Honestly!” He added at her disbelieving look. “I did think…maybe it wasn’t as fun as you were letting on. But Andy told me I had to let you heal in your own way. I guess she was right.”
You know the rest, anyhow. I hadn’t expected to be spoken for at my trial. I had expected Azkaban. I cannot say with any certainty that at the point of my trial I believed that muggles weren’t inferior. I do not know when I stopped thinking that, but I am fairly certain that I was still set in my ways.
The students began to whisper as he approached them, with all the subtlety that eleven-year-olds possessed. He heard his name whispered and had to fight back a wince. They were children, he couldn’t blame them for the hero worship that he so desperately hated. Even if he
It made me realize, though, that for some people it was not about blood status or birth. It was simply about causing harm. How could I be part of that kind of a cause? It was the start, you could say, the start of the end. I feel as though I must reiterate, though, that I don’t believe this excuses me. I was guilty. I am guilty. I deserve consequences,
Pansy had been expressly forbidden from telling anyone about who the new Defence professor was, but she absolutely gushed about him at every possible opportunity. Blaise was not enjoying Arithmancy with Professor Vector, and he made sure everyone knew it. Mostly, he had been stuck tutoring Harry, so Harry, at least, didn’t really blame him.
Draco hummed in understanding against him. Then his weight shifted off of Harry, who was left gasping, aching at the loss for a moment. Until, that is, he felt Draco’s fingers at his belt buckle, making quick work of his fly, pulling his jeans and pants off of him in one movement.
His breathing was coming faster, now. He hadn’t stared down the other end of a wand since Voldemort; he hadn’t thought his first day back at Hogwarts would find him doing the same thing. He couldn’t think of any spells to cast, couldn’t move all of a sudden. It was like everything in him was frozen and screaming, like the night Dumbledore had petrified him on the Astronomy Tower. Bile rose in his throat and he swallowed it down.
“You need to learn to trust it again,” Andromeda said, gently. “Do you remember the first spell you ever did?”
Please don't hate me because this took so long to update!! But here's another BAMF Pansy chapter, and mostly from Draco's POV to boot!
Harry wasn’t quite sure what to say to that, except a few choice words that he was sure the Healer would not welcome. However, before he could form a response, Madame Pomfrey spoke up.
They had taken a rare moment, just the two of them, in Draco’s room together. Pansy was meeting with the mysterious defence professor before dinner, and Blaise was waiting for her. Harry was currently sprawled out on the bed, staring at the ceiling, while Draco worked on an essay for Slughorn at his desk. His room was small, his desk close enough to the foot of his bed that Harry could reach out with a foot and touch him. The other side of his bed housed a wardrobe, and across from the bed was a door to the room – a painting of a dog on the other side that swung outwards when you pet its head in the correct pattern.
Not that he minded, really. He struggled with the isolation. It wasn’t so bad now that the castle was full of people, although without Blaise, Pansy, and Potter it would have undoubtedly have been worse – but the summer had been horrible. Even with Potter visiting, the letters and floo calls exchanged with his friends, it had been horribly lonely.
Confused, at least a little, Harry raised an eyebrow. “I already said it’s part of his parole. The Headmistress is confident in him, the plans were put together long before we came back to Hogwarts. I don’t see how I have anything to do with it.”
“Oi,” Harry said, although it was mostly false indignance. He was fairly certain he’d be rather useless, at least at first. Even if the Sorting Hat had almost put him in Slytherin, that didn’t mean he knew how to
Harry shrugged. “I thought that’s what I wanted,” he said. And it was, too. In the Days Before, that had been his goal. But now he had lived through a war, and more fighting was the last thing that he had wanted.
This morning they had entirely missed their early breakfast with Pansy and Blaise. Draco had been adamant about skipping breakfast altogether – Potter had been adamant about attending. Draco understood, of course, it was his friends first morning back at Hogwarts – but he didn’t want to have to sit through the whispers and stares that followed him everywhere he went. Didn’t want to have to look Weasley and Granger in the eyes for the first time in front of everyone.
She didn’t, thankfully. “It appears as though your magic, unstable as it has become, reacted to your emotions during your argument. It exploded, in a manner of speaking.”
“I had to listen to her prattle on about it all the way here,” Blaise groaned, “And she wouldn’t even tell me what it was.”
“Stop working, then,” Harry responded, throwing a pillow at him. He was being a little bit obstinate. He had work to get done, too, but he was too nervous about the next day, Ron and Hermione arriving to do anything about it.
Harry couldn’t help it, he let out a small groan. In the bustle of getting up to start heading to the dungeons, no one seemed to hear him except Draco, who just cast him a slightly exasperated look. Maybe he was being..dramatic, but it was for good reason. He could already think of a host of reasons why he
Harry snorted at that mental image. “Thanks,” he said after a moment of silence. Zabini took his cue, standing up and making his way over to his own bed.
onto your arm, Hermione. You are the brightest witch of our age, you deserve everything you have earned because you have earned it on sheer talent and wit.
But Harry didn’t get to hear what it sounded like, because at that moment a knock on the door sounded, followed by hushed voices from the other side. Everyone looked at each other for a moment before three sets of eyes landed on Harry.
“It’s alright,” she said, standing from her place on the chair. “Give him here, I’ll let you two catch up.” She took Teddy from Harry, giving him a long hug when she bent down. She gave Draco a quick kiss on the forehead, to which he blushed. “I’ll see you boys in the morning.”
“Harry?” he looked up, startled, realizing he had been lost in thought for a few minutes and merely pushing his food around on his plate. Andromeda looked concerned, and Draco looked as though he was avoiding eye contact. “You’ll be alright, you know,” she said softly to him.
as he did so. He turned to see Draco standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room. “Yours is across the hall,” Harry said, by way of explanation. “Andy said we could keep it for you, for Christmas and the like, if you want to come here instead of stay at Hogwarts.”
Blaise put a hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezed. “I know we’re here, on your bed, in the eighth year dorm at Hogwarts. I know Pansy isn’t far away, probably arguing with Granger instead of sleeping.” He gave Harry a strained smile. “I know Draco is in his little room, probably fast asleep like the peaceful twat he is.” This wasn’t true, they both knew, but was comforting somehow. “I know Slughorn is in the dungeons, definitely in some sort of
She turned kind eyes on him. “It’ll be alright, Harry. Teddy and I will visit.” She squeezed his shoulder as he moved through the kitchen towards his bedroom.
She stormed across the room, but shut the door behind her with a soft click. Harry made a mental note to avoid ever making Pansy Parkinson angry at him. After a deep breath, he got out of bed and grabbed some clothes for the day.
“How do you mean?” Harry stepped away to pick Teddy up as he began to fuss. As usual, the familiar weight of Teddy on his hip was a comfort - a small piece of stability in a shifting world.
He was gratified to hear Zabini snort in response, although the other man didn’t look at him or acknowledge him in any other way. Harry didn’t exactly know why he was trying to make friends with them, even Draco had given him a bemused, although not ungrateful, look.
“Of course,” Harry said warmly to Andromeda instead. She handed him over and with a small squeeze of Harry’s shoulder she was off to the High Table. The timing was good – just as she left, the sorting hat was sat upon its stool by Professor McGonagall. Harry shifted Teddy in his arms so he could lean against Draco as the hat began its song.
He stood close to Draco, their shoulders brushing, as their classmates stepped through the floo. Pansy Parkinson was on Draco’s other side, looking studiosly grim and aggressively avoiding eye contact with Hary. Dean and Seamus and Neville had come through, had said their hellos to Harry, but were now standing on the opposite side of the room chatting with Ernie MacMillan and Justing Finch-Fletchy.
“I don’t disagree with you,” she said after a moment. “I’ve seen it in my lifetime. I am afraid, sometimes, that war is inevitable, thought I know it is not.” She looked up at him then. It was a careful look, adult-to-adult, rather than teacher-to-student. “I do not know that we can do anything about it. We are just two people.”
“The Carrows didn’t care,” Draco said quietly. “They didn’t care about blood status, they were crazy. Do you know who stood up to them, when your lot left? Pansy did.” Weasley had gone pale, and Granger had slouched back in her chair. “Hate me all you want,” Draco continued, ignoring Blaise’s sharp look in his direction. “I’m the Death Eater, and I will own that.”
It took Harry a moment before he realized what thought had crossed his mind, and he mentally kicked himself. As if the Slytherin’s hadn’t suffered, or lost anyone to the war. As if they all hated muggles. Of course they would observe a moment of silence.
He didn’t know, though, if he would be coping so well if he were rooming with them as normal. Blaise woke him up during nightmares; Harry did the same for Blaise. They had cleaned up after each other when they’d been sick, spent late nights talking about the past and the future. On one memorable occasiona already, they had snuck Pansy and Draco in and sat up all night with hot cocoa delivered by the house elves when it was all too much.
Draco’s hands strayed, tracing down Harry’s sides, around the curve of his arse, back up to his hair. He stood still, hands on Draco’s waist, letting the other boy explore him, make sure he was intact. “I’m alright, love,” Harry said gently. His words struck Draco out of whatever stupor he seemed to be in because Draco’s hands were fisting in his shirt and pulling him close and his head was resting on Harry’s shoulder and Harry was clinging back to him as if he were the only steady thing in the world – which, really, he was sometimes.
They weren’t as early as they had thought. When they arrived in the Great Hall – which housed just a small table that the professors and students sat around together, most of their year was already there. Neville tried to smile at Harry as they walked in, but Harry tactfully ignored him and followed Blaise to seats at the opposite end to everyone else.
“I have my moments,” Harry responded in an imitation of Blaise’s arrogant tones. “They’ll probably just yell a lot,” he said, more normally this time.
Blaise burst out laughing, likely at the horrified look on Pansy’s face. Even Harry found a small smile from within himself.
McGonagall rubbed her temples and gave a glance heavenward before continuing. “Very well, Ms Parkinson. We have decided that this rule will be broken for the Slytherin house alone.”
“I’ve been known to have them,” Draco drawled. If Harry’s eyes were open, he would have rolled them, but he was already drifting off into sleep.
As he looked around the Slytherin table, mostly vacant as students piled around Pansy and Draco, Harry noticed a group of what was definitely first years all sitting closely together, about ten of them, it seemed. With a nervous glance at Pansy, who was still engrossed with the students surrounding her, he made his way over.
Harry woke slowly, dimly aware of hushed voices speaking somewhere in his periphery. There was something soft underneath him – a bed? He winced as his eyes opened, becoming aware of a pounding headache and his sore body. Slowly, his argument with Ron and Hermione, his conversations with Mar, came back to him. He let out a frustrated huff of breath. Whoever was nearby must have heard him because the hushed voices stopped.
I AM SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG i have been working like 70 hour weeks and really not loving it, had absolutely no time to write until now. but finally another chapter full of wholesome pansy and draco content. apologies in advance for my sorting hat song i do Not poetry
“This involves you, too, you twat,” she said sharply. “I can’t do this with just Potter, he’s useless!”
“You’re awake?” came Andromeda’s voice again. She was beside him, then, glasses in hand. “How are you feeling?” she asked as he put his glasses on.
The fist in his chest, the spinning, the crushing, was receding, now. He felt as though he could breathe, but
“You’re awake?” came Andromeda’s voice again. She was beside him, then, glasses in hand. “How are you feeling?” she asked as he put his glasses on.
She waved away his question. When he protested, she added, “I can handle the washing up for one night, Harry. You can keep an eye on Teddy tonight in case he wakes. Merlin knows I could do with a full night of sleep before you’re gone and he’s all my problem.”
That made him smile at her, only slightly. “I think I’m done with any favours of the death sort, honestly,” he said.
“So…how was everyone’s summer?” Granger finally asked in such a false cheerful tone it made Draco cringe.
I maaay have stolen some visuals from the movie (as opposed to the books) for part of this chapter. Please don’t hate me, it was more dramatic. Some frank discussions of war and PTSD-like symptoms although the phrase is never used, just as a trigger warning!
Harry felt a smile blooming on his face. “Like it long, hm?” he asked, and began giggling in a quite un-Harry like way. There was no reason, really, except that he was happy to be out of the Hospital Wing and grateful to be here with Draco, quiet and close.
Her cackles were cut off abruptly as they saw the group of Gryffindor’s walking up from the entrance to the common room, which had somehow opened without them hearing. Potter looked like he was trying to hide a smile. Granger, on his left, was looking awkward, her lips turned into a frown. He was sure she was blushing, even if, like Potter, her skin was too dark for it to be visible. Weasley, however, was bright red, intently looking around the common room as if it was fascinating.
do that, Professor. They all have it out for us, it doesn’t make sense anymore but they do. They didn’t help a single Slytherin last year, not even a first year. Some of them
“As much as I would love to hear about your summer,” the Weasel – Weasley, Draco corrected himself – began, his voice full of hostility, “we should just establish that I don’t like any of you and I don’t trust any of you.” Draco felt Weasley’s eyes rest on him. “You’re a Death Eater,” he spat out. Draco looked up in shock, but Weasley had already turned to Pansy. “You tried to give Harry to Voldemort,” and then to Blaise, “And you’re just a self-righteous pure-blooded twat.”
I was wrong. I am sure there are still things I am wrong about, but I would like to continue learning. I am doing my best to have an open mind. This is what I had wanted to convey to you the first time we spoke. I was unable to, perhaps because some wounds are still too fresh, perhaps because your friends are not as willing as I to put down their arms and recognize their wrongs.
“I’m sure this is exactly what she had in mind when she said that,” Draco said in response. But he ducked his head down, as if supressing a laugh. “Don’t worry,” he continued, “I plan on doing all the work today.”
I was wrong. I am sure there are still things I am wrong about, but I would like to continue learning. I am doing my best to have an open mind.

Then, to my surprise, you lot appeared at the manor in the hands of Snatchers. I do not know what I was thinking when I refused to identify you. I don not know that I was thinking at all, except that if you were killed then all hope was lost and this madman would never leave my house. My life would never go back to normal. And I thought, perhaps, that they knew it was you anyway. That if I refused to identify you I would finally be killed. I wanted death so badly in those times – I couldn’t stoop so low, of course. Not really. If I had harmed myself, he would have killed my parents as punishment. There is no escape from being a Death Eater, you see. Not even in death. Not unless you die for the cause.
Harry swung Teddy up and into his arms. “Let’s go, Teds. If we spend much more time out here Andy will throw a fit.”
“How are you feeling?” Draco murmured in Harry’s ear. He didn’t have to specify, he knew what Draco meant. He could tell his nerves for the upcoming day were coming off him in waves. He was anxious – anxious about classes, trying to learn again as if everything were normal, helping Binns, tea with McGonagall that afternoon – just anxious.
going to remember that password,” he groaned. The Gryffindor boys at the front laughed, and then the tension was broken and they surged in.
Harry felt his skin prickle - anger, again. Frustration, maybe? Not emotions he felt often enough anymore. “Well clearly it meant something, Hermione,” he said, finally, “or you wouldn’t have said it.”
Hermione huffed out a breath and pushed her hair out of her face. “I didn’t want you to worry,” she said, finally, looking at him out of the side of her eye. “If it helps, Ron wanted me to be honest.”
The only eighth years who wouldn’t be there, as far as Harry knew, were Ron and Hermione. They had been given permission to arrive the 1
He and Andromeda had spoken at length about it over the summer before he had sent an owl to McGonagall with his requests for classes. After deliberation and much conversation with Andromeda, McGonagall, Ron, and Hermione, he had decided to take Charms, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Care of Magical Creatures, Herbology, Potions, and work outside of class with some professors to take his OWLs in Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Muggle Studies, which had shocked Ron.
He had turned to exercise instead. It was almost more helpful, and it kept him outside for hours every day. He’d filled out from the commination of food and his workout regime, was less the scrawny child he’d always been.
“I know we have a class that’s probably quite mixed in terms of skill,” said Professor Stone. “So we’ll start off with a practical review. Please turn to page 17 in your books. You’ll have this class to brew Dreamless Sleep potion as a review. It won’t be for an official mark, but your grade will allow you and I to see where your skill level is at.”
Draco kissed him gently; the side of his mouth, under his jaw, then sat back, running his fingers through Harry’s wayward hair. “Don’t be sorry,” Draco said. “It’s not your fault.”
Harry grinned somewhat ruefully at him. The other boy wasn’t wrong at all. In fact, he was quite right. It wasn’t something Harry would have suggested in the first place, had he known how it was going to end up from the start.
The next time he woke it was darker in his room. His head hurt less – his whole body hurt less, really. He shifted into a sitting position, looking around for his glasses once again.
“Ask you friends,” Draco spoke up, then. “Ask your pathetic friends what happened in the castle after they saved their own skin and abandoned everyone else – even first years, to the Carrows. Ask them who stepped in to help when they were gone.”
“There’s a team of people,” he responded, hoping that was all he needed to say, but she just raised an eyebrow at him to continue. Harry sighed. “Well there’s me, of course. Professor McGonagall, Professor Strickland, one squib who works in muggle liaison for the Ministry of Magic and one wizard who works in the muggle government’s wizard liaison office. And Draco.”
They took up their usual spaces, Blaise and Pansy immediately curling up on his bed while Draco and Harry perched on Harry’s bed, before realizing there were two more to their number today. Granger and Weasley looked around the room looking distinctly awkward before Granger grabbed the chair from Zabini’s desk. Following suit, Weasley took the chair from Harry’s desk, turning it around and sitting down beside his girlfriend.
They were silent as they walked, Harry mulling over Pansy’s words. She was right to be hurt, he knew, and brave to admit it. He couldn’t help but feel guilt, too. If he had been here… he doubted he would have spared thoughts for the Slytherins. Doubted he would have been any better than Neville when it came to saving the first years, those outside the DA. Would have seen graffiti and throwing insults at the Carrows as the ultimate rebellion.
Uncomfortable with the way she was looking at him, Harry slid out of his chair. Perhaps in the Days Before, Harry would have shouted or thrown a tantrum to avoid the emotions he was feeling now. But in the Days After, he just didn’t have the energy.
She sighed. “I didn’t particularly want to bring you, but Blaise seems to be of the belief that Draco would murder us if anything happens to you. So I suppose we have to make sure you’re not dumb enough to do anything stupid, now.”
“It was-” Harry wasn’t sure he could even articulate how he was feeling. The spinning feeling hadn’t left his chest, not really, although it had transformed into something that felt much more crushing. He was dimly aware that he was still gasping for breath, his vision was still grey on the edges. Zabini, strangely enough, was the only constant right now – an obvious juxtaposition from his dream of the dead and dying.
Draco’s laughter followed them out of his room and toward the eighth year common room. Harry privately thought he had never heard a better sound.
“You need to learn to trust it again,” Andromeda said, gently. “Do you remember the first spell you ever did?”
He didn’t know, though, if he would be coping so well if he were rooming with them as normal. Blaise woke him up during nightmares; Harry did the same for Blaise. They had cleaned up after each other when they’d been sick, spent late nights talking about the past and the future. On one memorable occasion already, they had snuck Pansy and Draco in and sat up all night with hot cocoa delivered by the house elves when it was all too much.
“Abuse of your power so that we can study?” Pansy asked as Harry made his way back to the table. “I didn’t think you had it in you.”
“What are you writing for your muggle studies assignment?” A sixth year girl asked. Harry was fairly confident her name was Amelia, but he didn’t know the older students as well as he knew the younger students. “I want to get it out of the way,” she said with a sigh.
Blaise, to his credit, inclined his head slightly in Harry’s direction, although his eyes still hadn’t left the group before him.
There was no urgency, but neither did they hold back. Harry braced his arms at either side of Draco’s head, kissing down his neck, rutting against him and relishing in the feel of the pressure it created. He moved his body lower, kissing his chest, pausing to catch his nipple between his teeth, listen to Draco keen with want.
Perhaps my father going to Azkaban was the best thing for me, really. There is no pressure, nobody’s standards to live up to. Except Professor McGonagall’s. And Andromeda’s. She offered me a place to stay when I graduate – did you know that?
“I daresay that woman needs a break,” said Minerva. Harry nodded his agreement as he took a sip of tea. British habits may die hard, but sometimes he really, really wished Minerva was a coffee drinker.
“Arithmancy,” he said dully, “although I don’t really care.” He took a sip of what must have been coffee – hadn’t touched a bite of breakfast, Harry noticed.
Harry couldn’t help it – he grinned at her, then pulled their wands out of his pocket. “They can’t use their wands, either,” he added cheekily.
“I may have told them I’d hold onto your wand, and Zabini’s, too.” He placed his two friends’ wands down on Draco’s desk, trying not to laugh at the shocked look on Pansy’s face.
The minute they entered the common room Harry was accosted by the first year Slytherins, led by Mar, scampering around them and begging to know what happened. He refused to explain to them, but reassured them that yes he was alright and yes he would still be teaching History of Magic the next day. Eventually they left him alone, and the rest of the common room seemed confident that he was alright once he had answered all the rapid-fire first year questions and complimented Mar’s haircut, so they were left in relative silence, the four of them.
“Noticed you don’t have a room, Death Eater,” came a voice in front of them. It was Zacharias Smith, of course. Harry was utterly unsurprised, although he was more surprised to see Justin, Ernie, and Seamus flanking him.
“That still doesn’t explain…” Hermione began, but trailed off when Harry ran an exasperated hand through his hair.
Mar squealed and gave them a jerky wave before dashing off to the Slytherin table. At almost the same moment, McGonagall appeared beside the group with their timetables.
Andromeda just sipped her tea. Harry stifled a sigh. She never made it easy - she’d never ask questions or push him to talk. It was nice, most of the time. But sometimes some things were hard to say.
Perhaps my father going to Azkaban was the best thing for me, really. There is no pressure, nobody’s standards to live up to. Except Professor McGonagall’s. And Andromeda’s. She offered me a place to stay when I graduate – did you know that?
“He was never in my head,” Blaise said, “so I know it’s not the same. But sometimes, it helps me to focus on things I know are true.” He looked up at Harry in the darkness, the whites of his eyes shining. Were they just bright, or were those tears? There were tears in his own eyes, Harry realized – he hadn’t noticed until now.
Harry took a moment to glance worriedly at Pansy, but her face was blank. Blaise was looking at her with something like awe in his expression. Draco was, if possible, even paler than normal. Harry couldn’t help but remember being taken to the Manor during their year on the run. Draco had been there, not at school. No doubt Pansy’s words had hurt him.
Across from where they were standing were two hallways. A crowd was clustered against the wall between the hallways. Harry assumed that was where the list of room assignments. He couldn’t find it in himself to care who he ended up with, particularly.
“The Sorting Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin when I was sorted,” he continued. Pansy looked up, shocked. “Everyone says it was because I had part of Voldemort’s soul in me, or something. I talked to Andromeda about it, too. She was Slytherin, you probably know that. She was horrid when she was younger, too. But Slytherin – ambition, cunning, valuing friendships, even – I don’t think any of those are bad traits, not any longer. And I think they all represent me, too. Maybe the House system has just been taken too far.
Harry nodded absently to Draco and instead turned his head to Andromeda. “Would you like help with the washing up?”
Of course, the Slytherin common room wasn’t at all peaceful when they walked in. It rarely was, but especially now. There were some second and third years playing a loud game of gobstones near the fire, the first years were running around led by Mar (who paused to give them all a wave as they came in). Some seventh years were crowded around a couple tables pushed together, though. They made their way toward them, the boys trailing behind Pansy.
“Want to deal with it yourself, do you?” he asked, as if Harry hadn’t spoken. “Ready to chase down a
As if reading his mind, Minerva sighed. “You have experienced more vitriol than most in the press at such a young age. You have seen first hand how public opinion can change easily and turn you into the villain. This could very well villainize you again.” She paused for a moment and Harry felt himself almost subconsciously run a hand through his hair as he waited for her to continue.
Pansy whacked his shoulder. “Instead of the eighth years keeping their prefect status, and because we don’t get the opportunity to be Head Boy or Girl either, the professors decided to do something else with us.”
One of the seventh year prefects, a boy named Andrew, gave them a look when they approached. “We’re just deciding if we should tell the first years to get lost or not,” he said as they approached. “It’s become impossible to get work done.”
The buzzing in his body slowly cooled. He was able to eat a couple bites of toast, and Draco poured him coffee that warmed him from the inside. He wasn’t feeling calm by any means, but he was present. And in the Days After that was often the best he could hope for.
“Don’t act like you were the only ones who suffered,” Pansy continued angrily. “Don’t act like you’re so righteous. What happened last year, Longbottom? I’ll tell you. You and your cronies painted some stupid graffiti, acted like it was the most rebellious thing in the world. Then Corner got hurt and what happened? You
“That isn’t how it works,” Andromeda said, almost immediately. It wasn’t the response Harry had been expecting, but she went on before he could say anything. “You’re right that Life and Death weren’t balanced when you died. But you’re forgetting the piece of Voldemort that died with you. Something did die and it did restore the balance, Harry. Horcruxes are old magic - I don’t know much about them, but old magic always comes with a price. It is too wild to use lightly.” She took a sip from her tea and gave him a gentle look. “Life and Death always require balance, and it was you who restored that balance after Voldemort disrupted it. I daresay Death owes you a favour.”
Harry let Draco push him down on the bed, straddle him, nuzzle the crook of his neck gently. He let the feeling warm him, force his mind back into my body.
“I need to go…” Pansy spoke, but trailed off slowly. “Not be here,” she finally said with a sigh. “Maybe a walk on the grounds will do it. Are you lot coming?”
Harry’s mind, unbidden, went back to their year on the run – to Ron running away. He came back then, though.
The eighth years followed McGonagall out of her office and down the spiralling staircase into the main body of the castle. It had been rebuilt well, a far cry from the castle’s appearance when they had all gathered for the two month anniversary of the battle. Paintings had been restored, walls rebuilt. But everywhere Harry looked, he saw flashes from the past in his mind eye; crumbling walls, curses flying, Fred falling, Colin Creevy still on the ground, Lavender Brown’s body broken on the corridor floor.
“Did you enjoy killing muggles?” Draco winced, visibly. He didn’t talk about that, ever. Not the raids he had been sent on with Death Eaters, not how he had been threatened and tortured by his wicked Aunt for not having the stomach to kill.
Madame Pomfrey nodded in agreement as McGonagall spoke. “That means there are some very important rules you’ll have to follow,” Pomfrey said. “No magic, in class or outside of it for the next two weeks. No extra activities that will put any strain on your body, like quidditch,” she said with a pointed look at him. “You’ll see me every day for the next week so I can monitor your magic levels, and then every other day the week after. Once we pass the two week mark we’ll devise a new plan based on the levels of your magical stores.”
He couldn’t have, not really. Not when the world needed him to defeat Voldemort, and especially not now that Tededy needed him. But it was his one selfish wish.
“Alright,” Harry began once his last first year had trickled into the classroom, “Today we’re going to talk a little bit about some similarities in some well known evil Muggles and well known evil Wizards.” The class tittered excitedly, as if learning about evil was the best news they’d received all week. Harry laughed to himself as he turned toward the chalk board.
“A letter,” Draco said simply. He was running a hand through Harry’s hair, now. “They can choose to open it or choose not to, and once they read it they can choose to speak to me or choose to burn it or whatever they’d like. It seems better than forcing my company on them.”
“I know,” Draco gave him an odd sort of smile. “I would have hurt you if you hadn’t. Not all these scars are from you, anyways.”
“I’ll try to make sure we learn about everything you write down,” he said once he had turned around, “As long as it’s appropriate for this class. Take all the time you need, and once we’re all done we’ll do something fun, okay?”
As far as Harry knew, he hadn’t visited his mother yet. Harry wasn’t sure if it was because he didn’t want to see her, didn’t want to visit the Manor where she was under house arrest, or was wary about the Aurors they had posted at the Manor every hour of the day to ensure she was complying. He hand’t asked, and Draco hadn’t volunteered any information.
By the time Professor Stone had finished speaking and Harry had gathered the ingredients, and Ginny had divvied up the steps to the potion, he had hoped she would have forgotten her question. One pointed look from her after a moment of silence, though, told him she hadn’t at all. He felt panic gripping the edges of his mind, tried to push it away.
Harry couldn’t help but doubt that – something in him felt off. Maybe it was just his magic being worn out, it probably was, but sometimes it felt like he couldn’t feel anything magical at all. Like the magic in him had dried up.
“So are you,” Harry responded, looking at her out of the corner of his eye. In the Days Before, he would never have imagined this conversation would ever happen. But right now, if he were being honest with himself, he felt closer to Pansy than he did Ron and Hermione. “Are you okay?”
Harry couldn’t find it in himself to laugh, or push to the front the way he would have done in the Days Before. He didn’t understand, not really, how they could be cheerful, being back at Hogwarts. Every step, every turn he made, walking as a living person in a place where so many had died, felt like a slap to the face.
Harry felt his breath leave him in a short gasp as Draco’s mouth trailed down his jawline, found a sensitive spot on his neck. He ran his hands down Draco’s sides as Draco’s mouth found his, kissing him tantalizingly slowly. When Harry pressed forward into the kiss, Draco pulled back. When Harry arched his body, Draco lifted his own body away and -
“I thought we could go to our dormitory?” Harry said quietly towards Zabini, who nodded. Draco saw Harry motion towards the two Gryffindors to follow them, Blaise and Pansy leading the way.
“Oh, I’m Potter now, am I?” Harry smirked, but Draco had stubbornly turned back to his essay and wasn’t looking.
Harry let his head rest back on his pillow, giving himself a moment to process. His magic had exploded, so – “Are they alright?” he asked, suddenly full of worry. He felt sick.
“I’m sure it’s the lesson plans,” she said, and anyone who didn’t know her as well as he did might not have heard the sarcasm or seen the twinkle in her eye.
“It’s quite interesting, really,” she said to Madame Pomfrey, ignoring Harry almost entirely. “I will have to have the Healer come in and look for himself. I’ve never seen anything quite like this.”
“What are you doing in here?” was the first thing that came out of his mouth. It was slightly more aggressive than he intended but, well – the sun wasn’t even up.
“I hope it wasn’t in bed with you,” Harry responded jokingly. He felt more than a little forced, and it must have shown because Mar frowned at him in clear confusion.
people who could ever possibly exist.” She spat out the word forgiving as if it was an inuslt. It was, in a way, given how they had all been raised.
“Part of what we’re going to do in this class is make sure that your reading and writing abilities are good enough to help you keep up in your other classes. And if they’re not, we’ll figure out how to fix it. Today, to see where we’re all at, I’d like you all to write me six inches on what piece of history you’d like to learn about most this year. It can be something I already mentioned, or something I didn’t, and it can be magical history or muggle history.”
“Come on, you idiot,” came a girls’ voice from his side. He couldn’t focus, couldn’t see, even; couldn’t think, but he allowed whoever it was to lead him toward the door to the classroom. He came back to the world once they were face-to-face with Professor Stone, jarred out of his panic by Draco, who had hastily dropped his hand.
Harry winced. “I’d like to think it would have been different if I had been here, but I know nothing would have changed.” He sighed. “All summer Andromeda had to remind me that we were still kids when it all happened. I’ve used Unforgavbles, I’ve killed people, I doubt any of us were charming to you lot either, when we were in our younger years.”
I will not give you details about what I experienced in the war. It was horrendous, it was wrong. I cannot compare it to your experiences – you put yourself under great duress for the good of everyone. I put myself under great duress for the good of nobody except the Dark Lord. Sometimes, in my mind, I am irredeemable, but I try not to give into that. My choices do not define my worth, but they do decide my consequences.
There I go, dithering again. Anyways, that was the first time I perhaps was able to realize that what I believed and how I experienced the world was wrong. I am sorry that you had to be the person to prove that to me in such a gruesome way.
He could tell, somewhere in his subconscious, that Draco had his hand on himself and was jerking off in time to his mouth’s movements on Harry. He was torn between the desire to grab Draco’s hair and the desire to leave his hands where they were, until he didn’t have to make that decision because he was coming harder than he ever had, orgasm sneaking up on him like a train screeching to a halt.
Harry woke in time to rush out for his pre-breakfast meeting with McGonagall, leaving Draco fast asleep behind him. He was starving, not to mention still groggy from the extra sleep and anxious about all the school work he had to complete. Perhaps he’d go for a quick run before breakfast, or a fly – but that seemed a waste of time when he could also just get some food from the kitchens and work on his charms essay or lesson plans instead.
Draco had filled out well over the summer and first part of the school year. He wasn’t a shell of a person anymore – neither was Harry. There was lean muscle to his arms now, his face was more than just bones, even if he was still quite aristocratic and pointy-looking. He was all angles, his hair falling in loose waves down to his chin, and there wasn’t a single thing Harry disliked.
By the end of the day, he was so tired he was ready to drop – but he still had at least three essays to work on, not to mention the amount of reading and lesson planning he needed to get done,
“Two, and neither of them defence professors? You continue to surprise me, Potter.” He saw her glance at him out of the corner of her eye. “Binns could very well be horrid. Don’t come complaining to me when you regret your choice.”
Harry had fully intended to rest, too – he really was exhausted. But Draco, of course, had other plans. They were barely inside Draco’s rooms before he had Harry up against the wall. The stone was rough and cold on Harry’s back, but with Draco’s lips on his he hardly noticed.
Harry took a moment to glance worriedly at Pansy, but her face was blank. Blaise was looking at her with something like awe in his expression. Draco was, if possible, even paler than normal. Harry couldn’t help but remember being taken to the Manor during their year on the run. Draco had been there, not at school. No doubt Pansy’s words had hurt him.
She nodded at him, but he frowned. He felt guilty – more than guilty. He should have known Ron and Hermione wouldn’t have taken well to being forced into a conversation with Pansy, Blaise and Draco in their first moments back. Harry had been here all summer to watch Draco learn and change, had been here all summer to learn and change himself. His best friends had not.
you'll notice this has been turned into a series and a second work has been added. all it is is this story without the smut, since i had some friends who wanted to read it but don't want to read the sex bits. so if you enjoy this, ignore that! if you'd prefer that, hit next work! i've also been thinking about starting a collection of one-shots from other characters points of view (pansy, blaise, mar, ron, hermione, etc). if that's something ya'll would be interested in, please let me know in the comments!
“Common Room,” Blaise said with finality. “We can hunt for some sixth or seventh years to help us with muggle studies.”
Blaise put a hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezed. “I know we’re here, on your bed, in the eighth year dorm at Hogwarts. I know Pansy isn’t far away, probably arguing with Granger instead of sleeping.” He gave Harry a strained smile. “I know Draco is in his little room, probably fast asleep like the peaceful twat he is.” This wasn’t true, they both knew, but was comforting somehow. “I know McGonagall is in the her room, definitely in some sort of
Pansy smiled down at the girl and gently disentangled herself. “I’ll show you after dinner,” Pansy said. “Look, Professor Vector is handing out your timetables now. You don’t want to miss that.”
“The four of them, really,” Draco sighed. “It’s not as though I have a choice, and I’ll still be in my own rooms.”
It was Andromeda who sighed this time. “You can’t lose your magic, Harry. If you lose your magic you lose your life.”
“Now there’s one more muggle I’m thinking of, from around the same time as Hitler. I’m not sure if anyone will know who I’m talking about or not,” he said, but Mar’s hand had already shot into the air for the fourth time that day. “Alright, Mar, who do you think?”
Instead they were kissing. Harry wasn’t sure who started it or even how it had happened, but he was keenly aware of Draco’s lips on his; hands under his sweater and roaming. Harry instinctively curled his hands in the ends of Draco’s hair, pulling his head back. Draco let Harry maneuver him, and then his lips were on Draco’s neck and he was tasting the sweet of his skin mixed with the salt of his sweat.
They turned to their work, then, and Harry put his head back down on the table with a thump. He felt Draco’s hand on his knee, and leaned into the touch before forcing his head back up and taking out a piece of parchment.
“There are mean words for a lot of things, and a lot of people that there’s really nothing wrong with,” Harry tried. Mar looked confused. He tried again. “A lot of people say mean things, and that’s why there are mean words.”
“The Death Eater legislation the Wizengamot is pushing through,” he began. “Do you think I’d be able to speak against it at the vote?”
He winced, knowing it was coming before he even closed his mouth. He had debated leaving Draco out of it, not saying anything, but better they find out from him now than find out he was lying to them later.
“Why do we have to read this? Shouldn’t we all know about them already?” she looked genuinely confused, and there were more than a couple students who looked like they agreed with her. He settled himself on top of his desk and regarded the class.
“Where are you?” Draco whispered finally, after silence that had stretched out endlessly. “You’re so far away today.”
Is this what it had been like in Slytherin, the past six years? Always waiting for conflict, striking before others could strike, unquestioningly doing what Draco said? Although in the past, Draco would never have asked anyone to stand down, Harry knew with certainty. Draco would have led the fight. Harry would never have stood down, either. Not in the Days Before. Nor would he have taken direction from anyone else like this.
She led them not into her office, but into an unused classroom instead. Harry smiled at Pansy’s confused look. “No portraits of old heads in abandoned classrooms.” He often had his meetings with McGonagall in any room
In the Days Before, Harry would have bristled at the nickname. Now he just shrugged. “Wasn’t expecting you,” he said dully, not quite looking at Malfoy’s eyes.
“I’ll be teaching you this year, but you don’t need to call me Professor or anything because I’m still a student, just like you. You can just call me Harry.”
“I think it’s different, then,” Blaise said. “You can’t tell me Crabbe or Goyle never killed anyone.”
For some reason Microsoft Word deleted over half the chapter so i had to rewrite it, which was not my faovurite thing in the world to do espeically since it's an actually pivotal chapter in terms of plot and the direction of this story. sigh.
Sure enough, when he arrived at the History of Magic classroom, there was already a gaggle of first years waiting outside. He let them in, trying not to sigh too loudly. He was excited, sure, and yes, they were eager and adorable, but if he had to go through a year of hero worship from all the students he was teaching, he wasn’t really sure how he’d manage.
Teddy giggled and grabbed at his glasses with his pudgy hands. Huffing, Harry shifted the boy so he couldn’t reach his face. He had just started laughing at almost 5 months old – Andromeda said he was a late bloomer, but Harry had other suspicions. Maybe Teddy spending all his time around adults who had lost so much, who hardly ever laughed, was affecting him.
“I’ll go, I know where she went,” Harry said with a sigh. Before anyone could protest, he had kissed Draco on the temple and disappeared through the door.
Draco had a free period in the morning while Blaise had Care of Magical Creatures, Pansy had a meeting with Professor Stone, and Harry had Arithmancy. His Arithmancy happened to be in conjunction with the fourth years on this particular day, although he’d be in a separate classroom watching through a one-way magical hole in the wall. It was still slightly embarrassing. McGonagall had assured him that it wouldn’t take him long to progress to the level of a fifth year, but sharing classes with fifth years wasn’t that much better, in Harry’s opinion.
“Nev,” he began, tryign to come up with the words to say – trying to come up with a way to fix it, a way to apologize for not being the saviouir they had needed. But he was interrupted.
He and Andromeda had spoken at length about it over the summer before he had sent an owl to McGonagall with his requests for classes. After deliberation and much conversation with Andromeda, McGonagall, Ron, and Hermione, he had decided to take Charms, Transfiguration, History of Magic, Care of Magical Creatures, Herbology, Potions, and work outside of class with some professors to take his OWLs in Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Muggle Studies, which had shocked Ron.
Pansy smiled down at the girl and gently disentangled herself. “I’ll show you after dinner,” Pansy said. “Look, Professor Vector is handing out your timetables now. You don’t want to miss that.”
“I know.” He sighed, trying to let some of the tension out of him. It didn’t work. “I’m going to find McGonagall, see if I can floo Andy to see if she’ll come through today. Want to come with me?”
and then you two come in from your stupid vacation with your stupid prejudices and have to ruin it. You should have said from the beginning that you’d rather spend time with Smith and his cronies than here, would have saved us all the energy of bothering to even try.”
“It’s part of his parole,” Harry said dully. “And it’s important to have a committed pure-blood on the team. He knows more than anyone what information he’s missing to integrate into muggle culture.”
He watched, enraptured, as Draco removed his hands from Harry, reached towards the buttons of his own shirt. He undid them slowly, eyes dark, focused on Harry completely. Harry felt his cock straining against his jeans. He arched, but Draco shifted back onto his thighs so his hips met no resistance, the want making him ache.
What Harry wouldn’t have given, in that moment, for someone he loved to be here to make sense of this for him. Sirius, Lupin, even Andromeda.
The world felt bright and warm as they drifted into sleep. A thought chased its way through Harry’s mind.
“You think we wanted to hurt people? They threatened to kill our families, make us kill each other. Maybe you’d have let your family die for the greater good or whatever noble shite you believe that makes you think you’re better than us, but you’re not any better. You left by yourselves; you stayed home, you disappeared, you didn’t take a single first year or Slytherin with you.
She moved to open the door to the classroom, but looked back at them. “I admit that I thought those in Slytherin would have been safe from the Carrows due to blood status. I see now that I was incorrect; all the Carrows cared about was harm. Hogwarts failed you, and I hold myself responsible for this. I will do all in my power to ensure Slytherin House is a safe and welcome environment for every student that passes through it as long as I am Headmistress of this school.”
He emerged not long after, wet hair dripping into his eyes. Andy shooed him off to meet Draco at the apparation point, just past the wards of the cottage.
lost people, Smith. I don’t blame her; neither should anyone else.” He turned his voice, then, to the crowd that had gathered around them. Most of them looked slightly incredulous. Hannah Abbott was looking rapidly between Harry and Zacharias. Neville and Dean were standing to the side, speaking with each other in rapid whispers. Nott looked distinctly uncomfortable, but was standing resolutely near Neville and Dean.
“I didn’t want to,” Harry responded, sliding into the chair next to him. “Not until I knew I could make it happen.” He began to serve himself some food – if there was one thing he had missed about the castle, it had to have been Hogwarts food. “What professor did you request?” he added, directing his question at Pansy.
Harry worried the cigarette between his fingers before taking another drag. It wasn’t as if he didn’t want the company, didn’t enjoy seeing his friends. Ron and Hermione were departing the next day for Australia, to work on restoring her parent’s memories. Harry ought to be sitting downstairs with them – but when the room got too crowded and it became hard to breath it was easier to just escape. Most of them could escape without leaving – drinking their thoughts away until their eyes shone and they fell into easy sleep. He couldn’t, though. It was nothing against the alcohol, he understood why it was how they coped. But for Harry in the Days After, it made it worse. He’d drink and the room would shrink, and the shadows would lurk around the corners until he fell into nightmares.
When he died, he had seent the tortured part of Voldemort’s soul die along with him, heard Dumbledore tell him that it was past saving, watched the pain it exhibited. Nobody at Hogwarts was past saving, but they all had tortured souls, now. In the Days After, with Andromeda’s help, Harry was able to find that tortured part of his soul. He couldn’t heal it – was unsure if it would ever be healed, but he felt it contract whenever he thought of those who died, whenever he heard a loud noise, whenever someone raised their wand at him. Andromeda had said being aware of it was half the battle of healing it, but Harry didn’t think it could be healed – not really.
“Hey,” Harry said. He reached over to grab Draco’s right hand and hold it, feeling a little bit guilty as he did so. “There’s nothing there,” he said. “There hasn’t been anything there in over a year.”
“Good morning, Minerva,” he responded. Her name did not roll smoothly off his tongue, and he had to fight the urge to call her
They actually made it to lunch without being accosted by a single Slytherin first year. The first years had spent most of the previous day shadowing them, and even Pansy had noted that it felt strange that morning when not a single one approached.
“She’s not that bad,” he said, when Pansy turned her look of fury on him. “She might fold your socks, though. She likes things alarmingly clean.”
“Really?” Hermione asked suddenly. “Only, I imagine there’s a lot of work that goes into her job. What do you help with?” She looked uncomfortable again – about speaking so eagerly to him? Or something else? Harry wasn’t sure.
“And you think you’re so good, Weasley?” she huffed. “Looking down on purebloods that aren’t like you, acting like school children are really the biggest enemy you’ve faced, like we’re worse than Vold-V – than the Dark Lord himself.”
No, the moment the cognitive dissonance stopped for me, the moment when I realized that I no longer truly believed what I had been raised to believe, was that moment when I watched Bellatrix carve the word
“Sorry to disappoint,” he said, wrily, sitting down on the bed next to her. She wasn’t crying, now, but obviously had been. She was sitting on the bed against the headboard instead, holding a pillow to her chest.
He let his fingers trail down Draco’s body, pausing at the hemline of his sweater. Draco arched up, helping Harry to pull it off him, exposing his pale skin underneath. Harry reached down and pulled his own shirt off of his head.
“But Dumbledore what? Dumbledore, who grew up standing for the exact same ideals as Voldemort? Dumbledore, who probably would have kept siding with Grindlewald if he hadn’t killed his sister?”
But it couldn’t be his head, not when it was clearly his magic. Perhaps it was trying to right a wrong. Harry had died, after all. He shouldn’t be alive. The universe was imbalanced, his magic knew it. It was trying to kill him.
“Neither could we,” Pansy said, after a moment of silence. “Nor did any of those tosspots,” she meant the Gryffindors who had been at the castle, he knew. “And they
“Draco has choices now and he’s making the right ones. Have you seen how so many of the kids here interact with him and Pansy? You don’t have to like it, ‘Mione, but the DA failed here. And I’m not saying I expected them to keep putting themselves in harms’ way. We were all just kids. But when they left, when they hid by themselves, it was Draco and Pansy and Blaise and Daphne that took over. And it was them from the start, keeping the Slytherins safe.” Harry sighed. “No one is going to wake up the next morning and be over it. But we can at least start.”
Harry rolled his eyes, Draco saw it in his peripheral vision, but he refused to acknowledge it. Pansy was also rolling her eyes. All his friends were traitors.
“Granger,” she ground out. Harry snorted, surprsinging simultaneously himself and the three surrounding him.
He turned to write his instructions on the chalk board. He could have done it by magic, sure, and it would have been faster, but there was always the chance he’d make the chalkboard explode instead. He should really, probably tell McGonagall about how unstable his magic was being.
“Just the five Slytherin’s then, including you?” Andy pressed. Draco seemed to Harry to relax a little bit.
Harry only partially paid attention as Andromeda spoke with McGonagall about his magic. He floated through the conversation, eager to find Draco and see what he thought about everything, only coming back into himself long enough to give Teddy a kiss on the head and hand him back to Andromeda. He waited patiently, heeding McGonagall’s warning that he needed to check in with her every other day to discuss the progress of his magic before taking off out her office and down the hall.
If Andy was here, Teddy must be somewhere – and Harry was torn between desperately wanting to see the boy but not wanting him to see Harry in a hospital bed, even if he was too young to understand what it meant.
“We’re going to try to keep this discussion simple and factual, alright?” he continued on. “If anyone is upset for any reason, please tell me so we can pause. Some of what we’re hearing about are things we all lived through. Some of it is going to mirror things we lived through. It’s okay to be upset or need a break, alright?” Twenty nodding faces with solemn eyes looked back at him.
She swatted him with a towel. “Yes, and you’re stinking up the whole room. Are you packed for Hogwarts?”
It wasn’t so surprising, not really. They had been children, raised for similar purposes, maybe, just on opposite sides of a war.
As if reading his mind, Minerva sighed. “You have experienced more vitriol than most in the press at such a young age. You have seen first hand how public opinion can change easily and turn you into the villain. This could very well villainize you again.” She paused for a moment and Harry felt himself almost subconsciously run a hand through his hair as he waited for her to continue.
their own. So no Gryffindor eighth years for Gryffindor houses, no Ravenclaws for Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs for Hufflepuffs or Slytherin’s for Slytherins. What if someone like Zacharias Smith gets put with Slytherin?” Harry felt Draco tense beside him, saw Blaise’s eyes flicker and the dark look he cast at Pansy.
Draco’s hands wandered down his shirt, undoing each button slowly and precisely. Harry let out an amused huff although he felt like his heart would burst out of his chest from anticipation and desire. “Pomfrey told me I’m supposed to rest, you know.”
Soon they were in the corridor outside the potions room again. The air was cooler, here, and Harry felt himself breathing more easily, although he hadn’t recognized how stifling the potions room had been until he exited. Draco followed him out, flanked by Blaise and Pansy.
“We thought you might like to find…Weasley and Granger this morning,” Draco said. Harry could tell it took him effor to keep his tone level.
“I don’t know the other’s well enough to say. I suppose that could be it. I’m sure Hermione knows who will be back, though,” he shifted Teddy on his arm, putting the empty bottle down. “I’ll go put him to bed now, I think,” he said to Andromeda.
Despite what he said, Zacharias just smirked at him. “We’ll see what your friends will have to say about being replaced by a bunch of bloody Death Eaters when they get here, then.” He turned suddenly and the crowd dispersed along with him, presumably heading to their dormitories as though nothing had ever happened.
To his surprise, Justin, Ernie, and Seamus all drew their wands, as well. Ernie and Seamus had their wands trained evenly on Zabini. Justin, though, Harry realized with shock, had his wand trained directly on him. At least when they made eye contact Justin had the presence of mind to look slightly abashed.
He couldn’t help but think, though, that perhaps the prejudices that had fed the war, that had already been in place, were as much the fault of those in the Hogwarts houses that constantly demoized Slytherins. Perhaps people became what you made them.
He hadn’t told the Slytherins about the map yet, had wanted to wait until Ron and Hermione were here and had met them. He mostly was hoping that showing them after Ron and Hermione had gotten used to them would make them feel less betrayed that someone else knew the secret of the Map and his Cloak. Now, though, he wasn’t so sure they’d all ever get used to each other.
Still, the period passed quickly. History of Magic, after it, was horrifyingly slow – although Harry was almost used to Binns’ drone at this point, and even managed to take some notes. Hermione was sitting across the room, but he could feel her glancing over often, as if shocked that he was actually paying attention. Especially compared to Ron, he figured, who was napping beside her.
“Just the five Slytherin’s then, including you?” Andy pressed. Draco seemed to Harry to relax a little bit.
Harry could tell when Teddy saw him, not because of the smile on his face or the way he babbled, but because his hair turned almost instantly into an unruly jet black.
“War takes a toll, Harry,” she said after a pause. “Killing takes a toll. Of course it does, or it would be impossible to create something like Horcruxes out of death. You are afraid of your magic.”
The brutality at Hogwarts opened up my eyes to something that has been essential to me, recently. The Carrows did not care about who they hurt. The Slytherins were the most accessible to them; there was no one to stand up for us – and that’s alright, I understand, really, why everyone believed we got preferential treatment. Why everyone believed we were evil. Some of us were – some of us are. I had to watch my best friend hurt children – and enjoy it. That is neither here nor there, nor is it an excuse. I will stop dithering again.
His chest felt tight, and he almost wanted to cry, but couldn’t place the exact reason. Because Pansy was upset with him? That wasn’t it, not exactly. It was as though the sounds of the dining hall had amplified around him, too – and they were different, this year. The chatter was subdued, voices tinged with worry and fear. Harry felt it in the core of himself.
“Sometimes I am,” she said finally. “But no, not right now. Sometimes I think I never will be, you know?”
Pansy relayed the plan quickly and efficiently – Harry’s only role was “Look friendly but don’t talk, for Merlin’s sake, or you’ll scare them away, Potter,” which he couldn’t really argue with. He spent the rest of the feast trying not to agonize about how the Slytherins would probably hate him and it would ruin his desire to open a school before he could even
The conditions of my parole are to stay within the grounds of Hogwarts and refrain from use of magic outside of class, other than small wandless spells. And to help rebuild, of course. As it turns out, I did not do much of the rebuilding part.
“We’re hunting for fish,” Mar said, so innocently Harry had to focus to keep from laughing. Draco and Blaise were both watching from somewhere behind him – he only knew because he could distinctly hear both of them laughing.
He waited until they were outside in the grounds to speak again. “It’s not – it won’t be taught the way Muggle Studies was before. It’s not just about things like electricity, not a way to make muggles look eccentric. It will have a large focus on muggle and magical history, taught in a way that emphasizes reading comprehension and writing skills, especially in first and second year. Then it will focus more on wizard-muggle relations and how to navigate the muggle world. Spending money, technology, using the post, the library, applying to muggle unis – the lot of it. There will be mandatory field trips and everything.”
They took up their usual spaces, Blaise and Pansy immediately curling up on his bed while Draco and Harry perched on Harry’s bed, before realizing there were two more to their number today. Granger and Weasley looked around the room looking distinctly awkward before Granger grabbed the chair from Zabini’s desk. Following suit, Weasley took the chair from Harry’s desk, turning it around and sitting down beside his girlfriend.
“I’d like you to each take some time to read what I’ve handed out and then we’ll use the knowledge you’ve learned to help us list some of the similarities between these men, alright?” Most of the class nodded, but Arwen, raised her hand. Harry raised his eyebrow at her and gestured for her to speak.
“I’ll go, I know where she went,” Harry said with a sigh. Before anyone could protest, he had kissed Draco on the temple and disappeared through the door.
to find a reason to get us sent home and we don’t particularly want to give him one. Your goodie two shoes Gryffindor pals don’t seem to want to lend us a hand, either,” Harry felt as if he were a small child being spoken sternly to for misbehaving. “So we are going to leave before anyone else is up and have a cozy breakfast with the house elves.”
“I’m not spending anything near the amount of time on my hair that Draco does in the mornings,” Harry said. “That’s too much work.”
But I cannot say that was true for me. I was not afraid of muggles, particularly, unless you count the belief that they threatened wizarding society. Polluted blood, I was told, would diminish magic over centuries until we would be nothing but muggles ourselves. Except, when you’re a child it is hard to fathom the idea of centuries – the consequences seem immediate. Maybe that was the point.
teaching first year history – two double periods per week, each a mixture of all the houses that had students – but he had wanted to keep it quiet until classes were underway.
McGonagall paused for a moment, and Harry felt the weight of it – it was a pause that held the weight of a war; perhaps the weight of two wars, the weight of the pain endured by everyone who was present here, and everyone who wasn’t present in the world any longer.
“But we know that doesn’t work!” Harry burst out. He felt anger rising, but tried to tamp it down. The last thing he needed was to explode again. “It’s happened time and time again through history – all suppression like that does is start more wars.”
It took him a moment to locate her. She was the smallest of the bunch, tucked in near the back of the huddle. She looked less nervous than the others, though – more self-assured. She stood up from the bench, too, as he neared, and flipped long, black hair out of her face. In a way, she reminded him of a young Hermione.
She stopped and watched them expectantly – it took the group a moment to realize that she was dismissing them to choose their partners. Harry looked at Draco, feeling panicky all at once. He wasn’t okay with this – hadn’t expected it, couldn’t deal with changes from his expectations or routines right now. His breath was coming shakily and he flinched when Pansy reached toward him. The world was darkening, the only steady presence was Draco’s hand in his.
“Can you disillusion yourself?” Blaise asked suddenly. “If you walk sort of – in-between us, I don’t think anyone will notice if you’re a bit fuzzy at the edges.”
The air carried a slight chill, as if it knew it was the first day of term. He struck off in the direction of the forest, opting to take a path beside the lake. It was peaceful here, the most peaceful place he had been in days.
. Just when Harry wanted to scream from the tension, Draco was gone, standing beside the bed, pulling his own jeans off.
“I didn’t see you at dinner last night,” she said conversationally. He couldn’t help but feel as though she was making fun of him.
“Then, last year, he didn’t come to school. Rumour was going around he was in hiding with his mum – she was never a Death Eater. Not many women were, though. And this year it seems he’s become pals with your lot. That’s all, really.”
“I heard it’s under the lake, and it’s always dark,” said another girl nearer to the front of the group.
Her smile was gentle, but Harry still frowned at her words. For the past three months they had shared house duties and Teddy duties. It had kept Harry from sinking into despair, even through the sleepless nights where the boy cried and cried, missing the mum and dad he had never known.
last night!” The voice came from behind him – loud enough to make him jump and spill coffee down the front of his robes. Blaise gave him an exasperated look from his other side and waved his wand, cleaning up the mess.
Then I was home for Easter. When I was a child we would have a big dinner. Spring vegetables, the best lamb I’ve ever tasted. We would dress nicely, host other families. Pansy often came, as did Vince and Greg. Those were the best times of my life.
“It’s always alright,” she said warmly. A warm Minerva was something Harry was still getting used to. Not that she had ever been cold, per se – just removed, as teachers often were.
“Maybe she should,” he groused. “This is different, though.” He paused for a moment, searching for the words to explain
He didn’t begrudge them for how they acted towards him either, not really. They were right – he had been gone. Maybe being on the run wasn’t the best way to spend the year, nor the Horcruxes or Ron leaving, but it was a sight better than watching the Carrows force students to hurt each other.
“Neither could we,” Pansy said, after a moment of silence. “Nor did any of those tosspots,” she meant the Gryffindors who had been at the castle, he knew. “And they
Blaise Zabini, on his other side, was smirking at him. “Not the time, Potter,” was all he said when Harry made eye contact. Harry mumbled a quick thanks back, working to calm his racing heart.
“Firstly,” she continued, through the whispers of other concerned students, “You will be working with dangerous, volatile potions and ingredients. I do not want to see anyone getting hurt. If you’re fighting with a friend, an ex, an enemy – that all stays at the door. In this classroom I expect everyone, especially my oldest students, to be calm and respectful. If you cannot manage that, you will be asked to leave and to make up your work on your own time.”
The Healer looked harried. “His core is depleted, yes. What I am saying is that there is no physical reason for this. It’s simply in his head. Perhaps he is afraid of magic or no longer wants it and it is reacting in his body, thereby depleting his core. What I am telling you is that there is no fix for it - no potion or spell. He will simply have to decide how he feels about his magic and fix it. There’s no real problem.”
Pansy whacked his shoulder. “Instead of the eighth years keeping their prefect status, and because we don’t get the opportunity to be Head Boy or Girl either, the professors decided to do something else with us.”
A plate with food was shoved into his lap, Pomfrey telling him to eat as much as he could. And he found, for the first time in a while, that he was truly hungry. “Where’s Draco?” he asked as he ate.
Harry dropped back on his pillows. Sunday evening. He had missed so much – his meetings with Binns and McGonagall, cutting Mar’s hair, lesson plans – everything. “When can I leave?” he asked sullenly.
Harry just swatted at his hand. “Do any of you pay attention to the Daily Prophet?” he asked suddenly. The question had been burning since Ron and Hermione had confronted him on Saturday, but by the time he had gotten out of the hospital wing he had lost the nerve to bring it up.
“Look,” Blaise sighed from his other side. “There are people who are beyond forgiving, mate. Your father, for one. People like Vince and Greg, probably,” Draco felt a dull pang at their names, and Pansy’s hand stilled for a moment before continuing its motions in his hair. It wasn’t Blaise’s fault for briging them up, really. Blaise hadn’t been friends with them, nor Draco, for the most part. He had always considered wizarding politics beneath him, had never been shy about his hatred for the Dark Lord
was untouchable and aloof, but it made me crave his acceptance and love more. My most cherished memories are when he would pay me attention; he would sit me on the desk in his study and speak with me as if I were a man, not a young boy. He would tell me about my legacy as a wizard, as a Malfoy. Explain to me the importance of pure blood. Why shouldn’t I have believed him?
“I wasn’t going to put it like that,” Harry responded with a rueful smile. He snuck a glance at Draco as he looked down to sort his cut ingredients. The other boy wasn’t looking at him - was focused on Luna instead, almost smiling. He seemed to be much more comfortable now that he was brewing. When he glanced around the room quickly he managed to find Pansy with a Ravenclaw sixth year, and Blaise, looking aloof next to a seventh year Gryffindor girl who Harry vaguely remembered as being named Melanie.
Saint Mungos was much the same as it had been the last time Harry visited it - after Mr Weasley had been attacked by Nagini. It was less frightening now, however, walking through the halls with Madame Pomfrey at his side into the outpatient area of the Spell Damage ward. At least, there was no one with teapots on their noses or legs cursed to dance forever.
Harry couldn’t help it – he made a face. The thought of Binns teaching his first years, especially Mar, gave him a weird feeling. “Is that everything?” He asked, before the Headmistress could say anything about the face he made. She looked like she wanted to.
“I’ve been thinking,” Draco said suddenly. Harry turned to look at him and raised an eyebrow sleepily. “You look a mess,” Draco said fondly.
Pansy looked shocked. Harry couldn’t tell if it was because McGonagall had just confirmed that there was indeed a Defence professor hired for the fall term, or because she had just been offered a method of avoiding the rest of those in their year by the Headmistress herself. To her credit, though, Pansy merely nodded in acknowledgement.
“Very well,” said the Healer, somehow making it sound as if speaking to Harry was the biggest inconvenience he could fathom. “There is nothing technically wrong with you,” he said to Harry directly. “It seems as though it is all in your mind.”
Harry sighed and motioned to the tea in front of Hermione, watching her take a sip. He held his own mug in his hands, letting it warm him at least a little bit.
Stunned into silence, Harry could only gape at Blaise. After a moment of silence in the room, he seemed to deflate with a sigh. “Sorry,” Blaise said finally. “It’s not good, though. Those bastards will abuse their power, people are going to get hurt.”
Before Andy could say anything else, McGonagall came bustling into Harry’s little area of the Hospital Wing, Madame Pomfrey in tow.
“What happened, anyway?” he asked, turning back to Andromeda. “I remember fighting with Ron and Hermione…” he trailed off with a sigh.
“There are solutions,” Pansy said. She paused a moment, twirling her hair as she thought. There were prominent bags under her eyes – Harry knew from Blaise that she’d been having especially bad nightmares. But of course, there wasn’t really anything he could do about it. They had taken to shifting their sleeping arrangements – Harry with Draco and Pansy in Harry’s bed instead. It wasn’t as though Hermione was horrible to Pansy, but she felt safer with Blaise. And Harry couldn’t complain – he was, of course, more than happy to stay with Draco.
Before he could say anything else, before he could pull himself back or force himself back into the world, McGonagall was standing at the dais. Draco’s hand had made it’s way to his knee under the table; it grounded him a little bit. He could even feel Ron and Hermione casting him worried looks from their spot with the Gryffindors on the other side of the table. He let out a slow breath as McGonagall began speaking.
They had gone back to the eighth year dorms, after, Draco trailing behind Harry and Pansy. He had been fiddling again with his left forearm, Harry had noticed. But Draco hadn’t seemed to want to address it or acknowledge it, so the group of three spent the walk back acting as though they were all fine. Blaise was there when they got back, and without preamble or discussion they had pulled the mattresses, blankets, and pillows to the floor before the four of them curled up; talking quietly until the early hours of the morning.
“How did you meet her?” Blaise asked from Draco’s other side. Harry felt Draco’s chest shake with laugher against his back.
“I thought you liked my hair,” Harry said, pouting but not really. Draco flicked his nose in response.
“Now there’s one more muggle I’m thinking of, from around the same time as Hitler. I’m not sure if anyone will know who I’m talking about or not,” he said, but Mar’s hand had already shot into the air for the fourth time that day. “Alright, Mar, who do you think?”
“Ew,” she said, making a face. “But Mary didn’t say anything mean. She just said she could cut my hair.”
“We’ll know soon enough,” Pansy responded. “We have her first…with the seventh year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws.”
“I wasn’t on school grounds in the first place,” Harry said grumpily, but he felt himself lighten all the same. “Shall I take Teddy through?”
“Two, and neither of them defence professors? You continue to surprise me, Potter.” He saw her glance at him out of the corner of her eye. “Binns could very well be horrid. Don’t come complaining to me when you regret your choice.”
Draco squeezed his hand gently as they neared a small crowd at the Slytherin table, before letting go. Harry felt the loss immediately, but was mollified when he saw two students run up to Draco. They weren’t first years at all – second or third, from the looks of it. His heart bloomed in his chest as he saw Draco bend down to address the two students face-to-face.
Pansy scoffed at him. “The Parkinson’s aren’t even Sacred Twenty-Eight anymore, though my parents and grandparents tried to pretend like we were. But no, and it wasn’t a noble decision, either. ‘Neutrality never loses’ is practically the Parkinson motto. Neither was Blaise’s mum, though she was a pureblood. Too busy marrying rich men and then killing them; doesn’t care whether they’re wizarding or muggle or anything so long as they’re rich. Actually,” she leaned in conspiratorially towards him, “I’m fairly sure Blaise’s dad, whoever he was, was muggle, from the way he talks about him. I’ve never asked, though. Blaise was a right ass when we were younger, anyways.”
Under her watchful eye, he stood up and walked slowly back to where Dean and Seamus were sitting. He moved slowly, but his shoulders were straight, and he didn’t look back.
If I hadn’t been so compelled to do this on paper I am certain I would not be dithering so much, although we would certainly be arguing more. Of course you know that Harry spoke at my trial and returned my wand. I did not see him again until the anniversary in July. I did not attend the proceedings, then – I am sure I would not have be welcome – but I heard he spoke.
Madame Pomfrey ushered him out almost before the Healer had finished speaking, muttering all the way about incompetent healers being the reason she was no longer in the businesss outside of Hogwarts. Harry barely listened, even to her reassurances.
“You sound like Pansy.” His observation earned him a very real glare from Hermione. “Honest!” He added. “She’s about as scary as you, too!”
At the same time, he knew it had been lenient – being confined to Hogwarts hadn’t been true punishment, not really, even if his only sources of conversation had been limited to McGonagall, Flitwick, and Slughorn, before he left.
Harry woke slowly, dimly aware of hushed voices speaking somewhere in his periphery. There was something soft underneath him – a bed? He winced as his eyes opened, becoming aware of a pounding headache and his sore body. Slowly, his argument with Ron and Hermione, his conversations with Mar, came back to him. He let out a frustrated huff of breath. Whoever was nearby must have heard him because the hushed voices stopped.
“Welcome to History of Magic,” he began, looking out at the classroom. It wasn’t quite as full as a usual class would be – as classes were when it wasn’t the year after the war, anyways. There were officially twelve Slytherins – five boys and seven girls - seven Hufflepuffs, and nine Ravenclaws.
Draco couldn’t help it – he felt himself blush furiously. Normally, he didn’t mind Harry kissing him or taking his hand no matter who they were in front of. He welcomed the touch, especially in these days after the war – but also as he always had welcomed touch; like when Blaise put an arm around his shoulders or Pansy played with his hair. It was different, right now, though, with both Granger and Weasley now staring daggers through him.
And then, Hermione, you were being hurt by Bellatrix. And I wish I could say I would hear your screams for the rest of my life, but I won’t, because that was nothing compared to what I saw at the hands of the Carrows. You are branded, though – not like I, of course. I am branded by choice, poor though it may have been. You are branded because of your birth, due to something you can’t control.
Harry shifted in his seat as the Professor Vector called out the name of the first student, opting to lean more heavily against Draco. Pansy was leaning over him, cooing over Teddy as if there wasn’t even a sorting going on at all. And to be fair to her – Harry wasn’t interested, particularly, in the sorting. Another year, more students divided into houses, more rivalries formed – the same as it always was. No, he was much more content to sit here, bent over his godson instead, leaning against his – well, not
“I never realized magic was so technical,” was all Harry could think to say. “I didn’t think you could lose it.”
“Everyone is fine,” McGonagall said gently. “It was an…internal reaction, so to speak. You were the only person harmed.”
She stormed across the room, but shut the door behind her with a small click. Harry made a mental note to avoid ever making Pansy Parkinson angry at him. After a deep breath, he got out of bed and grabbed some clothes for the day.
“The thing is,” Neville continued, “Things will stay this way unless you…well, show your house loyalties, if you know what I mean.”
!” Draco sat up suddenly, blocking Harry’s view of the door. But of course, he didn’t need to see who it was to know.
She gave him a levelled look. “That would be a highly unpopular stance, Harry,” she said. “Sometimes it’s best to let these things run their course. The public will realize it’s a bad idea, over time.”
“You’ve got that look on your face,” Draco said suddenly. He turned and began working his hands through Harry’s hair in a gentle scalp massage. Harry leaned back into the touch.
“You had a choice,” he said, gently. “You and Ron, from the beginning. Not like me and Draco. And I am so grateful that you chose to be my friend and to follow me even when I didn’t want you to.”
“You don’t — fuck, Harry, you act like you exist in a little bubble but you don’t.” She hiccoughed, and a hovering elf took that moment to make two cups of tea appear in front of them. Harry took a polite sip. He really wasn’t sure if he could stomach any more tea today.
Harry sighed. He was leaving for Hogwarts the next day, flooing in. Draco would be staying with Andromeda and flooing in with them. It wasn’t September 1
“That’s bullshit, Longbottom.” It was Pansy, voice firm but body trembling. Blaise was gripping her hand, looking grim. Harry didn’t look away from her, but he could feel Draco slide himself closer, press a knee to Harry’s leg. It was comforting in its own way.
Harry nodded and turned to watch Teddy play with the bubbles floating around above his head. Every time he popped one with his chubby little fingers, another appeared.
Harry whirled fast, his cigarette falling from his fingers. He didn’t bother stomping it out, the castle was all stone, anyways. His heart was pounding in his chest, his vision blurring around the edges.
In the end, I was a pawn for a madman. Forgive me for saying this, but perhaps you both will be able to relate, given how you spent every waking moment with Dumbledore’s biggest weapon (yes, I mean Harry).
“Granger,” she ground out. Harry snorted, surprising simultaneously himself and the three surrounding him.
a reflection to write for their muggle studies seminar the previous evening. Perhaps Pansy would help him with that one.
She led them not into her office, but into an unused classroom instead. Harry smiled at Pansy’s confused look. “No portraits of old heads in abandoned classrooms,” Harry murmured to her quietly. He often had his meetings with McGonagall in any room
“Oh, it was dandy,” he responded, unable to help himself. “Spending my time with only ghosts and thrice daily tea with McGonagall.”
The appointment, thankfully, was fast. They were led into a quiet room - no doubt only afforded to them because Harry was the Boy Who Lived. A much friendlier looking witch assessed him, waving her wand around him in complicated movements to check his vitals while he tried not to flinch.
“And when are you planning on doing the rest of your work?” he asked. “Between old McGonagall today and meeting with Binns tomorrow it’s not as though you’ll have time.”
“I need to…” he said, and paused. What he needed, in all honesty, was to talk to Andromeda and hold Teddy. Neither of those were options.
to keep it secret. After all, he trusted his three friends implicitly. It was more that it was one good reminder of the Days Before. A connection to his dad, but also a reminder of the fun he had had, Before. And was wasn’t quite ready to give that up, to share it around – not yet.
“Set Teddy down, love, and go shower,” she said to him without looking up. Harry smiled to himself. Having someone to care for had kept Andy busy and seemed to keep her grief at bay. Being cared for did the same for Harry in the Days After.
“Is it selfish,” Draco whispered in his ear, as he drew Harry’s sweater above his head, “that I’m grateful you stayed?”
He emerged not long after, wet hair dripping into his eyes. Andy shooed him off to meet Draco at the apparation point, just past the wards of the cottage.
one last lil bit of fluff before the plot picks up and harry isn't allowed to be happy anymore (kidding! or am i...)
He noticed the Slytherins had stayed uncharacterstically silent, too. Harry, Draco, and Pansy had taken up space at the back of the group almost immediately, and somehow Zabini had ended up on Harry’s other side. He tried not to look worried by this turn of events, where he was surrounded by the people the rest of the school hated most.
Yes, I hurt people. No, I never killed anyone. No – despite what you may believe, I did not hurt children at Hogwarts. It was not a noble choice, rather it was a line that I felt the Carrows crossed. Wizarding blood – even muggleborn wizarding blood – was worth more, in my eyes, than the blood of muggles. It wasn’t as though I wanted to see muggles killed, not at that point. No, I would have done anything for life to go back to the way it was, where I could continue to be quietly superior. But again, this was not because I believed muggles worthy of saving, rather because I believed no one worthy of killing. That isn’t a redeemable characteristic of mine, simply a self-serving characteristic.
“Pansy,” gasped one of the girls. She rushed forward again to hug Pansy around the middle, the rest of the group following until Pansy was nearly buried under Hufflepuffs. A couple made their way to Blaise, too.
By the time they entered the Great Hall, he was on high alert – every sound making him jump and shake. Draco was still holding his hand on one side and Blaise had materialized on the other, both keeping him steady. Pansy was ahead of them, saying goodbye to the Hufflepuffs as well as a couple Ravenclaws that had joined along the way.
“It is when you’re annoying me,” Draco said without malice. He took the offered shirt, too, and pulled it on over his head. Harry slid back into bed beside Draco, nestling his head on the other boy’s chest; a silent request for Draco to stay the night in his bed.
Harry saw Zabini raise an eyebrow and exchange a look with Pansy, but he nodded. “Guess that leaves me and Pans. To the grounds it is.” He winked at Draco, and Harry tried to pretend he hadn’t seen.
“There are solutions,” Pansy said. She paused a moment, twirling her hair as she thought. There were prominent bags under her eyes – Harry knew from Blaise that she’d been having especially bad nightmares. But of course, there wasn’t really anything he could do about it. They had taken to shifting their sleeping arrangements – Harry with Draco and Pansy in Harry’s bed instead. It wasn’t as though Hermione was horrible to Pansy, but she felt safer with Blaise. And Harry couldn’t complain – he was, of course, more than happy to stay with Draco.
“Dare I ask where you discovered this information?” she gave them each a piercing look, but Pansy merely shrugged.
Her tapping stopped, replaced almost immediately with bouncing on the balls of her feet. “Okay!” she said, before sprinting back to her friends.
“I wasn’t always the Dark Lord’s favourite,” Draco gasped out. “I was particularly useless, most of the time.”
Deciding he’d try the kitchens first, since it was on his way to the Slytherin common room anyway, he spun on his heel and headed towards the corridor that would take him to the painting of the fruit. The castle halls were quiet although it was a Sunday - the younger students were likely outside enjoying the last of the good weather and the older students studying.
Andromeda tsked. She and Harry had discussed Draco and Narcissa’s situation at length many times, and he knew she didn’t approve of the treatment of her sister or her nephew. “A complete shame they’re keeping you separate,” she said, lips pursed. “As if you’d be a threat.” He saw Draco give her a small smile. “If you need anything, you write me. Understand?”
“Better for all of us,” Smith responded snidely. “I’m shocked they even let you back in.” Before anyone could react, he spat, hitting Draco on the face.
Draco smiled. Just a small smile, but it was there. “Hardly,” he said back, almost a quip. “You have a very obnoxious habit of getting out of difficult situations.”
“Well, how would you put it?” Ginny asked after a moments silence. Seeing he wasn’t going to get out of it, Harry relayed to her the events of the first week – everything from the first day in the eighth year common room to smuggling Draco out that morning.
He had spent the summer pulling strings at the ministry, too. Himself, Andromeda, and Professor McGonagall of all people, to be exact. It had ended, after appeals to the Wizengamot and the Minister for Magic himself, with permisson for Draco to visit his mother and Andromeda as long as he provided a written request to the Ministry a week before and did not bring his wand.
The second, that he would do whatever Draco wanted, whatever he needed, because in the Days After it seemed that there was one thing that was true: Draco Malfoy was inevitable.
And then she bustled out, leaving Harry to slouch against the wall until his head hit it with a thump and Madame Pomfrey to give him a pitying look.
“No?” Harry asked in surprise. Looking closer, of course, he noticed that some of them looked newer than the others, still pink and puckered under his hands. He leaned down to trail their paths with his tongue, felt Draco shudder under him.
Maybe it wasn’t his death, really, that had changed his life so significantly. Maybe it was many tiny things. His death, sure. Andromeda, finding him tired and sobbing over Lupin’s body that same day. Charlie, taking him under his wing when his best friends had left.
“Better than what, Potter?” Draco growled. “Better than getting to go places? Or see your friends? Better than being the world’s saviour?”
Have you heard of cognitive dissonance? I learned about it this summer. When you’re presented with knowledge that goes against your beliefs, your brain ignores it – literally, unless you can consciously confront it. It’s a muggle idea – as many ideas about the brain are. They call it psychology. I don’t know why wizards have never bothered to study the mind, it seems so important.
“We had planning to do, Potter,” she hissed at him. “And you had to go and disappear to shag Draco instead and leave me to do it all on my own.”
“Didn’t realize the Saviour of the Wizarding World startled so easily,” Malfoy drawled back, but there was no malice in his tone. Harry shifted to the side – the oher man was standing much too close to him, and fumbled with his cigarette pack in his attempt to light another. He needed to take a drag, needed to calm himself down, couldn’t hope to do that with Draco Malfoy standing that
That was how he ended up curled up in bed, half asleep, at a time that was horrendously early, with Draco complaining about how he needed to take better care of himself. Harry could only really grunt in response. He was more focused on the lesson plans for the next week that he still needed to complete.
The appointment, thankfully, was fast. They were led into a quiet room - no doubt only afforded to them because Harry was the Boy Who Lived. A much friendlier looking witch assessed him, waving her wand around him in complicated movements to check his vitals while he tried not to flinch.
“They’re always vague like this, here,” she said to him as gently as he’d ever heard her speak. “I don’t find it good practice to beat around the bushes with my students.”
Briefly, Harry wanted to argue. In the Days Before he would have, woudln’t have liked the implication that he was weak or afraid. Now, though, he thought about how he posed a danger for Teddy with his outbursts. How he almost hurt Ron and Hermione, but turned the magic inward on himself instead. How he was afraid for Draco because the other boy couldn’t carry a wand.
“Kind of, yeah,” Harry agreed. He wanted to touch her hand, hold it still, but was fairly certain that was the wrong thing to do. “Mary was being sarcastic. She was trying to be mean to you.”
“Can anyone think of any Muggles that may have been starting wars around the same time?” Harry asked once he had turned back to the class. Fewer hands went up, and this time it was easy to identify the purebloods by the uncomfortable glances they cast around the room.
Harry kissed Teddy on the forehead and stepped outside. The sun was beginning to set, washing the world in pink and orange hues. As he walked, he tried not to look at the spots that held memories from the Days Before. Where he and Hagrid had crashed the motorcycle after seeing Voldemort on their way to this very cottage. Tried not to remember Moody’s death, George’s ear, Lupin and Tonks and Fred alive.
about fish, but Mar was looking at him so expectantly that he felt like he needed to say something. It was the right decision – as soon as he said it, her whole face lit up with excitement.
The brutality at Hogwarts opened up my eyes to something that has been essential to me, recently. The Carrows did not care about who they hurt. The Slytherins were the most accessible to them; there was no one to stand up for us – and that’s alright, I understand, really, why everyone believed we got preferential treatment. Why everyone believed we were evil. Some of us were – some of us are. I had to watch my best friend hurt children – and enjoy it. That is neither here nor there, nor is it an excuse. I will stop dithering again.
“Whoever the new defence professor is, I suppose,” she said with a sigh. As far as anyone knew, the post had yet to be filled. At the very least, they hadn’t been introduced to any new professors, yet. At Harry’s inquiring look, she added, “I’d like to be an Auror Potter, what of it?”
Harry was so surprised he sat bolt upright in the bed. “That ended horribly last time,” Harry said. “Are you mad?”
“Is there a problem, here?” Harry looked up to see McGonagall standing over them. Draco removed his knee from Harry’s leg, and he felt the absence like a slap to the face.
And then she bustled out, leaving Harry to slouch against the wall until his head hit it with a thump and Madame Pomfrey to give him a pitying look.
Harry was so surprised he sat bolt upright in the bed. “That ended horribly last time,” Harry said. “Are you mad?”
“I’d like to open a school,” he said finally. Pansy raised her eyebrows, which he took as permission to continue. “My godfather left me his old house – I’d like to convert it into some sort of primary school that would take in purebloods, halfbloods, and muggleborns before Hogwarts. They’d learn core subjects from muggle schools, but they’d also learn magical basics – history and culture. That way they’re exposed to all ways of living, I suppose,” he finished, somewhat lamely.
“Didn’t McGonagall say the new potions professor was willing to unofficially take you on?” Blaise asked, grabbing Draco’s timetable out of his hands. “That’s not even on your timetable yet, I’m sure some of those slots will fill.”
Ginny hummed thoughtfully when he was done. “It will sort itself out,” she said finally. She gave him a pointed look. “It usually does.”
It was hard to fight what I’ve learned – to learn new ways to live and see the world. Did you know that muggles have been to the moon? I did not. I think that is fascinating. Even with all the magic at our hands, wizards have never even dreamt of entering space. I am dithering, though.
“What did he get probation for, Hermione? Torture? Hurting people? Using Unforgivables? We did that too, in case you forgot. Or I did, at the very least. We’re two sides of the same coin, Draco and I.”
!” Harry spluttered, sat up like a shot, as water was poured on his face. His vision came back to properly to see Blaise standing over him, looking slightly sheepish.
Harry exchanged a bemused look with Draco, who pulled him closer to lean against his side. It was strange to think of the bonds that had forged, in the Days Before. In another context, perhaps, it could have been comforting – but how many nightmares did these children have? How many scars, how much fear?
Harry pocketed the Marauder’s Map as he pet the dog painting that led to Draco’s room. He hadn’t necessarily been lying when he said he knew where Pansy had gone – it just wasn’t exactly the truth, either.
“I didn’t see you at dinner last night,” she said conversationally. He couldn’t help but feel as though she was making fun of him.
“I don’t know why she would be mean,” he settled on saying. “People can be mean for a lot of reasons. Maybe she was having a bad day.”
The warm July air blew patterns across Harry’s skin, although he shivered in spite of it. The starry sky felt as though it was flooding his vision with light, and for a moment he considered going back inside but shook the idea off quickly.
Harry grinned a little bit. “I’m not taking defence,” he said. He watched her mouth form into an ‘o’ of shock.
“You can start being a good influence on Ron, then,” she said, putting her arm around his waist to guide him out. “Imagine the kind of marks you can get now that you’re applying yourself.”
No, the moment the cognitive dissonance stopped for me, the moment when I realized that I no longer truly believed what I had been raised to believe, was that moment when I watched Bellatrix carve the word
girl in the corridors to attack her for revenge? What’s the curse going to be? I heard you have a pretty mean cruciatus. I know your stupid
“Stop being melodramatic,” Pansy chastised him. She was running her fingers through his hair, which he typically found quite relaxing, but today it made his insides squirm. “They’re Gryffindors, they’re the most
“-can’t just walk him out with other people around,” she said as he came to. He felt around for his glasses, accidentally smacking Draco on the nose as he did so. The other boy, who was already awake, huffed out an exasperated “Potter!” before handing Harry his glasses.
Harry whirled fast, his cigarette falling from his fingers. He didn’t bother stomping it out, the castle was all stone, anyways. His heart was pounding in his chest, his vision blurring around the edges.
Everyone was looking expectantly at Draco and Harry. Harry put his head down on the table, which prompted Draco to sigh. “We can’t all write about the same topic,” he said. There were mutters of agreement around the table, but no one else said anything. Harry assumed they were still watching Draco expectantly by the way he sighed again.
Harry wasn’t really sure where to go from here. How did one start a possible insurrection in a week? There was only one good answer. Pansy Parkinson.
“Today is also a day for grief,” the Headmistress continued, finally. “As we mourn for those who cannot be here with us, for those who will not be waiting for us at home, for those who’s memories still exist in our hearts.
“We don’t need to talk about it,” Zabini said then. “It just sounded – sounded worse than your usual.”
It was two months to the date since the Battle of Hogwarts, marked in Harry’s mind as two months Since I Died. That was how life seemed to be these days, in the slowness of recovering and learning how to live in a world free of Voldemort. There were the Days Before – his whole childhood marked by danger lurking around the corner – and the Days After – marked by fear and flashbacks. Hermione had been reading, of course, her only coping mechanism, really. She threw around words like “post traumatic stgress” and “anxiety” as if she had been studying them her entire life. Harry preferred to call it “Maybe I Should Have Stayed Dead”.
Harry worried the cigarette between his fingers before taking another drag. It wasn’t as if he didn’t want the company, didn’t enjoy seeing his friends. Ron and Hermione were departing the next day for Australia, to work on restoring her parent’s memories. Harry ought to be sitting downstairs with them – but when the room got too crowded and it became hard to breath it was easier to just escape. Most of them could escape without leaving – drinking their thoughts away until their eyes shone and they fell into easy sleep. He couldn’t, though. It was nothing against the alcohol, he understood why it was how they coped. But for Harry in the Days After, it made it worse. He’d drink and the room would shrink, and the shadows would lurk around the corners until he fell into nightmares.
Professor Stone waved them in. Harry could feel the concerned look she trained on him as he walked by, but he kept looking ahead. There were more pressing things on his mind than his breakdown – like why Ginny Weasley had shown up out of nowhere after months of anger to partner with him in potions.
Harry glanced over – Draco was smiling down at the first years, looking as gentle as Harry had ever seen him, like was around Teddy, maybe, but with less of the discomfort of being around a baby. The first year students seemed enraptured by Draco’s words, they were all gazing up at him almost adoringly. Harry was fairly confident that if anyone was going to be getting any hero-worship from the Slytherins it was going to be Draco, not him.
“You could say that,” Harry said, unable to help the way his voice came out breathy and soft, unable to keep Draco from affecting him so viscerally.
“When I approached the professors about this very situation, Professor Slughorn was adamant he would only put his support behind it if you were able to be the Student Guardian to the Slytherin House. And although Professor Slughorn announced his retirement not long after, the staff were almost all unanimously in favour of the idea. You and Mr Potter are to be in charge of the Slytherins. And – I was going to tell him this tomorrow at our meeting, but I shall instead explain to both of you now – if Mr Malfoy were to lend a hand in an unofficial capacity, it would not be cause for concern.”
Draco was a bit fuzzy on the edges – since they were out of class he couldn’t cast the charm on himself. Harry couldn’t cast it, because – well, his magic was still unpredictable. And getting worse, it seemed, but he was trying not to dwell on it. So Pansy and Blaise had fought over whose disillusionment charm was better – a fight which Pansy ultimately won. Still, no one seemed to notice his slight edges as they ducked out of the common room.
It seemed to bring the nerves back in the group – they all shifted uncomfortably for a moment. The boy who suggested the name Mari piped up again, looking distinctly more nervous this time. “I heard it’s in the dungeons,” he said, quietly.
“A thinly veiled threat, almost,” Blaise filled in for her. “Unless you all love each other very much,” he said in mimicry of the hat’s voice, “You will all die cold and alone.”
“Now, have I assumed correctly that you are here to speak with me and not taking a casual stroll around the castle? If I’m wrong, by all means,” she gestured to the corridor behind her. Harry had to stifle his laugh at Pansy’s confused look.
“The holidays will be soon,” Andy said gently. “I’ll come through with you. If Minerva is there we can talk to her together. I daresay it may save you some trouble given that you left school grounds without permission.”
Hermione put her head on the table, cradled in her hands. She didn’t shake off the tentative hand that Harry put on her shoulders.
“It was, at that.” They both jumped at a voice behind them. It was Professor McGonagall, having clearly just exited her office, which was just around the corner. Harry felt himself blush.
Minerva says the best way to spit in the face of the Dark Lord is to oppose his ideals – not just on the surface, per formatively, but wholeheartedly. She is right. At my trial I did not necessarily believe that muggles were as good as wizards, I did not believe they were worth as much or as important or worthy of life in the same way.
He only partially noticed Blaise disappear from his side and shoulder his way into the crowd; then reappear almost as quickly. He jumped when a hand landed on his shoulder. “Looks like it’s you and me, mate,” said Zabini into his ear.
“I’m okay,” Harry repeated again, helplessly. Angry Draco, he could deal with. Controlling Draco he could handle. Demanding and needy Draco was easy. But scared Draco was something he hadn’t encountered yet. A Draco that expressed his need for comfort through softness instead of angry quips and pushing him away was new and Harry wasn’t exactly sure how to handle it.
“It’s a little bit drafty,” Draco continued. “But we’ll teach you some warming charms. There’s always a fire on in the fireplace, too, and the older students will conjure you flames that you can carry around if you ask.”
“Well, I think this year we’ll talk about some big wizarding history events that happened in the last fifty years. We’ll talk about Grindlewald and Voldemort,” some of the students shuddered at the name, but he chose to ignore it, “and how those wars affected us and the muggles. We’ll also talk about the founding of Hogwarts a little bit. Those are the big things. Some of you will know a lot about these things already,” he cast his gaze across the room, trying to make eye contact with all of his students. All except Mar. “Lots of you won’t. So if you know some stuff already, I want to see you helping the people who don’t, okay?”
Bumping the door open with his hip, Harry stepped into the cottage. Andromeda was bustling around the kitchen, preparing dinner, most likely.
“You should let Pansy style your hair,” Draco said suddenly. “She’s quite good with hair trimming spells.”
The fact was, Harry had found dozens of excuses to visit in the weeks following that night. Sorting library books for Madame Pince, calming Myrtle while her bathroom was being repaired, permanently sealing the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. And of course, if he happened to bump into Draco Malfoy, who would complain, really? He couldn’t, however, find any good reasons to stay the night. In fact, it was expressly not allowed. The other problem was that he had time to visit the castle much less than he liked, simply because Teddy was here and needed him.
“Yeah,” Harry said. He leaned back on the pillows and closed his eyes for a moment. “How has wizarding society existed for so long without solutions for problems like this?”
When his breathing slowed, he disentangled his hands and pulled Draco, who had also finished, to his feet, kissing him long and hard.
When he came to, he was wrapped in Draco’s arms, feeling more peaceful than he had since, probably, the Days Before.
Draco nodded and Andromeda turned her fierce look on Harry. “You as well. You’ll be alright, both of you. Now, who else is coming back?”
“A letter,” Draco said simply. He was running a hand through Harry’s hair, now. “They can choose to open it or choose not to, and once they read it they can choose to speak to me or choose to burn it or whatever they’d like. It seems better than forcing my company on them.”
. Perhaps, he thought, the most terrifying part of his nightmare had been how willingly he had crossed the veil. He hadn’t tried, hadn’t lifted a finger, really, to help his friends. Even if it was just a dream – it made him feel like he was capable of just…not caring. And there was guilt, too. His nightmare had reflected so clearly his deepest wish in the Days After, the wish that he had just stayed dead. That he had gone on. That for once, he had done something selfish for himself. Instead of facing a hostile castle, angry friends, he could be with his dad, Sirius, Remus…
“Like hell it didn’t,” Ron snarled angrily. “I’m sure he’s loving the benefits of fucking the Saviour of the Wizarding World – the sooner he does his time the sooner he can fuck off back to his life of luxury and muggle killing, right?”
This morning they had entirely missed their early breakfast with Pansy and Blaise. Draco had been adamant about skipping breakfast altogether – Potter had been adamant about attending. Draco understood, of course, it was his friends first morning back at Hogwarts – but he didn’t want to have to sit through the whispers and stares that followed him everywhere he went. Didn’t want to have to look Weasley and Granger in the eyes for the first time in front of everyone.
“That’s our cue,” Pansy sighed. “Remember to try not to make an idiot of yourself.” She cast a look at Harry specifically. He just rolled his eyes, He had learned, in the past week, that she got like this when she was nervous – angry and abrasive. Or rather, more angry and abrasive than usual.
He missed her more than he had thought he would, for someone who had only been in his life for a short time. He felt his eyes glisten slightly and winced to himself. In the Days Before, he would have been angry. In the Days After, he was apparently just a sap.
“Better for all of us,” Smith responded snidely. “I’m shocked they even let you back in.” Before anyone could react, he spat, hitting Draco on the face.
Harry grinned somewhat ruefully at him. The other boy wasn’t wrong at all. In fact, he was quite right. It wasn’t something Harry would have suggested in the first place, had he known how it was going to end up from the start.
Harry sighed when every single head at the table turned toward him for advice. “I’ll handle it,” he said dully. They all seemed pleased by the answer. Wankers, the lot of them.
“It’s alright, you daft idiot,” Pansy said from his side. Her voice sounded far away – it was the feeling that was becoming familiar to Harry, since coming back to Hogwarts. As if everyone was on the other side of a long tunnel, and no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t quite get back.
Harry shifted in his seat as the Professor Vector called out the name of the first student, opting to lean more heavily against Draco. Pansy was leaning over him, cooing over Teddy as if there wasn’t even a sorting going on at all. And to be fair to her – Harry wasn’t interested, particularly, in the sorting. Another year, more students divided into houses, more rivalries formed – the same as it always was. No, he was much more content to sit here, bent over his godson instead, leaning against his – well, not
“Thanks,” Harry said, albeit begrudgingly. He had always liked Neville, generally, but it seemed a deliberate slight that he was offering Harry help after having already stood around to watch Zacharias and his friends pull wands on him. And it didn’t escape Harry’s notice that while Neville clearly thought Harry was deserving of help, the thought did not extend to the people around him.
“One could argue that you would have a quiet life if you stopped sticking your nose into everyone’s business,” she responded.
Maybe, in deciding to open a school, become a teacher, he had made a great career choice. Or maybe this would all fall apart around him. But for the first time in the Days After, Harry was feeling hopeful.
“Yeah,” he said, dully. Harry didn’t particularly want to think about leaving, even if it would become reality tomorrow.
Draco threw a towel at him. “Blaise and Pansy know where we are – they came looking for us last night. You didn’t even move when they came in. Pansy was convinced you were dead.”
“I did a lot of reading this summer, too. No one viewed Slytherin as an evil house, not until Voldemort, not really. I mean – Dumbledore was in Gryffindor and he almost helped Grindlewald take over the world, and maybe if he had gone through with that, people would act the same way about Gryffindor. Even the way people talk about Salazar Slytherin or the chamber of secrets, that’s changed in the last fifty or so years, since Voldemort. So maybe you all just became what we made you to be, you know?”
“Where are you?” Draco whispered finally, after silence that had stretched out endlessly. “You’re so far away today.”
Draco heaved a deep sigh when he was done. “No wonder she didn’t want to talk about it,” he said finally. “It’s funny, that year was so horrible, but perhaps if it hadn’t happened the way it had we would all still be as horrid as we were in sixth year.”
The next thing Harry knew, sun was shining through the false window in his dormitory. He woke slowly, conscious of the voices flowing around him, but too groggy to make them out. His bed dipped, and someone placed his glasses in his hands.
“Look,” Blaise sighed from his other side. “There are people who are beyond forgiving, mate. Your father, for one. People like Vince and Greg, probably,” Draco felt a dull pang at their names, and Pansy’s hand stilled for a moment before continuing its motions in his hair. It wasn’t Blaise’s fault for bringing them up, really. Blaise hadn’t been friends with them, nor Draco, for the most part. He had always considered wizarding politics beneath him, had never been shy about his hatred for the Dark Lord
Then Draco had shampoo and was lathering it in Harry’s hair and really, Harry realized, he hadn’t known bliss until this. Draco tugged on his hair, bit his neck and lapped at the spot with his tongue. Harry thought he would implode any minute.
The Healer looked harried. “His core is depleted, yes. What I am saying is that there is no physical reason for this. It’s simply in his head. Perhaps he is afraid of magic or no longer wants it and it is reacting in his body, thereby depleting his core. What I am telling you is that there is no fix for it - no potion or spell. He will simply have to decide how he feels about his magic and fix it. There’s no real problem.”
This silence was less oppressive than when McGonagall was speaking. Harry felt himself come back to slowly. He was holding Pansy’s hand, he realized. She was dry-eyed, but looked suddenly exhausted, as if the world were too much. Draco’s hand was still on his knee –the other boy was looking straight down at his plate. Harry leaned into him cautiously, feeling gratified when Draco leaned back. He couldn’t see Blaise, on Draco’s other side, except for the arm that extended around Draco’s shoulder.
“We’re going to try to keep this discussion simple and factual, alright?” he continued on. “If anyone is upset for any reason, please tell me so we can pause. Some of what we’re hearing about are things we all lived through. Some of it is going to mirror things we lived through. It’s okay to be upset or need a break, alright?” Twenty nodding faces with solemn eyes looked back at him.
“I’m going to pretend that made any sense,” Pansy responded. “Blaise has gone off to the kitchens. We’re supposed to meet him there in about…” she trailed off to glance at her wrist, as if she was wearing a watch. She wasn’t. “Now, but you’re bloody hard to wake up.”
“Didn’t realize the Saviour of the Wizarding World startled so easily,” Malfoy drawled back, but there was no malice in his tone. Harry shifted to the side – the other man was standing much too close to him, and fumbled with his cigarette pack in his attempt to light another. He needed to take a drag, needed to calm himself down, couldn’t hope to do that with Draco Malfoy standing that
“You are,” Harry pushed, hoping his tone came off teasing. He looked over when Draco didn’t respond, to see the other man stubbornly looking at the wall instead of Harry. His right hand was back to playing with his left forearm.
Harry stood and stretched. Draco was due to arrive soon, and he had been trying to calm his nerves. Truthfully, nothing had happened since that night on the Astronomy Tower. Nothing but talking under the watchful eyes of professors, at any rate. They hadn’t spoken of that night, either. In the Days Before, Harry may have asked.
Do not misunderstand me, I am not upset by this. It was quite cunning of her, really. She understood that I was, in part, willing to learn – I just didn’t want it to seem like my idea.
“Alright,” said Harry, relaxing slightly. Ron and Hermione were being…incredibly infuriating, of course, but that didn’t mean he wanted to see them hurt – or to have hurt them. “So – what happens now?” he asked, before his thoughts could take him further than he needed to go. “Am I alright now?”
When Harry’s mind came down and settled back in his body, Draco was curled agasint him, head tucked into his shoulder. “Alright?” he asked when Harry shifted beside him.
Maybe it was his hero complex – Andromeda had certainly enouraged himto get out of the house; to visit the Weasleys, go flying with Charlie, visit the joke shop, floo Ron and Hermione who were still in Australia. Most of this he did. Most of it, actually, he did with a smiling baby attached to his hip.
“Well, Mr Potter,” she said, seating herself in a conjured chair beside his bed as if he hadn’t said anything, “I had hoped the Hospital Wing would be seeing less of you, this year.”
Harry couldn’t help it – through the panic, he snorted. “Yes, and instead I went to him willingly,” he countered. “We were all doing our best to survive, we
He felt Harry nudge him, and looked over to see him smiling slightly expectantly at Draco. “Oh yes,” Draco continued, drawling now. “And tea with Potter, how could I forget? Sometimes even tea with Potter
She moved to open the door to the classroom, but looked back at them. “I admit that I thought those in Slytherin would have been safe from the Carrows due to blood status. I see now that I was incorrect; all the Carrows cared about was harm. Hogwarts failed you, and I hold myself responsible for this. I will do all in my power to ensure Slytherin House is a safe and welcome environment for every student that passes throught it as long as I am Headmistress of this school.”
“Honestly, Potter, it’s like you end up in a different world,” she said. He shrugged, but could feel Draco snickering against his back. Perhaps in the Days After he was a little bit…fuzzy – but it wasn’t him, really, it was the world. The world was fuzzy; too fast and too slow and too hard and too soft and hurt too much and didn’t feel like anything at all and Harry didn’t know what to do with it. He had the strong urge to look up, towards Ron and Hermione, but forced it down. Now was not the time.
She took a deep breath, leaned against him carefully. He put an arm around her, equally as carefully. It wasn’t that he was touch-averse, necessarily, but Ron and Hermione had never needed so much affection from him. He found it strange.
“Really?” Hermione asked suddenly. “Only, I imagine there’s a lot of work that goes into her job. What do you help with?” She looked uncomfortable again – about speaking so eagerly to him? Or something else? Harry wasn’t sure.
He was too shaken from existing, in the Days After, to handle a crowd of that size, if he were being honest. Instead, he left the castle, Invisibility Cloak tucked into his pocket. Draco, Pansy, and Blaise had each other, the others were distracted in the Common Room; it finally felt relatively safe to go for a walk by himself.
“No one else needed saving!” Weasley exclaimed. “It’s not like the Carrows were hurting pure-bloods. The DA were the only ones standing up to them, no one would have gotten hurt after they left.” To Draco’s satisfaction, he sounded unsure as he finished talking.
“Pansy,” gasped one of the girls. She rushed forward again to hug Pansy around the middle, the rest of the group following until Pansy was nearly buried under Hufflepuffs. A couple made their way to Blaise, too.
This silence was less oppressive than when McGonagall was speaking. Harry felt himself come back to slowly. He was holding Pansy’s hand, he realized. She was dry-eyed, but looked suddenly exhausted, as if the world were too much. Draco’s hand was still on his knee –the other boy was looking straight down at his plate. Harry leaned into him cautiously, feeling gratified when Draco leaned back. He couldn’t see Blaise, on Draco’s other side, except for the arm that extended around Draco’s shoulder.
He did his best not to laugh, but really – it was hard. “Okay, do you have a nickname or a different name I can call you?”
“I have my moments,” Harry responded in an imitation of Blaise’s arrogant tones. “They’ll probably just yell a lot,” he said, more normally this time.
The world felt bright and warm as they drifted into sleep. A thought chased its way through Harry’s mind.
Sure enough, when he arrived at the History of Magic classroom, there was already a gaggle of first years waiting outside. He let them in, trying not to sigh too loudly. He was excited, sure, and yes, they were eager and adorable, but if he had to go through a year of hero worship from all the students he was teaching, he wasn’t really sure how he’d manage.
“This is not the first time the wizarding world – or even the muggle world has gone through something like this,” she said carefully. “People will want to be careful, now more than ever before, that we prevent the same type of war from happening again.”
Hermione rolled her eyes, although it looked half-hearted. “Your consequences were winning a war. His were hurting people and probation.”
It was two months to the date since the Battle of Hogwarts, marked in Harry’s mind as two months Since I Died. That was how life seemed to be these days, in the slowness of recovering and learning how to live in a world free of Voldemort. There were the Days Before – his whole childhood marked by danger lurking around the corner – and the Days After – marked by fear and flashbacks. Hermione had been reading, of course, her only coping mechanism, really. She threw around words like “post traumatic stress” and “anxiety” as if she had been studying them her entire life. Harry preferred to call it “Maybe I Should Have Stayed Dead”.
to be placed there. Now, in the Days After, he simply exchanged a bemused look with Draco. He might be angry if he had to share a dorm with Zacharias Smith, but nothing could really get him riled up these days.
“I couldn’t do anything,” he mumbled into Draco’s lips, hardly aware of his words. Needingto focus on Draco, on his lips and hands and his breath against Harry’s cheeks. “They would send me away, to someone else, who would say the same thing. Until,” he broke off, felt his body shake. Was it fear? No, he realized, it was a sob that he couldn’t let out. “Until I ended up at the veil. Bellatrix-” He felt Draco’s hands falter on his body momentarily, before they resumed their movement. “Bellatrix was hurting you and the others, and Ron and Hermione. It was like I had to
The people who chose to do the huritng, Harry reflected, did not have sleepless nights. They were haunted, just as haunted as the rest of them. Perhaps in the Days Before, he wouldn’t have understood, would have thought himself better for the choices he made. Except that he hadn’t made choices, not really. People had made choices for him – Dumbledore, Voldemort, the prophecy.
“Nothing,” he said evenly, although privately he was shocked. Shocked, mostly, to think that he had spent seven years in classes with the group of people before him and had not an inkling of what any of them were interested in. “What about you, Zabini?”
“But when you have bad dreams, it feels like he’s still here, yeah?” Blaise finished for him. Harry nodded, to which Blaise sighed.
Madame Pomfrey nodded in agreement as McGonagall spoke. “That means there are some very important rules you’ll have to follow,” Pomfrey said. “No magic, in class or outside of it for the next two weeks. No extra activities that will put any strain on your body, like quidditch,” she said with a pointed look at him. “You’ll see me every day for the next week so I can monitor your magic levels, and then every other day the week after. Once we pass the two week mark we’ll devise a new plan based on the levels of your magical stores.”
He glanced behind him quickly, tugging on his hair that was long enough now to graze his ears, although still wild as ever. He locked eyes with Draco, who gave him a nod and a small smile.
In fact, the more he looked, the more he realized that most of Slytherin had not vacated the Great Hall, especially the younger students. They seemed to all be waiting to speak with Pansy or Draco. There were even a couple young Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs waiting, although the absence of any Gryffindor students was notable. Harry felt a little bit out of his element – no,
Blaise was right – it was a stipulation of the class. They weren’t graded, per se, but they needed at least a mark of Acceptable to pass the class and they needed to pass the class to graduate. It wasn’t designed to be particularly challenging, but it was designed to be thoughtful and require participation. Honestly, Harry sort of hated himself for creating it now that his work load was so great.
“Not over the summer?” Draco asked – and in that moment he looked so vulnerable that Harry just wanted to hold him, although he guessed that that approach wouldn’t be particularly well-received.
