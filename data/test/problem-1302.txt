“I did not assault you!” Harry said laughing now
“Oh god Ron and Hermione!” he said, “They’re fine, and you don’t have to worry they’ve finally gotten together,”  Draco said and Harry gave a short laugh. Hermione, who had gone over to  Ron to hold onto him, looked up,
“Po-Potter you scared me half to death,” Draco said
They rocked together both slowly seeking their pleasure, Harry’s legs shaking from the feeling of complete belonging, he looked down at Draco.
Harry heard his breath hitch as he felt Draco’s arm around his waist, as much as the blond loved holding Harry in his arms, Harry loved how safe he felt surrounded by Draco.
His lips trailed the blonde’s body, detouring to suck and bite at Draco’s nipples, until he came to the very interested member that by now his mouth was watering for.
Draco may bear the Dark mark but he was no Deatheater. Harry placed a kiss on the offending mark causing Draco to burst into a new batch of tears,
“I want to try something,” Harry said and Draco’s curiosity was peaked. If Draco had thought that Harry hadn't taken a moment from worrying about their imminent death-by-Voldy to look into sex, well... it was a thought he wasted.
“Well we’ll have to see won’t we,” he said causing the others to turn to him and his twinkling eyes.
Only for Harry to call him on it. He had just hugged him, the Gryffindor was shocked because he finally understood what Draco was putting at risk that night they kissed.
He ran through the halls after hastily throwing on his clothes, he spared a glance out to the sky, only to realize he had spent hours just standing under the spray of the shower, he didn’t even bother to dry himself so he skidded in his damp shoes, but as the fates would have it, he fell right into Draco.
“Really…” Harry chuckled,
Harry growled and Draco sensing what he wanted, moaned and with a flick of his wand, everything on Harry’s desk flew and hit the wall. Harry attempted to give a small sound of protest but it got lost as Draco vanished his clothes, pushed him to lie on his desk and took Harry into his mouth, Harry squirmed and gasped, fingers clenching in Draco’s hair.
“But,” Draco continued, “She’s staying by father’s side, I could stand by the one I love, so will she.” He finished.  Everyone behind the screen tried to process the information they had  heard, so Malfoy and Harry had been in a relationship for god knows how  long, Malfoy’s father poisoned Harry and Malfoy’s mother saved him and  Draco was now officially on the Light side.
He quickly freed his cock and pulled Harry’s hips to the edge of his desk and eased his cock inside, knowing that was driving Harry mental.
“Ah, our answer is here.” He said, all eyes moved to a cloaked figure  making its way to Harry’s side, it looked left the right, then flicked  the hood off revealing a head of white blond.
“You love me?” Harry  asked curiously, Draco flushed, the chosen prat already knew, he just  liked teasing Draco, “Uh…that’s what mother said… I was… I just,” he sighed, ”Like you didn’t already know,” Draco said and Harry smiled, he  kissed the cheek of his blushing lover, “And I you,” Draco looked up and tilted his head to the side, “You do?” he asked and Harry smiled no  matter how many times he said it, the was always a moment when Draco  didn’t believe him,
Harry looked distastefully at him but then extended his hand, Draco contemplated batting it away but saw no other graceful way of rising off his arse, so he took it.
“Way!” Fred said and Ron scowled causing the few that were paying attention to laugh, ”Then what?” Hermione asked
“Around the third time you kissed me,”
“The same... terrifying,” Harry answered as he let himself go boneless against Draco, knowing that despite the blond's lanky limbs he had power and complete control of them.
“Let me go!!” he cried and his father placed a hand on his shoulder, he stopped fighting but his body was tense. They all looked back to the  younger Malfoy, he sighed.
He kissed Draco's neck, finding that spot easily and he ran his hands over Draco's waist, reveling in how he squirmed, it was a delight, to find out the Slytherin was ticklish.
Draco pulled nearly out then slammed back in, Harry arched off the desk and into Draco, Harry wrapped his legs around Draco, pulling him even deeper. He gripped two fistfuls of Draco’s robe, pushing up to meet every thrust, Draco’s fingers digging into Harry's hips and Harry knew he’d have bruises later, the thought sent a thrill through Harry and gasping he gripped Draco’s robe tighter groaning out words to make Draco go harder, faster, and ‘God Yes! right there!’
“Harry!” Harry stopped
Harry was glaring and quite possibly growling judging by how people stepped away from him. Then those eyes he got lost in, locked with his and he had to know.
“Touch me.” Draco said. Harry, not being one who needed to be told twice, hurriedly divested both of them of their clothes and finally put his lips on Draco’s skin.
And as they made their way to the Great Hall amongst all the destruction, they tangled their fingers together and took their first step in the life they wanted.
It was a week until the Yule Ball and Draco was pissed, ‘
“Draco wait.” Harry said but he didn’t he took one step then another,
“Oh God,” Harry gasped out after his breathing came under control and Draco chuckled,
“Kiss me,” Harry said huskily
Voldermort was back.
“Draco?” Harry asked almost uncertainly,
Harry was pissed but he misjudged how close Draco already was and then they were both chest at chest and their noses touching, they were both wide-eyed but it lasted for only a second then they were glaring daggers,
He was going to lose Harry. All he said and did at school was for show but this... -- Harry would never forgive. He had his terrible mission and his mother’s life depended on the choices he made.
“It was amazing! I saw myself standing, looking down at my body and these ugly looking creatures-”
Harry felt himself reaching his peak. Draco bit down on Harry’s shoulder and Harry felt himself being filled with Draco’s come and he clenched impossibly tight around him as his own orgasm made him see white as his come stained Draco’s once pristine Auror robes.
“Sap,” Harry said, the smile obvious in his voice.
Then he saw her talking to Harry... and he knew... Harry knew. Draco turned and stormed off, ‘No,no,no,no’ repeated over and over in his mind.
“You like that, do you? For all your fierce looks, you’re just a sweetheart at heart, aren’t you.” He cooed at the bird, and it didn’t protest. It made him wonder how much like its owner it was, and he grinned at the thought of Malfoy sitting still to be petted. But this train of thought caused a flash of heat to run through him, and he quickly stopped it in its tracks. He picked up the bird and walked into the kitchen to find it some treats as he continued to stroke and talk to it.
George nodded understandingly, and Angelina smiled slightly at him, but she didn’t really move her focus from the drunk in the doorway.
Remus looked up, surprised. He hadn’t heard Evan ask about anyone in the wizarding world, ever. This was new, and he hoped that this was a sign that the Mind-Healer was helping. Even if most had been opportunists, there had still been a small number who had been true friends, and Remus had been sorry that Harry, now Evan, had let them go along with everyone else.
“Good morning. Did you even sleep last night?” Scott asked, concerned as he saw the dark circles under his cousin’s eyes.
After breakfast, Evan went back upstairs to have a nap before his meeting with Malfoy on Scott’s orders. He would need his rest if he wanted to be alert when he saw the lawyer.
Evan was already seated and busily writing something on a notepad, a coffee cooling beside him when Draco entered the café. The singer had arrived early, it seemed, as Draco knew he was exactly on time, as always. Draco couldn’t help admiring the look of the man in jeans and a t-shirt with a leather jacket hanging off the back of the chair. Draco was practically drooling at the thought of Evan in leather.
“Yes, alright. I will make sure Hermione doesn’t come anywhere near you. Would you like me to draw up a contract to make it magically binding? Give you more protection?” Draco asked, looking up at Jamieson as he got up from his chair and walked towards the window, staring out of it. He hadn’t missed the automatic flinch at the mere mention of Hermione’s name. It made him even more curious.
“Hello, darlings. I’m sorry I’m a little late. There was some traffic on the motorway.” She said, handing out hugs to everyone until she stopped in front of Evan, “Alright, so are you going to explain what happened last night? And why you took such a sudden dislike to the lawyer?” she asked, tipping his face up to look into his face.
“Harry, mate. Good to see you. Been ages, hasn’t it?”He burbled cheerfully, a happy smile on his face.
Evan was only startled out of his creative fugue when the owl soared into the music room and settled on the chair next to his piano. He blinked uncomprehendingly at it for a few seconds. It wasn’t Remus and Tonks’ bird, so it had to be Malfoy’s. He reached out and took the letter from the bird, being careful of its sharp talons as it looked like a fierce bird and very carefully reached out to pet it. Surprisingly it moved into his touch and soaked up the affection he was giving it. Evan chuckled.
“Think about it. There were wedding robes in the window. The broom ad was of a family, which is what he said he wanted. A diamond mine…..he wants a diamond. Yup, I think he wants you to ask him to marry him. I always knew Draco was smart. This way you know he’s going to say yes and he didn’t even have to directly ask you. Brilliant.” Hermione exclaimed grinning.
Evan nodded and stood up, allowing Scott to pull him upright.
Draco mentally shook himself and shelved his questions for later. And there would definitely be a later. Now that he knew that the man in front of him was Potter, many things made so much sense about the man’s music, and it only increased his desire to know more about the man. This man who had thousands of wizards and witches worshipping him and just walked away from it to forge an entirely new path for himself, away from it all, and succeeded.
Harry met Hermione at the Leaky Cauldron hoping that showing her the clues would help them decipher what Draco wanted.
some paper and a pen and scribbled a quick reply telling Malfoy to meet him at a nearby café at noon.
“There you go. In. And out. You’re doing great, cuz. Come on. There you go.” Scott breathed encouragement, and he sat down next to his cousin and pulled him into his arms.
Draco didn’t reply, he just huffed and continued walking, ignoring any further attempts to talk until they reached the Leaky Cauldron and saw Ginny and Hermione.
He looked for Angela, who he saw with a slight wince, was actually talking to Malfoy. Cursing his bad luck mentally, he walked up and gave Malfoy a bland smile before turning to Angela. He barely spared the man a glance. Just enough to note that the blonde wizard had grown into his pointy features. He looked very fit to Evan’s admittedly biased eyes.
He had a feeling that solitude and a good bottle of firewhiskey would be what he needed to listen to the man’s music. And he was so very right.
It took years of therapy for him to get back in contact with the Lupins, and even now, they acted as a buffer between Evan and the magical world. Remus handled all of Evan’s business dealings in the wizarding world and all his money. Before Harry had run away from the wizarding world, he had transferred all the Black accounts and vaults into Teddy’s name, with Tonks acting as regent until Teddy was of age and given Remus the regency over the House of Potter. Harry had then converted as much money as he could comfortably carry and left with all his most precious belongings shrunk in his pocket and never looked back.
He put the file he had brought with him down on the table as Evan started and looked up. The singer had been lost in his own world working on the song he had started last night.
“I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, swear on my magic to never reveal in any way Evan Jamieson’s birth name to anyone without his express permission,” Draco said, his wand in his hand lighting up as the vow settled. “Will that do?” he asked, half-angry and half-curious.
“So, Po – Jamieson, if you don’t mind me asking, how did you get into music? I don’t remember you being musical in school.” Draco asked hesitantly. He wasn’t sure how the other man would react to his bringing up the past.
Draco nodded and took the offered hand, and the other man nodded almost to himself and walked out. Both men had to suppress their surprise at the jolt that ran through them at the touch.
Making friends with the girl and figuring out she was just as lonely as he was without her two friends. Both boys had seemingly disappeared, Weasley into his grief and his family and the Golden Boy to parts unknown. Not even Hermione, for she was definitely Hermione now, knew where Potter had fucked off to. Nobody had heard from him in years, and as far as Draco knew, only his godson, Teddy, got birthday and Christmas presents from him.
Evan grinned at him, “Now there’s the Draco Malfoy I remember.”
Draco continued to listen as the song wound down. The singer hummed the last notes, his eyes closed as if he was singing to himself, and the audience didn’t matter. Draco was intrigued by that. Most singers performed for the audience. This man sang for himself first, it seemed, and for some reason, it was even more attractive to his audience. The kind of music, the lyrics were again more typical of rock bands than crooners, so this man was again not ordinary in any way it seemed.
Evan made his way downstairs as he gave up on going back to sleep. He made himself some tea and activated the silencing charms around the music room as he went in. If the past was going to haunt him, he would use it to write new music, he thought as he sat down at his piano and ran his fingers over the keys aimlessly.
I Have Questions by Camila Cabello
“Can someone explain to me why the fuck I am awake this early in the fucking morning?” She cursed, taking a cup of coffee from Scott with a grateful look.
It brought back the madness and fear from his sixth year with the doomed mission Voldemort had given him and Potter stalking his every step. Draco was more sure than ever that he would have to meet the man. He needed to know who this man was who could so easily see into his very soul. It shouldn’t be too much of an issue since he had VIP passes to the after-party. He was very sure he would get to meet the singer there. He would make sure of it. Being a lawyer specializing in entertainment contracts definitely had some perks. Draco smirked to himself as he lost himself in the rest of the music. It was a wonderfully smooth, deep voice that caressed the notes and blended beautifully with the lyrics, and Draco had no doubts that the songs had been written by the singer and no other. He found himself shuddering with arousal as that beautiful voice seemed to caress his very soul.
talk to me about Hermione bloody Granger. Bitch knows exactly what she did. If she gave you some sob story, then I can guarantee you it’s not true. She’s truly Dumbledore’s heir. Manipulative bitch.” Evan spat, incensed at the mention of his former friend. “In fact, I’m surprised she isn’t a Weasley by now. Perfectly suited as they were. Or is she dragging that out too, stringing him along as she does everyone?” he continued.
“I read somewhere that herons are representatives of transformation and renewal. You’ve certainly done that.” Ridley pointed out, and Evan nodded, pleased to have this proof that his efforts to grow and change, even if he did miss the stag that used to represent his father.
“I- I wasn’t ready. I hate it. So much. The magical world has taken so much from me. I never really want to talk about it. I couldn’t even talk about it to my therapist because of the Statute of Secrecy. That means only family gets to know about magic. You’re my family, so I can tell you. Telling anyone else would be illegal, and if I was found out, it wouldn’t be pretty.” Evan shrugged a little.
“If you pay close attention over the next few weeks then you will know my love. But you have to pay attention. Think you are upto the challenge, Santa baby?” Draco asked even as he moved his arse to better accommodate Harry’s hard cock and started rutting against him.
“Hey, hey, now. I’m here. We can deal with this. Now tell me five things you can see.” Scott said, rubbing a hand soothingly on Evan’s back.
Evan just froze in shock for a second before he caught up and wrapped his own arms around the redhead. When they pulled apart, there was a relieved smile on the singer’s face.
“Draco, then. And yes. I wouldn’t have asked if I didn’t want to know.” Draco drawled sarcastically.
“I go by Evan Jamieson now. My cousin, you remember him? Dudley? Well, when he cut ties with his parents, he came to live with me, and we, both of us, changed our names to cut all ties with our past. Mine is changed in the Wizarding world as well. Remus is actually now Regent for the Jamieson accounts, not Potter.” Evan answered, his smile a little strained as he spoke of what had finally driven him from the Wizarding world and how he had first survived and then thrived in the Muggle world.
“Yeah, but by that point, neither of us wanted anything to do with the abusive arseholes who are his parents. So when he cut all ties, I had already cut ties; just before my seventeenth birthday, he decided to change his name to reflect the family he chose to claim. Me.” Evan answered.
“So, Remus, how is George Weasely these days?” Evan asked, fidgeting with a quill as he spoke and avoiding meeting the other man’s eyes.
“I get that, but when you contacted the Lupins. They are magical, right?” Ryan pressed, and Evan nodded, “Yeah, then, why didn’t you tell us then?” Ryan pressed on.
“Just like that? A few lessons and you’re writing your own music?” Draco asked sceptically.
“Of course. Evan, I wanted you to meet Mr. Malfoy here. Mr. Malfoy, Evan Jamieson.” Angela said, pulling on  Evan’s arm lightly to include him in the conversation, much to Evan’s consternation.
He was just glad he hadn’t lost any of his family over this. He had hoped at one time to integrate both worlds he lived in, but he wasn’t sure he wanted to any more. The magical world hadn’t brought him anything but trouble in all the years he’d lived there. But maybe it was time to give it a second chance. It was something to think about.
Harry was woken up by his boyfriend bouncing up onto his bed. He sighed and pretended to still be asleep. The previous day had been long and boring and it was the weekend dammit, he would sleep-in if he wanted.
Draco opened it and gasped at the sight.
“Don’t be a stranger, alright? I don’t want to wait another twelve years before I see you again. And I’m sure Angie would love to see you again. And you have to meet the kids. They need to meet their Uncle Harry…Evan.” George babbled as he squeezed the breath from Evan.
The song brought back memories of long nights struggling with nightmares and terrified of who would attack his family next despite their being exonerated by the Golden Boy himself. He remembered struggling to finish his eighth year amidst the hostility from everyone around him at Hogwarts. The surprising absence of two-thirds of the Golden Trio.
“So you all know that I was born Harry James Potter?” Evan began and told the story of his life, explaining that he was a wizard. Had been born that way to magical parents. He explained how he had lost his parents and gone to live with Scott’s parents. Scott cut in here and explained the years of abuse and lies that had been heaped on Evan, looking slightly guilty about his part in the abuse. But Evan squeezed his hand in reassurance, and he smiled back at his cousin.
The song in this chapter is
It had been a fairly busy and cramped six months of four people sharing a flat meant for two people. If not for Harry’s surreptitious use of magic, they would never have been able to fit. But at the end of it, Dudley had managed to get a place at uni to study psychology despite his dismal record at Smeltings, and Harry was halfway through his studies for his GCSE and had been promoted to wait-staff at
Draco huffed and mumbled something about oblivious Gryffindors under his breath before turning the page and continuing the conversation as though nothing had happened.
“Indeed. What an honour. I shall do my best to fulfil your every wish my fiend. So what is it your heart desires?” Harry asked yawning and stretching his hips rolling up into Draco’s creating a pleasant friction against his morning wood.
“What can I say? I’m just that good.” Evan answered, smirking, but when the blonde just continued to look at him, he caved, “Ok, so maybe it was a little more than a few. I took a course in music and music appreciation in night school as part of my GCSE degree.” He felt alive in a way he never had before, just talking to the blonde in front of him. He wasn’t sure what it said about him that the person who made him feel this way was someone he used to hate, in another life.
“I can do most of it if you want. You just need to provide them with proof. You are getting better with the actual magic these days. With the visits from Teddy and the Lupins.” Scott said slowly.
He could almost feel Malfoy’s smirk; he didn’t need to look. So he focused on Angela’s introductions. Evan just waved a hand rather than touch the blonde man as he wasn’t really in the mood to pull in his magic at that point. Once she had done the needful, she left them alone with a speaking glance at Evan, which he returned with reassurance.
“See something you like, love? Something you want Santa to get for you?” Harry asked pressing a kiss to the back of Draco’s neck.
“Fine. You sleep I’ll go see what Santa has brought us by myself, shall I? Don’t blame me if some of your presents are opened as well.” He grumped as he made his way downstairs.
Evan sighed and got out of bed. He was glad that his room had permanent silencing charms so he wouldn’t wake his cousin with his nightmares. It was enough that one of them was losing sleep. They didn’t need to share that as well. Especially as Scott had a job that required him to be alert and awake all day as opposed to Evan, who didn’t have anything on his schedule other than writing new music for the next couple of weeks.
“Hello. Been waiting long?” Draco asked as he sat down opposite the brunette, unbuttoning his jacket as he got comfortable.
“Morning all. Evan, what is it you wished to tell us?” She asked, taking the coffee from Scott and pressing a kiss to his stubbled cheek.
The two of them quickly ordered lunch and settled in to sip their coffees as they waited.
Hermione hummed and looked back at the display turning over the clues in her head until she finally broke into a grin.
“Yes. I’m sure. Question is are you sure you want to marry Draco?” Hermione replied.
Evan pulled all his magic into his skin. With a tight control on his magic, so the other wizard couldn’t sense it, he reached out and shook the blonde wizard’s hand, giving him a tight smile. He barely touched the blonde before pulling his hand away.
Harry, who was used to Molly Weasley’s heavy-handed mothering, was quite unused to Mama Jem’s less intrusive brand, but he appreciated it nonetheless. The twins had taken him home that night, given him a place on the sofa of their two-bedroom flat, and Mama Jem had offered him a job as a dishwasher. Mama Jem had also encouraged him and supported him in getting his GCSE so he could get a better job later. It had been at her prompting that he had even written to Petunia for his official documents and led to Dudley turning up on their doorstep, bag and baggage. This led to the two of them sharing the sofa at the twins flat until they had both earned enough from the various odd jobs to get a flat of their own.
It would do to be going on with. One demon confronted per day was enough. Now it was time to go home and find his joy again.
“Y’know, for someone who is so against publicity, you sure picked a terrible career.” Scott joked, smirking at Evan as he joined them in the kitchen where Evan had been stacking the dishwasher.
Harry looked at him quizzically but when he showed no sign of saying more he pushed it to the back of his mind to puzzle over. Did Draco want to spend Christmas with his parents again? It would be really hard to arrange with Lucius in Azkaban but not impossible. But that didn’t sound right either, Draco had not been interested in ever visiting his father in all the years that he had been in prison so why now? Nothing made sense but maybe Draco would give him some more clues to work with. Harry really wanted to get this right for his love.
“And you can help me tell the story if it gets too much for me. What you know of it anyway. Maybe I
“Yes, yes it is.” He sighed smiling down at his boyfriend as he swallowed hard to get rid of the lump that had formed in his throat.
“I know I’m technically not supposed to, but I’ve been helping Evan with his PTSD and panic attacks since he stopped visiting the therapist. I guess she took him about as far as she could dealing with the abuse. Now, unless I can find someone who is in the know about the magical world, which Evan still doesn’t want, I’m going to be helping him the rest of the way. He’s come a long way, even being able to talk about the past without a panic attack.” Scott said, still rubbing Evan’s shoulder comfortingly. Evan threw him a grateful look.
(See the end of the chapter for
George listened quietly, sympathy evident in his face as he listened to Evan. It didn’t stop him from teasing the brunet about not being able to help being famous, whether he was in the Wizarding world or the muggle one. Evan just laughed and took the good-natured teasing with relief. He was so glad that George hadn’t been mad at him for his long silence or for not wanting any contact with the rest of the Weasleys.
Evan fidgeted nervously as he waited in Angela’s office, calming when she threw an exasperated glance his way. He knew she would protect him if need be, and he could defend himself; he knew that he probably had nothing to worry about, but still, he couldn’t help himself. Finally, there was a knock on the door, and Angela’s assistant announced Malfoy.
Sending numerous applications for apprenticeships and being rejected repeatedly until surprisingly, Hermione Granger had helped him out by pointing out that if the magical world wouldn’t accept him, then maybe the muggle one would. Studying along with Hermione and getting accepted into the law program with the Gryffindor brainiac. Finishing muggle Law school and apprenticing with law offices in the wizarding world later to learn magical law again along with Granger.
Remus also seemed to think that Malfoy might be amenable to an Unbreakable or Wizard’s vow to keep Evan’s identity a secret if it meant a new client. The firm was very big on client confidentiality apparently and thriving from all accounts. So Evan reluctantly agreed to meet with Malfoy in Angela’s office. There was no way he was inviting the man into his home.
“Don’t give me that look, young man. I’m sure this will be relatively painless. Come along now.” She said as she made her way to the first group of record execs.

“He must be something really special for you to break your own rules against fraternisation with clients,” Hermione remarked, raising an eyebrow.
Draco passed out on his couch, still listening to that wonderful voice. When he woke up, the CD was still playing on a loop, one of his favourites. Something that spoke to the hope he finally had that things might get better now with a little help from the new friends he had made, since the old ones had abandoned him in the wake of the war.
Evan came up to receive his hug as well. If he held on a little tighter and a little longer, Jemima wouldn't mention it. She just held him back and pressed a kiss to his forehead. She looked up into his face and frowned at what she saw there.
Evan waved back, a grin spreading across his face as he watched the blonde walk away. He really had to admire the blonde’s arse in that suit. It really showed it off to perfection. He had a date.

“It’s platinum but the inlay is made from the wand woods of our wands,” Harry said as he stayed kneeling looking up at his love.
“I…umm..there’s something I need to tell you all,” Evan said slowly as Ryan wandered in, still looking half-asleep. It made Evan wonder how the other man had managed to drive there while still asleep. Luckily it wasn’t too far, but still.
“Is that from your new lawyer boyfriend?” Scott teased, and Evan balled up a blank piece of paper and threw it at him. He dodged easily and laughed along with his cousin.
Scott nodded, “Like glue.” He asserted, and with one last nod to himself, Evan straightened his spine and walked forward and stepped through the door to go back to the party.
“Y-your hand, th-the floor, w-wall, sh-shoes p-pinch.” Evan gasped, and Scott choked out a chuckle at that. Evan always,
“Mmmm, anyway, since mum is in France and Lucius is in Azkaban you, my perfect boyfriend have been elected to play Santa for me this year,” Draco said sitting up and resting his weight on Harry’s hips.
“I think I’ll be fine. It was just the shock of seeing him after all these years and in such a place. I could even deal with meeting Malfoy, I think. Just -just stick close, alright?” Evan asked, throwing his cousin an uncertain glance.
“Potter.” Draco gasped in shock. He had wondered where Potter had gone, but he had never imagined this. The man looked so different. Even without the glamour, only those bright green eyes and the scar were the same. And even the scar was a pale, faded version of what it had been when Draco had seen it daily across the Great Hall.
Harry smiled despite himself. This childish side of his lover was always endearing and amusing, even if it was too early in the morning to be dealing with it. Sometimes he thought he got both a kid and a boyfriend in one when he moved in with Draco. He pulled the blonde into a tender kiss before pulling away and ruffling his lover’s soft wavy blond locks.
“Now, what have you done?” She asked, fondness in her voice unmistakable as she eyed Evan until he took his hat off and met her pretty brown eyes, “Harry!” she exclaimed in surprise.
“I-I saw bl-blonde hair,” Evan said between sobs.
“Don’t worry so, love. I’m sure it’s not as bad as all that.” She said, smoothing a hand through his messy hair. “Unless you’re sick? Are you sick?” She asked, pulling back a little to study his face.
Scott watched him partly concerned and partly puzzled by his cousin’s behaviour.
He listened, his glass of firewhiskey untouched beside him and reminisced. He had worked through his issues with years of mind-healing and therapy, but somehow this smooth, melodious voice helped soothe his soul so much better than anything else ever had. Draco knew there was no way he would give up on getting to know the man. If not a lover, he would settle for just friendship, but he had to be honest with himself. He desperately wanted this man, this wonderful human who could so easily see inside his darkness and pull him back into the light with just his music.
“Y-you. M-mirror. Ch-chair. T-table… f-flowers, a-and sh-shoes.” Evan managed to gasp out. The soothing motion of Scott’s hand on his back, helping him focus a little.
Brooms for the whole family was what the tag said and it showed a picture of a family of four, mom and dad and two kids on brooms happily tossing the Quaffle around.
“Th-thanks.” Evan managed as he tried to stop crying, now that he could breathe again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was upset. He knew that Draco had given him plenty of clues. But he just couldn’t figure it out. Why was he having so much trouble with this thing? He knew Draco better than anyone else, at least he thought he did. So why was this so difficult. He really didn’t want to be the reason Draco was disappointed on Christmas day. Harry sighed and decided to talk to Hermione. Maybe she would know what Draco was hinting at.
“Can I ask? What brought this on? You’ve been doing so well lately.” Scott prodded gently.
“She never said a word about you or the Weasel. She doesn’t talk about herself much.” Draco admitted hoping it would get Jamieson to reveal something.
“Hey, George. How’ve you been?”Evan asked with a small smile, even if it was still weird to him to see just George without Fred by his side.
Evan smiled wryly at her and shook his head. “It’s not as bad as all that. But you might be mad at me for keeping this a secret all this time.” He said softly
“Yes, I think that will be just fine. I appreciate it.” Evan said, turning around and smiling slightly at the blonde. He looked down at the amulet still in his hands and absently put it on, not noticing the look of disappointment on Draco’s face as his eyes changed colour.
“You weren’t broken, Ev. Just a little lost. And you becoming who you are now is all you. We just nudged you a little in the right direction.” Ryan said, pulling Evan into a hug.
“Oh, you mean the lawyer guy? Why would he bother you?” Scott asked, puzzled.
Scott walked into the room, took one look at Evan and patted him on the back. He shared the house with Evan and had gotten up early to get breakfast for everyone together, knowing Evan would be quite useless until everything was settled.
“Evan, you’re not making any sense.” He said slowly.
Scott nodded; tomorrow was soon enough.
“You know, you could always get him to swear a magical vow of some kind if you need to. There’s something like that, right?” Scott pointed out as he leaned on the counter next to Evan.
They spent a couple of hours together, catching up and laughing together companionably. George even teased the brunet about his previous obsession with Draco when Evan finally admitted to living with the blond now. Evan retaliated by teasing George about now having to try disciplining his own kids, who were, according to him, just as bad as he and Fred had been in their day.
Evan nodded and rested his head on his cousin’s shoulder. “I’ll think about it. And talk to Remus about the firm’s reputation in the wizarding world and everything.” He agreed tiredly.
“Of course not. Evan Jamieson has never been into the whole drinking and drugs scene. He’s not like everyone else. If you’ll excuse me. I should see to my other guests.” She snapped and stormed off, leaving Draco to sigh and regret letting his mouth run away from him.
Evan smiled back, relieved. That settled, they packed away their business, and Evan brought out some tea which they shared while catching up on each other’s lives and Teddy’s exploits at Hogwarts.
“Yes. I think I might like that,” Evan said before looking up sharply. “But you will explain about Ron and Ginny and Molly to him, won’t you?”
“It’s fine, Ms Linton. I understand. Musicians. Too much drink or drugs?” Draco returned derisively. He knew he had made a mistake when he saw the protective light of battle ignite in the woman’s eyes.
For all his preparations, he had been completely unprepared for life in the muggle world. He had no ID and no degree. He had no way of even finding a proper job in the muggle world, and so six months after he had run away with his money rapidly running out and yet unwilling to admit defeat and contact Remus for more, he had run into the twins, Ridley and Ryan Jenkins.
“Mmmm yes…Draco…unghhh.Right there. Of course. Your wish is my command, love.” Harry gasped out between moans as they lost themselves in each other.
Head Above Water by Avril Lavigne
“Well, not really. I mean, I have a bad history with both of them. Granger, who I assume is Hermione Granger, used to be my best friend. I used to trust her until she betrayed me and proved she was just like everyone else. Always wanting something from me. Malfoy, on the other hand, I’ve forgiven. He was a prat, but if he’s willingly working with non-magical people now, then I could work with him. But definitely not Granger. Malfoy and me, we were kids. He made a lot of mistakes, but he wasn’t really responsible for them, and he seems to have turned his life around.” Evan shrugged at the end.
“Hmm, mayyyybe. It’s a clue anyway.” Draco said turning in Harry’s arms to press a chaste kiss to his lover’s lips.
“Hey, Angelina.” Evan said, smiling a little sheepishly, “I take it, George didn’t tell you he was meeting me for lunch today?” he asked unhesitatingly, throwing Groege under the bus.
“Alright, I’ll go with you.” He said, conjuring a hat and jamming it on his head to hide his scar and eyes as best he could.
“Oh, I know. I just never thought you’d admit it out loud.” Scott teased, ruffling Evan’s messy dark hair that was currently unbound and curling every which way despite its length. It seemed that even growing it long didn’t really tame the messiness unless it was bound back in a ponytail.
“Very good. Now come on. Breathe with me. In through your nose.” Scott said encouragingly. “And out through your mouth. There you go. That’s it.”
“I’ve had a couple of messages from the Malfoy bloke. He seems persistent.” She said without preamble, and Evan sighed. He should have expected it. Malfoy had never been one to just let go of things. “Are you sure you won’t work with him? What if we can make sure you only work with him and not his partner?”
Evan was nervous. He knew he probably shouldn’t have kept his secret for so long and definitely not from his family, but he honestly hadn’t been ready to even acknowledge that side of his heritage. He had just wanted to forget all about the British Wizarding world, except for his godson and his family. He sighed. There was nothing for it but to just tell them all, at the same time.

Shaking her head at her best friends obliviousness Hermione smiled.
. He-he wants to marry me? You really think so?” He asked his voice rising into a squeak in his excitement.
He made it to their living room just as the blonde man was pulling the ring box out of the stocking a look of awe on his face.
“I usually don’t, but in your case, I’m willing to make an exception.” Draco drawled, smirking at the singer.
“You guys are my family. If I can’t tell you, then who can I tell?” Evan asked rhetorically, shaking his head, “No, the problem is going to be getting through the telling without another panic attack.” He sighed again and rested his head against his cousin’s shoulder.
Evan tried to regulate his breathing gasping out sobs every few breaths.
“So, anyway. My therapist had the idea that I should write about my traumas. It ended up being poetry.” Evan said, shrugging as Draco raised an eyebrow. “Then Scott saw it one day and suggested that I put it to music. I hadn’t the first clue about how to write music. But it sounded interesting and very different from anything I’d ever done before. So I took a few music lessons and voice lessons. The rest, as they say, is history.” Evan finished and smirked at the blonde.
“So, umm, why keep it a secret for so long?” Ryan asked softly, uncertainly. He looked slightly hurt, and Evan rushed to reassure him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry had been sleeping rough, although his magic made it much more comfortable than would be expected, and he even missed the tent that they had used during the previous year. He was still warm and dry, if a little scruffy and hungry. He had been trying to find a place to sleep for the night outside a restaurant, believing that it was empty when the twins had seen him and believing him homeless and destitute had dragged him into the restaurant and fed him. That was where he had met mama Jem as well.
“Not quite. But maybe soon?” Draco answered with a smile, still humming under his breath.
Harry and Draco were strolling through Diagon Alley window shopping on their way to meet with Ginny and Hermione for lunch when Harry noticed Draco seemed to be absorbed in the display of Twilfitt and Tattings. He moved closer and wrapped his arms around the blonde’s waist.
“Coffee. Please.” Ryan groaned, his brown hair sticking up every which way as he had clearly just rolled out of bed. Scott came forward and handed the extremely grateful man a cup of coffee and ruffled his hair before going back to get another cup as Mama Jem walked in, as pristine as if she had been up for hours, and she probably had, visiting the market to source fresh produce for her restaurant.
“Move,” Evan said as he picked up his hat and placed it on his head, glaring daggers at the drunken redhead as he stood toe-to-toe with him. The force of his glare seemed to scare Ron a little, and he backed off.
“You’ve never been my friend Ronald Weasley. I wanted nothing to do with you then, and I want nothing to do with a failure of a human being like you, ever.” Evan spat, his faked calm crumbling under Ron’s obviously drunken anger. “George, Angie, I’m sorry I have to cut this short. But I think I should leave before I do something I will regret.” Evan said, turning to the other two.
And that was the truth as he saw it; he was more himself now than he had been then. A reality that was what he needed to see, to remind himself of so he could sleep again without nightmares. He worked on his new tune so lost in his music that he didn’t notice when Scott came downstairs and started making breakfast or when he let in a large eagle owl carrying a missive.
Evan was just finishing up his quarterly meeting with Remus about his business in the Wizarding World, including any business in the Wizengamot, and trying to procrastinate before he brought up something that he had been meaning to ask the older man for a while now.
“Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? If you’ll excuse us.” Evan said, focusing on his manager and friend while also giving the other wizard a meaningless smile.
“I, um, don’t know. I’d have to ask Remus. I haven’t really kept up with magic much, as you can see. You really think green is better?” Evan asked, flushing a little in embarrassment at the appraisal, before turning back to Mama Jem, who had been quietly listening to them talk. “Mama Jem?” he asked.
“Yes?” Draco prodded. He wished the man would just get on with it already. All this fidgeting was getting on his nerves.
Draco sat back in his chair, silvery eyes thoughtful as he wondered if there wasn’t some type of magic involved as every time he thought he was close, he got diverted. He hummed to himself and decided to let it go for now. He would delve into it a bit more once he had had his first proper meeting with the man. Sighing, he brought up his other clients files to work on some contracts for some of his other very temperamental clients and decided to let Evan Jamieson be for the moment.
“Thanks,” Evan said, relaxing against the blonde man. He could take a few more minutes to relax with his cousin. “So, how bad is it out there? Who does Angela want me to impress today?” he asked after a few minutes of comfortable silence.
“I get it, ok. I get why you didn’t say anything. It just stings a little that there was so much about you that we never knew.” Ryan said, sighing a little.
, Mama Jem’s place. They had also no longer been Harry and Dudley but Evan and Scott, which had been almost a relief for both of them.
The new edition of Quidditch weekly had just come out and both men were poring over it together discussing the various teams and their chances when Draco stopped on the page advertising the new line of Cleansweeps.
“Yes, of course. I’ll make your excuses. And you will explain everything tomorrow. I’ll be by for breakfast.” Angela said steel in her eyes. “God knows, being your manager for all these years, I’ve learned some very creative excuses for your absences.” She muttered as she shooed Evan and Scott away.
If Jamieson could forgive him, with his dark past, and trust him enough to reveal himself, then what must Hermione have done to the man to cause this much anger? He could admit to himself that the woman kept herself separate even after all these years of working together, so he didn’t really know as much as he would have liked. He would wait and see.
“Oh, too good for the likes of me now, are you? The great Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding world. Hah.” Ron snorted
He quickly shifted through his schedule and sent an email to Jamieson’s agent, requesting a meeting with the man. Then finally, he went back to his research into the man. Surprisingly or maybe not so surprisingly, he found nothing about the man except that Evan Jamieson was not his birth name, and the name had been changed about ten years ago. What was really surprising was that the man’s birth name had been hidden from everyone, and there was no way to discover what it was or anything about the man from before he had changed his name. Someone had done a very thorough job of erasing Jamieson’s identity prior to June of  1999.
As he searched, his eyes locked on a blond head, a blonde of a colour he had hoped never to see again, and Evan froze in place. He could barely breathe; his heart was pounding loudly in his ears. He couldn’t see, he could barely think, his palms were sweating, and he knew he would start shaking any minute. Evan didn’t know what he said to the exec he had been talking to or how he managed to get away, but he somehow found himself sunk to the floor with his head between his knees in his dressing room, trying to catch his breath. He was shaking, and there were tears running down his cheeks, not that he noticed, but that was how Scott found him sometime later.
Evan nodded. He hadn’t been sure how he would handle this meeting and hadn’t scheduled anything else for the rest of the day.
It had taken many, many days and trips to different stores for Harry to find the perfect ring and even then he had had to get it custom made based on an idea that had been sparked by a conversation with Luna. He really hoped Draco would like it.
“We were such little shits, weren’t we? Me more than you, but still.” Scott said, laughing as he stood up. Evan was fine now if he was making jokes about their childhood. He would be just fine.
Harry started smiling as well.
“So, how are you going to explain it to Angela?” Scott asked, his arm still around Evan’s shoulder.
“Of course. It was in your paperwork that Angela sent over yesterday.” Draco answered.
They had a delightful breakfast with Scott teasing Evan about his new boyfriend and Evan deflecting by teasing Scott about the new hire at his agency that Scott fancied. It was something they had never gotten to do as teenagers, and they both relished these opportunities.
Evan was exhausted. He always was after these shows. He loved singing to an audience and feeling their acceptance of him and his music, but he could really do without the after-party and all the brownnosing and arse-kissing that went on there. He sighed softly and reminded himself once again that he was Evan Jamieson and not Harry Potter anymore. With the permanent glamour, he wore there was nobody who would ever recognise him as such and drag him back to the life he had fled at eighteen. He had made something of himself without the help of his relatives or the magical world. He had done this, and he could go out there and face all those people who probably genuinely loved his music and wanted to meet him.
“Oh, but you are gorgeous, aren’t you. Those green eyes really do suit you better than the blue. Not that the blue is any less gorgeous, but the green really suits you. Couldn’t I convince you to go without the glamour then? Or maybe adjust it just a bit, so the eye colour stays the same. We can tell your fans you got contacts?” Angela asked, coming forward and tilting his face one way and another.
“No, he didn’t,” she said, giving George a look that said he had better explain himself. She turned, and her expression softened as she smiled at Evan, “Come, sit, tell me everything.” She invited, and Evan gladly took a seat gesturing to George to go first.
“You know where I live?” Evan asked, surprised.

Purpose For Pain - Scott Stapp
“Communication is key,” she continued. “Breaking patterns is difficult, but it can be done. You will be essentially reconfiguring a lifetime of behavioural patterns, Harry.”
“Okay,” Harry said. “More time is fine. It’s—more than fine, I wasn’t—I didn’t mean that I wanted—I’m asexual,” he blurted. His heart skipped a beat or two, suddenly terrified at having said it out loud. “Or at least I think so.”
“Okay, seriously, what the hell is wrong?”
“You don’t think Harry gets enough publicity as is?” Pansy commented, in that sharp tone of hers. Harry had learned by now that this was Pansy’s normal state of being; this was a casual remark, not criticism or tart commentary.
“Yeah,” Harry said, throat dry.
“The daycare?”
“That’s great news!” He got out of his chair to give them hugs, pushing down the sudden bout of jealousy and hurt. “That’s wonderful.” Ron was tearing up, so Harry thumped him on the back. Hermione he gave a tight hug and a kiss on the temple. He could be—he

Harry Apparated home.
“Go on, then,” Draco said, nodding towards the kids. Harry detected no change in his face, except for a pleased draw of his mouth. “Prove it.”
“Not yet. Probably this weekend,” Harry said. “Maybe tonight, if I skip the pub. Or you could come with me to the pub—it’s a standing invitation.”
Harry thought about it. Scary, he thought. Nerve-wracking. “Exhilarating,” he said, his mouth turning up into a smile.
His colleagues, being trained archivists, usually had a number of tasks they could do to while away the time at the front desk on slow days, but Harry wasn’t a trained archivist. He had no formal qualifications to speak of, but he could retrieve documents and shelve them again, and he was semi-officially in charge of dealing with incoming owls. Sometimes they brought research questions, sometimes stacks of papers some kind soul wanted to donate to the Archive for posterity (according to Mildred and Laura, most of the time donated documents were actually worthless and thus wound up in the incinerator instead of in the archives), sometimes fanmail to Harry. Sometimes he got to help catalogue small collections, but most of the time he was here, helping patrons.
He dipped a spring roll into the peanut-soy sauce that’d come with their order. He took good care to dunk it so he could get as much peanut crunch as possible. “Malfoy came to the Archive,” he said, inspecting the spring roll. He took a bite.
Harry looked over at the empty chair, then at the table Peony and her girlfriend had occupied, and then at Draco. “Go read your book,” he eventually said. Now that he was here, he wasn’t sure he wanted Draco—or anyone else, really—to listen in on, or be part of, whatever conversation was about to happen. But he did want Draco nearby; he wanted to know that somebody he trusted was within easy reach.
“Yeah thanks,” Harry snapped, furious now, and using that fury to suppress the tears. “I fucking loved you, but that wasn’t enough! It was like—you just wanted more and more from me, but you never fucking wanted to give me anything in return!”
, and there’s nothing I want less right then, and I think about just getting it over with, but I don’t want the sex hangover that comes with it, but then I’m scared about what it’ll mean for us in the long run, so I want to, but I don’t want to—” Harry stopped then, suddenly empty for words. “I—” he put his face in his hands. “Honestly, I feel like I’ve gone round the bend,” he eventually added, speaking into his palms instead of looking at Gladys, aware that his gut felt kind of full and his chest warm, as if he hadn’t been pouring words out, but in.
“Anything. Come to the pub with me tonight. Have dinner at my place. Bookstore. A picnic. I don’t care, I just, I want to do things. See you in the mornings. Hang out with your friends. All those things.”
“I think,” Harry said, dropping into a crouch so he could get on eye level with the kids, “that somebody has been teasing these broomsticks, and now they’re too embarrassed to fly.”
“That’s a very personal question, Potter.”
He said something to Albert and then left. All the patrons had left, and all Harry had to do was the little closing up things, and then he could go home, only nobody was home.
“Haven’t seen one of those before?” Harry whispered.
. The words had burned themselves into Harry’s brain and wouldn’t leave. Had Ginny really been that unhappy with him that…it’d come to this?
“All right.” Harry cast about until he found Avery, hovering nearby. The look of guilt on his face matched Charlie’s to the letter. “Avery.”
What would happen if Harry said no? Would Draco leave? Would he be annoyed, angry, disappointed? Would they fight? What if he just said yes, got it over with, and avoided the whole debacle—it had to happen
to go see Dudl-
“That’s all,” Harry said, pushing the trolley behind the desk. “I’ll see you later?”
Harry shook his head, even though maybe he did want a moment. However, moving on, distracting himself, seemed like the better option.
“Er,” Malfoy said. He glanced at the notebook, then at Harry. “You could just ask?”
Ron looked mildly terrified. “Hungry kids explode, got it,” he said. “Thanks for the warning.”
“Looks like your Keeper did an excellent job,” Harry said to Charlie on his way out, gently bumping their fists together.
She stared at him. “You…quit?”
Malfoy shrugged. “That’s your choice. What you’ll do with the place.”
There was no dower house in sight. Harry didn't know much about what kind of house it was, or what they looked like (if they had any particular look at all), or where they were typically situated, but Draco had said they were for a widow to move into once her eldest son inherited the estate, and that she’d usually have a full retinue of servants as well as other family members or friends living with her. That sounded like it’d be a sizeable house, but…there was no other house in sight.
“Well, are you going to kiss me then?” Harry interjected. “Or do I have to do that, too?”
“I’m sorry,” he said, suddenly just exhausted. The lump was back.
“A galaxy one?” Malfoy’s eyes were positively sparkling.
“I don’t expect you to accept my apology,” Peony went on when Harry didn’t respond. “And you have no obligation to. I just wanted you to know that. And that I’m sorry.”
“Oh. You do.”
“I finished the robots book,” Harry said, a few bites into his meal.
Malfoy had raised an eyebrow. “
“Don’t fucking touch me.” Harry kept himself out of reach, but finally took the kettle off the heat. He filled the mugs, dumping in the teabags with little care, and thrust one mug at her.
“Sometimes. I think Mum realised if she wasn’t going to accept me, she’d lose me forever. I think she does love me, but just…fails, as a parent and a human being.” Peony shrugged. “But I…I can’t trust her, not after everything. I should’ve known that sooner, given how she treated you, and you’re the closest family I have that isn’t my parents.”
“It’s not the same thing, I agree,” Peony eventually said. “But my parents were emotionally negligent towards me. It was just in a different way. They’d throw money and stuff at me to keep me happy—quiet, essentially. So long as I was quiet, they could pretend everything was normal. So long as I remained their perfect little son, everything was fine. I learned pretty early on that I could never rely on them to…
“You three.” Harry turned to Charlie, Alice, and Avery. “If I give you a Quaffle will you go outside and play nice?”
Malfoy’s mouth turned the wry smile into a bitter one. “Well, exactly. Charitable giving was and is still a thing, but…when the charitable giving has a hidden agenda—
, according to Ron. But Harry didn’t know where Draco lived, which was a pretty weird thing not to know about one’s boyfriend.
“Well…you can do it anyway?” Draco shrugged. “It’ll be neat either way. But I’m rooting for you to win, you know.”
No, there had been instances other than that, later. A few words at a party or other, those Pansy had put on after the trials (and after she got out of prison), the ones that started out as blind drinking and dancing to forget, that turned into drinking to talk, that turned into canapés and Muggle movies and friends. Malfoy had been there, but now Harry didn’t know if he’d spoken to him at length, if at all, or if all their interactions had been filtered through alcohol and semi-annoyed tolerance. Pansy had stopped throwing those get-togethers a long time ago.
. And then they write stories about them too? All kinds of stories, stories where robots take over the world, or stories where robots are servants, or…or anything, really. It’d be like if wizardfolk wrote stories about talking teacups becoming supreme overlords, you know?”
On Monday, Harry went directly to the Archive from the daycare, partially because he hoped he would run into Malfoy while still off the clock, partially because he had some tax paperwork to fill out, and partially because his standing lunch arrangement with Ron and Hermione had been cancelled: they had an appointment at St Mungo’s for a scan.
The parents disentangled themselves and soon all twelve kids were gazing up at him and positively vibrating with excitement.
Harry had been distracted throughout Thursday’s Little League training, the distraction only getting worse once Ginny had shown up, as Harry’s brain replayed his session with Gladys over and over and over. The kids were distracted because Harry was distracted, and training turned out a complete disaster.
“Oh.” Malfoy peered at him. “And…did you like it?” The pink spots were back on his cheeks.
“I don’t care what you meant. You and I are not family. We may be related by blood, but we are not
? What’d they say?”
They were still a fairly haphazard team; they’d only been training together for four weeks, and some of the kids hadn’t had any formal Quidditch training at all before joining. Even so, Harry was confident they would do well at the game on Sunday. They had another training session on Thursday, which was also when everyone would get their player uniforms and they would check over the equipment to make sure everything was in order and ready for the game.
“So…Draco,” she said. Harry made an
“I know, kiddo. You’ll get it next time.”
“I’d rather not,” Harry admitted. He closed his eyes for a moment, breathing slowly and deeply, and then turned his attention back to the pitch.
“Yeah, sometimes. When I have the time.” He glanced at the three of them, who thankfully didn’t look too put upon. “I’d offer, but, er, I don’t have a lot of free time anymore. I have this new boyfriend, you see.” He grinned at Draco, whose cheeks were rapidly pinkening.
Percy had lost his voice entirely, alternating between cheering on his sister’s team and his boyfriend’s team, but that didn’t stop him from yelling—soundlessly—when the game ended, and the Holyhead Harpies won. Harry grinned, thumping him on the back, and hollered at Ginny as she flew past on a celebratory loop, hair wild and cheeks flushed from exertion.
“That’s all right,” Harry said, ordering the documents off the shelves and into the trolley he’d brought. “They’ll sort themselves back into their own places when I take them downstairs. I just need to verify that there’s nothing missing.” He tapped the ex libris list for the room with his wand and watched the items on it lit up and burn black as everything returned to the trolley.
“Maybe?” Harry shrugged. He could do without the graphic parts of the falling in love plot as well. It was at least partially why he’d enjoyed reading about the detective and the magician; in addition to the ‘saving magic’ plot there had been a lot going on with their relationship development, but they hadn’t been shagging from chapter two.
The irony that he would be seeing his therapist later that day to sort out his own emotional well-being wasn’t lost on him, but he was also already tired, so the thought of having to spill his feelings to Gladys later was weighing down his shoulders like a particularly heavy robe.
“I don’t know!” Alice cried, only she was crying so much the words came out all garbled.
“But—”
“What are
“I think you’re right.” Harry let her help him with the distribution of glue and glitter (and which colours and shapes of glitter to use) until Betty was satisfied his cards were perfect. “I think these might just be the best cards I’ve ever made,” he said, admiring the end result. “What do you think, Charlie?”
“Can I help you?”
Harry was quiet, staring at Ginny and her unyielding gaze. She was right. And unlike him, she usually didn’t have any scruples about letting the truth out.
“What was that you said before about a Little League?” Ms Baxter asked.
“I have to return these to the strongroom they came from,” Harry said. “I can check them out for you again tomorrow.”
Or maybe it was his imagination. He didn’t think so. Not after everything—not just their shared history, but
Draco patted Harry’s knee, while Harry took a moment to collect himself. “What were the other pamphlets for? If you don’t mind my asking.”
“No, I want to celebrate in the pub,” Harry said. “Everybody is there. And I want to talk to Oliver.”
He hadn’t come this clinic to talk about the Dursleys, he’d come here to get the sex thing fixed. Un-kill that void inside of him—that Gladys had said wasn’t there, explaining that he in no way was partially dead, or just a little bit dead, or damaged. He’d come back whole, she’d said.
Harry wouldn’t mind if he came over all the time, to the extent that he never left at all, but Draco wasn’t there yet. And even if he did move in, Harry was sure he’d still spend Tuesdays at his mum’s. And even…well, Harry wasn’t sure he wanted Draco to move in so much as he wanted them to move in
Harry gestured at their naked selves, hoping it’d be enough. They hadn’t cleaned up yet, so they were both still sticky and starting to get gross.
Hugh’s eyes widened.
Harry didn’t answer. How did one say
Shaking himself out of it, Harry took the return trolley and the newly filled out request form down to the strongrooms. The documents in the return trolley returned themselves to their correct places, bar the flagged document which took itself to the conservation inbox tray. The ex libris list wiped itself and returned to a slot in the trolley.
“No, but you have been working tirelessly on becoming a better person than you were since then,” Harry pointed out. “Everything you’ve done since then has been about that. You’ve earned it. You get to have things, now.”
“Oh.” Harry looked between them. “So…you’re moving?”
“I’m not,” Malfoy whispered back. “I’ve got it under control. It’s LARPing, see?”
Harry turned the book over in his hands. The same spaceship was on the cover again, but the background and colour scheme were different. The blurb on the back promised plot this time, something about a mystery and an accident, and a cover-up. “Yeah, okay.” Draco hadn’t mentioned the book, but that didn’t mean he didn’t know about it, or didn’t have it pre-ordered at Flourish and Blotts. Harry decided to risk it. “I’ll take it.”
There was still no owl from Draco, but the hunger had somehow spurred Harry into…if not action, then at least a different state of being. He needed to get Draco back, and the only way to do it was by…talking to him, finding a way to apologise, explain himself, and…something.
Dean’s eyes lit up and Seamus looked ready to cry. “Yes! Thank you!” Dean said triumphantly, thumping the table. He gestured at Draco. “
“This is Seamus, I’m Dean,” Dean said, offering his hand. Millicent shook it, then Seamus’.
“You’re joking?”
“Freaking out?” Dean asked.
“You said you still talk to Aunt Petunia,” Harry said, feeling snide and petty and angry.
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged.
Harry put his arm around her and she leaned into his side. “I’m sorry,” he said.
“Well—” Harry started, but was cut off. Draco had forgotten to whisper.
“Have you met someone new?” Hermione asked.
teach the kids the Finbourgh Flick,” Harry said, automatically. Ginny was good at demonstrating, but absolutely no good at teaching—especially little ones. She had little idea of how to talk to them and even less patience, so she was usually content watching, taking notes, and planning ahead, while Harry rolled his sleeves up and got dirty with the kids. He stepped aside, letting her into the flat.
. Something that got him excited, something that felt meaningful in a different way. Something that wasn’t dusty and about preserving history, about posterity, something less steeped in questionable methods and practices, something whose history didn’t include cultural theft and colonialism—
“Right now, nothing,” Draco answered. “I, ah, have been—
“Who are you giving your cards to?” Betty now asked.
Merlin’s saggy bottom and fried toes, Harry was going to go
Malfoy’s science fiction novel was still sitting on the night stand by Harry’s side of the bed. A wild sprout of hope pierced his heart, and Harry reached out to touch the spine of the book.
He nodded. He understood, on some level, what she was saying, but it also sounded like nonsense. Of course communication was key. How should he go about communicating? What should he say? Of course he should say no. Of course he should, of course, of course, of course.
Not much later all six of them were trotting to the field, brooms in hand (no bats and no Bludgers), Harry carrying a small cage of fluttering practice Snitches. His thoughts kept straying to everything he’d discussed with Gladys the evening before, but he tried valiantly to keep focused on the present until he would have the time to properly process them; he had kids to look after.
Absolutely nothing could go wrong, right? Harry’s tiredness had evaporated, and he was wired now, fuelled by the excitement and energy rolling off the kids.
“Oh, that—I haven’t got any…I’m still looking into that.” Harry shrugged, trying not to look as awkward as he felt. He hadn’t technically decided he wanted to do this—he’d only been aware it was a thing for about twelve hours—but it was nagging at his brain and his gut, and Charlie’s enthusiasm was only stoking that fire, even as he balked at the paperwork. Harry had no idea where to even start with this thing. “I’ll owl you once I know more about it?” he offered.
“Yeah, okay. Okay.” Harry rubbed his face. “Bloody hell.”

“Of course, the Yule Ball was when

“What are you doing with them anyway? If you don’t mind me asking.” Harry gave him the new form.
go to therapy. Funny, that. Only, I go to sort out all the fucking trauma and bullshit from my life—my therapist suggested I confront you about it, which is why I called in the first damn place.”
This was starting to get unnerving. “You know, you can come in any time. The other staff can also help you.”
“Yeah, me too.”
“Morning,” Malfoy said. His cheeks were rosy with the cold. “Uhm. Sorry about yesterday.”
. “If you say so,” he said with a grin.

One of the girls was, undeniably, Harry’s cousin. He’d have known that face anywhere.
, you know. To be together. It’s fine.”
By the time Harry made it home, exhaustion warred with excitement and he stumbled into the bathroom to draw up a bath only to discover he’d run out of bath bombs. He should’ve eaten something, but he crawled into bed instead, ready for twelve hours of uninterrupted sleep.
Malfoy just shrugged. “You think you’re my happy ending?”
“I’m pretty sure. I love you, don’t I?”
She kissed him back. “Thank you, handsome.” Some of Ginny’s teammates walked out behind her, and she took a moment to engage in some mutual positive reinforcement, which included a chorused yell of the team motto and complicated high-fives. Ginny’s captain paused for long enough to give Ginny a hug and a whispered something or other which had Ginny’s cheeks flushed with pride.
“But I don’t see what I’ve done to earn—why
“I went to your house, but your mum said you'd gone to the Archive, and Mildred said you'd come here—”
“We’re counting on it,” Ginny said with a grin. “Ron and Percy have already reserved tables at the pub.”
Malfoy definitely looked pained. “Merlin’s balls, Potter. I’m.” He closed his eyes, then took a few moments to take slow deep breaths. “I’m sorry,” he said, when he opened his eyes again, calmer. “Uncertainty is one of the things that gets my anxiety going. I generally prefer to be given a time, day, and location, and advance notice. I’m working on it,” he added. “Should we…reconvene later?”
They sat like that for a while, polishing off three scones between them and half the teapot.
Peony looked away. “I don’t speak to my parents anymore,” she said. “Well, Mum, sometimes. But they don’t—you know how obsessed they were with keeping everything normal? How nothing ever was allowed to deviate from—from this arbitrary and toxic standard of normal that didn’t exist anywhere except in their narrow world-view?”
“Confused. Relieved? But confused.” Harry drew in a deep breath. “He said it was off the table then, and we haven’t talked about it since. I…don’t really understand it. If it were Ginny, we’d have fought about it. But he just said okay. I don’t know what to think about it? It’s weird. How could he go from being really…like, really into it one moment and then just flip to completely disinterested the next when all I said was no?”
Harry faceplanted onto the sofa. He wasn’t going to cry, he told himself. He wasn’t going to cry at all. He
Draco was staring. “Pansy has a girlfriend?”
Draco nodded, leaning into Harry. “I think I’m beginning to understand that.” He shuddered. “I—”
.” Padma glanced between the two of them, but apparently decided not to comment. “By the way, we are engaged.”
“I’d say!” This was Ron. “Bloody hell, mate, I was expecting to have to wipe you up from the floor.” He slapped a hand over his face, rubbing his chin. “You all right, then?”
“Little League practice.” Harry got up and emptied both their mugs into the sink. “Right?”
When had he last felt so exhilarated? When he had asked Draco on a date. Kissed him for the first time. Harry smoothed his hand over the list. Yes, he thought. This is what I want.
“I’m meeting with my supervisor for my dissertation in Muggle Studies,” Malfoy said.
Betty nodded very seriously.
Draco kissed him. His lips were hot and there was something desperate about the way he was kissing Harry, like he was trying to impress himself on him, or maybe draw Harry into himself. “I love you,” he said between kisses, “so much.”
This piqued Harry’s interest. “Why not?”
“I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve you,” Harry added. It was ridiculous, but it felt a lot like the heat from the curry had gone straight to his heart and now it was bursting with affection and love for Draco.
“I’ll work it out,” Harry said. “I think I can make it all work.”
“Yeah, for quite some time now.” Harry shrugged. “They’re moving in together and all. I think they’re doing really well.”
The right thing to do would be to say something like
“There’s nothing wrong,” Harry protested. “I’m just tired. Daycare was a mess today because Hugh and Betty were feeling left out, Avery and Alice were acting like royalty and Charlie wouldn’t shut up for one second about that goal he saved—”
They ate their lemon tarts in silence, the rain falling off Malfoy’s invisible umbrella in a neat round curtain.

Practice went perfect, and Harry went home slightly snowy and soggy at the bottoms, but happy and excited.
Harry closed the book carefully and put the stack down on the desk. “Thank you,” he said, again, keenly aware that he’d been given a tremendous gift. He still felt breathless. “Now. Let’s see about those murders, shall we?”
Once inside and back at work, fetching maps from the strongroom, Harry realised he’d forgotten to ask about Malfoy’s Muggle Studies. He’d ask later.
Maybe he could even…move in with Draco? Somewhere else, somewhere new. He looked at Draco, who had gone all pink again. Could he ask now? Or was it better to wait?
“Oh. Thanks.” Harry pocketed his change. “It’s, for, uh, LARPing,” he added, remembering the excuse Draco had used, all those weeks ago, on their first date.
“Yes, I did!” Emma said, squaring up proudly. “I also scored a goal!”
“Easier?” Draco’s voice had roughened. He cleared his throat. “I suppose you’re not wrong.” He took the cup Harry had poured for him and added milk and sugar. “Wandless magic is very difficult to do intentionally.”
Charlie let in one goal but successfully blocked the next, which had both Harry and Ginny jumping and whooping. Another ten minutes of gameplay, and then Harry rotated Joseph, Denise and Love out, and Jamie, Rachel, and Emma in.
“Right,” Harry said, remembering exactly why he was wearing these clothes. To intimidate his cousin. To feel powerful—to feel like whatever was going to happen in that café, he would walk out again whole and hale.
“Marking my spot?” Malfoy looked at Harry again. “Is that not okay? I would like to return tomorrow and resume my work.”
“Sure,” Ron said and threw a wrapper at him.
“I’m fine,” Harry said, quickly. Lying. “No, I mean—you know.”
Harry showed up to Little League training mildly hungover and trying not to let it show. He wasn’t late (he checked), but when he arrived, it was to find twelve kids and a number of parents making snowmen on the middle of the Chudley Cannons pitch.
“Is that an admission—”
“My girlfriend,” Ginny said.
Harry stared at her, but Mildred just smiled sweetly. “Ugh, whatever,” he said and pushed the trolley onto the levitating platform.
“Is this okay?” Draco asked.
“He's not home,” Narcissa said.
“You don’t think I wanted the same thing? I wanted—something of my own, a family, to feel safe, to love—I was picturing how much fun we’d have with our kids, you know? I wanted to—” Harry was breathing hard. “I just wanted you to love me.”
“Like the time I made butterflies?” Betty asked.
They were still standing. “Sit,” Harry told Draco. “I’ll get us drinks. What do you want?”
“That wasn’t the point. Choosing a new name was…it was this whole thing with a new beginning, figuring out who I was and, like, healing myself from…everything. I couldn’t do that with a name that I knew could potentially hurt anyone, you know? So I picked a name that no relative I know of has ever had, and one that was symbolic for healing, because I wanted that to be who I was,” she explained. She sounded like she’d given this speech before. “I’ve had enough of hurting people.”
“No. I don’t really know where to find them,” Malfoy said, cheeks pinking. “And I rarely have Muggle money on hand. Flourish and Blotts are fairly well stocked but will also order in things, so…”
, Harry thought wryly. Fit themselves into a new framework.
Harry had had difficulties not kissing Draco right there in the garden.
There was no answer to that. Harry abruptly did not want to have this conversation. He wanted to go home. Talk to Ginny, try to convince her not to leave, that they could…work through it. They could. They had to.
“Oh! Like potions?”
Harry went through the rest of the morning and his lunch break feeling dejected and desperate, tired, panicky, hopeless…cycling through an endless barrage of emotions with every moment that passed without an owl from Draco. By the time Harry turned up at the Archive for his afternoon shift, he was done. Just
“Looks like everything’s there,” Harry said when the last document squeezed itself into the trolley and the ex libris list had gone all black.
This was met by cheers all around, so Harry went to the bar. When he came back, it was to find Parvati in deep conversation with Angelina and Lee, while Padma’s hand seemed to have found its way up Pansy’s skirt. That didn’t stop Pansy from giving Harry a searching look, a perfectly sculpted eyebrow raised in question.
Draco dabbed at his eyes again. “I’m sorry. I’m just…I don’t know where these emotions came from. It just feels…it feels like I’ve been falling, you know? And nobody could see it—see
“Yeah, no, yes, it’s okay. I just hadn’t expected—look what you’ve done. You’ve gone and made me fall in love with you more,” Draco said, voice rough and terrified.
Harry wavered. He and the volunteers were the only ones who didn’t have their own offices. Whatever cataloguing work he did was always done with somebody else, in their office, or in one of the work rooms where they had the space to deal with large amounts of files. “But I have the daycare also,” he said.
Harry took the cue and let him be, returning to the front desk and the stack of mail. There was an odd ringing in his head, like adrenaline barrelling into old walls. Malfoy had just tried to joke with him. And Harry had tried to joke back, and Malfoy had
After that things happened fast, and the game was in the air, players speeding after one another and dropping balls and bats left and right.
“Sure,” Ms Baxter said, giving him one of her rare soft smiles.
“Did you?” Padma asked.
Ginny wasn’t here, so he would have to get somebody else to be assistant coach. Harry hadn’t realised that breaking up also meant
Harry made sure everyone had control of their brooms, gave the Beaters their bats, and then released a set of training balls, also sponsored by Nimbus. These balls weren’t easier to catch or beat or pass than regular Quidditch balls, but they were charmed to stay within the same low physical range as the brooms themselves, so nobody would be soaring into the sky after a Golden Snitch—it could only go as high as seven feet. In addition to this precaution, Bludgers were charmed to avoid hitting heads in order to prevent severe head injuries.
“Two am,” Harry confessed. Having that in common with Malfoy…Hope surged. “This morning. I liked it, even if nothing actually happened in it.”
“Okay, so…what does that mean?”
“What did she say?” Harry asked, taking Draco’s hand to kiss his palm instead.
“Maybe.” Malfoy paid for both their lunches and gestured for Harry to get a move on. Their plates, as always, floated gently ahead. “Maybe it’s all of those things. Smelling the weather, tasting the food, talking to you. It’s a particular kind of peace.”
, I could spin and dye my own wool for a fibre art project,” Dean argued. “And I could train them to run in formation—”
He didn’t wait for Malfoy to say anything, just grabbed the trolley and pushed it out of the room.
“Apologising,” Harry replied, heart in his mouth. He held up the paper bag with the book. “I brought a conciliatory gift?”
The knowledge threatened to steal all his breath.
“It’s a
“I suppose,” Draco said eventually. He opened his mouth to say something more, but seemingly changed his mind and instead went for more tea. When he finally spoke again, his tone was different. “You said it was boring. Tell me about that.”
“Hey,” he said, only a little breathless. “Want to get out of here?”
“All right.” She waited.
“All right,” Harry said, setting the fear aside for now. He looked at the copy in his hand. “So…what else should I bring up for you? Do you want to continue with the Irish coroner reports?”
—who all relied on him to be some kind of adult and lead them on the path to chocolate-y victory…Harry felt out of his depth. He could deal with five kids, he was used to that, but
The bookcase didn’t look any more filled out now, with his meagre collection spread over three different shelves (with three empty shelves still), but it looked nicer, in that way where Harry’s heart was feeling less like an echo chamber and more like a small storage closet.
Ginny paused. She had a fork stuck in her noodles, wound tight. “Malfoy?” Her voice had an odd quality to it. “What was he doing there?”
every now and then, instead of, I don’t know, weaselling out of it in other ways, I’d have felt less…unwanted.”
Malfoy’s eyebrows rose almost comically high. “Are these things actually magic? I have to ask, because I’m not sure I understand why anyone would want to sit in a bathtub so often and for so long.”
