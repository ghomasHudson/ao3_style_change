“You want to try?”
“I guess this is it then.” Ginny said when she’d read to the bottom of the page.
“Absolutely.  It’ll be fun.  We can get a nice betting circle set up.  In fact, I’ll bet you 10 galleons that the first time you appear in public with me and Pans at least one paper will be speculating about how we’ve brainwashed you into being a sex slave within our harem.  Also that Teddy is your love child and that you tragically and heroically sacrificed your entire happiness and future to care for him according to the wishes of his mother’s will.”  Draco had to admit to himself, as far as the Prophet was concerned at least, his suggestions weren’t too far-fetched.  He’d kept a collection of the articles about Harry over the years, they made for an amusing scrap book, and none of the suggestions made had been any more ridiculous than Blaise’s.
Harry paused and took a deep breath.  This was his therapist.  She would not judge him.  The world would not come crashing down if he spoke the words out loud.  Doris remained silent as he sat there working his way up to talking, patiently waiting and watching; understanding that he needed this time to compose himself.
“I love you too.  Now let’s go find something crappy to watch on the TV and wait for our erstwhile lover to return with the food.  Another glass of white?”
“Why do you think he did that?”  Hermione asked once she’d read the article three times through.
“The last thing I remember is you handing me the potion.  What happened?  Did I turn into a stag, or a kitten?”
“Some people do it.  But it’s okay to not want that.”  Al said, remaining calm.  Scorpius was pacing the room in agitation.  “Then what do you want” Al continued.
“Lily’s pregnant.  Shit Harry. When did you find out?” Angelina interrupted him.
“I know.  Sometimes I wish I could just tell them.”
piano concerto was on the stand in front of him.  The ‘Emperor’ had seemed appropriate when he had pulled a piece out of his collection of sheet music.  His father was dead.  The man who had shaped who he was.  Shaped his early years in both positive and negative ways. He had ultimately failed to live up to Draco’s childish hero worship.  Proved himself a scared, weak man, who had succumbed to the Dark Lord and then Azkaban.  Less than 3 years.  That was all it had taken to finish his father.
“Yeah, he’s been really great with helping me deal with the whole divorce, impending new sibling and gay dad thing.” Lily paused thinking how ridiculous it all sounded when put like that before continuing.  “He always knows when I need to talk and when to just sit there with me.  Like on the train, he could see I was feeling upset, so he pulled me into this really tight hug, kissed me lightly on the forehead and then sat back and read his book out loud to me.  He even did all of the voices trying to make me laugh.”  Lily said this thinking fondly of the memory.
“Take all of this disgusting dark varnish off.  They walked on this floor.  He walked on it.  It should be stripped clean.”
“And you still love me anyway.”  Harry smiled, looking deeply into the silver-grey eyes of his husband.
“Teenagers are worse.  And we may have only had Teddy half the time when he was little, but we still did our fair share of sleepless nights with him.  Though I don’t think Draco touched one dirty nappy.  You may not have been around, but Blaise can attest to the horror that was toddler Teddy.  Metamorphmagus babies are just trouble.”  Harry and Draco had looked after Teddy for large chunks of every year to give Andi a break, as soon as they’d settled down in their own place.  He was like their own child.  He even made his eyes match theirs most of the time, with a heterochromatic grey and green shining out of his happy face.  Both Harry and Draco loved Teddy as much as he loved and worshipped them.  They were family.
“Yeah.”
“That’s okay.  I’ll wait.”
“That’s why you’re my best friend.” Scorpius looked up as he said this and spotted Lily appearing to be walking right towards them.  He half stood up as she approached the table, then realising that would make him look like an idiot quickly sat back down, making the whole situation worse.  Lily smiled at him and he forgot that he had been making a fool of himself, and that he had breakfast smeared on his tie.
“Yes-ish.  He just wants you.  It wasn’t a nightmare, he’s just a bit upset.”
“I have no idea what has gotten into the two of you today.  I came home expecting the worst and I get this mood from both of you.  How about I pop out and get fish and chips?  We can have gin and Jam roly-poly for dessert.”
“Are you okay Dad?” Lily was concerned.
“I’m okay now, my Harry.”  Draco said when he finally felt able to let go.  “So we need to get into Hogwarts and get the diadem.  I suppose we should wait until September for that one.”
‘No.  If we could run now I would, do it.  We would go to Blaise and live in hiding.  But you know there’s no way. Let me do this for you.  Let me give you the life you deserve.  Even if I can’t be in it.  We have one more night together.  Let’s not fight.  Let’s just be together.’
house, right?”  Narcissa asked once she was sat on the sofa.  She had one ankle crossed over the other and looked every inch the rich entitled pureblood.  Blaise didn’t sit down.
“Fine, we can go upstairs.”
“Come on then Draco.  Our children need us.”
“You are devious Hugo.  I’ll give it a go, what’s the worst that can happen? My potion’s grade improves?”
“I’ll send him an owl and get him to bring them by on his lunch break.  You go get in the shower and I’ll write to him straight away, then make us some breakfast.”
“It’s been twenty-five years; they really should have given up the grudge by now.”
Harry sat up.  All of the affection and calm he’d felt only moments before leaving his body.  Draco had mentioned months ago about the expectation on him to marry some appropriate woman, but he’d thought they’d moved passed that.  He grabbed Draco’s wrist and pulled him back onto the bed.
Harry laughed.  It wasn’t a nice laugh though.  It was a distant and distracted one.  His slight manipulation before had clearly been successful.  Now was the time to correct the faulty assumption and destroy his career at the same time.  He had to make it so he could never go back.  Even if he tried.  “I’ve been seeing her for more than two years.  This isn’t the first time she’s told me I shouldn’t be in the field.  This is just the first time I’ve actually listened.  I should probably never have been allowed to pass the psychological evaluation to get into the training programme.  My accident…  The one that nearly killed me… I had a flashback and froze.  I’ve been having them for years.  Even before the end of the war.  And it wasn’t even the first one I’ve had that’s caused me to get injured.  I can’t pretend they don’t happen anymore.  It’s not fair on the rest of you.  I’m not safe or fit to work anywhere near an active case.  I probably never will be.  I’m really sorry.”
“I heard someone apparate.”
“I’ll believe that when I see it.”
“I’m not doing it when there are other people there, even if they couldn’t see us.”  Draco replied, he had to draw the line somewhere.
He knocked on Neville’s door as he arrived at the cottage, hoping that his friend would be in and happy to see him.  He probably should have given him some notice, but the whole Hogwarts visit had been a little spontaneous.  The door swung inwards and he took that as an invitation.  He walked into the house, calling out.  There were voices from the living room and headed that way.
The three of them had spent the weekend in a happy little bubble.  Draco still wasn’t talking, other than the screams at night, but he showed no signs of either mania or depression making a move on him.  Harry had replied to his post, apologising for not responding sooner and blaming the fact that his head injury had made reading impossible.  He’d also let Molly know he wouldn’t be coming to the Burrow, as he wasn’t yet up to company.   He did however promise Andromeda that he’d pop by during the week to see Teddy.  Andi wasn’t going to bombard him with questions the way the Weasleys would, and he missed his godson.  It also helped that Andi, unlike the others, knew that he was in a relationship, although she didn’t know who with.  It had come up after he had had Teddy overnight once, staying in Grimmauld in order to do so.  The consequence of Harry trying to stay that night away from the Manor had been a spectacular meltdown by Draco when he’d woken from a nightmare screaming and Blaise was unable to calm him down.  Harry had had to apologise profusely to Andi when he’d dropped Teddy off at three in the morning in order to go home and deal with it.  Andi hadn’t pressed the issue, even when he wouldn’t tell her who he was seeing, or why he hadn’t mentioned to anyone that he’d stopped living at Grimmauld Place.  She also accepted that from that point onwards he would only take Teddy during the day.   Draco might be fine a lot of nights, but it wasn’t worth the disruption to Teddy and Andromeda if a bad one happened when Harry was away like that again.
“You are annoying.”
“The best.”
“I didn’t realise you knew about her.  We’ve sent a few owls over the last year or so, but I haven’t seen her.  Our relationship was rather strained for such a long time.”  Draco almost laughed at his mother’s decidedly mild description of the complete ostracization of Andromeda from the family.  “Is there any particular reason you’re asking about her?”
“That feels so good Harry.  Can I touch you too?”
Harry shoved at Draco’s shoulder.
“Yes.  Now get off with you.”  Draco smiled and shoved Harry gently.
“Harry, I’m so sorry”
“We need to leave without drawing attention to ourselves.” Draco was trying to keep himself calm and think rationally.  “Can you see what they’re doing?  I don’t want to turn and look.”
“Nothing, for the time being.  I want to take some time to decide what I really want to do with my life.”
“Seeing her makes this so much more real doesn’t it.” Scorpius eventually said.
“Tell me what he said ‘Mione.  I might want to forget about the prat, but I’ll listen.  I don’t want you feeling bad because of something he did.”
“Dumbledore isn’t an old fool!”  Sirius all but shouted.
“Harry, please we’re worried.”
The voice had been there every time he’d drifted in and out of awareness.  He wanted to tell the voice it was okay, but everything hurt too badly.  The tugging sensation and the gnawing at his chest were torturing him.  It felt like half his soul had been torn from his body.
“That’s okay.  Do you want to apparate or walk to the Leaky?”
Harry was about to reply when a there was a knock at the window.  Both he and Doris looked up to see an owl knocking on the glass.  Doris waved her wand and let the owl in.  It flew straight over to Harry and dropped the letter in his lap before leaving the way it came.  Harry stared down at the letter, recognising the Hogwarts seal and blanching at the urgent stamp on the front of the envelope.  He opened it and read the short note.
“You think I wouldn’t recognise my own family. What are you doing here?”
“I forgot you knew Al’s Dad” Scorpius, felt embarrassed at his slight social faux pas.
Blaise was right.  For some reason, the room had only provided one bed, although it was certainly large enough for three.
year had hit.  The mania had stayed away for a while then.  It was all down.  All the time. Until Harry.  Until Harry, nothing had been able to stop the swinging – nothing except being trapped at one end or other of the swing.  Azkaban dragged him down as far as he could go and imprisoned him there.  Then Harry had pulled him out.  Pulled him from insanity.  Pulled him from embracing the depression and nothingness.  Pulled him from losing himself in every horrific experience he had ever had.
Draco did as he was told, for some reason feeling safe in Potter’s company, and before he even realised, he’d fallen asleep.
This was the moment of truth.  “Your son is everything to me.”
“I can’t believe you obliviated that muggle.”
Harry followed George up to the spacious flat above the shop.  George sat down on one of the sofas.  Taking this as a cue Harry sat down on the chair opposite.  Harry didn’t think it was a good sign that he hadn’t been offered so much as a cup of tea.  But then, what did he expect.
It was nearly a week before Malfoy had another good day.
“I’m sure it’ll all work out eventually.  It might look crap now, but you don’t know what tomorrow will be like.”  It was far too optimistic a sentiment, but Harry wanted to believe it.
“Ummm… Okay.”  Justin felt a surge of pride at the praise of his article.  He had spent most of the three days he’d been told to delay researching it.  Looking into not only Harry Potter’s disappearance and life, but also any mention of Draco Malfoy he could find.  There wasn’t a huge amount about Malfoy.  That he was a Death Eater who had been given only a year’s probationary sentence on the testimony of Harry Potter was about all there was in the official reports, and the news articles at the time didn’t seem to have any more information that could be substantiated.  Just a lot of speculation.  There was a little on his school rivalry with Potter, but not a huge amount.  There was a lot more on the Malfoy and Black family, who he had learnt Malfoy was related to through his mother, and their involvement in the war – both in the early days and later, but it didn’t feel like something Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter would have appreciated being dragged up.  The only really interesting thing he found was a photo in an old copy of Witch Weekly.  The article accompanying it hadn’t had anything useful in it, but the photo had both of them in.  They were stood staring at each other outside Flourish and Blotts.  Justin had spent far too long scrutinising the photo, trying to see if he could see anything that would tell him about them as a couple.  There was a brief second where Draco’s face had looked hurt when he glanced down at Harry’s hands, one of which was holding the hand of the Weasley who would become his wife.  Justin also thought he saw Harry’s hand twitch, as if he wanted to let go of the one in his as soon as he noticed Draco there.  It was very subtle.  No one at the time could have had any idea, it was only with the knowledge of their relationship that it could be seen.  After that Malfoy had disappeared completely.  Not in the way Harry had.  Not in an instant, present one day and then never to be seen the next.  Malfoy had simply faded away.
They stayed quiet then, each of them lost in their own thoughts.
“That sounds perfectly reasonable, Mr Zabini.”  Blaise knew on any other ward none of this would be perfectly reasonable.  Ordering complete gagging orders on all staff, allowing a partner to sleep in the bed with a critically ill patient, and the other partner essentially telling the healers what they were and weren’t allowed to do to do their job.  He also knew that on any other ward there would have been a lot more questioning about the dark mark that Draco had managed to carve through in the this latest attempt, and the fact that Harry Potter had been the one to come in carrying an ex-Death Eater.  Most of the time being wealthy wasn’t something he thought about.  It was just what he’d grown up with.  Times like this though, he was infinitely grateful for the easy access to money and its privileges, he usually took for granted.
Justin touched the spot on his face where Teddy had kissed him.  It had been a strange day.   Justin couldn’t help but chuckle quietly to himself.  Then he noticed the time.  He was meant to be meeting his sister in half an hour.  His strange meeting with Teddy Lupin had made him forget all about it.  He gathered himself and then headed outside, to the nearest apparition point.
“Why?  Give me a few more minutes and I’ll be up for another round.”  Harry teased and nibbled at Draco’s ear.
“Investing in this shop was one of the best decisions I ever made.”
“I can’t seem keep breakfast down now.  I usually have a bit more luck at lunch time.”
Pansy took a deep breath to calm herself before replying.  She seriously wanted to slap the prat.  How could he be so dense?
“Well then get me something else to wear.” Malfoy still managed to pull off pissed off aristocrat despite his rather undignified position on Harry’s floor.
“It’s alright.  You can fix it.  Draco still loves you, otherwise he wouldn’t have been quite so upset about you being here.  You still matter to him.”  Andi soothed, stroking her sister’s hair.
Draco didn’t really know what to think of the whole conversation with the elf.  It obviously wasn’t bound to Harry, which made Draco nervous, as if it wanted to it could betray them.  He felt his breath start to hitch as panic started rising.
“You’re meant to be whatever makes you happy.  What do you enjoy outside of work?”
Time moved quickly after that.  Lily and Scorpius no longer hid their relationship.  Their routine of hanging out in empty classrooms hadn’t changed much, except now they were often joined by some of their friends for at least part of the evening.  Al and Rosie had found a room not far from the Hufflepuff common room and kitchens that didn’t seem to have any real function, daytime or evening.  They generally hung out in there and had all but turned it an interhouse common room before long.  The room had mostly been filled with long abandoned desks, and uncomfortable hard back chairs.  There was also an old green and silver blanket left in one corner along with a few pillows that were so thick with dust Scorpius didn’t think they could have been touched in decades.  One of the wooden beams in the back of the room had the initials DM and HP carved into them.  Scorpius imagined that this room had been found and used by another couple in the past and they had decided to leave their mark there.  They made the room more comfortable; Scorpius was particularly efficient at cleaning charms and it wasn’t long before the room was free of dust.  Lorcan, Lysander and Hugo had provided decorations and a pile of games.  Scorpius was suitably impressed with Lily’s transfiguration skills the first time they used the room, when she turned a couple of abandoned desks and chairs that had been left there into a 3 piece suite and a coffee table, as well as turning some of the others into a large round table surrounded by a dozen better quality chairs than the originals, for studying.  When they were still in their transfigured state the next night, he was even more amazed.  Transfiguration spells tended to be unstable, and it took a great deal of skill and power to keep them thing in their new state for any length of time.  Lily had blushed when she explained to him that she was taking additional advanced transfiguration with the headmistress and was already working on N.E.W.T spells in the subject.  Scorpius had insisted she show him something else.  Lily stood there, silent with concentration for a few seconds, then, her wand still abandoned on the table next to his, she pulled a black raven’s feather quill out of thin air without a word and handed it to him.  Scorpius looked down at the beautiful feather and back to Lily, amazed at the wordless and wandless conjuration.  Using the feather, he gently stroked her face before pulling her into him and then back onto the large armchair behind them.  They had an hour before any of the others would likely turn up and he wasn’t going to waste another second.
“Yes Draco…”  Harry knew another unpleasant revelation was coming and he wasn’t looking forward to hearing what Draco was about to say.
“But what if they try?”
Harry and Blaise worked on the illusions whilst Draco poured over the new book.  They had almost got it down when Draco exclaimed.  “Oh Merlin.  Room, you are the best.  Seriously.  Like the most amazing room in existence.”
“And what will you do?”
“Draco… what’s wrong?”
Draco closed his eyes and shook his head before he spoke.  “You’ll be the death of me Potter” Draco sighed before sitting up and removing his shirt.  “Tonight you’re mine.  Whoever’s you may be tomorrow is of no concern.”  Draco said this last bit in a whisper and with such bitterness in his voice.  Harry wished things were different.  So he said the only thing he could.
Despite his reassurances to Harry, Draco had had to fight every urge in him not to just grab Harry by the hand and disapparate straight out of there.  He knew that would be stupid though.  One, it would definitely arouse the eldest Weasley brother’s suspicions that something was up if two men, calmly sat eating in the café they just entered, disapparated with no concern for the huge number of muggles around them.  Two, breaching the statute of secrecy like that would no doubt result in someone from the DMLE investigating, which would almost inevitably lead to someone knowing they were here, even if they weren’t caught.  He managed to keep his cool, though his heart felt like it was going to pound out of his chest.  He calmly walked up to the counter and asked for the bill, saying that they’d just been urgently called away.  He could hear Fleur and the eldest Weasley chatting inconsequentially from the table that they sat at whilst he waited.  They hadn’t noticed him.  His was the glamour most likely to hold if they did look up at him, and even if it didn’t, his presence was unlikely to result in them doing anything, other than look down at him with the derision almost all the magical world did.  The problem would be if they spotted Harry.  Noticing him may cause them to watch him as he left and Harry’s glamour was much less likely to hold.  They knew him too well.  Draco’s hands were shaking as he got back to the table.  Harry had packed their food into little boxes.  He took Harry’s hand, as much for his own reassurance than anything else.  They walked rapidly and in silence away from Covent Garden.
“Really odd.  I’m guessing Harry is trying to stick to his word about not contacting us but thought it was important that we know this.  So, do you think we should listen and check over the wards?”
“When do you think we can arrange a session together?” Harry was eager to get things moving.  He’d wasted too many years already.
“I think the wallpaper up there is a bit dark.  It might show through.  We should probably strip it first.  I think between us, we could probably manage that with magic, without taking a wall down.  I don’t think we could get a steam stripper to work in here with all the interference, besides there’s no electricity.”
“Enough with the rambling Potter… so my potion worked, sort of.”
“You never did say exactly what the healers said.”
“Thank you… Potter….  Draco… Tell your mother… let her know that I love her.  That you and she were the last thing I was thinking of.”
“I’m a free man.  All very straightforward.  The aurors are now looking for Wormtail instead of me.  They apologised for the inconvenience.  The whole story will be in the prophet tomorrow.  Probably accompanied by that picture of you, Harry.”  The picture of Harry that seemed to be almost constantly in the prophet was a bit of a sore point for Harry, Draco and Sirius.  It could only have been taken and given to the press with Dumbledore’s blessing.  He was the only one who had had the opportunity to do so after little Harry had been attacked.  The lightning bolt cut was prominent on the baby’s head and still bleeding in the photo.  It made them all a little sick.
“That is correct.  Once you sign these the only person who will be able to enter will be yourself and anyone you bring in with you.  You will not be able to change the wards to allow direct access by anyone else.  Once Master Lupin receives the property, he will gain control of the wards.”
“Bring him here.”  The woman said.  “And you can call me Narcissa.”  She added with a warm smile.
Harry snorted and sprayed the mouthful of drink he’d just taken across the table. “I was going to do nothing of the sort.  Although Wood did have a rather nice arse, I just never knew you’d noticed George,” Harry said laughing.  “Maybe we should rank the arses of all of the quidditch players from our school days.  Ron, however lovely your posterior may be, I don’t think you’re quite up to Wood’s level.  You though George…”
“Probably.  We’re not likely to find out though, are we.” Ron replied, putting a full plate of breakfast in front of her.  She hadn’t noticed him finishing the cooking.  She didn’t feel much like eating after reading the article, however.  Her husband sat opposite her and began to dig in, his appetite unaffected by Harry’s surprise appearance in the press.  He’d relaxed significantly about the whole Harry issue over the last several months since Harry had turned up on the doorstep of the Burrow.  She thought it was probably understanding the reasons for Harry running that had helped him deal with everything.  Along with the chance to hit Harry and let out his frustrations.  She may not have liked that her husband had resorted to violence, but she was infinitely glad that some of the resentment towards Harry that had been there for years had gone.  She knew Ron still felt hurt at being abandoned all those years ago, but having an explanation helped him keep his temper in check whenever something to do with Harry came up.  She was sure that if this article had appeared before that day, Ron would have incendioed the paper before spending the rest of the day raging.
“About as well as can be expected.  I’m hopelessly behind with everything.”
“It’s how I got away with a lot of crap.  But now it is at your service so you can please the school nurse and eat a meal without feeling like you’re going to throw up.  In return I expect you to help me eat as well.  We can raid the kitchens when we’re done with your supervised meal.  I really hope these delightful side effects stop at some point, or at least ease off.  If they don’t, there is no way we can keep this from people.”
“I thought you might be hungry.  You’ve missed lunch and dinner.  I popped by the kitchens.”
“Why don’t I take little Draco?”  Siri said, holding his arms out to the toddler.  “You two look like you could do with a little time alone.  Me and Cissa can explain everything else to Remus.  We’re not going to send either of you anywhere.”  Sirius placed a comforting hand on Harry’s shoulder.
“I wish you could too, but…”  Harry looked down at Draco between the two of them.  Neither of them wanted to move and risk disturbing their sleeping lover.
“She was… You know what, never mind.”  Draco sounded exasperated, and Harry really couldn’t blame him.  Giving a school child such a potentially dangerous piece of equipment just so she could go to a few extra classes, that weren’t even necessary, was a little ridiculous.    “Granger being giving a time-turner when she was 13 is not the issue here.  Yes, potentially we could cause a paradox by changing things.  But we’ve already changed things by just being here.  Us sitting in this café and drinking this tea is potentially changing things.”
“I suppose you’re right.  Doesn’t stop it from hurting though.”
Draco sighed in relief.  He knew he’d slipped up using the name Harry always called his Godson, one that Draco shouldn’t by all rights have known.  He didn’t care though.  Teddy’s name seemed to have been the magic word.  He could see in her face that she would come.  That she would bring Teddy.  That it was all going to be all right.  Knowing she was coming made him brave.  Draco gave his Aunt Andromeda one more piece of information.  It couldn’t do any harm now.  There was no way she hadn’t guessed from their conversation exactly who he was asking her to come and visit at the Manor that evening.  She’d trusted him enough to allow the oath, now it was his turn to trust her.
“No!” Both Draco and Potter replied in unison.
Harry goes to the Manor on Ministry orders and discovers that those on the other side of the war suffered as much damage as the winning side did.
“Okay you three, can we please get this done as efficiently as possible. I don’t really want to be here all day if we can help it”.  Al and Lily nodded.  James, Harry noticed, looked like he wanted to say something. He was shifting slightly nervously on his feet and kept looking round as if he was waiting for someone.
“What are you doing here?”
“It’s okay. I know why it isn’t easy for you.  And really, I couldn’t have asked for better parents.”
“To my detriment no doubt.”
“No, it can’t be.  Scorpius was asked to come too.” Lily pointed out.
“Okay.”  Malfoy still sounded a little shaky and quiet, but he didn’t shut down.  Harry chose to take this as a good sign
Draco had told him once that there were times that it felt like bugs were crawling under his skin if he left things he had started unfinished.  That it reminded him of having to walk away from the thrice damned cabinet in 6
“You know where Harry is?”  Sirius gave him a suspicious glare.  He was definitely leaning towards the belief that Harry could only know where little Harry was if he was going to do something nefarious to him.  Harry tried to stay calm.  To keep Sirius calm.  The last thing he needed was for his godfather to try and arrest him, or worse.  There had to be at least a small amount of doubt in Sirius’ mind about who Harry really was for him not to have already done that.  Harry just had to make Sirius curious enough about who he was to go along with him and Draco for the time being.  At least until they could get some proof as to who they were.
Malfoy slowly walked towards Harry, as if still not quite trusting what was happening.  Harry didn’t blame him in the slightest.
“Very well then.  I’m sure the cot in little Harry’s room will serve Draco just….”
“Your younger self is a little monster.”  Little Harry was kicking his legs furiously now, refusing to be dressed.
“As soon as you’re ready.  Until now, this is enough.”  Harry turned his head slightly so he could kiss Draco back.
“That’s gross Draco.  Cast a cleaning charming.”
“Why?”
‘I’ll take yours.  On three’
Draco absently cast a stinging hex causing Harry to drop his sandwich in shock.  Luckily, it lands on his plate.  Draco is suddenly on his feet; a look of absolute horror on his face.
“No, I don’t think so, honey.  We can tell you about him though.  We have a whole lifetime of memories and mementos of who Harry Potter really is.”
“Oh.  Well that’s okay then.”  Ron shrugged.  “Don’t know why you didn’t just tell me before, but hey, whatever makes you happy.  Does Hermione know?”
“Oh…”  Harry felt embarrassed.  Three days unconscious from a little pain seemed a bit extreme to him.  He was sure he’d never done that before.  Even when the Dursley’s had been at their worst, and he was starving and bruised, he’d never ended up unconscious for an extended period of time.
“Maybe it’s something to do with mum and the baby?” James said, sounding apprehensive.
“So we wait until your father is sentenced.”
“I’ve been studying.”  Draco said the first excuse he could think of.
“How the hell do you remember these things when I can’t?”  Hermione said in frustration.  If she could have remembered what Harry had been talking about earlier, she might have been able to get him to see her side.
“I can walk.”  This time Harry managed a proper smile.
“Technically I’m not even one and a half right now according to my birth certificate.”  Malfoy said with his old drawl.  The one Harry remembered from school.  It made him happy to hear Malfoy talk like this.  Unlike every time he’d heard Draco speak like this before, he was in on the joke, instead of the butt of it.  Just like the plotting, it was much more fun to be this side of the table when it came to the sneaky blonde Slytherin.
“You want a glass too, Blaise.”
“You and Harry thought about having any kids?”  Astoria asked.
“We wasn’t expecting you Mister Potter.  The Master is in the water garden.  Is you going there to see him?  Maybe yous can be persuading him to have something to eat.”
“No.”  Harry snapped back, glaring at Hermione.
“I’ve tried, over and over, it just doesn’t work for me.”  Malfoy looked disappointed.
They apparated from the roof garden of the flat straight into the tiny London one.  Remus leapt up in shock at their arrival.  He looked a little worse for wear, grief clearly taking its toll, but a hundred times better than Harry had ever seen him before.  He looked so young, just like Sirius did.  It was hard to remember sometimes that the adults that Harry had met when he was 13 were only 21 and 22 right now – although Sirius’ birthday had passed them by without them properly celebrating.  Sirius had loved the LP of Queen’s greatest hits Harry had got him though.  Harry had remembered Sirius talking about how he had been planning to get the album for his 22
“I can’t deal with her.”  Draco sulked.   It had been more than a week since the funeral.  His mother had remained at Grimmauld place; they had even attempted a session with the two of them and Tara at the Townhouse.  That had been an unmitigated disaster.  Draco hadn’t been able to step through the floo, and when Narcissa had suggested coming to the Manor instead Draco had lost it and Harry had had to dope Draco up and drag him to bed.  He’d also had to call Blaise home from work to deal with an upset Mrs. Malfoy, and Andromeda had become involved.  Between the two sisters fighting, Blaise trying to play mediator and almost ending up in tears in the bathroom with Harry in his frustration, and Draco being stuck in bed no talking or moving for two days, the whole thing couldn’t have gone any worse.
year, when I got my own glimpse into what a Sectumsempra spell looks like in a bathroom.  Draco’s spell work had a little more finesse than your clumsy slashes, but just as effective.  It was bloody luck that he didn’t die.  I shouldn’t be telling you this, and if you fucking let slip that I told you, I’ll make you wish the Dark Lord had finished you off.  But I need you to know how easily you can ruin him.  I need to make sure that you know never to do it again.  From what he’s told me, you know something about his variety of hang-ups from after the war.  Let me tell you.  However strong he is.  You keep on doing this and he is going to break.  And if you shatter him again, nothing will be able to put him back together.  Yet even last night, despite the fact that just being around you is enough to start him into a spiral, I knew it was you he wanted to comfort him.  Not me.  Whatever he said about it being best if you stay away from each other, which frankly  I think is a good idea.  I know that if you told him you wanted him the same way he wants you, then he’d have you in a heartbeat.”
“Yes dear.  It’s me and you’re safe.  Would you like a cup of tea?”
“Siri… Stop!”  Harry said.  Turning and placing himself between Draco and Sirius’s wand.  “He’s like me… He’s not his father… He’s Draco Lucius Malfoy… Son of Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Black.  He was born the 5
“Are you sure?”  Harry asked coyly moving his hands to Draco waist and pulling them tightly together.  Draco could feel his traitorous body responding, despite how tired he was, as Harry kissed him.
Blaise felt a small nod against his chest and continued to hold his friend, trying desperately to ignore how much he liked touching Draco like this.  It wasn’t as if anything could happen between the two of them.  Draco had been promised to the Greengrass family since he was a small child, and even if that hadn’t been the case, it appeared that Potter now had claim over Draco, given their reactions to other people touching them.  He did wonder why he seemed to be an exception, as Draco gave no additional signs of being distressed by the contact, and in fact seem to be comforted by it.  He hoped that Potter was holding up better than Draco whilst he was with Professor Snape.  Potter did seem to be slightly more able to control, or at least bear, whatever this thing was than Draco.  He heard a cough from behind him and turned to see Professor Snape was back with the two of them.  He didn’t let go of Draco though.
“Oh…  yeah they did that in the hospital.  I guess I forgot.  I think one of the potions is making me feel a bit fuzzy.”
Andi got up and moved to Narcissa’s side and pulled her into a hug, just like she’d done after her little sister’s first crush ended in heartbreak, when one of the other girls at their prep-school teased her, when she had left for Hogwarts leaving her baby sister behind for the first time.  Her gentle and kind little sister who had learned to be cold and hard.
“Well he is a fashion designer.  And I’ll tell my other partner you like his cake.  He’s on a bit of a jam kick at the moment.  I have a few jars with me.  I would love for you to take them off my hands.”
“Come sit on the sofa with me and watch a film.”
Andi kissed Teddy on the cheek and apparated away from the front doorstep.
“I can see I’m not going to get anywhere,” Angelina sighed.  “But please, stop shutting out your friends.  Your family.  We
“The kitchen was pretty much right next to our common room.  Did you never sneak in there?”
“Don’t you cousin me Sirius Black.  Tell me what happened.”  Narcissa could be a formidable force when she wanted to be.
had.  It wasn’t fair on either of them having to keep this secret, but it was worse for Draco.  He didn’t have anyone else in his life apart from Harry and whole bunch of elves.  He spent his days rattling around in a too big house. Then, when he tried to do something to reclaim some of the life he’d lost, he ended up with hateful slurs thrown at him while Harry watched on, not doing a thing to help.
“I ordered a bottle whilst I was waiting.  I hope you don’t mind.  If you want something else that’s fine.”
“I don’t know.  I believe him though.  He knew where I would be that morning.  I didn’t even know where I’d be.  I was chasing down Wormtail.  And he knew where and when Dumbledore was leaving little Harry.”
Draco and Harry stood there, sheepishly.  Narcissa had barely given them a chance to begin to explain how their nice and quiet trip to a café and a park, had turned into an interview and Harry announcing they would be attending the 25
“What!”  Harry exclaimed and tried to sit up again, except Draco had pre-emptively pinned him down.

“Sure Dad, brown or white”
“You have, but you stuck by me when I wasn’t exactly in the best place.  I can see how much you’re struggling with this, and it hurts that you won’t talk to me, but I do understand.  I just wish you’d talk to someone.”
“Come on little Draco.  I’ll take you to mummy.  I’ll be back in a minute mini me.”
“So…”
“Urr… I thought it might have fallen behind the dresser, so I moved it to look.”
“We should head back.  Shower here or in the dorms?”  Blaise asked.  The room answered for them, vanishing the door to the bathroom.  “Dorms it is.”  Blaise grinned.
“He’ll be here soon.  Just try and sleep for now.”
Lily, Al, Hugo, Rose, Lysander and Lorcan all visit the Manor and play hide and seek.
The room obviously liked it too, and the three of them had no doubts that the security of their room had just been increased.
“Completely.  Now give me a hug before I have to go in there.”
“I have an idea for today, Draco.”
“No Harry.  You’ve done more than enough for them.  I know you like your job, well at least most of the time, but you can’t do this to him again.  If you die, he won’t survive.  I might, but he won’t.”
“Okay so we’re both as bad as each other, but it doesn’t mean we should just give in.  You are going to kiss me goodnight.  Then I’m going to turn over and your going to put your arms around me so I can snuggle back into you.  Then we’re going to sleep.”
“Would you mind if I poured this bottle over Harry’s head, Draco?”  Blaise added.  Understanding what Harry and Draco were doing, and joining in the game with one of their standard jokes about subpar wine.  Harry was annoyed with Professor McGonagall.  Not just annoyed but royally pissed off.  She had ignored his explicit instruction not to be placed at the head table, and for him and his friends to be together.  Then she tried to call him out on it and expect him to bow to her will.  Her calling him Harry didn’t help either.  He hadn’t seen her in nearly a quarter of a century.  He was an adult.  You don’t greet practical strangers by their first name without being invited to, even if you were once their teacher, and you certainly don’t demand that they move seats.  Somewhere in the back of his mind he thought that his 18 year old self probably wouldn’t have cared about the first name thing, that this was something he’d picked up from Draco over the years, but he absolutely would have minded about the seat.  He also knew that he was probably behaving like a bratty teenager, rather than the adult he was supposed to be now, but his nerves had gotten the better of him, and all he could think was that if she was going to be rude, then he could be rude right back.  He didn’t get why she was coming over her to make a fuss over him refusing to sit at the head table in the first place, he thought he’d made his wishes perfectly clear.  The only assumption he could come to was that she either felt slighted by him rejecting his seat as a guest of honour, or it was his choice of companions, and he thought he could guess which.
“Yes.”  Sirius said with a sigh of relief.  He hadn’t mentioned that Remus was a werewolf to the two boys, and wasn’t sure that they knew, but Harry had made it obvious that they did, and that it wouldn’t be a problem.
Draco was surprised at the admission.  He couldn’t imagine admitting any of the less pleasant aspects of his home life to anyone.
“And I had to work extremely hard to do so.  But I certainly couldn’t do what he’s managed to do with charms and potions.  Anyway, Harry showed up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco spoke again.  “I don’t think you should break up with her.”  It wasn’t what Harry expected to hear.  “Don’t misunderstand me.  I do not want you to be with her.  If I could have my way, she’d be out of your life completely.  And I seriously do not want to even think about you and her having sex.  If you break up with her, however, it will raise suspicions. Especially with
“Blaise.”  Tara said, quietly when she entered.  She came over to him and enveloped him in a warm and very welcome hug.  “What happened?”  She asked, stepping back so she could look at both Draco and Harry lying on the hospital bed.
“And no one will end up crying in a bathroom petrified for their life.”
“You know this wasn’t why I brought you back here.”  Teddy said, letting his finger’s trail across Justin’s lips.
“Yes, my Harry.”
Being back in England without their disguises felt very strange.  Not even a week had passed since Draco had suggested the trip before they were here.  They were in Palmers Green again, with Teddy.  They hadn’t been here in more than twenty years.  Not since Harry had handed over the papers ending Draco’s probation.  The three of them entered the café and were pleased to see that their favourite table in the window was free.  They ordered three pots of tea and two scones.  A cheese one for Harry and Draco to share, whilst Teddy enjoyed a sweet one with jam and clotted cream.  It was ridiculously easy, and every minute they spent there, Draco felt a little less like he was about to be exposed as a Death Eater corrupting the great Harry Potter.  The bell at the door went and a small girl ran in like she owned the place, followed by a tired looking man that could only be her father.
Harry couldn’t supress the grin when he walked into the room and saw Draco sprawled on the sofa, eyes closed, with his head in Blaise’s lap.  Blaise was stroking the blond hair with one hand and seemed to be trying to do work on some sketch for work with the other.  Blaise was dressed scruffily in an old t-shirt and grey joggers.  Draco was wearing the soft white fluffy dressing gown Harry had bought him for Christmas last year.  When Harry got closer to the sofa, Draco opened his eyes and then held his arms open to Harry.  Harry welcomed the invite and sat of the edge of the sofa pulling Draco into a tight hug.  He nuzzled into Draco’s neck, taking in the scent and feel of him, that he’d been missing desperately for days.
“Yeah.  If you want to you should be able to come in.  I don’t know about meeting them, but I’ll ask.  I want you to meet them.  I mean.  If you want to meet them.  That is.”  Harry knew he was rambling a little.  He didn’t think he’d felt quite so nervous about anything before.
“Harry, what the fuck.  Seriously what the actual fuck.  Fifteen years with just the one note.  And even that didn’t come for a decade.  I thought you were dead, or worse.  Now you just show up on the bloody doorstep.” Hermione was furious.  However much she had wanted to see Harry again, his appearance had brought up every frustrated and aggrieved feeling she’d tried to push away.  The ones that both her and Ron had.  She’d suppressed them so they bubbled unspoken under the surface, whilst he let his feelings out in bursts of rage, but they were still the same feelings.  It was much easier to focus on missing him when he was still the friend from her memories, instead of this unfamiliar adult she now had in front of her.  After his initial outburst in punching him, Ron was now ignoring Harry and was pacing the room, not saying a word.  She’d managed to persuade Molly and Arthur to take the kids out for a bit.  She didn’t think she was going to manage it, Molly wanted to stay, but Arthur had eventually made her see reason.  Rose and Hugo shouldn’t be around for this, and Ron and Hermione needed to talk to Harry.
He smiled at her fondly as she scribbled down her number on a scrap of paper and then got up to leave.
With that Scorpius put his book down and placed his hands on her waist.  The two of them started kissing again.  They didn’t hear the door open.  It wasn’t until Rose gasped that they stopped what they were doing and looked up.  Al was stood in the doorway looking shocked, Rose standing behind him.
“Lily, you know that some people find people of the opposite sex attractive and some prefer people of the same sex, and that some have no preference at.”
“Cake.”
They broke apart with a gasp.  Draco could feel his arousal, and was sure Harry was in the same state.  This wasn’t the time for it, though.  This was the day he was burying his father.
“I know you did.  You told me.  Before you went.  Any particular reason for stating facts I already knew.”  Draco replied without looking up from the paper in front of him.
“You two are dating, aren’t you?”
“Think about the paints.  The colours.”  Harry wanted to distract Malfoy from whatever bad memories were starting to creep to the surface.  He hoped that the delight they’d shared earlier, when they talked about redecorating, and when they were choosing colours, would help.
“Can’t they just start the speeches and get this bit of the night over with.  From what I remember, it they were decidedly dull last time I was here.”  Harry said this with purpose, wanting to ignore whoever was approaching the table.
“It was like that with my Ted.  Never perfect, but always right.  Muddling through together.  But we are getting decidedly maudlin and it’s getting late. I’m sure you want to check on your boys.  I assume there is a room set up for me?”
Yes, that was the question Draco didn’t want to answer.
Draco prodded Blaise’s side.
“You always help.  Mmmm.  That feels nice.”
_________________
“That doesn’t mean I need to be tied to the bed and babied, Harry.  I’m fine.”
“Hmmm.  You are decidedly inciteful today.”
“Why did the estate come to me when he died then?”
Rather than replying Draco stood up and grabbed at the letter, pulling it out of his hands and making Harry laugh.  He saw Draco’s face light up as he read the official letter confirming Harry’s divorce.
“Do you think we did the right thing by talking to that journalist?” Harry asked, worried about what Narcissa had said.
“See you tomorrow then.”
“The Goldburg ward is about as private as it gets.  It’s the old money pure-blood ward.  The chances are Harry and Draco are the only patients here at the moment, and the place is under several secrecy enchantments.  The healers looking after them, apart from the head of department, will all have been pulled off their regular wards the second a patient came in and are bound by strict contracts.  I’m not surprised you haven’t heard of the place, very few people have.  Luckily, we have two beds here, otherwise we might have some trouble with them treating both Harry and Draco, but the Malfoy family and the Black family each own a room.  If we wanted to, we could request that when Draco and Harry are discharged that the healers have their memories modified.”
“I wasn’t thinking about the Aurors actually.  I think we need a curse breaker.  I’m sure Bill will help.”
“Him… need… coming here… feel it…. Just…  help me get to him.”
“I have something else to say to all of the venerable people in front of me.”   Every part of his being screamed at him to stop, but he couldn’t.  The last fight with Draco had made it clear that this was the only way forward.  “Without the devotion, even in absence, of the woman next to me, I would not have made it through the horrific year leading up to the final battle.”  The insincerity of the words tasted fetid.  Like his tongue was rotting at the betrayal of his own wants.  “Therefore, in front of every being and creature here in this hall, I would like to declare my own devotion to her.”  Wishing that he would spontaneously combust, so he wouldn’t have to take the next step, Harry moved onto one knee and pulled the box out of his pocket.  The box that contained the hateful ring he’d bought.  “Ginevra Weasley, would you do me the great honour of becoming my wife?”
“On what grounds.”
“He was left on the doorstep of my muggle Aunt and Uncle.  My mother’s sister and her husband.  I… I didn’t have a good childhood there.  I… that is, Draco and me, decided when we ended up back here, that we wouldn’t leave him there for him to end up having the same life I did.  So we stole him.  I don’t think anyone even knows he’s technically missing.”
Malfoy gave a small laugh, but his wand remained pointing at Harry.  “Never thought I’d hear the day you’d say I’m right.”
“You were pretty out of it.”
“But why?  It’s been fifteen years.  What could be so important that he would just reappear rather than let you carry on searching?”  This was the point that Hermione had been dreading.  She did not want to talk about Malfoy, nor see the look on Ginny’s face when she realised exactly who she’d been tossed over for.  Ron saved her from having to say it.
“Draco…?”
“Always.”
“Again, be grateful for my pure-blood training.  We can shove up the one of the family wards.  Doesn’t matter what enchantments they’ve got over the place, they’ll all be overridden.  Using those no one but the people we invite will be able to access the property.”
“Urr…Morning.”  Harry said.
“I think there’s something else you could do.  It would be risky, but I think it might actually let you know a little bit of what your Weasleys, and maybe even the rest of the idiots in Britain, feel about you and your life now.”
“Where have you been?” Hermione said, closing her eyes as she did so, obviously trying to compose herself.
“That fight happened 20 years ago, and right now I can’t seem to see why it was so important.”
“I don’t think he has, but we should probably mention it to them before Christmas.  I don’t want to go the whole holidays without seeing you.” Scorpius was happy when Lily smiled and brightened at that, lightening the sombre mood that had come over her at the talk of her parents.  “Do you want to eat something now; I have a whole feast tucked into my bag.  The house elves always try to out do themselves whenever I ask for food.  I told them it was only for two, but they seem to have packed enough to feed at least a dozen.”
It was the day after boxing day and Lily and Hugo were sat in the hot tub at the Manor.  Albus, Rose, Scorpius, Lorcan and Lysander were all in the pool, playing some game that involved a lot of splashing and an awful lot of noise.  Lily was grateful for the din they were making however, as it meant she could talk with Hugo with minimal risk of being overheard.  Her and Al had spent several days at the Manor over the holidays so far, though this was the first time the rest of their friends had joined them.  The look on Uncle Ron’s face when Hugo and Rose had told them where they were spending the day was priceless.  His ears had gone bright red and he looked like he was about to start ranting and forbid them from going, as Hugo had predicted.  Then Aunty Hermione whispered something in his ear that Lily hadn’t been able to hear.  When she finished, it wasn’t just his ears that were bright red.  Abandoning the rant that had been brewing, instead Uncle Ron had just about managed to stutter out a “behave yourself” to Rose and Hugo, before whisking Aunty Hermione back into the floo in a hurry.  Not long after Aunty Luna had dropped the twins over and they all had all flooed to the Manor.  Mr Malfoy had greeted them when they arrived, and then told Scorpius he was going to spend the day working in his office, leaving the group of teenagers to their own devices.  The weather meant that they couldn’t go outside and play quidditch, so instead they had decided on the pool.
“Do we have to?  Can’t we just go up to the office?” They’d been to the restaurant before when she was trying to get him used to eating in front of people years ago.  Right now, he didn’t want to deal with the anxiety of eating, particularly in public, on top of everything else he was feeling.
“Well you’re here now.  Mum was just about ready to throw a fit and come and get you herself.  I did warn you that would happen.  She’s in the kitchen, go let her know you’re here and then come out into the garden.  We’re setting up a game of Quidditch.”  It felt so typical, whenever Harry had spent a morning doing something he would like to talk about, no one asked about it.  If he’d been with Malfoy, he got bombarded with questions about what he’d been doing.
Lily felt a bit better now she’d heard the whole explanation.  The fear that had fuelled her earlier outburst having dissipated.  Still, the thought of her parents divorcing and everything changing was frightening.  Lily was still feeling very overwhelmed by everything she’d been told.  She wanted to be a little girl again with her Daddy’s arms wrapped around her, where she knew she’d always be safe.  The tears were threatening to start again.
“But it doesn’t change anything does it?”
“I won’t.  But I can’t let this go.  This might be our last chance to find out what actually happened.”
“So I say we trust that the magic that sent us back did it for us to do just that.  And if we’re going to rescue the younger versions of ourselves, we may as well save Sirius.  If the magic says that we can’t do that then it will more than likely either erase us from existence or throw us back to the point in the future we came back from.  I’m willing to risk that.  I probably should have explained this to you before.”
“I’ve no idea.” Harry laughed and Draco was sure if they’d been standing, rather than curled up together in the bed, Harry would have picked Draco up and swirled him round.  “We need to cover our tracks.  They’ll search. I left my phone at the house.  They won’t get into the room and find it for a while, at least a week, so they shouldn’t be able to track us that way if we’re quick.  We should get rid of yours though.”
“You never do love.”
“I’ll do what is expected of me.  I’ll marry Astoria, the arrangements are nearly in place.  I’ll have a child who I will raise to not be the horrible bigot I was.  I will, fruitlessly no doubt, try and earn back the family respect my father threw away.”
“And what ingredients are those.”
“I always knew my mother was remarkable.  You’d have to be to put up with my bastard of a father for that long, but this just proves it.”
“Actually, this is the point where I don’t know what happened at all, other than assuming it’s not a good idea for us to be in different locations.  Or at least it’s not when this link is already stressed, which I’m pretty certain everything after the fight we had was doing.”
“Pansy dear, any chance you could come keep me company?” Draco said when he saw her sat on the sofa in front of the fireplace.
“Harry came to see you.”
“He had a bit of a shock this afternoon and came to shout at me.” A harsh and nervous laugh audible behind his words.
“Thank you, Draco” Harry said sleepily, and still fully dressed, he curled up and closed his eyes. Draco gently took off Harry’s glasses and placed them on the bedside table, his fingers lingering slightly on Harry’s cheek, then he turned and left the room.
“Thank God you’re here, I thought you had forgotten about the school shopping” Harry sighed in relief.
“Okay then, if we’re going to do this there are a couple of things that we should do first.”
“Maybe you and Gin could plan a holiday away or something, I know she wasn’t around for many of our summer trips, but you should enjoy the chance to spend some time together.  Ron and I have both booked some leave from work to go visit Norway for a week whilst the kids are at school.”
A potion was thrust into his hands and he swallowed it, not caring what it was as long as it took away this pain.
“And are you really going to see if Andromeda will bring Teddy to the Manor today.  Do you think we can trust her?”
“Four down.”  Sirius exclaimed excitedly.
“Shit.  You can’t check the wards without it.”
Blaise couldn’t answer but his silence was enough.
“Harry, if this is what you want to do and what you think is best, I will support you.  If you wanted the two of us to go see them together, I would do that.  Even if you wanted me to go see them alone to try and explain, if you thought that would make you feel better, then I would do it for you.  Fuck, if you wanted me to dance naked in the middle of Diagon Alley then we would come up with a way to make it work, although I would have some reservations about your sanity and the amount of influence Blaise has on you”
Remus was shocked that someone had split his soul so many times.  It didn’t bare thinking about.  Once was horrid enough.  He poked Sirius who handed over the packet of cigarettes and he took out a second.  He wasn’t usually a smoker, but Narcissa and Sirius were right about this.  Talking about horcruxes was definitely an excuse for drinking and smoking as much as they pleased.  This would just have to be a night where Tawly and Dobby looked after the babies, even though they tried to avoid that as much as possible.  “Okay… what about the others?”
The next month was a blur of wedding arrangements.  Molly had decided that they had to get married in October, so there was less than 6 months to get everything planned.  Harry let himself get swept up in it, so as not to have to think about Malfoy and how much he was missing him.  The only time he let himself think of the blonde man was when he wrote and filed the weekly reports.  However much he was hurting, he wasn’t letting the Ministry use Malfoy as a scapegoat and lock him away.  It wasn’t just that he was hopelessly in love with the prat, but he objectively didn’t think he deserved it.  He hadn’t thought Malfoy had deserved Azkaban a year ago, and their time together had only cemented that conviction.  The Ministry had asked him to show Malfoy the muggle world, and make sure that he behaved appropriately around them.  To make sure that he wasn’t secretly still harbouring the spiteful prejudices his father had spoon-fed him from before he could speak.  That had been the brief, even if it wasn’t the underlying reason for the task.  Even from an outsider’s perspective, no one could deny that Draco hadn’t successfully achieved all that had been set. More than that, he knew without a doubt that his Draco, wasn’t the person everyone thought he was in the slightest.  This was the last thing he could do to try and make his life a little easier.  The day the final report was due in, he had one last meeting with Kingsley to talk over Malfoy’s progress.  He wasn’t looking forward to it.  He never liked these meetings but this time it felt worse.  Final.  The fantasy reports were the last connection he had to Draco.  He didn’t know what he would do when they were gone.
Hermione rattled on and Harry sighed.  If he didn’t stop her, she’d go on for hours.
“You sure you’re ready Draco?” Blaise asked.
“You try and get some sleep.  It will be better in the morning.”
“Draco…  It’s really you…”  Tears were stinging Narcissa’s eyes.  She couldn’t believe it.  Her baby all grown up and here to save her.  To take her away from this awful house and its bastard of a Master.
“No.  I have more...  My bedroom used to be a cupboard under the stairs until my first Hogwarts letter came.  The longest I spent in there was three days with no food or water.” Then Potter’s face fell, as if he’d just realised what he’d admitted.  Draco could tell he was trying not to cry as he said his next words.  “They forgot I was there.  I was 5.”
“I’ll protect you…  I promise….”
Harry thought about what Draco said for a long moment.
“And after that.”
“Potter, you came.”
Draco was sat up late working in his study.  He was contemplating a night cap before bed when a crash startled him.  It was only him and the house elves at home, and none of them would be crashing around in the front room at 1 in the morning.  Draco headed down the corridor towards the room he’d heard the crash come from.  Opening the door, he was confronted with the last person he expected to be sprawled on the floor in the Manor.  Potter was obviously drunk.  There was an all but empty whiskey bottle in one of his hands.  His thoughts flew to the last time a drunk Harry Potter made his way to the Manor uninvited.  He tried to shake of the feeling of déjà vu as he approached the man sprawled on the hearth rug.
“Sorry Aunt Cissa.” Teddy said sheepishly.  “Sorry Grandmother.”
“No James, quite the opposite.  You were right this morning when you said I don’t exactly live there anymore.  You’ll be finishing school this summer and with your University and training in London, I thought that you might want to live at Grimmauld Place.  I know you don’t really want to live with me and Draco, and with the baby, your mother’s is hardly a great option.”
“And do you think clearly when you take you regular potions.”
“Not at all.  But I’m never going to do it if I wait until I actually feel ready.  We can go back to the places we used to.  We were never seen there anyway, and this will test the waters.”
“Only you would say that, Love.” Harry responded and placed his arm around Draco’s waist.  He left it there when they both sat down on stools next to each other.  Harry grabbed two lumps of sugar and stirred them into the black tea in front of him, ignoring the look of contempt his tea preference always caused on Draco’s face.  Draco picked up one of the cups with milk and took a mouthful.
“Let’s go back to bed.  I’m not due back at work for at least six weeks and I’ll think about asking for a transfer from active duty, at least for a while.”
“Harry, that’s wonderful, but I do want you to be careful.  At the moment you are riding a high.”
“How in the name of Salazar can it get worse?”
“I know. And I want to see her too.  But I was so awful to her.”
“Do you have a spare room?” Draco replied, remembering they had promised the previous night that they would take it slow.  They’d already overstepped that once today and he wasn’t sure they should do it again so soon.
“You’re only wearing a towel.”  Draco said, still feeling a little out of it.
“The baby.  I think the baby is coming.” Lily was nearly in tears with her fear, and Harry’s alarm at what was happening rose to meet hers.
“Hey yourself.  What you writing about, or do I even need to ask?”
“You talk to your boys and I will go along with whatever you decide.”
Scorpius helped Lily sit up.  He saw her grimace and fist one hand into her lower back, obviously in pain.  It lasted about twenty seconds.
“Fuck, I forgot that.” Draco said with obvious mirth.  “That was gold.  It was the talk of the common room.  Absolutely hilarious.  Although we obviously couldn’t let you know we enjoyed it at the time.  Slytherin solidarity and all that.”
“Well, I’m as fine as expected to be after finding out my marriage is a sham”
“So it’s changed?”
“Draco.  I would never try and poison you. I love you.”
“Fine, but the first chance we get you are going to explain exactly how you came up with the idiotic plan to get me out of Azkaban, and then thought it was a good idea to completely change the plan half-way though.  Not that I’m not grateful.”
“Some of it was because I thought no one would believe me.  The Dursley’s made out I was a troubled child who often hurt myself with my aggressive behaviour.  My teachers in primary school were always wary of me because of that.  And when I did finally tell an adult, they sent me back there anyway.  Dumbledore, in his infinite wisdom, decided I would be safe there.  He purposefully kept all knowledge of the magical world from me.  He was the one who left me on the doorstep.  It was cold and little Harry was left there.  If I hadn’t taken him, he would have been there all night.  I was left there all night.  It was only Dumbledore threatening the Dursleys that stopped them from throwing me straight back out when they found me.  And when I told him I didn’t want to go back there when I was at Hogwarts and finally knew about who I was, he was the one who told me no.”
Harry took a deep breath. “That day you left.  There was a party at the Weasleys.  I was upset and I drank.  A lot.  I don’t really remember much of what happened.  I do know that I woke up in Ginny’s bed in the morning though.”
“Yeah.  Woke up a couple of hours ago.  I thought I’d let you sleep a bit longer.”
“You know I love you, right.”  Harry said and pulled Draco into a kiss, not caring about the crowds of people outside and the other customers who could see them.
“Well I don’t think anyone is going to believe it’s mine.  Look, just go be with him.  What you said yesterday was more sincere than this. This is just you panicking about what people are going to say when they hear you cheated.  I’ll go and tell the kids at the end of the week, then we can announce to the world that we’re getting a divorce”
“It’s okay… you’re awake! That’s all that matters.” Sirius said with a grin.  His eyes sparkling with delight.  He was clearly pleased that Harry had woken up.
“I can go and get him if that will help.  Or I could call your mum…or dad… whoever you prefer.  I can’t stand to see you upset, Lils.” Hugo sounded lost.
Harry grabbed his stick and with Draco left the room.  Leaving their children alone with the baby.
“Love you.”
“Think about it.  I know I shouldn’t tell you what to do with your life, but I think it would be a mistake for you to do back to active Auror duty.  If I were an official Ministry therapist and had the right to, I wouldn’t sign you off to go back.”
“Merlin no.  Going by my middle name isn’t that unusual in certain circles.”
“What’s there to talk about, you’re pregnant with another man’s child.  It’s over between us.  This isn’t fixable, and even if it was, I don’t want to try.”
They walked out of the dorm and when Hugo touched the banister, the stairs flattened out and turned into the slide that most boys had to face if they ever tried to get up to the girls’ dorm.
“Why does that matter, Molly?  They’re all toddlers.  I’m pretty certain they are more interested in snack time and toys than a bunch of nonsense prejudice their parents may or may not believe and that they are incapable of understanding at their age  And anyway, it’s not like he could go anywhere else.  He can’t go to the local places as they’re all muggle and wouldn’t exactly be understanding of the randomly changing hair colour.  It’s the best nursery there is for young wizards.  He needs to play with children his own age.”  Molly’s reverse prejudice made Harry feel irritated.  He’d noticed since his injury he was finding things he’d be able to shrug off before, needled at him more that he was used to.  The healers said it was a result of the head injury and that hopefully it would ease off.
“And one I’m completely innocent of and of which you can have no evidence to state otherwise, therefore, I feel it’s prudent for me to wait for representation before I allow you access to my estate and person.”
“Please… It’s too much… I can’t do it anymore…”
“Can we go home now and think about this later?”
“Three?”
“Look, I should head back to the dorm.  It’s late and I really don’t want to earn any more detentions for getting caught hanging around the dungeons at midnight.  So…ummm…. See you around, Malfoy.” Then, almost as an afterthought, Potter continued.  “Thanks for not being a complete shit this evening.”
Ginny was quickly whisked up to the Labour ward leaving Harry and Lily with little to do but wait.  They went to the cafeteria and got a couple of cups of tea and croissants, then went back up to the waiting area outside the ward.
“It is just the older ones up there...?” Hermione still sounded concerned.
_______________________
Tom wasn’t aware how much time had passed before he next felt truly awake.  He had drifted in and out of awareness.  Every time he felt consciousness encroaching on him, Draco, Harry or more often than not, both, were there with him.  When he woke this time, he felt a little better.  He opened his eyes.  Light was creeping in from behind the shut curtains, so he thought it was daytime, although he had no idea exactly what the time was.
“There’s a bottle of white in the fridge.”
“What is wrong with me?  I should have thought of that.”
“You’re not telling me everything.”
“Yeah, I guess you’re right.  Let’s get dressed and head back.” Glancing down at the obvious wet patch on his trousers Scorpius grimaced. “We might need to stop by my bedroom so I can change my trousers on the way though.”
“Draco…”  Harry’s voice was soft and quiet.  Draco opened his eyes.  Harry’s face was very close and the startling green eyes were drawing Draco in.  He pressed his forehead against the dark-haired boy’s.
“Just a bit.”  Harry laughed.
“Want me to rub your shoulders?”
“What are you guys talking about?  And also why are you suddenly acting like friends?” Blaise asked, looking more confused than ever.
“I’m not taking no for an answer.  I’m fairly certain you’d splinch yourself if you tried to apparate right now.”
“I know.  It is easier when we’re in the same room, but it’s not the same as this.”  Harry trailed kisses up Draco’s neck and then began to tease at Draco’s ear with his tongue, causing the blonde Slytherin to moan in a very satisfactory manner.  Harry’s hands crept inside Draco’s robes.
Then they were both grinning, sprawled on the rug, with the absurdity of the situation.  Harry’s stupid injured leg had finally done something good for him.
“I’ll walk with you.”
“Yes.  Very close.  I’m still close now.” Draco whispered.
Harry felt extremely resistant about doing so, but knew they wouldn’t drop it unless he told them something.
“About two vats of blackcurrant and elderflower Jam.  The sloe gin should be mature now too, so we can have that as well.”
Draco stormed out of the room, exasperated, and hoped against hope no one had noticed he’d been out all night.
“How do I do that?  I don’t want to leave you here by yourself.  I don’t even know if your Dad’s in right now.  I can’t go and get him from the centre and leave you in the house.”  Scorpius was starting to panic.
“Because you stood there with your wand pointed at me with me making no move to arm myself and didn’t fire a single spell.  Because I’m the one who’s suggested the place to go.  So it’s clearly not something you’ve got prearranged in the room to kill me or take me away from the castle – especially given that I’m going to be the one to ask the room to create us a space to talk.”
“No.  Why am I the one who’s meant to keep track of all of your clothes anyway?”  Harry felt the hole getting deeper but couldn’t seem to stop himself.
“I’m not sure. I think I it would be a good idea for me to talk to Draco alone first.  Then we’ll plan a session.”
“Never again.”
The shrieking voice of Hermione broke off and Harry immediately dropped the silencing charm.  Dropping to the floor he wrapped Draco tight in his arms, ignoring the slight sting of magic as he did so.  Blaise was still stood on the far side of the kitchen, unable to get closer.
“Oh god.  That certainly is a mess, and it surely doesn’t explain your cheerful mood” Her brows furrowed.
“James I should be so cross with you.” Harry said taking a long drag.
Malfoy did as he was told and brought the requested items to Harry.  Harry couldn’t help but grin at the expressions Malfoy made as he watched, fascinated, as Harry poured paint into the tray and demonstrated how to use the roller.  He tried to keep his thoughts focused on what he was doing.  Unfortunately, Malfoy’s first attempts at getting paint on the walls are adorably disastrous.  How was he supposed to win against this?
“What wrong with Daddy?” Rosie asked.
“We made a beautiful little sister.” Lily whispered as the tears returned and streamed down her face.
Blaise shook his head at the two of them.  “Very well your highness.  One bowl of popcorn coming up.”
“He came out when I was twelve.  I was telling Al about it yesterday after you left.
“Your family is fucking weird.”
“He knows we love him.  Now where’s that hangover potion?  I want to spend the morning enjoying you in my bed rather than suffering together before your mother comes to drag us apart.”
“Fuck, this is harder than I thought it would be.”
Half an hour passed, then an hour.  Harry wasn’t coming.  It was better this way.  This was all the closure he needed.  Draco finished the last of his drink and stood up to settle his bill.  That was when he saw him.  He looked thinner than Draco remembered.  Tired in a way that Draco didn’t like.  Dark circles under his eyes.  They stared at each other across the room for several long minutes before Draco turned around and made his way towards the lifts.  He knew that Harry would follow.
“Thank you, Harry.  For everything.  You might not have been the best husband in the world, but you are the best friend anyone could ask for.” Ginny said, just before the two of them entered the fire and onto St Mungos.
“Everything you could possibly desire.” Draco replied and Scorpius got up and grabbed the bag of food and brought it over to the bed.  Harry watched as he seemed to fight with himself over what to do before eventually deciding to sit on the bed with Lily.  Lily leaned into his shoulder, still worn out from the effort of giving birth, as well as the overwhelming emotions she was no doubt feeling.  Harry got up and walked over to Draco.  He kissed him lightly on the lips before whispering in his ear.
“You’re being strong for him now.  And for little Draco.”
“Come on, let’s not let that unpleasant piece of crap ruin our day.” Hermione said.  It was worse hearing Hermione talk about Draco like this than Ron.  Hermione was usually more level-headed.  He knew she hated Draco, but he still hadn’t expected her vehemence.  He’d been fooling himself about how Draco would be perceived if he tried to reintegrate with his own society.
Harry quickly understood what his younger self wanted and summoned the toy dog he’d been playing with earlier.  Harry had seen it when he and Draco had been shopping for baby things and knew that little Harry had to have it.  It looked so much like Sirius in his animagus form that little Harry had immediately named it after his godfather.  Sirius had, of course, been delighted.
“You can’t be sure they had sex.  They could have just been friends, or maybe it was some work contact, an informant or something.”
“Draco tried to break it off just before I got married.  We’d tried before to stop, but this time he cut all ways of communication off.” Harry finished.  Andromeda was pleased to see he looked ashamed by what the two of them had done.  Draco did too.
“Harry, you have a pack of future brother in laws sat downstairs waiting for you to come down to breakfast.  This afternoon you are marrying their sister.  What the damn hell did you think was going to happen this morning?  That everything would change, and we could suddenly be together.  The Weasleys would have no compunction about lynching me if they knew I was in here.” Draco said this through gritted teeth.  Harry knew what he said was true. Today was the day the world would see him marry the girl everyone always expected him to.  It wasn’t what he wanted though.  What he wanted was impossible.
“Crap.  What’s wrong with him?”
“Hey, look at this.”  Draco said, reading the page the room had indicated.  “A confudus ward, mixed with a mirage.  That might actually work.”
“Of course you are.  Although you really need to come to Sunday lunch soon. I don’t know whether mum’ll forgive you if you don’t.  She’s fraught thinking that you’re wasting away by yourself.”
“That’s it, Tom.  We’ve got you.”  It was a different voice to the one before.  This one sounded more like the pureblood Slytherins who looked down on him.  The ones who hated him because he was a mudblood.  But that wasn’t right.  He wasn’t muggleborn.  The man in the shack… his… Uncle… He was a wizard. His mother… she’d been…..
“Don’t I…”  Malfoy was focussed entirely on his own hands.  Harry looked down at them too.  One of his fingers was now bleeding where he’d torn some of the skin off the side of his fingernail.
It was nearing the end of August and Harry was at his last day at the centre.  He had grown to love working here.  Seeing how each of the children had developed over almost the last year.  He was going to miss each and every one of them.  The last few months had been magical.  Since Scorpius had slowly come ‘round to the idea of him and Draco adopting the baby everything just seemed to fit into place.  It was like one of those puzzles where everything has to be at exactly the right angle before it pushed together.  Complete.
“Take this.”
“I thought not.”  Snape glared at him.  “You let me get in to far.  You lost control.”
As he didn’t have the kids with him, he apparated straight into Diagon Alley, bypassing the usual entrance through the pub.  He remembered the days when he couldn’t walk down this street without being mobbed by reporters, and crowds of people wanting to thank him for his defeat of Voldemort.  Now he walked through the street easily and headed straight for George’s shop.  It was still the same garish shade of orange, with purple thrown in to clash for good measure.  Walking in Harry saw it was pretty busy, but then it was Saturday lunchtime.  He walked straight up to the register and asked the pretty, youngish girl behind the counter if George was in.
“Draco dearie, you’ve been rather morose the last few weeks.  Anything wrong?”
“Because the don’t want to pressure us.  Because they want to give us an opportunity to spend a little time with her.”
“Stop that, little kitten. I’m not sure coffee is good for you.” The kitten looked crossly at him for a second, then seemingly deciding to forgive him padded back across the table and straight into Harry’s lap, where it promptly fell asleep.
“I will.  Good luck with your next meeting, I should be heading back before Robards accuses me of slacking off again.”
for being my beta for this chapter.
“We can walk.  You two in front of me.  And don’t think of making any sudden moves.”
The two of them made their way back through the house to one of the more comfortable sitting rooms.  Draco called for an elf to bring them a bottle and two glasses.  They made themselves comfortable on the rug in front of the sofa and sipped at the smoky amber liquid Draco had poured out for them.
Harry felt like he’d spent the last six months walking around in a haze.  He spent all his time play acting that he was happy.  Going to the Weasley’s for dinner every Sunday.  Ron and Hermione’s Tuesdays and Fridays.  Pub night with his old school friends Saturdays.  He did everything to pretend to his wife and family that all was well.  That he hadn’t made the biggest mistake of his life.   So he smiled and laughed with his friends and family.  Bought his wife little gifts to make her happy.  To make her not notice that he was avoiding spending time alone with her.  When they did have sex, which was rarely, he managed to focus on ensuring she was enjoying it.  He distracted her with pleasure.  He couldn’t let her see that how much he struggled to maintain an erection.  That he was never able to come inside her.  When she tried to talk to him about his lack of interest in sex, he blamed the trauma of the war.  It had only been two years since it had finished.  She seemed to buy the excuse, although it made him feel sick having to use the trauma of the war to cover up how he was really feeling.  He threw himself into his work.  Staying late to finish paperwork.  Volunteering to be on call at every opportunity.   Work was a good excuse.   Better than telling her that he didn’t love her.  That he was in love with someone else.  That their whole marriage was a sham.
Draco sat leaning against the bathroom wall and closed his eyes.  He also had a towel clutched tightly to his chest, in the same way he clutched a pillow whenever they watched a scary film, ready to bury his face in if things got too much.
“Thank you.”  Harry said before he walked out of the library and proceeded to make his way through the house, and off of the Manor grounds.
“So do you.  I can stay up with him a bit longer.  Don’t want to sleep until I’m sure he’s okay.”
“My mother’s coming home.”
husband had lasted more than twice as long as any of her previous ones.  He remembered the day two years ago when they’d dropped Callie off with Daphne and Hannah.  It was meant to be for a few hours.  Pansy had said she wanted to take them out for the day for a surprise and had arranged a babysitter.  It had been a bit of a shock when the portkey she’d provided them with had whisked them off to Italy and they’d found themselves witnesses at the wedding.  Draco had chastised Pansy fiercely, but she’d just laughed at him.  Somehow, she’d managed to persuade Draco to stay.  Not given him much choice if Harry was completely honest.  Daphne and Hannah had been in on the surprise and were expecting to keep Callie overnight.  They would contact them if anything happened and she had a portkey to take them straight back if it were needed.  But she wasn’t going to hand it over unless it was needed until at least after lunch the next day.  They’d stayed out there for a full day before Draco insisted they needed to get back to their baby girl, enjoying the sun and the beach, and drinking too much.  Celebrating their friends’ happiness.
To Harry, arriving in the Headmistress’s office, left him with a feeling of uncomfortable familiarity.  The sense memories of being called to the Headmaster’s office whilst he was in school, the feeling of anxiety like he was in trouble, whether he was or not, was overpowering.  This time it wasn’t him in trouble though.  It was his daughter, which was a thousand times worse.  He sat there, Ginny next to him, feeling completely devastated as Madame Pomfrey told them that Lily was pregnant.  He didn’t take much in after she said that.  Just sat there in silence as she talked about what she’d spoken to Lily about.  All the different options.  Harry couldn’t help but blame himself.  If he hadn’t drunk so much at New Year, he would never have let the two of them just go upstairs to Lily’s room.  He wouldn’t have allowed himself to get so distracted by Malfoy as to not even think about what they might have been up to up there.  Ginny, sat next to him, her pregnancy definitely showing now she was into her third trimester, looked just as overwhelmed by the news.  Harry had initially been a little concerned when she had popped through the floo less than 5 minutes after him, knowing what her healer had said about travel when they’d been planning to tell the kids about the divorce.  She had reassured him that her healer was really happy with her and the health of the baby now, and that she could travel by floo within the country, although not apparate.  After Madame Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall had said everything they wanted to say, they escorted the two of them down to the hospital wing.  Although it wasn’t strictly necessary for Lily to stay in the hospital wing, as despite the nasty morning sickness, both her and the baby were healthy, it had been decided that it was best that she stayed there until she’d had a chance to talk to both of her parents.
Draco thought about it.  It was actually one of the few topics he and Harry avoided talking about for the most part, but he’d seen the longing on Harry’s face, whenever one of their friends had announced they were pregnant over the years.  It was something Draco wanted too, but the reality of their lives meant it couldn’t happen.
“It could be worse, I suppose.” Harry answered.  “Scorpius seems nice enough and Lily seems to like him”.
“That sounds reasonable, but it doesn’t mean you can’t talk to me about it alone.  And I would like to talk to you about how you are Ginny are going to manage this too, which probably would be best without Draco.”
Teddy sniffed loudly before continuing. “When I was leaving, I saw this woman on a bench.  She looked really unwell, so I went over to her.  I wanted to help.”
“So even though Cousin Siri is pissed he’s still staying?”
“Draco.  I don’t know how to make it better.  Professor Snape will be done soon.”
“Umm… that Mister Potter comes into the Ministry for testing and clearance from any spells he’s under, and that Mister Malfoy comes in for questioning.  We also need to inspect the property for any dark artifacts that we believe are being used in order to entrap Mister Potter into this so called… relationship.” The last word was practically spat out.
Scorpius left the room then and headed back to the dorms.  He wasn’t sure whether Al would be there or whether he had gone back home for the evening, the same as Lily.  When he entered the 5
“I think you should get a phone.”
“You did.  Now what?”  Harry’s voice conveyed all the warmth and pride he felt.  From the outside it might have looked like a minor achievement, but it had been weeks in the making and even with his own inexpert observations, he knew what it had taken Malfoy to even attempt, let alone actually succeed, in this monumental task.
“Yes.”
“So you admit there’s something here then.”  Harry moved slightly closer, so their fingers were touching.
“Pretty good, I think.  Mum got me tickets to see Les Misérables for Christmas.  It’s the day before we head back to school, and I’m taking him.  Mum said she’d drop us off at the Leaky and let us go by ourselves. Lysander said he was really looking forward to it.  And, he’s going to stay over at ours after.”
Harry turned around to see his three eldest stood in the doorway.  It had been Lily that had spoken.
“I just popped in to see Neville and then got distracted enjoying the grounds.”
year, that had been permanently carried just behind every expression, and that had worsened after the war, was gone.
“You’re not ill.  Get it yourself you lazy prat.”
“Harry?” a voice interrupted his reminiscing.  Headmistress McGonagall was striding across the lawn from the castle “I thought it was you. What are you doing here?”
“Purple.  That pretty pinky purple.  And the floor.  We should change the floor.”
Draco using text abbreviations always amused him.  The proper pure blood using less than perfect spelling and grammar, in order to stick to the character limit of text messages, was so far from what most people thought of Draco. It was a side that no one but him really got to see.  He didn’t think about the fact that he’d kept the name of where they were meeting off his phone.  Draco did the same thing.  Nor that he hadn’t saved Draco’s number with any kind of contact details.  It was an unconscious effort.  He knew that what he and Draco were doing would be at best frowned upon, by not only his friends and family, but by the wider wizarding community.  It would also get not only him, but Draco into serious trouble with the DMLE.  So they kept their messages as untraceable as possible.  Each of them bracing for the day when their little bubble of happiness came crashing down around them.
Harry asks his friends how to fix his failing relationship.
“Yes.”
He counted down each day of the next weeks leading up to the wedding, dreading Harry messaging him, and hating himself when he felt disappointed when the end of the day came, and there was no contact.  The contracts with the Greengrass girl were coming along nicely.  She’d seemed pleasant enough when they’d been introduced again, he barely remembered her from school.  They’d walked around the Manor gardens and he explained that although he was happy with the plans to marry her, and to remain faithful, that he would never love her.  She didn’t seem as phased as he thought she would have been at the revelation he was gay, but then her older sister knew, so it was unlikely that she had been walking into this arrangement blind.  She would probably never love him either.  They would co-exist together in this house.  They would have a child.  They may even become friends.  But a true relationship was not something either of them was expecting from this.  His mother had known for years he was gay.  She’d tried to stop him from telling Astoria at first but couldn’t fault him not wanting to start a life based on a lie.  He continued to see his therapist once a week.  Having the impartial man in his life had done wonders for his mental health, even if he had decided he detested the potions combination and given that up within the first month, bar taking the anti-anxiety draught when things got really bad.  His life without Harry was moving exactly how it should do.  But still he couldn’t forget the man.
“Cousin…”
Lily has the baby
“My…my….” Lily hiccupped, dragging the courage to speak the words from somewhere inside her.  “My period is late.”
“Not for one second.  You and Draco are worth every little inconvenience.  And you put up with just as much from me as I do with you.  I think that’s part of being in a relationship.  It can’t all be butterflies and roses all the time.”
“Dance with me, Potter.”
“Is Draco corrupting you too?”  Blaise called from behind Harry.  Harry turned to see his other partner stood in the entrance of the kitchen.
“Who the hell are you?”  Sirius said, aggressively.
“Here.  I’ve some water for you.”
Andromeda looked at him fondly, and he wondered exactly what she was seeing in her face.  What she said next was a bit of a surprise though, as it was something he hadn’t considered.  “I worry about Teddy sometimes.  I mean… he’s a Black too.”
Hermione and Ron discuss the implications of Harry's confessions.
“Okay.  Don’t want Cake to be sad.  Can I play the pano now, Gramna?  Baise said when the sun was awake I could.”
“Would Mister Harry Potter be liking a glass too?” She glared at Harry as she said this.  Her eyes boring into him.  The elf was clearly unhappy about offering hospitality to the person that had just upset her Master.
“I…I….” And then Narcissa did something Andi was fairly certain she hadn’t done in years, at least not when any other person was there to see, and burst into tears.
“Well he doesn’t have to find it so hard this time.” Narcissa said, firmly.  It seemed now she was outside of Lucius’ control Narcissa wanted to mother everyone.  Harry was glad Narcissa was supportive though.  If she thought it was okay, Draco would be less worried about accepting the situation.  “Go get him Siri and we’ll be waiting back here.  Tawly.”  The elf popped up in front of her.  “Can you make a celebratory dinner for tonight.  We’ll be having a guest coming.”
“This is really weird.” Scorpius added.  “I guess we should go in and find out then.”
“You mean like that irritating little thing you have that bleeps and interrupts at inconvenient times.”  Draco had been very annoyed when his mobile had started ringing a few weeks ago in the middle of them enjoying a picnic out in the Manor gardens.  To be fair they’d both been naked at the time and Harry, rather than appreciating the delectable food the elves had provided, had had Draco’s cock in his mouth.  Harry had also been more than a little annoyed at the interruption.
“Anything for you.”
“No.” Harry pouted.  “I just wish you guys could come with me.”
Both of them froze.  Harry hadn’t meant it to slip out quite like that.
“No…. Fuck Potter… He left that bit out… That must have been awkward…” Malfoy smiled and chuckled slightly.
“It is making me feel a little ill the more I think about it.”
“I do sir.  He’s shown nothing but remorse for his actions in helping Lord Voldemort.  He has been accepting of going to a multitude of muggle venues and interacting with muggles in general.  If he still holds any prejudice against them, or muggleborns, which I don’t believe he does, he will not speak or act on those feelings.  He just wants to get on with his life.”  Harry wished, as he said these last words, that Draco and he could have the freedom to move forward with their lives they actually wanted, instead of this weak imitation.  That Draco’s freedom from the probation restrictions would mean he’d no longer have to walk around feeling empty.
“I know.”
Ginny had grabbed his hand at some point as they were negotiating the crowds to get the Flourish and Blotts.  Her hand felt clammy and uncomfortable in his.  He wanted to shake it off, but they needed to stick together in order not to become separated amongst the people surrounding them.  They eventually got to the door of the shop.  It took them at least twice as long as it should have done, and he was sure there would be speculation in the papers tomorrow about him and Ginny getting back together.  Complete with photos of the ‘happy couple’ holding hands if he was really lucky.  Hermione was about to open the door, when swung out in front of her.  Harry had to hold in a gasp when he saw the blonde head exit the shop.  He noticed the blonde man look down at where his hands joined with Ginny’s and cringed internally.  Draco didn’t look happy about it, and Harry wanted nothing more than to shake Ginny off.  Only how suspicious it would look, stopped him.
“Well… Fuck…”
“I know Lils.”  The shame he felt over his behaviour was almost overwhelming.
“So you are…?”
“But you’re here.”  Harry said, full of hope for what this might mean.
It was just him Draco and Scorpius sat at breakfast that morning.  Lily and Al had stayed with their mother, and James was at Grimmauld Place, as usual.  He’d told Ginny to keep Al till after lunch but send Lily through first thing.  First thing for Lily wasn’t so early these days though.  The house elves were just cleaning up the table when Lily stumbled out of the fire.
“It’s just about the tiredness, I’m sure it’s nothing.  Look I’m glad I ran into you.  I’ve been owling for a few days to see if you’d take Teddy and I was getting worried that you hadn’t replied.”
“No.”
“They keep you warm though.”
“Sure.  Hit me with your best shot.” Draco narrowed his eyes and looked at Potter with a slight thrill at the competition.  It was an odd competition, but something about it was making him feel a little better about how everything had fallen apart in the last few months.
“Heya, why’d you want me so early?” Lily yawned.
“Should we really be doing this?  I mean… Shouldn’t we be trying to find a way back, not trying to change things.  Time travel is stupidly dangerous right.  What if by doing this we end up… I don’t know… destroying the universe or something?”
“And got to start all over again.”
“Of course I love you, you prat.  And I know all about your exhibitionist streak.  I spent 6 months dealing with you publicly pawing at me across half the globe.  It feels different in England though.  I keep expecting someone to come over recognise us.”
“And will you allow one of the Ministry’s approved mind healers to examine you as well?”
Draco started sobbing silently against Blaise’s chest, unable to do anything else.  The pain had started easing off a little, but it was still nearly unbearable.  Then everything felt like it was on fire and that he was being torn into tiny pieces.  He heard screaming.  He didn’t know where it was coming from.  It was only as the blackness started to engulf him that he realised the person screaming was him.
A time skip backwards to where Harry left off.  Harry has spent nearly two weeks avoiding his problems so sets out to try and think productively.
“Fine I’ll open it.” Ron said, sullenly.  Hermione snorted; she could tell her husband was as curious as she was about this.
Harry made himself comfortable in the common room after dumping his trunk at the end of his bed.  He hadn’t felt like unpacking it, so he didn’t bother.  He grabbed a book to read but couldn’t really concentrate.  His mind was with Draco and Blaise in the Slytherin dorms.  Wondering what they were doing, and whether they missed him as much as he missed them.
“You know I can’t talk about what another patient says in their sessions.”
Draco took the phial and downed it automatically.  Harry kept Draco in a tight embrace until he felt his breathing calm.
“Where…”
“How do you know it’s not a small blonde kitten?”
“I asked the elves to clean the flat when I went through on my way to work yesterday.”
“This is all so confusing.  I remember he started acting a little strange in 5
“Blaise is just getting some lunch for us.  He’s making chicken and pesto toasted ciabattas with mozzarella.  I’ve reminded him not to put tomato in them.  I remember the hissy fit you threw the first time he made them for us and he accidently put tomato in yours.  Do you want some water?”  There was no response, not that Harry expected any.  “I’m going to help you sit up, okay.”  Harry eased Draco from the foetal position he was curled in up into a sitting position and arranged pillows behind him.  He kept his arm around Draco’s waist and summoned the glass of water that was just out of his reach.   He bought it to Draco’s lips and was pleased that he managed to get Draco to finish the glass.  When he was done, he sent the glass back to the bedside table.  He almost let the glass topple to the floor halfway through levitating it back when Draco leaned into him and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder.  It was the most response he’d gotten in days.    He let the arm around Draco’s waist, that was helping support him to stay upright, pull Draco in a little tighter.  Draco rubbed his head against Harry’s shoulder.  Harry wanted to look at him properly, to see whether the dead look had gone from his eyes, but couldn’t see from the position he was in.  Blaise walked in with a tray of food and potions.  He took one look at Draco and opened his eyes wide, before looking straight at Harry, enquiringly.  Harry gave a small nod.
before this one, although with a small amount of overlap to the start of this story
“No problems at all…umm, sorry I didn’t catch your name.”
“Want one?”
“Harry, tell us what happened that day?”  Hermione asked gently, earning her a scornful look of Ron, who had started angrily pacing again.  She needed to take over the conversation from Ron if they wanted to try and get some real answers.  His antagonistic questions weren’t getting them anywhere, and Harry wasn’t exactly being forthcoming on his own account.
“It went well.  Jam with a spoon?”  Harry raised one eye bow.
When Harry reached the living room door Teddy was bouncing outside it.  Impatient to start the present opening.  This was the first year where Teddy really got Christmas, and even if the child was a little over enthusiastic and exhausting, Harry was determined he would enjoy every second of it.  There was no way Teddy would ever have to experience anything like Harry’s Christmases at the Dursleys.
“Nope. And it’s your turn, love.”   Draco said smugly, smiling as he rolled over, still feeling blissed out from his own orgasm, and pleased that this time he wouldn’t have to leave the warmth of his bed.
“Fine, call them, but be quick.  I’ll keep watch.”
“Okay…Well you know now and that’s what’s important, and I can explain exactly what it means when we’re not stood in a park in the middle of the night.  For now, planning what to do next is more important and the first step is to go to Gringotts and claim the Potter Estate.  We then need to make sure we get back here in time to grab baby you tonight and find somewhere to hide out until my father’s arrest that’s safe and secure for us and the baby.  Then we take mother out of the Manor and get her to testify against my father.  When he’s sent to Azkaban then I can take over as head of the Malfoy family.  I’m sure there are other things as well, but I think those are the priorities”.
There was a pop of apparition and the gate opened.  Ginny and Trevor, Ginny’s partner, walked across the lawn laughing.  Their relaxed demeanour a stark contrast to the air of tension around the four adults sat together, watching the children in silence.  The happy couple came to a halt when they noticed the strange atmosphere around the family.
“I guess I just go in then” Harry muttered to himself.
“We’ve found a ritual we think will work.”  Draco said.  Remus, Sirius and Draco had spent the last three days madly researching ways they could finish Voldemort without harming either version of Harry.
“Morning, love.” Harry yawned as he pulled the half-asleep man next to him tight into his arms.  His head hurt from the amount he’d drunk the night before.  “I feel slightly shit.  Did you put any hangover potions aside?  I’d rather like to not spend the day feeling like some has removed my brain, wrapped it round a lemon, and beaten it against a rock.”
“I think I’d like Draco to take the documents directly.”  Harry said to the prim woman, unable to supress the grin that was now lighting up his face.
Harry snorted.  “Yes, I got my pretty blonde.  Sorry, I cannot for the life of me remember your name.”
“Pretty much.  Blaise and Mother helped us, and we’ve spent the last 6 months on an extended holiday touring the world.” Draco concluded.
Scorpius was lost in thought when he heard the door creak open.  He shifted, feeling stiff from sitting still too long, and looked up.  It was Lily.  She looked apprehensive as she walked in the room.  Scorpius knew he was messing up their relationship, but he didn’t know how to fix it.  Avoiding everyone and everything was just easier.  She’d come and found him though.  He knew that she wanted to talk about the baby, and the ridiculous plan their Dads had somehow come up with.  He also knew he’d just upset her if he told her how he really felt, and he hated upsetting her.  There just wasn’t any way avoiding it right now.  Not without literally running, and he knew that would upset her too.
“We have to do something with it.  Draco went a bit mad today.”
“Well there are certain things that you can’t offer me that she can.  Not that you aren’t a good-looking guy.  I just don’t swing that way.”
“Didn’t get much sleep last night.  And my hand feels like it’s been sliced open about a thousand times.”
“That’s actually a good plan.”  Harry replied.  He gave Blaise a quick kiss.
“Then you tell her to come alone and you meet her somewhere muggle.  You can go under glamours too if you want.”  Harry was sorely tempted at the suggestion to go under glamours but didn’t think it would be quite right.
“There just isn’t a good solution.  There’s this or leave things as they are and pray that the wraith never comes after him.  Keep him hidden away for the whole of his life.  That isn’t fair on him.  Nor on you.” Remus stated.
“And you trust this mind healer.”
“It does, there are some things I can’t explain and this is one of them.  But it’s important that we’re protected.”
There was a tone of alarm in James’ voice that Harry didn’t like, and Harry immediately stepped in to quash it.
“Okay.”  Harry yawned.  Rest sounded far too appealing right now.
“Yes.  I’ve seen the same books as you.  And still I absolutely and inequivalently say that he is not a monster.  He had, what at the time he thought were valid reasons for creating his Horcruxes, or at least the first one.  I’m not saying they were good reasons, but they were valid given the circumstances.  And the more he made, the less human he became.  By the end he barely even had a sense of who he was as a whole person, or what he had been trying to achieve in the first place.  I reiterate, he is a sixteen-year-old boy, who is too weak to do any harm to anyone right now.  He is petrified and he belongs to me and Draco.  He is just like us.  He had a shit childhood and that wasn’t his fault.  Hate Voldemort all you like.  But please…just… can you try with Tom.”
The day they all needed to head back to school Harry took the three teenagers to Kings Cross, James was making his own way from Grimmauld.  Draco had insisted that he actually needed to get some work done and stayed home.  They took the train from the village to the central London station.  Waving them off at the platform Harry felt sad that the holiday was over and that it would be months before he’d have them all back with him and Draco again.  He knew he’d be popping to the school regularly to take Lily to her therapy sessions and prenatal appointments, but it wasn’t the same as having them all at home.  He also needed to make sure he didn’t neglect Al and James, with so much of his focus on his youngest.  The dramatic changes in the family can’t have been easy on either of them, any more than it had been on Lily, but they seemed to be coping.  Harry was worried about Scorpius though.  He’d barely spoken to anyone in the last two days.  He knew Al, Lily and Draco had all tried but Scorpius just seemed to want to be alone.  Harry had had Lily crying in his arms last night because of it, thinking that she’d made the wrong decision.  He’d done everything he could to reassure her.  He hated seeing his little girl upset.  She’d fallen asleep eventually.  He’d just sat there with her cuddled in his arms on the chair, quietly contemplating all that had happened to lead up to this until Draco came to find him around midnight.  Draco had helped him lift Lily and carry her to her room.  He’d felt such a pull of affection towards the man he loved as he’d done this.  Harry had kissed Lily on the forehead as he tucked her into bed.  He then headed to bed with Draco and the two of them had spent most of the night seeking comfort in each other’s bodies.  Unwilling or unable to bring themselves to talk about everything that they were trying to deal with.
Draco has a phantom pain in his hand.
“Well, walking around corridors at night and bleeding is not a particularly good thing, even for golden boy saviours.”
“So, Teds.  Any particular reason you wanted to visit today?”
“You came.” Harry said, stunned, closing the bedroom door behind him and casting locking and silencing charms.
“It makes me think of what my Manor could be like.  Children playing.  Families enjoying days out.  Okay there would be peafowl instead of swans, but it would be nice.  Better that having one person rattling around.  Did you know the Manor house here is a hospital?”
“I really hope Blaise kept Teddy nice and distracted whilst we did that.  He may be a grown up now, which is completely weird to think about, but strangely enough, I don’t really want him knowing the intimate details of our sex life.  Particularly not the weird exhibitionists streak we developed somewhere around version two of the notice me not potion.”
“Lily was crying earlier.”
He put the half-eaten olive down on the plate next to him and ignored it.
“I’m doing well.  Pain is manageable and I’m pretty certain Draco will be talking again in another day or so.”
“Well you don’t have a choice about that, and you need to deal with it.  It doesn’t have to fuck up your life if you don’t let it. Right now you are letting it.  You know how upset you were when Lily was burying her head in the sand and shutting you out.  Do you think she feels any better now than you did then?”
“Harry you don’t have to.”
“You forgot to pick them up.  I should have you arrested for child abandonment.”
“You’re pregnant?  With his child?  Well you certainly wouldn’t have been able to hide that from me.”
“You’re not.  Besides, you’d have to go back through Grimmauld to leave, and… urr… we’re kind of hosting your sister there for the night.”
Harry drunk in the sight of the man he was in love with.  There was no way he could doubt how he felt now.  Being in his presence, he could breathe again.  No longer felt like he was drowning under the weight of everyone around him.  It was only now, in its absence, that he was able to comprehend the pressure his dejection and dissatisfaction at life was putting on him.  Even with Draco looking at him with coolness in his eyes, just being with the man, was enough for him to feel fractionally more alive.
“Fuck…”  Harry said, when he finished the passage.  “This is it.”
“How’s the essay going?” Scorpius asked, making Lily jump and have to collect herself before she replied, cheeks flushing.
“What you laughing at, Love?”  Harry said.
“Okay.”  Draco said quietly and then kissed Harry firmly.  “You are going to help me pick an outfit though.”
“You have nothing to be sorry for.  How bad was the flashback?  I know you had one.”
__________________________
“Yes, he sent us some signed first editions of a series of children’s book.  I don’t understand why you’ve suddenly come over so upset.”  He said, gently stroking her back.
“No” Draco managed to force the word out.
When Harry reached the door of the study, he was suddenly uncertain of what to do; of why he was here even.  He wasn’t even sure that he’d had a plan when he left the school for here.  Malfoy probably didn’t know about what had gone on between Lily and Scorpius yet and he wasn’t really the right person to tell him the news.  Before he had made a decision about how or even whether he was going to enter, the door pushed open and Malfoy was stood in front of him.
Draco stood up and walked over to Harry.   He tilted Harry’s face up towards him and gently kissed him.  It was sweet and soft.  Both of their tears mingle.  When he moves away, Harry feels bereft.  Draco walks out of the café without looking back or saying another word.
Harry wished he had something to throw at Blaise.  Teddy really didn’t need to know about that.  It might be fun teasing Teddy, but there were definitely some things his surrogate son shouldn’t be privy to, and that was absolutely one of them.
Harry opened the doors to the library.  Malfoy was stood behind him.  Harry could feel the fear radiating off the other man.  He turned around to look at him.
Harry moved and pulled Andi into a hug.
“Your son isn’t ready to see you.  And even if he were, this is the only way in or out of the Manor.”
“So you’re admitting your eating has gotten a little out of control then.  You really are doing better.  I don’t want to be grateful to Potter for that.  Although given he was the one who sent you off the deep end, I think I can still probably hold it against him.  And fine, but I expect to know when you are sleeping with him.”
“Of course, I won’t Mr…Harry.  I wouldn’t want to do anything that could hurt your daughter, or you.”
“No.  Don’t leave.  It’s nice to see the two of you doing this together.  It’s just hard.  I haven’t told anyone what happened.”
“Pansy, you’re dreadful.” Draco tried to play his feelings on the subject off as casual and wasn’t sure how successful he was.  “At least don’t go spreading this unsubstantiated gossip any further than this, you could get Susan, Theo and whatever friend you’ve heard the rest of it from into some serious trouble, not including the trouble you could get yourself in.  If they have split up and it’s not yet in the paper, they must be working very hard to keep it out, and if they haven’t, well then they haven’t…” he finished lamely.
“You went away.”  Draco repeated, this edge of panic in his tone still remaining, clinging as tightly to Harry as Harry cling to him.  Middle of the night panic attacks were always the worst.  Harry hoped that he hadn’t had too many of them whilst he’d been in the hospital.  Draco rarely calmed down for Blaise when he was like this in the night.  Harry remembered the nights when he used to wake up from nightmares too.  When his nightmares would wake up Draco with his own.  Blaise would be there trying to calm Harry or getting calming potions for the two of them, whilst Harry comforted Draco.
“I’m a foolish Gryffindor who saw how much it was hurting you to see your father lying there waiting to die.”  Harry had forgotten Lucius was still in the room by this point, but Blaise hadn’t, and he was watching the man’s face as his Son and Harry talked.
“I’m going to go.”  Draco said, despair still radiating off him as he stood to leave.  Harry reached for his hand again.  Trying to get him to stay.  Trying to undo the last 10 minutes.  For a second, he thought Draco was going to stop.  Their hands stayed joined for several agonising moments before Draco shook him off and ran out of the café.
“You are fucking Death Eater scum, Malfoy.  You don’t deserve any such considerations.”  Draco winced, it had been more than two decades since he’d been referred to like that, and time hadn’t made it any easier to here those words.
“Yes.” Draco said, non-committedly.
“I’ll write to Tara.  Do you think you can take you’re old meds?  We still have those in the cupboard.”
“A kitten, a small blonde kitten. The potion you were working on when I came here yesterday.  I well… well, I think I surprised you when I walked into the lab, and you spilt some, and then you were a kitten, and I took you home because I didn’t know what else to do and I wanted some time to think, and then you wouldn’t leave me alone and you fell asleep on my bed, and obviously the potion wore off and your clothes were still here and…..” Harry finally took a deep breath.
“I can’t believe you.  We were best friends and you just ran away.” Ron shouted.  Hermione knew her husband.  This was the anger that always came to the surface when Harry had been mentioned since his disappearance.  It was rooted in frustration.  In his own feelings of inadequacy as a friend.  Harry leaving Ginny had upset him, but it was the secrets and lies that had really hurt Ron.  That Harry didn’t trust him to tell him what was going on in his life.
“These” and she lifted her right leg and pointed her toe.  Scorpius felt his trousers start to become more uncomfortable as she did this, but the robes covered him this time.  Lily continued with a story he only half listened to, about the origins of her very luminous socks, something about a muggle cartoon.  His mind kept drifting back to his day out with the Potters and their friends in London, particularly sitting next to Lily in Regents park.  He’d had to pull his legs right up to him to cover that problem, stupid muggle clothing.  When Mr Potter had walked over with the hot chocolate it was all he could do to not turn scarlet with embarrassment.  Then there was the cramped position they had ended up in on the tube…  These thoughts were not helping with the uncomfortable feeling; in fact, it was growing.  He tried to gauge back into the conversation.
“I didn’t exactly plan to behave like a twat earlier.  It just sort of happened. I need to see Lily.  I want to apologise. I need to actually talk to her.  Is that good enough for you to let me in Rosie?”
Harry hadn’t thought about it like that.  He’d pushed Draco away all those years ago.  The memory was still painful.  This time he hadn’t shouted or said hateful things.  This time he’d given Draco platitudes.  There had been no sincerity in the words that he’d spoken. If it hadn’t been obvious to Draco that night, it must be now after Harry had sent no word to the contrary.
“Yes.  In a way, I suppose it does.  Does that seem strange?”
“Mmmkay.”  Harry mumbled, closing his eyes again.
“I see the shop is still going strong”
“Ron…” Hermione said softly.  “I think his actions seem to say otherwise and matching patronuses…”
The hangover the next morning had been spectacular, but he felt marginally better at having a friend know the whole truth about what had happened in the last year and half of his life.  Someone who took his side without question.  Parts of the story had certainly shocked him, and Blaise had been appalled when he’d told him that he’d all but encouraged Harry to get back together with the Weaslette.  But he hadn’t condemed Draco for his actions.  He’d also promised to be there whenever Draco needed him to help stay away from Harry.  With his friend there to back him up, Draco thought this time, he could actually manage the monumental task.
“We support them.  We love and bring up little Harry and little Draco.  We help make sure no one finds out about who Draco and Harry really are.  They have some plans to create new identities soon.”  Narcissa stated.
“Well how were we supposed to know what was going through his head every time he refused to play.  He never said it was because he was depressed.  He never told us he was unhappy.  He didn’t seem unhappy, not until those last couple of months.  If it were really all that bad, he wouldn’t have been able to hide it.  Or he could have, you know, told us.  Maybe then we would have been able to help.  This is just one more thing he didn’t trust us with.”
Hermione looked at her husband’s face and didn’t like something she saw there.
Rather than going straight back to his dorm Scorpius had joined Rosie and Al on the rest of their rounds of the corridors.  The two of them spent the whole time teasing him mercilessly and telling him funny stories of other couples they had caught whilst doing the evening Prefect rounds.  It had all been a lot simpler than Scorpius had imagined.  Al was definitely the best friend anyone could ask for.
“How did you control it?”
“Of course.  But why me?” She sounded nervous.
“No.   But I deserve that.”
“Pretty much.”
“But…”
Draco felt warm arms wrap around him, and for the first time in too long he melted into his mother’s embrace.  Nothing else mattered in that moment.  All that mattered was that his mummy was there with him.  And that they could both be upset over losing Lucius Malfoy together.  That his father had not been perfect, or even very good, didn’t matter. He and his mother had loved the man for all his flaws and they were upset that they would never see him again. No one else may truly care that his father had died.  But he and his mother did.  And that was enough for the moment.
“I’m fine.  It helps.”
Then Al started laughing and Scorpius couldn’t help but joining him.  The two of them ending up in complete hysterics.  When they finally managed to calm down Scorpius spoke.
Both Draco and Blaise agreed, feeling excited and caught up in Potter’s enthusiasm, even though they probably had more important things to do than this. Harry spent the next hour going over the basics.  When it came time for them both to try, they were surprised by the results.
“Lily, I’ve been arse.” He eventually said, breaking the silence.
“Right now, I don’t think you can do anything.  Me and Draco hope he’ll be strong enough for company in a few days.  I want to go back and sit with him soon.  Draco wants to brew some potions to help Tom recover faster, and neither of us want to leave him by himself.”  Harry responded, then he looked over at Sirius, and he knew his godfather wasn’t as willing as Narcissa to give Tom a chance.
“But…”
“Not a clue.”
“You didn’t.”  Draco exclaimed, and Harry heard him running downstairs to the kitchen.
“Draco, are you in there?”  Draco recognised the voice as Blaise.  He didn’t know how his friend had found him but was glad he had.
“Death Eater Scum… Failure…”
“Tell me about something interesting.”
“Isn’t that the same paper Harry usually uses?”  Ron enquired.  They’d received enough correspondence over the years for them both to recognise it.
“Nope.”  They answered in unison.
Scorpius was left alone in the classroom.  Mr Potter had mouthed the words “Thank you” to him as he carried Lily out of the room.  The whole thing had been one of the most awkward moments of his life.  First caught by Lily’s dad is a position that, although could have been worse, wasn’t exactly how he wanted his introduction as her boyfriend to go.  Then, when it was obvious that Mr Potter needed to have a serious conversation with Lily and he had tried to leave, she had insisted he stayed.  He was glad that he could offer some comfort to her, but he felt like an intruder on a private family moment.  Scorpius remembered when his Father told him about being gay.  He’d always known his parents’ relationship wasn’t exactly conventional.  They’d slept in separate wings of the house for his entire life.  When he was 12, before his mother had died, Father had sat him down and explained it all to him.  For his family the revelation didn’t change anything.  Father had told him that his mother had known from before they married that he wasn’t interested in women.  They had gotten married anyway because that’s what Pure-Bloods did when they wanted children, particularly back then.  Scorpius had accepted it and they hadn’t spoken about it since.
Harry thought about it for a few seconds and assessed his discomfort.  “Lavender.  It’s not too bad.  I’d rather a little pain than not being able to think straight.  I’ll have the purple one with dinner.”
“That’s my hoody you’re wearing.”  Draco said, and Harry turned to look at him.  He was leaning against the breakfast counter in the middle of kitchen, water dripping from his still wet hair and wearing nothing but a towel round his waist.
“Yours was the only place I could think of being.”
“Are you sure?” Harry had just walked out of one of the rooms and was stood at the top of the stairs.
“Well, don’t you at least get to run around chasing down evil Death Eaters and the like.” Draco was still trying to deflect.  It was like he was trying to remind him exactly who he was, trying to make Harry run.  He did this every time Harry tried to talk about the future of their relationship.  Harry decided to pretend that he didn’t know exactly what Draco was doing and continue the conversation as casually as possible.
“Food fights already.” Draco rolled his eyes.
“That’s going to be hard but you’re probably right.” Draco smiled down at him, his hand cupping Harry’s face. “Still, do you think you could stay here tonight?  Not for sex.  But just to talk.  I’m not ready for you to leave.  Not when you’re finally here”
“You two are dreadful.  If we’re not careful we’ll have another Ministry atrium incident.” Blaise grinned.
“I know you did.  And it was appreciated.  Is he okay now?”  Hermione whispered.
“Do you have any idea what you want to do?”
When they entered the room the toddlers used, it was crowded with small children, staff and parents.  He could see Tabitha with Hattie on her hip trying to sort out her bags onto the buggy.
“It doesn’t make me like him any better.  Nor Malfoy.  He may not have chosen to get back together with her, but he absolutely chose to stay with her after we all assumed that was what happened.  They used Ginny, and whatever happened that night, I don’t think Ginny could have realised how drunk he was, you said you didn’t.  She won’t have meant to have done it.  I know that doesn’t make it any better of a thing to have happened, but she’s my sister and I refuse to believe that she did it on purpose.  You’re right shouldn’t have acted how we did at the time, but Harry went along with it.  He didn’t tell us he had no desire to be with Ginny, instead he proposed, and they were married less than a year later.”
“Make it stop hurting…” Harry whimpered.
Harry tried to find the words.  How was he supposed to explain?  He and Draco hadn’t actually come up with a plan for this part.  It was stupid of them.  So Harry did the only thing he could.  He told the truth.
“For two?”  Draco looked at him speculatively.
Harry looked around to make sure the guard wasn’t watching and dropped the glamour on his ring.  The one he’d worn since the day himself, Draco, and Blaise had said their vows to each, deep in Gringotts and unknown to anyone but the Goblins.  As soon as Lucius had seen he quickly put the charm back in place.
“I’m sure.  How could Harry have known anything about old pure-blood properties and the protections in place?  He wasn’t raised like that and all of the secrets of those kinds of protections are closely guarded by the families.  Sirius wouldn’t have told him about them.  They never had enough time together.  Besides, Sirius rejected all of that.”
“Yes…” He managed to croak out.
“So, Ginny hasn’t told Molly yet?” Harry raised his eyebrows quizzically as he replied.
“Yeah, well it’s you Potter.  You always managed to get yourself in trouble somehow.”  Potter snorted at this, and it made Draco smile before he continued.  “I’m sure I’ll cope.  Just please, please, don’t make me go through this again.  I’ll wait here tomorrow with more of the healing potion.”
Draco immediately wrapped his arms around Harry and pressed their mouths together again.  It started out sweet and soft but quickly became more heated, tongues tangling together and hands grasping under clothes, both of them needing the skin to skin contact.
“Okay then.  Lily, you go ahead, and I’ll bring your mother through.”
“I know.”
Thank you to
“He was in my floo trying to get me to let him through.  I just wanted him to leave.  I knew I couldn’t have stood another rejection from him.  Not so soon after the last one anyway.  He was trying to tell me that that wasn’t why he was there, or something, and then… his face was screwed up in pain and I shouted at him and he couldn’t hear me.  I pulled him through, and it was like I didn’t exist to him.  That nothing existed to him.  I could see the pain wrapping around him and although he wasn’t making a sound it was like I was back there, hearing the screams.  I wanted to run away but I couldn’t leave him, so I just tried to comfort him in whatever way I could.  Eventually he heard me again.  I was so relieved to see the pain stop. Then it was like time back again, not to the war this time, but to us at Hogwarts in some forgotten room laughing and talking together.  Somehow, even though it was awful watching him like that, it made it easier for us to talk.  I want him.  I don’t think I can walk away this time.  But I’m so scared that he will.  It’s eating at me.”
“Not too tired for one dance with my fiancée.  It’ll be like we’re eighteen again in the clubs in Camden.  All the of the guys staring at your amazing arse and wanting you, whilst you only have eyes for me.  Then escaping when we couldn’t keep our hands off each other anymore, shedding clothes as we apparated back to the nearest bed.”  Draco said this whilst kissing Harry’s neck and jaw, one finger trailing down Harry’s spine and then skirting just under the waist band of his trousers.
I think this chapter really shows who Pansy is to Draco.  She is a seriously good friend.  She literally kicks someone out of her bed at no notice just because she can see her friend needs her.  I wish I had someone in my life like this.
“They can still see you.  I’ll explain another time.  Or not.  Contact me if you want to.  Oh and you should take the rest of that bottle of whiskey and share it with Ron.  It’s so much better than the swill they serve here.”  Harry replied.  Turning to his companions and no longer holding back the playful, if slightly mischievous looking smile. “Slytherin or Gryffindor then?”
“Ginny wasn’t feeling well and went home.  Ron and Hermione have appropriated a bottle from the Black collection of Champagne and are continuing their second honeymoon in one of the guest rooms.  I gave up any semblance of control at least an hour ago.” Harry replied sinking his head into his hands.
After class Draco, Crabbe and Goyle confronted the three Gryffindors and proceeded to insult them and take points.  Harry didn’t mind so much, although Ron was fuming.  Harry knew what the harsh words and points removed really meant.  Draco cared for him.  That Harry was the most important part of his life.  That he hated doing this.  At the end of the day, back in the room of requirement, Draco reiterated the true meaning of his words, with kisses in between each sentence.  He also gave points back for things Harry did that pleased him.  There was therefore great confusion the next morning when Gryffindor was equal with Slytherin in points.  Everyone knew that the inquisitorial squad had been ruthless when it came to the removal of house points, and no one could work it out.  Harry had to hold back his laughter at where the points had come from and was insanely glad there was nothing tracking the fact that Draco had given him 150 points for blow job, and another 100 for a back massage in the bath.  Maybe point allocation shouldn’t be done after a bottle of champagne.
Lucius looked up.  His eyes looked half dead, but there was still something there.  A small spark of fight left.  It was something that Harry could use.
“Yeah it was.  Let’s go in properly and we’ll raid the whiskey and get dry.  Or if you’d prefer, I can go down to the wine cellar and grab a bottle.”
“So you’re saying it was never really right between the two of you.”
“Your party.  Seems about right.”  Draco commented with a small snort and a shrug, but to Harry’s relief didn’t make any other comments.
Again, nothing.
Andi tried to make and excuse.  “It’s Harry’s.”
“I’m sure it will be perfect.  Now I do have one favour to ask.  Would the three of you be able to manage Teddy tomorrow morning.  I think I should have a word with my sister.  It’s been a few years since I’ve seen her after all, and I fancy catching up.”
Draco led back allowing Harry to slowly peel his pyjamas off.  He closed his eyes and let himself get lost in the sensation of Harry trailing kisses across his jaw, down his neck and then onto his collarbone.  The kisses didn’t stop there, Harry kissed, licked, and nibbled every inch of Draco’s body, and he could feel himself becoming more and more aroused.
“Now you’re getting really personal.”  Teddy said with a jovial tone.
Draco and Harry have spent the last 6 months having the time of their lives exploring the world.  Now it's time to settle down, but certain risks have to be taken first in order to ensure they can live the peaceful happy lives they both desire.
“Noble and Most Ancient.  Also Harry and Draco have a thing about cheap alcohol.  I grew up with it and it’s kind of stuck.  The wine cellar is original, and I really have no clue as to exactly what’s in there. The whiskey stock is whatever Harry abandoned here.  My family are weird, but I’ve learnt to love them anyway.”
“Well, that won’t do at all.  I will bring him some food as well.”
“I’m glad.  You thought about telling the rest of the family yet?”
When the 30
“You shouldn’t do that.  There is nothing other than this hideous treatment which is only really delaying the inevitable.”
“Harry… I’ve never done that before with another guy either.  I just did the things I know I like.  I’m sure whatever you do you’ll be great.  But if you want to watch and see what I like to do first… I’m not going to object to that.”  Draco kissed Harry and then knelt up and eased his pyjama bottoms down.  Harry had never seen another boy’s erect penis before.  He’d seen some of the Gryffindors in the showers after quidditch, but never like this.  He watched as Draco started slowly pleasuring himself.  If Harry hadn’t just come, he was sure he’d be painfully hard.  As it was his penis gave a slight twitch.
“How about we make a deal, urrr… sorry what’s your name?”  Harry Potter asks him.
“Hey.  It’s hard to be apart.”  Draco pouted.
The following article appeared in the daily prophet four days later.
Harry was pleased that Malfoy had decided to leave the library, although he was concerned the house elf had implied his Master wasn’t eating again. “Yes, I’ll go there.  Could you tell me the way and send us a picnic in about half an hour?”
“Can I talk to ‘Mione?”
“And if you say this is to do with your being disinherited then I am going to spend my copious amounts of free time in the library at Grimmauld place searching for a cure.”
Rather than getting up however, Scorpius pulled her back up onto his lap then and kissed her intensely.  He allowed his feelings and desires to take control again, though this time keeping his hands over her clothes. When they separated to breath Lily sighed, “I guess another five minutes won’t hurt” and she smiled before moving her mouth back to his.
“God, how much did you hear?”
___________________
Rather than Hermione answering the red head, who’d been silent until now spoke.
“Yes, you want to be done quickly.  It’s just I wanted to meet up with a friend and maybe do my shopping with them, rather than going round with you?  And then we were thinking about going for lunch” James said this rather hurriedly, as if he was scared, or embarrassed, of what Harry would think.  Harry didn’t have any experiences to draw on to empathise with how James was feeling.  He’d never had any real parental figures he’d needed to ask for permission to go off by himself and meet someone.  He’d only had himself to depend on and who cared where he was for most of the time when he wasn’t at school.  Ginny though behaved in a way, that to Harry, was very reminiscent of his experiences of Molly Weasley’s overprotective nature.  She rarely let any of the children go off by themselves during the holidays.  It seemed slightly ridiculous to Harry, given he had wondered freely in Diagon Alley without supervision from the age of thirteen, but whenever Ginny was there Harry tended not to fight with her, even though he felt much more laid back about the matter.
“But I don’t even know Harry Potter.  Why would he give me this?”  Rosie still sounded incredibly confused.
“Actually it’s Draco’s turn.”
They stood there in silence for several minutes.
“Don’t worry, it’s nothing bad.”
“Yes, I’ve been well Draco.  Take a seat and then we can talk about how you’ve been.  You look like you’ve lost a little weight.  Do I need to be worried?”
“It was fun. We should have more days out together.  Not necessarily with Teddy.  Just with the three of us.  We’ve never been able to go out on a date.  Do normal things people in relationships do.”
“And you and him have…?
“No… No…  it was really an accident.  Potions incident at home.  My boyfriend was injured, and a friend found him and…  That’s not why I’m here.”  Harry didn’t even realise he’d just outed himself to his boss, nor see the raised eyebrows that Robards gave Ron.  Ron gave Robards a pointed look and nodded in response, trying to make sure his boss didn’t make a big deal out of it.
“There’s a dusty attic somewhere in this place.  Send them there.”
“Fine, I’ll head out” Ron replied looking annoyed, though also seeming wary of the kitten.
“Not today.  Legs been playing up” Harry replied looking down at the stick to emphasise his point.  He didn’t really want to get into the whole reason he hadn’t been in with any of the other staff or volunteers.  Walking through to the office he knocked on the closed door.
“How are we actually going to manage that?  I don’t think you two should be out of contact yet.  Every time you stop touching at the moment, you both seem to regress.  You in particular Draco.  When Pomfrey is watching you eat, I can see you having to force it down, and that was with Potter in the room.  Potter can’t be seen coming back to the hospital wing with us.”
“No, the only Wizengemot hearing I got dragged before was for being a fucking death eater thinking that I’d be sent straight to Azkaban for the rest of my worthless life.”
Draco sighed and put his head in his hands.  “Yes. It’s in your scar.”
Sirius winced.  He really hated that house and his family.  There was a reason he ran away at sixteen.  He would do almost anything to avoid going there.  But if Harry needed him to, he would.  “My mother still lives there.  That will make it tricky. Not sure how one ended up their though.  I know Reg was a Death Eater, but as far as I was aware wasn’t exactly inner circle.”
“Sounds good to me, mate.”  Ron grinned at the suggestion of food
“Yes.  He’s going to be okay.”
“Sorry.”  Harry apologised.  His throat felt parched and sore, the words came out in a rasp.
Harry took one look at the message that had come in and with a look of horror crossing his face, abruptly stood up.
‘I think that sounds perfect.’
I know nothing much really happens in this chapter.  It's just a small glimpse into Harry and Draco's life together.  The story actually moves on in the next chapter, which is actually written, but needs looking over a few more times.
It was the weekend again and she and Scorpius had made a plan to meet in their usual room on the Sunday.  Al, Hugo and Rosie had promised to keep the others away.  She arrived first and started working on the homework that she’d either missed or only made a half-hearted attempt on over the last few weeks.
“I have an amazing father.”
Harry sighed and pulled back, shuffling to the edge of the bed so he could stand up.
“Hey mate.” Ron said as Harry sat down at the table.  “Been up to much today?”
“It’s a long story and I don’t want to explain all of this here.  It’s not my story to tell.” It was a half-truth, but all he felt comfortable with at the moment.  “Please come to the Manor for dinner this evening.  Bring your grandson too.  I’m sure Mother wants to meet him.”  She didn’t look sure.  He had to do something to stop her refusing.  This was for Harry.  Still without blurting everything out, which he wouldn’t do here, despite all of the precautions he didn’t know what else to do to persuade her.  A thought struck him. “Aunt Andromeda.  You probably know better than anyone why someone might want to run and leave their family behind.  Please trust me.  My family wants to reconnect with you.  We want you and Teddy to be part of our family.”
“Sounds… Delightful.” Justin laughed.
“Let’s go somewhere more private then….  Room of requirement?  I know you’ve been using it.  We can make sure no one can come in or hear us in there.”
“I should probably head back to Mother too.”
“None of your business, Malfoy.”  Potter spat, sounding much less friendly now he knew who exactly he’d bumped into and trying to ease himself up from the floor.  Malfoy noticed he was avoiding using his left hand to push himself up.  That’s when he noticed the dark splash of blood on the floor where Potter’s hand had been resting.
Blaise rolled his eyes.  “I’m going to go do some work in the office.  Come and get me when you’re done watching your trash.”
“That sounds great.” Lily sounded a bit sad as she replied, and he thought it might have been his mention of the holidays.  His first Christmas without his mum had been awful and he guessed Lily must be feeling something similar at the thought of Christmas without her parents together.
“This will cause a bigger media storm than the photo itself.” Harry Potter says, although Justin is sure that he’d not the one being spoken to.
Doris McFarlane still had offices on Queens Square in Bloomsbury.  It was in the Hospital for Integrated Medicine (which had changed its name since his last visit), accessed through an out of service lift on the 3
“I can’t help that I’ve fallen in love with you, Draco.”
“Fine.  Instant communication if we need you.”  Harry said, knowing that Blaise would not take no for an answer.
“Johnson just said it was important to the higher ups.”
“Lily, Scorpius came to talk to me and Al this evening.  He’s worried about you.”
“Yes.”  Draco opened his eyes and looked back at Harry, a bemused look on his face.  “You’re only wearing a dressing gown.”
“I’m far too comfy right now to move.”  Teddy said, nuzzling into Justin’s neck.  He felt warm, a little tipsy, and completely sated.
“’Mione, what’s wrong?”  Ron’s arms were around her, pulling her tight into a hug.  Everyone else had stopped passing round the books and was now looking at her confused and worried, but she didn’t care.
Harry had managed to get the key card to work and drag Draco into the room.  Then their mouths were on each other.  Draco’s hands tugged at the familiar shirt the other man was wearing.  He couldn’t believe Harry still had it.  He remembered abandoning it to escape before he broke down that day.  His fingers worked at the buttons.  He needed the material out of the way.  Harry had sensed what he was doing and pulled their mouths apart, shrugging the now undone shirt off his shoulders.  Draco lifted his arms up as Harry lifted the jumper, he was wearing over his shoulders and then made quick work divesting Draco of his shirt too.  The moved back towards the bed.  Harry sat Draco on the edge and then very deliberately knelt between his legs.  Harry’s mouth nipped, licked and teased as he worked off Draco’s trousers and boxers. Draco lifting his hips to help, staring down at this perfect man.  Draco let out a gasp as he felt the warm wetness surround his aching cock.   It didn’t take long before pleasure whited out all thoughts from Draco’s mind.
“And still… did you or did you not see me taking my fucking potions?  You can be a right prat sometimes, Potter.” It wasn’t the usual teasing way Draco called him by his last name, it was the sneering way he remembered from school and Harry hated it.  Draco knew Harry hated it. Sometimes falling back into their old school rivalry was too easy.  Even though Harry knew he was in the wrong right now, he couldn’t seem to stop himself from continuing the argument that had started out of nothing so quickly.
“Nice to meet you Victoria.  This is a really lovely tea shop.”  Hermione said, unsure what else to say.
“Bellatrix is an abominable woman.  How could you claim anything given to you by her?” Sirius still sounded furious.
“It’s okay.  It all felt… that was all lovely.” Lily knew she was telling the truth.  It was all lovely, although something was still nagging at her. She could still feel the tension that had built. Like something was unfinished.  But she didn’t know the words to explain that to Scorpius, or what it even really meant, so she let it go.
“You’re awake now, and coherent, that’s the important thing.  Dumbledore seems to think it was a reaction to whatever happened to make you see Mr Weasley being hurt.  Are you in any pain now?”
“He’s been doing it since he was eleven.  Why would he stop now?”
“Nice to see such fine young men acting so responsibly.  I shall leave you to your lunch.”
“Hey you.” Draco said with a kiss to his forehead.  “You ready to tell us what all of this is about?”
“I love you.  I wasn’t going to let them do that to you.”
“I think I pushed my leg a bit further than it was happy with, so it decided to bite back.” There were both tears and laughter in his words.
“I love you too.”  They were kissing again.  When they managed to take a breath for air.  “I promise.  I will never ever leave you.  Did I hurt him badly?”  Harry looked softly at the still unconscious blond in Blaise’s lap.
“Harry…  Fuck…”
They headed to the library.  Harry was amazed when he stepped in and saw the wealth of knowledge around him.
birthday.  The fact that I technically haven’t had my 15
“What do you think is wrong?”  Harry spat.
Harry glanced over at Draco who had tilted his head, seeming to indicate he wanted Harry to come with him to one of the more secluded spots of the library.
“Yes.”
“Wine sounds perfect, I’ll go get one of the elves to sort it.  See you when you get here.”
“I want to Harry.”
“Look Lee, what you and Ginny did was bad.  Saying that, I don’t feel I can exactly blame you entirely for mine and Ginny’s relationship failing.  That was down to me and Ginny.  She’s the one who should really be here talking to me.  I know I said I didn’t want to see her. I was mad.  I had every right to be mad.  But the two of us have nearly 20 years of life together to unpick and three children who deserve to have their parents at least on speaking terms.  The next few months are going to be hard enough as it is. “
None of them answer him.  They clearly weren’t expecting this question and if he’s reading the expressions on their faces right, he’s just stumbled onto what has the makings to be a massive story.
Draco really wanted to ask more, but the look on Potter’s face told him he should drop the subject.  It might only be a few weeks a year now, but Potter had said, they had always been like that.  Draco wanted to shove the picture Potter’s words had created in his imagination straight out of his brain.  Of a beaten starved four-year-old Potter with no means of escape.  It made him feel a bit like crying, which he wouldn’t let himself do.  Draco had always lived a pretty charmed life himself, this year being the exception.  Yes, his father hit him on occasion, or sent a well-placed stinging hex his way.  But it had only ever been Draco when misbehaved in some way.  That was perfectly normal, not like what he had the feeling Potter’s home was like.  It was only this year that things had gotten worse, and that was the insane snake faced bastard’s fault.  Draco changed the subject back to Potter’s hand.
“You abandoned him when you took that monster from the Manor.  Clearly that thing means more to you than little Harry.”
“I was lonely without you.”  Harry spoke softly, before coming into the room and putting his arms around Draco and kissing him tenderly on the cheek.
They sat their quietly then, Harry eating his chips whilst Draco watched and wished he could just take one.  He’d barely noticed how badly he’d slipped back into his old, disordered thoughts about food and eating over the last few months till today.  Clearly Doris had though.
“Thank you.”  Draco replied with a small smile.
“Seriously.  I inherited the bed here from Sirius.  It’s not that big a deal.  Well it is. But it’s… it’s just how it is.”
“Yes, Draco.  I’m here.”  Harry whispered to him; comfort Draco didn’t think he deserved radiating from his voice.  He accepted it though.  To not accept meant agony.
“Try and go back to sleep.   The ritual took a lot out of you.”  Harry soothed and stroked his hair.  “Me and Draco will be here when you wake again.”
“Harry, I don’t care about chocolates right now.  I care about you.”
“What you thinking about Lils?” Scorpius asked.
“Yes dear?”
“I do too.  He’ll be fine.  Go back and sit with him for a little bit.  I’ll make some lunch and bring it to you.  Hopefully, you can persuade him to eat something.”  They didn’t want to resort to tube feeding him again.  They all hated it when it came to that.  Draco tended to respond a little better to Harry feeding him than Blaise, so normally that task fell to him.  Not that either of them could get him to eat or drink much.
Harry pulled the duvet over him and got changed under the covers. Despite what he and Draco had just done he was embarrassed.  He hated his body.  Too small and with scars dotted everywhere.   When Harry was done, Draco crawled back into the bed next to him and wrapped Harry up in his arms.
“He’ll kill you.  He’ll kill little Harry.”  Remus pleaded, trying to reason with the two young men who had just thrown themselves in front of the bastard that ruined so many lives.  Who had killed two of his best friends only a few months ago.
“I’ve got a mobile.  I can give you the number.”
The use of his first name seemed to have been able to drag the other boy from his state of introspective despair.  Malfoy turned.  He turned to face Harry with his wand up and pointed at him.  His hand was visibly shaking.  Harry just waited.  Deliberately not making a move towards his own wand.
“I told Pansy everything that happened before she found me in the bathroom.  The whole story, including who I was with. She’s the first person I’ve ever told that too.” Draco confessed near the end of the session.
Draco pulled himself reluctantly out of the warmth and comfort of his bed and made his way down the corridor to Callie’s room.  When he got there, she was bawling her eyes out, her right cheek was puffy and bright red.  He accioed the Calpol, that Harry had bought from a muggle store.  There weren’t any pain potions that were safe for babies this age and Harry swore that the muggle version worked for teething pain.
“He shouted at me for a while, told me about Lucius, then shouted some more.  I don’t think it was the quitting that was the problem so much as the reasons why I quit.”
“The Manor is in lockdown then.”
“So, you promptly left and downed a bottle of wine by yourself at the Manor like the complete prat that you are?”
“Yes.”  His guilt over how much he’d hurt Angelina had been weighing on his mind almost as much as Lily and Draco had.
“Well, don’t you two look well-rested and completely gorgeous.”  Blaise said, as Harry and Draco walk through the gates of his villa.
“Don’t hurt yourself.”
“Dromeda.”  Cissa looked pained.  Her expression one of deep regret.  “Cutting you out of my life was one of the hardest things I ever did.  I remember when I was pregnant with Draco and being so scared.  And Mother and Bella were useless. You were the one I wanted to sit me down and tell me it was all going to be okay.”
“He’d do that for you too, you know.”
“No, you’re not.  And even if you are, I don’t care.  You’re mine and I wouldn’t have you be anyone else other than you.”
Harry got out of the carriage first and held out his hand to help Draco down.  He remembered the last time he’d been here, helping Ginny out of the carriage, and his feelings couldn’t have been more different.  He’d felt completely uncomfortable in his own skin back then, with a knot of anxiety about the stupid mistake he was about to make, about how he was shutting out any possibility of a happy future.  He wasn’t exactly looking forward to the stares this evening, and he still had a knot of anxiety.  But at least this time, he knew when he left and went home, he’d have someone he loved and respected to laugh about it with.  Besides, if Blaise got his way, there would be plenty to laugh about.  Teddy bounded out of the carriage next, with all the enthusiasm of youth, shortly followed by Blaise and Pansy.  The student stewards didn’t seem to have noticed who had just arrived, yet.
“You know I don’t mind which, but given your mother seems to be out still and Al and James prefer white, we can go with that.”  Ginny always disapproved of white bread, but then she would probably also disapprove of the large amount of butter, salt and cream he had mixed into the eggs, as well as his failure to trim the fat off the bacon.
“We’re not eating jam for dinner.”  Blaise chuckled.
“Another week and it will be completely secure.”
At 3 o’clock Pansy was dressed and ready for the meeting she hoped Potter would show up to.  She’d selected one of the quieter bars she and Draco liked to frequent in Covent Garden.  At this time in the afternoon they should be able to talk in piece, and in the muggle world there was much less of a chance of them being spotted together or overheard.  Meeting in a wizard bar would have just led the papers to decide that the newly single Potter was going to be her next husband.  She walked up the stairs and then out on to the rooftop seating area.  Potter was already there.  He looked a state.  Unshaven in clothes that looked like they’d been slept in, though she was almost certain that wasn’t the case.  The dark circles under his eyes seemed to be a testament to the fact that he’d had even less sleep than her in the last 24 hours.
“I didn’t think I had any other choice.” Harry admitted. “Everyone told me that that’s what I was supposed to do.  Draco had left me.  What else was I supposed to do?”
“You work a dangerous job.”
“I think it’s best that you don’t.  So that’s one of the reasons why Draco’s inventions are not for general public use, and we sure as hell aren’t going to let the Ministry know about them.”  Hermione had been thinking about the possibilities if the DMLE had access to Malfoy’s work.  She almost started pressing Harry on this but realised before she started speaking that they definitely had good reasons for not wanting to share them with the Ministry.  She decided to go down a different route.  If she was going to get to know Harry making him angry wouldn’t help.
“I should probably get going.  I need to write to Ron and Hermione and see if they can come over tomorrow.”
Harry left Molly in the kitchen and went to the living room where the rest of the Weasley’s that were here had gathered.  He felt slightly proud of himself for walking away before he and Molly started truly arguing.  Everyone did fuss over Teddy, and it did take a bit of the attention off him.  Still it was loud here.  He’d almost forgotten how loud it was.
He opened his eyes and was surprised to find himself on the rug in front of the fire in the small sitting room attached to Draco’s suite, his head in Draco’s lap.  The flames of pain that had engulfed him seemed to be abating but he didn’t trust touching his leg, let alone putting any weight through it.
Harry closed his eyes then.  Picturing Draco carving their names into the wooden pillar in the far corner of the room.  Seeing the two of them curled up under the large silver and green blanket Draco had brought down there.  Harry thought back on these happier memories of the room.  He told Doris about all of this.  Trying to work his way up to the fight and the pain that room flooded him with now when he thought of it.  Although he and Draco had shared a bedroom in eighth year, they had both been too scared to do much there.  The proximities of their respective friends, and their propensity to come in without knocking made it too high risk.  Instead they had used a series of empty classrooms around the castle before stumbling on the long-abandoned room near the kitchens.  Draco’s transfigurations skills meant that they had been able to make the room relatively comfortable, and they had managed to sneak a few pillows and the large blanket down not long after they had claimed the room as their own.  Down there they could lock the door, knowing that no-one would disturb them.  This room was their safe haven to touch and talk in without having to put up guards.  Draco had carved their initials into the pillar just before the Easter Holidays using Harry’s wand and not wearing anything, whilst Harry had been lying exhausted on the sofa completely spent by their afternoon’s actives.  That was one of the best memories.  Two weeks later it had all gone wrong.
Harry sighed, but acquiesced, and held out his hand for Draco to take.  Refusing Draco anything was becoming increasingly difficult.  Before he even had time to become nervous and start tripping over his feet, Draco was twirling him round the room.  There was no music, but it didn’t matter.  The two of them danced round the room like they were the only two people in the world.  There could have been crowds around them, a full orchestra, and Harry wouldn’t have noticed.  The only person he had eyes for was the beautiful man leading him.  They were taking back the Manor.  Claiming each room with love and happiness.  He pulled Draco into him stopping the dance.  They were both slightly out of breath, but their eyes stayed fixed on each other, bright and sparkling with the joy they shared.  Their mouths met, and with the competitive edge that had dominated their relationship when they were at school, they were each tugging at clothes and pulling each other to the floor.

“Malfoy.  Your time is up.”
“Oh.”
“Probably.” Although Potter didn’t sound sure for some unknown reason.  “Look, why don’t you go to bed.  I’ll stay here and soak my hand and head back up to the tower in a bit.  You don’t need to wait for me.”
When he got there the woman that was stood the other side of the gate was looking incredibly annoyed at not being able to stroll in, and probably for the wait for someone to greet her once she realised she was stuck on the wrong side of the fence.  She was familiar, and not entirely unexpected.  Harry remembered the last time he’d seen her.  At Draco’s trial, where she sat with white knuckles clenching the railing in front of her as the verdict was read out.
“That may be, but there is a whole day ahead of us, and we can’t just stay here.”
Harry internally flinched.  He knew if he was asked, in the heat of the moment he would say yes.
“Can any muggles see us?”  Teddy was looking nervously around, scanning the area and how secluded they were in their little hidden away back table.
“I can think of a way to make it better.” Harry replied, moving his hand seductively up Draco’s bare leg.
“Go on, you go through first.”  Harry said with a fond smile.
“I’m tired.”  Draco said, snuggling further into Harry.  “Can any more planning wait until the morning, or do you need to go fill your Gryffindor friends in?”
Harry recast his patronus and sent it off up the hill to get the others.
“Still yours though.”
“So Gryffindor loses a few points.  I don’t give a damn about the house cup.”
The room let out what Harry swore was a small cough, and a fireplace that hadn’t been there before appeared, complete with its own little pot of floo powder.
“Well he is literally part of your family.”  Harry snorted and shoved at Draco playfully.  “I always thought some of his behaviour was because of Azkaban, but it seems he was just odd all along.”
“Yes.”  There was nothing else Blaise could say.  He couldn’t lie about this to Harry.  There was no way to soften the blow.
“Why too much time?”  Teddy asked. Justin realised his brain had forgotten to stop him blurting out too much information.  It was something he did, especially when he was nervous.  It was one of the reasons people thought he was odd.  One of the many reasons.  He sort of wished he could avoid answering, not wanting to look like a complete fool in front of the attractive man but couldn’t think of a good way to get out of it without appearing rude.
“Harry!”  Hermione exclaimed.
“I guess.  Couldn’t do the sodding charm before anyway.  I don’t exactly stand a chance of getting it now, do I?”
“He did?”
“Since the summer before eighth year.”
“Do you want to know what I talked to Doris about today?” Harry said, stroking Draco’s hair.
“Two weeks, Harry.  I had two weeks of not knowing anything other than what the papers said.  They said you died.  Then that you were in a coma.  I couldn’t contact you.  I couldn’t be with you.  What if you…. “
“Hello, Love.”  Harry said as calmly as he could, despite being a little out of breath with the speed he’d raced here.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry in what had become a familiar and comforting gesture over the last week.
“Malfoy.” Harry whispered and moved his thumb, kneading the area on Draco’s thigh he was touching.  Several long seconds passed.  Harry was holding his breath. Willing a Malfoy to do anything.  He let his breath out in a rush when Malfoy slowly turned his head down towards him.  Now Malfoy was looking at him, he could see tear stains on his cheeks and the tell-tale red puffy eyes that spoke of hours crying.  Harry stood, keeping his eyes fixed on Malfoy’s.  He lifted the blonde man from the chair and sat down, easing Malfoy into his lap.  He pulled Malfoy into him, wrapping his arms around the too thin frame.  He found himself stroking blond hair.  Harry didn’t say anything, just let Malfoy relax in his arms until he eventually fell asleep.  Harry felt his own eyes become heavy, the weight of his own sleepless night pressing on him.
“Draco today.  I would quite like to talk about Lily and Scorpius with you and Draco together.  We decided that if we’re going to try and make this relationship work, with everything else that’s going on, we should probably try and tackle that situation together.  With Ginny too I suppose, although Lily’s not exactly happy with her mother right now.”
“It’s fine.  There’s too much for the healers to eat anyway.  I’ll be less than five minutes.”
“I think I did.  I forgot how much I missed it.  I forgot what it was like to walk around and be recognised by someone, even someone who barely knew us.  She might not have known our history, but she still was happy to see me and Harry together.  I want that.  I want people to see me and Harry together and be happy for us.”
“So am I.  And besides, you’re our mess and we wouldn’t change you.  Let’s go find Blaise and apologise to him, all right.  I for one don’t think this is the right time to start dwelling on things.  Tara will be here tomorrow, and we can talk about all the maudlin crap we need to then.”
“No.  I’ve been wracking my brain for days but can’t think of anywhere.  We don’t even know where he’s been staying since the end of the war.  He has a home somewhere, but he’s never told us where, nor even hinted as to where it might be.  I’m guessing it’s the same place he used at the end of 5
