“They’ll be mad. Fuck that, they’ll be hurt,” Draco says. Harry doesn’t think Draco really cares about that. The growing seed of doubt that’s taken place in him twitches at the thought.
“Fuuuck…” Ron said, dragging the word out and looking at Harry with a shock written all over his face. “That’s – wow.”
“Hmm,” Harry says. He wonders if he’ll ever find one of Draco’s good Doms. If anyone could ever do anything that would feel as good as leaning against Draco while he rubs soothing circles into his back. He wonders how he’ll ever get over his stupid
“Almond is fine. And I need you to swear to me you’ll use it. If I’m crossing a boundary, or you think I might be about to. Or if anything feels off or uncomfortable. BDSM is all about trust. You need to trust me to respect your boundaries, and I need to trust that you’ll use the safeword if the situation calls for it.”
“I used to feel lost, looking at the stars,” Draco says. Harry jumps, having been so lost in the twinkling above that he hadn’t heard Draco come outside.
“Oh,” Draco says. He sounds surprised, and Harry can’t help but wonder if it’s because he doesn’t agree that there is more, or if it’s because he’d never thought Harry would want to say it out loud.
“Depends.” Harry shudders with the memory of the last place Ginny had taken him. The music had been so loud he couldn’t think, and the floor had been so sticky he’d worried he’d be stuck there for days. “Is it one of those awful clubs?”
“I like when I can feel it, I’ve been using that blue bondage-rope you sell here with Ron. It’s got the perfect amount of friction.”
"You just don't like me. You don't mind anything we've been doing but it feels the same as if you'd have done it with a stranger or at least with any one of your friends." Daniel sounds defeated. His tears have stopped but somehow he looks even sadder without them. Harry wishes he could tell Daniel he’s wrong, but he can't so he stays silent.
But fresh tears are escaping Harry’s eyes and blending with the melting snowflakes on his face and he can’t let Draco see how selfish he is.
He goes into the office the following Monday feeling just as relaxed and well rested, and the lights in their office don’t seem too bright at all.
“Are you just going to live in Ron and Hermione’s cabin forever then?” George asked, laughing and patting Ginny roughly on the back.
“We’ll have to bring Ayla, of course,” Draco says. Harry knows he’s trying to sound casual, but his eyes are shining just as bright as Harry imagines his own are. Harry knows he’s missed the closeness he had with Pansy, and he must be feeling the same rush of joy that Harry is, knowing he’s missed and loved.
“Not sure it counts when it’s never more than two dates and when you don’t even try to let them get to know you,” Ron said, giving Harry a sympathetic look.
Draco is standing in the doorway of the balcony with a self-satisfied grin. Alya is sniffing at the door and trying to make her way out between Draco’s legs, but Draco doesn’t let her pass until Harry’s caught up. Only then does he move out of the way to let Harry see what he’s done.
Harry’s sure the dreams would be survivable if he could have them in the privacy of his own room. There he would feel safe enough to actually
Malfoy gets his trousers half off before he curses and gets off Harry to remove them completely. Harry kicks his jeans off and turns to look as Malfoy slowly pulls his pants down too, revealing his erect cock.
“That can’t ever happen again, ever.” Draco’s voice is so fierce and determined that Harry can’t help but look at him.
“Sorry,” he laughs. He looks at Daniel and he smiles, pulling Harry back towards the sofa. Harry doesn’t like to look at him – he’s never liked looking too much during sex. It pulls him out of the sensations and into somewhat panicked thoughts of ‘
Five Cuba Libre’s later Harry feels relaxed and happy, smiling and pointing out girls he thinks Ginny should go talk to. Ginny returns the favour by pointing at various boys she figures Harry should go kiss. When she points to someone who looks suspiciously like some bloke Harry thinks might have been in Ravenclaw he frowns.
Ice rushes through Harry's veins when he remembers Matt. He has to tell Draco. Even if it means losing Draco, his job, and his dignity. It’s not his secret to keep anymore.
Pansy practically bounces into the sofa to sit between Harry and Draco, holding her hand up to Draco to show off the ring that perfectly matches Ginny’s. “We’re getting married.”
He doesn’t let go when he’s done. Instead, he quietly urges Harry to let go of the metal bar and lets him rest back against him like they’d started. Harry thinks he’s being shown off. That Malfoy is holding his spent body up for everyone to see, like an artist would show off a painting. Come is running down Harry’s stomach, and he can feel it starting to escape out of his arse too. Malfoy must realise too because he turns him around so the audience can see.
Ron looks suddenly thoughtful, and he chews his lip so hard Harry’s afraid for a second it might bust open under the pressure.
Ginny grabs the pillow from beneath Harry’s head to smack him and Pansy with it. “Stop it, both of you. What’s wrong Harry?”
Harry looked up to avoid seeing the reaction to his words on his friends faces and noticed it had gotten almost dark around them. Despite his atmospheric charms the air in the garden was getting cold with the sun mostly gone so he summoned firewood and got to work making a fire in the firepit.
“They already know,” Draco snorts. “I know it’s been a couple of years, but I’m sure you remember Weasley walking in on us.”
Every time his brain got too loud, he dropped what he was doing and sat down to write in his journal, forcing himself to make sense of his thoughts and challenge them.
“Beautiful,” Draco hummed. Harry blushed and jerked his hips a little, groaning when it brought his aching cock into contact with the bed.
“I’m not sure that makes me aromantic though. I have a lot of love, for a lot of people, and isn’t love just love? Isn’t that a whole slogan and shit? Love is a feeling you have for people in your life, and it’s different of course. I love Ginny differently than I love Ron and different from how I love Teddy, but it’s all just love.”
Harry shivers as the words are spoken gently against his ear. He’d woken up achingly hard from a dream just an hour ago and listening to Malfoy’s thoughts about his body is making Harry’s erection return at a frightening speed.
“Fuck, Malfoy,” Harry says, breaking off into a moan and forgetting the rest of his sentence. He hears his moan echoed across the room as his audience reacts to Malfoy’s words too.
The bracelet on Harry’s wrist feels heavy like it carries all the differences between friendship and love that Ginny explained. All the differences Harry doesn’t feel. Daniel isn’t his Pansy, Harry doesn’t feel what Ginny does. He doesn’t feel a damn thing. He could probably love Daniel as a friend, the way he loves Ginny and the way he’s starting to love Pansy and even Draco, but he’s been trying so hard to make the relationship something else that he just feels empty.
“Draco darling,” Pansy’s voice rings from downstairs. “Do come in. I have a layabout Bi Disaster in my layabout girlfriend’s bed. I need you.”
. Alright so he’s attractive as fuck, and it would be a lot easier for Harry if they just started having breakfast together, but he shouldn’t be hurt that Malfoy doesn’t want to. Just like he shouldn’t have been hurt after the war when Malfoy rejected his offer to get a pint. He can admit that Ron had a point about being attracted to Malfoy, but Harry does not and never has had a
Harry looks at them and knows he’s about to lose them to the privacy of their bedroom. He’s happy for them both, they make each other glow with happiness and want and he suffocates the twinge of jealousy he feels for them being able to have that and basks in their happiness instead.
He exits the bathroom quietly, hoping Draco won’t come rushing back up now that Harry’s left the bathroom. When he doesn’t, Harry gets dressed. No more excuses, he thinks, time to face Draco. He doesn’t let himself consider how his life is ruined. How he might as well take Matt up on the offer to sell drugs, or his arse, because when Draco knows, Harry will have an Auror partner who can’t bear to look at him.
He forgets about the state of his kitchen until he’s leading Draco through the door. Piles of dirty dishes fill the sink, and his stovetop is full of used pots and pans.
Draco drops down next to him in the memory, and Harry works hard to keep his breathing even and his face blank.
The sound of his name startles Harry, and he’s not sure if Malfoy said it or thought it, but it doesn’t matter. He needs Malfoy’s mouth on his neck, on his ear, breathing and licking and biting. He’s been so close to that for weeks now, and he needs it for real.
as he ushers people out the door. Only when the sound of footsteps stop does Harry stand and turn to look hungrily at Malfoy as he closes and wards the door.
Harry laughs. “That just means we’ll have to work twice as hard, or we’ll be accused of favouritism.”
Draco suddenly looks sad. “I like being outside, and right after the war outside felt like the only place I could breathe. Except I had a lot of trouble being in public because I was terrified someone would come see me and know what I did during the war and attack me or something. So I couldn’t really relax outside either.”
Harry spent a lot of time thinking over the conversations he’d had with M and Ron and Hermione about his ‘job’, both in his head and in his journal. M had had such a different take on things that it had thrown Harry completely. He’d been told to care for himself plenty of times, but it had always been in the setting of ‘help yourself to help someone else later’. Molly had told him ‘if you don’t eat how will you stay alive to feed others’, Ginny had said ‘you can’t save everyone, and if you let the guilt of that kill you, you won’t be around to save anyone’. They were good sentiments, of course, and at the time he hadn’t been ready to hear anything else. M though, had gone and said, ‘save yourself because you deserve to be saved’ and ‘help yourself because your responsibility is to yourself’. To Harry it felt like a radical thought.
He feels Draco take his hand, and hums softly in appreciation when the cool towel is rubbed over his wrists, soothing the slight soreness there. Draco keeps going, taking his time running the towel softly down Harry’s arm, across his chest, down the other hand to his wrist. He brings the towel back to his chest and moves it down, cleaning the come off Harry’s belly and the lube from between his legs.
Harry barks a laugh. “Not sure my comfort matters much when you can’t even look at me in class. Kinda makes it hard to teach me, right?”
Draco’s trousers fell to his knees when Harry got the buttons open. He still had his shoes on, and Harry didn’t have time to take them off to get the trousers off properly. He felt a rush to keep moving, to keep exploring the man in front of him. Draco’s pants were soft, and the same colour blue as his shirt. His cock made an impressive tent in them, and a slowly growing wet spot made Harry’s mouth water.
Draco leaves the room without waiting for Harry’s reply, and Harry takes a minute to rub his tired eyes. Having the case to focus on helps, but Harry’s brain is slowly overflowing with thoughts and worries that he can’t seem to suppress. His skin seems to be itching for the sharp sting of pain and the roughness of letting go. He’ll go to the club tonight, he decides, when they finish interviewing Martin. Smiling with the relief of his decision, and the direction of having another lead to follow, Harry grabs his jacket and follows Draco.
“There’s this new dating site,” Ron said, “For the Pocket Computers we sell at the shop. Or the Po-cuters as George insists on calling them. Pictures and names aren’t allowed so you can get to know someone before seeing them.”
“I want to be close,” he says. “I want to feel you – to know that we’re ok. To know for sure you’re not going to change your mind and just leave me.”
“I’m angry that you went undercover without me last night,” Draco says. “And I’m angry with myself for not trusting my gut last night. And I’m angry that you’ve been doing this for years without telling me, and with myself for not realising. I’m furious with the Doms you’ve been with that they haven’t taught you any of this. I’m furious that the way you grew up has made you think that you can’t get what you want and need without suffering for it.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said, giving Harry a sympathetic look. “You didn’t deserve what Alex did. He was full of shit; you’re not a disappointment at all.”
“Does that mean we can fuck?” Harry asks, slapping his hand over his mouth and laughing when he realises what he’s said.
Ginny goes to get them more shots and drinks, and the night turns blurry. Music flows in Harry’s veins along with the alcohol as they make their way downstairs, dancing and swaying to the beat. Ginny lets a dark-haired girl swirl her away from Harry, and Harry grins when he sees them kissing minutes later. Without Ginny though, he’s alone on the dancefloor, and being alone on the dancefloor always means anything but loneliness. Bodies push close, and he sways along with them.
“So, I’ve been using that dating site,” he said, and grinned when Hermione and Ron talked over each other in excitement to hear about it.
In response to Harry’s question Draco stood from the table so fast his chair wobbled and almost fell to the ground and used the hand that was holding Harry’s to drag him to his feet as well. They stood close. Close enough that Harry could see the faint freckles on Draco’s nose, and how his pupils widened at their proximity. They breathed hard and fast, and Harry could feel his chest brush up against Draco when they both inhaled at the same time.
to have Szechuan beef. I’m sure you weren’t even hungry, but you smelled the food and suddenly you had to have it. Ginny makes me feel like that all the time.”
“Alright, go on,” Draco says. Harry’s eyes follow Draco’s circling finger up to his hand and his muscled forearm.
Harry breathes a surprised gasp at the whisper in his ear. It’s different to how it had been with the bond, more like it’s coming from Draco himself than some disembodied version of him standing behind Harry.
An hour and some paperwork later, Harry and Draco bring Ayla into their flat and laugh as they watch her run excitedly around and smell everything. Harry busies himself setting up a bed and a bowl for her, and Draco disappears onto the small balcony Harry never uses. Harry goes to fill the bowl with food, and the second the first bit of food hits the bowl Ayla comes running so fast she skids right past Harry and into a kitchen cupboard.
“Draco, they’re wrong. I promise. Merlin, I’m in love with you!” Harry says, desperate to make Draco believe him.
“Harry, you coming to dinner?” Ron asks. He doesn’t open the door, even though it’s unlocked. This small act Harry fills with warmth for his friend. For how well Ron knows Harry and his need for having his own space; the need to be completely in control of it.
“Fuck!” Harry groaned, pushing his arse back and finding nothing but air. His cock was leaking onto the bed and he wanted. Gods he
Harry blinks and stares down at his friends. “I’m going to go sit with Malfoy now. And we’re never going to mention this again, OK?”
Harry freezes when Crabbe pulls out his wand. They’d assumed he wouldn’t use magic, not in front of people he thought to be Muggles. Fuck, what if the anti-Apparition charms aren’t up yet? He could side-along Harry to fuck-knows-where.
He did most of his reading in the garden. His enjoyment with gardening however, fell slowly away as the bluebells and other wildflowers started to wilt in the autumn cold. He started using the fire pit more to keep warm when he was reading, but eventually even that felt too cold. He wasn’t ready to let go of summer yet. He went to the trusted bookshelf and found a book on atmospheric charms. Three days later he was able to spell the garden around the cabin to be in a state of constant summer. He smiled when bluebells popped out of the grass in reaction to the charm and wondered at how magic could make him enjoy a summer day while also allowing him to watch the trees outside the circle of magic start to turn yellow and red in preparation for winter. He’d purposely left the apple tree right outside the edge of his spell, because he wanted the apples to fully mature. When they did, he’d make a fall circle outside his summer-cabin before winter set in so he could enjoy all the seasons as he pleased.
“Gin,” Harry says when she breaks away from the kiss. “When you guys talk about people being hot, or seeing some random person on the street and feeling all hot and bothered, is that a real thing?”
Hermione laughed bitterly. “Oh, because giving you half the guilt over keeping a secret and the stress over whether or not you should keep it secret at all would have been such a lovely thing to do.”
Millie shrugged. “Yes. And your permission to run it in your name. I don’t think I’ll get enough funding and donations otherwise. And well, you still get people sending you money every single day asking you to use it to make the world better and shit. And the royalties from those biographies people insist on writing. I was hoping you would donate that to the foundation, since I know you don’t want it.”
“What I’m trying to say,” Draco says, voice steady, “is that I’m angry about a lot of things. I’m an angry person. But I’m not angry with you for the rough sex or release or whatever it is you call it, I’m not disgusted with you or with the things you like. And the fact that I’m angry doesn’t change the fact that I
Draco laughs a little, though his eyes are still a little red from watching Gandalf fall to his death. “Frodo reminds me a lot of you, so you’re at least part Hobbit already.”
Harry frowns, taking a step back. “What, you’re queer so I have to be too? Not that I mind, but I think I’d know.”
“I’m – aah, fuck. Malfoy, I’m going to – can I…?” Harry says, fighting hard to form the words he needs because he’s so close, so desperate to come and he isn’t sure if he needs permission before letting go.
“Harry, listen,” Draco started again, but Harry couldn’t take standing there looking at what he couldn’t have anymore.
“Yes,” Harry says, filling the word with determination. “It’s just that the headspace I get into when I’m having sex is a bit wonky, and if I’m in one of my moods when I go there I get very concerned with trying to prove my worth. I wouldn’t be able to say no then, I think. At least I can’t guarantee it, and I don’t want to do that to you.”
Draco scoffs, “You never sleep well. If you sleep at all. Some days I worry you’re a Vampire, and where would we be then Potter? Me, an Auror, you a bloodthirsty creature. Utter disaster.”
losing, like Daniel is. Harry isn't grieving the loss of Daniel and their future together, he's grieving the loss of the dream - the possibility of being happy with someone the way Ginny is happy with Pansy. He could stop talking now. He could make Daniel settle for less, and make himself pretend – but that would be cruel to them both so he makes himself keep talking.
Malfoy still hasn’t looked at Harry once, and Harry can’t make up his mind if it’s more or less infuriating than if he had looked. He has no idea what to expect. Is Malfoy going to ignore him? Will he criticise Harry and refuse to teach him, like Snape had? Is he going to be perfectly polite, and pretend they don’t have a past at all?
Harry set to work really sucking Draco off. He wrapped one of his hands around the base of Draco’s cock and used the other to urge him to thrust his hips. He wanted Draco to set the pace, wanted to feel how his thrusts would become faster and faster as he grew more desperate for release. When Draco got the idea and started pushing into Harry’s hand and mouth they both groaned, and the sound seemed to set Draco off, his thrusts becoming faster. Harry’s hair was still securely in Draco’s grip, and the combined sensation of Draco holding on to his hair and using his mouth to please himself sent electric currents of lust and pleasure through Harry’s veins.
Suddenly faced with Draco’s naked erection Harry pulled back a little to study it. Draco's cock was fucking gorgeous, and Harry’s fantasies about the man grew in potency with the knowledge of how he really looked when he was naked and aroused. After a moment of letting Harry take in the sight of his naked groin, Draco dropped his wand on the floor and used both hands to grab hold of Harry’s hair. Harry gasped and closed his eyes, forgetting all about the delicious cock in front of him in order to focus completely on the tugging and pulling of his hair. Draco used his grip on Harry’s hair to pull his head from side to side and twisted his fingers around the locks, sending shivers of pain and pleasure rushing through Harry.
Harry wants to snort, because no, of course he wouldn't. He wonders if Draco is close enough to hear what Matt’s saying, so he’ll know to follow. An invisible brush against his hand confirms that yes, Draco is right there.
“Potter, I have never doubted that for a second. You are a great many things, but I suspect sane and rational were never on that list.”
Something about Harry coming must have set Draco off as well, because he suddenly pulled Harry’s head back so hard and fast Harry’s spent cock twitched. He opened his eyes to look up at Draco who was mouthing words and breathing harshly. He felt Draco’s come in stripes on his neck and chest and couldn’t help the soothing feeling that he was being claimed. That Draco was taking him for himself, and that he wouldn’t let go unless Harry asked him to.
Ginny turns and curses when the Muggle curling-iron catches on her throat. Healing the burn with what looks like a way too practiced spell, she grins at him. “Nah, it’s a smaller place tonight. A new pub slash club slash karaoke type thing. It’ll be fun!”
Martin and Matt speak quietly to make their transaction. Harry’s eyes stay fixed on Matt the entire time, and he jumps when Draco prods him in the ribs and points to a dark corner further up the alley. Harry stares, and seconds later he sees movement.
The looks of sympathy this grants him makes him feel guilty, but he’d rather have sympathy for bad sleep than have to deal with the fallout of his idiocy being revealed.
The file, Harry thinks, is surprisingly thin considering the hunt for Crabbe has been active for over a decade. There are interviews with the Death Eaters he worked closely with, details of results from the search of his home, and a few interviews with civilian tippers who believe they’d seen Crabbe.
Malfoy only responds in Harry’s head and horrifyingly he finds himself speaking again, just to fill the silence. “Yeah, so Ron just tried to tell me I’m gay ¬– like I didn’t know that. I mean, after he saw me snogging his brother I thought it was obvious to him that I bloody well knew my own sexual orientation, but apparently he thinks I’m an oblivious idiot and just – Merlin Malfoy will you say something so I can stop talking?”
“It’s funny how it took me months to come to terms with being aromantic, but it’s taken me about five minutes to accept I’m asexual too.”
Harry winces at the memory of the wet kiss he’d shared with Cho and the awkward realisation that he really wasn’t interested when he’d tried to pick things up with Ginny after the war.
"But there has to be things you don't want to try!" Malfoy insisted, looking like he was trying to talk sense into a mad-man.
"When?" Harry asks, because anything else is pointless. Draco doesn't need to know how naive Harry has been. How he's allowed himself to imagine a future, one where they grow old together, surrounded by friends who will finally know that Harry is loved, and that he loves someone back.
Harry grinned. Draco didn’t know which one was the basil, and he was embarrassed to admit it. It was a small thing, but it was also a forceful reminder of the man he’d got to know through text. The one who hated being caught out not knowing something. “They’re on the right side, close to the end. They’re all marked.”
Suddenly the mirror disappears, instead a metal bar appears in front of Harry, hovering at the height of his hips.
“We’ll certainly try,” Malfoy says, grinning. He doesn’t sit, instead he starts to unbutton his shirt. Harry’s pleased to see he’s already managed to put some wrinkles on the usually pristine fabric, but he loses his train of thought when Malfoy removes the shirt. He’s gorgeous. He’s filled out, over the years, and it suits him so well Harry can’t breathe. He looks soft and inviting and Harry wants him so much he has to stand up again to touch him.
Draco set an unrelenting pace, fucking Harry hard and fast as Harry gasped and moaned and cursed into the sheets. He wasn’t going to last. He’d been on edge for too long, and as desperately as he wanted this to go on forever, Harry was so close his eyes watered with the effort to hold back his orgasm as Draco slammed into his prostate again and again.
than just someone with benefits. Harry doesn't want to be a benefit to Draco, he wants to be the whole deal. He wants to kiss and cuddle and have Draco stay the night. He wants all of it, but Draco doesn’t, and Harry’s endlessly happy with having what he has. He’s got Draco as a partner, and he’s got to have Draco as a Dom.
"No!" Harry says, desperate to make Daniel understand. "I didn't hate all of it. I enjoy spending time with you, I do! I've enjoyed getting to know you – I just feel off doing the romance stuff because I know I should be feeling something that's just not there. And I enjoyed the sex too. You're great at that, really, just – I like the sensations of it, you know, the act. Not –."
Daniel is waiting on the other side of the Floo and Harry suddenly wonders if he does want this, after all. He’s just some bloke, and the only reason Harry’s here with him instead of someone else from the bar, is that Daniel had asked.
“It was just, the intensity of it was suspicious,” Hermione says, raising her voice to be heard over the wind Harry’s magic creates. “So we checked. You’re under some sort of spell or potion. You’re affected by bonding magic.”
Draco didn’t respond in words, instead he put more force behind his hand and set to work making Harry’s arse hot and sensitive. Harry twitched helplessly on the bed, constantly torn between pushing his arse up towards Draco’s hand and pushing his cock into the mattress for some much-needed friction.
Draco climbed into bed with him and ran a hand down Harry’s spine and over his arse. He rested his hand there for a moment, before pulling it back and slapping Harry’s arse hard.
He comes home to a flat that feels so cold and empty in comparison that he wants to set the thing on fire. Instead he turns around and leaves. He goes for a short walk and then Apparates to Draco’s flat to ask for a spontaneous movie-night.
place and manages to get a reservation for the same evening. He showers and picks out a nice shirt to wear and almost doesn't wish he could stay home and hang out with Ginny, Pansy and Draco instead. He picks up Daniel and the kiss is fine, and Daniel looks fine. The food is fine and Harry listens to Daniel as he talks about the two cats he'd like eventually, and the kids he wants to raise. And as long as Harry doesn't let the reality that Daniel wants it with
He logged out of the site and left the the Po-cuter in his bedroom to go mix himself a drink. Who needed love anyway, right? He had a party to host and a fundraiser to attend in the morning. Nothing had changed, he could still be Harry Potter.
Draco ran his hands up Harry’s back and let them rest along the nape of his neck, fingers gently toying with the ends of Harry’s hair. “I know. That’s partly why I can finally do this. Thank you.”
“Fuuck,” Draco gasped, fingers tightening further and making Harry’s scalp tingle with a sharp pleasurable pain. “I’ll, ah, take that as a yes.”
Harry gasps in mock offense. “Frodo is the most emotionally constipated Hobbit I’ve ever seen. I don’t want to be like Frodo, I want to be like Merry.”
He apparates home with the bracelet Daniel had given him on his wrist. It’s a leather string with a silver D hanging on it, and Harry feels trapped wearing it. He needs Ginny, desperately.
Harry weaved his way through the crowd, making his excuses and promising to return after his speech for a chat. When he finally made it onstage they dimmed the lights in the room and hit him with a Lumos so bright he couldn’t see. And that’s when he realised, he had no idea what the fundraiser was for, or if it even was a fundraiser. Maybe it was some sort of memorial event? Or just a social thing Millie had thought he should attend? He had no idea.
“It’s not ominous,” Ginny says, pulling a bottle of sparkling wine from her purse. “We’re celebrating!”
“Actually, there’s this thing I’ve been thinking about,” Harry said, cheeks heating. Draco made him brave, but Harry didn’t think anything could stop him blushing.
Harry’s heart hammered in his chest as he shut down his Po-cuter. He knew who M was. He’d been there, in the flying lesson when Neville broke his arm. He’d seen Madam Hooch go around correcting students. He’d rejoiced with Ron when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong. Malfoy. Draco Malfoy was M.
It takes Harry three months to really claim the aromantic label for himself. He’s still not sure it’s right, that there’s some sort of emotion he just can’t feel - but the term accurately describes what he wants from his life – and when he thinks of it in the literal way of
“Your loss,” Draco said. Taking a step away from the bed. “Guess you’ll have to live the rest of your life wondering how good I could have made you felt.”
Furiously Harry opens the book he rescued from the Room of Requirement and starts leafing through it. If Malfoy isn’t going to look at him, he sure as hell isn’t going to look at Malfoy.
“At all,” Harry says, feeling like a terrible person for getting Daniel all worked up. “I’m really sorry, it’s just – I don’t know. Not right.”
“What’s the reason?” Harry asks, clinging to the conversation at hand so he doesn’t get lost in a daydream. This is more important. They have to learn how to
“And besides we miss living with you,” Pansy says. “Don’t get me wrong, I love living with Ginny, but I think this could be the start of a lovely tradition, don’t you? A yearly two week vacation to a beautiful place with all the people we love most.”
The sun warmed his neck until he itched with sweat and a slight sunburn, and when he felt satisfied with how the campsite looked his body ached and his stomach rumbled for food. Still, he felt more satisfied than he had in years. He could look down and see the tangible evidence of his work. He’d made an effort and he could clearly
“It’s Hogwarts fault anyway, for not teaching us Latin. The incantation is a blend of the words for cut and always – if we’d had Latin lessons, you would have been able to guess what the spell did.”
“Are you really that hungry for my cock, Potter?” Draco made his voice as hard as his expression, and almost spat Harry’s surname at him. And fuck, it shouldn’t work for him, but it did. Harry suddenly felt like his attraction was forbidden and it was hotter than he’d imagined it would be.
“Then why did you leave me?” he asked, and the words came out sounding more hurt than he’d meant them to.
“Nothing,” Harry says, turning his back to Draco to start on his dishes. He knows there is a spell for this, a little fix that would make his life so much easier — he’s never learned it though. Never thought to ask Molly when he was fresh out of Hogwarts, and years down the line it felt like it was too late.
Malfoy seems to catch on immediately, licking a hot stripe from the edge of Harry’s collarbone up to his ear and then gently biting at the earlobe. Harry shivers, and clutches to Malfoy – half terrified he’s going to wake up any second and this will all be a dream.
Instantly curious, Harry lifts the book closer to see if there is anything else on the page. Snape had made a spell for his mom, and Harry is instantly curious to know what it does. It can’t be anything terrible, like the spell he had labelled ‘
Harry laughed too, because for a while there he had really thought that was the only way for him to hold on to the peace and contentment he’d found.
“No, not now. You’re still dropping, and I’m still angry. I don’t do scenes when I’m angry. And I don’t do scenes without proper communication first either.”
He lifts his arse as much as he can to show Draco he wants it again. Draco doesn’t disappoint and the belt hits his arse twice in quick succession. Harry moans and rests his forehead on the table, breathing hard.
Spent and oversensitive Harry closed his eyes and let the small thrills of pleasure soothe him out of the intense orgasm. When Draco came, he cursed spectacularly and collapsed on top of Harry, cock still buried deep in his arse.
Malfoy closes his eyes when he comes, and the sight is a glorious one. He looks completely taken apart, exposed, open for Harry to
He stands for a while just looking at Ron and Hermione’s house and decides that today is the day he’s going to tell them about being aromantic, that he’s found something that fits him and that it finally feels like he can be happy. It feels strange though, to come out as not wanting something. He hadn’t even hesitated to come out as bi to them when he’d started seeing Daniel, but this feels different somehow. For all he knows they might not even believe it’s a real thing, they could just think he hasn’t met the right person yet.
“Why didn’t either of you tell me three months anniversaries are a thing? And for that matter, what the fuck is our ‘place’ because I need a reservation there for tonight and we’ve been to eat in loads of places but apparently one of them is our place now and I have no idea which one.”
Harry lay spent and boneless over the bed, relishing in the fact that Draco was still fucking him. He clenched his arse experimentally around the other man, and with a loud curse, Draco stiffened and came, clenching his hands hard around Harry’s hips.
“If you try to kiss me I’ll kick you in the shin,” he says, apparently unable to land on an emotion.
Malfoy is smiling, actually smiling at him and it’s a rare enough occurrence that Harry feels stunned by it. He can’t help the realisation that Malfoy looks
He comes with a groan, clenching around Draco who curses and grabs Harry’s hand, intertwining their fingers as they come. They clean each other off with lazy spells after, and Draco wraps his arms tightly around Harry before falling asleep.
“Congratulations! I’m so happy for you both!” Harry says, smiling as he feels Ginny laugh into his hair.
“I’ve seen your mark before,” Harry said. “It’s a scar. If you hadn’t changed it would be more, but it doesn’t represent you or your beliefs anymore, so it’s just a scar.”
“You don’t have to help with the dog if you don’t want to, but I’d love it if you moved in. You’re here at least a couple of nights a week anyway so it only makes sense.”
Harry smiles and runs his fingers through Draco’s hair, enjoying the softness. He appreciates the words, or the thought, as it is, but he doesn’t need it. Not when Draco has asked him to stay.
“I’m guessing I know your crushes better than you do,” Malfoy says. “Let’s see, there was Lupin, Weasley, Diggory for you too, and then Chang and the Weasley sister though I suspect those were more wishful thinking.”
“Sexual frustration is a whole lot better to deal with than sexual regret,” Draco says. “I don’t think I’m anywhere near the asexual spectrum, and I agree completely with that.”
Harry considers his friends for a second before he finds inspiration. “Actually I think some time away might do you some good. You’ve gone from sharing a flat and being alone together all the time to sharing every meal with me, spending all your time in the library or the common room. I think you need to have a proper date to maintain your relationship.”
The admission that Ginny and Pansy have missed them strikes a cord in Harry. He’d let himself think that Ginny had ‘traded up’ to Pansy, and that he was the only one who missed the closeness they’d had when they shared a flat. He hadn’t even considered that just because she wanted to live with Pansy, it didn’t mean that she didn’t miss Harry just like he missed her.
“Yes. Like Expecto Patronom means I expect a guardian and Expelliarmus is a mix of expello and arma which means banish and weapon, respectively,” Malfoy explains. “Knowing Latin makes learning and understanding spells a lot easier.”
The nudge against his consciousness is so gentle this time Harry almost doesn’t notice it, sated and half-asleep as he is.
They spend the rest of the walk up the stairs to the dining hall in silence. Malfoy is probably lost in thought trying to figure out how to teach Harry potions or pondering his own attraction, and Harry is busy trying to figure out how to ask Hermione for help without pissing her off.
Harry holds up his glass for a toast. “Here’s to, uh, shit we used up all the good ones. To mates in marriage, or holy matemony if you will.”
He looked up at Draco, and he had already rolled his sleeves up. Harry had anticipated the mark being the first thing he noticed, but he’d been wrong. Harry had always had a bit of a
He put his glasses on and laid back down in bed, letting his eyes adjust to the light as he listened to the sounds of people walking and talking quietly outside his door. His house was never really empty anymore, and he preferred it that way. He wanted it to be alive with life and joy, and the parties Millie threw were always fun and full of laughing people. At first the people he loved had been there too. Ron and Hermione had made an effort to show up every Saturday, but then they’d had Rose and Harry didn’t blame them for not coming anymore. Dean and Seamus loved a good party and they still came sometimes, but they had their jobs and they preferred a quiet night in most nights now. Luna, Neville, and Ginny had been there at first too, but it seemed like the more Harry filled his house the less his friends wanted to be there.
“Nevermind the cupcakes,” Harry grins, “they’re good without the frosting too. But I can’t let you watch your first movie without popcorn. That would make me a terrible friend. No movie without popcorn.”
“I mean, if your dream is to work at St Mungo’s, quitting would be bad. But it’s not, is it?” Harry asked. “Your dream is to have your own thing, and working there isn’t getting you that dream so why keep doing it?”
Harry spares half a thought to feeling grateful. Matt probably wouldn’t have bothered making him come if not. Nothing about this is about Harry’s pleasure, after all. It’s about Matt’s pleasure and Harry’s release. He stays on the floor, absently noticing the come and lube leaking from his arse as he listens to Matt getting dressed.
"How long were you going to let this go on? How long were you going to let me want you and love you without wanting me back?"
"So what do you like?" Malfoy asked, reaching a hand out and running them over the bracelets on Harry's arm. "Submissive, bisexual, hard yes for spanking, impact play, breath play, rough sex, biting and -, Potter. You haven't set any hard limits." Malfoy frowned, breaking off in the midst of making Harry's cock grow by reminding him of all his kinks.
“Agreed,” Harry says. He doesn’t think he’d go back to that club either way, not after what Draco has already taught him. Not after being curled up next to him in the sofa and truly feeling how good it is to be taken care of after sex.
After unpacking everything he started reading the books Hermione had bought for the cabin. Of course, there were so many it would probably take him years to get through them all, but that knowledge was comforting somehow. He could stay here as long as he needed and never run out of books to read.
He steps out of the fireplace looking rested and casual in jeans and a button-up that’s rolled up to his elbows and Harry has to resist the urge to gape. The possibility of having Draco later makes everything about him more inviting. And Harry’s allowed to look now, isn’t he?
Harry laughs, because of course Draco would think he knows best how Harry feels. “I’m really not. I’ve been in love with you for years, if I’m honest. I just didn’t want to admit it. Drove Hermione out of her mind.”
Inside the cabin Harry rinsed off his tomatoes and was ready to start chopping them when he was distracted by the sight of Draco shedding his winter clothes. Draco started with the scarf, unwrapping it slowly with long fingers and hanging it on the hook Harry had installed by the door. Next was his winter coat. He slowly opened the buttons to reveal a dark blue shirt underneath. He looked
“To see you like this?” Draco interrupts. He seems to have replaced some of his horror and worry with fury. “Well tough luck Potter! I don’t want to see you like this either, but here we are! You went out last night, didn’t you? Without backup! Fuck, I
“Less of this,” Harry demands, pulling impatiently at Malfoy’s trousers. He feels Malfoy smile against his neck, before he reaches down to undo his trousers.
“Well, how do you know you love me?” Ginny asks. Pansy and Draco are both uncharacteristically silent and Harry feels it doesn’t bode well for where the conversation is going.
“Brilliant.” Draco lowers himself onto Harry and they both groan at the friction. “Because if this felt like the first time I’d have to make it all slow and romantic.”
Harry smiled. It sounded like something M, or Draco, would do. They’d talked about his terrible job, and the apothecary he wanted to open. Harry had asked him once why he was so determined to open an apothecary independent of St Mungo’s when he didn’t really need the money, and Draco had said he wanted to offer potions and medicines to everyone at a price they could afford. He’d said St Mungo’s ridiculously overpriced some of their medications because they weren’t officially lifesaving and didn’t fall under the public healthcare the Ministry paid for.
“Right,” Draco says, and it’s obvious he doesn’t believe it, but Harry doesn’t know how to bridge the gap that always opens up between them when his brain gets like this. He can’t ever say that he wants a hug, and he wants to be held down, and he wants to let go of all control. He especially can’t say it to Draco, because Draco is the one he wants to give all the control to. Harry wants to fall apart and let Draco pick up the pieces, but he
He stepped into the cabin and realised that he’d just left it for the first time since he got there in August. It had felt like such a big step whenever he’d thought about it before, stepping out of his safe-space and into the world. He’d done it without thinking though, and it hadn’t been such a big thing.
Harry isn’t sure he cares what everyone else can see. He can’t take his eyes off himself in the mirror, how the ropes work to enhance everything he likes about himself, how they make him look strong and possessed all at the same time. His eyes look alive with arousal as they take in the sight of his own body, and the strong figure of Malfoy behind him. He’s still dressed, wearing pressed black trousers and a white shirt with his sleeves rolled up. Malfoy looks put together and in control, and it’s a sharp contrast that brings out Harry’s need and desperation all the clearer.
“Care to explain?” Malfoy asks, and Harry gets the feeling he’s genuinely asking. That he’ll accept it if Harry just says no.
“I’m in love with you too,” Draco repeated, taking another step closer. “I’m sorry I messed it up, I’m sorry I hurt you. Please, may I have another chance?”
Malfoy bites into a piece of his grapefruit, and Harry stares transfixed as his tongue darts out to lick at the stray drops of juice.
Figuring he can test the spell out or spend the rest of his life wondering what the hell it does, Harry puts the book down and pulls out his wand. He points it at his left palm under his desk and whispers the spell. His body is tense with anticipation, but nothing happens. Maybe the spell has to be cast on someone else? Harry doesn’t think Ron or Hermione would be willing subjects, and he has his doubts they’ll cast it on him. He remembers clearly how furious Hermione had been when Harry tried the spells in the book out, back in their sixth year.
“Those fireworks look a lot like the ones they sell at Weasleys Wizard Wheezes,” he says, and “that Gandalf bloke looks kinda like Dumbledore, don’t you think?”
Draco looks pointedly at the green plant next to the television that’s been on the brink of death ever since Ginny moved out. “Most people start with a houseplant.”
Harry groans. “I didn’t think they were actually going to split up partners for this, I thought that was just a stupid idea that got shut down.”
"Fuck, Draco, I want you," he whispered, eying the other occupants in the room and wishing Draco could pull his trousers down and let Harry suck him off, or pull all their clothes off and fuck Harry.
Draco sighs, turns over in bed to face Harry and run a soft hand down the side of his face. “I’m sorry Harry, but yes. I’ve got more to lose.”
Harry gives him a half-hearted glare. “Dropped my frosting bag when you Apparated in with the loudest pop I’ve ever heard.”
Malfoy had written and suggested the exhibitionist room in his BDSM club, and Harry had felt a rush of desire flood him at the thought. It feels stronger now, growing in intensity because of his nerves.
“Anyways, Pansy and I had this cramped and terrible balcony and I felt safe there, but it was so ugly. It took me ages but I worked out how to cast an Undetectable Extension Charm on an open space and after that the rest was simple. I just thought it would be nice for all of us to have an outside space so I did the same here.”
“You told Matt you thought you’d lose your job next week, yeah?” Draco asks. “I figure we give it at least the weekend before we text the number he gave you. That makes it more believable that you’ve lost your job by the time you make contact, and it gives Matt a chance to speak to Crabbe about you.”
Draco undresses them both and spreads Harry out on the bed, kissing and licking everywhere he can reach, and then turning Harry over to give the same attention to the back of his neck, down his spine, alternating between kisses, licks and soft bites. Harry pants desperately into the pillow, but feels too content to beg for more. They have all the time in the world now.
Harry grins at the secret admission Malfoy doesn’t even know he’s made. “Very interesting,” he agrees.
Harry doesn’t feel the stiffness of his knees and shoulders until he stands up from his position bent over the table, and he winces a little when he does. He turns to see Draco standing, half-naked in his kitchen, one hand wet with lube and it feels surreal. He can’t believe he has this.
“Draco,” he gasps, his hand on Draco’s arm holding on tight, like he might float away on the pleasure if he lets go.
Harry shrugs and extracts the memory, placing it gently in the Pensive. “Alright, but just so you know I’m all for it.”
, sent his head spiralling. How many times had he fucked himself on his fingers or a plastic dildo wishing it was Draco? Too many to count since he’d noticed him at the parties. And definitely too many to count since he’d quit denying his attraction after the war if he was honest.
Harry considers for a moment, wanting his reply to be truthful. “I feel brilliant. There isn’t that looming feeling of doom I’m always having either. I just feel relaxed.”
“I hardly think it’s relevant to the case,” Draco smirks. He walks over to Crabbe and flips him over with his boot. “Now let’s call the others in to arrest what really should have ended as a stain on a dirty mattress somewhere.”
“Yes,” Harry says, smiling sadly at Draco. He hopes this won’t be the end of them being partners, or the end of his benefits.
Harry peeks out of the pillow to look at the three people in the bed with him. Ginny is red with a blush, Pansy is looking at her with damp eyes and Draco is balanced at the edge of the bed looking curiously at them both.
Ginny and Pansy get married on Valentine's day, a year after they got engaged. Harry and Draco are the best men, and they both get a little teary eyed when Pansy and Ginny announce they’re invited to the honeymoon.
Harry’s wrist suddenly feels warm, and he itches to look at it. Fuck, what if the spell did do something? It suddenly feels like a terrible idea to cast a spell Snape had designed for his mom. For all Harry knows it’s some creepy birth control spell Snape made in a fit of delusional thinking.
Harry remembered that conversation. How Draco loved to make his sexual partners talk about what they enjoyed, how he liked to see them a little flustered with it. The reminder made his cheeks even warmer, and if he wasn’t careful, he’d end up matching the tomatoes in colour.
He doesn’t waste any time approaching and pulling Harry close, like they were in the bar. Harry closes his eyes and lets him. He focuses on the feeling of hands running over his t-shirt and of a firm hip against his growing erection. He lifts his hands to let his shirt get pulled off, and groans a little at the feeling of skin against skin. It feels good to be touched and his body reacts with a shiver when it stops. He doesn’t open his eyes, deciding it’s better to just wait for a new sensation. Seconds later, a naked torso presses against his and Harry pushes back, chasing the warmth.
“Do tell,” Draco says, summoning four glasses from the kitchen with a lazy flick of his wand. “What are we celebrating?”
“I almost didn’t come,” Draco says. He looks tired, and resigned. Harry knows Draco is sad to lose this too, just not sad enough to give up his family to keep it. That should be alright. Harry shouldn’t expect to be loved above all else just because that’s what he does. Draco is the sun, and Harry is just one of many planets.
Harry does think this time, letting himself remember how Malfoy had acted around different people in their schooldays.
“Answer,” Draco demands, and even the stern tone sounds caring. Caring and in control and Harry feels too raw to resist. It’s so easy to let Draco take charge, soothing, like sinking into a bathtub full of warm water.
Draco flips open Harry’s copy of the Crabbe-file and starts leafing through it. “Brown made himself a nice little Post-it note about a potential lead and then just didn’t bother following it up. It’s not in any of the official documents. Just this stupid little post-it that was probably stuck to the back of a proper report.”
“Maybe that’s exactly my plan,” Harry laughed, walking into the bathroom to shower and leaving Draco with the image of his naked arse.
Despite Ginny's promises, Harry still feels unsure walking down the street towards the club. At least it’s not cold out, if anything it’s strangely warm for the middle of October. Harry studies the leaves that hang stubbornly onto the trees in the park they’re walking past and thinks maybe it’s time to let go a little. For the leaves and him both. He doesn’t go out much these days, or any days really. The feeling of being in the wrong place always hangs over him, whispering in his ear and his heart that he shouldn’t be there. The feeling had only grown stronger in the short months he and Ginny had dated after the war, but it’s better now, and at least it’s quiet when he’s in his own home.
Malfoy smiles, and it makes his eyes look warm and Harry suddenly remembers what it was his bladder distracted him from.
Malfoy pulls him even closer and holds out his hand to summon his wand. He casts a quick cleaning charm on them, and then conjures a blanket. Harry snuggles in close, letting his sated body relax against the soft bed and Malfoy’s warm chest.
A cold feeling of dread spreads through Harry at the Muggle connection. It isn’t often that their Auror work brings them to the Muggle world, and Harry’s grateful for it. There’s a reason Harry always goes Muggle for his hookups, even though his Auror-grade Glamour could fool any wizard. The types of guys Harry usually takes home for the night are also the guys he’d be arresting in the morning. He decided long ago that bringing a criminal Wizard home was too big a conflict of interest.
The stimulation to his arse and his cock make pleasure explode from his lower spine, and he knows he’s seconds from coming. He remembers ‘Don’t come without my hand on your cock’, and realises he’s got permission. Draco’s firm hand jerking his cock in rhythm with his thrusts is all the permission he needs.
“I know who M is,” Harry said. He sounded out of breath, and he looked desperately at Hermione as if she would have all the answers to his current predicament.
In the dream he had woken, gone to Malfoy’s door and knocked. Malfoy had opened the door wearing those deliciously fitted and pressed trousers from Tuesday, and the blue Muggle shirt he’d worn on Saturday. His robes were nowhere to be seen, and his shirt had been rolled up at the sleeves with several buttons undone at his collar. In the dream there was no past between them, no self-conscious thinking, no hesitation. Harry had reached out to run his fingers over the exposed skin and Malfoy had pulled him closer.
Harry blushes and bites his lip. He suddenly understands the urge to project his thoughts like Draco had, rather than speaking them out loud. This is good for them though. If they’re going to make this work they’re going to have to
Instead, he pays attention to how Malfoy’s hair looks warm when it reflects the light from the fire beneath the cauldron. He notices how his buttons are perfectly done up beneath his robe, how his shirt is perfectly crisp and without a single wrinkle in it. He notices that the scuff mark on Malfoy’s shoe from his walk on the grounds yesterday has been polished away. Malfoy is so perfectly put together and all Harry wants to do is take him apart. He wants to know the man beneath the perfect exterior. The man he hears in his ear.
“Promise?” Harry says, feeling too raw to deny to himself or Malfoy that this is more than just sex to him. The insecurity in his tone must be as obvious to Malfoy as it is to him, because Malfoy smiles warmly and runs a hand through Harry’s hair, presumably tidying it up a little.
Harry’s so close, but he wants to keep going. Wants to stand here and be fucked by Malfoy for hours until every bone in his body aches with it. And as much as he wants it to last, he wants the pleasure to spill over even more. To feel the waves of his orgasm rush over him for everyone to see. Then Malfoy does a particularly gifted twist of his hand on Harry’s cock and slams into his prostate at the same time, and it’s not Harry’s choice to wait or come anymore.
“Brown forgets to boil his tea-water. He should have retired before we even started working here, but he’s a stubborn sod who insists on sitting here and being useless instead. Naturally, he wrote this note and forgot all about it.”
Draco shoves at Harry and stands up. The snow clings to his wool coat, and he looks like he doesn’t know if he should laugh or cry.
Draco cleans his back with the cool towel too, and Harry sighs with pleasure when he presses it softly against his heated arse and whispers a healing charm. He’s almost half asleep when Draco speaks again.
“Thanks for this,” he says, leaving the office before any more dead headmasters start to talk to him about his love-life. Or lack thereof.
. And Draco had said yes, had said he wanted this too, so Harry wrapped his hands around Draco’s hips and pulled him close.
“I have people lined up who’d pay good money for you,” Crabbe grins, but his eyes stay cold. “Maybe not quite the job you had in mind, but you’ll be fed and fucked on a regular basis.”
Hermione and Ron both frowned with concern, and Harry was sure they’d blame him for their worry-lines one day.
Harry closed his Po-cuter and gave Ron and Hermione his full attention. He felt a bit awkward, showing them around in their own cabin but he’d occupied it before they had a chance to use it for themselves and he thought they should know how beautiful the garden and the cabin could be when you looked at it right.
“You’re just saying that so we won’t blame you for dragging us back here,” Harry mutters. He had thought, after putting an end to Voldemort, that his anger would ebb away, but instead it just became untethered. Without a healthy outlet for it he finds himself snapping at people who don’t deserve it. His work helps, gives him a target for his rage, but he hasn’t got his work right now.
Draco, apparently, does too, because he’s done teasing. His lips close around Harry’s cock and Harry moans and fights to keep his hips steady. Wet fingers linger like a question below Harry’s balls and he bends his knees and lifts his hips slightly to grant them access.
“Don’t,” Harry said, surprising himself with the force behind it. “I wasn’t, er, I’m not staring at the mark. I don’t care about that. Thought I might, to be honest, but –,”
He’d meant what he told M about getting an early night. Millie was coming over for lunch so early it would probably be breakfast for Harry, and he wanted to be fully rested for the conversation.
Ginny nods, her blush still violently red against her normally pale cheeks. “I’ve been seeing her for a couple of weeks actually. I wanted to tell you the minute it happened, I swear! Just - it was so new and she’s a she and I didn’t really know what it was until a few days ago.”
Harry holds his breath, heart pounding in his chest. He doesn’t dare to hope. Doesn’t dare to do anything that might ruin his second chance.
For a second he’s afraid Draco won’t make good on his word, that he’ll keep moving down to kiss and lick Harry all over until he’s a desperate mess and ready to beg for anything. That had been a fun night, and Harry can’t wait to repeat it, but what he wants now is something more primal.
Harry unpacks his belongings into the small wardrobe in his room and lies down on the bed to breathe for a while. It’s odd, being back. In one way it feels like home. Hogwarts always has, but there was so much death here. Not to mention the fact that starting tomorrow he’ll be sitting down in classrooms taking Charms, Transfigurations, Potions and Defence Against the Dark Arts for the first time since he was sixteen. He doesn’t know how he’ll do it. His coping, as Hermione calls it, is all based on running into danger and directing his anger at criminals in order to catch them. He has no idea how he’s going to survive months of just sitting.
Then days and weeks pass, and slowly but surely life gets to him. Will he catch that murderer? What will happen if he doesn’t? Will he be able to avoid that Witch from St. Mungo's who’d asked him out? Will he ever find someone to fit in with, and when he doesn’t, will he be able to deal? His dishes get left undone, building up to an insurmountable mountain on his kitchen counter and stressing him out so much he can’t use the kitchen at all anymore. He’ll run out of clean clothes and spend hours at work worrying over what to wear the next day. He’ll stop sleeping. Harry’s thoughts will gain momentum and weight until they spin around the inside of his head and slam against his skull with such force he can’t figure out what any of them are saying anymore. And that’s when he’ll give in. Because at that point his thoughts can’t hold him back anymore, and even if they could, Harry’s pretty sure they’d tell him functioning at work is more important than avoiding the feelings of guilt and worthlessness sex always brings.
Harry can’t help the urge to rut up against Malfoy, letting his hands fall down to Malfoy’s hips and pulling him close again and again as his cock becomes fully hard and aching in his pants. Malfoy doesn’t seem to be holding back any better than Harry, panting hard against his lips in between kisses and jerking his hips to meet Harry’s.
“Don’t worry about it,” Millie laughed. “You were bound to snap eventually. Nobody can live like that for too long.”
“I don’t want it to look like I’m giving up,” Draco admitted. “Or feel like I’m giving up, I guess.”
He removes his hands from Harry entirely, and an embarrassing whine escapes Harry before he can stop it.
Harry runs his hands down Draco’s warm belly, circles his thumb around his belly button and runs them back up to his chest, grinning at the small hairs he finds there. He’s relieved to see his curse in the bathroom never scarred, but the thought is fleeting as he runs his hand over one of Malfoy’s nipples and he gasps.
It had taken him five years and four rejection letters to come to terms with the fact that ‘public interest’ wasn’t dying down and the best way for him to do something productive with his life was to embrace it. If people were going to look to him, he should at least be something worth looking at, and help direct attention to people and issues that needed support. He’d hired Millie after that. She was officially hired to manage his public life, but Harry stood in his bathroom full of things he hadn’t bought, wearing clothes Millie had picked out and realised that she really managed his whole life.
Millie told him about the foundation she wanted to create and run. One in his name, but one he wouldn’t have to do much for, except an annual appearance or two. She wanted to apply for Ministry funding and hold fundraisers to offer support to the people she felt society had failed.
Harry laughs because no, it doesn’t feel like his first time with Draco. Hell, the first time hadn’t felt like the first time – it had felt like an inevitable conclusion, not the fumbling mess Harry associates with first times.
“Morning,” Harry says, sitting down next to Ron and Hermione. He places his coffee and cereal in front of him, wondering briefly if he should have picked something dryer.
Malfoy is in front of him so fast Harry half-thinks he Apparated, and he’s about to make a joke about it when Malfoy’s hands are in his hair tilting Harry’s head back so he can lean down for a kiss.
“It’s not a one-time thing,” Harry says, because he feels in his bones that it’s true. That the second he gets to know Malfoy
Draco sat up and fixed Harry with an intense gaze. The openness Harry had grown so used to seeing on Draco’s face disappeared, closing him off to the other man’s emotions.
Draco frowns again. “I’ll go to the training room at the Ministry and punch a bag about my anger until it goes away.” He looks at Harry and notices him wince. “Don’t worry, I’m not very angry with you. Mostly with the world in general. Punching a bag always does the trick.”
“Well, what do you want me to do then? Not everyone meets their soulmate at eleven. Has it ever occurred to you that the only people who are ever interested in me want the
“I think regular sex is definitely a benefit we could include,” Draco says, “but I’m hardly going to fuck you over your desk in the middle of the work-day.”
When Draco finally fucks him, draping his body over Harry’s and thrusting in a slow, torturous rhythm Harry’s already fighting the urge to come. Draco’s hips twitch and fall out of rhythm and he knows he isn’t the only one who feels close and raw.
and holds out his hand to Draco instead. “You’ll have to side-along me, I left my wand. And you better have alcohol.”
Draco’s eyes look alight with want and he doesn’t hesitate in moving his hips forward. When the head of his cock finally slips inside Harry they both gasp. Harry releases Draco’s cock and moves both hands to grab Draco’s forearms, holding on tight.
Harry groaned a little when the press of apparition lifted and looked around the unfamiliar bedroom. He was still on his knees, the ropes from the BDSM party wrapped tightly around his wrists and ankles. His erection hadn’t been affected by the jump, still strained against his jeans. From his kneeling position, he looked right at Malfoy’s clothed cock and was happy to see it was just as hard as Harry’s.
It takes them two weeks to retrace the steps of the previous Aurors on the case. Two weeks of dead-ends and pointless interviews. One particularly memorable Witch had led them into her house, claiming Crabbe was inside, only to point at the stuffed cat she had standing on her mantel.
“Fuck,” Harry groans, throwing his head back and letting the sensations of Draco’s cock slamming into him rush through him. His body still feels sensitive and charged from the spanking, and he won’t last long. Not with Draco’s cock rubbing against his prostate with every thrust. Not when it’s Draco.
Ron pushed Harry’s plate closer in a clear encouragement for Harry to start eating and turned to Hermione.
Ron had thought it weird that Harry and Ginny had chosen to continue with their plan of moving in together despite breaking up. There was something comforting about Ginny though, and neither of them had wanted to live alone while they searched for someone to share their lives with. Nine years later they still haven’t found that someone, but their friendship has flourished.
“Yes, that too.” Malfoy walks a bit faster, catching up to Harry and returning the smile. “So, any particular reason you’ve decided to join me for breakfast today?”
The Pensive is still sitting on his desk from the previous week and Harry focuses on his memories of Matt in the pub and the conversation they’d had after Harry laced his drink with Veritaserum.
“She’s told the press you’re taking a much-deserved vacation in the US,” Hermione said. “Though she dropped enough subtle hints that everyone thinks you’re actually in the US to do something heroic and altruistic that you don’t want credit for. She’s excellent at her job.”
Ron shook his head. “Physically, sure. But you’re not here, not really. I don’t want this front you’re putting on to please – I don’t even know who you’re trying to please. I want my friend back. I want you to answer my question of ‘how are you’ with something real, not a rant about this week’s social issue.”
“I’m sorry you’ve been trying so hard to break it for weeks now,” Draco says. He’s cold again. “But I’m afraid you’ll have to go
“After,” Malfoy promises, leaning in to give Harry a reprise of the chaste kiss that had started everything.
In the end Harry wins out, and by lunch they’ve got the phone ready. They lay a plan for the following day: how they’ll text Crabbe pretending Harry got fired and needs work. How he’ll put his Glamour on and show up to a meeting with Draco under his invisibility cloak and half a dozen Aurors on standby.
“Told you bondage and impatience was a bad combination,” Draco said, running one of his hands through Harry’s hair to play with the soft tufts at the nape of his neck.
“It’s nothing you need to know,” he mutters. When he looks back up Malfoy looks – hurt. And that doesn’t bother Harry, it really doesn’t because why would it? But he can’t afford to make Malfoy upset enough to want to run away from him, can he?
Thank you, Natsukileerkolover, for a prompt that made my brain function creatively again. I took some liberties with it, but I hope you enjoy.
Draco used one hand to hold Harry’s arse open, and with the other spread lube over his opening. He rubbed his strong fingers in circles over Harry’s rim, and he could feel his arse clench and unclench in response.
Harry stares at the water-stain again. He doesn’t know why but something about Draco’s voice makes him want to cry. He sounds caring. Furious yes, but in a caring way. Like Harry
Harry shakes his head. “Stoic is so boring. I love how easily the Hobbits just share their feelings. And not just the sad ones either. When they’re happy they’re so happy, when they love someone they show it in so many ways. They’re just so open and honest all the time. I love that.”
Relieved he wasn’t the only one affected, Harry lifted his arse off the bed as high as he could without lifting his face from the sheets.  “Anything. Fuck me, make me come. Please.”
“Hugo’s finally out. Remind me to ask you to come over earlier next time, they’re so happy when they get to see you that they absolutely refuse to sleep.”
Harry doesn’t know if the voice in his ear or the playful tone in Malfoy’s voice is more concerning. The second he had seen Malfoy walk into the classroom Harry had half expected his untethered rage to latch on to Malfoy and make Harry see red, but Malfoy was all politeness and banter and all in all a terrible tether for Harry’s anger.
“Still can’t believe you two ended up together,” Malfoy laughs. “We’ll use the blue rope then. Anything else you want to do, or would be alright doing?”
“Yes,” Draco says, a sad smile on his face. Harry wonders if it was ever real. He doesn’t know what hurts more, the idea that Draco never loved him - or the thought that he just doesn’t love Harry
Annoyed with himself that he’s staring at Malfoy, who still refuses to look at him, Harry forces himself to look down at his book. The page he’s working from is full of scribbles, like the rest of the book, though on this particular page most of the words have been crossed out. The only real suggestion to the potion Harry’s making is to add an extra drop of oil. The rest of the scribbles seem to be an attempt at figuring out a spell. Some of the words are repeated again and again, each time in a new order or with different endings or other words added in. In his sixth year Harry had simply discarded the page as a failed attempt, but now he sees the tiny line of text at the very bottom -
Harry groans and falls back in his chair, appetite suddenly gone. If he fails his Potions NEWT he’s going to lose his job. And he’s going to fail Potions because the only time he ever successfully brewed a potion was when following the instructions in Snape’s old book.
Draco leans in slowly, brushing his lips gently against Harry’s. He doesn’t pull back to speak, lips moving gently. “I think we’re both motivated enough to make anything work.”
Draco laughed. It sounded free, more so than Harry had heard it previously and he was glad. Grateful that the man he loved wouldn’t subject himself to suffering any more than he had to.
“Guess you won’t get to fuck me then,” Harry said, but the words sounded like a lie even as he spoke them, and when the final word morphed into a whine as Draco spanked him again it ruined the determination behind them entirely.
“Yeah, you never really struck me as the ‘casual sex type’,” Daniel says, making air quotes with his fingers. He looks disappointed, but he’s smiling reassuringly and Harry’s grateful he was approached by such a good guy.
And Harry – well alright Ron is probably right that Harry does want to have sex with Malfoy. At least he’s thought about it. And dreamed about it. Wanked about it too, now that he’s apparently being honest with himself.
Harry feels his legs buckle beneath him, and he grabs onto Malfoy for support. “Malfoy, I need ¬– ah ¬¬– surface.”
Harry twitches and refuses the urge to look in the direction the softly spoken words are coming from. It’s Malfoy’s voice, but his lips aren’t moving. Harry resists the urge to run out of the room in a panicked search for Hermione, but only just. When Malfoy finally walks past him to chat with whoever’s sat down behind him, Harry pulls his sleeve up and stares in horror at the gold tattoo that circles his wrist.
“I like to think we’re all old and wise enough to not cast homemade spells on anyone,” Ron says, making Harry suppress a wince. “And the potions tips are brilliant!”
Harry laughs because no, he’s very much not OK. He’s attached himself to Malfoy somehow, and he’s pretty sure he’ll fail his NEWT course if he tells anyone about it because it’s undeniable proof of his idiocy.
Harry watches Daniel in silence, trying and failing to feel a rush of desire for the man that so obviously wants him. And fuck, he wants to want Daniel. He knows he’ll probably enjoy what he has planned if he could just close his eyes and feel it, but it doesn’t seem right to Daniel and the longer Harry looks at him, the less he wants him.
“Mate,” Ron said, giving Harry an amused look. “You have a weird hang-up on names, I hope you know that.”
“You feel so, fuck, Draco! So good!” Harry’s only half aware of the words escaping his mouth. His focus is on Draco thrusting into him again and again, making heat and pleasure build up in his pelvis and begging to overflow. It’s on his aching cock, on the precome leaking down it’s tip. It’s on Draco.
She pulled a stack of papers from her purse and looked up at Harry, shuffling the papers in her hands nervously. “I’ve had this idea for a while,” she said.
“That’s very good, Harry. You’ve been so good, waiting for me.” Draco rubs his thumb across Harry’s wrist as he speaks, and Harry’s entire arm feels charged.
Merlin is right, Harry thinks. He only remembers his wand when it slips between his fingers. He picks it up again and tries to conjure lube. The trusty spell fails completely, producing only a puff of smoke when Harry breaks off mid-incantation to groan when Malfoy twists his hand in a way that makes Harry see stars.
Draco flushes, and Harry guesses that’s why he’s embarrassed. Not that he’s bought a TV, but that he has absolutely no idea how to make it work.
“He was probably annoyed someone wanted him to do actual work on one of his desk-fillers,” Harry says, grabbing the note back from Draco to read it.
“Fuck, that’s really hard to explain,” Ginny laughs. “I guess I think about her all the time when I’m not with her. When something happens I always want to tell her first. I want to be around her all the time, and Merlin she’s so hot I can’t get enough of her.”
“Yeah, we could have made life a lot easier for ourselves if we’d just hooked up sooner,” Malfoy says. “So, what did you want to do this evening? I assume you’re alright with people watching, seeing as you make porn and agreed to the exhibitionist room.”
“No,” Harry says, “it feels the same as when I’m with a girl. Well, different obviously, but also not. I enjoyed it, I think maybe it’s just a bit too soon?” It comes out sounding like a question, but that has to be why right? He just takes a little longer to want
For a week he slept, ate, and used the toilet. When he woke up one morning and found he smelled, he considered a freshening charm before a stray thought reminded him that actually, he used to enjoy showers. He used to find joy standing under the hot water and feeling his body relax. And why shouldn’t he have an obscenely long shower? He wasn’t in a rush. So, he started adding showers to his daily routine. Some days he washed his hair and some days he just stood underneath the spray and let the water wash away the chill and the tension that seemed to have accumulated inside him without his knowledge for the past few years.
. Bloody Malfoy always uses the toilet in his room in the morning, and then doesn’t bother going near one for hours. Harry doesn’t have access to his room, so he doesn’t share the luxury of a private toilet. He’s been conjuring a pot to use and then banishing it for the past few mornings, but he was a bit preoccupied this time. He considers just conjuring a pot now, but the Dining Hall is starting to fill up, and Ron and Hermione will be here any second. Harry takes a deep breath and decides he can hold it, if nothing else it’s an effective distraction from the
Harry woke up the next morning feeling strangely grounded in himself in a way he hadn’t for a long time. It had been nice, talking to someone who didn’t expect him to be this way or that. They hadn’t really gotten anywhere, but Harry wasn’t expecting that to happen for a while. It probably took time, getting to know someone through text.
“I could be your Dom, if you wanted.” Draco says it like it’s the easiest thing, like it’s a casual offer to a friend. Like it’s ‘
“Malfoy!” he yells, making Malfoy freeze in place and turn to look at him. Harry freezes too, without any plan for what he’s going to do now that he’s got Malfoy’s attention.
Harry stays in bed, tries and fails to keep from hoping that Draco will return. That he’ll get to the altar and realise he
“It’s just a little something,” Daniel says, “and dinner sounds perfect actually. Is it at our place?”
Harry almost rolled his eyes. Draco had been true to his word; he loved making Harry explain what he wanted. Or describe how something felt. Loved to find all the sensitive spots on his body and use them to make Harry scream in pleasure. It was exasperating and wonderful, and Harry wouldn’t change him for the world. It also made it impossible for him to keep his desires hidden under a veil of shame. Draco never made Harry feel bad about the things he wanted, never laughed or told him it was bad – and it made Harry brave.
It was a little scary how fast the relationship grew when they finally met. Harry and Draco had only been seeing each other in person for a little over a month, and Harry was fairly sure Draco had accidentally moved into Harry’s new house when Harry did. They had never really made the conscious decision to move in together, but Harry looked around his bedroom and realised Draco had his own side of the bed, with his things on his nightstand. He had clothes in the closet, and his hair potions in the bathroom.
Turns out, thinking about the details of what he likes, and what he would like to do with Draco is an exercise in arousal. Harry sits at the kitchen table for hours after Draco leaves, imagining Draco bending him over it and having his way with him. He imagines Draco taking him to bed and tying his hands down. He imagines Draco standing over Harry and looking way too sexy in his cloak, making Harry undress and kneel in front of him. He imagines Draco taking Harry’s belt off and spanking him with it until his arse is red and heated, and then he imagines Draco licking and kneading his sore cheeks. He sits at his kitchen table and pants with arousal and refuses to touch himself because he wants to do this properly. Wants to have answers for Draco when he asks, and wants the next time he comes to be with Draco’s hand around his cock.
Harry moves his hand from Draco’s face and grabs his hands instead, gently tugging Draco with him as he moves to sit on his bed again.
“They’re pretty amazing,” Draco agrees. “Though something could be said for how stoic Aragorn and Legolas are behaving.”
“I don’t usually have a problem showing this. It’s – I’m obviously not proud of the mark itself, but it’s a visceral reminder of how far I’ve come. I don’t usually mind people seeing that.”
Harry keeps staring at Draco in silence, watching in fascination as Draco paces back and forth a few times mouthing silently to himself.
“Nevermind that,” Harry says, fighting to hold his irrational irritation back. “Who was that girl I saw you kissing last night?”
“Famous Harry Potter, hiding from his adoring fans to wank over my cock. Don’t think I didn’t see how you drooled over me at the Ministry today.”
Draco let the tip of his finger slip inside Harry and pushed slowly forward. “Hmm, we’ll see about that, won’t we Potter.”
Draco leaves with a rush of green fire, and Harry makes himself sit in front of the fireplace and finish his second drink just in case he comes back. Harry considers having a third drink before going out, but discards the idea. Tonight isn’t just about release, it’s work too.
The next day Harry came home from the fundraiser and answered what felt like hundreds of questions on the dating site, not quite admitting to himself that he could just lie to Ron and Hermione and say he’d done it without actually doing it. When he’d finally completed the questionnaire, he sat and stared at the message on the screen for fifteen minutes.
“You’re not used up!” Hermione said, sounding horrified. “He just wanted his fifteen minutes of fame and did anything to get them.”
Matt grinds his clothed erection against Harry’s arse and makes a frustrated sound. “He isn’t, or I’d have a go at you in the bathroom before heading up.”
Malfoy’s hand on him is too dry and too gentle, and it’s the best Harry’s ever had just because it’s
Harry felt a rush of relief at Draco’s words. He didn’t care if anyone else thought they were moving too fast. He cared that they were moving at the same pace as each other.
Harry finds himself kneeling in front of Draco for the second time that day, and a rush of arousal floods through him. Biting his lip to ground himself he stands, this really isn’t the time to let his inconvenient
“You listen so intently,” he says. “It makes me feel like what I have to say is important, even when it’s probably not.”
Harry watches as Draco unbuttons his own shirt to reveal a pale and toned stomach, a trail of hair so light it’s almost invisible from his navel down to his jeans. He lets Draco unbutton his jeans, and steps out of them easily. His cock strains his pants, and he wonders if his pants or Draco’s jeans will come off first.
He grabs the schedules from Ron’s hand and tries to stare them into submission. Sharing classes with Ron would have made this whole ‘back to school’ ordeal a little more bearable, so of course they had to take that away from him.
Malfoy’s hands are slick when they grab hold of Harry’s hips, and Harry knows he’s lubed his cock up already. That there are only moments between now and when he’s buried in Harry’s arse, fucking his brains out. The thought makes him moan softly and the sound seems to spur Malfoy on because the next thing Harry knows his cock is pressing against his opening in a slow but unyielding thrust.
“I have a three-month-plan,” Harry said. “In three months, I’ll be living in a house with a massive garden, go on real-life dates with M, and only do public appearances once or twice a year for the foundation Millie is setting up.”
“You’ll be here still, won’t you?” he asked, getting off the hard floor with a groan. “When I’m done in the shower?”
Draco frowns again, and Harry aches with having to disappoint him. “Alright, Potter. I’ll be here in the morning.”
“What do you like?” Draco asked, running the tip of his finger over Harry’s lower lip and letting his eyes wander over Harry’s naked body.
Harry takes a deep breath, relishing in the way Draco’s scent always soothes his nerves. “They know we’re fucking,” he says. “I’d - I’d like them to know it’s more.”
Draco gasps and dramatically places a hand over his heart. “You can’t be sick of pizza! That’s an insult to, I don’t know, everything! But we should probably get something else. After the amazing pizzas we’ve had recently, anything we order will be a massive disappointment.”
If nothing else, following Malfoy around becomes exponentially easier now that Harry isn’t doing it in hiding. He gets to enjoy long breakfasts. He gets to walk with Malfoy to the classrooms, instead of dodging his way through a crowd in his invisibility cloak or following at a distance while occasionally being pulled forward by his wrist. His new routine makes his life a whole lot easier, and if it wasn’t for the whole ‘sleeping on the floor’ issue, he doesn’t think he’d mind the bond. It has its drawbacks of course, like increasingly pointed questions from Ron and Hermione and the inability to choose where he goes. But the drawbacks seem less daunting and more like a mild to moderate inconvenience now.
Harry held strong for four quick breaths, but when Draco picked up his shirt as if to put it back on, he groaned and flopped over on his stomach. “Fuck, fine!”
Draco laughed softly behind him, but it didn’t sound real. “She told me, but only after screaming at me for thirty minutes about how much of an idiot I am.”
Draco moaned again and tightened his fingers in Harry’s hair. He let go immediately, as if he’d done it on reflex, but not before Harry had reacted by twitching his hips and gasping.
Ginny twists her fresh curls in her fingers, pulling them until Harry knows they’ll turn frizzy. Serves her right, really.
Harry had been right, that Draco had filled out, and the weight made him look healthy and approachable. Draco Malfoy was in no way a pointy git anymore. His shirt looked soft, and Harry caught himself wanting to reach out and touch it. Though, that probably had more to do with the man who was wearing the shirt than the shirt itself.
“I can’t believe I’ve spent years working here, watching his case-file being handed over from incompetent Auror to more incompetent Auror,” Draco frowns, “though I suppose they didn’t trust me not to murder him once I found him.”
“Yeah, alright,” Harry agrees. “Honestly, I didn’t even register what the homework is, so I’ll probably be needing a lot of
for over a week now, and it’s strange how quickly Harry got used to it. He started using it after hearing Draco thinking ‘
Harry listens as Draco’s belt buckle clinks, and anticipation builds when he hears the belt being pulled from it’s hoops. Draco runs his hands over Harry’s back, and Harry feels the cool metal of the belt in his hands as they move past his waist and down to his arse.
Harry was thankful for his routine. He got up, showered, read, worked in the garden, and ate lunch. And the gaping hole in the afternoons where he’d spoken to Draco was easy to fill; once with a meeting with the real-estate agent who was selling his house and trying to find him a new one, and twice with sobbing into his pillow.
Harry suddenly wants to pull away from Draco before Draco can pull away from him. Of course that’s what’s happening. Draco’s being kind because Harry is obviously falling apart. He’ll put him back together and then he’ll leave for good. Harry’s breath catches and he hates himself for it. If Draco’s only staying to make sure he’s safe, then Harry should pull himself together so Draco doesn’t have to care for him.
“You know what I think? I think you’ve been hard for a while, sitting here having this conversation. I think you’ve been imagining me bending you over any hard surface in this room and having my way with you. Am I right?”
Ron laughs. “I think you’ll find the funniest part is the teacher has written down the books from both sixth and seventh year on the curriculum. How they expect us to learn two years’ worth of classes in a few months is beyond me.”
Harry sighs and grabs the pillow back, hugging it like a teddy as he stares hopelessly at the girls.
“Indeed,” Draco says. He pulls out gently and rolls off Harry with a groan, waving his hand to release Harry’s wrists. Harry lets them fall to the bed and closes his eyes, half waiting for the horrible feelings to come creeping in now that they’re done. Before his feelings have time to do anything though, he hears Draco wet the towel with a softly spoken spell.
“The good ones are supposed to be better,” Ginny says, and she looks sad. “They’re supposed to feel wonderful and leave you wanting more. I mean, Pansy and I have been talking about moving in together in the near future, because we just want to be together all the time.”
“Heard of that too, but I always felt like it would defeat the point. Nobody ever asked for one anyway.” Harry lets his brain slow down into only doing what Draco asks. He lets the worry and the anxiety slip away for now. He can’t fix what he’s done. He can’t change how Draco will feel about it, but what he can do is what Draco asks of him. And right now that’s answering.
“I love the little Hobbits so much,” Harry says. “Look at how they’re just in their feelings like they don’t have room in their little bodies to contain it all so it just shines through all the time.”
Hermione laughed a little. “It had to end in love, heartbreak, or murder. It’s like that game: fuck, marry, kill.”
When Harry doesn't deny it Daniel laughs, and the sound tears at Harry. There's no humour in it, only pain and anger.
“What will you do today then?” Harry asks, blush making his cheeks flame. He feels like a bloody teenager.
"I don't need you to love me. I just need you to want me. I need you to look at me and not cringe. I need you to like talking about the future, I need you to make space for me in it. I know it's too soon for me to love you, and I don't expect that – just, you know, the possibility of it."
Harry sighs and summons his pants from the floor. Draco isn’t leaving. Harry should know better than to expect him to leave his partner hurt, even if this has nothing to do with work and everything to do with Harry being too fucked up to have a normal one-night-stand like the rest of the world.
“Thanks,” Harry says. He feels suddenly awkward about his almost nakedness and he pulls his shirt back on, avoiding looking at Daniel.
“I’ll be down in a second,” Harry says and pushes past Draco to lock himself in the bathroom. The sight of himself in the mirror shocks him. His right cheek is a deep purple, spreading varying shades of blue down to his chin and up to his eye. The rest of his face is covered in tiny red dots. Probably from the lack of oxygen, he thinks absently, raising his chin to look at the bruising on his neck. He looks like a mess, and he thinks he probably feels worse.
Matt shoves one of Harry’s hands out from under him and he goes face-first into the floor. Pain explodes in his cheek, but at the same time Matt closes a fist around his aching cock and pulls it roughly and the sensations seem to blend together and Harry comes in thick splotches on the floor. Matt groans and empties himself in Harry, then immediately pulls out.
“Harry can be bisexual and aromantic,” Hermione offers. “Romantic and sexual attraction are two separate things.”
Draco places a calming hand on Harry’s knee, and it sends tingles through his entire body. “It’ll be fine. If any of the other Aurors ask we’ll tell them it’s an undercover identity we’ve created.”
like how it makes me feel and then I don’t really want to touch them or look at them at all, and I feel kinda bad afterwards.”
Harry blushes with the knowledge that he’s just given Draco full insight into just how much he likes to hear what Draco has to say.
“Oh,” Harry says. They don’t speak about the war or the following year often, but when they do it’s mostly one of them sharing and the other just listening. It’s helped Harry, to talk about it without getting too many answers or opinions, and he hopes it’s helping Draco too.
“I’m horny,” Harry admits. “And it’s frustrating because it feels like being hungry and going to the kitchen to find nothing that looks appetizing.”
“Of course, I believe Minerva hid it in that cabinet over by the globe,” Dumbledore says, sounding just like he had when he lived.
“Ginny can’t move out, she’s supposed to be my person. Ron was my person, he was my first ever person actually. The first one who loved me since my parents died. The first one to really
“I bet we know a frightening amount about each other, if we start to think about it. We did live in the same castle for six years, after all,” Harry says, taking another sip from his coffee.
“Matt,” calls an angry voice from the darkness. Harry can’t see his face, but he hears Draco’s gasp next to him. The man takes a step forward, and light hits his face. It is, without a doubt, Crabbe. Matt hands Martin his drugs and takes the money before turning and walking towards Crabbe. Seconds later Martin leaves the alley, breathing hard. The memory fades out when he rounds the corner.
When the finger in his arse disappears and doesn’t come back Harry’s eyes focus back on Draco, and he watches, spellbound, as Draco takes his time lubing up his cock. He’s biting his lips and breathing hard as his hand works his cock, and Harry wants to beg all over again, but he can’t make his mouth form words.
Draco smiles. “And today I think you should take some time. Get some rest, and think long and hard about what you like and don’t like in bed. We won’t do anything at all until I know what we both enjoy and what our boundaries are with each other.”
When Draco finally enters him, Harry pulls hard on his restraints and uses the leverage of his legs around Draco’s waist to lift his own hips off the bed. “Fuck, oh fuckfuckfuck, Draco! Gah!”
Because even if he still sees Ginny all the time going from ‘person’ to ‘colleague’ isn’t what he wants. He wants a person. Someone who’s committed to being friends with him like they’re committed to a partner. He wants a name to put down as an emergency contact at St. Mungos, a person to talk to on a crappy day. Someone he won’t have to pretend with, that can stand seeing all the ugly sides of him and still love him. Someone who won’t stop being his person the second they find romantic love. He wants to stop being a placeholder for someone while they wait for romantic love. He just wants a person. A forever-friend, a flatmate that won’t ever move out because living with him is enough for them.
“My mind has gone down every path on why you did what you did, but this one seemed the least plausible,” Draco continues. “That you wanted to keep it because you wanted to just, know me.”
“Should we go up then?” Harry asks, giving Matt a soft smile. “Can’t imagine he’s a man who likes to be kept waiting.”
Harry laughs too, and breaks off into a groan when Draco’s cock slams against his prostate. “I don’t normally, aah fuck, say anything at all.”
“Maybe he just wasn’t the right person for you,” Ginny says, her voice soothing. “You’ll find someone to love. Just give it time.”
“I want that too,” Draco says. “You’ve become my best friend and I don’t want that to end. I don’t want us to change at all, I love what we have right now. Let’s be forever friends?”
He read the books Neville sent over and set to work making his vegetable garden. In the afternoon or evenings, he chatted with M, until it got to the point where M felt like a natural part of his life. Harry found himself bringing the man up in conversations with Ron and Hermione, and he thought about him when he worked on his garden. M was funny, and clever, and he talked about life like he’d spent just as much time as Harry thinking about it.
“Please can we talk about Potions now?” Harry begs, pulling his Potions book out of his bag and slamming it on the table next to his parchment.
Harry wants everything. He wants to touch and taste and feel. He wants Malfoy’s hands on him, in him. He wants to watch as Malfoy lets go. And he wants to hear it. The thoughts. The little words of adoration and confirmation Malfoy thinks, but never says out loud. He doesn’t want to lose it. Not yet.
“Harry, please!” Draco says, and he’s closer now. Harry should speed up, but it hurts to breathe in the cold air and Draco sounds so sad. And maybe Harry isn’t the only one who’s selfish.
that shows he cares. A whispered word of affection, or a soft kiss on Harry’s forehead. Something that’s just for Draco, since he thinks Harry’s asleep. When Draco is dressed though, he walks out without even pausing for a final look. Harry holds his breath until he hears the crack of Disapparition, keeping his sobs locked in until Draco won’t hear. When he finally exhales he finds he doesn’t want to.
. Ron has probably noticed too, but Harry can never tell if his friend is being oblivious or considerate – he’s too good at not acknowledging the elephant in the room.
Malfoy's smile grew at Harry's admission, and his eyes glinted with arousal. "I'll just have to teach you then. Wait here."
“I used to dream about this, you know?” Draco murmurs. He closes his hand around his own cock and groans, eyes fluttering shut. “I dreamed about everything from this exact thing, me getting ready to fuck you in your bed, marvelling at how good you look when you’re all flushed and hot and desperate for it. I dreamed about you finding me in France and giving me a blowjob that was all furious and resentful attraction. I dreamed about letting you watch as I finger myself and then riding that wonderful cock of yours until we both come.”
He walked off the stage and Apparated home, figuring if he was going to feel this lonely at least he should be alone. Of course, he wasn’t alone at home either. His house was never empty anymore.
Draco shuffles closer from his kneeling position between Harry’s legs until his knees rest against the inside of Harry’s thighs. He hooks his arms under Harry’s knees and lifts them up, placing his hands down on the bed beside Harry’s chest effectively keeping his legs pinned. Harry feels exposed and open, and his breath comes faster  with anticipation of what’s next. He feels Draco’s cock against his rim, moving up and down as Draco jerks his hips.
“Is it weird that I want pizza?” Draco asks when they return from their two weeks in Rome. He’s got a slight tan, and Harry can’t stop thinking how strange he looks without his usually pale skin.
Harry closes his eyes against the rush of grief. It’s been more background noise than anything else for years now. Seeing this place though... The last time he and Ron saw the Great Hall it had been filled with bodies. Fred, Remus, Tonks and so many others.
Harry's eyes flickered to the red bracelet circling Malfoy's wrist and he shivered with want. Without giving himself time to think better of it he walked over to the man, cutting off a pink-haired girl.
“Open your eyes,” Malfoy says. Harry does and gapes at the sight of himself in a full-length mirror Malfoy has conjured. “Don’t worry, it’s one way. Everyone sitting behind it can still see us.”
Harry comes down from his orgasm in a state of bliss. He tingles with aftershocks, and he opens his eyes to look at Draco who isn’t hiding his face anymore. Instead, he’s staring down at Harry with a look of pure awe that makes Harry wish he could come all over again.
he’s doing this? His erection didn’t need long to recover from almost murdering a classmate, and it’s a strong argument that he’s not doing this just to break a stupid bonding spell. He’s actually become quite fond of hearing Malfoy’s whisper in his ear, now that he thinks about it. There are only a few minutes left of class now, and Harry hears it with increasing frequency. His own name, spoken softly and with an intensity that leaves him breathless.
“What do you want, Potter,” Draco demanded. His hands were on Harry’s arse again, rubbing at the sensitive skin there and slipping in between his legs to brush almost invisibly over the back of Harry’s aching cock. “Tell me to go and I’ll go. Ask me to fuck you and I will. Tell me nothing, and we keep doing this.”
The balcony is somehow ten times the size it used to be, and covered in thick grass. Alya runs onto it and starts sprinting around in circles, her tail wagging so hard Harry’s afraid it might hurt.
“It’s not your job to save the world,” Ron said, apparently seeing the guilt on Harry’s face. “I know you were forced to do it, but just because you saved everyone once doesn’t mean you have to keep doing it. If anything, I think it’s somebody else’s turn.”
Harry lets their laughter warm him from the inside out. He doesn’t have to hide, not with these people. He can just be himself, even though he’s still figuring out who that is.
“No, you shut up. Because I’m in love with you too. I’m an idiot, but I swear I didn’t leave because my feelings for you disappeared when I knew you were J.”
“I want to have you in my life forever. I want to keep being your person when you need one, and I want you to be mine. I don’t want either of us to worry that the other one is out looking for a trade-up or replacement, but at the same time I don’t want either of us to feel limited or restricted by it. I want to commit to being your friend.”
Back in his room Harry sits on his bed and considers what memories to show Draco. He starts at the end, how he fell broken to the floor when Draco left him. Then he shows him that morning, Harry’s utter bliss when he brushed his teeth. He makes sure to extract the memories in first person, so Draco will feel what Harry felt. Hear what he thought. Harry extracts the first time he looked at Draco in the morning sunlight and thought ‘I’m falling in love with you’. He extracts his thoughts and feelings of joy and pride when Draco fucked him with his fingers, all the while thinking praise and adoring thoughts. He extracts the longing desperate need he’d felt the week before they kissed. Then for good measure he extracts the conversation with Ron, the one that had made Harry blush so furiously on their first day together in the library.
In dream logic the door had closed and Malfoy had Harry pressed up against it, his hands tight around Harry’s wrists as he held them pinned to the wall. Harry had groaned and tried to push closer and Malfoy had smirked, leaning in to brush soft lips against Harry’s ear. Harry’s hips had buckled and Malfoy had pushed forward to meet them. Then Harry’s clothes were gone, and Malfoy was on his knees in front of Harry, wet lips inches from his aching cock. And then Harry had woken up.
Ron rolls his eyes. “You can laugh all you like mate, but I’m pretty sure you don’t know the next bit and it’s just as obvious.” Ron pauses for a steadying breath. “You have a
“Intusemper Discerecor,” Malfoy reads. “It looks like a mix of words that have been shortened together; Intus, Semper, Discere and Cor. I believe it means something like learn the truth of my heart. Intus Discerecor is a type of bonding spell I think, but I’ve never seen it with the Semper added. It means always.”
“Yeah,” Harry agrees, forcefully reminding himself that he doesn’t get to be disappointed that that’s all Draco wants. He knew that going in.
,” Harry said, turning to the side and running a hand over his own arse. ”Just in case we feel up to round two in a bed later.”
"Take me home," he begged, no longer bothering to lower his voice. "Please, Draco, I want to finish this."
Harry’s mouth fell open in a soft gasp as Draco’s fingers tightened a little in his hair. “I like that. Your hand in my hair, I mean. It feels good when you pull it. And I like kneeling for you like this. I like that you’re in control.”
Malfoy grabs Harry’s potions book and opens it before Harry can stop him. He looks at the pages and squints.
Harry looked at the bed he shared with Draco most nights and wondered when the man had last slept in his own flat. It had been at least three weeks. Was Draco aware he had moved in, or had it been an accident? Harry hadn’t been aware, not until now, but the realisation only made him see how much he wanted Draco to move in.
"Hi Guys, want to make it a triad?" the pink-haired girl asked, making Harry stiffen. He didn't mind triads, but he wanted Malfoy to himself.
“And the only thing you’d need from me is that I show up once or twice a year to make a speech?” Harry asked.
“Yeah alright,” Harry agrees, “I think we’ll have to set it up here though. Your and Pansy’s flat runs entirely on magic, and the TV needs electricity. Did you get anything to watch?”
Harry pulls out of the memory with his eyes closed, taking a moment to gather himself as his consciousness settles back into his body.
Harry doesn’t comment much on the movie until Gandalf dies. The way he falls and keeps falling reminds him of how Dumbledore had died, and he feels himself close off like he always does when his emotions get too big. The Hobbits don’t do that though. They’re on the ground weeping with their pain, and something about it feels like strength.
“So, it’s not just satisfying some curiosity?” Malfoy says, remaining by the door like he’s decided he needs this clarified before they touch. He must know as well as Harry does that once they start touching, they won’t stop.
Harry looked down at the journal and smiled as the warm feeling from earlier sank back in. Maybe his thoughts weren’t so big and scary if he didn’t work so hard to avoid them?
Harry rolls his eyes. “Still not a Vampire, Draco. Though if it eases your worry I swear I’ll flee the country if I ever become one.”
Harry smiles and takes a sip of his beer. “I should see them more,” he admits. “I haven’t been very present lately, have I?”
Draco keeps staring, mouth open and eyes wide and looking less put together than Harry’s ever seen him. “You — you love me?”
Draco stepped closer to Harry, a smirk spreading over his face and his eyes wild with want. He drew his wand and with a flick and a muttered spell Harry’s clothes vanished, leaving him naked and shivering in the cold room. Another muttered spell warmed the room, and Harry smiled in gratitude.
“Finally,” Draco growled. His hands were on Harry’s hips in an instant and he must have already lubed up his cock because it rubbed deliciously over Harry’s rim, dragging over the oversensitive skin there.
“Yes, Draco,” Harry said, spreading his knees and exposing his arse to Draco. He felt torn between hiding in embarrassment and humping up against the mattress, but managed to stay still. He hoped Draco wouldn’t notice the lube Harry had used when he fucked himself earlier, in preparation for the party.
Draco gave a smile that looked so dangerous Harry would have felt scared if he hadn’t learned to trust Draco by watching how he dominated other people at the BDSM parties. Instead, he just felt aroused. Draco bent down to pick up his wand, and to Harry’s surprise he felt his bonds fall loose. Blood rushed back into his hands and feet and they prickled with returned sensation.
Harry wonders for a moment if it would be easier to let Draco think he was addicted to drugs, just like he lets Draco think he drinks way more than he does.
Harry laughs, some of the anxiety bubbling in his stomach escaping with it. “That’s definitely true. Thank you, Pansy, for finding a way for me to blame Ginny for my terrible boyfriend skills.”
Harry laughed too, making sure to squint his eyes just enough that it looked genuine. “Millie keeps track of all that. I’m too busy having a good time.”
Nothing comes next, apparently. Harry stays, leaning against Malfoy with his breath speeding with every second Malfoy doesn’t move. He needs to be touched or to touch. He needs
Harry gives his partner a weak smile. “I think they were right in that, for the first few years at least.”
Draco ran a finger down the cleft of Harry’s arse, letting it dip a little into the fluttering ring of muscle there. “Harry, have you played with your arse today?” Draco managed to sound both amused and strict as he spoke.
"Why are you with me, Harry?" Daniel asks, face suddenly constricted with a sadness Harry's only ever seen the shadows of before.
“You did it!” Draco says when the menu of the movie pops up on the screen and the music starts playing. “This one is about magic, isn’t that fun? The Muggles don’t even believe in magic but they make up their own kind to put in their stories.”
“It’s lovely!” Hermione exclaimed when he showed them the garden. “And the spellwork is really impressive.”
“We’re in a hallway,” Malfoy whispers, lips wet against Harry’s ear. Despite his words he doesn’t stop the gentle roll of his hips against Harry.
“Draco,” Harry gasps. He never wants this to end, and yet all he wants is to feel the rush of orgasm flood his body. He wants to watch Draco’s face open with pleasure, wants to feel his cock spasm and spurt inside him.
Harry walked over to the river and noticed a few stone steps leading down to a small bridge. Beyond that was a small trail leading into the forest. It was probably the route he would have taken there if he couldn’t Apparate.
Draco had long since finished hanging his coat and he shuffled a little under Harry’s stare. And shit, he really was staring. Blushing a little Harry turned his head to focus on the tomato he was supposed to be dicing.
"I suppose we'll have to go undercover in the Muggle drug-world, I've no idea how else we're going to find him."
“So, just an alcoholic and insomniac then? Better, I suppose, though still a disaster. I assume you’ve forgotten all about our case?”
Harry waits until Ron and Hermione have gone down the stairs before he tries again to walk further from the Dining Hall. Once more his wrist goes icy cold and then freezes mid-air. It feels like someone has put up an invisible barrier that everything but his wrist can move through.
Harry felt suddenly angry. He was doing his best with the circumstances he had. The Prophet article had been a surprise when it came out. The day previous Harry had been in what he thought was a happy and loving relationship with Alex. He really thought he’d found someone who saw past the job Harry did as a celebrity to the real person he was underneath.
“Sure,” Ron grins, “but you’re helping me with my Potions homework after my class. You’re getting first class tutoring after all.”
Harry doesn’t have time to ask what she means. Doesn’t have time to summon his wand from the bedside table. The red light of a Stupefy hits him and he’s out before he hits the floor.
Harry reached for the closest book and forced his brain to focus on the words instead of going down a dark road.
“Harry? Harry, are you home?” Draco calls from the hallway. It’s a Friday afternoon and Harry’s been enjoying his day off with baking chocolate cupcakes to celebrate the beginning of summer. It had all gone well enough until Draco’s Apparition had startled him so bad chocolate frosting had gone everywhere.
Harry rolls his eyes and holds up a hand to be helped up from the ground. His jeans are already wet and he’ll be freezing cold in a second.
Malfoy barks a surprised laugh. “I’m not sure I was any less of a git right after the war, Potter. I like to think I’ve grown into being only annoying and occasionally rude at this point though.”
“Green,” he said, wanting to reassure the man behind him. It seemed to be what Draco had been waiting for because as the final syllable left Harry’s mouth Draco’s hips slammed forward and Harry screamed in
Malfoy lifts his head to smirk at Harry, then tightens his fist around Harry’s cock and leans down to bite hard against Harry’s clavicle. Harry gasps and thrusts into Malfoy’s fist.
for when men rolled up their shirtsleeves. Something about a shirt and smart trousers looked so put together, and then with the sleeves rolled up they looked like they were ready to bend Harry over the table and –, no he couldn’t go there. Not even in his head. Not if he didn’t want to get hard while dicing tomatoes.
“So you’re saying I should take a sick-day to think about sex?” Harry asks, trying to hide his embarrassment with humour.
Draco turns to Harry then, and Harry aches to know what he’s thinking. To know if he’s ruined this for good or if there is hope for them.
Harry pops open the button on his jeans and starts pushing them down, wiggling beneath Malfoy to get them off. His pants go down with the jeans, but he’s beyond feeling embarrassed. He wants to be close, skin to skin, feeling everything.
After hours of working together in the library Harry thinks maybe this bond thing won’t be so terrible after all. Maybe the ‘always’ bit of the spell won’t even work and it’ll just pass on its own in a month. And if it doesn’t, staying close to Malfoy while he figures out how to break it won’t be so bad now that Malfoy isn’t acting like a spoiled brat.
“You shut up, I’m in this mess because of that nasty bonding spell you made to cast on my mum,” Harry snaps.
“I wasn’t sure if I was going to fuck you or not,” Malfoy says. “But looking at you now? Looking at how desperate you are to be had? I’m going to fuck you so hard you’ll scream.”
“You could roll up your sleeves, if you’re warm,” Harry offered and made sure to direct his gaze back to the tomato in order to give Draco time to react to that privately. He wasn’t sure how the other man felt about showing his mark.
“Please, will you look? I want you to know. I want to make it right. Please,” Harry says. He’ll get down on his knees and beg if it’ll do any good. He can’t lose this.
“You’ve grown into something,” Harry says, unable to keep his eyes off where Malfoy’s sleeves are rolled up to just below his elbows. He has to resist the urge to reach out and run his fingers over the exposed skin. Merlin, he needs a wank.
Hermione released her lip from between her teeth and it wobbled with emotion. “You told us he worked at St Mungo’s. And then you said he’d been on the wrong side of the war. There’s only one reformed Death Eater working there, I was on the committee that approved it years ago. I wanted to tell you, but you had asked me not to and I didn’t want to ruin anything.”
“A couple more things first,” Draco says. “First, and I guess this could be considered a limit. I don’t share, not unless I’m there myself. No more finding blokes like Matt.”
Ron sat up straight on the sofa and messed up his hair. He made circles with his fingers and held them over his eyes, imitating glasses. “I can’t be Harry Potter anymore. I need to be just Harry. They’re different people. I can’t call him Malfoy, or M. I need to use Draco, they’re all three of them the same person, but also not, so they need different names.”
“You talk as if I would know a single thing about romantic relationships,” Draco says, but their voices are coming closer and Harry knows he’ll soon be sharing a bed with the both of them.
Harry sits on the floor to pick up the papers scattered there. “It won’t. We swore we’d have no desk-fillers. And besides, Crabbe isn’t a genius — we’ll figure out a way to flush him out. We just need one of our brilliant plans.”
Draco takes him home, Apparating them straight into Harry’s bedroom and kissing him while they’re still breathless from the journey.
“DVD?” Harry laughs. “Alright let’s get it set up, then we can have a movie and cupcake night. Pansy and Ginny are off on a date this evening so we can order in Indian takeout.”
“Take me to bed?” Harry asked, breaking the kiss and shifting on Draco’s lap. “We should celebrate.”
“Drop it, or I shoot. And not a word, I know how those things work.” Matt’s voice is cold, and through the haze of his throbbing head Harry suddenly feels afraid. Draco could be hurt, he could be hurt, all because Harry wasn’t quick enough. Because he didn’t think to consider Matt a proper threat.
“If you want nothing to do with me after that’s alright,” Harry says. “I mean, it’ll hurt, but I’ll get it. But at least that way you walk away from it knowing as much about me as I do about you.”
Harry escapes to put on his shoes and coat before anyone can insist they should celebrate together. He hears Draco speaking behind the wall, but he can’t make out the words. When Draco joins him in the hallway Harry goes back to the livingroom to get the wand he left behind only to find Pansy and Ginny passionately kissing. He decides to leave the wand and walks out of the flat as fast as his feet will carry him.
“Draco, please. I can’t — I need. Please.” Harry knows his words don’t make sense, but Draco seems to understand anyway because his hand wraps firmly around Harry’s cock and Harry lets out a guttural groan at the feeling.
Draco looks blankly at him as Harry's heart beats so hard against his ribcage he thinks it might bruise.
Harry looks down at Draco’s cock. It’s thick and gorgeous and flushed with arousal, Harry imagines the burn and stretch of taking it all in and drags in a ragged breath.
“Harry James Potter, is that you apparating home from a hookup? With a bloke?” Ginny half screams, running into the hallway and grinning like a loon.
“Yeah, sure.” Harry agrees without giving it too much thought. He has no desire to disrupt class or start a fist fight in the corridor after all.
“I’m not angry. I think maybe I wasn’t angry. I was just hurt and confused because I wasn’t sure if you were only with me to break the bond or not, and if it was true that you wanted to keep the bond I didn’t understand that either.” Draco is talking with his eyes closed and a pinched expression on his face. It’s clearly taking effort for him to explain, to share his thoughts and feelings and it makes Harry’s heart warm to look at him.
“Hmm, you like that, don’t you?” Draco asked, taking an experimental pull at Harry’s hair. For a second Harry considered pulling his mouth off Draco to respond, but he didn’t want to break the contact between them, and there were other ways to communicate what he liked. Instead of a verbal response he took Draco deeper into his mouth and sucked, his tongue gently rubbing at the underside of Draco’s cock.
The club is loud, but not unbearably so. Harry figures if Ginny has got him this far he might as well keep following her, and he lets her lead him up the stairs to a far quieter pub. He can still hear Rihanna playing on the floor below, but he can also hear Ginny asking him what he wants to drink.
bad – because they always turn out to be so much worse. He stares in mute disbelief as Draco sodding Malfoy walks to the front of the classroom and stands in front of the class, clearly ready to start a lesson. Draco Malfoy is going to teach Harry potions.
“Oh, erm, I was out on a walk,” Harry says. It’s getting increasingly difficult to hide the bloody bond from Ron and Hermione, but Harry’s decided to figure it out on his own and he’s nothing if not stubborn.
“And, uh, when you fuck me,” Harry hesitated, “I like it rough. I like to feel the burn of stretching around something a little too big.”
As it turns out though, Draco is the one with his emotions on the outside. He goes suspiciously quiet towards the end of the movie, and when the credits roll and Harry sneaks a glance over at him he’s full on crying.
“Knew you were desperate for me, Potter,” Draco said. He ran a hand up the inside of Harry’s knee up to his groin, sending shivers through Harry. His skin felt oversensitive, like every inch of it had a direct connection to his cock.
“No, it’s fine,” Draco soothes her. “It is a bit sad sometimes. In a lot of ways I really do want a relationship like you and Pansy have, I just can’t ever seem to find someone I want it with. It’s a little like when you get a day off and you think it’ll be so lovely to just sit down and enjoy a good book, light a candle and just get lost in the story. Only then you read the back of dozens of books, and none of them really interest you, so you just pick one at random, and then you sit down with your candlelight and realise you can’t see the letters properly because it’s too dark so you have to turn the light on, but then the chair isn’t at all comfortable and you try to keep reading because you’ve been looking forward to having a day off with just you and a book for days, but you’re not actually enjoying it because even though that’s the perfect day for someone it’s just not for you. And yeah, sometimes you envy the people who can enjoy that and you really wish you did enjoy it, but you just like a nice bath and music so much more.”
Harry hadn’t thought his heart could break more than it had when Ginny announced she’d be moving out, but it breaks for Draco now, because he’s hurting just as much as Harry is.
The time passes too fast, seeming to slip even faster from his fingers as he tries to clutch it harder, to slow it down. Draco goes from tasting wedding cakes to restoring a wing of the manor for him and Astoria to live in, to the traditional courting that usually take place before an arranged marriage. Harry stays in his flat, waiting and ready whenever Draco has a spare moment to visit. He breaks apart again and again, and even when he thinks he doesn’t have anything left in him that’s whole, he keeps breaking.
Harry smiles at that, at how home can be both a place and a feeling and how happy he is to have both. “Yes, let’s go home.”
Draco noticed and closed a firm hand around Harry’s cock, and fuck, it almost hurt he was so sensitive.
Harry waves at Ron and then grabs one of the trays at the end of the serving table and fills it with a glass of orange juice, coffee, buttered toast and some strawberries. He’s tempted to grab one of the chocolate covered pastries too, but he figures it’s a bad idea to start the morning on a sugar high.
Ron bites his lip and draws his eyebrows together, ears turning a light red. “Do you think it’s time we tell him?”
Harry’s beyond grateful that Malfoy isn’t hearing his unfiltered thoughts, though constantly hearing Malfoy’s voice in his ear isn’t helping the issue either. It’s always in a whisper or a softly spoken tone that makes Harry feel as if Malfoy is standing pressed against him and speaking into his ear. Sometimes, when it catches him off-guard, he swears he can almost feel Malfoy’s lips against the back of his neck. Harry still just hears snippets of the thoughts Malfoy has about him; stray words or sentences every now and again. He suspects Malfoy is using Occlumency to shield his thoughts. He always was a paranoid git after all.
The past few lessons Harry has found himself enjoying his Potions classes for the first time in his life. And not just because he can stare at Malfoy for long, uninterrupted moments, while he lectures. When Harry is paying attention to him it turns out that Malfoy is actually a good teacher. He explains things in a way that makes sense even to Harry, and allows them breaks in between lecturing to work on written questions or to examine various potions. Harry has started looking forward to his Potions lessons more than any of the others, and he should probably be enjoying this class too. This one is different though, Harry can’t make his brain focus on whatever it is Malfoy is saying.
