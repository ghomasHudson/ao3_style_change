“It’s always good to find what you like. What did you study in school?” Thomas leaned in, eager to find out more. They were so inquisitive, it was borderline intrusive.
She takes over then, switching the conversation to finances and he almost relaxes. It’s easy enough to answer, things are very straightforward now.
Heaven knows, it’s got to be this time
parts of America had only joined in the last 100 years, and that was just the muggle parts. It was such a
Did he see what Draco was afraid of when he looked at him, all covered in glamours and finely tailored clothes, pale and sneering? When he’d thought of the future, he’d imagined that one day they’d die together but never as enemies. Not then and not now and yet they were twisting into violent, painful creatures.
The tea shop was roughly half way between their prior temporary residences, high enough class that they would have a special service for tea and once they were back, they simply just kept up the meeting. Particularly after the death of his father.
was nervously drinking again, he should slow down. He took a deep breath. So much was happening. He knew how they got here, it just had happened so fast he hadn’t said anything. He wasn’t sure he could stop it now.
“ she told him on the rare monthly (expensive) floo call they had. She’s become a bit batty after moving to Paris and becoming a seer to muggles, living her days in the Latin quarter and wearing black lipstick; but her opinions, as always, were more truthful than anything. She felt no need to lie, preferring to always tell some shade of the truth, which worked exceptionally well in her job. People were always looking for the news that they wanted to hear but lacked the strength to admit.
“You know, if you can’t afford the expensive corner store ice cream or you just can’t be arsed to walk down the street.” Sometimes Harry would get like that, like the Muggle part of him, the part where he’d grown up in years of ignorance of magic, would rear up and demanded to be noticed. It was something he was conflicted on. It rose up in the most unlikely places, like getting a ‘telly’ to watch ‘football,’ for what Draco considered the most boring waste of time ever. Harry didn’t even support a team. But regardless of how many times they both fell asleep watching the little men run around on the screen, every Saturday Harry seemed compelled to turn it on and he was compelled to join him. They would sit, muted, Draco half reading whatever he was in the middle of and Harry staring blankly at the screen, until he dozed off, Draco not far behind him. It was almost something like a ritual, a quiet space they built around themselves.
, And I get bummed out,” and “If you feel like giving up, just make a mess of me, I’ll always clean it up...”
“It’s nice to meet you,” he says, sitting down and hoping he’s not shaking too much. It feels just as cold in here as it did before, but he’s certain it’s just a memory. “Liza, John.” He nods to both of them. Cathleen marks something down on her papers in front of her and he hopes he hasn’t fucked it up already.

“And we're standing in the hallway
“Or I,” Weasley said, kissing the top of Granger’s head, “Could just go to bed and wait for you.”
Potter laughed, shaking his head, “It would, wouldn’t it? What would you suggest then? Slytherin green? Ravenclaw blue? Not Hufflepuff yellow?”
He merely dropped the sneer and sniffed, turning his back fully to focus on Rebecca. It was an old trick of Father’s, to make the room feel as if they were an inch tall, and then cement his status by completely ignoring them and it seemed it would work again, because the chatter picked up but in a hushed tone and everyone avoided them.
Patel’s Emporium was clearly capable of great and powerful things.
Who would have thought Harry had such a flair for the dramatic?
“Hmm,” Cathleen tuts, looking right at him before marking something down.
There was silence in the aisle.
“But it wasn’t just hate. It was distrust. And anger. And shame. Shame that I even existed. So they did what they thought they had to do. They kept me locked away, in a cupboard under the stairs. If I was lucky, they’d let me out, to cook and clean for them, as I was such a burden on their lives.” He sounded hoarse, and rushed, and scared, even now, “Vernon would hit me, if I messed something up, and so would my aunt, if I didn’t cook just right. And my cousin grew up to do the same. I didn’t have any friends, or any toys, just what I could scrounge from... from the donation bin and the trash. They gave me my cousin’s hand me downs— I was never big for my age, kept shut away in a small space and underfed, when I wasn’t punished. Every so often,” Harry’s voice cracked, “I’d get a real meal, instead of table scraps from dinner. And I’d pretend, that someone who loved me had made it for me, instead of myself.” He swallowed hard and water— tears had started falling from his chin. “When Hagrid finally came to get me, it was my 11th birthday. The first time anyone had told me happy birthday or made me a cake, simply because I was there and existed.” He let out a shaky breath, seemingly exhausted.
It felt like the sort of day that would never end. By now, they (mostly the Americans) had worked their way through bread and through some appetizers, now waiting on their main dishes with glasses of rich Spanish Rioja on the table.
“Oh,” Cynthia said with a flap of her hand, “It was an easy flight.”
“Too many,” Tommy laughed. “And I’m trying to get my master’s from U of I in linguistics— there’s a lot of great stuff people have been doing with idiolects that I want to use with some of the hate groups I mentioned—even the Unenchanted use it! They caught the Unabomber in ‘96 using all the letters he wrote and compared them to his manifesto. It’s real fascinating stuff. And as part of my courses, I’m doing a work study with Cynthia here, which is why we’re both here.” Draco only understood half of it, unaware of what most of it meant. Just more nonsense words to add to the pile. He could feel a headache coming on.
They were utterly fucked, is what she wouldn’t say.
, Draco thought with hollow vindication,
literally everything else. Not to say Americans are special or some BS like that, but the school should probably reflect the country more than just duplicating British imperialism. Come on, the ruler of a country stepping down on a schedule? For that matter, a ruler picked by vote and
“It’s a two for one deal—emotional
“Sounds like fascinating work,” he settled on, politely continuing the conversation, sipping his wine, “How long do you think such a project will take?” He was certain he could the headache building in his temples.
“A bit of a packaged deal,” Harry mused.
he was giving too much away.
“—So I said to her, Mione, we don’t
Instead he strode over, pushing his slightly singed hair back into shape and with all the authority of his forebears, said in an icy tone, “What is the matter here?”
“One day, Rebecca, should we gain custody, she’s going to want to know
“You missed it,” Draco told him with mild interest, “Just so happens that same lot of aurors just walked in and posted a list of those Injured or killed which sent everyone in a frenzy to hospital.” Harry frowned but he wasn’t a part of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement during the war so maybe that was standard procedure for mass casualty events.
And it wasn’t untrue—he was not the same person that people knew in school and shortly thereafter, it had taken time and a period of isolation and now, seeing it all laid before him, both options, he was never going back.
He told Harry about a lot of things—how he’d started reading during his imprisonment and what he read and what he thought about the books. Sometimes those conversations would spill into their lunches or their pub drinks when Ronald wasn’t there. Harry told him about ’his’ kids, who was succeeding and who needed more support, the work he was doing to save them. Sometimes Draco would make a recommendation on a family who could help. He told him about how he’d joined Blaise’s firm after months of needling by the other Slytherin, a story that had left Harry in stitches, remarking how he’d have to thank Zabini one day for the laughter. It was really nice, coming home to see the standard ministry owl sitting there, waiting for a treat, or watching Harry walk up to the pub, a moment or two late as always.
It was...nice.
“Right, well,” he paled and flushed at the same time, it was quite a sight, “We’ll just be borrowing Malfoy and get him off your hands, sorry about that—” Draco ducked out of his ushering hand only barely, regardless of if he were an auror or not, one did not simply
Draco was lost in these thoughts again, stirring absently the cup of pale looking breakfast tea, the honey and milk long since mixed together when a pair of long, rangy arms slipped around him and he startled, slopping hot liquid over his hand.
It was halcyon, to say the least, before the trial had happened.
They stood in silence for a minute, looking at the content row of buildings.
help?” He didn’t lose his perfect posture but it was a near thing. He could hear the intention. Harry would never lose Rebecca, but Draco could. Draco was the anchor, dragging in the silt, until, at some point, he would catch on something and tear the boat in two.
“Keeping her company, fed and entertained until you could be bothered to come for her, yes,” said Harry, standing up with Rebecca behind him. Draco could already feel the thrum of energy in him, so used to it’s comforting safety. There was a time when that flare and crackle of power, like heat lightning, was turned on him but now it was the wall he could back himself against, knowing behind him was an ally.
Both of them felt ravenous then—as if they had each woken from a long sleep and needed something to fill them, something other than the aching feelings that had plagued them. Like waking up from flu—the fever abated and the appetite returned and the body seemed to right itself, just like magic.
In some ways, he pitied his Mother. He would look at her, struggling to speak her mind after years of conditioning and wonder if this was what she’d wanted. If she could have seen the path life would take stretching out in front of her, would she still pick Lucius out of love? Or out of duty?
“Yes...?” He looked devastated through that response.
It was Harry’s turn to stare, eye contact a familiar and ensnaring thing by now. And then he looked away, determined, as if the darkness held all the answers. Draco waited. And waited.
, you’re being ridiculous.” She cut him off, her cheeks slightly darker. “Thanks for returning him home, no doubt he would have splinched himself
So what could he say to her? She was trying to speak paragraphs in a sentence and he was trying to respond through occlumency and they were both avoiding the hidden curses laying between them.
“Now, let’s check the knee—“
As always, his brain answered before his mind could catch up, operating on some primal instinct.
“At least to people who know me as more than the Boy Who Lived and the Boy Who Defeated the Dark Lord,” Harry gave a wan smile. “More tea?”
No one else approaches them, but no one stares outright or glares either. It’s a warm feeling, surrounded by Harry’s friends and getting a little tipsy and actually promising to come to the next one, though hopefully in a more convenient pub. It’s not perfect, not by a long shot. Sometimes the conversation stalls and they all remember, at different times, the war they shared. If you asked him the next day, he wouldn’t be able to tell you what they talked about, only that he knew that Harry had rested a warm, nimble hand on his lower back no less that seven times. It’s far better than he could have imagined, so he’s not at all surprised that when he begs off (with a regret so unavailable during the firm Christmas Party) that he’s glad Harry offered to walk him home not out of obligation but out of a night well spent.
Ostensibly as Harry had felt the need to order dessert at every restaurant they visited, they often ended up talking about it as they finished their meal or on the walk home. He ate dessert as often as he could, trying a variety of never-ending sweets that, while doing nothing to add to his waistline, left his lips sweet. At least that was something Draco could get behind. But on a hot summer night like this one, the hot puddings at the restaurant would have been unbearable. So naturally, they had to find something else.
However, that wouldn’t change the fact that he is, in fact, doing just that, while Weasley comments on everything around them, frying pan sized hands gesturing wildly.
emotion until all there was was pain. What would be do next? Fling things from the shelves? Break crockery? Hurt people as they tried to flee?
“Always covering up with barbs, Mr. Malfoy, it’s very unbecoming,” He wiped away the tears
wish,” Harry echoes back. He’s not sure what his emotions look like, splayed out carelessly and open on his face, but whatever they are, Harry likes them because then they’re kissing again. And it’s not perfect but it’s a perfect moment, distilled into a memory that he’ll keep forever. They’d spent so long nearly crashing into one another, nearly drifting apart that this felt like settling into some bone deep rhythm that only they could feel. A shared pulse. Pansy had said something forever ago about ‘perfect, entrancing, celestial circles around one another’ and even if it wasn’t that’s what this felt like.
just slightly at that. Clearly he had no value on his remaining alive to reach his wedding anniversary.
“Is there really a whole town of Italians in America?” It would fit in with what Hermione’s notes about the country said.
adult knees knocking together. He remembered introducing himself when they were children at the entrance to the Great Hall. “At least it never feels like that.” Harry was silent, silent, he realizes because he wants him to continue.
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is still amazing, on of my favorite albums and short films of all time (Runaway slayed me in 2010 and I still haven’t recovered) and he’s gone kind of way downhill for me since then, but Ghost Town is just a perfect track. I cut it out at the last minute but I wanted to add this in, as the lines were just too poignant:
(See the end of the chapter for
So he sat there in the dark of his flat, staring out at the empty lights of the city, the moving stars in the sky, and cursed the entrancing nature of the Patel’s store. Wishing for morning to come quickly yet wishing he had more time.
Irish aurors, mostly in green with a white and orange Celtic pattern down the side, appeared to start turning the tide against the coordinated attack, streaming in from the high street and apparating into the area.
Draco couldn’t help but stare, in utter disbelief.
“Harry Potter, you are possibly the
You see, what you do is organize everything around concentric circles, from the lowest level of the organization to the highest level. Imagine it like this, you have a wide variety of bracelets on a wrist, and each of the beads is a different person. And instead of hierarchy, you have bracelet beads that pass information up and down the arm of bracelets. We have so many different districts and schools in all three countries, we need a better decentralized and yet centralized form of communication, so that way even the principal of a tiny school in Chiapas, Mexico feels as heard as a science teacher in a giant school of 10,000 students in California and as a Québécois special needs student aid would feel heard. It’s a complete departure from what we do now, to have these circles of management—“
“Enemy enough to nearly get each other expelled a few times, on purpose,” Draco said politely dodging the deeper point, tearing away his gaze.
“It’s a religion, Ronald,” Hermione told him, “Similar to how my parent’s are catholic, you know, the church, the priests, the crucifixes.” Slowly he nodded.
His chest felt tight and he could tell his heart was racing, the pounding of his own pulse in his ears.
After the trial, he and his mother had abandoned the manor. The reparations had cost a pretty galleon, so they’d sold the contents and left the shell, waiting and empty, for the next person to uphold the weight of the name it carried. He’d moved to London to be closer to the firm and his mother had moved into the cottage he’d held during the occupation. She had been confined, previously, to her sister’s residence, who’d offered her home and her hearth to her sister, stating bluntly
“I may be brilliant,” Hermione smiles at him, “But I’m not going to reinvent case law until I’ve completed my secondary schooling. They have an exceptionally wide range of employees, pupils and case law and regulations, spanning three countries and 400 years of history. Just in the last 30 years
stalking me, or I would have ended up a cannibal’s dinner,” or something like that and he knew Harry would never talk about it with him again. They could avoid it for the rest of their lives. Or he could push deeper.
“Auror Billings,” Potter added more forcefully, tearing his eyes away from Draco, “I believe that was an order from a superior.”
Instead of a large mansion secluded from wizarding and muggle society, it was a modest three flat on a quiet residential street. It was almost pedestrian how calm and muggle the street was; that the entire area seemed to be hushed but in a natural and peaceful way. It was outside of any war, muggle or wizard, and it would seem that it had been that way for a long while.
This topic of conversation, what Muggles studied, turned out to be quite the engaging one, because it took them all the way back to the flat and through a half bottle of wine while the sweets chilled in the freezer.
on Luna’s shoulder. I just—” He cut himself off, forcing his hands to unclench from where he was gripping Draco’s shoulders.
and so delightful and so fit that he felt like a loon with how much grinning he was doing.
“Really? You don’t have AC?” Draco shook his head. “Damn, I don’t know if I could survive the summer without AC. Way too humid.”
Tumblr: we-re-always-alright
“Italian food is her favorite.” She laughed back at him, lightly punching his arm, friendly and familiar. Draco blinked.
“Oh, thank you,” Draco says, flustered, just as Harry cuts in with, “Thanks, we practice at it daily.” Sending the table into another series of chuckles. There’s a small lull in conversation as the waiter comes by to take away empty plates that once held crisp bruschetta and meatballs in a rich sauce. He was really going to have to get in the habit of walking, maybe with Rebecca to the park or something, did muggle-raised children enjoyed parks? While Harry never seemed to put on enough weight for Draco to stop worrying, he himself seemed to be developing a bit of softness in places.
consider this: you’ve got 50 states of Unenchanted rules, 50 states of wizarding rules, 3 countries of federal rules, both Unenchanted and wizarding, and you have to somehow make sense of it and still keep the lights on. If anyone is going to be able to navigate two country and schools worth of rules, it’s going to be the crazy motherfuckers across the pond. Another thing to consider: American wizards and witches see themselves as
“Head Cursebreaker Malfoy,” Draco supplied, pulling out the full title for added oomph. The auror winced further, probably already feeling the sting of the chewing out he would receive later, the drilling of hierarchy already smarting.
“It’s hardly a palace, more of a flat really, I think it’s only 90 square meters and it’s in Pimlico so. Not really like a palace at all. I wouldn’t even mark it a single family home, only two bedrooms and a bath and a half, so not ideal for more than one or two people.” He seemed nervous now, maybe it was the porcelain; after all, this aisle was marked for ceramics. Draco shook his head slightly, trying to regain his wits about him. Potter looked at him quizzically, so clearly he’d noticed.
“Yes, we very likely do—Loreen passed her home study just as we did—”
“And what, you learned this...when?” Harry sighed and took Draco’s hand, as if the basics of arithmacy were just taught casually at Hogwarts, and continued walking with him towards their flat, the clouds rumbling more as they made their way up the street.
“What?!”
Maybe the ghost was only a passing thing, a near death experience and perhaps the fire within him wasn’t gone yet. Harry looked so brave and wonderful in front of him, even with all sorts of tears and mess on face, quietly brave even though he could feel him trembling under his hands. Love and bravery—two things he scarcely knew the depths of and yet here they were.
“This’ll be perfect,” Cynthia added to his reverie, already unpacking their files and two dense pieces of dull ‘plastic’ and more notebooks, pads and pens than potentially necessary while Thomas took their other bags upstairs. “Though I don’t suppose we could get the case files sent over and a couple of white boards and cork boards as well?” Even Harry looked at her blankly for a moment but stuttered back to life. Draco had assumed they would spend the first day strolling around, taking them out to a nice dinner with copious amounts of booze and talking about pleasantries. It’s what Father had always done when calling on foreign lords and what he’d told Harry to expect.
“Okay, so you are saying that this-” Harry pointed to his feathers “-are a bloody inheritance?”
----------------------------------------------------------
“Oh my… was that the Ferret?! We need to take Harry to another place right now!”
“Court, like…dating?! But ‘Mione, that’s
He got all the covers he could carry and took it to his room, along with dozens of pillows, and put it all on his bed. He tidied everything up until the bed looked more like a giant nest than an ordinary bed. It felt
“I was flying at a forest yesterday, learning how to use these bloody things, you know, and I saw a rabbit and I caught it with my claws. I… I almost took a bite from it before regaining my senses and leaving…”
“Harry, mate, are you…thinking straight?” Ron asked after lifting the invisibility cape.
“Let’s hope it’s just that.”
-------------------------------------------
“Hey man, calm down, I get it, you couldn’t control yourself, I forgive you, but please, don’t try rip out my eyes out again."
He hoped he wouldn’t need to see the familiar white harpy so soon.
The brightness of the room hurt his eyes, his whole body ached and his throat was tight. It was like the time the twins convinced him drink half a bottle of fire whiskey with them. It wasn´t very pleasant.
They apparated to the Hogwarts’ grounds, not wanting to be decapitated by an angry harpy, who seemed to not even recognize them.
He didn’t expect that the other harpy –
?! But that’s--”
He called Draco and they went to their nest, he got in position and began laying his egg. It was painful in a way he had never thought would be possible. His mate’s hand was almost breaking when the egg came out and Harry finally could rest. He laid down on the nest and watched his mate care for their egg, cleaning it and putting between they so it could be warm.
“We can’t, Ron. You saw how happy he was to be in there. It would be cruel to take him somewhere else just because he has an annoying neighbor.”
“What?!” Ron asked, stupefied “Look, ‘Mione, I know he seems to have…gained a little weight, it doesn’t mean he has a bun in the oven.”
---------------------------------------------
“Ron, what the flying fuck happened?”
– and dozed off on the sheets, his wings-like arms keeping him warm and feeling all right for the first time in a long time.
“He seems at ease to me, satisfied.” He answered “I think he will be better, maybe even happier, here.”
“Yeah, I guess…but it will be a nightmare when Rita Skeeter find out.”
“How do you forget that you
“He is sleeping. You should too. I will.” And, with that, Kreacher was gone with a quiet ‘pop’.
“Yes” Hermione answered “The Potter family seems to have some harpy blood, but it was diluted along the generations. So it jumped a lot of your ancestors, and it ended up affecting you.”
Even though he didn’t want to become an Auror or a Healer, it still hurt to know that the choice was taken from him because of an all-human Ministry.
And then, the screams began. The Boy-Who-Lived couldn´t control the pained creams that left his throat, and then, Kreacher, the house-elf that took care of Grimmauld Place, entered his room wondering what ‘was the damn master up to, waking him up in the middle of the bloody night’.
-------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
“We don’t know, but ever since this little one came out, we could think more rationally. I believe it’s because of the need to care for the hatchling that made us more like…before.” Draco answered. He couldn’t hold their old rivalry when he was mated to one of the Golden Trio.
He had never felt more excited.
It was, yet again, around midnight when something weird happened to Harry.
“Hermione!” Ron yelled when he entered their bedroom “Something’s wrong with Harry! He-he scratched me, and and he didn’t even looked like himself!”
---------------------------------------
“We understand, Harry.” Hermione cut her idiot of a boyfriend short “But we will keep coming here every week.”
“A bit scared, I guess… but I have to get used to it, right?”
He was confused, but he was happy he was in the nature, with the soft breeze on his face and his nest in a marvelous tree. He noticed he was in a wonderful hole in the mighty tree, far from the floor, but not too far so he could still see his preys. It was perfect.
“Look, there they are.” He said when the two harpies got out of the nest. They seemed fine, but there was something different about Harry, he seemed almost…
Thankfully, he didn’t even scratch the person before he gained his senses once again.
“Mate, are you alright –“Ron said before seeing Harry.
Harry sighed “Look, guys, I appreciate the effort. I really do. But I don’t want to go back to a world in which everything I did was in the front page of a journal, in which I am judged by everything I did by everyone. In which I am not truly free.” He took a deep breath “But here? I am completely free here, I am happier than I have ever been. I have a home, a true home, and a family. I…don’t want to give that up for a world I gave everything for but that gave so little back.”
“So Dark Forest it is.”
“Aunty! Uncle! Hello!” She waved at them.
Harry couldn’t be happier. He had a wonderful nest, an amazing mate and was pregnant with their first –hopefully of many- hatchling. He could feel the shell beginning to harden, so he would lay the egg in approximately two months, and he guessed it would hatch in the next year.
“Harry, mate, what is all this?” Ron had woken up after hearing someone rummaging through the sheets cabinet near his room.
For Kreacher, it was quite obvious what was happening, but, for Hermione and Ron, it confused them to see their friend passing through such a painful experience. They passed the rest of the night in their friend´s door with the house-elf, their worry doubling in size when they could no longer hear anything from Harry when the sun was beginning to show itself.
“Oh My—I told you this could happen when they began courting! Did you even listen to me?”
“Well, Rita Skeeter created the theory that you ran away to the USA, another reporter  said you went to France, and another one said you are hunting alligators somewhere in Africa.” she laughed “I have no idea how they came with those ideas, but let’s just say a lot of them went to these places looking for you.”
----------------------------------------
“Bloody hell, mate!” Ron yelled “What the fuck?”
It was a nice evening, he spent some very needed hours sleeping on his precious nest, and was tiding up his feathers so he could go hunting dinner comfortably.
Life was good.
Harry climbed onto his bed –
----------------------------------------------
Harry waited anxiously the arrival of his soon to be mate, his soft feathers ruffled up in excitement. He tidied up his nest the best he could to make it look the most comfortable possible and he stocked water and food in a corner of the nest.
-----------------------------------------------
It had already been four days since his inheritance, and he couldn’t wrap his head around the fact that he no longer had the same rights other wizards had. According to Hermione, who had already read all the books she could find about harpies, He no longer could become an Auror (something about it being too dangerous to the criminals), a Healer (because his claws could hurt someone even without meaning to) or any other stuff that including dealing closely with people.
The soft morning breeze on his face was revigorating.
“I don’t know! I just forget…”
“Oh my God, ‘Mione. Look, Harry accepted the squirrel! They are, like, dating now?!”
“But… how?”
“I thought we had more time before he began relying completely on his harpy instincts… I thought we could find a way to stop the process, but I couldn’t find anything…”
“That’s wonderful, honey!” Hermione said. After becoming the new Minister of the wizarding Britain, she could finally change some laws about magical creatures; one of them was that, if they wished to and had a magical core, they could engage in wizarding schools. It was great to see her nephew and so many other magical creatures going to Hogwarts, where they all created wonderful memories.
“I did, but I sorta kinda forgot…”
“Harry, if you rely fully on your instincts, you might never come back.” She said “You might have to live in a forest with for the rest of your life.”
As they neared the limits of the Dark Forest, they hear a loud screech from above. They looked up and saw another harpy; short blond hair shining with the sunlight, white feathers ruffled up because of the apparent danger to his nest.
After a while, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, Harry´s friends that were staying the night, barged into his room, their wands out, thinking some Death Eater somehow entered Grimmauld Place. They saw their friend tossing and turning on the bed, some weird thing covering his legs and arms, and threw every finish-spell spell they knew at their friend, which only made Kreacher yell at them.
He noticed his smirk only made Harry irritable and proceeded to put a squirrel in front of the dark one. That surprised the Boy-Who-Lived.
“…Ron, do you think we did the right thing?” Hermione asked her boyfriend. They were both under the invisible cape watching Harry, who was looking around seeming quite excited about his new home.
“But, ’Mione! It’s Malfoy!”
“Oh... But I am gay, and almost all harpies are women, and and even though it’s a rare inheritance, it’s even rarer for there to be a male harpy, and- “
“’Mione, what’s going on there?” Ron asked. He and his girlfriend were once again watching Harry under the invisibility cloak, and, that day, for some goddam reason, Draco Malfoy had approached Harry with a dead squirrel.
“Something else, like a fucking
After the struggle to get off the bed and walk into the bathroom, he looked at the mirror and gasped in surprise, firstly because he was without his glasses and could see clear as the day what happened to him, secondly because of the changes on his body.
“I, I am dealing with it, okay?”
When he woke up, he was no longer in the dark bedroom, but in a lovely forest with dense vegetation, thick tall trees and a lot of animals.
----------------------------------------------------
It was one of these days that Harry realized how lucky he was. He had wonderful children, a mate he loved and great friends. Life was good.
He reached the rabbit with his hind claws and, when he was beginning to fly up, another body hit him. It was big and heavy, with feathers as white as snow and claws as sharp as his. It was another harpy.
“Why do you say so?”
“Hey, mate, cheer up! It doesn´t seem so bad, I mean, you can fly!”
“Well, yesterday, I caught him staring at the window for two hours, and today he almost forgot to cook the meat at lunch. He was going to eat it raw.”
“What do you mean, ‘Mione?!”
“Hermione, Ron, I know you are in there.” Harry said loudly. He and Draco had become more like their old selves after the hatch of their egg. They talked a lot about speaking  to Harry’s friends, who ‘visited’ them once a week “You guys may come here. We won’t bite”
“…we have to take him to a forest. I believe the Dark Forest at Hogwarts would be the best.”
Six months passed and spring had come, making flowers bloom all around the forest. The bird’s song seemed louder and happier, the trees produced lots of different and juicy fruits, and the mating season of a lot of creatures had arrived, including the harpies.
One day, in one of their friend’s  weekly visits, Harry asked:
“Let’s hope so.”
“Stop this, you bloody idiots!” the house-elf said “He wasn’t cursed! He is simply getting his creature inheriterance! Get out of here! Now!” he kicked them out of the bedroom, his master’s voice growing hoarse with the passing of the time until he could only groan and whimper in pain.
“’Mione, how are the journals dealing with my ‘disappearance’?”
A few weeks after the dreaded talk with his friends, Harry was feeling even worse. He could no longer sleep because of the nightmares, he could barely eat, for he was always craving raw meat, and whenever he went flying to clear his head, he didn’t always felt like coming back to his home and to his friends; he felt more like continue in the deep forest, find a mate and build a new life.
“I am, Ron. I am sure.”
“Harry, how are you feeling?” Hermione asked.
“A mate… like Ron?”
” Hermione whispered as she pointed her wand at Harry, who was tiding up his feathers, making him fall asleep “Ron, apparate him to the forest, I will take the nest and meet you there.”
And then, he heard the sound of flying and of landing in front of his nest. It was Draco.
“Yeah, and Dads said I could have ice cream! Dad went to buy a little in Hogsmead a while ago!”
The next day, Harry woke up from his nap and noticed something was off; there was a different smell in the air, one that didn’t belong to an animal or to a plant.
One day, he woke up feeling better than he had for a long time. He didn’t have any nightmares that night, and his head felt clearer than ever. He no longer felt the guilt because of the deaths during the war, nor felt like he could begin crying whenever he thought of Sirius.
“But mate--”

“I, I, I don’t know, I just got startled, and, and then, when I realized what was going on, I had already attacked you, and, and”
, a part of his mind supplied – wanted to court him.
Ron took a deep breath. He didn’t have time to freak out right now. He needed to help Hermione and Harry. “Hey, ‘Mione, there is nothing we can do right now about it… we have to let Harry go…You know how much he was suffering after the end of the war, he felt like he was responsible for their deaths, and after what happened at the Triwizard Tournament, he’s changed, and I can’t say it was for the best.” Ron took another deep breath “We have to help him after everything he went through for us. He is our friend, and… and maybe him relying on his instincts was for the best, maybe it could help him heal… even though we might never really talk properly to him again.”
“Harry… it might be because of your harpy heritage. I read when a harpy goes under a lot of stress and gets traumatized, it might rely more on its basics instincts, you would stop thinking like an ordinary human and would begin thinking more like… an animal…” Hermione said. She feared Harry would lose himself to his harpy heritance, and saying what could happen, and what was probably happening, out loud only terrified her more “Harry, are you okay? After everything we went through, it would be surprising to say you are fine.”
And then, he heard a whisper and began feeling so sleepy he could no longer keep his eyelids open, but he was awake for enough time to her a woman saying something about a forest.
“Ron” Hermione said “I am worried about Harry, he… he is acting weird.”
“Calm down, Ron.” She said, putting down her book, an exasperated sigh leaving her lips “I thought we had more time…”
“Oh My… Ron, I think Malfoy wants to court Harry!” She answered. She couldn’t be more surprised, for that was
-----------------------------------------------
He felt his mate throw an arm around his shoulders. Ever since they found out Harry was pregnant, Draco became even more protective with his mate. It was adorable that he was worried about Harry’s and the hatchling’s safety, but it could be quite annoying sometimes.
“Look, Harry, according to this book-” She showed him the Rare Inheritances that was kept in the Black library “-You will have a mate.”
It was Draco Malfoy.
“So, ‘Mione, what are we gonna do?”
“I…didn’t know….” Hermione said. She had really thought that Harry would be animal-minded forever, so she was almost crying for the revelation of their friend’s coming back to them “So…you are coming back?”
After a while, he felt hungry, so he decided to hunt. He swiftly landed on a branch and waited the juicy delicious rabbit to be too vulnerable to run. And then, when the time was right, he attacked.
“Oh my God, you look like my mom talking.”
----------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
“Oh my God.” Hermione exclaimed “Harry is pregnant!”
Ron and Hermione were stunned when they saw Harry holding a baby harpy. It had been one year since he had laid it, so it was only a matter of time for it to hatch, they knew. But seeing the baby was completely different from imagining it. It was the perfect combination of the harpy couple, with his blond hair and lovely green eyes.
“No buts, Ronnald. Let’s go.”
“No, more like your other half.”
“I see you have arrived well.” Draco greeted them, holding his children’s ice cream “Hello, honey.” He said, kissing Harry. Although they mated when they weren’t in their right minds, they did love each other very much “Here, little ones.” He handed his children their ice cream “Scorpion, you need to keep your feathers tidy. This way they will get tangled.” He warned, tiding up his son’s wings, which were, for some reason, always a mess.
Those were the thoughts passing thought Harry’s head while he quickly approached his friend and, with a few tries, he successfully kicked him out of the room with a scratch.
“With my luck…”
He woke up that day more rested than ever and decided to explore his new home. So he took off flying, his feathers trembling slightly and his heart pounding with excitement.
Two and a half months later, Harry began feeling pain in his lower belly, and he knew it was finally time.
“I wouldn’t expect less.” He smirked.
They sat in an uncomfortable silence for a bit, sipping their tea and reading more about Harry’s new life, about what would happen in case he didn’t find someone to pass the rest of your life with.
-----------------------------------------------------------
“Yeah, but-”
“Ron, ‘Mione, I think I might be going crazy.” Harry said some days after the talk between his two friends. It was lunch time, so they all were sitting at the kitchen table eating chicken and rice, Kreacher nowhere in sight.
----------------------------------
“Oh My God. Is that…?”
“Yes, Ron, I know that’s Malfoy, but have you never thought that the obsession Harry had with him was actually… something else?”
“Mate, are you sure?” Ron asked. He was afraid he would lose his best friend just because he was too stubborn to admit he needed help.
The pain began when the clock showed that it was no longer the day before, but that it was then july 31th, the day Harry Potter was born eighteen years before. The excruciating pain began at the base of his toes, and quickly spread though his whole body. The only way to explain what he was feeling would be that Harry was being lowered in lava.
“He might just be tired, ‘Mione. The war is been over for only two months. He deserves a rest after helping rebuild Hogwarts last month.”
When they reached the ground, Harry tried to scratch the other, but he dodged his hand and scratched his arm. The dark harpy then proceeded to try flying away from the stronger one, which was successful.
His arms were covered in black feathers, soft as silk and dark as the night, and there were sharp claws where used to be his blunt nails. Harry looked down and noticed his legs were also different; his thighs were still human-like, but the rest of the legs were bird-like.
He knew that ignoring what he was feeling and what he was dreaming wasn’t the healthiest way to cope after the war, but he didn’t want to bother some therapist with his feelings and thoughts; there were a lot of people passing through a way worse period, like Teddy, who lost his parents, and the Weasleys, who have lost a member.
Draco turned around, still in his shined oxfords and looked at Harry. There was discomfort in every lean line of his body.
“Oh, shit, sorry—“
Harry shared a look with Draco before turning back to Hermione and taking his hand in the one not holding the wine glass.
If you want to find me, I'm still on tumblr (we-re-always-alright) and the ask box is always open.
“Seems like all the crimes for the federal level are quite intense.”

This…truce they had, lasted roughly three months since the first time they’d gone out for drinks. They’d met up a dozen times between the first day and now and at this point, Draco was reluctant but assured to admit that they were some form of friends. An odd couple for sure, but definitely some form of friends.
“Yeah,” Harry copied his motion and stole a drink from his cup before smiling at him, “They passed with flying colors—I mean so did St. Augustine’s, but it’s come a long way from when we went to school.“
“I don’t know what I did but I’m sorry,” Harry cut him off, the smell of whiskey and pub and cigarette smoke proceeding him, rambling with a manic look, “Honestly, I’m sorry, I don’t know what I can do to make it up to you but I’m sorry and I miss you and I l—”
His mother had been no help, latching onto the secret thought as a niffler did on coin and demanding to know every detail. He was tempted, with a dark streak of humor that matched the slush on the edges of his robes, to tell her exactly who had gone and torn his heart to ribbons, if only to make her stop in fright but the faint warning of her heart stopped him.

supposed to mean?” Harry mocked him, picking at the pain in his heart, just where he knew it would be.
He couldn’t help but admire, in a way, Weasley’s reasoning. There was a lot to unpack, things he should be more concerned about in the words he said, but all of that was overshadowed by some feeling he couldn’t describe. Was it relief? Pride? Something earned? There’s wasn’t time to come up with much better.
If you had told Draco Malfoy from sixth form that at one point, he and golden boy Harry Potter would be supporting an absolutely smashed Ron Weasley up the front stairs of the flat that he shared with his wife, he would have laughed you out of the room, out of the building and possibly out of the country.

I could even hear your voice—“ it was a decent impression of his accent next— “Honestly, you defeated the most powerful wizard and you can’t be bothered to buy a mattress? A table? A
Draco glared at him, knowing full well he wasn’t the cause of his problems. Harry’s eyebrow raised a smidge higher before dropping. He was far too sober to be dealing with this.
“Reasonably weird,” Harry said in response, “I think that’s a fair assessment and a rather good phrase. I think it works well for us.” Draco nodded, heart hammering oddly at the thought that they were
“Far worse indeed.”
Harry shakes his head and so does Draco. It’s surprising when Ron speaks up.
“If you wish.”
“Please, call me Cynthia,” she said with a wider smile, “And we’re honored to help out Harry Potter.” Harry stiffened beside him as he always did with fans, Draco’s hand going to the small of his back to steady him. “Your grandfather and great grandfather were hugely helpful in during the world wars with their support, both in medicine and politically.”
We each have our guns drawn
While he was able to hide his reaction earlier, he couldn’t stop the jolt that went through him, slashing through Sir Phineas’ name, as he felt his heart race. There was no way he could know, but he wasn’t able to stop himself from looking at Blaise in a slight panic. “So it’s a man—obviously someone you’re ashamed of, judging by that reaction,” And Draco couldn’t help but scoff—he was the one despoiling the Chosen One, “Or not, judging by
Harry nodded, proud of his apprentices, “There’s very little variation between the paperwork, so there should be no surprises.” Draco held in his opinions, as there was
“I’ve fully completed my time in prison, I’ve paid the reparations for the families and I now spend my time working to remove dark magic left over from the war from homes and other buildings.” The words felt stale in his mouth and he tried not to shiver. “I no longer hold the views expressed by my family and the group they were associated with and I worked very hard to do so.” Cathleen didn’t narrow her eyes but she could smell blood in the water, honing in on it as finally tuned as a hunter in the woods chasing their query. Loreen had done a fine job finding a formidable opponent for Harry and him.
“Did you really kill that Voldemort bloke?” Rebecca looked up at him.
“Love, focus,” Ron said, rescuing the glass from being knocked over. Hermione blushed.
It felt achingly like
“That’s only because you think pizza supersedes any other food groups,” she told them, “Though it’s charitable to call deep dish a pizza—”
“Like you cared and
“Shh, shh, Rebecca,” and Harry wrapped her in a hug as she started to sob, “I’ve got you... I’m not going anywhere...”
) he’d said yes.
If Harry was the puppet with cut strings and Draco was a ghost, all the air and fight went out of him at that. His heart ached, not at the fighting but because they had caused so much hurt to one another.
“If she wanted to leave, I guess I would try to support her as much as I could,” he said haltingly, “I wouldn’t want to force her…her to stay or be what she wasn’t.” It was words he’d wished he’d heard. Words he only thought of at night, turning past events over and over in his mind like a lodestone, pointing his way into the murky future.
“At least we’ll be on the right time zone.”
Maybe this was what Pansy had told him, that certain people were destined to always orbit around one another. Sometimes colliding, sometimes hovering near and sometimes entering perfect, entrancing, celestial circles around one another. “
John was a tall man, easily as tall as Ronald, with deep brown skin, though not as rich and luminous as Hermione’s, with a shaved head and a single pierced ear. He had kind eyes and a deep voice and he might have been distantly related to someone Harry knew from his time at university, but Draco could never remember who. He joined after Liza did and was considered the most junior member of the team.
“I think that’s the official list,” he finished lamely. John finished his note. Liza finally stopped looking and read over his shoulder and nodded. He didn’t feel lighter for having admitted it. He only knew that it was the constant weight of his crimes, fresh and new and forever his.
“Draco—“
“Mikaela you need to stop!“ But she didn’t and Draco couldn’t close his eyes but finally had pressed Lacey into his shoulder, her screams turning to howls of distress, as the mirrors cracked Mikaela Stone’s bones, starting with her skull, chest and hips, and compressed her to death in the span of five seconds. He couldn’t hold Lacey tight and away from seeing the scene and cover her ears at the same time, so they both had to listen to her lungs, eyes, pop, the bones crunch and grind against one another and the wheezes come to a halting end. There wasn’t anything he could do but watch, she deserved at least that much, to know she wasn’t alone.

So it was self preservation when Draco started pulling back. He’d had his moment to bask in the sun that was Harry Potter, with his smiles and his sincerity and his honest care for those around him. Harry would be
“Why— why would you say that? You love Rebecca as much as I do—” He could feel the carefully constructed view that Harry had fall apart before him, watching the blocks tumble out of place.
“Whatever you get determines what you study in university.”
Weasley let out another surprised laugh as Harry wheezed next to him, nearly choking on his fast laughter as he stood up, “You’re ridiculous, not all of us are interior design experts,” then he bobbed his head in the usual fashion, said “Loo,” by way of explanation before walking off in a long legged lope that was familiar.

It was also bigger than the previous place, with a kitchen attached to the dining room, then a small drawing room and a nice snug or den they were going to convert into an office for the pair of them. It had nicely built in bookshelves that would be perfect for their books and their files.
“Correct,” he answered, making sure they all got into the dim and grey alley off from the side road, where really there were only rats and cigarette butts to see them.
“Oh don’t be,” she said, an impish smile growing, her faint Irish accent lilting over the sounds of chatter and laughter around them, “I only make exceptions for those who keep me locked in their mansions.”
“Must mean the scene has been cleared.” He brushed a few locks of hair from the girl’s face. “She woken up yet?”

muggles and muggleborn families. Shacklebolt stood the government back up, putting into place a temporary, emergency wizegamont led by himself, the interim minister, built in part by the members that were proven not to be part of the insurrection and some select international members of the various other governments, to serve as further impartial judges. And when it was all in place, the trials had begun. Hours and hours of testimony, all splashed over the front pages of the Prophet day after day, spanning the course of six months. And no person or business once indicted was spared from the scrupulous gaze of what they now call and will call once it passed into the history books the 1998 Ministry Involvement Trials. Even the Prophet wrote of its own propaganda schemes and its own culpability in spreading misinformation and lies to create fear and panic, though with a slightly more subdued tone. They were extremely effective, both in public support and in rooting out many long-standing powerful families.
Narcissa’s hair was more gray, streaking and aging beautifully, and her eyes had a few more wrinkles when she offered a rare smile, but for the most part she was unchanged. She still dressed the same, wore the same bergamot perfume from Italy, hugged him just as tightly when he left as if he were going to disappear once out of her sight. Every time it felt like the first time they’d left to take him to Hogwarts. They’d waited in the foyer for Father before heading to the station, his mother asking him if the house elves had packed this, or if he was planning on doing that when he arrived and he remembered being very cross to hide how terrified he was to be leaving.
“Those are… very serious crimes,” she said, “And how could we assume a child such as Rebecca would be safe in your care based on these crimes?”

“So do you both live in Chicago?” Draco asked as they set a far more relaxed pace to the restaurant.

“I’m sorry, who are you?”
just think: you’re the head of the auror department and your top, shiny bauble decides to quit one day. You would do anything to keep him. He brings you this zany idea and he’ll be technically on your payroll but doing his own thing, with very little impact, very little press and a lot of paperwork and all he wants is an office and the authority to do it. It’s a no brainer and it keeps the higher ups off your back about budget (look any time Harry was on a case you better bet they had to bring additional aurors to the scene to handle the press, before the Prophet takeover) and personnel and everyone wins.
“Welcome, Mr. Malfoy,” she stated, her accent thick and her tone even, “I’m Cathleen Walsh with the Department of Child and Family Home Services in the Irish Ministry.”
“You were only doing what you thought was right—“
“How long?”
, whatever that was. When he was like that, all Draco could compare him to, now with hindsight, a breeder of fine dogs, purposefully picking and punishing in kind, because he saw everyone as beneath him and not just muggleborns. And the strongest part of his emotions, the ones that held most sway, were a combination of sorrow of the rare happy moments that were now only memories and the larger sadness that he could no longer look to him and feel anything for fear of speaking ill of the dead.
“Right, okay, so the United States has always had a bit of an odd system and it goes all the way back to the founding of America. Several groups of witches and wizards, facing persecution for their non-violent beliefs came to America, thus founding their own small local schools. This, unfortunately, led to the Salem witch trials for some muggles, who were blamed but it helped lead to founding the start of the magical government in the US.” Draco wondered if this was what it was like in school, Hermione figuring the nefarious plots so then they could then thwart them. If she had to pull the other two along with her prodigious brain. Harry, bless him, was brilliant but not the one for combing through texts for solutions, never mind Ron’s short attention span.

“I can’t believe it,” he slumped in his chair, “Bloody Saint Potter, here to help the children, savior of the wizarding world.” Harry laughed, his shoulders shaking with mirth. Draco even cracked an honest smile. The music played on.
“I should hope so,” he added dryly. Harry laughed, somehow able to find the light in all of this easily.
as the sun rises is truly poetic cinematography.
“Poncy!” Draco rolled his eyes, “Why I haven’t heard that in ages Potter.”
Draco shrugs. He enjoys the parts of his job where he spends hours manipulating and maneuvering the magic to do what he needs. It’s hard work but very rewarding when everything goes right. He doesn’t like working with aurors or his coworkers, who still look at him with fear and distrust. A lot of the people at the firm were on the outside of the Death Eaters, or just come from longstanding pure blood families with experience in this sort of hereditary magic, but until Draco joined, Blaise was the one who was deepest into the group, which was to say not very deep. Even though the skin is numb, dead from the magic leaving it, his dark mark stings like a phantom limb and he itches it subconsciously.
Anyway, that was how they ended up in the one corner shop in all of Muggle London that seemed to have broken down.

“Well Mr. Malfoy,” Cathleen says after a short pause where they confer notes, Draco trying not to think of what adjectives they’re using for him, “I must say this has been one of the most… interesting interviews I’ve worked on.”
work; that’s the problem,” Draco huffed. “Some of the library assistants called in sick, so my boss wants me to read to a group of infants, and then stay late to run the bloody craft club for a bunch of 11-year-old girls.”
He pressed the phone to his ear and waited as it rang, tapping his foot impatiently. On the third ring, he heard a deep, sleepy voice. “Miss me already?”
“I’m sure you’re very capable, Scorpius,” Draco sighed, scratching at his scalp as he attempted to formulate a legitimate reason – maybe even a decent excuse – to keep his son from attending this party. “I just worry, and it’s because I love you.”
“Oh, you brought something to share?” Harry asked, taking the wooden bowl from Draco and peering through the cellophane. “Brilliant, I’ll just pop it in the fridge for now so it’ll keep.” A lanky ginger man, undoubtedly a Weasley, took over at the barbecue, and Draco found himself following Potter into the house.
Draco rolled his eyes and huffed out a sigh. “Do you

to have been her, because he couldn’t recall anything else out of the ordinary happening earlier in the week.
“Well, shit,” Draco murmured, setting the party invitation down to free up his hands. He pressed his fingers into his temples and rubbed them in small, circular motions, as if it might change the reality that his son hated his guts at the moment. This whole situation was making him feel so useless as a parent that he was seriously considering giving his mother a call to ask for advice. When it came to dramatic outbursts and the Malfoy family, it was clear that the apple didn’t fall far from the tree.
“Thank you,” Harry said, grinning broadly. “Hermione tells me that often.”
“Right. So this is like a delicate baby bird egg, Malfoy,” Harry said, deadly serious. “If you drop it, you’ll have murdered an innocent creature before it even had the chance to fly.” Draco caught the pink balloon in both hands, cupping it as if his hands were a nest.
“I…I’m sorry, I think I must have missed something,” Draco apologized, his brows drawing together in confusion. “Having a laugh over…your divorce?”
“I mean…I don’t actually have a job, so yeah, I honestly don’t have anything better to do,” Harry said, followed by a long, exaggerated yawn. Draco could hear the smile in Potter’s voice, could imagine him sitting up in bed — in Draco’s bed — bleary-eyed without his glasses on, hair sticking up in all directions. “I thought you left for work?”
“Thanks,” Harry smiled appreciatively. “We have this place, and then a flat in town where Gin and I take turns staying while the other is here with the kids. We thought it would be best to give them a stable home environment instead of making them go back and forth. In the divorce,” he added, seeing the blank look on Draco’s face.

“Astoria’s made mention of it once or twice,” Harry admitted with a shake of his head. “You might not want it to change the way people see you, but she doesn’t mind a bit that her name is attached to your good deeds.”
* * * * *
“Never knew librarians had such risky jobs,” Harry said, keeping a straight face.
“I wish all separations could be so amicable,” Draco mused. “How have your children been managing?”
“What did I say about flirting with peoples’ dads?” Scorpius demanded, setting his hands on his hips. Albus stood beside a sopping wet Harry, clutching a now-empty bucket. “This is a kids party, Papa. If you want to make goo-goo eyes at someone, do it another day!” Draco stared at his son, unsure of what one was supposed to say in this situation.
Scorpius had been attending regular physical therapy sessions for years, which helped to strengthen the muscles in his right arm and hand, as well as make him able to hold and utilize objects such as a pencil or a fork. On good days, he felt confident that he could take part in school activities with barely any adaptation. On bad days, when the muscle tone in his arm and hand was too loose, he relied on his other hand to complete tasks. If his muscles were too tight, he often found himself in pain, which could be relieved somewhat by having someone massage or apply a heating pad to the offending muscles.
“Probably not.”
For the next water activity, Hermione had tasked her twin brothers-in-law with setting up a slip-n-slide. She regretted this immediately, because instead of laying the tarp out where she had suggested, the twins brought a tarp that spanned a majority of the garden, and ended in the pool. Because the yard was graded higher on the edges of the property, when the kids would run down the water and dish-soap slicked tarp, they were propelled at high speed downhill, where they fell into the Potters pool in a bubbly mess. Ginny had realized her brothers’ error (well-thought out prank) when she realized that her pool was starting to resemble a bubble bath, but by that point it was too late to do anything about it.
“I don’t even know what to say to that,” Harry said earnestly. “I can tell you’re panicking, so just go back to your office, do a bit of whatever it is you do in there, and I’ll see you at half one, okay?”
“Oh, they’re doing great,” Harry said, very sure of his answer. “They were very understanding when we explained the situation, and we were able to have a bit of a laugh about it all in the end.”
Pulling out the mobile phone he’d purchased to facilitate communication within the Muggle world, Draco scrolled through the few contacts he had in search of the person that might be his saviour. He didn’t have many friends, Muggle or magical, so the list was short. Before pressing ‘call', he thought it through once more. Was it really worth it to ask?
“If we give you a hand, ladies, I’m sure we can have this bucket filled in no time,” Harry suggested. Ginny passed him a full bag of balloons and a faucet adapter to share with Draco, and suggested they use the kitchen sink instead of fighting them for the garden spigot.
“Making for you, yes,” Harry said.
“Try not to get too distracted, boys,” Hermione called after them in a singsong voice. “There’ll be time enough to flirt to your hearts’ content after the party.” Both men hurried across the garden and into the house to avoid any further comments on their lack of subtlety from observant women and children.
weird. That’s all I’m asking.”
“Yes, yes, whatever,” Draco muttered, turning away so that Harry wouldn’t see him blush. “Shall I show you to the children’s area, then?”
Harry hadn’t withdrawn his hand from Draco’s forearm yet, and the warmth of his fingers against Draco’s tattooed skin sent a delightful tingling sensation rippling through the nerves in Malfoy’s arm. They glanced up in tandem and both leaned in a fraction of an inch, moving as though one were a reflection of the other. Harry’s eyes flickered down to Draco’s lips, made soft and pink by a run of his tongue along them. They watched each other, frozen in time, as though they weren’t standing in the middle of Potter’s bustling yard at a pool party they had been tasked with supervising.
Draco ignored him.
swim, Papa,” Scorpius seethed, vehemently sure of his abilities, “So quit worrying. I’m 12 years old – I’m not going to die if I go to a party!” The boy pushed his chair back from the table and took off towards his bedroom, resolutely slamming the door behind him.
as well, Ginevra. I’ll wash them when we get home tonight and have them back to you tomorrow.”
“Sure thing, Gin,” Harry replied, gesturing towards the door with his head as he stood up, encouraging Malfoy to follow him out into the back garden.
As he made his way up a smoothly paved sidewalk, Draco saw that the gate to the left of the house was wide open, providing access to the back garden. Knocking on the front door would be useless if no one was actually in the house. He took a deep breath to calm his nerves, and then strode confidently towards the sounds of shrieking children and splashing water.
While lying in bed the night prior, Draco had been thinking about how the last kiss they had shared before Harry dozed off would be their last kiss ever. He couldn’t imagine Harry wanting anything substantial, so he had declared it a one-time event to prevent himself getting his hopes up and then having his heart crushed to bits when things inevitably fizzled out.
“You want me to
“Oh, Ginny and I are both gay,” Harry explained with an amused snort. “I think we both had our suspicions early in our marriage, but we didn’t really talk about it until a few years back. She’s dating a teammate from her footie club now. It’s been all over the tabloids; I’m surprised you haven’t heard about it.”
“Hmm,” Draco responded, furrowing his brow as he read over the details of the party. “And who’s hosting this party again? Do I know their parents?”
“No, Papa, I don’t
Draco asked, pausing partway through removing his jacket to glare at his boss. “Maria, have you met me? I’m terrible with children; can’t even remember the last time I spoke to one.”
but that was half the fun of it.
And he was, truly. Scorpius had been young, but Draco and Astoria’s split had still been difficult for the boy. Potter’s children were all in school now, and would remember what it was like when their parents were together. That would make for an even more challenging dynamic, Draco imagined.
“For dinner and drinks, which you will be…”
chat, gents,” she teased, “But would either or both of you be able to come out and supervise the swimmers? I forgot to pick up that ice cream cake I ordered for the party, so I have to make a quick run into town.”
That was probably the subtlest way Draco could have renounced his father’s snobbish, capitalist (and frankly classist) views on what made a person’s life valuable, but Harry picked up on it.
