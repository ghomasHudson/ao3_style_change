Indeed, the brunette was wearing a blue shimmering top leaving her navel free, combined with a pink tutu and very bright very orange tights. She had even gone a step further and added a red belt which somehow managed to pull the outfit together. Her hair was curled at the ends to make it resemble snakes- with a lot of fantasy of course.
And not because he could not come up with any reason. In fact, it were too many so he did not know where to start. Maybe because the other man was very real, maybe because he was funny, maybe because he had grown so much as a person or his tendencies to fight his battles on his own without relying on anyone else. Maybe it was because he cared for his friends, maybe it was the save space he offered Harry, the open ear, his secret world. Or maybe it was because he was smoking hot and confident in his body – something Harry still had to learn. Maybe it was his whole attitude, his charm and self-confidence or the fact that he did not put Harry on any pedestal and put him above all other living beings but saw him as equal. Maybe it was because he exactly knew which buttons to push, where to touch him, to make him willing to do anything within mere seconds – but we are skipping ahead again.
He had to clench his jaws together in order not to scream out loudly. How could they dare to write such bullshit! Draco was absolutely right, this article was a direct attack on his reputation, taking away all the credit he had earned for his hard work so far. He did not deserve that! And all of it was Harry’s fault.
She gave away a deep sigh. Lowered her finger as well as her shoulders in defeat. Her left eyebrow was still twitching when she turned on her heel and stomped away, mumbling more towards herself than him: “Fine, but I will go with him – just in case!”
He almost did not manage to find words at all, he was to preoccupied with the hands still touching his, fingers caressing the sensitive skin. Then Draco leant in closer, their heads only a few inches apart.
This question lead to Draco’s hand stop caressing Harry’s chest and instead reach into the pink hair, brushing it back while the still blushed face showed an expression of both guilt and embarrassment. The taller man shrugged his shoulders a bit, now really looking as if he had to confess something. Harry took a step back, raising one eyebrow.
Ginny somehow always knew how to handle publicity. She was so much better at it than him. She knew when to appear at an event, what to say, when to pose, touch, kiss, leave. It was her who carefully managed the bits and pieces of information they gave to the press. She announced them dating so it was her duty to inform the press about their break up.
On the one side of the card, Malfoy had carefully written down the address of the pub, including a date and time, the other side contained his business information.
“So, you thought that the old queen Draco had nothing else to do than teach you how to be a proper poof?”, he asked, the familiar snarl in his voice. But it was accompanied by something else. If you listened carefully, you could notice a soft undertone in the voice, something playful and almost caring. Harry however had never been quite sensitive to undertones and this is why no one at this point should be surprised by him not getting the hint that Malfoy was indeed just joking.
He loves how perfectly their faces fit together. Like they were made for cosy whispered conversations, feeling each other’s breath tingle on your own skin and he wonders how he managed to live one day on this earth without being able to whisper things to Draco.
Later, Harry explained to himself that it was the fact he got such a compliment from another man – a very fashionable one – that made his heart skip a bit. It had nothing to do with the fact that it came from a very pink haired man with very grey eyes and a very nice smile.
The cute thing about being five years old is that you can fall utterly in love with the concept of somebody you have never actually met. For him Astoria was this perfect girl with long wavy hair and all those colourful clothes who always smiled and would be the perfect playdate for a rainy afternoon at home. He had even told Harry he would share his secret cookie stash with Astoria if she wanted to swing by. Of course, not the chocolate ones but she could have the oatmeal cookies if she wanted too. Even innocent love has its borders and for Teddy Lupin those were sharing anything chocolate!
The former Slytherin was just about to start telling the as he called it ‘dramatic story of how Blaise Zabini conquered and broke my tiny precious heart for the first time’ when a glimpse at the clock behind him made him stop talking and frowning for a moment.
Don't get me wrong. During their time together Harry never felt unhappy. Being with Ginny was easy. Spending time with her, kissing her, exploring their bodies together. It just felt logical. Reasonable.
It only took until the early afternoon until the more than flattering letter from the lady of the house arrived. Now Draco would definitely get the job and they could maybe hang out around the office as well. Maybe he would notice there that Harry really cared for him. Our favourite Gryffindor was just about to text the other man about his accomplishment when it arrived.
When she had entered the apartment, Astoria was immediately running towards her, babbling and hugging her while she was still getting the buttons of her jacket undone. Draco had been a bit more reserved at first but given her a big smile when she kissed him on the cheek, not staining his skin with her lipstick. And then it had been Harry’s turn. It should have felt awkward to meet someone whom you barely knew at their homecoming party but somehow it did not. She had looked at him for a second and seemed to be puzzled but then had decided to kiss him on the cheek as well and ask if the delicious smelling food was thanks to him as for sure the other two maniacs had never been capable of preparing a dish that needed more skill than opening a can or boiling noodles. After making sure that she and her “guest” were served drinks, she invited Harry to the table and they had a rather wholesome dinner together where she talked about her travel through Europe. Again, there had been moments, Harry was wondering how exactly he had ended up here but he enjoyed the company of those three way to much to really give a second thought. Which was basically how he had ended up here, in front of the most popular LGTB+ club in Soho at the moment, waiting to go on his first “super gay fun time adventure” as Astoria had called it.
“Have you decided to be our very own maiden for free or why are you trying to burn down my perfectly fine kitchen?”, he asked with a short wink. His voice sounded way too pleased with himself and arrogant for the other man’s taste. Harry furled his eyebrows in a mixture of anger and surprise. Hadn’t Astoria told Draco she had asked for help?
“But I don’t ask you to. Can’t we for one moment stop thinking about what will happen in the future and live now? I mean there is something between you and me!”
“I have been there. I cannot do this again. Even I am not willing to be the one in the shadows anymore.”
With surprise he noticed Draco already sitting at a table all by himself without any menu, looking around with a rather critical expression on his face which luckily lit up the second he saw Harry.
It was as if the flat was trying to slide any enchantment off of him. Was this what Astoria had meant by leaving glamours outside? He began to wonder if she was wearing any. Stepping around the corner he found himself in a very large room with bright white walls. It featured an elegant and modern dining table with four chairs as well as a couch and to his big surprise a telly. To be specific a brand-new flat screen which had been placed on a small sideboard. While the room itself was very bright, featuring huge window fronts to two sides, the furniture was held in dark earthy tones. Here and there a tiny bit of decoration was added such as a small plant on the coffee table or a few photographs on the wall behind the telly.
He was positive, Draco, son of a high-ranking Death Eater was most certainly not allowed to visit his uncle Sirius to meet the Order of the Phoenix.
After returning to Hogwarts for his eighth year he had considered staying there even after the reparations on the castle had been done and become a professor or help Hagrid with the caretaking. It had urged him for quite a while to stay where he had felt home for the first time. But somehow his initial decision of becoming a permanent resident at Hogwarts did not make him as happy as he thought it would.
Draco looked him straight in the eyes with what could only be described as a smug smile and leaned a bit towards him. Even though they were still a few feet apart Harry could feel the heat rushing into his cheeks. He suddenly realized that the other man was quite a few centimetres taller than himself, looking down at him with a lot more confidence than Harry had ever owned himself. He looked so poised and at peace with himself.
With a shake of his head he returned back to reality but not without having to think about Hermione. If he later told her about his thoughts, she would definitely smile at him knowingly and say something like “I think you have your answer”. And maybe she would be right. Maybe it was as simple as that. He wanted Draco. Not purely physically (which he did as well, there was no need to even question that, believe me) but also emotionally. He wanted intimate conversations, playful flirting, lazy days, busy days. Harry sighted without a sound. Of all people – men to be more precise – he wanted to be with this one more than he ever wanted anyone else. If only he knew how Draco felt.
“Alright, I think we are good to go”, Draco explains while winking at Harry who again is staring at his boyfriend. Most of the time his partner tries to present himself in a very masculine way as if he had to prove he was still a man even though he was gay. Seeing him with the pink and feminine glasses on was something different. Not that they did not suit him but at this point in their relationship Harry was almost absolutely sure there was nothing Draco could not make work.
“You look different …,” the dark-haired mess with words commented on the obvious. Harry had never been great at expressing himself but that was a low, even for him. Draco still reacted, brushing back some loose hair behind the left ear. With that he exposed the earrings. It were in fact four tiny silver rings and a larger black tunnel. With a bit of surprise, Harry noticed he could actually look through the hole. “…but not in like a bad way”, he desperately tried to finish his sentence on a more positive and not so darn obvious note.
For someone who had never been utterly and absolutely in love with another person and slowly came to realize, their feelings were mutual, it would be incomprehensible how happy Harry felt right then. He stared at the screen of his phone until it turned back only to reread their conversation over and over, forming the best parts with his lips.
“Oh, has Draco been annoying you with his work stories, Harry?”, she asked, now ignoring Malfoy completely herself. “He can be such an attention seeker from time to time, completely unlike his roommate.”, she jokingly explained to our favourite Gryffindor. The way she kept talking and how easy it was for her to force Malfoy into complete silence impressed Harry and he instantly decided, that he could become friends with this loud girl.
Harry knew he did not have to work. He knew people did not expect him to do anything else than rest on his fame and fortune, show his face to the press from time to time and pretend to be the grad Saviour of the Wizarding World. He had never felt like that was enough.
He ended up buying way too much (maybe because he had taken Teddy alongside) and did not know how to proceed from there. Should he send a giant basket with all the nippit in it or was sending daily tiny things better? Was this whole present-thing a sarcastic joke from Draco he didn’t get? This whole flirting thing was way too confusing for his brain. With Ginny he just simply bought what she wished for and gave it to her. Most of the time she even got him directions to where to buy what exactly. Anyhow, his feelings for Ginny had been very different, he had realized by now.
“I hope you like it, it is one of Daphne’s favourites, so you will be having quite a lot of them tonight when we go out,” Draco added after a moment as if this information was nothing. Harry stared at him blankly, needing a few seconds to process. Was that supposed to be an invitation?
He knew nothing about himself but that he was rather good at defeating evil wizards. That and Ron constantly nagging him about it led to the decision of becoming an Auror.
Harry could feel the heat raising in his cheeks. Somehow, he loved the idea of him and Draco being a strong power couple out there for the world and having a secret together at home. He liked the idea of spending lazy days with the other man as well as his company would make official dates bearable or even enjoyable. He liked the idea of having more than a friendship with Draco. By Merlin, he could almost hear his snarking comments to the press, the slightly arrogant but witty comments as well as he could feel his hand in his hair, strong fingers touching, him gripping him…
“Harry Dear, can you give me your phone number in case Draco misses another rendezvous? You know, just in case we have to start a nationwide search once again,” she explained while attempting to keep a straight face. Without even waiting for his answer, she stuffed her phone into his hands and let him no other choice than add his number to her contacts. The phone lay heavy in his hands. It was one of the brand-new ones, no less than 2 months old Harry would assume. Had he only been given the phone and the task to spot the owner of it in the room without any further piece of information, he would have still known it belonged to Astoria, he thought. The case was pitch black and featured all kinds of cute but creepy animals on them. It was on the very verge of still being stylish and not considered corny, but somehow it fit her.
Harry chuckled and ruffled through his godson’s hear one again. They were still purple and he suddenly had to think about Draco. How interesting that both had decided to go with a colour on the red spectrum. He only knew about spectrums and stuff because Astoria had told him, being quite a fashion critic herself. Maybe it was reasonable Teddy had chosen a similar colour as he and Draco were related. Harry wondered if those two would get along and if Draco was also so disgusted by the thought of kissing girls.
Oh and did I already mention he announced himself as "Draco Malfoy, last of his name, not willing to pretend he was ever going to date a witch, well-educated wizards of old families with the financial means to fulfil his every wishes as well as stunning looks welcome owl him"?
He tried to find the business card Draco had handed him when they had met for the first time. That seemed to have happened such a long time ago. So much had changed first. He finally found it, two rubber band wrapped around it and a paperclip holding it in place. He had decided to keep it after their meeting, just in case.
They often went to take out places and had their dinner at the apartment but sometimes Astoria more felt like “fancy food” as she declared and they went to a muggle restaurant in walkable distance. As their place was located in Soho, they had plenty of choice. And they always seemed searching for just the next weird dish to try. Astoria had been joking about that quite some times, referring to Draco as “easily bored, always looking for the next adventure” which had led to the pink-haired not talking to her for the rest o the evening and Harry wondering if that was true for his sexual partners as well.
“Well then, you should take him out shopping, Mr. Super-Stylish-Extravaganza! See how you can save that!”
”If I tell you, he swings the other way round, he does, even though me might not have realized it himself!”, Draco explained to Harry very excitedly. They were once again meeting at “their” bar, coffeeshop or however you would like to call it. Harry himself wasn’t sure about that either. The products sold there ranged from drinks to food and even shirts so a definite decision about the actual purpose of the store was hard to make. However, there was one thing he was sure about: It was a trendy place!
“I see no difference to what you did. You basically decided he was not to meet the rest od his family. You did not let him choose either!”
“You can’t be serious! It is so pretentious to insist on such an outdated opinion on a matter of this political scale,” Hermione was repeating herself once again, disbelieve in her eyes. Draco, sitting opposite of her leaned forward, his elbows on his knees and stared at her, ready to start the argument all over again.
Somehow they all had assumed that with the last long hug this was the end of their little ritual and already had started to move towards the Christmas tree to exchange gifts when Arthur stopped them with his glass once again filled and explaining that he had one more person to be thankful for today.
This was the moment Draco forced himself to look up again and give Harry a smile so soft and sad his heart almost immediately broke.
“Oh, Harry Potter! It has been ages since I last saw you!”, she exclaimed enthusiastically while grabbing an empty chair behind her. Sitting down, she held out her right hand in order to introduce herself to him.
She smiled at him softly but he could sense how pleased she was with herself by the way her eyes had started to glitter. This witch somehow always seemed to be able to look right through him. Once again, she took him by surprise with one single, innocent question: “Draco, hm?”
Since his coming out, the world did not change for Draco Malfoy. He was still the same, dressed the same, had the same job and friends. He just simply dated man. And that was exactly what Harry wanted for himself. Enough things had chance in his young life. He had lost what he would call a family not only once. He had been special long enough. If Ginny was in fact right and he was gay, he didn't want it to be special. He wanted to be normal. And as strange as this might sound, Draco Malfoy managed to stay normal.
The next picture was taken from above and showed Draco raising one eyebrow and half-smiling into the camera, showing of his whole body from top to bottom, the free hand pulling down the towel a bit further. What followed was another text-message.
“Well, the child already fell into the pound. Let’s see what Hermione could accomplish and talk about how mad your boyfriend is,” Ron continued jokingly. Harry felt the heat rising in his cheeks. He had expected a lot of reactions from his best friend if he would have ever outed himself and admitted he was in love with Draco Malfoy but mischievousness was none of them.
About an hour into the drive Draco decides it is his turn and they completely switch places. Harry is in the passenger seat now. Somehow Draco insisted and from time to time our favourite Gryffindor feels the soft touch of a hand on his upper thigh. He likes is quite much when Draco is in the mood for such gestures. Most of the time it happens when he thinks nobody can see him. Not because he is ashamed of their relationship, he has reassured Harry a thousand times. It is rather because he was raised to not show his emotions in public.
Draco let out a deep sight somewhere in the middle of the movie. Merlin knows what it was about, Harry was way to busy asking himself how to improve the situation as to follow the shallow plot. What he definitely noticed was the moment Draco quietly drew out his phone and started texting. This was not going well at all and he had no clue what to do!
He ended up launching himself on one of the gigantic couches in the living room, expecting to be on his own for while as the other Weasleys all seemed to be busy with their annual Christmas chores. Again, he was wrong. Charlie seemed to have only been waiting for his chance. He appeared out of nowhere and seated himself on the chair opposite of Harry, looking at him with a sincere expression.
“You can have your own, if you don’t feel like sharing”, Harry offered, hoping to have hit the nail on the head. His counterpart could not stop his own mouth from twitching towards the bottom left corner of his face, obviously trying to hide the disgust in his expression before shaking his head.
To make a point, the pink haired grabbed Harry’s waist and pulled him close enough so he could smell the scent of herbs and something sweet once again. Draco’s smell. Until that very moment Harry had not noticed how much he had missed this distinctive little feature, how he desperately had to get more of this smell, of how the perfume fused with the other man’s very own smell into a fragrance that went from his nose straight to his groin. Unconsciously he had been moving closer, almost nuzzling his head into Draco’s neck. This made the latter turn his head and look at him.
Harry can tell by the look in his boyfriend’s eyes that he is absolutely sure Harry does not know what Ostara is and therefore has once again a chance to share his wide Wizard traditions knowledge. Draco loves to brag with the endless collection of useless facts he has collected over the years. Also, he very well has learnt that Harry quite enjoys it when he is giving him little lectures. Mainly because all of them are whispered softly into ears, heads sticking so close together everyone outside is sure, they are sharing a secret.
“It’s Draco,” he simply told her, not letting go of her hand. He felt the twitch, the short moment of struggling when the weight of this information reached her brain. He saw so many thoughts running through her head; anger, disbelieve, sadness, wonder, fear, understanding but in the end, it was a soft expression that settled.
“Well, I got here by apparating, if you wanted to know that specific thing. I also was surprised I came first and that you did not consider picking me up and maybe walking here together. Anything else you want to know about my rather boring arrival and way here?”
Therefore, it was quite a shock when he publicly announced a press conference in which he wanted to finally state his reasons behind the breakup with his former girlfriend and “put an end to the rumours concerning my sexuality” as he had written to all the large papers. That was Hermione’s wording by the way.
“Also hitch up those sleeves, it would be a shame not to show of those beautiful pictures on your arms,” Molly explained with a very distinct but motherly tone in her voice. Draco returned the smile and rolled up the sleeves of his button down as well as the matching dark blue pullover he was wearing instead of his own.
Over their presumable second or third cup of Weasley Punch they had settled on a topic and were eagerly fighting over it for half an hour by now.
The first time they do a road trip together is at the beginning of spring after the first warm days. Astoria has eagerly been waiting for the sun to come out behind the clouds of the London sky and as soon as the temperature has risen above 12 degree, she seems to spend every waking hour in the sun.  Harry particularly enjoys this because it means they often hang out in in his garden now, drinking sparkly things and enjoying life.
If Astoria Greengrass is famous for one thing then it is her more than impressive ability to be just in time. Exactly 15 minutes later there was a knock on the front door.
In the first place he had not even intended on asking Draco to accompany him. This between them was brand new and it would have felt strange to force his boyfriend into spending Christmas with his family when the term “boyfriend” still felt kind of weird whenever he thought about it. Weird, but in a good way, like a new sensation, similar to the nervous tingle he still got whenever he was kissing Draco or when they were making out. There was something oddly pleasing about knowing he was allowed to call the other man something he had never been before. Draco Malfoy was not only his first boyfriend; this was also true the other way around. Something which made Harry grin like a mad man whenever he thought about it.
He jumped up as he heard the floo go off, automatically grabbing his wand before trying to look casual as Tonks stepped through the fireplace and he realised how stupid he was being; of course no one dangerous would have been able to floo in. Tonks looked at him with a little too much understanding as he flopped back onto the sofa and he scowled at her, “What do you want?” He asked rudely.
“Maybe he has a point.” Draco muttered, holding his hands up in mock surrender as Harry scowled at him, “If someone’s threatening you…”
“Fine. Better.” Harry said, feeling Draco’s hand slip into his own and squeeze it gently, “Did you speak to Mrs Weasley?”
The man looked up then and Sirius noticed just how broken he looked, “I uh… I flooed in and he was just on the floor screaming.” Malfoy said, his voice low, “I tried to get it off him but it was stuck, so I flooed the hospital.” His hand twitched towards Harry, and Sirius saw thin dressings on all his fingers.
Harry held back a laugh at how impatient his friend was and nodded in response to her question, “Yeah, surprisingly okay actually. Everyone behaved.” He said, looking around to make sure that nobody was listening, “I think Sirius might actually be coming around, for real this time.”
Draco drew back from the kiss, panting softly and almost laughing at the way the man's mouth tried to chase his own; he ducked his head and nuzzled into Potter's neck, sucking at the skin there as an apology, making the man moan and buck against him, rubbing their clothed dicks together and sending shots of pleasure through Draco. Potter took a small step back, putting just enough distance between them to let him slide his hand around to the front of Draco's pants and hold his dick. Potter only stroked him a couple of times before he suddenly let go and withdrew his hand making Draco tense, wondering if this was where the man came to his senses and left. But then… but then Potter was dropping to his knees, looking up at Draco through hooded eyes and reaching out a finger to stroke along his dick through the pyjamas, "Can I?" He asked quietly, "Please."
Sirius crept into his own room, shucking his clothes as quietly as possible and sliding in between the bedsheets, curling up against Remus who wrapped an arm around him and pulled him closer. “You ‘kay?” He was barely awake as he spoke but his lips still found Sirius’ shoulder, pressing a soft kiss to the bare skin.
I’m really sorry for the wait, this past year has been pretty rough and I lost my motivation for a while. But I’m back; thanks for all the kudos and comments and for sticking around.
“I can understand that.” Sirius said, and he honestly did but that didn’t lessen the irritation he had been feeling since he had entered the flat.
“I trust him.” Draco murmured, “I… He means a lot to me.” The flush across his cheeks was back now and he was looking ahead, past Sirius, refusing to meet his eyes.
“Yeah, I figured. And I really don’t think it’s that. Harry uh… he had a note in his pocket, another one of the ones he was sent at the start of the summer. We’re tracing it as best we can but so far all we know is that a postal owl delivered it on tuesday morning.”
Harry and Sirius were always hugging and play fighting but Remus was a lot less tactile and so they didn’t hug often, not like this anyway, yesterday had probably been the first time since Harry was cursed, and it felt nice; like coming home. “I’ll be more careful, I promise.” Harry said quietly, knowing it was what Remus needed to hear.
“I need to go to Flourish and Blotts.” Harry said, humouring his friend and getting Hermione’s attention at the name of the book shop, “Remus recommended a couple of books and there’s one I have to get for work.” He pulled a face and Neville frowned slightly.
Hermione rolled her eyes, “Only for the year. Then you’ll be really teaching. I’m so happy for you!”
Harry lay in the hospital bed, his eyes closed and it took a heart stopping second for Sirius to register that the man’s chest was moving. “Oh thank god.” He hadn’t even realised he had spoken until a healer appeared at his side.
“Harry!” Ron called out as he spotted him and Harry gave a weak smile, walking over and sliding into the booth beside Draco. “That bad huh?” Ron asked as Harry stole his glass and drained the last of the beer.
“No-one’s saying you have to hide.” Draco said in response to Harry’s comment, choosing to ignore Zabini’s. “Just be careful, and stay sober enough to protect yourself.” He added, looking for all the world like the self righteous little prince he had been at school.
The healer touched his arm gently, “The cruciatus can do that sometimes, the nerve pain can make your muscles spasm so they end up aching later on. It will pass soon but I’ll grab a pain relief for now.” She said, going over to the small cupboard on the far wall and fetching  a vial of potion, she waited until he had swallowed it before continuing. “From what the aurors said it was a quill that was cursed but I don’t know much else I’m afraid. Your godfather might.” She indicated and Harry followed her gaze, finding Sirius fast asleep in the chair by his bed, a blanket carefully placed over him, “He wouldn't leave you.”
“Are you staying for a bit?” Remus asked him as Harry gathered the empty tea mugs off the table and put them in the sink.
The pain was instant and burning, spreading through his body and causing him to drop to the floor with the intensity of it as he called out, opening his palm automatically to drop whatever it was that had caused it. He barely registered that it hadn't worked, the pain consuming him and stopping any rational thought as he writhed on the floor, his mouth letting out a constant scream.
He felt Potter's grin against him, little brat, and tightened his hand in the man's hair, urging him to get on with it. Potter's mouth felt incredible and Draco had to lean back against the kitchen counter in an effort to keep his legs upright as the man sucked him enthusiastically. Potter glanced up, making hesitant eye contact, and Draco let out a broken moan, "Fuck you are so good at that. Such a good boy." He murmured, feeling Potter's groan of response more than he heard it. Potter mouth moved further down then and Draco couldn't help but buck forwards again, feeling himself hit the back of the man's throat and feeling the desperate movement that caused, he pulled back, out of Potter's mouth for a minute watching as the man swallowed and gave a cough. Draco almost apologised for the lack of warning, lack of control, but then Potter was suckling on the head of his dick again, looking up at Draco through teary lashes and he remembered the man's words about wanting to choke on Draco and he  reached his hand out, wriggling his fingers until Potter pulled off again with a soft pop, frowning up at him as he reached out, his own hand meeting Draco's, a look of confusion on his face. Draco took Potter's hand and rested it against his own thigh, just above his knee, "Pinch if gets too much." He said quietly, seeing understanding dawn on the other man's face, Potter nodded quickly, taking Draco's dick back in his mouth and swallowing around it.
Draco's eyes found Potter's and he felt a warmth in his stomach as the man flushed and ducked his head, he had been so worried that this would be too awkward or too weird but somehow it felt just as right as those messages had, Draco thought, tossing back the last of his whisky and placing his glass down, looking back at Potter and trying not to focus too much on the way his throat moved as he swallowed. Potter drank too quickly, spilling droplets down his chin as he did so, when he put the glass down he went to wipe them away, grinning ruefully, and Draco stepped forward, grabbing his wrist to stop him, raising his own hand to clean the man up; he heard Potter's sharp intake of breath at the touch and realised, a tad belatedly, that this was the first physical contact they had had. Draco slid his thumb up from Potter's chin, across the man's lips and almost closing his eyes in pleasure at the way Potter automatically parted them willingly, his tongue flicking out against Draco's thumb.
“Lupin.” Harry grumbled, “He just went off on one about how I shouldn’t have been out drinking and it wasn’t safe.”
Remus chuckled, “I did the cooking so I’m pretty sure it’s your turn anyway.” Sirius made a show of pouting but he moved over to the pile of dishes, casting a cleaning charm on each one seperately, knowing that something always got missed if he did them all together.  His mind zoned out on the task, returning to Harry and Draco and how happy Harry seemed with the other boy; the besotted expression on his face a mirror image of his father’s whenever Lily was around.  “You okay?” Remus asked quietly after a moment.
Hermione nodded, smiling guiltily, “Just don’t tell Ron how much I bought!” She said and Harry laughed, looping his arm through hers and nodding down the street towards Gringotts.
“She said you might want to…” Harry trailed off as Draco took his hand. “Cause you saw it and stuff.”
“I had school.” Dennis said shortly, “My parents need me to do well.” The fact that he was the only child they had left who could was left unsaid and Harry felt a tightening in his chest at the thought, an image of Colin sat in the gryffindor common room revising for his OWL’s flashing through his mind.
They heard footsteps in the corridor and Draco pulled back regretfully, “I have to go to work soon.” He said quietly as they heard the steps carry on past the room and Harry nodded, turning his head to press his lips to Draco’s palm which was still resting against his cheek.
Tonks had arrived with the head of auror training in tow and Sirius had beat a hasty retreat to the garden to give Harry some space with them, having a feeling he knew what was going to be said. This was confirmed a few minutes later when his cousin came out and sat beside him on the bench, 'They want him to have a week or so off." She said, "He's not happy."
“Sounds good.” Harry agreed before his godfather could argue, he rose from the sofa and moved to give the man a quick hug, “Won’t be long.” He said and Sirius sighed but nodded and moved out of the way.
“How is Dennis?” Harry asked, trying to sound casual. The last time he had seen the boy it had been at Colin’s funeral and Dennis had barely looked at him; Harry had always meant to stay in contact but somehow it had never happened; he’d never quite known what to say, or how to say what he really wanted to.
"What?! Sirius he loves you." Tonks said, sounding so sincere that he met her eyes again, "Not to mention that I wouldn't ever… There's nothing there between us, just friendship and banter. He literally treats me like a child half the time so…" She gave a shrug, "I'm sorry, Rem was there during difficult times and I guess it was hard to put that friendship to the side but I will step back and -"
He wondered if he was overthinking it, wondered if he was being overdramatic when he felt physically sick at the thought of Harry casting that curse. This was Harry for Merlin’s sake, little Harry who only used a disarming charm when defeating the evilest wizard of a generation, how the hell had he managed to cast such a dark curse? But Draco had said it was an accident, he reminded himself, that Harry hadn't even known what spell it was he was casting… He must have been terrified when he saw the blood, Sirius decided, the thought strangely comforting.  Sirius tried to close his eyes and settle to sleep but in his mind all he could see was Draco bleeding and Harry stood above him screaming
"Good luck." Remus said in response and she laughed as she walked past them and into the house. "You okay?" Remus asked quietly once she had gone, looking as awkward as he ever did when he was caught between the two of them.
Hermione sighed “They looked up to you when you were in school so it’ll be no different.” She pointed out and Neville gave a half shrug, his cheeks colouring slightly.
"Well since you asked so nicely." Draco said, sliding his fingers out of the man and murmuring a protection charm before patting at his arse to get him to pull his knees onto the bed and get on all fours. Potter was whimpering out pleas again as he got into position, trying to push back against Draco's dick as he slid it across the swollen hole. Draco slapped his dick against the man before slowly pushing in, groaning at how tight he still felt.
“Thought you’d quit.” Tonks said and Harry shrugged, watching as she pulled a tiny packet from her pocket and cast an enlargement charm. Harry took one from the pack she offered and lit it, inhaling deeply and relishing the burn in his chest even as the taste made his lip curl. He held the cigarette out as he exhaled, Tonks taking it from him and placing it in her own mouth; Harry had been smoking, on and off, since the end of his fifth year when he had stolen some of Dudley’s in a desperate attempt to rebel against the prophecy; at some point that summer he had found Tonks behind the Weasley’s woodshed doing the same and after an initial, slightly pathetic, attempt at reprimanding him she had given him his own. Harry had smoked for much of the next year, sneaking down to quite parts of the grounds and learning just enough scent banishing charms to avoid Hermione’s wrath; the horcrux hunt had forced him to quit of course, which he’d found harder than he had thought and he hadn’t restarted again after the war, well not really anyway, now he only tended to smoke when he was either very drunk and out with Seamus or when he was with Tonks.
Tom appeared within seconds of Hermione piling her plate on to Neville’s and they waved off the offer of dessert, thanking the man as they paid their bills; Harry knowing well enough not to bother offering to cover the other two’s by now.
Tonks looked as though he had slapped her but to her credit she simply nodded, “I’d better get to Hermione’s before she goes to bed.” She turned away, moving down the corridor before she paused and turned back to them, “Just… Keep me updated, and give him my love when he wakes up.”
“Thank you.” Draco murmured in reply, his voice catching slightly and he turned away, focusing his gaze on Harry.
“He takes it black, two sugars.” Harry told Sirius who nodded and squeezed his knee, Draco’s eyebrows furrowed together but he didn’t comment as Sirius left the room. “You sure you’re okay?” Harry asked softly as the door closed, he stroked his finger along Draco’s own and smiled as the man gripped his hand tighter.
Sirius chipped in to the conversation occasionally but mostly he just watched the two men; the way Harry deliberately brushed their hands together as he reached for his wine glass and the way Draco was leaning ever so slightly to his left and closer to Harry reminded Sirius, once again, of how James and Lily had been together.  They bounced off each other, Sirius thought, gentle teasing thrown in with small smiles and casual glances that seemed to be checking they weren’t going too far; when the topic moved to school quidditch matches Harry steered it back to international sport, a small crease above his eyebrow.
He could feel the heat and euphoria leaving his body, opening space to a cold, heavy weight in his chest. His eyes were searching for the exit, he had to get some fresh air, to get his head free. Suddenly breathing had become quite hard and he decided to go outside without looking at Draco a second time.
The birthday party was everything Harry had expected it to be. Obviously, he again was totally underdressed. It turned out Astoria’s fashion choice was totally appropriate for the occasion as everyone else looked like walking rainbow flags as well. They were having colourful shots and had conquered the dance floor once again after a rather small amount of time when Harry noticed something different that day. It was not only Draco who got a lot of attention. Of course, he once again looked stunning with a well fitting and obviously expensive pair of grey pants paired with a form fitting shirt, this time with a collar just wide enough to suggest there was more ink in his chest, and a tight black vest over it. Even though having tried to do his very best at preparing himself he still had gotten the faintest sunburn on his cheeks which made him look even more radiant than he already did. If he had not fallen for the other man, he totally would have today, Harry thought to himself.
“As much as I would love to devour each and every millimetre of your delicious body right now, starting from your neck down you chest, sucking your dick until you beg me to let you cum only to fuck you senseless and repeat all of that all over again for the next three days until you are incapable of even sitting up, let’s not rush things, ok?”
“That’s the Flower of Life,” she had explained after noticing his look, carefully applying sunscreen to every tattoo except the skull and the snake. Her arm also featured the banner with
I decided to try publishing a bit differently and will now upload smaller bits of the chapters but more frequently (at least  hope so)
Also, Harry was not really attractive in any kind of way. His face was boring, his eyes were of a solid green colour, the hair a giant mess, lips always chapped no matter what he did to them. And then there was the lightning bolt scar on his forehead which had become even more visible now that he had sort of a tan. His skin colour also was nothing to be exited about. Even though he was not that ashy anymore, his skin did not have this luxurious bronze undertone to it he would have loved to have. His upper body was not that muscular or anything despite all training efforts, his knees still looked weird and his legs were quite hairy. He was not sure if a gay man was suspected to trim his hair. He was really not that special. Not like that beautiful Clive guy.
A guy about her height with light blond hair and glitter all over his face was approaching her right now, trying to get closer. With a laugh on her face and without letting go of Harry’s hand she went for it and started dancing in his direction, eyes locked on the guys lips, she seductively moved her head. Harry saw the kiss coming way before it actually happened. It looked playful and fun, not as heated as the two guys he had watched before.
From the very first day on Draco of course has claimed the one old, gigantic wooden chair in the garden for himself and spends huge amounts of time there reading. Harry was more than pleasantly surprised to find his boyfriend sitting there completely at peace with himself when he returned from work on a Friday afternoon. Carefully not to disturb the other man, he walks closer only to be greeted by a warm smile twitching around the corners of the pink-haired’s mouth. A clear sign, Draco is up to something.
And then Draco made the most awesome sound Harry was sure he had ever heard. It was a tiny, low moan, one of those that makes your heart jumps out of your ribcage because you can hear all the desire and affection out of it. And the best part was that he could not only hear it but also feel in in his mouth, the soft vibration of Draco’s throat. They were so close.
The apartment felt so different compared to his own place. This was one reason he actually preferred spending his days off there. The other one obviously was Draco. Well, not only Draco but all three of them. They somehow managed to live their own live on their terms and they seemed to enjoy it quite much. Harry still could not understand how they managed to hide their true selves from the Wizarding World but it seemed to be something along “having learnt what side of yourself to show in which situation, making people see the version of yourself they would expect”. At least this was what Astoria had told him after a few more drinks.
Andromeda was pacing through the kitchen of Grimaud place restlessly, disbelief shining through her eyes while she let her gaze wander from Harry to his surroundings and back again. They had been here for at least fifteen minutes unable to agree on the topic. This was something he somehow had expected. Stubbornness ran in the Black family. Sirius had not been any different and neither was Teddy. Or Draco. Whom indirectly was the topic of their disagreement.
Harry patiently waited for him to finish as he knew how much Draco hated to be interrupted before answering: “This is not what I meant, and you very well know that! And just for your information my wanking fantasies and wet dreams in the weeks since we were hanging around clearly indicate that I am indeed very gay!”
When they left the restaurant, Draco quickly squeezed his upper right arm and gave him a genuine smile.
He had pushed his chair out of the sun and away from them under a bunch of trees and refused to even go near the water. His hair was a messy disaster and his whole body seemed to be covered in a thick layer of sunscreen, making it impossible for Harry to find out how the tattoos on both his arms as well as on his left calf and his right thigh looked like. There were only three things Harry was certain of:
In the past few weeks Harry had taken the chance to compare his colleagues when they were under the shower together to see if he found any of them attractive. Which he basically did not except for that one lean blond guy who had transferred to the London quarter just a while ago. He was rather cute – maybe because he resembled Draco a bit. Anyways, all those men were taller than him, broader and better equipped.
“Oh gosh, I am really sorry. See, this happens when I try to do emotional gestures. I ruin your meal.”
For the very first time in his life Harry James Potter had willingly decided to dress up to go out. Is was not the Ministry nor his friends telling him to put on some nice clothes but his very own desire to look good (and maybe impress one particular other male). He went with nothing too bold but already something way out of his comfort zone. The black jeans were tighter than he was used to wear them which did not mean they clung to his skin at all or anything like that, they simply gave away the idea that in fact Harry Potter had a rather decent bum. At least he thought so but let’s not start on that matter again. He had paired the pants with a form fitting black and white button up featuring a choker neckline which he hoped would make him seem taller.
I am sorry it took so long, but I have a hard time letting those two go. Suffer with me through this part and I promise the rest of the story will be all fluff and happiness
“Well,” she started, touching his hair with a confused expression, “I was having some difficulties renewing my Glamour, so I was wondering if you would be so kind as to do me the favour of helping me, Prince Draco.” Harry wondered if it was normal to be able to hear eyes rolling instead of even seeing them, because he clearly just now had. Also, the girl had mentioned Glamours, what was that supposed to mean?
Here he was, standing in front of his bedroom mirror making stupid faces, starring at himself, uncertain of what to think about that weird guy looking back. Harry tried to imitate the half-smile Draco prominently featured whenever he was flirty and failed terribly. He rather looked like a crazy person trying to act normal than anyone actually seducing someone. How did Draco pull this off?
It was plain black with green writing on it. The enchanting made sure whomever glimpsed at it was able to read the message: "I was Draco's fake girlfriend while he was kissing boys!" This coming from the one girl always being supportive of Malfoy made people realise that after all the posters might not have been wrong. Why else should Parkinson make sure, her best friend since Hogwarts was outed? Also, denouncing herself as fake girlfriend was nothing, she could probably be proud of.
Finally, it is time for us to return to where we started our journey from. Remember the awful article about dear Draco being undatable and everything. Well, around half a year after the breakup of Harry and Ginny, around three months after the official breakup and two months and 16 days after having the first civil conversation with Draco Malfoy Harry Potter was sitting on his very couch, suffering under a hangover from the night before and trying not to stare at the other man because his heart was still racing from when Draco had smirked at him. Because the little voice in Harry’s head told him he in fact really, really wanted to kiss the pink haired man right now, touch the messy hair, smell the fantastic scent of him again. Still, Harry was not sure about his sexuality, even though being gay was rather likely. What his consciousness had realized without a doubt was that he was more than simply attracted to Draco.
This confession left our poor Golden Boy completely speechless. He would have never expected such a confession.
Molly Weasley on the other hand had definitely planned to do so. Her letter was more of an invitation card. Nothing alike the ones Harry had seen on Draco’s bedroom wall. Actually, the former Slytherin tended to have a bit of a nostalgic spleen as he was saving each and every invitation he went to. They were all pinned on top of each other above Draco’s desk. The ones he did not care to attend usually landed directly in the trash bin.
Well why would one make rules if they did not leave room for exceptions. If I will be every willing to date someone again I for sure will let this person know personally.
The blond man sitting opposite of him burst out in laughter. He put down his drink to instead touch his forehead with three fingers while placing his elbow on the table. Eyes closed he could do nothing else than to keep on laughing. A tiny dimple appeared on his left cheek. It stayed there even after the laughter had settled for a deep smile whose mischievous aftermath even reached the storm grey eyes which starred at Harry from between his fingers.
Not the clumsy one, who did not care about a few spiderwebs or old carpets or used furniture but just live with it because it was comfortable as it was. The one from the papers still idealizing him as the perfect hero of the Wizarding World.
Of course, they had been! Back then they were children just as much as he himself and his friends. The prejudice that the other house was constantly plotting evil schemes against him was something he thought he had overcome a long time ago. Wasn’t it obvious, Draco was not the tiny Malfoy brat anymore?
“Thank you for the kind offer but I will have to decline. Maybe you forgot about this or did not know but I indeed do not eat any dead animals at all. I am sorry for the inconvenience.”
Harry went back to the table and handed the food to Draco. But instead of immediately taking the first bite, he continued where he had stopped.
After hearing this speech Harry felt the moisture in his eyes like every year. But something still was different this time. Instead of the nagging question in the back of his head that kept him wondering if he would still talk about Ginny with so many loving emotions after all those years together he felt a warmth in his guts while imagining how it would feel one day to look back at thirty years together with Draco.
“Well Potter, I do tend to cause this reaction in men. Look at me, who would not want to share their bed with me. So, is this your reason to ask me such a question?”, the blond man responded with a witty tone in his voice. It had taken Malfoy quite a while to regain his cool and laid-back mannerisms. Now he was leaning back in his chair, casually stretching his long legs a bit and looking at poor Harry with one eyebrow slightly raised, twitching in amusement while a smug half smile was playing around his lips.
Instead of insulting him for the suspicion of lying to him Draco had chosen to simply proof his point by sending a picture of himself. Obviously coming out of the shower. His skin and hair still wet from the water. His chest naked. Him wearing nothing else but a towel around his waist, or at least one could guess so. And Harry was lost.
Harry looks surprised for a second but then quickly follows Draco inside who refuses to tell him where they are going, only hinting that they will be gone the whole weekend. He nervously packs the sweater which is still most presentable together with way too much clean underwear and a ton of new shirts he has recently bought to impress Draco.
Her smile warmed up even more – if this was possible and she reached for his hands, pride shimmering in her eyes. And she was right. A giant bolder fell from his heart and he could finally breath. There was only one person left to tell.
“Or do you have any other plans for tonight, master cook?”, Draco playfully asked. As soon as Harry shook his head, the pink haired man turned on his heels into the living room, four platters in his hands and explaining that they had to hurry up a bit as Daphne should be arriving is about an hour and he for sure had to get dressed up a bit to celebrate the occasion.
With every moment Harry knows he falls more and more in love with this weird, arrogant, extravagant beautiful person. He is completely lost by now, he knows. And he could not care less. With every quirk he discovers this warm thing inside of him, that screams ‘Draco’ from the top of his lungs and seems to cover almost every inch of his insides, just grows and grows.
But this was not Malfoy anymore. The guy sitting next to him was Draco, a man who had worked in a gay bar. Who shared a flat with a good friend. Who liked to get take away food and eat it on the couch. Who really tried hard to make Harry feel welcome. The pink-haired, tattooed, freckled and careless Draco of course still was the same person. He was snarling at people, loved to talk about himself and most of the time kept his distance but Harry actually liked that about him.
The pink haired man started shaking his head and it became obvious Hugo was fascinated by the colour of his hair. He managed to get up and touch the neatly combed back strands, destroying the presumably two hours of work Draco had spent on perfecting his hair style. Hermione instantly tried to grab her boy and force him to stop but instead Draco supported little Hugo with one arm, conspiratorially smirking at her.
For now, Harry actually was happy with how his life was going. He had found a new friend in Astoria and as long as he could talk to Draco about the sex thing, that was enough. He really liked spending time with both of them, but on a different level. Toria was his friend to chat and laugh and feel comfortable around, Draco however, was fascinating, witty and charming. Harry did not feel any desire to meet someone else in his life. He wondered, if he ever met someone who would make him realize his sexual preferences. It would still take our beloved Golden Boy a few more weeks until he realized what Hermione at this point had already found out while quietly listening to him lionizing about how different Draco was. Of course, the confidentiality pact made sure, Harry did not spill out any kind of information on Draco’s actual looks but still he had plenty of reason to talk about his former rival.
Harry understood the signal, detaching himself from the other man even though he would have loved to continue on the spot but maybe it was more important now to talk.
“I used to work here from time to time. Helped with the recipes for the cocktails. You know, great potions student makes a great barkeeper, that’s for sure!”
They were watching a sitcom Harry did not know but still had no problem following as the plot was rather light hearted. He noticed Astoria dozing of every so often. Draco also did not really pay attention to what was happening on the screen but rather starred at it blankly. Somehow it was both weird to sit next to each other and not talk and at the same time Harry was eternally grateful to not be forced to discuss the night before right now. His head still hurt and the silly TV-program helped over the silence between them. When Astoria was touching his feet, leaning on them while taking a nap, Draco managed to avoid touching him at all. Harry wondered if the other man was afraid, he had given away the wrong impression and was scared now, he had fallen for him.
This already was awkward! A thought he would have coming up quite a lot throughout the whole evening.
“Was you shagging another guy the reason you and the Weaslette broke up?”, Malfoy curiously asked, forcing all the colour to drop from Harry’s face at once. He eagerly shook his head, maybe a bit to forceful and returned to staring at the table in front of him. Noticing the shift in the atmosphere between them, Malfoy leaned in once again and lowered his voice quite a bit.
Applying gentle pressure to his lower back, Draco directs him onto the backseat, whispering “I hope you like the car. It’s a classic Aston Martin, one of the few Muggle things my family grew fond of. And it is hell a lot of fun to drive – if you want to try out later.”
Cuddled in their Weasley sweaters they had settled in the living room and Harry once again on that day had to face one of his greatest fears: The moment when Draco and Hermione had to talk to each other for the first time after finishing school. He had imagined the situation countless times from the moment on he and Draco had become friends, fearing the awkwardness, the tension between them, the unspoken years of hatred for each other. It turned out he had misjudged the situation pretty much.
And she had been fine with it. She did not care with her other son so why should it be different with him?
Offering him an amused and very flirty half smile was Draco Malfoy himself. But not the usual business one with the bleach blonde hair and his formal attire. It was a very pink haired man in a tailored pants and short sleeved button-down combination looking at him. The tattoos were very visible as well as the piercings in his face.
He is not surprised when Astoria instantly starts singing loud and wrong. What gets him is Daphne drumming to the beat and joining her with a very rough but beautiful voice. He looks at Draco and sees him moving his lips without a sound, flickering his eyes from the road to the mirror and towards him. Maybe he thinks he will blame himself.
Harry wordlessly pointed the way to the kitchen where his over-eagerness was on display, already knowing it were only mere seconds before he would make a fool of himself the second day in a row.
From that very evening on Harry became a constant member of the party and was normally not even invited to join them as they all would simply assume he was coming with them anyways. He had been afraid that things between him and Draco might have become weird after the kiss but no such thing did happen. Harry refrained from doing so again and Draco was his usual flirty self towards him, always making sure, he still had something to drink and was feeling alright.
Exactly five days later at around 6.30 pm, which was a Saturday (which is important to know because it would have been one of the Saturdays Teddy normally spent with Harry), Teddy firecalled his godfather, some thing he only was allowed to do when he got so excited he would refuse to go to sleep for hours if he could not tell Harry every detail of his adventures.
He is uncertain what to expect as the CD is clearly a mix put together by any of the three but the dot above the I being transformed into a flower dates towards Astoria who seems to be as exited about the music choice as her sister. Meanwhile Draco watches them through the back mirror, one eyebrow raised.
This was harder than he imagined. He had been searching for words for a good five minutes before finally being pleased with his message. Former drafts had included quite a few phrases that could easily be interpreted as being rude such as “you were only annoying at the beginning which freaked me out a bit. But I like that you always make fun of Draco” or “I thought that you were quite impolite at the beginning so Draco was right” or “Isn’t it terribly thoughtless to call your best friend a git?” So, you see, the message he settled with was the tamest he could come up with.
What followed after this was a rather cute story of Malfoy trying to kiss Pansy Parkinson and really, really hating it. After that he managed to ‘accidentally’ hold hands with Blaise who after a long winter of sending longing glances across the common room decided it was time to kiss his friend. This time Draco liked it far more. So, they kept kissing until about March when the poor blonde boy caught Zabini holding hands with another girl.
He was rewarded with a playful shoulder-knock once again and looked up into dark grey eyes which obviously showed the other man was impressed as well as touched.
I am sorry for the late update today but proud auntie here had to welcome her nephew on this planet <3
“I know you like this whole idea of snogging me senseless in hidden corners, kissing me in secret and exploring a male body for the first time without having to fear anyone will know but I cannot do this.”
Believe me it would not be an exaggeration if I told you Harry was ready to go and grabbing his keys only a minute after receiving this message. Finally!
He returned to the kitchen to once again be shook to the ground. Draco and Molly were still in there even though the Punch seemed to be finished by now. This could have been a normal scenery considering how awkward this evening was in total except for one little detail:
Some conversations become especially had when you have to have them with your mother. Or someone who is like a mother to you. In Harry’s case this would be Molly Weasley, the woman who brought him to the train on his first year at Hogwarts, the person sending him Christmas gifts every year, the one human being whose anger would always scare him to death. For a long time, Harry had argued with himself that he could not simply replace his real mother with the head of the Weasley house (I am sorry Arthur, but we all know this is true!) but finally he had come to a conclusion: One could feel towards more than one person like they were your mother. It was not blood binding them but the love only a mother could have for her children.
Were his lips supposed to be so thin? His upper lip was almost invisible and the bottom one not really any taller. Those lips in the mirror did not really scream “kiss me”, did they? They looked scratchy and dry and brittle. He should definitely work on that if he ever wanted to kiss Draco again. Rubbing the stubbles on his cheeks again he focused his gaze on his hair.
Turning around and letting out the Gryffindor he was – always finding a solution – Harry quickly spotted a young man obviously waiting for his date, as his gaze was anxiously switching between the entrance of the restaurant and the menu, clearly terrified by the food prices. Harry waved at the waiter and calmly explained they had to leave early but it would be his pleasure if the prepaid menu would not go to waste.
Nobody in the whole Weasley tribe had even wondered when after about half a year she had announced to start working again. Nobody in the Ministry even dared to say a word against her returning to work part time or the fact that sometimes she would bring Hugo with her. You did not mess with the second in command in the Department of International Magical Cooporation. At the age of 23 Hermione had already outstripped every expectation the Wizarding World could have of her and she was still going strong. The whispers of her soon becoming the next Minister of Magic grew louder ever day but she had already emphasized she would not commit to such a time-consuming job now. Now it was time to have a family.
When he woke up again the afternoon most certainly had turned into early evening. Daphne was having her second serving of cheese pizza and Astoria was vast asleep.  Draco was the only one halfway paying attention to the telly where some heavily tattooed teenagers obviously were hunting monsters while suffering under substantial and love crises. Interesting choice. He carefully stretched a bit and shrugged the blanket from his feet, ready to get up. Draco turned to him and rose an eyebrow. “Everything ok?”
There would be enough to talk about for the world in a few minutes, his outer appearance should not be one of them he had decided beforehand. With a last glance to his mirror-self (whom he could have sworn was winking back!) he turned around.
First of all, posters started to appear. They featured a variety of phrases such as: "Draco Malfoy plays for the other team." "The Slytherin prince fancies snakes and not princesses." "Draco Malfoy: from prince to queen." "Instead of skirts Draco Malfoy lifts shirts." Having initially been seen as an attack on the former Death Eater the campaign had not been taken seriously. Then the day came Pansy Parkinson wore
“Yes, mother told me, cousin Theodore was really found of the show. He never misses a single episode and insists on recounting them to her.”
Since his return to the wizarding world at the age of only 11 the press had always been trying to get as much information from Harry Potter as possible. During the first years it was due to Dumbledore’s authority that he was not run over by reporters wanting interviews. Later, his friends and the Order of the Phoenix helped him hiding from the press and after the war it was Ginny who took over most of the public work for him. Normally he would simply kindly refuse to give any interviews or such a thing at all.
“You were right, the boy needs every bit of family he can get. And so does my sister. I cannot believe what I’m about to say but thank you for forcing me into that. Maybe it was time to let the past finally become the past.”
“Isn’t it lovely to see Hogwarts being alive once again, Mr. Potter?”, she asked while taking place opposite of him. It was nothing unusual for her to join his lonely evenings at that time. And lonely they had been. During the first months he was kept busy by all the work that needed to be done at the castle first and then with the people suffering under what had happened to them, what they had to see. But day by day everyone managed to return to their normal lives step by step. It was a slow process, still he noticed the changes. Ron and Hermione rather spending time together than as the three of them, students getting hyped for Quidditch matches once again, a Ravenclaw girl crying over her homework instead of the victims of war. Together with the castle its inhabitants managed to heal.
This was his chance to get out of this unbelievable stupid idea! Harry just had to tell Malfoy that of course this was a joke and he just tried to insult the git. Call him a faggot. A Sissi and this was it. But somehow, he did not want to do that either. Under the expectant gaze of the blond man he managed to very slowly nod once and after that quickly shut his eyes.
Harry had to stop reading at this point. Well, this was not that bad, was it? One could read it like Draco was only trying to protect him and that was a good thing, wasn’t it? Unfortunately, we all know our favourite Gryffindor has always had a hard time accepting people deciding what was good for him over his head. Maybe, a tiny little voice in his head told him, he had secretly hoped Draco would simply out him so he would not have to do this by himself.
As every year the next guest could not actually be there that evening but still Arthur raised his glass to honor Fred, a hero of a righteous war and Harry noticed just how much Draco wanted to leave the room in this moment but he stayed. Taking in a deep breath Arthur turned to Ron, telling his boy how proud he was to have an actual Auror in his family. Then it was Hermione’s turn.
They had been together for about two months when the owl had arrived. It was neatly addressed directly to Draco, not like the ones before that simply had asked Harry if he had a plus one for Christmas. Not that their relationship was a secret. They had been out from the very beginning and maybe that had helped his family to accept it very fast. Draco was willing to commit to him, it was obvious. If this commitment however included a family dinner at the Burrow was a totally different question; one Harry had not intended to ask this soon.
Draco’s hand was covered in sauce and he had a hard time not staining himself while cleaning it and at the same time excusing himself for the wasted food.
The seating arrangement at every Weasley family gathering had turned to be more and more difficult with the years to come as their number definitely had increased quite a lot. Normally it was a first come first serve situation. As Draco was their newest guest, he was pretty much overwhelmed with the sheer amount of people trying to get a good spot and looked rather helpless, clinging to Harry’s sleeve. He more than gladly accepted Hermione’s offer to sit next to her which lead to Harry and Ron joining them at the other side of the table, Hugo neatly tugged in between them, looking at the stranger curiously.
Had it not been for the slightly amused tone in the other man’s voice, Harry might have wondered if Draco was indeed complaining. What he actually wondered was if this whole situation would have been less tense if he actually had picked up Draco and they had walked here together. Well, at least the other man would not have to wait for his arrival all by himself. He definitely was not good at this dating thing at all.
And then she was gone, only the sweet scent of her hair lingering around for a few more moments and in the end, it was him crying. Maybe he had needed to tell her to find closure, too -  to start something new.
Dancing on the other hand was Astoria’s domain. As soon as the music started to resemble anything she might like in the slightest way she was already on her way onto the dance floor, happily pulling Harry with her. It seemed to him as if she was more than glad to finally have someone who was willing to dance with her.
With a light heart Harry left this conversation, reassured on what he was planning on doing the next day. An entrance worthy and dramatic enough to convince Draco Malfoy himself, he, Harry Potter, was not hiding anymore.
Of course, it was her who grabbed his hand, caressed it and made him look at her. She was so strong, even with tears in his eyes. They looked at each other for a long time without saying anything. In the end they hugged goodbye and she whispered into his ear.
“I know what you are thinking. And no, Remus was not gay, he was simply in love with Sirius and they both were fine with it. They were gorgeous together and it took Remus ages to get over him. In the end he managed to fall in love with my beloved Nymphodora and I could not have been happier with the partner she chose. You know, Remus has always been dear to me.”
Meanwhile the bathroom door opened and Harry could hear footsteps once again. This time it was Draco who made his way to the couch, hair still damp, rubbing his face with a towel. He also was wearing comfortable clothes, something Harry would have never imagined him in. It was a plain white shirt and some joggers hanging loose around his waist and still Draco managed to look stylish. Not that Harry dared to look for too long. He was way too embarrassed because of what he had done the night before and therefore starred at the black screen of the telly on the opposite wall.
Andromeda handed him a mug – his favourite one of course, the one with the chipped rim she originally wanted to throw away ages ago but he insisted on keeping. Of course, it was his favourite tea as well – a rather boring blend of black tea and cinnamon which always somehow reminded him of the Gryffindor common room and times where his life felt easier (even despite a maniac dark wizard trying to kill him and the world expecting wonders from a small boy).
“Are you free this weekend?”, he asks playfully even though he very well knows Harry always tries to keep his weekends free so they could spend time together and do things.
Sirius felt a wave of nausea go through him and he grabbed Harry’s other hand, squeezing it tightly, “Will it have affected him? The cruciatus?” He asked, thinking if Frank and Alice and biting back a cry at the thought of Harry ending up like that.
Sirius opened his mouth to reply but Malfoy got there first, “Why the hell did you not tell me about the threats?” He asked, his voice low and tense, his eyes firmly on Harry now, ignoring the fact that Sirius was still stood in front of him.
Tonks watched them until they were up the corridor before turning back to Sirius, “A while after the first attack then.” She said, talking more to herself, “I’m not sure it’s related at all, but obviously we’ll double check. In case them being together has upset anyone.”
Harry shrugged, a sudden urge to open up and admit how little he enjoyed it going through him but knowing that anyone could be listening and it would be front page of the prophet by the morning, which would hardly go down well with his supervisor. “Yeah, it’s good. Interesting.” He said, “Did you still need Gringotts?”  Neville nodded in reply, joking that Harry and Hermione had better stay outside in case they damaged anything and Harry rolled his eyes, though secretly thought that his friend may be right, the goblins were still giving them dirty looks two years later.
“And you realised he was a lovely boy now?” Sirius asked sarcastically, hating himself for it as a shadow of hurt crossed his godson’s face.
“Only until ward round in the morning I would imagine.” The healer smiled, “Would you like a drink?”
Until five minutes ago that was when the 'last active' counter suddenly switched to online. Draco may or may not have spent the full five minutes staring at his phone, initially he had assumed the man would message him but that felt less and less likely with every passing minute. Maybe Potter didn't want to talk to him, maybe he thought last time was a mistake, maybe he was talking to someone else, Draco realised, feeling his jaw tense at the thought. He shouldn't be surprised really, he had only liked Potter's profile to start with out of a weird kind of curiosity and it had been a total shock that Potter had messaged him, and even more of one with what he had said. Not that Draco was complaining about that; it had certainly led to an interesting night.
“Don’t know.” He said, “Don’t want to know.” He added as Draco looked at him incredulously; he had some idea of course but, well, he really didn’t want to think about it. He crunched and swallowed the rest of the mint before sitting up and kissing Draco, “Better?”
He glanced over at his cousin, giving a small smile at the new lilac hairstyle before realising just how exhausted she seemed; her complexion was, as always, perfect and there was no trace of bags under her eyes yet her shoulders were slumped and she had a pained look on her face. “Is it bad for you? Someone else looking at the case.” He asked, wondering if that was what was bothering her.
He felt his throat tighten, “I’m okay, I just feel… I dunno.” He said finally, really not knowing how to explain all the thoughts going around in his head.
Hermione smiled tightly, “That’s good.” She said, though she didn’t sound convinced and Harry resisted rolling his eyes. Hermione had responded pretty much exactly as he had expected; a quiet acceptance of his relationship with Draco alongside an unspoken uneasiness that Harry was sure was going to bubble to the surface eventually.
They were quiet for a moment, listening to the sounds of Malfoy moving around in the bedroom, and Sirius contemplated Harry’s words; his mind returning to Regulus causing the usual guilt to sit heavier on his chest. He swigged from his coffee using the burn on his tongue to distract himself from those thoughts “How did it even start?”
Harry, however, was sat at the kitchen table when Sirius walked in, watching as Remus pottered about tidying up dishes from the night before. "Morning." Sirius said and they both looked over to him, Remus smiling his own greeting, Harry ducking his head back down.
“You love a rebel.” He retorted, laughing as Draco reached into the pocket of his robes and pulled out a tube of mints.
Ron’s mouth formed a tight line. “Maybe once. But looking back it was pretty two way, we gave as good as we got. And that’s all kid stuff really. Everyone’s been through so much since then. Harry’s been through so much.”
“You okay? In pain? Do you need a healer?” Sirius asked, reeling off questions faster than Harry could answer them.
Remus had been his first, and his only, love in every way, their break up during the first war had broken Sirius and he hadn't even tried to move on. He had cried the first time Remus had kissed him after he had left Azkaban, had spent so many nights dreaming of the moment that he could scarcely believe it was really happening. He knew there'd been others whilst he was in prison, men and women that Remus had probably loved, and he tried not to think about it too much, knew it was more complicated than he made it in his head and yet the idea that he was replaceable was always there, and the man shagging his younger and far less emotionally damaged cousin really hadn't helped with that.
There was a silence for a moment and then a soft, “Oh.” Harry couldn’t bring himself to look up but then he heard a soft laugh, “Well that’s… nice. That’s good.” Remus said and when Harry did finally look at him the man was smiling and turning to Sirius, “Why are you not yelling? Did you already - Oh dear did you walk in on them?!”
Draco gave a shrug, “The feathers stuck but they came off in my hand.” He muttered, not sounding concerned, “I don’t understand how… Harry checks all his mail.”
“No! I… You don’t have to apologise.” Remus said quickly and when Harry looked back up at him the man was watching him with concern. Harry tried to smile again but it didn’t seem to help and Remus moved towards him placing a hand on his shoulder and pushing him into a chair at the table, “Harry.” His voice was soft, “It’s okay.”
Draco let out a soft moan, palming at himself over his pyjama bottoms, Potter had gained confidence since last time and Draco wondered absently if that was alcohol related, although he had got the feeling that the man was a little out of it then too.
"Thanks but…" he gave a shrug, sitting up and looking around at the discarded clothes, "Busy day tomorrow."
He looked up, finding Zabini leaning back in his chair regarding him cooly. “About the only decent thing the muggles sell.” He said with a shrug, completely blanking Harry’s filthy look.
“Draco’s here.”  The man said, raising an eyebrow as Tonks stood up; taking a drag on the cigarette before dropping it to the floor, stamping it out and blowing the smoke in his direction.
“Uch.” Draco flipped, turing to face Harry, “I suppose I’ll survive. Sooner we get back to your flat the better.”
“Calm your tits Rem, he’s just holding it for me.” Tonks said, rolling her eyes and taking the cigarette from Harry, handing him a small piece of card in return, “Here you go; they answer floo or the phone.”
“That’s what happens the week before September first.” Harry pointed out, taking a swig of his beer and rolling his eyes at Neville who stifled a laugh, “Besides, S’good practice for our Nev here.”
“I’m staying.” Sirius repeated, cutting across his husband and scowling as he and Tonks shared a look. “I won’t leave him here. Why don’t you think it’s a risk?” He asked his cousin.
Neville shrugged, telling Harry that Dennis had seemed okay, “He said to say hi to you, when I said we were meeting for lunch.” Neville added around a bite of sandwich and Harry smiled, feeling a little less guilty for not having spoken to the boy.
He let go of Draco’s hand and pulled himself up in the bed, “Physically I feel fine.” He said, “I’m… I’m just figuring the rest out.” He didn’t want to talk about it, didn’t even want to think about it really and so he took Draco’s hand again, frowning at the man, who looked more unkempt than Harry had ever seen him before “You look like shit.”
“I’m fine.” Draco murmured, giving him a soft smile in response and Harry smiled back, leading him out of the room and up the stairs. The cottage was fairly small, compared to Malfoy Manor or Grimmauld Place at least, but Harry loved it. Sirius and Remus had moved in during his sixth year, after Sirius had woken from his coma, and Harry had only managed to visit a few times before he had gone travelling with Ron and Hermione but after that, after the war, the cottage had become his safe haven for months.
“Love you too you daft sod.” Sirius said, ducking as a tea towel came flying towards his face. “You know you can use magic to wash up right Moon?”
Without thinking about it Sirius reached out and grabbed the man’s arm making Draco flinch backwards and yank it away. He looked scared suddenly and it took a second for Sirius to realise that he was expecting him to comment on the scars. “Go be with friends tonight. Look after yourself yeah?.” Sirius said, feeling his throat tighten again.
“Look you promised him you’d try yeah?” Remus said quietly and when Sirius looked up the irritation was gone from the man’s face, replaced with only exhaustion and Sirius hated himself for that, Remus deserved better. “Just keep your comments on Malfoy until Harry’s gone home?” The man suggested and Sirius nodded silently as he heard Harry come back down the stairs.
“We don’t doubt that.” Remus said quietly, placing a bowl of apple crumble in front of the man; Draco glanced up at him before turning back to Sirius, clearly waiting for his response.
“Cup of tea?” Remus offered, looking confused at the change in atmosphere, and Sirius smiled his thanks, squeezing his arm in greeting and sliding into a chair by the table, opposite Harry. Harry barely acknowledged him, his eyes flickering upwards for a second before he looked back at the table, Draco had definitely told him Sirius realised, watching as Harry raised his hand to his mouth, gnawing at the skin on the edge of his nail; Sirius reached out and touched his arm to stop him, surprised at the speed Hary pulled it away from him and the panic on the man’s face, “Don’t bite your nails.” Sirius said softly, offering him a smile.
The bathroom door was open as Sirius walked past and he stopped short on seeing Draco stood in front of the sink, washing his face. The man was dressed in a pair of Harry’s, too short, pyjama bottoms but what had caught Sirius’ attention was his bare back, or more specifically the several thin scars that criss crossed it. He felt a wave of nausea at the realisation of what spell must have caused them and that they, unlike the ones on Draco’s arms, were unlikely to be self inflicted. “Did he do that?” Draco spun around to look at Sirius, his face paling and his lips drooping down as he stared at the man who suddenly felt as though he had overstepped the mark, “Sorry I -”
“It’s your godfather.” Sirius he supplied loudly, before adding “Maybe let me in?” A little more quietly to the blonde who was still blinking up at him in surprise.
He pushed open the door to his room, smiling as Draco groaned, “Sirius decorated it.” He explained, the look of distaste on Draco’s face at all the red and gold furnishings making him laugh.
Harry caught his eye as Remus rose and began to clear up the plates and get dessert ready, waving off Draco’s offer of help, “I’m just going to the loo.” Harry said quietly, raising an eyebrow at his godfather that was clearly telling him to behave.
"Message me?" Draco asked, dropping his hand and Potter nodded, giving him another quick, shy smile before he ducked out of the room.
“Says the man who alienated Harry the second we got back.” Sirius spat out the words without even considering their impact, a wave of self hatred washing over him as Remus’ face clouded over.
He gave a shrug, “It’s fine.” He said, he didn’t really care who knew about his childhood, everyone that mattered to him already did after all, “So who…” He trailed off, leaving the question hanging and Draco let out a loud huff of air.
"Me too." Draco agreed, also sitting up and picking Potter's trousers up from the floor and handing them to him.
Harry shuffled on the sofa, pulling his feet up under him and resting his head against the cushions; he could hear Remus and Sirius talking in the kitchen, heard his name said in hushed tones, and sighed. He had only been back here a couple of hours and he had been asked if he was okay at least ten times and been offered four cups of tea since then; he knew it was all done out of love but frankly it was exhausting.
"He went upstairs, sulking." Remus said, "Asked if he was okay but he told me to get lost so I figured I'd give him some space." Sirius nodded, wondering if he was supposed to tell his godson off for being rude before deciding it wasn't worth the hassle, hopefully he'd be in a better mood later, he thought as he stood up and moved towards the house. "Cuppa?" Remus asked.
“And you’re okay with it?” Remus asked after a moment, looking at Sirius who gave a half shrug, avoiding his husband’s gaze. Harry stayed quiet, hoping they wouldn’t end up on another discussion about Draco’s past; he didn’t think he had the energy for another argument.
"Hi." Potter murmured, he looked unsure of himself, his eyes flickering over Draco's bare chest and a small flush reaching his cheeks.
“It doesn’t fit with the way he’s been attacked so far. I think the person targeting him is too much of a coward to actually do it themselves.” Tonks said quietly and Sirius nodded, starting to understand where she was coming from. “How long have he and Draco been together.”
The last few lines made his heart jump a bit. If arguing with Draco always went like this, he would be glad. Not that he intended on hurting the other man any further. And in the side note he was ‘Harry’. He went to work eagerly thinking about what to send to Draco next to please the disgruntled dragon.
The rest of the night Draco spent drinking an obscene amount of shots, smiling politely but could not be convinced to talk to Harry about any serious matter anymore. It was as if they had hit an invisible barrier, a wall the pink-haired did not dare to cross or even touch again, as if he had already told Harry too much, been too vulnerable, too human. Luckily for Harry, Astoria managed to keep him quite occupied and therefore stopped him from overthinking. This night was definitely too much for him, the kissing, the revelation, the strange wording.
Draco stands directly behind him, compliments Astoria sarcastically on her sophisticated choice of wardrobe which she simply counters by offering him a matching pair of glasses, shaped in a teardrop form. Draco looks at them with distrust for a second before he puts them on. Automatically, the tint becomes several degrees lighter and turns into a soft purple fading into pink – a colour that matches Draco’s hair magnificently. He tips the edge of the frame with one finger and one side of his mouth curls into a victorious grin.
“We should get the pizza then”, he simply said, feeling a certain rush of adrenaline as well as confidence streaming through his veins while he tilted his head a bit forward, almost touching Draco’s collarbone with his lips while still pulling the other man closer with his left hand securely wrapped around the waistband of the sweatpants, careful not to touch the skin below. “If you insist on the chronological order.”
If he hadn’t felt so unbelievably underdressed and conscious about his looks, he might have enjoyed the colourful crowd around him way more. But standing next to Astoria made him realize how little he knew about fashion. She was wearing boots with gigantic heels that made her taller than him, together with tights that were shaped like kitty heads at her knees an a very short black dress. He hair was half way up done in two tiny buns above her ears that made her look like a character from those Japanese cartoons. Her eyes were covered in glitter and she was enthusiastically chatting with Draco.
And believe me, Harry really tried to feel the same. To genuinely be convinced he had played his part and was now free to do whatever pleased him but for someone who had always had a prophecy hanging above his head, a certain direction his life was supposed to go it turned out to be impossible to hold his feet still. This was when the idea came to his mind that he could become a staff member of Hogwarts and be useful in the future.
Now Draco cackled himself and explained with a very calm tone: “As long as it makes Harry happy, I love to pretend to be one hell of a sappy Gryffindor for Christmas. Even though it is very impolite to overhear other people’s conversations!”
“Glue and fabric! And scissors but you have to get them; I am not allowed to. We have to make the dress for Astoria now so everybody knows she is my girlfriend!”, Teddy explained with an earnest expression on his face, the one only five-year-olds could have while explaining absolutely obvious things to adults who were so silly because they did not get it.
“I think eyeliner would suit you very well because your eyes are really beautiful. I have never noticed that they are not plainly grey but have a hint of gold in them.”
Although still being clearly visible, it had been altered. The hollow eyes of the skull had been filled with colourful flowers Harry did not know and the body of the snake seemed to be crackling, brittle stone. Below it the tattoo continued with a banner featuring the words “
“I am trying to save whatever your roommate has left over and turn it into something edible for a guest I don’t know! Don’t worry, I will be gone long before your little party starts!”, he snarled back at the other man. If his help was not wanted, why did they ask for him! There were a lot of things, Harry was capable of being made fun of for. His cooking was not one of them.
“Shit, how late is it Potter?”, Malfoy asked him quickly, his eyes still focused on something behind them that seemed to be coming closer. Irritated, Harry looked at the wall behind them which told him it was already fifteen minutes after the usual time Malfoy left. The latter one seemed to be rather nervous when Harry finally noticed the woman heading towards them.
Even if it was meant as a joke Harry could do nothing else but imagine Draco as described. Naked, in his bed, the long limbs stretched out, the blanket only covering a few inches of that gorgeous body. Interestingly, he noticed, his mind decided to censor this fantasy, covering up Draco’s most intimate parts. Still, Harry could feel the effect these thoughts had on him very clearly and therefore he forgot to write back for a while.
Some part of him desperately wished Draco would one day casually swing by to tell him how he spent lazy Sunday afternoons playing in the garden and the big rooms on the top floor. Stories of how a little, mischievous boys once wandered through these halls and played tricks on his family. But somehow Harry knew, this would never happen. When Draco was born this house had already had it’s fair share of history and the resistance used to live here.
Harry somehow felt as if there was more behind the delayed response than showering even though the thought of a very naked Draco made his cheeks flush quite a lot.
But for now, he had to deal with another very special spouse of the Black family who demanded his full attention while roaming through his grandmother’s drawers in order to locate the perfect piece of fabric. Harry wondered – not for the first time – if this attention seeking thing was a character trait which ran in the family.
There was only one way to find out and his godson had already been bagging him to send her a picture of his masterpiece, needing to know if she approved of his fashion choices. This was not a test if Teddy had nailed her outfit but rather him wanting to know if she understood his concept of how to dress. Harry ruffled through the little boy’s hair after having taken the picture and added a “
He took another sip, obviously pleased with himself and the fact, that he perfectly knew, Harry had only understood half of the terms he was using to impress him. The cocktail however did actually taste simply amazing, the Gryffindor had to give him that.
He had no intention to proclaim such a thing. He would have never thought his attempt to help Draco could be misunderstood in any way. Of course, Ron had to be joking right. Unfortunately, his best friend looked at him with this one serious expression on his face he had scarcely seen in the 13 years they had known each other by now. Ron was not making jokes at all.
Hearing these words Molly turned around and pushed her fist into her sides hard, getting really close to Draco who looked very confused. Even thought he was at least two heads taller than her, his boyfriend seemed to be pretty intimidated by the small woman coming even closer.
Unmoving they stayed like this for a few more moments, foreheads pressed against each other, panting, most of their bodies still touching, before Draco managed to spit out “you are making this so hard for me” in a very rough voice, arousal swinging in every syllable as well as the tiny breaks in between the words.
“Yes, Potter,” Draco broke into an embarrassed little laughter which Harry later on would only describe as utterly sweet, something Draco would always hate him say. Indeed, when they later told the story of how they got together Draco’s version would be him being way more confident, smart and cool and Harry would add a ton of sappy details on how bright the grey eyes were glowing, how electrifying their touches were and everyone around would roll their eyes, listening to the same story for probably the hundredth time while trying to remember really hard that those two who obviously were meant to be together from the beginning had not always been the nauseously sweet couple who would after years still send longing gazes over the room.
“And then the part of you marrying Harry! As if Dad was in a rush to finally get his Golden Boy to settle down. I still can’t believe you could keep a straight face!”
Which brought him back to wondering why it always was the same time slot. They were meeting each other for casual drinks for over two months now. The days tended to differ; the time of the days however always stayed the same. Before leaving first, the former Slytherin always suggested a date for their next meeting “at the usual time”.  So far, Harry did not have the guts to ask the other man if there was a reason for that. He could already imagine plenty such as Malfoy not wanting to be seen with him or the blond aristocrat attending fancy balls and other high society gatherings in the evenings. Maybe it was as simple as Malfoy not wanting him to feel like they were dating. Which they were not! Harry could never imagine actually dating a man, particularly not Draco Malfoy! In fact, he could hardly imagine himself ever dating someone.
A very well-deserved night sleep had been followed by way too much time in front of the mirror, speculation on what to wear to work until he remembered the stakes very high on him simply not changing out of his robes at all and therefore simply going with his usual attire. He regretted it as he had changed into his normal clothes half an hour before the arranged time and since then was stalking through his tiny office like a tiger trying to break out of his cage.
Only once he wanted to use his fame to help Draco and it turned out the exact opposite of what he wanted.
And then Draco Malfoy did something that shook the Saviour of the Wizarding World to the very grounds. He winked. At Harry. Playfully. A one-sided smile was still playing around his lips when he looked at Harry. Like they were on the same side and he was trying to assure his former enemy everything was going to be just fine. Just to make this clear: everyone one else in the whole world, be it magical or not would clearly have considered this behaviour flirting. Everyone but Harry who still was so not used to anyone making a move at him that he was just simply confused.
At this point they obviously had to help Arthur towards his comfortable chair as the alcohol had won. Harry’s face turned into a glowing red lantern by the mere thought of him marrying Draco but again, his boyfriend impressed him by softly touching Arthur’s shoulder and declaring it was an honour to be considered a part of this great home.
“See, I really suck at this! The whole dating thing. I mean I normally do not even let it get that far. A guy starts liking me because of my looks and the way I behave outside but as soon as it gets more intimate, like getting to know each other intimate, not the plainly physical stuff, they automatically get bored. They realize I am not what they were expecting and then they loose interest. But then there was you and we were friends before and I thought it would maybe be different because you knew me but I still tried everything to impress you with offering drinks and bringing pizza and dressing up. I mean, who goes to someone else’s house wearing pants so tight you can barely sit in them? I am trying so hard to impress you that I completely forgot this is not about making you think I am hot and easy to go but interesting but actually showing who I am. But I somehow am still not sure you will like who I am. And then I forced myself to do everything that normally works to impress you like bringing food, acting comfortable around your kitchen, lounging on your couch to invite you to just well touch me and nothing works. And right now, I am really frustrated and I thought about just leaving as I normally do when dates do not work out. And then I looked around and noticed how hard you were trying, not only with the food but with how this place looks like and everything and I suddenly realized that maybe you are just trying to impress me as hard as I do and this might be the reason why we are stuck in this loop of forcefully trying to show of our best side when actually I want nothing more than to sit with you on that tiny couch, eating all the food and watching a series we both know by heart and sharing awkward side-glances and feel my skin prickle everytime we accidentally touch until the tension gets unbearable and I cannot help myself but toss down the pizza box and snog you senseless!”
“Teddy, if you like a girl you will also like kissing her,” he explained to the boy who was shaking his head wildly and sticking out his tongue. Well, maybe it would still take quite a while before Teddy would like kissing.
Something inside Harry twisted in a way that made him feel really good as he realized, Draco had actually really tried to impress him with his looks. He wanted to look nice. For Harry.
The other body moved away slowly and all that remain was the lingering scent of a promise which never fulfilled. Draco had gone towards the kitchen, making the space between them bigger.
Draco, who was loud and colourful and out and extravagant and seeking attention and everything Harry had avoided to be. Draco, who tried his best to make Harry feel welcome, who had changed so much over the years, who held a confidence Harry was envious about deep down. Draco, who flirted with him all the time, who told him to ask before he kissed him again. Draco, who did not tell Harry off for kissing him. Draco, who had been through the same war as he, who had also survived and searched for a new identity. Draco, who had become a close friend and who always joked around with him but never made clear if he could even imagine being more than friends.
It took Harry a moment to realize Draco meant him and he just looked confused. He was really insecure about what to say next, luckily Draco seemed to notice that and continued.
This one cryptic phrase kept spinning in his mind the whole next day when they had their hangover tradition watching telly and ordering huge amounts of food. He really wanted to ask Draco what he meant with that. If he thought about Harry in – in a sexual way. If he liked him or if he was simply too much to stand. What was the purpose of explaining who he had been, of reminding Harry they once stood on opposite sides? Making clear it was already enough work to be friends? Suggesting they did something wrong? Admitting he wanted more?
One, all of Draco’s tattoos were done in black and white. Two, there were more hiding behind the white shirt the other man refused to take of because he was not willing to “let the sun burn away my delicate skin so you terrible people can make fun of me later on. And now leave me alone in my demise!” Three, even though Draco looked rather pitiful with the white sunscreen covering his whole face and bare skin and he seemed to hate the mere thought of touching sand or salt water, which made him appear as more of a whiny baby than his usual elegance, Harry could not stop thinking about how cute he was with all that special wishes. Even unpolished and in anything else than his best shape he found the other man utterly handsome, not because of his appearance but because Draco well was Draco.
"Why did you never tell me?" Sirius asked quietly, wondering if Remus knew but knowing almost as soon as he'd thought it that the man couldn't, he would have told Sirius.
“I’m not overjoyed but the kid’s happy… I said he has to come to dinner, so we can get to know him properly. Make sure he’s changed.” Sirius’ voice was tense but he smiled and Harry felt a warm glow in his chest at the realisation of how much his godfather was trying; he hid a grin as Remus squeezed Sirius’ shoulder and murmured something in his ear making the man roll his eyes.
Harry was still shaking with anger when he arrived at the small muggle pub in Peckham that he had been supposed to meet Zabini in that afternoon. It was now seven o’clock, about two hours later than his original plan, and so the pub was packed and noisy as Harry shoved his way past sweaty bodies in an attempt to find the men. He spotted them in a corner booth, laughing at something and couldn’t help but smile; it still felt weird to see Ron with the Slytherins, and he knew that it must be even stranger for Ron to see him with Draco, which made him all the more grateful for how accepting Ron had been of the whole thing. When Harry had admitted to Ron and Hermione what was going on - nine days, four dates and a hell of a lot of sex into the relationship - Ron had only taken twenty minutes and quarter of a bottle of firewhiskey to nod and declare that “that sixth year obsession makes so much sense now”, a point Harry had ignored.
Harry had tried his best to prepare himself mentally to see Draco without his Glamour. The blond man obviously wore one as well, our Golden Boy had successfully concluded. He had tried to imagine what his former rival was hiding under the enchantment. He had considered a tiny but tasteful tattoo, maybe even an earring but by Merlin was he not prepared for what he was actually seeing right now.
With a theatrical bow and a – Harry had to admit that – rather charming half smile on his lips he eventually exited the little coffee shop. And left back a rather confused young man who blankly starred on the card in front of him, wondering if he had made one of the biggest mistakes of his life. Was asking Draco Malfoy for advice really a good idea? The definition of aristocratic git? But something at the back of Harry’s head told him that even though his former school rival made a scene out of his departure, the moment the blond man noticed the seriousness of this matter, his behaviour had indeed changed from playful nagging to something one might even consider as understanding for the other guys situation.
Harry’s anger and confusion that had built up in the last half an hour together with the fear of being a burden really wanted to get out, he was trying his best to provoke a fight but Draco’s next response ended the topic immediately.
When she told him that, he could hardly imagine ever feeling that way for anyone. There had never been a girl he looked at in that way. Sure, he could enjoy a woman's beauty but that was about it. What she told him next was what really shook him to the ground.
They are not going away using any magical form of transportation it seems as Daphne is already seated on the passenger seat of a mint green to grey convertible old timer which by the looks of it costs more than most people earn in a year or two. For a moment, Harry admires the beautiful form of the car. He has always had a thing for old cars but never really considered buying one for himself – I mean he has magic, why bother driving.
Harry blinked. Once. Twice. And then wished he had something like a big heavy iron pan next to him so he could hit himself onto his very stupid head where his malfunctioning brain was sitting. By Merlin, what had he done?
For the at least twelfth time in a row, Harry was looking at himself in the mirror, fixing yet another stubborn strand of hair and practicing a serious look. To call his emotional status nervous would have been more than an underestimation. He was shaken to the bones, but let me be clear not because of what he was going to do. It was more the way he planned this to go down that scared him. Maybe this was why he had decided to spent such a huge amount of time on his looks. He was dressed to kill from his brand-new dress shoes over to his for once well-fitting pair of dark jeans paired with a simple white-collar shirt and a matching grey vest. Even his socks and belt were hand selected (not by himself but by the stylist he had asked for help, the one also responsible for his new haircut and styling).
I am sorry for the long delay! I am forced to work from home and somehow I totally got used to writing solemly when I was taking a train. And secondly, I share my office with two attention loving bunnies. Try to resist them, I dare you
Harry could be so sure of this because in another picture he was facing the taller man, bearing the same exact expression on his face. It was uncanny. Not only did he fancy Draco, this was true the other way around as well. Draco liked him and therefore kissing was hard for him. It was not a game to him.
Draco gave him a very short crooked smile and Harry noticed how well placed the piercing actually was, moving just the lightest bit to enforce the expression. All of the piercings and the extravagant hair colour really made Draco look more approachable. And handsome. Which Harry only noticed because he was still figuring out if he was gay and automatically checked out every guy. Not that Draco was his type. Definitely not, he did not even have a type! And even if it could never be someone who stood out from any crowd so much!
The head of the Weasley family continued his praise for his children, congratulated Charlie on his latest dragon habitat, encouraged Billy to keep on fighting against racism in the Wizarding community, thanked Fleur for being so patient with her starry-eyed idealist and rebellious offspring. For Percy he had inspirational words concerning his new position as Defense against the Dark Arts teacher his boy just had started. When he came to George, he gratulated the newly wed man on handling both his business and a gorgeous wife, Angelina he praised for her effort in their family business.
All the other customers he had seen while waiting for Draco (whom had explained to him that being on time was so not Malfoy style) were around his age and dressed way more fashionable than he would ever be able to. He himself stood out with his comfortable clothes which fulfilled no other purpose than to cover his body, as well as the blond man, who always seemed to wear formal clothing, be it a button down and dress pants or even a whole suit. Harry guessed that this was because they always met directly after work. He could not imagine that even Malfoy would find this type of fashion comfortable in his leisure time.
Staring at him blankly without blinking even once, Draco Malfoy, the undeniable eloquent aristocrat who never seems to be short of a sharp but thrillingly entertaining response, finally looked shaken. He seemed very unsure as what to make out of this question, but honestly, who wouldn't?
“After finishing your last year here, you will leave Hogwarts and start your own life. This is not your home anymore, Harry dear. For you it unfortunately is nothing more than a reminiscence of the past, a memorial for people you lost.”
Turning around in the mirror his next sceptical thoughts concerned his buttocks. Those old jeans he kept wearing all the time, did they do anything for his behind? Was there anything worth doing something for? What kind of butt did other man consider attractive anyway?
Before clicking on the play button, the dark-haired man realized how much he actually was looking forward to hearing Draco’s voice and grinned sheepishly. There was no way he could even tell himself he was not crazy about the other bloke. And right now, maybe this was not one sided at all. I mean, he immediately responded.
He was brought back into reality by the other man who closed his almost rant on how people would not see how obviously gay Tanner van Burm was in his opinion. “Of course, being out there in the open changes a lot for you…”, he closed his monologue which gave Harry the perfect opportunity to change the subject onto a matter he had wanted to discuss for quite a while now.
“Well, Ginevra, luckily your training indeed paid of as ridiculous as I thought it to be in first place. You should be happy your father does not longer insist on you getting married and that I took that burden of your shoulder.”
He was still wondering if this was the moment where it would be polite to leave them alone when Draco addressed him: “I really hope you like dumplings. This is a dumpling house.” With a charming half smile, the pink haired man patted the cushions next to him, offering Harry a seat.
And then there was him. Plain old Harry in his plain old orange shirt with his plain old, worn out jeans and plain old dirty sneakers. His hair was as ruffled as always and he could have sworn he had spotted some leftover sauce somewhere on his face. He felt so underdressed. Had it not been for Draco earlier on he for sure had insisted on a fresh set of clothes. But when Astoria had asked him if this was how he planned on going out, Draco had immediately reacted for him, explaining to her that Harry looked just fine as he was. Needless to say, that once again the heart of the Savour of the Wizarding world had skipped a beat when her heard that but his explanation for that reaction had been the simple fact that he had already drunken three of Draco’s tasty but dangerous cocktails.
He decided Friday was as good a day as any other as they would have the next day off and Teddy was supposed to go to Mrs. Malfoy. And he even managed to get there just in time, neither too early nor too late.
After having said that he took a hearty bite from his falafel and managed to not stain himself to Harry’s utter surprise. Well, not really surprise. Harry knew, he would look different when trying to eat his sandwich. Maybe because he was lacking this utter grace Draco always had, no matter what he was doing.
“Bad enough, that I am living with a man who is definitely not going to marry me!”, she sighted dramatically while getting comfortable on the small dark brown couch. Harry decided to keep her company as it really started to feel weird standing in the middle of a room, holding a cup of tea. She put her legs on the cushions as well and Harry noticed she was actually wearing comfortable sweat pants. Somehow, he did not expect her to even own such a piece of clothing. At the same moment when he scolded himself for this silly thought he wondered if that could mean Draco also wore comfortable clothes at home. He could definitely not imagine that at all!
He looked back from the lips towards the eyes and saw how soft they had become before the fluttered shut and he could feel the soft sensation of warm lips on his own, could smell the amazing fragrance, luxurious pink hair brushing over his own cheek, a nice contrast to the cold metal ring touching his own lip. There was a firmness in the touch and at the same time it felt incredibly gentle, teasing, testing. And absolutely perfect.
Harry put away the newspaper wondering as well. One could read this as a sign or was he delusional? A few moments he got the answer in form of a text message.
surrounded by a very classy flower background. A smirk stole itself onto Harry’s face as he unfolded the sheet of paper, carefully trying not to break the seal. One could say this way of messaging was pretentious but it was so Malfoy-style he found it kind of adorable.
“This comes as a surprise after all – after all that history you share. All you did, he did – all the war. But I am certain there is a reason why you feel like you feel today. I mean people can change. And if I can believe my sister can overcome her darkness and be a part of my family again then of course her son, who had been nothing but a child during war, can become a man worthy of being loved by you.”
Nervously turning the small business card over and over again, Harry had of course arrived at the address way to early. Instead of 5 p.m. he had been sitting there since four, eagerly waiting for whatever evil surprise Malfoy had planned for him. If he was going to be fast enough to notice the malevolent plan, maybe he could still escape the worst.
He indeed had been frequenting the apartment regularly now instead of meeting up with Draco by himself. Most of the times it still was the latter or his roommate who invited him over but from time to time Harry managed to ask Draco what he was up to on a certain date to find out if he was free. Which he often wasn’t due to self-employment. He however managed to always give our favourite Gryffindor an alternative date - as if he were scared that our dark-haired mess would stop asking to spend time with him.
“Am I the only gay bloke you could think of who is not related or somehow close to your former fiancée?”
“I already told you not to call me ‘Mrs’ Draco dear, everyone around here is family and family does not need titles or last names.”
‘Well, at least I wasn’t wrong about the earring’, Harry thought to himself. Although, the “earring” indeed was not a single, tiny piece of jewellery but at least four on the left and three on the right side. Also, there was some sort of larger earpiece at the very front of Draco’s left ear.
Well I would most certainly lie if I told you all of my former flings – I would definitely not call them relationships – were rather problematic. You of course will understand that I cannot and absolutely am not willing to give away any names but there have been man, who were officially in very happy relationships, making efforts to hook up with me not only once. As I am a man of – even very doubtful – moral standards I of course refused such invitations. But even I have to admit to have been fooled not only once but twice by men who secretly dated me and also had a relationship with a woman at the same time.
He leant in and grabbed the back of Draco’s head, gently but certainly pulling the other man towards himself. The words that tried to escape his mouth only turned out as mumbles as Harry already captured those seductive lips with his own. The feeling, the smell, all of it was even better than he remembered and all of a sudden, he indeed felt quite intoxicated. The earthy and sweet scent of Draco’s skin immediately made its way from his nose inside his body and turned his bones into a soft mess. His skin burnt where their lips touched and he teasingly pushed a bit more only to be rewarded with the tiniest and best noise he had every heard in his life so far.
The response turned out to be a bit different to what he had expected. Instead of simply sending the pictures she had added him to a group chat and uploaded them there. The chat had two more members, two unfamiliar numbers. Luckily, he realized, both members had added a nickname. One was “The one and Daphne”, the other one simply said “D.M.”. Somehow Harry could feel how much Draco would have wanted his signature to be spelled cursive. Then he finally took a look at the pictures.
Malfoy quickly looked at him, silently asking for help and an answer himself and Harry remembered that they were bound by a contract not to reveal the actual topic of their meetings. Even though it had started rather rough until Harry managed to ease up in Malfoy’s company there was no logical reason to not assume, they were friends now.
“Thank you for telling me, that was very brave of you. Thank you, I think I needed this for closure.”
After reading through the short text two more times, checking every word carefully for a second, secret meaning he signed the parchment. If he had looked up during his studies, he would have noticed Malfoy who could not hold back an amused grin when he noticed Harry’s mistrust.
Harry starred at his phone blankly, having trouble realizing what this meant. Draco had feelings for him, he liked him, there was a chance this fantasy of them being together could become true. He felt the gigantic grin on his face growing until it hurt the corners of his mouth. Scarcely did he even notice that he was not scared because of the new development. Hermione would have told him by now that this was because he actually, genuinely had fallen for the other man.
Splashing cold water into his face to think about something else than a very handsome pink-haired man between his sheets, Harry critically analysed his own features in the mirror. He had never been a self-observed guy but since he wanted to appear attractive for someone, the time he spent in front of a mirror posing had drastically increased. Draco always looked plain perfect, even if he did not try to (Secretly, Harry was sure that Draco put a rather huge amount of effort into his ‘out-of-bed’ looks – he was quite right but Draco would have never admitted that until much later when Harry finally got the chance to see what a mess his boyfriend really was in the morning and believe me, Draco is not a morning person! And Harry loves him the most when he is a vulnerable, grumpy mess.). He brushed the chaotic bunch of hair out of his face to reveal the famous scar. Retracing the faint lines with his eyes he wondered if he should start hiding it more to ensure it was not a constant reminder for Draco of where they knew each other from.
We could stop our little story here and simply leave our two boys in that tiny bar, slowly becoming friends but that somehow would leave some questions open, such as why Draco does have pink hair or why Harry did not mention the ear rings and tunnels so far, let alone the tattoos covering the blond guys body up onto the back of his hands. To get to this part of the story we have to fast forward a bit into the boys regularly meeting until the day Harry gets to meet Astoria and Daphne Greengrass or as Draco prefers to call them ‘The two-headed demon who will once cause my death by liver failure or a heart attack’.
Luckily, he had prepared himself for this moment of speechless fear by writing down what he was going to say word by word and again with the help of not only Hermione but also Andromeda (Luna he could not ask because that would have been unfair to other magazines). He reached for the sheet of paper in front of him and began reading, paying no attention to the people starring at him.
“So that means you came like this because you are hidden in plain sight and nobody knows who you are?”
“Well, I do not think someone with your questionable taste offers the right amount of fashion sense to accompany dear Harry on a journey to a new identity.”
“Most of us are hiding something, a secret they do not want the public to know. Maybe because they are ashamed, scared, they do not want to feel vulnerable. Maybe because they think their voice is not important or that they are alone. That they are different and not important. That there are things one does not talk about. Maybe they are simply insecure.
“Well, why did you not do it then for the last few weeks? Because I stayed on your couch? Is it really that important to you what I think about you?”
Again, they looked at each other without knowing what to do next. Harry sighted deeply before asking Draco in defeat: “Maybe we should leave and go somewhere else?”
In Molly’s simple but beautiful and practical handwriting she had addressed Draco as if they had been close friends for quite a while. As if their families had not been enemies for a long time.
She stopped at their table, her arms crossed in front of her chest and starred at Malfoy expectantly, completely ignoring Harry. He still wondered if he had seen her before. Something seemed to be familiar about her.
He smiled lazily while starting to mix a drink they would share while talking about anything else but their feelings. Harry knew he would leave after this drink and again not return to the apartment for a long time.
The next day Harry got up as usually around 6.30, stumbled into the kitchen to prepare his coffee and the slurp into the bathroom. Every morning he was wondering how he even managed to find his mouth with his toothbrush. Since he had been living on his own, getting up in the morning was way less stressful as he did not have to talk to people anymore. Luckily. He hated talking before coffee.
Harry was definitely not sure what he meant by that phrase. The girls? The party? The club? Their seats? Or maybe he was referring to the whole evening? Or did he actually mean the two kissing guys Daniel and whomever? Harry noticed himself grinning at his counterpart wildly. He kept looking through the room where people of all skin colour and sexual orientation were dancing. He could spot some adorable Drag Queens as well as a few other kissing couples and he really, really felt comfortable. It was way too loud and overcrowded. The air was full of different smells – not all of them pleasant - and still: He loved it.
The world had indeed stopped spinning but now it was turning, turning, turning, gaining speed and in its centre, he stood, overwhelmed by the single most magnificent feeling ever. His skin was burning and his hands were shaking while he was searching for the other body, wanting to touch it. He could get a grip on the vest and clung to it as if he would be drowning any moment, as if the only way to get air was through Draco’s mouth.
Draco helped her gather Hugo’s blanket and softly explained: “I think I will make an exception for your boy, he is quite special.”
“Potter, this isn’t a joke to you, is it?”, he carefully asked. His voice was much quieter than before as if he wanted to make sure this conversation stayed between the two of them. The smirk around his face was gone. It had been replaced by a faint frown. When Harry finally found the courage to look up again his gaze was met by very earnest looking grey eyes. The atmosphere of this conversation had changed completely.
Instead of entering a career straight after finishing school or traveling around the world to find himself, Harry Potter did nothing else in the first year of his new life than renovate the rooms at Grimmauld Place, have regular Sunday evening dinners with the Weasleys and try to have a healthy relationship with his childhood sweetheart Ginny. For the press everything sounded just perfect and if you had asked Harry back then if he were happy, he would have certainly been surprised by your question.
