"Speaking as your friend," Pansy began, "You just need to get over yourself and go do it. Because if you don't, you'll chicken out, and miss your chance. And wouldn't that be a disaster?"
Of course, Draco hoped, and would continue hoping that they would speak again. He couldn't bear not being close to her, but at this moment in time, with what he had been doing, he just didn't have the strength or willpower to be around her when he had publicly admitted that their opinions were entirely opposites. He missed her, that would more than likely be clear to her, but if it was, she was too upset to mention it. Or maybe she felt the same? Draco hoped so. He didn't want to be the only one feeling so pathetic that he had lost his absolute best friend. It didn't matter that maybe them, and the rest of Slytherin house were the only ones to know that Draco and Pansy were actually capable of having best friends, because what was their opinion when so many of them still judged Draco for actually embracing muggle inventions. Nothing. Their opinion on his friendship was nothing, because their friendship would surely make Harry Potter, and Ron Weasley look like acquaintances. It was Pansy Parkinson who had been the first to find out that Draco found himself heavily more attracted to males, and she had yet to babble that secret, despite her ever proven role as notorious rumour planter. Hell, it was Pansy Parkinson that had helped Draco even realise his orientation. At some point, albeit a time Draco now tried to forget, he had managed to convince himself that he was totally and completely in love with a girl. He still wasn't sure what exactly it was that had enticed the girl to say yes to a date, but it had excited Draco as much as it terrified him. In a last panic the night before, he had practically begged Pansy to help him because he had no idea how to kiss someone, and a Malfoy could not be a terrible kisser. It was against the law or something. Pansy, being Pansy, had been the absolute best person to go to, and Draco's first kiss had been about as good as you could expect when it involved two kids who had never kissed anyone other than their parents in their entire lives. Not. Good.
I am very much not good at writing trial scenes and I don’t enjoy it particularly much, so if this was halfway decent I’ll be a happy camper! We’ll get back to Hogwarts and back to Harry and Draco’s relationship after the next chapter—just need to do a teeny bit more establishing of the plot.
As Draco broke away from these memories, he noticed Blaise’s eyebrows furrowed as he drew his hand away. Draco had to recover—he could not show weakness in front of Blaise. “Um...yeah. Bigger room, right. Well, I’m sure Potter will take more than his fair share of the room.” Thankfully Draco’s attempt at diverting the situation was successful—Blaise’s concerned expression turned into a grin.
“What? You don’t think he deserves it?” Caden turned to his companion who looked hesitant at the confrontation. “He tortured you, too!”
He made to get up but Harry gently pushed him back down. “I don’t mean
Harry was so clueless that he just stared at Draco blankly. “Have you gone mad? Did you make all these blocks?”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “He wasn’t a Death Eater. I never saw him and the Dark Lord in the same room.”
A woman’s voice: “Harry, he’s really warm. Someone get Madame Pomfrey!”
“Okay,” Harry laughed. “I understand.” Harry came to sit next to Draco, their shoulders touching. “Are you alright? Well—as alright as can be?”
“It’s going well.”
Harry stopped a few feet from the front door. “Have you ever been inside?” Draco asked.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, sounding tired.
“Yeah, I think we’re about ready to head out. Thank you again, Hagrid. You really helped us out last night.”
And so the two boys chatted as they walked around the village, looking in the shops, and avoiding the Potter’s house ahead. Draco told Harry everything he could remember Professor Snape telling him about his Hogwarts bully—though he didn’t mention to Harry that was how Snape qualified James Potter. Finally, there was nothing to see except the house turned memorial.
“Well, no. But I thought maybe you had...”
Draco, usually sitting at his desk doing homework that wasn’t due for weeks, would respond, “No, thank you.” He would rather have been rude, but Mr. Burke’s words echoed in his mind: “
Draco was struggling to breathe, and he felt something placed over his mouth. But no—he didn’t want someone to cut his tongue out again.
Draco looked at the ground, unable to think of a response. “I know you guys are upset with me, and you should be, and—“
“I see,” Christine said, though it was obvious she didn’t believe Draco. “Tell me, how is the eighth year project going? Building a memorial for the fallen...”
Kingsley nodded distractedly at Draco, still in conversation with the Gryffindors while the Slytherins looked on politely. Greg gave a side glance at Draco, but seemed to think it would be better to not draw attention to him. Draco hurried with the cloak outside of Kingsley’s office while Harry was still unable to escape the conversation. Draco knew that Harry would not be happy in the slightest about him just running off, but Draco had to see his mother. He actually had to talk to her, and he had to do it alone.
“It won’t, not entirely. There’ll be other measures that you should take in your daily life as well to help you.” She walked over to her desk and pulled out a sheet of parchment. “Here are some things to do to relieve anxiety.” Draco gave the paper a once over. It described breathing exercises, coping strategies, and even some yoga positions. “I’d like for you to keep this on your person at all times. That way, if you are confronted with an anxious situation, you’ll have something to do.”
“Call me a Death Eater one more time, Finnegan,” now Goyle had his wand out and was getting ready to rise from his seat, sending the room into commotion again. It was true that Greg wasn’t a Death Eater—Draco had been the only student who was marked. Vincent was the next closest, he even interacted with the Dark Lord once or twice.
“Where are we going to go? Do we even know where we’re staying?” Draco wasn’t sure exactly what information was in the letters he ignored all summer.
“So apart from your own family,”
Finally, Saturday came. Surprisingly, Harry and Draco hadn’t discussed their upcoming outing much, even though on Saturday morning they woke up next to each other as always.
“Hey,” Granger said gently at his tone. “I was just joking around, I wasn’t trying to upset you.”
“Relax, Potter, I’m joking.”
to go. I want to get out a bit, you know? I think it’ll be alright.” Draco said this nonchalantly.
Draco was left with the echo of a smile as Blaise, Greg, and Daphne rushed at him, pulling him into Greg’s bedroom. They all spoke at once—
“I’m not sure I’m the one that it’s affecting,” Draco said. “You need to take care of yourself, too, okay? Don’t worry about me. I’m fine.”
“Draco...someone showed this to me at breakfast—“ Harry handed Draco a copy of the
“It’s not about what I want, it’s about practicality—“
“I assume your parents don’t know?” Draco blanched and looked away. “Well, you need to tell them. If you’re serious about this, they need to know, whatever the consequences are. Unless you want to ignore them for the rest of your life. You can’t live two lives when you’re with him, it wouldn’t be fair.” She had a point. “And, you need to come to my family’s house over the holidays and answer to them. They’re going to be wondering why you’re with Harry. He’s a member of our family, and we stick up for each other. And don’t think I’m going to help you with your explanations.”
Draco’s heart dropped into his stomach—he stumbled a bit near his father’s bed from the shock. Lucius’s firm hand on his shoulder held him upright. Draco wanted to say more, wanted to ask his father what exactly he knew, but the moment had passed. Narcissa swooped in to kiss her husband.
I really enjoyed writing this one! Only 3 left in this series—I should have the next one out maybe by Thursday or Friday. Love you guys, as usual let me know what you think!
“How the—how the hell are you searching my mail?” Draco can’t imagine what would have to be involved to stop each and every owl that could possibly be carrying something for him. And they couldn’t have opened everything—what about the poisonous letter?
As for the rest of the letters, Draco hesitantly picked up the first one. He got a paper cut opening it, and sucked on his pointed finger while thumbing through the pages. It was about what he expected, phrases such as “how could you do this to the Wizarding World” and “scum of the Earth” and “you should be in Azkaban.” He told himself it didn’t matter, but somehow he found his father in between those lines from strangers, saying and believing the same things about his own son.
“Ministry officials are not like to believe Malfoys as of late,” she spoke angrily. “And with our son at Hogwarts, unprotected and worse, blocked from performing magic of his own, we were trying to create as little damage as possible for our family.” Draco felt a swell of affection for his mother. She always had him and her family in mind, no matter how flawed they were.
Harry grinned. “About us dating? There isn’t enough money in the world.” Draco glared at him. “Listen, Draco, I definitely don’t want to rule anything out. I mean, we’ve been sleeping in the same bed for weeks now. I certainly have some feelings for you. But I think that we should try to be friends first. And no offense, but that involves you calling me by my first name.”
“What?” Draco said again, very confused.
“We should not waste time with pointless niceties.” This was more like the father Draco had known. “But, since we’re here—“ Lucius motioned for Draco to come forward.
“I know,” Harry said. “I would too. If I—“ Draco guessed how Harry was going to finish that sentence.
“It was a big deal,” Draco said, answering his own question from earlier about why people couldn’t move on. “Death is forever. And I know the Weasley’s are like family to you. You’ve lost so many people, it only makes sense that you would worry about losing them, too.”
Ron took a sip of his drink and set it down a little forcefully. “And how are your parents, Malfoy? Still locked up?”
Draco laughed softly and kissed the top of Harry’s head. “You are so fearless.”
He clasped Draco’s shoulder—which he hated—and pulled him in closer. Draco assumed that to his mother, it looked like a gesture of affection. But his father usually only did this as a warning.
Everyone looked down at the ground, absolutely spent. “We’ll think about it,” Weasley said. “For now, we’ll all go to the Ministry together and turn in the Time Turner in the morning. We’ll hang onto it until then.” She glanced at her fellow students, most trying to comfort themselves and each other through small gestures of touch—hands wringing and patting shoulders. “You all should get some rest. I want to talk to him for another minute.”
“Sounds great,” Harry said, quietly slipping his hand into Draco’s. Draco started at first in surprise, but melted into it. Harry’s hand was so soft—Draco wasn’t sure when he last had this kind of physical contact with someone. Maybe it was never before.
“Why are you up?” Granger asked.
“Dear, I think you’re worrying too much.” Narcissa grabbed Lucius’s hand, which he clenched.
As he lay in bed alone that night, he found that he couldn’t sleep. His mind was swarming with dread, with excitement, and with a terrifying hope. He couldn’t stop thinking about the eleven year old boy with the empty, outstretched hand in comparison to how full he felt right now, both in body and mind.
Now it was Draco’s turn to touch Harry’s arm, though he did so hesitantly and with a shaking hand. “That’s awful. I’m serious. Even you, the biggest prick I know, didn’t deserve that.”
“I’m sorry, I know it’s late,” he heard Harry speak, but not to him. “But he’s having a massive panic attack and I think he’s got hypothermia.”
Draco saw Harry settled in a chair and sat next to him. Most of the pairs appeared to have a third party sitting in the middle, repelling each person away from each other. Draco sat normally and saw that Harry’s feet were pointed toward him.
Harry gave a small smile. “Thanks, mate.”
Draco still had dozens of questions about the parameters of their relationship. He had grown up with everything so well defined. His mother and father went on dates at least once every two weeks, leaving Draco with Dobby or another pureblood family as a sitter, and went on an extended vacation without him for two weeks out of the year to keep the marriage healthy—and he assumed, try for more children. Draco had also heard about Lucius and Narcissa’s marriage agreement. They had liked each other from the start, and once their parents noticed, their courtship began with supervised dates. This was followed by party appearances where they were able to sneak away, and finally they were able to spend time together completely alone. In their seventh year at Hogwarts, a marriage contract was drawn, and they were married shortly after their graduation.
Draco was no longer used to his friends being so subdued. Daphne, Blaise, and Greg lounged glumly on the seats of the train compartment. No one had much to say—most of them were going home to places and people they would rather not remember.
“I know both your parents are alive, and that’s about it. I meet with them tomorrow. I’ll send you a letter if they ask me to pass anything along to you. Do you have anything you want me to say to them?”
“I don’t think that’s true. They are good people who are hurting very badly.” Professor McGonagall sighed. “You are now beyond adulthood, Mr. Malfoy. I cannot make your decisions for you. But I certainly don’t think it would hurt for you to ask them what you can do for them.”
“Except lately,” Blaise chimed in. “What’s going on?”
“About seven or so in the evening,” Madame Pomfrey said. “You came back about two hours ago and promptly fainted in Professor McGonagall’s office. She brought you down here.”
It was a few minutes past ten, and the Slytherins appeared to be the last ones there. Potter must have prepared the others that the former Death Eater was coming, because Draco was met with only reluctant nods—no jeers or insults. Harry smiled at Draco, and Draco gave him a friendly nod in return.
“I just feel that it is unnecessary.”
Draco’s nightmare started to come back to him. He closed his eyes but knew that he couldn’t prevent the oncoming attack. Eyes sweeping the living space, he realized that his body could not turn against him in this room, no way, not in front of all of these people. He knew going to his room would corner him. There was only one option.
Lucius shrugged off Narcissa’s hand, violently. “I WILL NOT SIT HERE AND BE UNDERMINED IN MY OWN HOUSEHOLD!” The glasses on the table shattered and spilled wine everywhere. Clearly he was losing control.
Draco could hardly focus in his next class. Squirming in his seat, he was reluctant to raise his hand at all to answer any questions. He was terrified that he would blurt out “
“There’s nothing to be afraid of,” Harry reassured Draco, who was nearing a panic attack. “He’s just a baby, he can’t even talk yet. You’ll just be another face to him for a while, and he’ll love having another person around.” Harry looked amused. “Have you ever held a baby?”
After taking a quick look around to make sure they were alone, Draco slipped off Potter’s cloak. “Sorry,” he said breathlessly.
Even Draco’s parents were traumatized enough that they no longer ate in the dining room. They purchased a small table for the three of them and put it right next to the kitchen. Draco sat down, being careful to not make a sound. He sat up straight, as a Malfoy should.
“So what?” Harry prodded.
“A friend’s.” It wasn’t exactly a lie. “I’ll come back on Christmas, I promise. I want to be a part of this family. But...on my own terms.”
“Just because a lot of people have seen bad things doesn’t mean that the things you have seen haven’t affected you in a unique way,” Christine said.
“Potter, you can’t tell me that the entire Ministry would stop moving if you wanted to see someone in it. Why don’t you just sneak Draco in along with you?” Daphne asked.
“Whatever you need,” Draco said, grabbing Harry’s hand for emphasis. “I’ll be there for you.”
Draco scoffed. “You don’t even know if it will help. Besides, I can’t imagine a disease for which there is no cure. We’re
Draco thinks about visiting his father, and tries to apologize
Draco supposed that Dean used breakfast to remind him so that he would have the whole day to break up with Harry. But he did no such thing. They spent their time celebrating the first snowfall of the year, with Draco showing Harry how to ice skate on the lake above the giant squid, and Harry pelting Draco with snowballs when he got the chance.
“I’m not going to be anyone’s scorekeeper,” Blaise grumbled. “Especially not for a bunch of goody two-shoe Gryffindors.”
The drop to the ground below looked more appealing than Draco wanted to admit. Then he thought of his mother, and took a step backward. She needed him and had done so much for him—he couldn’t let her down. He was horrified with himself for thinking about jumping for even a second.
“I just mean that you were a kid when you were doing all that! And clearly you’re terrible at trying to kill people, no offense.” Draco let out a huff and took another sip of his water. “I just don’t feel like Madame Rosmerta should be that cross with you. We’ve all been through enough. Sometimes I wish everyone would just move on from old feuds. I know we’re all grieving, but there’s no point in holding on to such hatred. It just distracts from the real issue, which is that there are still dozens of Death Eaters roaming free.”
“You already said it,” Harry said gleefully.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Potter, I should have listened to him, I should have taken his offer, I was so stupid—“ Draco was sobbing again, and Potter scooped him up, burying his face into his chest.
, Draco lamented as his pulled on his clothes. Potter was already gone, and the clock told Draco that he overslept a little—it was a quarter past eight and Granger asked everyone to meet in the common room at eight on the dot. Having no time for a shower, he took a quick glance in the mirror to adjust his hair, not meeting his own eyes, and headed out into the world.
Draco awoke with a start, but he was sure he hadn’t been screaming. After all, that dream wasn’t quite a nightmare. It did not bother him to think about that day—but he wondered if it bothered his boyfriend. Harry was still sleeping peacefully next to him. The last thing Draco wanted to do was wake him when he looked so peaceful, but he had to know.
“Um...I don’t know. I’ll think about it.” Draco was taken aback that Savior Potter was inviting him to anything. The thought of being around everyone and playing Quidditch again made him feel a little sick.
“Shite. That can wait, though, I was supposed to—“ he glanced quickly at Harry. What was he going to tell him? Sure, he had class, but he surely would never be distressed about missing it. “I had to—“
“One more thing, Draco.” The young man turned around in surprise at the mention of his first name. The Headmistress’s eyes were shiny, as if she were about to cry. “Ms. Lovegood informed me that you were at the Astronomy Tower the day you were attacked.”
“He didn’t, Mother. I’m right here. As long as I’m at Hogwarts, I’m safe.”
“Well I didn’t say I was cured! But getting six hours of sleep a night is a lot better than none.”
Harry sat on the bed with Draco. “ I know you don’t want to talk about it, but I promise you it’ll help—“
It was just Harry and Draco again, and they began to walk back to the train station. “What a day,” Draco sighed.
Draco tugged at the collar of his shirt, hoping that loosening it would ease some of the pressure he felt around his neck. He wasn’t quite sure where to go—the hallways were blissfully silent as the other students completed their first class of the year, but there was always a risk of being seen. He couldn’t rely on people just staying out of his way anymore. Last year he roamed these halls like a terrifying king. First years scrambled to get away from him, and he had actual permission to retrieve anything and everything he wanted by whatever means necessary. Though students were certainly frightened of him, he hadn’t felt menacing in the slightest. He wish the others knew that he was like them in a way—just trying to make it through the year without getting killed.
“What the hell is this Granger, an interrogation?” Draco shifted in his chair, ready to stand up and leave.
That memory led to a small, silver wisp coming out of his wand. “Yes!” Harry exclaimed, pride beaming on his face. “I knew you could do it!”
I feel like this second part of the series has been relatively angst-free. So here’s some angst! Not too much longer left in this book. Now we’ll get to holiday stuff, which will include fluff and a whole lot of angst.
Harry looked away. “I got the feeling he knew they weren’t the best guardians in the world. I’m not sure he knew any specifics.”
Draco shifted uncomfortably in his chair as happy chatter settled around him. Diagonally from Draco, Gregory seemed to be having a similar problem, and again Draco noticed his thin frame. Daphne put some food on Gregory’s plate and smiled encouragingly. Gregory managed a small smile back before putting a shaking hand on his fork. The beginning part of the feast passed quietly as the four Slytherins tried to focus on keeping their panic at bay.
“Try being on the run with barely anything to eat for a year, never knowing if your family is safe. Try losing a
Draco thought bitterly. The Healer left and Draco was alone once more.
“Over there on the kitchen counter. Brewed the Muggle way by Granger. It’s not that bad though. There are some crumpets too, if you want.” Daphne looked a little tired, with her long black hair pulled back into braids not concealing the bags under her eyes. Goyle was silent beside her, not even looking at Draco.
“Only thanks to you,” Draco said as he grabbed his bag.
“That’s where he hid after escaping? The Grimmauld Place house?”
“Yeah.” Draco moved his legs away from the table to prevent any jostling from his shaking.
“Whenever you’re ready,” Harry said, sounding amused.
“He’ll be fine. He just gets antsy in crowded situations. There are still a lot of Death Eaters that the Aurors haven’t been able to round up, and Harry sees them in almost every face.”
Harry’s colon and parenthesis looked like a little sideways smiley face, which Draco loved. He couldn’t wait to just be back around Harry. He felt so safe knowing that the Boy Who Lived was sleeping in the same room as him, not because of what Harry did in terms of defeating the Dark Lord, but because he knew he was with someone who could help him through nightmares without smirking at him in the morning, like Theo used to do, or without doting on him and smothering him like Pansy.
Draco continued to have Mind Healer appointments once a week. He and Christine had kept up their routine of playing chess, and while Draco talked about just enough serious things to make sure he was participating, he avoided anything that could set him off. As he and Potter lay in bed together one night, staring at the ceiling, Draco mused aloud. “I’m not sure if I should continue with the Mind Healer or not.”
“And about reporting?”
Longbottom and Granger went silent, and Granger sighed. “I’d wondered if that would happen.”
“Easy! It’s just my blanket. Here, sit down.” Harry wrapped Draco in the blanket and eased him onto the bed. “What happened?” he asked again.
“Here we are,” Hermione stopped in front of a door with a gold number eight on it. “This door is not actually password protected—it knows our hands when we touch the doorknob. That way we can invite in whoever we want, as long as they have permission of one eighth-year.” She led them all inside the spacious grounds. The common room was mostly red, but had areas of each color. It had a small kitchen, plenty of seating, and board games in the corner. Window seats were adorned with pillows and had bookshelves below. The space looked lovely, but unfortunately for Draco, very open. There were few nooks and crannies in which to hide or skulk. He would have to keep to his room.
“I’m happy I ran into you up here, actually. I wanted to thank you.”
The rest of the Gryffindors smirked. “It was remarkably simple,” Hermione said. “But the point is, it’s not anymore. So we’ll need—“
“It’s just to help you breathe, but you need to calm down, Mr. Malfoy,” a gentle voice said, different from the first.
Thank you so much for your lovely comments! They help me continue writing. Let me know if you want to see anything in particular!
Harry smiled. “Me too. It just feels like it’s something that we should be doing, you know? I mean I hear Hermione and Ron talk about it...”
“You guys barely talk. How could you possibly be getting too close?” With Greg’s question, Draco forgot that the group didn’t know they slept in the same bed every night and whispered until morning.
Draco nodded, and the four sat in silence for a second. He knew now would be a good time to bring up something that had been bothering him for quite a while. “Do you—do you guys ever think about Theo? Like, wonder what’s going on, or if he’s alright?”
Draco glared at Potter. “Of course not Potter, how dense can you be?”
“Listen,” Draco leaned forward. “My parents—well, my mom at least, has told you everything she knows, I
Both boys drew their wands, even though Draco knew his would be useless. Antonin Dolohov was standing behind them, wand out, and a smirk on his face. Draco nearly collapsed to the ground—this was one of the most powerful Death Eaters who fled after Voldemort’s fall, and one of the biggest names that the Aurors hadn’t found yet. Draco certainly feared for himself, but felt a deep ache inside for the boy next to him, who had to fight evil alone yet again...
“Hi everyone. Thank you so much for getting up early to come to this meeting, I promise it won’t take too long. As Professor McGonagall said, we aren’t getting our class schedules today, that’ll come tomorrow. She wasn’t sure about year sizes, so they’re still sorting out everything. But I thought today would be a good day anyway just to get used to being back in school.”
Draco made a decision and thankfully picked up the real water glass. He took a sip, wanting to sober up as quickly as he had wanted to get drunk only a few moments ago. “Well, you wouldn’t, would you?”
Draco was about to snap at Potter for asking that but figured it was not an absurd question. Potter had saved his life yesterday, after all. Draco was both grateful and angry, but too tired to start a fight. After Harry left him alone yesterday afternoon, Draco finished his hot chocolate and went back to sleep. Blaise, Daphne, and Gregory came bursting into his room a few hours later.
Before long, it was time to say goodbye. Unfortunately the Malfoy Manor Floo had been permanently shut down shortly after Narcissa got there. They were still trying to determine how the Time Turner was stolen, so no one could go in or out without direct Ministry supervision. Draco would have to take the Hogwarts Express, where he would then be accompanied by a Ministry driver to Wiltshire.
He was out of options, as per usual, cornered by three Headmasters.
Draco wrinkled his nose in disgust. “Why would I want to visit a dead elf?”
Harry stroked Draco’s palm with his thumb as they climbed the stairs. Thankfully the hallways were mostly abandoned at this time of night. “I don’t think we need—actually, I don’t want us to have an agreement or a contract or anything. I’m no expert, but I’m not sure that’s the norm for all relationships.”
“I’m not sure if it is. I’m sure when people find out, they’ll think I coerced Harry somehow. A love potion, the Imperious Curse, something like that. Even if it did help our reputation, my father is too prideful to accept that help from someone that he hated for years and years. In his opinion, his downfall started at the end of our fifth year, when Harry went to the Ministry. He’ll never forgive Harry for that, even though he’s saved all our arses since.”
Besides the factual information, Draco also realized that though reporters such as Rita Skeeter no longer had articles in circulation, the journalists of the
“Potter, I don’t want to be in any group. I have better things to do than sit around and be criticized.”
“I don’t take glee in it, Draco. Not a bit.” They were both silent for a moment. “How would you like to honor him? Or Goyle, what does he think?”
“Alright, Narcissa,” Mr. Burke said gently. “A Ministry official will be here in a few moments to escort you back to the Manor.”
“I think the opposite,” Daphne said. “I think that the more of us go, the more believable our story is.”
“How in the bloody hell are we supposed to heal in a group if
“The questioning may commence. Narcissa Malfoy, please tell me what you did the as soon as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named fell this past May.”
“I just would hate knowing you felt guilty over it. I need you to know that I’m not angry at you in the slightest.”
“I did not mean to poison Ron,” Draco said evenly. “Nor did I mean to curse Katie Bell. Those were incredibly stupid mistakes caused by my reluctance to perform the actual task before me.”
“No matter what—I love you. I’m not going to hide from my parents anymore. Anything’s worth it, if I can be with you.” Draco didn’t even know what the
“Withholding the truth is a type of dishonesty,” Professor Dumbledore chimed in. While Draco felt pain in his heart hearing his departed teacher’s voice, he felt a pit in his stomach feeling the old Headmaster’s. “And, forgive an old portrait for being so blunt, but you look a bit ill, as you did in my last year as Headmaster.”
“Of course,” Harry said awkwardly. “I had to go through a few different ones before I settled on the perfect memory. I don’t expect you to produce anything near a full Patronus today. It took me months.”
“Of course it is,” Draco said, because it was, and also, what else was he going to say? He tossed and turned in bed, preparing himself for another sleepless night. His face was flushed with the excitement and happiness of the day, and he dozed lightly with ideas of how soft Harry’s lips would be on his.
Draco stiffed. He had nearly forgotten about his last remaining aunt. He had never spoken to her, but he remembered the Dark Lord’s jeers about him potentially watching Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks’s child. He suppressed a shudder as he tried to drag himself out of that moment. “Is she important to you?”
“I don’t want to invalidate your concerns at all, but I’ve been through quite a lot in the past few years. We all have,” he added quickly. “I really do care about Draco though. I want this to work and I’m willing to take the risks, so long as Draco is.”
Draco swallowed, feeling sick and anxious again. “He did recognize me when we were out. Mr. Burke, I mean. He said that my father was right, that I was trying to sabotage the family, and that he couldn’t trust me in a courtroom.”
Draco scoffed. “I just wonder if...if it’s the Dementors’ effect or if he...”
Harry didn’t respond for a moment, but kept rubbing his forehead. “I had a row with McGonagall.”
Draco didn’t really know what to say to that. He was beginning to feel sick.
Yarney looked to Draco who swallowed and nodded. As his father left without a backwards glance, Draco knew that the chill deep in his body wasn’t from the Dementors anymore
“I meant it, about the cup of tea. The kettle is right there,” Hermione nodded to the stovetop.
The last hour of the evening passed in silence as Draco prepared for a long night. There was no way he was going to fall asleep now, not with Potter right there to listen to his every cry and plea. Not after he had rejected Potter’s handshake. He got some rest on the train so he would be alright until the next day. That was a good plan—he would sleep during the day and do all his homework at night. Draco was sure he could find six hours during the day to sleep. Maybe he could even learn to make simple meals in the kitchen, it was good to learn domestic spells anyway—
Draco explained to her that everything was fine. He told her he was roommates with Potter but that it wasn’t so bad. He left out his attack from the Ravenclaw student and instead claimed that the other students mostly ignored him.
“Yes, but it wasn’t your fault. You have nothing to apologize for.” Blaise looked straight ahead, gritting his teeth.
"Potter." He sputtered, "I- I mean... Harry?"
"You mean having a one way ticket to be-a-Death-Eater-or-die ville-"
Draco chewed his lip, "I actually meant about giving them to you myself."
"Harry Potter, he just kissed the Hell out of you, get your sorry ass after him, damnit!"
A moment of complete, stunned silence, and then uproar.
"You're going to
"You're insane Draco."
"Hey, Weasley."
The group sat by him, but they said nothing to him, leaving him to his book. And that was how events continued for the following days, and perhaps it was their plan to make Pansy's snide suggestion become true. Nobody made conversation with the blue haired boy, but at mealtimes, and evenings in the common room, Draco could be found indulging in his library book. And around him, sat the group of Slytherin muggleborns, using a Slytherin-worthy united front against the rest of the house to support him.
"Mr. Malfoy," Snape called again when Draco was at the door, "It cannot be know to anybody else outside this room what was said, understand? I must keep up a façade that you have disappointed myself and your family. You must keep up a façade that you despise everything I stand for; perhaps as though I'm trying to force you to give up your endeavour. Do you understand?"
A forced huff of breath left Draco's lips as he closed his book. This was now the third time he had finished it. For the mot part, this was because he had really enjoyed the book, and not reading it again to find foreshadowing hidden by ignorance seemed like a crime. But there was also a small part of him that knew it was because he was scared of what he'd planned to do when he'd finished it.
"Laugh it up. Really."
He wasn't waiting long before Neville showed up, and his hair made him easily noticeable that the blonde boy spotted him immediately. He too had brought his Potions gear, and Draco was glad that Neville seemed keen to get right on with the tutoring, and the two worked at a good pace through their books, Draco explaining parts of recipes he didn't understand so he could jot notes in the margins of his notes, and showed him his own Potions books so Neville could copy the notes in his own textbook's margins.
"You're not?" Neville raised his eyebrow, and Draco couldn't say he blamed him for being skeptical.
And that seemed to be something of a trigger, though Draco couldn't pretend to be sure for what exactly. But Pansy suddenly burst into silent tears. She didn't sob, or sniffle, but tears streamed down her face, and when she spoke, her voice was breathless.
Harry was kissing him back.
Something about the way Neville said it made Draco think he was missing out on something. And suddenly, Draco was even more nervous.
"Because blonde is associated with my family, and I'd rather not be recognised as one of them, thank you very much."
The second, was Potter, which was of course no surprise to anybody, ever. Potter hadn't noticed he was being watched though. This also wasn't surprising, considering the boy was beyond oblivious to pretty much everything that went on around him. This was just common knowledge to everybody in the same year as the boy who lived, so Draco thought his chances of being caught were slim. His blue hair was not such a new thing anymore, Potter had stopped staring at that midweek. Draco had not stopped staring at him. He just found himself lucky that Granger and Weasley were so much more interested in their friend than any potential peers watching him also. No matter that he did spend the whole lesson glancing between him, and Pansy. He snapped out of it rather quickly when his classmates began packing up however, but stuck around as they began the trek up the hill from Hagrid's hut. To avoid too much suspicion, he simply acted as though he was simply packing his things away slower than usual.
No doubt his father would be looking for him, and he really had been dreadfully underprepared for this whole thing. He'd been doodling most of the early afternoon, since after finishing what little homework he had left to complete, it was all he was really able to do. He wished he'd brought a book or something, but the library was too much of a common spot for students, that it would be just his look to show up there just as his father went looking for him there. The common room was absolutely out of the question of course, and it was a shame too, because he was sure he had all sorts of things in his trunk that would ease his boredom. He couldn't even meet Pansy anywhere, because should his father follow her, it was a direct path to him. It was honestly quite frustrating.
He had to do it now.
Draco thought it was funny. How, if people had questions about someone - or for someone - they would never go to the person who could provide the most effective answers; the people said questions concerned. They would instead ask others, and take their guesswork, or partial answers as complete. By lunch, Draco wanted to scream. Yell that he'd be happy to answer any and questions, so long as they went to him first. So long as they believed the answers he would give. That was an entirely new request altogether however.
"Merlin, don't be such a prat." Draco hissed to himself, tugging frustratedly at his hair.
"Look, I'm not sat here to torment you."
Draco sighed, "Well, thank Merlin for that."
Draco always took care of his books. It was almost funny how many people thought that because he was rich enough to replace a book if it got so much as a crease, that he didn't think he needed to respect them. Those people couldn't be more wrong. True, a lot of his books were worn, but in the well-loved way, not because he hadn't looked after them. In fact, in all his life, there was only one book he'd ever purposefully vandalised, but it had been for a good cause.
"Thank me?" Draco cocked his head.
"I just wanted to say, about anything I said before about my dad-"
Draco had to admit it, it had shocked him at first. He knew Granger enjoyed reading, but for the longest time had thought her only to be interested in non-fiction books, for informational purposes only. It was a stereotypical assumption, sure, but he knew even her fellow Gryffindors would have similar ones. But he guessed he also had to thank this revelation, because without it, he wouldn't have come up with this extra plan that theoretically would make his end goal's success considerably more likely. It was just how to go about it that had him stumped. Granger was always with Potter and Weasley. He couldn't very well just go up to her and strike up a conversation with them there. It would not only look suspicious, but also likely end with a curse sent his way by Weasley before he'd even got a sentence out.
"Exactly. Look, it's not that I want the attention like that, I don't. I'd actually much prefer this part of the plan if I could do it without drawing attention to it, but it wouldn't work at all that way. Especially since," he pulled a crumpled letter out of his robes, "My dead father is coming to Hogwarts. He'll be on the staff table tomorrow evening."
Because Draco's placement had not been accidental in the slightest, and either Neville had suspected this, or was simply just rather terrified of him. Draco wasn't sure which, and not sure he cared, because his goal was to change that by the end of the lesson anyway. He let Neville fumble through the note taking, and collect the ingredients, quite clumsily under Snape's scrutinizing gaze, but before Neville could even bring the cauldron to a boil, the Slytherin stopped him.
And with that she turned to enter the Great Hall, and Draco turned, smile on face, to go back over to sit beside Pansy on the staircase outside.
Draco really had thought that he'd prepared himself for every outcome. But as it turned out, nothing could quite have prepared him to see his father kept in his seat by a firm hand on his shoulder, and another Ministry Official stood behind his seat, obviously saying something, but nothing that Draco could make out. He had a couple good guesses though, when his father suddenly was on his feet,, hand still on his shoulder, and with a glare in Draco's general direction, was lead from the hall. Everything was silent now, or maybe it wasn't, but Draco could only hear the ringing in his ears, and wasn't quite sure what everybody's attention was on now. Him? His father? Or maybe just the situation as a whole. But whatever it was, Draco was paying little attention to that, and more on the fact that he was feeling rather unsteady, as though he would topple at any moment.
"I knew you'd been different lately. You know... the hair, the defiance with Snape, the muggleborns. That sort of thing. But I didn't realise-"
"As far as I'm concerned, Malfoy-"
Slowly, the two calmed, and their conservation became more like those that usually occurred at 3am, and as tears dried, smiles widened and before long the two were laughing and giggling, and joking around as before. It was 4am before either thought sleep would be a good idea, and Draco made a point of hugging Pansy tightly before they headed towards their respective dorms.
"Yeah, of course. It'd be my pleasure. Any times specifically? I can do pretty much any time, any day that isn't class or after curfew."
“Oh Draco. One last thing?”
"Mr. Malfoy," a voice drawled, and Draco sighed.
Snape visibly relaxed.
“I assume you're aware that you stink of shit.”
That, of course, had been his first mistake. Being born at all. Or, at least, being born a Malfoy. But he had to admit that wasn't his fault. His fault laid within every moment since Potter rejected his handshake. Potter wasn't to blame; he was. God, he could see that now. He had been a bratty, prejudice, racist child, who's parents had been known to work for the wizard who killed his, and he'd had the audacity to ask Potter to be his friend, while insulting another entire family at the same time. And one that had shown Potter kindness at that. Really, what had he been expecting? If only he'd been nicer, to both Potter, and Weasley for that matter.
"And Quidditch? What's next Draco? Hanging out with mudbloods?"
“Yeah.” Draco wet his lips, and tried to ignore the dryness of his throat, “I've never been very pleasant to most people, and you really got a lot of that. A lot of what I did was frankly brutal. I never should have condemned your Hippogriff like I did. I should have admitted that I made a mistake, I shouldn't have insulted it.”
Draco had to wait for a few days before he could really do anything else, but most of him didn't really care much. He thought a few days off would do him good. He already had a lot to deal with with everything else he'd done so far. Professor Snape was still giving him Hell in Potions, and he'd hit more than a few nerves over the course of the week. He'd dealt with even more unannounced charms sent his way trying to understand why his hair was still blue, until finally, someone had put a halt to it by outing the (correct) rumour that he'd used muggle hair dye. After that, he just got wisps of unbelieving conversations that Draco Malfoy would ever touch anything muggle with a stick, let alone permanently alter his hair colour using muggle inventions. It was everything Draco had not to scream in frustration, like it was so hard to believe that through all these changes people were still hooked on his act against muggles and anything less than pure blood. It pissed him off the say the least, and if only to stop him lashing out, he'd begun a list of muggle inventions that he figured the wizarding world should take some inspiration from. He didn't intend to show anyone, but it put his mind at ease.
He went to hurry off, but Draco stopped him.
None of this, of course, was said aloud. In fact, Draco pretended he hadn't heard them at all. Why cause more trouble? Besides, ha had enough of thag coming his way tonight when he went to see his godfather, who would surely have a lot to say. Draco hadn't even bothered to plan an excuse. What was the point? Snape would find a way to debunk it all. He wasn't actually sure which bothered him more. The fact that Snape seemed to be the only Professor bothered, or the fact that some of the Professors seemed to even appreciate his sudden change of demeanour literally overnight. But it wasn't anything particularly unexpected. He'd known from the beginning that this was going to be tough. Now it was just being proven.
"Well, for one, that not all Malfoys are walking stereotypes, and that some might actually want to change and mean it," Hermione nodded to him with a wider smile, so he turned his attention pointedly at Ron, "While some, like my Father for example, are worse than you could imagine, and just so happen to keep a stash of dark objects under the library in Malfoy manor. A stash that if someone - let's say, a Ministry worker - found, would get him into a lot of trouble."
"Really? I-I mean... okay! So, when do you want to start?"
The next morning, at breakfast, Draco was left alone by his former frends when he took a seat at the very end of the table, picking at his food as he continued with his book. He paused in his reading when a few figures stopped beside him, and looked up, preparing to snap. He stopped when he saw that the group was small, the pupils in it belonging to various years, but all sporting silver and green. Draco recognised them as the muggleborns who usually attempted to avoid the attention of those like Draco Malfoy.
He even added a whistle to piss Flint off more. And it was safe to say it worked.
In the ruckus, Draco managed to catch sight of Potter, who was hovering a little way away from the rest of his team, but clapping politely too. Draco couldn't help it, and shot him a huge grin, holding the snitch towards him in a way that not even oblivious Potter could mistake for being boastful. The Gryffindor gave a soft smile in return - one that looked truly genuine - and nodded to him. Draco grinned wider.
"I'm sorry." he apologised sheepishly.
"Actually, I was expected a lot worse," he laughed, and Neville joined in.
Draco laughed a little louder, "Well, first off because he'd a bit of a dick. But mainly because I don't need him lecturing me before dinner, because I'm kind of going to give him something else to worry about."
"How do you know all these little tips? And why do you write in the books, Hermione would go ballistic."
However.
"Draco." the blonde interrupted, his tone soft, but holding conviction.
Neville looked confused for a second before coming over to sit beside him, and setting his books to the side.
"Okay." Neville nodded, then with a small, unsure sort of smile, he headed off.
Draco snapped his book shut, and stood, making Pansy jump. Turning to face her, grey eyes glaring, Draco couldn't help the anger burning bright and deep in his chest. How in Merlin's name had he managed to keep his sanity, spending so much time around her?
“What's that?” the student asked.
"Do what you need to do Draco. I'll do what I need to do. But watch yourself - there is something so much bigger going on here, but I can' t- and frankly won't - stop you."
"Enter."
Maybe it was, but it was also true.
"What is your problem?" he fumed, his face as red as his hair.
"Is it too much?"
"I assume you'll be wanting this."
It was politely asked, or at least an attempted politeness. Hagrid looked incredibly confused at first but, then just nodded, waiting for the blue haired boy to speak again.
"Nope... I figure I'm safe so long as he doesn't slap me... right?"
Draco bit his lip. This time, holding back what he wanted to say would be an insult to his entire reasoning. What could Snape do anyway? Tell his father? Well, good.
Ron's face softened again, and he almost sighed, giving a small smile that Draco almost thought was a trick his eyes were playing on him.
I'm so sorry that it's so short but I'm uh, drunk and I have other stuff I need to write. I hope you enjoy it anyway though. My plan in spent now, so if you guys have any ideas on how you want this to carry on, I'm open to ideas. Otherwise it may just be something random to finish it up you know? So let me know of anything you may want. As always, I hope you enjoyed!
It was mostly empty, but what was the strangest thing, was Pansy Parkinson. Not that she was particularly strange in herself, but that she was sat on the sofa that Draco and the muggleborns had adopted. Again, not exactly too strange in itself, only… the muggleborns were still they. And the lot of them were talking… in a civilised manner.
Thankfully, he didnt have to worry about information on basiliks now. In fact, the book he was reading wasn't informational at all. It was mere fiction; a good choice for what he had hoped to be a relaxing evening. That, of course, was not what he got.
"I disagree-"
"I say we stick to after classes until dinner. If that's okay?"
"Because he is one-"
"I don't strive to cause many theatrics here, Malfoy, but are you really foolish enough to think I could let this," he gestured in borderline disgust to Draco's hair, "slide?"
"Yeah, since first year. You were there. The alternative is just-" he shook his head, "did I- did I succeed?" he held out his hand for Harry to potentially shake.
"It's because they're here isn't it?" Draco subtly pointed to the trio with a nod of his head.
"Yeah..." he admitted. "I told them not to come. It was Ron more than the other two. He was concerned that you couldn't have actually been the reason I've been doing so good in Potions lately because you're-" he reddened and shut up abruptly.
"My office," Snape snarled, "eight thirty. Don't be late and anger me more."
The Slytherins alone managed to cheer over the polite cheering from the other houses. Draco was crowded by his teammates, who tugged at his robes, ruffled his hair, knocking him this way and that in their overwhelming excitement.
The lesson was a light one. Meaning, by Draco's standards, not much happened, and he could relax and not have to worry about potentially getting killed. And while Bowtruckles could surely be dangerous if you threatened their tree, Draco figured just standing there would grant him safety. This helped, because he found himself paying such little attention that anything much bigger than the bowtruckles would kill him easily.
"-and it's in your best interests-"
Draco had been so disinterested by the date the following day, even Pansy's joke about him being madly in love with her now was lost on him, and any joke following for the next three days in fact. And then, in the middle of the night during one of their 3am conversations, Draco had blurted out that 'actually blokes are rather a lot nicer than girls' and that had only brought them closer.
"What about?" Draco didn't even look up.
But he had to stop crying. He didn't want this stuff going in his eyes...
"What do you want?"
here was the apparent mystery. But right now, that was not his main issue, and the longer he stayed hovering by the entrance of the Great Hall, the more people were turning to look at him, and it wasn't the most pleasant feeling, having most of the eyes in the room trained on you, so with another forced breath, Draco put his plan into action.
"Well, I thought-"
"Okay. Okay, okay. But you should probably go in. Like now, and I'll follow in a minute."
Draco nodded absentmindedly, "Alright. Then how about right after classes, we meet in the library? That'll give us more time than if we did it after dinner, and-"
"Of course!" Draco replied cheerily, before walking away towards the changing rooms.
In the next Potions class that Draco had with the Gryffindors, Draco 'accidentally' found himself in the last remaining empty seat, which happened to be next to Neville Longbottom. They were revisiting how to make a potion that Draco was particularly practiced in making, while Neville... not so much. If Draco remembered correctly, the last time they had tried this, Neville's potion was amongst the worst, with disastrous results with lasting effects.
Snape was quiet for a moment, his dark eyes trained pointedly at Draco, who stood strong, his grey eyes blazing with anger, glaring back at him.
"Neville..." he began stopping by the wall, so people could, and would pass.
In truth, he felt pretty pathetic, the way he was holding himself, like he was broken; or how there seemed to be more tears on his cheeks than droplets from the shower water. How the shower was hot, burning his skin, turning his pasty Malfoy complexion a blotchy red, but he was filled with so much self-hatred, that he left it, absent-mindedly assuming he deserved it anyway. How he couldn't clear his mind of the memories of everything he'd ever done wrong from the moment of his birth.
"I'm sorry." Harry reddened, "I'm sorry, I-"
"-do you really think it wise to leave behind the protection you have simply by having the name Malfoy-"
"You kissed me." Harry said, and Draco almost burst out laughing at the sheer obvious nature of the statement.
"Obviously."
The nerve of some people.
"That's not-"
“I came to… well. I know it won't exactly mean much, and I completely understand if it means absolutely nothing to you but… I came to apologise.”
"Well why don't you be polite, and tell me what, in Merlin's name, have you done to your hair?"
"-and you would do well to appreciate that. You're putting your entire worth on the line here-"
"I don't have a problem."
"I don't really care if people are still confused. You are different."
"-just because of teenage angst? He'd have you killed, or your family killed, and you know he isn't against that. Lucius Malfoy is seen as a coward as it is already-"
If she remained how she'd always been, then he was fine by that.
"You have no choice which family you belong to Mr. Malfoy, whether you want one or not-"
Draco's next plan was truly heartbreaking. He almost didn't want to do it. But he knew he had to.
"Especially then."
Neville thought for a moment, and it only made Draco more nervous.
"Shit," he cursed, reddening slightly, "I'm sorry, I totally forgot."
Pansy didn't say anything, or move few a moments, and though Draco wasn't looking at her, he could tell she was looking at him. He could feel her eyes on him, scanning him for any sign that he might be preparing to split, and pretend he'd never come up with this plan in the first place. But if Pansy really thought nerves would stop him from this opportunity he'd presented himself with, then he could gurantee she had zoned out during his lovesick rambles.
"Certainly." Draco replied blankly.
"You're joking," Neville spluttered, "This isn't some horrible joke?"
"I'll take your word for it. Look, what are we even doing here right now? We could be eating."
"I was wondering... without sounding too much like... well, me. I'm rather a lot better at potions than you-" Neville blushed with embarrassment at that, "-and I didn't know if maybe you think you would benefit from tutoring?"
Draco made a point of being anywhere but the obvious places when he heard news that his father had arrived to Hogwarts the next day. He had sent an owl to his mother than morning, and gotten a rather swift reply, reassuring him that she would be out of the manor when the ministry officials arrived to search the premisis. After that it was just a case of waiting. But he didn't want to see his father. No doubt he would have some lecture prepared, and right now, it wouldn't matter in Lucius Malfoy's head if he had to wait until after dinner, because he was in the dark with everything regarding Draco's plans. He just had to make it until then. After that, it would be fine because whatever he had to say right now would be replaced in the light of what he would do. Besides, if all went well, Lucius wouldn't have much time after that before the ministry came for him. And Narcissa had already told Draco that she would happily expose what she knew should the ministry ask her about the dark artifacts they would no doubt find soon enough. Draco had smiled at that; he couldn't help it. He would stand by his mother.
"Evening, Professor." Draco greeted as he entered the Potion Master's office.
Draco resisted a shrug but gave back an equally obvious response.
Malfoys might not cry, but Draco did, and it took rather a lot of effort to wipe his eyes without drawing attention to himself. Being Care of Magical Creatures, he could have blamed it on that, but he didn't have the heart to lie right now.
Thankfully, when Draco finally stopped, the wave of nausea stopped, and he didn't have to worry about throwing up all up in the corridor. But it was in this moment that he realised that while the shock of his father being taken away had been a sudden crashing feeling weighing on him, he couldn't bring himself to regret it. Did that make him a bad person? After everything he'd done to try and be a better person, and change who everybody thought he was, was it now ruined because he wasn't feeling guilty for condemning his father? Shouldn't he have felt bad? Shouldn't good people feel guilty for another's unfortunate fate, even if they maybe deserved said fate? He wasn't sure, but the fact of the matter just happened to be that he couldn't change it. That was it, and everything was over now. He had no other specific people he wanted to change the opinions of in regards to him, and he had seen the end to his ideas, without getting slapped, but now he had no idea what he was supposed to do.
At eight twenty-nine that evening, Draco raised his fist to the door to Severus Snape's office, knocking loudly, and wishing for nothing more than  to sink into the floor.
"I know but-"
Neville didn't meet his eyes, "Because you're 'racist scum' and 'too much of a git to be so helpful to anyone.' I told him it wasn't true, that you're actually nicer than even the rumours have been saying, and that it really is thanks to you that I'm not so awful anymore. What he said wasn't fair."
Pansy scowled and plonked down on the sofa, but as far as possible away from him.
Salvation came to him in the unlikely form of Neville Longbottom, carrying with him numerous books, and looking quite ruffled.
Could he call him that? He had called him Draco but... he wasn't sure if it was a two way sort of thing at this point? He had just very randomly kissed him.
know?"
He raised his hands, "You don't have to say yes. I get that it might be a bit too soon for you to actually trust anything I have to say. I just thought that if I suggested it, y'know, the offer would be there and you-"
"Well, if you need the practise again..." Pansy waggled her eyebrows.
"And what's that?"
Then, with a slight skip in his step, Draco noticed, Ron headed off into the Great Hall, Hermione at his heels, snickering under her breath. But once again, Harry stuck behind, and this time Draco leant back nonchalantly on the steps, radiating the same vibes as Pansy - confidence.
“Ah… That would be uh…”
Draco nodded again, "Yeah, I guess. We don't really talk to each other, but- and they do it in our common room too."
Oh shit... was this the moment he'd get that frankly rather deserved slap?
The whimsical blonde turned, offering a dreamy smile as Draco dug in his pockets.
"Why?"
"I want to." he returned, taking the tabloid, and pressing the coins into her palm.
Draco plastered on a wide, hopefully patronising grin, and turned on the bench to look up at his Head of House.
His gaze flickered between two spots continuously. Or rather, two people. The first of course being Pansy, who looked about as miserable as he did, staring into space or watching her bowtruckle with a sort of empty fascination, as though she might have found them extremely interesting had it not been for the metaphorical grey cloud that seemed to stretch and hang above the two of them. Maybe if it rained, things wouldn't look so bleak, but Draco wasn't really in the mood to summon actual temporary storm clouds. He didn't need any more attention on him, and not from Pansy. He didn't want to make anything any worse.
Draco shrugged, "Just a hunch."
He stalked forward, away from his own house's table, and instead walking down the length of the Gryffindor table, trying to ignore the gazes boring into him. He moved down the table until he reached where the trio sat, and turning anxiety into adrenaline, Draco didn't miss a beat, stopping right beside the boy who lived, gripping fistfuls of his robes, pulled him up high enough for Draco to engage him in a searing kiss.
"I appreciate you giving us the chance though. We- or more, I didn't really do much to deserve it."
Soon, their time in the library also became time for them to complete their homework, which they mainly did individually, but would often talk about various topics as they worked. Overall, it was rather a nice atmosphere, and Draco all but cried in joy when Neville quietly admitted that he was starting to think of Draco as a friend, and was so incredibly grateful for the help.
“‘Course not. Do you have another shovel?”
"But that's where one of them dies."
Through his thinking, Draco almost managed to miss the perfect opportunity that presented itself to him, in the form of Granger leaving the Great Hall without Potter and Weasley flanking her. Draco waited anxiously for a few moments, before grabbing his thinks and following her, though being sure to make his pace leisurely so as not to make it obvious that that was what he was doing. He had to admit she walked fast though. Once out of the Hall he had to speed up considerably to catch up. Amazingly, the Gryffindor didn't hear him coming, until his footfells fell in time with hers beside her. She almost tripped in shock.
Harry couldn't help but laugh at that one, but went redder when he remembered Draco was still there.
Then, one breakfast - still surrounded by the muggleborns - Draco cracked the book open again dejectedly, absent-mindedly wondering if it would work to write a note and leave it in the book for Granger to find. But he figured that relied too much on luck and routine. For one, just because Granger took the book out so frequently, didn't mean somebody else wouldn't take it out after him before she had the chance. For another, Madam Pince might find the note and dispose of it. The plan was not a good one.
The point was, it was a very good thing that nobody had caught him.
"That definitely explains it," Neville mumbled.
"Apparently so."
He came across nobody on his way back to the Slytherin common room, as dinner had not long since finished, most would already be back. Draco couldn't even bring himself to be disappointed that he'd missed dinner, because I'm truth he didn't really feel all that hungry. Or maybe it was just the fear that if he ate, the stench he'd endured for the last few hours really would make him puke. Either way, Draco wasn't upset, and was still smiling to himself when he entered the common room.
"You really mean that?"
"No! No, that's awful! I would never."
"You've literally never forgotten this, it was your idea. What's wrong?"
"Not every asshole is an irredeemable jerk. You should go catch up with those two."
"We could be. But I need to talk to someone."
A first year coloured in the cheeks as he shyly added, "I didn't get bothered even once by the purebloods in my dorm after you did that."
"Whenever really... might be nice to get something in before our next lesson though."
And maybe Draco had to shrink the shovel slightly. And maybe the mystery dung smelled worse than he had originally thought it could have done. And maybe conversation was either awkward or nonexistent at first. But once the two had become accustomed to the slight weirdness and awkwardness of who it was they were sharing the vicinity with, the atmosphere relaxed, and the two were on comfortable enough terms to engage in small talk and speaking about their days to one another, and the job at hand didn't take the age that Draco had dreaded - just perhaps a few too many hours. And you got used to the smell.
"I should probably go too." Neville trailed.
When their team's final practise session finally rolled round, Draco was more sure about his plan than ever. He feigned zoning out. He purposefully missed the snitch when it was right in front of his nose. He even pretended to lose his balance on his broom a few times. He could see his team growing increasingly more pissed off with him, and he had to try really hard not to laugh. Once training finished, Draco pretended to try and slip off with the rest of the team, and pretended to be disappointed when Flint caught him.
He'd heard a few whispers. Why had a Malfoy dyed his hair? Why blue? Was that intentional? Well thought out? Or just a random colour choice? Was he rebellion, and how serious of a rebellion was it? He'd heard a couple of seventh years on his way of the great hall after lunch. They were Ravenclaws, and he couldn't help but dislike them as soon as be heard them questioning each other in hushed voices on why the colour wasn't coming out when exposed to certain counter-charms. Draco seethed quietly to himself that they had no right to subject him to any magic without his consent, and the fact that they had tried to do as much proved that it had been a smart choice to use muggle hair dye. It had been easy to obtain, fairly easy to do, and saved him from the hassle of dealing with stupid Ravenclaw students, who apparently thought it was perfectly okay to mess with his personal choices, even if it meant violating him magically.
"We need to talk."
They worked right up until dinner, and Neville didn't seem as eager to rush off as Draco had imagined.
The two laughed for a moment before silence fell, and the Gryffindor seemed to realise again who she was talking to. Her smile faded, though didn't completely disappear, and Draco was thankful for that.
"Draco? You weren't at the library."
Draco shook his head, "No, I mean it."
But first he had to get through this day.
"Professor." He greeted silkily.
"Well, that's what-"
“Hm?” Draco raised his eyebrows.
Taking a deep breath, and steeling himself for the stares he was going to get, Draco ruffled his hair, shook himself a little, then reluctantly approached the great hall.
"You like him don't you?"
Pansy turned at the last moment.
After classes, and a quick farewell to Pansy, Draco made his way to the library, after a pit stop to his dorm to pick up anything related to Potions he thought could be useful at all. There would also be a whole range of books at their disposal in the library. He thought that maybe it was weird that he was excited about this, but he couldn't help it. If all went how it should, then this would mean one more person with the knowledge of what he was doing, and why. And maybe Neville, being a Gryffindor himself, would be a big enough step that it finally wouldn't be seen as a trick or a temporary thing. That's what he hoped at least.
“Sorry, yeah, go on.”
That wasn’t to say he wasn’t lonely at times. Of course he was. But he was more than familiar with the feeling; it was almost a part of who he was by this point. It was exceptionally lonely—being Draco Malfoy.
Potter how he felt, how much he cared. He kissed Potter gently, not allowing him to rush. Potter tasted of cigarettes and something sour and sweet, like blood oranges and cinnamon. He kissed Potter until he moaned, until his knees buckled. It was the only bit of control he could have, here in these moments. He unfastened Potter’s robes and tugged him towards the bedroom, sensing the impatience in the other man.
flag.”
but it was hard to practice when there was always a meal ready for him in the kitchen. He kept telling himself he’d have a word with Polkey about it, but a part of him was far too selfish to give up these delicious meals for his own dismal cooking.
“What about you?” he asked, instead.
Harry went to the next Quidditch match with Ron. It was Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff, and Ron’s face had completely lit up when Harry had suggested they go together at breakfast.
He looked up, and for a split second, his face looked open and relaxed and Harry’s chest ached. But then he made eye contact with Harry, and his face closed up; his lips tightened and his eyes narrowed, and Harry felt horribly guilty, though for what, he didn’t know.
Harry shifted slightly in his seat. He still wasn’t very comfortable saying he was in any way more advanced than his fellow students. He knew he could perform some spellwork better than most, but he hadn’t really done much for it.
“Oh no, I’ll still need far more instruction,” Draco said, watching as Gryffindor lost the Quaffle to Ravenclaw Chaser Stewart Ackerley and Potter cursed under his breath. “Wandlore is no simple art. I’ll continue to apprentice under Ollivander in his shop until he believes I am ready to take over.”
All of his friends were walking on eggshells around him, as though anything might set him off. He wanted to be angry, but after what he did to Ron, all he could feel was guilt.
“Hey, Harry, I almost forgot, do you wanna come to Hogsmeade with me this weekend?” asked Ron, as he began loading his plate with seconds.
Lost in his thoughts, Harry didn’t even realise he had made it to his destination until he was stood right in front of the door. He clenched and unclenched his fists a few times, trying to shake the nervous energy out. He remembered what Hermione said, about him and Draco overcoming their hatred of each other to become friends. He took a deep breath and entered the café.
Harry watched curiously as the boggart formed into a wedding dress, that floated ominously towards Daphne. She made no moves to indicate that she was frightened at all—Harry supposed that the wedding dress was more symbolic of her fear, the way Remus’s full moon had been—and clenched her jaw before uttering,
Draco braced himself, but he felt nothing as the spell washed over him.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Just a long day, I guess.”
“Potter,” Draco said, in a clipped tone. He was standing up straight, his hands tucked into the pockets of his robes.
“Why?” Harry had asked. “Why would he care so much to hide his thoughts from me?”
“I didn’t even say anything!” Harry exclaimed, defensively, looking at Ron for backup.
A long period of silence followed Potter’s words, with neither one of the boys knowing where to go from there. This was the trouble with talking about the war. It wasn’t as though there weren’t plenty of horrific things they could talk about, it was that neither one knew what could set the other off. What was an untouchable topic? Draco often felt like it was all taboo. He was reminded every day of the many wrong decisions he had made in his past, the mistakes he had made, and the cruel and incorrect beliefs he’d held for far too long to blame solely on his father’s misleading guidance.
Potter looked at him.
Harry stifled a laugh, instead tangling his dirty fingers into Draco’s soft hair and gently pulling until Draco was standing on his feet. When Draco opened his mouth to protest, Harry pulled him into a kiss, revelling in the way Draco just melted against him, licking into his mouth and biting gently at his bottom lip.
Suddenly, Pansy was here (and
“Well,” Draco paused, wondering for a moment how he ended up in this kind of conversation with Harry Potter of all people. “Sometimes I wonder if he’s really gone for good this time. Sometimes I expect him to just show up out of nowhere. Sometimes it’s impossible to fall asleep at night because I see him every time I close my eyes.”
Draco looked up at her and saw her eyebrows furrowed and a look of something determined in her eyes. At a loss, Draco simply nodded and turned to follow Theo, who had found a table for them to sit at.
He cast a dirty look at Wilkins and walked off. Harry looked at her again and saw that tears had begun to slide down her face.
“Some of us have jobs, you know,” Draco jumped in. He always forgot how fun it was to wind each other up the way they did, especially with Blaise. It was almost a game to them.
They sat together in silence for a moment before Draco returned to the topic at hand.
seared into his forearm. He had wanted to argue, but he’d recognized that look on her face, that look that clearly said nothing on earth could change her mind.
Harry shrugged again, and Malfoy eyed him, as though trying to figure out what he was thinking.
“They’re Death Eaters,” said a Ravenclaw girl, coldly, which stopped all murmurings immediately, and wiped the smile off Greengrass’s face.
“Well-spotted, Weasley.”
She hooted happily and flew off. Draco looked over a Theo, who had finally pulled his present loose from its wrapping. He was looking at it with great interest, but Draco couldn’t see properly over all the dishes in the way.
"You know, like Harry says, the war's over and it's time to move on and all that." Weasley awkwardly grabbed fistfuls of his own robes as his hands looked anxiously for something to do.
to show up to class and
Harry found himself rather nervous as he walked with Ron and Hermione towards their first Defence class.
And yet, here he was. He had entrusted Violet, Luna, Theo, Daphne, and now
“Because if you faint on me, I don’t think Slughorn will give us any more points for this potion, and frankly, it deserves at least twenty more for Slytherin.”
“Have you tried to stop it happening?”
“Don’t look so terrified,” said Demelza. “You’ve survived worse.”
“An excellent ex-boyfriend,” chimed in Ginny, with a cheeky grin.
“Of course we are, Harry, why wouldn’t we be?”
Potter let out a sigh and ran his fingers through his hair, leaving it even messier than it already was, which Draco hadn’t thought was possible.
Ginny narrowed her eyes at him.
She blinked at him, his question clearly unexpected.
Harry had never been the biggest fan of Herbology, but he found that he rather enjoyed gardening. He had some beautiful flowers that filled the air with a lovely, gentle scent, and some fresh vegetables that tasted far better than their store-bought counterparts.
Draco set aside his quill and looked down at his list. Considering he had been working on it for an hour, it was rather short.
“Are you saying you agree with Malfoy? Malfoy?”
an afterwards.
Waya gave him that look again, that made Harry feel as if he were about to be the victim of a Legilimens.
“How did you know it was about him?”
“You don’t suppose we could…I dunno, call a truce? Try and be mates?”
He slowly made his way up towards the path to the castle, but he stopped suddenly, surprised to see a group of unfamiliar people huddled a few feet away from the locker rooms. It took a few moments before he realized that they must be the recruiters Ginny was talking about. He felt a surge of nervous excitement for her.
“That’s great, Harry!” Hermione said, leaning into his side and squeezing his arm.
Theodore tilted his head and looked at him, curiously. His deep brown eyes betrayed a hint of something that looked akin to pity. Under normal circumstances, Draco would’ve shut that down in a second with a sneer and a derisive comment, however at the moment, he was far too grateful to have a somewhat friendly face around, so he refrained from the urge to immediately push him away.
The photographer was another surprise—the familiar face of Dennis Creevey grinned up at him from behind the camera.
“Tomorrow,” he said, firmly. “And then I’m quitting my job.”
“Working together? Is that what you call it, Potter?”
“For the record, no, there were no scars,”—this was a lie, but he didn’t feel like watching Potter drown himself in guilt and self-pity—“and you do not owe me an apology, seeing as I was about to cast an Unforgivable on you.”
hello friends! sorry about the long wait - as this story is sort of coming to a close, I've been avoiding writing it because I dont want it to endddddd haha. but don't worry, the sequel will be coming shortly as well. this ended up being more of a character study than a real romance, but there is some drarry coming up PLUS the sequel is going to be much more heavily focused on their relationship. I worked hard on making this seem like a realistic continuation of the series more than anything else. anyway I'm rambling. enjoy the chapter!
“What do they do?” he asked. “The Mind Healers. Is there a spell? A potion you take?”
“Theo?” he said, gently. “It’s just me.”
Harry shrugged.
“What do I
It was a week later, when they took their usual walk from Ollivanders to the Apparition point on Carkitt Market, and Nathaniel had been turning to leave, when Draco had stopped him.
what he had cooked.
“I know you’ve had some practice teaching, in your fifth year, with Dumbledore’s Army. I think it would be beneficial for you to do some more of that.”
“Who else is going? Other seventh years, yeah?” Ron asked.
“Nothing,” Harry said. “Nothing changed, except…Ollivander died and I-I saw his name in the paper…and Bill and Fleur are having a baby, and I just thought…I don’t know. I don’t know. I just…I wanted to see him.”
He quickly folded up the letter and gave Violet a small smile.
“Oh,” she mumbled, quickly wiping her face with the palm of her hand. “Draco, I’m sorry, I didn’t think anyone would be here.”
“Blimey,” Hagrid muttered, looking at Draco like he’d grown a second head. “Alrigh’, then, yeh can help me feed ‘em.”
“Are you and Ron alright, Hermione?” he asked, watching her from his armchair. Hermione’s quill didn’t pause for a second, and she didn’t look up from her parchment.
But there were other times when Harry wasn’t sure how much he could say or what was okay to mention. He and Draco had never had a proper conversation about boundaries, about what was an acceptable topic. Whenever the subject of the war was brought up, the conversation shifted, often into one that was dark or miserable, and Harry could feel that they both became somewhat tentative, choosing their words carefully.
“It was a difficult time,” he said, truthfully. “I was going through a lot. It’s part of why I’m taking less hours now, I’m trying to teach myself that it’s okay not to be working all the time, not to be constantly busy.”
“And you, Mr Malfoy?” Slughorn was saying, and Draco’s attention was brought back to the intoxicating steam rising from the pearlescent potion.
“Alright,” said Draco, his heart battering against his chest. “Alright.”
“No need for apologies, young Draco. You have been gifted with a glorious second chance here, and it would be wasteful to spend your time punishing yourself for past mistakes. It is up to you, Draco, what you choose to do with those mistakes: repeat them, or learn from them.”
“My friend, Violet, takes Muggle Studies,” he said, “and she was telling me about how Muggles often intuitively recognize signs of magic, even if they don’t necessarily understand that it’s magic they’ve recognizing. It’s something the Wizard-Muggle Relations office is constantly trying to better understand. So I thought, instead of magical creatures and artefacts, would it be possible to use cores that have magical qualities but are visible and accessible to Muggles as well?”
“Don’t think I could get a word, do you?” Macmillan asked, a quill materializing in his hand.
Draco paused.
They ate quietly, however the silence seemed to morph from something awkward to something more companionable as they chewed their pastries and sipped their tea.
“Transfiguration is a popular N.E.W.T. subject, though,” provided Hermione.
There was something rather Slytherin about that.
He heard a sigh and then the curtain was pulled to the side to reveal Theo, blinking up at him.
For a desperate moment, he had even tried Occlumency, racking his brain to try and remember what Snape had taught him three years prior, but then he reminded himself that even if he wasn’t rubbish at Occlumency—which he definitely was—it was intended to block Legilimency, not real nightmares.
but Hermione didn’t let him get another word in, savagely stabbing her toast with a jam-covered knife now, “but I didn’t. I’m also in your Transfiguration class, as well as double Potions, and then I have Arithmancy, double Charms, and Care of Magical Creatures.”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded slowly, wondering what that had to do with anything.
Until suddenly he paused. Harry watched as his back stiffened and he cast a quick glance around the room.
Harry wanted desperately to question his little slip-up there, but he was speaking at such a rapid pace, Harry couldn’t get a word in.
Ron’s delighted glee when he actually beat Hermione in a duel. Luna declaring,
“Er…what?” said Harry, too confused to answer properly. Since when did he and Malfoy share secrets?
Draco couldn’t help but be taken aback. How did he know it was about…except
“Now just wait until it starts to turn a dark orange and do the final stirring routine.”
directly at his own window. Stumbling out of bed, he shooed the owl away, refusing to even let it in.
He’d seen far too many horrific things during the war to justify his fear in these typically peaceful creatures, but there was something about them that just gnawed at his gut. Their pupil-less eyes, milky white and round, seemed to stare into one’s very soul, and Draco found himself with his own eyes firmly focused on the ground.
“Wandless and non-verbal?” Draco rolled his eyes so hard he could feel it in his head. “Merlin and Salazar, and you wonder why I hated you for seven years, you can just do bloody everything, can’t you?”
He had tried out only two wands before he started losing patience. After the first two—“vine wood with Veela hair, vivacious, quite bendy!” and “pine and kelpie mane, very strong!”—had resulted in rather loud explosions of a coat hanger and a window, Draco had decided he’d rather get this over with quickly before someone walked in and saw a Malfoy exploding things.
“She’s gonna kill herself taking all those classes,” he said, shaking his head in disbelief. “You’d think she’d have learned her lesson after third year and that whole mess with the time-turner, but no.”
“I know. I think what your mum is doing is great, trying to get rid of any remaining Dark Magic is smart. But I think that when it comes to memories, it might make sense to just…create new ones.”
Harry tried to relax his body and decided to sit down right there in the grass. Without realising it, his face had split into a smile. No, it certainly didn’t hurt.
“What the fuck did you do?” he mumbled to himself.
He didn’t know if it could
Potter sighed, finally turning away from the snake and looking at Draco, his expression almost imploring.
“Of course, my boy, no trouble at all. Why don’t we keep in contact and you can let me know once you have more information? I understand you have an owl?”
“I had my first meeting with Ollivander last night,” he said in a low voice. After a lot of deliberation, he had decided that Violet was going to be the one person he told about the true nature of his apprenticeship. He knew that they were new friends, but he felt so inexplicably close to her and he couldn’t stop thinking about how she had trusted him with intimate details about her life and her family, so he made the decision to trust her back. So far, he wasn’t regretting it.
Potter’s face suddenly seemed to go hard, his jaw set like he was clenching his teeth.
However, what did surprise him was the urge he would get around Potter to test these new waters. He and Potter were on unfamiliar ground here, and he knew that unless he took a big step forward, he would just be tip-toeing around in an attempt to keep everything calm and alright.
“Not this year,” he replied, watching cautiously as another baby Thestral bit at his shoelaces playfully. “Mother is trying to clear out the Manor of Dark Magic.”
She was saying all of this in a remarkably nonchalant tone of voice, and Draco was astounded. Lots of the things Violet had told him about Muggles had shocked and impressed him, but this had to be the most unbelievable. Muggles were really just flying around
Potter cut him off at once, his green eyes shining in the sun and Draco had a momentary lapse in which he couldn’t decide whether it was intimidating or magnificent.
“What’s so special about the creek?”
Potter leaned in, his thick black eyebrows furrowing again slightly as if he himself were confused by what he was doing, and he pressed his lips onto Draco’s.
“I’m insane! I’ve completely lost the plot,” Harry ranted, continuing to pace back and forth in front of his sofa. “This is what happens when I don’t have
“I also regret to have to inform you that you will not be permitted to play Quidditch on your House teams,” McGonagall seemed to have expected the responding outrage, as Ron, Harry, Dean, Kevin Entwhistle and Alice Runcorn from Hufflepuff, and Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner from Ravenclaw immediately made noises of protest.
“Originally, it was created to trap would-be robbers as well as create a saferoom of sorts. If a member of the household touched the part of the portrait that triggered the spell, they would be transferred to a saferoom within in the wall, enlarged using wizarding space. But if a stranger did the same, they would be taken to a room like this.”
Harry took a moment to refamiliarize himself with his body, and then looked up, suddenly remembering where he was.
Once he reached the door, he rang the bell and waited, panting slightly at the uphill walk it had taken to get here. He didn’t have to wait long, as the large mahogany door swung open with a creak, and Draco was greeted with the sight of Ollivander’s house elf and a sense of relief rushed through him.
“The Thestrals,” Draco said, gesturing to the animals and feeling more than a little stupid.
Watching kids try out the wands was rather special as well. He had never been particularly fond of children, not having any younger siblings or cousins while growing up, but he remembered how excited he had been to get his first wand and he could see that same excitement in every child’s eyes as they entered his store.
“We are going to ‘ave a baby!” Fleur declared, her smile so wide and white it was almost blinding.
with you this year?” he grumbled, crossing his arms like a child.
He started to wonder if this was a good idea after all.
Hermione straightened in her seat, which Harry knew meant she had the answer, as always.
“New plan,” Daphne said, ignoring Draco’s comment and turning back to Violet. “We are crashing that party.”
“Not enough,” he said, and then, feeling a bit of courage—he
“Stay in this position, but try and relax your muscles. You look tense.”
Draco rolled his eyes.
“Well, in terms of the Ollivander family, yes, but that doesn’t mean the wandmaking business has to die with him.”
“Hey,” he greeted him gently, so as not to disturb his focus. He knew how concentrated he himself would get while brewing potions, and how much he hated being interrupted. But Theo easily looked up and grinned at him.
“Yes, I know,” Potter replied, slowly. “You were the one who was telling me it’s normal to, er, fly for both teams, or however you put it.”
Harry merely grinned, deciding it was better not to agree aloud. He was glad to have this time with Ron, this moment of normalcy in what was one of his most unusual years at Hogwarts—which was saying a lot.
“Have you gotten an offer?” Harry asked. Ginny flashed him a wide grin.
“Harry, his father is in Azkaban and his mother is on house arrest. They’ve had Aurors in and out of their house all summer. Practically none of his friends returned to Hogwarts this year. Maybe schoolwork isn’t the first thing on his mind right now.”
Draco stepped away from the bench, coming around in front of Harry and then taking a seat next to him.
,” he cast, and a jet of water shot out from the tip of the wand. Perhaps it was not as much as it should have been, but it didn’t matter, because
“Alright,” Harry said, slowly, trying to see where he was going with this.
“What for?” Weasley demanded, and this time, Draco didn’t stop himself from scowling at him.
He had just levitated his pot of tea upstairs to the sitting room, far warmer on such a cold night with the fire crackling, when he heard two short knocks at the door, so slight that he may have imagined them.
” he cast, and a ball of bright, bluish-white light burst from his palm.
Malfoy merely rolled his eyes, and discreetly withdrew a miniscule glass vial from his bag. Reaching across the table, he picked up a large jar labelled
“It’s good advice,” she said, giving him a look that clearly meant to communicate something.
“Is it alright with you if I set us up?” he directed the question at Dennis, but Harry agreed with a nod anyway.
“What’s the name of that Ravenclaw Beater?” Sophie asked. “You know, she’s kind of small, has really long hair? She’s pretty.”
to do—he turned to anger. He told himself he was angry at Potter. Violet was wrong, Potter didn’t
“Sorry,” he said, sheepishly. “Anyway, Demelza’s the Quidditch captain this year, because Ginny turned it down. You could try, but I don’t know if she’ll have time for extra lessons, you know.”
Slughorn was pointing out to the class the soft periwinkle colour of their potion and explaining Malfoy’s method of freezing the etharica, but Harry was still looking at Malfoy, even when Slughorn dispersed the crowd and instructed them to go back to their own potion.
“So, did you? Play in the creek?” he asked. Draco nodded, smirking slightly.
“You’re wonderful, Harry, thank you,” said Hermione, before returning her attention to the parchment in front of her. Harry left the room, closing the door behind him to give Hermione her privacy.
, in a compartment all by himself, feeling pettily disdainful towards a wand.
“What? Now?” she asked. “It’s eight at night and you’ve been drinking.”
“It isn’t weird for you?” he asked.
Potter was not the same skinny, knobbly-kneed boy he had once been. He came out of the war looking rather weathered, gaunt in the face from the lack of adequate food, but also taller and more muscular, his arms strong and his chest broad.
“Yeah, I—” Harry managed to get out, feeling choked. For the first time, he felt himself trying to focus in on the thoughts instead of distracting himself from them.
“You came all the way over here to tell me that?”
He asked as much.
Ron gaped after her.
“I know you’re friends with Malfoy, Harry, and it’s fine. Obviously I don’t like the git, but even I can tell he’s not as much of a prick this year.”
Clearly sensing that Harry was confused, Demelza leaned in.
“Yes, yes. Perhaps Potions isn’t the right field for you. It takes…a certain kind of wizard,” Slughorn still wasn’t meeting his eyes and took another sip of brandy.
“I don’t know what it’s called. It’s just…I don’t like feeling trapped and closed in.”
“I wouldn’t know,” said Draco.
Still, he hesitated, and Harry easily noticed.
“Yes,” he said. “Well, no, not exactly, but…”
McGonagall seemed to realize what was distracting Draco.
“Right,” Harry said, taking a deep breath. “Right. But what if I mess it up? What if I say something stupid and he decides to never speak to me again?”
to look into, what with his apprenticeship for teaching and all, but Potter was always asking questions for reasons that Draco didn’t understand, and he was starting to get used to it.
She also seemed to be getting along very well with the dark-haired Ravenclaw boy who was apprenticing with her. Harry knew he wasn’t the most observant person, but even he could recognize the bright-eyed expression on her face whenever he smiled at her while passing in the Great Hall, or whenever he saw them talking animatedly—usually over several open books—in the common room.
He had tried to make sense of it, because that’s what he was good at. He was good at analysing, at figuring out the logic behind people’s actions, but things always got messier when emotions were involved. He told himself it was the power, that Lucius felt weak and out of control and needed to assert his dominance over
“You were trying to. You wouldn’t have cast it,” Potter spoke matter-of-factly. “I know how those spells work, Draco. You have to really mean it.”
“Harry,” said Draco again, his voice coming out as barely above a whisper. “Can I kiss you?”
He had tried to make sense of it, because that’s what he was good at. He was good at analysing, at figuring out the logic behind people’s actions, but things always got messier when emotions were involved. He told himself it was the power, that Lucius felt weak and out of control and needed to assert his dominance over something. Draco could understand that. He could even relate—the loss of control in his own life led him to be capable of things he never thought he could be.
“How do you expect Harry’s going to pass his N.E.W.T.’s if he lets Malfoy do all the work for him and doesn’t learn anything this year?”
Casting his eyes away from the Slytherins, Harry attempted to banish any thoughts of Draco Malfoy from his mind.
“Are you alright, Malfoy?” Potter inquired, looking at him with a curious expression.
“Ginny’s already taken the Winchester girl,” Ron commented. “There’s always the new Gryffindor Keeper, Wexler, but she scares me.”
“Blimey, is it seven already?” Ron exclaimed, earning himself an exasperated look from Hermione. “I have Auror training. Where’s Seamus?”
His eyelids were burning, but every time he closed them, he saw flashes. Flashes of him, of Voldemort. Sometimes it was Voldemort. Sometimes it was Tom Riddle—young, handsome Tom Riddle. Sometimes it was Bellatrix, her laughing face as Sirius fell through the veil. It was Bathilda Bagshot morphing into Nagini; the locket burning,
,” he said her name slowly and clearly, “is my friend. She has never shown me anything but kindness and support. Please do not disrespect her in my presence.”
It was about
“Since when? I’ve never seen you with her before this year.”
“It’ll just make it worse,” Ella added in a tiny squeak, clearly not able to get over Draco’s show as quickly as Daphne.
At Harry’s slight look of surprise, Ashworth smirked.
What was the purpose in doing anything, when everything would just reset by the next day? It wasn’t like he could build any sort of rapport with Potter, every single day it would just be erased again.
“Your top choice was the Harpies, right?” Hermione asked.
“Er…normal?” Harry said, not really understanding the question.
“Violet told me,” Draco supplied.
It was clear that Potter hadn’t even told Weasley and Granger about his little arrangement with Draco. Draco supposed he couldn’t blame him, he had always been just as horrible—if not more—to Potter’s friends as he had been to Potter himself. He couldn’t imagine Granger forgiving him any time soon, let alone Weasley. The hatred between the Malfoy and Weasley families ran deeper than just Draco and Potter’s right hand man.
“Thank you,” said Draco, tucking the letter into his bag and giving Elpis another little scratch before sending her off to the Hogwarts owlery.
“No.”
“It’s my best subject,” Draco supplied, looking back at McGonagall, mostly because he knew Snape would be disappointed with that answer. McGonagall didn’t look too pleased herself.
Harry sat back in his seat and watched Malfoy slowly stir the potion—two turns counter-clockwise, then four clockwise, and then repeat six times. He felt somewhat useless, but he had
“Oh,” said Violet, a look of understanding crossing her face. “I’m sorry.”
“Woah,” said Potter, from behind him, reminding Draco of his presence.
“Redwood doesn’t bring luck,” Ollivander said, shaking his head. “That’s an old superstition. Redwood wands are attracted to people who have the skill of always landing on their feet, which others interpreted to mean they were lucky and ran to give credit to the wand. No, no, redwood doesn’t bring good fortune, it is simply drawn towards people with the knack of snatching advantage from catastrophe.”
It had been so much easier to ignore any thoughts of Potter’s attractiveness when it had begun to be noticeable—somewhere around sixth year—back when they hated each other, and when Draco admittedly had much bigger things to worry about.
“Good on you, Potter,” he said. “At least all that fame is good for something.”
Draco listened, quietly. He had always thought that everything had come so easily to Potter, it was one of the many reasons why he hated him so much. He seemed to have all the luck in the world, friends who were constantly saving him, teachers who favoured him. But Potter was clearly feeling fraught here, and Draco—though he never thought he would—found himself relating to him.
“Ron’s the Cannon’s fan,” said Harry. “I suppose I was a bit, too, in solidarity.”
“Had a suspect Splinch himself trying to run from us last month. Left his ear, three toes, and, er, his…
“Darling, remember who you’re talking to, please,” she said, flicking her short hair back with a lengthy nail.
“Fifteen drops just like the textbook says,” Malfoy cuts in. “But frozen together and put in as a block so that it melts in the potion.”
Hermione looked a little happier about this, but raised her hand in the air again. Ashworth had a little smile on his face now.
Granger nodded, but cast another worried look at Potter before sitting and turning to Draco, who wondered if Potter’s aversion to loud noises had anything to do with his accidental attack of the Weasel.
“What? Why? What did she tell you?” Daphne asked, her breath shallow. Draco placed what he hoped was a calming hand on her upper arm.
had been Death Eaters. Violet had even fought on the
Potter ran a hand through his messy hair, leaning forward with a sigh.
The first few times Laurel had attended their dinners had been awkward. Draco had already been acquainted with her from before, through Violet, but not everyone was, and the group of wizards and witches felt somewhat unsure how to act around a Squib.
Draco couldn’t believe it—he was smiling.
“Slytherin does not mean Death Eater, Lisa,” Hermione said, turning towards the girl. “They’re not.”
“Thanks, Draco. Don’t stay up too late. The flowers can wait until tomorrow.”
“How did you know it was about him?”
“They didn’t die for you, Potter,” Draco found himself saying. “They died for what they believed in. Whether it was peace between Muggles and wizards, or that the Dark—Voldemort was an evil bastard, or revenge, or justice, or even if they believed in the mystical heroism of Harry Potter, they didn’t die
“Hello Mother,” he said, smiling at her.
of this Malfoy he had been exposed to.
“How are you feeling about your upcoming lessons with Draco?” Waya asked, an unreadable expression on his face.
Draco looked back at the book in front of him,
He didn’t know what to do. He had meticulously gone through his memories, trying to recall if he had done anything unusual, cast any difficult or strange spells, but nothing seemed out of ordinary—he was a thoroughly uninteresting person these days after all.
Harry stared at him. He had already known that Draco had lied, back then in the Manor, when he had been asked to identify him. He knew that Draco was well aware it was Harry, Stinging Hex be damned, and yet he had lied and said he couldn’t be sure.
“Durmstrang or Beauxbatons, I suspect. Or dead,” she replied, in a dull tone.
“And you have no other friends, of course,” Draco nodded, smirking slightly. Potter shot him a scowl.
Potter gave him a funny look, which Draco ignored in favour of uncapping the jar of dragon claws. He peered inside, trying to ignore the unholy stench that arose as soon as he removed the lid. With a sigh, he recapped it and pressed it to Potter’s chest.
“Yes, I know, a lot of it is merely my fear talking, but it’s difficult
“Brilliant idea,” said Draco, smirking. “What made you think of that?”
Harry was still gazing at the brochure in his hands, at the smiling young witches and wizards, in a smattering of robes of all colours and Muggle clothing.
Draco held out a hand and Theo dropped the pawn into his palm so he could take a closer look.
“Alright, alright, don’t get cheeky, I was just asking. We all thought you and Pansy had a bit of a thing back in fifth or sixth year is all.”
him into anything.
“I know what you mean,” Draco nodded. “I considered apprenticing in it too.”
“Hey, everyone! Just, if I could get your attention for a minute!”
She’s the one who roped him into this whole sponsorship deal with Northstar Quidditch Wear.
that that was what was going on here. What if tomorrow he woke up and it was the eleventh and he had to deal with the consequences? And even if the day repeated, nevertheless, there were the immediate repercussions to consider. He had been so careful to avoid Potter for so long, it was hard to imagine what interacting with him once again would look like.
“I’ll tell you in the Common Room,” he replied, aware that there were always people listening in on his conversations. As they head into the Founder’s Tower, someone was waiting for them by the Persian rug that guarded the entrance to their Common Room.
“Thank you,” said Harry, unsure what else to say. He wanted Malfoy to turn around, to face him, to look at him with that open and warm expression that Harry had become accustomed to over the last few days. “For taking care of me.”
“It looks to me to be larch and unicorn hair,” Draco said, trying to sound sure of himself. To his relief, Ollivander’s face lit up in a smile.
“No, of course not,” he said. “I don’t care about that.”
“Furthermore, as you are all of age, you are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on all weekends, not only on supervised trips. Know that this is a
“Well,” Draco paused, considering the question. It had been a while since he had read up about it, but he racked his brain to try and remember as much as he could. “The primary purpose was to keep the pureblood families alive. They were growing paranoid about blood-mixing and were convinced that they had to prevent the Sacred Twenty-Eight from dying out. So most of the magic is regarding heirs; the Oath prevents you from bearing a child that isn’t a pureblood. And it prevents
“That I had cocked up,” he said, in a sudden attempt to lighten the mood. He didn’t like talking about this, didn’t like how vulnerable and open it made him feel, didn’t like how he was starting to feel disconnected from his body again and had to scratch at his palm harshly to keep himself present.
His father.
It was preposterously modern, what Daphne was suggesting, however if their hypothesis about the Oath was correct, it
But nothing had exploded when he took the wand, so he’d paid five Galleons—an absurd price for a wand of such shabby quality—and left as quickly as he could. Once he had gotten home, he tested a few simple spells with his new wand, and it wasn’t entirely useless. It handled basic charms alright, but it wasn’t
“Would you…like to join me?” asked Harry, awkwardly gesturing at the seat across from him.
“Here, I can—” Harry stumbled over his words, yanking his own wand from his robe pockets and casting a quick
“What can I say?” she shrugged. “That’s one way to give someone butterflies.”
try, Malfoy, you can’t give up that easy,” Potter said, rolling his eyes. “What memory were you thinking of?”
“I can’t believe I didn’t think of that!”
Potter shot him a glance, but when Draco looked back at him, his green eyes were back on the pitch already.
“Pardon me, as a
“Harry and I broke in when we were fifteen, I’m sure we’ll be quite alright,” said Granger, already getting up from her desk. Potter stood as well, seeming to have to problem with the prospect of breaking into a highly secretive Ministry department.
After that, Draco had agonized over a rack of scarves in Gladrags Wizardwear for over twenty minutes, weighing the benefits of silk versus cashmere, until Theo had had enough and simply grabbed one at random. As Draco had handed over the coins for it, he decided the right choice had been made—Mother would appreciate the softness of the silk, and the pale blue colour would match her eyes.
When people were around, Potter easily ignored Draco, offering little more than a nod or a simple greeting. They still chatted occasionally at work, but beyond that, there was little interaction between them in public. Potter would owl when he wanted to see Draco, or—on occasion—just show up at his door.
“She said something about Luna, called her ‘Loony Lovegood’. It wasn’t…I know I’ve said worse before, but…” he paused, trying to articulate his thoughts. “I wasn’t a good person, at Hogwarts. I didn’t like being reminded of that. Not that that’s her fault, I suppose.”
Daphne and the boys continued to stare at Violet, in awe of this flood of new information about their classmate. Aware that she was being gawked at, Violet raised her eyebrows at them.
“What? But…I just saw you coming in yesterday.”
“So, er, how are you doing?”
When dessert was just wrapping up, and Ron was shovelling as much strawberry cream cake into his mouth as he could before the food all disappeared, Harry felt that uneasy nervousness creep back into his stomach.
He had to stop them from rising up, had to push them back down into the darkness, back where they couldn’t hurt him.
“Oh,” said Potter. “Right. Time loop.”
“Oh, yes,” Draco nodded. “The boy’s poor mother nearly fainted when he accidentally shattered the window.”
“What?”
—someone was walking directly towards the Forbidden Forest.
“Draco?” Potter voiced, bringing Draco’s attention back to the table.
“Go on, Potter, take it,” Draco said, his voice snappy and impatient. Harry looked up at him, but Draco wasn’t meeting his eyes.
Draco had been in too deep from the very beginning, and he knew it. But still, how was he meant to resist? It was
“What about me?” Draco asked obnoxiously, grinning as she was about to turn away.
After Draco thanked Ollivander profusely for his new wand, the elder wandmaker got straight back to work. They hadn’t been able to resume their sessions right after the holidays, as Ollivander had had business abroad. So now, in early February, Ollivander declared they had much to catch up on.
I served time in Azkaban, I served my probation, with all of those blasted spell locks on my wand, but there is just no end to it.”
Everyone was supposed to take turns with their partner to check up on the potion. Draco, however, certainly didn’t trust Potter to do more than hand him ingredients. He even managed to mess that up at times.
“I guess not. It does get taken a little far sometimes, but that’s how it’s always been. Were the Houses at Ilvermorny different?”
“Apparently, my education in all things Muggle was severely lacking,” he said. He was looking all around the room, trying to find something to fix his gaze on, uncomfortably aware that Potter’s eyes never once left his face.
“Me neither,” said Harry. “He was very defensive of him, too. And he called him Theo.”
“Alright, well, good luck,” he said, somewhat awkwardly and turned to make his way to the door.
“Well, many of those pureblood marriages were arranged. They were marriages of convenience and often expressly for the purpose of continuing the line. That was always the most important part,” Granger pondered. “And I don’t think they expected that people would simply stop performing the marriage ritual either.”
“Fuck off,” said Potter, tossing his cigarette onto the ground and crushing it with his dragonhide boot. He looked up at Draco and held out a hand. “Apparate us?”
“We’ve been through a lot together,” Hermione said, in a voice that was suddenly gentle. “We all have. And I will always love Ron, just like I will always love you, Harry. But it’s the three of us. I think it was always meant to be the three of us.”
“Let me at least walk you back to the Slytherin Common Room,” Draco said and Ella squeezed her eyes shut tightly before opening them again and nodding.
“So! Tell me, Mr Malfoy, what is it you have an interest in pursuing?”
Hermione said that talking about it would help, that he needed to get some of the pressure off his chest. But he felt like talking about it just made things worse, just made the pain more present, more focused. And talking always seemed to worry his friends, something that he didn’t feel he had any business doing anymore.
Ashworth chuckled lightly.
Draco wanted to remind him that he wasn’t technically alone, but Potter was starting to kiss down his neck and well, it was hard to focus on anything else when he was doing that.
to be fine about it, you know.”
feel like it,” she said, slowly. Harry grinned at her. That was Hermione’s way of saying
The Headmistress’s office was cluttered, but everything seemed to be neatly ordered in its rightful place. Magical objects filled the room and Draco would’ve loved to spend hours examining each and every one of them. McGonagall, however, did not seem to have time to waste.
Of course, this Christmas would be very different. He wouldn’t walk downstairs in the Manor to find his parents waiting for him with several beautifully wrapped presents. He wouldn’t levitate the silver star to sit on top of the tree, or eat the magnificent Christmas feast prepared by the elves, or listen to his mother sing along to Celestina Warbeck on the wireless.
Malfoy, and it wouldn’t be like him to go this long without an insult.
“What do you mean?” he asked. “Potter won it off of me. It’s his now.”
Did Potter really think him
Her voice was rising in alarm and Draco’s head whipped around, terrified that the noise was about to get them caught.
“Why? Who’s doing this?” Draco continued. Daphne shot him a dangerous look.
“Does that mean they won’t be in individual sessions?” Harry asked, looking towards Hermione for answers. As usual, she had them.
“Well, what if you had both gotten offers from the Falmouth Falcons, and she was excited about it and wanted you both to join, but then you also got an offer from the Harpies, who were your favourite team and your first choice?”
“What’s the difference?”
“Stop a wound from bleeding?”
“I know, I know, I’m sorry,” Draco said, quickly. “It’s just…unexpected, I suppose.”
They travelled through the house, Draco’s hand unconsciously hovering over his wand holster the whole time. He knew that the house had been mostly cleared, but Dark Magic tended to
“The war was…Everyone suffered. And people have lost far more than I have, but…not everyone felt that
ate too much treacle tart at Hogwarts’s opening ceremony, so he knew that wasn’t what it was.
“Secondly, several of our potions this year are highly reactive and dependent upon those mixing them, so I’ve decided the safest way to handle this is to assign you partners you will stick with for the year. As several of the traditional Old Magic love potions we will be crafting are known to have messy reactions when men and women both participate in their creation, you will be partnered with someone of your sex.”
Hermione had arrived after spending some time with her parents, and Luna and her father had been there for Christmas dinner. George had been in far better spirits than he had been that summer, and even joined the rest of them outside for a few games of Quidditch. January was set to have several Quidditch scouts arriving at Hogwarts for recruitments, so Ginny had insisted she get as much practice as she possibly could. Ron had just been happy to play again, and Harry had found he had rather missed flying—though the Weasley brooms didn’t have much on his old Firebolt.
“Well, I
“Have you been down to visit the herd of Thestrals?” she asked casually, as if the two of them were old friends. “The babies’ wings have finally grown in.”
you old sod, for
“It’s just Potions,” Harry shrugged. “Malfoy does all the work anyway. I wouldn’t be much help to him like this anyway.”
“Welcome, students, to Transfiguration. In case you don’t remember from the opening feast, I am your new instructor, Professor Ashworth. I know you are all quite used to Professor McGonagall teaching this subject, and transitioning to a new professor in your final year can be challenging, however I guarantee as long as you work hard and complete your assignments, you will succeed in this class.”
With that, she simply swept up her things with a wave of her wand and gestured for Violet to follow her up into the girls’ dormitories. Theo was quick to go as well, refusing to look at Draco, and hurrying off to his own room.
“Oh, I am going to be having a very stern word with Head Unspeakable Jamison,” said Granger. “I’ll have charges filed against him if necessary, this is in violation of international magical law. They have no idea what kind of damage they could be causing to the fabric of time. I’ll have him in first thing tomorrow morning. I might ask you to bring Robards in as backup, Harry, if that’s okay.”
—but there
“People are scared, I think,” he continued, as Harry pecked at the pieces of apple. “Scared of things they don’t understand. Trust me, I know that all too well.”
“Isn’t that a shock?” he said, his voice cold. “The Death Eater is capable of human kindness.”
stuff I could teach him!”
“No problem, I think you’ll like it. Now, how have you been sleeping lately?”
Silently, Draco agreed with her. He couldn’t believe he had lived his entire life without knowing anything about the people he had been taught to hate. He had constantly been told they were useless and pathetic, and all the while they had been inventing ingenious substitutions to magic. He felt like he’d been lied to.
Just like that, the discomfort and heaviness of the past conversation was gone. Potter easily slid back into game commentary and Draco tried not to think about what it would have been like to have Potter as a roommate down in the Slytherin dormitories.
After more than a week away—though honestly, he had long since lost count at this point—he returned to the Ministry. He went to the Auror Headquarters each day to pick up the signed reports, each time having a different pleasant conversation with Potter. Occasionally, he hid in the broom closet across from the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office whenever he saw Finchley coming.
“Why would he do that?” Ron just looked confused, but Hermione, who had been nose-deep in a book as usual, seemed to gather that something was going on, and set down her book.
“Potter, it’s ginger, not a beetle. You’re not killing anything. Gentle, circular motions will do the trick.”
Ron, who was filling his plate with pancakes and hadn’t even glanced at his schedule, suddenly stopped, a pancake dangling off his fork in mid-air.
Not wanting to draw attention to himself, he quickly sat himself down in a mustard-coloured chair near the door, stroking the armrest almost automatically, as if his body was searching for something—anything—to soothe him.
Draco stared at him. He was close enough now that Draco could see a stray eyelash on the bridge of his nose, and a smattering of sun freckles splashed across his cheeks, and his pink lips slightly open as he let out a breath, his tongue poking out so briefly that Draco may have imagined it.
want to see Draco again. Despite how staunchly he had avoided speaking about him, he couldn’t help but think about him from time to time. He wondered how he was doing, how his work was, if he was still in touch with his friend Foxblade from school, if he and Luna still spent time together. He had ached to ask Luna about him on more than one occasion, but he had always bitten his tongue. Luna was unusually perceptive, and he was always afraid if he even mentioned Draco’s name, she would somehow
She said it so quietly that Draco was almost sure he misheard her.
“Your memories aren’t meaningless,” he said, softly but firmly. “Bad memories stick to you, they replay in your head over and over. They’re almost clearer in your memory than the good ones. Voldemort is the cause of most of my bad memories too. But, well, Hermione always says that he’d already taken up enough of my life and that I shouldn’t let memories of him take any more of it.”
“But I suppose I shouldn’t complain about high expectations. He’s demanding, but there’s no doubt that it’s working.”
Draco gave a tense shrug.
It was surprisingly simple to organise. After all, Parvati had been begging Harry for an interview for months, and she was absolutely ecstatic when he told her at their next pub night that he would do it.
Still, serving as Ollivander’s apprentice had been one thing; taking over the job entirely was another, and Draco had been fraught with nerves his first few months. There was the occasional customer who vowed their children would never purchase a wand off of him and had instead taken off to Carkitt Market in search of imported wands from Kinta Wolfe in the United States or Filip Poláček from closer to home in the Czech Republic.
Malfoy uttered, but the tiny flames that spurt out of the end of his wand died immediately, not enough to spark a fire under the cauldron.
“Exactly,” Harry confirmed with a grimace.
Violet went quiet, her eyes softening.
Violet shrugged.
She was also very friendly with Sophie, in a different way to how she was with Harry and Ron. Hermione had never had very many female friends, except for Ginny and Luna, with whom Hermione didn’t really have much in common. Sophie, on the other hand, was rather similar to Hermione, which Harry frequently liked to point out to Ron, earning himself a smack on the back of his head every time.
“How are you doing?” she asked, sitting in the armchair across from him and tucking a lock of her wild hair behind her ear.
“Go, Draco, I’ll see you next Sunday.”
Waya had a smile playing at his lips, and Harry felt a hot flush creeping up his neck. It wasn’t
“Very well, then. I believe dinner is about to start, best be headed down to the Great Hall,” she said, rising from her seat. Draco quickly followed suit, but paused when she began to head back towards the spiral staircase.
They’d been working on this case for months now, and it had been one of the darkest, most frustrating ones yet. Someone had been hunting and murdering Squibs in some of the most brutal ways Draco had ever seen. The victims had all been women, and there was always an element of sexual assault, however the killer was disturbingly good at covering his tracks. It had seemed like no one had seen him, and, unfortunately, his choice in victims made it even more difficult, as many of the women had been cast away by their families and had been forced to live as Muggles. Draco and Potter had interviewed countless Muggles, even checking if they’d been Obliviated, but there wouldn’t have even been a need, as in a Muggle area, all the killer would have needed was a simple Disillusionment Charm.
“Bent, yes. As a silver Knut.”
“Whoever it is, he’s convinced of it,” Harry said. “He think that someone is trying to kill him. More than just one person. I thought—I mean,
But Draco had continued to feel slightly uneasy, as though there was a constant chill up his arms he could never shake off. Much as he loved his mother, he had been glad to have the excuse of his work to move out.
“No, he’s right,” added Harry, grinning. “Very fluffy. I’d definitely pet you.”
Hermione protested and swatted at him and Ron laughed and batted her away and Harry felt a sudden lightness in his head.
He found Daphne Greengrass, Blaise Zabini, and Gregory Goyle boarding a carriage together. He quickly hopped on before the thestrals trotted away.
“That’s good,” she said, as though he were commenting on the weather. “Are you alright? You’ve got a red aura all around you, you have to be careful with that or you’ll attract—“
“Mum? Are you alright?”
“Let me down? Draco, I’m happy to just spend time with you, to get to know you. We truly don’t have to do anything special. In fact, I would love it if we just went to a nice dinner or something.”
The Slytherins proved to be a very needed addition to the group. The Gryffindors seemed to want to make these grandiose plans that had about fifty different ways they could go awry. Draco’s friends on the other hand thought of an easier strategy.
“Yes, your entire family was. But the Ministry doesn’t appear to find you very threatening, else they would not have even offered that deal to your parents,” McGonagall said somewhat bitterly. “Mr. Malfoy, some leadership in the Ministry is under the impression that desperate times call for desperate measures. The struggle we’ve been facing for the past few decades did not end with the fall of Voldemort. There are still Death Eaters at large, the Ministry is not having success apprehending them, and so they feel the need to reassure the public that they are doing something. Hence, the hasty imprisonment of your parents.
He complied hesitantly, barely feeling any soreness. “That’s it?”
Harry ignored his fears. “What if I called you ‘dragon’?” he asked, grinning.
“What is this artifact?” Kingsley’s voice boomed, though he sounded like he already knew the answer.
“My ‘negative’ emotion of choice to hide that I was afraid was anger. After Voldemort came back, I was furious at everything and everyone, even people who didn’t deserve it. Ron, Hermione, Sirius, they all tried to make me feel better, but I just pushed them away. I was just so mad that no one was telling me anything, and so afraid of what I would be expected to do. So I know what you mean.”
The Ministry worker—somewhat roughly, to Draco’s annoyance—escorted Narcissa through the Floo. When he returned, thankfully to the same room, Draco slipped behind him before the door shut. There wasn’t a clock in sight, so Draco wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but he knew that he quickly needed to get back to Kingsley’s office.
Neville glared at the Auror. “You’re still treating him like a child, acting like he didn’t save the entire wizarding world.” Draco never got to hear the end of this conversation, because another Auror was all of a sudden hauling him to his feet.
Draco took a deep breath. “I need your help.”
“Yes,” Lucius drawled. “Our son is making friends with the one person trying to ruin our lives. Don’t you understand, Narcissa? Harry Potter is behind all of this. He’s always been out to get Draco and ruin our reputation. I’m sure he arranged for the manacle to be put on Draco’s wrist. I’m sure he told McGonagall that they needed to be roommates, so that Harry could keep a closer eye on him. And now—“ Lucius briefly looked to the side at Draco for the first time since their secret confrontation. “—now we’re in this position,” he finished awkwardly. It was clear he meant to say something else.
Draco had spent his entire childhood listening to his father talk about how vital it was for the Wizarding World to look upon the Malfoys favorably. But surprisingly, he found that he didn’t much care that the
gay,” Blaise reassured Greg. “I’m sure he’s just going through one of his moods; you know how he can be. You didn’t do anything wrong and I’m sure he’s not upset with you. If he’s not all sorted out by next week, we’ll talk to him.”
. “So tell me, how have you been doing lately? Have you enjoyed your time back at school?”
“They offered it to me, but I didn’t want it. I just want to relax for once.”
“Harry!” Kingsley boomed, and got up to shake his hand. “It’s so good to see you! How are you doing?”
The sky began to darken, and Draco’s heart began to beat faster with the dimming light. Knowing he still had a few hours left on his journey, he decided to settle down in a compartment and get some rest—he wasn’t sure if he would be able to get any tonight. He opened his trunk to reveal something that he stole before he left—though he hoped Harry wouldn’t notice or miss it. He didn’t want to come across as needy. He laid down on the soft train seat and draped one of Harry’s warm, Muggle jackets over him. Hoping that the smell would ward off any nightmares, Draco drifted off to sleep.
The guard glanced at the check-in witch, both of whom looked uncomfortable. “No,” the witch said. “We just thought it would behoove you, Mr. Potter, if we took proper precautions for your safety—“
Draco thought that was very odd but Neville nodded along. “And I can discuss some reforms that need to be made at St. Mungo’s. So it’s not like it’ll be a total waste of time.”
“Oh,” Harry said, looking incredibly relieved.
“If the
“What exactly are you guys fighting against?”
I liked writing this one! Let’s hope the trial brings Draco and Harry closer together. As always, please let me know what you think and leave your comments! I love reading them and I love you guys.
Everyone was silent for a few moments, then Granger spoke up. “This is exactly what I’m talking about, Harry. We all need to heal and unite, regardless of what happened in the past.”
“Like you would know what Parisans look like,” Draco said teasingly. “Don’t worry, I’ll take you there someday. Shall we?”
“Don’t look so glum, it doesn’t hurt,” Draco lied.
“Wait, you’re good at Occlumency, right?” Potter looked a little sheepish after he said this.
Narcissa squirmed a little in her seat. “There was one other thing. He wanted an ancient artifact that had been in the Malfoy family for generations.”
“Draco, Draco look at me—“ someone was tilting his head toward them, and Draco willed himself not to retch again.
“Great,” Draco said sarcastically, though he was feeling a little more sober. Thankfully, though, not sober enough to let the reality of what he had said earlier sink in. He took a sip of water, not wanting to aggravate his beginning nausea. “Potter, I’m sorry.”
Thank you all so much for your love! I realized my italics from copy/paste don’t transfer so hopefully I got all of them manually. Hopefully the next chapter will be posted tomorrow
Even I couldn’t contain myself for that much longer. Can’t wait for these two to find out what they really need....As always comments are so loved and appreciated!
“Yes, Professor,” Draco said somewhat sheepishly. It really hadn’t been all that bad—he felt slightly embarrassed now for making such a fuss earlier.
? It was unnerving to Draco. He stood awkwardly for a second, not quite sure how to make his exit but knowing that he definitely could not stay.
“You are not defective. You’re in the best state you’ve ever been in your life. Well, maybe besides your pinky finger.” Draco’s smallest finger, now permanently curled, had not really recovered from his hypothermia, and it likely never would. “Do I look worried?”
“Luna actually came to find us in the Great Hall,” Harry said, sitting on the edge of Draco’s bed. “She said that...she ran into you at the Astronomy Tower.” Harry paused, and Hermione looked down. “She told us you didn’t seem to be doing...too well. I decided to head back to the room to grab something and see where you were and Hermione came with me. We saw the blood trail in the hallway.”
Draco tugged on his shirt collar and removed his jacket. “Nothing. It’s just so damn hot in here.”
. You aren’t doing anything rash to try and help your father and I, are you?”
“GRANDPARENTS!” Mrs. Weasley finished Fleur’s sentence. “Arthur, did you hear that? Fleur’s pregnant!”
Potter actually looked annoyed at this. “Look, Draco, I genuinely thought you had changed and we could start out on a different foot. The past is in the past—“
“It’s okay,” Myrtle cooed. “I know some of the things you’ve done and I forgive you.”
. A meter.
“D—Draco? What are you doing here? Am I actually awake?”
Draco nodded as he pulled on his pajamas. Harry glanced at him mischievously. “Do you want to...” he gestured to his own bed.
“No, do you know nothing about Wizarding culture, Potter?” Draco gave an annoyed sigh. “Marriage contracts rarely have anything to do with attraction. Sure, it works out for some couples, like my parents. But as long as they produce an heir, both parties are allowed to do whatever they want in privacy.”
Harry squinted, still smiling. “The standard stuff? Sounds like a pureblood thing.”
Draco couldn’t decide how he felt about that. For one, it would give him an excuse not to be around his friends. But it would also spark concern in them, and they potentially wouldn’t leave him alone. He decided to attempt to go to the kitchen every once and a while to stock up on some essentials inside his room.
Draco met his gaze. “I have
So sad :( We’ll have to make sure there’s some fluff next chapter! As always, let me know what you guys think. Lots of love!
“We’re just going to sit a bit. Get some fresh air, talk things out.”
When Harry and Draco entered their bedroom, it seemed that they were both unsure of what to do next. It was certainly unusual to be dating your roommate, and the beds were staring at them forebodingly. “Shall we each sit on our own?” Draco suggested awkwardly.
“That’s quite alright.” If it wasn’t going to impede Draco too much in the long term, there was no point fixing it.
Auror Yarney glared at him before abruptly standing up. “Come with me.”
“Why? Don’t you hate him?”
There was a long silence as everyone absorbed what he said. Then Dean spoke. “So you’re not going to break up with Potter?”
. And then, the one chance you had to actually protect your family, and you couldn’t even kill an old man. At least my failures weren’t a result of incompetence.”
Granger gave a friendly smile and got up from where she was sitting playing Gobstones. “Hey guys! McGonagall agreed to let us have a small celebration, since we’re of age and all. We’ve got about a half bottle of Firewhisky left, if you’re interested.”
After a few moments of this and of sipping on some water that Harry conjured, Draco felt he could speak again. “My mother is...fine, I guess. As well as she can be. My father, though...” And through sobs, Draco told Harry every awful thing that his father said to him. He told Harry how paranoid his father looked, how Lucius looked at him like he was an abomination.
“Yes, he came to the Manor. It certainly surprised us when he knocked on our door, but we let him inside. He claimed that he needed to talk to us about something important, something that could impact both of our children.” Narcissa choked up on the last word. “We served him tea, and he explained that our sons were not safe in this world. He said that his son, Theodore Jr., was in hiding abroad, and that he couldn’t believe we allowed Draco to return to Hogwarts. He claimed that he had a way of...allowing our families to have better standing. To allow our children to have better lives. All we had to do was abandon our home save for a few key items and come with him. He said that we could have Draco back in our arms within weeks.”
“What? Are you kidding me? With my parents, I don’t plan on furthering the Malfoy line at all. I wouldn’t want to inflict that on someone.”
Draco spends his first night at home. He receives unpleasant news from his mother, and prepares to visit his father.
Finally they are dating! A lot of my friends were like “oh they should kiss before they date” but I just didn’t see that happening. However in the next chapter.....
“What do you mean try anything? And why him, exactly? Is he a convicted criminal?”
“Draco? Can I come in?” An impossibly gentle voice came from the other side of the stall door. Draco recognized it as Harry’s, and he was both horribly embarrassed and incredibly grateful that Harry had somehow found him.
Draco stepped out of the fireplace into Professor McGonagall’s office, where she was waiting for him. He coughed from the soot and brushed off his clothes.
“I suppose so,” Draco said in an even tone.
“Draco,” Harry said seriously. “I know how you feel. I was worried for the longest time that I was an outsider, intruding on the Weasley’s. But they’ve welcomed me like one of their own. I truly feel like they’re my family.”
“How can you possibly know that?” Lucius had always been somewhat condescending toward Narcissa, who had proved herself far more capable at tasks requiring skills such as Occlumency than Lucius.
“What?” Draco asked, confused. “
“I suppose, but you haven’t really told me what I should be ready for.”
“I mean yes, but it will take probably a day or two before he feels back to normal. I could give him some sugary drinks, that’ll help.”
Narcissa nodded, the other hand pressed to her mouth to keep from speaking. Her eyes were already filling with tears as she gathered her son in her arms. Later, Draco would pretend that the wet spots on his blazer were from her tears, and not his. “My dragon, oh my goodness. I am so, so proud of you. I promise you that everything is going to be okay.”
After a few moments taking in the comfort of Harry’s scent, Draco leaned back in the chair and wiped his eyes. “Shouldn’t we get back to the trial?” He wiped his eyes with his sleeve.
“Awesome. We were all going to go down to Hogsmeade afterward if you’re interested.” The eighth-years now had permission to visit the nearby village during weekends. Draco didn’t respond and kept writing, hoping that Potter would take the hint. “See you later,” Harry said, and left Draco back to his studying.
Draco knew that he was about to find out. Harry was sitting on his bed, watching Draco pack on Friday afternoon for his weekend visit to Malfoy Manor. “Are you nervous?” he asked.
“Dragon?” Draco snapped out of his memories and sat up in bed at the sound of his mother’s voice—tentative and worried as it always had been this summer. “Would you like some breakfast?”
Harry sat up, looking more alert. “You mean when I cursed you and nearly killed you? Of course I feel bad.”
Draco didn’t know what to say to that. He had no comforting words—how could he? His parents were in Azkaban, he was hanging on by a thread, and apparently former Death Eaters were out to capture him. For now, the most he could do was sit with Greg in this uncertain space. Both boys took comfort in knowing they were not alone.
“You’re not allowed to be here,” she addressed Draco only. “Get out of my pub.”
“I told you, Potter. Death Eaters can’t cast Patronuses.” Draco glanced at the clock as Potter opened his mouth to argue. It was a quarter to four—he would have to leave in order to meet with his lawyer in time. “I have to go.” Draco left Potter looking sympathetically at him as he snatched up his bag and stalked out of the room.
“It doesn’t matter! You didn’t need any of your own magic to curse Katie Bell, did you? To nearly poison Ron? Or to let the Death Eaters into the castle, one of whom mauled Bill nearly to death? Your father didn’t need magic to plant that stupid diary into my cauldron. When is everyone going to realize that you don’t need magic to do serious damage?” Draco knew that Ginny was a very strong person, but she seemed to be in near tears.
“Easy, it’s okay,” Potter hushed Draco’s panicked gasps as he choked and sputtered.
“Exactly, even if—what?!”
“No. I’m into blokes, just not these blokes,” Draco gestured to the door.
“Are you alright?” Hermione Granger stood up, concerned at his bent-over figure.
“But he’s not like...making fun of you or anything,” Daphne said thoughtfully. “I remember when he attacked you in the bathroom last year. Pansy told me you were worried he was going to tell the whole school that you were...upset.” She chose her words carefully—Draco did not want to admit that he cried in front of Potter. He hadn’t even wanted to tell Pansy, but she came to the Hospital Wing so often to visit him where he was cornered. Answering her questions at least made her go away faster so he could be alone and in peace. He ended up telling her the whole story, feeling that his childhood friend would keep it between the two of them. He was mildly irritated that this was clearly not the case. “But it didn’t get around school at all. I wonder what he’s after, then.”
Draco spends the next week deciding what to do, and furthering his relationship.
“Actually, no. That’s not the best way to start—trying to empty your mind is truly very difficult. First, we’re going to start with you trying to show me a very specific memory. Think about...hmmm...think about your first Quidditch game here.” A small smile shone on Harry’s face as he leaned back and closed his eyes. “Think about what you felt. What you smelled, what you heard. The feeling of walking onto the pitch, the wind in your face as you flew through the air. Stop at that point—don’t think about the whole game. Just think about walking onto the pitch, anything Wood or your other teammates said to you during the huddle, and the start of the game.”
“It’s not a cure, exactly. Mental ailments can’t be cured, but the effects can be reduced significantly. There are dozens of Muggle studies—“
“Hey, I can be a threat if I wanted to be!” Draco was mildly offended, particularly in his intoxicated state.
Draco smiled flirtatiously. “Don’t expect to put me to work without paying for it.” Harry blushed. “I mean by getting to look at the artifacts, Potter, don’t be crass,” Draco joked.
“You’re talking a lot.” She looked offended, and Draco quickly changed his tone. “Not that that’s a bad thing! It’s just unusual.”
“I need to do no such thing. Also, we’re roommates, in case you’ve forgotten.”
Draco caught the letter and looked at it with apprehension. It was clearly his father’s handwriting. Harry misinterpreted Draco’s hesitation. “Do you want to put gloves on before we open it? Or we could have the Ministry examine it first?”
“No. Why, was there something about my parents?”
“You’re not,” Harry reassured him. “Good relationships don’t solve mental illness. Also I know you’re really stressed about our presentation tomorrow, and about seeing your parents next week. It’s understandable you’re having a rough go. But I’m here with you all the way, and I know you’ll do great in Defense Against the Dark Arts.”
“When you were poisoned and got really poorly. You mumbled it to me in a rant on the stairs back to the Hospital Wing.”
She nodded and cupped Draco’s cheek in her hand. “I’m so—“ her voice suddenly broke off when she heard footsteps. “We’ll talk later, dragon, I promise. Quickly!”
Draco swallowed. He didn’t want to talk about it at all, didn’t want to tell Harry anything about what he heard or saw. But he also felt as though he were going to explode or be crushed under the weight of his own thoughts. Besides, Harry wasn’t going to leave him alone anyway. “I—I went to Azkaban today.”
He waited in the same damp room for a few moments, and then Yarney led his mother to Draco in chains. She looked quite a bit worse than the last time Draco was here. Her eyes were sunken into her pale face, and her features looked so pointy that her face had lost most of its renowned beauty. But she still had a spark in her eyes—she was still his mother. He wanted to hug her more than he had ever wanted anything in his life.
Draco’s heart had never felt so full, and the pain of it was the best sort. Draco sat up, steadying himself on the bed as the world swayed, and ran his hand along Harry’s cheek. Harry was very still, and looked into Draco’s eyes with sadness. Draco didn’t want Harry to be sad. He leaned in closely and closed his eyes—
“No,” Draco said truthfully. “I don’t know how anyone is supposed to figure this stuff out.” Harry was silent for a moment. “Hey,” Draco said, wanting to get his attention. Harry looked up at him. “You know that we don’t have to do this now, right? Rush any of it? I’m happy with you. I’m happy to have you sitting with me, I’m happy talking with you, I’m happy doing anything with you. Happiest I’ve ever been.”
“It did! You’ve got some pretty shrewd friends. I rather enjoyed their company, especially given that they’re Slytherins,” Harry said jokingly.
“Not really. I don’t think I would have gone if it hadn’t been for my probation.”
“My family already got off really easy, under the circumstances. Drawing any attention to ourselves is not a good thing.” Draco was reminded of his father’s warning to not cause any problems. “Don’t worry, Potter, I’ll order in for some healing potions and the like.” Draco couldn’t believe that Potter was this concerned about him.
“I am in love with Harry Potter. The relationship will last as long as both of us would like it to. Having a child is nowhere near of a priority of mine. Why would I want my child to have the Malfoy name? It means something much worse than nothing. We’re a family of cowards. We weren’t even proper Death Eaters.” He turned to Lucius. “You always just want to be on the side that gets you the most money. I want to be on my side.”
Lucius’s face contorted itself into an unreadable expression. “When?”
dozens of times, but never in Harry’s favor. Maybe that’s why he was having such a hard time finding the right words.
“My father helped make this,” Harry said. “Fred and George gave it to me in my third year. It’s pretty useful. There are some hidden passages marked on here, and you can tell where everyone is.”
“Oh, shoot! I’m so sorry,” Dean Thomas had spilled ice cold water on Draco, who had jumped up and was trying to stop it from damaging his suit jacket. “I was just taking this to my room and I guess I slipped. Here, let me help you, Malfoy.”
Sorry this is a little late! I hope to update every few days or so. The exposition is almost done—now we can get to the good stuff!
Draco and Harry made their way up a few flights of stairs, with Draco shouldering his own trunk this time. He felt deeply exhausted, and was extraordinarily grateful that at least he would be in the same room as Harry. He set his trunk at the foot of Ron’s bed. “Do you think Ron will be horrified,” he said dryly. “That I’m sleeping in his bed?”
Narcissa looked down. “We were...not favored by the Dark Lord.”
Blaise scoffed next to Draco. “I can’t wait to tell everyone exactly what I ate for breakfast every day last year, because that’s all I’m sharing.” Draco laughed.
“Harry, I know you weren’t about to say that you don’t have a family. You have Teddy, I know you stay at the Weasleys’ a ton. And if you don’t like them, I’m sure any Wizarding family would fall over their feet for you to choose them.” That got a laugh out of Harry. “I know it’s not the same as not having your parents alive. But you still care about them, and I’d know you’d do anything for them. Hell, you’re pretty close to being willing to do anything for random people on the street. That’s how I feel about my mother.”
“That’s fantastic!” Harry said. “That vision must have been really good.” Please don’t ask me about it. “I think if you develop it more, you’ll be able to produce a Patronus in no time.”
Draco nodded, not quite having the strength to speak yet.
“I appreciate that,” Harry said to Greg. He looked somewhat at ease, but his bouncing leg beside Draco gave away some of his anxiety. “I know this is weird, and I know it hasn’t been easy for you guys to be back at school. But—“ Harry looked at Draco, silently asking if he could mention anything. Draco smile and nodded. “—Draco and I have begun dating.”
There seemed to be a lot of that going around lately, that the Malfoys weren’t worth hating, and Draco wasn’t sure how he felt about that. He didn’t want his family to be a threat to others, but he was so used to being a part of an influential whole. Who was he without that? “For what it’s worth, Granger,” Draco said. “I never should have called you that word. It just bothered me so much that I was nearly always second in class to you, and you didn’t even have the head start of having magical parents. But that’s not an excuse for how I treated you. I’m sorry.”
“Now I know why you were always so high up in your class, with intelligent statements like that—“ Draco slapped Harry playfully for this comment. “No but seriously, you should keep going. And you should, eventually, talk about those unpleasant things. I’ve been going for, what, like nearly 5 months now? It’s made a huge difference.”
Harry looked extraordinarily amused. “What?”
, what more is it going to take? I’ve insulted your family my whole life. It’s because of me that your brother was mauled by a werewolf. It’s indirectly because of me that another one of your brothers was nearly killed by poison. And didn’t my father plant You-Know-Who’s stupid diary into your cauldron so that you’d be possessed and—“ With a sharp pain, Draco fell to the ground. He writhed only for a moment under the familiar Cruciatus curse before the pain left nearly as quickly as it had come. He made to get up, looking at Ginny suspiciously.
“Come, dear, let’s just go in the other room to think,” Narcissa spoke quietly. She grabbed his cane and started to lead him upstairs. “Stay here,” she whispered to Draco.
“Um...” Draco was surprised, and looked at Harry’s face to make sure he wasn’t joking. “Of course!”
She had a pitying look on her face—Draco couldn’t stand it. “Mr. Malfoy, your parents have been sent to Azkaban.”
—everyone else walked in to find a surprise.
“Yeah,” Draco said, sitting on Harry’s much more messy bed. “I’m really sorry. I’ve never had real friendships or a relationship, and now that I have both, it’s hard to balance. It’s probably seemed like I’ve been ignoring you lot when that’s the last thing I want to do.”
Another long pause.
Draco wasn’t sure what to do. He could approach Greg and try to win him back over. Looking around the platform, he didn’t see any of the other “eighth-year” Slytherins. He decided to board the train a little early, hoping for an empty compartment. He went for the one toward the back, shut the door, and pulled down the shade. He hoisted his trunk on the top shelf with difficulty and collapsed into the seat, taking comfort sitting down. Trying to keep his breathing even was an embarrassing challenge. Draco wondered if this was the furthest he had walked and the most active he had been since the Battle.
“Shush.” Draco clasped his icy hand over Harry’s mouth. “You’re going to give away our position. We’ve only got five minutes, I reckon, before the ambush.”
“I’ve heard that before. And said it.”
“Look for yourself,” Potter said gently. He grabbed Draco’s hand and lifted up his sleeve. Draco was too relieved to be mortified that Potter saw the pale outline of his Dark Mark. The scar was just as faded as normal—he was not back. Draco nearly giggled, feeling giddy.
“You hurt him, and you’ll have to answer to us.”
Draco nodded. “Alright,” Blaise put his hands on his knees. “Let’s get some lunch. And yes, you’re coming, Draco.”
Draco was surprised to find the liquid delicious—it was hot chocolate with a lot of sugar. He felt a little more energized, and his world stabilized a little as he looked at Harry. He couldn’t meet Hermione’s eyes. “How in the world did you find me?”
Draco barely had time to be nervous or dawdle in getting ready. The Ministry official was early and seemed very impatient to get his job done. He fastened a manacle on Narcissa’s wrist that seemed to be the brother of the one on Draco’s. Draco wasn’t sure why Narcissa didn’t have one to begin with, but assumed that no magic, except for possibly that exclusive to house elves, could be done inside the Manor. There was no way for him to test his theory, but that was the simplest explanation. Once everything was secured, Narcissa was still a little slow on her feet, and Draco stood between her and the official. The stern man seemed so irritated that he looked ready to drag Narcissa down the steps of the Manor.
you.”
Potter was sitting at the armchair when Draco walked in, but turned around at the sight of him and stood. “Hi. I know—it isn’t really ideal for me either.” Draco wasn’t sure what sort of an expression he was wearing at the moment, but clearly it reflected some of his disgust and horror at the thought of sharing a room with Potter for a whole year. “But I was thinking—after my little bout of anger earlier—that we should make the best of it. Of course,” he said, moving closer to Draco. “I won’t tolerate any hatred from anybody. Not toward you, not toward Hermione, not toward Muggle-borns or purebloods. We’ve dealt with too much of that already. We don’t have to be friends, but everyone has to be decent people this year. So, what do you think?” Harry extended his hand to Draco.
“I’m—pardon me?” People who weren’t of pure blood had before called Draco lucky, mostly for his wealth, but Draco wasn’t sure that described any situation in which he and Mr. Burke currently found themselves.
Harry looked surprised. “Yeah. I mean you know, he was a werewolf and all. It’s stupid to remember him from just a potion, but I think about him all the time. And everyone else.”
How do you guys want Draco and Harry’s first kiss to go? Anything else you want to see? All comments are appreciated. I love you all!
The following Sunday, Draco didn’t let on that anything was wrong, with Harry or with his friends. They were finishing up breakfast in the Great Hall, with Harry having been there for two hours already after eating with his friends. Greg and Harry were chatting amicably about defensive spells, and Draco participated in the conversation as much as he could stomach. Then, cold liquid spilled down his back.
“They really are family to me.” Harry continued telling Draco about his first experiences at the Burrow, and how he felt that the small and cramped house was the most perfect place in the entire world. He talked about how protective Mrs. Weasley was, often to a fault, of him, and how special it made him feel. How he thought that no one was going to show up for him at the Triwizard Tournament, but that the Weasleys were there. As Draco listened, planting kisses on his cheek whenever a drop of water would fall there, he felt like he finally knew what to do.
“Wait here. I’m going to retrieve the prisoners.” Yarney took himself and his Patronus outside of the room and locked Draco in.
“Ah,” she set the paper down and lowered her spectacles. “There has been a misunderstanding, Mr. Malfoy. This is not an optional task. All of you eighth years are very close to my heart, and I know that the past year has been extremely trying for most of you. I want to hold you all to the same educational expectations as any NEWT student, but I cannot do that without knowing that you are getting assistance with the healing process.”
As soon as four figures entered the tent with ease, Draco knew it was one of the enchanted ones that wizards often carted around to sporting events. The inside had plenty of practices areas as well as places to lounge. It was still no larger than the eighth year common room, but sufficient for the size of the group. Draco was sat in a hard wooden chair, and the members of Dumbledore’s Army stood off to the side. Draco recognized Zacharias Smith, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Dean Thomas, and a few other younger students whose faces he recognized but could not name. Ginny stood directly in front of Draco with her arms crossed. They all sat in silence for a few moments, which unnerved Draco more than anything else.
“I’ll tell you what I’m going through, then,” the heat wasn’t helping Draco’s anger. “This is literally the last place on Earth I want to be right now and the last thing I want to be doing, but I don’t have a choice because if I don’t sit here and talk to you, I might get chucked into Azkaban along with my parents. I wouldn’t even care if I got sent to Azkaban, but I don’t want them to punish my mother even more. So once again, I’m trapped in a goddamn room, and everyone’s acting like I have a choice in the matter even though I don’t. I never have. Even now that the war’s over, it’s like I’m out of the frying pan and into the fire,” Draco stopped to catch his breath, having ranted without taking one. He closed his eyes and clenched his fist. He felt as though he could feel the Fiendfyre inside the room.
Approaching their dormitory, Draco stopped Harry in the middle of telling a tale. “H—Harry?” He used his first name again, testing it out. “Are we...er...would you say that we’re...” he wasn’t sure why he needed confirmation that their relationship was truly going in a positive direction. Everything was so unsure right now, and there were so few people available that could clarify his most muddled thoughts. Perhaps a friendship with Potter of all people would be something he could hold onto. A failure from his youth that he could finally correct. But asking the question itself felt as humiliating as it did in first year. “Are we...alright?” Draco finally settled on a lesser question than the one he really wanted to ask.
Draco looked before him and almost felt sorry for the ragtag bunch. Clearly Harry did not know about this—he couldn’t have. If he did, they would be better suited for an actual interrogation. Draco was still not bound to the chair. Some of the younger teens with the group were trembling. Only Weaslette invoked any real fear in him. He knew that she tortured him only a few days ago, and she would probably do it again if she got the chance. “So ask your questions,” he said stiffly.
“Certainly worth it,” Draco said through chattering teeth. “Although I do wish we would have won.” The combined strength of the Ravenclaws and the Slytherins, with Draco having put himself on the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff team, had overpowered even the Boy Who Lived, who had to fix his glasses at least ten times throughout the course of the nearly two hour match.
As he passed through the crowd searching for a place to lay low, parents were thankfully mostly distracted. Some turned their child away and clasped them to their chests, glaring at Draco as he passed. Some looked at him as though they were aware they knew him (probably from the cover of
“Not just any lizard,” Blaise said through laughter. “A bearded dragon. It’s native to Australia. Get it? Since your mom calls you dragon? It’s hilarious.”
Draco wasn’t around to hear Potter’s finished thought. He had a hunch that the moving star he saw in the night sky was actually the Snitch. Hearing Potter right on his tail, Draco finally spotted it. His heart rate increased and he tried not to wobble as he dove downward after the pesky ball. He was so close, and could hear the commotion of the small crowd as he and Potter flew back toward the ground. The Snitch leveled out, preventing them both from diving straight into the pitch at the last second. Stretching out his left arm, Draco leaned forward, fingers barely grazing the object—
“We made a deal with the house elves who clean the Owlry...it doesn’t really matter. The point is, we’re not going to let you bring You-Know-Who back. We’re not going to let you trick Potter.”
“Potter, you could ask me anything you want and there’s nothing I would be able to do about it. I quite literally can’t hurt you, remember?” Draco held up his manacled arm.
“You’re no son of mine,” Lucius growled. His eyes looked a little glassy and unfocused but his anger clearly ran deep. “I bet you’re happy, aren’t you? Now you’ve got access to the Malfoy fortune. I bet this is what you’ve wanted this whole time. Pouting all summer like some sort of a child. You’ve always been pathetic, but I gave you so many chances to prove me wrong. And now you’ve put your mother and I in prison.” Lucius laughed. “Maybe you aren’t as stupid as I thought you were.”
“It wouldn’t matter.” Draco was avoiding the question. “They don’t want to hear my apologies, they want...I don’t know, they want me to suffer I guess.”
Draco scoffed. “Whatever, Potter. You were always a sap.”
“Two things: first, I have a note from Professor McGonagall for you.” Draco’s eyes narrowed as he took the note. He cast it aside, having a sinking feeling he knew what it was about. “Second, I was wondering if you could help me with the Potions homework sometime this weekend.”
Draco was legitimately about to snap back his usual “None of your business, Potter,” but thanks to this new professor it was entirely Harry’s business. He sighed and ran his hand along the back of his neck. “I don’t know. I’m decent at a lot of things, not sure if I’m particularly good at anything.”
“Well.” He started, and sighed. He could do this. Maybe it would make things better, sharing a bit. “I’m sure you all have noticed that I tend to have...flashbacks, I think they’re called.” Granger nodded knowingly. “I know that I wasn’t...in danger in the same way that you all were. I know that. But I wasn’t out of danger either—“
lately?”
“I’m surprised you had the guts to tell us yourself. Dear,” Lucius said, turning to Narcissa. “Our son is not only perverted, but he is fraternizing with our mortal enemy.”
“Mrs. Malfoy, is it true that your husband deliberately gave Theodore Nott Sr. the Time Turner—“
“When was the Time Turner last in your possession?”
“But this is the first step. You’re going to do it.” Harry looked at Draco with such certainty and determination. Draco
. But then he remembered that he was forced into signing up for a Mind Healer appointment. He felt a pit in his stomach. Didn’t anyone understand that reliving everything was not going to help him in the slightest, but could very well destroy him? He just wanted to be in peace. He could recover on his own time, his own way. He didn’t want everyone interfering like this, whatever their intentions.
“I do still mean to talk to Kingsley about your band there, though,” Harry said, nodding to the manacle on Draco’s wrist.
“No, it’s not even that. She’s right. I don’t want to live dishonestly.”
Draco gave a small laugh, remembering making fun of Potter endlessly over that. “I guess you’re right. I probably wouldn’t have even made fun of you if I wasn’t so...” he sighed.
Draco felt anger surge in him. Why was Professor Dumbledore all of a sudden concerned about him? The old man knew exactly what Draco was trying to do for the entirety of sixth year and never bothered to reach out for help.
He dropped it like it was a burning hot pan, and his heart dropped with the package. “Where the hell did you get this,” he growled. Things were getting serious now.
“I say we wait a few minutes so he’s far enough away, then we leave too. We don’t need to be here,” Blaise said, angrily taking a bite of his turkey leg.
“You’re really not,” Draco said. “To be honest, we’re just getting to know each other anyway.”
“Oh. Well, thanks,” Draco said as Harry left. For some inexplicable reason, he held the blanket to his face and smelled it. Potter’s lingering scent served to give him some sort of comfort...horrified with himself, Draco shook his head and threw the blanket to the side.
“Who exactly is ‘us’?” No one answered, but Draco was pulled up roughly by someone and marched toward the Forbidden Forest.
Draco knew that Harry avoided the
“That’s really nice, Draco. Thank you.”
“Why?”
He clenched and unclenched his fist in frustration. How would he be expected to act in front of Harry? Would they hold hands in the hallway? Would Harry tell anyone, or would he want to keep their relationship a secret? For once in his life Draco had fully stepped onto a new path. Asking Harry on a date sure was a step in that direction, but he could have always gone backward. Now, he couldn’t undo what he did without risking one of his greatest friends. And he was pretty sure he would never want to do that.
“Potter, while I dislike the arrogance that your presence brings out in others, I also dislike people not taking credit where it is due. There’s no way the Dark Lord could have been defeated without you; the specific decisions that you made, and the specific actions that you took. Sure, other people probably helped, but ultimately it was you who did the deed. And...” Draco looked at the beaming Harry. “And I’m grateful.”
Reaching an internal compromise with himself, Draco gave the letter to Greg, the only one who looked skeptical at the prospect of Draco handing it over to the Ministry. “Burn it.”
Draco Malfoy was not unused to bad weeks. Or weeks during which he knew he would suffer enormously at the end. Or weeks that built up to something awful happening.
dead?” It was something Draco had suspected after seeing Aunt Bellatrix throw a dagger at the apparating elf, but he hadn’t heard it confirmed.
“I’m not supposed to master anything today, we still have a whole month before we have to present! Your turn. Sit down,” he said firmly.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Madame Pomfrey tutted as she noticed he was awake. “It’s good to see that you’re up.” She brought him a steaming cup of hot chocolate. “Drink up, this will help with the residual effects from the Dementors.”
“Psh. I’d prefer someone who didn’t care, or even didn’t know who I was.” They were both silent for a few moments. Draco began to move to get ready for bed. “Draco—thanks. It feels good to talk this out. I appreciate it.”
“That was never going to be an option.”
“My gran told me that the Ministry requires a blood sample now to make sure no one is using glamours or Polyjuice Potion,” Neville added. “But we didn’t need any of that in fifth year...”
“It’s a big deal!” Draco said, taking mild offense at Harry’s nonchalant tone. “I’m not even supposed to be outside Hogwarts grounds, let alone Diagon Alley a few days before my parents’ trial! We have to go.”
Draco wakes up from the Hospital Wing and decides that he needs to see Harry immediately.
The Manor house elf, Tilly, was busy making a breakfast Draco knew he would not eat. When Draco’s family returned home after the Battle of Hogwarts, Tilly was the only Manor house elf that had not ran away. The Dark Lord had enslaved the creatures, not Lucius, and so when their master died they were not magically bound to the Manor. He wasn’t sure why Tilly stayed behind when the others left, and he didn’t have nearly as much interaction with her as he did with Dobby. He wasn’t even sure his old house elf and playmate had survived after Aunt Bellatrix...and afterward...
