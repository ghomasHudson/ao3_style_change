His smile was wicked now, predatory almost as he watched Harry’s cock jerk, his balls drawing up tighter to his body. He was close again.
They had always managed to get under each other’s skin, Potter especially so when he was acting all righteous and Gryffindor-ish (Draco still couldn’t truly fathom how he’d ended up in the den of one), only now they had a more enjoyable outlet for their frustrations.
Harry’s abdominal muscles twitched and tensed, and Draco revelled in the needy little mewls spilling over Harry’s lips. He could feel Harry’s balls tightening up beneath the tips of his fingers, and just like that he retracted his hand again.
Harry was panting again, chest heaving and his body feebly trying to buck up into Draco’s, his cock itching for the friction the contact promised. And Draco knew it wouldn’t take long this time around.
“You see, Harry,” he said over the lewd gasps now tumbling freely over Harry’s lips. “The lube was as much part of your gift as the plug was.”
He leaned down so his face was hovering above his lovers, cupped Harry’s cheek with one hand and used his other hand to line himself up with the wet heat of Harry’s lubed up arse. The tip of his cock twitched as it brushed against the warm rim of muscle, eager to plunge inside.
Harry was panting now, sweating and quivering against his hold, his hands clenching and unclenching on the soft fabric. His eyes were glazed; his pupils heavily dilated with only a slim ring of green remaining at the edges.
Some might call it possessiveness, but Draco didn’t care. Now that he finally had Harry, he wasn’t inclined to let go of him any time soon.
“D-dra- Ah,” Harry mewled, his body writhing and trembling away as the plug nudged against his prostate.
His eyes raked over the pliant body splayed out in front of him. And what a pretty sight Harry made. Naked and spread wide, those green eyes hazy with pleasure, his skin glistening in the orange hue of the candles floating above them. He looked absolutely debauched, like a feast ready to be devoured.
Not that Draco minded… too much. The eagerness had been welcome, and quite understandable given today’s…
Harry shuddered at a particularly well-aimed thrust, his thighs flexing and causing his insides to twitch and clench around Draco’s cock.
His throat went dry at the sight, but instead of focusing on the lube slowly dribbling out of Harry’s arse and how good it would look like replaced with his come, his gaze flicked upwards again to the mess he’d reduced Harry to.
Harry’s hands twitched in frustration against the bindings holding him captive, a needy little whimper escaping him, and Draco couldn’t help but revel in the sound.
“You like the feeling of your arse so nice and full? To have your hole fucked wide open and gaping, don’t you Harry?”
And while Draco would deny it until his last, dying breath, he secretly relished in the intimacy and trust that went hand in hand with these scenes. It wasn’t just Harry that made himself vulnerable. Draco did too.
“It adjusts, love,” Draco said, arousal heavy in his tone. “It adjusts itself to your deepest desires.”
Weaving his hands into midnight tresses he tilted Harry’s head to the side and pressed his lips back against his lovers. He felt almost feverish with his desire for the man, his hips thrusting steadily, jerking forward and burying himself once more as he traced the outline of Harry’s lips with his tongue.
“Ple-ase, Draco,” Harry mewled, desperation tingeing his voice at the delicious friction, his own hips trying feebly to roll upwards, frantic to feel Draco’s cock against his own. “Give it to mmh, me.”
Shifting back, Draco slipped out of the glorious heat until nothing but the tip of his cock rested inside.  Harry let out a shuddering whine at the feeling, bereft of Draco’s cock, his hole twitching feebly, his fingers frantically digging into the fabric around his wrists. Draco only waited a moment - could only wait a moment - before he had to plunge back inside, a soft growl falling over his lips as he bent down to mouth against sweat-covered flesh, unable to take his hands off the man beneath him.
, sent a shiver of such fierce arousal through his body that he had to take a deep breath to steady himself.
Lewd moans and muffled whines echoed through the room now, increasing in their urgency as the plug kept up its steady pace.
He rolled his hips forward, his cockhead nudging against Harry’s hole and leaving a slick trail of precome around the ring, before he finally,
Draco shook his head, amused. “And they call me spoiled,” he muttered, but settled back down, his head now propped up on one elbow.
The lube was effectively spelled to change temperatures according to the user’s wishes, and right now he’d gifted Harry heat. Not quite blazing yet, but hot enough to leave his skin pink and tingling, sensitive to any ensuing touch.
Harry all but cried out when Draco nailed his prostate head-on, unadulterated pleasure wrecking through both of them as Harry clenched and twitched in his hold.
. He licked his lips at the mental image the thought conjured, tracing the phantom touch Harry’s tongue had left behind before focusing his attention back on the situation at hand.
And Harry was shivering, shuddering in Draco’s arms, so weak and vulnerable, all desperate for his release. Tears were flowing freely now, stifled little renditions of Draco’s name gasped between panted breaths.
Draco flicked his wrist and murmured a spell, watching with avid satisfaction as Harry’s entire body suddenly jolted upwards, tensing and shivering as a lascivious moan was torn from his throat.
“It’s truly a devilish little thing, don’t you think so too, Harry? A clever invention, really. Did you figure it out yet? Do you realize why it’s giving you exactly what you need?”
“Such a good boy,” Draco hummed; pressing another gentle kiss to Harry’s panting lips. He discarded his clothes eagerly, a hiss escaping him as those wretched pants tugged on his straining erection. He hastily fumbled with the fabric, allowing his cock to finally spring free from its woeful confines.
“You’re mine, aren’t you, Harry?” he moaned, the fire scorching through his veins threatening to overwhelm. “All mine to fuck as I please.”
A thin sheen of sweat covered Harry’s skin, his body taut with pleasure, his cock twitching feebly between Draco’s fingers almost as if it was throbbing along with the warmth scorching through his body. Precome was leaking freely now, and Draco could tell that Harry was getting closer and closer with each stifling minute he kept up his teasing.
Bending down, he let his lips ghost lightly over Harry’s, before trailing tiny little kisses all over Harry’s jaw, his throat and down to his collarbone, marking any skin he could find, all the while whispering sweet nothings into damp flesh.
Harry was outright sobbing now, writhing frantically on the sheets, his cock twitching and bobbing as his release was denied. Pleasure seemed to threaten to overwhelm him but instead of having mercy, Draco started rubbing against Harry’s frenulum again.
Draco smiled at the sight and then leaned down to gather the man into his arms, pressing a gentle kiss on top of the mop of black hair he used to abhor. Harry all but curled into his hold and pulled him closer. A soft sound escaped him when Draco shifted him to his side and tugged him firmly against his chest, leaving barely any space in between them. He needed this as much as Harry did.
“Yes. Yes, yours!” Harry’s back arched into his touch, his legs twitching almost as if he was trying to wrap them around him, refusing to let him stray too far.
He gave his lover a moment to catch his bearings, knowing that the added sensations were a lot to take in. It wasn’t just the lube he had so carefully and strategically placed on Harry’s body – no, the plug had been spelled to release it all day long, whenever Harry had needed it.
Nimble fingers reached down to take hold of Harry’s cock, squeezing ever so slightly as Harry’s body arched frantically into the touch, all but attempting to buck into his hold, delirious in his need. Spurred on, Draco’s hips jerked faster, harder, stuttering out of rhythm as he pressed his cock as deep as it would go, the movement of his hand never ceasing.
With a few last stuttered thrusts he buried himself deep inside of Harry and came, a loud groan muffled into Harry’s collarbone as he spilled himself. Every muscle in his body clenched in euphoric pleasure, the warm walls of Harry’s arse milking his twitching cock dry.
“Surely others must have noticed,” he continued his earlier train of thought, imagining what Harry must have looked like during the day. Flushed and squirming behind his desk, desperately trying to maintain the mask of stoicism befitting of the Head Auror.
And yet, Draco’s pace remained unchanged. Despite the frenzied desire lurking within him, he didn’t let it rule the roll of his hips. No, he was taking his sweet time with Harry, savouring him.
He could see how glazed over Harry’s eyes were, so he cupped Harry’s cheek, fingers trailing lightly and soothingly over the soft skin as he patiently waited for Harry’s eyes to meet his.
Tugging on the rounded flesh, his fingers trailed upwards again, never applying pressure, always light and teasing in their touch. He settled his index finger beneath Harry’s glans, right over his frenulum and gently started rubbing, the motions firm and controlled.
Sweat was beading on his forehead now, and he broke their heated kiss to stare at the man beneath him. Harry in turn, tried to press their bodies closer together, arching his spine in a feeble attempt to get friction on his cock. Eager for anything he could get.
His mouth latched onto Harry’s throat again, his tongue swiping over the marks he’d previously left behind, sucking and nibbling possessively on his pulse point as moan after moan escaped his lover’s lips.
“Dra-a-co,” Harry sobbed, his muscles clenching around the toy. His skin was flushed, his cock throbbing where it was pressed against Draco’s trousers, and Draco could hear the exact moment when the plug shrunk yet again, Harry’s desolate whine echoing in the room around them.
“I-“ His gut churned as he tried to find the words. Deep down he knew what this was about, he just hadn’t realized that it was bothering him so much. He’d gone further today than he ever had with Harry. Had edged him for longer, pushed him to his limits, and a part of him feared that it had been too much.
With a quick movement of his wrist, he released the cockring and watched as Harry all but threw his head back into the pillows, eyes shut tight as he convulsed in Draco’s arms, spurting hot seed all over their heaving chests, ribbon of ribbon of white being fucked straight out of him.
Harry sobbed, and went down on Josh’s cock like it was the single most important thing in the world, his whole face changing into pure deliverance. Josh groaned loudly.
Malfoy placed his legs on the leather, parting them to his will. Harry turned his head to the side, smelling the leather. It was slick with his sweat, after all he’d been strapped there for what looked like hours. He felt completely exposed like this, to everyone watching, but especially to Malfoy. This way, Malfoy could fuck him better, not having to worry about lifting his weight and for Harry it would be more comfortable too. Instead of feeling the urge to hide, he felt that this was right. This was what he wanted all along. To be spread out for Malfoy to use him.
The way Harry responded to his voice was overwhelming. He swayed on the spot, his shoulders trembled. Wild traces of magic emanated from him, raw. Draco fucking loved this brand of uncontrolled magic.
‘You get to use me here. Then you can...’ he hesitated, searching Draco’s face. Whatever he saw there made him decide.
I can’t take the sight of those eyes, so I stalk away to his kitchen. Everything looks the same as I remember. Cozy, warm. The big table is there, with the sugar bowl on it. He must have fixed it, then. The first time I had him was here. I was drunk, he was bleeding from a cut on his lip and before I knew it we were kissing, his blood and tongue in my mouth, his hands pressing me against the counter, his cock hard against my thigh. When he asked me to bend him over the table and fuck him to oblivion, I did. It was brilliant. I slammed inside him, with close to no preparation, making the sugar bowl topple and shatter on the table. I fucked him over the sugar grains, and he came screaming, his come splattering over the sugar. The sight of it, together with his cry ringing in my ears, gave me the best orgasm of my life.
There were hands on his thighs and a warm breath over his cock. Then Malfoy took him whole inside his wet mouth.
Something personal: I'm 3 years into therapy and my therapist is amazing. So is Mirna, but Harry doesn't know it yet. :)
He takes one step forward, his fingers flex uncomfortably at his sides. He looks at the lonely cup of tea on the table. Then at you again.
I know this is fucked-up. There’s a part of me that craves being needed by him when he’s weak. And another part that wants to get lost in him when the alcohol can take the blame for my actions. At least when I’m fucking him I feel like someone wants me with everything that I am, all my fuck-ups, the damned mark in my arm, the tainted family name. He wants me like that, and for some unhealthy reason I need that to come from a place of pain and not love.
‘I came here to kindly ask you to fuck me,’ I say, my voice in its usual drawl. I set the bowl on the counter. It clinks brightly between us. ‘Since I can’t seem to get you out of my system, I might as well get you in. Deep.’
I thought I’d be alone here, but I noticed him on the first night. I suppose I could have gone somewhere else. But like all the things between me and him, it became a question of pride. The last shred of it.
I swallow the last of my drink, allowing for it to fire down my throat, right as Potter laughs in my ear, light & easy, and signals the bartender with two fingers up. New glasses are set between us.
There’s still no tongue in our kiss. We’ve been so many things, but this is unlike anything I imagined us to be. He drags his lips over mine. I do the same, and it’s slow and a bit maddening because I know he’s holding back. I can sense it in the way he tenses against me, in the undercurrent of his magic going all over the place in a way that I kind of love.
Pans always comes with me. For her it’s not about the dance. Her coping mechanism is shagging. A different woman every night. Tonight it’s probably the cute girl with curly hair dancing so close to her there’s barely a hair’s breadth of space between them. Pans looks happy; she too changed a lot in a few months.
I quickly find out that he has nightmares too. Both about the War and about that awful night. The reason I know the difference is that when it’s about that night he wakes up screaming, drenched in sweat and he locks himself up in the bathroom. When he comes back, he just lies down next to me, curls up on one side, his arms and legs drawn up, his head bowed forward and then he pulls the covers over us both. He doesn’t say a thing. But his fingers find mine in the dark. I hold them like I’m holding an invisible string of a balloon, something I could lose with a slight rust of wind. It’s a feeling I can’t explain, but so strong it takes over me. When that happens, I can’t quite breathe.
Malfoy’s jaw tensed minutely, his smirk forming thin lines on his face. Harry wouldn’t have noticed any of this if he wasn’t completely enraptured by Draco.
‘Yes, Draco, please.’ Harry looked otherworldly submissive, like something taken from Draco’s dreams.
actually means yes, and I’m glad he gets it. He picks me up and my legs wrap around him and then he’s walking us out of the kitchen, towards the stairs.
Draco stopped in front of it, his hand around his shaft. He gave a it a pull, the tip nearly brushing Harry’s lips. He noticed the way Harry kept from leaning in, from doing anything else than wait in place. Draco gathered the slick at the tip of his cock. Harry’s chest heaved, his hot breath ghosting over Draco’s cock.
Harry’s arms came up freely around Draco’s neck, pulling him closer and he forgot everything. He forgot about the War and the night terrors he still had, he forgot about his daily routine of fighting evil, he forgot about the club, the late nights at bars, the dates gone wrong, the feeling that his life was going nowhere and was always more of the same, day after day, until he was driven under by someone, the only meaningful part of his weeks. But he also forgot about those someones, those other nights. There was only Draco’s taste, mingled with his own. A long moan was coming out of his mouth into Draco’s, he felt drunk on Draco’s taste and scent and his tongue dared out of his mouth, searching Draco’s. He was allowed in.
‘You’re so fucking noble, Harry James Potter,’ I bite the words out, throwing them at his face. ‘I don’t want you to keep away, I fucking want you to fight for me, can’t you see it?’
Tonight, he takes his time. He likes to leave me hanging. Maybe that’s what tells him I’m real. Desserts come and go. People go out to smoke, come back with laughs. Someone asks me something and I answer it. He watches me. No one looks at me like he does. Like he can take all of me.
She eyes him amusedly, then turns her smile to me. She knows she’s interrupting. She also knows she’s right about me and him. A Pansy who is right is an impossible Pansy.
I can see in his face that he really believes what he’s saying. He believes I whored my way into the Death Eater ranks and then out of the War. It’s what he was expecting of me all this time.
His lips parted for Draco to slip his tongue inside. They kissed again, hands going everywhere. Draco grabbed Harry’s hips, fingers tightening there as they kissed, his cock rubbing against Harry’s stomach, and they were moving, Harry slightly kneeling over him on the couch, the muscles on his thighs flexing under Draco’s hands. Harry pressed his hips forward, trapping Draco’s cock between them.
‘I was waiting for us to be alone,’ he admitted, a long breath rushing out of him. Merlin, he wanted Harry to make him lose it, he felt so close already.
I don’t even let him finish. I’m on him, his back to the wall, my everything against his whole body. We’ve been this close only three times before.
I turn away, not waiting for a reaction. I don’t need one. He will follow me, I know it at my very core.
Now that you won’t have it, you realise you were only here for the faint chance of going home with him. Your mouth has a bitter taste. The witch he was talking to is deep in conversation with Hermione. Maybe he left with someone else. He didn’t try to catch your eye like usual.
So of course one day I wake up, hungover & plastered on my sofa, to find my best friend standing in the middle of my living room, gazing down at me. I blink & try to get up. I only manage to curl awkwardly on the sofa. Again I question my decision of allowing Pansy to Apparate directly into my home. I guess it’s the sort of privilege that comes with the best friends package.
‘A cockslut like him, refusing cock so freely given?’  he asked. A sadistic laugh bubbled in his chest. It got out a second later.  ‘I don’t buy it.’
Instead he drops his forehead to mine, lips sliding soft & sweet over mine. He breathes me in & I’m shaking, his stubble rubbing my cheek & then his mouth covers mine. It isn’t like any other kiss. It is slow, drawn out of me like something I would never let show, but can’t stop. I moan inside his mouth & he answers me with a strangled groan. It is wrong, so wrong, to kiss him like this. My hands are now free to cradle his face. My fingers brush his hair. I wanted sex, I wanted surrender, I wanted him to overpower me, to make me feel like I can’t escape him, like I’m not in control & he has done it, but it’s all wrong. He’s giving me the sort of kiss that drifts into smaller, much more dangerous kisses. It’s the sort of kiss shared between lovers. Every time he eases back he looks at me with those haunted eyes, scared & hopeful.
Whatever it was, it set Harry to motion. His mouth crashed over Draco’s, his hands pushing them flush together, another delicious sound leaking out of his mouth, a moan that built up around Draco as he let Harry take control of the kiss, of the pace, of
‘No,’ Harry scrambled for purchase on the sheets, his fingers tightening hard. His eyes were on Draco’s. ‘I… I want.’
Harry knew he had heard him. He just wanted Harry to say it again. Out loud. Now that he wasn’t blindfolded, he couldn’t admit he wanted to be fucked by Draco Malfoy. Everything felt more real like this, like he couldn’t hide from his own deepest desires, like Malfoy could see through him.
He laughs. Then he turns his back on me and opens another cabinet, taking a small flask and setting it on the table. The fucking hangover potion. He’s not making me drink that, I’ll fucking throw it at his face.
I ring the doorbell and count the idents on his old door. I’m purposefully not thinking of him. It’s 3 a.m. Maybe he has someone warming his bed. He must have. Maybe he’s not even in. Maybe he’s sleeping on another bed. With another. I can still go back to my apartment, take a hungover potion and Sleeping Draught and sleep myself into another day. No one will have to know of this momentary lapse in judgement. No one will have to know that on the first night in  months that I go out to pull, I leave the bar where I’m supposed to be dancing and grinding against nameless men and instead come here. Pansy can’t know. She already thinks I’m a hopeless case.
Harry trembled at the sound of his name and that voice. He couldn’t move, the only thing he could feel was the gentle caress of Draco’s hands on his left leg, up and down, soothing, so gentle after all the pain, almost caring…
The hand climbs up an inch; it’s on my leg. It’s warm and assured and still careful, like it doesn’t want to take too much too fast.
Draco loved this shyness of his. It showed up as easily as it broke and turned to total shamelessness.
I guess that’s part of the reason I come to this place. It stops my favourite train of thought. All the ways I could be gone. All the ways I can end it.
I know I’ll be broken, in the same way I know the startling fact of his tongue parting my lips, sliding into my mouth. His hands go around my neck, he pulls me gently down to him. My heart clenches in a painful way, everything sways, dissolves around me, nothing beyond the hard fact of him — as he kisses me for the first time, fire & whisky on his tongue.
He let one of his fingers trail down Harry’s neck. Even the barest of touches was like a jolt up his arm. Harry strangled a moan when Draco pulled his hand away.
It’s the first thing that comes to your mind. His mouth clicks shut, but he’s waiting for you to say something, anything. You try to order your thoughts.
The thought eased itself softly into Draco’s mind. The fucking bastard. What the hell was he doing, opening his mind up like that, lowering all defences?
‘She thinks you like me too. And then I thought… she’s always right, isn’t she? ‘Cause she’s quite sure of it.’
‘Can’t control yourself with cock in your mouth?’ Draco asked, the sharp tone in his voice making Harry open his eyes. He wasn’t defiant now. He had the glazed, lost look of perfect submission, as he nodded in answer, his mouth too filled with cock to do much else.
I hate that she always says his name like this. I can practically hear the italics on it. But whatever, she’s right. I don’t know when it all went wrong. When did sex became this enormous thing opening up to the abyss?
‘How are your hands? Do you feel any tingling?’ Malfoy touched his wrists, pulling on the bounds to make sure they weren’t cutting up his circulation. ‘And your ankles? Is everything okay?’
My fingers twist in the air. The door locks, his body jerks against mine. My magic is a turn-on for him, I realise. My wrist moves again, the silencing spell building up a wall around us.
It’s a desperate whisper. I have no idea what he’s begging me for. He brings his fingers to my face. His touch is no longer sexual, but something else. Something I can’t allow myself to feel for him. I bat his hand away, protection & cleaning spells fast on the tip of my tongue. I lift my hips up. I don’t want any lube, I want the burn & the ache. I sink down on his cock. It takes several tries, it’s messy, it hurts, but I don’t care for any of it. I want to feel him. I want my body to remember this.
He makes a startled sound. His pupils blown wide. Endless green. I can feel his heartbeat under my fingers, over his neck. Frantic.
He watched as a man came up to Josh, speaking in his ear. The man wanted Harry, of course. Anyone with the smallest hint of good taste would. Josh simply shook his head, refusing the offer with a sly smile. Draco tried not to think of the satisfaction that gave him.
You nod your agreement, quite suddenly thankful to her, even if you don’t exactly know why. Ron gives you a contrary look, but you lose track of the conversation.
Harry blinked up at him. He inhaled deeply with his eyes closed. When he opened them he was there, fully present, and Draco stared into those eyes and lost his breath. It was so strange to look at Harry when they were both just two men again, equals, nothing else.
Josh placed a hand on his chin and lifted it up for the other man’s inspection. Josh’s finger brushed over his lower lip and Harry’s tongue darted out to lick it. He liked other men to see how good he was to his Dom. How obedient. How willing to please. He sucked on Josh’s finger slowly, taking it into his mouth. He was so aware of the man’s eyes on him, his cock was throbbing. Josh let out a low laugh. The other man was silent. There was something familiar about his particular trace of magic, but Harry couldn’t quite place it.
‘And how do you plan on doing that?’ I ask, cold seeping into my voice, my body. ‘You don’t even want to be seen with me.’
‘I’m sorry, Malfoy,’ his voice was hoarse. He sounded like he’d been fucked already. ‘Yes, I want to be so good for you. Use me, please,’ his dampened forehead dropped against the leather, as he tried to calm down his breathing.
‘You know I do… but you’re the one with the fancy clothes,’ he said, his fingers on Draco’s shirt buttons. He shuffled closer to Draco, his arms around Draco’s neck. ‘Was just taking care of you.’
They fell over the bed, Harry rising over him and they kissed, tangled in each other. He didn’t know if the play was still on, didn’t care for it really.
We’ve only shared a few handjobs up until now, but he’s made it pretty clear he wants more. He’s been trying to fuck me for weeks. I always end up distracting him with my hands, postponing it to never ever. I can tell he’s getting impatient. Yesterday, I let him come on my naked back. I felt so disgusted afterwards, it took me several cleaning spells and almost one hour in the showers to be rid of the feeling of his come on me.
Harry blinks. He looks so fucking sad I want to spit on his face just to make him have some sort of reaction.
He leaned over slightly, but made no move to touch Harry. The air crackled between them. He felt the energy thrumming on his fingernails.
‘You never dance,’ I say, easing the words out. ‘You never pull anyone and turn down everyone that tries to chat you up. You always leave alone.’
I realise that since this thing between us started, I never saw him in daylight. He’s wearing Muggle clothes, but they’re not his club clothes (skintight jeans, the even tighter shirts stretching nicely across his chest, his usual garb for picking up not-so-innocent blondes). Instead of those, he’s using plain clothes, maybe they’re his weekend, spend-time-with-his-friends type of clothes. I wouldn’t know. What I do know is that he looks good. His dark hair looks bright, even if as untidy as ever. The green in his eyes looks greener somehow. Maybe it has something to do with the turtle neck, cozy green sweater he is wearing. I can barely stand to look at him.
@ratherbehere, you're going to make an amazing editor for sure. This was a rollercoaster, your help was invaluable. Thank you for all your inputs, your honesty, your difficult questions, your thoroughness, you long emails. You kept me focused and sharp during all this months.
Josh always took that moment to check their surroundings, noticing which men were enjoying their show the most and which he thought he and Harry would like. Harry had been feeling the men’s eyes on him, even with the blindfold on, buzzing on the skin of his exposed arse. Josh kept spanking him, just the exact amount of pain Harry craved for the beginning of the night, his body starting to warm up. Someone was watching him so intensely he felt himself harden from it. Josh noticed it too. He gave an appreciative hum and moved Harry, placing him on all fours on the floor. The air felt electrified. The man was really enjoying the display. Harry raised his arse in the air, wanting to give him the better angle. He felt magic prickling around him. So… this man was a wizard, and fuck fuck fuck, he loved it, that brand of magic on him, on his exposed, burning skin. It turned him fucking on.
The ground is a harsh black. My hands are so white, but they’re dirty, scratched everywhere. One of my nails is broken. I don’t remember when that happened. A drop of blood falls on my hand, red on white. My face hurts. Everything is ruined. Everything is dirty.
no longer feel familiar. Rain batters at the windows, thunder strikes. I used to feel safe here. Safer, anyway.
‘Nothing,’ he whispered. He couldn’t really say what was on his mind, without sounding like a fucking teenager with a crush. A crush on his Dom for the night. Really, that was ridiculous.
I made a list of all the things I didn’t want my therapist to know. I’m going to read it in our next session. Maybe, it will be fine. For the first time, there's a future for me to think about. I don't know what it will be. All I know is, whatever it is, I want him to be in it.
‘You fucker,’ I say, my voice low. He doesn’t seem worried. ‘If you’re not going to fuck me, I’m going to find someone who will. Tidy hair will fuck me.’
‘Then do it,’ Draco said, and purposely spread his legs more as he watched the intense change on Harry’s face, lips parting in a gasp. He looked doubtful.
That night, there’s something different about the way he fucks you. He’s fucked you hard and brutally many times before; he’s also been slow and gentle before. This time, he takes you hard and fast, no prep, your face down on the mattress. You’re surprised at how fast you both come. He then makes you lie on your back and works you open again with his fingers, sucking you until you feel like you’re floating out of your body. You come hard down his throat. You close your eyes just for a little while, your nose in his hair, his hands on your waist.
‘Show me how good you take it, Harry…’ Draco said, ignoring his own cock, and the spell and everything in favour of this desperate feeling of want and want and want.
I keep waiting for him to get up, to stand back against the opposite wall & wait for me to return the favour. I would too. I more than want to. But he does nothing of the sort. This would be the perfect time for me to sneer & say something caustic, but he’s still kneeling at my feet, looking up & I can’t think of a single thing to say, sarcastic or otherwise. His eyes avidly rake my body, starting at the tips of my shoes, climbing up my legs, sliding over my crotch, along my belly & chest & up my neck, only stopping when he finds me looking at him. So much for the pretence of anonymity. It’s like he’s binding us both to this memory. His mouth curves into a sweet smile. I realise that he is probably playing me, like he does with all of the others. The ones he drags home every night, making increasingly shrewd headlines in the next morning papers. The Golden Boy’s love life has proven to be an endless source of income for wizarding media all over Britain. Or rather, sex life — I don’t think love has much to do with it. I’ve just become another one of his conquests. I know this, but can’t make myself look away.
I don’t know how to go back to what we were about to do. But he does. His hand catches mine and he pulls me up, his arm wrapping around my waist. He moves against me. We’re in the middle of the street, but no one really cares.
You’re so speechless that you let him in without a word. He walks down the corridor, you follow him. You barely had time to look at his face. He’s standing in the middle of your living room, looking round at everything like he’s only now seeing it for the first time.
‘Do you want your arse filled with spunk?’ Draco asked, bending down, so that his lips were inches away from Harry’s.
Draco never rushed his scenes. He was known to be a very patient Dom, one who quite liked to take his time. He never overlooked details, like properly hydrating his submissives. Harry looked up at him, a drop of water trailing down his jaw.
Josh leaned forward and gripped Harry’s cock matter-of-factly, pumped it once, then left it. Harry shuddered, managing somehow to keep his balance and his eyes on Draco. Only his lips parted, a gasp escaping them, too close to the bulge on Draco’s trousers. What he wanted was so clear. Oh, but he was going to have to scream for it.
I can’t breathe. My hand finds his. He holds it. I let myself collapse, my face on his chest. My eyes fill with sudden tears and I remember that this is not the first time he’s seen me cry. But that moment in the bathroom is light years away. We were different people then. This time, I don’t hold back. I let myself feel the terror and helplessness. I should be embarrassed, ashamed, but I’m not. He holds me through it. He doesn’t say anything, he doesn’t try to fix me. He just holds me.
It’s not that I don’t want to. It is but simple force of habit. Believe me, I had my share of doubts about them getting married. But after a year of seeing them together, I’m prepared to admit I was wrong. Granger is the best thing to ever happen to Pansy. People have this idea that Pansy is a horrible person, but I wouldn’t be here without her. I’ll never have what she has, but I’m glad one of us is happy.
I lower my hand. We stare at each other in silence. There’s only the rain, and the yellow light around him. I mean to say something snarky; nothing comes out. The corridor where he stands sways in front of my eyes. I stumble inside and he catches me in his arms. There’s a rush of information short-circuiting my brain all at once. His hand on my hip, warm over my soaked jumper; the scent of strawberries and Firewhisky when my nose comes too close to his neck; his eyes like two pools of questions.
He nodded fervently. The idea of pleasing Malfoy with his body was a secret dirty fantasy coming to life. He felt Malfoy’s breath on his cheek. It was fresh and minty and Harry’s mouth watered. He imagined how it would be to have that taste on his lips. On his tongue.
‘You hate the pressure of it,’ he said, voice slow and determined, as his hand was. ‘You hate to be bossing everyone around. You hate that they all want something from you,’ that voice was driving him crazy, reaching inside him, taking him apart.
He didn’t look up, eyes fixed on Draco’s silver cuff buttons, glittering under the lights of the club. He refused to be aware of his surroundings - because if he did, if he saw the men watching them, if he saw Josh, he would be unable to go on.
He glances at me. It’s all right there in his eyes, the thing we never talk about. This thing that’s been happening for almost a year now, this thing that doesn’t have a name, this thing, right here, right now-
‘I’m sober,’ I say. ‘Thank you,’ it’s a whisper, but he hears it. I understand now Harry would never take advantage of me while I’m drunk. He would never, because, in fact, he… He really...
He has spent half an hour kissing me everywhere. On the nape of my neck. Over my clavicule. On the place where my hips meet my thighs, then on the place my thighs meet my arse. On the inside of my thighs. On the inside of my fucking elbows. Behind my knees. On my armpits, for fucks sake. I never knew anyone who got off on that, but he seems to like it, the same way he seems to like kissing me anywhere. Except on my mouth. He saves that for later.
‘Like what you see?’ Draco asked. His tone wasn’t so assured just now, it faltered slightly. It made Harry all the more dizzy and willing to show him just how much he liked everything about him.
The lights changed again and shined on Draco. Harry’s eyes raked his face, going down to his neck, to his chest, and lower still.
The blow came fast and sharp. Harry did not have the time to take in the change in sensation. He gasped. Malfoy’s hands were lighter than Josh’s, but completely unpredictable, the long fingers trailing over the burning skin of his arse, then kneading, then crashing over his skin. Heat spread over his arse, sweat trickled down his back. Malfoy’s hands fitted over his arse like they were meant to be there, like they belonged... Stupid thought. He was Malfoy’s just for one night.
I spent the night with him. And it wasn’t in a moody silence outside, in our secret spot, it was in his room, in his bed.
You know you’re not his first, nor will you be his last, but you can’t believe he looks like this to them too.
‘Not that it's any of your business, but you shouldn't believe everything you read in those magazines.’
My whole body is burning, my face all wet. I can hear my own heartbeat, a loud frantic beating against my ribs, like something about to burst out of control. And he hasn’t fucked me yet. This is what he does to me.
Here's the inspo for Draco's hair I used (for the colour, ignore the haircut): https://pin.it/vbjdeag2rhh6cb
Draco felt his own orgasm like a sure thing, only kept at bay by that twisted side of him that needed submissives to lose it before he did.
Someone decided I should have a private room. Most nights, she ends up in my bed. We fuck. She sleeps. Maybe that’s the real reason she comes here. To be able to sleep. I lean over to kiss her forehead. A crease of hurt is painted in the corner of her mouth. The irony of it all is that I can conquer death, but not this.
Draco chuckled. His hand came up to Harry’s jaw and forced it up. Harry was faced with hungry grey eyes on his, and he burned, heart frantic on his chest. Those eyes made anything worthy.
‘Draco is my best friend,’ she says, then stands up. I realise that this is the first time she’s saying something to me not out of spite or hate or even indifference. There is real care behind her words, even behind her usually unreadable eyes.
‘You should probably tell your best friend to stop enjoying the chase. He gets off on it. He always did.’
Then Josh gagged Harry. A thin stripe of black leather, with a red circle in the center. Harry’s mouth opened obediently to accommodate it.
You both finish the cigarettes in the same loaded silence. You wait for him to reach for his silver case again, but he doesn’t. He also doesn’t leave.
‘Go on then,’ Draco said, molding his tone to that of a bored Dom even if he was more aroused than he’d ever been in his life. But Harry knew. His tongue flicked at the head of Josh’s cock, then slowly down his shaft. Josh had a nice length and girth, and Harry knew that cock well, for his tongue was intently trailing down a path that had Josh panting and grabbing Harry’s hair in a painful grip.
He yanked his eyes up again. Malfoy was still looking at him, eyes unreadable, shadows playing across the hard angles of his face. God, Harry wanted to kiss him. And much more. He wanted to draw all that fire out. How did he never notice Draco Malfoy was this fucking beautiful? But he
The waitress brings me the tea. I pour it slowly, stirr my cup. I watch the vapor rising from it. And all the while I am aware of Harry Potter, staring at me like he’s seeing me for the first time. Maybe he is. I’m not wearing my club clothes either. I know exactly how I look with my Gucci white shirt, grey suspenders, a knitted charcoal coat from Hermès (a gift from Pansy). I spent an hour deciding what to wear. I wanted to look good, but also like he couldn’t hurt me even if he tried very hard. I think I managed.
‘I… I really suck at this. Just forget the sign, that was stupid. What I mean is… I’d like to be busy with you.’
Most nights, you end up in his apartment. He has you on his couch, your back to his chest; once against the front door, in a frantic, uncontrolled fuck, in which you beg him to make you come; and that one time in his kitchen, your hands scrambling for purchase on the expensive marble of his counter, as he ate you out at his leisure. There were tears in your eyes as you came, biting on your own hand to keep from screaming.
I swallow. He’s all business, but at the same time not at all. He’s just serious. The most serious I ever saw him, and that’s counting some post-War speeches & the occasional work-related meeting. He’s been so many things with me, but he’s never been serious. I realise just how serious he is about whatever this is when he waves his hand, wandlessly putting up a silencing charm around our table. He takes a deep breath. He opens his mouth. Closes it. I’ve never seen him act this… hesitant. It makes quick work of spiking my nerves even more.
He’s undressing behind me, his right hand still pinning me in place. I can’t believe this is happening. He wouldn’t- I don’t want this. His hands are now all over me, the whole weight of his body pressing me against the wall.
His mouth does not crash mine, I don’t pin him to a wall, my hands going down on him. We don’t move, don’t speak. His arm is next to mine, not touching. The seconds spill over us, silent, burning.
He’s so close to you, but still he doesn’t touch you. He’s waiting, daring you. You’re both standing on the edge, wondering who’ll be the first to drop. But you don’t want to drop. Not with him. You’ve fallen into bed with enough strangers, just to let some steam off. You’ve had your share of men, some women here and there. Lately, you’ve been more of a loner. Dating is a nightmare when you’re, well,
And suddenly he’s crossing the room in a heartbeat and he’s on me and I can’t react. He punches me on the jaw. The pain is exquisite, more real than anything that went before.
Draco had found that out the hard way, the week before. Unfortunately for his sanity, he had taken a very long, thorough,
He came to after a while. For a violent  second, his eyes were scared and wide. Then he seemed to recognise me. He rose up and stepped away from me, his face closed off to any sign of emotion. He asked for a change of clothes. I gave him a sweater and pyjama pants. I was careful not to pick something too Gryffindor, they’re grey and pretty nondescript.

I hex him on the spot, he blocks me, then curses me. I double over, pain shooting down my spine. I love that he’s officially dropped the good boy act. He curses viciously, albeit far from
‘I want you to tell me to stop if you need to,’ Malfoy said. ‘And I want to know if it hurts when it’s not supposed to,’ he swallowed. He looked gorgeous and unhinged, his hair falling over one of his eyes, his cheeks tinged a soft red. ‘Can you do that for me?’
‘Are you perfectly sure?’ Malfoy said, words huffing over Harry’s ear. ‘They’re all waiting to see if they still have a chance. Josh can get you anyone else for tonight,’ Malfoy sounded serious, business-like, but his voice had a certain electricity to it and it made Harry’s hairs on his neck stand on end. ‘Are you sure you want me?’
White hair, white shirt, rolled up sleeves, a flash of white skin, a cloud of white smoke from the tip of a white cigarette. He could be a ghost, if not for the very real look he gives you, beyond the glass doors that separate the both of you. For a fleeting moment, his eyes are on you. You’re sure that no ghost is this invested in live matters.
Pansy sets her glass on the only empty, neat spot on the table. She looks at me and, shit, she really looks worried. I hate it when she looks worried.
Draco grabbed at Harry’s hair and yanked his head back, mesmerized by the contrast of his pale fingers tugging at the dark strands.
Draco felt speechless. A thousand things he needed to say got trapped in his mouth. Harry was watching him. There was no easy way to say it.
‘You’re… so expressive,’ Draco said when they broke apart, but expressive didn’t begin to cover it. Harry could drive him to orgasm with the sounds he made, that was more like it, but Draco was not about to tell him this. Harry looked down between them.
look like me. I’m the real deal. Potter knows it, I know it. He’d even admit it out loud if I’d ask him. The thing about Potter is... he never tells lies. He simply knows how to work the truth to his favour.
My back is against the wall. His fingers push open my robes, his hands insistent, searching. His name is Matthew. He’s a seventh year Ravenclaw. We’ve been meeting up in empty classrooms late at night. It works as a neat distraction. Some nights, what he has to offer is the only thing standing between me and one of those thoughts.
He set the wand on the table and let his hands drop to his thighs, watching as Josh started working Harry open with his fingers. Draco couldn’t see what he was doing, but he saw exactly what he wanted.
In fact, I haven’t kissed anyone since the War ended three months ago. Me and Ginny, we’re over. I don’t think we ever began, really. Everything is fucked up. Reconstruction is underway at Hogwarts, but I never went back, instead I’m here. I drink. I watch Malfoy dance. I drink some more. I watch him kiss a man. Then I watch him ditching the same man. I drink. This is what I’ve been doing with my newfound life with no Dark Lords on the horizon. Drinking my way to… not even Malfoy, really, ‘cause I haven’t said a word to him since the trials. I can’t explain it to Ron or Hermione, since I can’t even explain it to myself. Watching him is the only thing I look forward nowadays.
‘For reasons I can’t fathom, men fall down on their knees for you. So pick up a replacement and stick with it, or don’t. If you’re not serious about Draco, just get the fuck away from him or this time I won’t need to hand you over to a lame excuse of a Dark Lord, I’ll finish you myself.’
Without a word, he drops his coat off on a hanger on the other side of the room. You follow him in a sort of haze and hang yours too. His coat is dark grey, clearly expensive, all straight lines. Yours is an old favourite, light brown and showing way too many signs of use.
‘I want to be it, Draco,’ Harry said, turning his head and placing a kiss over his shaft. His tongue darted out lightly, and Draco hissed. ‘Want to be your fucking place to relax.’ The words huffed over his cock, warm, wet and for a second he lost their meaning, only to find it next. Harry swallowed him down.
, he says. The fact that your friends know doesn’t ease the pain, but instead makes it all the more real.
Lightning strikes, cuts the sky in half. For a second, I’m blissfully blind. I imagine what it would be like. To be hit by thunder. Struck by lightning. Some would think it symbolic. I, for one, would call it poetic justice.
‘I want to leave for a while. Go abroad, travel, doesn’t really matter where. What matters is... I want you to come with me. To spend the Summer with me.’

‘I thought you hated rules. Suddenly you’re all well-behaved and proper,’ I say, and even I hear the feeble complaint in my voice.
‘You fancy yourself too much,’ Draco says. He turns to look at the tree. The lights dance in seemingly random patterns. Like life, he thinks.
But with him… it’s not random at all. It’s always been a slow dance between you. And an unpredictable one at that.
Draco picked up his wand, his hand tightening around it much more than needed. He took a deep breath, and waved it. Harry snapped forwards when he felt it, a low helpless moan leaving his throat, then his eyes watered, his mouth full of Josh’s cock.
Draco turned the collar in his hands. Harry lifted his chin up, exposing his throat. Draco’s fingers brushed his neck as he pulled the strap of leather around and buckled it carefully at the back. It sat comfortably on Harry’s neck. Draco lowered himself so that his eyes were just slightly above Harry’s. His finger curled around the ring.
‘But you are…’ Harry placed a soft kiss on his lips, on his jaw, down the curve of his chin, on a spot behind his ear. Draco wondered why his every touch felt new and familiar at the same time. ‘This is exactly what I need.’
Malfoy’s fingers skimmed up and down his back, light, then up again, his nails digging into Harry’s skin, fast, burning. Cool hands stilled over his shoulder blades. Malfoy gripped harder at his skin, his nails sinking there. Harry’s body arched back into the touch and he swallowed a scream. Malfoy had the most vicious hands. They were soft, but his nails were sharp and they covered Harry’s back in trails of red pain. Malfoy’s nails drove into his skin from the top of his shoulder blades down to his lower back. He felt them going down, over the curve of his arse. All Doms used to say he had the best arse. They went on and on about how tight it was. How fuckable. How they couldn’t wait to stick their cocks in there and pound him to the nearest wall.
He’d broken the kiss in favour of leaning his forehead against Harry’s, their panted breaths mingling as his hands stroked over Harry’s sides in silent reassurance.
“Would you like that Harry?” he husked, voice breathy and filled with arousal. “Would you like me to drown your insides with my come? To paint your walls white and watch it drip back out of your arse?
“Where anyone could have walked in and seen us? Where they could have seen you bent over your desk, and me, buried balls-deep inside of you?”
“So eager for my cock, aren’t you?” Draco teased, mouthing along Harry’s jaw. “And what a pretty picture you’ll paint. All stretched out around me, sucking me in. Fucking hungry for more, aren’t you?”
He started mouthing along Harry’s jawline, nipping at the junction where his throat met his collarbone, his teeth grazing and biting at the damp flesh.
His gaze turned smouldering as he watched how Harry shuddered at his words, filing the new-found information away for later revision.
After a few moments he felt his dick jerk with the last of his release, pulsing one last time, and claiming his lover inside and out.
“Mh, shit.” Harry shifted on the sheets, hips wiggling enticingly as he tried to make the plug move once more.
“Yes,” Harry hissed, his desolate whine quickly turning into a filthy moan when Draco’s hand retracted to spell the plug into movement, adding a wicked twist at the end of each plunge back into Harry’s waiting arse.
“Good.” Draco smiled wickedly. He let his hands slowly slide over Harry’s thighs, kneading the supple flesh before trailing upwards once more. “Did you like the way it felt? The way it kept you spread? How it jostled with every single step you took, inched just the tiniest bit deeper inside of you whenever you sat down?”
A low gasp fell over Harry’s lips when Draco decided to tighten the ropes. He didn’t think he’d ever get enough of the other calling him by his first name, but Harry was best to remember who exactly was in charge right now.
is on my tongue as I step outside. No out of bounds places for me now. I can go anywhere I want. I can even leave Hogwarts. I doubt anyone would stop me. But all I think about is going
Oh fuck. That voice. That was a Dom’s voice through and through. He felt faint. There was something strict and pulsing underneath that calm. It made Harry want to draw it all out. He felt the first hint of the curling addiction building up inside him.
know the answer? The whole thing made no sense. In any case, he was relieved when those lenses caught a reflex of light and he had the much needed time to look away, save himself before it was too late.
I sip my tea just to have something to do with my hands. When I set the cup on the saucer it clinks brightly between us.
‘You’re really pretty when you’re desperate for it,’ he said slowly, the truth of it hitting him full force.
What he wanted to do next took form inside his head in perfect clarity. Harry watched him expectantly.
‘I always wanted to shut you up like that,’ Draco mused, aware of his cold tone, the hint of teasing just below the surface for Harry to catch on. ‘But you have to work for it, don't you think? All you did tonight was tease me… so why should I let you have my cock?’
He heard Malfoy’s sharp intake of breath. Or he imagined it, because he was so aroused he couldn’t think.
My fingers pry open the buttons in my trousers. Harry takes a step closer. I want his hands on me so badly I’m not above begging. But I don’t have to, because suddenly he’s there. His hands cover mine, and then his fingers are trailing over my bulge and my hips snap forward. He leans over, his breath ghosting over my neck.
‘You’re shaking, Draco,’ he lifts his hand and I step away from him. He silently accioes his wand. It enters the kitchen and he catches it in his hand, without even looking.
‘Not this time.’ His tone is unflinching. His thumb brushes over my lip. It is so hard to breathe. ‘I want you on a bed. I want to take my time.’
There were streaks of old scars, crisscrossing Harry’s chest. Probably from curses and hexes, quite different from the ones caused inside the club. Josh pulled on Harry’s hair and kissed him, open-mouthed, filthy. Harry leant against his Dom, his whole body giving up the fight, one of his hands finding the hem of Josh’s shirt. His fingers tangled in the fabric.
You realise he’s finished when he vanishes the stub. He does it with a clever movement of his fingers. The flicker of magic makes the hairs on your arms stand on end.
‘You’re fucking beautiful… Your arse is begging me for it, isn’t it?’, Malfoy’s hands spread on his arse cheeks, kneading, appreciating what they were touching. Harry felt himself blush and pushed back against those hands.
‘Fuck it. What I mean is everytime I’m not here I wonder what this is, what this means, because it’s starting to mean something and if it doesn’t feel like that to you, we should just end it, whatever this-’
‘Polyamory. Blaise’s a big fan. He’d kill me if he heard me right now. Something about the word fan being completely inadequa-’
He felt — still feels — like liquid fire in my veins. That is why I take him late into the night with copious amounts of alcohol. You know, to ease my descent into hell, where I’m sure to be burning in the afterlife — or so the Muggle lore says.
‘That’s the thing,’ I say and I trace the smudge on the table with my fingernails. I know he remembers it too. It’s all in the way he’s silent, unmoving. Like he’s afraid I’ll go up in smoke if only he moves too fast. I’m not sure I won’t.
Draco stared at him, in awe. God, he wanted to take Harry now, like this, exhausted and abused. He wanted him on his lap, wanted to kiss that damp forehead, wanted his hands all over that body, but he wouldn’t, not just yet. He leant down. His mouth brushed lightly against the corner of Harry’s lips.
getting someone else off. For some of them, he didn’t even need instruments or toys, he relied solely on his commanding voice that worked wonders. He felt confident of his power in those moments, quite aware of it, of its threads, of the sheer pull of the right word at the right time. And he loved the gift of submission, he truly did. But only Harry had managed to put him high up there, nearing the stars, and still leave him hanging low on his every breath.
And this time it was everything and nothing like the first one. Their lips brushed slowly, then Draco coaxed his mouth open. Harry’s lips parted, a sob, a moan, a pitiful little sound escaping his throat and Draco plunged inside his mouth, carefully, deeply, his tongue running over Harry’s lips, his teeth nipping, his fingers tangling in Harry’s hair.
other than friends. I knew we were over the moment I saw Ginny after the Battle, covered in ashes and wreck. Alive, breathing, a fighter. I never loved her as much as I did in that moment. I also knew it wouldn’t be enough. We broke up a week after the War. I don’t know who said it first. But we were over. We were also having sex. And kept doing it. We’re still doing it.
Draco twisted his hand over his own cock. Two pulls, just how he liked them and he would be ready to pop.
Harry’s lips parted in a muted gasp. His pupils wide, the green in them unavoidable. Draco knew all these miniscule reactions had nothing to do with the flogger, the leather stripes curving, hitting Harry’s back at that precise moment. Even with the force of the impact, those eyes were on him, and only him, wide open and unrelenting.
I feel his fingers slipping into mine. He pulls me close again. I’m afraid to look in his eyes, to let him see.
liked. His hole clenched and unclenched experimentally, expectant. He wanted to be filled, he wanted Draco to reach deep into him and make him forget that there was a world beyond this. Draco pushed through.
Harry could not breathe. Josh was always the one to decide if and when Harry came. He’d broken that rule, but why? Did Malfoy ask for it? Was it Josh’s idea? Harry was terrified. Exhilarated.
Draco hadn’t been ready for the rush, close to an onslaught to his every emotion, he felt at Potter’s question.
‘I used to have great taste in everything,’ I say, and the laugh is out suddenly. It sounds hollow. I pick up the sugar bowl. ‘I left a perfectly good bloke there.’
Malfoy’s hands brushed over his overheated skin, bliss, bliss, he loved those hands, oh god, those fingers trailing down his back, soothing him, going down the curve of his arse and he wanted more, he wanted those fingers on his crease, touching his hole, inside him.
He finally looks at you, but there’s no judgement in his eyes, in fact, you don’t quite know what you’re finding there. He looks infinitely tired, fragile.
‘Draco, here you are…’ Parkinson’s voice yanks me back to the street, the cold, the low muffled beat of the music coming from the club. She spots me. ‘Well, hello Potter.’
His body tensed up in the effort to keep his orgasm at bay. He couldn’t come without permission. Wouldn’t.
‘You taste so fucking good,’ he said, his hand coming up behind Harry’s neck and idly rubbing circles there. Harry was shivering. From the touch, from the words. From the fucking mind-blown orgasm he’d just had. Draco liked his taste.
‘The first one is too sad and way too simple. Doesn’t fit,’ his right hand flexes, he lifts it up and I follow the movement with my eyes. He lets it fall on a knee. The way he does it is so natural I take some time to notice it’s my knee.
He wasn’t ready for the vision of Draco Malfoy down on his knees in front of him. He’d never be, but instead his words were:
His thoughts were jumbled, his fists clenched to the point of pain. He’d never come without permission, he was starting to panic, he couldn’t, he couldn’t, Malfoy hadn’t said yes… he couldn’t be a bad slut, he wouldn’t, he wanted to be so good for Malfoy…
Gotta love Pansy. She has great timing. Like that time she suggested we delivered Potter to the Dark Lord. She thought the Dark Lord would stop at that. She didn’t know him like I did. She regrets it now. I wonder if Potter knows.
I look at her, and for a moment none of us say a word. This is by far the longest conversation I’ve had with Parkinson. And it’s all about the one person I never discuss with any of my closest friends. Not even Hermione. Now her wife is in on the only secret I’ve been keeping. The irony is not lost on me.
Draco placed the lube on his back pocket and lowered his trousers to a more comfortable position. Everything he was doing was simple and natural, but it was all building up for the moment when his cock would be opening Harry up and tearing him apart. Harry lifted his head to be able to watch the movement of Draco’s hand over his shaft. Draco looked so good like this, so in control of his own pleasure, so assured. His chest heaving, his hand slow on his cock, his eyes on Harry. God, Harry wanted to sink down on that cock, he wanted to be fucked into the leather - and he was going to be.
‘Draco… please… please…’ he fought to speak, voice coming in cut rasps, all the air about to leave him. He blinked, his eyes wet, white spots on his vision. Malfoy was breathing heavily, like he was the one fighting for air. The hand on his throat released the grip, and Harry coughed, his body shuddering, Malfoy pressed against him, that hand, that hand going down, moving between them, but to not to touch Harry, no. Instead, Malfoy unbuckled his belt, opened his fly, no hurry in his movements, only a relentless determination in them.
‘I trained his gag reflex,’ Josh said, in between deep breaths, his hand on Harry’s hair, pressing him down on his cock so that his whole length was being sucked in. ‘See? He loves gagging on it,’ Josh added, and his hips pistoned up. Harry didn’t resist any of it. He let his mouth be fucked, spit trailing down his lips, over Josh’s cock, his breath harsh, his jaw slack.
And then I find myself laughing. I can’t help it. It feels strange, because I haven’t laughed in a very long time. And it’s also weird because I should be feeling like I owe him again, instead of this odd warmth, like a knot has been eased in my chest, a weight has been lifted. Like I can breathe again.
You watch him lick, suck and rub against you. You don’t dare to put your hands on his hair, even though you’re dying to.
I have no idea why I sound like I’m defending him, when I know she’s right. Potter’s a playboy. Not that there’s anything wrong with being promiscuous per se. I just wish he didn’t fuck with my head. Pansy gives me her classical dry laugh.
He was locked up in my bathroom for nearly two hours. At some point I thought I heard him sobbing, a desperate fragile sound underneath the running water of my shower, but then everything went quiet. Silencing spell, probably.
Her voice is as bright as her fancy Cartier eyewear flashing back at me. Pansy waves her wand in a precise motion & my curtains come open on the other side of the living room. I lift my hand up in front of my eyes, to block the sudden blazing light. Pansy drops her Chanel purse on the center table with a clatter. She’s dressed impeccably, of course, in a tight black embroidered dress (Hermès? Dior?). The fact that I no longer can tell Muggle luxury designer clothing apart goes to show how deeply I’ve fallen. I catch sight of a perfectly manicured hand, long vibrant dark green nails. I would compliment her on that, if my tongue wasn’t currently glued to the roof of my mouth.
He wiggled his ass lightly, whining when he felt Draco’s length inside of him, splitting him open. Draco was pressed flush against Harry’s arse, and the slight movement of Harry’s hips was enough for another groan to escape him, the friction too delectable.
A hopeless groan tumbled over Harry’s lips when Draco finally found his mark, his body arching up as Draco started teasing his perked up nipple, rolling it softly between his fingers; alternating between gentle motions and pinching the sensitive bud.
For a brief second he let his thoughts drift, allowing himself to wonder how they even got here. How years of hatred had turned into…
“Ah, we got ourselves a little exhibitionist here, haven’t we? Did you think about it? If they could tell? If they knew what their celebrated hero was actually up to during work?”
Harry’s eyes were trained on him, his gaze fierce yet slightly hazed around the edges. Draco could tell. He knew Harry well enough by now.
There was reverence in Harry’s tone as he said his name, desperation and long-suppressed desire mixing into the wanton way his voice curled around the syllables. A shiver ran down Draco’s spine when Harry playfully licked his lips, the movement slow and deliberate, unhurried as he tried to entice Draco into giving him what he wanted.
“You want to be filled right up to the brim, don’t you, love? Your tight little hole stretched so wide, it can barely take any more.”
“It certainly sounds like you do,” Draco teased smugly, letting his fingers trail lightly over his wand as his eyes raked over Harry arse. “Can you feel it? Can you feel it expanding inside of you? Growing thicker? Nudging against all the right spots?”
The friction was no longer enough to satisfy the deep-seated hunger within him. He wanted to devour Harry. To fuck him until he couldn’t stand on his own two feet anymore, incapable of leaving their bed, limp and blissed out.
“Patience is a virtue, love. Good things come to those who wait,” he paused briefly, watched as Harry shuddered helplessly, complete and utterly at Draco’s mercy, before finally whispering, “
Draco chuckled, the sound entirely fond. He let his fingers trail back into Harry’s hair, his nails scraping lightly over Harry’s scalp.
Slowly easing up on the pressure, he let one hand trail down to where the plug was nestled, teasing along the edges of Harry’s puckering ring. The muscles clenched and tensed around the plug, eagerly sucking it deeper inside.
He slowly let one of his lube-covered fingers ghost over Harry’s rim, and watched how Harry immediately angled his arse upwards as much as the restraints allowed, fervently begging for more.
He moved his hand into a loose fist, and let it glide all the way down to Harry’s balls, stroking the heated flesh with barely-there touches.
He rolled his eyes. “Yes, yes. I’m spoiled, filthy rich and devastatingly handsome. Tell me something I don’t know already. I take it you’re feeling well enough if you’re already acting like a git.”
“I’m sure you felt it,” he continued, voice smooth as honey as he took in the raw desperation edged onto Harry’s face. “How the plug denied you. How it stopped and shrank, not giving you that last little push you so desperately needed.”
Gradually coming down from his high, Draco pressed a small kiss to Harry’s throat, shifted his hips back and slowly slipped out of the tight heat. He almost couldn’t take his eyes off the sight of his come slowly dribbling out of Harry’s abused hole, but reminding himself of the Egyptian cotton sheets that lay precariously beneath them, he quickly grabbed his wand and flicked a strong cleaning spell over both of them.
“Manners, Potter. Or have you forgotten them?” he drawled, managing to sound almost bored despite the aching desire coursing his veins. He usually didn’t mind when Harry used his last name, but within the boundaries of a scene he absolutely couldn’t stand it.
“That’s right, love. Call my name,” he husked. ”Let everyone know who’s about to fuck you until you can’t think straight anymore.”
Pressing one last, lingering kiss to Harry’s lips, he flicked his wand to stop the plug and bent down to gently retrieve it from Harry’s abused hole. Harry whined as he extracted the plug, his arse stretched wide and greedily clutching on to the toy, until Draco finally got it out with a loud squelch.
He was standing next to their massive wooden four-poster bed, fully clothed. The only thing amiss with his usually pristine appearance was the slight crook in his collar where strong hands had frantically clutched onto a few moments prior.
He was openly sobbing now, chest heaving as his body desperately tried to push him over the edge. Just a tiny bit more, Draco knew, and Harry would have come all over himself.
He let his forehead rest against Harry’s, closed his eyes and relished in the affectionate warmth spreading through him. He let his lips slide against Harry’s once more, tenderly, and allowed himself to drown in the soft caresses, the movements slow yet deliberate as Harry reciprocated, unhurried in the exploration of his mouth. He playfully nipped at Harry’s bottom lip, letting his tongue delve into Harry’s mouth once he finally opened up; a lewd, muffled whine all the incentive he needed. Licking his way inside, he swirled his tongue around Harry’s, the strokes torturously teasing, yet deliciously thrilling.
Looking up, he sucked in a sharp breath as his eyes raked from kiss-swollen lips to the litany of claiming marks and bites marring Harry’s skin, down to the puckering hole clenching on thin air, desperate to be filled again. And never had Draco been more eager to comply.
More wax dripped onto Harry’s skin, hot and scorching as it spilled over his perked up nipples this time, causing his body to writhe helplessly on the sheets. And what a display it was. Draco shivered at the sight, his cock giving an eager twitch inside his pants. Patience. All in due time.
“That’s all you want to do, isn’t it Harry? Swallow up my cock in that greedy little hole of yours. I bet you liked knowing that a part of me was inside of you all day long.”
“Yes, love?” he asked, hands stroking soothingly over Harry’s sides. He could tell that Harry was slipping into subspace, only a shred of consciousness still left.
Harry’s voice broke, his body powerless against the continuous assault wrecking through him. Draco watched as Harry gasped, shivering when a new wave of stimulation hit, before suddenly letting out a high-pitched keen and tossing his head back onto the pillows, eyes completely glazed over as his orgasm was denied once more.
A deep moan tumbled over Harry’s lips, a bead of precome dribbling down his shaft as the wax slowly cooled down on his overheated skin.
His cock was stuffing Harry’s arse to the brim. He could feel every twitch of the slippery walls around him, urging him to finally, finally start pounding into him properly.
He gently wiped away the tears staining Harry’s cheeks, fingers tender and reverent as he pressed reassuring kisses all over his face.
A startled moan fell over Draco’s lips as Harry’s walls suddenly constricted around his length, the muscles clenching on the cock fucking him open. His hips stuttered for a brief moment, the pressure inside of him building, the fire now stoked into a raging inferno as he found his rhythm again.
Firm hands were on him immediately, pressing his hips down and preventing him from writhing around. “Ah, ah, ah,” Draco chided softly, keeping Harry’s body still until the message seemed to sink in.
I begin to fall backwards, my wand dropping down to the floor. He grabs the front of my robes and pulls me up. I taste his breath on my lips. I only know one wandless spell, but it’s a vicious one. I forced myself to learn it during the War, in case I ended up cornered, wandless and needing to escape.
He tastes sweet, but there’s an edge to him, to the way he kisses. I want that edge like I want everything about him. I feel so lightheaded I have to pull back slightly.
most people. The most powerful wizard he knew, the Auror that he saw issuing orders about, voice firm and commanding, assured steps, had this other side to him. A darker, vulnerable, softer side... And he’d let Draco, of all people, see it.  Potter’s vulnerability felt too raw and real. Like Draco could stretch out his hand and touch it. Hold it, tease it, break it, pull it apart, make it burn, then put it gently back together again. And that was what Potter had given him. The Hero everyone knew was the same man that had gone
It’s as if someone has turned up the noise. Around me there’s movement, people, but all of my vision tunnels to Flannagan. I’m seeing red.
You can’t quite sleep, not even with your usual dose of Dreamless Sleep. You lie in bed all day, in your pyjamas, staring at the ceiling. You ignore the frequent buzz in your Floo downstairs. Hermione shouldn’t worry, really.
His own yell rang on his ears, a desperate scream. Malfoy instantly popped his mouth out and Harry’s hips snapped forward, fucking into the air, helpless to stop. His throat was hurting and that only meant he was still screaming.
He always had this way of glaring at me, like it’s impossible to know what he’s thinking. It’s what he’s doing right now, looking at me dead in the eye and I can't stand it. Thank Merlin I smuggled my pack of cigarettes here. I light one wandlessly and the minute I do, I know it’s a mistake.
Draco gripped the base of Harry’s cock and stood back, his mouth releasing Harry’s cock with a pop. He looked unkempt, his hair a bit disheveled, his breath heaving. Harry wished he could bury his hands in that hair and mess it up properly.
He’s sweaty, out of breath. You want to tell him how beautiful he looks, how you can’t look away from him, but you’re sure he’s heard that before, so you keep your mouth shut and you fuck him. He tightens hard around you. You’re standing on the edge, he drops. His teeth sink into your shoulder as he comes, his come splattering your skin, his whole body coiling around you.
‘I know,’ Malfoy said. The cocky, self-evolved tone would have made a younger Harry want to punch him. Now… he just wanted
I know it, because I never had it so good before. It’s the first time, and I’m in awe of it. Of him.
After a trip to the Hospital Wing, we’re assigned detention. Two whole weeks of it, after classes, which means I actually
I let him tug at my hand, drag me through a throng of sweaty bodies, pull me up against a bathroom stall, wandlessly bolt the door & effortlessly go down on his knees. That’s when I sober up fast to find myself standing on a ledge about to leap, free falling into the abyss of deep, deep green eyes.

You nurse the slight hangover with coke and pizza. The headache stays. You want a smoke, but leaving the bed is not a possibility.
We’re moving to the beat. I take in his scent, the way he feels, warm, real, swaying against me, the cold night air, the laughs and voices, the song, my heartbeat, his breathing. He takes my arms and puts them around him. My hands drop to the front of his jeans. He’s hard. His hands press mine over the swell of his cock, my fingers cupping him. It’s like I’m meant to do this all my life.
But I will tell him soon. He’ll know. He’ll know exactly how I feel around him, with him, about him. I will tell him about trust, about hope. I will tell him with every word that I can muster, because he deserves it.
‘She asked if there was anyone I could talk to. That I could trust.’ I’ve never seen him blushing this hard. But then again my pulse is going wild all of a sudden.
Draco was there, so close. His eyes looked like rain. Harry had never known they were so beautiful. He’d never known there were so many gradients of grey in the world. He wanted them on him like that forever. Some unknown emotion was pressing on them, just under the surface. Draco was fighting himself on something. Fear and doubt engulfed Harry. Maybe he was just going to tell Harry this was a one time only thing. Like all the other ones. He’d never cared before.
He looks earnest, almost solemn. He knows what I mean. He knows what’s at stake. He’s known it since all of this began.
Draco Malfoy’s face came into view, too close to his, too real. The grey eyes bore into his. He’d seen Malfoy so many times but never up this close. And never like this. His blond hair fell over one of his eyes, obscuring it. His lips were thin, slightly parted and red. They were wet - from sucking and rimming Harry. There was a hint of a pleased smirk there, but just a hint. Like he wasn’t too sure of himself just then. Fuck. Draco Malfoy was…
Draco was leaning down and pressing gentle kisses on his forehead, down his nose, cheeks, and neck and Harry’s eyes fluttered shut as he tried not to cry.
thing, with Potter waiting at the other end. No one in their right mind would think such a pathetic thing. But he’s played other scenes in his head. Ten years is a long time to dream of someone you’ll never have. But those were just dreams. Castles made of clouds. Beautiful, untouchable. Like Potter.
Draco released his grip on Harry and stepped back. With an impressive control, Harry managed to stay upright, gasping, wild-eyed.
He is completely motionless for so long, you start to doubt he’s even heard you. But then, he simply nods. It’s so subtle you think you imagined it, but he’s already walking towards the doors, turning back to look at you and something in his eyes is different. Expectant.
You’re shaking, trying to hold yourself up without touching him. He laughs. It’s a short, breathy thing, so unexpected. You want to listen to it again.
It seemed like a long time before he could even think or remember his own name… he only did because someone was breathing it gently on his ear… Josh? Josh’s hands were on his back, applying salve and easing his pain, but tears were welling up on Harry’s eyes.
Potter has always been the mystery Draco can’t solve. Right now, Draco doesn’t get the stupid sign he’s still holding or any of the words he speaks. He also doesn’t get why Potter’s eyes are so green. The sight of them hurts him. Tugs at his chest.
‘Harry,’ Draco said. Just this word was enough. Harry looked at him, wild-eyed. Draco tugged on the leash. ‘Come here.’
‘If you want to, I mean,’ his next words shook. ‘I’ll be whatever you want. Whatever does it for you, whatever kink, I’ll-’
And the truth is all in there. He makes me feel safe, no matter how insane that sounds. I’m not in danger anymore because Harry made sure of it. It’s a new, impossible feeling. I swallow hard. I look in his eyes, gather the words around me. I will myself to say it.
He looks at me, eyes defiant. He doesn’t raise his voice, in fact he says it so quietly it’s barely there, but his words slam into me.
‘I told them I had other plans this year. I went there earlier to leave the presents, that’s why I left in a hurry. Didn’t fancy being murdered by Rose and Hugo if I didn't leave them their presents tonight,’ he chuckles.
‘You look so cute in red,’ he whispers. And then he turns me over and brings his mouth down over mine.
noise he’s making into your mouth, half frantic, half demanding. You think of apparating the both of you to his room, but you’ve never been here before and you’re so dizzy. He’s already walking you back, out of the living room.
He pulled Harry’s arms up again, gently, binding them to the cross, leaving the ankles free. There was a long pause in which Harry felt Malfoy’s eyes raking over him. He could barely even breathe.
I can almost touch how much he hates me right now. Probably more than he ever did. Which is funny if you think about our history. Broken noses. Bleeding to death in a bathroom. And now this. It’s hilarious, come to think of it.
‘Potter has gone back to his…’ She tilts her head to the side. ‘How shall I put it? Reckless Fucker Who Lived ways. Hermione’s been worried sick. He’s been to St. Mungos 3 times in the last week. And before that-’
I feel a sudden urge to laugh. I do. It’s not what people are supposed to do when they kiss, but I laugh. He laughs too. He kisses the side of my mouth. He kisses my neck. His hands move down my back, hesitant. I don’t want them to be hesitant, I want them to know how much I want. I want them to go everywhere.
But mostly, he takes you on his bed. Slow and purposeful. He learns your ways, he takes your cock in hand and works you up until you’re babbling, incoherent,
You are filled with the need to please him. It’s all encompassing. You pull down his pants, freeing his cock. You take it in your hand. It’s a thing of beauty, you think, your hand tight around it. You know it’s going to fit the length of your mouth and throat so perfectly. His thumb brushes your lips. He’s still holding the cigarette, dangerously close to your face. He holds it so that you can take a drag. You do, your lips closing around the same spot his were, just seconds before. You exhale, in a daze. Your mouth forms the shape of an O over the head of his cock. You go down on him, just like that. His hips snap forward instantly, his cock sinking into your mouth. You suck him in the slowest way you can, wanting to feel him getting hard. You love that he’s still smoking, the cigarette on its way to his mouth. His other hand finds your hair. His fingers tighten there. His head drops against the wall. The sight of him, lost like this, the pressure of his cock, his hand in your head — it’s all too good.
Draco took his sweet time opening his trousers. He unbuckled the belt, then let the buttons on his fly slip open. He pushed his black pants down, his right hand cupping his bollocks. He felt heady with how slowly he was moving, but Harry made it so worth it. He looked beyond desperate. Draco took his own cock in hand. Harry let out a broken cry.
Edit: the actual hair colour is more turquoise than blue. But I believe Harry wouldn't, for the life of him, know how to distinguish between blue and turquoise, and since this is his POV... but I added Draco saying turquoise anyway, he knows his colours :)
Oh. He did. He wanted Malfoy crazy with want for him. And he fucking wanted those fingers to move over his cock. He would give anything for a few seconds of that hand wanking him. It would be the perfect torture. A sweet resounding moan came out of his mouth at the thought.
‘Beautiful. But you can do better than that, Harry. I’ve had to deal with you strutting around in your fucking Auror robes for too long, teasing me with just one of your looks.’
Pansy Granger-Parkinson seems to be at a loss for words. Which is something I didn’t even know was possible. She recovers quickly though.
The muscles on Harry’s legs flexed as he moved to spread his thighs as wide as the position allowed. Draco couldn’t see his hole from where he was sitting, only the curve of his arse. But he knew exactly how he tasted there. His mouth watered.
I don’t even care for a retort. I also don’t have to look back to confirm any of it. Potter’s type is not exactly a state secret. It’s the infinite source of some questionable in-depth longform journalism, all of it to describe a rather simple set of characteristics: tall, blonde, gay. Pretty boys with pretty faces that look good on their knees & run their mouths every chance they get.
Not that he wants to date me. He just wants to fuck me, that much is evident. But I hate to know that I would say yes to everything... anything.
Now you’re watching the darkness inside your eyelids, thinking this is it. That’s all there is to it. An otherworldly shag.
You nod. He takes the glasses off your face, sets them at the coffee table. He feels different tonight. More real. He kisses you first. You’re both fully clothed and it’s still the most erotic thing you ever done. You kiss until you’re both hard and you’re panting on his ear, about to beg him to fuck you. He smiles against your mouth and kisses you hard, deeper, grinding against you. He’s warm, delicious, he lets you touch him everywhere as you kiss. He clings to you and you want to believe that he needs this as much as you do. That he needs you. You break the kiss and search his eyes. They’re soft grey, clearer around the edges, bright in the dimmed lights of your living room. You think he might look away any time now, but he doesn’t. You lift your hand and touch his jaw. You can’t stop yourself from following the lines of his face, letting your hand be scratched by his stubble. You’re about to say something very stupid. You know this thing between you and him is against all odds, against all probability, really. You don’t tell any of your friends because you know what they’d say. It makes no fucking sense.
, he didn’t say it, but thought it. Then he thought no more of anything. There was only his hand on his cock, his heavy breathing, his will keeping the orgasm at bay and, more importantly, Harry’s plaintive half-scream of surprise. Harry shook, almost falling forward if not for Josh’s hands on him, keeping him up.
‘He ripped my robes. I didn’t have my wand, but I had that hex, you know, the one I used on you, but I couldn’t, I just- I felt so helpless. I couldn’t get it out. I ran, like a fucking coward-’
Harry waited for the negotiations. On his knees, cock already hard, hands placed behind his back, the way Josh appreciated. He wasn’t allowed to listen in to the conversation, but he knew what Josh was doing. He gave out the rules to use Harry. Aside from Harry’s hard limits, there weren’t many. Josh only had two: he was the one to decide if and when Harry was allowed to come and he was the one to take Harry home and fuck him last. He’d never changed these rules.
He sets his drink on the table with a definitive clink. Then he takes your glass and sets it aside too. With your hands empty, you become aware of the fact that there’s nothing standing between you and him.
You don’t exactly know what you’re doing, but your hand brushes his cheek. You pull that strand of startling blonde hair behind his ear.
‘Crap. Scratch that. I mean. It’s the fucking truth, but that’s not it,’ Potter laughs. He looks a bit deranged. ‘Well, not
Draco tries to follow the logic, but gets lost. Potter brushes his hair back with one hand, the way he does when he doesn’t know what to say. It’s something he does quite a lot around Draco, now that he thinks of it.
I’ll also deny letting him dress me in those horrible pyjamas. They’re actually the most comfortable thing I ever wore.
was in charge of his orgasm. Malfoy would have the final word. He was completely under Malfoy’s will and command. And that idea was enough to drive him further down the spiral. The following hours of his life would be as Draco Malfoy would see fit. He felt on fire, as if he’d been already spanked raw. But Malfoy had barely even touched him.
‘So you’ll do what?’ He asks, in a very soft tone. He looks straight at me. I’ve never seen such sad eyes.
‘She loves books,’ Parkinson says amusedly. I’m about to combust. ‘She invited me over to check her library.’
In the end, it’s not a drop from the sky to you. It’s a wave and you feel it coming. He blinks up at you. His lips brush yours.
‘Suck,’ Draco whispered. And then his fingers were inside Harry’s mouth, wet and warm and right. He swayed forward. Harry sucked his fingers down, his eyes drifting closed. Draco felt spaced-out, floating on a high.
‘You were so good, so sweet, getting fucked for me,’ Draco said, his fingers cupping Harry’s chin, lifting his face up so that their lips aligned. ‘You’re desperate for my mouth, my cock, any of it, aren’t you?’
I take off my heavy winter coat and take a seat across the table, feeling his eyes on me. The waitress comes over and I ask her for a cup of strong Earl Grey. He’s already holding a cup of warm coffee in his hands. Neither of us says a word.
‘Just excusing myself to your shag, it’s only polite. Don’t let it be said that ex-Death-Eaters and pureblood conceited prats don’t have manners,’ I give him my best dazzling smile, feeling the clothes clinging to my skin. He looks utterly lost.
He rested his back against the couch, hoping to blend in with the background. He felt torn between wanting to remain invisible, watching everything unnoticed, and
He gives me a slow smile. The scar on his face must hurt right then for he immediately flinches. Without thinking, I reach out and my fingers touch the skin of his face, not on the scar, but on the other cheek. He looks fully surprised. Then he closes his eyes, leans into the touch.
‘Harry,’ he lifted Harry’s chin up. Green eyes looked dazedly at him. ‘I need to ask you something and for that I need you to be here with me, fully aware… do you think you can do that?’
You lean into him, kiss the corner of his mouth. You do it softly. Tenderly, even. His fingers dig into your hips. You kiss him with slow purpose, your hands on his face. It’s way too sweet, you know this, but he doesn’t stop you. Your fingers brush his scalp, his hair. He pulls you closer, towards the bed. He lies back, you climb on top of him, kissing the nape of his neck, his hands on your shoulders. Your face rubs over his chest, you lick over his nipple. His hands drag down your skin, press on the small of your back, trying to push you closer, to find the friction he needs. You don’t give it to him. In fact, this isn’t the hard fuck he asked for, this is something else you didn’t know was there.
Here is the happy ending, my sweets. I spent the whole day writing this. Hope you like it. Take care.
‘So sorry to disturb what must surely be an otherworldly shag with Our Saviour. Did he tell you he likes to fuck around with pretty blondes?’
‘All of it, please,’ he whispered. Malfoy’s eyes were wide, but he moved, pressing into Harry even when he found resistance and then he was fully seated, his heavy bullocks nudged against Harry’s arse.
Harry could not breathe, could not think, his heart hammering on his throat, his body taut and he was hard again, his cock pressing against Draco’s stomach, needy and properly ignored, as Draco kept drilling into him, fast, hips snapping against his arse, sending jolts of pain and pleasure all over him. Draco Malfoy’s fuck was relentless. Harry screamed, feeling Draco’s cock drag inside him, battering at his prostate.
Josh removed the gag and Harry coughed, traces of saliva dripping down his jaw. Draco had the sudden urge to trace them with his fingers, wiping them off his face. He didn’t act on it.
, heart kicking wild against my ribs. The bright spot of light falls over Potter’s face. Black hair a mess, shuttered eyes, the rise and fall of a pyjama covered chest. He is asleep right next to me. I listen to his slow breath, a contrast to the hard grip he has around his wand. He holds it over the covers, ready.
The little gasp he makes, the muffled surprise, the taste of his lips, his mouth opening up to yours and the moment he surrenders. His hands fist your hair, yours go everywhere on him. You kiss him not realising you’re moving, until his back hits a wall and you pin him there and keep kissing him, drunk on his taste — whisky, vanilla, but mostly
The line 'I violently dislike you' is obviously taken from Buffy - she says it to Spike :D hope you enjoyed this one :)
He hadn’t brought any of his instruments and he didn’t need them. Not with Harry anyway. But the idea of Harry completely naked but for a collar around his throat was too damn arousing.
Harry let his head fall back against the leather, not fighting it, sinking into it. Fuck. Josh had really been thorough in telling Draco his every kink. He was going to drown in those grey eyes.
‘He does remind me of a younger you…’ He says. ‘Minus the Death Eater act-’ Potter gives a wry laugh, like the jerk that he is, tilting his head in the general direction of the bloke. ‘But then again, you were never really that good at playing bad.’
‘Someone promised me dinner. I’m wondering if he’s going to keep the promise.’ Draco glances at Potter. They’re very close, their arms touching.
Now that you’re in bed, he’s finally talking to you. You do as you’re told, working him open, first with just one finger, pushing slowly in and out, his body allowing you in. Two, he says, not long after. You scissor them, curl them up. He likes it. It feels like a dream.
Malfoy sucked on his skin, hard and long, and the sounds he made were heaven for Harry, so his mouth kept begging, non-stop now.
After a while, Josh had moved to untie Harry. The clamps were off, Harry’s nipples red and hard. They would be so sensitive just then. Perfect to bite on.
Like that would ever happen. I’m surprised to realise that I know why she’s here. There’s only one person of interest we share other than Hermione, and I’ve seen Hermione barely an hour ago.
Draco was vaguely aware of Josh grabbing the lube from a nearby table, dripping some on two of his fingers and lifting them up to show him. He nodded his agreement, but his focus was on Harry and on his question.
‘Kiss me like you’ve been wanting to all this time,’ I say it against his mouth. I don’t tell him it’s what I’ve been wanting, too.
He was barely aware of Malfoy moving to release the restraints on his ankles and then coming up to do the same on his wrists. Was it over then? The sobs were rising on his throat and he didn’t want to, he didn’t mean to cry, he had loved every second of it and if Malfoy said it was over he had to accept that. Maybe Malfoy already had what he wanted from him, maybe this was exactly what he’d meant from the beginning: to leave Harry desperate and wanting and unsatisfied,
‘Yes, fuck, please,’ he bucked back, exposing his arse as best as he could for the cane. He wanted Malfoy to give it to him. He could feel his skin breaking where the cane hit. There was blood, he felt its liquid warmth. He was diving into the feeling, as Malfoy’s cane hit him, and hit him, and hit him again, marking his arse in long red lashes.
The room was in semi darkness, two lamps in each side, lights dimmed and red toned. There was a four poster bed in the center, with a dark coverlet, and two sofas, one to the left, another to the right. A table in a corner was set with water bottles, glasses and a bowl with condoms. Since they were all wizards, they wouldn’t be needing those.
‘Let me go, Matthew.’ I say, a bit louder this time. I sound pathetic, hoping that saying his name will make him hesitate, maybe stop.
You don’t know how long you stand there, but when he finally turns to leave without a word, your hands are cold and you finished three more of his cigarettes. There’s a soft trace of vanilla on your tongue.
If that voice had made some damage on his nerves when he couldn’t see Malfoy, now it was even worse. The voice was the perfect companion to that angular face, filled with stark contrasts. The hard lines, the unwavering eyes, that smile that could go so many different ways, that hint of unsureness so neatly hidden behind demanding words.
Wait, what? Seven?... He knows how long we've?- My thoughts are in a complete disarray. I stay silent while I search for something to say that won’t sound completely pathetic.
No, those were the least of his problems. The reality, that surpassed even his imagination, was much worse. Most people were protective of their feelings, most people would bolt them away and only show them to others they deeply trusted. Most people would be too afraid of getting hurt. Harry Potter
Harry tried to focus his eyes on Draco’s face. Draco knew this was hard to do. To bring someone from the depth of it.
He laughs. It’s a bright, tight thing, like a tiny burst, soft and vivid and I want to drink it down. My trainer plays distractly with the tip of the cigarette.
‘I could try for you…’ he said, lifting his eyes, his lips parted slightly. ‘I just want to please you, Malfoy...’
You hear him by the drinks cabinet. He doesn’t ask you what you want, but fills two glasses with whisky. It’s a Muggle brand, probably a very good one. He leaves your glass on the table next to him and takes a sip of his drink, leaning against the wall. All his quietness and presumption should make you uncomfortable. It shouldn’t be making you walk over to him, pick up the glass and empty it in one go.
‘Fuck my brains out, Harry. Here on this table. Fuck me until I forget neat hair and having good taste.’
Harry’s eyes darkened even more, his whole face set with purpose. He crawled over to Josh. The leash was long enough for him to reach the other man’s parted knees, but he’d have to struggle a bit to bend his head forward and suck Josh’s cock.
The cold air hits my face and I sober up some more, even if the street seems lopsided. He’s walking up ahead, his hands white at his sides. He takes a left turn, to the back of the building and I do too. This street is empty. He stops at the Apparition point. He doesn’t turn back to look at me, I don’t speak when I reach him. I lift my arm, he grabs it and I feel the instant pull. The world dissolves, swirls, we spin, his hand on me.
Malfoy chuckled, his fingers light, treading over his hairs, then he twisted them and pain crashed over Harry. He was flushed against Malfoy and it was too good, the feel of Malfoy’s lean hard body behind him, of his cruel hands over him, pulling his hairs, twisting them, dragging his nails over his skin, doing whatever the hell they pleased…
It’s like lifting a heavy weight from my chest. I’m not sentimental, but I swear his smile rivals the sun. You know, if you could look at the sun. Which you can, but you shouldn’t. Salazar, that’s fucking cheesy and I need to
His mouth fell open obediently. Draco let the tip of his cock slide inside, but Harry pulled back again, flushed and desperate.
Harry looked momentarily confused. His hands reached out for Draco’s. Their fingers twined, warm, slick from saliva and pre-come. Harry let his head fall down on the bed, his hair brushing Draco’s chest, his fingers tightening over Draco’s. Draco gave a curt nod.
I take one breath of him, my head spins. I want to answer that my taste in men is just fine. Andrew was fine. Potter is the problem. I had a little taste of him all those months ago & I just can’t seem to get enough of it.
‘I’m okay, everything’s fine,’ he said. Josh always tied him up nicely. He knew he would be drained after this, but right now he just wanted more and he had a feeling Malfoy was far from done with him.
You blink and it’s all it takes for the spell to break. He’s already looking away, over the balcony. A strand of his hair falls over the right side of his face.
‘Feel it,’ he whispers. I close my eyes, let myself fall back into him, into silence, into me. I’m aware of the faint beat of the music, of people laughing, coming and going, of my trainers on the pavement, of his hands barely moving on my sides.
It’s the three year anniversary of the end of the War. The annual party is a formal and unavoidable business — as usual, you’re the guest of honour. As usual, you feel like suffocating.
‘Oh,’ you say. But what you’re thinking is: This is it. The impossibility of predicting him. This is what you’ve been missing.
Harry reached down with his mouth over Josh’s bulge, breath stuttering. Then his teeth were on the zipper, pulling it down, slowly. Josh lifted his hips up, the swell of his cock rubbing against Harry’s nose.
Harry dragged his hands over Draco’s back, one of his hands searching wildly under his shirt, and finally he was touching Draco’s skin. They were kissing again, slow and desperate. He was falling inside Draco’s mouth, falling falling falling and it was like flying and falling at the same time and fuck… it couldn’t be. He was
Harry swallowed, a trace of saliva on his lips stretched around the gag. He would make such a sight on his knees sucking Draco’s cock. Draco wanted that mouth on him and at the same time he wanted it under his own mouth, he wanted to lick it, bite on those lips and drink down the moans. And then he would fuck it. Have Harry swallow him whole. Make him gag on his prick.
Draco tugged harshly at the ring and the stripe of leather cut into Harry’s throat. He let Harry struggle to breathe. They were so close, Draco’s breath huffed over the stubble on Harry’s cheek. He was hitting that delicious and dangerous spot where truth came with sudden clarity and no shame.
Josh brushed Harry’s hair back, then pushed up a chair and sat, leaving Draco standing alone before Harry.
Thank you so much for sticking with this little story. It was a joy for me to write it and also therapeutical, drarry always helps me through depressive stuff. Anyhow, I'm not on tumblr or anywhere interesting, but I do have a ton of other drarry fics that you can read right here if you liked this one! :) thank you to all the readers, the ones that gave kudos, the ones that commented and the ones that read it anyway!
There was a sudden pained scream. The sound made Draco snap out of his reverie, even if he had been transfixed by everything that was happening right in front of his eyes. The flogger stripes hit Harry on his back, the leather biting into his skin. The force of the impact made Harry squirm on the bench, his whole body shaking, the movement allowing Draco a glance at his cock. Hard, dripping against the bench, ignored as it should be. Draco felt his mouth water at the sight. Fucking hell, he was doomed.
‘Tell me,’ his mouth twisted in a smile and his voice rose, hoarse and unrecognizable. ‘I want you begging for my cock in your mouth like it’s the only fucking thing you want in life.’
‘Such an elaborate game, Potter. Yet, you let Draco believe you're still fucking everything that moves.’
Somehow my hand has come back to the table and my fingers are mere inches away from his. We don’t move any further.
They stood like that for some time, their breaths syncing up, Draco’s hands smoothing over Harry’s back. He helped Harry to sit on the bed, accioed his wand and shakily managed to do a warming spell. Harry looked up at him, thankful, at a complete loss for words. Draco was grateful because he couldn’t have said anything back.
He goes down the corridor, reaches the door, turns the key. I’m right behind him. We’re inside, he closes the door. I don’t look around. We don’t turn on the lights. There’s a trace of light coming from the window. It’s enough. He’s against the door, silent. The show of confidence is over.
‘Well, fuck them.’ He chortles. ‘Draco, you know I’m terrible at non-monogamy. Every one of those blokes is better off without me. It’s not really my thing. Unless- do you want to be non-monogamous? We could try- that Muggle thing-’
‘I know you hate talking feelings,’ he says very fast. ‘And I’m not the best at words either. I don’t want you to feel like you have to spill every fucking thought you have about us. But… we can’t keep doing this without talking. Some.’
I have his full attention now. His chest is heaving, the water boils, my fingers trail over the outline of my cock.
‘This isn’t me rejecting you,’ he said, his fingers on Harry’s cheek. ‘But I need to ask you something very important and then, if you want, I’ll bring you down again, safely.’ Draco paused, and his voice shook. ‘I promise I’ll keep you safe, Harry.’
‘I… I don’t strut,’ he said feebly, too aware of Malfoy’s fingers around his cock, their pressure both not enough and just enough to make him desperate for more.
The sign falls to the floor. Potter reaches for his hand and holds it between his. Even through the gloves they’re both wearing, warmth spreads from the tips of Draco’s fingers, to his palm, to his wrist, to his arm.
First, it’s only a brush of lips that feels like everything I want. And then his hands climb up my back and he’s on top of me, and my mouth opens for his tongue, and everything slows down. He tastes like sugar inside my mouth. It melts against my tongue. My fingers tangle in his hair. His moan is a breathy, broken thing that feels like a dream.
‘Obedience. I come only if you let me, if you order me to. You already know my limits. You can have anyone fuck me, I’ll do anything for you.’
There was a rush of magic crackling between them, tugging at him like a leash, his own magic rising to meet it, to yank at it. The kiss was rapidly becoming sex, Josh’s hands reaching for Draco’s cock and Harry’s magic cracked open. A frenzied sob reached his ears.
I have a second to realise I just made him snap. He pushes me hard against the table, and his erection presses against mine, real and warm. I lose my breath.
She seems to understand this intuitively, like she always does. She sits back, smiles sadly at me & I bring my head to her lap, closing my eyes. She pets my hair gently. I’m about to sob all over her perfect dress & she doesn’t even care. That’s true friendship, right there.
- that shot down his body. Fortunately, he had become quite good at hiding unwanted emotions. His hand shook minutely. Well, at least he
Draco was laying him down on one of the sofas, adjusting the cushions under him, the soft fabric brushing against his abused skin. It hurt in all the right ways, like Draco had done.
You know he’s ready, but you keep stretching him with your tongue and again with your fingers. He arches off the bed, bites off a scream, you think of swallowing his cock like this, making him spill in your mouth, but you know what he wants and it’s not that. Your fingers slip in and out of him, there’s no resistance anymore. He’s quivering, loose, so soft, it’s like you could break him if you wanted to, but you also know you might still cut yourself on his edges. Your fingers slip out of him, he whimpers. The room is spinning around you and your movements seem slow. Your cock rubs against his hole. You slick it with another wandless spell. It’s a slow slide into him. He grabs your arms and you sink deeper. It’s maddening, the way he adjusts minutely to you. He looks up. He doesn’t say it, but you grab his wrists and press them to the bed and with that  you push deeper inside him. His mouth drops open, his breath warm on your face. He can’t touch you, but he’s spread open, like he was made to be fucked by you.
‘The second seems out of character,’ he goes on. His fingers rub circles over my knee. ‘You’re not really the type to wait.’
Nothing could have stopped Harry from staring - just an order from Draco and he was relieved he’d received no such order. His mouth fell open, as he watched Malfoy’s long fingers take out his cock and wrap around it. It was long, thick and beautiful, the tip wet.
He opens his coat, then his hand drops to his trousers. You watch him unbutton and unzip with his left hand. He doesn’t say anything, just looks at you, exhaling the smoke.
I pretend to consider it, when in fact there’s nothing to consider. Potter doesn’t want to go home with that Muggle, no matter how hot he is, no matter how much he’d look good sucking Potter’s cock, no matter how much he looks like me. No matter how much they
‘You’re the farthest thing from cheap, Draco.’ He finally says, voice quiet & deep, each word drawn out clearly like a charm.
He had Draco’s marks all over him, on his neck, and back, and thighs and he wanted them there. He wanted to see the bruises there on the next day. He didn’t want to be healed. He wanted to feel Draco on him. When he moved, every time he walked, he wanted to feel him. On his skin, inside him.
Draco didn’t know if he nodded or not, but Harry dropped to his knees on the floor. Draco parted his legs and watched Harry shuffling closer, hands smoothing over the fabric of Draco’s trousers.
Harry held his gaze for a moment, breath fast and stuttering, desire climbing up his neck, his face, his mouth. Draco eased the pressure on the collar, and Harry lowered his eyes, bent his head, in waiting.
He must have felt it too. For he touches my wrist. His first touch of the night is always a shock. An ignition. I can’t make myself not react to it. My hand shakes slightly under his. He takes notice, of course he does.
There’s a ring somewhere inside his jacket on the floor. Inside my mind, I watch it shatter in pieces, as he goes deep inside me.
I'm going to need to stop posting for a few days, so that I can finish writing the last chapters (I'm nearly all done! So, don't worry!), but I do need this time to be alone with the story and the characters, so that I can give you my best writing :) I didn't want to leave it at that horrifying note, so here is a new chapter. Thank you for reading and supporting this story. Take care*
This second bit is actually true. But I read it. I also have a copy of the issue safely hidden away in my trunk. I will obviously deny this until the end of my life.
‘Is that what you want?’ Potter’s eyes are wide. ‘Do you- I mean- if you want, I mean, we could try… the poly stuff?’
After he blacked out in my arms, I levitated him here. I thought of taking him to the Hospital Wing, but somehow I didn't think he'd want that. He’d have to explain. Whatever happened to him, it's wrong. So wrong. This wasn't a fight like ours. This was something else. Something horrible- something he’s not going to want to explain to a Healer. Or anyone.
Your eyes dart over to his left arm. Of course, it’s still there. An ugly scar of cold-white. He doesn’t try to hide it from you. You care nothing for what’s left of the Mark. It says nothing about him anymore. But those scars on his chest, the scars you left there…
I watch in resigned silence as she signals the bartender and asks for a dry Martini. The drink is set between us and she turns her steely dark eyes onto me. I feel exactly like the single olive in her drink. Pierced through and through.
‘I want to,’ he said, heat spreading up his neck. ‘Maybe with lots of lube and… go slow at first, please?’
‘How desperate are you?’ he asks, bringing my wrists up above my head & keeping them there, trapped.
Her fancy black-rimmed glasses make her look like a wicked bird of prey, which I find to be a fair warning to anyone crossing her path. Too bad her best friend doesn’t come with the same kind of warnings up front. Not that those would ever work on me. My decades-long addiction to one Draco Malfoy won’t budge either way.
‘You’re right,’ he says, without moving. Quite suddenly there’s not enough space between us, my pulse beating wildly still trapped in his hands. ‘I want it so badly... it almost kills me.’
His words from before settled in a heavy, horrible knot in my chest. All I can think of is that someone hurt him, someone who’s still here, a student perhaps, someone he’s going to have to see tomorrow and everyday until the end of the year. Someone that got away with it. I have no idea what to say, all I know is that I feel sick to my stomach and angry, so angry.
Harry cast a cleaning wandless spell over the both of them. Draco was half-thankful, half-amused, and thoroughly turned-on by the display of power in any case.
The words unleashed something in Draco. His hand shot to Harry’s throat. Harry let out a broken whimper that zinged straight to Draco’s cock. His hand tightened around Harry’s neck, constricting. Harry gasped, then stopped fighting it, his body going pliant under Draco’s hands. His eyes were wide and dark, his lips wet, parted, and still he kept his posture as best as he could.
It’s too good. The way he speaks your name. The way it all feels impossible. You fuck him with slow, deep thrusts. You end up kissing him again, his hands still pressed to the mattress. He pushes up against you. You’ve never been this long inside anyone, never so aware of the slow climb towards release, never so intent on making someone lose it. You love the way he looks at you. Like he sees into you.
Malfoy’s cool grey eyes. On every fucking inch of his skin. On every part of his body. And all of it -
He doesn’t know this, but he set me free in more ways than one. After he saved me from Azkaban, I went and shaved half of my hair. Tattooed my arms the following week. I loved every second of the pain inflicted by those needles. Muggle style. Then the pink sort of happened, which in itself is saying something. Mother hates it, of course. Everything in my life used to be planned. Controlled. Now my only purpose is dancing. I do it for me, but also for him.
Thing is I decided to walk all the way over here under heavy rain, after drinking myself to a reckless sense of purpose. Even this drunk, I’m quite aware that I shouldn’t be here, not tonight, not ever. This time, it really feels like we’re over, and I was the one to break it, break us.
I can feel the push and pull of his magic building up momentum all around me. That’s when I decide to hit him with three hexes all rolled up into one. It’s a neat trick I’ve been wanting to try out. He doesn’t block it, but instead evades it, jumping quickly to the side. I hear something crash loudly somewhere in the room. He curses me, I block it, he falls down cursing me again and now my skin feels blazing hot. I no longer can tell where one spell ends and another one begins.
He shifts beside you, turning around and leaning against the balustrade. It occurs to you he’s doing it so the smoke doesn’t bother you.
This is the future. The one thing I’m scared of. The future is here and he’s leaving me. I haven’t kissed him and he’s leaving, his bright blue hair, his sweet grey eyes, his stubborn mouth. He’s everything I want and he’s saying goodbye. I’m so sure of it, I almost don’t hear what he’s actually saying.
Draco’s fingers slipped out of Harry’s mouth and his hand went for the collar, tugging at it sharply. Harry and Josh both groaned in another deep stroke.
Now, my last boyfriend, Andrew… he was the perfect cup of tea. He wasn’t exactly warm & steady Earl Grey. He was more like a mild & tasteless camomile. Good for my nerves, but, oh, was he bland.
I’m finishing another glass of wine. His hands are on his lap now, one on top of the other. The image blurs and sways in front of my eyes for a moment. Then it stops. He’s touching the ring with his fingers. He turns it on his finger. Once. My heart twists. Twice. Something tugs in my chest. Thrice. I sober up in seconds. Everything looks sharper, his pale hands, the metal band, cutting his finger. He removes the ring, slowly, decisively. It shines once on his palm. Then he makes it disappear inside his pocket. My temples throb. My mouth is dry. Dinner is over.
I leave the warmth of his bed and collect my torn robes from a chair. Even touching them is too much. I can never wear them again. I need to burn them.
His words from last night — I can’t forget them. Most days it’s as if he’s become the legend he is supposed to be. Half-unreal. Half-attached to life. Half-gone. Right now he looks more real to me than the castle walls, even if
This is what I tell myself as I make my way inside the little Muggle coffee shop Harry Potter chose for our first official date. You read that right.
I'm heartwarmed from all your wonderful comments throughout this story. Thank you again for supporting my writing and enjoying this story so much!
Our words mingle together and I’m laughing with him and then we’re kissing again and I’m sure this night is going to end with me fucking him slowly, or the other way around, I really don’t care. We’re moving, the beat drifts over us, his eyes are bright on me, then he lifts them up to look at the stars. I look at him.
He turns around and we’re so close I feel his breath on my lips. His hand curls around my neck, sweet, strong, his fingers trailing up to brush over my shaved hair.
‘If you drop me, I’ll hex you,’ I whisper against his throat. I nuzzle his neck. Gods, he smells like everything I love.
His face was burning with embarrassment. He usually begged to be fucked, sucked, spanked. But not this. Josh was the only man he usually kissed and inside the club he’d never wanted other men to kiss him. Until now. He was desperate for Draco’s mouth on his, desperate to know what it was like to be kissed by those lips that had been rimming him, sucking him, talking dirty to him, ordering him around, he wanted to know if they were demanding also on his mouth, he wanted that vicious tongue breaching him, leaving no place inside him untouched.
‘Draco.’  I know this look. Set and angry — it’s the same look that won the War in the end. ‘Who did this? Did someone-’
He could be bothered by the sound he made then, but he wasn’t. Not remotely. Not even when it turned to a fucking loud groan, not when his hips snapped up harshly, his cock disappearing inside Harry’s mouth.
‘I’m always afraid,’ he says quietly. He’s right next to me, so much so that I feel his warmth reaching the tips of my fingers still tight around the bowl.
My eyes linger on his quiet face. I notice the faint mark on his nose, left by years of wearing glasses. Even while he’s asleep he looks tired, older, thinner. The War aged us both in more ways than one.
He’s still there the next morning, lying in your rumpled sheets. He didn’t mean to, of course. You’ve seen how many extra hours he puts in at work, and you doubt he ever sleeps much. He’s as exhausted as you feel. You don’t dare to move for fear of waking him, of making him aware. Of what, you don’t even know.
Please read the tags I added for this chapter. This bit might have kinks that are not for everyone's liking!
Harry wanted to stay like that forever, his cock hard, Malfoy pressed against his pained back and arse, Malfoy’s arms around him, Malfoy’s voice on his ear.
‘After my session, I went to this Muggle place. I wanted a change. I thought turquoise would go with my eyes. The hairdresser said it made the grey pop.’
And they were always intent on Draco somehow; he refused to think on what that could mean: was Potter really
My mouth hangs open, my arm stops in the air, a folded sweater on the way to my trunk. He slants me a bright smile and I swear my heart stops for a second, kicks hard and jumps against my ribs.
He blanches. The terrible gash on his face looks even more white. Apparently he wasn’t expecting me to be this straightforward. I don’t blame him, I’m quite surprised at myself.
Draco pulled on the leash. Harry gasped, struggled to keep his position, kneeling before Draco, arms tucked behind him, head held high.
That first time he kissed me was not the beginning, but rather the point of no return. The moment he became inevitable.
There was a wire linking his body to Malfoy’s words. That was what it felt like, at least, when that question nearly had him shaking.
‘Malfoy, please…’ Harry whined. There was something about the change in name. It reminded Draco that they knew each other outside of this room, this club. It reminded him that they were Potter and Malfoy, something that had seemed impossible.
His left hand is on the table, white against the tablecloth. Lean fingers, thin, his fingernails tracing invisible patterns on the fabric. My eyes travel with that motion.
His lips stretch in a sort of smile. His focus shifts entirely to your cock. His lips part. He breathes deeply and the warmth of his breath sips through the fabric of your pants. Even before he moves to do it, you know he’s going to be good. So good at it.
‘She’s fine,’ Pansy’s fingernails caress my hair. ‘A bit worried about her best friend going all suicidal saviour again.’
‘It’s okay, Pans. I just need to not see him again. I can’t be around him. I need to forget about him. Move on.’
He wanted Draco Malfoy to spread him open and fuck him. His whole body was screaming for it, loud and clear, his hole still stretched and wet from Draco’s tongue.
This is getting ridiculous. Playing the same script every night, but somehow it never gets boring. Rather, it sends my body into a frenzy. I fucking hate it.
Content warning: this chapter is a graphic description of a rape scene. It involves Draco, but it does NOT involve Harry (meaning, Harry doesn’t rape Draco, someone else does). If this triggers you, please skip this chapter. If you decide to read, I’m hoping you do it in the safest way possible for you. Also, please remember there’s a happy ending at the end of this story. Thank you for sticking with this fic.
‘Well, yes. He’d be more of one. Plus, he’d make an enemy out of me for the rest of his miserable life.’
‘It’s fine if you like him, Harry.’ She says after a while. She always saw right through me and I fumble for an explanation.
The rules were supposed to help. They were meant to remind us we have nothing serious. Instead, they just ended up showing me how much I want him to break them all for me. How much I always wish he’d spend the night. How much I want him to kiss me without trying to get me naked.
Draco’s other hand trailed up Harry’s thigh. He leaned over and forced Harry to bend his knees, lifting his legs up. Harry groaned at the feel of Draco’s cock finally rubbing against his own. He wasn’t hard, but he would be, sooner than later. He already felt his cock responding to the contact, swelling slowly. Draco pressed his palm against both their cocks and Harry fought to not arch back into the touch. Malfoy had forbidden him to move. He trembled when Malfoy’s teeth bit on his nipple. They were so close, still not close enough.
I watch as her eyes make a slow tour of the room I’ve been living in. Discarded Kleenexes, several bottles of Firewhisky, half empty flasks of potions, dirty glasses everywhere. It’s like watching a stranger’s life through another’s eyes. I watch her eyebrows go up. Her eyeliner is on point, as per usual. Her nose wrinkles slightly.
‘Kiss me,’ Draco said. He didn’t know where it came from, that tone that was both an order and a request.
Draco nodded. He stepped back and used the hand crank on the cross to tilt it back. Harry let his head fall back, breathing deeply, adjusting to the sensation of being nearly horizontal, after hours standing up.
His first impulse was saying love had nothing to do with it. This was fucking. Not even that, this was tying up a man and showing him his rightful place at his feet. This was… Malfoy and Potter. Impossible. Crazy. Dreamlike.
I wonder if this way of speaking is required of Slytherins or if it just rubs on them the longer they spend with each other. Either way, it makes me feel on edge.
You both make the wandless cleaning spells at the same time, your magic fusing up, entangling. He gets up. All of a sudden you feel quite awkward. The last time you came in your pants you were a teenager who knew nothing of sex.
It comes from very far away. Like someone speaking from above a well, when I'm all the way down here, echoes of my name.
‘But since you’re mine…’ Draco let the word linger between them. ‘You’d behave no matter what, wouldn’t you?’
It felt like walking in a dream, that moment when you know it can’t be real, but everything still looks more real than your actual life when you wake up. Draco was unaware of the people surrounding them, of the flashes of lights. His vision was tunneling down to the only thing that mattered.
The cigarette drops to the floor. He looks up at me. I forget every fucking thing I meant to say. His eyes drift to my lips. I wonder if he likes my new piercing.
You land on your living room. You thought it better than Apparating directly to your room. You want to give him the option. You ask him if he wants anything. He just stares at you, like your question is absurd. You take your coat off and drop it off on a chair. He does the same.
We stare at each other. Come to think about it, it’s something we’ve both been doing a lot. Staring and staring until one of us gets a reaction out of the other. Any kind of reaction. He has a week-old bruised lip and jaw to match my bruised chest and arms. He really did quite the job on me with those hexes. He’s
Harry let his head fall on the crook of his neck and inhaled, not wanting to acknowledge the presence of anyone else in the room just yet. He wanted Draco’s scent on him forever. He wished he didn’t have to let go. He closed his eyes.
Some dinners he folds his napkin neatly on the table. I came to hate that gesture. I look up then, he nods once, his grey eyes like glass, empty of all feeling. He turns his back on me. I know those are the nights he’s expected home. The nights he can’t escape. Those are also the nights he breaks my heart all over again.
Her face tells me sitting in a bar with Harry Potter is perhaps the last thing she wants to do with her time.
‘But you don’t want them.’ He says softly. ‘You think you’re behind this wall… that no one sees you. But I see the way you look at me. There’s no wall, sometimes. I like it. I like it when there’s no wall.’
He noticed Josh was leaning over Harry, kissing his jaw, speaking to him, and Harry was murmuring something back. Draco let them say goodbye, his heart hammering somewhere on his navel, and on his fingers, and on is throat.
‘I know you’re not fucking anyone else either, Draco. I’ve known it since the first time. And it definitely isn’t for lack of options. Which means… you’ve been throwing them down.’
I almost feel sober at the sight of his door. It’s only for the barest moment, but there’s something so real about it, so right. The dark wood is hard evidence amidst this world turned to grey. I stagger for the door like a man who’s lost all sense of self-preservation. Yeah, the War changed me. Look at me.
Malfoy kept pinching his nipples harshly, one at a time, making them hard between his fingers, then pressing the tip of the cane there, playing, twisting them mercilessly. The pain was sharp and wonderful.
From the shadows he watched as Josh fastened Harry’s hands and ankles to the spanking bench, so that Harry was bent over the leather, his back, arse and legs completely exposed to everyone on that side of the room. A welcoming sight for sure. On the other side, Draco had been faced with those eyes, no glasses, nothing to save him from facing them. And they were looking everywhere, wildly searching the room for something.
They both laugh. I laugh too, my chest collapsing with the force of it. My hand falls over his. It stays there. Our fingers twine together. Parkinson smiles.
It’s not what I meant to say & it’s not what he was expecting either. He exhales a little breath. It’s his time to pretend:
I shiver when his fingers unexpectedly brush against my cheek, catching a stubborn strand of my hair. He tucks it behind my ear, all sweet & too close. Yet, he says nothing at all.
I don’t know why or when I start to cry. I just realise it’s happening when his tongue reaches my hole. I collapse on the bed, biting into the pillow to keep the sounds in. He eats me out like I’m his favourite dessert. He is in no rush to move things forward, in fact, he could probably do this the rest of the night. Make me come like this, without ever touching my dick, without even fingering me. The idea makes me feel like I’m going mad, my brain screaming things I’d never say, terrible things like
‘You think I don’t know that?’ He asks me. His hand reaches out again and finds mine. This time, I don’t recoil from it. His fingers cover mine. His hand is as warm as I remember. As steady.
Draco does not smile. He feels frozen on the spot, and that’s the only reason he doesn’t bolt. That’s also the reason he notices the sign Potter is holding in his hands. Plain white with large words written on it.
‘I mean with you. I sleep better with you. I feel better the next day. I hate the next night, back at my apartment. When I’m not —’ He stops, fights himself on the next word, but for a while nothing comes out.
‘I know the new improved you doesn’t give a single fuck about people's feelings. Maybe you're trying to even the scales out, because of that one time you played the fucking martyr, died for everyone and all that noble crap. Very commendable. But Draco's starting to look like collateral damage and that pisses me off.’
Harry’s answer was a wide smile. Dimples formed at the corner of his lips when he looked down - at his soft cock, covered in come that was drying up, then at Draco’s ruffled, dirty clothes, his hard cock covered in Harry’s come. They’d made a mess of themselves, really.
Draco felt like crying out. His cock was in heaven, there was no other way to put it. His fingers traced a path over Harry’s cheek, feeling for the swell of his cock under the skin. Harry pulled back, spit trailing from Draco’s cock to his lips.
‘Of course there is,’ I say. I have this vision of a life where Potter is my boyfriend and this, right here, our hands, his closeness, Pansy talking to us about her flings, is normal. ‘Go enjoy your night,’ I tell her, my mind reeling.
‘I think I’m into you. I think I’ve been into you for years. I’m probably ruining everything now. But even if you won’t speak to me again, even if you file for a new partner at work… I need you to know. I like you. Like, really like you.’
I take some time to get the full meaning of his words. I don’t even notice the jumper falling to the floor again.
Wanted to tear him apart, hurt him, fuck him good, spell him better and do it all over again. And again.
His cock was sliding over Harry’s tongue. Draco trashed on the couch, his hand tight on Harry’s hair, the other pumping his cock. It only took one pull, really. He came with an ear-splitting cry and watched as his come spilled over Harry’s tongue, down Harry’s lips, down his chin. He rubbed his length against Harry’s cheeks, and Harry let him, tongue darting out to lick every trace he could get to. He had a look of total bliss on his face, like he’d waited a lifetime for this.
I drain the rest of my Firewhisky, enjoying the burn down my throat. I set the glass on the counter. Ten drinks.
It goes without saying that my efforts are basically useless. Parkinson never bothers disguising her contempt for anything, much less her least favourite person in the world, aka, me.
He just starts unzipping my pants. Cold sweat breaks at my temple. My entire body tenses, like I’m in a full body-bind and can’t get rid of it. He’s saying something to me but I can’t make out the words. It’s like my whole mind is foggy, and the only coherent thought is my wand, I need to reach it.
‘He was one of the Ravenclaw’s Beaters? A seventh year?’ I know he knows exactly who I’m speaking of. ‘Everyone’s talking about it, it’s the biggest news since your breakup with Weasley made the cover of Witch Weekly months ago-’
‘Eager, are we?’ Malfoy’s voice was low. It made Harry want to fall down on his knees and suck Malfoy’s cock. He was ashamed at the thought. He hadn’t even satisfied his Doms - Josh, sitting comfortably on a sofa nearby, watching them and probably pulling at his hard cock and Malfoy standing right behind him, sadistic smile and crop in hand - he didn’t deserve the gift of cock.
‘Privacy, Draco. I didn’t want them messing with us. With you. Because, contrary to what you think, I do care about you. You’re not a hookup. You were never a hookup. I didn’t want them nosing around your life, harassing you or bothering you with invasive questions. I know about the crap they put you through after the War. No matter how much I hate it, anyone who dates me will have the press on them. I wanted us to be away from all of that bulshit, at least until we knew what we were doing.’
I’m never as lonely as I walk through the dark corridors of Hogwarts. I get to wander freely all over the castle; no need for my cloak anymore. Everything feels out of turn, out of place. This used to be home. It’s more of a graveyard now. All the ghosts — the real ones — are gone since the Battle. No one knows why. I didn’t know I’d miss them this much. It’s as if they left a hole.
It’s as if I’ve flipped a switch. His hands come up to my hips, he grinds up & insane pleasure flares up inside me. I start to come the second he kisses me, fucking me hard & good. The kiss is endless, his mouth no longer leaves mine, I’m shaking, my orgasm ripping through me, shattering me, I stop listening, stop seeing, but his mouth is still on mine. I come up for air.
I catch his eyes on me from across the room, his face struck in green, white, blue, yellow, purple, pink. I move to the beat, against the pain, the past, the whole wide world. It keeps the war at bay, but I don’t do it to forget. I remember everything I did.
The grey eyes were dark, like a gathering storm. He did it again. Just to be sure he wasn’t imagining it.
‘Fuck me,’ he murmured. He heard Malfoy suck in a hard breath. ‘Draco, please, fuck me open… I need… I need your cock...’ Malfoy’s mouth opened over his neck and he bit down, harshly, Harry crying out at the sudden pain, but his body giving in to it almost instantaneously.
‘That was a simple yes or no question,’ Draco said, letting each word drop as a warning, heat coursing through his body. ‘You’re in luck that I like you talking back to me...’
With his left hand he had Harry Potter on a leash, with his right he controlled Harry’s painfully hard cock, and his words did the rest. The rush he felt was similar to those seconds immediately before orgasm.
Malfoy chuckled. It was deep and drawn out. Harry noticed a hint of arousal in it. His cock gave a jolt. He wanted to know if Malfoy was as hard as he was, but he dared not buck back against him, to make their bodies touch. He felt pinned in place without Malfoy needing to say or do anything.
I look up at him, the table between us. He looks devastated, on the other side of the world. There’s some part of me that delights in the fact that I was the one to put that look on his face. He hates the idea of anyone else having me. Problem is: I hate it too.
We’re anonymous bodies, drunk on alcohol & bad blasting music. Except there’s nothing anonymous about us. He knows exactly who I am when he grinds against me. I know exactly who he is when he feels me up. That doesn’t stop us from playing the game every lonely stranger plays in clubs like this. We let the crowd & the flashing lights render us unknown. We dance the night away, bodies pressed up to each other, closer than we’ve ever been. He feels both familiar & strange, his scent addictive, his body pliant & strong, hands intent on committing every hard ridge & every soft spot of my body to physical memory. That’s how I become another one of the pretty boys he likes to pin to a wall. He kisses up my neck, but when I try to reach for his mouth, he denies me, turning his face away. I’ve seen him kiss enough blokes on this same dancefloor to notice the difference in treatment. I feel dirty & wrong, but even that feels strangely right. He smiles at me, a secret smile, meant for my eyes only, everything about it so unsettling. His lips brush the corner of my mouth, then part on a sweet exhale that makes my head spin.
‘Yeah, I don’t get it either. Who wouldn’t want him?’ he chuckled and shook his head. ‘Point is: I’m fine with it. He wants you. We thought you’d make an offer again, but since you didn’t… There’s more to it, but that’s for him to tell you. So… what do you say?’
So when he moves again, there’s no hesitation, no doubt. He grabs me like I’m there for the taking. That’s when it hits me. The heartbreaking bit. I know he’s going to break my heart when this — whatever this is — ends. Because it will.
I should have known it, then. He’s always been there for me, lingering on the side of impossible things. Kneeling on the dimly lit bathroom, he makes quite the picture. Hair rumpled from my hands, white shirt clinging to his chest, a thin sheen of sweat over his brow, the faint traces of the famous lightning scar still visible. I resist the shameful urge to touch it with my fingers.
It’s just my name in a whisper, but his voice has this way of reaching deep and untangle things for me. I can’t bear to say goodbye. Leaving Hogwarts and leaving him — it’s too much. I look up and let him see it. And then he says something completely unexpected.
He searches for his cigarette silver case, fishes it from his coat pocket, but just shuffles it between his hands.
He looked at Draco, the grey eyes were so close. There was something welling up in them, some emotion.
The smirk flickered over Draco’s lips and he moved forward, slow and purposeful. This time he did not stop, he kept going, watching Harry all the while, pressing through. Harry had had bigger cocks inside him and usually they were a disappointment. It wasn’t about the size, it was about what you did with it, and Draco knew what he was doing, he kept going in one continuous motion, letting Harry adjust to stretch and burn. Harry did not look away from Draco, as he kept breathing deep, his muscles tensing and relaxing, waiting for the moment the pain would recede and shift, pleasure burning him and tangling with the pain.
Someone needs to break this spell. One of us needs to say something to defuse this. Something mocking, something spiteful. But none of us does.
Draco reaches Potter’s desk, bottles up the ink. Then, he straightens the piles of files. A frame is dropped face down on the desk. He lifts it up. The Golden Trio smiles up at him. Granger and Weasley on either side of Potter. They’re all laughing, scarves blowing in the wind. Wide green eyes jump right at him. He puts the frame face down again and steps back.
At detention we just sit in a classroom in an angry silence. We’re supposed to be doing homework, but I haven’t got a clue what that might be. I’ve been missing most classes since the year started. I can’t imagine what the study program for each of those is. He has his parchment and books out, but he’s crossly glaring at the desk he’s sitting at, like he could easily burst a hole on the surface with the mere power of his stare.
‘Come for me, Harry,’ Draco’s voice was barely a whisper, but it reached inside Harry and liberated the last restraint on his will.
Thank you also @Faylinn for your support in all my stories. Your delight in this one means a lot to me.
‘But that’s the thing,’ He says, voice so quiet. His whole expression softens. ‘You don’t treat me like shit. At least you haven’t, not in years. And definitely not as long as we’ve been…’
‘I don't know…’ the smirk was unavoidable. ‘Think you can make me come with only that pretty face of yours?’
His magic tingles over my skin. My clothes dry instantly and I remember what warmth feels like. I still feel dizzy from the all the wine I drank tonight, but now he’s so close I forget I’m supposed to be mad at him, for some reason I don’t even understand.
‘Merlin, Harry, aren’t you a sight,’ Josh said as he got up and moved behind Harry, his cock hard and slick from Harry’s mouth. He finally took off his shirt, his chest shining with sweat. His hands trailed down Harry’s back.
I pull him down so that his lips are right there, finally. I nip slowly at his piercing. Draco gasps. Then we’re kissing. It feels inevitable, just waiting to happen. His mouth simply falls open for my tongue, and then we’re slow and purposeful. I’m struck by insanity or maybe this is the first moment of sanity in months. This is what I want. It doesn’t have to make sense.
Trust is more about faith than it is about blindly following someone. The Dark Lord never understood the difference. Harry Potter is someone people can believe in. Someone I can believe in. He won the War because people needed to believe in something and they believed in him. I still believe in him and I don’t think my trust is misplaced. No matter what we did to each other, everything’s different now.
For the first time in his life, Draco did not know what his face was showing, but it must have been quite obvious because Josh made an understanding sound.
I keep nodding, like this is the only thing I know how to do. He waves something in front of my face.
Potter looks breathless. Draco has never felt more lost. Of all the things he’s imagined, this isn’t one of them.
Harry swallowed Josh in one go. He breathed harshly through his nose, his throat working under the constricting collar.
That voice… that voice was doing something to him. It was cold, demanding with a hint of care underneath. Harry felt so vulnerable, tied and naked in front of this man he had hated once, a man he’d known for years. Since the end of the War, they had been nothing but civil, passing each other several times a day in the halls at the Ministry, and talking politely. Harry knew Malfoy was a changed man. At least, he knew enough to be sure Malfoy wouldn’t go to the press with this.
