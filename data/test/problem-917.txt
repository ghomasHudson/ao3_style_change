"Harry is deserving of that love more than any person I know. I also see that the affection is returned. I want the best person for Harry and the lengths Draco is going for me, I think he is the person for Harry." Hermione smirked at the elder woman.A matching look was on the elder witches face and a look of understanding was passed between the two.
"Draco your Home!" Harry squeaked jumping to his feet leaving Teddy on the floor playing, Harry walked up to the tall blond reaching out a small hand to touch Draco's arm.
"What do you mean Draco?" Harry asked eye's concerned
"If you really think it will help you find the truth then how can I say no. " Harry managed to say
"Every single time He would choke me or hit me . Every time he took me I got used to the pain. He would occasionally Burn me with his wand over my curse scar from the war and said it was as ugly as I am. Over what I assume days I noticed he kept me drugged half aware, He was always brutal and constantly talked about rapeing me over and over. He was always careful to keep me on contraceptive potions, one small mercy He didn't want any filthy half-blood children running around." Hermione said her resolve finally breaking, she burst into hot ugly tears leaning her head into Sue's warm hands.
"And have you spoken about this to Lord Flint?" Gloria asked.
"Mother Floo Aunt Andromeda we need all hands on deck she can stay here with Teddy until further notice I will need you to be the potion runner as they get done. Madam Pomfrey will be here within the next hour or so, arrange for her and Andromeda to join me in the first guest room. Harry take Arthur to the floo get George, here we need a brewer while I'm busy helping Madam Pomfrey in fact have Charlie come to so he can help you with Teddy and Altair . You need to also keep away for awhile I will come to you when she is stable enough for visits. Please send up Madam when she gets here, I need you to coordinate everyone here." Draco barked out As Harry and Arthur appeared near him.
Harry blinked at her just now remembering that they did have a small blood connection, he had a small amount of Black blood.
"I have never been more touched and proud by our bond then I am today." Draco beamed at Marcus.
"I am willing to do whatever it takes I want to know the truth. I loved the Weasley's like Family I thought they loved me as one of them too." Harry said softly silent tears rolled out of green eyes only to be caught by long pale fingers sweeping over Harry's face.
"Thank you a very watered down version of the Marauders story." Hermione pulled Teddy up to her lap and peppered kisses to his cheek he giggled.
"You never approached Miss Granger for Romantic attachment or marriage?" Her lawyer paced in front of the platform.
"No he would not even talk to me in those two weeks after the Battle I assumed he was grieving his brother and did not want to discuss personal matters between us. I thought he was embarrassed by his spontaneity and did not want to formally court me until he dealt with his family's grief." Hermione added.
"If I find any who would attempt to stand against the House of Potter-Black- Malfoy you will find yourselves in Azkaban for attempted assault, Line theft, and possible attempted homicide and anything else I feel like!" Susan Bones yelled out to the assembled.
"They are also allowing same sex marriges, That means you need to have a conversation with Oliver, Percy." Hermione smiled at her favorite Weasley who blushed.
"He's weak, really weak and can barely stand Mother. I'm worried I think we need to bring in a healer we can trust. I need to stop over at Spinner's End and grab some potion ingredients and potions from Uncle Sev's store's." Draco sighed as she fed the infant in her arms rocking him back and forth.
"I want to be with you. " Hermione said slowly.
" I would feel better If I could be allowed to make a Portkey to the location for everyone else right now I am the only one I trust to Apperate Harry anywhere He is still in the primary recovery stages. I would not stop him from going because I know him fretting would delay his recovery ." Draco reluctantly.
"OK boys she's obviously been traumatized she needs care and saint Mungo's will be to much for her she needs special care. I think Harry needs to be the one to approach her if she'll go with him can you see to her care Draco." Susan asked quietly.
"Kingsley has agreed the press will spread the word that you will make a statement. Within the hour and be under Veritaserum." Draco walked back into the room, his ears a bit red from embarrassment.
"My Mother." Hermione posed sadly.
Hermione recited a story to both young boys. Teddy sat clapping his hands and Altair lay on the rug next to her, she smiled tenderly at the boys. They were her world now and she was determined to be the fun Auntie Mione they deserved.
Draco gave Harry a soft smile not replying his eye's, Darkening to a deep storm cloud Grey, Draco's thoughts drifted away from Harry who watched on wanting to do something for the man who saved him who gave him a home and a reason to want to keep living.
"The Rune carved plate that was removed By Madam Pomfrey with Andromeda Tonks Present correct?' Sue nodded.
"Mione." He called softly, her head jerked her head up seeing his scared face tentatively she touched the largest scar that ran down into his Jaw.
"You be a good boy for your Great Aunty Cissy , Your cousin Draco ,and your Godfather Harry I love you and will see you in a few day's." Ruffling his silky locks and turning around and leaving before another word could be said Andromeda Left the manor.
Hermione and blinked watching as Marcus took position in front of the Door again as Cissy closed it. Hermione blinked as Nacissia flew into the huge walk-in closet leaving her to her own alone with her thoughts, it took her longer then she would ever admit but after a few moments Marcus' actions and Cissy's words clicked into place.
"When I was younger and stupid, I had a crush on her but after the War Mum set me right about Mudbloods and their place,she wanted pureblood grandkids and my older brother had already fucked up and given her a fucking creature kid. Charlie will never marry, Percy is to fucking gay, Geroge only likes that black cunt, All that was left was me and Gin to give her what she wanted." Ron sneared.
"Why didn't you come to me?" George looked hurt that his adopted brother felt the need to leave.
" Can I see the baby?" He hesitantly asked, Draco smiled still eating his snack when he was done he stood and escorted Harry to a large beautiful nursery. The infant was dozing lightly in a beautifully hand carved baby cot. Harry reached out a thin hand softly touching the bundle relieved the baby was safe and sound warm and fed.
"No Draco has my trust and only has my well being in mind." Harry said sure of himself for the first time since walking into the building.
"Hermione I know it's unpleasant but I have an invigoration potion here I need you to take it. It will give you the strength to travel." Draco held a vile out brown eyes stared into grey orbs making up her mind she opened her mouth for Draco to tip the potion down.
"What did the Boy do now!" A slim blond woman with more neck than she needed raced down the stairs when she reached the living room and tried to comfort the sobbing boy.
"The... the first time he raped me, Ron.. Ron said it was my fault he had to take matters into his own hands. He...He... I was a virgin. It hurt so much. I remember screaming as loud as I could and kept screaming after that. I could not even count the day's the charms on the windows were always set to night either that he drugged me during the day while he was away. He rarely brought me food if I had to guess every 5 days or so it was hard to keep time. He rarely talked only when he was super pissed did he talk, Talked mainly about how I was a cold hearted bitch to spurn his advances and how I should have just laid down like the whore I am." Hermione began tripping over her tongue.
"Bye Kings love you." Hermione smiled turning from the Old Order member and took Marcus' outstretched hand which was once again secured in his elbow.
"Ron has been arrested sweetie hes never gonna see the light of day not if I have anything to say about it. Will you allow me to cast some magic to help you?" Harry asked waiting until Hermione nodded again.
Draco watched his brother slink away in defeat, He hated seeing the elder Wizard like that but hoping it would light a fire in his brother. Perhaps enough to get him to approach Hermione. All he could do now is hope.
"You do know Hermione well enough to know she will never stand for anyone asking her to Marry them under this stupid law just to save her from the unknown. She would not stand for us to be unhappy she has already taken off from the room." Percy stated to the rest of the room once the congratulations died down.
"He may have never punished his Slytherin's in front of the school, it was the first rule of Slytherin, any dispute in house stayed in house. He was just as harsh with us if not harsher he always expected better from us. The cauldrons I scrubbed without magic still haunt my nightmares. '' Draco fondly chuckled pausing briefly . " You are wrong about one thing though Harry you were special to him he hated that you were, but you were he cared so much it killed him almost literally." Draco laughed running his hand through his hair almost nervously.
"Let's Start with Your Relationship to Ron, When did it start." Sue asked.
"Fuck." Yelled Charlie.
"Do you think we could look into buying one of the old Potter properties?" Harry asked suddenly the pure selfish request from Harry caused Draco to look at the small dark haired man. "Not that I don't love the Manor but I would like something from my old Family." Harry muttered hurriedly afraid he said the ungrateful thing Draco just smiled
Hermione fidgeted between Marcus and Narcissa, Hermione shivered from her seat Between Marcus and Narcissa She had just finished giving her side of the story to the full session of the Wiz, Still shaking from the truth serum effects. Her lawyer (She did not catch his name) hired by Marcus was now questioning Ron under the same potion she sniffed slightly only to have Marcus hand her his handkerchief, she gave him a watery smile in return.
"Marcus Be a Dear and take Hermione home for me, I need to make a quick trip to Diagon Alley. Harry and Draco probably have left by now." Cissy turned at that moment to the young pair and smiled at the site of Hermione's hand safely tucked into Marcus' Arm.
Harry Potter woke next to a soft hand running fingers thru his hair a feminine voice humming softly to him. He felt warm and cared for this was how he always imagined his mother caring for him, waking him gently with warm hands and a sweet voice. His eyelids fluttered open he blinked up and saw the beautiful face of Narcissa Malfoy she continued to run her hand thru
"Talk about what Harry? Talk about how once again my life is being dictated by the stupidity of the Wizarding world? Or do you want me to talk about how just when I find a semblance of normality in the utter turmoil that is my life it gets ripped from me? Or how about just when I find Family again they are taken from me once again? Is that what you want me to talk about?"Hermione bit back sarcastically.
Hermione paused for a moment to look around the little table at the faces of what was Harry's new family, Her new family if she allowed herself to have it.
"Please Harry you will never get on her bad side you will always be innocent in her mind all you have to do is bat your eyes at her and she'll go to war for you." Draco Laughed. They watched the Window and saw Susan bring in Arthur Weasley Susan asked to put the Weasley Family Head under truth serum She fired question after question at the Older man when she was satisfied with him not having to do with hurting Harry in anyway. She released him and one by one questioned the Weasley Children Bill , Charlie ,George.
"Then you have nothing to lose by being honest now why you still have the freedom to do so don't you think. Choose to embrace the feelings while you are allowed to have them. Go talk to that large slice of Man that normally trails around after you like a lost puppy, Hell snog the crap out of him better yet, have sex with him, have one moment with the man you chose and use that hold on to that one moment." Gloria goaded.
The News of the marriage Law hit the Wizarding world like a tsunami it raged for weeks after the announcement. Of the Unwed Weasley men Only Charlie was unable to find a fiance in a week, George had popped the question to Angelina the next day, Percy had finally confronted his long time crush Oliver Wood and told him everything to his shock Oliver swept Percy up and kissed him then dragged him directly to the Ministry and had the minister marry them.
"Well Kingsley gave us a bit of warning to help find Hermione someone who would protect her. As for Harry well." Draco smirked getting down on one knee in front of Harry and opened the ring box he held. "I had hoped this would come a bit later for us but I love you Harry for a while now long before you came here. I want to be with you and hope you will choose to remain here with me and our son. Will you marry me?" Draco added with a smile. Harry blinked at the silver ring in the box. It was a simple band with an emerald set in it, Hermione helped Draco choose it from among the many tresures in the Malfoy Vault.
"He won't Hurt me." Hermione asked, afraid.
"Lock fine, understand have to protect Baby." Hermione nodded enthusiastically Harry held out his hands as she reached for him. He helped her settle the cloak around her Harry helped her back to the others.
Harry made sure to keep a close eye on Hermione after Ron's Trial. He was glad to see Hermione open up more; she spent more time with Cissy who encouraged her to see a mind Healer. So far over the last two weeks Hermione has seen Gloria Goyle-Hearting, a squib who was fortunate to receive her mother's support and became a muggle therapist, Three times.
"Draco what oh my dear Merlin!" She screamed, spying Hermione limp in Draco's arms.
They got to the large department store they went straight for the baby stuff and started looking at strollers. Harry was the one to put a price on what they could buy. They got a showroom model stroller for almost half of what it cost the sales lady showed them how to adjust it to fit the baby who was promptly settled and strapped in. They bought boxes of diapers in a couple sizes for the boy boxes of wipes, bottles of rash cream, powder , piles of baby clothing in most sizes, socks ,and shoes for the boy. Three diaper bags one for each of them to always have everything they need for the boy. They walked out of the baby stuff to the men's department and fit Harry into a few new outfits Harry tried to protest but found Draco deaf to them, so resigned himself to being spoiled a bit. They left the big department store they turned the corner and stealthily packed the Green diaper bag with diapers wipes diaper cram and two outfits, shrunk the remainder of their purchases and put them in the blue diaper bag. And walked their way back to the Leaky cauldron it only took them a half hour neither wanting to Apparate they were content to act like muggles.
"Yes to look for my parents I obliviated their memories before I left with Harry to Hunt the pieces of Voldermorts soul. I went to go find them to see if I could lift the obliviate I was cleared by Kingsley to take a healer and a Portkey." Hermione nodded.
"I love you Marcus." She curled her hand into his shirt clinging to him.
"What a generous Lady, your Honor has been restored by your champion Ron Weasley is found guilty of all charges, is there anything any others would like to add at this time before I close this session?" The CW gave Hermione an approving nod.
"You always questioned my loyalty to Lucius and my Son, Dromeda before the Dark lord before the hatred that was how my husband was soft and tender, he changed once the Dark Lord approached and led my husband away from me. I stayed only because it was to late I was so sick trying to conceive a child and then my Miracle boy My strong Dragon, I had to stay for him to keep him safe, I had no one to turn to no family or so I felt. Mom and Dad dead , the aunts and uncles dead , Sirius in Azkaban with Bella, Reg Dead, and my sister not wanting anything to do with me because I loved the man our parents arranged for me. Kinda hypocritical of you sister" Cissy said primly sipping her tea as if unaffected. Andromeda Black was a coward and she knew it she hurt her little sister, and now her little sister was showing her exactly what she had caused. But Her sister was not done with her yet. " Not only did you turn from me but from a boy who needed you a boy who is Family Not only was he our cousins godson but the godfather of your grandson, Grandson to Aunt Dorea a Black by blood right , A little boy your daughter fought for cared for , your son-in-law's nephew the son of his best friends ! But you ignored his pain because you were too selfish to see beyond yourself , to selfish to see a little boy who needed the only family he had left in the world that baby!"
Hermione handed Bill the baby rose from her seat tentatively stepping towards Percy; she stumbled a bit as she walked but was steadied by the large warm hand of the only man in the room she didn't know she blinked up and saw his dark eyes were soft and warm, His firm grip on her was light barely any pressure, it kept her upright as she stumbled. When she was in reaching the distance of Percy it fell away and she was folded into Percy's arms.
" Yes I am he was a true master of potions, I have found his notes on several that he was experimenting with and they are astounding, He was close to a cure for werewolves in them he notes that no more good people like Lupin would suffer if he had any say in it. I have been trying to continue his work but I just don't have his gift with potions." Draco mused and Harry thought he was not being completely honest, but Harry didn't press him just removed himself from Draco's lap that he had unwittingly been sitting on Draco frowned slightly when Harry moved.
Hermione pulled away from the third eldest Weasley and blinked at Draco before nodding.
"Are you sure you were sorted correctly Hermione? That is worthy of any Slytherin." Draco blinked at the witch who blushed prettily.
"If that is the case Hermione will you join me?" Draco rubbed his chin in thought.
"No I can't bear to tell you Perseus as there are already more people than I'd like that will hear about it. I understand wizard law and must have a pureblood to protect my interest. That's Marcus in this case and Draco and Harry have to look like uninterested Third parties Cissy as dowager Malfoy is seen as a Motherly support, I could not stand to have my whole family know the details. Please go and tell the others I send my love." Hermione replied knowing full well she had to play the Wizarding system.
Graphic Death
"Double Fuck" Geroge sighed.
"The obliviate could not be undone?" Harry noted her face.
"I don't know how to thank you." He began nervously feeling loads better already.
"Once you stabilize her she may react to you. I suggest you get Harry here. She responds to him, I will leave you lady's to her." He nodded ducking out of the room. He hurried away spying Harry standing with Three red heads Draco smiled at the men gathered around Harry protectively.
"At least Draco is smart enough to not piss Mione off, Perhaps you hitting him in third year was good for something." Harry smiled laughing softly.
"Knew you'd know what I was getting on about." Sue smiled at Hermione taking her hands adding. "I know this is going to be rough, Hermione at any time you are uncomfortable sharing a tidbit with the three of us we can stop."
Harry blinked at the man, stunned, remembering what Narcissia had just told him about her son's determination to see him Harry better.
"Marcus was supposed to be a Puff but his family much like mine were all Slytherin for ages. Marcus won't stand for what's been done to Hermione he does not hold with rape. He could use a new home and a purpose even if it's only being the muscle I trust him." Draco smiled.
"Of course Draco, If it threatens our family then I will pick it apart with a fine tooth comb." Hermione sat up straight a fire in her Brown eyes.
"Yes it is my Intention to show Harry how to become a proper Hair and Lord as it is his birth right and it was kept from him by the person who was supposed to care for him the most. I want a thorough investigation and legal recourse into any illegal doings . It's my intention to find out exactly everything Dumbledore did with Harry's money and return it to him. It is apparent he took advantage of an orphan boy whom he kept ignorant . Share any information about this matter with the DMLE, I mean to give Harry Justice for his suffering he will have a better life then what Dumbledore planned for him I'll see to it personally. " Draco said gravely, folding his hands together, the leader of the goblin nation waved his hand and his subordinates fled the room.
"Indeed Harry Is correct Lord Malfoy Is Mr. Potter well enough to Apperate a passenger?" Susan looked to Draco who thought for a moment.
"Thank you." He said, placing a hand to his head as it throbbed in pain.
"Lord Malfoy it is indeed an honor to meet the new Malfoy head hopefully you will rise to the job. However it has come to my attention that Hair Potter has asked you to be his proxy and this worries me as up until his death the Proxy of the Potter fortune was Alubus Dumbledore and once he passed Mr. Potter never came in to make a new proxy or take over for himself. This has me curious as to what does and does not know about his inheritance ." Ragnok spoke as Draco Handed him the stack of papers he had Harry Fill out. Giving the goblin time to read over everything that Harry could think of to write to the bank.
"Hermione you know I will chase you all over this house until you actually talk about it." Harry growled.
"That does make a scary amount of sense." Charlie blinked at the girl.
Thousands are outraged over the news of Harry Potter boy who is living at Malfoy Manor with what remains of the Deatheater's family. The public worries about the safety of their savior! I for one am Appalled to find that the boy who defeated the Dark Lord living in the place where so many were kept captive Potter's friends among them.
"Okay if you're sure about this, Then I will marry you." Hermione said finally. Marcus smiled at her with a full wide smile, a startling expanse of roguish delight. Reaching next to him and gathering the ring from the box, Hermione held up her left hand and allowed Marcus to put the ring on her finger. Then gathered her again in both of his arms kissing her again as the light breeze whipped around them and the scent of the flowers danced around them.
"Ronald Billius Prewett Weasley." The monotone was curt.
"Thank you Marcus! Thank you." Hermione flung her arms around Marcus' neck and sobbing into his shoulder.
"So it's hopeless he wont have a home?" Harry's smile dropped green eyes going flat Draco smiled
"Marcus is a sweet man, he must have taken the news as hard as I." Hermione sighed.
"Ok Harry close your eyes now think back to the first thing you remember, the magic will direct your memories from there we will only see important events that pertain to your mistreatment." Susan said softly tapping her wand to the table a pensive floated down from the ceiling Harry smiled at the object. It floated to a stop and hovered over the table and glowed its silvery sheen. It made a small stream of soft light that connected to Harry's temple.
"I Harold Charlus James Potter do swear on my magic that no harm will come to Hermione Jean Granger she is safe among these people. Lumos." Harry vowed then cast a spell the woman relaxed some.
"I don't feel as weak as I was and I'm a little hungry." Harry replied stunned by the display of emotion he had just seen on the tall blonde face.
"Your initial statement to the Aurors was that you had kidnapped and kept Miss Granger to and I'm quoteing here 'Have a pretty curly haird sex toy to use harder'. Can you tell the court what your relationship is to Miss Granger?" Her lawyer asked.
"Perseus! My Favorite Big Brother." Hermione cried into his shirt calling him her name for him, Percy cried with her shaking with emotion.
Thank you
" I'm helping because I want to Help you Harry so just let me all you need to worry about is eating, sleeping and bathing understood." Draco's voice was soft, concerned and caring, something that Harry hadn't heard since before the war. It was foreign to 20 year old Harry almost as foreign as it was to eleven year old Harry. The man before him wasn't the boy he once loathed nor the once scared young man forced to take the dark mark he didn't know the Draco he was letting help him. He turned and unbuttoned his pants letting them and his underwear pool at his bony ankles. With Draco's help he stepped out of his clothing and into the beautiful bathtub it was an old clawfooted thing of beauty.
"He has the most beautiful eyes doesn't he." Cissy laughed with joy.
"Relieved that it was one less thing to fret over, Ron's death helped me move on from my hate. But that makes me feel guilty, Marcus has to carry the guilt over Ron's death because of me. And that makes me hate myself for feeling relieved." Hermione admitted.
"As much as we would love to come in to have Tea Garrick I'm afraid we are only here to get Harry a new wand." Draco said with a polite tip of his head .
"I see, Well then I owe you Thanks It will make having to testify much easier to have you and Mrs. Malfoy with me." Hermione replied, making a valiant effort of a smile to the Dark haired man, He did not speak further but made a courtly bow to her instead.
"Exactly and how was that for your Father or you growing up for that matter. You have already taken steps to change that cycle Hermione. You have only to confront your attitude to sharing feelings with others. I think this is the perfect opportunity for you to take that last step in breaking from your past. I know a lot of our talk has been about what kind of mother yours was, and to see her acting like a true mother to your should be, little sister hurt you greatly. I know you have worked to be a better person than your Mother was." Gloria wrote in the book as she spoke.
"Good we now have the Weasley's as Allies in seeing her better, Septimus Weasley wants to make a formal alliance." Draco said, pleased.
"No more of this Mrs. Malfoy nonsense, It's Cissy!" The blond Matriarch insisted leveling Hermione with a soft motherly look. Hermione blinked at the woman but nodded softly.
"Yes Thank you Sue I would like to see Kings but insist on Marcus staying with me." Hermione replied.
"So you chose to give your parents to a child who needed them over returning them to you." Draco summed.
"Yes the more eyes we have on the Manor the better, you still have many who would like to see the Malfoy family sink." Marcus stated.
"How's the water?" Draco asked, his voice still soft handing Harry a lavender smelling bar of soap.
"Bitch is my toy my little Sex slave to hit and fuck as I like." Ron replied
"Yeah Mione, It took me talking to him about my experiences during the war and after for him to break his whole mask, He's the mother hen he should be He cried when he heard about you." Harry said softly only for the man himself to walk in and finish Harry's thought.
"Very well Lord Flint as the 'Victim's' sponsor naturally the job to fight falls to you, do you object to the challenge?" The Chief Warlock turned to Marcus.
Harry flung himself into Draco's arms kissing him with a happy squeal.
Hermione noticed a small change the next morning Marcus was not standing outside her room the next morning after Draco had let them know about the Marriage law. It made Hermione mourn the small bit of security she had come to expect from the large man, but logic dictated that it was because of the revelation he would have to marry as well as she. He would have to stop his vigil sooner or later and had chosen sooner.
As he sat in the perfect temperature water he let out a content sigh it felt amazing to actually be warm and safe. What an odd feeling safe in the home of Draco Malfoy, his ex arch-enemy but something told him he was safe even depleted as he was he could still tell things like this. Draco's magic swirled around him like a balm calming and strong reaching into him and slowly helping his own magic reserves renew.
"Alright I must trust you then, You know far more about law then I do. I'll see you in a few days." Percy sighed getting to his feet walking out of the room the large double doors behind him.
"Promise is a promise Mione." Harry pouted.
"His size is quite intimidating especially for a girl as small as you. You have nothing to fear from Marcus he would never hurt a witch physically, you see his father was quite abusive to his Mother. He doesn't hold with rape and Abuse and trust me the thing's he has heard here are enough to make him hunt down Weasley himself.I will swear on my magic if you need me to." Narcissia smiled softly.
"You let all the boys touch you including Marcus it just takes time, if the man you are paired with by the charm then he will understand you need time to heal and perhaps maybe we can approach them about it once we know who." Fleur reached out her hand attempting to sooth Hermione.
"Well how is she?" Draco asked.
"Yes!" Harry cried.
Narcissia watched her sister feelings conflicted she had done what she could to right her sisters mistakes and her sister was not taking it well. Hopefully her sister would come around for now she would enjoy seeing her new son with his godson she had a new boy to spoil. Nothing Made Narsissia happier than watching her boys smile they were everything to her.
"Perhaps Harry blocked the beating out himself that could explain it. The mind is a complex thing capable of defending itself in ways we will never understand." Draco said offhandedly Susan nodded and fell silent.
"So there is a Law about to be put into play next week. A marriage law which will pair all available Witches and Wizards together, But the Ministry is placing one small allotment and will allow all engaged couples to marry." Draco sighed.
His witch had feelings for him, and returned his affection. This is not something he expected ever.
"With Bill and Marcus on the grounds they are setting the last of the permanent wards. Soon the Manor will have wards that make Hogwarts ward look cheap." The matron smiled Hermione's shoulders eased to hear that.
" From what Ginny said Molly pushed her to date me to try and get me to marry her so she could have my money. I didn't want to assume nor push our relationship against the rest of your family mainly your mother. It's was better to never have you make any choice then to be hurt when you chose your family." Harry smiled bitterly wanting nothing more then to step behind Draco and hide but he was a Gryffindor and felt George deserved the truth.
"I think only Draco and Harry should go. It will send a better message. And tell them about the babies making a statement with your concern for their safety should they attempt to break into Manor." Narcissa stated.
He was a quiet man who said only what he meant, He had kept his word to her sticking to her calming her with his presence. Hermione was sick of her world throwing shit in her face. She curled her knees to her chest and sat hiding among the old furniture.
"So Beautiful." He breathed and enjoyed her cheeks flushing at his words.
"I don't know I would not let the healer try." Hermione replied.
"You're mistaken he can't care for me."Hermione shook her head.
"Either Practicing Law or Department of Magical Creature, I wanted to move the Wizarding world into the 21st century, I'd kill to have a telly." Hermione smiled at the other woman.
"Wonderful! Hermione I think you should start with how you felt." Gloria prompted Hermione sat her cup down and fiddled with her fingers, taking a deep breath she pulled her head up to look at Marcus.
"I know this is hard for you Hermione, you have been through a lot the past three years but try to become a person again. You may be surprised to learn that there are still good people in the world. You will come to know that no one will ever cause you Harm in this house ever again." Cissy smiled tightly at her.
"I believe we have an accord dear daughter." Cissy beamed.
"I...I.. would ... love.. to stay... but I want to ... help around here..." Harry Potter broke down sobbing trying to speak between his tears. Lavender smelling perfume surrounded his small shoulders as soft arms enveloped him in a sweet loving motherly embrace.
"I know Big Brother, We have to play the Hand we have been dealt But I refuse to take the chances with my Family's lives. I will not be a fool like Lucius was." Draco smiled.
"Actually I already know all about it Sirius gave it to me in my 4th year to wow my date with, then later before he passed gave me the recipe to make on my own but war and being captive you know... I would love to have my hair in the lovely curls again." Hermione smiled when the older witch laughed.
"I.. It's so wonderful that you would not only take me in but the baby as well." Harry sobbed from Draco's shoulder.
"Arry! UP Arry Up!" The small boy insisted blond hair turning red in anger. Harry stepped closer slowly eyes not leaving the little boy who was his last link to the only family he ever had. His hands slowly reached for the baby feeling Andromeda loosening her grip on the boy Harry pulled him to his shoulder full on crying to have the boy . Harry's crying shook the elder witch she watched as Harry rocked the boy hugging him tight and finally falling to knees when his legs could no longer hold him up. It was then that Andromeda Tonk's nee Black heart broke she had caused this boy's pain this boys grief ,so bound up in herself she thought nothing beyond her and her grandson. She watched Her sisters son Draco scoop Harry and Teddy from the ground and settle them in a chair gently, she looked at the tall Malfoy blond young man with Black Facial features a beautiful mix of the two . This wasn't the snobby little boy she had seen twice not the brooding teen broken by his father's allegiance to a bad man. She was in awe of the tender way Draco had taken the small dark haired boys hand and whispered to him trying to soothe him.
"Alright fine yes I have feelings for Hermione but she is not ready for a relationship." Marcus crossed his arms over his chest.
"Has Gloria not told you it's ok to let others in has she not encouraged you to speak about what's going on in that massive brain of yours?" Harry prompted.
"I'll talk to Marcus, perhaps convince him to act on his feelings for once." Draco sighed walking through the door.
"Your killing yourself Po.. Harry." His voice was stunned, unsure why he had called him by his given name.
"Obliviate, His memory was altered by Dumbledore this new memory retrieval Pensive shows us what the Obliviate covers up, its odd it didn't show the memory of the beating he received before nor of Dumbledore showing up." Susan explained.
"Mother is indeed correct Harry you are not going anywhere Malfoy Manor is as much your home as it is ours. Please consider staying with us. I insist upon it after all the Malfoy family owes its current freedom thanks to you. I would be rotting in Azkaban had you not stepped in and told them I did not take the mark willing. We owe you everything so allow us to share what we have now since we would not have it now if not for you." Draco softly said his heart twitched painfully at the news they were related, not that it was much of a surprise considering how few pure blood’s there are.
"Morning Harry Potter and Lord Malfoy to see Susan Bones ." The short brunette looked up at Draco smiled and giggled in perhaps what she thought a seductive way
"He was already free new wizard law all house elves that want to be free are given wages and vacation time, Granger started it before she left I haven't heard anything about her in awhile. I prefer it this way. I don't have to do laundry. It's quite nice, but you can get a bonded elf to do laundry. You just have to order all the loopholes out of it." The blonde man laughed "stay here I'll draw a bath." He walked across the room to an open door and Harry heard water running the elf popped back in the room and set some clothing for him on the end of the bed and without speaking left the same way. Draco appeared a moment later and was slowly pulling him to his feet and towards the bathroom.
Harry was in heaven Draco watched fondly as the toddler babbled away arms waving excitedly bouncing away on Harry's lap. Draco ran a hand through the babes' hair smiling at the site but he had work to do, turning away from his family he walked back to the floo. He stepped out of the fireplace and onto the marble floor of Gringotts, Draco walked up to the teller closest to him.
"I loved the twins; they could always make me smile, they frequently would comfort me when Ron would insult me and belittle me. I became quite close to them whenever I needed a good laugh. I would get sandwiched between them literally. I couldn't not go to his funeral." Hermione replied.
"I'll look into it you should still hold the Potter Manor it's a bloodline inherited and cannot be sold ever only Potter's can own it much like Malfoy manor." Draco smiled softly
" I will never be able to ever make up for the wrong I have done to you Harry you would be well within your rights to file a custody claim against me for Teddy as his godfather you are entitled to visitation I kept you from ever seeing him. The court would probably give you full custody for my treachery. My sister is correct my daughter would be so hacked off of at me proper, Remus would be disgustedly critical and shame me eloquently. My Ted would also not be happy with me for turning you away he always felt you got dealt a bad hand . Sirius loved you so much Harry no one could keep you apart when you were just a baby you prefer him to your own dad and James Potter was so jealous of him for having such a claim over your love. Your Mum would even help Sirius Rattle your dad's cage over it . Such good kind people and I treat their son like my enemy. I was so afraid you'd either take Teddy away from me I would never see him again or you'd reject the boy. I had no idea you blew your money on PI's ."
"Kings?" Hermione asked.
"I never thought I could like another man after what Ron did but yes. He is quiet and sweet. Honestly I would not be put together without his constant reassurance." Hermione sighed.
"I….I would love to be with you Marcus but there could be someone better out there for you than me, I'm broken Marcus I may never be whole." Hermione said sadly.
"Charlie is right Harry we love you, your more of a brother to me then Ron ever was you understood me when Freddie died you kept me together." George reached out and pulled the small from of Harry Potter into a large hug tears shed all was forgiven these Weasley's had their little brother back.
"Oh sorry I was lost in thought, yes lets get going. Would you take Altair my flooing is dangerous for me and I don't want him to get hurt." Harry smiled softly a small tilt of his lips that fell away quickly.
" Galwan." a familiar pop sound and a high pitched voice.
"FIne but I do so under duress and I request that I can scream as loud as I want." Hermione smiled.
"Of course Whatever she needs Madam." Marcus said without hesitation.
"I shall oversee this personally trust me when I say that Mr .Potter is our most esteemed patron and will be treated as such. I also suggest waiting until tomorrow to visit the ministry. Let us approach the DMLE first and then hammer them. Also take Mr. Potter with you and his presence will ensure you are listened to. There are two things left by Mr. Potter's Father James that I ask you to deliver to Him personally along with his family Ring . He will need to come claim both potter and Black Lordship so the lines do not die out." Ragnok said sliding over an envelope and a ring box.
"I too am touched and proud to call you my brother Draco, Just like when we were boy's I will always guard your Weak spot." Marcus smiled back.
"Only if Hermione is comfortable allowing me to Apparate with her alone If not we will join you." Marcus insisted on narrowing his eyes at Narcissa.
Footsteps caught his attention and he looked up and spotted Hermione walking up to him with a smile on her face. He liked seeing her smile, it brightened up her face and made her even more Beautiful. She stopped in front of his seated form looking at him and he gave her a small smile. This seemed to spurn her on and she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him. He was stunned for a moment but responded by setting his hands on her hips and Drawing her closer to him. And tasting her sweet lips for the first time had his heart racing. She settled herself on his lap drawing herself closer to him.
"Later Harry let us eat then we will talk this over." Draco rounded the table and pulled Harry to him for a brief hug before taking his seat next to Harry. Hermione rounded to her spot Marcus stood pulling her chair back for her as he did every meal. She attempted to give him a smile in thanks but failed as her thoughts moved to the damn law. Draco had said they would figure something out she had to trust. She picked at her meal as the rest dug in, Only Narcissa saw the dark eyes that watched the girl.
"It's ok out of the Weasley's the only one's who want to hurt me are Molly, Ginny, and Ron. They only ever wanted my money I never wanted to put the rest in the dog house by maintaining contact with them. If I know George he'll keep our visit to himself and maybe give us a bit of a discount." Harry gave a small smile. Draco nodded stepping out leading the way to the bright outlandish storefront Harry smiled fondly up at the store his favorite pranksters had built their dream Harry was so proud to have given them their start up coin. Harry didn't hesitate he almost rushed in pushing Altair inside. The colors were overpowering almost sickeningly so paired with the movement of charmed toys that littered the first floor. Stuffed animals waving roaring or growling per species. Harry laughed at a stuffed snake slithering around hissing angry.
"Right I promised you a day that I would take you to all the places you never got to do in the muggle world. I promised to take you to see a movie at the cinema, when I got back from Australia. I promised to take you to Thorpe park, I can't believe I forgot, we were gonna take George get him out of his funk after Fred bugger." Hermione groaned taking a bite of her food.
"I do not call one hand holding occasion and a single kiss a Relationship, We were never together formally. We shared a single kiss during the Battle of Hogwarts; it was in the moment rush of Death feeling. After Ron was caught up in Fred's funeral. We never talked about us being together, I left two weeks after all the funerals for Australia. We never once went on a Date He acted like our moment in the battle was nothing and our relationship did not change from us being friends. I assumed he regretted it and wanted no part in a relationship with me so I left to go find my parents." Hermione stated.
"Right the rest of you are Pureblood and have never read Shakespear. He is the most famous muggle writer, Perdita is one of the main Characters in My mother's favorite play, 'The Winter's Tale' They always wanted to name their daughter for a character from the play, Hermione is the male lead’s Mother the Queen of Sicily." Hermione sighed.
"Both." Hermione said, confused.
"Harry you're money is no good here the next generation Marauder pup is welcome to whatever his heart desires." George said pointing to the green tail dangling from the side of Altair's stroller. This caused Draco to bust up laughing, Harry chuckled to hear such a deep unreserved laugh come from the tall blond. They followed the Weasley's up to the top floor flat Altair and his dangling snake bobbed gently under Draco's control. Charlie wiped them up a simple filling lunch as Harry recounted everything that he had went through with Ron, and Ginny and the part their mother played in playing the-boy-who-lived. He told them about living on the streets working and stealing food when their was no work. Finding Altair , crashing into Draco, and their recovery at the Malfoy's hands. The redhead's were shocked further when Draco picked up and fed a hungry Baby who still had one hand wrapped around a green stuffed snake.
"Well dear I wont keep the two of you I just had to see you with my own eyes, you are skin and bone sweetness eat more get better and come to me for a job when you are ready." Kingsley smiled tenderly at the girl.
"That's why Harry doesn't like the dark." Draco softly said his heart breaking as they watched the woman lock Harry inside and storm away into the kitchen. From there the memory sped up it settled to a few hours later where they watched a large fat man pull the boy Harry out of the cupboard by his hair and savagely beat the boy with his belt screaming obscenity at the boy the whole time. From that memory they bounced to one almost a year later this time the appearance of Dumbledore telling Harry's Aunt exactly how much more they needed to beat and harass the boy the more money he would send, then as if the memory was changed to that of Dumbledor never having seen the boy bleeding on the floor. Draco looked at Susan confused.
Harry led her past the room she had woke up in a few days ago and to the Family portion of the house and into a large room all done up in her favorite periwinkle blue tones this was her dream bedroom.
"Filthy Orphan Freak we take you in out of the goodness of our hearts, feed you, give you clothing, put a roof over your head , and you scare the living daylights out of my son you smear your unnaturalness over my house! You should have died with your filthy Mother and Father instead you burden yourself on your normal hardworking relatives . Wait until your Uncle gets home, your punishment tonight will not be easy on you, I promises you boy! Get to your cupboard now and wait for your punishment." the woman screamed and let the boy flee to a small cupboard under the stairwell.
"Then that is what we will Do little brother We will protect our Family, I will die before anyone touches one of ours." Marcus promised.
"Harry, what is the matter? Do you not like the idea?" Draco finally asked
"Hello Dear how are you feeling?" Narcissia asked softly as Altiar was gurgling to himself, Nearing one the baby was a bit behind developmentally the adults did their level best to help the babe but time was what he needed most, Much like the young woman.
"It's okay Draco you don't have to keep explaining I think I understand and for my part I wasn't much better. I was envious of you too. You had parents who doted on you , you had Severus, you had love, something I never had once my parents died. My relatives never wanted me; they never let me forget how much they hated me. I had Sirius and Remus for so little time then they both were taken from me. After them Albus wanted me only for his own reasons he wanted me to be a weapon against Tom . And for his attention I played his game I was such a pathetic little wanker. I could not get away. Severus tried to keep me out but even he couldn't do much in the end. I never even go to thank him for everything out of everyone he never treated me like I was special." Harry gave a slight smile thinking of the dark man who sheltered him in his own way.
"At fucking last, I knew you liked Marcus he is just the kind of even keeled person you need." Harry grinned.
"You are such a loser dad Mom raised me to be better then you Me and Ginny were her last chance at normal children who did as she wanted. I did it because I deserved better then you were ever able to give me. I have it all now a famous name connections within the ministry a good job I'm making good money I have a pureblood witch to go home to and use at my pleasure. I even have a little mudblood treat tied up in another house to use harder whenever I want." Ron almost purred.
"That I could do at some point but for now I'm healing and want a better head space. When I feel like I am prepared I will approach my current Head of House and the rest of my family and ask for their support." Hermione insisted.
"Yes I have found some things Harry. " Draco sighed paused. " It's as we feared looks like Dumbles has done more than we thought, It's bad Harry." Draco rubbed his eyes.
"You don't mind do you dear? Its a rather personal matter." Cissy pleaded slightly to the young Witch.
"Were you aware Dumbledore was stealing from his Gringotts account?" Susan continued
"Yep didn't want a fucking mudblood as a wife nah cunt was only good for my toy and my pureblood wife does not quite share my more perverse tastes in sex, needed a toy to take out my aggressions on. Bet the little bitch misses my cock." Ron bragged.
"Help me, you're letting me bathe and having your house elf cook food for me I haven't had so much nice happen to me in a long long time." His voice once again gave out slowly.
"I can stay Mi if you want." Percy clutched at her hands desperate to be with her.
"What does it matter Harry so I like Marcus so fucking what. I don't mean to do anything about it. I'm a broken woman having any kind of normal relationship is not in the cards for me, this law may do some good and Pair Marcus with his perfect match. Any feelings will go the way of the dinosaur, I will be joined with whoever is chosen for me. That is all Harry nothing more." Hermione sighed.
"Where did you see yourself headed career wise when in Hogwarts?" Gloria asked.
"And after that your presence always looking after me made me feel twice the guilt, After everything you have done for me I am so blessed to have you looking after me all this time when I'm sure you have much better things to do then trail after an emotionally unstable witch." Hermione finished picking herself up from the floor and looking up at Marcus once more as she finished.
By Rita Skeeter
" You make it sound like you are jealous of him?" Harry's tears had subsided but lingered on his cheeks Draco raised his hand and brushed them away absently.
"Then why not see if he would be receptive to marrying you like Draco and Harry." Fleur asked.
" Hmmm it seems that Mr. Potter's legacy was kept from him, He even believed that his trust Vault was everything he had and used it and what he initially inherited from Mr. Black to fund a search for his godson and the rest to his Alma mater . I assume you have come to the same conclusion I have Mr. Malfoy that is why you have come to straighten out Accounts? " The Bank Manager sighed after reading through the papers.
"If I didn't know better I'd say I died and woke up among the angels. It's lovely to see you again Mrs. Malfoy." He lay in her care, green eyes meeting blue.
With no more interruptions and little fanfare Marcus lead them to the designated point and Apperated Hermione directly to the Malfoy Manor Entryway Where Draco awaited them.
Draco walked back to the atrium and back toward the floo he threw the powder and whisked himself home he found Harry and Teddy in the playroom giggling and laughing together. Floating stuffed dragons that once belonged to Draco , leaning on the door jam just content to watch the interaction. Draco let the Malfoy Sion mask slip off his person as he watched the play. He had been hard wired since birth to never show the outside world his true self like his father before him and his grandfather before that. He wanted better for the boys for every child he wanted to be a better parent then his own Father had been.
"Go Draco I'll look after the boy's it'll give me a chance to smother poor Harry with a little Mothering goodness knows the boy needs it." She grinned laying the now fed calm baby back down. Draco gave his Mother a rare smile and left the room elegantly gliding out.
"What does her name have to do with it?" Cissy asked.
Marcus stood from his seat, leveled a cold look at Ron but addressed the Court.
Dinner was placed on the table by the elves Hermione smiled when the others around the table thanked them for the meal. Hermione enthusiastically thanked the elf who served her, her favorite roast duck mushroom risotto and asparagus.
"You save us twice in war now save again. I feel you are safe." Tilting her head to the side she addressed Draco who nodded and slowly reached to take her hand then slowly pull her into his arms to carry her. Draco raced through the house Arthur and Harry following close Susan barked out that they would continue their interviews tomorrow morning . Draco didn't waste a second once Harry and Arthur joined him in the patio courtyard He nodded to Harry to go with Arthur.
Leaving Gorge in the Lab Draco ran to his study quick to jot a quick owl to Marcus. Draco hoped Marcus would answer his SOS Marcus was always underestimated in school, His looks and silent Nature made many think he was stupid or part Troll, no it was the ultimate Slytherin move while strings of Voldermort resurfacing. Be unassuming passed his Owl's and Newts within the top 10 percent, exam results are never made public and only used for Ministry and Employment. Marcus remained off Voldermort's radar by being stupid among his peers.
"I know I had to learn in training." Ron bragged.
"Good, And the Minister?" Draco raised an eyebrow.
Andromeda stumbled over her words not making much sense even to herself. " I hope that you won't act out of revenge and take Teddy from me, I ... I'm going to leave Teddy here with you for a few days to get our old home in livable condition for us and when I'm done I hope you'll let me take him home, under the understanding that from now on he will live in both homes I hope you will agree to every other week and Holidays can be spent together or apart as you feel ." Andromeda looked at the boy holding her grandson seeing the tender arm of her nephew around the smaller boy's shaking shoulders offering whispered words too soft for her ears. Feeling that she could leave her grandson in the Malfoy house and not fear for him left her feeling contentment and sadness all at once. Her grandson looked up from the snuggled shoulder of his godfather and as if her knew what she was thinking.
"Portus." The world spun round faster then possible with only a quick twirl Harry met the courtyard of Sirius's childhood home. Draco pulled him up before Harry could even register where he was. The others ready wands in hand Harry reluctantly drew his own but held himself behind Draco.
"Thank you but at this point why should I bother with that? I'm going to be shunted off to what amounts to the highest bidder, Because you can't tell me that the ministry is not corrupt. My quote Soulmate unquote is going to be the person who can give the ministry will get the most money from. I'd bet McLaggen or Vicktor, and I will go back to being a sex slave to one of them." Hermione shuddered.
"Are you alright?" He asked Hermione As Cissy was greeted on the other side by a Lord.
"Now straight to it unfortunately we are here to discuss something rather unsettling to say the least, I have already spoken to Headmistress McGonagall and The executor of Alubus Dumbledore's estate. They are willing to testify and help get this sorted out. I have statements from Gringotts and the Bank Manager Ragnok they have held a complete account audit since the death Of Charlus Potter your grandfather Harry and they have found sufficient cause to lay charges on Alubus Dumbledore for theft . The statement Headmistress McGonagall also provides enough evidence of blatant neglect of all child placement and welfare protocol. Now we want to go through your memories of your childhood and Hogwarts years to gauge the extent of damage done to you being left in the care of your mothers muggle sister and husband . This is gonna be difficult for you Harry but you deserve justice to see exactly what Dumbledore has done from your point of view. Now I need you to think from your earliest memory up until you Visiting Gringotts Can you do this Harry?" Susan asked Harry softly and smiled at him.
Sue knocked on the Door to Kingsley's office a low 'enter' could be heard from within the office, Sue led them into the warmly decorated office. The Tall Wizard was dressed in royal blue robes, a lovely contrast to his skin, He was seated writing on a parchment He glanced up to see Marcus escorting Hermione into the office. Jumping to his feat Kingsley gave a great big smile at the slight girl entering his office.
"That is a shame but let's see how we can remedy that. You know the drill Harry." Garrick pulled his long wand out of his sleeve and directed the tape measure it snapped up and started to measure Harry Much to Altair's delight he clapped and laughed as it wound around Harry's head.
"And having a Black name doesn't come without a bit of scorn and ridicule, and you mother, do not have a star name you were named after a god." Draco rolled his eyes.
" They are his he is the next generation and must hear all about them. And he must come spend time with his Uncle's George and Charlie." Charlie smiled watching Harry tear up they spent the next little bit getting to know the man who had saved their little brother and new Nephew. Draco let these men grill him with good nature proving to both he was changed, he showed his devotion to Harry and Altair by taking charge of the baby and allowing Harry time to get to know his big brother's once more.
"I hope your plan works Harry, We goaded her into a lot today. How will Marcus respond?" Gloria asked.
"Wonderful I'll see you Dear's at home." Cissy waved cheerily all but running from the room.
In all truth life at Malfoy manor had become normal easy and filled Harry for the first time in forever. Harry got information and answers to things he did not even know where issues, Draco had found out exactly what Dumbledore had done to him. As his Magical guardian Dumbledore had used his power to shunt Harry to the Dursleys to be molded as a malleable little pawn to die for Dumbledore. He used Harry's money to keep the Dursley's under his thumb, along with Molly, Ron, and Ginny. Thankfully due to the laws Dumbledore was only able to pull a few thousand Galleons. Draco quickly reclaimed the money from Dumbledore's estate, Aberforth disgusted by his brother had willingly turned over the Galleon's. Minerva in a blind rage sold all of the former Headmaster's things and turned the money into Draco 'it wont replace his childhood but let it be used to make his life better.' She had even said 'I have banished his portrait from the office Severus' is in its place'.
A month passed in the Malfoy house the two refugees flourished under the care, love , and attention the Malfoy's heaped upon them. The little baby they discovered was one of the rare magical children born to the Muggle realm; they had to rethink their original plan for the poor baby. They were now looking for a wizarding family to take the boy. When Harry was strong enough (i.e bored with staying in bed) he started helping Cissy take care of the baby much to Draco's ire; he preferred Harry to continue to rest and get healthy. It surprised the Malfoy's at how quickly Harry got better. Harry just smiled at them shrugging and simply saying, "I have always healed quickly." Harry quickly learned to love Malfoy manor and the people who gave him a home he wanted to do more to help keep the enormous house to his surprise the Malfoy's weren't the ones stopping him the house elves wouldn't let him do anything.
"If he did not care why would he follow you around,"Fleur tisked.
"Teddy!" Harry breathed blinking at the tot in an older Andromeda Tonks' arms.
"You….. you want me?" Hermione stuttered attempting to pull herself from Marcus.
"Unfortunately Yes at the trial you will be expected to tell the Wiz everything. I have asked that Mother and Marcus accompany you. If Harry or I could it would be us but We must sit on our family seats for an open trial of a pureblood." Draco sighed Hermione blinked at Draco for a moment then looked towards Marcus as if putting two and two together.
Stepping into the old dusty store it looked exactly as it had when Harry was eleven the nostalgia of it brought a small smile to his face. Movement from the back of the store revealed the old hunched form of Garrick Olivander.
"You should rest more, I'll get you something light to eat." He looked up to the male speaker, pale blonde hair and silver eyes greeted him, Draco Malfoy was his savior, his handsome face was drawn in concern.
Harry followed Draco through the halls of the Ministry fluttering and turning at every sound , he hated the Ministry it held too much pain for him he trailed close to Draco not wanting to be left alone. Draco was conscious of the conflict going on in Harry. He didn't want Harry facing the Ministry alone; he had made arrangements so he could be present and for the interview to take place by someone who Harry would be comfortable with.
"For someone so smart you can sure be stupid Hermione, Such hipocracy for a woman who loves Romance novels you sure do love to protest love. You deserve love as much if not more than me." Harry grinned at her, Her face became flushed in embarrassment. "Yes I know about your love of Romance novels."
"Other than a little bread a couple weeks ago, last month." Voice horse from disuse he hadn't spoken allowed in months since he'd done some manual work with a nice older Muggle couple who'd given him some money and a hearty meal with leftovers to go.
"Glad to see you Awake Hermione, I wish this was a social call instead of a business one. Has Lord Malfoy explained what we wish for the trial." Susan Bones had walked into the sitting room and gave Hermione a soft smile.
"It's an old law dating back to the times of King Arthur and the knights of the round table. If a man is accused of having his way with a woman without her consent, he could either admit his guilt or call for a trial by combat. Over the centuries it has fallen out of practice and apparently is still legal so it seems. As for why Marcus is doing it because he can and will kill Ronald Weasley, While barbaric to use swords it appears as if our esteemed MW wants to set an example of Ron. Don't Fret for Marcus dear He like Draco has trained with swords since childhood, there is no way Weasley is a match for our Marcus." Cissy held Hermione's Hand patting it gently.
"We should have warned you at the possibility we never thought he would go that far, Come let's get you back to the Manor you could use a lay down." He replied softly offering her his hand, She allowed him to take it and tucked it in his elbow.
Draco
"You know I don't think it's wise to ever get on that girls bad side." Harry cocked his head watching her shut them in.
"The back garden would work the best for a portkey we should go now." Harry pleaded with Susan. She looked thoughtful for a moment looking at Harry and then Draco before nodding.
"He has just explained that Marcus and Cissy will be escorting me." Hermione returned as Percy ushered her to the sofa again.
Draco strode down the hall and back into the nursery where his mother was shushing a crying infant. She smiled at her son who looked so distracted since the day he brought home the small child she held and the Harry Potter the savior of the Wizarding world.
"I kissed you." Hermione replied, still looking at the ring in the box.
Draco remained silent hand curled around a blushing Harry's, content to have a small part touching Harry he didn't move , He wouldn't push the younger man any farther he'd wait and let him heal. He would court Harry properly.
"I will send a Patronus to Draco if you wish to see your friend." Marcus nodded to Her.
Marcus,
Hermione sat a little at loss without the tot, she sat for a moment watching Narcisia take Teddy up.
Hermione shuddered and sobbed but gave a great deep inhale of breath then forced her red face to look up at Sue.
"Glad I caught you Hermione, The Minister wishes to have a quick word with you before you go." Sue smiled.
"I knew she would never tell you out right, I know from Draco you feel the same so let me say this. Pull your head out of your ass and tell my sister how you feel before you lose any chance at her for good." With that Harry turned and followed Hermione from the room leaving Marcus to think over what he just heard.
"Kings!" Hermione beamed pulling her hand softly from Marcus' arm and stepped tentatively in the Ministers Hug. Blinking back tears she saw a streak of silver fly by her and away. Marcus' Patronus.
"Too bad the weather will be turning to Fall soon and all the flowers will be gone." Fleur smiled.
"NOW I want to make it clear the Malfoy Family has in no way shape or form held me against my will! In fact they saved my life, I am so sick of the wizarding world bullshit ignoring me until you think I am doing something wrong or something you don't like. 6 months ago I was on the verge of starving to death where the hell were all of you then? Where were you when Albus Dumbledore left me on the front step of my Aunt And Uncle's Muggle house the night my parents died? Who made sure my Muggle relatives were ABUSING me? Where was the outcry when my Aunt hit me with a frying pan? Where was the Wizarding world when Albus Dumbledore left me alone in the muggle world without protection, my only guard a Squib? WHO in the Wizarding world actually gave a shit about me as a person? Where was the Wizarding World when Albus Dumbledore used my family money to PAY Molly, Ron, And Ginny Prewitt to make sure I was isolated and had no one but them? NO ONE Until Draco Malfoy found me dyeing on the streets! Draco who nursed me back to health who allowed me to share his Mother love and give me a place to call home! My place is Malfoy Manor! My home is with Draco Malfoy, with My God-son And adopted Son, with the only mother I have ever known Love from! With my Sister who suffered at the Hands of Ron Prewitt! I want to make my self crystal fucking clear! Leave me and my Family the fuck alone and If I ever, ever see the Wizarding Britain try to breach into Malfoy Manor I will leave Britain for good! If I ever see any article in the paper about anyone in my family that paints them in a light I do not like I will sue each and every person Starting with the queen bitch liar herself Rita Skeeter! WHO not only is an Illegal Animagus but has spread lies about every single good person I have ever known! If Wizarding Britain wants someone to place blame for my poor attitude towards it, place it on Rita Skeeter, Albus Dumbledore, Molly,Ron,and Ginny Prewitt, Not the people who actually care about me. If you make a move against me and mine I will remind everyone of just who killed Voldermort!" Harry ran full on, letting years of pent up anger and rage at the world finally out.
"Well aren't you sweet Harry and please call me Cissy, it's lovely to see you again you've been asleep for a few days now Draco's been in a right fit fretting and worrying about you but it's good to see you look stronger than you did when you first came." She smiled sweetly carding her fingers into dark hair.
"We need to go to Weasley Wizarding Wheeze they have the best wizard toys, George and Charlie have been making them for a year and they are far superior to anything else on the market." Draco frowned at hurting Harry.
"Would you like to open a dialogue with him?" Gloria asked.
"Now I didn't say that. What I'm saying is if the poor mite is going to end up a Black name he should either carry the Black surname or the Malfoy name." Draco smirked at the shocked jaw dropped face Harry was giving him.
Draco asked Marcus here when she arrived hurt and bringing trouble he had not anticipated. 'Marcus is to be your escort to the trial' 'Marcus' father was abusive to his mother' Marcus was her bodyguard, a pureblood member of the 28 that could stand for her when the trial started and she needed protection. A wave of slight guilt over her apprehension of the man hit her, just as Cissy pulled her from her thoughts with a pile of dresses in her arms that was thrown on the bed.
"Take each one and feel which fits better." Olivander directed Harry nodded and started with the pretty Cedar wood it felt warm under his fingers but it felt dull, he let it go it floated with the rest he looked and the stark white wood and felt repelled from it turning to the last he curled his hand around the wood and felt a light caress it felt warm and safe like the manor. He grinned up at Garrick Olivander who clapped pleased.
"Heavenly I always loved baths." He sighed lathering the soap Draco had given him and dragging it over himself the dirt and grime washing away . He soaked his hair using the bar to get the worst of the dirt and sweat out pulling the drain he stood and let Draco turn the shower on he stood getting all soap off of him. He let Draco turn off the spray and wrap a large fluffy red towel around him and help him out of the bath. Draco helped him out of the bathroom and into the clothing the elf had gotten. Draco had to shrink them a little to fit his much smaller frame but they smelled delightful and were soft on Harry's skin and even after being shrunk were a little big on him nothing like Dudley's hand-me-downs, besides these were Draco's top of the line muggle brand clothing nothing dirty and torn here. Hugging Draco's clothing to him he was content for the first time in a very long time.
"My Memory is sufficient. Draco trust me that he will not see the light of day ever again. I have a special cell in Azkaban just for him." Susan gave the group a smile worthy of Salazar Slytherin himself before she turned and left the house.
"Yes, she'll protect him I trust her." Harry replied with complete honesty after Narcissia had saved him from Voldermort during the last battle his respect for the Malfoy Matron was astounding after the war he had defended both her actions and Draco's during the war and wouldn' t hear a bad word about either Malfoy that was when he started having problems with his supposed best friend, Ron wouldn't hear a good word about them he refused to see the Malfoy's in any good light.
"And When Lord Flint killed Ron so publicly?" Gloria nodded pleased.
"Yes I made a choice to give them up before we hunted the bits of Voldemort's soul. I could not tear another family apart the way I tore mine, She was so beautiful. They were all so happy and carefree playing on the beach I could not take that away from Perdita." Hermione smiled sadly.
"Right I will owl the Minister at once and arrange to see him tomorrow as it's late now." Draco nodded happily, they had a plan. But worried about what the world had in store for them now.
"Ah finally Harry you look much better how are you feeling?" Draco asked softly.
"Well dear it's time for the boys to go to sleep I'll take Teddy up." Cissy smiled standing gathering the Toddler from Hermione.
"Draco had a meeting with the Minister yesterday and we are all a bit distracted." Hermione said absently.
Harry taking pity on Hermione on the third day helped her down the stairs and into the sitting room where Altiar played on the floor. Narcissia smiled at the duo welcoming them.
"Amelia and Susan yes I remember Poor Susan losing the last member of her family to Voldermort ." Harry shook less at hearing Susan's name he even looked a little happy to see the young blond. Draco led Harry Into the DLME to a small receptionist desk and addressed the female sitting writing in appointments.
"Draco you don't have to do this." He said softly trying and failing to not feel small compared to the blond.
"Right Harry this is more then enough to bring assault and attempted murder Chargers along with line theft due to your lack of educational on your family about your responsibilitys. Now we can Handle this one of two ways." Susan paused before beginning again.
"Does that bother you, him following you around?" Gloria prompted.
"Welcome back young Draco Hazel paired with a rare Dragon heart string 20 inches the longest wand I have sold in years a defenders wand , I see you found young Harry and the wee bairn , come you are welcome here." The old man smiled, eyes misty.
"No it is not your fault the man is dead, and that he used me and my family money in such a way. I have closure from Ron's involvement. Ginny and Molly will be tried, that is all the law can do. I'm not angry Draco, I just want to move on." Harry had smiled, turning back to Altair who was rolling around on the floor.
"No actually I quite like knowing that if I turn around he's right there before the war and Ron it definitely would have." Hermione sighed.
'Wait what about those of us like me, Harry, and Hermione?" Charlie asked.
"Harry I..." Arthur started to say when he was cut off by Harry.
She pulled back this time breaking the kiss this time and looked into Marcus' eyes; they were set and pierced her heart with it's soft pleading.
"Just finish Please I wish to lay down." Hermione breathed out her face resuming the even calm appearance.
It was Fleur though who found her an hour later the beautiful French woman sat on the ottoman that sat near Hermione's spot.
"All he ever said was I belonged to him and he took me as his right."Hermione shook her head.
"Yes he was, I miss him so much. My memories of him and Harry and Remus and my family were everything to me; they kept me sane, my time as Ron's captive gave me a greater appreciation for what that man went through in Azkaban." Hermione said sadly.
" I'm not leaving you Harry that's final." Draco stood and held his hand out to Harry who gave a watery smile. They followed Susan into another room. She directed them to a large mirror like glass and a large plush sofa. There was also a table with a full tray of foods and a pitcher of juice.
"You are safe, Hermione Lord Malfoy has insisted on extra security measures around the Manor. Hush, it's ok please I just have a few more things I need to ask." Sue tried to sooth the sobbing witch.
"You're staying here Harry, sit, don't move, I'll go start you a bath, you need one." He stated firmly then called.
"This press conference is now closed, I think it's past time we let our Savior do what he wishes. He has bloody well earned that at the very least!" Kingsley shook his head motioning Draco and Harry to his office to use his floo.
"Considering the Hat wanted me in Slytherin and I convinced it to put me in Gryffindor. I'd say I'm more of a Slytherin then I let everyone think." Harry grinned and disappeared laughing madly the whole way. Gloria took that as her cue to Floo back to her office shaking her head the whole way intent on billing Lord Malfoy extra headache.
"That's different. I know the Weasleys, Draco, Harry, and Marcus are all safe. I'm safe here! But I may regress back in my progress once I move out." Hermione said sadly as the other witch held her hand.
"I mean the idea does have appeal, I have been going rather nuts over the man's shoulders. I'm still rather afraid of the intimacy portion of Sex Marcus is a gentle man and would give me a memorable experience, But on the other hand the only experience I have is being Raped, and romance novels." Hermione stated blandly as if Gloria's statement had stunned her into answering.
"Indeed dear Mother." Hermione replied as they entered the dining Hall. Harry and Draco were sitting around the table smiling and laughing, Teddy Lupin sat in a fancy high chair chewing on a Banana that lay cut up on the tray.
"Good, Take care of you first. Lord Flint please tell Lord Malfoy that this office is always open to ANY discussions." Kingsley nodded at Marcus.
"I'm glad I never threw out my clothes from when I was your age they will be put to good use now, I also have a few brand new under things here from the shop that I have yet to wear, come dear one we will have you bathed and smelling of your choice of bath salts in no time and we must simply get your hair under control you my dear are about to learn the old Black family secret Hair formula." Cissy smirked, Hermione grinned back.
From one of the Anti-chambers an assortment of Swords were brought forth as the challenger they were Offered to Ron First, He chose an english style Short sword. Marcus took his time selecting his weapon choosing a long sword of a style Hermione could not place; it looked old but well taken care of. The men walked to the center of the room they bowed and squared off, Marcus stood towering over Ron, a point that seems to make Ron nervous normally a good judge of strategy Ron could out play the best at chess, But his ambition to always win sent him charging Marcus like an Idiot.
"Of course I do the stupid swot turned me down wouldn't willingly give me what I wanted so I took it as is my right as a pureblood I can have whatever servant's I deem fit. Have myself a pretty bushy haired sex toy." Ron laughed a monotone cruel sound.
"It doesn't matter anymore Draco I gave up living a long time ago I was sure I was gonna die during the war I made my peace with it. I'm ready for it and wish everyday it would come quicker, I want to see my family. They are waiting for me. I have nothing tying me to this world. Andromeda took my godson and left the country and refused any owls I sent. I used a lot of my inheritance looking for them and when I say a lot I mean most of it, but he is safe and loved. I want to hug my Mum, Dad, Sirius, Remus, Fred, and Hell. I even want to hug Severus. Then ask Him, Dad, Sirius, Remus to help me get even with Dumbledore. I'm so tired Draco." He rambled his words and had no filter. Draco steered Harry back to the soft bed and forced Him to sit.
"It's perfect. I love it so much! Thank you."Hermione smiled lightly.
Marcus followed the Squib into the room locking it with a complex charm and sitting across from Hermione in the other chair.
"Was easy enough to trick her slipped a power restraint on her when she returned I met her under the guise of needing her help with Harry I swear that swot loved him would do anything for him even let her guard down when told he was in danger. To easy to put her somewhere safe stupid Potter didn't even know who bought his god-fathers house from him I made sure of it. " Ron laughed again
"Th..Thank you Draco I don't know how I can ever repay you and Mrs. Malfoy." Harry stutterd staring at the Malfoy's blue and grey eyes filled with care and concern over him.
"I will speak to Minerva once we get her safely to the manor I will go to Hogwarts myself and arrange everything with Mungo's. Harry ?" Susan insisted Harry was reluctant but knew he had to get Hermione out of here. So he started talking to her starting with the day they met to the war, taking steps every so often until he was only a arms reach he sat down in front of her, Harry's voice seemed to calm the shaking figure. He slid Daco's cloak to the small form careful to do it slowly so she could see every action. Hermione pulled it to cover her form.
"Indeed my dear cousin loved to laugh, I recall several of their pranks, half the stuff those boys would do was such advanced magic." Cissy smiled fondly.
Hermione smiled for a moment before slipping out of the room, She heard the door open behind her and knew Marcus was following her; she took off down the hall before he could see her. She ran as fast and as quietly as her legs could. She found her way into what used to be the dungeon but had been turned into a storage room she hid herself best she could among the things hoping no one would think to look for her here, the problem was Marcus was amazing at finding her and they had grown closer since her admission to him over the had opened up to her about his own mother and her death at his father's hands; he had been brought up by his Grandfather who mostly ignored him and shuttled him off to Malfoy Manor most summers.
"The floor is yours Lord." CW nodded at the elderly man.
"Susan why were we allowed to keep our wands and preform magic in the Ministry ?" He asked as they passed the check in desk.
Andromeda had never been so hurt in all her life she had deluded herself into thinking that Harry being of age just barely wouldn't want to raise a baby, wouldn't want Teddy would shun and turn away from the tot at the first turn. She fled with him after the war not sticking around to see the aftermath of the destruction she had caused. She saw the slight boy face pale and blink owlishly at Cissy before training green eyes to her . Everything her sister said was reflected in those eyes the years of pain in those eyes chilled her to the bone they spoke pages of torment of hate and bile this young boy suffered.
Hermione pulled herself up to look into the older witches eyes a bit stunned that the other witch would go so far. Hermione shuddered, shaking her head as the soft blue eyes held a softer look than a moment before.
"She is settled in her Room for the night, She may not come for dinner but you are still expected. I just refreshed the alarms just in case, well fought today dear." Narcissa smiled at the stoic man.
"Thank you Lord Weasley you are as generous and kind as your Nephew has said in the past." Hermione smiled at the man and gave him a deep curtsy happy to no longer Face the body on the floor.
Hermione smiled at the departing witch Hermione joined her at the door once again finding A large imposing wizard standing at the door. He turned and bowed again allowing the women to step ahead of him.
*No ssteping on me Pleasse.* It hissed weaving through the isles.
"We can discuss that after the press conference I insist that it be done under Vertiserum and very publicly draw the crowd away from our Home!" Hermione stood angry at the bull shit being thrown at her family now. Draco jumped and rushed to the Floo to make a call to the Minister.
"Right I forgot after our trip to the past I forgot to tell you. Harry from the time your Father and Mother passed Dumbledore paid what I assume to be a bribe to the Weasleys every year. That is to say the payments went Directly to Molly , Ronald, And Ginevera Weasley, In the amount of 5,000 Galleons each. From all records they were the only Weasley's to receive such a payoff. It also appeared Dumbledore attempted to bind you into a Marriage Contract With Ginevra Fortunately for you He attempted this after the Triwiz you legally became an adult when your name came from the goblet of fire. Therefore you had to willingly be a part of the contract to make it binding. Now I suggest we do this the Slytherin way if you are game?" Susan smiled at Harry.
"Now Harry dear if you don't stop calling me I'm afraid i will become quite deaf until you call me Cissy or at worst Narsissia if calling me Cissy makes you uncomfortable after all we are family if only through poor dear Sirius, and your grandmother my great aunt Dorea. Not a close connection but close enough for me." Narcissia huffed trying to appear affronted but failing and smiling softly at the dark haired young man who had saved them.
"Mione…Mione!" Harry yelled to get her attention. Hermione startled as Harry touched her shoulder she almost screamed. Harry held his hands up showing her his palms.
"I don't know I was unconscious at the time. All I know is I woke up and it was gone and Madam Pomfrey was fussing over me." Hermione shook her head.
When they finally left WWW they left with more bags then they knew what to do with both Weasley's seemed please with the booty they had sent with their new family member especially after hearing his story. They had also informed Harry that he wasn't broke he was well off not Potter/Black fortune well off but enough to buy his own place if needed with more coming in daily as he was part owner in the shop three way split between George, Charlie, and him. Draco told him that they should set up a account for Altair. Once the legal adoption went through they would blood adopt the boy .Which allowed Altair to heal more. They met with the goblins got access to the Vault George had been putting Harry's profits in and on Draco's Advice invested most of it in businesses both magical and muggle. Draco knew most were a sure profit and would only see small dips.
"I think I have fallen For him." Hermione sighed.
^ To Prongslet the one who bound these three hero's together forever who
"Leaky cauldron!" He shouted shielding his burden from the onslaught on whirling fireplace's Harry had his head tucked into Draco's shoulder eye's shut. They flashed past grate after grate until the Leaky cauldron flashed brighter Draco bent his knees to take the landing his passengers barely felt a thing as he stepped out he set his bundle down gently.
"Yes little bitch was always whining." Ron wasn't phased by the question.
"Draco?" Harry reached out touching Draco's cheek lightly with his finger tips Draco blinked at him stormy grey leaching away. Draco smiled curling his fingers around Harry's and squeezing them lightly.
"Brilliant they must have used some form of translation spell to get it to actually talk Parsletounge." Harry laughed walking towards the small sine that stated THE MARAUDERS SPECIAL. Under it Harry found a small dedication.
"They were all three accomplished Wizards But Remus was the brain behind the pranks but Sirius and Dad were unregistered Anamagi they learned by their 5th year." Harry laughed, winking at Hermione. At this point Altair started crying Draco stood from his spot on the sofa next to Harry scooped the baby up and took him away.
"Yes Draco I have it under control you do what you need to do. Come on Mr .Weasley Draco knows what he's doing the floo is here let's get the boys like he asks." Harry pulled Arthur away as Draco disappeared into the bedroom. Draco slammed the door open rushing the poor girl into the room setting her as gently as he could ,
Harry sniffled at the thought and care that went into each animal the large proud stag bending down to touch noses with the small baby stag. The Grimm almost as tall as the stag wagging his tail at the people peering at him. The grey wolf almost as big as the Grimm dog huddled behind the Grimm. Draco put a hand on Harry's shoulder the hear a gasp from beside them. They turned to the noise and found the opened mouthed form of George Weasley his handsome face marred by the loss of his ear and the bigger loss of his twin.
"It is decided everyone on the floor please clear the arena." The Chief Warlock ordered.
Marcus was a bit stunned by the sudden hug from Hermione, he was not raised in an affectionate home. But Hermione was very warm and open with her feelings if it was important to her to show her feelings then he would do whatever it took for her to feel comfortable. Hermione sobbed harder when one firm hand lay softly  on her shoulders keeping her to the shoulder she let her guilt out on…..
Hermione made her way to the sitting room where she had her sessions with Gloria. She settled herself into her spot and waited for the Dr to Floo in.
Draco stepped up next to Harry wrapped an arm around his shoulder gave them his best Lucius Malfoy Glare And growled.
" This must be Harry's Aunt's house super Muggle no trace of anything magical that I can see." Susan commented and watched the memory play out .
"I think we have hear enough Ronald you are hereby disowned from the Weasley Family hence forth you are dead to me, you and that woman you married are thrown out." Arthur growled out his magic licking around .
"He is not under the Impirus!" Kingsley yelled to the crowd and waved Susan forward who held the potion in her hand. Handing it to Harry she gave him a weak smile and nodded in encouragement. Downing the whole potion Harry turned to face the assembled masses again.
"Muggleborn Are you saying you have something to do with the kidnapping of a Muggleborn." Susan asked trying to push Arthur out of the interview room but paused at the information.
"You gave a child less fortunate than yourself the greatest gift, love." Cissy said warmly.
"Cut the Bull Marcus it's me. You can be honest with me." Draco snapped.
Minister for Magic
" Draco saved my life I would be dead right now if not for him. As for what after I spent all of my money to rebuild Hogwarts and try and locate Teddy Ginny no longer wanted anything to do with me she told me point blank that all she wanted was my money. And where honestly after i lost everything I started walking and never stopped really." Harry fidgeted with the stroller handle.
"Yes it is beautiful." Hermione murmured.
"Draco do you think we should get some robes for Altair?" Harry asked glancing up at the blond .
"Hello love." Hermione smiled sadly at the boy allowing Harry to pull her around the table and sit her between him and Marcus.
"But we were suppose to be shopping for toy's for the baby." Harry tried to protest weakly.
Ron's truth was the hardest thing to hear for Harry the poisonous words dropping from his ex Best-Friend's mouth.
"Would you allow me to sort out your hair Hermione? He'll grab at it first chance if it's not out of the way." Narcissia asked softly.
The duo returned over 2 hours later than expected and joined the rest for lunch, Harry shot out of his chair as they entered the dining room.
"I do appreciate your need to identify me by my proper title, but I have asked you to call me by my given name more than once. And you are distracted normally, you are the first to greet me." Gloria stated sitting pulling out her notepad.
"Sore still but the walk helped, Where is Draco?" Hermione replied, voice still gruff from disuse, as she settled on the sofa.
"Yes you will be taken from him he must be heartbroken." Fleur smiled.
Kingsley Shacklebolt
"Hi luv I'm gonna reach for my wand so I can make you a oath ok?" Harry said slowly He waited as her eyes processed him in front of her finally she gave a small firm nod. He smiled and pulled his new wand from the holder.
"So you willfully held a muggleborn witch as a sex toy because you wanted to?" The question was almost said absantly.
"No It's better for me to not know what happened. She needs to be comfortable around me as she heals. She would not if I knew the extent of it, Tell me what potion's she needs and that's all I will begin brewing at once with George." Draco firmly said the women nodded seemingly pleased with him. The healer pulled a quill from nowhere and started to jot down a list on a piece of parchment she had pulled also out of nowhere. She handed him a list of potions that gave a little away but not the full extent he nodded knowing what he had to do.
Harry blinked and then Susan and Draco appeared from the depths of the silvery substance they landed and resumed sitting at the table . Susan ran a hand over her face Drawing a long breath before looking at Harry with teary eyes. Harry shifted uncomfortably in Susan's Knowing gaze Harry tried to get Draco to look at him But hardened grey eyes stared at the Pensive as if it had personally insulted Him.
"Trying not to freak out, I don't want to lose my head." Hermione admitted.
"Did he ever share that he was married a year ago?" Sue prompted.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"You are in no way responsible for anything that happened! You did not force me into serving as your public pureblood backer! You did not force me into a farce of justice by calling for Trial By combat! You did not ask me to kill to free you from that monster! No one can force a Flint to do anything! I chose to do every single thing you are feeling guilty over, I wanted to help you Hermione since the moment Draco and Narcissa approached me I wanted to help you. I wanted to show you that not all pure-bloods are like that, not all pure-bloods would take advantage of a sweet caring woman, I wanted to show you. That you are safe and give you the justice you deserved." Marcus said, pressing a courtly kiss to her hand before adding. "It is my honor to be there when you are afraid and to sooth you by just being there, so long as you want me there."
"Well since I am to not be close with the Weasley's Bill as Heir should be as surprised by my testimony along with Draco and Harry best to have them look as shocked the baby most certainly must go he young but I will not speak of the things HE did in front of them. As my escorts Marcus and Cissy should stay so they are not caught off guard by anything I say." Hermione nodded to Sue understanding what she meant. Wizard law was not made to protect young muggle born girls, it was made to protect purebloods.
"Lay back the infant is safe as are you, you're suffering from both magical and physical exhaustion, you're also on the verge of starvation, also a serious case of malnutrition , when was the last time you had anything to eat?" A soft deep voice asked gently the speaker a Wizard by the Magical exhaustion comment.
"Yes well we must all do better for little Teddy, you must see him change his hair oh and he has the most lovely eyes."Cissy smiled tucking the last curl out of Hermione's face.
His handsome eagle Owl took off Draco sighed, taking one small moment then turning from the room and left.
"Our Girl will not rest." Narcissa smiled sweetly.
"You like him?" Fleur asked, pleased.
"Couldn't be around the family any more today, I'm ecstatic for Harry but I'm sad for me, I refuse to marry Charlie which is probably the first thing he will try, I could never be happy with him we'd drive the other batty within days. I'm sad because I wont get to have what you have. I will be paired with someone I don't know. I'm still suffering from PTSD, And now I'm expected to get married and have children without even having the minimum of healing. I don't even know if I'll ever be able to have a man touch me let alone sex." Hermione sighed.
"No my parents died when I was little, my godfather at 15, my other godfather at 17, after I lost everything a few years back my best friend stopped talking to me haven't heard anything from him nor his family I don't blame them I'm responsible for most of the pain their family has suffered. My other best friend disappeared after we left school to look for her family. I have not seen or heard from her in 3 years. I have no one not that, That bothers me I'm use to relying on myself I was doing ok by myself but then I found the kid in a drug house strung up on a really bad muggle substance and couldn't leave the poor thing there knew he was better off at a orphanage then there. His Mother just let it lay in a soiled nappy and day with very little food." He answered shrugging, trying to sit up a little slower. He managed to rub a bony hand to his face.
"Thank you for joining us Lord Flint, Hermione here was just talking to me about the Trial and wished to say some things to you about it if you are willing." Gloria smiled.
"How's the child Mother? Any lasting damage?" Draco asked she smiled at her son's changed personality it had never been more pronounced then at that moment,
He woke feeling a soft bed under him, soft sheets. He was warm for the first time in a few years. His first thought was the baby he sat up eyes wide searching but his head swam and he groaned.
"No no more tear come let us go up to the flat and get some lunch and you can fill us in on the details." George said setting Harry back on his feet and waving his wand at the door to the shop closing the door locking it and flipping the sine all in one smooth flick. Harry looked up at a slightly smirking Draco who nodded charming Altair's stroller to float gently.
"Thank you sir your kind words give me such pride. Draco would be more than receptive to a truce he wishes to recreate the Dark image long held by his family name." Hermione replied quickly before the man turned away and returned to his seat.
"Well Draco asked for Marcus to come live at the Manor as Harry is still healing himself neither of you should wield a wand fully until you are well enough. With you here now and a baby full time Draco basically all but adopted Marcus into the family for another wand to protect us. Marcus is a powerful Wizard that many underestimate due to his quiet personality. Marcus came because he was asked by a friend, he takes honor and trust very seriously, and personally I think he was lonely and needed a family." Cissy explained.
"I do not know if I will ever be ready to be around so many people, I want to do something to help people. I may help Draco with his wolfs bane alternative cure project. Severus left behind a legacy that I wish to see fulfilled even if it's giving Draco majority credit for the brewing." Hermione laughed.
"Hush dear one Marcus has excused himself from the room and will stand at the door and hex whoever tries to disturb us. You are safe, sweet girl no one in this house will ever harm you in that way." Narcissa Malfoy said softly, tenderly bringing a hand down her back.
Hermione looked to Harry before giving him a wicked Grin.
"You will also have to floo with someone normally I'd let Harry but he's still in recovery himself . Will you allow myself or Arthur to carry you in the floo?" Draco gently asked Hermione.
"Ah I see Draco owled me about the Marriage Law worried you may shut down I think that may not be inaccurate. I understand that this has brought up a lot of pain for you in particular. " Gloria smiled softly.
"I will find Hermione perhaps she will talk to a woman and see if she is receptive to Marcus' feelings." Fleur stood with a look to her husband to look after their child.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`
"Well the trial is over Ronald Weasley has been found guilty by this court and his punishment was Death, as for restitution for the Lady Miss Granger is allowed what remains in his Vault should you wish it." The CW looked at Hermione with a soft look as if glad Ron fell.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`
"He is just a nice man who is worried something will happen to me, I admit I enjoy his company. He is sweet and thoughtful. I am quite sad he will not be around me much longer." Hermione said.
"Yes I acquired the taste you know I spent time in France with my grandparents, Who were very proud of their nationality.
"Good Hermione thats perfect, Did he hurt you during the repeated rape?" Sue squeezed Hermioen's hands again.
"Then that is all that we can ask for, come lets take you into a bathroom and get you cleaned up a hot bath and a fresh dress. For now you are welcome to any of my clothes as you need until you are well enough to be escorted to the shops." Cissy said generously standing Helping Hermione to her feet and to the double doors. Cissy opened them and showed Hermione the large wide Back of Marcus Flint his wand at the ready. Hermione blinked as his wand disappeared up his sleeve and he stepped out of the way bowing to her and Cissy as they walked out.
"There is no need for such fromality's Mr. Weasley. As you have taken care of a member of the house of Black since he entered our world it is we who owe you. I am ashamed of the animosity long held between our two families. As long as she Remains tied to this house I will defend and protect her." Draco nodded firmly. Harry smiled happily at him with a big wide grin.
Draco landed in the entryway just as his mother was walking down the stairs.
"No Kings It was my Fault I trusted him and turned my back, you kept them looking for me even when everyone else gave up on me. You will never understand what that means to me." Hermione sniffled pulling from Kingsley's arms she dabbed her eyes with Marcus' Handkerchief she still held.
"Leave it to my Cousin to adopt the lone girl with frizzy hair, He was a dear man." Cissy said softly.
"Harry, First of all I never hated you, Hell I was so ecstatic to meet you I disregarded my Father's words to stay away from you. When we met on the train I truthfully wanted to be your friend but seeing you with witless Ron Weasealy I was so hurt by you standing up for him and refusing me. Granted I was a right prick about it but I being raised like I was by Father my ego was pretty astounding. And I was a kid. How do kids handle rejection? We lash out like you did with Uncle Sev. As for being better than you, that utter bull shite, you were so famous you stood against evil, stood up to my own Father with such conviction I was awed by your bravery. I wanted to be like you. I never wanted to fight for him but that's exactly what father raised me for the slaughter. " Draco paused looking for words.
"Of course she is family Malfoy's take care of their own but she needs someone she trusts as a healer can we get Madam Pomfrey sent from Hogwarts until Hermione is well enough I fear in her state she wont allow anyone but her." Draco unclasped his cloak and handed it to Harry.
"Hmm I have been thinking there have not been any interested people adopting him, most wizards even now fear little muggle born children afraid of what they might become after they found out about Voldemort not that I blame them but he should not have to suffer for it." Draco mused Harry tilted his head at the man .
Draco and Harry planned their ceremony for December 1st securing their date with Kingsley himself. Marcus Conned Hermione Into Marrying him the Next week after the announcement. During the Chaos of that week Malfoy Manor remind unchanged a refuge for the Family as the Wizarding world Imploded in anger and Hate.
"Harry, you saved the boy first if anyone has the right to give him a name, it's you." Draco gave him a soft smile. Harry blushed a light pink dusting his cheeks. Draco took pride in that color; it meant that Harry was healthy, or at least getting healthy.
"Thank you. He will be paid handsomely for his time I insist. Susan I'll write when Hermione is well enough to make a statement, Will our memories be enough to convict Ron?" Draco smiled at the elder Weasley who rushed back to the floo.
"I never had take out Mione and always wanted to remember." Harry smiled at his friend who frowned.
"To say the least Marcus, give her today back off your normal following her around like a dog. Let her see how it is without you for one day, hopefully she'll come to you. Your ambition to see her safe is admirable but she needs to sort out her feelings. Go read we both know you want to." Draco Smiled. Marcus nodded and lumberd away from Draco a bit forlorn without the sweet witch to protect.
"How am I feeling so much better?" He asked curiously, his body wasn't as heavy nor as tired.
they wanted their only granddaughter to know where they came from. Besides you can't do Chinese take out without crispy duck." Hermione smiled.
"There is no honor in my actions today. He was woefully uneducated on the ways of the sword. I am only glad it gave her some relief." Marcus stated shortly.
"I don't see why not." Hermione found herself saying it was time to move forward and learn to trust new(ish) people.
"Fuck You are right I need, no I deserve to have a bit of a treat before this fucking sideshow!" Hermione jumped up and tore out of the room. Leaving a grinning Gloria behind Harry popped his head into the room giving the woman a devious smirk, which was returned primly as she stowed away her book.
"Mione." The elder Wizard held open his arms hoping the girl would hug him.
"It's a wonder, this is the most sneaky devious underhanded way to push your friend into Marcus' arms. You positive you were not a Slytherin?" Gloria asked half laughing.
"I will try for Harry and the Baby, that is all that I can give at the moment." Hemione said honestly.
"Come Harry Draco good to see you both welcome please follow me to the pensive room we will conduct our meeting there we will not be interrupted." Susan led them through the department into a large room with a table and comfortable seating. A file sat in front of one of the Chairs, Susan took this seat and motioned the men to sit with her.
'Long ago were once three brothers, happy sweet little boy's who loved to laugh; they grew up wild and carefree among the halls of their beloved castle, they grew up to be the most handsome of men loyal,brave,smart,and wily. Mooney the youngest brother had a secret that he never wanted to tell ever. In their wanderings he had been cursed by a very bad man every full moon he was forced to turn into a werewolf, it was painful and lonely. Mooney did his best to keep it from his brothers from this, but he failed his brothers had found out and confronted Mooney. Now mooney was heartbroken by this and ran away from his brothers he hid in shame sure they would reject and hate him. The middle brother Padfoot was the best at tracking and had found Mooney's hiding spot inside an old shack. The elder brothers loved the younger so deeply when they heard about the curse they practiced old magic and found themselves animal shapes. For Werewolves only pursue human prey and not animals, the Eldest brother begged the youngest to trust them. Mooney was moved to tears at his brother's love and affection for him, As animals they joined the youngest running on all four legs every full moon. They lived out their days playing among the forest and glens far from the walks of man until time stood still; they remain there to this day running in the moonlight.'
"Trial by Combat why... Why would Marcus fight him like that?" Hermione gasped over the last few days she had come to rely on the quiet Man's solid presence.
"Glad your ok little one soon you'll have a happy home to go to you'll be loved and cherished the way a child should be." Making his voice as soft as he could despite the gruff quality of disuse it would get better as he got more use to it. He watched the baby breathe slowly in and out it was slightly hypnotic he hadn't realized but he'd started to doze off leaning into the baby cot until he felt himself being lifted and settled into a chest a warm large insanely comfortable chest. Draco was carrying him, bridal style as if he weighed absolutely nothing he probably didn't he mused Draco could probably lift him even when he was a healthy weight. Draco carried him out of the room.
"Please my Hair has a mind of it's own perhaps you could tame it." Hermione hesitated a moment looking at the other woman. Hermione had to trust this house and everyone in it after all this is where Harry chose to have a home, She trusted Harry. Narcissa rose and walked around behind the girl slowly raising her wand detangling the matted strands and arranging them artfully in a long braid. Pleased the Malfoy Matriarch resumed her knitting, smiling at the girl holding her grand baby as if he were all that was holding her together. Hermione just stared at the boy and tentatively gave him a small kiss to his sweet head.
"Then I raised a fool for son to test and enraged Flint, Trust me no one will bother us Marcus would die before anyone entered this room." Cissy laughed a bit.

"A bit Stunned at the trial by combat, but she seemed almost happy he was gone. Her posture changed when he went down. I think it was relieving for her to be rid of him completely." Marcus replied, tucking the piece of cloth into his pocket.
"Well lets get shopping I think we should do muggle London for the baby's necessity's but its up to you." Draco smiled as green eyes looked up at him Altair held tight.
"I need to get over myself eh?" Marcus sighed.
^ To Moony quiet teacher and scholar who died for a society because it was
"He was the one who reported you Missing Hermione you did not show up for your appointment with him the next day he insisted it was not like you, that is when he approached Ron who now appears to have lied to the Minister of Magic." Sue patted Her hand.
"May I have him step in?" Gloria asked. Hermione looked up from her cup to the older Woman before nodding. Gloria jumped up from her spot on the chair rushing to the door and speaking softly to Marcus who stood outside the door.
"Of course Lord Malfoy I'll just go get her." The girl tittered but was interrupted by the arrival of Susan herself.
"Boy's say hello to our new guests" She smiled as the woman turned to face the boy's in her arms, a happy three year old boy with multi colored hair that turned the stark Malfoy white then jet black all in a span of a few seconds. Harry blinked at the boy whose hair turned back to Malfoy blond.
"That is why I suggest only Harry and Draco go, and to be extra safe we get the Weasley boys here. Hermione love why don't you and Marcus go and make the calls to them and ask them to come stay for a little while until the hubbub dies down." Narcissa nodded to Hermione who dashed out of the room followed by Marcus.
"I have been bugging this lot for days to come see you and take care of my little Mi." Percy was no longer dressed in the way he had in Hogwarts gone were the horned rimmed glasses, replaced with modern silver frames. He dressed in muggle jeans and tshirt. In Fact she blinked at all the men in the room, they were all dressed like muggles.
"I was raised to fix my problems myself. I was raised to be a strong independent woman. I was the one that looked after Ron and Harry especially during the hunt for the soul pieces, But after the three years in Ron's hell and finding my parents had moved on, It was actually quite nice to let someone else step in and care about my problems." Hermione admitted.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Article start~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Everything is just fine Harry just thinking we need to go shopping Altair will need some more things, you will also need your own things." Draco smiled enjoying the slightly panicked look on his face. Draco would enjoy this shopping trip.
"I think what hurts the most is that no matter how hard I fight and try no good comes from opposing it." Hermione sighed.
After the meal they retired to the favored sitting room, watching the three children on the floor.
"Yes I do you are exhausted you need more rest to get your strength back. Don't you worry about nothing I'll take care of the baby or rather Mother is taking care of him you know he's safe with her." Draco says, voice deeper than before with his ear pressed to Draco's chest.
Marcus' heart shattered at her flushed tear stained face, jerking his arm from the healer he stood crossing to the witch and kneeled in front of her tentatively taking her hand.
" They cant get away with this!" Narcissa jumped up, crossing to where Harry sat and held him.
"I think it's time to call in Kingsley for a favor and a press conference." Hermione glared at the paper Draco held in his hands. "It's time the Wizarding World knows how you found Harry." Hermione sat up straighter folding her hands over her lap.
The missing men entered the little sitting room stunned to see the girl holding the baby Bill took a few steps closer and knelt next to his little sister.
He had never been what you would call brave, sure he would fight if it came down to it but preferred to choose his battles. Such as killing Ron Weasly for Hermione he knew that's what needed to happen for her safety, Ron Weasley would have hounded her for the rest of her life.
Years of abuse neglect and pure hate Played out before them the only hint that it was not all the same day was that Harry aged got slightly taller not that he was allowed much in the way of sustenance. They watched beating after beating it was as if the poor boy never escaped the beatings As Harry got older they got smarter about placement and size. Draco wished he could say the beatings were the worst treatment Harry got but the amount of times Harry went to bed without food made homeless people look obese. On top of lack of food, lack of adequate bathroom privileges and basic grooming care paired with the daily belittling had Draco's Aunt Bellatrix look like a caring and wonderful person. Just when Draco couldn't stand any more Harry's Hogwarts letters started appearing and the fiasco that landed Harry a bedroom finally made him cringe. He also hated watching every single dangerous event to Happen to Harry at Hogwarts watching him meet Sirius and finally get the love of a parent 13 years after he should have broke every boundary still left on his heart . Watching Harry's lonely isolating Summer's the beatings Harry received lessened but the verbal and blatant neglect remained the Happier days were when his family would just ignore him. He had let himself believe for so long that Harry was nothing but loved and good and everything he had wanted to be as a boy. He never saw the person Harry actually was. Draco didn't deserve to breathe the same air as Harry hell he didn't deserve to even be on the same planet as Harry. The war memories and then the living on the street memories were by far the worst and then they came to rescuing Altair from the drug house and the filth that caked his wards previous home was just down right striking Harry had told him were he found the baby and the condition was far worse than Harry had ever let on. The last few memory's played Blacking out after running into Draco and then the Gringotts played out and then the magic pulled them from the Pensive.
"Yes he wants to see for himself how you are, he's been worried." Sue nodded and Hermione glanced at Marcus.
" I'm sure you will figure it out. I'm sure he's proud that you are trying to continue his work. I know for a fact Remus would be proud and grateful." Harry smiled perching once again on Draco's desk in front of him.
"Harry…" She gasped stepping into the cool colored room.
Marcus led Hermione out of the courtroom to the Lift line; they waited their turn and took it straight to the Atrium, leisurely walking to the Apparition point when The voice of Sue Bones called out Hermione's Name. The duo turned to see the slight DLME witch run up to them.
"Yes they were well when I found them." Hermione smiled sadly.
"Do you trust him with our Family?" Harry Asked.
"It's okay Dudders Momma will Handle the freak run along to your room sweetums." She shooed the boy who fled to the stairs out of his Mothers view near the top of the stairs he stopped and sat to watch his mother with a gleeful smile. The woman turned to the small shuddering mass and crooked her finger at him in a come here motion. The boy slowly got up from his position under the table and approached the thin woman visibly afraid of her . Once he got within arms reach she backhanded the boy he flew back nearly landing across the room. Susan gasped beside Draco, the girl was nearly in tears she whimpered with young Harry as the woman started screaming at the boy.
"As that is the last point I hereby close this session of the Wizzengammot." The CW smashed his gavel and people started to exit. Ron's body was cleared away with no ceremony Hermione blinked up at Marcus when he rejoined the stunned witch.
"Freeek! I'm gonna tell mum! Your a freeek. MUMMY HE DID IT AGAIN! " The blob of boy screeched and smiled in satisfaction and started cumming up with fake tears for effect. Thudding and a woman's voice floated down the stairs.
"We got you a healer sweetheart you were so close to dying when we brought you here, but Draco was able to get Madam Pomfrey between her and Draco they derived a potion plan that has been administered to you and you have been slowly getting better. You just need to get better little one for my poor son's sake he is driving himself into a early grave fretting and brewing all hours a day." She smiled softly humming when the door opened and a irate blond man practically stormed in the room but upon seeing Green eyes the man visibly relaxed.
"But I thought that formal pure-blood trials required all current heads of sacred 28 family be present, Macus would be on his family's seat how could he be expected to escort me and Mrs. Malfoy?" Hermione asked, confused. She was further stunned when Marcus spoke up for himself; it was the first she had ever heard him speak up since her second year of Hogwarts.
"I found them at the beach with a child, a girl so I went up posing as a tourist and asked them directions. Happy to help a fellow Brit, they told me all about the beautiful Child. Her Name was Perdita she was 6 would be 9 now. They adopted her shortly after moving from London, when they heard her name they said they knew she was the reason they moved and started the process for formal adoption." Hermione sniffed a bit.
She was in bad shape, Held for almost three years, she looked as emaciated as Harry had been when Draco had picked him and the babe up. Draco had to be quick with his spell work; he needed to know how badly she was hurt; the simple diagnostic standard healing charm would not tell him much.
"Good Thank you Hermione this is everything I need, I will not rest until he gets what He deserves." Sue said softly, removing Hermione's hands and standing. "Good day Lord Flint, Lady Malfoy." With that Sue left the sitting room Hermione was hyperventilating. Soft Hands brushed the stray curls that had come undone from the braid. Hermione's head was laid on a soft silk covered lap, only vaguely aware that the large double door closed again Hermione started slightly only to be pushed back down into the lap.
"You ... how... with Malfoy... What.. Where..?" George stammered blinking from Draco to Harry.
Until they reached the massive double doors of the master suit the smell hit them before they even opened the door it smelled of blood and pain and sex. Susan boldly flung the doors open, it was as if they had opened the door to a dungeon a large cage hung in the room the bed lay bare  blood lay dried on every surface. A small form was huddled in the far corner naked except one small blanket that barely covered her breast, Susan motioned them to stay until she spoke with the cowering form.
"Redwood a good choice for you dear boy. It means good things for you. Now core I think Phoenix feather will be too flighty for you I think either dragon heart string or unicorn tail core would suit you better." Another flick of his wand the woods flung away and stringy substances replaced the woods. The three silvery strands were obviously unicorn tail, as for the heart string one black , one deep bloody red, and one grey as storm clouds. The grey storm cloud colored heart string drew him to it was the color of Draco's eyes when he was deep in thought. Harry reached out for it and was overcome with the sound of a dragon Roaring in his ear. It was a fierce cry of a nesting mother defending her clutch, he knew that sound of chirping under the deep frightening roar was of hatch-lings. This was the one he knew in his heart he blinked to the old wizard who smiled softly as if enjoying a private joke.
"And I kissed back, Hermione I love you and I don't want to lose the one chance I have of happiness because I'm too stupid ask the woman I love to Marry me. Please do me the great honor of being My Wife?" Marcus asked patiently.
"Of course I was How else could he pay me to be around that wanker, Asshole was rich he didn't need that money too bad Ginny couldn't seal the deal and take what was left before he wasted it on a damn castle." Ron almost appeared jovial even under the serums effect.
Harry frowned but stood,  kissed Hermione on the forehead and left the Room, Bill passed Altair on to Draco as everyone else filed out of the room.
The sessions seemed to be doing Hermione good. She smiled more, took to walking in the Garden's, played with the boys more, she had even found the Library and spent hours reading. All with Marcus tailing her like a guard dog, A quiet Huge guard Dog Harry would muse to himself glad he did not have to hover over Hermione Himself. Weirdly enough she seemed to appreciate Marcus' presence, something she would not have normally enjoyed.
"I...I... Yes I think so that was just rather shocking is all I did not know Wizards had trial by combat." Hermione's Hands shook, wringing Marcus' handkerchief between them.
"I'm a fucking Pureblood I'm the Victim! The bitch is mine to fuck as I please! She is a lying bitch!" Ron raged, then added. "I demand my right to trial by combat."
"Did Ron ever say why he wanted you?" Sue asked
"Where Is Hermione!? She is currently the only missing muggleborn witch she never checked in with the ministry when she returned from Australia. How long have you had her in your clutches?" Susan demanded.
After a moment of tasting her sweet lips on his, He knew he could not live without them. He pulled away from her to look at her face, her eyes were dark with passion and her cheeks were flushed.
"He has feelings for her, am I the only one who's noticed?" Fleur asked.
"Do you miss him?" Hermione asked softly.
"Are you ready to go Harry?" He asked green eyes met his the surprise that flashed through the green orbs confused Draco.
Narcissia left Hermione's room and closed the Door behind her and saw Marcus walking down the Hall way towards the girls room.
"Why not?" Harry asked.
" The Marauder shelf is wonderful by the way. They would love it! I want Altair to have one of them all they will help tell their story's " Harry smiled.
"I do love a good bit of Telly myself, And now you no longer feel the drive to change the Wizarding world?" Gloria smiled softly.
"And by 'this' you mean?" Draco asked, helping him out of his dirty grimy ripped shirt.
"Lord Ragnok this is a surprise ." Draco sat down at the table the goblins looked at one another, they let their leader address the Malfoy Lord.
the right thing to do.
"Welcome home Mione, I'm just down the hall if you need me. Get some sleep." Harry backed out of the room, closing the door and leaving her to the blue room.
"Hard not to be without the dark wizards lurking about, but your observation is not wrong. I remodeled the whole manor after the war, Lucius said it would be good for me to do before they took him to Azkaban." Cissy said lightly.
"I didn't know you like Duck Mione." Harry looked slightly appalled by her choice.
It was quick and almost looked like Marcus had not even moved, Ron's sword clattered to the stone floor and the only indication of Marcus' quick powerful stroke was Ron's Body leaking blood from the large cut across his chest and the blood that dripped from the sword he held. Marcus Bowed to his fallen opponent a show of gallantry.
"Yes I can take you back to the Potter Manager I am Sharpfang this way Lord Malfoy." The Goblin ushered Draco through the halls deeper into the Bank, they paused in front of a large door Sharpfang knocked on the door. There was a muffled response from within as Sharpfang led him into a large room at the table sat two other goblins. Draco Bowed his head upon seeing the leader of the goblin nation sitting at the table.
"Who could we get Draco our Name still breeds contempt we are merely tolerated in the Wizarding world and only Because of our business holdings." His Mother shook her head thinking.
"Remus." She smiled tenderly drawing a single finger down the chubby cheek.
"Hush Hermione, your poor voice has been suppressed for years, you need healing and rest and recovery now speak smaller words for now. Would you like to come home with me? Before you answer you should know I am living with the Malfoy's they rescued me . Will you have a problem living there? You also have a baby nephew there with us Altair may cry will you have an issue with that?" Harry said softly and waited for her .
They didn't spend longer then necessary at the bank they happily ventured back to the alley and to Olivanders.
"Thank you Draco , let's go in the morning for now let's take Teddy and Altair outside and enjoy what's left of the sunshine." Harry looked up into Draco's silvery eyes
"Wonderful choice Harry Ukrainian Iron belly female a beautiful dragon she was a fierce and kind dragon , she was a oddity of dragons her and her mate they mated for life they raised their Hatch-lings together every clutch till the day they passed. Now give me a hour and your wand shall be ready" Garrick summoned the wood and core waving them out of his shop. When they were out of ear shot he started laughing . He had to write Minerva she'd simply cry Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy wands cores were a mated pair of dragons this was a oddity in the wizarding world it had a deep and blissful meaning . Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were soul mates in the deepest most meaningful way if that meant only as brothers or if that meant they were to be more, Garrick did not know. He'd simply enjoy watching them bumble around one another, he stood straighter and went to his back room he had a wand to put together and a letter to write…
"As a little girl I always wanted a vanity table just like this. I always loved antiqued things like vanity's and castles." Hermione smiled idly tracing the gold hand mirror.
"Draco are you alright?" Harry's voice tainted with worry pulled the blond out of his thoughts; he smiled at the man perched on his desk.
"Then go and guard my weak spots, weak spot." Draco laughed.
"He should have a Black name. I think it's only appropriate his rescuers are of the Black line." Cissy stated walking in the room having heard a brief snippet of the conversation.
"George, Charlie Thank you for coming on such short notice. She is with Madam Pomfrey right now. It's not good. I do not know the extent I ask that no one but the women know her full condition. I believe it will be better for her mental state once her physical condition is better." He rubbed a hand over his face exasperated.
You then left the country after?" Sue prompted.
"Bill." She gave the oldest Weasley sibling a soft smile.
"No not yet I'm sure she'll have some name's ready but you saved our lives so I thought you deserved first choice." Harry smiled at the surprised look flit over Draco's face.
Harry blinked at the older witch not sure what to say , his attention wavering to the tot reaching chubby arms out to him squealing .
Harry was nervous about leaving the security of Malfoy Manor, but was happy to be shopping for Altair he would ensure the baby get spoiled between him and Cissy the boy would be worse than Draco ever was and that thought made Harry beam with joy. Altair would have everything Harry lacked, he already had three doting parental figures who all loved the small baby, and now they were going to buy everything the kid would need. Harry was vibrating with anxiety waiting for Draco by the floo Altair cooing happily in his lap he bounced the tot on his knee he couldn't help but think of Teddy his sweet Godson worlds away from him Harry let a small tear run down his cheek. Cissy watched him from her chair she could almost see what he was thinking she vowed to have a chat with her sister immediately once the boy's were gone she would not let her child hurt any more. She was Dowager Malfoy she was a force of nature where her children were concerned even Bella backed down from her , she may be the youngest Black sister and the prettiest but she could be more calculating then Dromeda and crueler then Bella when provoked. And she was pissed that her sister had cut her new son from his godson's life. Draco walked in glancing at his seated family the sad countenance of Harry to the pure fury rolling off his mother.
"Doing great Fleur has been worrying over you , all of us have been worried. But her and Percy the most. She will want to come see you now that you are awake. Little Victorie Jean is super cute and looks just like her mum but got the Weasley blue eyes and can't wait to meet her Auntie Mione." Bill laughed pleased to see she still was her, thinking of others before herself.
"That is rather strange at the very least you should have at least 6 or 7 Potter properties and last I knew the Black's held 12 sounds fishy to me. I shall look into it Harry don't worry I figure out what happened. And now that I hold Proxy for you on everything I can take names and destroy those who have obviously kept you from everything that belongs to you. It may take me awhile but I will get to the bottom of this." Draco vowed.
"The little one is lucky Harry picked him up, I think any longer in the care of the people Harry found him in he'd not be alive, he was severely starved but Harry kept him slightly more nourished. Its slow but I'm getting the poor baby back on track. How is Harry?" Narcissia replied, wishing Harry wasn't going to clock out on her.
"While not commonly used, the practice of trial by combat is within his right. But you understand this is to the death with swords not magic?" The chief questioned.
"Of all selfish rotten things to say about that poor boy How could you Ronald you were taught better." Arthur's magic lashed out around him the older wizard barely maintaining control over his magic.
"I couldn't just leave him, he was so weak , and hungry, but look at him now he's so strong and so in tune with his magic I swear he floated his bottle to him the other morning." Harry started proudly smiling down at the boy. Draco laughed softly at a low deep grumble; it was a gruff sound that reminded Harry of Sirius's bark like laughter; it made Harry feel at home and safe.
"Also you are stripped of your Merlin first class and title of war hero, you are also relived of your Auror status as you have lied and kidnapped a muggleborn witch and held her against her will . You are under arrest pending further investigation into everything you will be held in Azkaban until trial. Take Him away!" Susan yelled and two Aurors Hauled Ron out of the room.
"No Marcus is still a bit of a stranger to me, He is a strong silent type of guy who doesn't speak often. In the three month's I have been here we have talked twice. He just follows me around the Manor quietly watching out for me." Hermione sipped her tea absently.
"Why wouldn't I help both of you?" Draco asked rubbing Harry's thin Back softly , his large hand careful and unsure, afraid to hurt the person he held very secret affections for.
"If I had to venture a guess it's about the laws Kings let slip to Marcus and I after Ron's trial." Hermione input.
"I would love that I…. I missed you all so much. I…My memories were the only thing I had left that belonged to me. Percy thought of me?" Hermione replied absently stunned Percy had mother henned her at Hogwarts in her first few years and they grew close but the war had taken him away.
"Oh Harry I will get you justice, You stay here and let Lord Malfoy protect you. Are you close to any of your old friends could they come help you take care of your growing household." Susan asked Draco.
Draco read the short missive aloud to the sitting room Full of Weasley's, and the whole of his family.
"Hmm you are right, Have you asked mother?" Draco asked eyes softening to a sleek silver color, Harry had noticed Draco's eyes changed color with his mood, when serious they turned grey hardening to a gunmetal color when mad, when he was happy or unencumbered by thought they shone silver like a star or even a Patronous Harry privately loved to see them light up he thought Draco was much to serious of a person.
"I understand He has a widow about to give birth to her child, I ask the court to see the money given to the woman he betrayed as much as he did me." Hermione recited the response Cissy had drilled into her blinking at the corpse. The One powerful stroke had almost cleaved Ron in Half she could see his ribcage and his bowels had fallen outside his body.
Harry tilted his head up to the second floor and locked eyes with Marcus and grinned.
"Tennessee Williams, I'm impressed Not many Wizards have read muggle literature. So tell me will you allow me my moment?" Hermione asked.
" That's the point of a RollerCoaster,I'm glad your home Mione, did you find your parents?" Harry said softly picking at his own plate.
Bill smiled back with a short nod as she left the room.
"I had no intention of pursuing Her." Marcus ran a hand through his hair.
"Why... why would he do that?" Hermione asked, trying to trust Cissy just a touch.
"No need Jill I am here please continue with your job and do stop tittering at every Lord that walks in the door." Susan said sharply, glaring at the young woman.
"Why would I kiss a woman I do not want?" Marcus said lightly, keeping her on his lap easily with one hand.
"May I hold him, I want to meet my little nephew properly." Hermione asked, pointing to Altair. Harry beamed at her, scooping the babe up and Helping Her hold the boy. Hermione blinked at the soft blue eyes that looked back at her, the soft cubby baby face grinned at her as if she were the best thing in the world.
" Good that means the potions we have had you are working, they will help start getting you to a healthy state. But the unfortunate thing is that you may have to be on several for the long term, at the moment I cannot say how long you'll have to be on them but I will personally brew each and every one as long as you need to be on them." Draco stated grey eyes as hard as steel as if waiting for a fight from Harry and why wouldn't he Harry's loathing of potions and healers in general was well known.
"Of course I was a part of it and I was to be awarded for it praised and placed as the hero who killed Voldermort while Harry would die running away. But stupid Dumbledore had to go and get himself cursed to death." Ron stated and was interrupted by his own father blasting into the room screaming at his son.
"Bye luv." Kingsley waved at them departing, resuming his seat behind his desk with a smile.
"I see so not only where you aware of the deception and abuse but apart of it?" Susan blinked stunned.
"We thought you would like a visitor, Percy declared he was first and well when push came to shove he literally jinxed the others to their chair. But felt the whole clan was a bit much for you to handle at once." Harry laughed a bit bitterly.
"Then welcome Home Harry." Cissy kissed his forehead softly, rocking the poor broken thing in her arms. She would be as much mother to this boy as she was to her own son Harry needed her, needed them.
"They are fantasy Harry that is all, if you will excuse me. I wish to retire to my room." She sniffed turning on her heel exiting the room.
THOUSANDS OUTCRY OVER BOY WHO LIVED LIVING WITH DEATH EATER!
"No need to thank me Harry I've already inquired about a family for the child for now he can stay here as well. Do you feel up to some food?" Draco asked nodding slightly as he let Draco help him down a short flight of stairs and into the kitchen and helped him sit down and Harry ate the most wonderful porridge he'd ever had in his life. He could only manage a quarter of it before he felt full.
^ To Prong's protector and father who lived and died Fighting
his unruly hair he managed a small smile.
"Thank you Marcus, Draco I'm going to go lay down for a while." Hermione smiled softly at both men, handing Marcus his handkerchief and Disappeared up the stairs.
"At the time I would have said yes, Because I am a muggle born I struggled to find my place in my new world. I threw myself into my studies because I felt I had to work twice as hard and show that I belonged among the Pure-bloods. That and Magic was so special and extraordinary I wanted to know everything I could as quickly as I could." Hermione folded her hands around her cup of tea looking down into the liquid.
Harry grew frustrated and jealous of this woman who dared to flirt with Draco in front of him. Harry jolted with realization Draco would fall in love with a woman and create a family that did not include Him.
"Good morning Hermione." Gloria bid when she stepped through the Floo.
"So at no point in time did you have any idea he thought you were together?" Sue asked.
"This one belonged to my grandmother, and it's passed to the next young woman of our family. It should have gone to Dora but I hear she would not have found it very useful." Cissy smiled sadly.
"Mi Merlin I can't even fathom what you have been through. Ron was a sweet boy. How could he do something like this." Percy cried as he held the girl tight.
"We can still go when you are better. I'm sure we could convince Cissy, Andromeda, and Fleur to take care of the kids here together, you, me, Draco, Marcus, and Our Weasley brothers will destroy Thorpe Park. But you still have to ride the coaster as promised."Harry laughed.
Hermione eased looking at the baby her ramrod posture easing as the baby cooed in her arms.
Pack your shit I need your help protecting the Manor please get the hell out of that house you hate sell it and get here. It's bad can't say how bad in a owl just hurry.
"Marcus or Draco?" Cissy smiled softly when Hermione looked up at the older witch.
"No further questions, This man has willfully held a single witch against her will! This is not the case of pre existing relation as it has been portrayed, the accused had no prior relationship to the victim beyond school friends he knowingly tricked an innocent woman and held her captive to be assaulted and raped repeatedly over the course of three years!" Her lawyer demanded as Ron was given the antidote.
"Actually It was quite a bit of brilliance Kingsley had the idea of a ward that leaves all wands inert unless given spoken direction by one of three people Myself , the deputy Minister and Kingsley himself. The brilliant part is the ward was built so that to use magic here regularly you have to have cretin licenses to do so Department heads keep these up so that no staff would be without magic but they are also closely watched anything used with ill intent is questioned and dismissed. Once Draco steps out he will no longer have permission to cast magic here unless given permission again Bill Weasley and a goblin specialist were brought in to create the ward. Now wands out once we land we have no idea what awaits." Susan answered and motioned for the piece of paper Draco turned into a Portkey once everyone was touching it Draco muttered.
They stood in what appeared to be a house of some sort, everything in it unknown to Draco.
"Let's see." Olivander waved his wand over Harry and nodded slightly " Seems as if a great change has occurred, you no longer need a fighter's wand , no Holly for you. Beachwood , Cedar , or Redwood for you my boy." He flicked his wand three long sticks of wood came flying out of the darkness and hovered in front of Harry.
"Biggest tomboy I ever met Tonks was, I was quite jealous of her Metamorph to change her hair at will, she was never ashamed of herself. I wish I had half her confidence even back when I knew her." Hermione returned her tone matching Cissy's.
"Thank you Susan." Harry said softly.
Lord Malfoy,
"Ready or Not Mate she is being forced one way or another." Draco glared at Marcus.
Narcissa just smiled sadly ushering the young woman to the bathroom and into a giant tub. An hour later of soaking in the hottest water she could stand she sat in a clean light blue cotton dress at Narcissia's vanity table smelling of Jasmine feeling like a person again as liberal amounts of secret Black family hair potion was applied to her wet hair. Hermione sat happily as the older witch dried her hair into perfect ringlets.
"Wait Susan what do the Weasley's have to do with this?" Harry asked.
"Hello little sister Welcome back." He smiled brightly.
"Of course he is your escort, The minister expects him too." Sue waved them to follow her up to Kingsley's office.
"Mr. Weasley Is right I need to rescue Hermione after everything she has done for me she has always been on my side she never abandoned me I want to go rescue her.I never thought Ron would hurt her he was in love with her. Please Susan I have to go with you!"Harry babbled in a rush Arthur Weasley was stunned seeing Harry and Draco Malfoy standing together.
Bright amber Eyes blinked up happily Hermione took a sharp intake of breath and stepped cautiously towards the toddler the eyes met hers.
"Ridiculous James Potter Hair to the Potter Family legacy Not have a will he was drilled like every other pureblood to have his will updated every 5 years. That is astounding I promise they will pay for keeping things from you." Draco promised eyes darker than Harry had ever seen them.
"I wish there was more I could do but with Dumbledore dead there is not a lot I can do Harry." Draco had told him.
"That was lovely dear." Cissy smiled.
"I was so afraid to go to the Trial I was scared he would somehow take me again, I kept living everything over in my head the entire time. It happened so quickly that one moment he was tormenting me with every breath the next dead, I almost lost it and cried right there in the courtroom. You allowed me to no longer have a tormentor. I was so relieved to be free from the hate. I... I felt so guilty after I did not know how to thank you without sounding ungrateful, you took on the pain of his life's blood on your hands just to free me...I.." At long last the pain of the last three years poured out of Hermione; she slumped out of the sofa on to the floor and cried in her hands. Marcus made to move to the girl but was stopped by a small hand on his forearm and a firm head shake from the healer. After what seemed like forever, Hemione wipe her eyes on her arm and tried to breathe again.
"No, she is quite dependent on him at the moment I'm not sure if she returns the feelings yet or not." Narcissa pondered.
"Yes the Wizarding world has very backward views on women in general. How did it make you feel to have to rely on a man to fix your problem?" Gloria asked.
"Make it Lord Malfoy I give you permission under special circumstances as a one time allowance we should make our way to the atrium that would be the best place for this I also want one more Auror to go with I assume you are joining us Arthur ." Susan smiled as the balding redhead nodded She turned and led the charge to the lobby followed by Harry Potter, a Weasley, and  Lord Malfoy. She collected a Auror on the way to the lifts where Draco began the complex charm work to make a temporary Portkey. The group made their way through the atrium along the way Harry grew curious.
