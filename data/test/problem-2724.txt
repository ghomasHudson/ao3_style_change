Malfoy," she said, with a look in her eye that might have been amusement. "Not at the moment anyway," she amended. "But I daresay if you
Potter led the way through a false door and continued down the stairs below the level of the common room. Draco appreciated that. At least they weren't going higher in the tower. Finally they came to a landing and Potter threw open a door.
As he expected, the light led him away from the parts of the Manor he was used to spending time in. He passed through a door near the entrance to the kitchen and found himself descending a long straight staircase, then along a windowless corridor that Draco thought might be directly under the Great Room. At the end of the corridor the light led him down yet another set of stairs, bobbing easily along before him while Draco stumbled after it, and then down a third staircase, this one creaky and badly lit. It seemed to go on forever, leading deeper and deeper into the bowels of the Manor. Draco told himself that it was more a metaphor than an actual truth, that the Manor might have been born from magic, but it wasn't actually a living beast. He'd tried for years to convince himself of that; he'd had nightmares when he was little that the walls of his room were flesh and the breeze through the curtains was breath. In the mornings it had been easy to stick his head out the window into the sunlight and fresh air and laugh the nightmare away. Then when the Dark Lord was here, it had become almost a comfort, that if they lived within a beast, at least it was a Malfoy beast.
. Draco was fairly sure that one could not adopt an entire House, and even if one could, it wouldn't be Slytherin. Hufflepuff, maybe. That was the kind of House you could take home and keep in a box under your bed.
Harry. Harry wouldn’t let them drag him away. Draco drew a deep breath, trying to calm himself. Occlumency was no help—he’d never really mastered it. It was too stained with thoughts of Aunt Bella and her terrifying eyes, with the way she’d hissed excitedly through bared teeth each time he’d failed to keep her out. She’d never uncovered his secret, shameful desire for Potter at least. She would have been delighted to announce that at dinner, just like she’d announced how Draco dreamed of cock, that he spilled helplessly at night to thoughts of being rogered like a trollop. That had started it, the men, the need for protection from them—
“Let’s play rats and bats! The rats are already awake, so all we have to do now is call the bats down. I’ll have the Librarian--”
Oh, shut it, Dean, Harry thought furiously. Stop being so fucking noble and let's get a cock in my mouth. The sooner he did it, the sooner he could discover he hated it. The rest of the year would be horrible of course but it wouldn't be nearly as horrible as realizing that he liked this.
Blaise laughed as he guided Draco to a seat on the stairs of the central platform that dominated the room like a conductor’s podium. “See? You’ve never been the self-involved, oblivious aristocrat your father tried to make you into. You can’t help thinking about the people around you, wondering why they do the things they do, feeling your way under their skin.”
“No!” Draco’s hand flew out in front of him, coming flat against the barrier. “Don’t!”
“If I do, will you do what I tell you?” Draco asked.
"I really, really don’t want to do this," Ron said as the wand started up again. It wasn't entirely clear if the complaint was directed at Harry or at his brother or just at the universe in general. He'd spent a great deal of the past seven years doing things he really didn't want to do, after all.
"So?" Fred—it had to be Fred, his shrug was absolutely infuriating. "The Room of Hidden Things is part of the Room of Requirement. We just required it to stop being destroyed."
"Never," George said firmly. His head tipped to the side and the look in his eyes had turned curious. "We admit the ah, giver, specified in the contract wasn't chosen randomly. But it wasn't unfair. We just didn't get the result we expected."
“Draco’s not at Hogwarts,” Harry insisted. “I know he’s not. I’m going back to London. Remus--Professor Lupin--will know if there’s any way Draco could get to Azkaban on his own, and if there is, how I can follow him.”
“Yeah.” Draco realized he was clutching Harry’s shoulders. He let go and brought his hand back to his cock. Harry’s lubed hand joined him there, coating Draco’s shaft. Draco sighed in relief, the spell slick on his palm as he worked his foreskin over the head of his cock. His legs were trembling and he tried to still them, digging his heels into the mattress.
“You fucking did! You lied to me and you used me. You told me you wanted in to the Manor so you could get your fucking Potions book, and like a bloody idiot I believed you. You told me we were getting your sexuality key and I believed you. And you’ve been lying to me. This whole fucking
“Filch told you that?” Ron’s face scrunched in disbelief. He was lounging on the Gryffindor sofa, manspreading in a way he would never have dared if Hermione and the rest of the girls hadn’t already gone to bed. “Over tea and crumpets then? Just offered him a biscuit and he started dishing on the dirty sex secrets of Olde Tyme Hogwarts?”
Neville nodded. "I'd be even more fine if you wanted to go back to, you know—" His cock waved forlornly, untouched.
Potter's hand had gone tense on Draco's side, fingers tight against his ribs. "So there's a key to fix it, right? You'll be changing back?"
“But I’m sure he’s not, he--” Harry broke off. He couldn’t very well tell McGonagall that he knew Draco wasn’t on the castle grounds because he wasn’t showing up on the Marauder’s Map. But the lake wasn’t on the map. Draco’s body could be down there growing cold and waterlogged, his pale hair floating gently in the water, his lungs heavy with water, Harry trying to pull him to the surface and unable to move him, Draco’s mouth hanging slack and filled with water, his head falling back--
"See? As I was saying earlier, beginning in the correct position is crucial to doing this well." Malfoy look grew unbearably smug. "Poor Longbottom there has his legs trapped in his trousers. You can barely get to his bollocks, let alone anywhere else."
Anyway, it wouldn't be Malfoy. No way did an elegant little aristocrat like Malfoy crave going down on his knees for blokes. Accepting a willing mouth was different. It didn't necessarily mean Malfoy wanted to return the favor. He might have been enjoying Harry's mouth while he pictured massive tits and girly bits for all Harry knew.
"If he needs a good kicking, Potter, you don't have to get your own hands dirty." Theo strolled forward, stopping with his shoes nudging Draco's bottom lip. "We're happy to do it for you. We'll hurt him as much as you like, mate."
Alarm stirred inside Draco. He really, really did not want Greg to open his mouth right now and start talking about Lucius Malfoy. Not that Draco was ashamed of trying to help Father—there was nothing more honorable than protecting your family. Still, he hardly expected Potter to understand that. So. Time to really start a nice, distracting fight. He reached out and shoved Potter.
Potter's eyebrows raised but the sneakoscope had already started to spin and after a second he seemed to get it. "Oh. I see. You're testing to make sure it works."
"It's not a loss if you want to do it, love." George wrapped his arms around Harry and gave him a little squeeze. "And it's not the end of the world if the people who love you know what you like."
He'd left Draco on his knees, with a perfect eye-view of the flames. They danced upwards from the burning wood, crackling merrily. The key—his key—had lain there on the topmost log. It had shimmered in the fire at first and Draco had wondered, hoped, if maybe it was strong enough to withstand the heat.
Zabini turned with a sharp look. "His
The dog practically rolled its eyes. It shook itself again, then, when it was seemingly sure Draco would follow, moved once more, leading them confidently in a direction which seemed exactly the same as all the others: endless, silvery mist and nothing else. Of course, Draco considered, this place might be easier to navigate if one could steer by one's nose.
Potter looked mulish—at Draco, not at Widley. He took one bowl as Draco took the other and thanked Widley, assuring her that they didn't need beverages until the main course came. Which Draco agreed with. He didn't need pumpkin juice with his pumpkin soup, which had a slice of bread on the side, which was probably also pumpkin.
Marcus grunted. He wasn't polite enough to tell Draco he was going to come but Draco knew anyway. He'd been waiting for this moment. He pulled off with a wet plopping sound.
The cabinet had been waiting for him this whole time, hadn't it? Ever since its ebony and silver doors first caught his eye in a dusty corner of Borgin and Burke's all those years ago. It had been calling out to him ever since, inviting him inside.
If only he had some means of escape. The window curtains to the right of his bed were open, the solid black mass of the lake pressed up against the heavy glass like a curtain itself, one cut from the darkest, heaviest material there was. He needed a hiding place as deep as that, a place that would black out everything.
Draco adjusted the pillow behind him and stretched out a bit. It was easier to talk side-by-side than face-to-face. "Okay. Yes. If we do it properly. We don't have Veritaserum but do you have a sneakoscope?"
A little elf face poked up over the end of the bed. "Mr. Harry Potter! Sir! Widley is bringing your belongings and putting them where she is told to."
Blaise seemed to be suppressing a smile now, and damn it, it wasn’t funny.  On the wall behind them the Arithmancy equations swirled merrily around as if they too, were enjoying a laugh at Draco’s expense. The possibilities began to swirl inside Draco’s mind along with them. Gay Muggle couples had children, he knew. He supposed gay wizards could—it wasn’t common, but he’d read—and then there was adoption—would Harry want a Muggle-born? There were Muggle-borns who were rejected by families that hated magic—Draco could welcome a child like that—but what would Father say about—Merlin, what had got into him? He should be thinking about Father, not Harry. But he had to know, and maybe Blaise could tell him.
"Anyway, it's good timing," Seamus said. He looked Harry up and down appreciatively. Harry resisted the urge to cover his cock and cower, like some kind of cherub in an overly pink painting.
He couldn't bear to go back and admit that to the Aurors. They'd laugh their arses off—nothing would be more fun to them than to drag the formerly rich, proud Malfoy heir around his own house, rubbing his face in all its lowest places. Come to think of it, the Dark Lord had liked that too—he'd delighted in treating Father like a house elf. If Father knew the way to the laundry when the Aurors brought him here, he'd probably learned it then.
Potter swallowed and leaned back against the pillows, hands behind his head. He looked like he was trying very hard to seem relaxed, which was a difficult thing to accomplish with your trousers tented like that, in Draco's opinion. His own hard-on had disappeared on the way down the stairs. Thoughts of Father tended to do that.
Draco rubbed his eyes, understanding all at once what he was seeing. Rubbish bins. That's what people were using these cabinets for. Got something in your house you don't want? Throw it in your Vanishing Cabinet and have it belched forth from its mate here inside the Veil. Banishing charms were all very well, but it took a lot of power and a fair amount of skill to make them work. Far easier for you—or your house elf—to open a cabinet door, fling it all in, and have it conveniently take itself out.
Draco sighed. “That’s not going to work. It’s not a physical barrier. There’s nothing there for it to physically drill through.”
Nott muttered, and the stone wall slid open with a hiss. "After you, Malfoy," he drawled, extending his arm.
The circle exploded. Theo laughed, Greg huffed out in disbelief, and Marcus threw his hands in the air.
He ran down the stairs, water slopping from the cup. He pounded up the few steps of the dais and stopped—barely—before the curtain. It waved out towards him, as if playing peek-a-boo.
Draco’s hand was shaking. “I can’t,” he finally gasped, letting go of the Veil and dropping his wand at the same time.
-Potter? I should have known. Who else would do this to me?"
"Potter. I see your sense of timing is every bit as expert as your ability to communicate." Zabini let Malfoy up, who pulled off with a gasp and a groan, then set immediately to sucking bollocks into his mouth.  Malfoy's ears had perked up, though, and he seemed to be paying as much attention now to the question as the bollocks he was gently laving.
Remus turned on his heel and Apparated away, leaving Harry staring after him, his biscuits forgotten. Werewolves really were being used that way at Azkaban. That meant at least one thing Draco had told him was true. And look at how Remus viewed the situation. Remus was concerned for the werewolf, which of course Harry understood, but without a mention of the man the werewolf might kill--Draco’s father.
It was too late though. As Harry watched, Zabini gave out a hoarse cry and came. Malfoy swallowed and sucked, moving now, taking the arrhythmic thrusts that Zabini couldn't seem to control. Come spilled over Malfoy's lips and he sucked it back in with eyes closed with pleasure. He pulled off at last and sat up, his own cock red and stiff between his legs.
Harry glanced at Zabini, who was looking back at him in surprise. Neither of them had considered that.
On the next roll, he could see Greg standing near the bed, feet shuffling in indecision. Should he help? Should he leave? Draco could practically read his mind—never a hard thing when it came to Greg. Frankly he hoped Greg buggered off. This wasn't a fight Draco wanted to be saved from.
“Wait! Please don’t Incarcerous me," Draco blurted. "I got Dawlish the key because he put a werewolf in Father’s cell, he said Father would be killed or turned if I didn’t give it to him. If you don’t believe me, go to Azkaban and check, please check, the full moon’s tomorrow and the werewolf is still there, and I swear I wouldn’t have violated my parole--”
A surge of rage went through Draco, but even as his hand was going for his wand, he stopped, the terrible realization hitting him.
"Potter?" A little tenseness had crept back into Malfoy's body. "So, I was thinking about what I wanted to ask. My question."
Minch’s eyes snapped upwards from the daily Quidditch scores. His eyes widened as he took in who was standing in front of him. “Cor…” he whistled, “it’s Harry bloody Potter himself, innit?”
Please note: this chapter contains a brief scene of impulsive (and unsuccessful) suicidal behavior. It's being noted here as it did not originally appear in the header tags, which have now been updated.
“Don’t worry, Potter.” Draco’s face had turned amused. “They’re just common pipistrelle bats, tiny little things no more than an inch or two long.“
Greg's eyes flicked to Theo. Draco could almost see him think. Greg had always pashed on that cousin of Theo's, the one who went to Beauxbatons, but she wouldn't give him a drying charm in a downpour. Having some favors on the string could get his foot in the door. An invitation to a family dinner. A good word put in.
Harry wanted to say.
“There’s nothing left to say.”
Harry hadn’t understood at all, of course. And after seeing the Manor, Harry had understood less, not more. What had he said when Draco had tried to explain how rat-keys and the library’s bats fit into the tradition Draco and his parents were part of?
Draco glanced at the sneakoscope but it wasn't spinning. "
Harry frowned as he took a seat, watching as Remus brought out his stash of tea. Was it still that bad for werewolves and their children? Things were supposed to be getting better. “You’re at the Werewolf Outreach Office now,” he said, trying to bring his attention to something other than his own problems.
All of a sudden, Draco’s babbled justifications in the hotel room rolled back into Harry’s head. Something about werewolves and Azkaban. What was it, exactly? Harry took his cup of tea with thanks as Remus sat it in front of him. Biscuit packets leaped from the counter to the table, opening themselves suggestively, offering up their contents. “It’s just that Draco said something about werewolves in Azkaban being used to menace people,” he said slowly. “Do you think that might be true? Have you heard anything?”
Dawlish’s voice made Draco jump, his elbow banging hard into the stone wall. Dawlish must have sneaked in from the far side of the Flesh Eater’s garden; he now stood at the stone table in the garden’s center, a tall imposing figure in his Auror robes, face shadowed in the twilight.
Sirius blinked, startled. “I don’t—I think—yes. How did you know? He didn’t come back with me. I don’t know what happened to him.”
"Four a week, per person." Blaise tongue flicked out of his mouth, a subtle reminder to those who had felt his lips wrapped around their cock. He didn't need to promise enthusiasm--he could just remind people of the pleasure they'd already had.
"I saw you in the pensieve," he managed at last. His voice shook, and he hated himself for that. "Dawlish showed me."
Nev was eyeing him now with something between sinking hope and resignation. The poor sod looked about ready to cry with need, to be honest, and his bollocks, when Harry snuck a glance at them, were shiny and swollen tight. Harry almost snickered—he had a sudden cruel urge to start talking about Nargles and wander off.  Did Neville have it in him to enforce the contract? Would he have Harry's balls painfully squeezed until he opened up and sucked?
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sorry we've been neglecting your oral education," George-or-Fred said as they passed Harry on the stairs up to the dorms. "We've been busy."
“Fuck off, you.” Draco scowled, trying to banish from his expression whatever Harry was making fun of, but then Harry ran a finger across Draco’s jaw and over his lips and Draco felt his something in his chest go way beyond soft and straight into wobbly.
His eyes were so wide Harry could see the whites all around the gray. Draco shook his head, the panicked sounds spilling uncontrollably from his mouth. Then he dodged past Harry and tore out of the tool room.
He had to get in there. The other cabinet. Harry turned from the window, yanking himself free, and swam like mad for the mer-village. His brain tried to calculate rates of water flow versus the size of the room and then triangulate that against how long the average human could hold his breath but the only answer it could spit out was now, now, now, get there now.
Harry had never realized how crucial it was to know a wandless charm to put your clothes on in bed. He'd used it primarily for cold mornings but when you were come-spattered, bare-arsed, and staring up at a mixed pack of Slytherins and Gryffindors, it was the best trick in the entire world.
Draco stared down at his hand, where the stem of the key had burned its outline into his palm. But the pain of that was nothing against the slow stab of pain inside him, as if his body were being flayed open. His palm grew wet, began to blur. An image shot through his mind of himself on a wet bathroom floor, his chest flayed open, his life bleeding out. Harry Potter had done that to him too. Draco curled into a ball on the rug, trying to contain the pain, the bleeding, the tears.
He was in love with Malfoy. That was the truth. Probably he had been for a very long time, but he'd hidden it under other names like 'hate' and 'obsession'. Now It was out in the light and Harry could see it for what it had always been.
Potter let out an inarticulate cry and leaped up, pushing off of Draco's back. The air whooshed out of Draco's lungs and he almost missed seeing Potter's hands come up and violently shove Theo back, away from Draco's face. Theo stumbled back and Potter went after him and it was nothing like Potter wrestling Draco to the ground—this was serious.
“It’s getting heavier,” Draco said suddenly. He set the cup on the floor of the cabinet and as they watched, it grew as if hit with an Engorgio until it was the size of the fountain itself. Water continued to pour over its sides, onto the floor of the Cabinet. “I think Adhesio now,” Draco said, gesturing uncertainly at the edges of the Cabinet where they met the barrier.
When they stepped out of the lift, Harry held up the room key, a small scrap of mass-produced Muggle metal attached to a crude plastic tag. “Look,” he said, fitting it into the lock above the doorknob and grinning at Draco. “No claws or whiskers.”
The door might as well be steel, Harry thought a moment later as not even the smallest hole had appeared. What the hell did the Slytherins want their doors to withstand, a battering ram? There were flimsier portcullises, he bet, but he kept his magic strong and flowing. Malfoy was leaning back into him, open now in a way Harry had never seen, letting the stronger flow of Harry's magic pull his own out. Their magic was connecting, merging. It was... right. Being wrapped around Malfoy, with Malfoy pressing back against him, was right. If they ever managed to get out of here, Harry wasn't going to waste any more time. Every cell in his body, every particle of his magic, was telling him that the other things he wanted to do with Malfoy would feel right as well.
Harry grabbed his wand and threw a closing spell at the door, following it up with a locking spell. He gave McLaggen a long, appraising look. The bloke might be annoying as shite, but Harry had to admit, he was quite fit.
“So you’ve been servicing every bloke in eighth year and you
"I know who it is." His father didn't look at him. "Bad enough you disgrace me by presuming I can't look after myself. But then you rub my nose in it by sending round Andromeda's halfblood brat and that werewolf who knocked her up. As if I'd want rescuing by those scum."
He turned Malfoy's answers over in his head as he pounded up the stairs to the upper classrooms. Malfoy hadn't said he didn't like blokes. He hadn't said he did though, either. But it'd certainly seemed like he enjoyed it a whole bollocks-load when they'd been in bed together yesterday.
Draco huddled against the stone wall at the far end of Hogwarts’ kitchen gardens, his fist tight around the broken grimoire key. He hadn’t had the courage to go all the way into the Flesh Eater’s Garden, but from his position he could peer around the gate and have a clear view of the spot where Dawlish had ordered the meeting--the stone table was clearly visible between the spiky, gaping mouths of the Jupiter fly-trap plants lining the path.
The Dark Lord had spoken to Father about this and that. Nothing important. That wasn't the point. The point was to make Draco watch and to be sure Father shared in his shame.
, while McGonagall was sitting at the High Table eating eggs and bacon.
“So you’ve been lying to me this whole time.” The air around Harry began to shimmer and tremble, his magic straining to erupt with the full force of his anger.
"You're, er—"
Potter didn't know that the Dark Lord had broken the Malfoy line. There'd be no changing back for Draco and no pureblood woman would want to be bound to a man who didn't want to touch her. Not even Pansy, for all that she loved him, given the way the pureblood contract prohibited affairs.
Remus stood up, rubbing at his neck with a diffident air. “The point is that sometimes the things that seem most true feel that way because they’re what you believe about yourself. They don’t tell you anything about the other person. If you want to know something about someone else, you’ll have to talk to them.”
Harry felt a burst of confidence. He was going to win this. He sucked harder, going up and down as fast as he could. Neville tensed every now and then—was that a good thing or a bad thing?—but Harry didn't look up at him.
Harry groaned and sat up. "What it is? It's the middle of the night!"
He stuck his hand back into his PJs. Maybe the whole 'sex alone but with other people' was overrated. He tossed off fast, pushing himself through his fist again and again as he licked his lips, remembering the lovely pressure of cock on his tongue. He came with a buck of the hips followed by a sigh, and then he cleaned up, and fell asleep.
“Which argues, does it not, that Mr. Malfoy is indeed here at Hogwarts?”
and make light? He could flip a wall switch as easily as anyone. He could brew a love potion and make someone crave him, but it wouldn’t give him true and lasting love. Tom Riddle, for all his pathological fear of death, hadn’t even reached the average lifespan of a Muggle. What use was magic if it couldn’t give you any of the things you really needed? Family. Love. Life. Sirius. Draco. Dad and Mum and Dumbledore.
Harry pulled out a chair and sat down heavily in it. The sight of Remus drunk had unleashed something cold and fluttery in his chest. “Remus, please. I need to know if there’s any way Draco could have got to Azkaban on his own.”
Comments and feedback are very deeply appreciated and keep the chapters coming!
"Fuck, Draco," Potter said at last, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, "That was fucking—"
“I’ll come through,” Harry said, thinking out loud, “and wrap myself around you just like when we put our magic together and drilled a hole in the door of your dorm room. Besides, that way I’d get to touch you ag—”
Oh Merlin, was that what this was all about? Had Potter arranged everything to lure him up here to the Gryffindor tower then he and the Weasel and the rest of the Gryffindors were going to heave him off in payment for his crimes? It would be like one of those mystery books by that Muggle woman Mother pretended she didn't read—Agatha Crispy, or whoever it was.
"Why did you agree to be the Gryffindor sucker?" Malfoy's brow had furrowed and the uncertainty had crept even higher. "You have power. People will do anything for you already. Why would someone like you need to collect favors?"
Ron climbed into his own bed with a happy sigh. "Hell yes, Harry. Faster you get out of sight, the better, especially when it comes to the twins. Hang around and they're likely to get a second wind." His face scrunched up in memory. "Or start testing things on you."
Hope surged in Harry's chest. Had Malfoy thought of something? "
“I want to too,” Harry said.
The Vanishing cabinet was dry inside, for which he felt oddly grateful. He remembered from last time that the connection with the other cabinet could be tricky to establish but once it happened, the transition from one cabinet to the other was very sudden.
“What the hell do you know about it, Tonks? You likely fucked your way to the--”
Dawlish’s frown, however, had settled on a kitchen elf who had come to pick up the morning carrots. Draco bit his lip, even more uncertain now. What did Dawlish want, if not to simply yell at Draco? He followed Dawlish meekly as the Auror prowled through the garden.  Dawlish usually called Draco to the headmistress’s office for his probation check-ins. Dawlish liked the trappings of power there. He liked sitting in the headmistress’s chair, filled with the righteous feeling of being on the right side of the desk and the right side of the law. So why had he called Draco to the garden today?
Harry pressed his hand to his side, easing the stitch in it. Damn his lack of Quidditch this year—he should be able to run around a stupid house. On the other hand, he considered as he looked around what had to be at least the third ballroom they’d run through, that probably just went for normal houses, not Malfoy Manor. They’d gone down a corridor then up a staircase which felt miles-long and probably was, then off again down some more corridors and up more stairs, until they had to be so high up that it was higher than the Manor actually went. “What floor are we on, anyway?” He moved over to the window. The ground looked very far away. “From the outside, the house looks like three, maybe four stories,  but we're much higher than that.”

. Of course they’re the symbol of my house. What else would better represent my family?”
“Yeah, I promise,” Harry muttered, and tore out of the kitchen. Behind him he heard Remus say something in a low voice, and Sirius’s barking laugh in answer. He hoped they would think he was leaving so quickly because he’d picked up on the energy between them and wanted to give them space. And he did, he really did, even if he also wanted days, nights, weeks, months, years of Sirius—and Remus too, to make up for all the time they’d lost. But right now he had his own love to find, and he knew exactly where to start looking. The front door of Grimmauld Place flew open at his approach, ready now to help him just as it had held him up before. He hit the doorstep, turned in place, and called out “The Ministry of Magic,” spinning himself into the Apparition spell faster than he ever had.
Draco closed his eyes. “It’s okay. It feels… nice.” In fact it felt a hell of a lot better than ‘nice,” but Draco wasn’t going to admit that just now.
The sound that went right to his heart though, was a different one—it was the faint scratching of magic across paper on the chart over their heads. Marcus's vote, going to Draco. He had won.
about it all.” George’s face is flushed red as he tries to reason with his parents.
Malfoy’s sharp, pale face stares up at Harry from the front page of the paper. Despite the fury behind his eyes he has an air of smugness about him, his thin lips twisted in an insolent, defiant smile. A hot flush of anger pulses through Harry, and he flings the copy of the
“You said he was harassing me a minute ago, now you’re implying we’re doing something else. Make up your mind.” Harry glares at Robards, anger coursing through him. The fogginess from before has left his mind completely and he sees with perfect clarity the choice Robards is offering him, which is no choice at all.
has been hounding him for an interview and the press are another thorn in Harry’s side, forcing him to go and see Molly and Arthur before the nature of his relationship with Draco becomes front page news. Harry knows he should speak to the press at some point—he’s learned that sometimes interviews are more impactful than allowing untruths to fester—but there are people that deserve to hear the truth from Harry himself before he can even consider making a press announcement of his own. Besides, he’s not sure he could even get through his story at the moment. He feels woefully ill-equipped to answer the questions a
“I’ll say,” Harry agrees. “Bump into one another, slip off into the nearest alley—”
His footsteps don’t land so heavily anymore. The voice in his head turns to a whisper and then fades away.
“Nobody’s chucked me in Azkaban for sanitising charms yet so I’m willing to chance it.”
.” Draco lets out a long-suffering sigh. “I’ve been dying to know what Harry Potter thinks about when he’s getting himself off.”
“I want to.” Harry sits up, looking a little more alert than he did when Draco’s mouth was around his cock. “Come here.”
Harry thinks about Draco on his knees in cruising spots. He wonders what sex has really been like for him, if he’s just assumed a role other people decided suited him. From the little Harry can gather, many of Draco’s sexual encounters have taken place in the shadows and cracks of the city. When people disguise themselves as potential partners and then chuck you in prison when you show interest in doing anything sexual, it’s bound to make a person cautious about sharing their desires. He recalls the anger in Draco’s voice when he turned the tables on Harry in the Manor, and wonders if Draco expects him to want to do things a certain way because it’s what he’s always been used to.
Harry draws a breath, his hands trembling as he swallows around the lump in his throat. He’s strangely close to tears.
“Erm,” Harry says. His eyes have that hazy look about them and he can’t seem to stop watching Draco stroking him, the head of his cock poking out of Draco’s fist. “What?”
“Not that good.” Draco gives Harry a curious look, surprised he would care. “Anyway, if you and Wood end up falling off your brooms during a lover’s tiff, I might still get the chance.”
?” Harry rolls his eyes.
By this time, he’s usually shitfaced, waving his arms around on the dancefloor with Pansy and her latest witch. On quieter Friday nights he spends the end of the evening laughing with Blaise, complaining to Gregory about how horrible Merlin’s Kitchen is or getting last orders at the bar—something expensive, if Theodore’s involved.
“I’m perfectly capable of doing my own paperwork.” Draco lets Harry in, nevertheless. He looks different, dressed in his own clothes. His hair is perfectly styled, lacking the soft wispiness it had in Azkaban. His smart blazer and fitted trousers are paired with a striped shirt open at the collar, his midnight blue velvet slippers bearing the Malfoy insignia. It’s all Harry can do not to roll his eyes.
“Thanks, Harry.” Ginny seems more at ease. She pulls a face when one of her team yells something in the background. “I’ve got to go. Let me know when you fancy coming to Cardiff. We’d love to have you. Anytime.”
“How’s that going for you?” Draco asks. “Confronting things.”
“I think you’ll find I’ve made my own fortune, and Gringotts has benefited substantially from my expertise,” Draco snaps.
“Why would you keep chatting to me if you’ve known all this time?”
Draco takes the wand carefully in his hand and bites back a groan of pleasure as warmth travels over his skin like a caress. The magic is confident and instantly familiar, but it’s far weaker than Draco would have expected from someone with Potter’s history. Holding Harry’s wand is the magical equivalent of straining to hear a favourite song that keeps getting lost on a changing wind.
“I know that, and you know that.” Kingsley laughs as if the very idea is ridiculous. “Nevertheless, unsubstantiated rumours can have devastating consequences for one’s career. You’re aware of the rumours that plagued Albus Dumbledore to his death, of course.”
, the name Draco uses to protect his anonymity. Of every problem Quick-Match has caused, that’s the biggest of them all. Draco knows he has to do something, but he can’t just pack it in after chatting to Harry for one long, balmy summer and a hectic autumn. It wouldn’t be right, and Draco is, despite all evidence to the contrary, trying very hard to do the right thing these days.
“I went to stay with mother and father.” Draco focuses on Harry properly at last, his expression haunted. “To tell them about me, and about you. About us.”
humility, but he can’t deny that the sense he’s about to get a lecture from Potter rankles. Any flicker of pleasure he gained from being trusted with precious Harry Potter’s wand disappears entirely.
.” Draco huffs and folds his arms over his chest. “Isn’t that enough?”
, his brain niggles. He ignores it, searching for a nice, neutral question that doesn’t involve Malfoy’s stupid sex life. “Do you have any other visitors?”
“If he cares for you, I doubt he’d mind.”
Draco really needs to pull himself together. He refuses to spend the night simpering at Potter like a lovesick Kneazle.
.  He decided against giving them an interview in the end, but he released an official statement when the press speculation became too outlandish. The
“No. No, of course not.” Harry nods at Kingsley. “Thanks.”
Draco swipes his hand over his eyes, before meeting Harry’s gaze. “You need to understand that I’m a very different person to the boy you knew, the one who ran away at the first sign of trouble. I don’t just change allegiances and find an easier alternative when things become difficult. It’s not who I am. Not anymore.”
“I do best when I’m active.” Harry shrugs. “The problem is when things are
“You could have done, it’s no more than I deserve.” Draco frowns at Harry. “I wasn’t making any noise. I didn’t wake you, did I?”
“Does this mystery man have a name?” Part of Draco wants to hear Harry say it because there’s part of him that still doesn’t believe he has the power to make Harry look so unabashedly happy.
“It didn’t seem right, hocking it for something I’ll only need to replace again in a couple of months.” Ginny leans in to press a quick kiss to Harry’s cheek, before sitting back with a grin. “You can get me new gloves for Christmas.”
“Just stuff.” Harry reaches across the sofa when Draco sits next to him and twines their fingers together. “It drove me mad not being able to do this tonight. I never realised how much I took that for granted. How do you do it?”
Harry laughs and the sound warms Draco’s skin. As they sit close with their legs pressed together, it occurs to Draco that Harry doesn’t just look good. He also smells fantastic. His cologne is rich, leathery and expensive. The underlying sweat from the exertion of dancing calls to mind other things that might make Harry sweat. Draco looks briefly at Harry’s lips, a steady pulse of unquenchable desire making everything unsteady.
“The law has changed. It changed over a year ago. Why the fuck are people still being arrested?”
“How’s your wand?” Away from the crowds, they stroll towards the castle to collect Harry’s things before going into Hogsmeade for the after party at the Three Broomsticks.
“I don’t know.”
Harry huffs, sitting back on the sofa and folding his arms. It might not have been the most intimate of visits Harry’s ever had with Ginny, but it’s not like Harry needs sex every week—or even every month. He’s not that fussed about sex—despite what his wanking habits may suggest. It’s another reason he and Ginny are compatible. They laughed loads and went flying every day. Malfoy doesn’t know what the fuck he’s talking about.
“Ok. Let’s break up then.”
It started with subtle symptoms, a headache that came and went several times over the course of a couple of weeks. Then some nausea that usually resolved itself when Draco took the time to eat. He figured it was just stress. The physical manifestation of his life falling apart around him a couple of months ago. Each of his friends had taken to inviting him out to eat at least once a week since the breakup, one after the other on a set schedule. Even Ron and Hermoine took a shift, making sure he still came out to pub nights even if Harry was very noticeably missing. Between them and Phillip it felt like he was rebuilding a new normal for himself.
Official Sound Track: Marianas Trench, Ever After (the song not the album)
“Too young for a garden?” Draco wasn’t being deliberately obtuse. He just felt like he’d been bamboozled.
They both heard the door open and looked up to see Phillip walking into the delivery room with a bouquet of paperwhite narcissus and lilies to symbolize the family that Scorp was never going to get to know. As sad as that thought was, between Draco, Harry and Phillip, Scorp would never want for anything in this life.
That first conversation about the baby ended up being much easier than he expected. Harry had taken it very calmly. Like he was resigned to them getting back together to raise this child. It was nice that Harry was ready to step into the role of a family because Draco certainly wasn’t. Did he still love Harry? Yes. Had he forgiven him for destroying their life together? No. Had he started moving on? Yes. Even though Phillip and him had only really been dating for six weeks. He was more curious about what type of life they could build together than he was about the life he had had with Harry.
Five months.
In all of magical history, there were only 28 recorded cases of a wizard getting pregnant without the use of potions. That’s 28 cases, in 10,000 years in a population that averages 1,400,000. That means as a wizard, you have a 1 in a billion chance of falling pregnant unaided. And yet, here we are.
He thought it was too early to start dating. Pansy did not. It took a month after the break-up before she was trying to set him up with any and all eligible young wizards between the ages of 21 and 31. At first he resisted. It was too soon. But fighting with Pansy was more trouble than it was worth and so they came to a compromise. She got three chances to set him up and if it didn’t work out with any of them he got a break.
“See! That’s the problem.” Harry seemed entirely too calm for this. “We’re too young.”
Several non-dates later. Draco was seriously reconsidering the whole not-dating thing. After all, Harry was certainly dating his way through town if the prophet was to be believed. A month after they first met, Phillip and Draco shared their first kiss.
The first one was a total bust. A snobby young pureblood who seemed to think Draco was some simpering ditzy debutante who was just looking for the groom to her blushing bride. An easy one to dismiss.
At 126 days they can hear you when you talk to them
In real life, unlike in the movies, you don’t get a warning before things go bad. No foreboding theme song to let you know that the building’s about to explode. Life happens on its own schedule and when things go awry you just have to deal with those moments as they come.
There are some things that are extremely difficult to quantify. Things like the value of a second chance at love. The weight of that feeling you get in your chest when someone you care about is hurt. The gravitational forces that bind a family together.
They were sitting in a small neighborhood cafe waiting for their sandwiches and debating about whether boomslang skin could be used in this potion without the addition of any alkaline solutions to stabilize it. Draco had just stood to go to the bathroom, continuing his point as he folded his napkin up and placed it on the table.
And with that. They ended their old life together. In a surprisingly short, inexplicably calm conversation.
It takes 22 days from conception for a fetus’s heart to start beating
“I think we should break up.”
86,400 in a day,
“Can you just stand still for a second so we can talk about this.”
“You’ve already said that! I want to know why? I don’t just don’t understand. We’re… we’re supposed to meet up with Neville this weekend, to get some ideas for the garden now that spring is here. And Blaise and Pansy are coming over for dinner next week. And we have our weekly pub nights with Ron and Theo and Hermoine and … We have a plan. We have a schedule. We have a life and it works. You can’t just come down for breakfast and break up wit-”
“You… you know that’s not what I’m talking about.” Harry’s voice faltered for the first time since he broached the subject. “I just mean. We started dating when we were 18. Neither of us had ever really dated before then. We never really got to experience the normal things that kids our age should have because of the war. I want more than thi-” Harry stopped, trying to find a way to phrase it without discounting what they had.  “I love you but I want to be selfish for the first time in my life. I have too many regrets. I just want to live a little. We’re too young to be living like we’re middle aged with this set routine to our lives. Is it so bad for us to try out living apart? To experience what it's like to date someone you didn’t go to school with? To do things that aren’t expected of us? I need this.”
“Thanks.” Harry grins. He sobers and considers Millie’s suggestion that Harry’s interest in Draco might not be a one-way thing. “He’s been doing this for so long and I’ve got no idea what’s going to happen. If things go to shit he won’t want another mess when he’s just got over his own. The timing is all fucked up. If I had a year to get used to it—”
It turns out to be an excellent plan.
“I hated you, the whole time you were gone,” Harry breathes. He leans in until his lips almost touch Draco’s. “I hated you for leaving.”
Do you think we’d recognise each other, if we both went there on the same night?
“It’d make my life easier if you didn’t,” Harry mutters. His mind wanders and he sits back on the sofa, taking in the shadows that flicker and dance over the pristine white walls.
“I’ll do that.” Harry grins at Ron. “Thanks, mate.”
“We can turn the soundproofing charms down.” Harry is back to being smug again. He takes his wand from his pocket and murmurs a few unfamiliar spells which bring the music from the outside in. “Better?”
going to be an Auror in a Glamour.”
“I’m starting to.” Harry grimaces. “Malfoy’s well over twenty-one. We all are.”
Harry doesn’t want Draco thinking he needs to handle him carefully, like something breakable. He honestly wants exactly the opposite. Restlessness has been buzzing under his skin for so long, he’s eager for Draco to know it’s okay. Harry’s okay. With this, at least. There’s something about this night and this moment that makes him want Draco to be the same, unapologetic force to be reckoned with he was back in the Manor.
Harry gives Draco the kind of look that makes the night heady and unreal.
.” Draco cuts Harry off in his tracks. “I believe you. Stop.”
“Hello Harry.” Hermione tucks her wand briskly into her robes. “This is a right old mess, isn’t it?”
They kick off their shoes and Draco peels off his socks, pushing down his trousers and leaving them in a pile on the floor with Harry’s discarded shoes, jeans and t-shirt. When they’re both in their underpants, Harry grabs Draco’s hand, pulling him through the hall and into a vast, airy living room lit only by the yellow-orange lights of the Merlin’s Kitchen beer garden.
“Of course I don’t,” Draco snaps. Guilt worms through him at the thought of the months of messages exchanged between Griffin and
“Mm.” Draco tugs the lobe of Harry’s ear between his teeth. “I can wash more than that, if you ask me nicely.”
, gets to do what he’s wanted to all night. He gives Draco a slow, searching kiss and pours his heart into it. Eventually, he pulls back. “I wanted to talk to you about Knockturn.”
“Because he was called to consult with the Metropolitan Police after a body of a low-ranking Muggle civil servant was found in the Thames. They were concerned the matters might be related. Apparently the poor man was missing a foot.” Robards waves his hand. “That, however, is not why we’re here.”
With a scowl, Draco hands over his outer robes and the entrance fee, watching his expensive cloak float across to a dusty Muggle clothing rail as the money
It’s early evening when Draco wakes to find Harry fully dressed, sitting on the window ledge and watching the first snowfall of winter. The flakes are illuminated by the soft orange lamps that light the cobbled streets of Hogsmeade when darkness falls.
“The only things I know about you, I’ve heard second hand.” Harry gives Draco a lopsided smile. “Not to mention I don’t always see eye to eye with Hermione.”
“Don’t be.” Harry extends his hand, awkwardly. “Thanks for coming to see me.”
“It’ll be even funnier when you show me your porn.” Harry grins, resting the back of his head on his hands. “I’ve been dying to know what you watch.”
Draco sniffs, thinking it’s very unfair that Harry looks as good as he does on a few hours’ sleep. Not to mention he probably started the morning flying wild Abraxans or swimming with Merepeople in the Great Lake.
They Apparate together in a whirl of magic.
“I don’t think so,
“You’ll need to. You owe me a very expensive shirt.” Draco takes a sip of his coffee which is unfairly delicious. Potter really is good at everything. It’s infuriating, to say the least.
“I thought you’d be okay with it.” Harry bites back a groan as Draco runs his fingers lightly over his stomach. “You could always punish me if you like,” he offers a little shakily.
Draco closes his eyes and tries to steady his breathing. He slides his hand down his stomach and palms himself through his trousers, before picking up his quill again. Unlike some people, he obviously hasn’t learned all the tricks of making magical wanking a satisfying experience. Potter probably dictates to his quill too, through those non-verbal spells of his.
“Do you make coffee naked?” Draco runs his fingers down Harry’s chest and belly, loving the dark, wiry hair and the way his stomach clenches beneath Draco’s fingertips.
“Then fuck me like you’re not,” Draco breathes. “Let’s pretend that’s all this is. You can fuck me like I’m a stranger.”
what you believe.” Harry is so furious with Draco, he wants to throw something. His hand twitches towards his wand, anger overwhelming him. “It’s the truth. You might think it’s stupid, pathetic probably, have a good old laugh if you like, but don’t make the mistake of thinking you know me better than I know myself. You reckon you’re so perceptive, just because you’ve been around the block a bit but you don’t know anything, you—”
You should have some idea by now.
“That’ll be nice.” Hermione relaxes, seemingly satisfied with Harry’s response. “I never thought I would miss this office, but I really think I’m going to.”
The hail from the night before has melted away and the sky is blue and vibrant. Harry drinks in the boldness of the air as the shadows disappear together with the heavy weight of secrets, chased away by the light of the sun.
“Yeah, you should. I liked it.” Harry gives Draco a lazy smile and reaches for him again. He pulls him close and sucks in a breath, running his fingers over the buckle of Draco’s belt. He slides his fingers lower over the hardness beneath Draco’s trousers. “I don’t much like it when you’re a pompous prat, but I definitely liked the way you stopped my head from spinning for a while.”
“Fuck…” Harry curls his hand around the sheets and blinks at Draco. “Are we going to talk all night, or are you going to get me off?”
With a warm laugh, Harry gets back to the job at hand. He takes Draco in his mouth again and this time there’s no hesitation. It’s clear that Harry has a goal. It’s a welcome relief because Draco’s certain he would vastly prefer long, lazy hours of orgasmic bliss to being wound up until he’s ready to climb the walls.
“Liar.” Draco looks Harry up and down, the warmth behind his eyes unmistakable. He holds up a bottle. “I brought wine.”
“I need to choose a ring first, anyway.” Harry shrugs and looks around the room for a way to change the subject before Malfoy starts interrogating him about his relationship. His gaze lands on two small, unmoving portraits of Draco’s parents. He meets Lucius Malfoy’s unflinching stare and resists the urge to stick his tongue out. He wonders why Draco keeps them here, imperiously watching him work. “If you’re not on speaking terms with your mum and dad, how come you’re still at the Manor?”
“How do you imagine?” Draco’s shoulders tighten. “Exactly as I anticipated. My father with disgust, my mother with tears.”
“Fire me? Yeah. They’re calling it
“Don’t you?” Harry raises his eyebrows. “It’s not that sudden. You might be surprised.”
“He’s certainly under something, darling.”
I expect one in return. Don’t try to fob me off with a picture of a limp flobberworm.
“Goodness,” Pansy says. “Potter’s back.”
“I’d like to see you try.” Lee snorts.
what makes him uncomfortable. Not disgust, or judgment. Harry knocks back the remainder of his brandy and replies as honestly as he can.
The rest of the sentence leaves Draco in a breathless punch as he finds himself facing Harry’s cock.
“As if I would.” Harry’s breath hitches, Draco’s implication pretty clear despite his evasiveness. “I thought you didn’t like it?”
away for nights when he’s horny.
The futility of having his biggest secret shared against his will leaves hot tears of anger pricking behind Harry’s eyes. He has half a mind to pre-empt any conversation between Ron and Robards, but he’s too exhausted and shell-shocked to know what to say. He doesn’t even know what time it is in America.
“I’m not—” Harry swallows back a curt response. It’s difficult to be authoritative when you feel like someone kicked you in the chest and your glasses are steaming up. “Just shut the fuck up and listen.”
“Sometimes, for most of it.” Harry nods. “I just had to…get away.”
“No.” Harry finishes his coffee and places the cup on the side. “Do you have anywhere to be today?”
“You’d be surprised. Your involvement was the only thing that stopped father from throwing me out of the house immediately. He’s remarkably deferential to Aurors these days.” A hint of wry amusement creeps into Draco’s voice. “I might have given him the impression you were just a Port-Key away, ready to come bounding to my defence like a lion cub.”
“You don’t want me moping around.” Harry scrubs his eyes. A hot, angry flush of tears threatens. It’s so stupid, so frustrating. He doesn’t want to cry over his stupid job in front of Draco. He just wants to be left alone until he’s had time to work things out. “I don’t want to do this. Not with you. I’m fine.”
“We’ve been trying to get them to come round.” Ginny’s expression turns miserable. “I keep thinking if they knew about me too, it could make it easier. But I’m even more terrified than I was before.”
“It’s normal for me. As normal as breathing.” Exhaustion sweeps over Harry and he gestures to the door. “Just go back to America, mate. Tell Robards I’m still a poof. Whatever.”
“I haven’t made any mistake.” Harry takes his coffee and hands his wand to Draco, with a reluctance that belies how much he loathes being without it even for a second. “I think my wand is dying.”
“Where what began?” Draco sounds amused.
“I can only imagine,” Draco murmurs. Yoga isn’t exactly his poison either, but the image of Harry stretching in loose trousers has its appeal. “Then you came back.”
“We’re a long way from rainbows.” Draco pulls a face. “The windows have always been covered, to protect the people inside as much as anything. The owners wouldn't want to find themselves charged with conspiracy to corrupt public morals. They tend to be suspicious of strangers on the door and won't let just anybody in. Before the new legislation passed we had to be even more careful. People had their own language of sorts, phrases and words that those in the know would recognise, to keep out anyone wanting to cause trouble.”
.” Draco licks his lips, delighting at the way Harry bucks into his hand. He murmurs a wandless lubricating spell and doesn’t miss the tensing of Harry’s body and the enthusiastic jump of his prick. “You’re not the only one who can do clever magic tricks.”
“It’s not my bed, so I don’t care if there’s crumbs in it.” Draco blows on the tea before taking a sip. “I don’t have toast in bed at home. I’m making an exception.”
“Well, that would be different.” A tendril of hope flares in Draco’s belly. As much as he would like to pretend he couldn’t care less about Harry’s blasted wand, the circles under his eyes and the hours of research would say different. “That’s the sort of information that would have been useful to put on the form, you idiot.”
“Hmm. Well, I’ll have to speak to Ginny myself.” Hermione gives Harry a shrewd look as if she doesn’t believe the story. “I’m not here for her tonight, I’m here for you. As long as she’s okay.”
“I thought you said the timing wasn’t right?” A small, euphoric smile tugs at Harry’s lips when they break apart.
“Perhaps. Depends what’s on your mind.” Although Draco is clearly attempting to keep his tone off-hand, there’s a brittle note in his voice.
“People say all kinds of things they wish they could take back, when they’re scared of losing someone.” Draco shrugs. “He loves us, in his own way.”
As Draco watches Harry Summoning their discarded clothes it occurs to him that Harry is still wearing his socks. The ugly, white sports socks are right there in his eyeline in all their offending glory, one pulled up to the calf and the other bunched around Harry’s ankle. There’s something so stupidly normal about them that it resets the balance of the world and Draco finds his sense of self returning with aplomb.
Harry bristles. “What’s wrong with proposing?”
. For the bad bits, the good bits and everything else in between. You’ll remember this. You’ll remember you started fighting for something new the night you came outside just to catch your breath.”
“What if I said I could get you the phoenix?” Harry moves towards Draco, his eyes shining.
“It’s not
“I’m not,” Ginny says, sheepishly. “I just want you to have a nice weekend.”
“She is, I promise. I’ve already spoken to her today. She was the first person I told afterwards. The only person.” Harry puts his head in his hands, nausea making his stomach turn. The tears that have been threatening to fall finally leave him in a burst and his body shakes as Hermione’s warm arms wrap around him. “I don’t—I didn’t mean—”
Harry laughs, the weight of the conversation with Kingsley easing just a little bit more. He doesn’t plan to tell anyone the full story because it could potentially compromise Kingsley’s reputation if people felt he had any inkling about Harry’s preferences.
of pleasure as Draco swipes his tongue over the head of Harry’s cock, enjoying the hot, velvet feel of it in his fist. “You’ve only just—”
“Well it’s not right, is it?” Harry huffs. “He’s your dad, he shouldn’t say that sort of thing to you.”
“I wish I was,” Draco mutters.
Harry hates how peculiar Draco makes him feel, and he’s determined not to let him have the upper hand. He knows Draco isn’t half as unflappable as he would like Harry to imagine. He moves closer to Draco, a pulse of anger flaring.
“Snooty Slytherins really aren’t my type.” Lee grins at Malfoy, before giving Harry a sheepish smile. “Surprised?”
. Besides, Harry doesn’t want to see Draco when he’s moping and miserable. He imagines himself hanging around the Manor like a dark cloud and sobbing on Draco’s shoulder. He’d look like a right twat. He doesn’t want Draco to see him like that. He doesn’t want to show too many of the broken parts, not this early on.
“Maybe I’m authorised.” Harry shrugs. He probably is the infuriating wanker.
“Yep. Lee suggest we invite Malfoy tonight. Mix it up a bit.”
“Anyone,” Harry murmurs. “You don’t have anyone better to do.”
Lee rolls his eyes. “We don’t think you’re more interested in him, you pillock. As if. Malfoy’s a tosspot.”
"You're not offering?"
“Now that you’ve got your key, let’s play a game!” Cassie jumped off the bed and grabbed Draco’s hand in hers, then turned to Harry and reached for his hand as well, her blue eyes wide and expectant. But when she saw how he shrank from her, her hand stopped mid-air.
“Draco, fuck, gonna come--”
Remus nodded. “True. But I didn’t try and that’s what I’ve had to live with. Perhaps—” he had to turn his head now, a choke in his voice quickly smoothed back into Remus’s ever-modulated tones, “—perhaps he would at least have gotten word I tried. That would have said enough, if not everything.”
Harry patted Nev's leg—yes, of course he'd get back to it--but he couldn't tear his eyes away from Malfoy. Apparently there'd been enough of the vaunted touches elsewhere that now the git could apply himself to Zabini's cock. It had just penetrated his mouth, dark and thick, and as Harry watched it slid slowly further in, stretching Malfoy's lips wide apart. A helpless groan tore out of Zabini's throat.
Minch handed Harry’s wand back as a memo zoomed onto the desk, unfolding itself as it landed. Minch’s eyebrows went up as he read it. “No need to explain, Mr. Potter. I understand.” He refolded the letter and pushed it across the desk for Harry to take along with his wand. “That’s got your authorization for the Department of Mysteries on it right there, so keep it with you.”
Potter plucked at his standard white school button-down. "Er, Malfoy? Can I ask you a question?"
the experience, not the way a Gryffindor would use the word. Sucking off the other Slytherins was too mixed up with shame and desperation. Potter, sodding earnest Gryffindor that he was, was asking something else. Well, what did Draco like, then? He liked the handjobs he’d had before the war, when he and Blaise used to fool around--not for favors but because it felt nice. And he liked wanking, of course. Maybe he liked that most of all, because those were the moments when he knew he was safe, with the curtains spelled around his bed and the rest of the world shut out for a little while. He liked fantasizing about Potter while he did it, and hadn’t Potter just confessed that he himself had been fantasizing about Draco since fourth year? He could tell Potter that, maybe.
For some horrible, awful, humiliating reason, he decided to pull Harry into a hug. What was even more surprising than his momentary lapse in control was that Harry hugged him back.
"Mate, like I said, tell him how you feel. Like, I would know what the bloody prick is thinking." Ron said exhaustively... this had been going on for approximately an hour.
Pansy and Blaise were just sitting on the bed beside him looking worriedly at each other, wondering when Draco would run out of air.
All of a sudden Harry woke up and realized he had fallen asleep right on Hermione's lap. He shot up and Hermione laughed.
"Well, then I'm right." Blaise sat down next to Draco on his bed. "What happened Dray?" Draco looked up at Blaise a bit surprised. He hasn't used that nickname in years.
"Save it, Potter."
"When did you get so smart?" Hermione asked.
What the hell had he done last night?
"My problem? My problem is one that all of you had for 7 years up until we lost the war. Bloody hell, I mean come on. We are better than them. Our bloodline is pure, unlike that filthy lot. It's bad enough we had to do that ridiculous bonding thing with them. You all are so two-faced as well. You are thinking the same thing. That's right, don't let them fool you." He added, because people seemed to be looking now.
"You had a crush on me? All... those years?"
"So you're sure nothing's in my eye then, Harry?" Draco said, giving Harry a look. Harry paused for a moment and then realization appeared on his face.
"Well... yes... but, not because he told me! I'm just obvers...obares...observant.. there we go." She laughed.
"Like you all weren't just as bad as me before you started sucking the Gryffindor's dicks, eh Malfoy?" Goyle sneered.
He made his way up and got to the entrance of the Room of Requirement. He snuck in and made his way to the bed that automatically transformed for him. However after sitting down he heard a loud thump and looked over to see Harry freaking Potter laid out on the ground.
"I like you, Lovegood." Draco said, a genuine smile on his face.
They started walking towards the Eighth Year common room.
I will probably regret this, Draco thought, but I'm gonna go see Harry.
"...You really have a way with words... thank you. I don't deserve to... you just really know how to make me feel better... I still don't get why you had a crush on me as kids. I was insufferable to you."
"I obviously wasn't great at handling my emotions. I wanted so badly to hate you, but you made it so impossible."
Harry was late.
Hi!!! I hope you enjoyed!This chapter was really fun! The pub scene will continue into the next chapter as well (;
The thing that sucked the most was that Harry couldn't get the feeling of Draco's lips off of his own. He kept touching his lips and wiping them but they just kept tingling. He never felt that way after any kiss with Ginny... but maybe he was just used to Ginny's kisses. She's not a bad kisser, in fact he quite enjoys it! And he loves Ginny! She's amazing... but there's just something about Draco Malfoy that mesmerized him... and he couldn't put his finger on it.
Harry
"You're fucked." Draco said to himself with a sigh.
"What?"
"As kids? Harry why do you think I want to make out with you all the time? It's still there... and that's one of the reasons I always liked you. You didn't just take it, you gave it back to me. And it doesn't hurt that you're hot." Draco loved the blush that formed on his cheeks.
"I ....one second...." Draco took a deep breath, "wow... I need to get in better shape. Whew. Okay...They broke up! She-Weasley broke up with him! Harry just told me."
"She told me she's dating Blaise... and Ron overheard he ran off and she went to talk to him. He kind of freaked out a bit and let it slide that Draco and I are...'
"Pansy!" Draco exclaimed.
"Ah, right. Well... here." Harry ruffled Blaise's hair up and then placed his thumb on his lips and rubbed ferociously.
Thankfully, with his sprinting towards the Great Hall, Blaise, Pansy, Millie and Crabbe were headed his way, so he could stop running and tell them the news.
It was about 8 minutes of making out when they heard a noise and looked to see the cause of it. Potter. Of course, it's always Potter.
the events following the bonding thing. it's a shortish chapter but i wanted to get some things rolling! hope you enjoy, leave a kudos if you do (:
The second bachelor was much harder to reject off the bat. He was funny. Very different from Harry. To start with, there was no history between them. Phillip had grown up in America and had only moved to London in the last year. His life was very firmly ensconced in the muggle world. Both his parents were muggles and his great -grandfather had started a very successful shipping business over 70 years ago. Despite finding out that he was a wizard at 11 and going to wizarding school till he was 17, Phillip had also kept up with his muggle education and had gone to university before joining the family business. In contrast, Harry had scorned the muggle world after the war. He didn’t do it in public, lest it encourage some of the anti-muggle sentiment that still permeated parts of the wizarding world, but he did make a real effort to stay out of  it. Phillip was easy, and witty, and dependable. Unlike both Draco and Harry, he didn’t have demons that were constantly chasing him. He had lived a fairly easy and happy life straddling both the muggle and wizarding worlds.
“You can’t solve it with lemongrass. Yes it would lower the acidity but it would render the minotaur horns basically inert, and you need those to -”
Scorpius James Potter Malfoy was born three weeks early. Harry almost didn’t make it to the hospital in time. After it was all over, the doctor placed Scorp on Draco’s chest and Harry sat next to the bed staring in Draco’s eyes as they took in the fact they now had a child together. Time seemed to stand still for a moment.
“Dammit Potter! Why now?” Draco kept moving through the kitchen with a frantic sort of energy. Rearranging the pots and pans, cutlery, everything, anything to keep his mind off the matter at hand.
Phillip and him had talked about the baby. That was when Philip had revealed that he was sterile - polo accident when he was a child. He’d never thought he’d have children. While he didn’t love the idea of Harry becoming a permanent part of Draco’s life, he was ready to help raise this child who at this point was a fetus of only 28 weeks old. Needless to say Harry and Phillip got on like oil and water. But they made it work. Harry wanted to go to all the birthing classes, to take part in all of the doctors appointments and be a part of the conversations around a birth plan, and what would come after. And he got to do all of that. Phillip got the times in between. He got to give Draco the backrubs when his back started aching. He dealt with the midnight cravings when he stayed the night and was the resident handyman as Draco started putting a nursery together. They made it work.
At this point Draco had moved all of the dishes in the kitchen into the sink and was aggressively scrubbing at them one at a time. Trying to wash off some invisible stain on the clean crockery. It took a while before he trusted his voice enough to respond.
“Yes! Too young to be settling into this pattern. Don’t you ever wonder if there’s more to life than this? The war ended and we just settled. It’s all been too easy. When did we stop looking for adventure in life?”
After that things moved pretty quickly. The doctor left and was soon replaced by an obstetrician. With a natural wizard pregnancy, as rare as they were, the baby tended to be underweight. Luckily, with the potions that were now available to help wizards get pregnant, there were also potions to support them in maintaining a healthy uterus and placenta. Even wizards who had fallen pregnant without the aid of these potions could take them to help the fetus grow. That was part of the reason why Draco wasn’t even showing yet.
Draco shook his head and continued with his frantic movements in the kitchen. Harry was making it sound like it had been such an easy path to get to where they were. It hadn’t been. At least not for Draco. It still wasn’t. There wasn’t a day that he spent out in public where someone didn’t look at him with suspicion on their face. Or hesitate before serving him at a store. Or unconsciously put themselves between him and any children when walking down the street. The overt hexes and curses may have stopped but Draco was still dealing with the impact of having been on the wrong side of the war.
3,600 seconds in an hour,
Draco looked down at the dark mark that had faded to a pale grey on his slender wrist. “No. It hasn’t been easy.”
Draco looked away first, holding the baby closer to his nose and taking in the new baby smell. Harry watched them both and for a second he regretted that moment many months ago when he had broken it off. Part of him grieved for the family that could have been. Another part of him knew that he had done what he needed to do at that time. If he could have looked into Draco’s mind he would have known that he agreed. That while they had loved each other; while they would always love each other in their own way, they had needed time apart. Time to live outside of the shadow of the kids that they used to be.
“You seem to be about five months along.”
Harry felt bad for asking for the breakup. That meant that Draco got to keep the apartment. For Draco that didn’t feel like a  win. If anything, it made it feel like time had stood still and he was just waiting for Harry to get back from a long trip.
It took two and a half months from when Harry had left before he finally found out. He was at lunch with Neville who’d asked him out to enquire about a potion that could revive dead plants. It was all theoretical of course. Just as there were no potions that could revive a dead person. Plants like people had a life essence that couldn’t be brought back once they’d crossed the threshold and moved beyond the veil of death. It was still interesting to debate the components of this theoretical potion with Neville whose brain seemed to sharpen into a precise weapon when you got him talking about herbology.
There are 60 seconds in a minute,
After Malfoy, Susan Bones started talking about how she feels like people don't acknowledge the fact that she was in the war too, she watched people die too. She lost loved ones just like everyone else.
Draco was heading to the 8th year dorms when an arm grabbed his wrist and pulled him towards the stairway outside the Great Hall.
"Ah, Mister Potter I'm so glad you could join us," Slughorn started, "10 points from Gryffindor for being late and disrupting my class. Take a seat next to Mister Zabini please."
don't worry i just love the dramione friendship- i want them to have a good solid friendship in this story. hope you liked it!
"Hi mate, want to study with us?" Ron said as Harry walked in the room, eyeing him strongly for, what Harry assumed to be, an out on studying.
"I... never mind!"
"Forever." And she pulled him for a tight hug. "Love you" She said in his ear.
He needed to find Ron and apologize. Harry didn't have words for how terrible and humiliated he felt, but he did have one question. Before he showed the memory Draco said "Don't think differently about me after you see it." After watching the memory Harry was confused. What did Draco have to be embarrassed of?
what he wanted. That simple aspect of just
Draco
"What's up 'Mione?" Harry questioned, rubbing his eyes from the blinding light of the common room.
Harry had heard enough. He went back down the stairs and walked right past Hermione. He didn't know where he was going but he just wanted to be alone.
Pansy smiled, "3,2,1..."
"Sorry...ugh, what do I do?"
"Right..."
"How did you know that I'd have the password?" Harry asked him. Draco chuckled.
"Ron-"
"Don't give me that bullshit, Harry! I'm your best friend. I've known you for 8 years. You think I haven't noticed something's been going on? When I ask again I don't want you to lie to me. What was that about?"
Draco smiled, "I suppose I am. Isn't that what love does to you? Makes you a little bit dense?"
"Oh... really? I'm, uh, I'm sorry to hear that." He was definitely not sorry to hear that.
"I... I... right." Draco mumbled, not knowing what else to say.
"Alright 8th years, how the hell are ya? I know you guys think this class is a waste since the war, but there are always things to learn. As for today, we are just going to be dueling. Any volunteers? Anyone at all?" Bill exuded excellence and was an astounding teacher.
"They told me they died in a car crash... they basically just lied to me all my life..." Draco could see that Harry was starting to get a bit choked up... seeing him in pain like this- knowing that he grew up unwanted... it made his heart hurt.
"DRACO!" Pansy yelled.
"Can you at least tell me how? This isn't like us, Blaise. We don't keep things like this from each other." Draco was trying not to feel hurt by all the secrecy, but it was hard. Could Blaise not trust him?
"Ok. I'll go find 'Mione. Let's meet around 6pm, yeah? Hogshead."
"Oh... well... I actually told Ron and Hermione that we're- uh... you know." Harry tried to explain their relationship but he had no idea what was going on.
He looked next to him and saw Dean and Seamus giggling about something, and then looked to the side of Ron and Hermione, to see Luna and Neville holding hands over top of the table. Neville was leaning his head on Luna's shoulder and she was talking about something that he was very clearly not understanding.
"Why would you say that? About Draco, I mean."
"Probably, it's getting a bit late."
"Shove off, Zabini." Was all Harry replied and Draco thanked his stars that it was over.
"Honestly? I wouldn't mind-" and so he did.
"I've never, in all my years! And Eighth Years no less! You all should be ashamed of yourself... violence never solves anything! You all have 3 weeks detention starting tomorrow! No exceptions!" McGonagall was yelling at them right outside the infirmary, where they had all just been treated for their wounds.
(See the end of the chapter for
"We might even just hold hands and sing friendship songs for all we know, she is a Gryffindor after all." Blaise said.
Draco gave Ron one last look before heading to his dorm.
"Sure. It'll just be a few minutes, love." Hermione leaned in to kiss him and Ron left.
"Draco! I'm sure. Please show me."
"Oh, I'm the dramatic one... interesting." She laughed. "Harry... can I talk to you about your potions essay for a moment? It won't be long but I just wanted to give you some notes."
"Hm? What's wrong?"
"WHAT?"
"Oh shut it, what? What am I missing?"
Since it's Saturday they didn't have class, and the eighth years were of age and therefore able to go into Hogsmeade when they pleased, (as long as they were back before curfew) everyone decided to go for a pint or two. They invited everyone, of course, but Dean and Seamus wanted to 'stay in' and Neville had plans with Luna and everyone else had other plans so it ended up just being Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Blaise and, you guessed it, Pansy.
"Yup. Can't tell ya though... best friend confidentiality and all."
"Hey... can we talk?" Ginny said, looked at Ron and continued, "alone..."
"Firstly, I have this for you, figured you'd need it." She said, handing him a hangover potion. Harry sighed in relief and downed it quickly. "Secondly, I want to talk to you about last night." Harry's face heated up and instantly felt worry take over his body.
"Well...Er... thanks, then." They looked awkwardly at each other.
"Harry, of course you'll have to study a bit more and work at it. I personally think that you'd be an incredible teacher. You've taught me so much in the time we've known each other, magical and otherwise. Kids will relate to you and love you. You're basically a celebrity anyway." Hermione and Ron laughed when she said that and Harry rolled his eyes. "Of course, you don't have to either. You can do anything you put your mind to."
Harry wasn't going to go to breakfast but then he heard his stomach grumble and decided to head down to the Great Hall. He walked in and everyone looked at him. There were a bunch of murmurs and all eyes were on him.
