She smiled back at him, “Come eat Harry, Kreacher’s made a feast, and you’ll need your strength later,” she said with a leer.
"Sorry, love, that tends to happen around me," Harry said with a warm smile. He reached over to Draco and took his hand, pulling Draco's hand into his lap. "And it sounds heavy, but Fred and George were a bright spot for me. A little normalcy in a sea of strange.  I wouldn't change that for the world."
“I guess I am more open and a lot less scared of saying what I’m thinking and feeling now.  After I died, when I chose to come back instead of moving on, I decided I really wanted to live my life this time. It made me realize I had to stop worrying about all the things expected of me.”
Harry blushes at the compliment.
“Oh no, sir. I am happy to belong to you, sir. I was born a free elf, sir, and I chose to serve Master Severus on my own. Master Severus suggested you would be the safest place for me to go when he was no longer here for me. Once I agreed, he arranged for me to become yours after his death.”
“I don’t even know what to do.”
“No Harry, I don’t, and it’s not just Teddy. It’s something I’m pretty sure I’ve always known, but hadn’t really considered. I grew up in an enormous family and my brothers are going to make tons of nieces and nephews for me to be around. But it’s never been my dream to become my mum. There’s so many things I want to do first if I ever decide to have a family. You though? You are meant to have a family, to be a dad. I just didn’t really think about it that way until I saw how comfortable Teddy was in your arms.” Ginny said with tears in her eyes. “Don’t mind the tears. I understand it all. It’s just going to take a bit of getting used to, I’ve spent the past year knowing that we might not be together at the end of the war, but it didn’t stop me from hoping that would be the outcome. I love you Harry, I care about you, and I feel a little selfish doing this now, when you have so much on your plate.”
“Both Andromeda and Teddy can come back to my house. I have a house-elf to help take care of Teddy. My house is behind a Fidelus charm now, it’s the safest place either of them can be for now.”
Bill took the next question. “When the three of you left Shell Cottage, Hermione looked like Bellatrix Lestrange, Ron didn’t look like Ron, you had Griphook with you, and the sword of Gryffindor. This morning we learn you got injured sliding off a dragon. I’m guessing you tangled with the dragon guarding the Lestrange vault, but why?”
Harry moves his hands behind her, pulling on the tops of her thighs, hard. Her grip tightens in his hair, and she starts rocking in earnest. Ginny is sure she must be hurting him, but he’s holding her too tightly to back off any, so she keeps moving, chasing her own pleasure. She’s so close, she shoves herself down hard, and the continuous pressure on her clit pushes her over the edge. Her body jerks several times with the force of her orgasm, then she finally slumps forward against the headboard. Harry’s hands slide back under her thighs and lift her gently, allowing him to take a deep breath. She notes that the muscles in her thighs are quivering, and she smiles.
“I think its because we’re young Harry. And we fought a war. A war you won. Our life can be different than our parents. With the pressure of the war, both our parents married young, and children young. We don’t have that pressure anymore. Wizards live a long time. We don’t have to rush into anything or settle down right away.”
Harry hissed, “Fuck! Your hands are like ice! Done?”
“I’m not taking him away from you Andi, I just want him protected and safe, and we still don’t know how the public and any remaining Death Eaters will react. Ideally, I’d like you both there.”
Harry grumbles sleepily. He tries to open his eyes, but the bright light from the window is too much, and he's hungover. His head is pounding, and he's reasonably sure a Hippogriff died in his mouth. "You were in charge of wards.  I was in charge of whiskey. Pajamas cause it's Sunday. They're Cannons orange."
When Draco walks back into the bedroom, Harry is already pulling on a pair of green satin pajama bottoms.  He passes a matching pair in midnight blue to Draco, who slides them up his slender hips. Harry's watching with an undeniable hunger in his eyes. "Breakfast downstairs first. Then I'm bringing you back up here for second breakfast," Harry says with a leer.
"Can I ask another question before you go on?  While they can't hear us?"
“Did kinda sound that way, didn’t it George.”
Charlie broke the silence as the group headed for the kitchen, “Clearly the three of you are not the same people that left the rest of us at the wedding reception.”
“No, mate. Hush. One thing at a time.”
“Really? That sounds promising,” said Charlie, his earlier leer reflected in his tone of voice.
“Um… well, it was your brother, but it wasn’t Ron.”
Process of elimination puts Bill is on the 'willing' list, but I haven't the foggiest idea why."
Harry called for Winky to gather Teddy’s things and bring them back to Grimmauld and get them set up.
Ron looked at Hermione, “Did I cut out enough?”
Harry nods.
Ron sighs, "Fine."
“Percy just pisses me off, so he’s a big giant no. I exclude Hermione and Ron because they’re too close to me ever to cross that line. I mean, all the Weasley’s family, but it hasn’t stopped me from falling into bed with most of you. Merlin, that just sounds wrong. Don’t really have any objections to Bill, so it’d be silly to say never.”
“Something is bothering you that can’t be fixed by our dear ikle Ronnikins.”
“I wasn’t expecting you to be kind,” Harry said with honesty. “Thank you for lying to him. I know you did it for Draco, but I know how terrifying that must have been. I also have a feeling you aren’t particularly sad about the outcome of this war.”
Harry pulls out his authoritative Head Auror voice, "Ron go down to the kitchen."
“I think I was already promised a repeat after the bath.”
“I belong to you now, sir. Master Severus insisted that when he died, I would then belong to Harry Potter.”
"True, but we were alone this morning, no strangers to meet," Harry said with a smirk, "And asleep, you didn't even get a show."
"I don't want to hurt her Charlie, I do love her. Being with me is just dangerous, more now than ever. And until it's all done. I just can't be what she deserves."
Harry’s laughter increased. “The world is not ready for the terror George and I would cause, and given the way he flirts with everyone, I’m pretty sure Charlie’s not the marrying type. Really though, I’m more interested in having them all as my family than a spouse. Your family makes me feel warm and loved, and that’s not something I ever had growing up.”
"Fuck. Harry James Potter. Don't you dare stop there. No one's clothes have even come off yet."
"I can do that, Harry. That I can do."
The elder Order members asked about Snape, Hallows, Horcruxes, Malfoys, Death Eaters, Gringotts, dragons, Voldemort, and Dumbledore.
"That conversation got heavy fast," Draco said.
Ron just turns on his heels and walks swiftly from the room.
Ron spoke before Hermione could, "Look, mate, you deserve to be happy. It's easy to see he makes you happy.  This morning threw me for a bit, but I don't have issues with Malfoy anymore, he's different. We're all different. I just want my best mate to smile, and I think he makes you smile.  I won't pretend to understand the two of you regularly bring random men home, but if you're both happy, then I'm happy," Ron said, grasping Harry's shoulder. "Feel free to stop buggering my siblings, though," Ron said with a grimace.
Harry deflated as soon as he saw them. So much for the reprieve.
Harry asked Kreacher to let the rest of the Weasley’s in on the secret so that they could come to the house and finally get some rest.
“I’m sorry, I forgot all your clothes are in the bag,” she said as she opened the bag and started pulling Harry’s clothes from it.
"Yes, please."
“Hush child. You did more than anyone. You and your two friends risked more than any adult wizard I can think of, save a few. The three of you took on challenges that would have overwhelmed most adults. How many witches do you think could have withstood my dear crazy sister Bella’s attentions the way your Ms Granger did? Many fought in this war, many died that shouldn’t have, and many who survived don’t deserve to live. But you listen to me and understand clearly, that there are only five people who are truly responsible for this finally ending.”
Harry nodded. “Good. I’ll call you later when I go to see Mrs Tonks and Teddy. You can help me get his things together, I’m sure after I deliver the news, she is going to be upset for quite a while.”
"Harry, I can apparate and floo through your wards."
“Harry?”
Harry walked back to the Malfoys and relayed Shacklebolt’s message about turning themselves in and the wand. “The wards are down. You can Apparate directly from here. “
Harry starts to speak, but Hermione cuts him off, "Wait, I want to figure this out on my own first." Ron just looks at his wife in horror. "What? C'mon, we can figure it out, Ron. Help me think."
“Confident are we?” Ginny chuckles as she crawls up the bed.
"You're no fun," Harry says with a fake pout. He summons t-shirts for himself, and Draco then heads toward the stairs.
“Oh, yes. Fuck me, Charlie, I want to feel you for days.”
His mouth fits right over her center and begins sucking in earnest. There’s no finesse in his movements, no teasing, he just goes right to what he wants. His nose grazes her clit as he swallows down the mix of their fluids that he’s sucking out of her. When the rush of fluids slows down, Harry pushes his nose harder into her clit. Ginny cries out, “Fuck Harry do that again.”
Charlie bit, pinched, kissed, scratched, and worshiped every inch of my torso. He slowly made his way down, eliciting sounds from me that should have been embarrassing, but I was too far gone to care. I felt utterly wanton. When he made it past my navel, he took the path down one side of my hip, altogether avoiding the place I was so desperate to feel his touch.  I was so hard, my cock was leaking precome and jutting out from my body, begging to be touched. When he reached the place, my hip meets my thigh, he switched to the other side starting at the hip and working his way back in a circle until he met my navel again. I heard myself whine when he sat back on his calves and just looked at me.
Harry just smiled a complex and pained smile. He looked to see that Pipsy was still standing near Snape’s body and watched the exchange with Winky. “Winky and Pipsy, find Kreacher, and he can take you to my home. Will you both hear if I call you?”
"I like seeing you happy. And you make me happy too." Draco reaches for Harry's hand and interlaces their fingers.  Harry pulls their joined hands up, kisses the back of Draco's hand, and then walks them into the kitchen. Hermione and Ron are already at the table in their usual seats. Hermione has already poured tea for herself and Ron, and she's pouring Harry's coffee as they walk into the room.
Charlie looked up with a smirk, “Oh, we’re not nearly done yet, love. That’s just the beginning.”
“Can’t have that now, can we?”
"Works for me. Shirt?"
Harry took off the dressing gown and banished it back to his room. Then he grabbed pants from the pile, pulling them on first. He pulled on a shirt next, but Hermione hadn’t yet pulled jeans out.
In his fifth year, when Harry told Professor McGonagall he wanted to be an Auror, he was sure that was the perfect path for him.
Harry, Fred, and George
"I don't think I've ever realized how close you were to the two of them," said Ron. "But it makes sense.
“Flip,” was the simple command he gave me and I complied without even thinking. Charlie repeated the process down my back, and I melted into a puddle of want and need. When he got to my lower back just before the swell of my arse, he lifted my hips slightly and guided me to my knees. He pushed my head and shoulders back down, flush with the tabletop, and spread my thighs until I started to feel the muscles burn.
"In the beginning, we decided to keep things quiet so we'd have some time to ourselves. It's not like the two of us, hell the four of us, ever have a break from the press. We only wanted to hide it from the world for a bit, not our friends. But the first morning he was here, and you came in, he was in the loo. We decided we didn't want you to find out that way and wanted to tell you both first. Then it sort of became a game to see how long we could keep things under wraps."
“Lose the shoes and get comfy with us,” adds George.
Charlie moved one hand to the back of my neck, and the other slid down my back. The hand on my back continued its path until it was under my pajamas and pants. I could feel the rough pads of his fingers on my arse, and he squeezed. The hand behind my neck canted my head to the side, and he instantly began to devour my throat. Sucking hard enough to mark and cross just to this side of pain, then pulling back and licking slowly soothing the spot he’d just tortured. He nipped my ear, then worked his way down to my collar bone. I didn’t know a collar bone could be erotic but fuck if Charlie didn’t make it so.
“Hmm?”
“So if you find a hot bloke, I’m invited to join?” Ginny says with a laugh.
Harry’s entire body went cold as he realised what Winky was talking about. Objectively, he knew Remus and Tonks had died; he was standing at the feet of Remus, Tonks, and Snape’s bodies. Still, the full force of the situation slammed Harry in the gut as he realised Voldemort had not only orphaned another baby boy, but that this one was Harry’s responsibility. Harry stumbled a step, then sat down on the floor as his head spun. Harry closed his eyes for a moment and allowed himself to process. It only took a moment for him to realise that yes, Teddy was his responsibility now, and yes, he was going to need help, and yes, he was going to do everything in his power to make sure the boy orphaned by Voldemort’s second reign of terror was protected, loved, and cherished in all the ways he hadn’t been.
“I’d like to think so, especially since she so recently lost her husband.” Harry’s eyes went wide, and the ideas formed in his mind.
Harry continued to tell the story of how many ways Snape helped him in his Hogwarts years, starting with his broom in First Year. He covered the cursed ring, and Malfoy’s task, and how Dumbledore manipulated Snape into agreeing to kill him. Harry told of the Astronomy tower, of all the things that happened seventh year, the ways Snape tried to protect the students the best way he could. Then he told them all of how Dumbledore told Snape that Harry had to die, how Harry was a horcrux and that Voldemort himself had to kill him. He told them how much that had infuriated Snape, then he told them how he died.
“Thanks, Kings. For the record, this is the first time since I learned of the Wizarding World that I actually believe the Ministry’s in excellent hands. “
Hermione was casting the healing spell for the fourth pass, and the wound had knitted itself back together.
“Before Bill’s wedding,” Harry said, ducking his head, “I’ll need to let him know now and that you’re okay with it. I promised him that I wouldn’t ever let that night hurt you.”
“We do. You just decide if you like it or not.”
Harry prefers men, but he's not entirely adverse to women. Ginny and Harry parted amicably, and I've seen them check out men together, they usually agree. So if Harry finds Malfoy attractive, it's likely Ginny will too. Thus, both lists.
“Winky is wanting a family, Master Harry. Winky is thanking you.”
Hermione exclaims, "Ron, you can't just ask that."
"Malfoy. Tea. Why?"
“I’m not going to drop you, Harry. You’re safe with me. Well, your virtue isn’t, but I won’t hurt you, I won’t let anyone hurt you,” the gentle way he spoke completely belied the aggression and passion the tryst had contained so far.
The look on her face at his question told Harry he was not going to appreciate her answer, but that she thought it would be hilarious. She waited for Draco to take a sip of his tea before saying, "Sixth year."
Harry laughs loudly, “Merlin, don’t ever let her hear you call her that.”
The laughter dies down into a comfortable silence. After a few minutes, Harry breaks the silence asking, “So when do we get to do that again where I get to take Fred’s spot?”
“Nightcap and a chat with your favorite Weasleys, young Harry,” says Fred.
Harry went back to the Great Hall, found Kingsley, and informed him loudly that his house was now under Fidelus and he’d been smart enough to not use Hermione or Ron as his secret keeper.
"You really want to know?"
“Understatement of the year,” said Ron.
It was well after noon when Harry stepped under the hot spray of a shower to wash the dirt and grime and blood off his body. He knew he must have some injuries because the soap stung in several places, but since the water wasn’t running red, he didn’t stop long enough to look and see what was wrong. Harry dragged himself to his bed, used magic to dry himself and crawled under his blankets without even bothering to dress. Any clothes he had were wherever Hermione had gone with her beaded bag, and Harry saw no reason to hunt her down.
Harry chuckled and made his way to the table. After eating their fill, they made their way into the bathroom and sank down into the hot water. The heat and the potion immediately began relaxing their tense, sore muscles. Both made quick use of washing up, dunking under the water quickly, and washing their hair. After they’d gotten clean, as the bubbles began to dissipate, the pair just sat comfortably and enjoyed the heat and the quiet.
Harry looks at her, “The last thing I feel for you is pity Gin. Shagging you was magnificent, I’d just never shagged a woman before.”
Molly reached out and took Harry’s hand. “You’re a very honourable young man. If there’s anything at all I can help you with, you just let me know.”
He set a rhythm this time of a slow glide out, followed by a fast, hard thrust forward. It wasn’t long until I was begging again,
“One more thing, Draco doesn’t trust the ministry with his wand, so he wants me to keep it for now, but if I don’t give his back, none of them will have a wand, and they’re not exactly high on the public’s most-liked list.”
“What’s that, then?”
Kingsley looked as shocked as Harry felt at finding out they were waiting to be taken into custody. “Do you think they’re really sincere?”
“If you don’t, we stop, finish the firewhiskey and find something else to talk about.”
“We deserve it. Father especially, but all of us. If I want my child to be a part of the world, I have to do what’s right to secure that for him. I’m not my father, I won’t repeat his mistakes. Mother agrees with me. Father’s too broken to argue.”
He looked at me with desire, and it flooded my body with heat. He reached down and ran his hands from my shoulders to my thighs and back again. Sometimes flexing his hands and squeezing gently, other times dragging his nails, hard enough to mark, but ones that would fade, not linger.
“I trust it in your hands more than the Aurors.”
“Oh,” was all Harry could say in response.
Everything became this haze of want and need, and I just gave myself over to the sensations. After a moment, I looked up and met his eyes, “I need to touch you, Charlie, can I touch you?”
Harry snickers at the twins, and takes another drink of whiskey. He lets the warm burn flow down his throat and settles into his belly.
Ginny laughed again, “Come on Harry, you know you want a large family. You won’t want Teddy to be an only child, you’ll want him to have brothers and sisters the way you didn’t. I’m smart enough to know that.”
The muscles in his forearms?  They flexed whenever he moved his hands, and you just knew how fucking secure his arms would feel around you. And his thighs? Merlin Hermione. He was wearing jeans, and they were so fucking tight across his thighs. I couldn't stop staring.  I couldn't stop imagining how hard he could take me with legs that strong. Oh my. I was so distracted. And I was trashed. I handed him the bottle and turned to look up at his face. His hand brushed over mine on the bottle, I felt the roughness of his hands, and I was done. I just leaned over and kissed him."
“No virtues to worry about Charlie, that ship sailed.”
He obliges twice and then focuses on taking her apart with his lips, teeth, and tongue. Harry keeps up a steady pace of licking, sucking, nipping. Ginny is trying to squirm, but Harry’s hands are clamped on her and restricting her movement. He’s grasping hard enough that she knows she’ll be bruised in the morning, but knows she’ll wear those marks with fond thoughts of a fun time had. Harry has been alternating pressure and speeds this whole time, not allowing Ginny to ever push over that final edge. She’s so close, and it’s driving her crazy. “Please, Harry please. Let me come, I need to come now.”
“You’re knackered,” he said with a smile. “Get some rest, I’ll take care of everything.”
Charlie’s cock was a work of art, and I knew that I’d be wordless again after he pounded into me with it, I knew that I’d still be feeling him for the next few days, no matter how well I’d been prepared. Charlie’s cock was thick, nearly twice as thick around as the ones I’d experienced before. Where the twins were long, longer than mine, though a bit thinner, with a slight curve, Charlie’s was shorter, about the same length as mine, but it was thick and stood straight out from his body. I licked my lips in anticipation, and Charlie smiled. “Like what you see, love?”
"Morning, Harry, Draco." Hermione's already floating a giant mug of coffee in front of Harry. "Tea Draco?"
George lays down on his back on the rug and throws a glance at Fred, “Help him over here, I want to suck your come from him.”
The two sat and looked at each other.  Harry didn't know where to start, so he just sat patiently for a few moments. After a time, he decided to just jump right into the issue. He said, “You don’t want me to raise Teddy, do you?”
“Stop. You aren’t being selfish, and when is my plate ever empty, anyway? You’re right, you didn’t commit to Teddy, I did. I’m not asking you to become a mother at sixteen Gin, but I’d really like you to be an Aunt. I don’t want to lose you in my life, and your family is my family. A family I want Teddy to know too.”
“Minister, do you really want to be involved?” asked Ron. Ron’s tone of voice clarified that he meant that their friend Kingsley would be more than welcome at Grimmauld, but that maybe it would be best if the Minister for Magic had nothing to do with hiding Harry Potter from the world.
“Let’s try something else I think you’ll enjoy this just as much,” says George.
“Then why did w-?”
“Sleep, eat, long soak in a hot bath, repeat?” Harry counters.
“So essentially what you’re telling me is you’ve come to help me solve my problems, but none of my problems are ones you can solve.”
“Why?” Harry asked, clearly confused.
I woke the next morning back in Ron’s room, and for a moment, I was sure it was a dream. I rolled to my side to reach for my glasses. I could feel the twinge of soreness from our activities and saw a vial with a note next to my glasses. I knew then I wasn’t imagining, and it had happened. The next thing I registered was the pounding headache that came with drinking a half bottle of firewhiskey. I picked up the vial and looked at the note.
The lubed finger he slid into me was shocking, but only because I wasn’t expecting it. He had relaxed my muscles so much that his finger slid in easily. It wasn’t long before a second finger pressed in to join the first, then I felt a warm mouth close over my balls as he sucked one into his mouth. He hummed around my balls as he scissored the fingers in my arse. The vibrations of his mouth and his fingers’ movement sent a jolt of lust straight to my cock. I was panting by this point, continually making noises I can’t even explain.
“Alright, fine,” Harry says, standing up and turning to where the back of his thighs was facing Hermione.
The twin under him slides out and comes around to Harry’s front. Harry’s too far gone to figure out which twin it is, but he hears him look down at Harry and ask, “Want to keep going?”
“Yeah, look, we don’t fancy you ya, speccy git.”
Harry swallows, nervously looks up to Fred, and says, “Yeah. Alright.”
Harry just nods. Fred asks, “More?” to which Harry replies, “Yeah. Please.” The twins share a grin with each other, then both move toward Harry.  Fred moves around to Harry’s back, while George moves in front of him. George initiates a passionate kiss with Harry, and Fred leans in pressing kisses along the side of Harry’s neck, from behind.
I hope you enjoy the story and the new additions.
Gin reads his reactions and body with skill, and it doesn’t take long before she’s milking his second orgasm of the day out of him.
"Good. I didn't think you'd string her along, but I needed to be sure."
“Master Harry must be waking now. It’s time for breakfast, and you must be eating.”
“Otherwise, you’ll be waiting till after bloody Voldemort bites it.”
He called for Kreacher. Then Teddy began crying. “Kreacher, time to eat.” Harry scooped up the infant from the crib and called Winky to bring a bottle for Teddy down to the kitchen.
Ginny let go of Harry’s hands and put hers on either side of his face. She tilted his head until he could meet her eyes, though he hadn’t. “Look at me,” she said gently. Harry slowly met her eyes.
Draco winced, “I’ve never met her, but I know she never stopped being my mother’s favourite sister. The house-elves keep their correspondence hidden from anyone else finding out about it.”
Harry reached out and pulled Ginny into a hug. “Thank you,” he whispered in her ear. “I’m lucky to have you.” He pulled back from the hug and pressed a kiss to her forehead before breaking the muffling charm and heading to check on Hermione.
“Are you not able?” Harry asked, worried that his plan wouldn’t work for some magical reason.
Harry kicks off his shoes, drops the cloak and map on top of them and sits down cross-legged on the rug between the two of them. “What are we chatting about?” Harry asks, grabbing a cushion to hug to his chest.
In his seventh year, while hunting Horcruxes and running from Death Eaters, Harry started wondering if he really wanted to do this for the rest of his life.
Winky arrived and handed over a burp rag and a bottle to Harry. Harry threw the rag over his shoulder, tucked Teddy into his left arm, and began feeding him a bottle. Once Teddy began drinking, Harry held the bottle steady with magic and started eating his own breakfast.
“Almost there, Harry, just hold on.” The fingers are removed, and Harry feels cold slick lube quickly rubbed around his opening. He feels a blunt pressure as Fred starts to push the head of his cock past the tight ring of muscle. Once his head pops through the resistance, Harry gasps, but doesn’t let go of George.
By the time this was done, and he heads back into the bedroom, Kreacher appears with food. Kreacher set the tray down on a small table near the window and left Harry and Ginny alone. Harry crawled over to the bed and pulled back the covers. He woke Ginny by covering her with kisses and light nips along her exposed skin. She woke with a happy groan and slowly opened her eyes to look at Harry. “Hello, handsome.”
“Well, sixth year, I had a feeling I might fancy blokes, and I already knew I fancied you. But there was so much going on, and I didn’t have time to experiment like a normal teenager. And the twins offered themselves as test subjects.”
Harry’s knocking had woken Teddy, and Harry could hear him crying through the door. He was in Andromeda’s arms when she answered the door, and by the look on her face, she was already guessing that whatever news was being brought to her by Harry Potter and Narcissa Malfoy at this time of the day would not be good news.
"Of course, it's possible. What kind of hack Potions Master do you take me for?" Harry laughs as breakfast appears in front of everyone. "Don't you dare tell Severus' portrait though, I'll never hear the end of it."
She just laughed at him. “You know we’re back to civilization, don’t get too cheeky, or I’ll make you go to St. Mungo’s and brave the press every time you get hurt.”
My quick burst of laughter made my head throb and startled Ron, who rolled over and went right back to sleep. I downed the potion quickly and felt the immediate relief. I lay back down on my pillow and took stock of myself for a few moments. I realized that for the first time since Dumbledore told me about the Horcruxes, the tension was gone from my shoulders, and I felt the beginnings of hope. I felt like we could do this, that we were going to get through it all somehow, that maybe, just maybe, our dumb luck would pull us through once again.
Harry was a little shocked that Narcissa knew it was his home.
Harry replied quickly, “No! I promised I wouldn’t, and I didn’t hide anything. I mean, I have a scratch ‘Mione, from sliding off the dragon. It’s not even bleeding, I’m fine.”
“Merlin, Fred, George, and Charlie??  Harry Potter, you slag you.”
“I’ll try to make this quick, Harry, but there are some things that need clearing up first,” Kingsley said as he took a seat.
Harry nodded and had barely begun to squat back down when Winky ran over and began speaking quickly.
~O^O~
"Potter.  Why am I being stared at by a Weasley that's wearing bright orange pajamas?" Harry hears Draco drawl in his calm pretentious voice.
This was one of the first rooms he had completely remodeled when he decided to permanently live at Grimmauld Place. Harry had installed a massive bathtub. It wasn’t as large as the Prefects bath, but it would hold four people quite comfortably. He had several different taps installed as well.
“Hush Harry, I’m not upset. Curious and amused, but not upset.”
Harry sighs. "Sixth year was rough for me. I was dealing with the guilt of Sirius. I was basically stalking Draco, and you both kept pointing out that I was obsessed with him, but I knew I had feelings for Ginny. That was confusing, and I wasn't sure of anything. Life felt like it was falling apart. Dumbledore had just dumped the weight of the world on my shoulders. I was a mess."
P.S. Your name is Harry Potter.
“But they can’t have expected you to take him this young, and it’s not like Mrs Tonk’s is going to hurt him—” continued Ginny.
“Show me.” Hermione said in her tone that brokered no arguing.
Ginny chuckles at his obvious arousal but sets a steady pace dancing her body above him. The lack of shame, and ease of movement, tells Harry this isn’t the first time she’s done this. He expected to be jealous, but he’s genuinely happy she’s experienced enough to make this very good for him. He’s not complaining about the way she’s making him feel.
“Has something happened to Mrs Granger? What would upset Hermione that much?” asked Bill.
Ginny looked decidedly uncomfortable. She stayed for a few moments after Harry finished speaking, but when Arthur asked about the Elder wand, she stood from the table and left the room. Hermione’s eyes had filled with tears when Harry mentioned Mrs Granger, and when Ginny left the kitchen, Hermione looked at Harry and said, “I’ll go check on her.”
"I'm not having breakfast with the Undersecretary to the Minister while shirtless Harry Potter."
“How can I help you, sir?” asked the tiny elf.
He knew when he soothed her back to sleep after she woke from nightmares of the torture she’d endured.
“Makes sense. Most of my thoughts since the Battle have been along the lines of ‘What do I have to do next?’ but I keep reminding myself, I don’t HAVE to do anything. Sure there’s things I should do, but I don’t have anyone running my life anymore but me. Where’s that leave us, Gin?”
Bill’s eyes went wide, and Charlie burst out laughing, “This I’ve got to hear.”
He pulls on her thighs, guiding her towards his face, “Get up here and let me lick my come out of you until you come so hard, your thighs shake.”
"Yes, yes, Hermione's brilliant. I'm not arguing that. But how?"
Hermione waves her wand and a new cup of tea pours itself, the proper amount of milk and sugar is stirred in, then the cup floats directly in front of him, waiting patiently for him to grab it from the air.
Harry sighed, “We needed to get to Hogwarts before Voldemort did. It didn’t seem like a big deal. It just felt like a scratch. I wasn’t hiding it, Hermione, I promise.”
"There was never any romantic attachment with them, we never dated or anything of the like. But the twins helped me in ways the two of you couldn't. The three of us were in the war together, from the beginning to the end. I mean, we became friends trying to escape a Mountain Troll at the age of eleven for Merlin's sake. We were never going to be typical. The twins were touched by the war too, but they were still mostly carefree. They were able to be my friends, without all the baggage and weight.  I could feel like a normal kid when I hung out with them, even if it were only for a few minutes."
“Of course we can, Harry. You don’t want me to come with you?”
“Doesn’t mean we can’t have a bit of fun and see if you like it.”
It all just flowed from me. Everything.  My fear of failing everyone. About worrying about getting someone in his family killed, getting you killed. The guilt of Sirius, Dumbledore, all of the deaths.  The anger about Snape taking Dumbledore from me. This job that Dumbledore dumped on a 16-year old that I didn't fucking even know where to start with.  That I had to solve the mystery, or people were going to keep dying until I lost everyone. Charlie put one arm around my shoulder and pulled me into his side.  We stopped talking at that point for a minute and just passed the bottle back and forth a few more times."
"The twins.  I know you were holding back details for Ron's delicate sensibilities, but I need to know.  Together? Like together together?"
Draco smiles at Harry, "Of course love. Whatever you want."
Harry looks at Draco to see the amused look on his face while his oldest friends are thinking. Draco mouths, "Hermione," at Harry to which Harry mouths back, "Ron."
Hermione smiles, and Ron speaks for the first time since he arrived in their room upstairs.
"When Draco started spending the night, I turn the arrival alert back on. I don't use it because I don't worry about the two of you being in my house while I'm vulnerable, and no one else has access. The alert gives Draco time to head out, or get under my cloak before you made it up the stairs."
Harry opens his mouth to ask, but the tongue that’s still teasing his ass suddenly pushes inside his opening, he gasps then chokes out, “Yes. More.”
“Master Harry, Winky has stopped drinking, and Winky is needing a family. House-elves is saying Master Harry is to be having a baby and Winky is good with babies, Master Harry. Winky will take good care of Master Harry’s baby.”
Harry and Ginny finally shag for the first time about a month after the Battle. Before it happens, they talk about this being a “test run” so to speak. They’re not jumping back into a relationship, but they’re both curious about their chemistry. And they both recognize the pent up need they both seem to be carrying.
“Is there any Dreamless Sleep left?” Harry asked.
George reaches out for his wand, he quickly transfigures three of the cushions into pillows, and one into a blanket. He throws the blanket over the three of them. Harry rolls onto his side, throwing a leg over George and snuggling into his side. Fred slides behind Harry, spooning him. George’s arm is under Harry and Fred’s heads, and Fred’s arm reaches past Harry to rest on his brother’s hip. Warm, safe, and sated, Harry drifts off to sleep.
“Just who we were looking for. Have a seat, Potter. Granger and Weasley, you too.” McGonagall said as she transfigured seating for the five of them. Both older members of the Order looked as exhausted as Harry felt.
"Why hide, though? It's not like Malfoy, and I haven't worked through most of our issues by now. Do you still not trust me to react well?"
Hermione and Harry were laughing so hard tears were in both their eyes when Draco and Ron finished their chess game.
“That lot defending your honor is not quite the kind of aggression I’d enjoy, Gin.”
“Teddy is one child, one, no one said anything about siblings.”
McGonagall nodded, “If anything changes, reach out, Potter. I’ll do what I can.”
“Sleep, eat, repeat?” Gin asks with a wicked grin.
Harry calls for Kreacher and asks for breakfast to be served.
“Yes, Master Harry.” Winky said with a nod, then she turned to Pipsy, and the two popped away together.
"Both. I like both."
“I was just wondering how long he’s staying with you?”
Charlie chuckled at their disbelief. “Well, at least a little.”
Harry stopped and thought for a few moments. “You’re probably right, Gin, but it’s not something I’m going to think about now. Raising one will be hard enough. I know I said it all with confidence, but—” Harry’s voice dropped to a whisper, and his eyes lowered to his lap, “I’m scared I’ll screw it up, screw him up.”
Charlie started to slide his arms up my back under my shirt, and I lifted my hands so he could remove it. He tossed the shirt to the ground, then pulled me into his chest and started kissing me. He raised both hands and put them on either side of my head so he could hold me still while he attacked my mouth. First, it was long slow strokes of his tongue, then small nips up my jaw. He returned to my mouth this time with passionate brutal kisses that left me panting when he finally pulled back.
"Harry, I think you broke your friend," Draco snickers.
Ron laughed, “He’s right ‘Mione, even furious at him you wouldn’t do that.”
She took the dropper of Dittany and dropped the potion over the newly healed cut, then rubbed it into Harry’s skin.
“A bit, but I think we can help you figure one problem, Harry.”
Harry just smiled. "Does nothing get past you, Hermione?"
"Where's the fun in that? I've been waiting for today for a long time," Hermione said, looking very pleased with herself.  Ron just scowled at his wife and turned back to his food.
Hermione looked at him with a sheepish grin, “I already checked the Black library, there’s nothing useful. I planned to owl order later today.”
"Er. Thanks," Ron said as he ate the strawberry.
“If you only have experience with Muggle babies, how did you know the spell to hold his bottle?” asked Percy.
"Sounds perfect."
“Aunt Andi?” said Draco.
The twins laugh again. “Let's nap a bit and see what happens when we wake up.”
Harry was outspoken about Snape, his role, about how he had never been who they all thought he was. Harry let both McGonagall and Shacklebolt know in no uncertain terms that he wouldn’t rest until Snape’s name was cleared, and by the end of the conversation, Harry received commitments from them both to help Harry with that task.
“Bring four, please, Pipsy.”
“That works too,” Ron said with a chuckle as he lined up the knife with Harry’s wound.
Harry laughs, "It's okay 'Mione. He can ask, though he can probably figure it out on his own if he thinks about it."
Harry snickers, "Be thankful it's not one of the Weasleys who'd have crawled in here with us."
Harry looked down at Teddy in his arms with a fond smile. “But helping the babies wasn’t punishment. It was nice to care for someone who needed help to survive, I let her think I hated it, but I never did.” Harry pressed a kiss on Teddy’s forehead. “Teddy’s only two weeks old, he’s the youngest infant I’ve ever held. I’m sure Winky will have a lot to teach me, and I know ‘Mione will find me lots of books to read on things like child development and child safety.” Harry turned to Hermione with a smirk.
“No, Cissa. Say no more. I know it, but I don’t want to hear it out loud. Not now. Please?” begged Andi. Distress and pain shown on her face and in her voice.
When I did that, he bit hard enough to make me cry out, and the pain turned to pleasure immediately, and I thrust my hips against him, desperately searching for friction. I started begging, “Please, Charlie. Please.” though I couldn’t have verbalized precisely what I was asking for. “More. Need more.”
“Harry, that’s not going to happen. We’ll always be in each other’s life. I cant imagine Mum letting either of us miss too much family time,” Gin says with a laugh. “And I don’t know about you, but I’m definitely not against the idea of jumping into bed casually as long as we’re single at the time.”
Ron's face turns bright red.
“Potter.”
“Kinda, I mean, I still think Lucius is a piece of shite, but I think Narcissa and Draco actually regret their behaviour, and both have saved my life. Neither wanted Voldemort to win, not really. Plus, they have no future if they run or resist, and they know it,” replied Harry.
"Oh, yes.  Please feel free to use many details," Hermione said with a grin.
“No. I don’t want to talk. There is no news being brought by the two of you together that can be good news.”
-------
Draco rolls his eyes, "Fuck his sensibilities, I'm getting up anyway," he says as he throws the last bit of sheet off him and stands up and heads off to the loo.
Gin sits up straight, pushing Harry’s shoulders down to the mattress and guiding his hands to rest gently on her thighs. “Lay back and enjoy Harry. Let me take care of you this time,” Ginny says as she begins to move above him.
"I like it when you give me everything I want," Harry pulls Draco's lips back to his and apparates them directly outside the kitchen door.
Harry knew there would be questions he had to answer, but he also knew there were things he didn’t want to share and things he shouldn’t even if he’d wanted to. “I’ll answer what I can, Minister.”
“Gin, can we talk?” Harry asked, nodding his head towards the corner of the room. Ron stepped towards the two girls and helped Hermione to sit up, then pulled her into his arms in a hug. Ginny stood from the bed and followed Harry towards the chair in the corner. Harry pointed for Ginny to take the chair, and he sat on the ottoman. He cast a Muffliato around them so they wouldn’t disturb Hermione. “She’s got enough on her mind,” Harry said as a way of explanation.
“Plus, let’s be honest, who else isn’t going straight to the press?”
“I’m his godfather and his parents are dead. Why wouldn’t I?”
Harry laughed. “Everything that’s happened, and that’s your first question, Gin?”
“You love me far too much to give me over to the public.” Harry said with a genuine smile beaming out from his face.
Ginny began, “Why was Ron starting a fire in a floating bowl?”
“Harry, you’re fit.  And you’re passionate about everything. Shagging, you was bound to be fun. I’m sure Fred and George figured that out.  Volunteering to help you wasn’t a hardship.”
“Only men. No women, Gin and I haven’t crossed that line, I won’t hurt her that way.”
He stopped walking, pulled back, and looked at me quizzically. “With a man too?”
"We ended up in the Room of Requirement with a bottle of firewhiskey and a whole bunch of questions. They made me an offer to see what I really thought about boys, in a safe situation, with people I trust, who'd never go to the press, and who'd never make me feel bad about myself whatever the outcome."
He pushed my back up to the wall, then used his hands to pull my arse cheeks apart and lowered me slowly back onto his cock.
Narcissa rose from her kneeling position and helped Andi to her feet. “Go home and rest, Harry. All will be fine in time. I will stay with my sister.”
Harry panics, sitting straight up in the bed, “Fuck Gin, I didn’t mean to tell you like that.” Harry looks like he’s about to bolt from the bed.
“Thanks’ Mione,” he said, pressing a quick kiss to her cheek and squeezing Ron’s bicep. “See you both in the morning.”
“Mmmm,” Gin said as she slowly rolled to the mattress’s side and slid her bare feet to the floor. She quickly walked over to the table, taking a seat and opening the trays to see what had been brought for them. Gin was so comfortable in her skin, Harry just looked at her with awe.
Harry and Hermione speak together, “Injury?” Harry didn’t know what Bill was referring to.
Ginny snickered. “I bet they did”
“I’m sure you’ve all got questions, we’ll answer what we can while we eat.” said Harry as he left the drawing-room.
The sound that comes from Harry’s mouth isn’t a word, and he doesn’t know how to describe it either. Harry has enough presence of mind to realize that one of the twins is under him, giving him one hell of a blow job, while the other is attacking his arse with his mouth and tongue. The only thing that Harry can think right now is that he’s pretty sure he likes blokes now.
Hermione broke the tension, "Do tell us about Charlie now Harry. I'm sure that story will be both hot and uplifting."
It had the desired effect, because Harry’s face broke out into a huge grin. “I came up here to make you feel better and to check on Hermione, and somehow you end up comforting me. Thanks Gin, I needed to hear that.”
“Actually, Narcissa can’t access us, but she knows where the house is and that we’re living in it. No reason to stop being vigilant. Though I don’t think we have anything to fear from her,” interjected Harry.
Ron spluttered. "Harry James Potter, I can't believe you'd violate someone's privacy like that!"
The twins just grin back at him with giant smiles across their faces.
"Of course. You know, I'll tell you anything."
“Wait, this wasn’t recently?”
Harry looked up and saw the Malfoys seated alone at a table, so he walked in their direction. All three Malfoys looked defeated. “I’d like to speak with you alone a moment, Mrs Malfoy.”
Ron's face lost all its color. "I just realized what you were talking about up there. Merlin. Which Weasleys would have climbed in the bed, Harry? Just how many Weasley's have you buggered?"
“I hope I can keep it that way, Harry.”
"That's all we want for you, Harry," Hermione said.
Harry had finished eating, and Teddy had finished his bottle and begun crying. Harry stood up and began pacing and rocking Teddy to soothe him while he told the story of Severus Snape and his friend Lily Evans. He told his family of Snape’s childhood and then how his father and Sirius treated him throughout Hogwarts. He explained Snape’s fatal mistake of calling Lily a mudblood, of the man’s immediate desire to take it back, and how no matter how many times he tried to apologise, Lily wouldn’t hear it.
“That would be new,” said Harry with a chuckle.
“Um.”
“And two of us means twice the fun if you like it.”
It was my turn to chuckle. “That’s true. Is the Q&A part of the evening over now? Not that I’m complaining about you holding me here like this. It’s rather warm and safe, but I believe you promised to make me forget that I’m Harry Potter, and right now, I still know my name.”
"Oi. Ron.  Go back to the kitchen, we'll be down in a minute."
Two years later, when he reflected on the decision he made during the time he spent at Bill and Fleur’s, Harry realised that he had found that better way without much effort.
"I still don't understand. That was two months ago, so if they've been together, how come I keep finding other men in his bed on Sundays, but never him?"
"Feed me Potter, and I'll consider taking the time to develop a whole new formula just to appease your delicate taste buds."
“Fucking nightmares,” he said, then he sighed. He checked the time, and only an hour had passed. He so desperately needed sleep. And that meant he needed a potion. He called for Pipsy, who appeared standing next to him on the bed with a very subtle pop.
Harry lets out a breath he doesn’t even realize he’d been holding. “I don’t understand why I feel relieved by that answer.  I know I love you, and I sure as fuck desire you, but your answer made me feel relief.”
When the questions ended, and Harry, Hermione, and Ron looked as if they planned to fall asleep where they sat, Kingsley asked Harry if there was a safe place for him to stay. McGonagall planned to allow anyone who needed lodging to remain in the castle, the undamaged parts at least, but no one thought it would be wise for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to stay in such an accessible area.
"At least I was sure you knew this one's name," Ron says with a snicker.
"Works for me Weasley, I've heard the story already. Watched it in a Pensieve actually."
Draco took the wand from Harry and nodded as he turned to walk back to his seat next to his mother. “I have one thing to do before I come back for you, Mrs Malfoy. I won’t be long.” She bowed her head in acknowledgement again, and Harry walked away.
"It was the night of my seventeenth birthday dinner. That noise we heard downstairs before we tucked in was Charlie.  After Ron started snoring, I couldn't fall asleep, so I went downstairs. Charlie was in the kitchen with a glass of firewhiskey.  He poured me one.  We talked then, the first time we actually talked properly y' know. The talking wasn't deep.  We talked quidditch or dragons. Nothing heavy. It got a bit quiet, then I looked up and made eye contact with Charlie and told him I was scared to fucking death of failing everyone. We'd gotten about halfway through the bottle at this point, and then we heard a noise on the stairs.  Charlie grabbed my hand, and we went to Arthur's shed so we could finish talking."
"Show off."
"I'm glad that's how you feel.  I also see that you're going to break down soon if you don't find an outlet for all the pressure these so-called grown-ups are putting on you. It's your call, Harry. Tell me what you want."
Harry doesn’t hesitate, he just rolls over and gets into the position as he was told. He hears two separate groans before he feels four hands rubbing along his body. He’s not sure who moves behind him, but he feels a set of hands pulling his arse cheeks apart, and before he can blush from the embarrassment he feels a wet tongue lick between his cheeks. Harry gasps in a mouthful of air and expels a whimper. Harry hears shuffling but has no idea what’s going on behind him. He’s overwhelmed with the feeling of the tongue that’s attacking his hole repeatedly. And then suddenly, his cock is being engulfed inside the wet heat of a mouth from below him.
“But, you have to talk Harry.”
“I automatically became your bonded elf when Master Severus died,” spoke Pipsy.
“See. Masochist.” Harry rolled his eyes at Ron’s response.
Ron gets there first, "Charlie, Ginny, Fred, and George. Then Charlie, Ginny, and Bill."
“More like relentless,” Harry says, pulling a second pillow under his head.
"Recently, Hermione. Recently." Harry said with a laugh, "When'd you figure it out?"
“Set him up in the drawing-room for now until we get the house figured out tomorrow.” He turned to Andi, “You can come with us. I’ve enough room and Teddy deserves you to be safe as well.”
“It’s not,” started Harry, but Hermione interrupted and demanded to see the injury herself.
“That you were,” Harry says with a grin. “What are we going to tell everyone else?”
“I’ll meet you at home after I’ve helped Mr Potter with his next arduous task of the evening,” said Narcissa.
"If you want a night to forget about it all. I'll give you that. I can make your body sing, and you can forget your name, if only for a bit. But you can never hurt my sister with this, Harry."
“You’re amazing, Gin. That’s all.”
The three made small talk for a few moments before Hermione said, “Harry, what exactly are you wearing?”
Ginny laughs, then snickers. “I think you’d rather enjoy being attacked by MOST of my older brothers.”
For the next few minutes, the only thing Harry knows is he’s being held still by his hips and head, and the slide of the cock up his arse matches the slide of the one in his mouth. Every nerve ending is on fire, and his entire body feels like a ball of want.
Ginny sighed, she turned from Harry’s gaze for a moment, then turned back to face him. She sat forward in the chair and took his hands in hers. “Harry, I understand you believe you have to raise Teddy. I even respect your reasons. But I didn’t agree to be his godmother, or his mum. I don’t want to be a parent at sixteen. I’m not sure I’ll want to be a parent at twenty-five.”
Ron’s eyebrows rose, and Harry simply mouthed, “Later.” Then to the table he added, Ron added, “Hermione even found a spell to keep our hair and skin from shedding until we shower.”
Harry smiled, “I appreciate that more than you know Molly. You and Mrs Granger are the best examples of a mother that I know. I’d be happy if Teddy grows up as loved as your children are.”
“Up you get Gin, I prepared us a bath, and Kreacher’s brought food.”
“You plan to raise him yourself?” asked Molly
“I’ll hold it for you and return it personally. It’ll never be logged into custody.”
“Easy there, mate,” Fred says with a chuckle.
"Sounds good, love. Bath?"
“No one hears a word from us.”
Everyone talked at once, which immediately overwhelmed Harry. Hermione noticed and spoke up, “How about we go in a circle for questions?”
“It’s that simple?”
"In all seriousness guys, Draco and I are open about our sex life, but I want you both to know it is more than that. I do love him.  I didn't expect to, but that's probably how it happened. He's funny and smart, he understands my baggage, my nightmares, my disdain for the press, he could care less about my name and doesn't need my money. We fit." Harry softened his voice and looked up at his best friends, "He loves me too, you know."
Ron manages to make a "meep" sound and turns his head.
“I’m going to come back in a few moments and borrow your mother for a moment to help me deliver bad news.”
Ron still stands frozen.
Harry burst out laughing. "Hankering for a visit to Romania?"
“I was hoping to take the Weasley’s back to Grimmauld Place with me, but the Fidelus is broken, and I’m sure the Death Eaters know its location,” said Harry with a fair bit of annoyance. All they’d done and been through, and his own home was still off-limits. It was frustrating.
Kingsley chuckled. “I think you’re likely to be on the good side for quite some time. So maybe I can hold on to the Ministry, and there can finally be some positive changes made.”
“Definitely. I enjoyed sex with you, we can repeat that at any time.”
"It's not the first time you've shown up for Sunday breakfast to naked men in my bed," Harry says with a laugh.
Gin knows now, by the way. Just so you know, it's not a secret. Harry laughs.
Harry furrowed his brows. “I didn’t use a spell. I just kind of propped it up with a little magic and told it to stay.”
“Kreacher is, but wizards do not consider elves for such tasks.”
Harry turned back to Narcissa. “If you’re ready. I’ve no idea how to break this news. I appreciate you joining me.”
Charlie laughs at that, “Oh please don’t apologise. The view was lovely. Wait, you said the three of you, does that mean Hermione is used to seeing you naked, Harry?” Charlie said with a raised eyebrow.
Both Hermione and Ron nod. "Good enough. And the twins?"
Harry nodded, and Ron cut again.
“How can I help you, Mr Potter?” Narcissa asked, her tone sounding so genuinely respectful it shocked Harry for a moment, and he forgot what he had wanted to say to her.
“I’ll be back as soon as I can, then I just want a shower and a bed,” Harry said as the exhaustion set in again.
“And women,” Harry says quickly, cutting her off, “Both, I like both.”
Harry just nodded. “So you don’t think we should get back together then.”
“I never expected you’d return it,” Draco said with a tone of surprise. “But if you’re serious about giving it back, would you be willing to hang on to it for a while longer?”
"He's the strategist 'Mione. You're observations and spells, Ron strategizes our information, then I execute.  That's how we work."
“That you will. Your tight little arse is going to feel so good as I stretch it open around my cock. Then once I’m inside you, I’m going to fuck you until you come again for me, and I’m going to keep fucking you until I’m done.”
I slumped bonelessly back to the table, took a few panting breaths then managed to say, “That was bloody fucking amazing.”
“’ New Harry’ has a fascinating mind,” Gin says, running her nails down Harry’s chest.
“You don’t owe me anything, Potter. I owe you everything, and not just for the times you saved my life directly. He’s gone, and I’ve never been more thankful for anything in my life.”
The little elf’s diction was a shock to Harry, and he sat on the ground rather than continue squatting. “Were you educated by Snape?” Harry asked, curiosity evident in his tone.
“What’s all this guys?” Harry asks as he walks into the room.
Lucius and Draco looked as if they wanted to speak, but she gently put her hand on Draco’s shoulder and Lucius’ leg and stood. Harry took a few steps back, and Narcissa walked to join him. He cast a spell around them so that no one else could hear the conversation.
“What?” She asked as she noticed the silly look on Harry’s face.
“It happens sometimes. Look, everyone will be here shortly, and I still need to go see Andromeda and Teddy. Can you handle settling everyone in?”
Harry sits up on his elbows to uncork and drink his potion.  The relief is immediate.  His headache is gone, his nausea is gone, and his energy returned. "Ugh. That's vile. Why do you insist on making them taste like licorice?"
He leaned us forward from the wall and used the hand on my neck to pull his shirt over his head in one movement. He never stopped grasping my ass, leaving the shirt hanging from his wrist. He leaned back against the wall, and this time when he pulled me forward, he changed the angle I was sitting at so he could reach my nipples. My hands were on his shoulders, and I immediately began running my hands over the muscles in his shoulders and upper back. I slid my hands up his neck and into his hair, newly shorn, and ran my nails over his scalp.
“I’m not shocked you shagged Charlie. But his conquests and adventures have always been gossip between the siblings, I’m shocked he kept it secret.”
"Morning 'Mione," Harry says with sickening cheer. Harry stops to plant a kiss on her hair before heading to his seat.
He didn’t bob up and down on my cock like I thought he would, he just slid all the way down my shaft until his nose was flush against my abdomen and his chin against my balls and sucked. I could feel his throat pulsing around me, and his fingers inside me began to rub faster and harder. I knew I was going to come, so I put my hands in his hair as a warning, getting ready to pull him off, but he pushed down even farther. It wasn’t long, and I was coming, shooting my load straight down his throat.
“He’s home, thanks to Harry.”
Hermione went from amused to furious, “Harry James Potter, are you hiding injuries again?”
-------
Ginny’s eyes went wide.
“Sold Harry,” she says, sliding off his lap, allowing them to slide down onto the bed. Harry waves his hand, casting a nonverbal cleaning charm over both of them before getting comfortable on his pillow. He reaches out, pulling Ginny into him. She rolls toward him, throwing a leg over his and putting her head on his shoulder. Her arm rests across his chest, his arm holds her to his side, as they both drift off to sleep.
“Are you close?”
“Lots of dark magic can use blood, skin, or hair, so we’re super careful to not leave any biological matter of Harry’s — all of us, really — anywhere for someone to find. It’s unnecessary in this house because I restricted access to only trustworthy people, but it’s habit for all of us now.”
"That was two months ago 'Mione, why didn't you warn me?"
After the two girls had left the room, Harry made eye contact with Ron and they both sighed. Arthur asked what had just happened.
He never got to go up to Gryffindor tower to sleep like he wished, though he did, at least, get his sandwiches. The food helped, but the nap would have been better. It would be another five hours before Harry would get to Grimmauld Place and finally have the chance to clean up, sleep, get his injuries healed, and fill the Weasley’s in on all the things that happened while the Trio had been gone.
"I was the silent investor in their shop, so the twins and I owled regularly about the business. One of the letters I sent back made them worry about me, so they snuck into the castle through the Shack to check on me."
Harry laughed then turned around to see that the rest of the Weasley’s had joined Bill, Fleur, and Charlie.
“Anything you want mate.”
“Weasley prowess a point of pride?” I said with a hint of sarcasm.
Harry nods, "Four already have, three are willing." Both sets of eyes across the table from Harry go wide, and he can see the thinking going through both of their brains.
Bill, who looked very interested in the spell, replied, “That’s bloody brilliant. You’ll have to teach me that one.”
Narcissa guided Andromeda to sit next to Harry, then she sunk to her knees in front of her sister, holding both her hands gently.
When her expression turned devious, Harry interrupted, “Not that, that’s already a given, I mean with us. Out of bed. I think we’ve established we have chemistry, but do you want to get back into a relationship?”
"It's your fault," Harry laughs, "You make me giddy like a teenager. I like being happy."
Charlie walked us over to one of the tables that Arthur collected his trinkets on. He pulled his wand and levitated all of the items to one of the other tables in the room. He cast a cushioning charm then set me down on top of the table that felt like sinking into a mattress.
Ron took up the story, “Griphook left us as soon as he got the Sword of Gryffindor. The Flagrante and Gemino curses on the gold in the vault. The guards were coming for us and we had no way out. We were barely holding the guards off and yelling at each other for ideas, when Hermione came up with her mad plan. She blasted the bannister, then ran and jumped on the dragon. Harry and I followed, then ‘Mione blasted the chain holding it and we flew up and out through the roof.”
Ron answers before Harry can, “Don’t stir up trouble, Charlie. After the close quarters of the past year, none of us has any modesty left with each other.”
"Your potions definitely work better. The apothecary's potions are crap even if they do taste better."
Charlie just barked out a laugh and shook his head, “Well at least I can assume that went well for you.”
"Six 'Mione. Six. I am not on either list, nor will I ever be."
Those weeks at Shell Cottage were when Harry knew that the moment Voldemort was in the ground for good — provided he survived it — he would find a better way to spend the rest of his life. He had no clue what that would be, but he was determined not to be satisfied until he figured it out.
All the Weasleys were watching the trio with varying kinds of interest. He sighed, realising that they had so much they were going to have to explain.
“Andi, we need to talk.”
When Pipsy apparated away, Harry called for Kreacher and asked for dry sheets, then drug himself to the bathroom and splashed cold water on his face. Pipsy returned as Harry was climbing back into the now dry bed. She handed Harry a vial of dreamless sleep. Harry had Kreacher take the other three to Andromeda, Narcissa, and Draco. He called for Winky to check on Teddy.
“Ron’s not a big fan of fire. It really was odd,” Ginny said with a shrug.
"The hot dumb one, or the funny one."
Harry didn’t want the attention that going back to Hogwarts would bring, not to mention, he knew how much chaos they’d left behind when they came here yesterday. “I doubt she’s had a single break with everything we left behind at Hogwarts. I don’t care if it hurts. Can you fix it?”
Harry leans back for a moment to look at Draco, "Hermione, or Granger, in my kitchen for breakfast. No titles, okay?"
His hands went to either side of my waist, and I found myself being raised and dropped onto his cock. My arms rested on top of his, and my hands lay gently on his shoulders. I wasn’t holding myself up in any way, his arms had me securely. As he increased the speed he was using to impale me on his cock, I threw my head back against the wall and panted. It didn’t take long for my orgasm to build back up. I started to reach down to touch myself, but Charlie changed tactics again before I could.
“Yeah, Harry, you’re going to go mental trying to deal with that all at once.”
Hermione's not in real pajamas, but she's still more casually dressed than Draco's used to seeing her in a pair of joggers and a t-shirt.
“Alright Kreacher, I’ll be down in a minute.” Harry checked the time to see it was indeed breakfast time and the next day. He’d slept over 16 hours and felt recharged for the first time in a very long time. He realised quickly that he was still had no clothes, so he transfigured his top sheet into a dressing gown and headed toward the kitchen. Harry heard voices in the drawing-room and stopped in to see who was there. Hermione and Ron were drinking tea and Teddy was sleeping in his crib, so Harry went into the room to see his friends.
“No one will understand what he’s feeling as he learns his parents are dead better than you will. And if he’s a werewolf or a Metamorphagus, he’s going to feel isolated, and different. There’s no one else who understands that better than you do either Harry. You had all the obstacles, all these challenges, and you turned out just fine. So will Teddy—” she said sincerely, then added, “so will his siblings,” with a smirk and a chuckle.
Harry shrugged. “Why should things change just because Voldemort is dead now?” Harry said with only a modicum of bitterness colouring in his tone.
Harry had just finished talking about the Elder Wand and turned away from the portraits. Before he could even express his desire to head to the Tower for food, Shacklebolt and McGonagall walked into the Headmaster’s office.
“Would you like me to come with you to see Andromeda? Is there anything I can do to help you?”
Hermione, "Teach us then, oh wise strategist, how did you put that together?"
“You’re no fun, little brother. But I’ll behave,” Charlie said, to which Ron and Bill both raised an eyebrow.
“Wise choice, Potter,” said McGonagall.
Everyone at the table’s eyes went wide, except for Hermione and Ron.
“I’m sorry I didn’t do it sooner.” Harry said, grief heavy in his voice.
“Oh fuck, yes, don’t stop,” Harry says, fighting the urge to thrust up into Fred’s mouth.
"Oh yes, Mione. They really do everything together." Harry said with a grin, "Life was seriously fucked up then, but there's something to be said for being sandwiched in the middle of two morally ambiguous and hedonistic Weasleys. I forgot my name that night too."
“All done,” Hermione said as she cast cleaning spells on her hands to remove the Dittany.
“Alright there love?” Harry asks, slowly stroking her hair. Helping her relax her way down from the high. Gin’s breath evens out, and she slowly lifts her head to look at Harry.
Charlie sat up, sliding my legs over his shoulders. He lined up his cock and slowly pressed the head inside me. I felt the stretch and burn as he slowly pushed inside.  He stopped once the head was in, took a few deep breaths, and looked over my face for any pain. I imagine all he saw was lust because the next thing I knew, he was bending forward, pressing my legs nearly back to my shoulders. I felt the burn in my leg muscles and the stretch in my arse simultaneously because he didn’t hesitate to slide all the way into me in one smooth, slow thrust.
She hugged her for a few moments, then she sat back again and told Andi that Harry would take Teddy back to Aunt Walburga’s for a while.
“We ran out months ago,” Hermione said as she pulled a sock from the bag and handed it to Harry. “It’s clean.”
"Not okay with cheating. That would never happen. Bill's happy with Fleur, but Fleur has given him a free pass with me, which I have no doubt she'd extend to Draco if I asked nicely." Harry puts his hand up, "Before you ask anything else. It's not my story to tell, and I'd rather you never even mention that you know that much."
Ginny grabs his arm, “Stop, Harry. I’m not mad, talk to me.”
“If you wish it, Pipsy will comply. Master Severus taught me that intent was the core of respect, not titles. He bade me to use Master with him because it wasn’t always clear who was watching him.”
Ginny laughed too. “Well, I mean, definitely not Percy or Ron and Bill already has Fleur, but I think George and Charlie could work out.”
Harry wastes no time following her.
“I’m not really sure what upset Ginny, but mentioning Hermione’s mom is where I went wrong with her.”
"We'll see 'Mione. We'll see."
Once their first coupling has ended, they both lay back on Harry’s bed catching their breath. Harry says to himself, “that was a bit different from blokes, but I liked it.”
"I don't see everything, Harry.  But I have been watching after you since we were eleven," Hermione reached out across the table, and Harry took her hand. "That hasn't changed as we've gotten older. I don't care that you're a ridiculously powerful wizard or a very talented Auror. To me, you'll always be my dearest friend who all the crazy things happen to. I'll always be watching for your best interests and for when you need my help."
“Cheeky bugger. I did promise that. Let me deliver.”
“No, Mr Potter, after having him living in my home, I am most decidedly happy that you have defeated him.”
Draco spluttered his tea, while Harry picked up a strawberry from his plate and threw it at Hermione. Ron reached up and snatched the strawberry before it could hit his wife.
"Good morning Hermione. Weasley." Draco says as he continues around to the other side of Harry before sitting across from Ron.
Harry concentrates on the cock in his mouth, so he’s startled when he feels a second finger slide into his arse. He chokes a bit as the shock pushed him a bit farther on George’s cock than he was comfortable with. But he doesn’t pull away, just backs off a bit and keeps going. Fred warns him this time, “Going to give you one more finger, Harry now.” Harry pushes back as an affirmation, and whines around George’s cock when the third finger breaches him.
Harry laughed aloud. "That's their choice as always. I make no promises, I'm not rescinding standing invitations to my bed because of your delicate sensibilities," Harry says with a smirk.
“Harry, you’re only seventeen, your life is just beginning, surely Mrs Tonks isn’t expecting you to raise him on your own?” asked Ginny.
The twin in front of him is holding his own erect cock and stroking it slowly. The twin behind him slides one finger inside him but doesn’t stop his constant attack with his tongue. The twin at his head reaches down for Harry’s chin and pulls his head up slightly, then pushes his thumb in between Harry’s open lips. Harry sucks the thumb into his mouth, and he hears a groan from in front of him.
“Faster, harder, please.” “Let me come, Charlie, please.”
A new thought suddenly crossed Andi’s mind because she suddenly turned to Narcissa, “Draco? How is Draco?”
“It’s good”, she said as she picked up her wand and took Ron’s place over Harry’s thigh. She began casting Vulnera Sanetur while Ron levitated the damaged flesh he cut out into the bowl and then added the sock Harry was biting on and the knife. He moved the bowl farther from Harry and Hermione, then set the contents on fire. Once everything had disintegrated other than the knife, Ron extinguished the fire. He cast sanitising spells on the blade, and the bowl, sheathed the knife, and put all of it back in the beaded bag.
-------
“You’re never going to let me forget that, are you? You were right, okay!” Harry said with exasperation.
“Andi was my favourite. We never stopped our correspondence, though no one knew about it. We used the House Elves to deliver messages unobtrusively.”
Draco's right behind him, "You were singing a completely different tune last night," Draco says as he reaches out, snagging Harry by the waist and pulling him into his body before he hits the first step. Harry's only got his shirt over his neck and one arm halfway in when Draco grabs him. Harry's still warm from sleep and melts into Draco's embrace.  Harry turns in his arms and puts his arms around Draco's neck, pulling him down into a slow, gentle kiss. Draco's managed to get his arms through his shirt but hadn't pulled it down all the way yet.  The flat planes of Draco's stomach rub against Harry's toned abs. Harry deepens the kiss then pulls away with a growl.
"I don't want the details of who's bits went where but I'd like to understand how that happened," Ron says, "And I cant wrap my head around Bill.  I can't imagine you're okay with cheating."
Ginny grasps the headboard to steady herself just before Harry reaches up and grabs her.  His hands grasp where her thighs meet her pelvis, both thumbs grazing over her lips. “Drop your weight Gin, I have you.” She relaxes the muscles she was using in her thighs to hold her steady and feels the strength of Harry holding her steady. With no warning, his thumbs slide right inside her lips, pulling them apart as he lowers her the last bit onto his face.
Harry snickers. He reaches up to grab the two vials that have just flown up the stairs and into his hand.
“Things with us were still a bit muddled back then, and neither of us wanted you to be hurt.”
“You have a large enough disaster here, and I fully intend to leave you with it. I have my family,” Harry said, waving his hand towards the Weasley clan, “and now I have three house-elves. Hermione will be thrilled about that, I’m sure. We’ll manage.”
"Wait, how'd that tell you anything?" Ron asked with confusion.
“Yeah, Harry, your last letter sounded like you wanted to take a walk off the Astronomy tower without your broom.”
Harry and Ginny
After Kreacher apparated away, Ron looked at Harry, quite confused, and asked, “Avoiding a Peter Pettigrew situation?”
“Interesting. With Snape gone, is there something you need from me, Pipsy?”
“Fuck Harry, that was bloody brilliant.”
Harry shivers at the sound of such a dirty thought coming from his comedic friend, but he can’t lie and say he isn’t curious. Fred guides Harry to his knees over George’s head and holds him steady as he lowers his arse onto George’s mouth. George immediately starts lapping at the come that has dribbled into the crease of Harry’s arse. Once he cleans that up, he fastens his mouth over Harry’s entire hole and sucks in earnest. Harry gasps, his legs are threatening to give out, but Fred’s arms are helping hold him up, and George’s hands are strong and steady under his thighs, so Harry just lets go. His balls and cock are lying haphazardly across George’s face, and this is just so dirty, wrong, right that his spent cock gives a twitch. It’s too soon for him to get hard again, but his dick is definitely letting him know that this is turning him on. George sucks hard one more time, then backs off to lick all of Harry as if he’s making sure nothing has been left behind.  George slides from under him, and both twins help ease him down to the rug.
"I'm sorry if I made you feel like I don't trust you.  I trust you with my life, and to stand by me no matter what."
Kingsley offered to have someone else take care of Harry’s task, but Harry refused. After everything the man had done to keep him alive, he needed to see to it personally. Harry and Ron left the office and went to the Shack. They brought Snape back to the Great Hall, while Kingsley and McGonagall taught Hermione how to cast the Fidelius Charm.
Ginny is still wet from their earlier session, and the added lubrication from Harry’s come still inside her ensures that his entry will be smooth. Ginny cants her hips and slides backward slowly, lining up his erection with her entrance. She breaks the kiss throwing her head back as Harry’s cock slides inside her in one smooth movement. Harry growls as the feeling of soft wet heat surrounds him. He tilts his head forward, sucking one of her breasts deep into his mouth, then backs off slowly until her nipple is the only thing left between his teeth.  He increases the pressure until Ginny gasps and groans from the blend of pain and pleasure. It’s his turn to gasp as she seats herself as far down as she can.
“When dragon hide breaks the skin, you’re at risk for a serious infection,” says Charlie, his tone serious, a stark contrast to the playful manner of earlier. “You need to have it looked at.”
Ron, "It was easy. Eliminating me and Percy from the beginning just leaves five Weasleys.
“Shit. I’m so sorry guys, I’m so used to it being just the three of us. I kind of forgot there were other people in the house.” Harry said, his cheeks flushing red.
Thankfully, the next time Harry woke, it was because Kreacher was rousing him for food.
Harry's first time with Charlie.
The twins aren’t the only Weasleys that don’t do things halfway. Charlie ate my arse like he was a starving man, and I was the first meal he’d had in a month. He used his tongue swiping across my opening, then prodding it, occasionally stopping to nip at my cheeks with his teeth then diving back into opening me up with his tongue. There was so much sensation, I almost felt like I was floating.
"Happily, let's go to the drawing-room and more comfortable seats first."
“I know Harry and I appreciate it. I can’t possibly face Walburga’s house or that damned portrait right now. Not yet.”
“Or the lovely Ms. Granger.”
"Now tell me all about how Charlie broke your mind."
"Here," Harry says as he passes one to Draco. "Pretty sure he doesn't give a damn if he clashes love."
"Too true. Though I can think of one, I'd want to crawl in here with us.  Definitely not that one, though."
Harry stuck the sock between his teeth, put his head down, and gripped the edge of the tabletop. Without warning, Ron drug the knife down the cut to open it up.
Fred leans toward Harry and says, “Alright?”
Suddenly, Fred reaches down and wraps his hand around Harry’s cock and starts stroking it to match the rhythm of his thrusts. Fred comes first, the tight hold of Harry’s arse is milking his cock, and he can’t hold back anymore. Fred shoves in all the way to the hilt and speeds up his strokes on Harry’s cock as he empties his balls into Harry. George is the next to go, as Harry gets closer to the edge, he starts sucking harder on George. George thrusts into Harry’s mouth and spills his load into Harry’s throat. Harry coughs a little, having no experience at breathing and swallowing around a cock in his throat. The sensation of Georges come in his throat, and Fred’s softening cock slipping from his arse is enough to tip Harry over the edge, and he’s shooting his second load of the night onto the rug.
"Oi. That only happened twice, you git."
Harry chuckles and takes the stairs two at a time. His shirt is off and discarded on the floor before he makes it to the landing.
I heard him chuckle.
Harry sighed. Hermione preferred Harry to say it, because she always wanted to reword it, or stop and explain its fallacies. In a very disassociated voice Harry slowly said, “The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches… born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies… and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not… and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives.”
“The twins,” I said, ducking my head sheepishly.
“Your morose missives have brought us here to see what’s going on with you.”
“Good. Now I’m going to torture Mum. When I tell her she’s a Gran, she’s going to assume we’re getting married. She’s going to freak out.”
Draco burst out laughing. "Harry, stop torturing Weasley."
He knew when he and Ron lay on either side of Hermione and held her as she cried herself to sleep.
"They work better like this, and there's nothing wrong with licorice.  Your taste buds are plebian."
Telling the tale was far more emotionally draining than Harry expected. Teddy was asleep, so he whispered for Winky, then passed the child over to the elf to put him down for a nap.
Hermione laughs. "Really, Ron, that's what got you talking?" Harry's also laughing now, and Draco's clearly smiling around his cup.
Harry called for Kreacher. “Kreacher, are you willing to be my secret keeper?”
Harry made their conversation private before replying. “Malfoy. Given everything that’s happened to us and between us for the past seven years, this may sound like a bullshit statement, but I want to thank you. For the manor, for your wand. Those two things, and your mother’s lie, played a huge part in my ability to defeat him. And for that, I’m grateful.”
A wolf whistle followed by, “Very nice Harry.” had Harry spinning around to see a blushing Fleur, an amused Bill, and a leering Charlie.
Harry looked up to see McGonagall had been watching the exchange and had a look of sadness in her eyes. Harry stood and stepped towards her. “I fear the responsibilities that weigh on you seem to have no end in sight, Potter,” said the usually stern matron with kindness.
Harry nodded, sliding the wand back into his pocket. “I’ll hold on to it until you’re able to come to get it from me then. I’ll speak for you and your Mother. Not Lucius, but you and your mother.”
Draco turns to look at Harry with an amused look and a raised eyebrow.
Harry slumps against Fred, who still has an arm around him. “Kay.”
Harry takes a long pull on the bottle, swallowing down and wincing past the burn. He looks to his left and right, seeing the twins just watching him patiently. Harry takes another swallow from the bottle then stares forward into the fire. “What am I supposed to say?”
“Okay, Harry, be careful.”
"Still have your keeper skills, I see. Good catch," said Draco
“I know Harry, I’m mostly teasing. I just thought it was amusing that you didn’t eliminate him.”
Harry lifts her a bit more, giving him room to slide out from under her. He sets her down gently on the pillow he just vacated, then rolls off the bed and stands up.  He quickly rolls his neck and shoulders to release the tension in his muscles, then reaches out to help Ginny into a more comfortable position. He can tell she’s still lost in the force of her orgasm and isn’t really back with him yet, so he climbs back up on the bed and pulls her gently into his lap.  He adjusts them, so his back is against the headboard, and Gin is seated across his lap, leaned into his torso, with her head tucked under his chin.
"Anytime you want Harry. I'm all yours." Draco leaned in for a kiss.
Suddenly the most diminutive elf Harry had ever seen appeared. She couldn’t even be two feet high. Both the elf and her clothes were clean, and instead of rags, she was wearing well-fitting clothing.
Ron just nodded and said, “Okay.”
He knew when he had to decide between Hallows and Horcruxes, two things that damn near any other wizard in the world thought were a myth or knew nothing of at all, and yet he had to choose which was more likely to help him defeat Voldemort — at seventeen.
“I’ll speak with Andi if you’d like Harry. There is no kind way to tell a mother her child has died. Focus on Teddy. I’ll stay with my sister as long as she needs me to.”
“It doesn’t take a long time to cast a Fidelus Charm. If you choose your keeper, we can go do it now,” said Kingsley.
“Just Kingsley, no need for titles. This conversation isn’t official in any capacity.”
Fred intercepts Harry as he walks past him. George takes the bottle from Harry, and Fred guides Harry back down to the rug. “Stop.”
“As long as you’re sure. I just don’t want to be attacked by someone’s older brothers.”
My only reply was to smile. Which was basically the last coherent thought I had. He set a brutal pace, thrusting in and out with speed and force. I was babbling and whimpering, shouting things like, “please,” and “more.” I could feel the second orgasm building slowly around the rhythm he had set, but if you’d asked me right then, I’d have said Charlie was a Legillimens because just before I was about to come, only from his cock in my arse and no other stimulation, he stopped and pulled out. I whined at the loss, but before I could open my mouth to complain, Charlie had stood up, and I was being lifted from the table back into Charlie’s arms and carried back to the wall.
Then he muffled the conversation to tell him that the Malfoy’s were turning themselves in, that’s why they were still there, but that first he needed to take Narcissa with him to speak to her sister.
Harry pushes her hips up just enough to give him room to speak. “I’m going to set you down all the way on my face; take what you want, Gin.” Before she can react or speak, she’s lowered onto his face. She feels the pressure of his nose and mouth and chin pressing into her. She reaches one hand down from the headboard and tangles it in Harry’s hair tugging it gently, and she starts to rock. She’s pressing down onto his face. Riding his nose with her clit, she can feel his tongue moving inside her, and she’s so close, she’s afraid to hurt him, but she wants to tip over the edge so badly.
It clearly wasn’t what Harry had expected her to say, and he was sure the confusion was evident on his face. “Um, okay. I think.” He paused for a moment, unsure what to say. “Pipsy, do you actually wish to belong to me, or are you just following Snape’s order?” Harry said.
Once Harry was content that those he’s responsible for, and a few he wasn’t, were taken care of, he allowed himself to drift back to sleep, hoping that the lifeless eyes of Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore stayed out of his mind.
Ginny reaches over the side of the bath for her wand. She sets the tub to drain, running clean water to rinse them both off. Then climbs out of the tub, waiting for Harry to follow. She waves her wand with a quick-drying charm, then pulls Harry towards her. “Talk time’s over lover boy,” she says as she reaches down and wraps her hand around his still soft cock giving him a quick squeeze.  She turns on her heel and walks towards the bedroom, calling out over her shoulder, “I have much more interesting things to do with your mouth.”
Harry considered the situation for a moment, then held out the Hawthorne wand to Draco for a second time. “Take the wand for now. None of you have one, and I may be altruistic, but the rest of this hall may not stay that way. Defend your Mother and yourself if you have to. I will back you up.”
Charlie set the bottle down on the ground far enough away where we wouldn’t knock it over. Then he turned back towards me. He slid the arm around my shoulders down until it was low around my hips. He lifted me in one smooth movement turning me to face him and setting me astride his lap. I was already turned on, but that display of strength, Holy Merlin, I’d never gotten so hard so fast.
“We’re not going to solve the Malfoy’s evil plan problem tonight.”
Ron groans as they walk into the drawing-room. "C'mon Malfoy, time for chess. I'm at my limit for talking about sex with Weasley's for the day." Draco just laughs and heads for the chess table.
"We're good, Harry. But you realize I still found out that way, just two months later?"
"The wards," Harry says with a soft smile.
Draco kissed his mother on the cheek, then reached out to touch his father’s arm. “Thank you, Potter,” said Draco. Lucius never spoke, but he offered a slight nod in Harry’s direction as Draco Apparated both of them away from the Great Hall.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked with a look of confusion on his face.
“You don’t think it’s like that?” George says, raising an eyebrow.
Harry climbs into his bed in the Gryffindor dorm and reaches out to pull his curtains closed when Dobby pops up at the foot of his mattress.
Kingsley had been right. Hermione set the charm within a few moments, leaving Kreacher as the secret keeper.
“Are you more worried about what the youngest Malfoy is plotting, or if you’re following him around everywhere for other reasons.”
Harry stands up and starts pacing in a circle around the small room. He’s talking with his hands, still holding the bottle. “I’m not wrong about the plotting, he’s up to something,” Harry says with vehemence. “But all the carrying on about it has made me start to question things. I like your sister, I mean like, like. But I can’t get Malfoy out of my head either. I’m not thinking about him like that, least I don’t think I am, but what if I do like blokes? How’s anyone supposed to know how to figure this stuff out? How am I supposed to figure this out when I’m being dragged around to hell and back with Dumbledore, having to pry things out of Slughorn, following evil gits around, getting no sleep, and…”
“I’ll talk to George, Charlie, and Bill. We’re all pretty honest and open with each other anyway. You won’t get any issues from them. Percy isn’t stupid enough to cross you anymore, and Ron, well, if he actually figures anything out, you can explain it to him,” Ginny says with a wink.
His hands kneaded my arse cheeks, squeezing and pulling them apart. I felt his warm breath over my entrance, and I heard myself gasp. Then his tongue was on me, and I couldn’t think again, only feel.
Harry walks into the Room of Requirement expecting something loud and vibrant, like a visual representation of Fred and George. Instead, the room was small and cozy. There was a plush rug that looked very soft in front of a fireplace. Fred and George are lounging on mounds and mounds of pillows. They are, however, wearing completely obnoxious pajamas.
I felt Charlie move back up my body, fingers still rubbing inside my arse, taking me closer and closer to coming. Then suddenly, his hand pulled out, and he flipped me back onto my back. Before I had even registered the movement, Charlie’s hot wet mouth slid down over my cock, and he shoved his fingers back inside, immediately searching for that sweet spot one more time.
“In which case, I can explain a bit more,” said Harry.
“But, how? I don’t understand. There’s two of you. Wait, do you fancy me?” Harry blurts out.
Ron's standing near the bed, he hasn't spoken, he's just frozen there.
“You’re going to kill me.”
Fred pulls off of Harry and sits back on his heels, “Hands and knees, Harry.”
“That’s a good point. It’s not a complex spell. I don’t have to be the caster. I can teach one of you.”
Harry looked into Narcissa’s eyes and only saw complete sincerity. “Five?” he asked.
“Harry doesn’t use spells at all anymore when its just us. Though things people expect to be a verbal spell, he’ll say the incantation, but mostly to keep up appearances,” said Ron. “We don’t want anyone to know exactly how powerful he is. They’re already going to assume it because he defeated Voldemort. There’s no reason to give them more than that.”
He looked me in the eye and said, "Harry, I don't do relationships. Ever. With anyone." I went to talk, and he cut me off. "I know you and Ginny broke it off. But I also know my little sister's in love with you. Do you even like women?"
Ron bumped Hermione’s shoulder before turning back to his food.
Andi answered for her sister, “She means the three of you along with Severus and Albus. She’s right, Harry, you have nothing to apologise for. We lost many in this war, but those deaths lie at the feet of Voldemort and no other. And as angry as I am with Dora for leaving the house tonight, I know she fought for what was right and for a better world for her son.” Andi’s voice cracked as she said Tonk’s name, and her tears flowed again as she finished her statement.
“Are you?”
Bills eyes went wide, “Fifteen centimetres long and at least a centimetre deep is not just a scratch Harry.”
"I love you, Ron," Harry smirks at Draco, "Told you."
George was still poking his fork into his meal and staring off into the distance. Harry was about to pass over him and ask Molly what she wanted to know when he whispered without looking up. “Can you tell us more about Snape? I know no one liked him much, but once he found our invention notes, they must have fallen out of one of our bags. He sent them back to us during the next class rolled up inside an essay with improvement notes on them. Fred,” George’s eyes filled with tears and he cleared his throat. “After that, whenever we got stuck on something, Fred and I would stick our ideas in our essays and he would help. He never talked to us about it, and his attitude never changed, but from all the notes, we got to know him pretty well. He had a wicked sense of humour.” After he finished talking, he shut back down, but seemed to listen when Harry answered.
Draco nodded.
Fred pulls his own shirt off then leans forward, wrapping his arms around Harry’s torso.  He pulls Harry back into his chest. George drags his hands down Harry’s stomach stopping at the top of his pajama bottoms. He looks to Harry for permission. Harry nods, and George unties them.  Fred pulls Harry’s head back towards him and mashes their lips together as George slides the bottoms and Harry’s pants down over Harry’s hips. George wastes no time being subtle but pulls both off Harry in one swift movement.
“They keep telling me I’m obsessed with Malfoy.”
“Take all the time you need and don’t worry about Teddy, but don’t isolate yourself for too long. I have all the Weasley’s at my house for now, and they’ve lost Fred as well.”
“Morning, sleepyhead,” joked Ron.
"Um, sorry for that, guys. It was a bit of a shock."
He knew when he planned to break into Gringotts. Which, even with the crazy plots they had pulled off in the past, Harry was sceptical they would accomplish.
Pipsy bowed, then shook Harry’s hand. “Hello, Master Harry.”
Then he heard Ron’s update. “Halfway there, I’m cutting back up the other side.”
Ron leaned in towards Harry and quietly said, “I don’t think Ginny knows how to handle you suddenly being a parent, mate.”
He knew when he was digging a small grave to lay Dobby in after he died saving them.
Harry sighs and thinks to himself, “so much for sleeping tonight.” But if the twins are here in the castle looking for him, it might be important. Harry grabs his cloak and map and heads to the Room of Requirement.
“How do you mean?”
"The 'ginger waiter.' Ron found him in Harry's bed the next morning.  He didn't come down for breakfast, but when Ron described him, I knew."
I was so sated and relaxed, I felt ecstasy, but I wasn’t hard. The hand on my leg slid up to my balls and massaged them slowly, he moved on to my cock, stroking not to entice, but just to enhance the sensations. I didn’t know what to concentrate on, the hand on my pelvis, the hot wet kisses on my neck, the hand gently scratching my nipples and holding me tight against him, or the hips slowly taking their own pleasure from my worn-out body.
Draco snickers, "That did turn out to be about all his mouth was good for."
“Hermione, you learn it. Then we’ll set it. Alone, no need to divulge who’ll be there to a room full of portraits that often have second paintings.”
What a laugh. The chaos started immediately.
“Relax and let go. Just feel. I’ll take good care of you.” Charlie stripped me of the rest of my clothes and slid me back further onto the table. He climbed up, straddling my thighs with his hands on my chest. He went back to kissing me, starting with my neck. This time he focused on the opposite side that he attacked before. When he nipped a tendon in my shoulder hard enough to make me cry out and arch my back, I let go. I quit thinking of anything but the sensations going through my body.
“Don’t upset her too much Gin, she’s got a lot on her plate right now.”
Harry told them of Snape’s turn to the Dark Lord, how he accepted the Dark Mark, How he heard half of Trelawny’s prophecy and Snape’s shock when Voldemort said that it meant Lily’s child. He explained how Snape begged for Lily’s life, and while Voldemort agreed, Snape knew his only hope was going to Dumbledore.
"Weasley's still dumbstruck Potter."
"We love you, mate."
“I know, that’s why I want to distract her.”
Harry sighed, but before he could speak, Narcissa spoke again. “Andi.”
Draco groans. "Ugh. Does he know it clashes with his hair? Use that sickeningly powerful magic of yours to accio up a hangover potion from the kitchen."
“No worries. I managed,” Harry said as he stood from his chair and walked to the pile of clothes that was amassing on the side table next to Hermione.
She cast a diagnostic spell then said, “The tissue is infected, though it hasn’t entered your bloodstream. The damaged tissue will have to be cut out before I can heal it properly, and it’s going to hurt worse now than it did when it happened. Bill’s right, Pomfrey should come do this properly.”
“Harry has arranged for us to turn ourselves into the Minster personally on Wednesday.”
Harry joined Ron and Hermione for a bit. They talked about a plan to resolve the issue with the Granger’s memories, but came upon no specific solution.
“Merlin,” Charlie interjected with a look that was a combination of shock and awe. “People don’t hitch rides on dragons for good reasons. You’re lucky it didn’t throw you from its back. Though I have heard rumours about the barbaric ways Gringotts treated the dragon, so I’m proud you liberated it.”
"I love you both, and I'm lucky to have you in my life." Harry's face turns lascivious, "Now, get out of here. I have a hot, naked, blonde in my tub upstairs waiting to bugger me senseless." Ron grimaces, and Hermione laughs. "Details later, Harry. I want details." She says as Ron pulls her to the fireplace.
Draco nodded his gratitude.
. Potter was ten times the better seeker. Better sports glasses wouldn’t hurt though.’
Draco on the other hand, was struggling to concentrate on what he forgot. Potter hadn’t been making it easy for him. He took down Draco’s trousers gracefully, then pulled down Draco’s underwear in an excruciatingly slow speed probably to humiliate him, but it also made him aroused. The spanking was of course as humiliating and arousing as it can be. Draco could hardly keep his eyes on the memory ball let alone concentrate on what he forgot. He really needed to think, or…
‘To what end?’
Indeed, as Harry was staring at his arse right now.
That girl really tried. And Potter did have some potential in modeling.
The man hesitated at that, then said: ‘How do you feel about a little breaking and entering?’
Draco halted, keeping his mask in place as best as he could, and looked down at Potter.
‘Oh please, I’m rather pricy. Mrs. Keepin would never give him that kind of gold to throw around. And however much influence she has of the judicial system, he could hardly use it for personal vendetta.’ Draco could feel his fingers trembling, so he hid them under the table, and he managed to keep his expression wry.
Draco was trembling as he felt the warm embrace of the man, holding him tight, taking his hand off the doorknob and shushing lightly: ‘Shh… don’t cry. It’s alright. It’s all passed.’
And that was the last sign, Draco sighed and let the name roll off his tongue: ‘It’s been so long —— Good to see you alive, Vincent Crabbe.’
‘At least… at least I should get to touch you one more time, hug you one more time, kiss you one more time… Merlin, what did I do to deserve this.’
Right. The man is a dom. And Draco answered: ‘Yes.’ the man waited, and Draco reluctantly continued, ‘…sir.’
from Potter, so he would finally be able to bury everything about Potter.
He said as he got on its back deftly, then stretched out his hand at Draco.
Back then, it was just for fun. Who the fuck would have known Tom Riddle was really going to rise from the dead and came back full-blown psychotic? Despite everything father said, part of him didn’t care about anything political, and somehow, he always thought Potter would squash all conspiracy of Voldemort like he had been doing for years. He was used to running his mouth to push Potter’s buttons, not caring that Potter always wins in the end. Part of him even liked that Potter always bested him, and the other part, of course, was forever defiant.
‘I don’t think it’s a good idea.’ Draco finally said.
Draco was extremely amused: the man seemed so confident and ruthless when he was dominating, and they were still the same people, he could put Draco over his lap right now, and Draco would comply, but he seemed so shy and cautious, even blushed when Draco deliberately leaned in closer and smiled.
Then Draco saw it. A weird curve on Rosier’s cloak, and something there —— a golden arrow, pointing at the familiar handle of Draco’s wand.
Potter stroked Draco’s hair until Draco look up into Potter’s eyes, and asked again: ‘Why are you here.’
‘You gave me too much credit. It was a calculated decision.’ Draco leered at Potter, his rosy lips curled up to a playful smile, ‘Sorry to burst your little bubble but I’m still a Slytherin.’
Draco narrowed his eyes. The man was unhealthily thin, perhaps spending his life chasing sensual pleasures had sucked him dry, and that sandy hair of his made him seem pale like straw paper. He really couldn’t pull off that black and white vertical striped robe. Maybe he should try the lateral ones.
That’s what he learned from his earliest heir education, beaten into him word for word by father’s cane. And they both know that this particular heraldry had a different purpose than the others.
She narrowed her eyes, as if saying: we talked about this. I’ll definitely spank you if you were my sub. So Draco quickly conceded: ‘Deal.’
For a brief second, the expression on the man’s face changed. It wasn’t that composed face of a dom anymore, Draco couldn’t tell what all the mixed emotions were, but there was anger for sure. He immediately knew he must have stepped out of line.
‘The slut on the wall, you mean.’ Malfoy drawled, the changing colour of the potion danced on his irises, making it impossible to tell his thoughts, ‘One would think that’s beneath you. Surely the Lord of the Wizarding World can do better than a hole in the wall. Just raise your finger and all the best Omegas would spread their legs for you.’
Draco looked down at him: ‘This sounds an awful lot like a proposal.’
The man gently combed his fingers through the hair on Draco’s temple and asked hoarsely: ‘Would you like to do a scene now?’
The two-headed snake hissed at the command, and the two black dragons flew up into the air, circled solemnly until they settled, one on each side of Draco’s.
The final plot.
Later that night, after being thoroughly fucked and spanked, not allowed to cum but dry orgasming one more time, Draco was, of course, condemned to the basket.
He could see the young Potter, not knowing he had Draco’s heart at his feet, looking at him with those cold emerald eyes, telling him:
‘Er, Ron. Hermione.’ The man said, ‘Have a seat?’
‘What extra punishment?’ Draco was dumbfounded.
And he finally figured out why those silver balls looked so familiar. They were made the same way the golden snitches were made. With even more sophistication, one could say. Potter, as the first man whoever touched the balls, he had full control over them. With a snap of his fingers, Potter made the balls stick together, and sitting on the broom would make them sink deeper into him and right against his prostate. He had to alternate between hanging by his arms and sitting on the broom. Two minutes and he was almost desperate for release, but Potter had locked his magic around his cock, forbidding just that.
Someone got a picture of Potter kneeling in front of Draco in pain. But the picture was taken from a long distance away, of very bad quality, with branches and bushes shielding them, making it impossible to see Potter’s painful expression or Draco’s angry expression, the only thing one could tell from the picture was that Potter was kneeling on one knee in front of Draco.
Extra punishment. Even more if he didn’t follow the man’s orders quick. It didn’t seem like a good idea to start his second punishment with the extra punishment that had him crying and begging last time.
The man leaned down, this time more intimate and spoiling, stroking Draco’s hair and cheeks: ‘Good boy.’
By now, Draco wasn’t so skeptical about all things she said anymore; he hesitated, then gave in: ‘I had help.’
No. Draco remembered. No, not safe word. He did something terribly wrong, and he deserve the punishment. He shouldn’t just coward out the way he always did with almost everything in his life. He need to take his punishment.
‘Hey, you are the one who couldn’t recognise your crush of more than a decade,
Draco took another look and couldn’t help but laughed: ‘Count down to your next birthday? Potter? Seriously? This one literally just passed, you haven’t even opened all your presents yet.’
And he remembered. This must be why he was being punished. Because he disobeyed Potter’s order to use the salve. He didn’t take good care of his toy. And the Dom wouldn’t tolerate that.
That’s another unsettling question.
He waited, and as Draco didn’t say anything, he looked up timidly and asked: ‘Does this mean I get to take care of you the rest of my life?’
And Draco found pleasure indeed, pure psychological pleasure, just by serve and to be used by the man, and he couldn’t stop himself from shaking in ecstasy.
She snapped her fingers, made the decision for Draco and told the caterer the brand of champagne and wine they would use.
‘Um, either is nice.’ Draco said, trying his best to think of something to say, ‘They will have a wonderful childhood with that portable zoo you have. However, you might want to be careful. A lot of the things you keep are dangerous to little humans.’
Knowing Potter was probably waiting for a safe word, Draco adjusted his posture and evened his breath: ‘I’m sorry… sir.’
And Draco wanted to tell him.
The man, on the other hand, enjoyed Draco’s poor attempt at pretending as he was obviously awake as he had a fierce blush of embarrassment on those pale cheeks. His green eyes watched Draco getting dressed as if a wolf sizing up his pray, enjoying the view of Draco’s deliciously red arse.
‘That I am.’ Draco said, the world is still a mess and blur to him, ‘But I really need to know how he is.’
No matter how many more guests, the procedure wasn’t going to change, it’s the way it always had been for the past hundred years, as mother went over with him when she helped to dress him in the black, green, silver formal robe: the guests would start to arrive at around two o’clock, and the tea party would be at three, dinner starts at five, and ball at eight. All the guests will have to stay till count down, for the final ritual symbolising Draco as the next head of the Malfoy family in front of the family heraldry.
‘Yes.’ Draco said, ‘I just need to…’
‘Well, they kind of have to rearrange the department after the war, they separated the rooms, some of them are still together, some of them alone. They called these new places “Ground Points”, and each Ground Point has its guardian, and as you probably guessed, I’m the guardian of this Ground Point. Each guardian decides individually where they would like to place the rooms, how they would like to guard the rooms, and how the unspeakables who work on researching the rooms get to work.’ Potter said as they stopped outside of a locked room, ‘Since I’m going to be the next headmaster of Hogwarts, I can no longer be the guardian of this room, and I’ve arranged the transfer today. I’m transferring the ownership of the room of requirement, leaving “Fantasy” to Ruby, and Danny Ziegler —— her sub, she met him accidentally in the bakery one day, he’s an unspeakable that works here —— will be the new guardian.’
The man with his childhood rival’s face was watching him strip, and that naturally makes each moment long and a torture. But he was wearing too much and clothes too fine to strip fast. He untied his tie, took off his dark grey robe, and went on to unbutton his waist coat and shirt, and paused.
There was a light pink blush on Draco’s cheeks as he leaned in for a second time, kissed the man on his forehead and held him close: ‘There’s… there’s this song mother used to sing to me when I couldn’t sleep. Have um, have anyone ever sing you a lullaby before?’
‘Hands on the sill, arse up.’ The man demanded.
And he threw something at Draco, that thing drew a beautiful silver curve in the night, and Draco caught it with his seeker reflex.
‘I’ll raise you one better.’ Draco said, and he kissed the man on his lips.
‘Umm… yeah actually.’ The man casted a protective charm on Draco’s arse so the hot water wouldn’t hurt him more, spelled the tap hotter before turning it on, then splashed a little on Draco’s hand, ‘Since you are staying the night, I’m guessing you prefer shower over cleaning charms, and you probably like your shower hotter than I do. Is this good for you?’
The first few strikes, Draco tried just to take it like a good pet, but the strikes of the wooden spoon were really painful, and there’s not just the stinging, but the sweet, yet sour pleasure vibrating deep into his hole and up his spine. And Potter was being so spoiling, he kissed and caressed Draco after each strike, and Draco could feel Potter’s gentleness eroding his resistance.
‘I am a rather possessive person, and kind of sick of disguises by now, so I think it’s better this way.’ Potter said as he almost ripped the glamour from Draco’s face, then pushed Draco between his shoulders, ‘Strip.’
Potter was ruthless, by strike seven, Draco was outright crying, tears tainting his face, the cute little pucker deep pink and swollen, but he didn’t dare let go of his hands, just writhed in the pain and burning desire, and he was begging: ‘Seven! I’m sorry… please, I promise I won’t disobey you again —— Thank you…sir……’
Malfoy, as the condemned Death Eater, despite keeping his head down, got the worst, while as prefect, he tried his best to protect other Slytherins.
‘It seems I have indeed spoiled you.’ Potter said coldly, the whip broke the air with a loud crack, ‘Strip, or else.’
Draco couldn’t answer. He just reached out and held Potter’s face in his other hand and pulled Potter into his mind. When one was really good at Occlumency, they could do that. Draco knew the magical theory, just never did it before. Being drunk and mentally distracted right now, he had a few flashbacks of Potter at fourth-year Yule Ball and at tonight’s Yule Ball before he could find the right memory.
‘And Malfoy‘s got his legs wrapped around Harry.’
Draco stopped, but before he could turn and search for Potter, someone twisted his arm behind him and pushed him into the wall.
But his hands never let go.
Maybe, just maybe, like Ginevra Weasley, they are all just obsessed with the dream version of Potter they cooked up in their mind, that’s why all the other Potters were more popular than the real Potter. To Draco, and only to Draco, Harry James Potter was his dream version, as the composed and caring Dom, as the awkward and cute man outside the dungeon, as the brutal and vulgar man in the bed, even without the good looks and fame and fortune, as an entirely different man —— probably as truthful as he could be, as for the first time he was truly free to be who he was, hidden behind another face —— and Draco was in love with him all over again, if not more, and as true and deep as it could be this time.
The man looked back a bit surprised, he wore his hair slicked back, and wasn’t wearing any glasses, so his clear emerald eyes just inches away from Draco’s silver eyes. Also, a few strands of his hair and part of his clothes had green paint on it. It took Draco a moment to realise the man he’s now holding hands with was Potter. The
Draco could barely grab his knees when the man pulled the three balls out of him and stuck his tongue into Draco’s hole just as Draco was clenching and sucking in reflectively, the feeling of having a tongue inside him was greatly different when it was some lifeless toy or just the fingers, and Merlin that tongue was strong and lively twisting and licking inside him in the most dirty and arousing way possible.
‘You don’t have to say that just because I’m dying.’
‘If you don’t feel fine, contact me.’ Potter said, emerald eyes bright and serious, ‘What you should not do, is being irresponsible to yourself .’
And Potter left, and Draco watched. He was about to make a turn at the hallway, and he would be gone.
, the spell of suicide, ‘You can’t stop me. And when Potter comes, sees me dead, you’ll have no leverage.’
Thanks to Mika, and all of you who tried to comfort me. I’ll admit I’m a bit fragile, but all comments, positive or negative, are appreciated. ;) I normally try to reply to all of them, but I might skipped over a few I don’t know how to answer. Again, love you all regardless.
‘Well.’ The man said as he kissed Draco again, ‘Love is crazy.’
Well, to be fair, he was a good friend, literally bailed Draco out, said good things about Draco in the speech, showed Draco the hippogriff and took him for a ride and all. Not to mention, he did a lot of work to attend Draco’s birthday party. That robe Pansy designed for him, the dark green dress shirt really brought out his eyes. He was just bad at conversations. And given his history with the fiasco that dating had turned out to be, it’s just his birth default. Draco was the one that kept overreacting because he had an unresolved crush on Potter, or had another man’s cum up his arse.
‘You do remember your promise?’ Potter asked.
So. Invisible flower and bees.
Hannah looked like she’s about to pass out, and Neville quickly held her, apologised and excused themselves.
The man pointed to Draco: ‘Should Draco be briefed? He is the planner.’
Normally, Draco wouldn’t let anyone near his thoughts. But he was probably the best at Occulmency among living wizards. The man wouldn’t be able to see what he didn’t want the man to see even with the real Legilimency Charm.
After Draco had enough, Potter vanished the cup and said: ‘About the 40 I added… ’
Pansy quieted down at that.
‘Shut it!’ Draco really couldn’t be reminded of their nights spent together. They took a whole new meaning now that he knew it was actually Potter he’s been fucking with, ‘Why can’t I hate all that trouble? Can’t I just want a simple relationship that has nothing to do with Potter?’
‘To make you miserable.’ Pansy smiled.
Malfoy?’
She didn't say anything more, but Harry knew she knew. He never really got to meet and spend time with his parents, and the Dursleys weren't exactly model foster family. To him, family was something he never had and would always long for. The only chance he had at a family was to mate and build a family of his own, and that's probably what he wanted most if he were selfish.
Luna Lovegood. Of course.
Draco looked from the note to the dress, couldn’t help but ran his hand over the glimmering material.
Draco breathed out as even as he could: ‘Today, sir.’
It was the ring.
He couldn't care less about Diggory. He wasn't even sure if 'Diggory' had one g or two when he was making the badges for Merlin's sake, and he certainly did not go to Diggory and show him what he had done. All he cared about was Potter. He might as well have just printed 'I have the biggest fucking crush in the entire history of Hogwarts on Harry Potter' on the badges. It was so fucking obvious. And he made sure everyone at Hogwarts knew about his grand gesture. He couldn't get anymore public than that.
‘Fine. Tell them, we’ll do it… Next Thursday.’ Draco flipped through the papers on his desk, ‘By then we would have the basic settings and process ready. We would just be working on the flowers and ornaments.’
But all he could hear right now, in all the chaos and happiness, was that clear sound of breaking from his chest.
Rosier struggled to look up, fixed his eyes on Potter, and spoke coldly: ‘Is there anything you would like to say to me?’
‘Sorry.’ Draco tried to suppress his smile, ‘If I fully planned this, there would be apple juice. But mother doesn’t appreciate the art of irony and deception —— how do you normally deal with events like this?’
But by nightfall, when the last shade of pink and purple was about to fade away, Draco excused himself from a laughing and smiling group of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, saying that he had to go find his boyfriend.
Potter sighed: ‘Shakespeare?’
A door appeared on the wall near an Andrew’s Cross in the playroom to reveal that Gryffindor dorm room: ‘We can get to this room any number of ways. It’s a room I kept as constant for myself to rest or stay the night. You are the first person ever there.’
‘Yeah something happened.’ Draco said with smothered voice, ‘I took your brilliant advice and went to apologise to Potter.’
Draco hesitated for just a brief second and took the seat as he was told, the man directed his wand and a cup of hot tea floated to Draco, and Draco took a sip. So the man began: ‘Mr. Malfoy. You stated in the contract that you decided to use our service to punish yourself for… past bullying?’
Draco was shaking, but the man was still speaking. Draco knew from experience the man was able to pick up any changes in him, no matter how little, for the man to overlook his shaking, he must be very distracted: ‘In that case, it is vital to angle one’s body so the belt buckle wouldn’t hit anywhere important.’
‘Have a seat.’ The man repeated, humoured by Draco’s horrified expression, ‘It’s time for your extra punishment.’
There seemed to be an endless alternation between the two that night, Draco was fucked till his arsehole was rosy and swollen, Harry’s cum filled to the brim, sensitive to even the slightest blow of air, and the last orgasm of his, his shot nothing and had it dry, it ripped through him so pleasantly and painfully that he passed out the moment it left him alone.
By the end of the punishment, Draco was incredibly desperate for any kind of consolation to his cock and his hole, and Potter asked with his fingers stroked and pulled at the pucker: ‘You think you can take a plug up here, pet? It’s going to burn a little if I dip it in ginger oil.’
‘Um… not exactly.’ The man said, looking uncomfortable, ‘I wouldn’t be able to tell you if you are not on the security details of the memorial, but I guess I can now. Let’s just say… Mr. Potter always takes the most dangerous route himself, Hermione wasn’t exactly happy but conceded and calls it a double bluff. And if it’s really dangerous, like the Yule Ball, he would refuse to have doubles arranged against all suggestions from the Auror department and his security team.’
‘A chair.’ Potter said. The realisation had dawned on him, and he had quickly pulled himself together.
Draco waited, then stroked Potter’s cheek: ‘I’m waiting for a turn, Potter. So far, you haven’t been able to make the position attractive.’
Draco laughed: ‘If so, you wouldn’t be so afraid to talk.’
Harry left without fucking the Omega that night, but he was content nonetheless.
Potter struggled to look at him before he apparated away, his emerald eyes sad and Draco felt as if they tore something from his chest.
‘Um, where are you going?’
‘What happened to Goyle? I told him to drop by for his favourite steak.’ Draco tried to divert, ‘Lost his way and ended up in Scotland again?’
‘A golden snitch is worth one hundred and fifty points.’ Potter said coldly, ‘Apparently that was worth your health and safety.’
‘Salazar…go! I can’t let mother know you are here.’
They finished the rest of the dinner in peace, as Pansy suddenly lost interest in tormenting the man, then they apparated to the Big Ben for the count down and celebration of the new year.
So the interrogation continued.
Pansy widened her eyes, not catching up with what he was saying: ‘What? Are you really going to do what your father wants? After all that?’
‘How could you…’ His tears fell.
Draco got separated with the man somewhere along the line,
the next morning he did?’
Standing there, Draco was lost in a moment of flashback.
Something else was different. Draco hardly ever hears Potter use foul language, and he soon realised Potter probably never had the chance to do what he was doing now. To watch Draco willingly push his limits, taking the punishment he might not be able to endure, was just the beginning. People are complicated, and Potter wasn’t just a sadist, Draco could feel something in Potter’s personality contradicted his identity as a Dom, and it couldn’t be satisfied with the caretaking after the act. It always impeded him from getting what the monster inside him wanted, stopped him from delivering pain and pleasure as he truly wishes. By asking for one thousand strikes, Draco had given him a chance he would never have given himself, to unleash the monster. Also, Potter liked to be challenged, right now Draco was presenting him with a really difficult one: to make such a severe punishment endurable, even enjoyable.
Draco’s heart ached and melted at that.
‘Oh, I wasn’t talking about him.’ Lovegood smiled, ‘I was talking about Death. She cared for Harry a bit ten years ago. They had a good relationship. After all, he is the only one that ever collected but never abused her three gifts. Rumor has it she secretly decided not to take his life until he deems he has lived a long and content life —— like in the story, when he willingly takes off his invisibility cloak and greets her as an old friend. Anyway, I’m glad you found your way back from her.’
He had started looking forward to their play dates, he had even slept better, and found himself in a good mood even when the first class in the morning was potions.
Draco nodded absentmindedly.
Harry chuckled, left the swollen pink nipple and kissed further down to Draco’s groin, nudged at Draco’s hard cock with his cheek, giving it a few dirty teasing licks as he answered: ‘I’ve been told I would end up in a juvenile borstal institution. In fact, that’s what they told other people after I went to Hogwarts. But, pretty thing, you haven’t seen half of it yet.’
Then he looked at the present sent by the man. If he were to take a guess, it would be some kind of toy in the present. It wasn’t a big package. Something like the silver balls? Or maybe a dildo same size of the man’s cock?
‘Huh? Pardon me.’ The man shook out of his dazed state.
‘He… why would he…’ agree to such a spell?
‘No… no,’ he stuttered, ‘not the cane.’
Nevertheless, the man proceeded with incredible patience and gentleness. He took out a jar of white salve and applied it to Draco’s abused flesh as careful as possible. Draco buried himself in the warmth of the blanket, trembling and whimpering a little whenever the man massaged with some strength so the welts and bruises would heal faster.
‘When it was with some random model or athlete you were shagging, no. But Potter?! You knew I need to know about that. Not the details, Merlin no. But anything that happens between you and Potter was like, big red flag.’ Pansy said as she gestured with her hands exaggeratedly, almost knocking over her cup of lemonade, ‘Merlin, I should have known once you stopped pulling those models and athletes years ago. Salazar Draco! You were supposed to tell me if
He was definitely in some dungeon, not the fun kind, bound tight to a chair, also not the fun kind, and his arse was killing him. He would even give his wand back if the kidnapper just let him cast a few cushioning charms.
The man smiled fondly at him, reached out to hold his face and ran the pad of his thumb across Draco’s bottom lip: ‘I’m going to teach you how to do it the way I like it. It’s only your first lesson, so I’ll make it easy.’
How much did Potter hear? Did he know what was going on? Or did he mistaken Draco as someone who threatens bodily harm because he was just a degraded person?
‘In your dreams Potter!’
In fact, Draco loved every second he spent with the man, how the man couldn’t keep his hands off him, how Draco was the only beauty to those emerald eyes, and the way the man awaits for his goodnight kisses on the forehead with glinting innocent eyes like a child.
‘Anything you would like to say now?’ Potter lifted Draco’s chin, stroking teasingly, ‘No? I guess that’s progress then.’
Potter said, smiling darkly as the door closed behind him, and they were again in the familiar place of Room 6.
Despite his teasing, Potter was cautious, he combed his fingers through Draco’s hair in soothing motions, and his eyes were soft: ‘What do you want me to do about this?’
His family did fell a little after the war, but he had worked their way back to a respectable position by throwing gold at both charities and politicians, and that in return, earned him even more money and guilt. Seeing Potter’s name in the top five pointed glamour list was the last straw. And he just… couldn’t resist.
‘I have to apologise, as I later realised that’s my first step onto the slippery slope; things went south really fast after that.’ Potter ran his hand over his face, frustrated and embarrassed, ‘I promised myself it was just going to be a healing process for you; I was not going to violate you anyway another Dom wouldn’t. I started to like you more and more. So the second month, I asked Hermione if I could tell you who I was. But that’s when they started setting the trap operation, so she denied. So I tried the alternative, I tried to meet you as myself, but it didn’t work out very well. And after you almost got sent to prison, I thought it’s best you don’t know anything confidential anymore, because of the mole, he used you as patsy once, and if that ever happens again, I’m not sure I could be there on time.’
That would mean he had to look at Potter.
Granger stopped him: ‘The court was well aware of the possibility that Mr. Malfoy may have transferred the tracking powder to Mr. Potter, and the court had reason to believe that if that were the case, it was an honest mistake.’
‘I was awake when Malfoy said he couldn’t marry Harry tomorrow. Nearly gave me a heart attack.’
She smiled softly at him, then said: ‘It’s very nice to see a past student. Especially since you have become quite an impressive man, Mr. Malfoy, I’ve heard about the things you did, the charity you did, the childcare system you helped to build, the bills you helped push through —— Don’t look surprised. I am old, but not dead. I have friends in the Ministry, and I know things, not even Mrs. Granger knows. Who do you think she learned from? And seeing you today, I am sure. What happened at Hogwarts still bothers you, but I don’t believe it’s bad, as long as you know, a redeemed man had walked a longer and more difficult path than the rest. The slanders and discrimination may always follow you, as it’s a price that’s inevitable, but you should raise your head as high as the others because you are no less man than them.’
He came in the door right after Draco managed to take a seat at the couch and pretended he had been here for a while. The man smiled a little and apologised: ‘Sorry. Today is exceptionally busy for the club —— we are holding a “Potter’s night”. They were debating whether we should have a display of an orgy of a few Potters, and whether the customers could join if they pay enough.’
‘That’s why you have been staying?’ Draco asked, ‘And frankly I am surprised you stayed.’
‘Why not? This was the little country house Mrs. Keepin gave you as an apology for what her son did —— thankfully, Bard still had the key. It’s registered to you.’ Rosier said, the tip of his wand touched Draco’s throat, and the pain of crucio was present again; Draco screamed, struggled to catch his breath when the pain stopped, ‘And even if they found out about this, no one else would trust an ex-death eater kidnapped by neo-death eaters, he’ll come, even if it means to ditch all his protective details, he’ll still come because he’s stupid that way. Always had to be the saviour. You hated that about him too, didn’t you? I guess we have a little in common after all.’
Potter had also changed after that.
‘Oi! Malfoy! Was Potter any good at sucking cock?’
Draco’s arse was completely battered, now bright red that glowed, with ten clear crimson colored stripes evenly spaced. The man used a much milder version of cleaning spell on him, so mild that it didn’t hurt his tender arse, before placing a hand on his back, stroking long and light: ‘Now let’s make you feel better, okay?’
‘Morgana I can’t believe it.’ Pansy huffed, abandoned her oatmeal and went to pour herself a cup of Whiskey, ‘If you don’t want to do it, just go cry to your fucking boyfriend. I’m sure he can move the world for you.’
Thanks to all the readers, and Mika for proofreading all the way here.
Draco couldn’t say how embarrassed he was when the doctor did a full-body scan, and it showed he had injuries at his arse and arsehole —— he really shouldn’t skip healing them. He was worried the doctor would think he was raped, but luckily, she leaned in and whispered in his ear: ‘They look like old injuries. From that time two days ago, in the dungeon?’
The party room got more heated as the night proceeded, and Draco was no doubt at the centre of the spotlight.
‘I believe that’s the end of this session.’
Potter, however, didn’t come.
Potter looked back at Draco at that, and Draco explained: ‘I know that sometimes your enemy knows you the best, but this is getting ridiculous. People are so blind when they see you. They have this wild imagination and insane expectations of you.’
On the eighth strike, Potter stroked his back lightly, as if comforting and complimenting him again, and that somehow gave him the courage to continue.
‘Fuck you, Potter, seriously fuck you!’ Draco cried, ‘I hate you! Merlin, I’ll hate you forever!’
‘Yeah.’ Potter said smiling, walked up to it and stroked its feathers, talking to it softly as it looked to Draco with vigilance and distaste, ‘Shh… Buckbeak, it’s alright. He’s a friend.’
Damn that was hot.
For the first time in his life, he was courageous and reckless.
‘So early in the morning? It’s barely ten o’clock.’ Draco whined, ‘And I can’t just go talk to my boyfriend about my crush.’
‘And here’s another one from… James?’ Mother said, ‘I’ve never heard of him. A new friend of yours, Draco?’
He could feel those burning emerald eyes on him; Potter even had to swish the cane a few extra times to get rid of the excitement to make sure he still had the precision.
Crabbe was incarcerated to a stretcher, he lost a leg somehow, his face pale from blood loss, and Goyle was holding his hand through the grid; on his face was a sad but solemn expression: ‘I’ll visit you. I promise.’
‘I… I’m so sorry.’ Draco began, and the man knew he wasn’t just talking about bullying or blocking.
They focused on the parts of the wedding, talked about whether they want muggle pictures or magic pictures taken, how Potter wanted Ron to wear something similar to what Sirius was wearing, and teased Draco about he should wear a veil so Potter could lift it and kiss him under it. Draco, of course, smacked him for it.
The curtain of Potter’s apartment wasn’t drawn, but it’s not like anyone could see them, since Potter’s apartment occupied the highest floor around the neighbourhood; the full moon looked as if it were framed by the window, silver light flowed into the room like water, poured on Potter’s naked glory on the bed.
‘Your last name.’ Draco kindly supplied, ‘Since we are pretending to be in love, I should at least know your last name.’
Despite being allergic, Draco kept the flowers in his study for a long time.
Ten minutes later, Draco was sitting in an interrogation room with his wand turned in and questioned by Forgecount’s partner, a rather nervous and talkative young Auror. The youngest son of the Rosier family, Draco noticed. Alex, Allen or something. Draco couldn’t remember. A great young man, very dedicated to his job, and not a fan of the Malfoys. The Rosier family had pushed for the death penalty for all death eaters, and Draco wasn’t even in Azkaban. Despite Rosier’s mask of inexperienced and friendliness, Draco could tell he was hostile. Something was wrong.
Draco couldn’t help but laughed: ‘Merlin, I don’t know how they manage to do anything.’
But he couldn’t talk very well, all he could do was try not to cough and struggled to breath, and Draco was furious and ashamed, he shouted as his tears fell uncontrollably: ‘Then you shouldn’t do it from the beginning! All those things you did to me… I let you did to me… How could you?’
‘Yeah?’ Potter frisked him, pulled out his wand and stuffed it in his hand, ‘Hold it. Hex me if you want. Doubt it would itch.’
Potter stopped. Draco hands almost let go of the rails, he was afraid to touch the welt, so there’s nowhere they can actually go, but it’s so painful he wanted to do something escape the pain. He barely managed to hold himself, as he knew if he let go in front of the crowd, Potter would have to start the counting from the beginning.
Merry Christmas.
Draco almost went crazy at that, moaning loud, gripping the memory ball till his fingertips went white, blinking back tears to look at it. He wanted to bite his lips, but as soon as his moaning was muffled, Potter slapped his arse, hard: ‘Malfoy, Malfoy. You really don’t remember. Don’t damage my toy ——that means you. And don’t try to hold the sound.’
The stunning shine of diamonds and emeralds poured out, as inside lay an entire set, pieces of jewellery including pear-shaped pendant earrings, bracelets, anklets, silver chains, an extra set of pendants, something else, and a three-inch wide collar that was delicately designed and could pass as a simple necklace to those, not in the know. The design was elegant and exquisite, the diamonds clear and flawless, emeralds so green it reminded him of… and Draco was as much as a treasure hoarder as his name, and the jewellery immediately won his heart.
‘I’m guessing this is for my late birthday present?’ Harry asked as they walked hand in hand.
The way he suddenly switched from an angry imbecile who could barely control himself to this composed but definitely psychotic person, sent the alarms of Draco’s going off like crazy.
It wasn’t for lack of trying.
‘Um, does anyone know we are kidnapped?’ Draco asked.
Draco couldn’t help but smiled a little at that, and also, couldn’t help but think, this must be everything Potter had ever wanted, to go back to Hogwarts, the place he felt most like home, and be a teacher, to pass on the legacy of Dumbledore and Lupin.
The man got Draco’s scarf and wind coat open as he pushed Draco into the door, he kissed down Draco’s neck and spelled the door unlocked before he suddenly realised what Draco meant, and he was off Draco immediately: ‘Er, you sure about this?’
Problem number two: He couldn’t break the restraints without his wand.
Draco opened his eyes, and his Potter was there. Although what he had on were a pair of black slacks and a hideous red sweater with patterns of reindeers and slides and Christmas trees and other things Christmas. Somehow, he still pulled it off, with that and the dorky glasses, he looked nothing like the calm and ruthless Dom he was, but a nice family man that bakes delicious cookies and tells bedtime stories. He was even barefooted.
For whatever reason, he spotted his ‘Potter’ immediately.
One by one, Potter put seven balls into Draco. Each time Draco was close to orgasm, Potter stopped. Not so brute as the first time, just let Draco cool down from just a step away from his orgasm. When Draco whined and sobbed and shook like the last leaf of autumn, Potter comforted and caressed him, but he wouldn’t concede.
Harry really wasn’t that good at potions, and he wasn’t interested in sabotaging Malfoy’s grade——or couldn’t resist free-riding, depends on how one looked at it, so he mostly just sat back and watch Malfoy do the heavy lifting.
The man was sleeping so soundly that he looked like a baby in the gentle moonlight, his long eyelashes resting on his cheeks like papilio bianor. The effect of the de-aging potion had past, but Draco couldn’t help but wonder for a moment what it would be like if he was dating the man back in Hogwarts, maybe he would sneak into Gryffindor dorm at night so the man wouldn’t have nightmares anymore. His heart ached as he knew he wasn’t capable of that back then.
Draco’s heart sank to the bottom at that: ‘They didn’t know I was missing.’
But then the next strike.
And he didn’t want to think about the similar fantasy of his own, how sometimes, involuntarily, he would look at his wand and think about it was hold and cared for by Potter.
‘No other option?’
‘Have you checked the spells last used by Mr Grey?’ Draco asked.
Just trust Potter to ruin everything for him. Draco had learned that lesson.
Draco stared at him, then huffed: ‘Like I said, you can’t understand. My guess is, you couldn’t live up to her expectations of Potter.’
Contrary to its appearance of trapping the Omegas, the wall was designed to protect the Omegas' glands from being bitten and marked against their will. As the rumors of someone using the wall got around, all kinds of gossips about it went viral; one would hear a few things regardless of their lack of interest in it. Close to its abolishment, the wall was actually used by a few Omegas to protest against purity regulations and enjoy sex outside of wedlock with anonymity. Therefore, additional charms were added to ensure the Omegas were there by their choice; they could hear who was at the other side of the wall, free to leave by disappearing into the wall at any time, while the Alphas wouldn't be able to hear their moans or smell their scents and tell who they are, or force them there in any way.
He took one of the pale, slender hand in his, played it for a few seconds, letting blood stopped by the hard grip flush it, before he said: ‘Squeeze my hand if you are up for another round.’
Potter buried his hand into Draco’s hair, pulling and stroking, leaned in close, speaking softly while landing another hard blow: ‘Anything you would like to say?’
They both knew it was just what happens after an intense scene, and Draco was relieved as the man was more than understanding.
‘It’s RED.’ Draco said, ‘Obviously it’s a howler.’
Potions really was his least favourite class, even more so after Snape.
‘Please.’ Draco begged, looking up at Potter, his silver eyes vulnerable and pleading, tears filled to the brim and tainting his flushed face, as if dews on roses, ‘I want to take it —— I want to take it for you.’
Harry smiled, and reached for Draco’s hand.
To be honest, it’s the only thing he had been thinking about, really, the only thing that helped him through the pain. He tried to remember details about Potter, how his eyelashes draped over his emerald eyes when he was shy, the shade of his blush, the way he always smiled when he was truly happy, with that little dimple by his lips.
He never had the chance to look at Hogwarts and the forbidden forest in the air at night before, though he’s aware Potter did, probably quite a number of times. The castle was like a beautiful and dangerous monster, sleeping in the gentle cool night, the thousand windows of it were like its eyes, and a few were still pouring out warm yellow light, as if it still had a few eyes open in vigilance. The lake shimmered in the silver moonlight, and the forest extended for miles, everything felt like it’s asleep, except for Potter and him, and Buckbeak the hippogriff.
Draco laughed a little: ‘Your pain is my pleasure Potter.’
‘Okay…I think you are missing something here.’
Draco let out a long breath; the light in his hand, however, didn’t dissipate.
He climbed onto that tree and waited ten full minutes just for Potter to pass for reasons he didn’t understand.
Despite being stern, Potter was definitely in control of himself, as the cane struck in perfect parallel, with almost exactly the same force and interval. He was definitely a sophisticated dom. Draco was trembling at the pain, but he knew he was still given mercy.
‘I love you too.’ Draco said lightly, ‘I’ll leave you to your files then.’
‘I am your Dom.’ Potter’s voice was cold and dominating, ‘If anything you do displeases me, I’ll tell you; I’ll punish you, I’ll teach you. You please me, no one else. And Draco, I like watching you moan and writhe under my hand, my paddle, my cane. You know what I like, Draco, don’t you?’
Draco gestured to the exquisite little shop glowing warmly in the dusk, and Harry gave him one of those awkward guilty smile: ‘Not exactly? There’s something else I want to show you.’
Harry had looked at Draco intensely as Draco attended every fold of the robe and the accessories. Understandable, as Draco was fully naked save for the leather collar on his neck and cuffs on his wrists and ankles, they were connected together with chains that rattled lightly as he moved, and he had ferret ears, and a tail that Harry had spelled on him from last night, his arsehole would be leaking Harry’s cum if it weren’t for the crystal plug.
Potter was inconspicuous as ever, sitting with his back against the corner where he could get the best view of the whole room, nursing a cup of… something black, on rocks. The white shirt he was wearing was crumpled, like he had worn it and slept on a couch, probably cleaned with cleaning charms but was bad with ironing charm. His hair was wilder than usual; he must have spent an unusually long time flying, as Draco knew that’s how Potter dealt with his problems since in Hogwarts. He was rather tense, as he knew Draco was now in this club, those emerald eyes looked around from time to time, searching for Draco.
They talked about a few things that night, and that became the breaking of an invisible dam between them. They talked about something everyday. It was weird, really, because their conversation either told Draco something he had already guessed about Potter or made him acknowledge something he didn’t want to admit about Potter.
The invitation sent to him as a letter with the toys he bought so brazenly stated.
She cast a privacy and shielding charm first —— though Draco suspected that shield couldn’t even stand against Potter’s
And so Draco did.
‘Er, we never got that far.’ The man blushed in embarrassment and said lightly, ‘We um, we don’t share the same interests. She isn’t exactly the type to kneel and call me sir.’
‘I take it you are up for me tonight too.’
‘Why are you doing this?’ Draco asked, turning to Potter, the lights in his silver eyes quivering, ‘Why are you trusting me, I am the one who got the tracking powder on you. Why did you post my bail, and why are you inviting me into your house? To a walk?’
‘He’s got good reasons.’ Someone else sighed, ‘That sub colours easy. Bet he has a low threshold for pain. Emerald was not the cruel kind like you anyway. He’s more of the caring kind.’
