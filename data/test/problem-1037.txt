A particularly loud gasp and an unstable sway of Malfoy's hips brought Harry's attention back to his companion in peril. The whole boy was shaking now and by the sound of it, he had real trouble breathing.
here. Today. He just,” Draco faltered for a moment, “had something to finish at the castle. Also, he wasn't
” They heard a few clanking noises from upstairs and then a square object swished into the room, landing in Draco's hand. “Here.” Draco felt very silly. “It's not wrapped and it's not quite finished. I forgot about you before... anyway, Merry Christmas, Potter.” It was a relief being finally able to say those words.
Looking over at the desk, Draco decided that he didn't feel like working anymore tonight. He stretched his arms over his head. All this sitting (and Harry) would ruin his back someday.
Pansy wrinkled her nose. The floor was dirty here, but the walls were too bumpy. Maybe one of the boys' backs? But what if it smudged because those dimwits couldn't stand still? No, floor it was.
“Yet the whisper became a shout in the ears of the bigots and it came the morning that an armada of fishing boats crossed the horizon and we knew they were carrying war on the tips of their harpoons.”
Draco eyed the old house-elf that had popped up next to the large window warily. He vaguely remembered seeing him once at the Manor. On Death Eater business.
(Now, here's something to think about – which came first? Trelawney's prophecy, Voldemort selecting Harry as his rival or Berchthold selecting Harry as Voldemort's best opponent? ...chicken&egg... self-fulfilling prophecy anyone?)
him): Neither of the two big, broad boys were exactly on the same page with Draco, intelligence-wise. So while he undoubtedly enjoyed being followed around by them like puppies, it was sometimes a bit boring in their company and he liked it better when he was in more stimulating circles. The other Slytherins (like Pansy) would make better companions, but because of
“He's definitely cool,” Seeker agreed and he finally grinned. “So you better not try anything forget-me-ish again. That way I can leave here without regrets when Draco comes to save me.”
There were mixed groups of odd folk, each huddled around a little camp fire, strewn in a wide ring around Harry's waking place. The gathered persons came in different shapes and sizes, but they all had in common that they were loud and boisterous, easily changing circles while Harry, Snowdrop and Lightning tried weaving their way through them, their horses and carts.
“Mhm? Yeah, that's right,” responded Wolfe sluggishly. She was sitting with her legs crossed and eyes closed while Half was trying to braid some new daffodils into her hair (emphasis on
“I wasn't finished!” Harry firmly pushed Draco back into the pillow. “That's what I have thought about you for a long time. But then the war came and I saw you struggling and while at the time I mostly figured you deserved it, the tiniest drop of pity had mingled with my dislike. I know, that doesn't sound very romantic, but it wasn't back then. I'm simply trying to explain to you how it came to be that I would rather have a non-verbal, less-clothed conversation with you right this moment than convince you of my genuine feelings for you. But I guess things between us were never easy, so why would this be?”
Mr. Ollivander's moon-like eyes shone amused through the dimness of the store. “You mean the most powerful connection you were talking about? If you ask me, it's a matter of the heart; it's not the wand, that is for sure. But I would guess there's not
“Brr, it's freezing.” The Weasel huffed milky-white breaths and jumped from foot to foot. That the ginger was standing right beneath a hiking route sign reading
Without preamble she had come in, sat down across him and declared that Harry Bloody Potter, War Hero Par Excellence, was going to be witness for the defence, because (she had used air-quotes here) “it's the right thing” and that poor, helpless Draco should just state the facts, be remorseful, stick to the sob story of a misguided child, appear pitiful (no problem there, incarceration did nothing for Draco's looks) and let Potter handle the rest.
As soon as they were down the passageway, Hermione drew closer to Ron and whispered: “So, is there anything on the paper?”
Harry felt like he could do with a bit of alcohol about now, even though he'd never really had any before. He scanned the table. “I don't see any wine.”
about his trust in Harry that he followed him into a dangerous place, at night, sightless and without the whole puzzle at his disposal yet. Harry wanted to kiss him badly.
Draco blushed and diverted. “Well, I'd be delighted to attend.” He cleared his throat. “Thank you for the invitation... and congratulations.”
“Great,” Weasley said with a huff, “that only leaves a hundred plus books in here that you've read at one point or another.”
Throughout this celebration of life and laughter, the proverbial ghosts of the dead were sitting among them all.
Her previously empty basket was full of fruit and other harvest yield, which she handed out generously among the riders (although they noticed she gave more to girls than guys).
“Instead of arguing, could we maybe try to get out of here first? Wherever here is. And then we could, I don't know, talk about what just happened in there?”
Draco reacted on instinct. He dropped to the ground, hands covering his eyes. “Potter! Get down! It's The Wild Hunt! Don't look!
It was still cold. But with the wind having died down and a dozen warming charms in place, they sat rather comfortably on top of the White Cliffs. Harry was leaning against a broad boulder and Draco rested between his legs, his back to Harry's front.
“Hey, you two! Stop planning crimes in our living room!” Hermione cut in and with lots of banter the four of them went back to their Christmas preparations.
Except that nothing happened when the other boy tried various spells to turn first the whole table and then different things on it into a broom.
It had been a one-time thing, at first. Professor Sprout had roped him into helping with the reorganisation of the green houses while they had chatted. But soon Draco had found that that had been fun and had felt right.
“Oh, er, that, oh Harry, we're so sorry! We just, we didn't remember you and and, oh God,” the young woman stammered, fumbling with the ring.
“Only if sitting by the lake qualifies as such.” It was supposed to be cheeky, but Harry felt himself flush. Date. Why did Malfoy have to phrase it like that? And why couldn't Harry ever back down?
“Okay.” Harry furrowed his brows. “Then why are you so fidgety? You're spacing out. It's not like you.”
“Misat?” Seeker slurred. He'd been in such a nice dream. He couldn't remember the details, but someone had been singing to him softly in words he hadn't been able to understand but had known they meant love.
“There, there.” Helplessly rubbing soothing circles onto the unfortunate boy's back, Harry did his best to be calming and grounding. “It's okay, shh.”
and humiliated himself like that to spring Harry free, but also by the fact that the Slytherin had such a pleasant singing voice, despite a shaking slightly in the beginning. Harry'd heard him mock-sing
Draco blinked several times rapidly. The Weasel had said Draco was 'alright', Longbottom wanted to play Quidditch together and Finnigan was offering a truce. Yep, definitely dead.
Harry wanted to ask, but was distracted by the extraordinary sight of Dormarth, the dog, turning into Holle, the hag, in a cloud of fog. The old crone had landed next to Berchthold and now stood up straight, dusting her apron. As he watched, he noticed something he hadn't before: Berchthold's horseman's boots were
“It was – supposed – to be – a surprise. George’s – idea.” Came a wheezing from the entry, making Draco hastily drop his hold on Hermione. Ronald, pyjama top carelessly stuffed into his trousers, leaned against the door frame, panting.
During his school days, Draco had never set foot into the Hogwarts kitchens. However, being a Patcher had quickly made him familiar with the vicinity.
“Yes, sometimes. But then I think that Vincent and the others would want me to be happy, so I try my hardest to be alive – for them.” Longbottom nodded solemnly and Draco forced a smile. “And not everyone who's dead is unhappy. Look at the ghost lot over there.”
“Let's try it then? And if I fall, you're there to catch me." It was supposed to be mocking but somehow came out serious.
“Malfoy,” Potter whispered awestruck and pulled gently on Draco's left ear, so he would turn his head, “look. What a thick black cloud that is! And how fast it comes! Why, I do believe it's got wings!”
Harry, writing text onto a Christmas card, didn't even look up. “I'm going to send it to my aunt and uncle.” He took the Knut, clearly deep in thought. “And maybe a protein shake for Dudley?”
“This is our phone. As I explained to you before, it works somewhat like a Floo call: You can talk to someone who is far away. Now, you hold it like so,” she demonstrated putting the thing next to her face and Draco cringed, because if it was like Floo the flames would certainly burn him this way, “one end towards your mouth, one towards your ear. And then you just talk.”
“No wait, before you answer that: time for a snack!” The ginger then proceeded with getting a little shrunken cake-box out of his pocket and enlarging it between them. “Ta-dah! I made it!” Potter's Weasel beamed proudly at Draco until uncertainty crept in. “What now? Do you think I can't bake a cake? I'll have you know that I studied cooking and stuff after our little camping trip to hell last year.” He shot Granger a tender look. “I'll never take it for granted again that someone else provides food for me,” he said, turning back to Draco. “So you can wipe your disgust off your face, Malfoy, my treacle tart is delicious, it is!”
Tillie shook her head, her bat-like ears flapping restlessly. She pressed Harry to her chest. “Dolly! Tillie's dolly!”
are you doing here?” said a new, harsh voice and Draco felt a hard, pointy something pushing into his spine. “Turn around, slowly.”
“Course you knew, after all, you two,” Harry's eyes went from one to the other, as he put together the puzzle pieces in his mind, “are two sides of the same coin – death and life.”
“There are hundreds,” affirmed the leader and waved her hand. “First let's have a look at your bruises though. Those look painful."
Replaying the scene in the bedroom earlier, Harry blushed. Coming to the realisation that he indeed had completely lost it for
Draco cursed himself inwardly and quickly cast a warming spell on the underdressed boy, while rushing forward to wrap his own winter cloak around Potter's shoulder.
“Can you not hear me?” He tentatively placed a hand on the man's upper arm and got exactly zero reaction. “Don't you feel this?” He tried to squeeze, but it was as if there were a thin layer of protection between them making it impossible for Seeker to truly connect with the man.
However: “Not laughing at all. You guys are a perfect match. Seriously, mates, I'm happy for you.” And then there had been lots of hugging.
Gathering speed, Draco's voice rose: “You're never going back to Hogwarts. Ever. You vanish there and get nearly killed or actually killed. I forbid it! You're not going.” He crossed his arms in front of his chest.
Half and Seeker had had several snowball duels by now. Ember and Dreamer were inseparable, always guarded by grumpy Scoffer. Wolfe was singing. BraveHeart was excited. Things had got to a point where they had a normalcy feeling to them for Seeker. He'd even got used to the cold.
Frowning, the ghost crossed his arms in front of his chest. “I cannot possibly fathom what you would want with them and I have certainly no inclination to talk about that frivolous group.”
(=imagination). I would like to answer this discrepancy with two quotes. The first by Sirius' Resurrection Stone ghost: “We are part of you. Invisible to anyone else.” And the second by Xenophilius Lovegood: “That's a children's tale.” Conclusion: The tale is just a tale and Hermione's right about the Stone's powers.
Hermione blinked once in surprise to Potter's choice of seat, then cleared her throat. “You must understand, after The Wild Hunt took you, we all sort of forgot about you.”
Some of the work couldn't be done by one person alone though, which had led to several awkward and/or uncomfortable reunions with old schoolmates. Oh well.
“Good morning to you, too, Malfoy,” was the girl's reply and she made to push past him, her boyfriend in tow, as if Draco had invited them in instead of producing incoherent stammering.
Birth, eh? Here, Harry arched an eyebrow. Holle sounded much cooler on paper, but what had Half/Fred said?
As my lovely beta had a busy week, I had to try my best without them. So if you find spelling errors, way too long sentences or logic mistakes, then, yes, that's all on me ^^°
“I, as the younger sister, was so keen on proving myself that I swam right up to the shore, hiding behind a rock in the swell. I was curious. I'd never seen humans so up close.”
Potter frowned and turned to lie on his side. His hand slid down to catch Draco's, interlacing their fingers. “Why would you say that?” he asked slowly, uncertain.
you. Just... a more civilised version of you. Someone who's not a complete nightmare to be stuck here with.”
The unspoken accusation hovered between them and Draco felt the need to lean back slightly. Maybe this hadn't been such a good idea after all.
While he had been sleeping better these last days in the old Black house than the whole past year, the worry about not finding Potter kept him jumping out of bed at night, looking for more clues in the mountains of books and papers that cluttered his new library.
'And Potter', he silently added. He was getting impatient with the litany (even though it was really interesting). And he was going to have Potter spill all the details about this craziness with the Resurrection Stone; later.
He shrugged and tucked the handkerchief back in, not noticing that on his string-bracelet, a second knot had turned red. One knot closer to death.
Also the handkerchief that Draco had given him for his birthday last year. It wasn't as pristine as it once had been, but it surely had served Harry well in reminding him of its former owner.
The owl unfolded her wings and slowly glided over to Harry. He extended his arm and she perched on his wrist.
Irritated, Harry sat up. He had half a mind to pull Malfoy's hair again. “What I'm 'going with' is that people get killed because of, of blood nonsense! Something they aren't even responsible for! And you stand there and feel for Murcus but refuse to admit that that's like six of one and half a dozen of the other!”
. Thomas, in high spirits, had decided to join them and was in the process of pulling a bristling Draco up with him, when suddenly Mrs. Norris jumped onto Draco's lap, nestling in his ropes.
“Oh, shut up, you!” Harry grinned and shrugged him off. “Yes, let's go home. But before that, I want to drop in on the others, real quick.”
In the meantime, the redhead had also unfolded his 'letter'. “Is this...?” Disbelievingly he looked at Draco like the latter was a wonder. “But how did you do it?”
His tendency to destroy trees though made the happiness with which moss folk re-planted them come in very handy.
A feeling which had increased dramatically after their run-in at the park (during which Harry'd already been usually flirty, for he had instantly felt
Getting unto his tiptoes Harry peeked into his cup and found it empty. It was terribly weird to be so
“Well, to go and borrow books, of course. Take them home and read them, then return them. That way, you don't have to buy them,” explained Granger in a teacher-voice.
His legs gave out before he even reached the door and he crumbled to the floor. His predominant feeling at this embarrassment should have been being flustered but all he felt was dread. He had tried to face the past, but it still wasn't easy to relive certain events. Especially when they came unexpectedly.
Harry felt weirdly offended by the assessment, but Malfoy had seemingly given up trying to bring sense into the conversation. He simply turned his head so that now his cheek was resting on the plate instead and he was facing Alice. “How do you know I'm mad?”
About twenty minutes later, Draco was joined by a dishevelled but distinctively happier looking couple.
The moment he was done, the blond boy snapped his mouth shut and glared at the three house-elves who had listened raptly and were now breaking out in loud cheers.
This room had been the thing to really draw him in. While he had felt the homey atmosphere of the inside of the building itself, it had been this very sleeping chamber that had pinged something in Draco's heart. Earlier he had only had a quick peek but still, he had felt an instant pull. If Draco had to describe it, he would say it was a bit like a faint fragrance, as if someone with a nice perfume had just left the room.
Draco's features softened immediately. He already missed the warmth and feeling of Potter's body and so he reached out without thinking, wrapping his fingers around Potter's wrist which earned him a raised eyebrow.
Harry smirked. “I rather enjoy that you are in my house, Draco, and yes, I stand by what I said: I like everything about you. Even when you are prickly and difficult, like now.”
always wonder how it was possible for you to not figure it out even though you were certainly watching me closely for years.”
“You mean, aside from you?” Harry quickly ducked to escape Malfoy's hand, ready to smack him across the head. He smirked tiredly. “Sorry, you were saying?”
With a deep breath, hands curled into fists, he started his usual round. By now, he knew every name and everyone's story. He walked down the line, looking at each of the crosses in turn, nodding to them and greeting them like old friends.
“Nevermind, that's fine,” allowed Lacie, while Tillie started chanting: “Comfits, comfits, comfits.”
As Muggles could hardly send Draco an owl, Granger had agreed to hand out the Weasel and her foh-n number for the purpose.
Draco had never actually spoken to Sir Nicholas and thus he knew that he should be polite, but the words simply tumbled out of his mouth. “I need to find the Headless Hunt. Do you know where it is?”
“You weren't wrong about what you said,” Warrington explained, while Parkinson reluctantly signed her name onto the contract, “but you forgot one thing: Slytherins are real friends; that's our house' secret motto.” He smirked. “And now you know and won't be able to tell anyone.”
Other than lying in Draco's bed, staring at the opposite wall, where Draco had hung a huge world map and colour-coded countries and information, strings going up and down the globe, connecting pins.
“Seeker!” Wolfe shrieked, all glee draining from her face. “That would equal her dying! How could you say something like that?”
There was a pause before the other boy answered. “I'm hiding. Parties... parties are not really great for me at the moment. But I wanted to come to honour Hogwarts and the Patchers.”
Draco had been a bit surprised when neither of his parents had tried to make him go with them. His mother had smiled sadly and kissed him on both cheeks. His father had simply patted him on the back. And then they had left.
A goose honk made him flinch and he craned his neck to confirm that indeed Holle had taken on her Dormarth dog-ish form. In that case, he'd better hurry.
Berchthold's silence settled over their little spot, louder than the thunder before. Then the leader of The Wild Hunt unmounted, his burning feet extinguishing when he touched the ground. With big steps he came to stand before Harry and Draco, towering over both of them. He was frightening.
Where is he? What did Potter do to him?” She grabbed the front of Hermione's cloak and shook her. “Where is Draco?”
“A door or entrance to a staircase. I saw it on the map and then it was gone. When we can find the entry, maybe we can find out what happened to Harry and Malfoy.”
“This is so weird,” whispered Cassius, voicing exactly what Pansy was thinking. “I mean, I know that you're there,” he said to a spot of air, “but it's still strange not to see you and all.”
“Did I miss something?” BraveHeart landed next to Seeker and wiped some sweat off his forehead, startling his friend out of his reverie.
at least could read the room. “Good night, you two. Come by when you've settled everything, Tomorrow or the day after. There is no rush.”
Draco, who had tried to produce edibles after a fashion since the end of the war, would have never dreamt of picking up a book like this. He was definitely more a crook than a cook, haha.
. Considering that you two do very much look alike, that was an honest mistake.” Holle took this moment to peck him at the shoulder; it looked like a scolding.
“I said stop, you plonker!” Draco shoved at Potter's shoulder which finally got him an annoyed grunt.
Here, under the branches, the air was still chilly and a smell of petrichor told of the rainfall earlier this morning.
“I don't need your protection.” He smoothed his hair. “Nor your handsyness. Get a grip, Potter, but not on me.”
“Don' you dare talk about Dad!” Greg roared, suddenly jumping at Draco who wasn't fast enough and landed painfully on his back, his friend's long gorilla arms pinning him down. Greg pulled his wand and pointed it at Draco's face. “You lot went scot-free! You cosied up to Mudbloods and that filth! You don' get to tell me what to do no more! Not you!”
it was too late. Huginn-Muninn here, the old softie, even granted you her crown with Somewhen Things and allowed the moss folk to give you hints about your life – to present  you with something worth living for. Worked, too, I'd say: When you came to us you were somewhat broken, but slowly you got better. We saw it every day. Also,” he wiggled his eyebrows, “we had high hopes for our secret weapon: Draco, don't you want to take off that cloak already?”
Warrington nudged his fellow Slytherin. “Well, would be weird to use mean words against Granger here, when she's the leader in whatever-this-is, right?”
“So,” Harry hemmed, trying to gloss over the awkward moment, “how exactly do we know each other? Because I think I hit my head. Sorry, but I can't really remember you. Or me for that matter.”
Rounding the table, Malfoy was not listening. “It's about our way out – and more ridiculously, about me –, so I have a right to throw my hat in the ring.”
Meanwhile, Harry's kidnapper turned out to be a house-elf as well. Apparently dressed in nothing but a long, matted wig of ash-blond hair that had luckily tangled in all the right places to hide certain bits of the wrinkly body. Tillie had to be very old.
It was a good in though. “Actually, I have some presents to hand out as well,” Draco said, earning him several raised eyebrows. Okay, yeah, he wasn't known for generosity but could they maybe be a bit less surprised? Gee.
Grumbling expletives about dirt and Harry and crazy house-elves and Harry, Malfoy got up just when the dim light from above was cut off with a screeching kind of sound: apparently had the barrel been pushed back to its original place.
in colour. Dozens of moving snapshots – some small, some big – hung between the rhinestones, all of which showed scenes of Harry and Malfoy's interactions: There was their first meeting at Madam Malkin's, their duel in Duelling Club, a pretend-injured Malfoy ordering Harry around in Potions, the POTTER-STINKS-badges reveal, Harry staring at Malfoy from across the Great Hall during dinner, Harry staring at Malfoy during Slytherin Quidditch practice, Malfoy staring at Harry instead of studying the night sky in Astronomy class, Malfoy staring at Harry in–
But there'll be lots of Draco's dry humour and false Potter-names in the next chapter! So, look forward to that.
into the overall leader, because they like to tell stories that are dark and frightening,” Death grinned dreadfully. “They want to believe what they want to believe.”
“She died in my arms. With her last breath she gave me the return gift for my 'heart', made me promise to take care of them. We had been waiting so long...”
“What's wrong with her?” hissed Malfoy who'd finally given up on the wishing experiment. “Why is she talking like that?”
“Hello?” Draco called into the stifling silence and was answered with more silence. “Is anybody here? Mr. Ollivander?”
He sighed and strolled over to the window. Outside, the snow was gleaming innocently in the light of the street lanterns.
He frowned. Holle was surely one of the aliases of the crone from The Wild Hunt. Why was that name in a Muggle storybook?
His gaze went to the other female in the group. “Blimey, Harry, you look smart!” Hermione in her little black dress beamed at him and went in for a hug.
That surprised his interlocutor. “Yes. But how did you know? You really are more than meets the eye.”
And with that she rushed forward to kiss a floundering Harry on both cheeks, while in the Entrance Hall on the opposite side of the portal, a hilariously hideous portrait of a goofy-faced Harry was unveiled and people started 'ooh'ing and clapping.
The boy at the barn. The boy with the storm eyes. The boy, Seeker had been so desperately trying to go back to.
Aha. Harry's dearest wish was a dragon. Not a nice unicorn maybe or a way back home, nope,  a fire-spewing monster. Awesomesauce.
Draco stared. Stared at the seventeen-year-old across from him, stared at the teenager who had fought a war and defeated a mass-murderer, stared at the legend he had heard stories about since he could remember, stared at The Boy Who Lived, who had been famous before he could walk and talk, who Draco had been so very sure was living the best life at home... Draco stared at a lonely child, neglected by his elders and for the first time in all their shared history the true impact of Draco's own needling hit him with full force. He had enviously picked on a boy who he had thought to have everything and who in reality had had nothing at all.
Ah, there she was! As she'd always been: A small cloud of gentle brightness and in its centre a young woman with floating soft hair bathed in light and shrouded in feelings of purpose and novelty. Seeker knew her to be Holle and not Holle at the same time.
She plugged out one of the white feathers that dotted her wing tips like snowflakes and gave it to Harry. The moment it touched his hand the plume sizzled and turned into a snow-white piece of rectangular cardboard. It was blank.
“Can't we go five seconds without fighting?” Granger's voice sounded so annoyed Pansy could imagine her put-off expression. “It's a great plan though, Ron. Go on then.”
Wolfe's eyes were red-rimmed and she snivelled. “The little one isn't dead like us and it isn't old enough to willingly come like you. It doesn't belong with The Hunt. We can't take it. It's fate. The baby will sleep until it dies. It will be peaceful.”
“Fine,” she said flippantly, examining her nails as she spoke. “According to the rules, safe zones are either under flax stalks (good luck finding those in the forest). Or you can create hiding spots by cutting one to three crosses into a hollow tree trunk with your axe while saying
Draco's thoughts wandered as he soaked in the sunshine. He had missed walking. Back, after his parents left for France, Draco had used to hike a lot. But these days, he found himself much too busy to engage in simple strolling most of the time.
Seeker's gaze went to Half who was awkwardly standing to the side, looking torn. “I want to hear that from
Draco felt very much made fun of as his feelings were brutally hurt. He started to sit up. “You know–”
while  brushing his teeth and then snuggled into bed. Right, the mantra: Potter, green eyes, stupid glasses, black bird's nest, fondness of treacle tart.
was their newest project: a non-addictive instant mood-lifter. “I'm here for a present. Something fun but not tasteless.”
“It means, haha, it means, you are a magic doer, Seeker! Sunday Children are those born with magic,” BraveHeart tee-heed out of breath.
The Hunt lifted into the air, following its leader Berchthold and left Holle's Pond and the surrounding mountains behind, small like toys.
“Ah, yes, true, The Hunt is riding.” The old merman nodded solemnly. “Better not to have humans wander in the storm tonight. Did you think of sending them through the pipes?”
There was a pause and then Harry heard the scrapping of a chair, being dragged over the stony floor. Malfoy had sat down next to him, under a straw hat with a red hat band. “No, he would come anyway. That's how elves are wired. I presume he can't hear you down here. But,” Malfoy stopped, only to continue with a pressed voice, as if it physically pained him to say the following, “it was not the worst plan. To have him get help and tell someone where to find us.”
She was a woman now and Harry often wondered if maybe soon she would expect him to do something about that. Yet while they had resumed their relationship after The Battle of Hogwarts, between grieving and dealing and picking up broken pieces, there hadn't been much space for romance in Harry's mind. So the few times they had seen each other alone since had been uneventfully filled with cuddling above all else.
His fingers followed the words while his eyes darted rapidly from line to line. No Potter. Not a single word about him. In fact, the text made it seem as if no one in particular was responsible for the Dark Lord's downfall. It was as if all of that had just
Everyone had thought the jumpers hilarious and Mother Weasley had been manifold congratulated on her clever handiwork.
“What was that, Ferret?” Without warning the mood had changed and a red-faced redhead clenched his fists at an equally pumped-up Draco.
Pensively, he traced the silvery lines on the back of his hand: with the new meaning of bravery, his Umbridge-caused scars weren't as bad anymore either. Maybe... The Hunt had been good for him, in a way?
So, what now? Where could he go to find assistance if no one recalled the person they were supposed to help?
“Hilarious!” squeaked BraveHeart breathlessly and then turned towards the horses. “Ember! Half brought marshmallows! Even the green ones that you like so much!”
“Fine,” Draco croaked. But he felt like shit. He had to tell them. Not that he particularly wanted to, but for Potter's sake, he would. He gulped in a lungful of air. “I'm fine. But I, that is,” he closed his eyes, “I can't go back into the Manor. I just, I can't. I can tell you were to go, but you'll have to go without me.”
An old sadness tucked at Harry thinking of the loved ones he'd lost. So Sirius had literally fallen into the underworld, all those years back at the Ministry. The archway must therefore be the stolen piece of Holle's Pond and that's why the pond had had a Somewhen glow for Harry. Even the whispering added up now; whispers behind the veil, bell chimes out of the pond. They were connected...somehow.
“I'm not going in there.” Draco crossed his arms in front of his chest, but uncrossed them right away to pluck Potter from the water and put him back onto his head. The soaking feeling of water running down his strands was nasty. Draco pointed his wand blindly at Potter's direction and blew a Hot Air Charm at the Gryffindor.
(as His Majesty had put it) and appearances, Draco spent most of his time with the Dork Duo. Which was exactly the problem, since he was supposed to have a useful connection to them because of their families, but not get too friendly with them. His father would be appalled should Draco ever refer to them by their first names... even though he'd like to. After all, they
Harry felt himself go red for two very different reasons. “Why would you even–? No, answer this first: You are supposed to be sleeping at all times. How can you stalk Malfoy when you're asleep?”
“I, er,” Draco, between being squeezed and shaken was grabbing for words. It was sweet to see him unpretentious for once, earning praise for a work well done that he'd
When the filthy Quidditch player was almost out of the library, Draco called after him: “Have you eaten?”
“Nothing! What's with the accusation, Potter?” Malfoy really tried to sound indignant, but he evaded Harry's gaze and stubbornly stared at the other side of the room.
“Like my ass then, eh? I hope you got a good look because you'll never have that pleasure again,” Malfoy sneered, but he wouldn’t meet Harry's eyes.
was the one enduring hardship in this new position; when Harry was the one who had to support both their weights like this.
“If it's any consolation: It was quite spontaneous,” Draco offered, which gained him a nonplussed stare.
“It's a bit more complicated than that. You must know, among other things, Perchta is the guardian of crossroads. While most members of The Hunt really are deceased, we are, for one reason or the other, not yet ready to let go of this world. But people out there die and when they do, they cross over into the netherworld. Or at least that's how we understand it,” she looked at the boys for reinforcement and was graced with nods.
“Over there,” said Ember quietly, shifting their attention to a farmhouse coming quickly closer. Nightfall had come by now and all windows of the thatched roofed building were glowing islands in the dark.
“Not now, there isn't. But there was.” Lacie lazily flapped a hand at the well's wall. “They is out there now, all of them. It has seen them, surely.”
The room erupted in laughter. A bloody ball that reminded you when you forgot something! The irony! Furthermore, what a fun throwback present – Longbottom's Remembrall and Potter's first flight were their shared history after all.
They had been flying inside the storm for a while, hunting The Beginning, until the prey had disappeared and with it, the light and the game, leaving only open sea and a gentle breeze that had lulled Harry into slumber.
What his eyes found though, made him inhale sharply and he took an involuntary step back. Impossible.
“Now, now, Draco, that's cheating,” said Queen Harry in a deadly calm tone as he got to his feet himself. “I won that chess piece. He's mine. Give him to me, please.” He reached out a hand, palm up. “Hand him over and we can continue our game. Look, you've almost won. Don't you want to win against me?”
“It's gone. It disappeared when you accepted 'Seeker' as your new name, the day you burned your jumper,” Wolfe revealed unhappily.
Mouth agape, Harry stared and then stared some more. Eventually, he turned to Draco who looked just as dumbfounded. That was
Draco yawned and his eyes fell onto the still untouched stack of goodies in front of him. Breakfast time!
I came up with this: Muchness is having enough. If it's the right thing, on tiny bit is enough; then you have much.
By that time, another round of drinks was served by house-elves and Draco remarked in a low voice that Hermione would have quite a bit to say about overworking and fairness, which earned him a choking Finnigan and a cheerful Longbottom explaining that the house-elves were participating on their own free will and had turned down
“And that’s a real shame,” Malfoy resumed, “because coming in here that first morning after the Sorting and seeing the lake through this window… It’s marvellous during the daytime: The sunlight weaves turquoise patterns and you can watch the creatures living inside, sometimes even the giant squid. You have to see it, Potter.” His eyes were unusually sparkly and he looked younger somehow. Until he turned back to Harry with a frown. “But maybe you did… recently... why are you soaking? Use your magic, will you?” He flicked his wand at Harry, drying off the latter’s clothes.
he protested, but it wasn't heartfelt. He was giddy. Draco was not giving up on him. Everything was going to be okay.
The other boy glared at them, seemingly undecided which path to choose. Just then a loud clamour from the left side of the forest told them that the game most likely was over and Seeker's team had won once again.
Before closing the door behind himself, Harry cast a final gaze at the reassuring rise and fall of his boyfriend's chest.
name yet!” After the short reprieve at the pond's shore, Harry felt once again overwhelmed by the turn of unexpected events following in quick succession.
Within seconds, his indifferent mask crashed splintering to the floor, leaving him gaping at no other than Hermione Granger and a grumpy looking Weasel hidden half behind her.
Draco had hoped that with the promising amount of references to The Hunt in several books from the three libraries, they would make fast progress and have Potter home for dinner time. However, the longer the research took the more Draco had realised that it wouldn't be so easy after all. Stories about The Hunt were strewn all over, some in unreadable griffonage, some in foreign languages. He dealt with the French ones and Granger had some ideas about others here and there, but they all stumbled over German texts that were few and far between for the apparent reason that the fable of The Hunt seemed to have been first written down by famous Muggle fairy tale teller Jacob Grimm (a fact that had earnt Draco a suspicious glance from the redhead). Draco's stomach churned at the thought of Potter all alone with blood-thirsty horror characters in a group of ghosts. Nothing to be done now though. Potter would take care of himself somehow. Draco had to believe that and work towards his rescue as fast as possible – even if that meant starting at snail's pace at the moment.
Potter, of course, had no such restrictions and was loudly whistling his approval. He also snivelled, the softie.
This story is for all the great writers out there that made life more bearable when things were bad this year, especially GallaPlacidia, WouldItWere and Ladderofyears. Thank you!
Don't you want to be a darling and run down to the kitchens to get some?” She fluttered her eyelashes.
Greg's small dull eyes bore into Draco's. “I don'... Who's Plebs?” Right, Greg didn't remember Potter. Bloody inconvenient.
It was an April afternoon and the weather had decided to be stormy, rainy and wholly unpleasant. Draco cumbersomely folded his umbrella and knocked. He was right on time.
“Divide the group,” he told Half and turned to BraveHeart at his side. “Do you still have the flag?”
Miraculously, Draco's presence had not caused even the slightest commotion. Dressed his best and nerves raw, he had come early, expecting to have to argue his way in. Yet Mother Weasley (clearly on the lookout) had dashed over the second he'd arrived and from then on he'd been handed from one family member to the next until finally his aunt had shown up and taken pity on him. Draco had apprehensively taken over Teddy-watch, carefully cradling the infant in his arms, so Aunt Andromeda could go and be very,
“The Wild Hunt,” Draco said breathlessly, “I need to find them and I thought that the Headless Hunt would be able to point me in the right direction as they are also a ghostly hunting party. But you probably know where I have to look?”
– and held my hands and held my gaze and said she didn't regret anything and that we would find our Yonder Hill.”
She smiled watery. “Yeah, you were. But you don't have to apologise. I believed what I wanted to believe. ...same as with the Dark Lord. You know, we eavesdropped on your conversation with Greg earlier,” (“Of course you did.”) “and... it's hard to accept and I don't know yet if I'm really willing to change my views, but I will think about what you said. About blood status and all that.”
“Alright, we'll tell you what we know. But we'll need a quill, ink and some parchment first. Maybe in one of the classrooms–”
Potter, oblivious idiot that he was, had meanwhile picked up the dropped object of offence and handed it to his patching partner. “Here.”
Trotting along after Potter, Draco felt a vague pinch of nostalgia bubbling up inside him. Hadn't it always been fun to play Quidditch against the Saviour? Draco smirked to himself. Especially those times when Potter had got into trouble. Good old days.
Maybe it had been Harry's inner restlessness that had made him go. He'd been edgy ever since the occurrences surrounding the de facto death of Dumbledore's Army with the escape of said Dumbledore from Hogwarts and the resulting ascendency of a certain pink toad.
“I think she was right,” Potter finally said, sitting up carefully and rubbing at his eyes. “I wanted a relationship so badly that I overlooked all the signs that this one didn't fulfil me. Maybe.” He cleared his throat. “Thanks for listening and, er, sorry I was such an idiot earlier. I guess I needed an outlet and there you were and... I shouldn't have though. Really, I'm sorry, Malfoy.” He smiled a tiny smile.
“I guess there never really was in the first place.” A single tear trickled down Pansy's cheek and she quickly wiped it off. “I thought that if I only gave you time, you would come back to me. But you never really were
Death's expression was cold. “I come from battle and conflict. The world of the living doesn't concern me.”
Having returned from The Hunt, Harry had realised that he had picked up Auroring after school for two reasons: 1) He hadn't had any better ideas and 2) he had been feeling guilty and had tried to remedy that by attempting future saves where he hadn't been able to in the past.
A deafening thunderclap made them both jump. And suddenly the air was filled with noise, terrible, screeching, maddening noise: rattling, screaming, hooting, yelling, wailing, groaning and grunting from a hundred throats. Followed by alluringly wild melodies and the din of thousands of sweet silver bells.
Pausing in dusting off his clothes, Malfoy turned to Harry to exaggeratedly roll his eyes. “Yes, you're a genius, Potter. Now, pray tell, how do we get out of here? Fly up?”
He hesitated only a second then straightened his back. “Yes, that would be very kind of you,” he said, proceeding in stepping in between the three Weasleys and into the fox den.
After a moment, the others joined in the guffaw and when they finally had calmed down, their faces were red and happy.
“Recipes,” beamed Dobby. When they all looked at him funny, he added: “Mistress Hufflepuff was a great chef. All her recipes are in there. And some other things.” Suddenly he pricked his ears. “Winky is calling me. Does Miss Hermione still need Dobby? Dobby will come back when Miss Hermione calls.”
Earlier that night, how could he have known that he would run into Peeves, preparing one of his elaborate pranks for tomorrow? Harry had had to take the long way round to the classroom and by the time he had emerged, reverberating sounds had chimed ten o'clock and announced the start of the curfew.
?” Ron had a hand pressed to his racing heart and Hermione found that she had subconsciously grabbed for Ron's other arm and quickly let it go.
A most outlandish looking woman gazed down at him, her clothes rustling lightly in the icy breeze. Her physique was somewhat small (Harry guessed he would be taller than her when standing), yet her sheer presence was so humongous that it drowned out everything else around her. Even the sounds seemed to dim while Harry's gaze travelled upwards: from half-boots that looked overgrown by moss, over a pure-white Tracht dress and an equally white apron with a somewhat ragged hem under an alabaster fur coat with gilt rimming, up to her cow horns and leafy crown on her silvery hair, falling down to her waist which was belted with an iron chain. Her face was old and wrinkly with a prominent bird-like nose, yet her eyes seemed almost glowing and drew Harry in, even more so than her iron crescent moon maang tikka. She could have been mistaken for a snowwoman in all her whiteness if not for the pitch-black wings sprouting from her back.
“Mistress Hufflepuff's Tea Room?” Suddenly Dobby's mood seemed to perk up. “Well, that's something else entirely. Dobby can get you information on that.”
“Not very flattering,” Draco grumbled, yet he felt his heart swell. If he didn't want it to end up broken though, it was time to change tactics. “But alright, let's say it's true and not just a figment of your imagination – not sold on that one yet –, but let's assume it is so; how can you be sure I won't just accept your advances because you're
Draco's heart pounded in his chest. Could it be? After all this time? “And would you... be willing to help me contact this Sir Patrick?” He held his breath and prayed.
Most astonishingly were the coincidental connections to the Harry Potter universe. The Deathly Hallows as Holle's doing? Yeah, I invented that connection, but the base was set by lore. She really is guardian of the treasures of the earth interior (Stone), weaving/clothes (Cloak) and... elder... when I saw elder, I thought “Jackpot!” (And JKR said in an interview once that the core of the Elder Wand is a Thestral tail hair, so the obvious choice was Berchthold's horse Sleipnir). Also all the other small things – Holle's blinding breath, reward and punishment, protection from fire, Berchthold as Death – it just fit. All
As the odd lady sped away, Seeker noticed a horse's tail sticking out from under her billowing  hem. Huh. Had she always had that?
Today, Draco was late for patching. It was mid-July and he had slept somewhat poorly due to the heat creeping into his bedroom. The gatehouse was not all that well isolated. He had therefore overslept and was now coming in to 'work' only in the late hours of midday.
“Everyone ready? Ember, why don't you ride with me today?” Wolfe tossed her hair back and mounted Binky. “You don't mind, do you, Seeker?”
It had been bad enough that Draco hadn't been able to suppress his traitorous thoughts of minor infatuation earlier, when he had been holding Potter's hand over the teacup. Like hell he would openly admit to having (shudder) very unimportant, super miniscule, really irrelevant feelings... for Potter. Absolutely not worth mentioning.
After carefully Apparating, he landed at Windsor Great Park, a public area also known as Windsor Forest and Great Park which was repeatedly mentioned as one of The Hunt's hunting grounds. Of course now, in summer, there would be nothing to find, but a first look wouldn't hurt.
As if Draco's little break had been an inspiration, the Weasel followed suit by flopping onto his back with a groan. “I don't think I ever want to read another word in my
They either carry them with them when they arrive or pick them up among the offerings from humans. Sometimes the moss folk provides stuff, such as food and drinks. All those things become part of The Hunt.
Up ahead Draco could now see weedy Theodore Nott and Daphne Greengrass, arms crossed over her chest. They both looked anxiously at the shut door of Gregory's room.
(It wasn't that Draco didn't know the ginger's name by now, mind you. He just thought it more fun to use nicknames for the redheaded bunch. A leftover from his former days.)
– now repeat that!” The group did. “And don't forget: The more crosses the longer your hideout is valid. Got it? Good, now show me your axes. Okay, but don't get any ideas, we don't want anyone hurt! ”
The offender laughed and buried his forehead in Draco's shoulder. If only that cheeky idiot weren't so adorable. “Oh, come on. Do you really think I'd take you seriously at this point? First you say I have no brain then you call me smart enough to see through your ruse. First you say you like me, then you say you don't. Then you tell me
Only Sundays were free of The Hunt, since Draco used those to be a Hogwarts-Patcher again. He hadn't forgotten about the duty he thought he had towards the school. Also (and he would
“Okay, okay. Gosh, you're such a spoilsport, Potter. Alright, the rumour goes like this: Normally, when a household's house-elf gets too old, they are beheaded–”
“And you never would have; only members of The Hunt are even aware. Thusly it will stay forever. My curse is for me alone to know as I have to bear it alone as well. But let's just say that those scorch marks on my boots are not by chance, if you get my drift. I can't really say any more, but both our,” he pointed at Holle and himself in turn, “'restrictions' were put upon us for... misdemeanour... towards the powers that be.”
do, though, is look up The Hunt itself. I know,” she held up her hand to stop Draco from indignantly interrupting her by pointing out that he had been saying that all along, “you said that before, but you missed the crucial point. You're concentrating on finding Piedro and tell us about him every five minutes. But that just triggers the memory erasure. So, what we, Ron and I, have got to do is focus on The Hunt and only that. We can recall things related to the phenomenon as long as it doesn't touch Patty. So, stop reminding us about him and we might actually figure this out. Because, while looking for The Hunt, we'll find out about the kidnapped people eventually, I'm sure,” she finished, looking at her audience expectantly.
Ever since one random day in April, he couldn't recall Potter's given name anymore. At first he hadn't even noticed, as seldom as Draco used it, but when it hit him, he had tried everything to get the name back, to no avail so far.
Lastly, as far as 'rituals' went, Draco had picked up one that he only practised when he was alone, because it would be too embarrassing otherwise: Since Draco nowadays spent hours upon hours of reading, cross-referencing, translating, writing, researching and such, he had found himself squinting more and more often until he had had to admit that he needed reading spectacles.
friends. Just not officially, or rather, not for the people who mattered. For their families they were... business colleagues at best. But what did Potter know.
“Oh, that's because – okay, let me start somewhere else: Some call moss folk Rilpen or Saligen, some nymphs and some even fae, believing they are fairies. But do you know what they
Granger looked breathtaking in her flowing dress and even Weasley had a grain of dashing that day, Draco had to admit. Probably the inner glow of people in love.
What was one supposed to answer when one's personal school bully was suddenly being sensible and said all the right things?
. When the doors opened at the ground floor, they revealed one handsomely clad Neville Longbottom in addition to a tall, thin lady with a disastrous hat. “Oh, hello, Malfoy. Merry Christmas!”
“Thank you, thank you, Draco, thank you! I can't thank you enough!” Anne's father blubbered and gripped Draco's arm tightly. “And thank you all for taking care of her! Oh my little girl, I didn't think I'd see the day...” the rest was unintelligible sobbing.
Ron hummed non-committally and Hermione let it slide. Really, she'd spent too many years with these two troublemakers.
“Oh, look! It's Sweden!” BraveHeart's passionate voice shook Harry from his daze, startling him awake.
Good memories indeed. In the scrapbook was a sunlit shot of the three of them. Right next to birthday celebration pictures of both Harry's birthday parties.
Really, though, why should he? Draco frowned. It wasn't as if he would particularly miss Potter's annoying presence. Neither would anyone else, now that they didn't remember him anymore. Therefore, no one could blame Draco for not having done anything about it. Seriously, why bother? Let Potter sort this one out himself.
If it had been any other person, he would have thought she was having him on. Draco Malfoy scared for Harry Potter. Ha ha, what a joke, let's pull his leg and play dumb, ha ha. It was stern, no-nonsense McGonagall though. Who was regularly sharing biscuits and stories with Potter during breaks, who had no sense of humour Draco knew of, who had been Potter's Head of House for six years, who was... currently looking at him like she had absolutely no idea who Draco was talking about.
Once in research-mode, Draco was usually relentless. Good thing Kreacher had interpreted Draco's order (to go to Hogwarts to help with the repairs) loosely and popped in from the castle every now and then to make some food, do the dishes, the laundry and cleaning.
They were rolling on the forest ground, ringing with each other, faces anger-red and clothes tousled.
Pansy, Cassius and Granger quickly wrapped up their impromptu game of tic-tac-toe. End score: Pansy 5 wins, Cassius 2, Granger 7.
“Anyway, how is your search for, er, Paean going?” Stuck-up asked, awkwardly trying to make conversation.
A cheeky hand landed on Draco's stomach. He quickly shoved it away, albeit with silent regret. “May I remind you, that earlier
The counterfeit grinned. “Oh yes, I definitely am.” He blew Malfoy a kiss. “After all, I was made for you.”
Harry's gaze glued to a singular larger than life-sized wooden statue of a young woman on the far side of the pond.
And while he didn't care for the noise, the storm, the flurry or the horde riding ahead over the barn, somewhere deep down, a part of him registered that he was still here, not taken. Subconsciously, Draco had used his research knowledge and had kept standing still in the middle of the old road, where people were said to be safe from The Hunt.
Glowing just like – he turned to face Snowdrop on his shoulder (while putting out his hand so that Lightning couldn't steal more plants) and certainly, the owl was also illuminated by this strange shine. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he realised that he had noticed it before, he had just been too preoccupied with other things. He looked at Lightning, yet, despite his luminous name, the horse was simply a horse trying to eat Harry's present.
“Right then, let's get this started. Pig!” Weasley called and Pansy wondered briefly if she was supposed to hex him for the insult.
“You know what really annoys me?” Potter purposefully stepped in the path of Draco hovering a little tree. “The fact that you always rectify your behaviour, always try to explain it all away:
Potter cleared his throat. “And it's still a bit awkward between Ginny and me. You know. After the breakup. Even though it was amiable and all.”
Skilfully wrapped around Snowdrop's ankle was something that seemed to be a rolled-up leaf. Seeker carefully extracted it and unfurled the green sheet.
“What my duck meant to say was that sometimes during non-wintery seasons when Berchthold is out alone on his solitary ride, he picks up lost souls on the way and brings them to The Hunt; which is what happened to us,” Half offered, hairpins between his lips.
, Mr. Changeling,” Wolfe huffed and Half threw her puckered air kisses. She rolled her eyes and turned to Seeker who looked sceptical. “It's really just a story parents thought of to explain puberty, I guess.” She shrugged.
know then? Also: visions?” He nearly jumped when something cool pressed to his ear: “He sees the future,” Draco whispered almost inaudibly.
Pushing himself off the floor, Seeker groaned in pain. Not only had sleeping uncomfortably done things to his back but also were the few places Half's punches had hit Seeker giving off dull aches.
“Absolutely,” Ronald agreed, trying (and failing) for a sober face as he sat up straight. The other men giggled.
Headmistress McGonagall, looking solemn and a bit regal, stepped in front of the portal and addressed the crowd: “It is with great appreciation and great sadness that we remember our dead today. Those brave hearts that defended Hogwarts and our freedom, to preserve it for us and future generations.” She waved her wand and the fabric disappeared, revealing two shiny copper plaques with names: Hogwarts' Fallen Fifty. “Sons and daughters of Hogwarts. You will never be forgotten.”
Of the gang, Seeker and Wolfe had stayed back with half of the team as protectors, while Half and BraveHeart went forward with the other half as captors.
The other boy stared at him vacantly. “What'sit matter? Vince' dead, too.” His voice grew louder. “And you, you're never here. What'sit matter to you, Blood Traitor?”
“Don't people here know how to answer questions in a non-confusing way?” Harry had grappled himself mostly free from the other's tight grip and bobbed alongside him, still holding Lightning's reins.
He swallowed, pushing away the uprising memories of the cemetery. He couldn’t afford to drown here. There was something that needed clarifying though.  “Still,” the quiet word hung between them as if he had shouted it, “I'll always rather have you alive and annoying.”
To studious Mirela_Lupoaica, who felt inspired to be inspiring and did her own research about Holle (and also arranged for me to receive a fanletter! Hi, A.!). She gave me valuable information that I could use in this chaper.
On Harry's other side, Wolfe was already on Binky's back, while Ember helped BraveHeart onto Grapes and then turned towards Harry.
Harry chuckled at the unexpected compliment. “Thanks, but that wasn't me. People tend to think I get impossible things done but the truth is, I always have help and in this case a very smart man,” Harry was so immensely proud of Draco, “gathered all the information for me. All
“Thank you, Headmaster, for those kind words of welcome,” She simpered.  “Well, it is lovely to be back at Hogwarts, I must say!  And to see such happy little faces looking back at me!”  I glanced around.  No one looked happy; rather, everyone held a face between anger, amusement and confusion.  I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all, and I’m sure we’ll be very good friends!”  She cleared her throat again and I felt a deep seed of discontent settle in my stomach.
“Are you guys meeting soon?  The Leaving Feast is tomorrow,” She finally asked.  I sat up and shrugged.
"Morning,"  Harry mumbled with his gravelly morning voice.  Draco shoved the mug into his hands and turned around to hide his flushing face.
Not that they never cried to each other. Tears made guest appearances often enough. But it never went
“We travelled a long time. We were nowhere welcome. Not on land, whether with magic doers nor with Muggles, and not in the sea either. We'd almost given up when we came out of these woods,” she pointed vaguely upwards, towards the Forbidden Forest, “and found understanding people here.”
“It's because of the connection,” champed Granger, “the most powerful connection.” She shook her head at the forlorn gazes directed at her. “Oh come on, it's so easy. Malfoy, you said it yourself: Parsley had your wand. You both shared a wand, in a manner of speaking. Wand magic connecting you both is the most powerful connection.”
It was pointless to wonder about his deceased friends. The Hunt had moved on and they had gone with it to who-knew-where. They would not meet again. As it should be. The living and the dead were of separate worlds.
Then of course all that Potter-business had happened and Draco had been too occupied to reach out. Yes, he'd felt bad about it, and yes, he'd missed his sassy friends, but he had also realised that, if he wanted to be free from bias,
He fumbled for a moment for his wand and then pointed it awkwardly at the cup with his left hand (not his wand arm, mind you).
Thursdays he would look into missing persons (somehow word had spread that he was good at finding people and so, new letters came in every other week).
... and at the fact that Harry himself had taken so long to understand that he liked this softness – along with the sharpness.
Not that there was a lack of Potter-related things in Draco's life. The Golden Couple sure was a reminder as loud as they came, especially the Weasel.
He fed his eagle owl, cooing to him, a few Owl Treats. Eagle (creative, right?) had always been a loyal companion for Draco. His company was soothing.
Draco took Harry's hand. They looked at each other. Harry leant in and kissed Draco one last time in this life. Then they stepped into Holle's Pond in unison. On to a new adventure, together.
With the horses in the background, Half and Wolfe, arm in arm, and BraveHeart jumping up and down, and Ember with a solemn expression – they all echoed the send-off words and waved back.
“Yes, you brat,” snarled Life and crossed her thin arms in front of her chest. “Quite right. Your other half is gleefully safe while mine is condemned for all eternity.”
“And this is how this lake was made and we named it Great Black Lake, after the great black holes in our souls. This is how our new, mixed tribe came to be here.” She nodded solemnly. “We are better now, almost whole again, but we will never forget those who were taken from us by the blindness of hate and misunderstanding.”
He closed his eyes and put his forehead against the cold glass, suddenly very tired. Ever since receiving word from Sir Nicholas about a week ago, Draco had been wired. Too fidgety to sleep for long, too nervous to do something useful. He had been waiting, waiting, waiting and now that the wait was over, the restless energy driving him so far, had left him.
“Sorry, he's an ass on his best days,” Potter offered and Draco felt offended, yet at the same time too intimidated to say anything. “But can I ask you something? What do they teach in your school?”
Harry shuffled his feet, not meeting Draco's eyes. “Love me? I mean, sure, you sort of have to say it back for it not to be awkward and yeah, there's the whole bit with the most powerful connection, but then again I thought that, you know, you probably weren't ready to hear it, even though I know how I feel, for months now, but I wasn't going to put it on you, truly and–” Harry knew that he babbled, he just didn't know how to stop.
“I think that's a splendid idea, Granger. Go on ahead to Hogwarts,” Draco said loudly, “and take Kreacher with you. He will go and help with patching up the castle until further notice.”
“Down here!” Weasley shouted, jumping up so energetically that his chair fell backwards. “In the kitchen!”
Apparently the Weasel, as he turned redder than his hair. He was saved from answering however when Granger picked up a piece of note paper and started pushing little numbered buttons on the foh-n.
Potter's expression softened and Draco wanted nothing more than to run away. He would have, had his legs not decided to turn into jelly. This was embarrassing beyond compare.
“Good evening,” said a soft voice drifting towards Draco out of the darkness. He nearly had a heart attack.
Thinking about it, Seeker wasn't all that surprised that Berchthold could also shapeshift and that his animal form was a stag. Figured really, since he usually sported antlers and all.
Draco heard the bathroom door shut. If he knew Harry at all, that would take a while. After The Hunt, taking
“Not likely. Whatever weirdness had our magic not working properly inside that room doesn't seem to affect my spell out here. I sealed the door from the outside.” Draco shuddered involuntarily, the darkness pressing in on them. Also, he was wet. Ugh.
But the ever-rising cacophony of sounds made his words almost inaudible even to himself. “DON'T LOOK!”
shouted Draco. The spell was muffled by the Bubble-Head Charm which gave Draco the peculiar appearance of wearing an upside-down goldfish bowl on his head. It worked though and the metal door to the secret underground room snapped shut, locking with a loud click, right in the face of Queen Harry.
They rushed above the algae forests and mud deserts, their shadow on the ground looking like a hovering angel.
mortal danger, unexpected romance, betrayal, confession(s), an escape, fun and games, an arrogant side character, lore, love, heartbreak -  and fairies (of sorts)!
Held up by his hand, in the flickering light of the castle torches the unfurled scroll showed... not much: Approximately the size of a book page, the middle of the parchment was empty and only in the four corners of the paper were little sketches – a Hippogriff, a Sphinx, some weird flower and a flaming heart.
Thoughtfully Harry reattached the piece of cloth onto his wrist. He had gotten used to it and it felt strange to be without
After an unsteady start on the broom, Draco was back in his element again, even with only one hand on the handle while the other cast spells. He wondered why he'd ever considered giving up on flying.
They had reached the pitch and Potter started rummaging in the school supplies broom shack. Bending down he made for a pretty picture.
She looked forlorn. “But you always just tolerated me, isn't that right? When you asked me to the Yule Ball back in fourth year, I was over the moon. From then on you let me get close, let me touch you and I figured
“The humans burnt down Yonder Hill and hunted us on land. You must know,” the old merwoman looked at Draco and Potter, “we merpeople can walk on solid ground, if we have a good reason to.”
“I just know.” With that Ember turned away, the man-turned-dog at his heels, leaving Harry unsure about what to do next.
Seeker had had time to think on his way back here and he was still angry, but ready to face the truth. They deserved a chance to explain themselves and Seeker just needed to know.
“Malfoy, Malfoy! Man, are you okay?” Kneeling down on either side of Draco were Granger and Weasley, the latter gently but urgently shaking his shoulder.
“Erm, I just wanted to give you back your wand?” Up close, Potter looked taken aback and flustered, weakly offering Draco the wand he now recognised as his own. “But, apology accepted. I guess.”
“Okay, what exactly is happening now?” Seeker asked, blinking through the twilight cast by  last bits of campfire embers.
The merwoman took the Heal-All Oyster from Draco and cracked it open, using only her hands. Just how strong were those creatures? She offered a piece of the flesh to Draco and when he refused, gave it instead to Potter.
“The tree,” Harry wheezed, eyes shut against the anguish. He dug his fingernails into Malfoy's hand. “There's a curtain covering the trunk. There must be metal behind it. Try it!”
Draco turned back to hovering a tree sapling into one of the two dozen cavities he had excavated earlier.
All four doubled over in laughter and Harry felt the anxiety of being in this unknown situation partially falling off of him. He started to like those crazies. Wolfe seemed a bit silly, BraveHeart was way too easily excited and Half had a bit of a domineering personality, but they were already making him feel safe and that really counted for something now, didn't it?
of all places, but now Seeker needed him to get real. How could one have a whole conversation about somebody without saying their name?
“I wasn't!” Harry yelped immediately, yet he wondered just how true or false this assessment really was. Maybe he would never know for sure. The only thing he
Berchthold slowly tilted his antlers and the grieving man's head began to swell rapidly. He made a surprised noise, causing the voice from inside to fearfully quarry: “What's happening?”
As his group members discussed last bits of strategy, his mind went back to the day The Hunt had come to this area. He remembered feeling groggy from drinking too much the night before and he had been very grateful to simply lay down and rest while the others had taken care of finding a nice camping place in the middle of an open forest on a wide clearing near Holle's Pond (which had once again travelled on ahead of The Hunt).
In the sudden silence that followed, Draco could hear harsh, female sobs. It seemed like Potter had been right with his assessment of the household's emotional state: Everyone tried their best to keep it in and just be happy during the holidays. Draco's unforeseen arrival had tipped the scales though and now he was on the receiving end of outpouring feelings that weren't completely directed at him.
Being unable to enter the Manor had come gradually. It had been uncomfortable to go back there after the trial but the haunting feeling of bone-crushing guilt had only crept in piece by piece, day by day. Until in the end, Draco couldn't even look at his childhood home anymore without having to breathe heavily. He had thought he was handling it though, slowly but surely.
Living on his own these last one and a half years had taught Draco to see things in a different light and now that he'd found how much he'd changed he wasn't all that sad anymore to leave earlier than he had originally planned.
“Hey, don't you think that parchment looks kind of real?” Ron had appeared at her shoulder and gave her a turn. He pointed at where a small golden trumpet and a scroll were crossed over, right below the rabbit statue. “Let's have a look.” He reached for it and carefully tugged the paper free.
The week after the disastrous encounter with Potter and The Hunt, after Granger had kicked Draco out of his self-pity, he had gone back to Hogwarts for the first time since Potter's abduction. Draco had worked on patches all day and finally had made a last detour to visit the memorial site before going home.
The ingredients were only mildly interesting (tea leaves and then some), but the background information was a jackpot. Draco's eyes bulged.
“That's why we call him BraveHeart,” informed the redhead, nodding at BraveHeart's chest and plopping down next to Harry. “I'm Half, by the way.”
For the third time that evening, Hermione's forehead collided with another human being and she stumbled backwards, only held upright by Ron's steadying hand. Unfortunately though, in the progress, the Invisibility Cloak slid half-way off them both and exposed them to:
Harry's gaze flickered back. He reached out and tenderly brushed a stray strand of blond hair off the other boy's forehead, marvelling for the umpteenth time that night at just how
She looked up, surprised, as if she hadn't been aware she had company – which was quite a feat considering that The Hunt brawled all around them. “Ah, oh, thank you, Seeker. I invented it.” Her gaze turned thoughtful. “I always sing it when we cross big waters.”
“Cool, yeah, so, she said you were pretty good at, er, research and finding stuff and well, the thing is,” Thomas rubbed his neck, uncertain, “I'm looking for someone.” He produced a small paper covered in notes. “We were caught together by a gang of Snatchers. They took her somewhere else later. I don't know her name, but she was middle-aged, Muggle-born, brunette, average build. She said she had two kids at home. It's all on here.” He held the paper out to Draco. “She was nice to me and I never knew what became of her, if she's even still alive. Can you look for her?”
Everyone's eyes turned awaitingly to Half who sighed deeply and then started unravelling the surrounding mysteries: “Alright, so, we all are part of The Wild Hunt.” He made a big arm gesture, encircling the loud people and animals around them. “Short version: The Hunt is a cortège mostly consisting of ghosts of those who have died a cruel death or at too young an age,” he pointed at Wolfe, BraveHeart, himself and Ember in turn, “and dead or abandoned animals.” He tickled Snowdrop's head. “But sometimes, very rarely really, there are also those we call 'witnesses'. People like you who saw The Hunt and for one reason or other were taken with us. I don't strictly know why or how they pick such people. You'll have to ask Perchta – Holle – the next time you see her. She is one of the two leaders of The Hunt and a mighty supernatural being. You should always be respectful towards her. Her and Berchthold, the other leader, or rather
Ember was in the middle of putting reins on BraveHeart's horse Grapes. He turned around. “You want me to ride with you again?”
Draco felt a bit panicky. This would hurt. He squeezed his eyes shut, clutching the device tightly. Anything for Potter.
She was quick and within seconds several meters ahead of them. Looking back over her shoulder, she furrowed her brows. “Can't you swim a bit faster?”
“That's ridiculous,” grumbled Harry, but let himself be led away, “you're having secrets with me about me.”
indeed had it. Yet the quiet voice was drowned out by the atmosphere of the celebrations which lasted well into the early hours of the next day.
“Hello, Handsome.” Ginny kissed him on the cheek. Her floor-length burgundy satin dress caressed her curves in all the right places.
Perchta! So, it really is her crown! Unbelievable. You are so lucky!” BraveHeart's eyes had become round like the moon and he gawked so unabashedly that Harry felt a blush creeping up his neck. Especially since the others joined in on the rapt ogling. Like he was some sort of carnival attraction; when they themselves were the weirder people here.
“Speaking of remembering:,” Draco cut in, cheeks flushed, hands still tightly fisting Harry's jumper, “What if I hadn't remembered about him?”
“It was nothing,” Draco said out loud and he flinched at his own words, spoken with a raspy voice. “I merely entertained the thought of what-if. What if you had been smart about choosing your friends back in first year and had taken my invitation to become a Slytherin. Although, in retrospect, you would have made a terrible Slytherin, as uncouth as you are.”
Mabel swam backstroke and grinned at them. “That's the reason they're called lessons, because they lessen from day to day.”
Nonetheless, it was under his gentle tutelage that his mother had quietly picked up where she had left off with her sister all those years ago and by now, the two of them were tentatively exchanging letters which seemed to bring both of them joy, as far as Draco could conclude.
Huh. The narrative held some similarities to the Hunt lore. A mysterious, powerful old woman named Holle who could make it snow. Also, reward and punishment. Draco made a mental note to look further into this particular story but also other Muggle fairy tales.
,” here he pinned Draco down with his slanting eyes, “can't be arsed to care. Now, get the fuck in there and make him sign the self-referral form or I swear to God I'll hex you into next week.” With that he thrust a stained and crinkled paper at Draco that was headed
Frustrated, Pansy shut her volume with a snap. “Great, really great! You act so all-knowing but you can't figure out shit. What happened to Draco? He might be in danger!”
“Not too late to go back to bed, Potter. You need the beauty sleep.” Malfoy grinned the tiniest grin.
Pressing a hand onto his hurting side, Harry flung open a small portal, half-hidden behind a Gobelin with sleeping bunnies on it. Maybe Malfoy would not see him disappear in here.
Ron thrust the map at her and pointed at two quickly moving little dots, apparently sprinting down the third floor Charms corridor. “Code Ferret!”
Returning to the task at hand, he had to look through various cupboards before he found the mug he'd been searching for, as all the interior of the cabinets had seemingly doubled. Probably a side effect of all of Harry's things disappearing and then reappearing; after all, Draco had also filled the place, to make it his own.
Hermione sighed heavily and flipped the page of her Arithmancy book with a bit more force than strictly necessary. Next to her, Ron had been fidgeting for a while now and it was driving her spare.
“Doesn't sound so bad, does it?” Cassius cocked his head. “If they're having a cuppa and that's all then they should be out soon, no?”
It was only because of Greg's high intoxication that the curse missed Draco. By millimetres. What the hell!
, for a long time now. I thought we were getting friendly while Ron and I lived here? Is it, were you lonely? Are you mad we didn't come visit. I'm sorry, Kreacher, we were busy.”
“Er...” The Weasel looked helplessly between a fuming Hermione and a dumbfounded Draco. “I thought I did?”
“No, I'm good. I...” already have someone? But he didn't say that out loud. He wasn't sure himself where that thought had come from.
“You can see me,” Seeker whispered breathlessly. It was impossible. The one person he had wished to meet most in the world had suddenly appeared before his very eyes.
“Seems like they opened the dance floor. I'll see if Angelina wants to boogie!” George was quickly retreating towards the crowd. Over his shoulder he shouted back to them: “Are you coming?”
“My name...” Seeker whispered, furious tears of disappointment running down his cheeks. “You can't leave me here...”
“I wonder what they dished up for us this time.” Wolfe smoothed down her dress, the light fabric blowing in the breeze. Harry would never understand how the girl wasn't an icicle yet. If he had to guess the reason: Hunt magic.
“Uh-huh,” hummed Potter, rolled his eyes and disappeared back onto Draco's head. It oddly felt as if Potter was petting Draco's scalp. “Since we are at spilling your secrets:” Draco sputtered and tilted to the right, “What was that? I mean seriously, I mean seriously, was he...” Potter swallowed, “flirting?”
The huge brown eyes of the addressee went even wider and for some weird reason her gaze flickered to Draco. “I is given a present, miss,” she hid her tomato-sized nose behind her hands, “from Kreacher. And I is having to work!” She scooted off.
“Not at all!” The elf shook his head so hard his ears flapped. “It is too dangerous! It is in the Underworld.”
Anyway, if anyone needed proof that Harry's feelings for Draco were real then Harry could tell them this: That, even with Fred, who shared such a likeness with his sister, right there in The Hunt, Harry had never thought about Ginny. But seeing Draco on the cliffs, at that point a virtual stranger, Harry had
“How about,” drawled a paper-thin voice from behind, making them both jump, “you tell me what the Mudblood and young Master Malfoy are doing here in my Mistress' house.”
Potter with his green eyes, stupid glasses, black bird's nest, fondness of treacle tart, bravery, heroics....
“I'm sure. I like my own wand better.” Potter pulled a second wand from his pocket. This time Draco remained calm. “Besides, I'm positive, your wand will always remember me.”
It was as if a breeze of silence hit the loud Hunt and even the ignoramuses sensed that something was going on.
Harry looked back at the school, its silhouette glittering on the lake's surface. The lights from the high windows danced on the water like specks of gold.
This man here must have been fighting a battle of his own, so Draco would have to be extra polite: “Hej, jag heter Draco Malfoy. Ah, talar du engelska?”
“Well, well, well,” sneered Pansy Parkinson, “if that aren't the know-it-all and her little Weasely-Poo. And look!” She glanced exaggeratedly at her wristwatch. “It's already after curfew. Twenty points from Gryffindor – for each.” Grinning smugly, she added: “Care to explain what you're doing here after hours?”
Draco's drawn-up shoulders dropped in relief. He turned around, mischief glinting in his eyes. “Sure, how else would you find the way? You couldn't possibly master such a difficult task alone.”
When Draco turned away to leave The Burrow he felt the first hot drops spilling down his cheeks while Mother Weasley started to put servings of pudding onto various plates, humming
Lucius stiffened, but quickly regained his composure (a feat, considering his prisoner's clothes), bobbing his head once in agreement.
Wild Hunt what? Go where? Rubbing sleep out of his eyes, Draco fuzzily realised that a redheaded someone was rummaging through his clothes.
Then there had been the incident when Half had abruptly started screaming at Seeker not to move since there was a HUGE spider on his head (obviously not, but it still had had Seeker's heart rate going up like crazy).
He would miss all of them – Dreamer and Scoffer and Lightning and everyone. Harry closed his eyes. He had had no chance to say goodbye.
“It means,” said Half who seemed to have come to terms with whatever had caused his earlier mood-swing, “that we have met before
“Exactly!” snapped Draco heatedly. “If you know where The Hunt is, let's send the Aurors to get the baby back. It's their job. Why do
Draco gaped at Longbottom. Wow, that had come unexpected. Something warm and euphoric made its presence known in Draco's stomach. It had been undeserved, but he was grateful nevertheless.
“And what's that now?” Harry frowned, pointing at the object next to the sleeper: a big, bulky grey mass with seven dancing lights floating above it.
And there was something else: Curiosity nibbled at him. Where were they going? What was the purpose of The Hunt? Why him? He might never find out if he left now.
Draco swallowed. “That's a nice story, Potter.” Harry gave him a stern look. “But maybe you've forgotten I have a 'scar', too?” Draco willed himself to twist their arms around so that his Dark Mark was facing the other boy. “What do you make of this one, I wonder?”
“You speak Swedish?” Weasley seemed reluctantly impressed which brought Draco unexpected glee. He still felt a bit jittery from the foh-n-experience.
“Is that a Muggle thing?” asked Draco, weirdly fascinated by the thought of a house exclusively built for books.
“Er, right, again I'm really sorry. Of course you are correct to reject me. I'll be taking my leave then.” He made a vague turn towards the door, only to be yanked back.
It was not until the steadily beating drums, that had sounded all the while, became a cacophony that people stopped dancing.
Since The Hunt would, in all probability, only appear again in December, Granger and Weasley had jumped off the daily-research-train. Instead the three of them had agreed on a weekly meeting on Wednesdays.
Hermione was sitting cross-legged on the carpet in front of the couch, rattling off all the people whose presents still needed packaging. Meanwhile Harry and his Weasel had a pretend sword fight with two rolls of wrapping paper, which had them dancing back and forth in the living room. An excited Pig circled the opponents with loud screeching. Draco meanwhile was busy playing with Crookshanks (who was lying in his lap), teasing the cat with a gift ribbon.
Back then, after weeks in holding (not in Azkaban, but in some quickly reinforced interrogation room turned make-shift cell in the Ministry's dungeons), their lawyer had visited Draco unannounced.
“All set.” The folder snapped shut. “Now: Have a good life.” With that, their lawyer left them, quite unceremoniously.
An icy breeze rattling the leafless branches was the first sign that it had worked, followed by low rolling thunder in the distance.
“Let you out, did they?” Malfoy laughed and Harry, though initially annoyed, joined in momentarily. With that phrasing, he'd had that coming, truly. “But yeah, could be,” Malfoy continued. “How about you just ask Dobby once we're back on the surface.”
The image of a softly glowing stag materialised before Harry's inner eye. Berchthold sure had looked majestic in his shape-shifted form, walking through the woods. Bizarre to read about this enchanting moment so dryly in written words, but Draco had done a superb job in collecting all this information.
“Ah, yes, hi again. I had another... accident. Anyway, er, could you peerhaps show us the way back into the castle?”
While Harry frowned and started to object, Death beamed: “Yes and such a bright one, picking that up right away. You really have a smart head on your shoulders.”
She turned while continuing to scurry away, now walking backwards. “Of course we're going with him, right, Seeker?” She didn't wait for a reply. “And in case you were wondering, yes,
From then on things regressed rapidly, both boys punching, kicking, yelling, scratching and pulling hair like furies.
Wolfe cooed delighted. “What a beauty she is.” Snowdrop seemed to agree with this assessment as she gracefully landed on the girl's shoulder and accepted an un-barbecued piece of marshmallow from her.
Harry snorted and then started cackling, doubling over, which earned him another stern hoot from the owl. This was hilarious! So Draco!
Harry laughed quietly, his low rumbles rippling through Draco's body. “Ah,welllll,” his fingers danced playfully on Draco's ticklish side, “that doesn't apply to
“What? A bit busy here, Potter.” Malfoy ducked and Queen Harry's magic pulled so fiercely at Harry that he felt like his intestines were being ripped out.
Draco stormed through the deserted halls of Hogwarts. He was fuming and also deeply shaken. The old nursery rhyme about The Wild Hunt, that his mother used to sooth him with when he was frightened by thunder as a child, was playing on repeat in his head. Sure, one said that there was a grain of truth in every myth, but this? If he hadn't been there himself, he wouldn't have believed it either that they could just vanish a person's entire existence.
“Alright then. The thing is... Dobby, we seem to have lost Harry and,” Granger hesitated and glanced at the Slytherins, “another student. We can't find them in the castle. Could you maybe go and, erm, fetch them for us? Or at least find out their location, please?”
Wolfe calmed down, the conversation drifted to different topics and Seeker's mind wandered. Without his warm outer-layer, he felt a bit chilly and rubbed his arms. The movement made him realise that the dress shirt he'd been wearing underneath his jumper had a breast pocket.
“Do you even know how to play chess?” Malfoy ignored the made-up Harry in order to lean forward on the table, scrutinising the board.
“Course she was.” Harry gulped. Hedwig. She hadn't died in The Battle of Hogwarts. She hadn't died anywhere near The Hunt and yet, she was here. Death and Life must've done something about that, because they knew how much Harry would appreciate this gesture, to see his old friend again.
Malfoy swallowed audibly. “That's... unique.” His eyes snapped to Harry. “May I have Potter back now?”
By the first light of morning, Harry was still furious. They'd been riding all through the night and now, at the break of dawn, he continued to give those so-called friends of his the silent treatment. How could they?! They would have just left the helpless baby to fend for itself!
“Nuh-uh, if I do all your homework, how will you learn?” Harry wiggled his index finger and then paused, puzzled. Somehow this didn't sound like him all that much, rather as if he had borrowed someone else's words.
“Draco Malfoy. Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy.” Draco could see himself reflected in the wandmaker's misty eyes. “I didn't expect to encounter you again, after our last meeting.”
Many of Harry's former classmates, friends and comrades-in-arms – coming in pairs or groups, with their families or alone – popped up to greet them.
Draco nervously smoothed down his coat. No matter how many times he wore the Muggle clothes Granger had picked out for him for his research outings, he felt colossally underdressed and uncomfortable. Especially those G'n'S that were so tight against his legs; he felt as though he were going naked with the way they snugly sat on his hips. Draco would have almost been tempted to believe these pants were Granger's misguided way of flirting (perish the thought!), had he not seen Weasley wearing a matching pair. They must have been on sale.
Draco carefully put the care packet on his desk before collapsing into a chair and slamming his arms onto the tabletop. He buried his face in the crooks, exhaustion washing over him.
“Evening.” Harry grinned as Malfoy flinched and spun around. “Nice password they have this week. Got good taste, this year's Slytherins.”
Tentatively, the headmistress took the book and, after a silent moment of mutual staring, she opened it and skimmed the index for the right part.
He had also found a dusty remembrance between the pages of an old school book Weasley had brought from the Manor's library. It was the joke badge from back in fourth year. However, where it once had said
Earlier, a nightmare had woken him up and after consulting the Marauder's Map (and finding what he'd been looking for), Harry had decided that a bit of patching would do him good.
Malfoy huffed. “Spoken like a true hero. You would even help your enemies out of the...” Malfoy’s voice trailed off. He coughed slightly and tensed. The unusual wording caught Harry’s attention and he furrowed his brows. Maybe Malfoy’d thought along the same lines as Harry: about the ever-present sword of Damocles that was Voldemort’s return and also the current toad regime.
Nott cleared his throat. “I tried to make him stop drinking, but he won't listen to me. Please, he... the Goyles took me in after my father went to prison.” Draco flinched. Of course he had known of widower Mr. Nott's incarceration, but Draco had assumed his classmate would simply live alone like Draco afterwards. Now he felt guilty for not checking in on the other boy. Draco had not been a great friend lately. “I just couldn't be on my own and he felt so lonely... after Crabbe. Anyway, we're tight now, okay? You need to fix this.”
It was like a silent agreement between them. While working together they would say whatever they couldn't say to others. Drop all pretence and be miserable, without being scrutinised or criticised or babied or pitied. Just letting it all out. Like talking into a void.
“Makes sense,” Draco's answer sounded strained. “But if that part is true does that mean the rest is, too? If the stone, the cloak and the wand are real and you had them all then does that mean...?”
That, and the monotonous up-and-down of Malfoy's strides lulled Harry into the sort of cosiness you would normally achieve sitting in front of an open fireplace.
“Nothing.” Malfoy's glance flickered up to the hole in the ceiling. He ran a hand through his hair, looking distressed. Messed up like that, it deprived him of his sharp angles and Harry found, startlingly, that the softer look worked for Malfoy, like
“Great,” said Malfoy and it was clear to everyone that he meant 'shit'. “How long is this going to last?”
He passed the newly furnished private library in the next room which Hermione had insisted he needed. He missed her terribly, her and Ron. But they deserved the Australia round-trip Hermione's parents had invited them on after they had got back their real memories. Harry was happy for them.
“Okay that makes sense.” The witch nodded, taking the book from Draco. “Then the only thing left to do is to find Poppy."
Draco had realised the first time he'd seen that creature back at Hagrid's hut in sixth year that this was most certainly the very same animal that had attacked Draco in third year. Hagrid could call that beast any number of code names but it was still the hippogriff that should have been executed a long time ago.
Weasley's face scrunched up in mock-pain. “Do we have to? It's Boxing Day, Malfoy! We have family plans!” Big blue puppy eyes looked at him, fluttering their lashes. Bleh, Draco felt sick. “Don't you?”
? Surely not. But Potter stared at him so intensely that Draco could do nothing but stare back. Oh Merlin.
“The soul...” Draco shifted uneasy. “Aren't you putting your head above the parapet a bit with this one? I mean, do you even know if there is something like a soul?”
Then Harry's face lit up in the way sunlight hits white flower petals – ineffably beautiful, almost too bright to look at.
Seeker tilted his head. Aha. Yeah, that actually made sense. After all, there were some indecently underdressed riders that couldn't possibly have been picked up during winter time. Okay, one mystery solved.
How many times was that now? Five? Ten? But he had to be patient and repeat the purpose of their meeting every now and then or else the other two would slowly forget.
“These are the three Deathly Hallows: the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility and the Elder Wand. Holle is guardian of the treasures of the interior of the earth – that's why there's a
At the time, fetching the book had seemed to be a good excuse to escape Hermione's iron-first rule of recapping for a few moments.
Specks of March sun sprinkled the forest floor and revealed the first spring flowers between the tree trunks.
Surprised cries followed this revelation and the whole group crowded around them to look at the thin piece of knotted yarn wrapped around Harry's wrist, something he hadn't noticed before and was now eyeing with the same curiosity as the others.
