Harry sags in relief and lets Hermione lead him into Draco's room. Draco is lying quietly propped up against several pillows. He looks pale and drawn, but he’s definitely breathing. Harry fights the urge to run to him — forces himself to walk over slowly, to take Draco's hand gently.
Draco stilled, tilted his head at Harry, and scratched the top of the platypus’ head gently. He considered the offer for a moment, before smiling in an almost predatory manner. Harry gulped.
Florian vanished behind the counter for a moment, reappearing with a chocolate dipped waffle cone. He topped the cone with two rather large scoops of ice cream, a marbled brilliant purple and rich gold, it was studded with chocolate chunks, and Penny snuffled towards it as Florian handed it to Harry.
He squeezes Harry’s hand, and lets him step into the floo. Harry spends the rest of the night considering what Draco might be saying without words.
Harry simply rolled his eyes, and waved his hand a second time. The grey jeans he’d mentioned earlier, as well as one of Draco’s favorite black turtlenecks made their way out of the closet, followed by a bulky green and grey colorblocked hoodie that was technically Harry’s, and Draco’s dark leather chelsea boots.
“My brother and Hermione said you have something you want to tell me.” She says, her smile spreading.
. He looked around at the piles of clothing on his bed, desk and floor, wondering how it was that he could own so many shirts, and none of them could be acceptable for this date.
Draco holds Harry through funeral after funeral that summer. He keeps Harry upright through speeches, memorials, and ministry events. In return, Harry props him up through interviews and
They flew even higher, and Draco gasped as the shoreline of a very familiar island started to come into view. The crescent moon shape of Nantucket appeared out of the darkness, lit by the lighthouses at each of its points, the moon, and the millions of stars.
and cursing himself, Merlin, and Morgana that he’d let the time get so far away from him. Harry was supposed to arrive in less than ten minutes and Draco was still standing around in his pants.
“Only that the staring has a bit of a different motivation.” She wriggles her eyebrows for emphasis.
“So do you. Worse, even.” Draco replies, slowly working his fingers into Harry's hair, stroking one of his temples.
There's grief in the day, but joy as well. The great hall is full of people. Houses mix, students, and professors, and members of the Order of the Phoenix talk to one another in the easy way only joint survivors of horrible trauma can. The Weasley twins have a pile of first and second years surrounding them, enchanted by experimental fireworks from The Wheezes. One of them, fuck him if he knows which, is covered in glitter, and it rubs off on Draco when he’s yanked in for a roughshod hug.
Draco closed his eyes and pressed closer to Harry as they lifted over the skyline, swooping between skyscrapers and office buildings, the lights flashing by painting the inside of his eyelids a warm red. He breathed in the fresh air mingled with the scent of Harry, the wind rushing through his hair, tickling the back of his neck.
The platypus climbed onto his back, settling in and curling up like a cat. Harry froze where he was, staring down at Draco.
Harry does consider bolting then. But he’s got no clue where he is in Portugal, and his return portkey doesn’t leave for another few hours, and even that would only buy him until Sunday, where Ginny would no doubt corner him and potentially make him admit it in front of Fred and George.
Draco glared at him again, but sunk back down until he was resting fully on top of Harry again. Harry looked once more to the platypus, which seemed much the same, if a little closer than it had been previously. Harry chalked it up to the bed shifting as Draco moved around.
They are possibly both drunker than they realize. It’s easier this way. Easier for Harry to ignore the tightening of his chest when Draco eyes another bloke across the bar, easier to ignore how no one catches his eye like the blond next to him does. He wonders if it’s easier for Draco to be around him when they’re drunk too.
“If I call you Harry, will you call me Draco?” Draco says softly, like he’s afraid the answer will be no.
Harry nodded and grinned over his shoulder as he left Fortescue’s, resettling Penny onto his shoulder.
be on time.” He shut the door to Draco’s room, leaving him with no more answers than he had previously.
“I had to…” Harry says softly “I didn't want to. But I had to. He had to kill the piece of himself that lived in me.”
“I’m assuming you have something to tell us Hermione - and that you didn’t intend to simply grill Harry over his lack of progress publicly?” Draco drawls from his side. It sounds like an insult, and Harry wants to rise to it.
They make it through that first summer together. It fades into fall, and winter, and into spring of the next year, and they’re still together. Often, in the middle of it all, Draco will look at Harry and think ‘
When they get to the door and he’s told her all he can, she thanks him quietly and slips inside. He's left standing in the hallway, outside a door he can’t enter. Hermione finds him half an hour later, which he thinks probably isn’t a good sign regarding Draco's health.
to wear before Harry knocked on his door. He dug through one of the piles until he produced a pair of his more casual black slacks, and a nice white button down. Casting a quick charm to rid them of wrinkles, he dressed and stepped in front of the mirror, frowning. He and Harry had very different definitions of
“It’s not over yet,” Harry all but whispered back, taking them up into the air even higher, and angling back towards the city.
Minutes later he’s walking towards the operating room they’re treating Draco in, frantically explaining his work to a healer in eye-wateringly green robes. He doesn’t know her name.
“Draco,” he says softly, when the blond man winces at the mention of Myrtle’s bathroom and sixth year, “I don’t think I ever apologized for that. I’m so sorry. I never should have hurt you. I should have tried to help you.” He feels a little bit like crying.
“Harry Potter! Just the man I was hoping to see today!” Florian gave him a once over, grinning broadly, before he noticed Penny. “And who is this little creature? You must have stopped over at the Menagerie today?”
Harry's sitting with Malfoy to his left, Ron and Hermione across from them. They’re a round in, and it’s Hermione's turn to buy.
Draco dressed quickly, sending the slacks and button down back to their proper place, and taking a moment to fuss with his hair in the en-suite bathroom mirror, before emerging into the living room to find Harry engrossed in his mobile.
at the zoo tomorrow, I will come with you to karaoke night. And I will not sing any Britney Spears. ABBA is still fair game though!”
“Mate, you were supposed to meet us in the atrium 20 minutes ago. It’s Friday - let’s get on with it, yeah?” Ron replies.
Vaguely he wonders if this is how Harry had felt when Sirius died. He feels a bit like sicking up. He catches the end of a rousing speech Neville is delivering while limping forward, he prepares himself to fight. And then Harry launches himself from Hagrid's arms and Draco is screaming, and crying, and it’s chaos until it’s not.
Harry put him down on the blanket before settling in himself. He pulled Draco against his chest, leaning them back until they were both staring up into the infinite fabric of stars above them.
Draco settles on what Harry has come to think of as his side of the room, even though he’s only been in Harry’s living room once before, on one end of the couch. He folds his long legs up below him and tucks his toes in between the couch cushions, placing the popcorn next to him, in easy reach. “So what’s this movie I’ll be quoting for the rest of my life?” He takes the DVD case from Harry while Harry slips the disk into the player. “And why are you still using DVDs? Hermione and Ron talk at length about the wonders of
Harry accelerated gently, and carried them away from the Ether Monument, over a set of bronze duck statues, and into the air above the Boston Commons. They soared over the Frog Pond, and around the Soldiers and Sailors Monument; they looped the Commons Carousel, and flew over the historic Granary Burying Ground, the light slowly fading and the sky turning periwinkle around them.
“Are you happy?” Harry asked him, carrying him towards a beach blanket Draco hadn’t noticed him conjure earlier.
So he does. Harry leans in slowly, watching for any sign of pain in Draco’s expression. He tilts Draco’s face toward him gently with the palm on his cheek. When they’re inches apart, he lets his eyes fall closed and softly presses their lips together.
Draco huffed and bit back a smile of his own. “I thought you were taking me somewhere, you can undress me any regular Tuesday night you know.”
“Nothing, Nothing” Ginny smiles again, swirling a glass of wine Harry could swear she didn’t have a second ago. “So tell me about how you didn’t want to snog Malfoy the entire time we were in school?”
“What?” He asks. “We’re using first names now. Is that really that shocking?” Ron’s jaw clicks closed.
Draco pressed his face into the side of Harry’s neck as Harry stepped over piles of shirts and slacks, before depositing Draco gently on his bed and stepping towards the closet.
Harry kicks her under the table “You’re worse than Hermione! Why do I talk to any of you?”  He groans.
“Staring.” Ron replies, starting to snicker. “Specifically staring at one very ferret-y looking blond.” Hermione elbows him in the ribs again.
They make dinners and lunches and breakfasts together, working in companionable silence. Sometimes Harry pulls Draco from what he's working on and spins him around the giant kitchen table in a slightly clumsy slow dance. There’s always enough for their friends to join them for a meal when they come by. Harry won’t eat grapefruit, but he always makes extra bacon.
“I thought of them, I won't lie to you. But Draco, I thought of you too, and you don’t need to say goodbye. I'm never going anywhere again. I swear, Draco, I promise.” Harry’s nearly too quiet to hear.
“I didn't even realize I was attracted to him until sixth year when Pansy was hanging all over him.” Harry starts. “I just… thought everyone thought he was pretty. And it’s not like I’d exactly been taught what bisexuality was before I turned seventeen.” He frowns. “I thought I just felt guilty and that maybe there was something else wrong with me, when I went to the Hospital Wing those times. It was never… Nothing ever...” He stops.
Harry walked around the table to wrap his arms around his husband’s waist, pressing a kiss to his temple. Draco leaned into him, reaching a hand up to scratch the back of Penny’s head.
Harry laughed. “That sounded like such a line, I know. But I did mean it literally - you’re going to want to be warmer and more comfortable than that for what I have in mind.” He paused and winked. “I can, however, take it off you later if you’re not opposed.”
“Jasmine Green sounds lovely, though i’m intrigued by the sound of the Ginger Peach.” Draco says, settling into the chair and resting his forearms on the table.
“I love you too, more than you know,” Harry replied, surging up to catch Draco’s lips in a kiss that lit him up from the inside out.
“Oh don’t be like that!” She kicks him under the table. “But Harry, you’ve gotta admit - it’s sort of weird.”
He clears his throat. “We’re going to head out, I think. If that’s alright with you both.” Ron turns to him with a knowing smirk.
.” Ron says, pointedly. “Please tell me that’s not what you’re thinking. Draco's still a pain in my arse sometimes, but he’s a good partner and a better person. He's changed since school.” He eyes Harry over his mostly empty pint glass, like he’s considering saying more.
“Peanut butter and grape jelly! So I set myself to it and I think it’s turned out rather fantastic! Would you like a scoop?”
Harry sputters “I - it wasn’t - he was up to - I was right!!” he settles on eventually. “And besides,” he continues, frowning harder “we’re even friendly now - you more so than me, you’re partners!” He points an accusing finger in Ron's direction, and he at least has the decency to flush a little.
“I think I’m just going to go home actually, but thank you for being willing to leave on my account, Harry.” Draco replies, gently pulling his arm away.
“Oof – maybe don’t crush the talent.” Potter wheezed out below him, the air whistling from his lungs in a steady stream.
“She’s an idiot. Let’s get Ron and Hermione and go somewhere else.” Harry does then touch Draco’s wrist, startling him into movement. “I hadn’t placed our orders yet. We’ll go over to the Kelpie. Hermione will be pleased.”
“Gin, no. It wasn’t like that.” Harry takes her hand across the table “I was probably being more unfair to you than the other way around.” He sighs “Do you really want an explanation, or just to heckle me?”
Harry wheeled the bike around, pointing towards the Harbor and the Atlantic beyond. Draco stared off into the vanishing horizon, wondering what Harry was planning. He kicked the bike into gear and they sped forward into the darkness, the city falling away behind them. They passed over the Harbor again, and flew past Logan Airport, soaring out over the open ocean. Draco thought they would have stopped once they were further out to look back at the lights of the city from a distance, but Harry flew on.
Harry laughed as he shut the door behind him, heading out into the crisp air with Penny flopped over his shoulder. He stopped at Quality Quidditch first, picking up some new tins of broom polish and maintenance kits to keep the school issue brooms serviced, before heading into Flourish and Blotts to pick up the new cookbook he’d pre- ordered last month. He stopped by Luna’s boutique, picking up some chunks of aventurine to hand out to particularly broom-shy students.
Hermione laughs politely and turns all business. “Really though - Anthony over at Mungos said you’d brought someone in.” The two of them get up from the booth.
Approximately thirty minutes later they’re sitting in front of piles of seasoned curly fries, sparkling waters, and their entrees. Harry’s particularly excited for the gyro he ordered, when Hermione starts in.
Draco took a deep breath and launched himself forward, flying upward before falling back towards the sand. But before he could hit the ground, he felt Harry’s arms come up to catch him.
“Alright…” Draco yawns himself, “Scientists did a study that found kissing is the least effective way to spread germs. Followed closely by…” he pauses to yawn again “coughing and sneezing. Touch is the most effective.”
“Draco. Draco. Don’t cry. Please don’t cry.” His tears seem to wake Harry, and he tries to soothe him, dragging a hand up and down his spine “I’m okay really. I’m alive and I’m here and it’s over. We’re safe. You did it. I’m so proud of you. It’s over. I’m alive.”
Harry liked with his tongue. That usually got Draco what he wanted, so this was a sudden break from normal.
“That I always asked to see the lights as a child. She reminds me regularly. No one’s ever put this much effort into a date for me before, Harry.”
The soft light from his wand casts grim shadows over the asphodel petals, causing them to look grey rather than white. They were close to the bottom of the bedpost, where he had kicked them away from him.
“Yes!” Pansy agreed with him, raising her hand to get something from the pile of goods they had arranged in the middle of the picnic blanket. “I miss playing in the snow…” she commented, biting into the cauldron cake. “I can’t remember when was the last time we did it,” All the young men murmured in agreement to that. “I also miss your singing, Draco. I hope you don’t quit music classes nor choir as well, it’d be a pity.”
“So,” Myrtle said, pulling at a lock of her translucent hair, “I’ve also heard someone’s been nice to you.”
Macmillan’s eyes lowered to Draco’s chest and paled instantly. Draco raised his eyebrows while the Hufflepuff hurriedly left the room, followed by Terry Boot. Draco began to lower his head when Potter’s hands caught his attention.
Even with the warning, the students who participated in the D.A. seemed to seek out the Slytherins to prevent fights.
, Draco recalled. The sole memory of Potter’s magic surrounding him like a warm blanket made Draco’s hairs stand on end.
Draco shot him a nasty glare, but his tone came out more tired than bothered, “Potter and I… How many times have I already said we’ve got no chance at anything after that first day?”
Draco thanked him with a small smile of his own and took the mug. He warmed his fingers against the hot transparent surface of the mug.
“WegottagodothingsbeforePotionsbye!” Draco said in one breath, closing his hands on Blaise’s and Pansy’s wrists, dragging them along before Potter could say something else or notice the flower had vanished.
“Well,” Draco resolved to make himself at home, sitting against one of the sinks. His shoulders slumped. Being constantly on alert for anything harmful that might come from other students was taking a toll on him; he was mentally exhausted and physically drained. “I can’t blame them for trying to make me feel as miserable as I made some of them feel those past years.”
Harry wondered, while staring at the sunken-eyed Ravenclaw from across the hallway, if they had blood on their hands. How many of these
“You had six months before the flowers came in sixth year,” Draco mumbled incoherently, “It took the asphodels one year to come out. You can make them go away again, so don-“
Harry passed through the pyramidal hole in the wall. Inside, there were only a few people lazing about. The common room was decorated in black to prevent any arguments about one house being favoured over the others, but some things were altered to make it more welcoming to everybody.
The caster of the protective spell was just a few metres away from the Slytherins. Sitting under a tree and reading a thick Herbology book was a round-faced, tall, chubby, blond-haired boy. Neville Longbottom. He had his wand raised in their direction, clearly protecting the Slytherins from another prank. Longbottom had appeared without any of them noticing him there, but within distance to do something if needed. Longbottom got rid of the mess and went back to his book as if nothing had happened.
Ron turned his head and began talking to him, but Harry couldn’t for the life of him focus on what it was. Harry’s mind was occupied with much more important dilemmas.
“I’ve heard he’s staying with first years from all houses day in, day out,” Blaise pointed out, towelling Draco’s hair to stop the blond from saying anything. “He’s making room in his busy schedule just for you, can you
remained incognito. That had turned out to be an unsuccessful tactic in the long run. Atreus revealed himself as guilty as Petra, while Pansy had been mostly innocent. She appeared on the front covers of many Wizarding publications several times for telling suspicious things she overheard in her house while growing up.
Arrombado do caralho means something like 'cum-dumpster, shit-eating fucktard' or worse. This particular cursing is loaded with hatred, so I struggled a lot to find an equivalent cursing that could convey the same feeling!
The first thing he laid eyes on, was the boy in front of him: Harry Potter. He was half-hidden in shadows, as the curtains on Draco’s bed had been partially closed at some point during the night. Draco could clearly see one of his eyes, twinkling like emeralds due to the pale light of the dawn that began to invade the room.
“Sorry, D,” Pansy said softly, her black wide eyes trained on him with regret. “Was just trying to lighten things up.”
As much as the other houses would claim the Slytherins were pure evil, most of them had never stopped to think what their parents were really up to. Many Slytherins spoke of how desensitising it was to read about the murders, disappearances and the havoc their parents and family members had caused during the Dark Lord’s First Rise and the Second. It did not feel real; it felt mostly like reading about historical events. They were all lost in the aftermath of their families’ deeds, not knowing what to do.
, he thought bitterly. Drowned in desperation, Draco couldn’t see clearly. His mind was running rampant for solutions, and he chose the easiest ones. They weren’t the best ones, though.
Throughout his seven years at Hogwarts, Harry had grown accustomed to seeing Malfoy surrounded by thorns, the stems tightly twining along his body like a shield. Harry always ended up with torn clothes and skin covered in scratches and punctures from those sharp thorns. He remembered that every time he brawled with Malfoy, he would later have to be healed by Madam Pomfrey. In his first year, being as clueless about the Wizarding World as he was, Harry didn’t know why the hell Draco Malfoy had thorns on his body. Ron had had to explain to him that Draco Malfoy suffered from an ancient blood curse.
“I like to own my media.” Harry laughs. “And you’ve got no idea what the difference is anyway, so there’s no reason to take such a haughty tone.” He tosses a piece of popcorn at Draco’s forehead as he settles on the opposite end of the couch.
“Harry, what is taking you so long? Ron is going to expire from thirst.” He snarks, before noticing the witch in front of them, who is now staring openly from his left arm to Harry’s forehead. “Oh. Hello.” He says to her, surprised. “Harry, do you know this woman?”
They drink too much with Ron and Hermione, with Ginny and Pansy, with Blaise and Millie and Theo and Luna. They go to dinners and lunches and weekly Sunday brunches at the Burrow. They watch Teddy when Andromeda can’t pull herself out of bed. They testify at trial after trial. Draco worries for a month that the Wizengamot won’t believe he was a spy and will throw him in Azkaban. Harry talks himself and Draco in circles about if he should face punishment for his morally grey behavior in the war.
“Hello, Harry!” Ginny says brightly as she sits down at their biweekly lunch together two days later. They’re somewhere in Portugal, because Ginny is doing some sort of press thing for the Harpies that involves hopping across Europe at high speeds and taking lots of intense-looking photos at famous landmarks and tourist attractions, both muggle and wix. He’s confused by the job, but appreciates the chance to travel to see her. He ought to leave England more on his own time.
“Oh, so now you’ll admit you’re talented?” Draco wheezed back. “In that case I think we’ll all just stay here.”
Ron and Hermione exchange a look, the kind that Harry takes to mean they’re setting up some sort of silent bet about him, again. He dislikes the thought.
“You’ll see. We need to get going in a second anyway. Up you get.” Harry nudged Draco out of his lap, standing up himself and walking to the center of the room. He produced a muggle pencil with a very chewed looking eraser from a pocket somewhere in the interior of his jacket, and held one end out to Draco.
Outside the window the lights of London seemed to glow against a shockingly clear sky. Draco crossed the room and dropped onto the couch next to his boyfriend, trying to catch a glimpse of what Harry was so invested in. He caught sight of the weather app, but didn’t manage to see the location before Harry turned off the screen and bumped their shoulders together.
Draco tried to duck away from Potter’s arm, failed to escape in time, and found himself pressed against the side of Potter’s chest, heartbeat thumping in his ear.
“Mmmm. I’ll have to be here at the appropriate time to try it someday then.” Draco hums, before going a soft shade of pink as he realizes the different ways his comment might be taken. Harry huffs a laugh to himself, thinking along what he hopes are similar lines.
“Call me Harry. You call Ron and Hermione by their names, and they call you Draco. You should call me Harry.” Harry doubles down, realizing that somewhere over the course of the evening he’s finally started thinking of Draco as
She smacks her forehead “Go on? Harry there is literally only one person who used that title and spent just as much time staring at you as you did him. Go on??”
Malfoy heads after her, leaving Harry to take a deep breath, and attempt to clear the clean slightly spicy scent of Malfoy from his lungs. As he trails along behind the other three he watches Malfoy pull up next to Hermione and strike up an easy conversation.
“I think you agreed to undress me a little earlier in the evening?” Draco asked, and Harry laughed below him.
.” Harry smirked, leaning into Draco’s space to press a soft kiss to his cheek. “You look lovely, but you are definitely overdressed.” He leaned back to grin at Draco.  “If you let me inside, maybe I can help you dress a little more er, appropriately?”
“I. Er. I…” Harry abandons all pretense of focusing on his lunch and scratches the back of his neck.
“Go! It's fine. Be safe, please?” Harry shoos him towards the floo, and Draco goes without hesitation. The fire crackles, Draco calls out his office address, and he’s gone.
From the way his face was pressed into Potter’s chest, he had a great view of the door, and was therefore immediately aware of Minerva McGonagall’s presence, as indicated by the heavy leather boots she usually wore.
“I haven’t got any Jasmine Green or Ginger Peach tea,” he says apologetically, “is Earl Grey alright?”
Draco isn’t in the next morning. Hermione says something about Ron and him being needed for raid prep, something happening at noon. Ron had left the house at 11:30 and hadn’t come back last night.
Draco commutes to Hogwarts every day to retake his sixth and seventh years, and to sit his NEWTs. Harry doesn’t bother. Instead he spends his time at The Burrow relearning to love cooking with Molly. Harry learns to blend muggle and magic techniques seamlessly. He takes over dinner nearly every night of the week. He finds renewed joy in hosting parties for their friends. He talks to Draco about opening a restaurant in Diagon Alley.
Harry yawned and shuffled downstairs into the kitchen, stopping in the doorway to watch Draco as he shimmied around the kitchen in one of Harry’s old Gryffindor quidditch tees and a pair of his favorite black boxers. He walked up behind his husband and wrapped his arms around his waist, pressing his chest to Draco’s back and nipping soft kisses to the join of his shoulder and neck. Draco startled slightly and leaned back into Harry, very nearly dropping his head back right on top of Penny. Harry jerked his shoulder out of the way, and Draco spun in his arms, off balance and tilting towards the counter. Harry took in wide grey eyes, startled and unsteady, as they passed over his face and across to his shoulder, widening somehow impossibly more as he registered Penny’s presence.
“I’m sorry.” Harry goes for a self deprecating smile, but if the twist of Draco’s face is any indication, he misses by a wide margin. “Would you like to come through so I can make it up to you with tea?”
articles about his role in the War. Harry keeps him going as Lucius is sent to Azkaban for life, as Narcissa is put under house arrest.
“Shush! Ron.” She cuts a glance at Harry, like she’s checking that he didn’t notice her intervention - as though he can’t clearly see her, and her aggressive elbowing.
They head to the kitchen, and Harry uses a muggle microwave to pop two bags of cinema select popcorn that he picked up at Tesco’s earlier in the day. He pours them into a bowl, and dumps a whole bag of dark chocolate M&Ms in after, like he used to see Dudely do as a child. He was never allowed to try, and now he does it any time he watches a film. Draco prefers dark chocolate, so that’s what he got this time.
.” He complains one day. “They want me because of my name. Not because I'm particularly good at charms or potions or because I'll be good at the job.”
“Can I walk you home at least?” Harry asks a little desperately, realizing that the highlight of these nights hasn’t been the drinking in a while, it’s the quiet walks home with just Draco.
Draco's smile looks a little like it hurts — but it’s blinding all the same. “I thought you’d never ask.” He whispers.
“I do,” Draco replied, now holding the platypus around its middle like Teddy did with his stuffed kelpie, and looking as though this was a perfectly normal state of affairs.
“Harry, come on. They'll tell us when we can see him. Please.” She pulls him to a waiting room, where Ron is sitting. The three of them sit in silence, one of them holding each of his hands, for what feels like hours. Eventually the same healer from before comes to find them.
Laughing, Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s waist once more. He lifted Draco off the ground, bringing his other hand to Draco’s back as Draco squawked and wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist.
Which is ridiculous of course - he can’t be in love with Draco. They hardly really know each other. They’ve only just started spending time together without Ron and Hermione around, escorting Draco home when he’s drunk on pub nights doesnt count. But that isn’t entirely true either is it? They’ve known each other since they were eleven. They’ve put up with a decade and a half of each other. They’ve gone from a petty schoolyard rivalry, to active antagonism, to mutual toleration, to tentative friendship, to whatever this is. So it very much could be love, at least on Harry’s part. But he’ll never know if he never does anything about it.
Draco lifted the necklace out of the box, moving to examine the ring more closely. A tiny skull with black gemstones for eyes winked at him in the moonlight, surrounded by two raven wings, one on each side. Below the lower jaw of the skull, a curling banner with a cursive B rested. It was clearly a Black family heirloom, one that had been taken very good care of. He raised his eyes to Harry’s expectant face.
“Are you cold?” Harry whispered, pulling Draco flush against his chest once again, and nuzzling into the side of his neck.
They go with The Hollow because it’s simple, easy to remember, and reminds Harry of both The Burrow and his parents.
“I'm not! I don't think Malfoy's up to something.” Harry feels his face heat and not for the first time he thanks the combination of low lighting and his own tanned skin for hiding his blush.
Some nights Draco wakes up screaming, tasting the burning room of hidden things on his tongue and seeing Harry's limp body in Hagrid's arms. Harry crushes him to his chest, combs through his hair, and whispers to him until he calms down.
He’d thought that more people might want to get a look at Penny while he was out, but surprisingly, they mostly left him alone. The months after the war he’d been unable to step into Diagon without being mobbed, and it had taken over a year for the last of the attention to die down, especially once he had publicly stated he wasn’t going to take the offered position with the Auror corps. It had been a problem again after he and Draco had been photographed by
So he doesn’t listen. He doesn’t even really hear her. He's too busy trying not to choke on memories of wild black hair and sharp green eyes. His mind spins him back to the end of 5th year, everything about his life collapsing when Lucius went to Azkaban. Finding out he was the next Malfoy slated to be a death eater, going to Dumbledore and begging for help. Being told to do it anyway — to play the spy. Forging an uneasy truce with the Golden Trio which had slowly grown into real friendship. Sneaking from the Slytherin common room to Gryffindor tower, games of exploding snap and chess that turned steadily into late night conversations about fears and hopes and dreams. Falling asleep pressed against Harry from shoulder to thigh, first accidentally, then on purpose. The slow slide from rivals to unlikely friends to snogging in hallways and empty classrooms and in a four-poster with scarlet sheets.
Harry’s body became small in a heartbeat, and by the time Ron opened the door for him and the other boys behind him to enter, Harry was a huge black cat bolting through their legs.
. It was quite interesting to see Lungwort conclude that the Benedictus Curse derived from the possession of a modified Deathly Hallow. Except for the Cloak of Invisibility, all the Hallows had been produced by Death in an attempt to trick their owners into their graves early. Therefore, Lungwort had a theory about the fourth Hallow passing by blood so the wizards would be led to gruesome ends as sacrifices to quench Death’s thirst for revenge.
thing away from Potter’s hands. That was proof of his feelings, and Draco didn’t want Potter walking around with that blatant ‘I fancy you’ symbol all over the school.
At the name, Blaise and Pansy flinched. Draco had only told them at the start of term what had happened. Before that, it was complicated to visit each other and even more to send Owls. Draco couldn’t exchange letters with Blaise and Pansy because the Ministry had confiscated every Owl at Malfoy Manor. The Floo Network had been magically blocked. He and his Mum could only leave if each were accompanied by a pair of Aurors. Apparating was the only thing allowed. Well, side-along Apparating. The Malfoys couldn’t be trusted to not try to Apparate to Merlin-knows-where and evade the Aurors.
“You alright, mate?” Ron said, looking worried. Harry nodded with a smile, trying to reassure his best friend that everything was fine.
Blaise’s face was still tight with concern. Draco sighed, letting his fork clatter on the plate. Blaise braced himself, fully prepared to endure a fit.
Finnegan, Macmillan, and Boot were standing close to Draco’s four-poster bed, looking at him with wariness. Draco registered that only because he saw Potter’s hand make a ‘stay there’ gesture. A long, long time passed while Potter and Draco stood like that: eyes locked, chests rising and falling in sync. Inhaling deeply. Slowly exhaling. Repeating, as Draco leaned his sweat-slicked back against the cool glass window closest to his bed.
Draco's nightmare affect his body and he suspects they're more than something made up by his broken, conflicted mind. There's a call from the darkness.
, Pansy. We’re not talking about palpable things, like a potion or a particularly difficult spell to perform. It’s
“I do,” Draco answered her, leaning his back against the sink and rolling up the sleeves of his jumper. “My whole family is destined to suffer from past karma, Myrtle. Why would it be different with me? How could they treat me differently, after all I have said and done?”
Draco had always been proud about how the Slytherin House had such a majestic common room and dormitories. Now, they weren’t in the dungeons anymore. Draco was now forced to share a common room with Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors. The dorm was a show of colours, each bed sheet and curtains the colour of the person’s house. There wasn’t a predominant colour in the common room anymore, instead everything was black with a few personal touches the students were allowed to add to the decorations.
He had the book propped on his thighs while he ate slowly, savouring the rich flavours of the food. It was as if many things had different tastes now. Harry didn’t remember ever eating something with that particular level of richness at the Great Hall.
warned me when he saw me training Occlumency.” Draco told them. “He said there was a high chance of worsening my… condition. And here
At every one of his attempts to clear his mind and focus on counterspells, his eyes would land on the yellow and purple flower and distract him.
Basically, the Merlin Tower was a mixture of all houses. The black-stoned fireplace held the Hogwarts crest above the mantel, and the wall on its right had an enchanted window showing the bottom of the Great Lake. The wall on its left had a floor-to-ceiling window showing a beautiful view of the castle grounds. The inside wall where the Merlin portrait was located had shelves covering every surface, filled to bursting with books.
Draco tutted, rolling his eyes “I figured people would start to gossip about me and Potter being on friendly-terms...” Although he was amused by all that attention, his face fell after her mentioning of Quidditch; Draco lowered his head, his fringe falling over his eyes. “I quit. Indeed.”
“Draco…” whispered Blaise, placing a comforting hand on the blond’s shoulder. “Take as long as you need. We’re not going anywhere if you want to talk.”
So, to live he had to endure his feelings. Shame, fear, pain. Feel them all. Live with his choices and understand that what he did in the past was just that: the past. He now has a chance for a new present and an unknown future ahead.
Harry knew she would now think he was jealous rather than bothered by the lack of some private time. “If you felt left out, all you had to do was tell us, Harry,” Hermione tried to reassure him, as expected. Harry sighed.
“Here,” Blaise extended a mug of hot cocoa to Draco, interrupting the blond’s sulking, “this is good for the soul,” he smiled lightly.
– of carnations curling around his legs, arms, torso – everywhere. The petals were small, delicate looking. Draco knew why they were small. That emotion wasn’t as intense as the raw horror that shook him to his core to the point of awakening some minutes ago.
Just as Pansy was opening her mouth to say something, probably a retort to Blaise's insulting words against purity of blood, they heard a flap of wings followed by an explosion above their heads.
They were silent for a few minutes. Myrtle came to ‘sit’ beside him, hugging her legs against her chest. Gently, she said “You don’t believe in that, do you? Justified harassment, that is.”
. His long fingers grazed lightly against the long green curtains that shielded him from the other boys in the dormitory.
“I would never, Myrtle,” the blond reassured her, smiling at her excitement after hearing his words, “I apologise for not coming earlier. There are so many things going on at the same time, that my life has descended into a new level of chaos.”
under my boots.” Theo shook his head, his almond-shaped eyes wide open and tears running freely. “I could never see them like that.”
Potions class was dismissed after four long hours. Harry could feel his head pounding from thinking too much. He wanted to become an Auror but his failings in Potions might stop his dream. Ron and Hermione, who had gotten up before Harry, were walking with the mass of students trying to leave the classroom. Harry pulled the strap of his satchel over his shoulder and headed to the door. As he was getting closer to the table where Parkinson, Zabini, and Malfoy sat, he noticed a few dead leaves on the floor. Harry stared at Malfoy’s back while he continued toward the door, and caught sight of a dry, wrinkled leaflet floating down from his sleeve to the floor.
Draco felt his chest tightening. He sustained his weight on his arms as he pulled himself from the floor. He adjusted himself against the sink, sitting properly and crossing his legs, before looking at her. “And I promise I’ll always visit you, no matter what.”
“Oh…” she frowned, fidgeting slightly. “I presume you’ve stricken Quidditch off your list of possible careers, then?”
“Alright, everyone. You did good for today, thank you!” Professor Kowalski said cheerfully, dismissing them from the class.
Malfoy appeared too thin, evident by the large cuff sleeves; they did not conceal Malfoy's bony wrists well. Malfoy was more relaxed now in comparison to the way he was at breakfast; his tie remained on his shoulder, unknotted. The top buttons on the collar of his shirt were unfastened, revealing his Adam’s apple and partially his collarbone. They were too prominent.
It was as if there were ghostly fingers touching his skin, vicious claws closing on his limbs to try and drag him to the Other Side to quench their thirst for revenge.
“Hermione, can’t you drop it?” He lost it, then. He slammed the book on his thighs, and the silence in the library made the sound echo throughout the corridor. “I am fine, I am not panicking because I’m thinking there are snakes in here!”
It was a blow to the chest, listening to Blaise’s words. It was against everything they had ever heard throughout their lives and yet…
Blaise gave him a tired smile, pulling himself to his feet. “He left. Thought it was better to leave you with friends instead of, and I quote, ‘a stranger’.” Blaise snorted, caressing the short hair at the nape of Draco’s neck. “He slept in your bed, calmed you from a nightmare-induced panic attack,” Blaise caught the towel that Theo picked from the sinks and threw at the blond’s face, wrapping it around Draco, “but he
They were not the only ones. Pairs or trios of people kept close to other groups of Slytherins. Draco imagined some of them were not thrilled about it, but they found a way to socialise and chill with their respective friends while helping the D.A. control the bullying.
she mouthed good-humouredly to Blaise, discreetly raising her own mug in a toast for appeasing Draco’s moodiness. Blaise toasted back, with a smile of his own.
Draco clung to Harry and pressed his nose against the warmth of his back, breathing in Harry's scent as it mingled with the salty ocean breeze. He pressed his eyes shut tightly, and waited. A few moments later, Harry began to slow the bike. Draco was certain they hadn’t been flying long enough to have reached their mystery destination, but he opened his eyes to look around all the same.
“Sorry Aunt Minerva, but Draco started it!” Potter managed to unsettle them all from on top of him, spilling Weasley and Granger into a heap on the floor, and finally releasing Draco from the headlock he’d been put in.
for the first time, and again when they’d gotten engaged, and yet a third time when they’d finally gotten married last year. Today he was getting some strange looks, but no one had attempted to dose him with
They walked past the lion enclosure, and the reptile house, past the parrots and zebras until they reached the platypus pond towards the back of the Australian section. Harry squeezed Penny once more before handing her to Draco, who scratched the back of her neck and pressed a tiny kiss to her bill. Before he could start to levitate her over the glass enclosure wall though, Harry reached out and snatched her back.
“Honestly Harry, it’s going to take more than one drunk witch to ruin my self esteem.” Draco smiles at him. “I’ve just been taking the day to read, and I didn’t much feel like getting dressed. No need to worry your pretty little head over me.”
“It was a present from Ginny. It’s delicious, but better for the morning than this late at night I think.” Harry pulls out two mugs and sets the kettle to boiling after filling it the muggle way. He always feels that an
“What are you wearing?” Harry had to hold back a laugh as he took in Draco’s outfit. He was in black from head to toe, including a black cap fit over his hair, and black gloves.
“Go. Living room, or we’ll eat it all before we even get the movie on.” Harry nudges Draco towards the doorway, laughing when he puts up mock resistance and presses their shoulders together for a split second before moving.
Harry waited until Draco had gone back to his breakfast and hidden himself behind the Quibbler, before he snagged a bit of his scrambled egg and held it flat in his palm in front of Penny. He watched her snuffle against his hand for a moment, before snapping up the egg. She bumped his hand with her forehead, and snuggled deeper into his lap as he sunk his other hand into the fur of her back.
“Ron! Not here!” Harry feels his entire face heat up, “Literally everyone in this family can spell except maybe Victorie and she doesn’t even know who he is.”
Draco jerked backwards, away from Potter’s hands, but it didn’t matter. Potter practically climbed into his lap, bracing himself against Draco’s shoulders for stability. He nearly toppled forward, and Draco automatically brought his hand up to Potter’s hip to steady him.
“This is a great help ‘Mione. We’ll start checking them out tomorrow.” He says, grabbing her hand and kissing her knuckles gently.
Harry didn’t reply, still laughing as he used one of his feet to nudge the door to Draco’s room open. He stopped short in the doorway, taking in the catastrophe that was Draco’s closet strewn about the room.
“Please Harry, call me Florian. I’d appreciate it if you’d do me the honor at least once before I die.”
Draco frowns at that. “Ron and Hermione talk about movies a lot, but I can’t say I’ve seen many myself.”
Draco laughed aloud as they sped back towards town, flying above the Atheneum, rushing over cobbled streets and sweeping down Main Street, streetlights blurring as they approached the Sound.
“Could you? Could you just explain to me how you’re dealing with the slashing curse you’re untangling?” Draco asks, looking shy and vulnerable over the hearth.
He goes back to the table and tells Ron and Hermione what happened. None of them much feel like drinking anymore, and they all leave soon after without ordering anything. Harry can’t help but wonder what Draco is doing all by himself.
It was a short walk, and before long they were standing in front of the locked front gate. Harry watched as Draco cast, whispering spells under his breath to unlock the gates and disable the security systems while they slipped into the zoo.
Harry pushes aside his disappointment and throws himself into his work — he’s so close to cracking the
For as well as things were going at work on Friday, they’re slow come the new week. Harry makes no progress on breaking the
“You’re here. That’s more than enough.” Harry looked up at Draco so earnestly Draco felt his heart stutter in his chest. “Just one second, let me find it.” Harry went back to rummaging in the extended interior pockets of his jacket, eventually producing a long, thin box, wrapped in shiny green paper.
. Hermione makes marginally more progress on finding its origin - it seems that Harry wasn’t the only one to benefit from Snape’s old book at Hogwarts. Harry also makes no progress on his feelings for Draco.
Dinner was a quiet affair overall. Draco knocked at his ankles a few times, and Harry did his best to meet it with a smile each time it happened. He knew he was going to lose the bet if he didn’t get ahold of himself, but he was starting to think that doing the dishes for a week might actually be worth keeping Penny around.
Harry’s not sure who drifts off first. When they blink awake facing each other across the room in the early morning light, neither says anything. Harry makes two mugs of Ginger Peach tea.
Just as quickly as he appeared, Ron disappears back into the fray without so much as a backwards glance. Hermione finds Harry still standing there two minutes later, and asks if he’s seen Ron about anywhere.
And if the two of them collapse into each other and cling for hours when they’re out of the public eye, it’s nobody’s business but theirs.
“I meant it, you know.” They’re keeping their voices low — the only light in the room coming from the moon through the window.
“Just please don’t let this be a repeat of sixth year, mate. You don’t sleep enough as it is.” Ron does his best to look contrite when he says it, but the wide grin spreading across his face sort of ruins the effect.
Draco looked around the car park - the sun was starting to set for real, golden light reflecting off Harry’s glasses, burnishing his hair nearly bronze.
“No, I know. I wasn’t sure earlier. I am now though.” She nudges his menu back into his hands. “Pick something so we can go up and order and I’ll be able to tell you sooner.” She dives back into her own menu, humming over the merits of falafel versus chicken in her shawarma.
He let her down from his shoulder as they settled in to eat dinner, placing her on the table next to him. He could feel Draco’s eyes on him as he loaded up his plate with panang curry and larb gai, but he wouldn’t meet his husband’s gaze until he’d taken his first bite, not wanting Draco to know just how sad the thought of returning Penny to the zoo made him.
Draco Malfoy walks past their table in the ministry canteen and Harry cuts himself off mid-sentence. He tries valiantly to keep his head from rotating on his neck, eyes trained on the other man’s receding back, but all that results in is a full body turn as he tracks Malfoy's progress through the midday crowd.
Even though he was occupied with the children, Potter had quickly knocked over three Gryffindors that tried to hex Draco from behind. “Morning,” Potter chirped while passing Draco to get to the Eighth-year table.
Harry heard the unmistakable drawling voice and blinked several times to refocus his vision. It was Malfoy, his tone clearly guarded.
“While I was there, in Azkaban, we had to endure some bloody Aurors reading out loud from Skeeter’s book.” Draco told them, to which his friends looked back at him in sympathy.
They did a collective wince. Colin Creevey was an annoying little brat that pestered a lot of people with his camera and overly-cheerful disposition. While they were being escorted back to the dungeons and away from the Battle, Pansy told them she had seen him among the fighters.
“Shit!” Draco hissed, putting his hand on his arm by reflex as if it were the gesture rather than him controlling his own emotions, that would banish the thorns. “Shit!”
It would have been completely dismissed, that book, because everybody knew Skeeter’s sensationalistic tendencies.
“I was afraid he’d get my mum in a coffin rather than Azkaban,” Pansy murmured. “She must be really good at hiding if she got away from his squad.”
“C’mon, you bastard,“ he slid to the floor, tiredly resting his head against the dark wood. “Don’t give up now.”
Oh, Remus... Remembering Remus became too painful. Harry saw Remus’ eyes in Teddy’s. The shape of Remus’ face, as well. Harry’s beloved godson, the little turquoise-haired baby that adored flying around on his small broomstick... Teddy had the most wonderful laugh, as most children did. Sadness had not touched his innocent soul yet. Teddy didn’t know how much he had lost at such a young age.
Two things happened in that class. One: Draco had his own ass handed to him on a silver platter, as Potter had successfully landed every spell on Draco. That was the proof the blond could not, indeed, clear his mind from the fact that
“This was my favorite beach when I was young. Mother and I would come out here while Father was busy with investments and I would climb on the Jetty until she panicked and called me back.”
“He heard it in some muggle film we accidentally caught on the telly last night.” Hermione provides. “I was mostly asleep but he seems convinced they actually blew up an ice cream truck.” She shrugs and moves to follow her boyfriend.
Lifting off from the lagoon, Harry took them around the Ether Monument, slowing so Draco could get a good look at the statue head on.
Instead of replying Harry pressed the fingers of one hand into the nape of Draco’s neck, and crushed their mouths together gracelessly. Draco froze, eyes wide.
“I’ve got no idea if she can even have ice cream, but she does seem interested,” Harry laughed, holding his cone away from Penny’s searching bill.
“The Princess Bride.” Harry chooses, immediately. “You’re going to love it, Draco. It’s got everything. Pirates and princesses and swordfights. Complicated wordplay and fantastic costumes. You’ll quote it for the rest of your life.” He pulls the DVD out and sets it on the coffee table. “But first. Popcorn. Come on to the kitchen.”
“You’re actually serious about this…” He breathes, looking like he can hardly believe it. His eyes are wet, and Harry’s heart stutters in his chest.
People are pouring out of Hogwarts, and though he wants to sprint for Harry and never let him go again, everyone else but Ron and Hermione thinks he’s only just now had a change of heart. They don’t know that he’s worthy of Harry's attention in this moment. He watches, heart in his throat as Ron and Hermione reach Harry first, surrounding him in the hug he wants to be the one giving. Green eyes meet his from yards away though, and the look of relief on Harry's face is like the sun breaking over the horizon.
He thinks of Malfoy from back at Hogwarts. How he’d looked in his quidditch gear, wind whipping through his hair. Sending origami crane notes across classrooms to Harry in third year. Taunting Harry from up in a tree when they were fourteen. How even in sixth year when he’d looked tired and terrified there’d still been something interesting about him.
“And then Ron leans over this guy, and tells him that he’s free to go, but we don’t want to see him anywhere near another abandoned warehouse we’re staking out! And that he can find better places to bring his dates if he’s just a little bit more creative!” Draco snorts, which sets Harry off laughing.
Draco looked about the room helplessly, not sure if he’d seen them in the midst of the chaos earlier.
Harry feels the back of his neck heat, and he goes to scratch at his nape. “Poootentiallyyyyy...” He says, drawing out the word as he tries to recall what he’s meant to be doing if not working.
“Of course we can.” Harry took one hand off the handlebars momentarily to take one of Draco’s hands in his own, lifting it to his lips and brushing a kiss across Draco’s cold knuckles.
“I'm not obsessing.” Harry groans, but he turns his attention back to the plate in front of him anyway.
Hermione rushes forward, pressing a chipped coffee mug into his hand. Before he can question what it is he feels the familiar yank of a portkey behind his navel and they’re landing heavily in the lobby of St. Mungos.
“Harry? Are you ready to go to the zoo?” Draco called from the living room, just before he stepped back through the doorway.
“Harry,” Draco breathed in, “this is the best date I’ve ever been on.” He tightened his grip on Harry once more, as though they could possibly get any closer, plastered to Harry’s back as he was.
“I can't say I understand it, Harry. It’s better than assuming he’s up to something all the time, but you have to admit it’s sort of an odd development, don’t you?” She points a piece of naan in his direction.
Draco turned to look at the receding skyline of Boston, growing smaller and smaller as they flew further away.
Draco squinted at that once again. His brain clearly working through how Harry could possibly know that, but not have connected the dots himself. Harry watched the wheels turn behind his eyes, anticipating the moment when Draco would figure him out.
“What if you hadn’t come back?” Draco whispers, voice rough and low from crying. “I didn’t even know you’d gone into the forest. I didn’t get to say goodbye.” He sobs again into Harry’s hair.
“Why’re you calling so late, then?” Harry asks, and immediately feels like it’s the wrong thing to say. “Not that I'm unhappy to see you! I just. Figured you’d be in bed by now.” Smooth yes, great recovery Harry.
“It’s beautiful…” Draco breathed, tightening his grip on Harry and pressing a kiss to his shoulder, hoping he would feel it through the leather.
He prepares the tea the rest of the way, sweetening Draco’s with a spoonful of sugar, and his own an overgenerous drizzle of honey Luna gifted him on her last trip home. When he hands Draco his mug, he’s smiling back at Harry like he’s caught him out in some secret.
Harry stares at his best friend like he’s grown a second head, perhaps one belonging to a thestral at that. “Er… What?” He manages.
!” A very tipsy, very bubbly witch with dark hair says to him, stating the glaringly obvious while leaning much too far into his space.
Harry groans and drops his head to the table once again, straightening just in time for Malfoy to give him a weird look as he rejoins them.
“Oh Godric, do I want to know?” Harry smirks at Draco’s back, and smooths his face into calm innocence the second he turns around.
So Harry settles in next to the fireplace, and talks about untangling threads of magic, and Hermione’s wild hippogriff chase to find out where anyone else learned to cast a
“What?! Of course not! Are we forgetting the part where I nearly killed him in sixth year?” Harry sputters, and then wishes he hadn’t brought it up as all the air is sucked out of his chest.
“The most common combination I saw was with grape jelly! But do you know what flavor of ice cream I couldn’t find? Even from Benjamin and Gerald?”
“OH! No you do not.” Draco shakes his head, leaning over the table and into Harry’s space. “I know for a fact you forget to do magic. All. The. Time. Ron complains about it every time you wash dishes by hand when you go over to theirs.”
Harry looks up from the table in his lab with a crow of joy. The snarl of magic that formerly was the modified
“I stared at you across the Great Hall for six years. I could probably make your favorite breakfast without even thinking about it.” Harry says offhandedly, and then it’s his turn to blush.
“Let me call the Healer to get you something for the pain.” He goes to pull his wand, but Draco clings to his wrist pressing Harry’s palm to his cheek.
Harry laughs. “It’s a muggle saying, like… er. I don’t know if there’s a wix equivalent actually. It just means let’s get out of here.”
- augmented with some complicated biomagical component that decimates the clotting ability of blood. Anyone hit with it needs to seek near immediate medical attention or risk bleeding out within a few hours regardless of the size of the cut. That alone would be bad enough, but on top of it there’s a tricky suppressant element that makes it resistant to magimedical intervention. He’s shuddering to think of Ron or Susan Bones or even Malfoy being hit with it, when there’s a tap on the all glass door.
Harry laughed once again, and pulled Draco back down into another kiss, tightening his hold on Draco’s hips.
“Don’t be dense Harry, it’s not attractive.” Ron replies with an eye roll. “I am very clearly talking about D-r-a-c-o.”
They workshop the name until Draco thinks he might pull his hair out. Harry is never, ever naming their children — if they get that far.
“Ah. Nothing, nothing. I shouldn't have said that. D’you hear that? I think Hermione's calling me.” He stares at a point somewhere to the left of Harry's head, refusing to meet his eye.
Conversation resumes, but Harry's pretty checked out of it. At one point Malfoy heads to the loo, and Harry kicks Ron under the table.
On his side of the booth Malf — Draco — is pressed against him from hip to knee, his head on Harry's shoulder, just like he predicted.
“Here’s the list.” Hermione pulls a piece of parchment out of a pocket in her robes, and hands it off to Ron.
“He really calls me Harry when he talks to you?” He asks, hoping against hope Hermione won’t notice. Of course, she’s the one who answers him.
“Harry. Harry, don’t.” Draco says, sounding a little choked up himself. “I never would have taken your help back then. And I tried to
Harry pulls his head out of the floo and a moment later steps into Draco’s flat. Draco leads him to the kitchen and pulls out two mismatched mugs.
“Draco! Sorry to call so late but we’re needed! Robards has a lead and it’s time sensitive. Get your arse into the office!”
“How does this relate to Draco?” And there it is, she knows. “Don’t be thick, Harry. I know you’re actually very bright.” She smirks at him.
“You mean to tell me you know about the first use of muggle anesthetics but you don’t know about the American War of Independence?”
“Draco is fond of Ben and Jerry’s, but he won’t admit it. Claims there’s too much extra stuff in their ice cream. But I’ve seen the empty cartons of Phish Food in the bin.”
. Harry had been distinctly cagey about the plan. He’d told Draco to dress warmly, but comfortably. Nothing fancy that he would be upset if it got ruined. That had not been reassuring. He’d refused to cave when Draco had pressed for further details, even when Draco had nibbled his ear and licked down the side of his neck, and done that
now lies untangled and harmless in front of him. The strands of magic separated and accounted for, he taps the surface a few times and sends his report to supervisor Howitzer. Hermione is standing outside his door and he takes down the wards and lets her in.
Harry started gently scratching Draco’s scalp, still working to hold back laughter as Draco burrowed further against him.
“Okay. Clearly the subtle approach is not working. Do you need a list?” Her evident frustration is tempered with fondness and amusement, and Harry can’t bring himself to get too annoyed with the situation. He nods, slowly.
Everything about Florian was happy. Harry had increasingly fond memories of being thirteen, sitting outside Fortescue’s to do his summer homework, and tasting the different flavors Florian was trying in the shop. History of Magic had never been quite so fun as it was that summer. He still made an effort to stop in at least once a month to see what creation Florian had in the freezer for him.
“You didn’t tell me you’d made that much progress.” He protests, setting his menu down to look at her across the formica table.
Before he can consider what he’s doing, Harry’s talking. “Would you like to come to mine, tomorrow, after lunch at The Burrow, and we could watch one?” He finishes his tea to cover his burning face. When he looks up again, Draco is smiling.
“Er, no? She’s a platypus,” he scooped Penny down from her perch to hold her out to the witch. “Her name is Penny. You can pet her if you like?”
Harry frowns, but picks up his own menu and considers what it is he wants to eat. Draco is a solid distraction next to him, warm and inviting. He presses his knee slightly harder against Draco’s and thrills slightly when he receives a response in turn.
“I didn't have time to find you,” Harry chokes out. “I thought of you the whole time I was in the forest. I thought of you when Dumbledore told me I could go on, if I wanted.”
“Hurry up and catch me!” He ran forward racing towards the breaking surf, hearing Harry chasing after him.
“No. No I don’t.” Harry replies quickly, turning to Draco and trying to shake his head as minutely as possible.
“No! Ah. I. No, nothing's wrong.” Draco replies, looking flustered and a little flushed even in the green light of floo fire.
They go to a new Greek place that opened a few days ago on Diagon. It’s small, with a counter, tables and chairs all packed into a square footage that appears too crowded, but cozy nonetheless. If Harry looks closely he can see magic woven into the seats to ensure they fit together closely while not actually squashing patrons.
“I lied a little.” She says breathlessly, once they’re seated and looking over pages of Greek delicacies. “I also want to talk to you about the potions ring case. I think I have a lead on where they may have learned the
Turning off the intercom, Harry pins down several threads of magic he’s managed to tease out from the larger knot with some precise charm work. He then contains the whole thing in a three layer stasis spell he modified himself last year for just these types of situations. Leaving volatile magic like this uncontained can be dangerous, even in the warded labs. He lets said wards down and exits the room to join the others, bringing them back up with a tap of his wand to the door. The stasis will hold until he’s back on Monday, but just in case it doesn’t… better safe than sorry.
,” she screeched in delight, making Draco look around desperately at the possibility of somebody lurking around and overhearing her words, all while waving his hands to try and shut Myrtle up. “How sometimes you couldn’t sleep, thinking over all the ‘what if’s’.
The man in the portrait resembled Dumbledore in so many ways that Harry felt his heart ache with longing.
I’ve secretly listened to on the WWN.” That made Blaise snort. “Things would be much simpler if you two shagged already.”
Draco Vanished that flower. He looked to the side, just to check if he was seen, and blanched at Granger’s very knowing smile.
“He’s too pure, too good to have such a fate,” Harry said, his voice breaking with emotion. He thanked Merlin that he was alone.
“Morning, Draco!” Pansy chirped the next morning, sitting beside him at the Great Hall table and leaning in to peck his cheek. “Love the skeleton look you are sporting today!”
Right before they started to practice the spells for Professor Kowalski to see what they had learned, Potter put the flower behind
Years later, as an eleven-year-old, he’d associated the foggy memory to Lucius being sad from Grand-père Dominus’ passing, but nothing more. It was then that Abraxas explained to Draco what had actually happened. Abraxas told him about the Curse, and how despite fighting bravely to survive to his 83 years – a rarity – Dominus Malfoy had been found with black cyclamens sprouting from his heart and thick thorns crushing his body. It was the first time Draco had cried himself to sleep, thinking about the Curse.
A long sigh. A snort. Then, Terry Boot cursed a blue streak after getting caught. Finnegan peeked from behind his red curtains.
Pansy was left almost penniless after that. The Fairview, Parkinson’s family mansion, had been locked down by the Ministry of Magic and their Gringotts vaults had been mostly frozen. Pansy, like most purebloods, – Blaise, Theo, and Draco included – now had to ask the Ministry’s permission to access their vaults, whatever amount it might be.
It came out so harsh that even Blaise flinched away from him, before composing himself and censuring Pansy with a nasty look. “Now you’ve done it. He was quiet and pliant before you stormed in. You happy, now?”
“Morning…” he couldn’t help but mumble back a response, blushing. He could already feel a tiny flower sprouting somewhere.
have had to kill? A flash of green caught his attention, and he focussed on the Slytherins that were waiting outside Slughorn’s room. How many of them lost their parents?
, Potter?” Malfoy drawled again, shrinking into himself as if he was trying to blend into the wall somehow.
, Draco thought teasingly while suppressing a laugh. Potter, however, did not. He snickered behind Longbottom’s and Theo’s backs while they placed themselves at the other side of the room. When Draco looked at Potter to respond, he became quite distracted by Potter biting his lower lip to muffle his laugh.
“I don’t even think that all would be better if You-Know-Who had won the Second Wizarding War,” the brunette pointed out, laughing humourlessly. “There would be Muggle-borns and half-bloods in our cellars, and they’d be screaming their heads off 24/7,” Theo emphasised. “After they brought some Hufflepuffs to torture in our cellar for information on Dean Thomas’ whereabouts, I couldn’t see them like
Draco snorted but did not answer. He was still debating if he’d quit those extra activities as well. A comfortable silence fell between them, despite Draco’s lack of response. Draco kept playing with Theo’s piercings and rings on his left ear while he stared into the distance. Theo had put them on this morning, just to see if some style would diverge the attention from his overall pale, too-thin, sleep-deprived appearance.
Certainly would be interesting. He remembered how Potter’s voice came out soft when he spoke that language –
Pansy kept a hand close to Draco’s elbow, and Blaise, an arm slung over Draco’s shoulders. That’s why Draco loved them. The quiet, trusting companionship they displayed by touches or gestures.
… He held those memories of the tale closely to the haunted memories around his Horcrux hunt. They weren’t very pleasant ones, especially because Harry had one Hallow in his hand before he had surrendered himself to Voldemort.
The Cloak could be passed on without repercussions. Harry agreed, as there was no record nor suspicions about his family members dying
. Papa laid down and remained silent for weeks after that; listening in shock to the Aurors reading those books, page by page, every single day. Merlin…”
, at the same time. After going through so much, the dull routine left him feeling restless, like he was losing time by not focussing on what was happening around him, or missing opportunities by not being aware of people’s struggles. Harry felt like an arsehole for not paying attention to other people’s lives, too. Was he trying to compensate by thinking, analysing, and feeling everything
“You should shower,” Potter murmured, finally breaking the silence in the room. They stood like that for so long that the sun was already high in the sky, although emitting quite a pale light. “I can practically see all your veins and your lips are already blue.”
His voice seemed deeper with the thick English accent, while his Portuguese voice sounded way softer.
“Not toworry! These are just books, my lad,” Merlin smiled kindly at him, and that only made him miss Dumbledore even more. “Password?”
Draco thought, but ended up just rolling his eyes in a ‘don’t be silly’ manner since all words seemed stuck in his throat.
Harry decides the bad blood between him and Malfoy needs to end. Draco doesn't know how to react with Harry's attention. Meanwhile, the first and second-years struggle and need some help.
Harry stopped reading. He immediately became aware he was breathing heavily. Then, he noticed he was also sweating.
The next thing he saw was Potter standing in front of him, hands held high in the air. Potter seemed to be counting something, as he lowered one finger, waited, then lowered another. Draco looked at Potter’s chest and saw him breathing in slowly. He mimicked and found his own lungs filling with cold, fresh air. Potter had magically opened the windows, allowing the morning air to enter the room.
The square glowed briefly, and much like Riddle's diary; red letters began to appear on the bottom of the square.
“He was.” Draco croaked a short answer to both questions, blinking slowly. “It was a tough blow to him when my papa got imprisoned.
“No! No. of course! Do you want to come through? Or…?” Harry trails off, scratching the back of his neck.
Harry says it like it’s just something that happened. Like he hasn’t processed it. He probably hasn't.
“My facts are hardly terrifying, Potter.” Is all he says, but his smile and the way he squeezes Harry's hand tell him everything else.
“You mean to tell me….” She says slowly, “that the entire time you and Draco were fighting in school, you were also thinking about snogging him senseless.” She looks calmer than Harry thinks she should given the circumstances. In fact she looks a little like she wants to burst out laughing.
He manages to start stroking Harry's hair again, only just resisting the urge to clutch Harry closer in horror.
“Should we bring her back to the zoo tonight then?” he asked as he brushed a lock of Draco’s hair back behind his ear.
Draco leaned in, pressing kisses to Harry’s cheeks, his nose, anywhere he could reach on his boyfriend’s face.
The sun was starting to dip towards the horizon when he apparated the two of them home, entering to the smell of coconut milk and curry, and he found Draco in the kitchen, unboxing their favorite Thai takeaway.
Draco frowned. “Fine. But when you can’t bear to leave her at the zoo because you’ve gotten attached, you have to do the dishes for a week.”
Harry started the bike with a roar, and Draco tightened his grip. Harry set them into motion, and soon they were smoothly rising above the road, the noise of the bike quieting only slightly as they lifted into the sky. The sun burned the horizon gold and orange and pink; Draco stared out over the Boston Harbor towards the Atlantic, watching the waves roll in and grow smaller and smaller as they climbed. Eventually, Harry banked to the left, and sent them soaring into the city.
“What movie do you want to watch?” He asks, instead of running a gentle hand down Draco’s back. Despite what he thinks has been flirting lately, that seems awfully forward.
“Potter,” he whispers, “I don't think I can take much more of it watching them be so sickeningly sweet. Take me home, will you?”
Despite Hermione’s claim that they already had their pub night for the week, Ron drags her to their usual booth at the Silver Newt on Friday night with minimal arm twisting. She does extract a promise to go back to the Drowsy Kelpie next week, as well as an agreement that they’ll do dinners like Wednesday’s more often, however.
Draco grimaced. Harry knew how much he hated the karaoke night with the four of them since he’d been banned from singing Britney Spears after a frankly horrifying rendition of
Molly Weasley is giving him a strange look, like she can see something in him no one else can, when Harry finally walks in. He locks eyes with Draco, and immediately walks back out of the hall, having spoken to absolutely no one. Draco follows without a backwards glance at Molly's knowing smile.
When he does show up, it’s looking very casual in soft jeans and a green jumper Harry recognizes as Molly Weasley’s work. He’s not sure how he’s never noticed that Draco owns a Weasley jumper before. He considers that it might be due to the fact that he’s rarely seen Draco outside of his professional element, excepting the last couple of weeks. He looks cozy this way, soft. Harry wants to touch.
Draco stepped to where Harry was, reaching for his hand and the pencil at the same time. As he touched it, it slowly began to heat and vibrate, and Draco felt the familiar yanking sensation behind his navel, before they were spinning through space and time, landing with a thump in a car park Draco didn’t recognize.
results in the transfer of approximately 1 billion bacteria from one mouth to another. along with that is 0.7 milligrams of protein, 0.45 milligrams of salt, 0.7 micrograms of fat, and 0.2 micrograms of ‘miscellaneous organic compounds’.“
“Dracoooooo,” Harry whined. He wriggled his hips slightly and gave his husband his absolute best puppy dog eyes.
Harry smirked at that, before flipping the two of them — careful to turn away from the platypus — ending pressed on top of Draco from hips to chest.  Draco gasped, and Harry took the opportunity to kiss him hard, licking into his mouth and squeezing his wrists tighter. That is, until he felt the strange sensation of small webbed feet on his side. In the tussle, he had failed to check where the platypus was.
Penny shuffled on his chest and he reached out to rest a steadying hand on her back. He could smell frying eggs and bacon wafting from the kitchen, and Draco had started their pour over coffee, despite the fact that neither of them particularly enjoyed drinking it.
They clean out Grimmauld Place. Draco takes a chunk of the wall out to remove Walburga and Harry spends weeks learning construction charms to rebuild it. They live with the hole in the meantime. Walburga screams when they burn her portrait during a bonfire with everyone they love present. They turn up the wireless to drown her out. They tear out wallpaper and cover themselves in as much paint as the walls. They polish the floors and dust the ceilings. Slowly but surely the house goes from a tomb, a wartime safe house, a hideout, to a shelter, a gathering place, a home.
Florian disappeared into the back before returning with a pink and white striped cup of vanilla ice cream. He put it on the counter in front of Penny, and the two of them watched as she shoved her bill into the cup and snarfed down the treat.
Harry's floo starts chiming around midnight on Saturday. He's pleasantly surprised, but more than slightly confused when Draco's face pops up in the flames.
Draco leaned forward and kissed the tip of Harry’s nose, before breaking out of his hold and sprinting down the beach.
“Everyone only watches to see you and Granger and Weasley - I’m just there. You could replace me with anyone else and it wouldn’t make a difference. In fact, you’d be better off for it.”
Harry pulled up higher as it continued to get dark, and they sped towards the Harbor, flying over the Paul Revere House.
They started in the Boston Public Garden, dipping low over the lagoon, swooping around a gazebo, brushing the tops of the trees. The sun reflected off the water, turning it a molten gold, and Harry whooped as the wheels of the bike brushed through the surface, throwing up spray as they passed the vacant swan boats. Skating under the bridge, they looped around Mallard Island, the foliage of the trees almost appearing ablaze with sunlight.
Right as Harry is plucking up his courage to lean across the couch into Draco's space and maybe kiss him, Draco's wand starts vibrating with an Emergency Auror Summons. Ron’s terrier patronus appears in front of them.
“I wouldn’t miss it.” Harry replies. “Come on, up you get.” He murmurs to Malfoy, gently pressing him out of the booth and towards the door. He doesn’t let himself think about how he wishes they were leaving together in a different context.
. She had his defense book from the same year, and in the back were detailed instructions on how to cast, and what the spell did, as well as how he developed it! The book was in the library during our fifth and sixth years. I managed to get a record of who checked it out from Madam Pince. There were only six names on it.” She finishes breathlessly.
Harry tried to hold in a laugh, not wanting to cut off Florian and have to explain that most people, muggle or wix, tended to enjoy peanut butter.
“Where’s Draco? We need the guitar for this set.” Potter wrinkled his nose petulantly, long fingers plucking at the strings on his bass. “He’s never late like this.”
wild animal. They did have that thestral that had taken to Draco in the backyard, and there was a spot for Buckbeak when he sometimes showed up to visit Harry, and there was the family of nifflers living under the porch that neither of them had the heart to get rid of, even if they sometimes had to summon jewelry from the front yard. But those were magical animals that had mostly arrived by themselves! Not a zoo animal that was used to a standard of care Harry was certain the two of them could not provide.
“Well I’ve got no clue if platypuses are anything like crups, but she certainly seems happy. Thanks a bunch, Florian!”
“It’s… it’s a long story. I promise I'll tell it to you. Okay? Just… not right now. Please, please stop crying Draco, I promise I’m alright.” He pulls Draco impossibly closer, fists his hands in the back of Draco’s shirt.
“That it was finally time to admit I wasn't your secret valentine-sending admirer in your second year at Hogwarts.” She looks at him pointedly.
“Do you have a favorite in your collection?” Draco replies. “I’m not all too familiar with the muggle cinema.”
They end up tucked into an alcove at the top of the grand staircase. Harry is covered in dirt and soot and curse debris. His face is a mess of bruises and blood and dust from the rubble. He's a disaster. He's beautiful. He's alive. Draco's still bleeding sluggishly from a gash above his left eye. He's covered in grit and grime, his hair is singed, and he knows his face is pale and drawn from exhaustion. They lean into each other, arms around waists, around shoulders. Harry's face pressed to his chest.
“I have a platypus because I wanted a platypus. That’s why.” He squeezed the platypus slightly, as though worried Harry would try to take it from him.
“Go on then, what fact are you going to disturb me with this week?” Draco hands Harry a mug, and Harry fights off a blush when their fingertips touch.
Slowly, so as not to upset the platypus Harry shifted towards the side of the bed, dropping his legs over the side, and reaching up to cradle Penny in one arm. He stretched the other arm over his head, and headed towards the en suite bathroom to at least attempt to tame his bedhead. Slightly blurry bottle green eyes stared back at him, and he shuffled back to the night table to find his glasses, grimacing as the bags under his eyes and the mess on top of his head came into focus. He ran the hand unoccupied by Penny through his hair, which just had the effect of making it more of a mess. Penny blinked up at him and made the purring noise again, and he couldn’t help but run a gentle finger over her bill before scooping her onto his shoulder like a small, velvet lined sack of potatoes.
“It will be nice to spend some time with one another outside of work that doesn’t involve getting absolutely plastered, you know.” She says, when the boys all roll their eyes.
Harry laughed the whole way out into the Harbor, where they once again dipped low, brushing the surface with the tires, kicking up spray. Harry turned in lazy arcs, banking right and lifting them higher. Draco turned his head and looked towards the Boston skyline, gasping as it came alive in the darkness. Lights seemed to blink on one by one until the whole city was glowing before them, the Harbor lapping at the shore and the idling bike the only sounds audible for a long moment.
“Of course Hermione,” Malfoy says easily, “it’s not at all because you want to use me to get through the crowds and carry drinks.”
“I don’t want to ruin your evening. Please go spend the rest of it with Ron and Hermione. I’ll see you again soon.” Before Harry can reply, Draco is slipping away from him and out of the bar.
When it comes right down to it it’s an easy choice. Voldemort is gloating, Harry's body is limp in Hagrid's arms, and neither love nor money will convince Draco to cross that courtyard and join the man who killed his boyfriend.
“You have a platypus,” Harry said eventually, feeling as though his morning had taken a decidedly strange turn.
“Alright then. After dinner.” Harry reached up and ran a finger down Penny’s back, grinning at Draco as she wiggled in place and made a chattering sound at his touch.
Harry works to develop a menu. They throw tasting parties and Draco pairs wine with each course Harry makes, their friends getting tipsy and loud around their dining room table. Eventually Harry settles on a French and Indian fusion that confuses and delights everyone in equal measure.
Harry tried to keep his face from falling. He knew they didn’t have what it would take to care for Penny. He didn’t know the first thing about platypus care, and she definitely couldn’t exist on a diet of scrambled eggs and ice cream from Fortescue’s. Draco had known what he was doing though, and Harry was starting to get attached.
“Oh no,” Harry laughed, “this is all Draco’s doing. I’m just taking her out for the day. Her name is Penny.”
“Harry… you were dead.” It’s saying his name that finally snaps Draco. He can feel the tears running down his face, and he presses himself as close to Harry as he can, burying his face in his hair. He smells of burning smoke, and the floor of the forest, and the ozone of too much magic, but under it all there’s the vaguely almondy scent that’s Harry’s shampoo, and Draco lets himself cry for the fear of losing this. For the fact that he did lose this, for a little while, but that he got it back. That he has it back and he’s never letting it go.
“Forget about us did you, Potter?”” Malfoy drawls, posh and infuriating and altogether too appealing for Harry's comfort, even inside the privacy of his own head.
He pressed himself closer to Harry, angling his head to deepen the kiss, parting his lips and gasping when Harry licked into his mouth. He sucked Harry’s lower lip between his own, biting gently and soothing with his tongue when Harry moaned under him. He tried to pour all the love and adoration, and gratitude he felt for this ridiculous man into the kiss. Eventually they pulled apart and Harry’s eyes were blown wide, his mouth pink and soft.
“Would you like to come and have a drink with us? My friend’s getting married tomorrow and she’s just a
He didn’t ask about the band. He didn’t ask about the group. Potter asked about himself. Draco leaned back, away from the other boy.
“She is very likeable.” Draco paused, searching Harry’s face. “I was thinking though, while you were out. You’re probably right. I don’t think we’re equipped to take care of her.”
He nodded, handing the necklace to Harry and shivering slightly as Harry brushed his hair off his neck, fastening the clasp and pressing a kiss to the top knob of his spine, running gentle fingers down his back.
“Alright, alright. You win. Yes, sometimes I confuse cold for being wet. Where in the name of Merlin are you finding these facts anyway?” Harry longs to lean forward and tap Draco on the nose, but he controls himself.
“Well there’s no need to be rude about it. She’s not done anything to you,” Harry snapped, pulling Penny back against his chest.
They dipped low once more, flying past the Boston Symphony hall, the warm glow from the plate glass windows painting Harry bronze. They swept from the Hall to the skywalk, lifting higher and higher until the whole city appeared to sprawl below them, the darkness above making it appear that the stars had all fallen to earth.
He settled Draco’s palm back against his chest and revved the bike, taking off again, but at a slightly more sedate pace. They lifted incrementally higher above the waves, until Draco felt as though they were flying amongst the stars instead of beneath them. The darkness below seemed infinite, even as the moon lit the water, turning the whitecaps silvery, and making the spray glitter in the air.
“Are we leaving London?” Draco twisted in Harry’s arms to look at him head on, trying hard not to pout.
“Ironic how that one worked out then, isn’t it.” Hermione does laugh this time, gesturing to the photo of all of them from last New Years, Ginny and Pansy laughing with their arms around one another off to the side.
There's a dead body lying in the courtyard, but it’s not his boyfriend and really that’s a small miracle right there.
He thinks about Draco post-Hogwarts. Growing out his hair through Auror training until one day it reminded him too much of Lucius and he’d chopped it all off. Painting his nails on the weekends. Getting a muggle tattoo to make his Mark his own, and several magical ones across his shoulders and down his sides.
Harry tumbled out of the windowsill gracelessly, dragging Draco behind him towards the practice room, laughing the whole way.
“It was too late by then anyway.” He laughs a little painfully. “I think at that point we were both set on the paths we took - he had to do what he did or Voldemort would kill him, I had to do what I was doing or Voldemort would kill us all. Not exactly a romantic set up.” He sighs. “I still wish I'd been better in that bathroom though. Things might be different now.”
“Your body,” Draco starts dramatically, “has no receptors for wetness. You rely on temperature cues to tell if something is wet or not.” He throws his arms wide, nearly sloshing tea over the rim of the mug.
“We’re about halfway there. But I thought you might want to see without all the movement from the bike.”
Harry released him and kicked a leg over the seat of the bike, turning to look back as Draco settled behind him, bracketing his thighs around Harry’s hips and winding his arms around Harry’s chest. He grinned when Harry reached back behind him, gripping Draco’s arse to pull him tighter to Harry.
“Yes. well… it’s not my fault you both went the Unspeakable route rather than becoming Aurors like we planned.” He grumbles.
It was eerie to be there at night, and though Harry had been many places he wasn’t supposed to be over the course of his life, there was something particularly strange about walking through the broad sidewalks and past the sleeping animals in their enclosures.
“You were dead.” He cries again, and Harry keeps whispering promises against Draco’s chest, rocking him gently back and forth while he sobs.
“Careful Harry, or I’m going to think you’re coming onto me.” Draco smirks, winking as he takes a sip of his tea.
“People were good today. I got a few weird looks, but practically no one approached me. Florian liked her.”
They leave soon after, Harry supporting Draco back to his flat like it’s any other pub night. This time however, he’s got to remind himself that his feet are on the ground, not on thin air.
“Good for me,” he said good-humouredly. “That way I can receive much profound and life-changing advice on how to deal with my crappy life!”
Saturday was warmer than the previous day, but not by much. Occasionally a chilling breeze would pass them. “Isn’t it perfect?” Theo said contentedly about the weather. He had his head propped on Draco’s thighs. Of course, the blond took that as an invitation to play with his friend’s straight hair as he pleased.
“So, you want to pair up?” Those lips spoke in a gentle rhythm. “I think it’s better than you being with someone else and risking getting hexed.”
Draco felt his heart hammering against his ribs; guilt squeezed his heart – and it seemed he wasn’t the only one shook by that idea –, but he decided on a scorning approach. “You can’t be serious… You’re actually pulling the ‘this is your fault’ card on us, Bee?”
Both nights, Draco snuck up in Blaise’s bed. Theo laid against the bedpost on Blaise’s bed but ended up passing out from exhaustion. Blaise had remained awake with Draco for as long as he could, but as always the blond alone remained sleepless. At least the company helped him relax.
, mate! I thought I was keeping it quiet,” Boot groaned. “And it never crossed my mind that I had an audience listening to me wank.”
It was a relief to have no Dementors in the prison anymore. Aurors patrolled the facility, instead. Draco had shackles that bound a person’s core with an ancient and powerful Magical Annulment Enchantment. Any magic in Draco’s blood had vanished, leaving him feeling disoriented and weak. As it was as ancient as Draco’s own Curse, the enchantment had dulled the Benedictus effects, but not cancelled them completely. During those months, he had never seen a twitch on his otherwise magical tattoo. It seemed like a regular Muggle one, which had surprisingly bothered him. Lucius and Narcissa had been imprisoned side by side in the two cells that faced Draco’s. The cell on Draco’s right was Alcyone’s. That Annulment came as a twisted blessing since it slowed Draco’s and Lucius’ Curses. It had allowed Lucius to heal and recover from months of torture at the hands of the Dark Lord along with the debilitating effects of the Benedictus.
uncountable people, guarded magical dark artefacts and much more. While Petra was the witch in the field, Atreus stayed in the shadows, wearing his Death Eater silver mask to not be recognised.
The stench of death rose from the withered asphodel petals that sprouted from his tattooed skin and fell down his body, out of his pyjamas and ended up on the floor. He flushed the toilet while tears began running down his pale cheeks.
If Draco was being honest with himself, there was someone else who had made him unsettled by all that Muggle-born hate before Granger’s torture under his own roof. She was the one responsible for Draco stopping his use of the word ‘mudblood’.
“To break those enchantments or to perform their counterspell correctly, one has to know how to cast it first. With that said, all of you must gather in pairs and practice what I taught you, class!” Professor Kowalski commanded a while later, but just as the students started to rearrange the tables and chairs to clear the centre of the classroom, she warned: “Do not harm each other. This is not a Duelling class! If I see any of you engaging in serious combat, I’ll take a hundred points from each house.”
Harry hadn't registered the thorns before, but upon closer look he noticed them crawling out from beneath Malfoy’s clothes a moment later. Right. The thorns were a clear sign that Malfoy was feeling really threatened. Before, Malfoy had always been an attention seeker. Now, Harry wondered if Malfoy felt threatened by the attention.
“I can’t look at them like that anymore, and frankly... That frightens me more than the nightmares or the backlash.” Draco had felt the same, after seeing Granger, Weasley, and Potter in the Manor’s dungeon. “That insufferable know-it-all had driven me up the wall for so many years, but when I saw Aunt Bella torturing her…” he gulped. “Couldn’t detach her from the girl I saw in the corridors…”
Hermione glanced his way, looking as worried as Ron. Before she could say anything, Harry added “I am fine, and I don’t want to talk about anything.”
“I’m sorry, Pans. I didn’t mean to snap. Just tired, that’s all. Not in the mood to banter today,” he dropped his forehead on his hands with as much dignity as possible.
,” Hermione accused. With a flick of her wand, the wood ladders magically moved. It slid to where Hermione was, and she came down to the corridor where Harry was.
Draco had shed countless asphodels after his nightmare about Crabbe. It was a very vivid one, as if Draco were again in the Room of Requirement. The Fiendfyre was licking and destroying everything, and he could feel the scorching heat of the flames that almost took his life. In the dream, Draco saw every little bit of what happened to Crabbe as he died. The skin searing, then combusting. It started to melt off his bones, then the flames took his organs and-
By the time Draco exited the shower stall, he found Blaise and Theo were sitting on the floor, their backs propped against the opposite wall, close to the sinks.
“A ‘yes’?” Draco kept staring at him, completely clueless. “About pairing up to do the lesson,” Potter clarified, looking bemusedly at Draco.
Right now, though, it was safe. Harry was reading Lungwort’s discourse about how she thought the Death from
Draco was terrified of living and dealing with the aftermath of his choices, though. That’s why, after Dumbledore, he only had marigold leaves and stems covering his body. The live buds that progressively withered and, after falling from his skin, emitted a stench of decay.
Pansy sat upright and looked back at him, but Blaise lowered his eyes. However, Theo opened his almond-shaped eyes and looked up to Draco sympathetically. They all had their attention on Draco, but the blond did not move his eyes from the faraway mountains. He opened and closed his mouth several times, at a loss for words; his eyes filled with unshed tears.
had been his turning point on Muggle-borns. She reminds him of Granger, and of what Granger’s destiny would’ve been if she had indeed “been the next” on the Heir of Slytherin’s killing list. Myrtle had helped him when he was at his lowest, and had listened to his fears and insecurities even though he had been a bully in the past. Draco’s actions had surely reminded Myrtle of her own tormentors. She also knew Draco was trying to accomplish a mission delivered by the person responsible for her death. All those things would’ve been enough for Myrtle to hate and ignore him; instead, she had been
