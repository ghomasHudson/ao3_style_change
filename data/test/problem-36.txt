Draco finally holds Harry’s face in place to get a mouthful of the kiss he’s been wanting all morning.
just because we were late to the party. This was all your fault, though. I was the one tied up and did not have a way of even knowing what time it was. What would have happened if it had been Ginevra or Granger? I’m positive you would like to avoid even thinking of the possibilities as well.
“I was trying to cook for you. Your favourite; spaghetti and mushroom soup. But I put a little extra salt in it by mistake and…and…got so scared. I’m sorry for the mess. I was afraid you’d use the hot pan on me, so I poured water and spilt everything. I’m so sorry, please don’t make me sleep in the cupboard.
“As a result, you wake up to the most wonderful kisses in the world, if I say so myself,” Draco retorts, mischievous smirk in place.
Those were his last thoughts before he lost consciousness while clutching his burning forearm.
At this point, Draco had to break into a run, lest he change his mind.
“Oh yeah, good one babe!” Ginny exclaimed. Then proceeded to snog Luna again who was only too happy to comply.
- you have a new world to turn to. But I was damned in the muggle world, and I was damned by the Wizarding world as well. Where do I go?
start feeling uncomfortable
What can I say? It was easier, to run. To hide, to flee, to never look back. Much easier than facing all of the shit that the war left behind.
“Mmmh.”
, you once said.
Draco
You be careful - "that witch" is my friend (but you're right, she's NEVER been able to hold her liquor). Hermione has said (multiple times) that "you Gryffindors" (like she isn't one herself) are, and I quote, "braver than is healthy when it comes to over-indulgence". Usually she says it very, very loud, too early in the morning, while opening all the curtains. She's not super sympathetic. Incidentally, she was also up at some ungodly hour the morning after, clanging around in the kitchen. Before you ask, I was on the couch, alone. I expect you saw that fucking article in Witch Weekly? The one that suggested the three of us were "unnaturally close". I'm
With a pang of sadness, he looks in Harry's direction again. Involuntarily, his brain supplies him with a familiar tune. A tune so intimate, that even now, hearing it makes Draco's stomach twist with pain and longing.
It feels as if his lungs have been punched. He stops breathing, his entire body frozen in place as his mind decides that the middle of the Potions classroom, at 9 in the morning would be an excellent place to replay some of his most vivid memories.
I wasn't supposed to get angry and point fingers at you but FUCK.
My front door has thrown a fit over a bit of wet mail and it won't open to anyone but Hermione. Use the side gate and come in through the garden and in my backdoor. Kitchen is on the left. See you tomorrow.
Draco starts humming,
And I know what you’ll say, Harry. God, I know you so well. I know you’ll help me, be willing to spend the rest of your life with me and I can’t have that. Because you are a hero, Harry. You are the Chosen One. You deserve so much better than me. You deserve the world.
It took Draco a few seconds to locate his voice, and what came out was scratchy at best. So, he tried again. “You’ve been spying this whole time?”
- DM.
Draco thought even as he returned a polite smile. The best he could do when almost shoved into Potter’s personal space. His increasing heartbeat and haywire thoughts weren’t helping.
Draco,
It was always you. Always, since we were young.
You always made me do stupid things, made me think I could fly even though I was chained down. That was the part I always loved about you, the thought that you had hope in this screwed up world.
Don't be alarmed by the bees, they're in a mood cos of the rain. Just ignore them, and don't wear blue (they're attracted to blue). See you tonight.
to reply. Until then it will be your fleeting memories and broken promises keeping me company.
Now, don’t be afraid, Draco. Not for me. And especially not of me. This is a fault of your own making. You simultaneously bring out the best and worst in me. And have always been the only one to do so.
"Draco, Draco, Draco. At long last, the time has come for you to be bestowed with the highest honour you shall ever receive in your life. The Dark Mark," the Dark Lord announced.
Ginevra's call for attention - and when the hell did Luna slip away from them? - did not allow Draco an opportunity to overthink, and eventually freak out over the possibility that Potter might be flirting with him. Draco Malfoy's lifelong fascination, long-standing crush
“Did you expect anything less than?” Draco retorted, internally wincing at his arrogance. Old instincts die hard, he supposed.
He all but ran outside, Apparating immediately when he could. Where he landed was not how Harry had imagined the place to be like at all. Nevertheless, he was going to look for the blond dumbass and get him out safely. No sooner had he thought that he found himself unable to move. The sound and light of Petrificus Totalus registered later. He could disarm whoever it was wandlessly, once he saw them.
Three days and seventeen hours later, they were no closer to a solution than they had been at the start. Draco’s hopes of solving this to have a minuscule chance at actually being selected were diminishing by the hour. The first day had gone well enough. Both had understood what had happened during the crimes and they had even managed to pinpoint the motive behind the robberies - gaining enough wealth to enter the pure-blood society. But this wasn't enough to catch the perpetrator. They had to figure out how it had been committed.
because I saw a stubborn, brave, blond git fighting with all his might to set things right. I saw you give up everything in the blasted war and vowed to make sure that your sacrifices weren’t in vain. The rest is history.
Because you know me, Harry. I would burn down the world just because you weren’t there with me. So I’m not sure if that was a smart choice, pardoning me, letting me back into your world.
You ask about scars as if you did not spend every waking moment mapping mine out. Asking me to regale the stories, over and over, in the hopes of making me immune to the pain. We were each other’s lifeline, Draco. Hope, even. Did you turn your back on that too? When you turned your back on me?
Freedom. The word is strange. I don’t think I’ve ever been free, not really. There was always my Father, or Voldemort, always something that stopped me from -
Yours,
See you at 5 (I’ll be the one looking woefully unenthused but also very, very thankful, fuck me, you have no idea).
PPS. Hurry up and get out of the shower, I’d like to get you all dirty again. x
Hours had passed before Harry came back but when he did, he looked strangely content. But Draco could not dwell on it much, as it was his turn with the Mind Healer. Maybe this break would do him good, Draco thought as he left.
Potter,
the bane of his life, was flirting with him? This party may not have been such a terrible idea after all.
“Harry, save the love of your life,” Draco called as he ran to get cover.
Every prayer murmured between ourselves after nightmares, every plea uttered by you when I was recovering from curses is proof of a life that was spent in Britain. Of breaths belonging to your living body. Of you having ruled the Slytherin dorms, and my heart.
Rustling from behind.
Draco takes out his textbook and starts preparing his table. He looks up when there's a loud guffaw heard a few tables away. Harry is clutching his stomach and wheezing, Finnigan is doubled over from laughter and Thomas is grinning like an idiot at his own joke, probably. A small smile tugs at Draco's lips. It's been a while, seeing Harry look so carefree. Seeing anybody look so at ease, actually. It wasn't much, but it was a start. Amused sighs bring him back to the present. The entire class is now looking at the antics with a mixture of fondness and exasperation.
And frankly, no matter if we had won, if our lives were switched I’m sure we would have still found each other.
“This cat is yours?” Just Draco’s luck that he would be hypnotized by a cat that belonged to someone he was desperately avoiding.
If this changes your mind to be with me, so be it.  I can live knowing you have a second chance, Draco, but not if you are confined and treated like a commodity to be used.
And there I go again. Off topic as always. You always used to be exasperated by that, my hundreds and thousands of side conversations, the way I moved from thought to thought without linking any of them together. What can I say? I learned to think fast, quick on my feet. The skill certainly served me well when the Death Eaters interrogated me.
“So, what you’re saying is…..”
When Draco’s eyebrows rose impossibly high, Potter hastily explained, “Teddy picked her out as a gift for Luna but we both ended up falling for her Highness. And, she’s so young, I couldn’t leave her alone at home.”
Draco,
“Absolutely. I’ve checked our finances. We have enough to buy another house, replicate my wardrobe, and still have sufficient left for investments,” Draco sounded relieved.
.....
And if you feel the same way that I did, that I
“Right. So, you know what to do?” Draco asked, not believing him in the slightest.
In the dream, we’re together. We’re always together. The Dark Mark is on my forearm, stark in the pale light. You trace your thumb over it, and it sends shivers down my spine.
As he was being branded, all he did was pray - right from the moment the hot metal and dark magic and skin came in contact, through the burning of his skin. It had fooled his aunt, it would probably bring glee to the Dark Lord.
“Yours too, if you wish,” Potter murmured under his breath.
“Yes, they were so cute, I couldn’t stop waving,” Luna responded with shining eyes.
“Were you really waving at them?” Ginny asked as Luna reached them.
As Ginny righted herself, Draco whispered, “Don’t tell me those are…”
was acting like everything was fine. No anger for how Draco had treated him last time. Which was good. He will be able to concentrate on the case better.
I'll have you know that Gigglewater is NOT my favourite drink. Some little twink bastard friend of Seamus' was doing his best to get me drunk (he could've just waited, it turns out) so when he said "Gigglewater is SO unmanly" I took the out and chugged it every time he looked at me (which was too much — Seamus is also due a hex to the bollocks). Anyway, I may have underestimated Gigglewater's potency (I'm sure you noticed) but I promise I didn't like it. And sorry if I was… weird. Yeah. I promise I'm more “civilised” under the influence of a Tempranillo (if you like red) or a dry af Sav (if you prefer white). I tend to avoid rosé myself. Bad night back in Auror training with a guy I should've probably avoided with a bit more finesse (I threw up on him — but to be fair, he deserved it. He was lecherous, and a Wasps supporter). Do you ever get people throwing themselves at you? I can only assume the fame has about the same level of potency as knowing how to dress yourself nicely and all that shit you do. Never teach me your ways — my life is dangerous enough. Though, actually, if you could look at my wedding outfit and let me know what you think while you're here on Thursday? Ginny reckons it's fine but I maintain it's TOO FUCKING TIGHT and she’s being a mischievous shit. As usual.
Now, as for why you’ve
2. The number of things we received in that package will certainly last us for years. This, by the way, is also a hint for you as to how long I’m planning on having you around. A lifetime; just in case you were not clear.
Don’t bother sending me any more letters, Harry. Tell me yourself. I’ll see you at the Spot, where we always used to meet.
But I do not think I am ready to give you up quite yet.
I cannot convince you of anything once you've made up your mind. I had forgotten that, and your letter so kindly reminded me by challenging me to convince you. So, I won't try to. But I can lay out my heart for you, right here, in this letter.
I remember, the day you convinced me to switch. The day you looked inside me, my shredded soul, and it was as if you knew. Knew everything I was going through, the way I was killing myself inside. I remember the rain, pouring down, soaking us both, your hand on mine as you whispered.
That day, I knew that you had killed. But I also knew that you would rather kill yourself than be forced to kill someone else again. Fear for your mother’s life stopped you from running away. And I killed every time you were close to being discovered. Which was twice, and I felt vile and sick when the eyes went from being alive with emotions to going the pale shade of dead. Stone cold.
Draco,
They had been assigned an unsolved case.
Don’t berate yourself.
, he felt breathless. He had allowed himself to hope for the first time in years, and this would be the moment that would define hope for him for the rest of his life.
What you did hurts and even though my pain might hurt less than yours, it still does.
I’d follow you anywhere, Harry. Through blood and rain and fire, I’d follow you.
PPS. Also quite interested in the look of your arse after a gentle flogging.
The man deemed the Saviour walked towards them, and Draco cursed his luck. He stood in place watching Potter hug Luna and tell her how much he’d missed her stories.
Harry was already out the door before Draco could even think of something.
but you also put the fucking strippers on me and all of the catering. And hey, remember that time you volunteered me to go on a sex-dungeon shopping spree with Luna and Pansy?
“I don’t need another favour added to the already heavy list of what I owe you. A life debt at that.”
“So how do you want to do this Potter? And I hope you aren’t planning on sabotaging yourself.” While said in jest, Draco was completely serious.
Also, I expect to see you outside The Emporium of Vogue at 5 p.m. tomorrow. Mrs Lavender Brown-Patil was kind enough to give us an appointment at such short notice. In case you weren't paying attention yesterday: unless you want to look and feel as stiff as a bamboo shoot, you need new attire. I refuse to allow my perfect pictures to be ruined by having you look like a particularly slutty best man (we'll be in the same frame for Salazar’s sake!).
Draco immediately rushed to him, silk shirt and trousers be damned. He knelt in front of the black-haired man, technically his fiancé. “Harry, look at me. What happened? Why are you even here?” he asked gently.
“Your beloved? You hadn’t even met her before this evening. If anything, she belongs to me?” the other shouted just as angrily.
See you after the reprimand that you’re sure to receive from your boss. I have the perfect idea to cheer you up though.
I’m joking. In the last eight years, we’ve all stumbled our way through that one big horror show and the subsequent recovery. If anything, our friends finding love will be another reason to celebrate. I can see Pansy and Luna being together for life. Though I hope the wedding is not too soon. Slytherin weddings can get really exhausting.
They followed the movement of the little-demons-made-of-jelly with their eyes and found Luna waving her arms senselessly while also.. was that singing they heard? Was she waving at them? Luna kept smiling and as she moved her hands, the bats disappeared into the garden.
You know that I will carry hope in my heart even after the point of hopelessness that someday you shall deem my plea
Draco. You certainly would have done things effectively, if not better. But through all that, I would have still fallen for you.
A bit of tussle and Harry is on top of Draco’s slim frame, gloriously nude and wanting.
Sensing an incoming row, Harry interrupted. “Shall we go in? I don’t want to stand here all evening.”
“You utter moron. Who Apparates right the in the middle of a fucking warehouse? Especially one belonging to a criminal!” Draco all but screamed. He sounded annoyed but his relief was evident. “And if this is a way to make sure that I get the job, then congratulations, you won. I have the job, but I’m in the right mind to turn it down because of the stunt you pulled.”
P.S. And by “assistance”, I mean watching and taste-testing. I’m bloody awful at cooking charms.
Ok. I do want there to be a next time, in case that wasn’t clear yesterday. I’d be gutted if this got fucked up because I’m not very good at talking about my feelings. So, yeah. I said it. It’s said. I like you. There you go, I said that too. (Why is that so nerve-wracking?)
I guess we’ll never know. Though, I’m not sure that we would have won if I had been the Boy Who Lived. I don’t think I would have been brave enough.
Draco spluttered. “You… you thought you could use
and I will disappear from your life, like the way you did from mine, by LOOKING ME IN THE EYE. Not by leaving a Merlin-forsaken letter for me after you have already left.
“Plus, you’ve been sleeping for far too long. You know I get bored if I wake up earlier than you.”
You are finally free. Free to live. To move around. Go to all those places you’ve always wanted to go to. Without the shackles of being a Malfoy, without the shadows that you were constantly accompanied by.
Yes. To your question. You don’t have to ask. You can come in your pyjamas.
Draco was nervous. He would be facing Potter again as well as partnering up with him for an assignment. The assignment that will decide his fate for good. But Harry, no,
Draco was clinging to her; his legs wrapped around the woman’s hips with blond hair buried in her neck while Ginny ran as if the floor was on fire.
Voldemort’s specialty was always the mind though. I’m not sure what curse he used, whatever spell he cast upon me, but it’s never gone away. Even now it sometimes hits me, the twisting of my thoughts. I can’t tell what’s real anymore, what’s
You know me too well, Harry. I suppose that’s what happens, after 3 years of being madly in love. (Feel free to read that in a sarcastic tone, perhaps with a smirk.)
“It was a gift from Mum, for my fifth birthday,” Luna replied as if it was the most normal pet to have.
Harry woke up to the sound of children laughing. As always, it put a smile on his face. He quickly rushed down to greet the kids. Evie got the first kiss today, followed by Taylor, Maria, Willis, Rowan, Louie and Edward. Giggling along with them, he took them to the kitchen where Draco had laid out breakfast for everyone.
It is not a mistake, Draco. I don’t need to remind you that I can play games as well. I choose not to. Because I’m tired of the mindless games and chases. Aren’t you, my dragon?
And now I can’t even go back. I was a spy, Harry, one of the best. They all think I’m a murderer, one of those pure blooded fanatics, and nothing can be said about it because my cover even now can’t be blown. I remember what Shacklebolt told me, right after the fighting ended.
"Draco. Hey, Draco! Listen to this." Harry shoved the earpieces from the blasted muggle device, Disc-something (courtesy of the Weasley twins) into Draco's ear when he wasn't even fully awake yet. Nevermind. The fast tempo of the song drove away the last of his sleep. Draco was so lost in listening to the song that he did not notice Harry staring intently at him, a distant smile on his face. After a while, Harry started singing.
“You remember?” His voice heavy with disbelief.
Draco was brought out of his musings by a loud crash, followed by incoherent curse words.
Draco was holding Harry’s old jumper, while his hands shook uncontrollably. For how long could he go on like this? He should have died the day Harry had been attacked by Travers. He would have preferred Azkaban over this torment every single day. It was better to have never experienced this kind of love than to have it taken away. Just as a sob escaped him, strong hands enveloped him in a hug, and he started wailing.
“I have no doubt you’ll be licking your fingers off even before you’re done with it,” was Potter’s remark in return. Was the
“Please, lemme sleep.”
PS. Don't wear white, I'm going to make spaghetti and meatballs (so red wine is probably better - right? See, I'm not totally uncivilised).
“I had to keep a straight face and look at her while she was literally plotting my downfall in front of us.”
“He’s your brother. What do you expect?” Harry asked as they started the brief trek to the cabin they had rented.
“Fuck, Draco, I hadn’t planned on ambushing you. But that arse of yours, when you bent to pick this one and the vulgar moans you’ve been making,”
PS. I know you’ve already read this and you might not even take it home with you, but I wanted to say, for posterity, you have the most amazing arse and I will now probably never be able to sit on my couch without a raging hard-on. Thanks.
The voice cuts through his sleep-addled mind. The seductive sound finally registers, bringing him to the land of the awake. Slow, insistent hands making their way up to his chest arouse him faster. Harry smiles as soft lips ghost over his cheeks. Before they can pull away, Harry captures the lips between his teeth and sucks until he can hear moaning.
“No, but I could see you forming sentences in your head,” came the retort.
But please, for the love of Merlin and Salazar and Morgana and every being close to your heart, let me be close to you once more. So, I can show you what you mean to me, so YOU can give me
(That is a lie, by the way. Don’t get your hopes up.)
, you’ll know that it is love. Though, you never doubted that. It was always me.
. You did hold your liquor well enough, I suppose. Luna was a different story though. If I had known that she would chug down the Fae-dust Blackcurrant wine like water, I would have certainly brought more. Speaking of which, I’m sending another bottle with this letter, since, in your own words,
Moving on, I still think you would like Pansy a lot more once she’s deemed you acceptable company. And by that, I mean once you open up even a tenth of what you do with me, she will do the same. And no better way to do it than
But now I would give up quite a few things to see the way your eyes light up when you speak about your favourite things, the way your hands fly all over the place when you’re excited. And I hope that the stunt I pulled with the Ministry does not stand in the way of this.
Draco’s eyes widened automatically.
, loud enough for Harry to hear. He pulls up his sleeves, the glamour removed now so that an iron-clad warrior riding a chariot can be seen.
As for fighting in another war, by Merlin, if there is another one (as if two weren’t enough) you shall fight from the frontlines. With honour, with power,
They are a menace, and I don’t buy your assurances of them being more bearable under other circumstances.
Sometimes I think I see a demon when I look in the mirror. And I want to keep you away from this. Only you could see this and not be afraid of me. But now, it scares even you. And you deserve better. The question isn’t if you are the best for me. You are, no doubt about it. Everything I ever needed and more than I could possibly want. But maybe you deserve more than a reluctant War Hero (see: boy raised like a lamb to be slaughtered) turned lunatic.
“I had made up my mind to solve it
Another almost-kiss and Draco has to say something. “Harry, why are you punishing me? I need to kiss you more, to feel you more.”
. Draco – warehouse – curses – Hopkirk. It all came back together.
Harry,
Before Harry could agree, Ginny snorted. “No, thank you. Ron would have kept making weird faces every time the topic of my sex life would come up,” she pointed out while loudly banging the car door shut.
“Tell me Malfoy, how has the silence served you for this long? That did not help either, did it?” Harry retorted.
from hexing that bastard journalist in the bollocks.
And yes, what we had was love. Don't you dare say it wasn't, or that it was unrequited. Because if it wasn't love from your side as well, then you won't remember exactly what I need to recover from those crueller-than-life nightmares. You know what I’m talking about, and you know that since my recovery process involves you, I don’t actually recover from the dreams. I do something else that ends up making it worse. Is that what you want to hear? Because I don’t know how to answer that.
Though, the next time, please close the wards to our homes temporarily if you plan on not leaving (or letting me leave) the house for a few days, especially when we’re due somewhere. I don’t fancy Blaise hexing me again while I’m in the
I miss you Draco. I miss you so very much. I know we didn't get sexual, but I would very much like to think that we were romantically involved. That we had
Anyway. I’ve done as you asked, as well, the bus is booked for the stag do and there’s a playlist on my phone we can plug straight into the speakers. How’s the costuming coming along? Have you called all the bars on the way or shall I do some? Do we need to? Is it just because of the decorations we wanted to contact them? Sorry, I didn’t make very good notes when we discussed it because you hadn’t put your shirt back on and you’re kind of fit, so, yeah. Distracted. Maybe you should come over so we can go over it again? Actually, that’s the Floo going in the other room, maybe you’ve read my mind…
That’s why, I went to Kingsley, and demanded he release you of the sanctions and orders given to you. The Ministry has no right letting the Wizarding world think of you as evil for their benefit.
Harry stretched his hand out for Draco to take, and Draco thought he might faint from the giddiness of it all. As he made to get up, Draco realized that Talia had fallen asleep in the time that Harry and Draco were dancing around each other.
“Happy Birthday, Luna!” Potter wished her as he kissed her cheek.
When he made eye contact with Harry, he was not expecting shock writ clearly on his face. “Don’t look so alarmed, Potter. I know my manners, even if I haven’t displayed them in the past,” Draco bit out, clearly annoyed, and a little hurt.
It was easier being alone. Voldemort was persuasive - I would have given up the Order in a heartbeat, killed Dumbledore and damned the entire Wizarding World if it meant keeping you safe.
Harry (Merlin, it will take a while to get used to this)
Instead of being offended, Potter surprisingly burst out laughing. “No, I suppose, I didn’t,” he finally finished.
Yes, that’s what they are calling me now. After I caused a storm for you. But we both know, that is the least of my concerns. It’s welcome, even. I can finally be free of all the things expected of me.
So when the very knowledgeable shop assistant asked me, today, in a sex-dungeon, if I had a particular friend whom I might want to explore ‘impact play’ with, I did, of course, think immediately of you, since you deserve, at the very least, an ‘impact’ to the face, you absolute twat. (I can’t believe I still like you.)
He can't take his eyes off Harry. He so desperately wills his brain to function, that it takes a moment to register the mark on Harry's nape when Thomas yanks Harry back by his collar. It reveals a small, but distinctive black tattoo -
But I know you existed. I know that if I were to go to the Slytherin common room and cast that secret spell you taught me; I will find "Property of Draco Lucius Malfoy" indented into that huge, ever-glowing silver candle next to the reading tables.
Potter only rolled his eyes. “No Draco, I’m not planning anything nefarious, as you call it. And I propose we start going through the basics separately and discuss our individual takes. We can plan further after that.”
4. I’m impressed with the products and the
“Whatever you want, love,” Harry purrs in between teasing kisses.
War never gives. It takes and takes and takes - it took everything from us.
his mind supplied, like the plague since his last interaction. He was almost afraid that Potter's remark of licking many other things would come true if he even so much as ventured near the cake.
and what’s me.
“Are we talking about how red Ron goes when it’s the topic of sex?” Draco butt in.
You have the right to run.
fingers. Salazar, if only it was the kind of
Luna looked as ethereal as ever. Even though she’d just return from a Portkey from Australia. The outdoors suited her, she was sporting a spectacular tan from her time in the island continent. He would ask her about her explorations later. For now, he decided he would ensure she thoroughly enjoyed the party set up in her honour as she came to hug him.
“Of course, the Gulping Plimpies I was taking care of told me,” Luna replied as if anything of meaning could ever be understood from the Plimpies.
On the topic of finding love, how are you faring in that department? Have you been actively trying to find your one true love? I’m not trying to be intrusive, I’m just a sucker for gossip. Care to share your type? I promise not to tell.
As they made their way inside, Draco couldn’t help but ask, “Harry, what spells were you using that they did not affect the bats?”
Another day had passed with no progress. But Draco had an idea that he wanted to test out. He had asked Harry to get Kreacher directly to the old mansion where the last robbery had taken place. Out of all the houses that had been plundered, this was the wealthiest. The gems and precious stones that had gone missing from here may have allowed the robbers to possibly retire for good.
Draco was left speechless. In typical Malfoy fashion, he deflected from his emotions and instead, asked, “So, what now? What have you planned?”
There was a quote I read, somewhere, about how the very same flames that harden stone melt metal. How some people rise from trauma and others crumble from it, how sacrifice only means anything if you have something to lose.
“Draco. Please. Let me help”
“Potter, please. I’m trying to think. Your tantrums are not contributing in any significant way.”
, you’ll find your possessions intact. For now.
Harry finally understood Draco’s heartache. To be looked at with love and then have it all taken away. What was going through Draco, every time Harry looked at him as a stranger, rather than a lover? How could Draco bear to live with this gut-wrenching pain every day?
So then he used other people, made my mother and my father both torture me, over and over again. I still hear my mother’s sobs, as I writhed on the floor. My father never showed any emotion - I hear he’s in Azkaban now.
And all Draco could do was hold on. All those nights when Harry was in a coma for a year, all those days when Harry couldn’t even bring himself to imagine being Draco’s boyfriend, and here he was. Finally in Harry’s arms again. And nothing else mattered. Not before, not ever again. They found each other again.
Instead of thanking him, she stopped him by placing a hand on his arm and proceeded to say something that rendered him frozen to the spot. He did not have time to protest Luna’s whispered reassurances of
Even after all this time, Harry still wondered how Molly managed to provide three full meals enough to feed about two-hundred people every single day. She had help from the other residents of the home, but even then, it was a tremendous amount of work.
Saviour of Wizarding World tag. I’m making you take this leave, so you don’t have a chance to pull weird shit like this again just before you’re to meet me. You do not have an excuse to be late tomorrow. Or I’ll make good on my promise of making you regret something or the other.
So I did. I dropped everything, my family, my title, my life, all for you, Harry. I’d do it again in an instant.
So, this is what discrimination feels like, Draco thought, not for the first time. In the last two years, there had been hundreds of instances where he had been reminded of where life had brought him and how horribly wrong, he had been about so many things in life. Potter was one of the more significant ones.
at the whole double-agent thing. It seems as if Draco Malfoy never existed. No assets or properties under your name, no addresses or even mentions of you. Not even from your "closest friends". And that may have very well been your intention.
“I know. Why do you think I’m this mad? This is blatant discrimination. Even if I were to fuck off and leave you to do everything for this project,
It’s surprising, isn’t it? That we were able to fall in love, despite being on opposite sides. Surprising and wonderful and beautiful.
It’s hard, Harry. So damn hard. It’s been ingrained in me, the masks and the walls and the barriers. It’s what kept me alive in that house, the distance.
‘man of honour’ duties Ginny keeps throwing at me. I swear she has to be making up half of them.
Harry cut him off, “I failed my psychology test. I knew I was going to. And I wanted you to get the position without any bias. We both know you’re brilliant at this. You figured out she had used Travers’ house elf to get in and out of heavily protected mansions to steal, thus giving her a solid alibi and enough money to enter the high society. And you genuinely want to help people. You deserve to be selected.”
I might be running late. Boss is being a needy, troll-faced bastard and insisting that if I hex people I need to write a report about it EVEN IF THEY DON’T DIE. This is needless
For Draco’s selection, they had to solve a case that even experienced Aurors had not been able to solve. That sealed his fate then.
Harry just gave a loving smile, Draco could get used to that, and clutched Draco’s hand in his, leading them to the Floo.
“Seeing them made me remember Blatta, my pet. He died just before I turned eight”
I’m walking down the street. It’s a typical, hot day, the leaves rustling in the tree behind me. I’ve got a carton of milk and a loaf of bread in my hand, humming some random song that got stuck in my head (I think it was
I’m being generous because when you wear clothes that don’t fit you, you become a massive pain in the arse. Seeing you walk
-Harry
curse you for introducing that song to me). I head to my apartment. I open the door, the key scraping in the lock. I am greeted by not one, not two, but 10 different wizards meandering about in my living room.
for the
You’ve always been a fighter, I suppose. I wonder if that’s why you were sorted into Gryffindor instead of Slytherin.
PS. I don't use cooking charms either, I prefer to do things with my hands.
I like to think we are quite the same, save for the different ways in which we grew up. You are right, Draco, about all the things you said. But even more so when you say we know each other too well. We do. That day in the rain, I did not see Draco Malfoy. I saw anguish and fear. Your eyes gave you away. They showed me everything you had been trying to hide behind the indifference.
So I won’t waste my breath trying to convince you otherwise. You know that it won’t be easy, loving me. I’m bitter and broken and far too shattered and I don’t know if I would be able to pretend otherwise. War changes people - you know that as well as I. I don’t know if we’ll ever be the same, if we could ever go back to how we used to be before.
All the while, Ginny and Luna were looking on in amusement. Harry eventually got worried and asked Draco if he was okay. “Love, are you fine?”
Draco,
“Potter, while it certainly is hot that you’re so cocky, I would ask you to get to the bloody point,” Draco bit out.
stiffly,
It was after hours of tucking his tail between his legs that he was beginning to summon the courage to directly talk to Potter again when a commotion caught everyone’s attention. It had gotten so loud that people were rushing the last few steps into the garden.
The shy smile betrayed the bright eyes. Potter was nervous! Draco was glad that Potter wasn’t all confidence. This was apparently affecting him as much as Draco and was he glad about that.
Only when Potter’s eyes dipped to Draco’s lips did he realize that Potter still hadn’t removed his hands from Draco’s face. Draco was vaguely aware that for the last many minutes, his breathing hadn’t been regular. This only caused him to panic further. For the well-being of his poor heart, which felt like it could go into cardiac arrest any minute, he decided to brave it out and ask Harry where this was going.
This was inferred from the unreal noises that I could hear from Pansy’s bedroom. Suffice to say, the sex-dungeon shopping date was successful. In more ways than one.
Don’t make a face, Potter! You know you want to. Plus, it will give you a respite from your “needy” boss. And truly, I still don’t understand, no matter how much you explained earlier, how you thought you could get away with hexing someone (yes, even if they don’t die) and not have to do the paperwork. I refuse to believe you’re dumb enough to think that just because the wizard you hexed was queerphobic, you wouldn’t have to pay for being violent. You truly are something else.
Harry started to protest just as Luna chimed in, “Is it as bad as Hermione’s prattling to cover up that she is embarrassed as well?”
Do I ever regret it, switching sides? Sometimes, when the moonlight hits my skin and the scars show up, or when I collapse on the round because my back is shaking, or when I see the mark on my arm and I want to throw up. I tried to get rid of the mark, you see, tried cutting and burning it. I even tried slicing it off, one layer of skin at a time.
I’m going to repeat myself from last night (just because I can) that your warning about the bees and wearing blue could have come a bit earlier.
-Harry
So I know I’m being foolish. I know that there is nothing left for me in your world, everything burned to ashes and dust.
-Harry
Hope. I can already feel you thinking, of all the ways you could convince me to return. You won’t give up, will you? You never do.
Fur? A small meow near Draco’s feet made him look down. Oh.
I feel silly now. Leaving you a letter even though I’ll just be two rooms away. Must be the darndest thing I’ve ever done, even under the influence of alcohol. You better deliver on your assurance of being able to cure the worst of hangovers.
Plus, I am familiar with all your ruses. Stop lying. You would have written to me no matter how shitty my letter may have been. As is evident from the dried tears that you missed cleaning up.
Love, Draco.
So give up the search. Maybe it would be better for me anyway. Maybe I’m foolish, an idiot, going back to a world that has only caused me pain. Maybe I’m too trusting, so damn naive, maybe I will regret this for the rest of my life.
me the exquisite suit, it is to thank me for being a wonderful friend and helping you buy a
Your habit of prattling on about so many different things at the same time did drive me insane. You cannot blame me though. When you’ve lived year-to-year with the intent of finishing a mission, and had to be alert for signs of danger from the age of three, everything that is not related to the next task is a distraction. I am sorry for all those times I’ve not been nice when you only did what you learnt to do for survival.
By God Harry, I seem to have pissed you off more than I anticipated.
But I will ask again,
Draco,
Draco, I know that by now you will have been contacted by the Ministry, relieving you of your spy duties, and invited to publicly pronounce you as an ally of the Light. Don’t be furious.
Either way, Harry, I’m looking forward to seeing where we go from here. Gentle flogging or not.
, as the man who had been plaguing his dreams since he was eleven made an entrance.
When he couldn't bear to see his beloved messy-haired boyfriend like that anymore, Draco shoved him away and turned. As he was walking back, he heard the words:
“Ow!” Ginny jumped and narrowed her eyes at Draco, “You bastard!”
I never thought it’d be you I’d gossip about my love life with, though. And it will continue to not happen. Because reporters are sneaky motherfuckers and I’m not putting anything that pathetic down in writing. Suffice to say, no, I am not in love. No, I am not on Tinder, or Grindr or Howlr, or any of those, and I’m too fucking exhausted to go out on the pull anymore. I expect I’ll come across someone nice at the supermarket eventually and we can be boring together, in our pyjamas. That’s my type. Boring in pyjamas. Try and gossip about that.
I think it’s safe to say that I wet my goddamn pants. Metaphorically, of course.
I can’t say I’ve ever seen a version of Pansy I’d want at my side, but at least with Luna she seems mostly harmless. And each to their own. Love is love, etc. You are right though (as much as it goes against my instinct to admit it) their wedding would be WEIRD. Though that could be said no matter who was marrying Luna, and also anyone who’d marry Pansy (I always thought it’d be you).
“No. That’s not what I’m surprised about. I’ve never… never... You know what, we can discuss this later. Let’s focus on the problem at hand.”
“Draco, first, this is not charity. Why can’t you take help when you need it? You know this is the last chance you have. Every other department has already passed you over, and if you don’t get in here, then, well.... fuck.”
Draco had been at the party for less than five minutes, and he already wanted to leave. This entire operation had been a bad idea. Why did he even agree to this?
And yet the scars never go away. You always asked me about them, the year I defected. You did seem very fascinated with them, always kissing them and touching them, brushing them whenever we kissed. You told me it was to remind myself, that whatever torture I went through did not define me.
I cannot guarantee you complete freedom from this darkness. Hell, there will probably be more if I come back into your life, what with my lunatic brain in the mix. But I can promise you that you will have someone by your side. You can be saved, just as much as I can. You can understand to differentiate. You even know how, deep down, irrespective of whether you think you deserve to or not. The question, my beloved dragon, is do you want to learn to tell the difference?
3. I consider this as an investment (a great one at that) in our active and exciting sex life. (See reason two)
Then there was the problem of Potter. He claimed to be a friend and had all but deserted him in that bloody cabin. He even had to salute that Proudfoot witch, even though she would be the reason he was going to be sent to Azkaban.
God, Harry. It was…bad. Being 15 and a spy in your own house, having to watch and smirk and
Anyway, I better get to bed now. I can barely keep my eyes open, as you can guess from my worsening penmanship through the letter. And I hope that where you end up falling asleep at night does not affect the quality of your promised pancakes. I’ll be dreaming about those tonight.
” Harry’s voice cracked.
Anway, if you’re interested, I was thinking of inviting them around mine for dinner this weekend under the guise of planning the stag and hen parties. I’ll cook if you supply the drinks? (If I ever recover enough to drink again) How’s Thursday?
“Oh, Draco! What a wonderful party. Every time I tried to imagine what you would come up for my birthday, I would get different visuals in my mind. But nothing was certainly as magnificent,” she said by way of greeting.
Pansy’s uncharacteristic giggle reminded him exactly why. He’d generously helped with organizing the surprise birthday party to help his love-sick friend impress the up-and-coming Wasps player. That the birthday-person was also a close friend of his was beside the point. He narrowed his eyes at the cheesy scene unfolding in front of him. Pansy was batting her eyelids at Ginevra Weasley who was beaming at his best friend in turn. People had only started arriving and yet, with every chime of the door his nervousness increased.
Though, you’ll find Pansy considerably grateful the next time you see her. Which is just three days from today. Which also means that we have less than that time to prepare the stag do, that was supposed to happen yesterday. Blaise will not be above charming my hair ORANGE if he knows that I seem to have abandoned my best man duties in favour of helping you out. Hence, we are both taking leave from work tomorrow to prepare to throw a party fit for the sole heir of the Zabini family. I’m going to need the holiday. I may as well tell you the truth, since you already discovered I’m quite a lightweight. I’ll be sleeping in until 10 and meet you for brunch around 11.
At this, Draco grinned brightly and took Harry’s hand.
In any case, they told me that I was now free. That I could go home, collect my inheritance, that I would receive a prize of some sort (Order of Merlin, I think, I can’t remember). And that was that. Two minutes, and I was welcomed back into the Wizarding World with all the apologies of the Ministry.
Though for the next time, I would like more than ten minutes to start getting dressed for a party, especially one as big as this; and I would have had more time if it wasn’t for your insistence on trying out the restraint bench on the same day as the stag do. You will be held answerable if I lose my spot in the best-dressed list this year.
That is the last coherent word Draco speaks for the rest of the morning. Harry’s tongue and fingers only allow for gasps and moans and sighs.
friend to The Velvet Witch under the guise of shopping for the kinkiest hen do the Wizarding World has seen. Pansy conveyed this idea to me a bit too enthusiastically after we left.
that Draco so often wanked to.
Harry
And most importantly,
The “box” which we received was a bloody giant crate that was big enough to fit my couch! Needless to say, that purchase has definitely assaulted my Gringotts account. Under other circumstances, I would have set a handful of your precious belongings on fire. But since I’m amused
“Now, we celebrate. In honour of the progress that you’ve made.”
Harry,
I know you’ve killed before, haven’t you? We both have. So you know what I’m talking about, when you end a life. The way their eyes go blank and their body stiffens and they collapse on the floor. I saw many people being killed, was forced to kill some myself. Some are defiant, some heartbroken, some brave and some so hurt they can’t even move. But it’s all the same in the end - another body on the floor.
And I am desperate, Draco. I’ve been like that for a long time. I went to great lengths to find you over the last fifteen months, and it is only by chance last month that I found evidence that you were even alive. And if takes flattery to get you here, I am willing to indulge you every day for the rest of our lives. But as I said, I will understand if your freedom takes precedence.
Also, I want to get a few things out the way regarding the special package arranged for me.
“Well, you weren’t at home and then it never came up.”
You know I would have stood by your side no matter what. That I would have helped you fight whatever it was that you needed to fight. Make me
I had to do this. Not for you, but for me. How could I live, letting you suffer and pay for things that were out of your control? Even after all that you have done. Knowing your affinity for repenting more than is needed, I made a choice.
Harry rasped.
“We’re burning the house down,” Draco said with a vengeance.
“Is this warm enough, love?”
There is so much I want to say that I don’t even know where to start. To be honest, I’m not even sure that you want to hear it. But I’m going to barrage on regardless, like the idiotic Gryffindor you always accused me of being, and maybe came to like.
Was it love, those brief, beautiful moments we had?
Once Harry nodded, both men started with the spellwork around the perimeter. After a good hour, they were done. The mansion was covered in mostly all the spells that had been in place on the day of the robbery. “Kreacher now is your time to shine,” Harry said solemnly.
At the risk of sounding sappy again, you deserve the throne. It doesn’t have to be Malfoyan though, does it? Although now I understand your need for secrecy. It is part of the reason you survived. But why from me? Why now? After we won; albeit without most of our sanity. But I wonder, does it matter? Because if I can have you again, my sanity, or whatever is left of it, is a price I would be willing to pay.
“Hey, that’s the only spell I can do wordlessly, seeing that all our wands are in the car,” was the indignant reply. “You cannot judge, Mr Head Potioneer of the Unspeakables Department! You work with bat wings and bat spleen all day.”
All his manners went out of the window. He cringed even as he asked, “You knew about this surprise party?” He'd have to find out which of the insufferable buffons had spilled the beans to her.
“Draco. Where are you? You could have had the patience to wait outside for me at least,” Harry called out as he entered their assigned room.  He frowned when he realized Draco wasn’t there. Without thinking much, he decided to look over the list of suspects while waiting for Draco. When he couldn’t find it even after a thorough search, he panicked. He knew exactly where Draco was.
“I never said a word,” Draco said affronted.
But I do know I am human. Don’t need to write you a letter to know that — but maybe you need to look in the mirror. The eyes that will stare back will be human, regardless of the haunted appearance. You are human, Draco. Because if you weren’t, those bloodcurdling dreams wouldn’t affect you. You wouldn’t be trying to figure out all these things. The fact that you so desperately want me to present a compelling case to you about all things life, and magic, and love is proof enough.
“She allowed me to pet her fur,” was all that was said before the sharp crunch of knuckles with jaw was heard.
At this, Harry pushed him back. “But I want to. Pansy mentioned how it was a given that I always cooked. And you liked only my cooking over everyone else’s. I want to give you your old Harry. You’re doing so much, and I can’t even cook.” Towards the end, Harry was shouting.
PPS. Pansy should just ask Luna herself, I’m not setting them up on a sex-dungeon shopping date, that’s too far.
Even with relief coursing through him at avoiding Azkaban, he couldn't believe that Harry had defended him. After the trials, he was still reeling from shock when his favourite Gryffindor came to stand in front of him. This time when Draco looked into the eyes of the Saviour,
“Malfoy….. Draco. Wait, please. I did not call a favour. I spoke to Hermione about the selection. But it was for my own sake, more than yours. Even though my intentions were two-sided. You know why I couldn’t save myself in the warehouse?”
“I wonder how you would have reacted if I had told you about the bats in Grimmauld Place,” Harry joked.
I will give up on my search for you. As for hope, even though it is a vile thing, even though more often than not it is deception, I will hold on to it. After all, it got me through two villains in my life - Vernon and Voldemort. It also gave me some wonderful people - the Weasleys, Luna, Neville. You.
We shared an intimacy that went beyond what’s normal. All our truths and secrets laid naked and bare in front of each other. For the other to see, to understand, and to accept.
1. I am, in fact, one of the greatest boyfriends you will ever find.
So. Pansy and Luna. Thursday. Anytime you can get here is fine, I'll add you to the wards so you can just come in whenever. Please do bring wine. Luna is partial to the weird ones, elderflower or gooseberry or feijoa (do they make dirigible plum wine? Plimpy port?), though I dunno how loose you want her to get (or how loose Pansy will want her? That feels a bit beyond what I want to know.) Maybe rosé is safer?
“He’s still overprotective. I’m a lesbian, for Merlin’s sake!” Ginny kissed Luna loudly on her lips just to prove her point. And also because she wanted to. But that was beside the point.
“Harry, will you take me on that date, now?” Draco quietly asked.
All the while, only one thought was running through Draco’s mind.
“Not all of it. But I remember the most important part — what it means to love you.” Harry says, now holding him even more tightly.
“There are bats in our home?” Draco almost yelled again. “And you did not think to tell me, Potter?”
. Maybe -
“This one’s on you,” said Harry at the same time that Luna exclaimed, “We’re almost there!”
“Fuck you, and fuck this. I’m going for my psych eval.”
The next few hours were spent in a daze as Draco’s mind struggled to decide between the remote possibility that Potter reciprocated Draco’s feelings or whether Draco was reading too much into things. His brain’s current overdrive paired with alcohol wasn’t the best option for rationalization. But, oh well, he couldn’t function without either of those in Potter’s constant presence and visibility, could he?
This letter is also a promise. A promise that if you choose to meet me, I will not ask anything of you that you wouldn't want to do. A promise that I will leave you alone if you so wish, even after you meet me.
He knew now. He knew what he must do. Stop standing in his own way. The fear of losing Draco was worse than his fear of living a stranger’s life.
Next time (if there is a next time?) perhaps we can stick to the bedroom so I don’t have to start avoiding other rooms in my house just to keep my dick calm?
Draco donned his Malfoyan facade, to prevent the noseless Dark Lord from accessing his treacherous secrets. He would do the same thing he had been doing since his Aunt Bella had started teaching him Occlumency. Recite the prayer - his and Harry's song.
Draco.
Harry thought to himself while he tried to get rid of the bats. He flailed his arms around after his attempted magic failed. Ginny stopped a few feet away - still carrying Draco - from Harry as he unsuccessfully tried to shoo the bats away.
Potter took so long to answer that Draco had begun to suspect that it was a joke. As Draco stirred, Potter came back to his senses, “Yes! Yes, right now,” he was smiling like a lunatic.
Draco immediately took Harry in his arms, Vanishing all the mess as he hugged his beloved. Not for the first time in his life, he wished to have his way with Harry’s Muggle family. “Harry, it’s okay. Love, you can mess up as much as you want. This is your house, all of it — the kitchen, the rooms, the drawing room, the garden. You can make a hundred mistakes, and no one will hurt you. And you don’t have to cook for me or anyone, ever.”
Harry only grunted. “If it stops you both from talking about Ron and Hermione’s sex life, she can do whatever the hell she wants.”
Leaving now (not even late!) (much).
Harry couldn't figure out what was wrong until he looked into Draco's eyes. Draco was hugging him as if his life depended on it, yet he had never looked more determined. When realization dawned, all Harry could do was shake his head furiously. "No, Draco. You can't do this. I won't allow you to."
“With the help of a mind healer. I’ll be starting next week. But now, we celebrate your success.”
But I know the burden of a mark you didn’t choose. We can find a way. Until then, don’t you do anything else to yourself! I’m not losing you to the stupid mark after defeating the person who gave it to you.
Hermione Flooed me a little while ago to tell me that Ron hasn’t left their bed since they got home Friday night. Blaise and him broke into a “special” batch of that whiskey and I don’t want to ask where he brewed this one. (Is there such a thing as toilet brewing?) Have you heard from anyone else? This weekend has been far too quiet for my comfort. Though, it could just be because the party was a cracking success. It seemed like everyone had a great time.
And since we are on the topic, I’m planning on installing the sex swing that has recently come into my possession, courtesy of a very thoughtful admirer. Care to lend me a hand? I need to test out its sturdiness and the various ways I can use it to drive my lover insane.
Good lord. If I knew you were this eloquent with your letters, I may have been persuaded to write to you earlier.
It is what it is. We were young and naive and hopeless, forced into a war that should not have been ours and we lived. Scarred, yes, covered in bloody gashes and painful memories but we got out. We survived.
And you. You’re everywhere. In my nightmares, bleeding on the floor. In my memories, healing my wounds or against my lips or laughing as you raise your wand, the scarlet jets hitting my body.
Anyway, I'm rambling, sorry. See you Thursday.
Even I was shocked at the alleged eloquence of my last letter. But the thing is, Draco, when you think you only have one chance of gaining back your lost world, you put everything into it, surprising everyone, even yourself.
Draco,
So no. No, I won’t deny what we had. How could I, when it saved me so many times? How could I, when it was the only thing getting me through the pain? I used to repeat it in my head, when they were torturing me, over and over again.
Harry chuckles, “It’s not called spying, Draco if I haven’t been able to take my eyes off you. You’ve also almost kidnapped Talia, and Teddy would have been really sad about that.”
He took another bite and sighed again, so lost in the taste that only when a finger touched the corner of his lips that his eyes flew open. Potter’s fingers were lightly roaming over his lips even as Draco continued to stare at him. He was alarmed and aroused at the same time. Potter was standing so close. Scratch that, he was bending over Draco, face inches away.
I dreamt about you, last night. The bed always seemed too large without you in it - I turn around, reaching out for someone and awoke holding onto air.
. He would go to Azkaban because of his actions from two years earlier, but she wasn’t helping him avoid it either.
You’re probably the only one who’ll understand.
It was my unexpected Slytheriness that drew you to me. You loved that I could see right through you, even under all those masks. Because you wanted someone to be able to see past all the lies you created to hide your desires. You wanted all the sappiness and the declarations of forever. You dreamt of a constant, of all the forbidden touches and affection. Something you were told you shouldn't have.
as they tortured them. So many people, bleeding out on the marble floor, so many people I
I dunno. Love seems… ugh. Like something that happens to other people? I feel like I couldn’t possibly suspend my crippling sense of realism for long enough to act all smooshy and heart-eyed and soft like everyone else seems to. Do you happen to know anyone who likes brutal honesty and blunt, artless declarations of affection these days? We should go back to just sending people we like poems written by other people that say the things that we’re not capable of saying to their face. Add that to my type. Boring, pyjamas, blunt, likes poetry.
So. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to look at my kitchen table again. Not without that feeling of confused arousal and the ghost-like sensation of syrup dripping down my arse crack. Not that the arousal is confusing, I’ve just. I dunno. I’ve never had any sort of sex on a table before. Or on a pancake, but there isn’t a stack of them in my kitchen at all times, so it’s dismissable. Right now, every time I walk in there, all I can think about is you. I’ll stand at the kettle waiting for it to boil, half-hard and wondering if I should Floo you to come over. (Should I?) I’ve repaired all the dishes and cleaned the table, both the magical and Muggle ways, but I still can’t bring myself to sit at it and eat. Last time I sat there, it was to suck you off and I can’t shake the memories out of my head. I almost fellated my toast when I had some earlier and had to eat in the lounge lest I choke on the crumbs.
PS. You know what, I need to see the look on your face when you open it. I’ll see you tomorrow around 2pm.
But it was beautiful all the same. Magical, I suppose (ironic isn’t it? That the one who was born into magic would be the one to lose it). We were something, something wonderful, life forged in a war of death. Because it’s much easier to find someone you would die for than to find someone you would kill for.
Weight on him.
“Piss off, Malfoy,” Potter grinned good-naturedly.
Anyway. I still don’t believe you about the kneazle. You’re a fucking lightweight and all your talk of how other people handle their booze is bollocks because you have the fortitude of a teenage girl. Next time, we will throw you in the downstairs shower 'til you’re less embarrassing to yourself and you can sleep here. That way I can make sure you don’t choke and die in your sleep and get me blamed for it. Plus, I make pancakes that can absorb the worst regrets and the most deserved hangovers. Which is lucky because I really want to open this bottle of wine NOW. I’ll chill it. You can come back here after our (groan) shopping trip. I fancy trying that new Indian place’s spicy biryani - Dean says it’s amazing and Lisa’s afraid of it - both high praises.
The plain intent of this letter is to convince you to meet me, one last time. I know that there is a reason you chose to disappear. Not to mention, you did a bloody good job of it as well. Though, that’s not surprising considering you were
“I suffered a panic attack. Which happens frequently. In addition to nightmares, anxiety episodes and hypersensitivity. I’m not mentally ready to be an Auror. I was doing it for Ron’s sake. But my heart wasn’t in it. I wanted the selection officer to not just blindly select me because of being the Boy Who Lived. Whether or not this situation was present,” Harry gestured to the space between them.
on bats?”
charm to get me the job! Saint Potter can’t get enough of people worshipping him and owing him favours. Explains why you’re not surprised.”
He followed the beautiful kitten inside as she made her way determinedly. He was certainly curious as to where the tiny beauty wanted to go or if she belonged to someone. But more importantly, he would follow the little one anywhere, what with her green eyes and all. She came to a halt in front of the table that had the cake and started purring loudly.
Please write back. Please. I know you are not okay. I can sense from countries away, your fear when you wake up trembling in the middle of the night. I can feel your cold, damp skin when you have to relive, in your dreams, the stare of every pair of cruel eyes that has ever looked at you.
Merlin. It’s been a long time since I’ve written those words, written anything to do with the whole shitstorm of the wizarding world. Did it ever cross your mind, Harry, that perhaps I did not want to be contacted? Did you ever think that maybe I “disappeared” for a damn good reason, that maybe I was hoping to escape everything and hopefully die alone one day?
Do you ever wonder, sometimes, what life would have been like if we were reversed? If you were the one raised in a house of Dark Magic, if I was the Chosen One? Do you ever wonder what would have happened?
