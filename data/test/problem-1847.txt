“No, I just checked that I did not rape you” Draco - Harry thought he could call him by his first name since they were almost naked in a bed - laughed again and murmured a sentence that Harry did not understand.
“You look like Sirius that's crazy” The boy smiled slightly as he replaced his leather jacket properly on his shoulders, Harry was not mistaken. The door opened a second time.
“We have no more doubt now, do we?” Harry laughed. Ron was white as a towel and Hermione wondered if he would be distinguished if he stood in front of a white wall. She chuckled at this thought then stopped when they looked at her strangely. They wanted to go on to find the other doors, but the children stopped them.
“You understood me very well” It turned out that the blond was as red as Harry. They stared at each other for a long moment, trying to understand the meaning of this conversation. Malfoy stirred slightly before resting his head on the pillow. Their two bodies were now stuck, Harry could feel each parcel of Draco's skin. He also rested his head on the pillow and his nose touched the blonde’s one, who looked at him with wide eyes. Harry ran his arm over Malfoy's back again, not knowing where to put it. The blond had now his eyes closed and Harry did the same, feeling suddenly exhausted. The last thing he knew before falling asleep was Malfoy's arm running down his back and bringing him closer to him, if that was still possible.
“Relax Potter! I just watched you a little.” Harry felt his cheeks warming up, a sign that he was blushing.
“I think this one is mine” Malfoy said, pointing to Lesath, still in Lyra's arms. This was indeed the case but the child preferred to stay in the arms around him. Zabini frowned as he looked at each person in the room. Then an illumination seemed to be in his mind.
“We must believe that it is no longer relevant” Harry could hear no more, sinking into unconsciousness
"It was a joke and you know it very well." Harry put himself in the same position as the blond and he could read in his eyes all the sincerity he felt. He calmed down instantly and Draco could feel it and sat down with a small smirk. Blaise cleared his throat.
“Oh ! Yes, yes, he's here too” Blaise's eyes widened and he screamed, but then scrambled for the exit, slamming the door shut under Harry's laughter. The latter and Draco finally took a shower, a very long shower and Blaise looked away when they arrived in the kitchen a good hour later. Before they could say anything, Hermione and Theo ran down the stairs behind their backs.
Draco was sitting quietly on a sofa in the living room. Harry was sleeping on the same sofa, his head on the blonde's lap. In front of him, on another sofa, stood his six children and some of their friends. To tell the truth, Ezekiel was laying full length and Lesath also seemed to be taking a nap lying on his brother. Emett sat astride an armrest, Nathaniel, Erin and Lyra were sitting on the back of the sofa. Dimitri was lying nonchalantly on the second armrest. Seth, Erika, Irina and Isallys were sitting at the foot of the couch and seemed captivated by the carpet they were sitting on. Jordan, Alarik and Joris were leaning against the back, each behind his respective girlfriend or boyfriend.
After Madam Pomfrey checked him over, casting a few spells and telling him to stay put for the day, he was left with Luna and Greg. For a while, nobody said anything.
To Draco, he could see the way Harry was smiling at him, brushing fingers at his hairline, his cheek, the tingles of magic that shivered down his skin. He could feel his hand moving down his neck, his shoulders, his waist. Harry was pressing their foreheads together, dipped down together, Draco laughing thickly as he could see the colours following down Harry's hands, filling in the grey that had become him and his life.
He knew this. This had already happened before. Draco watched Greg pull at his wand and knew he was about to drop it. He was mouthing the words Blaise was about to say before he’d uttered them.
Draco tore his eyes away from Potter’s grin and looked towards the bed. Potter’s fingers seemed to brush against one of the notes; this sketch looked brighter than the rest, as if the sun had graced it and forsaken the others. Turning his head, Draco realised that the picture was not Potter’s but his.
He quickly wiped at his cheeks before pivoting, trying to shake off the somewhat dark sensation Granger’s revelation had caused within him.
There was a tightness in Harry’s expression that Draco wanted to smooth away, with his hands, fingers, or lips. He told himself that it might happen soon, even if Harry didn’t seem so sure.
They took him to a shower which he stood in, his hands roaming all over the tiles. They took him out to the pitch where Draco leapt from where one set began and another suddenly vanished
Pulling himself away from the sight, he now focused on his immediate surroundings. Pansy was flipping Blaise off after a poorly timed quip about her new haircut. Vince and Greg were hunched over beside Draco. The first was drawing patterns into the wood of the desk with the moisture of his fingers. The other was trying to reattach a shirt button that had fallen off by repeatedly pressing it against where it was once stitched.
"Harry – you alright?" Ron asked. He sounded distressed over Harry's tears. "It was only a bit of a spill, I’m not
“He knows you’ve always cared, very much so,” Lovegood murmured, as if answering his thoughts. ‘Here – this is for you.’
The bruises on his throat healed too slowly. Pomfrey said it was because Burns had put some of his magic into throttling Draco. And with the bruises, the stares and the gossipmongering was hard to face too.
“I left something for you. Look in the diary. Please," Harry rushed, and Draco now had the awful sensation that time was running out.
But the unfortunate part of spending all his time with her was that she began to notice, very closely, his failing health, and how perpetually ill he was. Now she was bringing up the topic of getting him checked every chance she could throughout the first week.
There was nothing except the swirl of black and the strange sense that something might be right behind him.
So he pulls at Draco's hand and draws him close, nose pressed up against his, and he murmurs against his lips, "Kiss me."
But he doesn't. That might have been terribly out of line anyway. Instead, Harry says, "Go out with me."
“Barely," he croaked, the act of speaking causing another wave of ice-pick headache. “Too bright.” Draco attempted to growl when the mediwitch pushed his curtains opening, letting even more bleach-yellow sun in.
With a furrowed brow, Draco saw the door slowly form. He hadn’t asked for it nor had he paced from side-to-side thrice whilst mumbling his request. He breathed shakily as he turned the door handle. It opened into a moderate-sized room, furnished in deep reds, with soft patterned carpets, a roaring fire, and an overstuffed armchair.
Potter bit his lip. It was trembling as were his fists. The defeated look Potter gave him clued Draco into how he must have looked then; a man who was ready to burn.
Harry is a little too distracted by the profile of him, his book held up in his hands, leaning against Harry to let him see, and how close he is, and how much closer he could be.
He wanted to hide away, preferably deep under his covers so that he might never have to leave them again. Draco thought he might get his wish until a figure at the end of the hallway came into view.
“I’m a dab hand at healing charms — have to be with the Thestrals and Grindylow… let me have a look?”
“Oh Merlin,” Draco breathed tremulously as more tears tracked down his cheeks and neck. “Fuck.” He hissed through a sob.
second year. Both came to me with symptoms much like your own. I would hear them whispering to themselves in the dark. They’d always be distracted, watching something out of the corner of their eye. They’d murmur a person’s name, over and over. All the while, their magic was draining
There was a moment of shock that flashed across Greg’s features, and then a slow recognition. Draco knew what he had just admitted, and there was no shame in his belly. There was no fear in his heart.
Leaning back against the headboard of his bed that night, Draco casted a Lumos, took the notes out from the book and spent hours reading through each one. He only noticed his fingers gripping the parchment tightly when he released them, seeing the dips of them creasing over the parchment.
Draco felt blindly for his wand, and it wasn’t where he left it. He couldn’t find it, and his mind was too terrified to summon it. He clawed at Burns, his face, his arms, his neck. He tried to reach for Burns' throat so he could choke him out, anything,
Pomfrey wrung her hands and Draco had to force himself to hold her gaze and not stare at the boy sitting behind her.
Ron's grabbing Hermione from around the waist and spinning her in a half-circle, rapid-firing kisses into her cheek as she laughs, and then reaches up over her head and dumps a handful of snow over his red beanie hat, grinning, kissing him. Pansy seems to be mock-exaggerating a cooing sound to Blaise, but it seems all in good fun. She balls up snow from the ground in her gloved hand and smears it over Blaise's face, then, apparently turning on her own teammate.
“You don’t. You didn’t deserve any of it. Or any of this.” Lovegood gestured to him, her pupils as small as a needle’s point.
-who-lived. Not the man. The notion that Potter had only been a child when he died made it all the more awful.
Harry shrugs, distracting himself with the scuff of his shoe against the ground, his hands in his trouser pockets.
Something in his gut told him that he shouldn’t, not if he wanted to keep Harry. All magic had a cost; and Draco suspected that keeping your own personal apparition of the
Draco drifted in and out, to the daylight casting on Harry's face there, or his mother gently shaking him awake, casting spells on him, dripping potion on his lips. Nutritional spells. Pain-killer potions. Calming draughts. Sometimes it would be in the noon, or afternoon, or evening — he couldn't always tell. His mother would often be at his side.
Unbidden, a tear dropped down Harry’s cheek as he stared at Malfoy with parted lips. Everything around him blurred. Malfoy’s eyes tracked it as it fell, his own expression morphing. The mask he wore was slipping.
“Alive and kicking,” Draco sniped back, trying to shift his dead legs so he could get his wand out his trouser pocket.
Draco thought, running a hand over the ink of Harry's handwriting, imagining him writing this under a lamp at his desk.
She sighed before continuing, “I have had the honour of treating many patients, with a great number of complaints
He put the chain back down the front of his nightshirt, the cold of the stone making his skin prickle. Blood dripped down over it, like sand in an hourglass.
“You all go ahead – I’m just finishing up here," Draco murmured, his lips feeling somewhat numb as he sounded the words out.
Harry knits his brows, but complies with his demand. He moves over to lie down next to him and waits for him to do whatever it is that he wants to do.
Looking down at the ground again, he realised that these were prints too. Looking around, he saw that there were
Draco doesn't come back to meld his body into his. "Do you not… Ah, whatever." He scoots away from him on the bed. "Some people aren't into that sort of thing, I suppose."
The content of these dreams might be seen as somewhat boring to the everyday outsider. They were holding hands as they drank their morning tea, laying in bed together until mid-afternoon just talking, their fingertips touching. In others, their friends surrounded them, and there was noise, laughter, and glasses clinking merrily.
Granger’s voice had sounded so lifeless around each of these utterances. Then an awful anguish sounded;
He had already left the room, donning his coat, and was hastily making his way to the door as the man attempted to plead.
even when Harry was alive and they were children pushing and pulling at each other. Some of these desires were
Harry was here, even if it was only for a while, even if it was only in the very last of his moments, and Harry was wrapping his arms around him, pulling him close and burying his nose into his shoulder, whispering,
Chest tightening, Draco laid the letter down on his bureau carefully, promising to read the rest of it later.
He must have felt Draco's weight, falling fully onto him, because Harry drew back then and stroked his face softly like he couldn't stop touching him.
His vision was blurred, but upon staring at the earth beneath him, he began quickly swiping his eyes to clear them. On the grass, there were patches of green, the most vivid kind Draco had ever seen. It was so bright
Draco's body is soft under his clothes, his belly swelling and sinking against his arm. There's a faint scent of his cologne, mingling with the smell of his hair, something herbal and sweet.
in this moment that Draco’s knees felt weak. It felt like Harry was really here, like he had never died, as if the image of his pale, cold body was nothing but a sick nightmare.
Draco knew the story of the brothers and the tools of Death, but he tried to tap down the rush of excitement that filled him to the brim then.
Ron and Hermione haven't always been much for casual displays of affection, not until this year at least, besides the occasional hugs after vacations or on reconciliation after life-or-death situations, or Hermione occasionally laying her head on his shoulder when she's sad or worried, or Ron's hand patting his back and shoulder. This year, however, something has seemingly changed. They do all the same things, but they do it more often. Perhaps it was the war, or perhaps it was his false death, or perhaps it was something else entirely.
Narcissa flinched, her eyes darting upstairs to where his father’s study was above them. Her eyes clouded for a moment when she remembered; Lucius’ keen ears and constant shadow wasn’t there to dog them anymore. Draco missed it, and thought it was strange what grief could make you wish for again.
Draco was equal parts floored and confused when Harry backed away from him, and then vanished completely.
"Lay down," he said to him. Draco smiled, an overjoyed breath. He was dying and he knew this, but he'd never felt more alive than he did now, feeling Harry's life and body and warmth against his hands.
Tears fell down Granger’s cheeks and Draco felt his own were wet too. She looked back at the spot where Harry was standing, his expression devastated.
The aftermath, the stillness and quiet of him on the ground, and his eyes distantly fixated up at the grey sky, still the greenest bloom of colour.
Draco looked at Harry, his eyes widening when he heard his name spoken by the very same voice he wished and wished he could hear again. Then, Draco was staring at those lips again and far stranger wishes whispered in his ear.
He turned his head to gaze at the mess of notes and sketches strewn around Draco, some of which he still held in a tight fist. Potter settled at the end of the bed, at which Draco felt his own breath hitch, his poor lip chewed on. Draco didn’t turn to see what Harry was looking at; there were too many little shifts in his expression to keep track of.
With wide eyes, he stared at Malfoy, who was already looking back at him with an intensity that made Harry shiver. And he was still whistling, so softly that it was barely audible above the bubbling pewter cauldrons all around them.
He stood quickly and pivoted, trying to catch another glimpse of him. Draco didn’t hear anything except the high-pitched ringing in his ears. Ignoring his classmates, Draco hurried forward, his eyes scanning the rafters.
It was Potters bed, he knew that, and yet it didn’t really sink in, like the knowledge was too large a bite to swallow easily.
Concentration now firmly ruined, Draco’s eyes roamed the space around him. In half a year, Hogwarts would no longer be opened to him. He felt very much as if he were on borrowed time already, and a firm deadline to his continued sanctuary within these walls made his mind obsess over the issue.
Draco pushed back his sleeve, almost tearing it. There was a patch of bright, pale skin, shining as if lit from within. Draco quickly pocketed his wand and, holding his breath, he ran a finger over the shape on his forearm.
"He left us," she then said. "He said goodbye and that – that stone you have there. It’s rather special. A Hallow in fact."
Here, Harry was less robotic, but wholly morose. Draco then read about the Triwizard Tournament from his perspective
Draco didn’t know then that it would be one of the last times he’d see Harry alive. If he did, he might have moved heaven and earth to touch him then. A simple caress would have sufficed —
On a Saturday, sitting on a bench in Hogsmeade after Harry and Draco had both copped out of a snowball fight between them and their friends, Harry thinks a little too much about taking his cheeks, pink against the white frost of the world around them, in his hands and kissing him.
When everyone had left, Draco went to Potter's grave and laid lilies on the bed of soil. He raised his gaze, a flick upward from a bowed head through the lissom fall of his hair, his brows drawn together dolefully. It landed on the stone, the carvings, the elegant loops and curls of calligraphy.
He tips his head at Harry whenever he passes by him in the hallways, a small smirk at one corner of his lips that has an entirely different undertone to it nowadays, one that leaves Harry nowhere near irritated and very much near something that makes his heart skip a beat.
In the months that follow, it becomes a fairly common thing to do in the mornings, at nights on the occasions Harry sneaks into Draco's bed after everyone in the Slytherin Commons is asleep. Harry never has to ask because Draco always offers first, always gives him everything that Harry hasn't been able to ask for.
Draco reared up a few more steps. The flinch shuttered Lovegood's perpetually dreamy expression before it turned dark, so much so that Draco noticed that it was the first time she’d ever looked so sober.
Draco realised that Goyle thought Draco was shouting at Burns, and that broke his heart a little, for Goyle though, not for himself.
There's Molly, who's always hugging him whenever he comes over, casually brushing a hand over his hair, touching his shoulder and back, kissing his head, and he thinks she does it more often to him because he's the only one that doesn't recoil away from her or roll his eyes, the only one that's still not really too used to it. Even after Fred, even in her grief, she has loved him the same. He hadn't known what mothers were like until her, and sometimes he tries to put his mum's face to these moments and imagine her doing the same too.
“You might be right, Mister Malfoy.” Pomfrey regarded him stoically, though the tightness around her eyes betrayed her.
"We need to talk. Alone," Draco says, solemn and ominous, his purposeful stride coming to a stop right in front of Harry. Ron and Hermione glance up at them in bemusement, curled up together on the couch of the Gryffindor commons. He reaches for Harry's arm, stops, and then lets his hand fall. "Just. Come with me, will you?"
Draco swallowed, his lips bitten to stop its involuntary twitching. He had to smother a flinch when Harry had spoken, the sound of his voice as surprising as it was vexing. Any notion of his remaining stoicism was out the window. He simply couldn’t muster the energy.
"It's okay," Harry says, not liking how upset Draco seemed. "I don't really care anymore. I mean, I stopped caring ages ago, really."
Potter's eyes softened, smile turning rueful, and he shook his head slightly. He made a gesture, a point downward.
His steps halted jarringly. His neck was hurting from how quickly it snapped towards the small shine in a forest full of fog, shadow, and decay.
“Something wholly dear to me." He looked right at Harry then. “Something that has always been important to me, right from the start. But it was a terrible secret, Potter. Kept it hidden because I’m a coward, you see. Couldn’t face it then, and I’m doing a terrible job of it now.”
Lovegood then gave him a book. Its cover was an attractive purple, so intense that Draco’s eyes winced at the brightness of it.
Goyle came over and tried to get him out of bed, persistent even as Draco groaned and mumbled at him to
He pulled up the mattress, showing Draco underneath, and there were hundreds of pictures, all of them a riot of colour and movement.
was Draco’s inspired opening, and now Granger’s features shifted from mystified to highly concerned.
“Twenty points from Slytherin, for being lackadaisical when in charge of such a volatile brew," Slughorn stated angrily, still casting his gaze up at the rafters like Draco, huffing.
One day, it stops being little more than an odd schoolboy crush, and it becomes something that keeps Harry's eyes locked on Draco whenever he passes, makes him stop with a quiet smile and pivot around on the balls of his feet to gaze after him, watching him as he walks down towards the end of the corridor, gesturing and talking with Pansy and Blaise.
Something impatient and frustrated reared its ugly head then. Something that, until then, Draco hadn’t let himself pay attention to these past weeks. But now, like an untreated wound, it had been festering and infecting him until it all but demanded to be examined.
"I'll go out with you, Potter." Draco nods. He clears his throat. The corners of his lips are twitching, but he seems to be trying to keep his face straight. "Well. On the condition that you take me somewhere fancy and expensive, of course."
“He was forever talking about you. Wherever you went, his eyes followed – especially in those last years. I think you did the same – I think...I think he had wanted to speak to you, tell you something. He had always kept his old wand under his pillow. Yours? He held it to his chest, even after he’d fallen asleep.”
"I won't beg," she said after a small breath, her tone pointedly even. "I will ask you to consider all of your options, but I will not ask you to change your mind."
Harry startled, his face pensive. But he flickered a smile, and it was terrible, like he was only trying to for him.
“They should weep blood for all that you have done for them,” Draco intoned slowly, his grip tightening on Potter’s hand.
Harry watched him in the dark, a minute pinch between his brows, mellow and rueful. His fingers were still at his wrist, soothing. In the grey of the rest of the world, he was the only thing in colour now. The thing that made him feel the most. The love of his life. His soul.
For a long moment, Harry can't get his voice out of his throat, Draco's smoke-grey gaze burning into him.
He wants to hold Harry after. Harry doesn't hold people or like being held much in the aftermath, but he does want to hold Draco, quite desperately in fact. It throbs beneath his skin and sternum, how much he does.
"No, I didn’t you thrice-damned—" Draco stopped himself when he saw Harry step out of a shadowy alcove to his right, his expression unhappy.
He smirks at Harry, and smiles at him, and jokes with him. He leans his grinning face into his own to see him laugh at them, and he always squeezes in beside him on the occasions they gather together with all their friends. Perhaps, at some point, they have all become somewhat friendly with one another; Pansy and Hermione, Blaise and Ron, Harry and Draco.
To his left, in the roots of a gnarled, rotted tree, his eyes caught on something that glinted in what little sunlight snuck through the canopy.
Yearning swam through him, just at the sound of his name. He wished Harry was really here, that he would come back. Maybe then he wouldn’t hurt so much.
might be somewhat magically taxing. And, if that was the price for having Harry here, even this raging version of him, Draco would take it, no questions asked.
Draco didn’t want to be treated; he didn’t want Pomfrey’s duty-bound interference. He would keep Harry, for as long as possible, even if it meant he’d have to die to do so. Harry was shaking his head slowly, Draco couldn’t make out the words that were spilling from Harry’s lips.
“Come here often?” Draco piped up, keeping his eyes overhead, and now his memory was veering off course into unknown territory.
“I have earned it. This and more," Draco stated, stoic in the face of Potter’s intense protest. “If we are speaking of what is deserved, and what is not, then look no further than yourself Potter.” Draco swallowed audibly. “You gave everything. You saved everyone – in my case on several occasions. A saviour in the truest sense, and yet none of us deserved to live. Not if the price was your life. Not when it meant someone like you dying.”
“Wait, you said yourself that your parents were busy with something else. And let them enjoy their last day of vacation”
“Hold on” He told Jordan as he walked to the wall. He sat his boyfriend on the ground and pulled on the shelves. They moved slightly but still moved. He pulled again until there was enough space for a body. He turned his head to Jordan who had fallen on the ground. The healing always left him a bit light-headed but the loss of blood made it worse.
“Dimi!” Shouted the little blond, running towards the taller one. Given Harry's appearance, Harry would not have thought he was receiving his son with a smile. He had a rather rebellious look to tell the truth. He had black jeans tucked in quickly in black rangers, a red and black plaid shirt open on a black tank top. And Harry was sure he would put on a leather jacket if he had to go out. Looking at him carefully, Harry saw a tattoo that seemed to travel on his host's body. Harry could never see the tattoo completely so he did not know what he meant.
“Are you telling me that your father is Severus?” Harry nearly choked on him as the child in his arms nodded vigorously.
Without his asking, Zach, Lyra and Dimitri also got up and came to supervise him, like bodyguards. They opened the doors to him and made the corridor clear for their passage. Draco found his eldest daughter really impressive by the power she gave off that made all the other students run away. Dimitri and Zachady each opened an infirmary door, letting Lyra and Draco pass, and then let them close. They placed themselves in front of them like guards. Draco sent Lyra to get the nurse while he laid Harry on one of the beds. He looked at the pale brown face and insulted Voldemort for it.
“Your buddy went crazy when Irina asked him why he didn’t kiss me this morning.” They all laughed as they imagined the scene. Harry and Hermione then advised him not to approach Ron while he calmed down.
Suddenly, Harry pulled off and rose to kiss him. Their tongues started a beautiful and familiar dance together and Harry hands gripped Draco tight before the beautiful man’s legs could slide to the ground. Draco felt the Gryffindor’s hands slide around to his arse and before he could even think of making an appreciating sound, Harry pulled him up his body. Draco legs wrapped tight around his waist as Harry began to suck the skin of his neck into his mouth. In the next moment, they were falling back onto a bed that Potter had conjured. Harry started to grind on top of him, a moan escaping his mouth again as their dicks rubbed hotly together, sending wonderful lust shocks down his spine. His cock was so hard now he thought that he for sure could come from a single touch from the boy on top of him. Potter took both of their dicks in his hand and started to move his fist up and down and GOD, this was becoming too much for Draco. His awareness of what was happening now was slowly fading away and soon all Draco could do was moan and whisper Potter's name with a voice cracking full of lust.
“I love my life, Potter” Draco muttered, tightening his arms around Harry. The latter more comfortably leaned his head against Draco's shoulder and fell asleep quickly.
“I understand, redhead and blond are not at all good together” Draco then intervened a few seconds after he had apparated. The girl opened her mouth in an outraged and vexed expression.
As for the children, the three girls had found a plan but refused to share it with Ezekiel, wishing the surprise to be maintained. The day of December 30th went like this.
“Real...” She couldn’t continue her sentence because Theodore had approached her and laid his lips on hers. She closed her eyes under the soft touch and when Theo moved away from her, she smiled and kissed him in turn. He wrapped his arms around her waist and hugged her.
“He only had sex with you” Blaise told. “That means a lot and there are not only things about sex, during the day he act like fool in love with you”
“It would be fun that I refuse, don’t you think?” Harry chuckled and Malfoy grabbed his hand, squeezing it tightly. Then the blond retrieved his hand and opened one of the doors of the double door of the room.
He started a long slow pace back and forth and the Slytherin was almost screaming. Harry's erection started to hurt him but he didn’t care. He suddenly accelerated. Harry looked up at the blonde and what he saw almost made him come in an instant. Draco's eyes were mostly closed and fogged with pleasure, his mouth was open, his cheeks rosy with desire and pleasure. As Harry continued, the Slytherin tried to make him go away, meaning that he would soon come.
“Are we going in or what?” Nathaniel asked, as if waiting from the beginning for Lucius to decide. They then set out for the Ministry of Magic. Harry vaguely wondered why Lucius had apparated them so far.
He was there with his hands feather-light at Draco's back during a wracking cough that had him rolling over, trembling, ribs seized tight to the point of hurting. He was there with his hands breezing through his hair when he woke up in the middle of the night, nauseated and aching in his joints, Harry's frown over him. He was there laying in front of him on the bed, face close, looking somewhere afar and lost in thoughts. Sometimes he was just watching Draco, with a brush over his hand, his green eyes sometimes slightly wide, and sometimes only tender, almost melancholic.
It had been both Granger and Weasley who had returned Draco’s hawthorn wand to him after the trails. The exchange was understandably reluctant on their parts.  Though, they both defended him at trial; they said that Draco hadn't given Harry away to the Dark Lord and had in fact released his wand to Harry. He had nearly crumpled when Weasley had said that Harry had asked them to help Draco if he couldn’t. It mystified them, still did.
Then there were hands on his throat, pushing down with such a sudden jerk that Draco had no air. They pushed harder, harder. Panicked, Draco thrashed, but then he felt hands hold his legs down.
But then after a couple of weeks of writing standard phrases, and something about escaping the Dursleys, it became interesting
Potter’s finger halted over a bruise, blooming just below the place where his crisp, ironed cuffs settled. In his peripheral vision, Draco could see that mess of black hair tilt upwards, and he knew that those green eyes were boring into his face.
Draco spent much of his Christmas holidays at home with Narcissa, decorating the tree together by hand with her as Christmas neared, and their house full of fairylights and decorations, walking out in the gardens with her. At some point, he asked about his father, if his portrait had spoken to her, and she couldn't answer beyond a small, shaky smile, a dart of a glance away. They had a drink in front of the fireplace as he told her about his life at school (excluding many details), everything he could think of, answered all of her questions.
Opening his eyes, blinking them as if to clear the black spots in his vision, his gaze caught on the ceiling above him; a boy sitting on the rafters, swinging his legs while looking down at Draco with a fond smile. He knew that face, but not the expression colouring it, the softness of it directed at him.
“He carried it everywhere with him in those last months.” Granger audibly swallowed against her grief. “We still never figured it out – but he must have. I wish...but I suppose life has its mysteries.” She seemed to speaking more to herself than anything. Still, Draco nodded sympathetically.
“He was beautiful. The best thing I’d ever seen. All the gold and gifts were nothing to me when he was in my eyeline, my dreams, my thoughts. And I wasted it. I scorned him for years, shoving it all down and pretending not to feel, to fit the mould I had cast myself in. I loved him, Mother. I loved him so much and I pretended not to — to him and myself. He is my soul. And now my soul is dead. It’s in a small graveyard in Godric’s Hollow, all alone and cold and—”
“I don’t think gratitude is a symptom, Ma’am," Draco said through clenched teeth and a now sweaty brow.
The next time he rose, his mother was there beside him. She was holding his hand, rubbing a thumb across his knuckles, looking distant in thoughts until she felt the stir of Draco's hand. His head was still stuffy and aching, his stomach still roiling with nausea.
“Fifth year...fifth year...Ah! Here.” Draco settled in with a poured cup of tea and toed his shoes off.
He and Ginny kissed for the first time on the Quidditch pitch, in front of thousands of people, the two of them high on the rush of victory. It was nice, wonderful, but it was still new and foreign, having another pair of lips on his. It was still new and foreign to have anything of anyone on him, for the most part.
We are pleased to inform you of your continued enrolment with Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Harry dropped the stirring rod he’d been holding, and it landed with a wet splash into the cauldron. Ron yelped at the brew that had just landed on his uniform.
He watched as Potter’s eyes continued to flick over everything, like one would an old photo album. There was a strange set of expressions he wore that repeated; what seemed like mischief, sometimes amusement, but then an awful sadness shone through in shuttered movements and tense shoulders.
Potter smiled, mouthing something at him that Draco wasn't able to read. He blinked bemusedly, shaking his head.
cute, mostly." Harry laughs, and Ginny grins at him, and it's good. Seeing her like this, being okay with her, being lighter. Ginny Weasley was his first love, and he will never forget her. She is beautiful, funny, caring and fierce, but she deserves someone like Luna Lovegood, someone who will know how to love her the way she should be.
He tried to not think about the fact that he’d just placed it on his wedding finger on instinct. Draco closed his eyes against the sensation of his gut clenching with the images he stomped down on. Things that could never happen, no matter how much his subconsciousness wished for it.
The light in the Quidditch locker room was buttery yellow. The light from the early morning sun made the steam from the shower seem hazy, unreal.
away from him like some frolicking field nymph, leaving Draco the kind of confused that normally necessitated a large knock to the head.
“What do you have to say for yourself, young man?!” Slughorn bellowed as his classmates picked themselves up off the floor, all in various states of disarray.
he must have received this as a gift. His fourteenth, when he was full of fire and burned too bright for Draco, who had tried to ignore the squirming in his belly every time Harry was near.. Draco thumbed the pages; it was filled with Harry’s handwriting cover to cover. A journal. Draco’s face bloomed a smile with the knowledge. He held something so precious in his hands, and it had been sitting here this entire time, ever since that awful day, waiting for him to pick it up.
He had felt that strange, inexplicably intense pull between them, that rise of a sense at the back of his neck whenever Harry was near, in the same room, all without having to look at him.
Harry was now stirring the potion carefully, counting to forty-five carefully and grumplily. But then there was whistling coming from behind him.
His panic caught up with him then, and he blacked out, just as Harry knelt down over him, his soft touch frantic and roaming.
Draco holds his hand, and when he releases it to push a hand through his own hair, continuing on to gesture in the midst of telling his story, he doesn't return it to hold his again the way he usually does.
“Oh, there isn’t much to see where I’m concerned, Potter.” Draco smiled tightly, swallowing with difficulty. “You were spot on, for the most part. You always were.”
“Draco, it’s okay!” Goyle shouted, his face awfully pale and sweaty. “The Profs’ are coming. Luna’s sent her
In the background, their song played on, that they would have always danced to in a life that went differently, and he listened to Harry whisper
Draco dipped his head slightly, breathing him in as if he could inhale Harry and keep him inside. Harry stilled, head lifting to meet Draco’s eyes, now only scant inches between them. Slowly, their hands met.
Pushing on the door like a dead man walking, Harry tried to keep his back straight and his shoulders back, even though he wanted to crawl into the class – that way Snape might not see him.
Instead, Draco followed after some strange urge to look through the book, carefully turning the next page, past the contents and the introduction and onto the first chapter. The pages were worn, as if thoroughly read. This had been Potter's favourite class, particularly in Third Year with Professor Lupin teaching them.
He didn’t look. Not when Harry was this close, warm and breathing and alive, when he was wholly focused on Draco.
Green eyes and the flash of a toothy grin – and Draco’s eyes betrayed him, the scene vanishing once more.
Draco moved to stand, to follow the set of footsteps that seemed to walk out from under the chair he was sitting in. But as he rose, pain spiked through his chest, like a sharp pick on ice. However, this time it did not cease. In fact, it built until Draco’s vision was pulsing with it.
The image of his own blood on his pale skin, splattered on white sheets, reminded Draco of how close he was to death, and how strange it was to not be frightened by it.
It was beaming compared to everything else in the room – which now looked terribly dull and a little bluish to Draco. It was like Potter’s Defence book in the library all over again, and despite himself, Draco couldn’t tear his eyes away from it.
Draco's throat convulsed. He blinked hard and fast at the burn in his eyes, trying to rise above the leaden weight of his heart. He placed his hand in Harry's and let him pull him to his feet, their hands tangled at their shoulder level.
Gasping on the floor, curling into himself, Draco didn’t hear the two boys move around him. He felt one of them pull on his hair, dragging him up and around. Then he felt a body on top of him, and Draco’s groans stopped, his eyes widening.
“I don’t know about that – I like to read the last page sometimes," Draco humoured her, whilst scrambling on the inside.
Draco’s stomach clenched at the thought. He suddenly hoped that this Harry was not real, that he had in actual fact passed on peacefully into the arms of his loved ones. It would be the worst fate; standing, watching the world mourn you, only to move on and forget you entirely.
It's only the day after their third date, when they know that it seems to be going well, that they tell all their friends.
“That does sound tragic, Madam Pomfrey. My condolences to the victims and their loved ones," Draco said carefully. As he did, he also gave his answer to the issue Pomfrey was tiptoeing around.
With a silent whimper, Draco folded his arms on the table and slumped down into them. He sat trying to breathe through it, trying to form a shout to call for help. Neither worked. A hot wetness streamed from Draco’s nose. Instinctually, he wiped at it, only for his hand to come away a deep, dark red before a coppery tang filled his mouth.
When his mother opened it and saw him, she smiled. She remained graceful and composed, but her joy reflected in the brightness of her eyes, and she stepped forward, kissing his cheek in greeting. But when she drew back, her face pulled into a frown.
It was a shrine of sorts. Hundreds of small notes and pictures of Harry with others had been stuck to the locker door and the floor directly beneath it. There was a palpable protection charm encasing it, as if many had been layered upon each other to keep the items safe from prying hands and the humid air in the showers.
Then Harry moved towards him. Draco felt a cool brush of his lips against the corner of his mouth. His eyes fluttered shut as a traitorous tear dropped from his lash.
Harry was mouthing words, slowly, and Draco swore he could feel the bass of the growl which would have sounded otherwise.
Draco lifts an eyebrow. "Pardon? What does that mean?" He blinks, confusion furrowing his forehead and scrunching his nose. "Are you telling me that for eleven years, nobody…?"
Draco pins him with a disappointed look, and then stretches his arm out to show him the book, shifting closer to him. "I'll revise the first half with you, then. I'll explain it to you and then we'll continue from where I left off."
Something Draco had always tried to smother reared its head then; a teenage crush, an infatuation, an obsession, a need, a want, a wish, a pipe dream, something he could never even
Not to say she wasn't loving enough when they were together. She was. She just expressed love through other means, like through words, through gifts that reminded her of him, through comfort and reassurance and support, through yelling at the lunatics at school that tried to slip him love potions (she still does this), and sometimes, she held his hand and put her auburn hair to his shoulder and kissed him in front of all their friends.
Draco slowly took out his own chain, on which the dark stone that had been tied to Harry’s diary hung. The stone on his chest moved against his clavicle. No matter how warm his skin was against it, it was always frozen.
Harry, it seemed, could do nothing either, except watch with a somewhat horrified expression. Draco’s rather unhelpful mind offered that the experience was somewhat lacking a certain
Draco had gone to ask Madam Pomfrey about the spell Harry had cast. It was the same spell Harry’s own mother had used to save him. She said Harry must have known Draco might die after Harry passed away.
Even the sight of blonde curls and offensively bright pink sunglasses weren't enough to calm him. Even people who Draco had thought safe turned out to be somewhat hostile when it came to him.
Draco’s expression was unreadable, until his eyes flicked over Harry’s face before his brow furrowed, like he knew what Harry was feeling.
He ran, all gangly limbs and terror, back into the light of the corridor, back to people, safety. Draco landed rather than ran into the corridor, one that after gasping in a crumpled heap, he realised was blessedly empty. No one saw his embarrassing brush with insanity. He laughed at himself, weakly.
Draco shrugged. His mother was somewhat like that; Narcissa could become quite wrathful if an ending was revealed to her before she’d had the chance to discover it for herself. His father had taken great delight in ruining a book as soon as she happened to be on the last chapter.
His father then regarded him, but didn’t say anything, just looked at where Draco’s hand rested on his chest. Lucius left the frame, and Draco thought he was going upstairs, to follow the love of his life, his soul, too.
Draco turned, bouncing on the balls of his feet slightly. The pain potion invigorated him and gave him the sensation of being lighter than air all at the same time.
"Harry." His name came out an exhausted breath. Draco shook his head. "I don't want to." His jaw tightened, a knot of muscle shifting, jumping with the convulsion of his throat. He opened his eyes, saw green, dimmed in the dark.  "I won't lose this. Lose you."
He looked at Potter again, terrified that the past few months of jeers, shoves, hexes, spittle, and strikes showed in his features. He was terrified Potter could see it.
Draco heard a thump in the aisle beside him and then a swish of a silken cloak. Potter was only a foot away from him, standing, breathing.
took him away from me, just like he did with everything else.” Draco gestured to the room around him.
There were a few muttered grumbles of agreement before Draco hightailed it out of the class. His chest was now sore, and he rubbed at it, telling himself to calm down.
Granger left shortly after that, her stance more at ease than it had been before she’d arrived, and it made Draco smile.
Draco’s mind was flooded with memories from his third year upon seeing it. It brought a quick smile to his lips. The book felt warm in his hand, and an odd sensation prickled under his skin. It must have been a spare left by one of the students. Draco had found out that the library, somewhat sentient, had a ‘finders-keepers’ policy with misplaced books. Some unlucky sod had also received the same lesson.
It was not the answer Draco had expected, nor the one he had wanted, and it deflated him. But in the knowledge that he was now speaking to a figment of his own imagination, a shaky bravery reared its head. For the first time since hearing that voice, the voice he’d forgotten, Draco found he could meet this Harry's eyes.
Finding Harry’s dorm was just as breezy as breaking and entering into the lion’s nest. It was mid-morning, and all of Hogwarts’ was in class at the moment, bored out of their minds, and highly unlikely to catch Draco in the act. He was currently dodging Defence, and happily so. He hated the stares he got in that class, the wayward looks at his left arm he received when the new Professor levelled pointed, weighted looks at Draco every time the term
and a grip of a gossamer hand around his hand, guiding it towards his own chest where the resurrection stone was.
Romance hasn't seemed to be in the cards for him anytime soon after Ginny. He gets what he needs during sex, anyway. It's not really enough, but it fills the hollow inside of him somewhat, this odd hunger roiling beneath his skin that he doesn't know if he'll ever get rid of. He's good at going after what he wants and taking it, knows how to demand and hold his ground until they're given to him, but the things he has to ask for, he has never known how to just ask for them.
Harry runs one hand across the gentle rise and fall of his back, tentative, until they're around his waist, clutching at him. It takes time before his body relaxes under him, until his muscles stop quivering, but when it does, it's incredible and warm. Draco's torso is rising and falling against his rapidly racing heart, his breaths a clear, steady current in his ears and against his skin, something calmed and contented under his skin and flesh. He closes his eyes and breathes him in, shallow and shuddering and unsteady.
He lowered himself into an armchair by the fire, turned up his record player and tried to focus on the song to keep his mind off of such thoughts.
Harry’s eyes widened with the thought, and then he made a mess by trying to look suddenly very busy – in doing so he made his inkwell knock over, and the scales clatter.
"Yeah." Harry clears his throat. "The closest they could stand getting to me was to whack me with a frying pan, or to grab me by the collar. Or sit on me, in my cousin's case."
Harry can't quite explain the aching roil in his chest. He's painfully aware of Draco behind him, so close, and yet so far.
“Prick’s not getting the message, is he Keith?” Greets said conversationally. “Think he needs a firm hand?"
"I love you too," Harry mumbled back into his shoulder, held him carefully and close like he was precious. "I've been wanting to say that for so long." His voice croaked.
He walked up to them, to where the prints almost pointed like an arrow. Standing in front of the pale red doors, he squinted to read the names written. Following the footprints further led him to a set of lockers hidden in shadow.
“Not much to live for," Draco found himself saying, almost absently. “Not anymore.” He was staring at where their hands were meeting, heated and trembling.
Narcissa regarded him, frustrated and concerned in the same moment. Draco hadn’t been well, but he had also not felt this low in months. There was recognition in Narcissa’s eyes, which had just glanced at a massive timepiece that stood tall in the foyer – one that stated the time and date.
“...Tiredness?” he offered, trying not to look as if he is hiding something from a very keen-eyed witch.
Draco draws back, a short scowl crossing his face before his face goes flat. "You do know it doesn't work like that."
Harry stood with his hands in his jean pockets. He looked around at the footprints, his eyes roaming, until they finally landed where Draco had rolled up his own sleeve. Harry nodded slowly, biting his lip. Worry marred his features, and anxiety left him in droves. He stared at Draco’s arm where
“Mute.” Draco snorted humourlessly. “Now, when you’ve decided to haunt me? When I actually want you to speak.” He tried for a glare, but his lip was trembling, and he had to bite it before that welling sensation behind his eyes overtook him. “Ah, but of course.”
Burns went lame, and was then jerked away from Draco. The air rushed in, and it was painful, unwanted.
A drip on the floor caught his attention before that dark thing shifted in his peripheral again. And now he knew it was right in front of him, some mere feet away.
“Your magic has been...waning Mr Malfoy.” Pomfrey began, the sombre edge to her tone made Draco turn to stare at her and a cold sensation creep up his throat.
"You. Just... you feel nice," Harry mumbles, his lips buried into the soft material covering his shoulder. "And maybe I'm sort of thinking about kissing you."
Listlessly, Draco turned his head to the stranger beside him, whose bed Draco was currently laying in. Pale hazel eyes stared back at him, full of hope, playful. They would have been worth staying for, so beautiful they were, if they hadn't been the wrong shade.
Ron and Hermione hold hands when they sit in front of the fireplace on the couch, her bushy-haired head in a book, Ron dozing off next to her, or playing chess with Harry. Luna curls up against Ginny as she murmurs to her about the articles planned by her father for the Quibbler, or her new discoveries and the creatures she wants to find, and Ginny tugs her girlfriend up against walls in the corridors sometimes and kisses her. Seamus and Dean peck each other on the lips every so often and pull one another against themselves with a comfort and ease that's as natural as breathing.
Harry’s tanned hand was pulling at Draco gently, before showing him his dorm room, his garish red bed.
He was numb through it all, his heart dull, sluggish. His mind felt like sand slipping through desperate fingers, listening as Granger gave the eulogy, her eyes ringed with scarlet grief. Her face was set and composed. She looked strong, despite the way her body was so rigid—brittle in a way that seemed as if it wanted to crumble in on itself, but she wouldn't let it.
As he walked, he saw Harry in his footsteps. In front of him was an alcove that he often saw Harry and Weasley muck about in, playing cards or chatting. He walked past a classroom that Draco remembered Harry running into during those last moments in the war, one of the last times he saw Harry alive. He climbed up and up, seeing Harry in the shadows and small spaces, until he happened on a hidden room, nestled in the belly of the seventh floor.
She graciously didn't ask him how he was feeling. He supposed it was all there in his face anyway. She then looked down at her own hand, the one not gripping his hand. It was closed around something, a silver of white visible through her fingers. Her throat convulsed.
But then he steps away from him, inexplicably, and Harry wonders if he's noticed the strain in his smile and the stiffness of his response,
Harry rolled up his sleeve, baring it. Draco still didn’t look, didn’t need to look. He knew the mark inside and out, how it would withe limply without its master, the greyish pallor of it where once it had been so dark it looked like you could sink your fingers into it.
Draco nodded, then held it out for her to inspect. He was nervous now. Granger had clearly seen this item before, and her expression upon seeing it made him tense.
“Ah, Draco — just the beastie I’ve been looking for.” Lovegood was not even a little winded from her brisk climb up one of the highest towers in Hogwarts.
Draco’s mind then seemed to grasp the seriousness of his circumstances and then ran wild. Had he been cursed? Hexed? He tried to think back to the last thing he ate and then realised he hadn’t in quite some time. Did he drink one too many Calming Draughts? Draco hadn’t thought so
Flickers of things that didn’t make sense rose and rose within him. Like water running through his hand, Harry tried to capture these tiny notions, thoughts, and feelings that felt old and at the same time terribly unknown to him.
"I found something," Narcissa said. "Whilst I was going through the storage room." Her eyes were still on her hand, the slow opening of her fingers, revealing a black gem. For a moment, he only stared at it as if he didn't know what to do with it. His fingers trembled, reaching for it.
Dating Draco Malfoy, Harry thinks, will mean being at arms length outside of sex. No unnecessary physical contact or displays of affection. He wants him anyway, inexplicably. Perhaps that is exactly the kind of person he should be with, someone who will never need Harry to kiss him first, because Harry doesn't think he'll ever be that person.
Draco mouthed, his gasps rasping as tears flowed down to the blood on the desk. His hands then searched for Harry’s form, to touch it, to grasp it. But his fingers met only cooler air and a slight buzzing sensation under his nails.
Draco could have died and the world would have looked at his carcass, poked at it a bit, before turning away disgusted. His body wouldn’t have even cooled before they had said
Draco's gaze had strayed over her shoulder, to the centre of the vast drawing room. The rug. He could see prints there. He could see his prints everywhere, under the chandelier. Off to the side. The exact spot when he'd apparated away. His breaths slowed, evening out some, lost in a memory.
He’d had to smother it; the day he got his mark was the day thoughts of the boy with green eyes were thrown away because it was too dangerous, it was not for him. It would
There was a brush over his hand, and Draco looked over to find Harry beside him. And the tightness in his chest eased.
"…After your partner sets the quartz in place – exactly in the centre of the cauldron – you will stir around it, clockwise for forty-five turns. Oh, look, there is that number again, Mr Potter…"
Draco was stuck on the floor, right outside Snape’s old quarters. He’d just finished Potions, and had been wandering –
Potions went well. He got down some of the instructions. He stopped writing half-way through Charms, when his headache built higher and deeper against his skull. His nose bled again, all over his textbook cover this time. He dabbed at his face with a handkerchief.
The hand that was holding onto his wrist tightened, and another arm reached around him slowly, gently. Malfoy then hummed it, the song that Harry’s mind was stuck on. They swayed together to it, their bodies close, pushing into one another’s embrace, as if they wanted to suffocate with it.
“I’d rather they didn’t mourn at all – I didn’t live to cause tears,” Harry said in a playful tone, as if Draco was in on a secret joke.
Pomfrey was fidgeting, tapping her wand off her thigh, and it struck Draco as one of the oddest things he’d ever witnessed. Pomfrey was economic in everything she did; every movement and every breath were exacted purposefully and with the least fuss. So, to see her exhibit such a nervous tick made Draco
And now, Draco looked up to the overhead racks where he could now see a shoelace floating mid-air, unattached to anything. He shook his head violently, trying to shift the notion of
She then unholstered her wand and made a quelling motion before pointing at his stomach, which Draco had protected with his wand arm.
," Draco mutters in disgust, climbing over towards Harry. "The things I put up with for you, Potter."
Draco wraps his arm around his waist and Harry goes still, and Draco doesn't notice. Whenever they sit amongst their friends in the common room, Draco sits against him, half of his back against his chest and a hand on Harry's thigh, and Harry goes still and Draco doesn't notice. When he runs up and falls into step with Harry as they're walking to class, he slides his lithe fingers into the spaces between his own as he starts on his rant about whatever, and Harry goes still, as still as he can while walking, and Draco doesn't notice. He doesn't notice for quite a time and Harry is very much okay with that.
"I can see the exact place he stood. When they threw him here? When he jumped out of the way of the chandelier falling over him and his friends? I thought he was going to die here." His gaze tore away from the footprint, onto another one. He licked his lips, dry and cracked. "I thought it would be my fault if they…"
, Harry's lips shaped, and then he pressed the tips of Draco's fingers back with his own, sliding into the spaces in between. Near-solid. Chilling.
"It's not that…" It comes out too quiet and raspy. He clears his throat, forcing his voice to be stronger. "I don't
There's so much silence. Harry glances up, finally, meeting his moonstone eyes. Draco's still staring at him, but now he looks lost and angry, a line between his brows, his jaw clenched.
He rubbed at the tender flesh of his belly where, earlier in the week, McLaggen and Co. decided to take turns trying to cave his internal organs. And they hadn’t needed an occasion to justify it then.
When they settled down, they were still smiling at one another, and Harry was watching them with a wide grin.
“Great!” Harry exclaimed without asking for more. And while Draco was still staring at his mother and a sweet smile was sitting on his lips, Harry hugged his waist and rested his head on his shoulder. He pulled the tip of his tongue out of his mouth and licked his earlobe. The blond closed his eyes and moaned at this contact. Harry slid his hand under the table and put pressure on the blonde's resting dick. The latter squeaked and he opened his eyes blushing. Harry nibbled the lobe of his ear and Draco moaned as he closed his eyes. He opened his eyes and blushed even more as he fell into his mother's eyes.
Draco was staring outside the window in his room at Malfoy manor. It was beautiful outside with all the flowers, really. His window was just above his mother’s garden, giving him a full view of its magnificence. It was full of colors. Red, purple, blue and yellow standing together in perfect harmony. In his opinion, her garden was the only thing that wasn’t tainted by a memory of the Dark Lord in this damn house.
“At your service!” Harry shouted, saluting. Draco chuckled and he noticed that Harry and his daughter had exactly the same posture on their brooms, this girl had to be an excellent seeker.
"I don’t trust and I don’t want to have anything to do with those dirty snakes” he replied disgustedly. It was Harry's turn to sigh.
“Oh please” A voice snorted from the corridor before he could answer. “He just don’t wanna go where Potter is” The voice finished when he walked in the room. It was Blaise, Draco noticed with a groan of frustration. “In case he can’t restrain himself and jumps on him, you know” He finished, a charming smile and a wink in direction of his mother.
“Oh sorry” Harry whispered quickly. The other boy mumbled something about gryffindors too early in the morning. Harry laughed slightly before coming out of the room. He closed the door and crossed the second room again and found himself again near the little blond. He picked him up again and went down the stairs. The brunette was only half astonished to find his best friend sitting at a table near the library. He approached, put Lesath on a chair and sat down at the table. Hermione looked up from her book and smiled at Harry.
Harry’s frown deepened before he backed away from Draco by a few steps. Draco stepped forward, worried about the expression that crossed Harry's features.
, his lips moved around his name, a soft murmur. There was only so much a ghost of a boy could do about somebody else's life, Draco supposed, touching the corner of Harry's mouth with a thumb, a rueful twist at his own. Draco could feel him now, even if the sensations were faded.
“Well...except for recently," Draco added as he worried his tremulous lip and chanced a glance at Harry, whose small frown softened. “And only because you
“Though, as concerning as your silence is, it’s moot if we humour the possibility that I’ve finally cracked.” Draco exhaled harshly. “I mean,
With an audible swallow, he pushed those morbid thoughts away and dived wholeheartedly into the distraction Harry’s diary promised him. It was an easy trade off; ignoring his own petering existence to luxuriate in the burning flash of Harry’s.
Harry smiles, a small breath of it. Draco's hand is warm and soft, more comfortable and fitting in his own these days. "Yeah. Yeah, she'll allow anyone in when she's asleep, as long as you say the right password."
when the light finally stopped stabbing his eyelids. If Draco were so inclined, he might have kissed her feet.
He follows Draco over into the empty boys' dormitory, heart pounding wildly in his chest. Draco closes the door with a click when Harry enters after him, turns around and crosses his arms over his chest.
The sun is golden as the skies begins to set into nightfall, swathing the whole of the world in golden as well. Harry glances at Draco, the haze of evening lights catching in the grey of his eyes, thinks about kissing him, or asking Draco to kiss him. So he does.
After glaring at a small first year Slytherin who had caught him in the act, Draco’s eye caught on a glint of gold. The flash was so bright, he could see its afterimage burned into his sight, casting blue-green flashes in his vision. Blinking it away, Draco tried to zone in on where the flash came from. He was somewhat concerned that the flash might have been a spell, instead of something more benign.
Draco stops, turning his torso around to look at him with an inquisitive raise of his brows, hands in the pockets of his long coat.
"It lets you bring back the dead, I think. He figured it out just before we last—" Granger cut herself off with a deep swallow, as if fighting off an awful emotion.
The memory came back to him over and over, but now with new and fresh understandings of that moment. Draco remembered him, a small and still body in Hagrid's arms. He remembered the soul-cutting pain he'd felt, seeing him in that way
She reaches into her collar, pulling out an unsightly necklace made of very large, irregular objects repeating on a string.
A moment after, Draco's bare and warm torso is all over his own, his mouth resting on his shoulder. His chest is a cadenced rise and fall against his own, limbs wrapped around him through his underarms. Harry breathes the skin of the hollow of his neck in, the scent of him and his cologne settling something raw and hungry in him. He folds his arms around him and holds him close, and wonders like always if Draco can feel his heart fluttering rapidly through his sternum.
Suddenly, Draco didn't feel comfortable reading it without Harry’s permission. But Draco was always an instant gratification sort of person, and he’d rather apologise than ask permission. He wouldn’t tell a soul what he’d read. He knew he’d hold Harry’s secrets to the grave.
“Very often, people who are grieving are reminded that those who have passed away wouldn’t want to see them suffer," Harry said as his thumb rubbed against the inside of Draco’s wrist.
Harry lifted Draco’s arm until his forehead rested where the mark lay. Draco could do little except watch, transfixed. The grip on Draco’s arm was tight; he could feel Harry's nails bite into his wrist. Draco found himself accepting the sharpness of it as a comfort.
The Eighth Year Common Room was a rather grey and vacant place these days. People didn't quite see the point of returning to a school that was haunted by phantoms of the dead, it seemed.
Then his fingers found a piece of parchment at the back of the journal. He pulled at it until it loosened. Placing the journal down in his lap carefully, he then unfolded the parchment. He hoped for another silly drawing or doodle, as young Harry was partial to. But instead, there was a letter.
As he drank in his surroundings, his eye caught on a book which was jutting out slightly on the same shelf. The book was a strange vivid red, and the white-gold embossed on it shone a little too bright for it to be anything but an illusion.
There was a pain in his chest that wouldn’t go away, steadily building with each thump of his heart. It might be his heart; Draco thought briefly before pushing the thought away. He always was a coward, afraid to confront important things.
"I…" Harry's voice has gone hoarse, his focus narrowing down to the heat of Draco's skin against his hands,the way he fits against his fingers, the grip of his legs around him. He's touched him everywhere he could ever, but there is something different about this, here and now. He wants too much, but he has never known how to ask, and nobody has ever asked him like this. Nobody has ever touched him the way Draco does, freely, openly, without limit or restraint.
all of them kick-offs and landings from Quidditch. He trailed them back up to the castle whilst completely dismissing his wheezing.
“No," he said quickly, although his mind thought seeing a dead boy nigh on constantly might have been a cause for concern. But even if it was a delusion, a sickness of the mind, Draco would rather keep it than be cured of it. The notion of being without these visions made Draco feel cold and panicked. “Well, chest pain, maybe.”
He couldn't say he didn't entirely understand why they were angry. Draco was too; at himself, the Dark Lord. At his father.
“Not for long, Death Eater.” Another voice hissed above him. It was Keith Burns, a Gryffindor from his year, one that Draco hadn’t in all honesty noticed before this year. But now Draco knew Keith well, very well, his vicious streak in particular. Keith, out of all of them, was the one that made Draco feel nervous the most.
Draco's chest ache was aggravated by the time the final class of the day rolled around and made it difficult to focus. He was relieved when the bell rang and he was able to go see Madam Pomfrey, Goyle following at his side.
Harry spent over a year loving Ginny and he never learned how to just reach his hand out and take hers in his own, or pull her back against his chest with an arm around her, or kiss her first.
Then, there were other passages, several that Draco would have given his left arm to read when Harry was alive.
He woke up knowing Potter should have grown another year older, and the fact that he hadn’t — that he never would — caused Draco’s stomach to turn violently. Images of Potter, the few he’d rather not have witnessed, swirled in his mind as he stared unseeingly up at the canopy.
“You’re living without him now, aren’t you?’ Greg said, and it hurt Draco to see the fear and pain he was causing.
"We can both see better like this," Harry murmurs. Draco's back melds easily into his torso, his body sprawled out across the settee between Harry's legs, knees folded up where he's propped his book against them. "And it's more comfortable."
Draco heaves a put-upon sigh. "You may share my textbook," he says, opening his book and flipping to
“I – I…Yes," Draco garbled out. Then the clock on the wall ticked for a few beats before Draco could speak around the lump in his throat. “Are you real?”
"You don't have to ask." Harry laughs. He sounds so formal. It's endearing, sweet even. "You just have to let me get used to it."
He makes polite small talk with Hermione regarding homework, and with Luna on her nargles and her other weirdly named creatures, and he banters with Ron in a way that's amusing rather than angering.
He nodded at Lovegood, resigned to the fact she’d either hurt him or heal him. He was past caring then.
He could not stop crying, could not stop repeating the name of the boy that stood at his back, quietly crying too.
By the next second, Draco is rolling over and onto him, one leg thrown on the other side of his waist, and he's pulling at and unbuttoning his shirt.
Draco looked down at the fields below. It was a mess of too-green splotches surrounded by greyish turf. It was as if Harry’s footprints had soaked up all of the colour surrounding them – as if they needed to be seen, to be noticed, to be followed.
“I’m there," Harry said softly, just above a whisper. “I’m in here too.” He gestured to the carriage around them, and his smile was so gentle and understanding, and Draco hurt all the more because of it. “I’ll be there until it ends.”
After skimming through the book, and carefully sliding the notes back into the crease of where the pages met the book spine, Draco flipped back to the first pages. He noticed that there was no library card inside, which was odd. Draco then, as if possessed, took the book to Madam Pince.
Lovegood reached for his buttons and opened them with a soft frown. After motioning for him to lean back and splaying a hand on his abdomen, Draco felt the warm breeze indicative of a deep tissue healing spell.
"Mr Potter," Snape's voice drawled before Harry had even cleared the entrance. The man had clearly been waiting. "What time do you call this?"
Draco flinched as Harry raised his hand quickly, and then sat somewhat stunned when he felt the rough pad of his fingers trace the cut on Draco’s forehead.
The whole lesson, Draco was restless and distracted, which was probably why he found himself nigh on stalking Granger once the lesson had finished. It was also why now Draco had just tapped Granger’s shoulder and was flailing under her rightfully confused gaze.
His mother stilled, her face fallen. She reached for his arm, but he shook it away. "Why do you not? You've seemed so — so ill and tired this entire time you've been here, darling. And the fatigue? The sudden headaches?" She tried to get him to look at her. "Draco, I am concerned. So if not for yourself, do it for me."
On another day, Harry finally gains the courage to do something else that he's been thinking about doing for ages.
Because these were the things he would never share with Harry. These were the things in some form or another that he’d secretly wanted over the years; Harry's attention, his touch, and a place in his life, at his side.
Burns threw a brutal fist at his face, and Draco gasped, but it came out in an awful wretch before Burns continued to suffocate him.
There was too much inside of him; the sickness, the wayward stares, the hushed voices, the violent shoves, and cruel hexes to his back. He thought to himself,
Draco's head snapped to his mother, the movement jostling him enough to crack a sharp cough from him.
"You want me to get Madam Pomfrey?" Goyle asked, very quietly, in the end. He did that these days sometimes, acted like Draco was fragile, about to keel over with just a bit of a push.
He didn't notice it at first. He didn't notice it at all, in fact, through his trip down to the library, planning on continuing his studying for the Transfiguration test tomorrow there.
"Excellent," Draco says. Harry's shirt is fully opened from the front, and he's tugging it off of his arms. "Neither am I."
Half-way through Transfiguration, he dropped his quill, gripped his head, and he couldn't move at all. The pain was taut all throughout his head, behind his eyes, down his face and jaw. It
“Well, it seems that you are back with us," she stated in a clipped tone, each harsh consonant grating on Draco’s molars.
“There was so much to you, wasn’t there?” Draco breathed. His face crumpled. “But I didn’t get to see any of it.”
Of course Harry found it." Draco laughed to himself. "Fights off a dragon, a sphinx, a Dark Lord, and becomes the Master of Death.
He stilled immediately after he uttered it, releasing the utter truth of the statement he hadn’t meant to voice. Draco looked down at the train carpet, where his left foot was tapping nervously. He could sense Harry's malaise and he wanted to shy away from it or banish it entirely.
Goyle got him a painkiller potion from Madame Pomfrey, settled down beside him and flipped through a magazine. It made him drowsy after a quarter of an hour, and he fell asleep on the settee, hands loosening around his Transfiguration textbook. When he woke up around evening, the pain had receded almost completely. Goyle wasn't there.
When the smoke had cleared, and Potter laid still and hollow-eyed in the debri, Voldemort's body a mere haze in the face of the other's in his mind, Draco had felt a horror and agony so inexplicably deep and cutting that he might as well have stopped breathing right then and there with him, tears burning up his throat and into his eyes. He could not explain the reason for such anguish, radiating right down to his very soul, for someone that he hadn't had a civil conversation with since they were eleven.
Slowly, he looked up and halted his steps. There was a boy standing in front of him, wild-haired and round glasses, his eyes fixated on Draco's face, and he looked painfully young, unmistakably solid and real. Draco wanted to reach out, but he was afraid he'd vanish into a mist like he did the last time. He stood rooted where he was, instead, whitened fingers clenched tight and quivering around the tucked edge of his towel.
kissing his shoulder, stroking his hair, and then, quieting into it. Draco just held him with all the little strength he had, swaying along to the gentle little rocking motions.
"I want a living room full of our friends, happy and warm. I want tea in bed. I want to fight over the duvet. I want to wake up in the morning and realise that none of it was ever a dream and that I have the love of my life, and that I have him forever."
Potter looked him up and down, a slow smile blooming on his features. He moved closer. Draco was rooted to the floor as he watched Harry’s soundless steps nearing him.
He swallowed, his heart throbbing slow and erratic in his throat. "Yeah. Well. You saved me too. So, I suppose that makes us somewhat even."
Greg was quiet for a while, and then looked up at him. "After Crabbe? I'm done losing people. I haven't got a lot of friends, you know. I can't lose the only other one. But if you are, you know… if something really is going on, I'd rather know now than…"
Draco remembered a slightly older reflection of Harry, staring at him helplessly as Draco bled out surrounded by animate books, and inanimate onlookers. There was sadness as Potter stared at the cut and then back to Draco’s bewildered, too-wide eyes.
Potter cocked his head at Draco’s stuttered question, mirthful at first, but then an odd disquiet settled over his features. It was when the downturned smile quirked at the corners of his lips that Draco knew the boy before him couldn’t answer.
He felt like he could do everything, could finally say anything. But he felt so stunned by it all that it rendered him deathly still and silent.
Draco’s mind conjured soft echoes of sound; a laugh in the Great Hall, a groan in Potions, that whoop of pure joy that had echoed out to Draco in Care of Magical Creatures, sparking an awful jealousy in him.
Draco closed the book when he noted how dark it had become. He walked almost blindly towards the warm light of Hogwarts, lost in thought.
“I don’t give one whit what they say about our family, Draco. I do care how these gossipmongers may hurt you, and with something so personal—” Narcissa seemed to cut herself off.
By the time he had found an appropriate alleyway to Apparate from, somewhat limping up the few flights from the Manor’s foyer to his room, Draco felt the first foreboding waves of hangover-induced nausea.
Harry likes sex, and he'd gotten good at it with her too. He knew what she liked, where she liked his hands best and how she liked his mouth on her, but he thinks part of it had always been to get to all the other things, like clinging to her body and feeling her all over him, like sliding his hands up her arms and taking her hands in his own, like the feel of her hands in his hair encouraging him to keep going when he went down on her.
There were other dreams that broke the monotony of horror and humiliation. In those, Harry loved him. Draco could touch him,
Harry handed him a picture, and Draco took it with an amused, confused smile. In it, there was a stick figure drawing of a boy with brown hair, glasses and a thick lightning bolt scar, holding hands with a stick figure sporting a mop of bright yellow hair.
Harry was then looking down at Draco’s arms, his left one specifically. Draco shivered when he felt Harry's hand slowly encase the very same forearm Draco hadn’t deigned to look at for months now, lest he attempt to slice it off.
Draco licked his lips before baring his teeth to the air. A kind of rage dazed him. Everything shrank away except for the overwhelming sensation of unfairness, of losing something before he had it. He could scream, break something. He wanted to.
Harry tried to keep focused, really, he did. But then whispers sounded from his left; deep, rich consonants and vowels wrapped around sharp, exacting consonants. And, despite himself, Harry found himself wholly drawn to the sound. It felt like a bodily need, as blinking or breathing did.
He always knew it was Harry near him in those moments. He knew it in his bones. And his staring, he could never stop. But Draco dismissed both because of his feelings, being over-sensitised and overly obsessed with the object of his reluctant affection.
Harry then attempted to take Draco’s hands, before visibly growing frustrated that he couldn’t. Draco humoured him and held up his arms, which Harry’s transparent hands brushed through. It caused Draco to shiver a little when he felt the coolness of Harry’s touch deep in his forearms.
touching Harry kindly or having felt his skin under his fingers. This knowledge was unlike any other pain, even if he had Harry’s ghost all to himself now.
Harry shook his head glibly, thankful his friend was unknowingly acting as a physical shield between Harry and a pair of all too observant eyes. He clung to Ron’s small talk like a life raft in the middle of stormy seas.
Draco stood, silent and stunned. However, a small part of him had known this already. He knew that he couldn’t be so lucky as to have Harry without anything going horribly wrong in the process. True, uninhibited joy was not without sacrifice. It never had been for him.
Then Draco noticed his classmates, their furious hissing and glares, all of it directed at him, like house points mattered at all in the grand scheme of things. His stomach dropped and his hands suddenly shook.
you were the one that asked me out. I assumed you were well aware of my history, of who I was, of how people may feel about seeing us together, and you still made that decision despite it. If you'd only realized that you were embarrassed to be seen with me
And there was Harry. Always Harry, sitting beside him with his hand to his back whenever his headache flared, walking alongside him wherever he went. Sometimes Draco looked at him, and Harry smiled at him, a crooked little thing on the faded pink of his lips, and the despair and weariness of being perpetually ill eased just so.
Ginny, though, is still the kind of person that likes her personal space, which made a lot of sense when she explained what it was like living in a house of nine people. She had loved him and he knows this, but physical affection never came too naturally to her, especially not in public, and who was Harry to complain when he'd never even kissed her first?
Seeing nothing after a while, he shrugged it off. He had completely forgotten about it until Charms. After completely misspelling his own name attempting to make a piece of chalk write across slate, Draco caught sight of the gold glint again.
At breakfast he found himself staring at a blond mop of hair. In classes, he’d try and fail to tear his eyes away from a back donned in Slytherin robes. At dinner he’d try to ignore the rich sounding voice, which always seemed to cut through the babble of his schoolmates. Then, at night in the privacy of his own bed, he’d close his eyes to fantastical thoughts all about a boy with grey eyes, one who Harry often found staring right back at him.
The smile slipped slowly from Potter’s too-real mouth, and now green eyes stared unblinkingly – blank and shallow.
Something shifted. There was a bright white light around Harry, spilling out, and then –  fading, and he was here in front of him with a gentle breeze that rushed through his hair and clothes. Like he was real. Like he was
The absence of it made him feel far, far worse. Pain in his chest reared its ugly head, and hiked up a notch, but he ignored it.
In the moments that followed, silently fixated on each other in the dark, Draco watched his years with the boy in front of him play out in his mind, in Harry's face, older and lovelier. He watched Harry worry at his lower lip, look down at where his thumb was circling into the inside of Draco's wrist, and remembered a little green-eyed boy in a robe shop, drowning in his oversized clothes, a crack in his glasses. Innocent and still yet to live years more. He remembered him at twelve and thirteen and fourteen and fifteen, the two of them fighting, pushing and pulling with words and fists, Draco always trying to rile him up, to get him to just
Draco’s attention was drawn back to the ring and the geode it bore. There was a strange buzzing sensation in Draco’s fingers as he touched it. That feeling grew stronger when he put it on his finger.
Draco still comes looking for him after classes and smiles at him and talks to him just the same. He walks with him back to either the Slytherin Common Rooms in the dungeons or walks him back to the Gryffindor Towers. He laughs at his jokes and makes him laugh, too, with amusing or peculiar anecdotes and witty remarks. Nothing else has changed besides that Draco just doesn't touch him all that much anymore, and Harry is vividly aware of this.
"Or rather straightforward," Ginny agrees. "I just wish she was a little more straightforward about this."
There was something about this, the thought of Goyle having his last childhood friend left after him, that hurt.
“Funny. I didn’t know Blaise or Pansy were so tactile.” Narcissa eyed his neck, and Draco cursed inwardly. He had forgotten to glamour the marks there. “People talk Draco.”
he parried. Draco inched an eye open to glare at Madam Pomfrey only to see the mediwitch smother a small smile.
"I can't," Draco said, barely a whisper. Panic was his heart fluttering about in his sternum, a bird gone wild, trying to free itself. Fear and despair was a thick vine wrapping itself tight around his gut, around his lungs, making it hard to breathe.  "I can't just — it'll all go away. He'll go away if I — "
"It’s," Harry’s eyes flicked back to Malfoy, then he turned back to his desk mortified. "Nothing – no."
And out there, in the middle of the yard, was where the phantom of Harry Potter's death haunted them all.
There was a stiffness in everyone's gait. Professors spoke in hushed tones and couldn't seem to bring themselves to reprimand anyone. People who did laugh or chuckle in the hallways were hushed waspishly. Everyone clung to their friends desperately and no new friends were made – nobody trusted strangers anymore.
he thinks of saying in some stupid attempt to laugh it off. He doesn't. He stays still and quiet instead and hopes Draco will just stay right here.
Draco had hidden himself away on a crooked, spindling staircase in a branched-off tower of the Owlery. He sat in the wandlit alcove,  from where he stared at a sliver of big, bright skies, rolling hills, and a blanket of dark trees. He wished that he could run into it all from this height and become lost in it. If he could somehow be suspended forever and then become a vapour, he’d take it over the miserable grey study in
"Your best friends. Alright. Fine." Draco exhales a slow, heavy breath through his nose, his lips pursed, his jaw set tight. "Explain to me why you're okay with your ex-Weaslette touching you but not me."
as him or the next person, and yes, Draco was not above Confunding his Great Uncle Tiberius’ portrait when he was trying to keep an eye on one mischievous great nephew.
echoed unsaid around them. “But I wouldn’t give him up for even the happiest of lives. Because, you see, my life was meant to be his. Just his. And nothing else beyond that. Everything is draining of light and colour because it was all for him, the only reason I could behold either was to see him at my side.” Draco swallowed. “And it would’ve been magnificent. He would have shone so bright and I would have shown him how much it meant to me. How much
It took him a few tries to get it right. It took a lot of his air and energy, left his breaths shallow and his eyes closed, leaning just so into a body that wasn't here. But then it was there, clear through the room; a soft and grainy tune in the tremor of a woman's voice, the way all old songs have, singing,
Something was welling up in him as he continued to read through them, swelling into an ache in his chest. His breaths were shallow and unsteady in his throat.
Draco was in the library, listening to Goyle’s soft snores as he flicked through page after page idly. He wondered to himself what the point of any of this was. All that Hogwarts had taught him this past month was that people were as unforgiving as they were hypocritical.
Everything went on sluggishly around him, his friends moving like silken bathwater around a cold knee. His eyes struggled to focus, as if a gauze had settled over his eyes and made everything hazy, poorly defined.
How had Draco never seen Harry in this light before? He thought his subconscious must be taking liberties; Harry pulled Draco in, like light, moth, and flame. But his mind now catalogued other details he’d previously overlooked, such as how Harry's clothes were far too large for him, frayed and full of holes. His cheeks were hollow, and his wrists were too thin. There was an instinctive downturn to his lips, like his mouth had not learned to smile unguardedly yet – as if it had been given scarce reason to do so in the first instance.
He can't say when it started, these feelings he'd developed for a boy he'd hardly liked two years ago, only that it had started sometime in Eighth Year, after their enmity had died down to something civil, after the change in Draco's behavior towards him and his friends, still all smirks and snark and snide remarks, yes, but he'd also apologized with thorough sincerity to all those he'd wronged—some forgave and some didn't, and that was fair. Harry took it as a testament to his newfound maturity that he accepted their reactions graciously and moved on.
Draco’s Harry-shaped obsession grew arms, legs and a personality around fourth year. In corridors, classrooms, on the Quidditch pitch, in Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade
all pretending they haven’t just lost you, that you haven’t died. It’s bloody awful and I fucking hate it.
Draco was shaking and there were damned tears brinming in his eyes. Granger didn’t look much better herself, flinching with every mention of Harry’s death as if in physical pain.
He can, maybe. Maybe he can just reach out a hand, curl it around his bicep and tug at him and pull him in, and Draco will follow his cue, will give him what he's asking for. Harry knows he will, knows he'll never stop him. Some day he'll learn to reach out and take his hand first, and pull him against himself with an arm around him, and kiss him first, all without a thought, with an ease and comfort that's as natural as breathing, but maybe it starts here, now, learning to. It's all he wants to do, all he wants to learn in that moment.
Ginny smiles, then, and Harry relaxes considerably. "It's alright, Harry." She continues walking down the hall, prompting Harry to break out of their sudden halt as well. Her auburn hair is flying back in the winds coming into the open corridors. "I mean, it's unexpected.
“Your necklace – it’s – what is it?” Getting a closer look at it now, it was quite obviously a snitch, and now Draco looked like a right moron.
Slughorn’s glare returned to Draco. The man had never liked him, but Draco knew that Slughorn’s dislike had turned into something a shade darker since the war.
Draco mouthed wetly, having no air in his lungs to sound it. Harry’s eyes brimmed, and Draco wished for nothing except to be able to hold that warm-looking hand, closed so tight the knuckles were bone-white.
"I love you," Draco rasped, tremulous and thick, into his shoulder, over and over, feeling the warmth and life of Harry's hands moving up his hair. His legs were weak, and much of his weight was just held up by Harry's arms. "I love you so much, Oh God, I–"
It was Harry’s. It was Harry’s mark upon him, bright and blazing where the Dark Lord’s mark was sickly and swallowed light.
"Why are we undressing?" Harry asks, watching as Draco straightens his own collar and tugs at the knot in his tie, not answering his question.
It seemed as if Granger was turning away from him, but then she suddenly stopped, turning back to regard him for a few moments before her next words bowled him over.
He began following the set at his feet. Step-for-step, he moved with them to where the print concentrated at the boy’s Quidditch locker room. His breath picked up as he entered the room, still foggy and damp from Hufflepuff's scheduled Wednesday evening practise.
Potter held his gaze and slowly shook his head. Not nothing – something. Something you don’t deserve.
Draco’s gaze snapped to her, and the prickling sensation that Lovegood often induced rolled over him.
Harry catches Draco eying him as Hermione leans her head against his shoulder by the force of her laughter and Harry pulls her close by an arm around her shoulder, grinning broadly, not going still. He catches eyes with Draco when Ron pats Harry's back or his shoulder, not going still. He notices Draco go quiet and distant when Ginny kisses his head playfully and he doesn't go still.
Harry’s heart hurt with every word that Draco said. He could only nod jerkily as he tried to reign in his emotions. His lips found Draco’s again, and in this kiss, he found his home, the fantasy that felt eons old.
He waited for Harry, in his rooms, on the Quidditch pitch, near Hagrid’s hut, under the Gryffindor tower, and even the rafters in the Defence classroom. These were the places that Draco knew Harry loved to visit the most, to explore, and watch as the world moved on without him.
Some of the Gryffindors did not return this year. This included Weasley, out of grief for the man that had saved their world but had to be taken away in order to do so. They could not bear to come to the very place that they'd lost him.
His fingers brushed over Draco's hands again. Draco wished he could feel him, wished he could feel the life and warmth of him when he was alive again. But he was not alive, and he could not. Harry smiled, and again, like a soundless whisper,
He knew he'd been careful. No one would have seen or heard him mention the colours Harry had left behind, or how his own wand looked almost bronzed when compared to the grey, dankness of everything surrounding it.
Draco sighed, not unkindly, as he watched her curve down the many higgledy-piggledy iron grate steps. Her footfalls echoed like a gong all around him inside the tower.
Sometime later, Harry tilts Draco's head back by a hand on the back of his hair and puts his lips to his, kissing him first for the first time. He sees Draco's eyes close to it through the half-lidded droop of his own gaze, on the verge of slumber, and there is the smallest quirk of a smile at his lips when Harry draws his head back to look at him, his snowy-blond hair tousled, his face beautiful and blissed out and mellowed with covert joy. Draco lays his head down to his shoulder again, hiding a smile that's growing broader against his skin.
Harry pulled him to the side of the bed, grinning at him. Draco couldn’t help but return it, his chest so full and warm.
Even Draco as a little boy had mooned over the myth that was Harry Potter, The-Boy-Who-Lived, The Chosen One.
Draco hauls him aside into an empty corridor and against the wall and kisses down his face and jaw and neck. He wraps his arms around his neck, bounces his eyebrows and asks with a grin,
He was now staring at Granger, or more specifically, the strange necklace around her neck. Quickly, he glanced away.
, and he could only sit there in his seat, on the verge of tears as he gasped and choked through the pain. Somebody was talking, a hand on his shoulder, gently pulling at him, and the class had gone utterly silent.
Draco thought back to how something in him had withered and died seeing Potter lifeless on the floor, and realising that he had never gotten over it – he would never
Pomfrey hadn’t even finished when Draco stood up, retrieved his wand, clothes and satchel before spelling them on his person.
Potter was staring too, but then nodded slightly, kicking the ground as if he were nervous. His timidity didn’t make any sense, Draco thought. What did the dead have to be anxious about? He’d imagined Potter’s ghost would be this wild thing, like Pan running with the Forest winds. Not this shy, anxious boy standing across from him. Potter was not shy – Potter was a lion.
Draco's eyes had been too caught up on the corners of Potter’s lips to notice a slight shift between them. He looked down when a strange sensation tickled at his wrist. Like a memory of soft touch, Potter’s finger traced the lifeline of Draco’s palm, then down to his too-thin wrists.
They sleep together for the first time, and Harry clings to him with all of himself. He kisses and touches and mouths at his body as much as he wants to because it's all high and heat and he knows what to do here, how to make it good. He wonders if Draco can feel it now, how starved he is for him, for the way his nimble hands slide up into his hair, the arm clinging back to him around his shoulders under his underarms, the way his body feels against the flesh of his arms, the heat and softness of him, and the way his torso jounces rapidly against his own, his short, hitched breaths and gasps muffled into the hollow of Harry's neck.
‘Where are you going?’ Draco asked softly. The sound of it belied the anxiety which was creepin up on him.
"Salazar," Draco said. He looked up, trying to distract himself. The world looked dull and dreary as it had ever since the war ended, since Harry had gone. "It's like everything's been grey ever since that damned war. Look at the sky."
A pale hand encased in a white, rolled up shirt travelled alongside his own arm. Harry closed his eyes against the sensation, his back and chest tingling. It spoke of a knowing and recognition that was bone-deep and ached within him.
Draco coughed into a small handkerchief, and bloody spittle came away. He frowned at it before hiding it in his pocket.
Harry was doing nothing except shaking his head and putting distance between him. His face looked panicked, like Draco had done something that had scared him.  Draco came closer to him, his hand reaching out. He realised that Harry was saying something, repeating it every few steps, his eyes glazed.
Hence, he didn’t try for a third and relaxed totally when he heard Madam Pomfrey’s muttering. He was breathing in the lemon-lavender scent of the sheets when she finally pottered to Draco after telling of a first year off for slapping an exploding snap card against his own forehead.
Draco ran a hand over his stomach and took a deep breath, the first he’d taken in some time which didn’t send spasming pain through him. He muttered his thanks, not because he was ungrateful, but because any louder would announce the tremulous sensation in his throat.
There were tears, silently glistening down her cheeks. Draco couldn't remember the last time he had seen such a sight.
Draco peered up from beneath wet lashes. His breath trembled as he took in the welcome sight before him.
, they make their way through the empty lounge and up to the boy's dorm, where most are awake besides Neville and Ron. They fixate on Draco walking hand-in-hand beside Harry, leaning close together and murmuring amongst themselves.
Draco stared out into the place where it had all happened, leaning his head and shoulder against the pillar, arms crossed over his chest. The skies were grey too, weeping. He wondered vaguely if Potter took all the colours with him when he left.
"Last May," he said after he searched her features, which revealed nothing except the calmness Lovegood wanted him to see. "It started then."
He stopped at the sight of thin folded notes wedged into the centre of the book. He pulled them open, straightening them out onto the hardcover.
Potter smiled, though it's still a sad, downturned thing. He stepped forward and motioned for Draco to move his legs in the aisle so he could sit in the seat directly opposite Draco.
And Harry always looks to Draco, or thinks of him. He thinks of touching him all the time. He thinks of holding his hand, or letting Draco curl up against him, or sidling up himself against him, thinks of pulling him up against walls or against himself and kissing him first, but he doesn't know how to ask. He never has. He's stuck in his own skin that doesn't always know how to feel against somebody else's, his hands that grow too heavy when they lift to reach for another's, his body that can't seem to calm down under the weight of another body.
Draco couldn’t feel Potter’s fingertips, not really. His body still lit up with gooseflesh and a rolling shiver as if he did.
Up and up to the rafters was where Harry took him, his coloured steps slow and careful and heavy along with Draco's. The solace of his hand, the illusion of his arm supporting his waist the only thing pushing Draco forward, one breath and step to the next.
Those same authors had recently printed new books, all of the rose-tinted lies about their imagined hero. Potter had been too human, too real to fit the mould of their fanciful ideals. And it made Draco ache with anger that the truth of it was ignored for something more aesthetic.
Draco clenched his jaw against the burn in his eyes, but he kept reading, even as it tore at his insides.
Weasley's sister pressed a soft, final kiss to his hand and rested her forehead against the back of it, her eyes falling shut, face contorting red. Molly Weasley came next, and then Arthur and George and every other Weasley and Longbottom and Lovegood—
Greg exhaled through his nose sharply before pinching his brow. Draco then spied Luna’s pale hand curled around Greg’s forearm in a gentle show of care and comfort, and it lightened the ache in Draco’s chest. And as Greg straightened, Draco knew it helped him too.
With both their shirts off, Draco places his hands on either side of Harry's head, snow-blond hair hanging around his face and into his silver eyes, hovering over him. "Tell me what you want."
He climbed, higher and higher, breathing hard and walking blind. He heard footsteps behind him, following him, just as the tingling awareness of
Harry shakes his head. "I'm not embarrassed to be with you, for Merlin's sake! I don't bloody care what people think about us."
Draco didn’t mind it so much in this class; brewing potions provided its own strange noises. But in other classes, in all the other rooms of his school, Draco found himself wanting to scream. Glancing over at his classmates, he sensed the feeling was mutual.
"They, er... they've never really liked... they didn't like magic and they didn't like me. So they didn't like touching me." Harry snorts a small laugh, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. "I, er. I tried to hug my aunt when I was six, and she pushed me away and called me dirty. I thought she meant that I didn't bathe enough."
“Thank Merlin, otherwise I’d have to keep suffering your rancid breath, Burns." Draco grinned toothily with a levity he didn’t feel.
He eyed the prints, so engrossed in the memory playing before his eyes it was almost as if he was right there all over again, kneeling before Harry. Terrified and desperately hoping Harry would make it out, that nobody would find out what Draco did. That he was more sure about Harry than he'd ever been sure of anything in that moment, and he still couldn't bring himself to give the absolute answer that it was him. To be the one to give him away.
"Do you think I wasn't like this with them too at the start? With everyone else?" Harry hasn't quite ever talked about this with anyone. He's never really wanted to, in all honesty. His palms are growing sweaty. "Even now, I still can't ever bring myself to initiate it with anybody."
He looked out into the sky again, unsettled. He tried to see it, mentally willing colour to pool back into the world.
Draco’s heart was thumping. His eyes were then drawn to Harry’s lips. Even bitten and chapped, they were still his and all the more lovely for it.
. Leaning against the doorway silently. He was loose-limbed, shoulder pushed into the stone, arms crossed over his chest as he seemed to watch Draco from afar.
Draco moved quickly to the doorway, an old corridor that he had never set foot in before. He found himself apprehensive, scared almost, but he walked ahead into the dark shadows. He peered forwards. There were no lights, just stone and echoes as his feet continued on and on, growing pitch-black. He walked until he could no longer see his own hands in front of him, and the cool stone his other hand grazed, that guided him as he ran his hands along it, was terribly cold and damp.
"It's not fair," Draco said, a tremor of a thick breath.  He was sick and tired and so, so sad, and all he wanted was to be wherever Harry was, and he didn't think he could ever forgive himself for what he had done. What he had missed out on when he was too busy doing all the wrong things. "It's not fair that I spent all our time hating you when you were mine and I was meant to love you forever."
Draco felt himself pale. His traitorous eyes sought Harry out. Green eyes stared right back at him, burning and red-rimmed.
of footprints gleamed in bright little paths over Hogwarts’ rolling hills and dales. It looked as if thousands of fireflies were marching, or as if stars had become earth-bound instead of encrusted in the heavens.
Soon, they loomed over him from all sides. He took a moment to look around at the stands, making sure they were empty.
Harry takes a breath, his heart pounding fast, his hands growing heavy, but he lifts them anyway. He reaches out a hand and curls it around Draco's bicep. Draco's head raises up from the book to look at him, his voice fading away. Harry tugs at him, Draco follows his hesitant maneuvering, scooting closer, shifting around to lay back against him when Harry pulls him in against himself and folds his arms around him.
Interest piqued, Draco dislodged his arm out from where Goyle had been drooling on it and went to pluck the book off the shelf.
Draco did sort of pause at the foot of the boy’s dormitory steps; he simply stared at the footprints carved there. They were a silvery golden, the stone lit in the morning sun almost dazzling him in comparison to the spaces in between that seemed almost
There was a pull in his chest, then, stretching taut the swollen bruise that was his heart. He could not explain what it was that kept him there, what kept him sitting there on his knees for longer than he knew, fixated on the framed picture of Potter's face until his eyes blurred from something he couldn't name. Potter was smiling in the picture, the ebony curls of his hair tousled and wild, falling against the hinge of his glasses. His eyes were green, brilliant and somehow even greener than the soft and slow sway of the grass nettles around Draco. The dried autumn leaves clinging to branches dropped like rain, landing, amassing the ground.
It creaked as the door swung away from them. Sun shone through dust motes and dark wooden rafters. Harry wasn’t breathing, not really. His teeth had sunk into his own lip and his eyes were wet.
He had not had enough. He wanted to find every moment of Harry's life when he was living, all of his handprints and footprints. He wanted to find out everything about him, from when he had been here at Hogwarts, all the things he loved with his heart, what he'd thought with that clever mind of his. How he'd lived. How wonderful he'd been.
Draco didn't notice at all, how the world began to fall away, how the song faded away from his mind.
Each time he woke up from these dreams, his pillow was wet and he was typically late for his first lesson, trying to talk himself down from an unbearable sadness.
There was one sketch of Draco in a train station, trembling against the compartment door as a dementor passed behind him through the window. Draco's cheeks flushed, mortification laying thick over him. This had actually happened. It must have been the Weasley twins who told him. Under it, it said,
Draco's head recoils, nose scrunched. "You really could use someone better for security." He pauses. "Then again, they're using portraits for safeguarding, so what do you expect?"
"That's alright. It was worth a try," Harry says. He smiles ruefully. His chest feels uneasy even as he does, thornful and aching. He breaks his gaze away from him, then, suddenly feeling strange about the way he looked at him too long when Draco wasn't looking back, and instead watches the scene taking place ahead of them.
But now it made sense why Granger looked as if she hadn’t wanted to part with Draco’s wand. At the time, Draco thought she didn’t trust him with it. Now he understood that it was one of the few things left she had that Harry had touched.
He unfolded it carefully and frowned. There was only one word written on it. But, then he read it, absorbed it, and his breath hitched, and his eyes flashed to Malfoy.
Harry smiles, and he leans close and kisses him on the mouth hard enough to bob Draco's head back, both of them well-aware that it will only serve to distract them even more.
Harry jerked to a stop. The door flashed in his mind like a memory, like it was something he’d seen before.
Ron's blue eyes narrow at him in some kind of silent warning. "Remember what we talked about, Malfoy?"
"I – no. Ron and I, we have said our goodbyes. You didn’t get to. Not in person." At this Granger looked back at the spot where Harry was still standing, peering as if she could she him too.
The thought had Draco leaving his bed very quickly and almost cursing at the white sheets that wouldn’t unwrap themselves.
“Too short," Harry continued. “And when it's done, there are far too many important things we find have slipped through our fingers.”
Looking down at his feet, Draco saw how many times Harry had walked in and out of the Room of Requirement. He thought he could even see the rushed jump and skid of the last time he had closed its doors; after he had saved Draco from burning to death.
into the hollow of his neck, once, and twice, and then again, like it was all he knew how to say and think. All the love that was written on the walls around them, packed into the way Harry said his name. All the things he didn't have time to tell Draco, just there in his voice.
The classroom was quiet except for the soft rattle and bubble of simmering cauldrons. After the brief memoriam given by Headmistress McGonagall that morning, there was a subdued, hesitant air within Hogwarts now. Gone was the easy conversation and the giggling laughter of careless, easy-going peers. Now there was a strange pensiveness that everyone had adopted, and it followed them all like a bad smell and chilled them bone-deep.
Draco saw a hand move towards him out of the corner of his eyes. He braced against it, but nothing helped the shudder that seized him when the faint warmth prickled at the hollow of his cheek. And his heart gave a sore, icky thump.
Draco then felt a hand touch his. His whole body froze, not daring to move, all his focus – all of it – now burned onto that small expanse of warm skin on his wrist.
But he was functioning enough. He was going to his classes, though focus was a constant battle when his body was a warzone. He was meeting his friends, going out with them on the better days and staying in with them on the less better days, and it was easier to listen than it was to keep up a conversation, but Luna and Goyle didn't seem to mind that much, besides the worried looks they would cast his way sometimes.
When he reached the Potions class door, he took a few moments tobright himself, his hands on his hips as he tried and failed to stop breathing like a mad man.
Between the steam vapours and his own listlessness, Draco followed the recipe blindly. He chopped, squeezed, grinded, sprinkled, and stirred as a mannequin would if it were so inclined.
Opening it to the first page, Draco began reading it slowly, as if tasting each word and savouring it. Here, between his palms, were the thoughts of a fourteen-year-old Harry.
Draco stopped suddenly, the voice snapping him back to reality. He pivoted again, this time back to the carnage he had created. Feathers, scales, powder, and gunk all made up the chaos that was now Professor Slughorn’s potions class.
"Looks like you're in for a fun night, eh, Harry?" Seamus says when Draco's gone off to the loo, grinning, throwing a glance at Dean, who waggles his eyebrows. "Don't forget to put up the spells. We've heard the rumours about you two."
Harry laid him down, very gently, and then laid down beside him himself, arms around him, forehead against his.
For a moment, Draco could only stare at him, keep his eyes wide open and try to make sense of what was right in front of him.
Harry turned with a force that nearly upended his scales again. Professor Snape was then telling him off for his own clumsiness, but it fell on deaf ears because Harry’s were filled with the pounding beat of his heart.
"Keep it." Draco took her hand and clasped it around the snitch. "You see, I already have a gift from him…"
hours were ahead of him in which he’d have to avoid an array of hexes, curses, pranks, and being cornered by brutes who’d rather use a booted foot and a fist instead of their wands.
He begins to ease under Draco's hands and his body, even if he still can't bring his hands to lift and reach for his, or kiss him first. It's fine, maybe, at least for now, because Draco continues to hold his hand and sidle up against him and kiss him first. He puts his head in Harry's lap, or draws Harry's head onto his own and gives him head massages or brushes his heavenly fingers through his hair, his nails scratching against his scalp. He holds him after sex and sometimes takes Harry's arm and puts it around him himself.
Draco nodded haltingly as flashes of a roaring crowd and a tumbling ball of red and gold came to mind. Her smile was just as gentle as her words then too. She looked down at it, holding it aloft from him to stare at it too. The gold was awfully bright, and Draco felt something catch in his throat.
Then a shape moved towards him. He strained his eyes to look up and saw Harry staring at him, pale and anxious. Harry looked around, as if to call out to others.
There had been Cho before her. They'd kissed, and it'd been... well, it'd mostly been nerve-wracking, wet and very uncomfortable.
There he was. Harry. He was here, kneeling beside him, and his cheeks were wet but his eyes were furious. He was shaking his head in such a rage.
The dorm, when he entered it, was quiet and still. At first, he took it all in, but then quickly his eyes darted to the red canopy encasing a four poster which was lit up like a match. The bedsheets, the curtains, and the floor around it all was a mass of colour and life. So much so that Draco nearly didn’t see the flowers surrounding the bed, all of them colourless to him.
"But he survived here, didn't he?" He felt the lump in his throat, his voice crack around it. His eyes stung. He kept his face very still, exhaled a close-mouthed tremor of a breath through his nose. "So why do I still feel like it was my fault? Why do I feel like I should have—I should have found a way to keep him—"
A small movement at the bottom of the bed caught his eye. Draco turned to see Potter perched on the foot board. It might have been strange to see your now departed, once-nemesis sitting at the end of your bed. And it was, except Potter’s expression was even more strange.
“Come and sit down” He half ordered Malfoy. The blond nodded and jumped over the back of the sofa and landed in the space between Harry and Theo, who was still reading. The latter jumped and got up from the couch, upset to have been interrupted in his reading and went upstairs.
He found the three Slytherins talking, each lying on their bed and staring at the ceiling. Draco was portraying a portrait of Harry.
Dumbledore and the other teachers had left the infirmary almost immediately, probably going to talk in the headmaster's office. Harry was then able to leave the infirmary as long as he rested. Dumbledore had made Ezekiel promise to tell no one what he knew about the horcruxes at the moment, but of course it wasn’t a real promise.
Hermione was trying to talk to Ron to calm him down on this whole story. Between children coming out of the future, this story of Soul Sister, Harry who had just mostly died only a few hours ago and now Harry kissing Malfoy, the redhead had difficulty accepting all that. And given the muffled cries coming from upstairs, it was not going well for Hermione. Theo and Blaise, for their part, played chess wizard version. Even though Theo listened with a little too much attention to the screams coming from upstairs, just to make sure the redhead was not going to kill his soon-to-be-girlfriend. Lyra turned to her father.
“What's wrong?” The blonde finally asked after filling the tub with water. Harry sighed and dropped his head forward, resting his forehead against Draco's shoulder. A few tears escaped him and his voice trembled slightly when he finally explained himself.
“You could ask him when we see him, what do you say?” Erin suggested with a smirk. The little boy had a big smile then went back to play, always taking the other boy with him.
“Or that day when we had to leave the room in a hurry” Alarik said. Lyra, Erin, Ezekiel, Nathaniel, Emett and Ascella laughed.
“You know what? You go see him right now and you just ask him, just the two of you” The boy seemed to hesitate for a second and then nodded. Harry put him on the ground and let him go. The boy ran to the stairs and a tender smile spread on Harry’s lips. He was still mad at Draco, like super mad but he still loved him so his happiness was what mattered.
"I don’t know but it smells war if you want my opinion" Harry gave him an amused smile and sat up in bed, without letting go of his hand.
“Are you calm?” Draco asked in a soft voice. He frantically nodded before plunging right back on the blonde's mouth. Draco turned his head and Harry ran aground on his cheek.
“If I win, I want you to think about the opportunity to consider getting to know Blaise, this guy is really fantastic” The redhead pouted a second before accepting, convinced that the Harry was going to lose. Unfortunately this was not the case. Draco had worked hard on learning the content of the bet and being an excellent player, he ended up putting the red in check.
Harry tried to laugh at the blonde’s demands but it was caught off by a moan when Draco opened his legs wide for the Gryffindor, his legs brushing Harry’s sides. He felt the muscles of Harry’s abdomen roll against his inner thighs and ran his hands up his back lovingly, maybe too lovingly.
“Dad!” Harry dropped Draco's hand and knelt down to greet the little boy who hugged his little arms around his neck. Harry stood up and Draco slipped an arm around his waist. He also kissed the child's forehead.
He wanted to wait for Ron to talk with him. He was thinking about what he would say to the redhead when he felt someone sit on him. He smiled against the mattress and turned around. Draco stood above him and a lecherous smile stretched his lips. It didn’t take long for Harry to understand his intentions. He then pulled on the neck of the blonde with a sharp blow. Their faces were so close to each other that they could feel each other's breath on their faces. Harry ran his hand behind his neck and he finally laid his lips on those of the blonde. His lips parted and their tongues mingled. Harry ran his hand through Draco's hair as his other hand began to undo the buttons on his shirt.
He received no response but his sister came near the others and he joined them a few moments later while holding the back of his head. Lyra mocked him and Eleanor went to hold Dimitri in her arms.
“Okay, enough softness” He said before grabbing Jordan by the arms. Once he was sitting, he grabbed him by the waist and helped him up. He then lead Jordan to the hole behind the library and sat him down. He kneeled in front of him and took his head in his hand.
“Who's that person?” Draco whispered to Harry who jumped, not having heard him coming. He shrugged, having no idea.
“By the way, I'm Lyra” She announced, extending her hand to Harry's. He grabbed it with pleasure as he looked into her eyes, then frowned and glanced at Nathaniel and then back at her. They had the same eyes.
“You don’t have a choice” Lyra told them. They growled and walked out of the room, at least Harry stepped out of the room pulling the blond behind him.
“We should go” Harry said, getting up. He held out a hand to help him stand up and they returned to their belongings and dressed. All the others did the same and then they went back to the castle, a storm getting ready behind them. Harry wondered what time it was and the time magically appeared in front of him, as if he had launched a Tempus, he had not launched anything. It was almost four. Harry watched as Draco walked not far from him and he was struck by a revelation. A very, very big revelation. He was falling in love with the blond Slytherin and it frightened him. He froze first in the middle of the corridor, completely petrified. Then, after several of the children nearly hit him, he started walking again quickly, very fast. He climbed the stairs four at a time and rushed to the new apartments almost while running.
“Well, I see we can get along” He glanced at his sister and she jumped happily from her chair and headed for Lena Weasley-Parkinson. She threw the candy pack at Ezekiel when she passed him. He picked some of them before throwing the package at his brother. He then sat down next to Harry.
“Of course I want to, stupid” Harry offered him a big, beautiful smile. Draco pulled his sweater and pants off under Harry's greedy eyes. It was a blushing Draco that slipped under the covers. Harry chuckled as he swung sideways, facing the blond. He closed his eyes and put a hand on the pale hip, his thumb caressing the stomach still flat. He fell asleep even before realizing it.
“I'm really sorry, but you're right in the middle of the Quidditch pitch and all the morons in the stands are staring at you with shocked looks” Harry glanced at the famous morons and admitted that their expressions were really funny to see. Harry could not continue his observation any longer, Hermione had just thrown herself into his arms.
“Eleanor is Ezekiel's girlfriend and Lyra is her sister, but it's also Joris's girlfriend who is Eleanor's brother”
Finally, Nathaniel and Jordan didn’t have the opportunity to share their idea with anyone since the departure arrived quickly. At the moment, they all entered their apartment. Harry stopped suddenly as he heard a laugh from the floor. He waved them to wait , which of course nobody did. So while the kids literally threw themselves on the couches, Harry started slowly up the stairs, under Draco's amused gaze.
“So, how is it going with your beautiful boy?” Zach finally asked him with a mocking smile. Dimitri glared at him.
“Ginny” He warned in a deep, dark voice. She refused to stray for a few seconds and then finally released Harry.
“Apparently” Harry replied with a sneer. Hermione, who didn’t want an argument to break out, asked the children if they could explain the situation to them.
“Well, yeah, that’s a good idea” Alya and Ezekiel agreed. “Nath!” She then yelled across the room. Jordan jumped a bit in the air, surprised by the sudden sound. He grumbled, wincing at the lightness of the room, and Nathaniel pulled him back against him, his hand in his hair.
“I don’t know, if I don’t act as they wish, they may be disappointed.” Harry laughed slightly, staring at the blonde's neck.
“I won’t be able to do this before a moment” Draco justified himself. Harry smiled and placed his lips on the blonde's. They then separated and got off the train while keeping a reasonable distance between them. Molly threw herself on Harry and nearly choked him by hugging him. Harry coughed and was released only when Emett intervened.
“We'll have to start tomorrow, so we've destroyed the maximum before he attacks the castle” Nathaniel explained.
He decided to try. He leaned over Harry, placed a hand on his cheek and kissed him. He then sent all the happy memories he had with Harry. Quidditch memories, smiles and exchanged smiles, kisses, their first time. He hid the children, however, so that Voldemort wouldn’t use them against Harry. The latter quickly returned to reality and, deepening the kiss, the images became stronger and they expelled Voldemort from Harry's mind. Harry dropped completely against the mattress, closing his eyes. Draco got up and went to get dressed. He heard the bedroom door open in a sinister grinding as he buttoned his shirt. He turned extremely slowly, a little worried about this not-so-reassuring noise and was relieved to see the three blond heads of the triplets. They stepped into the room and closed the door, which squeaked again.
“Pansy!” Draco cut him off. She then apologized for her behavior and Draco was going to answer her but they saw Harry coming back with a quick step. He passed between Pansy and Theo to reach Draco and grabbed his wrist and left without a word, pulling Malfoy behind him.
“What we know is their first names and that some of them look like you, Harry. But we don’t know the rest”
“We have to go” Harry said as there was another loud thud from the door. They ran to the stairs and as Harry about to climb up behind his children, he heard a sniff. He stopped himself in his track and went around the stairs. Lesath was sitting there, his knees up against his chest and tears streaming down his face.
“Harry!” She yelled, jumping into her best friend’s arms. He cast a questioning glance at Theo over Hermione’s hair as he slowly descended the stairs, his hands sinking into his pockets.
“Jordan came to sleep with Nath, and Lyra is shouting at them” the boy explained, as if it were obvious. Dimitri retreated until he could pass the door of his head.
Granger's eyes were still dull and lifeless when she finally walked away from Draco. He stood in the empty, quiet corridor. Her words, and the silence thereafter, left a howling roar in Draco’s chest.
Draco's mind was racing wild with all the things he'd learned from Harry's journal and letter. He kept remembering the words he wrote for him, to him, about him. He'd been going through his life in this haze of despair these days, but never had it quite hit like this, like he could not breathe, or move from the weight of it all.
Draco stared and stared at the boy beside him, drinking his fill. Harry was younger here – sixteen and so full of life and hope that it made Draco feel old and desolate. Harey's smile and stare were the only things about him that didn’t seem somewhat fragile or awfully breakable.
It all came down to the fact that most witches’ and wizards' assumption that portraits were objects, and were not, instead, susceptible to certain spells because of this. Draco, whose whole childhood was spent in the company of watchful portrait eyes, knew that yes, portraits were just as susceptible to a good
He turned to see his father’s portrait, staring after her, his features wan, pale, and terribly sad.
His subconscious brain vaguely caught some words, so he repeats them back without thinking. "Powder the... Boomslang?"
He turned, ducked, and dived into an alcove, then a flight of stairs, through another corridor, that lead into a huge room, another set of winding steps until he was met with a door.
He paused, pulling at Harry's hand until he held it in front of his face. Draco splayed their fingers until they pressed against each other palm to palm, as if in prayer.
Draco is as funny and charming as expected, all smirks and snark and amusing remarks until they walk to the door of his common room, and then he's quiet, something mellow and hopeful on his face, like he's waiting for Harry to do something in the silence they're standing in.
Harry simply tilted his head. His eyes were full of mirth, as if Draco had said something quietly hilarious, his lips pursing to hide it.
and it was grim. So, when Draco read his own name, he cringed appropriately as his misdeed towards Harry was recorded in excruciating detail. He read how Harry hated him, righteously.
Draco stared down at the Defence book unseeingly – a wish for something he couldn’t word or name rising up like bile.
"Hm," Draco says noncommittally, a little too much so. There's a twitch in his cheek, but Harry can't tell if he's only imagined it. He shifts around to get comfortable on him, drops a blind kiss that lands on Harry's neck and then turns back to the book, continuing on with his explanation of the procedure for the formation of Polyjuice Potion.
As more blood streamed, too quick for him to wipe it, Draco looked around quickly, trying to get himself to move though in his panic. He’d frozen still.
Which didn’t make any sense, because it was Draco Malfoy – a boy who he so thoroughly disliked it made his teeth ache. Or, at least, that was what he liked to convince himself of anyway.
It's just that when Draco scoots in close against his back, Harry tenses up all over his bare and warm torso, and Draco can't have not noticed this.
"Your love would have been bright; it would have been colourful," Lovegood said as her thumb caressed the back of his trembling hand.
A mild ache had started down in Draco's chest, persisting through all of his classes. By afternoon, it had grown into a steady throb, an occasional spike of pain shooting through his sternum and making him wince sharply. Goyle noticed as they walked back to the dorm and asked him if he was alright.
There had to have been something like forty scraps of parchment folded into the pages of this book. All of them seemed to be thirteen-year-old Potter letting off some steam or boredom. Draco even spied little badly sketched pictures, all of them still charmed to move – something that Draco himself was partial to when riling up the boy.
It had become a habit to make himself scarce on the big dates, and today was the day the Dark Lord led the Burberry Massacre. He had not been a part of it. Draco had been at school, but such facts were waved off in the face of righteous blame and pointing fingers.
"Your housemates are probably awake," Draco points out, and he's right. They did call it an early night tonight.
Every time Draco thought about him, the space under his ribs burned, with shame, guilt, and hatred. Then there was a deep yearning under it all, dark and twisted and futile.
Draco halted to a stop in the middle of the corridors, shoulders of crowds brushing past him, pushing him back a step. His brows twitched, his breaths shallow, stilled high in his throat. Potter smiled at him, a small one at the corners of his lips, which was surreal alone without the fact that this can't
Those three boys weren’t wrong, and their opinion was not an unpopular one. And if Draco could do it again, and Merlin how he wished he could, he would do anything,
“We can treat it.” Pomfrey stared at him imploringly. “Otherwise, without magic...no one survives that.”
and cheered him on as he heaved himself up the steps. Sir Galahad even galloped alongside him on his white horse. He was cursing his ineptitude when he tripped on his hanging robes as he tried to bolt past the Great Hall doors.
And so, with his hands in his pockets, he watched as the people that had loved Potter said goodbye to his corpse in the casket, one by one. Granger cried, kissing his forehead. So did Weasley when he knelt by it, murmuring words that weren't for anyone else to hear.
He stared at it, entranced by how bright it was. Its colours shone in the dark because Harry had touched it. Draco reached out as if to take it, as if possessed, but before he touched it, he snatched his hand back. If he touched it, he would never let it go.
Something moved in the corner of Draco's eye, and through the hazy fog, he peered at a patch of wall that seemed to shift. He frowned at it, grabbing his wand from the little shelf in front of him before staying very, very still. He found himself moving forward, despite himself, his body burdened with a terrible curiosity.
Holding the book she had just given him gave him the same strange notion that Loony Lovegood was not all she seemed. He thumbed through the pages, something settling in him now that he was touching a book that both Snape and Harry had held themselves.
“—No. No, thank you. Lovely meeting you, but I’m going now.” Draco said tersely as he slipped his shoe on and grabbed for his coat.
But some of it shone; the way he described his Godfather, the strength of his feelings towards a man who had barely begun to touch his life was astounding, and indicative of a serious lack of familial affection.
Draco's breath shuttered and his jaw worked to set against a tremor on his lips, tightening. He stared right back, his gaze hollow.
Just as he is about to melt into him, finally, Draco withdraws. Harry feels the odd, inexplicable pang of the loss of his solidity and heat.
“Recently, I’ve treated some of the most bizarre cases of my career. Some might argue the most tragic.” Pomfrey had this faraway look in her eye before she returned to Draco. “You see, war is terrible, death is terrible
“Nothing," Draco rushed out in a dry whisper. “That’s nothing.” He tried for a smile, still unable to meet those eyes.
. You saw it – you were right there! And now you’re hallucinating his mute apparition because you’re an idiot and you think about him too much anyway, always have since forever. And –
So, if Draco messed up a few steps, he didn’t notice it. He was about to throw a handful of hellebore into the mixture before a freezing sensation shocked him and sent a fissure of panic chasing down his spine.
Draco’s pain was naught in the face of what sat before him – his complaints and grievances folly compared to what Potter had been forced to suffer. He didn’t get to pity himself, and Draco would not let Potter attempt to soothe those wounds. Not when no one had soothed Potter’s.
Draco got the fright of his life when he woke up to find Hermione Granger at the foot of his hospital bed.
The last of the distance on their walk back to the Gryffindor Commons takes place in silence, Draco's hand tangled with Harry's.
One day, Harry gathers up all the courage he's mustered over weeks, of quietly reaching for Draco's hand and then always withdrawing it at the last second, and just finally, finally takes it.
Draco found Potter staring right at him. The intensity of it had him transfixed but also suddenly sitting up straight. He’d seen Potter like this before, many times, enough to know he should be nervous. Because, if Potter was looking at you like that, then it meant something bad was underway, and there was little you could do to stop it.
Draco looked at Luna, frowning. She was smiling, faintly, something else to it. A sort of sad knowing. "He's right."
Draco was startled by the last one. Lovegood’s statements had a prophetic air sometimes. Others just sounded like minced words, and it was hard to wade through it all. Though, after seeing Harry, Draco had to wonder if Lovegood
"No," Draco said. He breathed, a sharp inhale in time to a spike in his chest.  "I'm fine. It'll go away on its own, I'm sure."
He tugs at his waist, down towards himself, blind need and half-thought out, but Draco follows his cue, shifting around on his knees until he can drape himself over Harry's torso, stomach to stomach, chest to chest, shoulders to shoulders. His nose presses into the side of Harry's neck, arms worming in through Harry's underarms and under his shoulders and around them.
There's the occasional time one might see his ease and comfort with his mother, and sometimes even Blaise Zabini, and especially Pansy Parkinson, the way he'll drop his head into her lap without a thought and let her stroke his hair, but that's about it.
to touch his image sank into him. His thoughts turned dark as they recalled how Potter looked in his last moments and what Draco might have done differently, what he could have done to save Potter, to save himself from this black feeling in his chest.
“Then let them,” Draco said quietly, lest he screamed it. “They already discuss much worse things about us – being a Malfoy isn’t exactly something to be proud of.”
“What you did for me? That’s what I didn’t deserve Harry.” Uttering Potter’s given name made his throat tighten so much that it felt like choking. “Harry.” He said it again, simply because he had never done so before then.
Harry’s steps led him right to it, distorted at the bed of the tree as if he’d knelt or sat down before walking on
Draco thought of himself, aged thirteen and fourteen and fifteen, his head so full of Harry all the time. He would wake up thinking of him, of how he would try to catch his attention, what he would say to get him fired up over him, feel something for him. He would fall asleep dreaming of how things could have been different, if only Harry had taken his hand on that train, if only what he felt for him was something entirely different from hatred. He would go to class with a flutter of excitement in his belly at the thought of seeing him, getting Harry's eyes on him whenever he walked in with his friends, settled onto a seat, caught eyes with him for even a split-second.
When Potter had been alive, Draco’s eyes had always been drawn to him – his free, delighted chaos. He could remember the sound of Potter’s laughter, full-bellied and roaring. He’d heard it echo down hallways, whilst reading the newspaper in the Great Hall, on the Quidditch pitch. The sound of it had made Draco feel...strange. Off-kilter.
“I lost something, Greg, and I won’t ever have it back. There are a great many things to live for, I know that.” Draco paused. “But there are things you can’t live without, and I found mine.”
He stared at Harry, whose eyes were wide and unblinking. “I don’t need to die to know how that feels," Draco said slowly. “Because you see...I have already lost something.”
Draco’s head was a fuzzy white before a crack of hot pain seared through his cheek and jaw. Merlin, he could even feel it in his eyeball.
without you, that is," Draco breathed, as he would if he were speaking to his own reflection; honestly and without restraint. “Though, it’s also terribly good to see you now – even if you aren’t really here.”
As his friends walked away, arm in arm, Draco noted with a fond smile what an odd pair they were, and how perfect they were for one another.
All the while something vital had shifted loose inside of Draco and fallen away from him, seeing Potter’s body slumped to the ground. The image still replayed itself in his mind’s eye. Again, and again, and again.
When he came to, Draco was vaguely aware that there had just been a potions blast and that he’d caused it. He heard the moans and griping of those around him, the shuffle of limbs on dusty stone, and the fumbling of their professor attempting to right the situation.
By then, it was pitch black outside, save for a few stars and the glimmering pathways of Harry’s steps.
Outside the window, Draco watched the rolling hills pass him. It was later in the evening now and the outside was drowned in warm blues and blackish green. Even though it was so heavily muted, the view now made his gut squeeze a little. The grass banks running along the tracks captured all of his attention. They were bathed in the warm gold from the train lights and seemed to dance in his gaze.
“Don’t think you can just leave like that!” Harry yelled at Draco from behind him. They were walking up the stairs to their room. Emett was still in Harry’s arms, in need of a hug. Sometimes, Harry still heard him sniff in him neck.
"It's Draco now?” Harry just blushed, not knowing what to say. “Yes, I think it's going to happen Harry. I also think that a psychic connection could possibly be established between you” Harry had an expression of incomprehension on the face.
Harry awoke with a start a few hours later. He felt good. He made his way to the bathroom when he heard some noise in the bathroom. He opened the door softly and froze when he saw Draco, his head resting on the edge of the toilet bowl, ready to fall asleep. Harry knelt beside Draco and put his hand behind his back.
“Jo, come on” Nath repeated and Jordan rolled on his side, lying now between Nathaniel and the back of the couch. Nath squeezed his thigh one last time before walking to the table. Jordan rolled over on his stomach and closed his eyes again.
“Daddy, you're going to drain your energy by collecting the necklace, so if one of us does not come to help you, you might spend a long time in a magical coma” Alya explained, more serious than ever. The teachers consulted each other visually.
Harry was speechless, not thinking Lucius too tender with his family. Footsteps were heard from the stairs and Zach, Dimitri, Alarik, Jordan and Joris appeared in the living room.
“One” He began. The redhead tried to struggle but Alya came into the room, reinforcing the power of her brother. She moved to Harry's side and gave him a big smile as she opened a bunch of candy.
“He's Hermione and Theo’s son” His brother pursued. They were all astonished and looked at the two interested parties, who had plunged into the book again and did not listen to what was going on.
“I think you've perfectly corrected my eyesight Draco” Draco's eyes were wide and he did not understand anything.
Harry’s only response was to put his arms around Draco’s neck and to press himself against him. He was definitely drunk.
“I arrived this morning and thought it would be useful to tell you that I had met Grandpa Lu in the hall” Harry frowned.
“It seems more likely” Harry started to move forward, Draco next to him. They passed their door, then Blaise and Ron. Then came to a door where the names inscribed were "Black-Snape" On the next door it was written
Severus Snape opened the shower stall and walked out. He pulled on a boxer and headed for the living room of his private apartments. He jumped when he heard a drawer opened suddenly. He rushed to the source of the noise.
“Downstairs, go help them” The kids then rushed downstairs as Draco moved toward the larger room. He opened the door with his magic and rushed to his bed. He put Harry on it and then ran to the bathroom to puck his lunch.
“He doesn’t reject me!” Dimitri shouted, a little louder than he should have. The door marked "Zabini-Weasley" opened on Zachady and Jordan.
“I was just wondering how long we had to stay so that they have enough to tell Molly when she come home without her suspecting we were gone all night”
“Maybe I like him, but it doesn’t matter” He said after a silence and then he got up and went to another corner in the room. Harry frowned but didn’t follow him. Something was wrong on Zephir’s side and he wanted to find out what.
“We can sit here and discuss anything you want, if you want?” Lyra offered him. He nodded and as the three boys who were not part of the family were leaving, he told them to stay. They closed the door behind them and settled down on the floor.
“And don’t bring Harry's example! You know as well as me that he's been in love with Malfoy for a while!” The brunette could not deny, it was true.
“Apparently, this girl did something to Eleanor and our children are doing the interrogation. Rather violent, I might add” Harry explained, shrugging his shoulders.
He finally removed the blond's shirt and let his hands slide down the pale chest of the Slytherin. The latter took off Harry’s T-shirt and Harry moaned when he came to kiss his neck. The brunette made Draco moan while stroking one of his nipples and he chuckled. The blonde glared at him and as he kissed Harry again, he applied a slight pressure to Harry's crotch with his knee. His reaction wasn’t long, he gasped and moaned indecently. Because of his groan, they didn’t hear the voices in the corridor.
“No worries” Harry replied in a strangled voice that finally ended in a long moan as Draco moved slightly his hips with a smirk.
It was quiet for a few heartbeats, and the exhale Draco needed to steel himself sounded like a klaxon in the closed space.
Draco turned to see Harry standing behind him, his eyes wandering, obviously taking in the sight of Draco in his old haunt. They grinned at one another. He had an old wish granted then; the sight of Harry in his Common Room filled him. All that was missing is Harry’s uniform. Instead of it, Harry was wearing a tattered hoodie and frayed dark jeans – the clothes Draco saw him fall in.
"Well, then hurry up and kiss me already," Draco demands. "so you can stop being so bloody distracted."
Then at the end of the corridor, a boy appeared, his shock of black hair moving with the draft. Draco didn’t breathe for a few beats before the
finally written in Harry’s spiky handwriting. It was clearly written in a rush, and from the marks on the letter, it was written right here on the forest floor.
Draco still wasn’t sure saving Harry was a purely conscious decision. He had been so frightened, and his Aunt Bellatrix was in one of her more violent moods, his father in one of his more frightened ones. He was glad he had given his wand, even if at the time he feared for his life without it.
“Yes. Though, from what I understand, death was apparently preferable. And that is not something I say lightly as a Healer.”
"What will go away?" Narcissa asked, shook her head, bemused. She was leaning close, hand on his bicep, trying to see him. "Who will?"
"She gave me this today," Ginny says with a soft grin. "She made it herself, from the bones of some creature that I don't even remember the name of. It's ghastly, isn't it? But cute."
So, Draco did. On the gramophone, Draco turned a song up with the last vestiges of his magic, low and muffled at first as she sang,
; the first secrets Draco had really learned how to keep as a child. It was through Harry that he finally learned that coveting things could be painful. That
Here, Harry’s writing was noticeably more legible, as if he’d taken great care with the words written. Most of it was drivel, the day-to-day woes of a frustrated, hormonal teen boy.
He never understood why, had always thought he was the only one who felt this way, and so he kept his feelings locked away in a corner of himself. He only acted on what made sense to him, and that was his jealousy, his bitterness and resentment.
There was Potter, bright and solid, so much so that everything else paled in comparison to him. Just as it always had. It felt like Draco was floating in a dream of his own creation; nothing felt real then. Instead, it felt like he was in those small places where nightmare and fantasy roamed.
Draco saw Potter still sitting on the bed then. His head was in his hands, and he was curled in on himself. Potter had his eyes closed as if he was in pain.
Draco gestured for Harry to stop, but he kept moving. If it were possible, Draco could have sworn Harry had become paler then.
There was darkness too; the insidious feelings Harry described when Weasley dismissed him as a cheat was surprising, and juxtaposed what Draco knew of him thus far. Harry’s frustration and elation in the tournament, and everything in between. It struck how insane it was that Harry was put forward at all
"Right." Harry shakes his head. "I didn't think of that." He rubs the back of his neck awkwardly. He can't explain the irrational, roiling ache in his chest again, not too dissimilar to the one he'd felt seeing the Dursleys recoil away from him a very long time ago. "I guess I'll be going then—"
“It was Harry’s,” she said softly, still not looking at Draco. “It was the first one he caught, with his mouth – do you remember?”
The realisation made Draco’s stomach lurch slightly. This ghost, delusion, or illusion could not speak, and suddenly Draco was desperate to hear him again.
Harry tries to. He really does. But Draco's so warm and heavy against him. He can't think much right now beyond the heat of his back all over his torso, and if he leans his head closer, he can brush his lips against the skin of his neck. His arms are wrapped around the bottom of his ribcage, rising and falling with every breath. He can see his profile, his grey eyes sharp with intelligence and flickering with fast thoughts, his mouth moving and his hands gesturing, the way he pauses to recall, his brows furrowed and his lips curled in thought, and his chest hurts, looking at him, the beating of his heart slow and erratic in his throat. If he leans his head closer, and tilts Draco's head a little towards him, he can kiss him.
After the fit had calmed, Draco took a sip of water, and in the glass, red spittle diluted into pink. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and that came away red too.
Draco slowly moved towards him, hardly blinking as he stared at the complicated set of emotions Harry bared to him.
The top corner of the page had been ripped in haste obviously. The first lines of the text made little sense without context. But then about halfway down the paragraph, the piece began to explain itself.
“I wouldn’t ever Draco,” Lovegood said slowly, her voice not sounding like her own at all. “Not ever. Not to even those who would deserve it.”
These dreams made him realise how terribly in love Draco had been with Harry James Potter — a boy who had died to save them all. A boy who had died before Draco could be truthful with himself. All that time wasted over petty grievances instead.
Harry smiles, a little strained, letting him meet his gaze. "I know. But in my mind, you always pull away from me when I try to. I don't know how to get past that."
Draco comes forward and sits beside him slowly, his shoulder brushing against Harry's. Harry forces himself to relax against him.
Silently, he fell down into a fragile state of mind, neither alert nor entirely gone. His head felt as if someone was shaking and spinning him in tandem and he wanted it to stop. He’d give anything for it to stop.
Said librarian was now giving Draco concerned looks over her clipboard as he scoured the shelves of Hogwarts library — the largest in Wizarding Europe. Even Granger, for whom library equalled home, had seemed to note his constant presence and increasingly tense frame over the coming weeks.
Draco had stood there, stunned with shock and horrible grief, watching the chaos of others' grief unfolding; Granger's mournful cry as her hands shot to her mouth, Weasley's screams, mingling with the screams of his sister, Longbottom wide-eyed and shaking–
“You might have to be a tad more specific.” Draco sighed, as if not ready or willing to navigate Lovegood’s special brand of quirkiness.
So, when Draco felt and heard a light set of footsteps climb up this rather disused tower, he was instantly on his guard.
He drank in his fill of the boy in question. He tried to imagine being ‘cured’ of this, of being cut off from this wondrous, wonderful thing. He couldn’t. It didn’t bear thinking about. It dawned on him then how deep he’d fallen into the wanting needy thing inside him.
"Both of you always watched one another, always goading, going out of your way to make the other look. His eyes were always on you. And in fifth year, he was so different…’
Harry turned around to Draco, near the small bed, forehead to his, and a turn of his head, fingers on his arm,
Draco's lips quirk into a mellow smile. He takes Harry's face in his hands, closes his eyes and does just that.
," Ginny exclaims. Harry finally tears his gaze away from where Draco disappeared around the corner and looks at her. "
Draco would have to agree with them. He closed his eyes to the sensation of something standing right behind him, and the shivers the near touch was causing. Turning around wasn’t an option. Looking at Harry right then would have been an agony. Harry was a boy who didn’t live, who hadn’t deserved to die.
"I just... don't know how to respond most of the time. It doesn't mean that I don't like it. I just can't— I think I might still feel like people don't want to touch me. Which is...stupid, isn't it?" Harry huffs wryly. "Imagine destroying bloody
One I never got to have, or to hold. He’s dead, and I can’t get the image of him dying out of my head. I only ever got to hurt him when he was alive. He hated me!" At this Harry shook his head furiously. "And I don’t want him to be dead, I want him here, with me. But no. He was taken from me and now my soul is crumbling to dust without him."
Colours dominated the floor, in bright paths that seemed to connect the door to a couple of shower cubicles and then back round again to a set of lockers on the far left of the room. The Gryffindor rows. Draco wondered if he had ever seen colours so bright.
Classes started at half eight, and now it was eight thirty-two and Harry hadn’t even cleared the fourth-floor stairs. Hermione’s warning about casting a weak
He heard a few of the Slytherins snort, and his own housemates groan. But the noise his mind honed in on was a deep laugh, from a boy who sat to his left, just across the aisle.
Harry stills. He is so still that he's hardly breathing and maybe Draco notices, as he's leaning his face in towards his own, and he pauses. "May I kiss you?"
. Again, his touch phantasmal and feather light as he traced up the veins of his wrists, passing over the bruise on his skin.
“You’re here," Draco breathed. His skin rose with gooseflesh at the careful touch. It was then that the notion of his subconscious having fabricated
Draco was not invited to Harry Potter's funeral. But he dressed up in his best suit and stood in the far distance, far enough to not be seen, close enough to listen just so.
There were footprints on the floor when he looked closer, just as faint. His head hurt from the strain of trying to see them. He looked around to see if anybody else had noticed them. There were a few Ravenclaw students on another table, a Hufflepuff with a Gryffindor on another. None of them had noticed. Perhaps they were not there where they're sitting. He looked down again at the ground and realised that the footprints were leading to a trail.
"Luna," Ginny says, with a small, fond smile that she directs down at the ground. "I think she might like me too, but… you know. She's
Then, an elated smile bloomed on Potter’s features. Draco’s lips upturned as if dragged along with it. A tight sensation danced along his ribs, and his palms were not sweating despite the cool air of his dorm.
Draco rolls his eyes, but he doesn't say anything before he whips around and starts to walk, robes sweeping around at his ankles.
"Oh, of course. Of course, it's you." It took him several seconds to recognise the quivering voice coming from below him. He lowered his eyes to find a bushy brown mop of hair. Granger. Her hands were fluttering to pick up her books, her breaths fast and angry, like knocking into him had just knocked her over into near breaking point. "Just what I needed."
And then he was waking up in the infirmary, Luna and Goyle next to him. His headache was back to a bearable level. Goyle left through the curtains and came back with Madam Pomfrey.
Malfoy’s whistle quietened. With a tap of his wand, a charmed piece of parchment floated towards Harry. It landed on his desk, innocent and unassuming, but Harry still handled it like it was a bomb.
Not when I’m still…” It was difficult to tether himself, to return to the quiet contentment he’d felt before he started seeing this boy in the shadows once more.
Draco struggled to voice the deep rumble of happiness, fear, wanting, and need that was rolling through him in that moment.
But Draco waves a beckoning hand over at him, then, scooting backwards on the mattress. "Lie down on the bed."
Draco turned to his mother, whose eyes seemed so deep and sorrowful in that moment that he knew his mother already considered his choice made.
Then, another trembling breath, his hands trembling too. Draco stepped back, finding himself shaking his head and whispering as he was turning away quickly, frantically,  “I can’t, I can’t–"
Draco thought she didn’t realise that her inability to talk about him, his preferences, was more hurtful than anything a stranger could conjure up.
Harry lowers down to sit at the foot of his bed, clasping his hands between his lap. He shifts, looking down at his shoes.
The whirls of the winds rustled Draco's hair and clothes, the leaves on the branches above his head. They carried a familiar, bright laughter amidst its whistle to his ears, echoing back in memory from across Great Halls and classrooms. Draco frowned, his head cocking, blinking in bemusement.  His eyes traversed around for the source, but it wasn't found.
A short sharp movement to his left, and then Harry was in Draco’s face. Trying not to flinch, he quickly looked to Harry. Draco did flinch then, Harry looked
Draco stares at him for a long moment. He shakes his head. "I don't understand. You—you lived with your relatives, did you not? Your mother's sister?"
"No, Granger. Keep it. It’s yours," Draco said, even though he coveted anything that was once Harry’s. But it seemed like it meant dearly to her, that it was one of the few things she had of him left.
It was only then, somehow, that Draco realised Harry was not wearing glasses. Hs green eyes were staring at him.
The first week or two was so silent here that it was almost unbearable, but now there was a chorus of conversation filling up Hogwarts, the world stabilising into itself.  There was the sound of winds, of rustling trees, of laughter, the pitter-patter of water droplets, the smell of fresh plants, of wet mud and rain.
this one was angry, quill lines depressing groves into paper, torn into an irregular line at the end of the last word. Draco couldn't entirely tell what this was for. Perhaps it was for his attempts to get the hippogriff culled?
“When you do, you should follow a specific set. His last. You’ll find what he’s left behind, although it’s a bit mulchy this time of year, so I’d wear your best walking boots," Luna said conversationally, as if she wasn’t potentially discussing Draco’s real — not — real delusions aloud.
“Hmm. Well, you seem to have magical exhaustion," she said as her eyes still searched his face. For what, Draco wasn’t sure. “Your wand was checked, and no spell listed accounts for your symptoms. Thus, we will be keeping a close eye on you from now on. At the moment, your core is stable. So, you are free to return to your
Warm water stung down his back, mottled with yellowing bruises and dark scabs. This was courtesy of three seventh year boys. They blamed him for Potter’s death, saying that Draco brought the devil to the door, that he helped the madman kill their friends, family, and loved ones.
against the heated softness of it, pulling them closer, as if he could meld with the boy in front of him and never part. He grabbed onto Harry like a man dying, and in that fleeting moment, he was.
‘Harry’s – it’s a Potions book both he and Snape have written in. Harry thought he had hidden it well, but I’ve always had a knack for finding lost things in lost places.’
His mother then pulled him into a fierce hug then. She was trembling along with him, and he felt his hair soak wet.
She might have been referring to Draco’s almost constant mute companion, but he couldn't be sure. Nothing else of what she had said made any sense. But Draco was observant and knew that Lovegood wasn’t a basket case. She merely presented herself as one. Too much of what she had said to him in the dungeons had stuck or unravelled into some terrifying kind of sense afterwards.
Things like these, with time, became easy and comfortable with her. She became one of the few people in his life that he'd grown used to the touch of. He isn't sure if she had ever noticed that he never initiated any of it, how he stilled under her hands in the beginning of their relationship, but he also knows she believes most boys don't like that sort of thing as much as they like sex.
Harry doesn't move. He can't. He rovers his eyes over him, all wonderful and his. His breaths feel light, shallow through his nose.
Slowly, a tear fell, and before he knew it, a scream tore out of him. Even to Draco’s ears, it was an awful sound, one that made his ribcage burn and shake, his throat pained and raw.
Draco didn’t reply. There was nothing worth saying anyway. He found his shirt and trousers neatly folded on the bedside table. He rushed in silence whilst careful eyes watched every move he made.
"I, er… I do like it when you do those things. I think about it all the time. Touching you. Being the first to, I mean. Just holding your hand in class or—It drives me mad sometimes, how much I—" He stops there, trailing off. He shifts his jaw, setting it tight.
Harry frowns at those cryptic words, and even more so at the reversion to surnames. He makes a point to ask him later.
The day started with him in a particular state of malaise, all the joints in his body feeling sore and attached the wrong way. The weakness pushed him down into the mattress, the weight of his head leaden.
Lovegood extended an arm out, as if she wanted to touch and soothe Draco’s decidedly stressed features.
Harry ran ahead of him, laughing silently as he led Draco to a door, one that had thousands of golden-brown handprints on it, blazing brightly around the handle, and at the door’s base where Harry had clearly kicked the thing open.
"Not like it's a secret, the two of us." Draco nods at the portrait of the sleeping Fat Lady. "Will she allow me in?"
It's something that makes him grin broadly just upon the sight of him, makes his heart and the blood in his veins sing when he sees him moving towards him to talk to him, pale eyebrows bouncing as he comes to a stop in front of him.
Coming to a stop outside the portrait of the Fat Lady, Draco releases his hand, sliding it down his palm, catching on his fingers before letting go, and says, "Good night, Harry." And then he leans in and kisses his cheek, and Harry is left brimming with a familiar, aching longing.
Looking at Draco Malfoy, one will never assume he's much for such sentimental displays. Harry certainly didn't. There is nothing tender about him, after all, what with how he generally seems cold and callous and unapproachable in his resting state, all smirks and snark and snide remarks. Anyone putting unwanted hands on his prim and pristine self are met with an icy glare, a cocked and haughty eyebrow, until they retreat from him.
That night, he woke up to Harry's hand in the dark, smoothing a knuckle down his cheek, nails running thinly at his hair, so delicate it was barely there. His other arm was around Draco's waist, legs tangled up with his, and he had that crease between his brows again, always so worried and sad, watching him silently.
Slughorn followed it, his expression confused and agitated as he searched for what Draco was looking at.
With furrowed brows, he returned to his seat and opened it to the first page, his mind rolling over the strange sensations the book seemed to be causing.
"You're sick all the time. Sometimes you get so sick that it— well. It fucking scares me. Because it feels like you're..."
Draco closed his eyes against the thick, black shame that curdled in his gut. Turning away from her, he stumbled to his own rooms.
The coloured footsteps led him into the Forbidden Forest. There was the rush of the wind, and in the silence, he could hear the amplified sound of his own steps crunching dried leaves under his shoes.
He couldn’t capture anything, except for the song that was now stuck in his head, looping around and around until Harry held his temples, as if this would stop it.
These were the second last set of Harry's footsteps. They were taking him towards the very last piece of his life that he could have, and Draco was thinking of him here, in this Forest where he last stood, facing the evil madman that took him away so that he could save them all.
“I’d forgotten how you sounded.” Draco stated, and tears pricked behind his eyes. “I couldn’t hear it in my head anymore.” His voice trembled. "After all those years of listening to it, and it faded so quickly.” Draco swallowed against the jarred breaths in his chest. “And the rest are trying to forget you
he wanted to quip, but the horrid sensation in his chest wouldn’t let him. Every word felt precious, and Draco would be damned if he spent one moment of this spewing spite.
The dormitory erupts into uproar, a chorus of howling wolf whistles and catcalls and guffaws of laughter when Draco crawls inside onto Harry's bed, all dignified and straight-backed until he turns around on his knees and flips them all off with both hands, a thin, satirical smile on his lips, and then jerks the curtains closed to Seamus and Dean's laughing faces. He casts
The sensation of crawling inside his own skin had Draco rolling his neck in discomfort and clenching his fists until the whites of  his knuckles turned blue. He moved over the expansive Hogwarts grounds with hastened strides to the edge of the grounds. The Quidditch pitch towers slowly came into view.
