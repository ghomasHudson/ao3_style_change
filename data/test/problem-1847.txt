“Almost… Draco, I’m sorry. And you know I love you, you know I do.”

The clench of his hungry stomach shook him out of his musing. Shaking off the feeling of dread, he continued his walk, eventually stepping into the almost suffocating warmth of the castle.
“I am!”
Harry cut directly to the point. "Is there something I can help you with?" he asked as he stood up.

With a chuckle, Draco simply stalked off, leaving Harry in his place, blushing deeper and darker as the seconds passed. And if Harry

, and Draco--
For the first time since Ron’s blurt, Harry looks up from his lap, meeting Hermione’s eyes across the table. If the swift inhale she snatches from the air is any indication, the horror Harry feels must be reflected in his gaze. He looks back down with wide, gleaming eyes.
Harry simply half-shrugs with his right shoulder, shaking his head but still avoiding everyone’s gaze. Moving past the freeze response, he blindly reaches for his glass, holding it under the table and staring down into the liquid. Occasionally, he shifts the ice cubes around the cup, but the silence persists.
The deep growl of his stomach pulled Harry out of the fretting stupor he had again fallen into. More cautiously than before, he shuffled down the corridor, toiling what-ifs around in his head.
And yet, here they were.
. You hardly ever tell me anything important anymore. Is this why? You didn’t wanna slip up and spill your big secret? You don’t tell me the important things--” Harry’s face contorts and his eyes grow narrow. Draco knows he’s about to retort, but right now he means what he’s saying, and feels like he needs to say it, “
“God, Draco,” bursts Harry, his voice imploring and his grasp desperate as he grips Draco by the wrist, holding their conjoined hands close to his chest, "Draco. I’m sorry. I am, I

For the sheer amount of times he distantly wondered how different this all would’ve been if he had been there during their Hogwarts years. For the way none of them could have possibly been there during Harry’s childhood years. For the reality that he can’t be pinned for anything that the man he wants to marry has been through, but the sorrow with which he still holds those traumas so close runs rampant.

Again, Harry shrugs.
good for Harry. He remembers the smile that had split Harry’s face when Draco had reached out for a handshake, remembers the relief that had relaxed Malfoy’s shoulders when Ron offered his congratulations on the relationship.
What impulses him, the others can only guess at. But after several anguished heartbeats of quiet, Harry takes a long breath, as steady as it can be between the sobs that had begun to plague him from the moment Draco had disrupted their point of contact.
Perhaps by Draco’s projection, but the coo of her voice is almost paternal in its tenderness, and it further agitates the ache that’s been steadily brimming in Draco’s chest.
The sly smile plastered across her face immediately spiked Harry’s suspicion, and he reflexively stepped back, hand twitching for his wand.

Beside him, Hermione trembles with seemingly the same effort.
Distracted by his own thought, Harry dropped his outstretched arm and shrugged his left shoulder as if to say, ‘I guess.’
“Draco–“
” Draco snarls, snatching Harry’s hand off his leg and tugging the brunet to fully face him.
Apprehension and curiosity fought for dominance in Harry’s thoughts. Harry looked Malfoy directly in the eye, searching for any flicker of malice. Randomly, Harry wondered if Malfoy’s eyes had always had those slivers of blue within the grey.
“I know you’re fucking sorry, Harry. I know! Of course you are! Of course you are, are you sorry for what happened? You’re probably sorry for not telling me, aren’t you? Is that all? That’s it, Harry? You’re sorry because you knew you were sick and you didn’t tell me. You’re sorry that you were attacked, even though I told you, I
As soon as Remus started walking to the table he had to stop himself from gawking at the sight that greeted him. He thought Harry was right with the posh blonde boy named Draco and he was confused when Harry said the man with him was his type since posh was most definitely not his type but the man that Remus saw was incredibly hot.
Draco lightly hit him on the head, "Oi! Quit teasing me!" He rolled his eyes, "What were you thinking about so hard?"
Moody scowled, "That's impossible!"
They were a bit paranoid about security.
Sirius kisses Remus out of the blue. They don't talk about it.

The kids that were there consisted of the youngest Potter, Nicolas, his two best friends, Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley, and the twins, Fred, and George. They were supposed to be going to Diagon Alley to get their school supplies today, but Dumbledore called a last-minute private Order Meeting. The only reason they were allowed to stay was that they were going to be meeting the new people either way.
"R-Remus, I-I'm so, so close. I- I'm gonna," He couldn't finish his sentence from Remus again taking the entire cock in his mouth, not stopping even from Sirius's warning.
Ginny shook her head, a little shocked that he actually answered her, but she wasn't going to stop talking first, "Yeah I guess but I rather be called Ginny. Ginevra is an old person's name."
Draco rolled off of him and sighed contently before getting up, "We have to get dressed first. We're meeting with the order at 12:00, it's 10:30 now. You took a shower last night?"
The ships are obviously Drarry and Wolfstar but there might be some background ships like Jily or Romione. The main ships also might date other people just for some ✨spice✨.
James had long got over his hatred for Snape but seeing him look at his son like he like he was
There will not be too many POV switches. The entire story is in 3rd person but as it does in the regular Harry Potter the story focuses on Harry. I occasionally might do a switch to see what Dumbledore or someone like that is thinking but not often.
He got nods in return and simultaneously they all reached up to take off their masks,
Remus sniffled, "But Lily and James should be the best parents he would ever have. Not us."
That brought another round of laughter.
Draco slapped his chest lightly, "Of course it is!" He blinked prettily, "You got to wake up to me kissing you. What's better than that?"
Sirius moaned again and he nodded quickly, "Oh,
Sirius let go of Remus who pouted, to pull Harry into a hug, "Yes I am, pup! Did you have fun with Moony?"
They came to a stop at their table and Remus set Sirius's hot chocolate with the extra whipped cream in front of him but Sirius and Draco were still too focused on them to notice.
Silence. That was all there was in the Hall. Everyone was stunned into silence. The people couldn't believe that the lights savior, Dumbledore's man through and through was on the dark side nevermind the dark lords' son.
He continued, "He must be desperate if he's calling us, and he knows we use dark magic. Besides no matter how much I don't want to the Potters, how much Ron doesn't want to see the Weasley's and how much Draco doesn't want to see the Malfoy's we can't let like 1000 students get hurt because of our pettiness."
Draco glared, "Don't give me that bullshit, Siri. You'll find someone to treat you like the princess you are."
"-rry, Harry? Are you all there? I thought you would be more excited about this." Voldemort was looking him with concern along with Bella, Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco.
else, "You think me and Padfoot are your dad's Harry?"
Remus moaned, "Go ahead and cum Sirius. Just from my cock."
"I think what Hadrian said is perfectly acceptable. If he didn't say you could stay, then you may exit the building. I will inform you when the next Order meeting is."
Hadrian paused in buttoning up his jeans and looked and Draco who was looking at the ground, "What?"
"How did you know?" Severus, who had been quiet for the most part, was the one who asked.
"Oh!" Harry smiled knowingly, "I always listen to my daddies!"
Remus choked on his sandwich, "What did you say, Harry?"
There could be a sequel depending on how this story goes.
The man smiled, "My name is Draco, Draco Malfoy. Could I ask for your name, darling?'
After staring at the man, really getting to look at him, Harry got the impression he wasn't to be messed with but wasn't...bad, at least not for him. His skin was tanned, and he had stringy brown hair, and he wore really run-down clothes. At first glance, he looked like another homeless person, but Harry knew how to look at people. If you looked him in his face, despite the rest of his appearance you could tell, he wasn't to be messed with. He had many scars, not like his Uncle Remus's but from a battle. And he had a slight accent when he spoke, but Harry didn't know where it was from.
Once the target finally reached his home, Hadrian followed him inside and came out of the shadows waiting to be noticed. It didn't take long.
They didn't need to talk about what just happened, because what just happened was perfect.
When he was finally let in, his sister, Hermione instantly ran up to him to enforce him into a hug before she stopped at the sight of blood staining his clothes. She folded her arms in a disapproving manner.
Nicolas missed his brother. Sure, he had Neville and the twins who acted like older brothers to him, but it wasn't the same. He missed his brother who tucked him in at night, who never got mad at the attention he had, who made sure he was comfortable with all the fame. He loved his parents but would never forgive them for causing him to leave.
Remus was fighting to keep a grin off his face, "Well, Mr Black, my name is Remus Lupin. It was a pleasure to meet you."
Harry sighed and waved his hand, they were all silenced instantly, "Will you let me explain before you guys go all crazy?" He was met with silence again, "Great, now first let me explain to you the reason Voldemort became Voldemort." And that's what Harry did, Harry explained every single detail to his fathers' life and how Dumbledore involvement made him slowly go insane with fear. After that, Harry explained to all of them how Dumbledore narrated his life along with Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Mrs and Mr Weasley involvement in it. He expressed his feelings and his hurt when he realized they were tricking him, how he just wanted friends, how he would've given him his money if they just asked, how he would've died for them but that's what they wanted.
James and Lily knew they were the reason he left. They hadn't thought of him until he left. All their attention went to Nicolas, they got caught up in the fame and their poor son couldn't take it anymore. It had been exactly 8 years since he left. The last straw was when they forgot his birthday.
Flashback
Hermione sniffled, "Yeah well... anyways what do you think about Dumbledore?"
," He spat her name with all the hatred for her he could muster, which was a lot, "You have lost any right to call yourself my mother the second I left your house. Now my
The only girl that was with them seemed to be the scariest. She had on purple shorts with black leggings underneath them. She had on a pair of short spiky boots and was wearing a black leather hoodie with a lot of zippers. She seemed bored and you would've thought that if it wasn't for her eyes that seemed to be zooming all over the building for anything she could find. Her mask only served to scare them further and it looked like she knew it. She radiated strength.
Hadrian studied his brother, the only person he truly missed. He had his mother’s hair, but it was just as messy as his. He had James's light brown eyes but other than that he looked like a female version of Lily. His brother's face was portraying so many emotions, anger, determination, sadness, but the one that Hadrian recognized the most was admiration. His little brother still admired him. Hadrian had to look away before he started to tear up. He looked at the other Potter's guilty faces, but he felt no sympathy. He knew they would talk soon but for now, let them suffer a little more.
The next day Hadrian woke up to butterfly kisses everywhere from his boyfriend. He opened his eyes and saw Draco looking into them lovingly, "Happy birthday, darling."
Remus removed himself from Sirius's hold and looked him in the face, "He thinks of us as his dads Siri. That should be James's job, not ours. You should be the cool uncle and I should be the sneaky one. We should just be Moony and Padfoot, not Dad."
Slowly, but surely, Remus was brought out of the past and back to Sirius.
Remus smiled soothingly but his eyes gave away his mirth, "Calm down Harry. I'm sure you were fine."
Harry ran to him and hugged him so tightly. He was so done with all of this, "I'm so tired of pretending. It's too much!"
He put a smile on his face and told Draco, "I hope everything is to your liking." Before he turned back to the other man and stopped himself from taking a deep breath, "I'm sorry sir, but your hot chocolate will take a bit longer since I had already packed up the whipped cream and have to go get it. Unless you don't want any?"
Unfortunately, Harry had a habit of talking during each movie.
There was a pop, and they were gone.
"Long story short, Marcus helped me train and along the way, I found Draco, Ron and Hermione. My family."
When Hadrian and Draco finally entered the room their masks in their hands. Hermine and Ron were making their plates. Once they saw the two boys, they stopped what they were doing and everyone shared eye contact, asking the same thing,
Wait, what?
Hadrian raised an eyebrow, and his face had his natural smirk, his arms opened invitingly still looking at Nicolas, "Well? Did you miss me, Nico?"
------------
Once breakfast was done, they all stood and grabbed their masks and put them on. It was time. They made their way out the door and grabbed hands, ready to apparate
Once they reached the bed, Remus threw Sirius down rather roughly but it seemed Sirius liked that because he only pulled Remus down with him even rougher.
Harry nodded determinedly, "They are too hot to let this pass.
Which character's backstory would you want me to make a chapter for first?
Everyone in the Order was entranced in his story, the Potter's especially, trying to get any details about their son and brothers' life. Nicolas looked up at his brother, whose face was indifferent, but his eyes seemed to be filled with a lot of mixed emotions that he couldn't decipher, "How did you know Marcus wasn't bad?"
After the emotions were done and they were back in their seats, they sat in silence for a while before Harry broke it, "So am I gonna call you daddy now?"
I DO NOT SUPPORT J.K. ROWLING AT ALL AND DOBBY WROTE THE BOOKS!
There will be a brief summary for each chapter, no spoilers!
Hadrian saw his target from miles away. He knew that he could've killed him from this distance, but Hadrian thought he deserved a bit more suffering than that. Hadrian stayed in the shadows as he started trailing his target to his apartment unnoticed.
The blonde smirked, "Spoken like a true Slytherin. Besides, he doesn't look like a snake anymore, nor is he crazy."
AU: Muggle Coffee Shop (All authors of fanfic must write it!)
Remus dipped his head in agreement before opening the doors.
Dumbledore responded this time, still with that annoying smile on his face, "We'll take what we can get. We all want to know more about you, you've been gone for so long." The older wizard said the last part with a small frown as if it was his fault he wanted to stay away. The assassins wanted to punch him.
The entire Order group wasn't there, only Lily and James Potter, Frank and Alice Longbottom, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Molly and Arthur Weasley, Ted, and Andromeda Tonks along with their daughter Nymphadora, Kingsley Shaklebolt, Alastor Moody, Minerva McGonagall, and of course, Albus Dumbledore.
Hermione sat forward, "Actually there is. There are some demands we have."
Ron laughed, "Can you even blame him? I sure as hell would've done the same thing. No bastard like that should live a happy life or die a peaceful death."
Harry, who finally tore his eyes away from the hot man, wrote everything down. He looked back up to the man who seemed to be checking him out, but that could just be his imagination. Harry gave a nervous cough and the man looked back to his face and rose an eyebrow and Harry took a deep breath, "Could- could I get a name for the order?"
Dumbledore stroked his beard, "You were going to say his name. Does that mean you don't work for him?"
Hadrian raised an eyebrow, "What's up?"
Draco sneered, "Of course I did! You know how long it takes me to pack."
Harry nodded seriously, "Moony and Padfoot always say be polite, and Harry always listens to his daddies."
Remus watched Sirius's reaction and watched as his mouth was open in a half moan and his eyes were close shut in pleasure. Remus was pleased, "You like that don't you Sirius?"
The room stayed silent as the Order surveyed the infamous assassin group and the four assassins stared down the Order. The silence broke when the one in the blue mask spoke,
Sirius gave a sorrowful chuckle, "I'm over Peter, I really am. I'm just not sure if I can find someone again."
Hermione pulled them all into a hug, "Thank you guys, really."
Remus, who didn't have a gag reflex, took the whole thing in his mouth and moaned, loving the taste of Sirius.
(I apologize in advance, it was my first smut)
Dumbledore nodded, "If you would care too."
The blonde man smirked and Harry fell in love right there, "No need to apologize, love, it's ok. I would like a hot green tea with mint and he," He jerked his head over to the man he was with, "would like a hot chocolate." The man whispered something in the blonde's ear and he rolled his eyes, "With extra whipped cream."
PLEASEEEEE! Why is this soooo long!? (Well not really it just took forever lol) Anyone I hoped you liked it! let me know if you guys want me to publish more chapters!
Hermione shook her head, "I know Hadrian, but we can't just go around torturing people. I understand he deserved it, but I- I just don't want that to be your only way to solve things."
Flashback
, he thought.
Nicolas looked up at his brother who still had him in a one-armed hug, "How did you all become assassins?"
Harry never thought he would see a day where Voldemort looked nervous but he obviously did here. Voldemort didn't have his glamour on at the moment so you could see the vulnerably in his face and Harry had the urge to hug him, "Harry, please tell me how you are faring here, are you completely happy."
Hermione wiped the tears from his cheek, "You were you."
Sorry if the speech doesn't sound British, I'm from the U.S. unfortunately.
I do take request so please message me if you want anything specific like any kinks or time period you guys want. The things that I won't write about is watersports and rape. I will always credit and tag you if you do suggest an idea.
Sirius gasped again, "Please... please fuck me.
Oh yes, Dumbledore paid them to watch him, he knew of the abuse, of course, he didn't encourage it, but neither did he stop them. Harry's friends knew too. How could they not? Hermione must've noticed his eating habits she has an eye for things like that and Ron, well Ron saw the bars on his window and did nothing. Fred and George, bless them, tried to tell someone, anyone, their mom, dad, and obviously Dumbledore; they were brushed to the side.
Ron has high self-esteem and knows he is great. He isn't cocky but is confident. He obviously is powerful and unlike his parents, he doesn't follow Dumbledore blindly. He trusts easier than others and voices his opinion. He doesn't let things just happen to him and will speak up.
Draco had that knowing look on his face and echoed Sirius's earlier words, "What was that all about Siripoo."
Voldemort nodded once then stood up to walk towards him, "It would be an honor to have you as a son, of course, you don't have to accept, and I'll still see you like one but it wouldn't be official and obviously you wouldn't call me father or dad but it would make a diff-"
--------------------------
The doors burst open and they walked in their formation. Harry and Draco in the front with Fred and George in the very back, Luna, Neville, Blaise were directly behind Harry and Draco with Pansy and Theo after them. They looked like bosses.
, we'll be there."
"Shit! Oh,
Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Ron and Hermione were already dressed, their masks sitting on the kitchen counter. It was quiet except for the sounds of Ron cooking, and though it was a peaceful silence, there still was a nervous feeling in the air.
Consider Harry's interest peaked, "Tell me! Draco what is it! Dray! Draco Lucius Malfoy! Dragon!"
Draco laughed, "Yes Harry, only yours."
Remus reached Sirius's nipple and before licking it, he looked up at Sirius to see him watching Remus with anticipation. Remus gave his attention back to the hard nipple that seemed to be begging him to lick it so he did.
Hadrian laughed and shoved him off, "Get off of me! I wanna see what Ron cooked for me."

Remus quickly put one more finger in because he was rather large and he continued to watch Sirius become a moaning mess underneath him.
Before the summer, Luna told him to wait, the Nargles told her, something good was coming for me soon and before she walked away she whispered, "And I would follow you anywhere, my lord, the rest of your people will too."
-------------------------------------
Remus shook his head, "No, no, the last part Harry."
Draco nodded to himself and looked back into Harry's eyes who seemed to be waiting for something and Draco smiled and kissed his cheek, "You look wonderful, darling."
Hadrian ran a hand through his hair, "Seeing Nicolas again was everything to me and I did miss Sev but my parents, it's just ridiculous on how they think everything can go back to normal is laughable but makes me want to stab them all at once."
They both turned to see an elderly couple behind them glaring and they quickly turned around again.
Please comment because I will respond no matter what and I love seeing the comments.
Harry was taken aback by the question, was that why he was so nervous? Harry beamed at him, "I'm doing amazing, really! I have so many people who truly care about me here. All of you actually consider my ideas unlike Hermione and none of you get mad for pointless reasons like Ron and- and wow- you all truly- truly trust me, unlike whatever Dumbledore said." Then Harry stared Voldemort right in the eye, "I really wanna thank you Voldemort, you- you really helped me, took me in and listened to me, Dumbledore never really did...I really appreciate you." Then he smirked, "and with your help, I'm going to get revenge on everyone who wronged me."
When Harry was done everyone was staring with mixed emotion, most with sadness and anger for him, there were very few with disbelief. Everyone instantly turned on Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Mr and Mrs Weasley, and Dumbledore and started screaming at them before Dumbledore had enough, "It is obvious Harry has been compelled to say all of this, come back to the light my boy and we will help you."
Anyways, Remus had taken Harry in when he was at least 7 when he noticed James wasn't the same as he used to be. Harry had taken to calling Remus, papa and Remus considered Harry his son.
It was quiet for a while after Sirius's last comment before Remus sighed, "Thank you. It- it just caught me off guard to hear that."
"H-how are you doing? How do you feel?"
Harry took the offered hand and blushed again but nodded too, "Alright Draco... you can call me Harry."
They seemed to snap the Order out of their frenzy and some of them reached for their wands and Moody bellowed, "How the hell did you get in here?!"
Harry looked at him incredulously, "That's what you're worried about? I trust you and I care a lot for you in this past week, I've got to know you, the real you, not whatever Dumbledore tried to tell me."
Draco, who was on the phone peaked his head out through the doorway, "Sorry, love! Be there in a minute!"
Remus made himself a grilled cheese while Harry was eating Bananas and yogurt. Remus looked over to Harry and a soft chuckle escaped his mouth when he saw the yogurt all over his face. "Do you like your food, cub?"
Draco shushed him, "I know my love, it'll all be over soon. That I can promise you."
"Please Harry, I can hear it I promise!" Nicolas begged and then added quieter, "I want to get to know you more."
"Well go on then, we don't want to interrupt your meeting."
A few tears slipped from his eyes, "Let's finish getting dressed."
Harry blinked but then winked, "You can go as hard as you want love, I wouldn't mind."
Harry sighed and sat down on his bed; not his real one. The one he had to stay at when Dumbledore and his minions were watching him. Not that the Dursley's cared... or were alive, but Dumbledore believed they were and that's what mattered.
When the movie ended and they were on their way to the restaurant, the time was 9:15 since Harry insisted on staying for the end credits and who was Draco to deny the birthday boy, Harry wouldn't stop talking about the movie and how much he loved it. Draco let him talk and didn't interrupt, even though he knew the movie like the back of his hand.
Remus turned back to go to the storage room which was near the backroom and retrieve the whipped cream and he was almost out of their sight when he heard the words, "Indeed it was!"
Sirius let out a cry while nodding his head fast, "
He didn't say thank you and Hadrian didn't need to hear it. They got their points across.
Both walked up straight to Voldemort, not caring that they interrupted the meeting and bowed on one knee and said simultaneously, "My lord."
Harry nodded excitedly, "Yeah! We had bunch of fun!" They let him ramble about his day and tire himself out, only stopping him when he let out a yawn.
Draco answered this time, "Well let's see, Hadrian was neglected by his family, I was abused, Hermione was bullied, and her parents did nothing, and Ron, well Ron's family was simply shit, excluding Ginevra of course." He counted off the reasons on his fingers and said them like they were nothing.
"How did he even know how to contact us?" His voice was low and calm. This did not reassure them he was fine.
Hadrian almost raised another eyebrow at the obvious attempt of distracting him but decided to indulge them, "It went well. I kinda lost my temper though."
Hadrian wanted to scold his brother for calling him...
They all sat at the table and ate in silence and peace. Even with the suspense with what was coming up, they were content with just being there with each other.
Remus at the moment was even more upset. He couldn't focus on his notes because all he could think about was Sirius. Oh,
"How dare you!"
"Sirius, what are you doing here?" Remus sighed and tried to turn the chair back around but was confused when Sirius used both hands and stopped him, "Sirius, what the hell are you doing?"
Draco suddenly pulled Harry in for a passionate kiss and Harry eagerly responded. Draco was about to apparate to the Weasley's before a voice in his head, that sounded suspiciously like Hermione's said,
Italics: Parseltongue and an Emphasis on Words
Voldemort grinned, "We're going to be taking over Hogwarts tomorrow, we already have the Ministry from Lucius being the Minister, but from your twins' invention, we are going to be the only people with magic. You're gonna walk in with your army with all of your hoods up, in your formation obviously, then once Dumbledore asks the question you're gonna spin, pull your hood down and say, "I'm the Dark Prince or as you all know me as Harry Potter."
"MALFOY!"
"They won't ruin you, Ron. We won't let it happen. If some parts of you get broken, we'll fix them, but nothing will be ruined. Whatever they say, whatever they do, it won't mean anything because they aren't your family. We are. Their words don't matter. Ours do. Do you understand?"
Harry's fingers travelled up to Draco's half-buttoned shirt and wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, And how will you take care of me, my Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
Severus breathed.
The accused victims wanted to say something to defend themselves but what were they supposed to say? Everything that the Malfoy child said was true. They again tried to think of questions that could make them seem better, but this time Ginny asked, "Why'd you come back if you didn't want to see us?"
Hadrian clapped and smiled playfully, "That's the spirit, love!"
Everyone in the group has high intelligence and has traits of all four houses. They also love each other more than anything. They grew up together. They are very powerful.
Remus's fingers trailed down to Sirius arse and one finger was hovering over his entrance. Before, putting it in, Remus broke the kiss apart and looked to Sirius for consent once again. Sirius nodded and that was all Remus needed to push his finger inside, moving in and out.
Remus, it- it feels
"Are you sure? You can talk to me, love."
Remus was curled up in the corner of their queen-sized bed and wrapped in a blanket. The lights were dimmed to the point of almost off. Remus's eyes were squeezed shut and had tear lines running down his face.
They finished dinner at 10:50 and that left Draco 10 minutes at a loss of what to do. Fortunately, Harry pulled him into an alley and they had a good snogging session for a good 10 minutes. Unfortunately, Draco forget about the party again and let Harry apparate them to the Burrow with Harry's shirt still up his neck and Draco's hands feeling his chest
-----------------
They both frantically pulled at each others' clothes until Remus was naked and Sirius had only who boxers on. They just admired each other for a while before Remus pushed Sirius down and started to kiss him again.
Harry had an answer... but he decided against it, instead he said, "The time you asked me to be yours. I seem to be thinking a lot today."
Silence followed that statement and Draco, Ron, and Hermione all stared at Hadrian trying to see how he would react. Finally, he spoke,
I had fun writing this one and got a bit carried away :)
Dumbledore smiled, "Happy to hear that, might we interest you in a seat. We have a lot to discuss."
The man stared at Hadrian with horror in his eyes, "L- look! Y- you got the wrong person! I didn't do anything." He pleaded.
Next came the Reunion. (At least the start of it)
Ship: Wolfstar
Sirius let out a gasp before a louder moan escaped and Remus loved the sound. He continued to move around Sirius's neck and marking him before moving his mouth down to his chest.
Harry grinned then clapped, "Well we're not here to fight seeing as you guys don't have magic... I don't want to hurt any of you guys except for a select few. Would you guys like me to explain before I kill my select few and my team takes their pick?
This is different from most of my stories, which usually have Hermione bashed, but I want a dark Hermione and refuse to have her dark without Ron.
Dumbledore peered at him through his glasses, eyes no longer sparkling knowing he lost, "And why don't you tell me?"
He first started off with just licking that nipple before he decided to suck on this too. He continued for a while before deciding to switch to the other one where he eagerly did the same thing and moved his hand to the one he was just on and twisting it.
But what Remus didn't know was that Sirius Black came to a very startling realization this year. He was gay and very much gay for Remus. He always wondered why it didn't feel great whenever he snogged or shagged a girl but then when he was out at a pub one night over the summer, he grabbed some guy and snogged him silly.
It's Draco's job to keep Harry out for the Surprise.
He missed Draco... he missed the way he ran his fingers through his hair and peppered him in kisses and spoke to him in French and called him 'my love' and 'my darling'. He missed his boyfriend dearly.
---------------
"Would you like to become mine?"
Draco's scowl died down and his eyes took on a warmer look, "Don't say that Siri, I'm sure you'll find someone better than the son of a bitch that cheated on you."
'And he'd never be interested in you' Thought his brain. Oh, there was a chance that he, Sirius Black, could date Remus seeing as he was bisexual, but Sirius never had the courage to say anything about it. Sirius wasn't much of a talker.
He nodded once and left with the parting words, "Well, happy birthday to me I guess."
and a 1 to signify he was the one to kill. After that, he apparated to his home with his family.
Hadrian scowled playfully, "I always shower before missions? Did you pack?"
Malfoy looked concerned for a moment, before going back to his impassive mask, "Calm down Potter, he doesn't want your harm at the moment, he just wants to talk."
Harry stopped talking.
Harry gave a toothy grin, "Real good Moony! Thank you!"
Harry didn't know what Luna meant when she was talking to him... he certainly wasn't anyone's lord, that was Voldemort's job. Even though while he started to drift off to sleep he wondered what it would be like... to have that power.
Harry stared at his team that consisted of his protection squad along with his army, His father thought it was an absolute necessity that he has his own squad just like he does. That people in that said 'squad' were Harry's closest friends also known as, Luna Lovegood, her boyfriends who are Blaise Zabini and Neville Longbottom, Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott, Fred and George Weasley and of course Harry's boyfriend and right hand, Draco Malfoy. (A/N- I couldn't decide if I wanted Nuna or Bleville so I decided to combine them *shrugs* good solution to me.)
The playful spirit calmed down and the quiet and awkward atmosphere was back. Nobody said anything to break it until Hadrian had enough, "Ok that's it. What's going on with you guys and what are you hiding?"
Harry could hear the sincerity in the words Draco said to him, he got to know the real Draco and he was a romantic bastard. And Harry loved every part of it. Sometimes, Harry didn't know how to pay him back, but this time.....
"You didn't finish your nap, cub. Do you wanna sleep in here?"
Those being the last words Ombres said, before walking out both couples holding hands showing how little they cared about what any of the Order said.
Word Count: 1675
"Ron?"
He had long, black, wavy hair and coal-black eyes. He was wearing ripped jeans and a leather jacket that was slightly unzipped revealing a black shirt. He looked like he owned a motorcycle.
"What could Dumbledore have done?!"
That brought an uproar,
Hermione and Draco who missed them communicating didn't miss a beat in standing at the same time as Hadrian did. Draco asked, "Hadrian and I will be sharing as well, Ron and Hermione."
By the time he reached the man, his eyes had a slightly insane gleam in them, and he reached up to his face to stroke his cheek. He leaned in his lips and whispered in the man ear, "I'm going to have a lot of fun with you."
He was muttering to himself, "If that rune was trim in English then that one couldn't be, table because that can't be at... or maybe...."
The first thing is that I don't own the characters and they belong to J.K. Rowling. I will change the character personalities, but I don't take credit for them or the settings unless I make my own settings. All images are from Pinterest.
Harry didn't know when he started to cry, but he felt the tears down his face, "You're right and it was great Revealing (Title) my True Self (Chapter)
Ron sighed, "Tomorrow Harry."
Hadrian at least looked a bit sheepish but not the least bit guilty, "I'm sorry Hermione but he really deserved it. Think of all the children that he tortured. He even tried to bribe me not to kill him!"
Draco groaned again.
Be aware of time skips, I'll put the date at the beginning of each chapter so look for that.
Ron nodded, "His eyes, behind that irritating twinkle always seem to be planning something. He didn't even say anything when we left, probably trying to show he was on our side but if that was really the case, why didn't he scold Molly?"
Malfoy sat in front of him, looking very...kind? He reached up to his face, "You don't know me Potter, not the real me... I won't let you get hurt, darling."
Hadrian sneered, disgusted at the pathetic man in front of him. He didn't understand people who thought they could bribe him when it was obvious, he would kill them.

The one next to him was standing tall and proud. He had on a white button-up shirt that would've looked proper if it wasn't for the black ripped jeans, he had on with them. His hair was wild but stunningly blond, the color you would see on a Malfoy or a Lovegood. He had a confident smirk playing on his lips and his eyes seemed to say, 'I'm better than you could ever be.' He radiated confidence.
Harry laid on Draco, basking in the afterglow of their ehem... session. Harry was tired but of course, satisfied. He remembered when he and Draco got together finally. They were in this similar position.....
Hermione knew her boyfriend was scared; she could feel it. His former family... hurt him a lot and she knew he wasn't mentally ready to see him again. It had only been 2 years since he stopped trying to starve himself.
"Harry?"
Hermione sighed, "No, no that's not really what I want. I- I just don't want to lose you."
A grin came to his face.
Harry smirked, then he chuckled, then he started outright cackling until tears were streaming down his cheeks. Dumbledore looked confused at why he reacted like that while Harry regained his smirk, "Oh Dumbledore! If only you knew the irony of that statement."
---------
Hermione looked at Ron and saw him looking at her. His eyes filled with hurt, love, grief, and need. Hermione walked over to him and cupped his face, her eyes stared into his,
(See the end of the chapter for
------------------------------
As Harry continued walking, slightly shivering despite it being August, he saw a man start to approach him, he immediately searched his eyes for the wrong intent, not seeing any relaxed him a little but he still didn't trust it. Some of them knew how to hide it.
Hadrian smirked and slowly made his way over to him, "That's not important information at the moment."
Be easy with the criticism, I'm pretty young so go ahead and give notes but don't be too rude, thanks.
------------
Hadrian, Draco, Ron, and Hermione all love each other like family and would do anything for each other. They all have grey magical cores meaning they don't care for dark and light magic. Magic is magic. They are neutral.
Hadrian gave him a blank look, "Justin Myers, 38 years old. Hunted for luring and raping young children then burning their bodies to the point where they are still recognizable."
Hermione nodded apologetically, "Of course, I know how they made you feel."
Remus smirked as he moved faster and curled his fingers deliberately to his prostate, "Please, what Sirius? I don't know what you want."
Ginny's face was full of joy, Ron was having a real conversation with her! She always wanted to get to talk to him. "How long have you and Hermione been together?"
They all looked at the dark lord and he looked affronted. "What!? I need my son to have a dramatic entrance."
The people who stayed behind looked at each other unsure. They didn't expect them to ready to answer questions so... easily and they definitely didn't know where to start. Before any of them could decide anything though, Dumbledore asked with a smile on his face, "Why were we never able to find you?"
-------------
I'm really excited about this story because these are my two favorite ships! I hope you enjoy my book!
Upon seeing Draco, Harry gave a smile and did a twirl, "How do I look?"
"Come back to Remy, come back to me, love. I'm right here, I won't leave you. Ever,"
Guys! I am so so so so so sorry that it took me so long to write this chapter. I went through a long slump and no matter how long I tried I just couldn't write. I hope you guys are still interested in the story and enjoyed the chapter :)
Remus steeled himself as he walked over, reminding himself that he wasn't a hormonal teen who lost control of his emotions. As he stood in front of the table and placed Draco's tea down, he felt eyes on him and forget what he reminded himself of.
Sirius and Draco were still waiting at the table when they heard the sounds of the kitchen doors opening and they were a bit shocked by what they saw. Both of the shy men had a determined look on their face.
Sirius licked his lips and it took all of Remus's willpower to not follow the movement, "I don't mind the wait. I think waiting here in the most pleasurable company is much better than leaving without my whipped cream and not getting to stare at such gorgeous sight."
Ron smiled grimly, "Exactly, we can't trust him, and I'm sure he'll be upset when he realizes his act won't work on us, but I don't think he'll do anything to betray us, at least not yet."
Dumbledore didn't lose his smile and continued speaking, "And why not?"
Harry shot his head up and stared straight at Draco's pretty face, "I- you wanna be my boyfriend?"
As they finally sat down, Harry immediately turned to Draco and whispered, "We aren't too late though, so it's ok."
Everyone stared at the old man as he lost it which they were pretty sure he did. Harry took out his wand and said in a loud clear voice, "I, Harry James Riddle or Potter, swear on my magic that everything I said today was the truth and nothing but the truth." Then he lit up his wand with a Lumos to prove his word.
Harry got his blushing under control and said, "Well you look really good too."
Draco shushed him and whispered, "I know, Harry. We've watched this 3 times."
Hey guys, new story! Happy you're reading and I'm working on more content so go to my page and check out some other stories when I eventually make more, it might take some time though so sorry! This chapter is just to give some information about my story.
Each oneshot is separate from each other unless I put part 1 and part 2. There will be AU's, during Hogwarts, after Hogwarts, Sirius in Azkaban, Harry raised by Wolfstar, Draco and Harry after the war and a lot of others! It's completely random, there is no pattern to it!
--------------------------
He sighed, "Yes, Hermione, I remember. We'll be there on time. Promise."
Hermione gave an incredulous huff, "Almost? Harry, you were covered in blood."
Harry pouted but didn't complain.
Remus sucked on the tip first before deciding to just take the entire thing in his mouth and that's when Sirius let out a strangled groan,
He was brought out of his concentration from the irritating voice, (only at the moment otherwise it was lovely), to see Sirius Black, "Talking to yourself Moony?" Remus sighed and turned the chair to see that insufferable grin on Sirius's face.
Remus slowly moved from Sirius's lips to his neck and started kissing there. He heard Sirius give a shaky moan and decided he wanted to hear more because he latched onto the skin and started sucking, and licking, and lightly biting.
AU: Sirius doesn't go to Azkaban and Remus and Sirius raise Harry.
End Flashback
This is not at all canon and basically disregards basically all things canon.
-------------------------
Harry stared in disbelief after him, did the man really believe he would follow him? Well, Harry wouldn't, that was the definition of stranger danger. Harry watched the man get further out of sight before shaking his head, no he wouldn't. The man, well Harry didn't even know his name, so he had to chase after him just to find that out. After all, it was only fair, and he didn't know what Topolino or whatever he called him was so that was 2 very good reasons.
Eventually, the two assumed the position they are normally found in. Harry's head in Draco's lap and Draco stringing his fingers in Harry's hair. They enjoyed the silence and each other's presence for a long time, they hadn't seen each other in a month and most of the time when they did, it was an argument.
Harry stood and ran to the backroom to find Remus.
Harry rolled his eyes, "Of course you would say that! You weren't there! And the other guy there was totally your type! I'm sure if it was you and him, you would be freaking out, just like me!"
Voldemort seemed relieved to hear those words but still had some stress from whatever he was about to say, "I understand that I can never give back what I have taken from you... but maybe I can give you a new chance to have it?"
Ron sighed and rubbed his face, "Drained, utterly drained, I thought it would feel great getting Molly to back off like that and it did but just be around her makes me want to back down again."
Malfoy stared at him for a while before snorting, "How on earth did you find your way to where the Dark Lord is staying?"
Harry is going to be called, Hadrian. I know it's cliche but it's a powerful name. His friends will still call him Harry, but he is known as Hadrian.
By the end of Ron's speech, Hermione had tears in her eyes. She knew how bad it was, of course, she did, she was the one who comforted him. But as they all started getting better, they stopped talking about their old lives. She stopped talking about the way she was bullied until she left, how no one did anything. Ron stopped talking about the way his family made him feel. Draco stopped talking about Lucius and Narcissa. Harry stopped talking about his parents.
They let him speak without interrupting and once he finished, they knew he was right. They all had their problems with the magical world but it's not worth 1000 lives.
"Don't worry about me. I-"
The handsome man snapped his fingers in front of his face and only then did Harry come out of his trance and smiled sheepishly while letting out a shaky laugh, "I- I'm sorry. I didn't get your order?"
Sirius realized he was gay then but it wasn't until he got back to school and saw Remus did he realize his crush on him. Remus. With his soft brown eyes and short brown wavy hair. With his cute oversized sweatshirt with holes in them. Remus was adorable, smart, nerdy, and,
Nicolas wasn't sure if he was, but he wasn't going to tell Neville that and cause him to worry but before he even got to answer they all heard a loud pop, and everyone turned their attention to the four figures that somehow just got into the Order Secret House.
------------------------------------------
Once they were finished, they gave them their phones back and was surprised when Remus and Harry winked at them before heading back to the backroom.
The men complied and they saw their contact names with a number waiting to be put in. Sirius and Draco exchanged looks before eagerly typing in their numbers in the phone.
Before he could walk fully through the gates, he needed his eye to be scanned for their security, then he needed his hand scanned, then he needed to put in the 2 different passwords, then spit in a cup for the DNA test and lastly a hair strand for more DNA.
Harry didn't know what to say. Actually, his brain stopped functioning properly so he didn't something totally Gryffindor, he kissed him.
"Yes, she told me you were moping and complaining about how bored and miserable you were."
Rolling his eyes at Dumbledore, Hadrian started his tale, "After I ran away from home, I stayed on the streets for some time. It was pretty hard, but I rather be alone from my own choice rather than neglect. After being alone for months, I had started to learn how to avoid some... bad people and defend myself. I got sick a lot and I was starving all the time but that was until I met Marcus...."
Harry sat back down and leaned against the tree, he didn't really care to die, but he didn't care for living either. If he truly died... would it be such a bad thing.
Ron turned to face Hermione and squeezed her hand tighter before turning back to them, "Well I've known her since we were 9 but we've only been dating for a little less than a year."
Remus waited for Sirius to get comfortable and continued moving in and out slowly before he had Sirius begging for him to go faster.
"Dinner first, love. They aren't expecting us until 11:00 anyway. They should be sleep by then."
"I'm still surviving Sev, I always am."
Hadrian answered this one, "A grudge isn't worth the lived of innocents."
The Order on the other hand didn't have the same calm and peaceful atmosphere the Ombres group had. They were all nervous about letting people who tortured and used dark magic into the school.
Molly saw her baby for the first time in 7 years and the only thing she saw on his face was disgust and disdain. She wanted to go over and hug him, demand where he'd been, and just smother him but for some reason, Molly thought as she looked at the girl who was holding her youngest son's hands, looking at her with the same amount of hatred, Molly felt that she didn't have that right anymore.
James was a proud man. Not much could shock him and if it did, he never let it be known. But seeing his oldest son smiling at his youngest yet still looking powerful and quite frankly terrifying he was stunned into silence. He loved his son, he truly did, and every day without him hurt a little more. He didn't know why his son was an assassin, but it was okay. Everything would be okay now. He had his son back.
Sirius was the first person Draco came out as gay to and Sirius high-fived him and said, "Me too!"
The girl snorted, "That lunatic? No way, we work for ourselves."
Ginny was a bit shocked at that. They seemed to be so...together. Before she could ask any more questions, the leader who Ginny could tell was Hadrian, stood up, still embracing Nicolas, and announced, "Alright so I know you guys have questions. Unfortunately, we have to answer them, or else you guys would keep bugging us. If you're not related to us, besides Dumbledore and Severus, get out."
Harry and Remus exchanged looks, "Are we really doing this, cub?"
Time: Marauders Era; 6th year
Hadrian looked at them, a smile still on his face, "You, see? We already made it through our first day here and now we're sitting together and laughing. We got this guys."
Draco tried to smile innocently and shrugged, "We're here?"
When Hadrian was finally done with the man and left him in a spot where the Order would find him along with their signature mark,
Harry was so tired. He didn't want to have to hide anymore. He wanted to be able to flourish in his true colors. The son of the Dark Lord and the boyfriend to Draco Malfoy.
Remus snuggled deeper into Sirius, "It's not fair."
Just a quick story with not enough details! If you liked it, get ready for some of the many stories I have planned to write. Thanks for reading, please comment what you thought and vote if you think it was good enough! Peace Out! 😊
Ron interrupted her, staring at her with hard blue eyes, "Excuse me,
Hadrian was about to dismiss the question, but he looked into the eyes of his brother who had an awed look on his face and decided to indulge him a bit, "All of us have our own stories, all not meant for young ears, but I suppose I can give you a small part of my story if you truly want to hear it?" He raised a condescending eyebrow as if daring them to refuse.
----------------
Hey guys, new book! Happy you're reading and I'm working on more content so go to my page and check out some other stories when I eventually make more, it might take some time though so sorry! I have two other stories out at the moment but I'm working on more! This chapter is just to give some information about my story.
Hadrian's face did something funny. His lips twitched as if he wanted to smile but his face also showed pain and both emotions were trying to present themself, of course in the end neither won and he had the blank expression on his face that he loved oh so much. "When I was on the streets," He started, speaking coldly, knowing the Potters would flinch at that, suppressing a grin when they did, "I learned to read people's faces. Of course, some knew how to hide it as I mentioned, but Marcus was different."
Draco winced at the memory. It really wasn't his fault that he forgot to bring Harry's back to the Weasley's. He had been too caught up with.... never mind.
Hermione punched his nose,
Sirius was at work while Remus was watching Harry. They both agreed that while Harry was younger, Remus wouldn't have a job and would watch Harry. Sirius, of course, made sure that was exactly what Remus wanted but was reassured with a soft kiss to the lips and a whispered 'I promise'
Ron, feeling more than hearing where his thoughts were going, looked over at him and raised an eyebrow, 'We done?'
"Hello, my love... I was informed by a little beauty that you were missing me."
Sirius ran to their shared room in a panic, wondering if it had something to do with the full moon coming up. But with the sight that greeted him, he knew it was something way worse.
, smiled coyly, "Harry," He tested the name on his lips before winking, "A cute name for a cute boy. I like it." And with those words, he left to find a table with his companion following him.
Harry pouted, "She was exaggerating."
--------------------------------
Once everyone was seated, Dumbledore smiled and his eyes were twinkling, "Well Ombres, thank you for coming to protect Hogwarts. I know that term doesn't start until September, but I thought we should get acquainted. Especially considering the fact we will all be working together. I think introductions are in order."
Word Count: 1835
Sirus stared, shocked at his boyfriend. The only times Remus looked this hurt was when it involved-
Remus could feel Sirius about to cum so he continued to fuck him dead on his prostate, "What do you need Sirius? Go ahead and tell me."
----------------------------
That's it, guys! I'm always going to end the chapters on a parting note :)
He nodded, "Yes Harry, come sit, I have a matter that I need to discuss with you."
"He thinks of us as dads."
Ron's face moved from where he was staring at Molly's to see his little and only sister and for the first time since they arrived his face changed into a slight smile, "Yes she is, the love of my life, Hermione Granger. And you are Ginevra?"
“I'll teach you about apps.  Or Harry will.  But right now just use this for communication, alright?”
"Kingsley is going to wait for it to happen, and see who it is that goes to Azkaban to release Lucius.  But you won't be without protection.  The Ministry will be standing by, Aurors will be discreetly placed all through your area.  24 hours a day, Draco...  Someone will always have eyes on your house."
“Come off it, Potter.” Draco said quietly, darkly and rather dangerously. His lips close enough to Harry’s that they almost caught together as he spoke. “You know what happens if you fight it.”
I will confirm that it IS a magical object.  Borgin's explanation of it had nothing to do with Harry's reaction to it.  Borgin himself doesn't think that the ring is anything much but metal because all it did was make him question what he wanted for lunch every day.
He thought he was dying.  He thought that somehow that woman had cursed him and he was dying.  His heart hammered in his chest, but spastically so, missing beats and seeming to find absolutely no coherent rhythm.  His chest hurt, it felt like someone was winding his muscles in tighter and tighter over his lungs, making him gasp for air as his hands shook.  His entire body seemed to shake, his vision somehow narrowing and sharpening at the same time.
"No.  Not socks.  What's IN the socks."  He unfolded the socks and produced a tiny bottle.  A very tiny bottle full of scintillatingly gold liquid.
Someone brave would have stood up to their mother, who he had always felt understood how backwards this Pureblood nonsense really was.  Someone brave wouldn't have waited for Harry to write to him, they would have written to him first and told him everything that his mother had said.  Laughed it off and continued their friendship.
"I... wasn't invited.." Draco said haltingly, finding that just when he thought this conversation couldn't get weirder, it went right off the tracks.
“I know Harry had wanted to ask you if you knew of any way that we could convince him to accept protection.”  Neville ventured, a hopeful tinge in his voice that rubbed against Draco like sandpaper.
"We?"  Draco asked, tilting his head a bit, his eyes turning down for a moment, then back up to Harry's face.  "You really mean it, don't you."
Harry chuckled, shifting to lean forward, resting his arms on his knees as he looked at the blonde boy.  "Did he reel back in horror?"
“It wouldn't.” Harry said with a snort, smirking himself as he looked from Draco to Tom.  “I've bested you while you were attached to Quirrell's head, some sort of apparition from a diary and through sheer luck in a graveyard.  I'm not stupid enough to think that if you came at me as you are now that I'd win.  But they just keep shielding me, not telling me the whole story, keeping vital information from me.  I'm sick of it.”  Harry scrubbed his hands through his hair, then looked back up again, glancing at Draco and then at Tom.  “I don't want to fight for them anymore.”
But he only did it to stop everyone from thinking he was mad.  Nothing would change his mind about the importance of finding Draco.  But if he was going to do it, he had to make sure everyone had forgotten he ever cared about it in the first place.
Neville's voice, even more hopeful now, bordering on encouraging even, cut through his memories and he was somewhat grateful for that.  Though he still didn't like what the other man was suggesting.
Harry’s hand twitched, but the gentleness of the jinx just made his fingers slacken of their own accord.  The wand dropped onto the desk instead of jerking and flying away from him.  It rolled towards Draco who carefully and almost reverently picked it up.
He was in the midst of examining a box of what was supposedly 'macaroni and cheese' while contemplating lunch as it was starting to get towards noon and he'd forgone breakfast when he heard a knock on the door. He got up rather eagerly to answer it, thinking it must be Neville since he seemed to be the only person that came to see him.
He shook his head, letting out a sharp rush of air, looking at his mother with frustration.  "Why do you even care?  What's happened in the past months that suddenly you're so incredibly wary about our standing in the community?  You never cared for this Pureblooded family nonsense, not really.  You never cared about how we looked or what we stood for before this?"
He watched Harry talk to one of the Aurors for a few moments, then watched him continue up the street and disappear at some agreed upon apparition point.
"I'll come back whenever you want."  Harry said, rubbing a hand on the back of his own neck, feeling slightly and weirdly awkward.  "After you talk to Snape or before if you want.  Whenever..."
He turned his head to look at Draco, smiling after a few moments.  “But you learn more.  You stop just letting yourself blindly follow what you're told...  or NOT told as the case may be.  It's not like anyone has EVER asked me 'Harry, do you WANT to fight Voldemort and save us again?'  It's just been assumed.  Even I assumed it..”
“You know what I’m talking about.”
The Room of Requirement had fashioned itself into a bedroom.  A very large bedroom but a bed room all the same.  Harry got to his feet to walk around, looking at everything. Four tall windows that looked out onto what appeared to be a perfectly manicured garden with peacocks strutting through it.  A huge canopied bed in green and silver to match the drapes.  Polished dark wood floors and polished dark wood furniture.  A settee, a couple of wingback chairs and a small table between them with two steaming warm mugs of what looked like-
"It's perfect, actually."  Harry said, smiling at Draco and nodding a little more.  "Really...  We'll need to get you an owl, and we'll have to find a way to get you out of Hogwarts when it's time.  Do you think your mother will listen to just one message from you? And maybe we should instruct the owl to deliver the message then go to wherever the safe house is and stay there.  Then she can send a message to you when she arrives."
He headed up to their dorm and set to trying to clean up the mess he'd made with the contents of his trunk after he'd torn it all apart looking for the ring.
Harry was sitting cross legged in the deep frame of a tall window, looking out across the grounds while a thunder storm raged outside.  He'd taken to spending a lot of time sitting there and in other spots around the castle to save himself endless hours in the Gryffindor common room.
Draco shook his head, unconsciously squeezing his arms around Harry's shoulders a bit.
Smarmy git.
Harry grated the words out, and the strain in his voice, the thickness there that Draco could hear that confirmed he was just as far gone as he was, that had to be the hottest thing he'd ever heard.  Ever.
"It was.. interesting..."  Harry nodded his head a couple of times, then tilted his head a bit as he looked at the other boy.  "Do you know what a Horcrux is?"
“I'll never be as good as you at Occlumency.”  Harry said, shaking his head as he smiled a bit at the other boy.  “Seriously, you're probably better than Snape is.  Never let him know.”
"No...  Not really her thing, making stuff.  We have help to cook and clean and she just buys whatever else is wanted or needed."  Draco scuffed one foot against the ground, shifting slightly on the windowsill.
"No one could forge them.  Not the Minister's Seal...  Only the Minister knows how to create it, they create it when they take office and never tell anyone else how it's done and what magic is in it so there is no possibility of forgery."
“You think I taught him to be?” Draco asked, leaning forward a bit.  “You aren’t someone to be afraid of, I wouldn’t have taught him that.”
“This is a Macbook.”  He said, opening the box and showing Draco what he guessed was the 'Macbook'.  “It's a laptop made by the same company as your phone is.  If you've been using your phone you may find it easier to use this as well, some things are similar and it will seem more familiar.”
"Merlin.."  He muttered the word, a 'throwback' to his days in the Wizarding World that he just couldn't break.  He couldn't seem to break a lot of the slang he had used growing up and had been extremely self conscious about it in the Muggle world.  Thankfully, his friends and co-workers thought it was rather delightful and quirky so he never had to try and make up reasons and excuses for it.
But that was not a problem for him, so long as he stayed inside, and he had been
But all the while he smiled, made small talk, discussed television shows and went to meetings, he always felt like an absolute fake.  At least Dean hadn't known he was an absolute fake the whole time.  Life would have been easier that way.
"That's utter bullshit and completely fucked up."  Draco said, not even bothering to try and think of a more polite way to say it.  "How on earth do they expect you to fight with them, to trust them, to align with their cause if they don't even do you the courtesy of keeping you prepared."
"Mm.." Draco nodded a bit, smiling at Harry but looking away quickly.
That seemed to startle Draco back into the present and a normal frame of mind, which was that this was a STRANGE and nonsense conversation to be having with Harry fucking Potter.
“But..”  Draco hesitated, an almost calculating look on his face.  Much like the one he had affected at the start of the year when he and Harry were just finding their feet in friendship.  “He did kill your parents....”
Luna Lovegood?  No...
"So I was in the park and my cousin, Dudley, and a bunch of his mates turns up.  They were kind of a gang, a bunch of tossers acting on their increased testosterone.  Dudley turned out okay in the end but at the time we hated each other's guts.  So they see me and I said something not nice.  I don't remember what it was but it was pretty much to cause problems.  I was so fucked up that summer, I was looking to antagonize.  Anyways, he responds in kind, we get into a bit of a scuffle when he says something about me talking in my sleep, about my mom and about Cedric..."
All Harry could think of was to pull out his wand and place it on the silver heads' neck.
"you told me I should let him know that's what I'm gonna do"
"Nothing," he said and walked past Hermione and collided shoulders with Ron, the redhead took a hold of his arm but harry yanked him off and took a step forward toward the stairs but halted.
"Prince Harry!" The boy was startled to hear his name as he made his way up everyone went silent once again two royal blood in the same year.
harry was annoyed, really annoyed "mate, what's wrong with you?" Ron asked as he took a bite out of his toast.
once again trapped between the wall and Draco, Harry glared at the blond.
"ill give you your kiss then will you stop whining?" he asked but before she could retort he pushed his lips onto hers holding her face so she wouldn't move.
Draco smiled to himself and turned to harry stopping him in his track
"I don't know why I agreed to this" sighed harry as they walked around Diagon Alley.
harry finished and waiting for Ron to speak it looked like the boy was still registering what his dear friend slash prince just said.
Not looking where he was going the boy ended up slamming himself against someone else.
"and here we are" hagrid spoke once they had apparated to Diagon alley
"where are you going?" Hermione asked as she got off the bed too.
"oh wait for me here harry I need to go get something real quick" harry was startled but let hagrid go while he was getting fitted for his robes.
"thank you, I'm gonna head to bed you two should too we have classes tomorrow"
"he's here," he said as his eyes trailed back to his ring.
"if you are sure of this, tell him, let him know" Harry rolled his eyes and sighed he pushed his hair back and licked his lips.
Draco had his head between his arms set on the table and harry could see Blaise rubbing the blond's back and whispering in his ear.
"ill try to behave but if he irks me I am not going to hold back" he stated and turned to leave the room.
Draco scoffed and rubbed his face.
"what? who said that?"
"I know... but please give us a chance, a real chance before quitting" he looked at the raven.
Hermione got up and took Harrys' books with her and walked up to his room leaving Ron to calm down.
Harrys' body stiffed as his eyes trailed down to his own hand.
Harry zoned out as the professor started calling names but when he heard a familiar name the boy was back in the great hall standing along with the students.
"no" harry replied harshly and left his room.
Hermione ignored his remark and went back to reading.
as soon as the name of his promised one left his lips Ron instantly got up.
"you are quite slow at catching on" Draco teased
-.......-
Making their way out of the great hall Harry was still not present in the moment his mind would drift back to his one sweet encounter with the blond prince.
Candles floating around above their heads.
"why? why!" he yelled more tears slipping he pushed Draco away from him.
Ron looked frustrated.
"Draco" pansy said as she held her hand up.
His hand on his knees trying to even his breathing.
"he's too vile..yet why do I feel this way, why" harry let out a loud cry and hugged Hermione even harder.
I don’t own anything everything belongs to Harry Potter.
That meant no actual vacation was in Harry's near future.
harry was surprised but kept his eyes on the blond who groaned internally before turning toward his friend once again.
the prince wiped his tears away as soon as he was free from the hold.
he got up from his place and stood tall rolling his shoulders back the boy took steps forward toward the whiny girl in his room.
he sighed and decided to take a shower to wash away Draco's scent that still lingered on his clothes.
Draco placed his leg in between Harry so the boy was fully trapped.
"I'm heading to my room." he declared and left forgetting his books on the table.
"Welcome to Hogwarts, I am Professor McGonagall. The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts, and the houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin"
harry took his glasses off and wiped them before placing them back on the bridge of his nose.
Harry was startled when he felt something push at his arm he looked up from his position to find Draco sitting where Hermione was seconds ago pushing his plate of food back toward him.
"Welcome, students, such a pleasure to see you all back at Hogwarts for your third year may this year be filled with new amazing adventure and opportunities for new friendships" the headmaster finished saying and soon started talking about the basic rules for the new first-year students but the boy tuned the man out head hung low with thoughts floating in his mind.
"Hermione granger" the said girl walked steadily toward the stool that was placed right below the teachers and headmaster's podium.
"yes! yes, I just would like to announce something!" he spoke excitedly.
"Tell me what's wrong with me kissing Blaise?" he asked again every word getting him closer to pansy.
"and you finally have someone, why not break things off so you can be with him," he said while placing his glasses back on the bridge of his nose.
"oh my of course you are but why use this passage?" she questioned and harry just shrugged his shoulder not wanting to elaborate.
"Harry" the boy looked up from his plate and met eyes with Hermione.
"you are not the one for me! I didn't ask to be with you! and never will!" harry kept going Draco was just too surprised to react all he could do was stand there and take in each word harry threw at him.
harry ran up to his own room and placed his books away and sighed he can do this.
I don’t own anything everything belongs to snape
"help me will you?" Draco said and cleared his throat that stung.
as harry finally made his way to platform  9 and 3/4  he saw a familiar head full of red hair.
"it's a very pretty crown Draco," James said but Draco only shook his head
"Hermione.." whispered Ron
Draco smiled widely and lunged toward harry hugging him tightly.
"We're almost at school you should both get changed," she said and walked out of the compartment.
"Please do not raise your voice," he said in a soft tone.
He had been having fights and arguments with Malfoy and so far 3 students have been found petrified in the corridors of the school.
"Oh merlins beard" he whispered
"oh!" Ron said as he sat down next to his friends
"Why are you wearing a ring? Harry" Hermione asked more specifically.
"Stay out of my way!" Yells Harry as he stared at his promised one with hatred.
Ginnys' cheeks turned red as she placed her hand into Harry's.
The boy felt like someone was watching him so he listed his eyes in search of the person that was making him feel this way and found the silver head staring at him from across the hall.
and as soon as the words had reached the boy and he had finally registered what just came out of Harrys' mouth the boy was quick on his feet.
before he realized tears were falling on his face he clutched his hand even harder against his mouth scared that a sound would escape him and someone would hear him.
"Are you sure?" she nudged him further while picking up her book again,
he gasped yet it was muffled by his hand the boy slid down and collapsed on the floor his eyes were wide open shocked at himself for what he had just done.
"ready to go?" the older man asked and harry only nodded his head not having the strength to talk to the man after his conversation with his father.
harry was left staring at his bed where previously his best friend was sitting.
"What!" Ron yelled out
"Severus please send her to the infirmary" professor snaps nodded his head and soon he was out of sight.
Harry rolled his eyes and straightened his back.
"harry are you alright, you look pale," Hermione asked placing her books next to her so she could move closer to the prince.
Draco stared at harry not saying a word
"What do you want?" Harry asked as he pulled away from the wall and stood straight.
"fine" he got up from the bed
that made Draco smile
As the sorting of the first year ended Ron tapped Harry on the shoulder.
"did you see that!" exclaimed Ron as he dropped his books on the table in their dormitory sitting area.
I've already seen it what's different now?" the boy asked as he took his initial position back.
Nothing belongs to me apart from the plot and so the rest belongs to Cedric
"Sorry" the boy mumbled as he pulled his hand back.
each house's responsible had accompanied the new student toward their respective dorms telling them that all their belongings were already in their dorm room.
Harry sat down and the ceremony continued.
"Gryffindor !" The hat yelled making Hermione smile bright before she ran toward the table of the said house.
harry shook his head "father told me to experience" the boy rolled his eyes as he remembered his father's words.
In the end, the issue was solved and whoever had been petrified was back to normal.
Harry stayed silent "bathroom"  he mumbled after a while.
Harry almost rolled his eyes at the obvious things the hat spoke but he held back he had an image to uphold.
"you should let him know" she whispered Harry looked at her.
"let me deal with my choices!" and she walked away to the girls' dormitory.
"I just know, I heard his name and that's him, my father; the king always talks so highly of him and all I ever heard from him was; Draco this and Draco that"
dracos family and Harrys were all dinings together the family arrived not long ago and they decided to share a meal since it's been too long since they saw each other.
"blimey, prince!" he exclaimed making harry smile at the boy "its harry for you, been saying that since we were young" Harry rolled his eyes
He entered and ran to his own room and fell on the bed.
"Harry!" came a sudden voice that startled the two who were focused on their menu.
"Wow," he blurted out making Harry and Hermione turn to look at him.
Harry's eyes went wide at what he saw a girl unknown to him stuck to Draco's side and the prince wasn't doing anything to move her away he played along with the girl and pulled her closer.
"goodnight Draco" he whispered but never got a reply only soft breathing.
"Why not give us a chance before you take that ring off for a ginger you just met" Harry was stunned he had never heard Draco talk with this tone and it sent chills down his spine.
I don’t own anything everything belongs to an unknown human being.
"Draco" Blaise whispered not wanting to attract more attention toward them, already the prince being slumped on the dining table was sufficient.
before he could finish his sentence harry blurted it out "13" Ron was very confused but went back to eating before Hermione told them it was time to go to class.
"Draco!" the blond jumped in his seat and turned toward the person who called him he sighed when his eyes landed on Blaise.
"Oh! I'm so sorry!" A voice brought the boy back to the present.
"yes" he said with authority in his voice oh the prince in him was coming out.
A public ceremony was to be held when both parties were of age;18, and since Harry was a few months younger than the blonde they had to wait for him to be of age too since Draco would be turning 18 as soon as they would leave for vacation.
Harry hissed at the sudden pain that shot through his head, Draco bent a little to be at Harry's level and whispered in his ear.
harry came back and turned to ginny with a soft smile.
"come with me, I would like to talk about something very important" the raven head nodded and followed his father out of the throne room.
--•--
"I...I I'm going to talk to my parents" he finally announced
"yes! and Blaise of all people!!" she hurled her arms around making herself look relatively crazy.
"he has a girlfriend" she countered Draco's hand tightened around her chin making her hiss in the process
The boy seemed love-struck to realize that someone had been glaring at him throughout his last lesson of the day; Potion.
harry started laughing after he swallowed his bit and turned forward toward his plate and shook his head while still having a smile on his face the boy took his fork from ginny and took a piece of pancake and was about to put it into his mouth when suddenly his eyes landed on the blond.
"you still haven't told us what happened last night," Ron asked as he stared with a slightly disgusted face at his sister and best friend.
"where is he going?" Ron asked as he saw harry leave the dormitory without even glancing toward him.
Harry looked up at the redhead and his look made Ron flinch, his small flinch brought harry back to reality he closed his eyes and sighed.
"that you've said a thousand times" his after replied now sighing loudly.
"Gotcha" Draco mumbled to himself as he ran to catch up with Harry.
harry was genuinely curious he had never felt this way before this was all so new that only ginny could make him feel this way he had seen lots of pretty girls in the school but none had ever made his chest so warm of such giddy feelings it felt like as if he had butterflies in his stomach an expression that Hermione taught him once.
"What!" Harry started at the retreating boy and he was sure that the blond had a big smile on his face.
Harry listened to the message as he strolled around the castle in search of his friends with his wand in hand in case he would need to use it things have been going south this year.
"I'm saying he is here meaning my promised one is starting the year here at Hogwarts along with us"
"oh alright" Hermione nodded her head
Ron just stared at the boy as he kept saying the most hurtful things possible.
"what are these red lines on your face?" she inquired and was about to reach his face but he flinched away.
"I'm not showing the crown, I know it's pretty"
ginny was at his door the boy jumped out of his seat and watched as the said girl walked in and closed the door behind her.
Hermione took a seat next to harry and started reading not even saying a word to the boys.
They made their way and stood at the back not wanting to attract attention toward them. They heard a voice.
"I have something to tell you" Ron nodded his head and looked at Harry with curious eyes.
"I... I didn't mean to eavesdrop but I heard" her eyes were looking everywhere and anywhere that didn't consist of the boy.
Harry's posture slightly faltered under the blond's stare but he kept himself composed.
"I thought you would apparate or floo to school?" Hermione asked as soon as she was comfortable.
"I can handle my own problems," he said and turned to his empty plate.
he stared at the snow-white owl and smiled.
A weird feeling was burning in Harry's chest not knowing what it could be the boy rubbed the back of his head and made his way toward his class.
I don’t own anything everything belongs to Draco Malfoy
'Why does it bother me?' He thought
as she tried to keep her cried at bay.
He touched his lips.
Hermione sighed and walked after her.
"I'm fine" the raven replied with an attempted smile.
--•--
"a late birthday gift and an apology since I couldn't attend the party," the man said as he shoved the bird in Harry's face making the prince laugh.
"What happened?" she asked but Harry shook his head and tried to project a smile toward her but he ended up hissing the bruises on his cheeks and chin were painful.
Draco walked after the boy and started walking next to him.
"Ron!" Ginny yelled as she got up from her seat.
"yes Draco, is everything ok?" his mother asked
"say that again," said Draco as he stared at harry.
"Oh, I'm sorry now that I know my eyes can't seem to focus on anything but your ring" he confessed.
she turned to harry only to find the boy lost in his thoughts while ginny tried to bring him back.
harry looked offended as he stared at his mum "gentle?" he whispered under his breath.
"I despise that royalties guts for even looking at you after what he did to you," Blaise said and sent a glare toward harry but the said man didn't see since his gaze was fixed on Draco.
"what," he asked and rolled his eyes
"Oh I'm so going to kill him" he mumbled as his knuckles turned white.
"No I did, are you joking," Harry asked trying to surpass a laugh.
he sighed and turned to her "what was what for?" he asked with irritation present in his voice.
Draco pulled the boy closer to him, stumbling harry let out a whine from the harsh hold.
"How could you even think about that! harry! you are already promised to that jerk! how can you even think of pulling my sister into this! is that why you asked about her earlier today" Ron was angry and his face almost reassembled his hair.
Harry's blood boiled as Ron kept talking.
"Who is she..she looks just like you," Harry said going back and forth between the two.
"you get to run around with that ginger with this still on, yet I can't?" harry tried to pull his hand back but Draco only held it harder.
his mother held out her hand and the boy placed his own tiny one in it holding tightly since they were about to apparate to the kingdom of Godrics hollow.
Nothing belongs to me it rightfully goes to minerva
"I won't ever stop, just remember I hate you as much as you hate me" and pushed the boy forward letting him stumble and turned around to leave and go to his class.
"Please stand here, I'll shortly call you one by one and we will begin the sorting," she said as she opened a long parchment sheet that almost touched the floor and on another hand, she held a hat.
"let it go Ron he"ll tell us when he's ready," Hermione said as she took a bite of her food.
"What!" They said in unison.
"Why?" she asked as she tilted her head slightly
"harry" the said boy turned to find his father standing up
She stared at the students before speaking again.
Harry just stared at him with no expression but when Draco walked closer harry felt the sudden urge to take back his words.
"I'm not hungry," he said as he watched Ron eating as if there was no tomorrow.
"Promised? promised!!" She said again
"in the great hall!" she whined and stomped her foot making Draco raised his brow at her behaviour.
"what for?" harry whispered
The older man chuckled at the boys' expression.
for the rest of the day harry was all alone, Ron didn't talk to him since he was next to his sister consoling her since she had appeared in the dining hall with red puffy eyes he watched then looked back at his plate not finding any appetite the boy caught Hermione eyes the girl looked guilty she felt like she was the one who had caused this whole issue to start with.
Draco sighed and turned his gaze to the Gryffindor table only to find the redhead girl sitting next to harry holding his hand and it looked like she was talking to the other redhead supposedly her brother and the boy looked so mad Draco could almost hear the conversion but unfortunately, no word made its way to his ear.
"what's wrong?" Ron asked again after harry put his glasses back on "it's him, always him" he grunted as he placed his head on the table.
"Professors..professors I.. Hermione" he stuttered.
"a what!" harry exclaimed but his mother sent a glare toward him and he instantly calmed down sitting back on his chair.
"I am sorry" he stated while walking closer.
"Soon my Love, soon they are coming tomorrow"
And he unconsciously played with his ring.
"Harry!" he heard hagrid's voice the boy turned in search of the man and found him staring into the shop so harry went to the man and found him holding a cage.
Soon another professor came running toward them.
"harry" she whispered but the said boy suddenly sat up and stared at her Hermione's eyes widened as she looked at his red teary eyes.
"you seem to be forgetting who you are raising your voice at," Draco said staring daggers at the Weasley.
"now get ready you are leaving tonight, please take care of harry and mend your broken relationship" his father announced while getting up from his chair. his mother nodded along as she wiped her face and gestured to the servant to clean up the dining table.
"Oh, Ginny!" Ron said next to him.
"good" Draco turned and started walking and harry followed
Hermione only nodded not daring to look at the boy.
"Hey, what's this?" she remarks while pointing  toward Harrys' hands.
Harry smiled at her and patted her hand.
Harry was in his final class but the boy's mind was somewhere else and that somewhere else was his best mate's sister.
"Nothing," Harry said but his eyes betrayed him quickly searching for the silver head.
Ginny nodded her head and smiled at harry.
"get me that girl's information" Blaise looked confused but turned his eyes to where Draco was looking and his eyes widened dracos promised one was holding hands with a redhead.
"now what is the first thing you need?" hagrid asked as they stopped in the middle of the street, Harry pulled out the sheet and started reading.
"I don't know honestly" he replied and turned to his right to look at Blaise
"I know you hate me and I understand I have anger issues and do things that don't end well but you can't do this to me"
"Draco what are you staring at?" Blaise asked as he found Dracos' eyes fixed on something.
Draco stared at the boy taking all of his features in black hair, green eyes that were hidden behind small round glasses that suited the boy's face perfectly before Draco could mutter a word the boy spoke "I like your hair" he said as he placed a hand on Draco's head.
Draco let out a chuckle and spoke again with that soft tone that really did do something to Harry.
"Please go back to the dormitory," she said and walked away leaving the boy in tears.
"I don't know what made you into this but Draco I know you are better than any other royal blood."
harry looked at the boy who looked so smug.
how could his parents give him away to such a person, he thought.
"what would that be?" Harry's mother Lily asked with a small smile on her face.
"he's here" he mumbled as he let his head fall in Hermione's lap.
He was left alone with his thoughts once again.
"harry" she spoke
"Let's just get to class," Hermione said and Freed Harry's wrist from her hold.
"What are you thinking about? you haven't touched your food" the boy said trying to move on from his mistake.
The raven unconsciously placed his hands around dracos waist and pulled him into a hug letting his face get buried in the silver head's chest.
"you can find someone and everything is fine but when I decide to kiss someone you finally think of breaking things off?" Draco asked as he stared at Harry with hate.
Ginny looked at him very confused she looked so vulnerable rosy cheeks and nose tears staining her cheeks and lips swollen from biting them
"mother!" harry walked at a quick pace while he waved a letter in hand as he entered the throne hall slightly startling his parents.
as soon as they arrived in front of the gates the guard's eyes went wide not being used to seeing the king and queen of Wiltshire walking so casually out in the open. they bowed their heads and opened the gate as quickly as possible with a swing of their wands.
"I don't want to feel this way anymore," he said through hiccups
"Hermione!?" He said once he stood straight.
Blaise looked stunned for a second before he rolled his eyes and turned to Draco.
"I I gotta go" Harry tan out of the room and didn't stop until he was back at the Gryffindor dormitory.
"We are done let me bring you back to the kingdom so you can be apparated to school" harry stopped admiring the owl and spoke, "Father told me I could go to school by train" Hagrid nodded and accompanied the boy to the kings cross station.
"what are you doing up prince? it's late" said Blaise as he walked into Draco's room
"no!" harry jolted back and looked at Hermione with wide eyes.
Grey eyes looked at him with such hatred the boy couldn't muster a word.
"yes absolutely!" she says and explains to Harry how to cross through the wall and soon harry and Ron are on the other side a loud noise of a train makes its way to Harry's ears.
the blond turned his attention to his hands and found that he had broken the fork that was in his hands now in two pieces.
"Public engagement ceremony" and left without a second word.
Ginny was smiling so bright that harry thought her face would rip apart if she kept smiling.
"Let's go," Hermione said and pushed through the boys and started walking out of the great hall.
That was his voice! When was that? When did he say that!
"Hey what are you doing in the middle of the hallway?" Ron turned and found Harry making his way toward the boy.
"sit down Draco" he finally said trying to surpass a smile and the blond did what he was told and in the end, they had a pleasant dinner date.
Harry looked up and found a red-haired girl looking at him with shocked eyes.
"and who do we have here?" spoke James excitedly it was the first time he would get to meet the prince of Wiltshire and the child of one of his dearest friends.
Harry smiled at her and opened his mouth to speak but ginny pushed a piece of pancake into his mouth instead.
Harry opened his eyes and pulled away from Draco
"her name is ginny Weasley, she is Ron Weasleys youngest sister she is in her second year, and I also took the liberty to get prince Harrys friends name, so Ron is the redhead we always see hanging around the prince along with them the girl with the wildest hair I've ever seen her name is Hermione"
"what's going on?" Ron said while reaching down the stairs.
And soon she ran away to where she was headed before bumping into Harry.
A smile crept on the sleeping boys' lips as he snuggled more into his pillow.
harry got ready for bed and laid on his bed he stared at the ceiling the smile wouldn't leave his lips but the thought of Ron being mad at him did make his smile leave but ginny did promise she would talk to the boy.
"What do you want," he asked pushing the plate on the side once again.
"really" she replied
Harry and Ron started talking "hey where have you two disappeared to?" They heard and found Hermione standing one stair above them making her look taller.
"so you know," he said as he placed his head in his hands.
"what are you doing here?" he asked
she looked so giddy but as soon as her eyes landed on his than that he ran through his messy hair the smile was nowhere to be seen.
"my name is Draco, your highness" the boy spoke as he bowed his head a little James looked at Lucius with a silly smile making the man roll his eyes and chuckle.
"He's 11!!" Exclaimed Ron getting more confused.
Draco crossed his arms and sighed before letting them fall on his side he approached the crying girl and placed a finger under her chin lifting her head so he could look into her eyes.
--•--
"Let's go, this way!" Hagrid yelled as he got everyone's attention.
after a while of talking ginny left the boy's room and harry was in the clouds his first ever crush and she liked him back!
they went around shopping and soon harry had multiple packages that were in hagrid's hold since he didn't want the prince to be holding anything.
the boy walked upstairs and easily found his room he opened the door and slammed it shut behind himself.
"would you mind showing me how?" he said instead
they walked into a shop and they were welcomed with wide surprised eyes "princes" someone said and bowed and the boys nodded in acknowledgement.
"what?" he asked after he calmed down he averted his gaze suddenly remembering the night he went to the boy's dormitory.
Before Harry could say anything the warmth was taken away from him and without saying a word the source of such comfort was gone.
"hi, there harry," hagrid said smiling down at the boy.
"Ronald weaselly!" The boy turned toward the teacher and gulped before making his way up the podium.
"anything" Blaise replied already grasping onto his friend's thoughts.
Harry followed her moves until she was out of sight Ron slapped the boy's arm and brought him back to reality.
Big grey eyes stared back at her "yes mommy" he nodded his head showing he understood his mother's warning.
"Hermione!" she said again tears started building up in her eyes, she wiped them away before they could even fall on her rosy cheeks.
Harry looked at him with such sharp eyes Ron wanted to shrink and disappear.
"Harry she asked you something," he said while shaking the boy who held a hand out to suggest to the redhead to stop.
Hermione shook her head and looked outside the window.
"But I wanna see him now!" The raven prince rolled on the ground in the throne room making his parents laugh.
in response pansy took steps back "why not me" she murmured under her breath
"I said; I don't care," Draco stated as he lifted his head looking at Blaise before turning toward the Gryffindor table staring back at his promised one.
"you know I'm already taken don't you?" he spoke in a soft voice "you like me or love me I am bound to be with someone else in the end" he continued.
"will you stop running?" his mother asked him as she shook her head at his unchanged behaviour.
"I'm sorry" Harry sighed once more, he was exhausted.
"Hi there Ginny so sorry that I don't remember much about you but nice to meet you" he extended his hand.
harry was done getting fitted for his robes, he was speaking with the person in charge of how his robes needed to bear the crest of his kingdom a request made from his father.
harry couldn't understand but his chest tightened at the scene that was playing in front of him he dropped his fork and kept staring at the prince and his best friend.
I don’t own anything everything belongs to dobby
harry was sat at the table with his friends and ginny was feeding him since the boy wouldn't eat on his own.
Draco gritted his teeth and spoke again "say that again"
Hermione sat down on the sofa and sighed placing her books in her lap "we all saw, the whole school did" she replied slightly annoyed.
harry was stunt stood in his place as ginny walked out of his room not turning once.
the person led them to a closed-off area and gestured for them to take a seat and handed them their menu
"what's happening to them they loved each other so much," she said and walked toward the king and Harry's father hugged her tightly.
"you can't do this anymore" she repeated "you! cant do this anymore?"
"Let's go," he said and motioned toward the two that were stood behind him watching all of this play out.
"Where did you even disappeared to?" Ron asked tagging along
Draco nodded.
"oh, Narcissa! Lucius!" came a deep voice and as they turned to their left they saw the king of Godric walking toward them.
Draco bent to be at eyes level with the raven and whispered.
the raven closed his eyes letting the tears that welled up in his eyes fall on his face. the harsh hold of the silver head suddenly disappeared and Harry opened his eyes to see a shocked expression on dracos face.
"seriously women!" Draco raised his voice startling harry who was staring at ginny not saying a word
harry turned to the boy and sighed "I don't know Draco, you've done so much that I don't know if I'll be able to move on" harry spoke finally deciding to be honest with the boy.
Draco looked at harry in the eyes as he turned to face him, pulling away from his position where he was letting the wall carry his weight
"harry you are literally asking me to let you play with my sister's feelings!" and before harry could respond the redhead was already making his way out of the room and as he left he slammed the door shut.
Hermione pulled away so she could look at the prince she wiped his tears for him "I am going to ask them to cancel this whole thing" the raven sighed and looked at his hand he reached out for the ring but before he could take it off Hermione put her hand on it.
Blaise nodded his head and took out his wand and they were both changed and the lights in the room turned off and the boy pulled the covers over them.
"hi hagrid" the boy replied with a small smile.

she said as she closed the book she was reading, giving full attention to her friend that she was quite worried about school had started two weeks ago and Harry's aura had suddenly changed.
Harry had told his best friends to go ahead of him since the professor had something to ask him and so after his uncomfortable conversation with professor Snape the boy was headed toward his dormitory.
"a room it is and it's final" Harry's father declared while Harry and Draco looked at the man with wide eyes and their jaws dropped.
*i dont own anything everything belongs to Hermione granger*
she stayed there with him silently supporting whatever emotions and thoughts he was fondling on the inside.
Draco was mad he wouldn't say a word to his only friends the boy would stare at his promised one and if staring at someone could kill them harry would be so long gone. Draco had seen the interaction between the raven head and that redhead oh how it pissed the boy off.
"If you did would you be so mad that I kissed Blaise?" Hearing it from Draco did rise weird emotions in his chest he didn't want to think back to earlier that day when he saw them kiss.
"I've given an oath to them that I would keep an eye on you and tell them everything that could worry me or them"
"You're sweating" he whispered and tried to touch Ron's hair but the boy was startled and moved away.
Harry let out a breath and went back to his food Ron was confused but went back to eating.
Draco recalls how polite Weasley had been when Harry first revealed that he and Draco were dating, not-so-eager but more-than-willing to make amends, simply because Harry had asked him to be. Draco remembers admiring what he had thought was self-sacrifice but realized, with time, was simply love.
As Harry’s first emergency contact, he'd been called to St. Mungo’s as soon as Harry was hospitalized. He grimaces as he remembers, as he regrets not encouraging Harry to tell Draco all those months ago.
“How long, Harry?”
, Harry,” Harry silently shakes his head, unable to muster any response other than small, repeating pleas of ‘Draco, Draco,

and that's when Ron blurted out his encounter with the said prince.
As soon as they left Ron let out a breath he didn't know he was holding.
Draco smiled at Blaise and placed his hand behind the boy's neck and pulled him toward himself and kissed him.
"we'll go with him and talk to Harry's parents and apologize for his behaviour they are still young Lucius things happen in relationships that are made at a young age but they'll overcome it as they grow older." Lucius nodded and smiled at his wife.
"you get to be with that ginger" Draco pointed in thin air "and I have to watch you both be so in love" he spoke sarcastically walking forward toward the raven once again.
that he had pulled harry after class to give him a piece of his mind but no word had come out of his mouth and that had annoyed harry so much that he pushed the blond out of his way and left.
"Ginny!" harry suddenly stood up from his chair and the redhead turned to him
"sorry" harry pushed away from his mother's hand and looked at the king.
"the kiss?" he questioned loving the way he was tormenting her with small replies.
"I think I like your sister and I would like you to know since I've decided to court her"
Draco was laying on his bed while listening to Blaise who was sat on his desk chair.
"daddy!daddy!" Draco yelled as he came running toward his parents that were sat in the main hall talking with Harry's parents.
Harry sighed as he listens to his best friend bicker over his ring.
"school?" as harry said the words he ripped the letter open making his mom wince at his harsh manners.
Harry looked at the person and his brows creased.
"Ron?!" he said as he made his way closer to the family. the said boy turned around with a shocked expression on his face.
and so the time came harry asked Ron to come up to his room after leaving his books in his own room and Ron just nodded and left.
"Hey!" She said while crouching down and picking up the book that slipped out of her hold.
"your parents promised you to a jerk!?" he said while staring at harry
"This is disgraceful don't you know who I am!" Yelled the silver head.
"Fine" the redhead sighed in defeat.
"I thought you ended things with him!" she yelled getting up from her seat startling harry in the process.
"to break things off" she replied and turn around to walk to her room but was met with ginny.
"I know I have been more mean than nice to you but I want to change that since in the end we are promised to each other aren't we" Draco moved his face closer and placed it on top of Harry's head.
Harry tried to speak with authority but no word would come out.
"him," he said while lifted his right hand showing the ring that was placed on his ring finger.
Harry was worried for Ron and Hermione since they had separate classes today and he had no clue where they had gone he couldn't find them in their respective classes.
"Daddy!" everyone turned to find a dark-haired bundle running toward James and hide behind his legs.
Draco turned around in his seat and locked eyes with Blaise.
Draco smiled at Blaise and turned to harry "follow me" and he did he followed Draco up the stairs.
"Blaise!" He said but the other man only shook his head and pulled him away from Ron.
"on how old is your sister" Ron looked confused but replied "she is younger than you so that makes her"
"Harry!" came a much softer voice helping Ron breathe once again.
"Let's get out of here Ron" and they left.
He should have never left the great hall alone only to stumble upon the only person he hated the most.
"go to bed I'm tired" Draco shooed the boy out of his room and laid on his bed staring at the ceiling.
Harry scratched the back of his head in guilt "sorry Ron, I just don't have the best memory and I don't remember much from my childhood"
Hermione walked after him but didn't say a word.
"You're 11!" She said again but Draco only looked at her with no expression.
"good" his father finally spoke
"harry...harry!!" the said boy jolted up he looked around and looked lost for a second.
"I'll eat just stop telling everything to my parents" he rolled his eyes while Hermione started placing food in front of him.
and with a simple movement of her wand, she cleaned the room and made her way toward the boy who was sat next to his bedpost on the floor.
"I like Ginny," Harry said but it came out as if he was asking a question rather than affirming it.
And soon he was sorted into his house that being Gryffindor.
"Ginny..." harry whispered and Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco walked in further and sat on his bed turning to harry who was looking around.
"This little boy" James chuckled and pulled the boy away from his leg and pushed him toward Draco.
Draco pushed harry backwards making the boy slam into the wall trapped between his arms.
But before any of them could respond the professor came back and announced they were ready for them.
"I've never been here before," Harry said as he looked around and followed hagrid.
"you were so mad at him for two years what's up with you now?" he asked as he got up from his seat and walked toward the boy and laid next to the boy.
"Harry!" Yelled the red head slapping the prince over his head that got him a glare from the raven head.
"how do you know if he's a jerk?" he questioned
"Draco" Blaise spoke with a soft tone, the said blond moved away from the door to let his friend in his room.
"would you like to meet my little boy?" he questioned as Draco stared up at him with his beautiful silver eyes.
I wish I had done this differently. Right now, I wish I’d handled all of this so much differently, better. But I didn’t. I just didn’t. That’s an explanation, it’s not an excuse, I just.

"Don't know," she replied, snatching her hand out of his sweaty grip and rubbing it off on her skirt. "Although if I did, I wouldn’t tell you. I’d much rather watch you squirm.” If possible, her smirk quirked sharper as she turned to make her second leave. “In any case, I'm just a messenger. See you in the Hall,

Harry scrutinized her, taking in her narrowed eyes and simpering smile, and waited for her to explain. She didn’t. Instead, she rocked back on her heels once, twice, then nodded and shouldered past Harry with three long strides.

Thrown off at having heard this a second time, Harry went stiff and said nothing.
"It was going to be a boy," he mumbles.
“No the fuck I did not, Draco.”
With mild worry pinching his face as various scenarios began to stampede through his mind, Harry watched as she slinked away.

to blush for over half of dinner, unable to keep his gaze from drifting to the Slytherin table? He'd never admit it.
He’s numbing out, Draco realizes, a response that his mind healer pointed out was common for him. Being aware of it was a key step towards learning how to approach it, she had said. Usually, Draco was very effective in catching himself regressing into unhealthy old habits and replacing them with more productive ones. He was learning how to take an active part in his emotionality. Most days, it went over quite nicely, keyword being

He pushed his still-damp hair back from his eyes and started off towards the Gryffindor common room to dump his gear.
“We’re working on it. We are. I am. But sometimes I just. Well. It’s not always forward movement.”
Grumbling a slew of insults under her breath, she whacks him repeatedly, cursing,
"Is this,” Draco says, “true?" He swallows once. "Is Weasley telling the truth?”

The flinch that wracks the named man washes pity across the whole group.

Draco and Harry will go back to Grimmauld Place. In the days to come, doctor’s appointments will be scheduled that the two men will have opposing opinions about the necessity of. There will be raised voices, but at Harry’s insistence, they won’t be ‘arguments,’ just ‘intense conversations.’

From the way Harry’s shoulders sag, his eyes sag half-lidded, his lips split in a melancholy but relieved smile — from the way Harry doesn’t hesitate to barrel into Draco’s chest, trying to burrow his face into Draco’s shoulder, it seems safe to say that Harry knows.

When he’s met with a pointed gaze and raised eyebrow, Harry just shrugs.

In due time, the four friends will leave the Leaky Cauldron, profusing thanks to Tom, the owner. Ron will go appease the other patrons who had been ushered out the door. Hermione will feel obliged to clear off and clean the table at which they were sat. Harry will leave a large tip, and Draco will foot the bill of everyone in the pub.

and he feels himself getting frustrated again. He feels himself wanting to curse and destroy and lash out. He feels defeated, and in that he feels incensed. Of course he couldn’t have something good. He’s done too much damage, ruined too many lives. He doesn’t deserve something as nice and pure as a family with the man he loves. And yet he feels abjectly, “Fucked over. You fucked me over, Harry.”
Harry’s nails are sharply digging into Draco’s hips.
They’ll both feel so much hurt in so many of the same ways and in so many different ways. They'll cry and cry, and they’ll hold their regrets, but they’ll both be there. For each other, they will be there.

"So people go in, buy food and then... leave with it?"
Harry got up, going over to the cabinet and opening the door to look inside, peering all around it deep in thought before he made a disgusted noise.
It still sounded rude.  Like it belonged on Tindere.
"I don't want her to get involved, I want her to know what's going on here.  That you've talked to Snape, what he's said to you.  If he won't tell you his plans he might tell her.  And keeping her in the loop of what's happening will make it easier to try and get her out and into hiding if it comes to that."
------------------------------------
------------------------------------------
"Hey," he said, stepping closer to the other boy, curving his palm onto Draco's cheek, brushing his thumb through one of the trails of tears.  "It's going to be okay."
And then Draco grabbed his books and ran.  He didn't know WHAT that was, he didn't know how that had happened.  What spell Harry had put on him, what trickery was behind it.  He was half convinced by the time he got to the Dungeons, out of breath and dizzy, that somehow that had been a test of Voldemort's that he'd failed spectacularly.
“I'm not.”  Draco got to his feet as well, glad that his legs didn't shake, though they did still have a slightly jelly like feel to them.  “I thought it was fun.  There was water and bubbles and I could pretend to be horrible at it and break dishes.”
"Oh thank Merlin."  Harry said with relief when Draco walked into the kitchen and then stopped dead halfway to the table.
"Well that's to be expected."  Harry said, then got to his feet.
"Would you shut UP!"
"Whatever, Little Prince."
Harry pulled the deed from his pocket, holding it up like he was giving the manor a chance to read it.  Smiling a bit, he stepped forward and mounted the steps.
But another part of him was prodding him to do it.  Since he had always intended for Harry to have that one... And now he could just hand it to him in person.
Harry nodded, rolling his shoulders a couple of times, raising his wand up and ready before dropping it again when Draco walked towards him.
“I deserve that.  And more.”  Harry looked back to the other man, knowing that more apologies wouldn't fix this and clearly not going to try.  “Which Auror was it?”
Was probably in there right now.
“Go back to sleep.” He said, unable to keep the cold tone out of his voice, happy that he had pulled his bed hangings closed when he had gone to bed earlier.  “I'm perfectly fine.”
Draco spoke the three words, then whipped his head around when Astoria called to him.  He looked up to Harry once more, quirking one side of his mouth up in an obvious parody of his childhood smirk.
But it wasn't as simple as that.  Snape was on the other side of that door.
He walked further in, going slowly and quietly because even though he knew that the Malfoys were not here, he almost expected to turn a corner and find Lucius there with one hand on his cane, ready to unsheathe his wand and point it directly at him.
But there was still one small part of him that did wonder if it was just something that happened.  No test, no ulterior motive, it just HAPPENED.  And if that was what it was...  Would it happen again?
wake me up, you know.  You have to be prepared for someone to be a little grouchy if you do that.”
"I think we both know what we want now."  Harry took another step closer as he spoke.
They just looked at each other, both breathing hard, both with swollen red lips and flushed faces.
"Sorry."  Draco raised his head, pushing a hand through his hair.  "I believe him.  I actually do...  I just wish he'd tell me how he was going to handle it.  I asked and he told me not to worry about it.  Which just..."
The other thing he'd noticed was an odd worn spot on the edge of it.  Like someone had rubbed it rather hard against stone to grate a bit of the roundness away from it.  Two people in Dumbledore's Army had done that to make sure they could tell it apart from a real galleon at a glance.  One was Neville, and he knew for a fact that Neville still had his coin.
But it turned to a very shocked face within just a few moments after his eyes landed on the person with Neville.
Draco looked up as Harry's voice broke through his thoughts and he smiled a little more as he moved up to the counter with him, trying not to look nervous and like he had no idea what was going on.
"I'm acting perfectly normal!"
And then he was yanked back again, heaved out of the memory and back to standing next to Tom, who fixed him with the same hungry and excited look he had just seen on the slightly younger face.
But when he looked at Draco, looked at his face.  The purple shadows painted deeper than ever under his eyes.  The paleness of his skin and the depths of his eyes that had nothing but anguish in them, he knew it was true and he knew why it was true.
----------------------------------------
Harry looked up from his book, just a few minutes after he'd started reading, and into the sharp grey eyes of Draco Malfoy who was smirking at him.  Harry opted to smile back at him, closing his book.
That was when Draco had found her and they'd had a discussion.  A very heated and pointed discussion that involved a lot of probing questions from her that he hadn't wanted to answer.  And by virtue of him not wanting to answer, she actually got the information she was looking for.
“Need is a very strong word here.”  Harry said trying to rein the other man in at least a little bit.  “Your help is useful.”
"Draco's words can be on the parchment, have him write the message he wishes to send.  I will prepare it accordingly.  So long as Draco's eyes and hands never touch either, it cannot be traced to him, no matter who is trying to find where it came from. The parchment itself can be spelled to disintegrate as soon as it leaves Narcissa's hands, or the moment it touches the hands of anyone but her before it is delivered.  Should it be seized before she reads it, there will be magic that can reform the words and trace it, this is why Draco shouldn't touch it."
"I understand that you're responsible for the break in your marriage.  But you didn't DO anything terrible to Ginny.  Yes you married her when you knew you were gay.  You pursued a life with her that you felt you had to.  If the Weasley's want to be mad at something, they should be mad that you felt so pressured by everything and everyone around you, and the weight of who you are, that you couldn't be honest about what you really wanted.  Being angry at YOU for feeling like you were backed into a corner because of the wizarding world's expectations of you is ridiculous.  They're making you a scapegoat."
The biggest part.  Harry accepted his apology.
He slid out of the compartment with Neville trailing behind him, making his way to Compartment C where Slughorn was.  He paused for a moment, hearing Draco's voice, leaning in a bit to look covertly into the compartment he heard it from and saw the blonde boy lying across the seats with his head in Pansy Parkinson's lap.
Hungry.
"Murdering Dumbledore."  Harry said casually, enjoying the look of almost terror that immediately crossed Snape's face.  "Voldemort's orders, right?  Otherwise Draco and his family are as good as dead?"
“I did it..”  Harry said, a short laugh pushing out of his chest as he looked at Draco.  “I actually did it and it was so easy...”
"I wish I had more to tell you, I really do.  But this, what happened here, and a trip to see the Gaunt's in some rather unfortunate circumstances were all that he's shown me so far."
"Get.  In.  The house."  She hissed, walking up the last few stairs and pushing past them.
"People have been vandalizing it."  Hermione said, directing with her wand after she sat down with the two men, making bowls of food sail over to the table for them to help themselves.  "Throwing things at it and magically vandalizing it as well, so it looks terrible and like it's been abandoned for centuries."
"I really fancied those chips, though.  I had wanted to ask you if we could go back."
"I smelled like lavender for days.  Ron said it was like being friends with a little old lady's purse."
"You accuse me of smelling sweet, this water smells like a vanilla explosion."  Draco said, then raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw Harry go a little pink.  "Ohhh...  You can't possibly..."
have that memory now.  That's one of
"How was it?"  Ron asked as they got into their school uniforms.
"What?"
“What?”  Neville asked, turning his head to he could see Draco, knitting his brows together in confusion.
“The internet.”  Draco said, not realizing in that moment that he looked and sounded
And what will Draco think of his primary enemy suddenly wanting to be friends? Will he embrace the unlikely kinship?
--------------------
He had no idea how he was going to get Slughorn's memory, he knew it wouldn't be as simple as walking up and asking him to.  If he was so keen to hide the conversation he'd had with Tom about it, there was no chance he'd do it again with him.
“Oh...  Couldn't find him?  Or did he turn you away?”
“Harry knew.”  Neville said once encouraged to speak.  “He saw the way you looked at him...  There was a moment, just after he took your wand.  You just looked at each other for a moment and he could see it in your face.”
with the place, he just made it a bit nicer.
“He did.  He's said more than once... That he wonders if he should have pulled you out.”
Draco himself looked every bit as Harry remembered and also nothing like.  A good height for a man, though likely falling short of his father.  Lean but strong looking in build with the very pale skin and incredibly blonde hair.  But he smiled now in a way that was real and not smirking.  It changed his appearance almost entirely, that smile.  Harry had seen it before a long time ago but it was fleeting and never lasted more than a few seconds before the nasty smirk was super imposed on top of it.
Harry smiled, then opened the door to Draco's flat, rapping his knuckles on the door frame like he had before.  “Don't forget--”
Neville trailed off, taking in a breath and letting it out again slowly, only then sort of realizing how much he was saying to Draco about Harry, going pale in the cheeks though his ears stayed red.  “I probably shouldn't have told you all of that.”
Harry tilted his head a bit as he spoke the word back to Hermione and tried to imitate the motion she made with her wands.
Harry was used to Dumbledore knowing everything even when it seemed strange that he should. But this was probably the first time Draco had been faced with it personally, and it was such a potent blow to come right NOW.
“I never in a million years would have thought I'd see the day that Harry fucking Potter was happy to hear something like this.”
"I'm not here because of what you and Draco already talked about.  Trust me, I wouldn't be here unless I had damn good reason."
Draco made a slightly odd squelching sort of sound,  unable to help laughing at himself as he smiled, rubbing his hands over his knees.  "I'm sure someone has said that name before..  But this is likely the first time it's ever been confirmed to me outright.  It's amazing you know all of this."  Draco paused for a moment, biting his lower lip, his cheeks going faintly pink as he lowered his voice even further.  "What's he like as Tom?"
So that was done.
“Will Dumbledore know this isn't Slughorn's memory?”  Harry asked, his eyes trained on Tom's as the other boy looked down at him so avidly.
Harry nodded, watching Draco seriously as he absently traced the seam-line of Draco's uniform over the inside of his knee.  "No, you're right.  Absolutely right."
But it did smell good.  And after he had picked apart a triangle of it (oblivious to their waiter standing not far off watching him like he had tentacles instead of fingers) and could identify everything in the sandwich as something he liked, he put it all back together and settled in to eat.
Harry nodded, heading for the door and Draco followed him. When they got to the door, Harry rested his hand on the frame but Draco could sense the hesitation and sense the questions in his mind.  He felt the blush creep into his cheeks again and spoke quickly to try and divert the other man's thoughts.
Those words rocketed around Harry's head as he wrestled Draco to the floor of the bathroom, scuffling with him to grab his wand, shoving it into his back pocket as he forced a hand over the other boy's mouth.  "STOP..  Stop.." Harry hissed the first but said the second more quietly as Draco struggled on the ground under him.  He saw the fear in his still tear filled grey eyes and he shook his head.  "M'not going to hurt you or do anything to you.  Swear."
"I was not speaking to you, Mr Potter.  I was speaking to my son."
"Yeah?"  Draco asked, looking down at Harry.  He smiled when the dark haired boy nodded.  "Well..  My mother is a good mother, just not the kind to make things."
Draco shook his head.  "No...  He smiled....  Smirked, almost. He said 'Someone has been telling my secrets.' and I told him that it was Dumbledore showing you these things.  But that you and I had become very very good friends.  That you were helping me with the task he had given me, that you were no longer interested in serving Dumbledore and his Order...  He went quiet for awhile, then sat on the edge of the table and looked at me rather curiously.  He asked why I had insisted on telling him myself.  And I told him that I didn't understand the message you had given me for him, but that I was reluctant to have anyone else hear it when it seemed very personal."
“Hey...”  Neville said, leaning forward against the counter where he was sitting on one of the stools, his hand stretched out towards Draco but stopped just short of touching him.  “What are you thinking about?”
But last night's had a name on it that he did recognize.  And to get another the next evening was a little strange.
“It was my mother's favourite punishment for me when I was a child.  Joke was on her, though, because I actually rather liked it.”
"About Malfoy Manor."  Ron said, then beamed at his wife, pulling her down so he could kiss her cheek, having just come in from work to join her and Harry.
-------------------------------------
That made Draco laugh and broke whatever tension he was feeling.  "I forgot about the grannies.."
But Harry wasn't committing to anything but saying he enjoyed it.  He was weighing everything, admitting that before recently he wouldn't have liked this meeting at all.  This was honesty...  And that was all he wanted.
“Can you sometimes see it coming?”  Harry asked, raising his eyebrows as he caught one hand against Draco's sleeve.
"Then we get plans in place to keep you safe.  And once we know that without a shadow of a doubt, you're covered.  Then we start trying to save Dumbledore, too."
Draco smiled a bit, just a bit, and nodded his head.  “I do appreciate that.  I want you to know that if it was the Ministry's money and I was asking for more I would understand you needing to know what it's for.”
"They could just go to restaurants, though.  Nice ones where you can sit down and eat.." He wasn't sure about this whole thing.  But he was game to try whatever Harry suggested since he was the one who knew what he was doing.
Harry turned to look at Draco who was wiping at his cheeks, his hair mussed and clothing rumpled.  "Why did the room bring us here?"
Ron bought it, Harry could tell as his friend nodded, a deep line between his eyebrows, signalling a deep thought process.  But Hermione...  Hermione had that careful and probing look on her face that made it clear she was also thinking.  And far more clearly than Ron was.
"You will
”Sorry.  I know that’s the truth but...” Harry raised his head again, folding his arms on the desk as he looked at Draco for a long few moments.  “That’s a lot to lay on a child who has to sit in class with me.  Telling him that this man right here is the only reason that you’re still alive? Which isn’t exactly true..”
He talked to what seemed to be the empty shop, but after he spoke there was movement from the shadows and a tall thin woman approached the counter.
"So what did you want?"
By the second half of the third year Draco no longer came home to multiple envelopes on his living room rug informing him of intruders.
They'd probably smirked at each other, knowing little smirks that had been growing in frequency and intensity over the course of that whole year.  But then?  They went to class and everything went to shit and... he'd never spoken to him again.
"Exactly."  Harry said, grinning even more as he held it forward on his palm for Draco to look at more closely.
“If you need money from your account it's not my business why you need it.  You shouldn't have to justify it.  If you ask for a withdrawal from your Gringott's account again I won't ask you what you need it for.  It's YOUR money, after all.  And unless you ask for something that could compromise your safety or the safety of others... I won't tell you no.”
“Right.”  Harry said, nodding and smiling just a bit.  “I have to go, time to check in with the next person in hiding.”  Harry paused, considering for a moment and then dropped his voice as though he was trying to keep someone else in Draco's flat from hearing him.  “Are you still friends with Millicent Bulstrode and Blaise Zabini?”
“Lousy sneaking git..”
"Even at the time I wondered how you were doing that summer.  Being a Malfoy and everything, we knew Voldemort was back.  We knew everything you said happened at the Tri Wizard Tournament was real.  Made me sick to think what you faced and then everyone was trying to smear you as a lunatic..." Draco shifted uncomfortably in his chair, frowning a bit then waving his hand.  "Sorry, continue.."
"It's fine."  Draco said quietly after what seemed like an hour of silence stretched between them.
"That is utter bullshit."  Harry said, speaking in such a bitter voice Draco almost cringed.  "No offence to you, Mrs Malfoy, or you, Draco, but Mr Malfoy is not innocent of anything."
"No he knew the right information.
Draco hadn't noticed until then that there was no tables in the rickety and ramshackle little shop and he frowned a bit as he fell into step with Harry, waiting until they were outside to speak.
“Violent.”  Neville said, frowning as he shook his head, reaching one hand out to smooth over Draco's shoulder, resting against it warm and heavy.
“..'Arry?”
"He didn't say much at the lunch, either.  Honestly it was just Slughorn appraising us.  Trying to decide if we were anything he could 'collect'." Harry framed the last word in air quotes, making a face.
"With flying colours, I think."  Harry said with a grin, reaching one foot out to nudge his toe against the other boy's leg.  "And he praised you?  I want to hear all about that... Tell me EVERYthing."
Because what else could they say to each other?
He didn't want Harry to know any of that conversation.  And the more he thought about it, the more poured back that he'd spoken to Neville about and shared with him.  Things he never wanted to own up to to anyone that had just come tumbling out of him.
and already pale Draco went paler when he saw the difference a simple cleaning had made.
She said it kind of quietly and uncertainly, which made Harry tip his head to the side in question.  “Is it bad?  You look worried.”
“I said, it turned me on.”  Draco raised his head then, speaking in a normal tone as he looked into Harry's eyes not far from his own.  “Fighting with you...  Doing anything that made you mad.”  He slid a hand against the back of his head, tugging at his hair as he looked uncertainly at Harry.  “But I liked the way you were looking at me.  So hard I could practically feel your eyes like they were your hands.  So I didn't pick a fight with you.  I didn't need to.”
"Catch him out?"  Harry asked, tilting his head the opposite way of Draco's and smiling at him.
Draco thawed a little after that, setting to work as Prue left towards the next contestant where Paul was waiting.  Or at least, he made it look like he was setting to work.
"And... then?  After that?"
Stupid, stupid, STUPID! He said again, but in his head as he pressed up into Harry, kissing him back hard and deep.  The voice calling him stupid was being very thoroughly ignored.  He couldn't have listened to it if he'd tried.  Not now, not while Harry's lips were pressed against his own.
"Pushy!"  Harry laughed, rubbing his nose with the back of his hand.  "I should be insulted, but it's actually a pretty accurate description.  I am pushy.  I definitely have been pushy with you in the past two weeks.  Showing up here totally unannounced kind of just cements it, doesn't it."
Despite everything, Draco couldn't help but laugh.  It was a little bit of a weak laugh, but it was a laugh all the same.  "Who would have thought that being happy would be the give away."
As things settled around him, he took a tentative step forward and a shining black door, oddly illuminated in what was endless black, was in front of him.  He reached for the door knob, turning it and stepped into a brightly lit but very shabby little room.
"You still have to show me tv sometime.  And what 'watching the news' entails, but keep going.."
"Shut up, Malfoy."  Harry muttered, sloshing the water a bit.
"Lost item returned!" An odd tinny voice chirped as he put his hand on the galleon.  With a small pop the red bubble disappeared and the galleon bounced down onto his palm.
“Relax, Draco...”  He smoothed a hand down the blonde's arm, trying to gently placate him as he smiled more genuinely.  “Even the Dark Lord knows when someone is making a point.  I didn't say anything overtly hostile, or even all that rude, I just pointed out to him that no one should be judged by their parents.”
“Good luck..”  He said as he tipped his hand up at the open window and Mimir soared off into the night.
"Fuck OFF!"  Harry got to his feet, giving Draco a shove, which didn't do much with the water resistance around them.  "Just shut your mouth."
“Phones.  Err... That doesn't tell you much, does it.”
"You can see them now?"  Harry asked, getting up off the floor.  He set the sickle on Draco's bedside table before sitting down on the bed next to him.  "You couldn't in class last year.  Or were you pretending you couldn't to make Hagrid look like a joke to Umbridge?"
Harry paused, then nodded his head once, smiling slightly again.  “Fine fine.  You make a good point.  We can arrange to have someone come and--”
Harry had started smiling as Draco spoke, nodding his head slowly as he realized what the other boy was saying was everything that Snape had failed to impart to him the year before.  Probably because Snape made it out like he WAS attacking Harry.  That he was coming at him fast and hard and it seemed like he was trying to harm him.  What Draco said framed it better.  This wasn't an attack, it was someone looking at something he didn't want them to.  A book...  He just had to close it and then whoever it was couldn't see it no matter how much they tried to peer over his shoulder.
“I stole it from you.”
"What," Ron asked as he turned to look at Harry but the said boys' eyes were glued on the jerk that had been mean to him earlier.
"they'll come around," he said trying to soothe his wife.
"Prince Draco!" When she yelled out the name everyone went silent as they stared at a royal blood strut toward the stool and sit down with a smug smile on his face.
"Harry we're going to be late!" Hermione said as soon as the boy was in her view and took a hold of his wrist.
"drake," he said and the nickname only made it worse for harry.
"I like you Draco! why don't you understand" she wailed once again as she whipped her tears away.
harry ignored her remark "I hate Draco!" he instead yelled at his parents who were sitting in front of him.
"You have to eat, your parents will be furious to hear about you skipping meals over a man you still haven't said a word to"
"say that again will you," Draco said as he harshly took a hold of Harrys' arm stopping him from moving further away.
"What," he asked
ginny came closer and got on her knees so she could finally see the boy's eyes.
"what? hard to do?" Draco was an inch away from Harry, he took a hold of his hand and brought it in between them.
"That's exactly why I'm asking!" She yelled back.
"well, it would be good for you to go to school and experience it first hand than to be stuck in your room all day".
"L..let's go" he stuttered out
Hermione shook her head and gestured to both of them that they could leave.
Harry stopped and so did the blonde.
"I saw you walk in and came to confirm"
gasps were echoing inside the hall accompanying Harry's own.
"You must be on your best behaviour my darling" spoke his mother strictly but sweetly at the same time.
"Another reason for me not to tie knots with that silver-headed arrogant brat," he said while getting up from Hermione's lap.
Draco didn't know what to say all he could think of was to harshly take a hold of Harrys' hair and pull at it making harry hiss in the process.
"Let's go," Harry said and took hold of Ron's wrist leading them both to the infirmary.
"seriously what do they want from me" harry exclaimed while dropping face-first on his bed momentarily forgetting that Draco was right behind him with his suitcase right next to his feet.
"what's wrong," Blaise asked as he took a hold of Draco's hand and removed the broken fork out his hand and took a look at it to make sure his prince wasn't injured because if he was his parents would be so mad at Blaise for not taking care of the blond.
"going to school of course," the boy said with a smile.
"I'm promised" he looked at the two who were not saying anything.
--------
Draco's eyes widened for a second before all emotions were concealed.
*i don't own anything credit goes to Ron Weasley *
"I was showing you the ring"
Ron looked offended for a while "you don't remember her?" He asked
And she left through the grand doors that the boys could presume was the entrance to the great hall.
"now? you don't wanna think this through the night?" she added
"Hermione!" harry says as he watches the girl with the curliest hair close the compartment door behind her.
harry turned his face not wanting Draco to see his warm and slightly red face.
"open the door for me" he demanded the boy didn't question and spoke the password.
but he didn't get to be dazed for a while a knock on his door pulled him back he shouted a small 'come in' and when the door opened his eyes went wide.
The professor placed a gentle hand on the boy's shoulder and silently pushed him away from the petrified student.
-hi guys I'm so sorry for such a late update and the a small one at that I have been going through looooots of stuff so been busy and mentally exhausted so I decided to post this instead of trying to make it longer I promise the next update would be better then this and once we finish this book we'll jump back to POLYAMORY.
"and why must I answer you,"  Harry said with a bitter tone not seeing the smirk that formed on the silver head's lips.
"Don't.test.me," Harry said at each word pushing his wand more into the boy's neck it was surely going to leave a mark,
the raven head turned to look at Ron with his eyebrows crease
Hermione knocked on the door and waited for Harry's reply came after a while a very muffled one when she opened the door she found Harry on his bed with his face pressed on his pillow.
Draco kept staring and saw that the redhead had calmed down now he looked at harry and found the boy smiling widely at the redhead girl.
Harry had stopped crying and was calm and collected once again he rolled his shoulders back and stood tall and proud.
Harry shook his head "my little sister! You call yourself my best mate!" Ron was offended and shocked.
Ron kept staring at Harry as the boy fixed his robes.
The steps that made his mellow warmth leave him in the cold hall made their appearance Ron "Harry" the boy let the name stumble out of his mouth.
Harry's eyes became colder as he stared back at the boy with hatred.
harry pushed Draco's hand once again and finally, the blond let Harry's hair loose and left without another word.
"mother!" harry exclaimed as he ran into the throne hall.
"isn't that unfair don't you think?" he asked tilting his head to his left.
"Mommy! I wanna see dwaco" cried a little Harry as he stared up at his mother who smiled down at her with so much love.
so harry being a very persistent boy and above all, a prince decided that he would court ginny he wanted ginny to be his and before doing anything he did want Ron to know so he decided after class the boy would talk to his friend.
"Can you stop staring?" Harry asked as he turned toward his friend.
Another day another chapter heheheh hope you guys are liking it so far I'm having much fun ☺️❤️💚
"go away!" harry yelled at Draco the boy went to the restroom only to find Draco on his way back to class.
"look at your hand," Blaise said and pointed at the table where Draco's hands were placed.
Harry stared at the boy and his eyes went wide.
"oh, Merlin beard is that why you asked about her age!? harry no! never would I let you date my sister it doesn't matter you're the prince you already belong with him! how could you even.. have you thought about my sister in all of this!" Ron was pulling at his hair at this point.
"oh sorry," he said as he pulled away still with a wide smile on his face.
the blond got up from his place and stood next to harry "I prince of Wiltshire is going to marry PRINCE harry" he emphasized the word prince to remind ginny who she was trying to get with.
"What!" Yelled the two confused as they stare at the silver head.
harry snarled "I came to end things" that did remove the sly smile from dracos face. and it did satisfy harry.
"because of this!" he yelled gesturing to Draco.
"let's get ready for bed I'm tired," Harry said trying to clear the awkwardness.
"sorry" he mumbled as he took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes.
"What's so wrong about him wearing a ring Hermione?" Ron asked confusion written on his face.
the queen of Wiltshire smiled at the guards as they went through.
-BLAISE ELORA ZABINI -PURE BLOOD -CONCEITED -SMART -A BULLY
"and why you?" he declared keeping eye contact with pansy.
as soon as he reached his room he fell against the door not being able to hold himself up any longer, he took a hold of his hair in frustration not knowing what kind of emotions were rushing through his veins, his body ached so bad he just wanted to scream, lash out and just destroy anything in his vision.
"your little boy?" he asked as he tilted his head to the side
Hermione finally put away her book and looked at the prince "what did he do, should I report to your parents?"
"fine" harry declared defeat.
the boy entered his room and put on a spell on it so no one could come in he walked toward his mirror that hung in the bathroom and stared at his face deep red lines were placed upon his cheeks and chin the mark was created by Dracos harsh movement.
“You don't go out?”
“Get stuffed, Potter.”  Draco said without hesitating, smiling just a bit when Harry chuckled.  After a moment he sighed out a low breath, dropping his voice down.  “Just let me keep it.  Please.  I won't use it unless it's life or death.  And at that point it won't really matter if I'm doing magic since it means the people you're attempting to hide me from have caught me out.  I can learn to do things the Muggle way if you just let me keep it.”
"No secret I can't stand your father."  Harry said, gently squeezing his hand against the back of Draco's neck.  "But I'm sorry you have to live through him being in Azkaban.  The Dementors don't exactly spare anyone, it must be awful to have to think of him there."
“Hm?  What did you say wrong?”
"Did Lupin find a Boggart for Slytherin to practice on in third year?  He did for us."
Draco hiccuped as tears overcame him again and Harry felt his heart well and truly ache.  Even if Draco didn't have what appeared to be any sort of relationship with Dumbledore, he didn't hate him.  Didn't see him as a threat.  Didn't want to hurt him, it was the threat to himself and his family that was driving him.  And Harry could hardly fault him for that.
