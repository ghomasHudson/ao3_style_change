A shake of his mother's head followed. 'We can't, Draco. This is the only way. And you know it, don't you?' The pale face of his mother slowly started to shine by her flowing tears. Torn, Draco was as he saw his mother in so much pain and confusion of herself as she was seated there — hopeless and helpless at the same time.
, I said!' he now shouted.
"I shall explain later," the boy answered. "Please, take me to a sheltered place."

Right that moment Ron came walking in again, nearly dropping the bowl of water at hearing Hermione's speculations. 'Are you sure?' he asked while handing the bowl to Draco.
Draco read something about that in the Prophet a while ago. Of course he didn't read the Prophet anymore but his Mother did, and his eyes happened to have caught a little part of an article, interviewing the so-called last Death Eater alive. Draco had snorted at that, feeling forgotten. Now it seemed like a second curse, being the last of the bunch.
, not even a girl could dance more gracefully than you, Draco.' Her eyes shined, almost sparkled as she said those words.

?’ Raphael rested his face upon his hand in a curious fashion, the key’s wings still fluttering between his fingers.
‘Let’s meet the day after tomorrow by the lake. I’ll tell you everything I know about the Merpeople,’ Draco told him.
Harry could feel his heart skip a beat at the woman's name. The memory of her calling out Sirius name after she had killed him coldly still made him angry and sad — still tore his soul apart every time he thought about her laugh. How she had nearly destroyed the Burrow, and how she was always on that monster his side. As he was lost in his thoughts and his friends as well, they all lowered their wands without realizing — and gave Mundungus the opportunity to disapparate.
They hid themselves again; this time behind a few empty crates, while listening to the shouting of men. A dozen loud footsteps filled the deserted street, sending crows and pigeons flying off — and leaving the four friends hidden with a small heart.
Draco actually didn't know. Well, he actually kind of did; he had wanted to tell it to him because he thought it was fair. But now that he had actually said it; it felt like he was betraying Fleur, Madame Maxime and his entire school. He ended up saying the thing he knew Harry would want to hear; the only reason why Harry would believe why he had told him about the dragons. '
Standing up again — a bit wobbly from having seated on top of the dragon for so long — Draco pulled his wand from his sleeve. A moment he waited, his eyes staring at the piece of wood he almost didn't recognize as his own anymore; the gold was almost all gone, the sapphire he loved so much as well. What had happened to it?
Potter?’
uncomfortable. There weren't any pubs near Beauxbatons and even if there were, he would never go to one. If he wanted to drink something while out in a village, he stopped by a tea-room or just waited until he was home again. The tea-rooms he was used to were decorated in whites and marbles, details were lain in with gold — but
But the angel-boy didn't seem to mind it very much, and answered immediately. "It is still there,' he started, placing a pale hand upon his chest, 'but it hasn't beaten a single beat in about two-hundred years." As the boy slowly lowered his hand again, Harry kept his eyes fixated on where his heart laid — under pale white skin, under the lines of a few scars.
" He shouted, grabbing for his nose as a throbbing pain spread quick.
Of course Arthur didn't want to believe they were
Dumbledore nodded his head. 'It is the one I received from professor Slughorn, actually. There lays some crucial information in his memory, yet he has done something to it which changes that information completely.'
Harry sighed as he thought about his words. Was he really the only one that could defeat Voldemort? Well, he was his archenemy and he had been part of his earlier defeat and rebirth so perhaps — perhaps he
Draco shrugged. 'I have no idea, Harry; must be a gap in your memory.' He couldn't help but grin a little, though, and he was sure Harry noticed as the boy gave him a weird look. It wasn't like they hadn't been
'Too — too much?' Harry asked, panting from excitement. The boy looked like a mess; dark circles around his hungry eyes and his messy hair messier than it had ever been before; it spiked in all directions
I want to give a shout-out to my friend Nette who reads all chapters before I post them! She always gives me great encouragements and was the reason I decided to post this story here in the first place! Thank you!
Looking to his left in slight surprise, he fixed his posture and turned himself towards Harry fully. 'You still have the trace on you as you're underaged for a few more days,' he explained, not willing to waste any time as he took out a flask with a damping liquid inside. 'Our plan is the following; we'll go in pairs and one of each will drink a Polyjuice potion to become the exact resemblance of you, Harry. This way they won't know whom is the real Harry and whom is the fake.'
Giving her son a rather confused look in return, she calls for Pibbly. The house-eld arrives within a few seconds, and Narcissa instructs her to bring Draco the newly purchased owl from the Manor’s owlery.
‘Get- get me a mirror,’ he tells him after taking a few breaths.
'I told you,' Draco repeated. 'Its a strange room.'
see what he just saw?
Fleur nodded again, remaining silent.
As professor Slughorn suddenly passed by, dressed in the most awful purple robes, Draco gave Harry a little push. 'Go on then,' he said to him between his teeth, keeping a little bit of a smile on his face as he saw others glance in their direction. Harry threw him a glare before hurrying himself after Slughorn in the most clumsy way; leaving Draco behind with a weird Wizard staring at him with hungry eyes.
and that everything would be alright; but little had he known that all his words had been in French, that he had forgotten their English translations by the panicking of his soul.
There were no cheers, for there was nothing to celebrate. Of course, one could celebrate Voldemort's defeat but there were too many victims that needed to be mourned first.

‘I-I see.’ Was it such a problem that Draco had his own pair of best friends as well? Why else would Harry act so weird and awkward all of the sudden? Perhaps he wasn't used to standing half-naked next to another boy.
'Please, think about it. For you, I have all the time in the world,' he had replied to Draco's confusion. And before he had left, he had taken ahold of Draco's hand and kissed it. Frozen once again, Draco had watched how Orlin marched away through the hallway again as if Draco had said
Determined and with a set mind, he walks back to the Manor. “Mother!” he shouts when his feet come to a halt in the entrance hall. Early sunlight shines in through the few windows next to the front door; throwing green shadows onto the floor as they’re all made out of emerald colored glass — almost going unnoticed amidst the equally green carpet.
It was dark underground, and dead-silent except for the noise the waterfall above their heads made. It smelled like a combination of mold and lake-water, an unpleasant mix that reminded Draco of the Black Lake at Hogwarts — the lake where he had nearly

The twins glanced at each other and then back at Draco with confused eyes. 'How do you mean, hurry up?' André asked, clearly not seeing what Draco saw.
'It's a—‘
'More importantly is what she's up to — doesn't really look like she's shopping for Christmas sales,' Harry noted before leaving the alley again, pulling Draco along. 'Maybe we should hide.'
With a lot of effort they crawled into the portrait's hole, Draco behind again. Before he closed the portrait, he took another look at the door; saw how it was opened the tiniest bit. An eye colored a pale blue was staring in his direction from the darkness. 'Thank you,' Draco whispered to it, before closing the portrait and following the others.
Harry nods and stares over the edge of the stone bridge, looking at the wild sea surrounding them. The sound is not like the relaxing sound of ocean waves, rather a dooming sound announcing death. After listening to it another while, he apparates back to the Ministry.
Alright, so this chapter is a little bit shorter because I just really wanted to write it from Harry's perspective but the following events should be written from Draco's (in my opinion). And we all know what happens during the final task and at the graveyard and what not so I mainly focused on Cedric's death and Draco's father.
, not a potion. Besides, the clouds are hovering underneath my skin rather than above. If they hovered above; the black wouldn’t be permanent.’
Silence. A pause. The Death Eaters and dark creatures left and crawled back to where they had come from. Everyone started dragging bodies of the injured and the death towards the Great Hall, Draco joining as well by supporting Luna as she tried to move forward with a broken ankle. The twins were ahead of him, in their arms the lifeless body of a small boy. He could see tears on Ansel’s face; could hear him mourn a boy whom he had never met before. A boy from a different school. A different country.
Harry looked over his shoulder at his friends, whom held a tight grip around their wands and were eyeing Draco in a suspicious way. 'Are you sure about this?' Hermione asked in a whisper tone, knowing that Harry was about to lower his wand.
Everything Draco had even known or learnt, the blond could feel seep away out of his head, through his ears and onto the dance floor. The only thought and knowledge that remained was that of Harry. If Harry would've asked him to go for a dive into the Black Lake that moment; Draco would have said

'Why? You dislike my face that much?'
bird that keeps hooting me out of my sleep.'
They both knew it was an excuse, a lie; nobody was busy the last week of school. Especially not when all exams and lessons had been canceled. But Ron quickly waved the lie away and replaced it with the truth. 'He doesn't want to see nor talk to you anymore, Draco! Neither do we!'
To Harry he gifted something he had put quite the thought in — something he had bought for himself as well. It was the smallest gift of all, but the most special. He gave it to Harry with nervous eyes and watched him struggle with unwrapping it; the tiny pieces of spello-tape not wanting to come off. After seconds of getting curiously looked at, the boy finally managed to see what it was his boyfriend had gifted him. A golden medallion the size of a thumb laid in the palm of his hand, reflecting the greens of his eyes. 'A medallion?' Harry asked and Draco nodded, gestured for him to open it. The tiniest moving photographs of a lion and a butterfly decorated it's insides; one roaring at the boy and the other fluttering its wings in anticipation. Green eyes filled with happiness stared at the animals; Harry once again amazed by magic.
. It was all new and something he thought he'd always wanted to be; an Auror.
Draco still tried to block it, and ignore Harry wasn’t there anymore, but tears were already welling up in his eyes again, for he felt a kind of frustration he’d never felt before.
'I don't want to be on a different side,
, he thought to himself. Walking up the stairs to Divination, a class he was the only one of the four of them to take, he was suddenly stopped by Dumbledore who had appeared once again out of nowhere. 'Draco, my boy,' he said with a little smile. The first thing Draco noticed was that his hand had become darker again — black as a raven's body and a night without stars. 'Can we discuss something for a minute?'
A painful feeling then took ahold of Harry's arm, and as he turned his head towards it, he realized it was the boy. "I know it must be terribly hurtful, but I beg you, for I cannot stand any longer on my own," came the boy's pleading voice — pleading yet calm, the strangest combination Harry'd ever heard.
'Aren't you cold?' Hermione now asked him. She had been seated at the table for over an hour, reading something Draco couldn't see the title of. At the mention of feeling cold, he suddenly realized he hadn't put his jumper back on; had left it somewhere outside.
I'm so pleased to have wrapped up the Half-Blood Prince part because it seriously has been a rollercoaster for me on how to find what I wanted to do with it. Should I include the Sectumsempra or not? But, I realized, I just had to.
Trying to maintain his anger, Draco raised his chin a little while squinting his eyes at the boy. 'Bet I look better in them than her — judging by the looks of her child she herself isn't quite the beauty,
A cry; his own at the sight of it. Footsteps hurried themselves over to him and his mother's face came into view. A few streaks of messy blond and dark brown hair — dull grey eyes that reminded him of his own. 'My dear boy,' she whispered while cupping his face in the palm of her hand. 'You're alive.'
"The attic —
'About Harry,' she answered, a smile lingering upon her lips.

Lupin had also been there, but left after dinner unfortunately. Harry hadn't really had much time to talk to him but had enjoyed his presence, had enjoyed watching Draco ask him a thousand-and-one questions about werewolves and other creatures Harry had never heard of before. He had still felt the stinging eyes of Arthur Weasley casted upon Draco with suspicion during every minute of dinner time; but he hadn't blamed him for it. It had just been weird, to see the man that way as he knew Arthur as a funny man whom liked to laugh a lot. Perhaps he had been acting that way to protect his beloved ones; afraid Draco would betray them and therefore betray his family.
But it made Draco smile, even though it was a weak one. ‘
Draco frowns. How could it be that he was the last Death Eater alive? Wasn't there anyone else left? 'What about Dolohov? I thought he was still in Azkaban, alive and well?'
What were they going to say? What was going to happen?
'I don't believe he knows there's a connection; that he knows that I can see through his eyes.'
‘It does?’ Draco asked as he moved closer to the boy in question, eyes locked in his. It made Harry move away a little as well, but hesitantly, as if he actually didn’t want to. ‘Her song’s words were sang in Mermish. I couldn’t understand
A nod of her curly head followed. 'He was quite the disastrous date, wasn't he?' she then said, letting out a little laugh that shortly after was followed by many more.
It felt amazing to fly, Draco then realized. And even more amazing to do so with Harry. The view on the water and mountains around Hogwarts was absolutely stunning from above. Mesmerizing. The trees were coloring again, the sun sneaking between the clouds. He felt free and
'Castor Idel,' Draco started.
"I shall explain later," the boy repeated. "Please…"
'Alright,' Harry said as he took a deep breath. 'A dragon then?'
' to before at the Gryffindor table, but he couldn't remember his name. He did however remember him as the single other boy that had asked another boy to the Yule Ball — of the pair that had danced closer to each other than any other couple. 'You're here,' the boy called out. Draco could hear the slightest Irish accent in his words and it seemed to suit the boy's appearance and actions even more. 'Harry will be stoked! Hey, Harry!'
'Didn't we have this conversation two time already?' Draco interrupted him.
'So you know him?' Bellatrix reacted, wand placed underneath Harry's chin. 'Let's keep you a bit longer then, shall we? Let's see what that pretty face of you looks like after a few hours.' She glanced over her shoulder at Lucius Malfoy, indicating that he had to take Harry and his friends away.
Draco's nostrils flared as he let out a deep sigh. He took ahold of Harry's face with both his hands and stared into the boy's emerald eyes. 'Stop saying you're sorry, Harry. There's
can't certainly see me here in London!' he told him, glancing over his shoulder to only see some confused Muggles stare back.
Lost for words, Harry remained silent for a good minute. He just needed a moment to let it all drench into his brain; let all this new,
Confused and unsure of what to do, Harry looked at the blond again — still standing there amongst fallen, silent figures. 'We have to,' he concluded, before lowering Draco's wand. He slowly walked over to Dobby, took the house-elf's hand in his. Ignoring the raised wands of Hermione and Ron, Draco joined Harry by his side, taking Dobby's other hand. The house-elf seemed cautious as well, and glanced up at Draco with even huger eyes than he already had. Eventually Hermione and Ron had to give in, lower their wands and take ahold of Dobby as well. The house-elf gave them one last look before he sent them traveling through dimensions, all the way to Shell Cottage.
The healer replied with a sigh and guided the man to a door at the end of the hallway. Harry and Ron followed a few seconds laters. What they saw inside the room made both their stomachs flip.
Draco faced her and put on a little smile. He himself wasn't entirely sure about that, but her words were reassuring in some way. 'Why did you choose me, out of all the boys?' he asked her.
"Got to do my homework first!" Harry shouted back.
The boy gestured for Draco to come over and Draco's feet obeyed without second thought.
'A signed copy,' Draco noted, raising his index finger and watching Molly Weasley slowly melt away as she opened the book to look at her idol's signature.
Curious, Draco opens the letter and tries to decipher Potter's messy handwriting.
‘Can— can I ask you something?’ Harry then said, his voice a slight whisper.
It didn't seem to work. Harry still looked frustrated or irritated; whatever emotion it was, it wasn't the right one. 'Why aren't you mad at me like all the others? You should hate the fact that Hogwarts now has two Champions and your school only one. You should hate me because I am that second Champion. You should-'
"You don't look hurt to me, my boy," the woman responded, eyebrows frown and worried eyes still upon Harry.
‘But that’s good, isn’t it?’ Harry gave himself another head-to-toe look, unsure. It looked as if the designer hadn't been able to decide wether to color the shirt red or black and had ended up with going for both.
Ron follows, confusion read all over his face. He pulls the golden gate closed and stares at Harry for a while before asking
"Stop calling me those names, mother!" Came another voice, slightly muffled, from downstairs.
Draco gave her a weak smile and bended his head for her. '
As he neared the Manor itself, he could see the silhouette of his mother, standing in front of one of the windows and looking at the garden with a blank face. She looked somber and held a hand to her neck — upon a medallion Draco knew contained a photograph of him as a five-year old. That very medallion had been Draco's inspiration for Harry's gift; knowing that it had always given his mother the feeling that he was somehow there, beside her, all the time. He hid behind one of the peacock-figured hedges and watched her from afar, glanced upon his timepiece to notice there were only two minutes left. The panic in his body turned to hysteria as he had no idea where that damned rotten apple could — be… His eyes that had still been set on his mother had followed her look — had moved themselves to the object she was so blankly staring at; a rotten apple, all abandoned in the middle of the large field of grass.
Whispers broke loose and smiles appeared all throughout the Great Hall. Draco himself even smiled, as he had always loved dressing up; especially for something as grand as a ball. Dumbledore explained a bit more about it and when it would take place. Hogwarts students from fourth year and up would be allowed to attend; younger students could go as well when asked by an older student.

‘Please tell me this all isn’t still a dream?’ They had retreated to their little space; Draco sprawled on top of their four-poster bed wrapped in what seemed six blankets and Harry standing beside it, buttoning his robes again.
would want to be him!' Draco's voice was starting to tremble and he could feel the salt of his unshed tears sting behind his eyes.
Twines. Bristles.
Draco lifted his head again to kiss Harry and slowly slid his hands underneath the boy's jumper. The cold touch of his fingertips against Harry's skin made the boy shiver and Draco smiled, biting Harry's bottom lip by doing so. The boy didn't even seem to notice he got bitten as he deepened his kiss even further, his tongue doing the same clumsy dance they had done with their feet the night before. But Draco didn't mind, it was part of whom Harry was; a clumsy little lion. And a hungry one it seemed so as well, as the boy pushed Draco forward and made them stumble upon Draco's bed. Draco opened his eyes again and gave Harry a wide-eyed stare as he felt the boy's weight and
Harry seemed frozen for a second. Or shocked. Perhaps

Placing his hand now on Draco's cheek, Harry slowly wiped the tears away with the warmth of his thumb. 'Why, my angel? Because of
idea how much I missed you,' Harry told him.
Knocking on his door made Draco drop his comb, finding Fleur on the other side. 'Can I use your comb? I think I forgot mine,' she asked, her eyes already glancing at the mentioned golden object that had fallen to the floor.

; I've always wanted to see what your common room looked like.' Finally able to take a look around, he took a peek through the crowd at the roaring fireplace, at the red walls and ceiling and at the many portraits decorating the room. Two flights of stairs indicated the way to the dorms and velvet sofas in blood red were pushed against the walls to make space for the lions their party. Accents and details in gold were everywhere and the only ugly thing Draco's eye could spot was a board against the wall that held pieces of parchments with school announcements and exam dates. A few photographs were spread in between the portraits, showing off graduates and current students of the House flying on brooms, swimming in the Lake or showing off various of golden medals in other sports. His eye fell upon one picture in particular; a close up of a boy, his hair blown out of his face and a scar criss-crossing from forehead to eye; a picture of Harry flying.

Potter's Latin sounds like a lot of mumbling but Draco catches something that could be translated to '
As the evening fell, Harry announced he was going to see Dumbledore in his office. He already rose from the sofa, took his jacket and wanted to leave as Draco took him by his arm. 'Wait,' he said to him. The boy turned around, a little smile on his face as he awaited what Draco wanted to say. 'Remember when I asked you wether nothing else mattered besides from us being together — from me being safe and here with you?' he asked, not daring to look at Harry's eyes as he wanted to hear the boy renew his promise.
A loud knock on the door and Harry was shook out of his thoughts. A few hours had passed and it was already late in the afternoon; the sky starting to turn darker by the second and the Dursleys their old home becoming more and more deserted. He had moved all his stuff to the living room and had been waiting on his trunk — the only decent piece in the room to sit on — with a book at hand which Draco had lent him in fourth year. It was entirely written in French and even though Harry still couldn't understand most of it — some things he could, and it warmed his heart in knowing it brought him closer to his beloved one.
about your task before acting,' he explained. Draco nodded his head, another tear rolling off his cheek but getting wiped away by the back of his hand. His other hand was placed on his stomach, slowly tracing one of the scars. 'Look, you are just as beautiful with those scars as without them,' Harry assured him, his eyes not leaving Draco's once. 'You will always remain to be as gorgeous as the butterfly you want to be.'
'Will he be alright?' Harry asked, his breathing rapid and the whole room spinning around in circles like life had become one big ferris wheel. How could he have been so wrong? Never had his mind even thought about the fact that Draco had been the mystery wizard standing there — murdering Dumbledore as his task. Of course he had never truly known what Draco's task had been; only what task he had to help Castor with. Of course it had had to be something very dangerous, as Voldemort had placed a curse inside of him that would kill him at the slightest hint of what it was. Of course Harry should've known. Of course he should've known better. He then remembered Draco's timepiece in the pocket of his trousers -- always there for must it every come in handy, just like the boy had said. He could’ve known.
'Come on, Draco! It's either him or it's not! It can't be something in between!' Bellatrix started to become irritated and gave Draco a push against his shoulder.
' which had been laying on his tongue for already a while. He wanted to protect Draco; wanted to keep him safe and never see him hurt again. There wasn't any pain readable in the boy's eyes, however, and that fact confused Harry above all. Was there something strange going on that made the boy seem so emotionless? Was he under the Imperius Curse? Or was there another reason? But Harry had seen that single tear that had shown him that the real Draco he knew so well was still in there somewhere...
He dragged the French with him towards the pitch, dooming up in the distance. Draco swallowed at the sight of the three goal posts, high in the air like moons of steel. House colored towers surrounded it and even though Draco had always been interested in getting to know every little detail about Hogwarts and its Houses, he would skip the Quidditch pitch easily if he could. At least, if it involved any flying. But Harry's grip was tight and as much as Draco tried to pull himself away; Harry just wouldn’t let go.
. Still, I don't really appreciate that
A push against Draco's shoulder then followed, and as he stumbled a few steps backwards; everyone in the room seemed to have noticed. As Castor lifted one of his hands dramatically, ready to say something to Draco in an angry fashion, professor Snape walked over to them with a rather displeased expression on his face. 'Causing a scene, mister Idel?'
'The fear, Harry. The fear for the Tournament. The fear when your name suddenly got called. I remember when you told me about having had enough awful adventures in the past; I figured you were telling the truth,
'Trust me, Harry,' he interrupted him. The man didn't even seem to have the energy to look up into his eyes, and also let his hand slide of Harry's shoulder as he leaned against a pillar of the tower's structure.
'I am,' Harry replied in a hushed voice of himself. 'I must know what he's up to — I must see it with my own eyes. Especially if you can't tell me personally.'
"Why not?" Harry managed to reply, unaware that this boy, who was a complete stranger to him, knew his name.
'Why? You would

'Others?' Ron asked, but Neville ignored his words — was already on his way again.

They both lowered themselves in the warm water of the bathtub and immediately a few of the many taps the bath possessed shot colorful soaps and foams into the liquid. Draco smelled the scent of pine mixed with that of lemons. He knew Harry carried the pine scent and he himself had always been told a faint lemony scent lingered around his presence. The taps worked accordingly to whom entered its waters; adding the scents they liked the most. Harry seemed to relax at smelling the scent of pine and Draco watched as his green eyes disappeared behind his foggy spectacles.
Potter?'
'Why would you?'
Perhaps it was only for the best that he couldn't leave the Manor during those years; the hatred towards those who'd fought on the wrong side was still high. People who had changed their opinions and had apologized for their actions were still being haunted with their past; called names on the street. Draco couldn't even imagine what reactions he'd draw out of people if they'd even notice his presence in Diagon Alley.
"Will do."
'Rita Skeeter, dear,' she replied, a self-writing quill penning down unspoken words by her side.
Draco clawed at him, aiming for the dark and unfeeling eyes, and the knight barely flinched. “I WILL NOT ALLOW IT! AS PRINCE OF YOUR KINGDOM I FORBID IT!”
“Hold on…” Ron said slowly, eyes flitting between the other two. “The Prince. You were making out with the Prince?!”
“Oi, Potter, watch it or I’ll have father make sure there’s no wood for the fire in the kitchen for the rest of the week.”
“So? Are you going to tell me what I’m doing wrong?”
Ron puffed out his chest and Hermione snorted at his display of grandeur. “Yeah, I do! One of his Royal Knights.”
Vernon’s face fell and he rushed to Dudley’s side. “But Dudders, you must!”
Hi everyone! Thanks so much for sticking with us for this long. This is a shorter chapter, hope that's ok! In the next one the sexual tension is gonna be ridiculous, so prepare yourselves. The ball will also be coming soon, so stay tuned! I hope you're enjoying the story so far. Please comment and let us know if you enjoyed it! I really had fun writing Hermione. She's so cute and amazing. Also...notice any hints about what's going to happen as far as harry's magic is concerned? ;)
“The Carrows take trophies.”
Harry stared, dumbfounded, as the pair grabbed their personal belongings and walked away towards the car park. Draco Malfoy liked men? Harry never would’ve thought. Though, he supposed he hadn’t known that fact about himself until recently. Once the girls were out of earshot, Malfoy turned to Harry with a defensive glare. Only then did Harry realize that he had been staring at Malfoy stupidly.
“Uh, alright then. You sure?”
“I said: Watch. Where. You’re. Going. Arsehole.”
“Hmm.” Draco began to kick more methodically this time; although he was all knees and flailing limbs he still managed to move a few feet closer to Harry.
PS: what pairings would you like to see from me? I'm planning on writing another 30kish fic. Also, I am ALWAYS looking for fic requests!! Any pairing, go ahead and try me!
Draco was paralyzed. He couldn’t mean…?
“Beautiful,” Harry whispered, trailing his mouth down Draco’s heaving chest.
Draco felt as though he had been lying beneath his satin sheets for an eternity. In reality, however, it’d only been a few hours, but time seemed impossible to measure when all he could think about was the way Harry’s hands had felt on his skin the night before. Draco groaned into his pillow, feeling hot and restless. He’d never been so attracted to another person before, never so completely infatuated, and he hated everything about it. Why would he, a Prince, have his heart set on someone so unattainable? He could have anyone he wanted, man or woman, and yet all he could think about was Potter. He was undeniably turned on; even the mere thought of Harry pressed against him had him hard and yearning.
Draco made a face. “You’d eat it raw?”
-Bruises on neck, legs, chest
“Yes, Sir,” Harry mumbled.
Lucius considered this for a moment, tapping his long, glossy fingernails against his desk.
Harry continued on the path to the market, leaves crunching beneath his feet. Fall was ending, and soon it would be spring; this thought made Harry uneasy, although he was unsure why. But before Harry could become fully immersed in his own thoughts, he spotted two familiar figures sprinting towards him.
“Salisbury. The first attacks this week were in Salisbury.”
“Afraid you’ll mess up your clothes?” Harry said patronizingly, eyeing Draco up and down. “Ron tells me you have an endless supply.”
Harry nodded stiffly, watching as the King and his followers made a swift exit, and sat numbly on the bed. His thoughts were a jumbled haze of confusion and fading adrenaline. Were all death row inmates treated with such grace? Had the King made a mistake? Harry sighed, breath leaving him in tense, wavering bursts. All of this seemed like some sort of perverse dream.
Hermione beamed. “That would be wonderful, Harry! Hopefully you can get things done quicker than Ronald.”
“I don’t trust it,” Ron declared, crossing his arms. “He’s the biggest arsehole I’ve ever met. Nothing about the man is pleasant.”
“Yes, I am suggesting that you chase him down. Apologize. Explain to him that he shouldn’t treat you any differently. Isn’t that why you kept it from him in the first place?”
“Of course we’d allow it,” Harry said fondly as Scorpius yelled ‘YAY!’ at the mere suggestion. “He loves you, Narcissa. Really, he does.”
“What?!” Ron seemed have worked it out, now. “ You mean...the Draco you’ve been talking about is the bloody Prince?!”
“YOU’RE BLINDED BY YOUR OWN IDIOCY!” He bellowed. His words were pure anger, pure ferociousness, and yet they still contained a calm, even control. “You've brought shame upon the Royal Family. Every ancestor, every pureblooded witch or wizard who has shaped our legacy for centuries, betrayed.”
“What is going on?!” Harry said in his harshest whisper possible. "I don't appreciate being kidnapped by my only two friends!"
Draco's eyes widened and his mouth fell open just slightly. “Pardon?!”
“Fuck you,” Draco hissed as Harry pretended to gently caress his hair, only to pull. “You know very well what I want you to do.”
“Fuck off, servant.”
“Eager, aren’t you?” Harry asked while struggling with the buttons.  “God, why do you wear so much fucking clothes all the time?” He hissed, practically tearing Draco’s first layer off in frustration. Draco took in a shuddering breath, feeling the hot outline of Harry’s cock against his thigh. It...was a generous size, Draco could tell, and suddenly his legs turned to jelly. But Harry couldn’t know that, he’d already humiliated himself enough, so he gathered every ounce of self discipline he had left.
“I’m still the Prince, you know! I could have your family in debt by tomorrow evening if I wanted to!”
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. Ron smiled back, to his relief, and joined in.
He ignored the incessant knocking of his servant, who normally prepared him for the day if requested. But today, Draco was in no mood to be fretted over.
“You have quite a naughty mouth for a prince,” Harry said with a smirk. He didn’t intend it to sound the way it did, but Draco certainly interpreted it as such being as he dove back under the water to hide his rosy cheeks. Harry felt a quick surge of embarrassment only to feel rather pleased by his ability to make Draco blush. It was gratifying, seeing someone who thought so highly of themselves become a flushed schoolgirl. Not to mention, it made Draco appear more delectable than he already did.
He was completely and utterly fucked.
“Hold on, Pansy. A Muggleborn?!”
“Good, good. Now you won’t freeze to death on your way home. See you next time?” Harry asked, praying that the hope in his voice was undetectable.
Harry scoffed and turned around, beginning to walk back to the Dursley’s.
“Not so fast, Boy,” Vernon growled. He had finally dragged his enormous body down the stairs and was now mere inches away from Harry, who could see the small hairs growing out of his pig-like nose. Harry swirled around, swallowing.
“Leave me the hell alone and sleep it off, Potter!” Draco snapped.
He jiggled his leg, alternating between burrowing into his thin blanket and tossing around like a fish. What is it with these bloody fish metaphors? He thought as he picked dirt from under his nails.
She was quite tall and had hair black as midnight and walnut-colored skin. She moved elegantly, poised, her neck long and straight, her dark hair captured in an immaculate bun, and she wore a black leotard and tights and a short, sheer-ish pink skirt tied at her waist. “Are you a friend of Draco’s?” she asked.
Draco knew, from drills, that it was important to keep the shield wall intact, shields interlocked, one over the other, held at a consistent height across the line. A weakness in the wall meant it could be penetrated, and then everyone in the back, behind the wall, was left vulnerable.
“Well, Seamus did,” said Harry.
“Um, yes, alright. How about
Andromeda smiled. “Came out that way. Big spiky mess of hair, right from the start. All different colors, like his mother.” She left Draco, then, and drifted back over to Narcissa, putting a hand on her back, and Draco watched, his chest full of warmth, as his mother leaned against her. They were quite different, the two of them, but there was a sameness in the way they smiled and in the shape of their faces, and in the way they held themselves. You could tell they were sisters.
“I love you, too,” said Draco, before Harry banished their clothes.
Draco noticed something else strange, then. He’d seen lights on the lake in his peripheral vision a moment before, and assumed they were the reflections of the moons. But now he saw they were not. The lights were hovering over the water, shining and golden. Draco jumped to his feet and ran to where Potter was still shuffling towards the lake. He took in Potter’s expression, which was completely slack even though his eyes were open. He hadn’t put his glasses on, and his eyes reflected the glow over the water. Draco waved a hand in front of his face, but Potter simply walked into it, undeterred. The humming noise was getting louder.
“Fucking hell, how fucked up
“It wasn’t fair to Harry, though. You’ve got to admit that,” Sarah said. She was very protective of Harry, this Pansy knew, and understood all too well.
Harry huffed a laugh. “Yeah, why not, right?”
Shit, thought Draco. Shit. Please don’t say muggle-born. Please don’t say muggle-born.
And now, Dean and Seamus, thrilled by Harry’s recent declaration that he liked not only women, but men, too, were trying to drag Harry along to some male strip club that supposedly everyone was talking about. Harry’d only heard Dean and Seamus talking about it, truth be told, but then again, most of his friends weren’t the sort to get excited about strip clubs.
to suck you off?” Draco knew he was toeing some invisible line, possibly crossing it. Eh, not possibly. He knew exactly what he was doing, knew that he’d basically taken a running leap over said line, but he hadn’t been able to get himself to stop.
It struck Harry then that he wanted that. He wanted an easy, simple thing. Something uncomplicated and healthy, something that was good for him.
The second thing that became clear was that they’d stumbled into a political clusterfuck. The Kingdom of March – which included everything on this landmass from the little territory of North March to a separate kingdom in the south (which was on the other side of a desert) – was in the middle of a civil war. It all sounded very complicated, but the gist of it was that the Queen who was currently occupying the throne, named Otrea (though she was often referred to as ‘The False Queen’), was an outsider from the kingdom to the south, and had managed to come to power through a marriage that had been part of a treaty, and then a series of questionable deaths, including those of William’s parents.
He wanted, suddenly, to tell Malfoy. Tell him that if you cared a bit, if you let yourself get even a tiny bit concerned about another person, even someone you didn’t think you liked all that much, nice things might come from that.
“You broke up?” asked Draco, raising his head. That was the best news. The absolute best news. He smiled.
Harry snorted and shook his head, then stepped over to Draco and pulled him against his chest and kissed his cheek. “Okay, you weirdo. I’m in. We’ll try to talk Charlie into it when we get home.”
It was rude and unforgivable and boorish and godammit, it had made Draco even harder than he’d been when he was balls deep in Michael. Vaguely, he knew it wasn’t entirely healthy, to want Potter to act like such a Neanderthal, like he had some claim over Draco’s time (not to mention his body), like he even had any right to be in Draco’s flat at all. He should have kicked his arse to the curb the moment he recovered from the shock.
But when they got down to the waterfall, no one was there. “Oh, you thought Harry was here?” Edwin said, snidely. “Waiting to mount you? Sorry to disappoint, but it’s just me.” Draco felt a rough length of rope circling over his wrists, and he tried to jerk away, but Edwin held him.
Well, Harry wasn’t going to stand by and take
a good person, a good man, even if he didn’t believe it.
Draco began to move his hand up and down his cock and Harry resumed his own wanking and brought his mouth back to Draco’s and his free hand to Draco’s chest, slipping up underneath the pajama top to find bare skin. He pinched Draco’s nipples and licked into Draco’s mouth and tugged at his own cock and soon he was coming.
Misty Reeve?” she managed.
“No!’ he cried, holding his hands up. “Wouldn’t want you to, ah, catch it.”
don’t understand why. What’s happening?” He swayed slightly.
“So,” he said, running his hand through his hair and feeling very foolish and awkward all of a sudden. “That really is all I wanted to say.”
. Sweet Salazar, he was going to come and Harry fucking Potter was right here watching him do it. He wanted to paint Potter with it, and then wanted Potter to make him lick it off.
One weekend in late February, Charlie said he had business in Brasov regarding a Peruvian Vipertooth that a wizard had been keeping illegally in Austria. Vipertooths were one of the most deadly species of dragon, and the only species that the Sanctuary had never taken in, so it was going to be a very complicated process if they did decide to take this one. Charlie left on Friday after work and was supposed to come home Sunday.

“No, I know,” Pansy said. She glanced at her watch. “Well, I’ve got to get to work. And I’m sure you’ve got to get going, kiss more babies and shake more hands, and whatever it is you do all day. But let’s think about Blaise and Daphne, okay? Let’s see if we can’t figure out who wanted them to get married, and why.”
By the time they got back to the Ministry, it was close to lunch. “Robards has been looking for you,” said Doug Peabody, Robards’s second-in-command, as they were walking by his office
“I don’t know! Hadn’t gotten that far!” Draco spat, crossing his arms and glowering.
“Is that...silk?” Potter asked, not even making an attempt to compose himself. Draco puffed out his chest just slightly.
“Good to meet you, mate,” Ron said, waving awkwardly. “You seem like a pretty decent bloke.”
“Come on. You’re acting like a drunkard.”
“I love you Gramma! Love you! Love love love gramma!” Scorpius cooed.
“Trust me, Potter. You don’t want to talk to the Minister of Magic right now. I’ll do it,” Draco looked down at the device in his hands and furrowed his brow, puzzled. Buttons with the numbers 0-9 covered its surface, and under those numbers were tiny letters. “How does this work?”
“You’re the one who came here desperate to talk about this,” Hermione said curtly, but without any venom. “But all right.”
Harry smiled and held up the book. “Library.”
Time passed sluggishly, and Harry’s chores seemed to be even more intolerable than usual. Harry was restless. So, naturally, when he was handed a very glittery and flamboyant envelope from the Royal Family, he was shellshocked. Vernon had laughed his fat arse off at the fact that Harry had actually gotten mail for once, insisting that it must have been a mistake. However, he shut his mouth when Harry read the letter out loud. A Royal Ball. To find a spouse for the Prince himself. And Harry, of all people, was invited. Of course, Dudley had received one too, but it still served as a complete and utter surprise. How did the Royal Family even know Harry’s name?
"You're so easy," Harry said, amused and turned on all at once. "Who knew our kingdom's Prince would be so lascivious?"
“So, Harry,” Hermione continued, ignoring Ron’s apology. “Do you plan on meeting anyone at the ball?”
“Glad you understand that you’re not in mortal peril. Anyway, today let's just focus on you not drowning.”
“I could have died, Potter!” Draco bellowed, white-blond hair now a wet mop.
“And I thought you said that I couldn’t,” Draco said, shooting Harry a pointed glare. A faint, embarrassed blush dusting his pale cheeks.
“Harry, Ronald. Ronald, Harry.”
Draco was restless. He stared at the half-completed homework his tutors had assigned but could not bring himself to do more of it. He sighed, falling back onto his moss-green four-poster bed with a thump. He closed his eyes as he rubbed his temples; it had been a long day. First, in the morning, he had had potions class (which was fine enough) but that was followed by the history of magic, which was less fine and more along the lines of horrifically boring. Tutor Binns had lectured for a whole hour on the reason for the creation of the seasoning potion. And then there had been that whole debacle in town with that Potter-boy. Potter was a disrespectful lowlife who didn’t know his place, however he found himself yearning to spend more time with him. Perhaps for the independence? The experience? Surely it could not have been the commoner himself.
Harry laughed at Draco’s confused expression and took a step forward. He pressed himself up against Draco’s warm chest, and he could feel the quickness of his breathing and heartbeat. Harry laced a hesitant hand through Draco’s gelled hair, remembering with a sharp fondness how soft it was without all the product.
“You’re not bad looking, Harry,” Hermione said sweetly. “And you’re sweet.” Harry blushed further at her compliment.
“The next were...where? Exeter? And then Plymouth?”
Pansy stood up, practically forcing Draco off. Her chocolate brown locks bounced around her shoulders as waved daintily before making a swift exit to Merlin knows where, heels clopping down the corridor.
Draco nodded stiffly. “Good, good. Who wouldn’t be?”
Ronda snorted out a laugh and her messy ,red pixie cut flopped around with every movement of her head. “Spending time together? Really, ‘Mione? You can just say it, you know. They’re fucking!”
Now it was Harry's turn to blush. “It, er, I didn't want to go too fast since it's your first time and all--”
“Bossy,” Harry murmured against Draco’s lips, pushing into him nice and slow. Draco threw his head back in pleasure, mumbling out a “thank God” as Harry filled him up.
“Not just a new case, Harry. We’ve...never seen anything like this from a run-of-the-mill witch or wizard,” Kingsley swallowed. “Someone is killing Muggles. Thirty of them thus far.”
-Fractured ribs, 1-3 and 5
“You left without notifying me.”
“Hm.” Draco stepped away now, smoothing his hair back. “I see. I wonder, were you invited to the Prince’s ball?”
“You don’t have to be quiet, you know. No one can hear us.”
“You’re disgusting,” Draco said, smiling despite himself.
“Yeah! But he’s...the Prince is Draco!”
Harry shrugged, trying in vain to smooth down his hair, and walked out. The moment the door shut behind him, his throat constricted in sudden dread. What if Draco had come to break...whatever it was they had, off? Maybe he’d decided that Harry was beneath him, after all. After gathering his thoughts and taking a few deep breaths, Harry walked down the stairs gingerly. His eyes immediately landed on the back of a very blond head seated on the family’s worn couch. Mrs. Weasley was bustling around in the kitchen, apologizing over and over for making Draco wait.
“Arrested? For what? Talking back to his snob of a son who can’t even handle an insult?”
"Oh, I know I can. Bet you'd open up nice and easy, since you're such a little slut for me."
“Thank you,” Harry said politely. “I’d like to think so.”
And to top everything off about that day, his father had demanded that he take on a partner! Draco shifted uneasily, his nerves on edge just thinking about it. Unable to bear sitting down and continuing to brood about it, however, Draco decided to go for a ride on his broomstick.
Draco was nonplussed by the fact that Pansy seemed to know exactly what he was thinking. She had always known Draco practically as well as he knew himself.
“So chivalrous,” Hermione observed. “Part of your knightly code, I presume?”
Harry shook his head in an attempt to snap himself out of it. Whether he liked it or not this was his life, and there was little he could do other than grin and bear it. The only activity Harry sometimes looked forward to these days was his daily trip to the marketplace. He lived in a large city and most people knew little of his lack of magic, earning him the treatment of an actual human being. On days where there was little shopping to be done, Harry would pace around the city and savor the blissful feeling of freedom. Maybe today, if he was lucky, he could clean the war zone that was Dudley’s room in time for him to make his run to the market. However cleaning it would be a nearly impossible feat in itself; he didn’t know if he could survive it. Some of the stuff strewn on the floor, Harry had observed, were definite health hazards, such as those pretzels that grown several strange, green, furry masses. Harry shivered in disgust while scooping the burnt, misshapen eggs onto the fine china plates that his stepfamily insisted on using. After placing them on a serving platter with two cups of lukewarm tea, Harry began his ascent. First he dropped off Vernon’s plate, leaving it on the nightstand with only a fat hand leaden with jewels waving him away as acknowledgement. He dropped the remaining platter on Dudley’s lap, giving Dudley, who had nodded off, a rude awakening.
“Ah! Aurors. Always a pleasure. You’ll be in room number three. Right across from the lavatories.” She handed Potter a rustic silver key. He grabbed it and turned towards Draco.
“Tired?” Potter asked . Draco flushed and looked at the floor. Was he that obvious?
Hermione rolled her eyes and scoffed when Ron planted a sloppy kiss on her cheek.
“Normally I’d rather die than go to a royal ball. But I promised that haughty arse that I’d show up, so. Thanks Ron.”
“Answering your question,” Potter glared at Draco and then used two of his fingers to lift Draco’s thumb and press it against the number three. Draco could hardly move-- was Potter trying to kill him?
And sure enough, she was, staring at Harriet cockily while leaning up against a stall. Her eyes were cold, calculating, and her arms were crossed. She grinned, white teeth bright in the dim light of the room.  “You don’t have your little mudblood friends to defend you? What are you doing to do, without them, Potter?” Draca said, pretty face contorting into a rather ugly expression of false sympathy. Harriet swallowed, taking no offence, and took a daring step forward.
“Then you wouldn’t have food either, Potter. You wouldn’t even be able to eat our leftovers.” Dudley responded, his beady eyes narrowing.
Draco said nothing. His body was tense now, rather than pliant and relaxed like it had been just moments before. Harry immediately regretted bringing this up. Perhaps Draco wasn’t ready yet.
Harry took a moment to answer him. His ears were still stuffed with invisible cotton and his vision was still tinged with red hot panic.
“Severe?!” Lucius laughed, strained, and Draco cringed. “He caused it! His magic it seems to have been released. Half of the dungeon was destroyed!” Lucius said, eyes glinting. “Such power...if I had not seen it with my own eyes, even I would have been skeptical.”
“You weren't under the water for more than ten seconds. How else were you supposed to get in? I’m holding you now, aren’t I?”
Ah, Harry thought to himself. There’s Malfoy. Much more quiet and polite, but still Malfoy.
“He just started last week,” Hermione grumbled, and Ron shot her a glare. Harry pretended not to hear that part.
He remembered with a start that it was Tuesday. Time for his lesson with a very unqualified teacher. He shook his head at his own stupidity; a petty servant, teaching him to swim? It’s not something he couldn’t have figured out on his own. Or he always could have asked his father to hire a more capable tutor.
“Bloody Gryffindors,” Draco says under his breath, still refusing to meet Harry’s eyes. “You're all complete and utter imbeciles.”
“Hey, all else aside, I’d say you’re doing pretty well. Now you know how to survive if you ever fall into another river without a lowly servant nearby to save you.”
“Uh,” Harry remarked, eyebrows knit together in confusion. “There’s nothing here.”
Harry felt a flicker of irritation at Draco’s words. “I told you, Malfoy, I don’t want your money.”
“I…” Draco choked out when Harry absently stroked his fingers across Draco’s exposed thigh. “Can't. I can't.”
He had seen Potter again.
“Would you mind?!” Draco hissed. “I’m trying to get some work done.”
Harry swore under his breath, caught off guard. Merlin, Malfoy was hot. And not in the way the blond viewed himself, what with his own pseudo ego and all. No, Malfoy was hot because he was so embarrassed, and so needy, all in one. Harry allowed his eyes to flutter closed for a moment.
“I know you well, my Prince,” Narcissa said, cupping Draco’s cheek. “But no matter. I won’t press the issue.” She stood up, black robes billowing around her. “Just remember, darling, that blood and love come hand in hand.”
Draco’s heart pounded in his ears as he fought to keep eye contact with the King. “Y-Yes, I have.”
Draco stood there for a moment and dipped a dainty toe into it just like he had before. Harry laughed at the action.
“Why have you come, Mother? It’s a pleasure, of course, but is there anything you need?”
“I don’t...I don’t understand,” Draco said, cautious; he couldn’t allow himself to be happy, not yet, not when this situation was so surreal.
Draco was able to spot the trio easily due to Weasley’s hideous orange mop. Granger had an arm wrapped around him-- her hair was tied tightly into a bun and she wore a pair of earrings. Hm. Draco sincerely hoped that those two would not be producing offspring anytime soon. Weasley himself looked ten years older rather than five as he was sporting some sort of goatee and wearing a horrendous checkered jacket. Potter was grinning from ear to ear, cheeks pink from the booze. His teeth were white, slightly crooked, and his crinkled eyes were practically sparkling. Merlin, was Potter aware that he was a walking wet dream? Then Potter downed a shot without even batting an eye and Draco raised an eyebrow, somewhat impressed. For a moment he wondered what it might be like to drink with Potter, to laugh with him like his friends were now. Not that Draco ever drank. Or laughed. He watched for another moment as Potter said something that made the others lose it. Granger was gripping her abdomen and was seemingly struggling to breathe. Draco rolled his eyes, trying to stave off the ache in his chest with mere irritation.
Draco slammed a long index finger against the red button.
“Till tomorrow,” Draco replied, watching Harry give one final wave before he jogged back up to the manor.
“No,” Potter replied, standing slowly. He immediately fell back down into the cot and began laughing like an idiot. “Er, yeah. I suppose I am a bit drunk, aren’t I?”
As he strolled through the corridors on the way to the castle’s quidditch pitch, Draco Malfoy, esteemed heir to the throne, descendant of one of the most prestigious pureblood lines, bumped into someone for the second time in one day.
The blood drained from Harry’s face at the thought. It was still autumn and the weather, although mild during the afternoon, often became painfully chilly in the evenings.
Draco nodded, hard, and took a determined step towards Harry. “Purebloods can smell strong magic from a mile away, obviously,” He sighed, as if Harry should be aware of this. “It can’t be helped, I suppose. I must admit that you are doing a proficient job in teaching me, and to lose a qualified teacher such as yourself would be...regrettable. Regardless of magical abilities.”
Draco was trying to look anywhere but at the man in front of him. Of course, he thought with a grimace. Of course he’d end up having to work with Potter, of all people. The universe truly had it out for him, it seemed. The last thing Draco needed was to spend time interacting with Potter, to further fuel this unsettling obsession. To be reminded of what he had done-- how he sat and watched while his fellow Death Eaters had tortured innocent souls. Why was Potter, the personification of all things Good, even giving him the time of day? Why was he speaking to Draco like they were simple coworkers, rather than enemies?  He turned his wand in his pocket, over and over, until Potter finally cleared his throat.
Malfoy said nothing.
“I’d just assumed you got laid,” Ron said, sucking in a breath of pain when Hermione elbowed him.
“Don’t look at me like that, you lech--”
“I-I,” Draca began, suddenly without confidence, words forced and awkward. “I would never flirt with the likes of you, Potter!” She stuck her nose up into the air, crossing her arms, and Harriet thought absently that she looked like an angry toddler.
The Royal Family
“Sorry, shouldn’t have offered,” Harry laughed awkwardly and scratched the back of his head.
And then Harry explained the entire story of how he and Draco had met, drowning and all.
Draco glared at Harry, but without malice; their friendly tormenting of one another hadn’t ceased in the ten years of their marriage.
“Something funny, boy?” Vernon turned towards Harry, face purpleing. “Shut it or I’ll lock you out.”
“Need...I need you to…” Draco trailed off; he seemed to be incapable of forming coherent sentences at the moment.
“Dad!” The tiny boy called, climbing down Draco’s slim body like a monkey.
“Er, no. I just...don’t have any. Anymore.”
“What in Merlin’s name is wrong with you?” Draco asked, completely oblivious to how pathetic he looked.
“Yeah, alright. You've been saying that for years. Now come on, before it gets dark! Honeydukes’ll close soon.”
All too soon, Harry reluctantly pulled away. Kissing Draco was turning him on much more than it should have been, and he decided to spare them both the awkwardness that would come with Draco noticing.
“What?” Harry asked, heart leaping. He hadn’t been able to wear anything other than filthy hand-me-downs since...well, forever.
“I--He doesn’t have time for trifling matters such as these.”
“Oh?” ‘Mione chimed in, his voice teasingly sly. “Harriet, even I can see that you two are...spending time together. Don't worry, Harriet. I know she doesn't mean anything she says."
Well, that's it. It's done. To be honest, I'm really really emotional about this! I worked so hard on this fic for so long, and I got so invested in it. I'm sad that it's over now. Please please leave a comment if you enjoyed this, it means so much to me.
Draco stared at Harry for a moment. “It’s...alright.”
Typically, Draco would make use of the countless secret passageways, hidden doors, and winding corridors of the Ministry in order to prevent this very thing from happening, but today he had been in quite the rush. Draco had overslept--nightmares again-- and arrived to work just one minute before he was set to begin for the day. Much to his chagrin, Draco had practically sprinted to his office. And of course, while running like a fool with his arse on fire, he had locked eyes with Potter of all people. And the bastard, rather than smirking or laughing, had smiled. Politely.
“What the- What the bloody hell?! Are you trying to kiss me Potter? This is sexual harassment, my father will be hearing about this!” Draco shrieked, his voice going up a couple octaves.
“Potter. Wait.”
“How dare I? Who do you think you are? The Prince?” Harry crossed his arms.
Over the past few weeks, Harry had visited the library multiple times. It was nice having friends; for most of his life, the only company he had were his action figures and the kitchen rats. Of course, he’d talked to many people in town, but never had he had actual bond such as these. Ron and Hermione were easy to talk to. They had shared many laughs throughout the week, and Harry was grateful for that. As such, he found himself at the library yet again after his afternoon chores were completed. The two were bickering amicably and Harry smiled; this scene was becoming oddly familiar to him after a week of witnessing it.
“Fuck!” Harry sat up and ran to the sink, splashed some cold water on his face, and rushed to get dressed. Merlin, he was exhausted. What he wouldn’t do for just a couple more hours of sleep.
Draco smiled widely like a proud child and continued clumsily making his way toward him. Once the two were just inches apart, Harry had trouble ignoring the fact that Draco was so close; every pale eyelash, every fleck of pale blue is his otherwise grey eyes, was visible.
There was a tense moment of silence and then the door flew open. Lucius’ eyes were cold and empty as usual.
Soon The King, as well as the four or so knights, stopped in front of a grand, polished door. It was then that Harry realized he hadn’t been held by force, rather he was allowed to walk on his own the entire journey there, unlike his fantastic trip to the dungeons where he’d been stunned. Perhaps it’s a freedom they grant to those on death row, he thought with a rueful laugh. Yeah, right.
“Ask nicely.”
Mrs. Weasley was suddenly very busy in the kitchen, pots and pans clanging obnoxiously.
The lavatory smelled like sex, and so did they.Harriet ran her fingers through Draca’s hair as she thought of a solution.  “Do you...do you want to skip Defense Against the Dark Arts, go to Hogsmeade maybe?” Harriet asked tentatively, fearing rejection for the first time that day.
“Er, no. Separate rooms, thanks.”
“Why did...why did you stop?”
Draco made a face at the flowery language and the obscene amount of glitter stuck to the parchment that was now covering his hands.
“He’s here because...we believe the wizard behind this is a former Death Eater. And given Mr. Malfoy’s...history, he can provide us with valuable input. As fellow aurors, you two will be partners in this case.” Kingsley looked at each of the men. “I expect this won’t be a problem?”
He was still for a moment and Harry rolled his eyes, hoping to Merlin that Draco knew how to kick upwards by now. In a moment his prayers were answered and Draco’s blonde head popped out of the water.
“Be patient,” Harry murmured, kissing Draco’s neck sloppily. “I don’t have anything to prep you with.”
“Thank you, Harry. I made the dress from my mother’s old one,” She smoothed out her skirt. “You look wonderful too, Harry! Like a Prince.”
“Not so smart when you're thinking about me getting you off, are you?”
Once the fog cleared from his thoughts, he pushed his silken sheets off of his body and shivered despite the fact that his room was at a comfortable temperature.
“Draco, as my heir you realize you have a duty to marry a powerful witch or wizard that will strengthen our bloodline.”
Dudley considered this for a moment, seemingly weighing his options. “Make it gold and I’ll go.”
Draco’s mouth dropped open at the sudden forcefulness in Harry’s words and he colored more than Harry had thought possible, pale cheeks dusted with crimson. He was silent for a moment, only to begin squirming.
Potter barked out another laugh and Draco felt like he’d been chosen as Head Boy all over again.
“Yes, he did.”
“Thanks?” Harry laughed, turning around and heading back home.
Hermione turned pink immediately, hissing out a “Shut up, Ron!”
“Pardon?”
Draco was still for a moment and then did as told, lifting up his head and standing up. His movements, normally poised and calculated, were far from graceful now.
“Harry,” He looked at Harry, and then at Malfoy. “Mr. Malfoy. Do you know why I called you into my office this morning?”
“See?” Harry asked, sloshing about. “I’m still alive.”
Draco was aware of how he must have looked; he was gaping at his father like a child who had just received a precious gift.
“Who is she, mate? What’s she like?” Ron asked, suddenly much more eager to immerse himself in the conversation.
Strangely enough, before Lucius died he and Harry had become almost friendly. Initially, Harry had had trouble looking past Lucius’ bigoted nature and controlling demeanor, but after many awkward conversations over tea Harry had realized that really, he was just a very powerful man with a very large inferiority complex. As such, Harry had put in minimal effort to get to know him, for Draco’s sake; and the two got along surprisingly well. The Late King had passed two months ago from a nasty plague; Harry still vividly remembered holding Draco as he cried, kissing the tears away and assuring him of his father’s love.
“So beautiful. You’re so beautiful.”
Malfoy got up first, and Harriet noted absently that her hair had had gotten much longer over the last few months. God, Harriet thought as Draca’s hips swayed as she walked, how can pull off Hogwarts robes so well? Malfoy peered over her shoulder, looking delectable and almost afraid; she was wearing Harriet’s favorite vanilla-flavored lip gloss.
“Yes. I do.”
“W--Look?! Why would I be--”
With a tactile movement of his fingers both of their clothes were gone, neatly folded across the room, and Harry grinned. He still hadn’t gotten used to the many perks that came with being someone who could utilize their magic.
“Your Grace, your Royal Highness, I apologise from the bottom of my heart. Had I known it was you, such a pleasure, I would not have--”
And Draco did. Harry knew that he was technically a tutor, and tutors were supposed to be patient, but holding back his laughter was proving to be a challenging task. Draco was barely keeping his head above water as he flailed about, breathing labored.
On September 19th, Prince Malfoy will be hosting a celebration of grandeur and festivities. We humbly beseech you, witches and wizards alike, to attend his masquerade ball on this date. In order to find a suitable heir for The Prince, dueling will commence between six and nine o’clock. The ball itself will begin at 5pm-3am.
“So soft,” Harry breathed, and Draco’s lean muscles fluttered under his touch.
“I dunno. Haven’t been able to use it since I was a kid.”
Harry barked out a laugh when the color drained from Draco's face. “I love your son more than words can express.”
“Harry,” She hissed, pulling brambles out of her wild hair. “You’re in trouble. Big trouble. We’ve come to save you. Now I’ll let you speak but you have to promise to be quiet!”
“That was him?!” Draco said, aghast. “Harry did that?”
Narcissa raised a sharp, expectant eyebrow as she waited from Draco to continue. He sighed again, more dramatically this time and waited, but his mother continued staring at him sternly as she waited for a reply.
Draco sighed against Harry’s lips; shivering slightly when Harry wrapped his arm around his waist and pulled him in closer. “I love you, too.”
“Erm-- No. No, Minister. It will not be a problem.”
Lucius smirked coldly. “Oh, Draco. Why must you always be so difficult? Can you think of a better way to find a proper spouse?”
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Yes, I suppose we do, don’t we?”
Narcissa put her nose in the air in a gesture of mock-offense. “Are you implying that I can’t visit my son and his wonderful husband when I please?”
“Need I remind you that I’m the one doing you a favor here?”
“Malfoy. Hey.”
Harry circled his finger around the tight hole and just barely pushed inside. Draco let out a breathy moan at the contact and pushed into Harry's hand, all too eager, and Harry’s cock throbbed.
Harry shrugged nonchalantly. “If you don't want to then that's alright. Just thought I'd like to teach you.”
“Yes?”
Ron seemed a bit dejected at that until Harry spoke up. “Thanks, Ron. I really, really appreciate it.”
Pan’s mouth dropped open and he glared at Draca pointedly. “Are you serious?! There’s no way that’d be allowed--”
Draco laughed, and Harry’s heart fluttered just as rapidly as when the two had shared their first kiss by the river. “You are a royal arsehole. But you do have me as your husband. So stop complaining.”
Draco nodded pathetically, beyond words. Pinned beneath him, Draco could do nothing other than take Harry’s cock, and judging by the way Draco was clinging to him like his life depended on it, he was more than fine with that. Harry bit his neck softly and then moved downwards, grazing his teeth over his collarbone as he thrust into Draco over and over again. Draco moaned loudly at the sensation, a stream of unintelligible profanity falling from his pink, swollen lips.
“Yes, Father.” Draco replied, wondering where his father could be going with this. He was already well aware of his duties.
“I don’t like other blokes! I don’t like to dance!”
“No, you idiot. Fish. Where there’s a river, there’s fish. Lived off of the pike fish in the creek by my house for years growing up.”
The Prince grabbed his hand before he could protest and pulled him away from the crowd. Countless murmurs shadowed their path until the Prince had taken them to some sort of empty hallway complete with ornamental marble and gold-framed portraits. The ceiling was high and Harry had never seen anything so obnoxiously gaudy.
“And what makes you think that this belonged to the victim?”
Harry led Draco back out through the oaken front door and down the tree-lined walkway leading back down to the road.
Potter had both hands on his desk now, looking directly at Draco, who was finally forced to meet his eyes. “How do you...how can you be so sure?”
Harry rolled his eyes but was not far behind, ducking his head as he entered. He stopped in his tracks, almost bumping into Draco, when he took in his surroundings. They were standing in what seemed to be a small house, complete with a humble bed, two plush armchairs, and plenty of space to move around. Harry gaped, and for the first time felt a pang of bitterness at the fact that he couldn’t use magic.
Draco looked around wildly, suddenly realizing that Harry was no longer supporting him. He gasped, grey eyes widening in fear, and immediately began to sink.
Draco felt a cold, intense pain against his cheek. His brain went blank for a moment, only to realize that he’d been slapped. Hard enough to leave a bruise, he thought almost absently. His father grabbed the nape of his shirt, pushing him up against the cherry wood walls. Icy, almost inhuman eyes bore into Draco's own as his father hissed a few venomous words at him.
Potter was laughing at him. “You don’t need to yell, Malfoy. He’ll be able to hear you.”
Harry nodded awkwardly, noting that Hermione’s hair seemed to be twice as large as the last time he had seen her.
“Yeah, actually.”
Scorpius practically vibrated out of Harry’s arms, wiggling around in excitement. “I want circle glasses like Dad!”
"I am no such thing! You're the one who started this, I wouldn't have--"
“I--” Draco trailed off. Even his ears were red. “Fuck off.”
Not beta'd, I apologize for any spelling/grammar mistakes. With college stuff we just don't have much time to edit.
The next lesson with Draco came unusually quickly. This time, he actually showed up in a bathing costume. He lacked a shirt and Harry was yet again given a full view of his pale, toned chest; his stomach was completely flat and his waist was impossibly thin. He was so clean, so pristine. Harry swallowed when he noticed the way those emerald green bathing shorts hugged Draco in all the right places, and it took almost all of his self control to tear his eyes away from the beautiful sight. Merlin, he’s gorgeous, he thought as he willed himself to actually speak.
“Found something.”
“Well I wouldn’t have if I’d’ve known you’d dump the goddamn laundry into the river and then have a near-death experience!” Harry said, quickly gathering up all the bags and shoving one of the lighter ones at Draco. “Make yourself useful and carry this back with me. It’s the least you can do.”
As they lay there in a post-orgasmic haze, comfortable and content, Draco whispered:
Draco shivered, cock twitching. Why the hell was he getting off on being called a slut? Then Harry began to jerk him off, slow, tantalizing, and Draco felt every ounce of sanity he had left leave his brain. Harry knew exactly what he was doing; he knew where to squeeze, where to tug, and Draco was embarrassingly close already.  But he wanted more, wanted Harry inside him, so he parted his legs as a silent plea. Harry groaned at the sight, hand fluttering around Draco’s dripping cock. “Fuck, you’re killing me. We can’t--I can’t do that, I don’t have anything--”
Harry raised his hands from Draco's gelled hair, where he had been absently twirling the blond strands, and crossed his arms. He rose an eyebrow. “Have you, now?”
“You...you too?” Draco asked in his post-orgasmic haze. Harry nodded sleepily against his neck, and Draco could have sworn that he’d never felt so content in his entire existence. With the welcome weight and warmth of Harry’s body, Draco felt himself dozing off despite their current location. He shook his head, trying to clear away the cobwebs, but Harry kissed him gently, almost pulling him back into his trance.
“Hey, Draco,” Harry says, voice almost carried away by a flurry of snow.
“Sorry to interrupt this...pleasant little chat of yours, Potter, but it’s late and I’m tired. I’d like to check in now,” Draco demanded, arms crossed. He wasn’t going to sit here and be Potter’s shadow for a moment longer.
“Oh shit,” Harry yelled, “Oh shit oh shit oh shit.” He yanked off his shirt, and dove into the river. He quickly retrieved most of the clothes. Although a few garments got away, he doubted Dudley would even notice what with his copious amount of ornamental rags. Harry sat down on the riverside, closing his eyes and basking in the sun in an attempt to warm his shivering muscles.
He took in his surroundings. Oh, he thinks. The fireplace is lit.
“So,” Harry said with a knowing smirk. “Have you ever snogged anyone?”
“You two,” Narcissa shook her head. “You speak to each other with such malice. If I didn’t know better, I’d assume that this was a loveless marriage.”
“I’m washing it? That’s what you do with laundry? I know you’re a noble and all but do you not know what laundry is-”
Draco's eyes welled up, much to his chagrin. They wouldn't take Harry from him. Couldn't. He opened his mouth to argue, to protest, but then Harry’s warm, calloused hand was cupping his cheek.
Draco glared at him. His cock was throbbing and all he could think about was what Harry’s calloused fingers would feel like inside of him, so he caved. “P-Please, Harry, I need you in--” Draco could barely choke the words out. “Inside me. Please.”
A knight stepped in front of Harry, nodding at him (that’s weird, Harry thought. They’ve never acknowledged my presence before) and pushed the door open with controlled force. His biceps flexed beneath his shining armor plates, and Harry swallowed; perhaps he was going to be killed in a more painful way that he had originally thought. He blinked a few times as he was gently pushed into an extravagant room. The walls, painted a muted shade of salmon, donned floral paintings and golden candle holders. A large, plush bed sat dead in the middle, pink sheets reflecting on the tile floor. Real flowers, probably freshly clipped, made the room sickeningly colorful. Harry blinked, stunned and confused. Why the hell would they be sending him here, to such a nice place?
God, Harry thought as he pushed off of the river wall and made his way over to Draco. Why does he have to be so damn endearing?
For a moment, as his footsteps echoed off of the marble floors, Harry wasn’t sure if Malfoy was indeed following him. And then, so quietly that Harry could hardly hear him:
“You already know how to stay afloat, you hoity-toity arse. What do you even need my help for?” Harry asked caustically.
Hope this chapter was satisfying! As a very gay female writing M/M smut is quite challenging for me but I think I did pretty ok. I hope. HAhahahaah anyways, thank you for reading this (I know I've said that a million times, but seriously. I'm grateful.) Thank you for all the kind and encouraging comments, they truly mean the world.
Although his mood had been dampened by Dudley’s recurring insults and foul attitude, Harry still felt mildly excited for his hour-long escape to the marketplace. After notifying a half-asleep and most likely drunk Uncle Vernon and receiving a grunt as a response, Harry set off on his way.
“I suggest you watch it, Pans, because you just bumped into the Prince,” He grinned, taking Pansy’s proffered velvet-gloved hand. Pansy giggled.
“Maybe you’ll meet a nice bloke who’ll put up with your crap,” Ron mumbled under his breath. Hermione sniffed.
Draca froze at that, removing her hand as if she’d been burned. Her grey eyes were wide as her face heated up. Ronda barked out a laugh at this reaction, and ‘Mione shushed her hurriedly.
The King stood a safe distance from him, unfeeling eyes locked on his. He took a moment to answer Harry’s inquiry, although his gaze did not waver. When he spoke, his thin lips just barely moved. “You are to wait here until further instructions.”
Harry seemed startled by Draco’s appearance only for a moment. He whirled around and waved awkwardly, meeting Draco’s eyes. “Oh, hello, Draco. You actually showed up.”
“Merlin, what’s gotten into you?” Draco says halfheartedly, breathing on Harry’s unruly tresses causing them to flutter about. Draco does not pull away; his flush deepens as he pulls Harry’s body closer.
“I bet it’s great,” Harry said as he gestured for Ron to sit on the dusty couch.
“Well you’re bloody useless,” Harry said as he pulled Draco’s slacks away from his taut body. Draco seemed not to have heard him; he said nothing, mouth dropping open slightly as Harry removed his own underwear.
Harry lowered Draco to his feet and kissed him once again, this time with more heat. “Is that any way to talk to your fiance?” Harry whispered, breath causing Draco’s feathery hair to flutter about. Draco shuddered, relaxing into Harry’s touch, saying nothing. Harry smirked against his hair, breathing in the perfumey scent of his soap. So easy to wind him up, Harry thought.
“I like your hair like that,” Harry said, and Draco turned crimson at the compliment but Harry continued, “I don’t suppose you could transfigure me some new clothes? A toothbrush, maybe?”
Harry smirked, eyes darkening. “You’re right. I do know. But I want you to ask me for it.”
“He's not dead, Your Highness. Your father requested for him to be brought back alive, so that he himself may witness the execution.”
“No!” Draco yelled rather loudly. Harry raised an eyebrow and looked at him strangely. Draco cleared his throat. “I mean, er, no. I think I can handle walking home by myself, thanks.”
“...Yeah?”
“You ponce. I can most definitely swim.” Draco said.
She was pleasantly surprised when Draca nodded, wrapping her thin arms around her neck and kissing her cheek in an awkward, stiff motion.  “Alright. Treat me well, and perhaps there will be more.”
Draco frowned, thinking about the vile way the boy’s Uncle had treated Potter. Barbaric.
“He joined us in the end-- you do remember that, don’t you?” Hermione replied. She gently elbowed Ron. “He’s not all bad.”
“Harry!” Ron hissed, quiet so as to not wake Hermione. “I think the Prince is here!”
HERE IT IS!!! THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF SMUT. i was so happy to finally RESOLVE THE SEXUAL TENSION! sort of.
“You do? And why is that?” Pansy asked curiously.
Ron scowled but continued working, thumbing through books and reading them at a snail’s pace. Harry began doing the same. The first book he came across was about to fall apart, all torn pages and floppy bindings. The cover page, however, was still completely intact.  Harry had a hard time reading it because the font was ridiculously tiny; his vision had always been terrible.
“Father,” Draco protested, “I cannot just marry anyone just because you deem them powerful! You’ve given me a year to meet someone and marry, you practically want me to marry a stranger.”
“Uh, yeah. Guess I’m just...a warm person?”
“Father!” Draco called, pushing himself past the stunned knight and sprinting over to The King. “Why have you imprisoned me like this?! I’m the Prince, I’m--”
He knocked once, twice, and then: “Who knocks?”
“Hey, ‘Mione, don’t scold Harriet for getting laid. Not everyone has a stick up their arse like you do, you know!”
Ron spit out his butterbeer and Hermione’s dark eyes widened.
Harry turned around and practically bolted up the stairs.
There may or may not be some hermione/pansy in the next chapter, hehe ;)
Thoughts of Draco stayed buried deep within the confines of Harry’s mind. He couldn’t worry, wouldn’t worry, about Draco’s fate. About his own. Over the course of the week, however, anxiety began to creep up his spine often in the dead of night, when the walls creaked and silence permeated the stuffy air.
“Alright then. I suppose commoners should be invited as well.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Same thing I was doing before you left to go chat with those obnoxious friends of yours. Looking through the case files. Are you drunk, Potter?”
Ron shrugged.
“Want coffee?”
“You didn’t seem to be wondering anything except how to unbutton Pansy’s dress.”
“Yes, Uncle?” Harry asked, staring into the darkened room. He could see the faint outlines of the lush tapestries hanging on the walls and the lump that was Uncle Vernon’s body lying among the many satin blankets atop the large, mahogany, four-poster bed.
“You’re not ill? Hmm. Well, then, I suppose you must be upset about something. Is it your father?”
“You did, didn’t you? Always so pretty for me, Draca,” Harriet said, voice dripping with sweetness and lust. She slipped a finger inside the panties, marvelling at the hot wetness that immediately met her skin.
Harriet didn’t bother to reply, already turning back towards her two friends. Ronda was looking at her, puzzled. “I had no idea you two were…” She gestured wildly with her hands.
“I did.” Draco replied. “But what does that have to do with Harry? Was the damage severe?”
“Of course you’re good enough for me, and I’ll keep telling you until…” Harry trails away as he realizes how Draco is nibbling on his bottom lip just so. He recognizes that look. “Hold on. Show you how, exactly?”
“No way in Hell am I asking him to dance. I don’t have any robes to wear, anyway, just huge ones of Dudley’s that make me look like a toothpick--”
“Yeah! Isn’t that incredible? I’ve never seen a Muggleborn with a job other than servitude. Uhm, no offense, of course.”
Lucius said nothing, stiff smile melting into something still and stony. “Pardon?”
“What? Why not? Have you committed a crime?” Draco asked thoughtfully. “I wouldn’t put it past someone of your socioeconomic status.”
Hope you guys enjoy chapter three. The sexual tension is getting pretty intense xD Thank you so much for reading!
“I’m...fuck,” Draco whimpered pathetically. A sharp wave of arousal shot through Harry’s body at Draco’s admission; he didn’t even need to touch his cock, just being inside him was enough. That very thought pushed over the edge, Harry thrust into Draco one more time, and then he was coming; entire body tensing with pure pleasure. Draco was not far behind, screaming Harry’s name.
Hermione giggled softly, seeming very pleased by what Harry had just said. “He means, Ronald, that he’s in love with someone.”
“It’s...not a she. And I don’t care about him that much, or I shouldn’t anyway. He’s a ponce.”
Harry grinned.
“Can I ask you a question?” Harry asked before he could stop himself. Draco looked up from his laundry and met Harry’s eyes, raising an eyebrow.
“Oh fuck!” Harry exclaimed, untangling himself immediately. “You’re actually...oh Merlin!”
Draco blinked. He still felt warm all over. “If you’ll kindly get your shite together, maybe we can head out before next Tuesday.”
“Ah, yes,” Harry said patronizingly. “Necessities.”
Harry’s chest ached with genuine empathy-- he knew the feeling, after all. He sat there, watching Malfoy with a frown. For a moment, he considered getting up and waking him but then thought better of it-- it wasn’t any of his business. Was it?
Draco Malfoy.
“Ron! You came!” Harry said, ignoring the temptation to pull his friend into a tight hug. Ron scratched the back of his head, smiling sheepishly, and declared: ‘“‘Course I did. A knight always keeps his promises!”
“Yes,” Draco mumbled, shifting his weight from foot to foot. “Yes, you should. Make it snappy, Potter, or I’ll leave without you.”
Draco’s face colored. Harry never got sick of this, never got tired of making Draco blush and squirm under his gaze. “N-No!”
“Shut it, ‘Mione. C’mon, Harry.”
“I’d just assumed we hadn’t found the other one yet,” Harry replied curiously.
Harry sped up the pace and Draco shook with pleasure, practically screaming Harry’s name. Suddenly he was coming with a cry, shooting all over Harry’s abdomen. Pure bliss thrummed through his veins for what could have been an eternity; he’d never came so intensely before. Harry was not far behind, as Draco’s name stumbled from his lips and he shuddered, spilling into Draco with a low moan. Draco trembled with the aftershocks, mind buzzing with electricity.
Harry chuckled and Draco was too turned on to even care, in fact the vibrations of Harry’s laughter went straight to his dick. He let out an embarrassing squeak when Harry found the buttons on his outerwear.
“Fine,” Draco croaked out. “I’m fine. It’s the Carrows. They’re behind this.”
Harry sighed, removing himself from Draco slowly. Draco, embarrassingly, felt his throat constrict at the loss.
“Fire, Draco. Fire.”
Harry froze in place. “D-Draco?”
“Would you shut up and walk? I’ve asked you to take me home and fuck me. Don’t make me change my mind.”
“I suppose.”
“Those bastards? They’re still alive?”
There were piles of paperwork to review, countless witnesses to contact, and yet all Draco could manage to do was sit, stare, and distract himself from the perversions of his own mind.
“A new case?” Harry asked. Malfoy continued in his silence.
Draco was tempted to ask what Potter meant by that exactly, but the exhaustion creeping in seemed to have numbed his brain. He held back a yawn and let his eyes flutter closed for a moment.
“Harry. Thank you for showing up in such a timely manner. Please, come in.”
Ron snorted, looking around the manor which, although large, had decayed with time. “You should see where I grew up. Mom and dad call it the Burrow, which I’d say is a fitting name.”
“He’s not?” Hermione asked with a sly grin. “Seems to me that he fancies you as well, Harry. Why else would a filthy rich noble ask you for swim lessons?”
“You’re late, you useless lump of a boy,” Bellowed Uncle Vernon as he stomped down the wooden staircase.
Draco scoffed, crossing his arms. “Our son is here, you idiot. Don’t say things like that in front of him.”
“Er, yes?” Harry asked, trying and failing to keep the fear out of his voice.
Draco shrugged. “Perhaps.”
“No one else,” Harry murmured into the crook of Draco’s neck,breathing him in. “I wouldn’t want to spend my life with anyone else. I’m in love with you, you ponce.”
“Potter,” Draco said weakly, trying and failing to push Harry off. “I must return to my castle, Father is probably terrified.”
“None of my--But Draco, I’m your best friend! You’re supposed to tell me everything.”
“Get back here, you idiot.”
Oh God, Harry thought, throat tightening in sudden fear. He couldn’t lie, could he?  “I can’t use magic,” He said before he did something even stupider than telling the truth. Draco was silent for a moment, eyes boring a hole through Harry’s forehead.
“Really, I thought you said that you could already?” Harry said, giving Draco a shit-eating grin.
“Y’know we’re off the clock at eight, right? You’re not getting paid for this,” Potter stood again, successfully this time, and took a few wobbly steps towards Draco. He placed a heavy hand on the desk for balance and then leaned down a bit. Draco caught a whiff of his shampoo and swallowed thickly. Why was Potter so damn close? They were practically cheek-to-cheek now and Potter didn’t seem to notice or care.
We have a new case. A case more brutal than we’ve seen since before The War. Please meet me in my office as soon as you finish reading this letter. Apologies for the excess copies-- I wanted to make sure this reached you as soon as possible.
“I know damn well about his magic,” Draco spat, voice pure venom. “Never show your smarmy face anywhere near my Castle again, or I swear I'll have you executed.”
Draco could only look Harry in the eye for a short moment before embarrassment made him look away. After all these years, Draco would still feel embarrassed over how eager he always was.
“That doesn’t answer my question.”
“Fuck,” Harry cursed. “Feel so good, Draco.”
“Hardly, but it’s home. We aren’t going up to your room?”
“Shut your good for nothing mouth, Potter, or my father will hear about this,” Draco said sternly. He continued before Harry could retort. “However, you were indeed successful in teaching me the rudimentary skills I’ll need to become a swimmer, so I believe some payment is in order.”
“Malfoy. It’s alright, you’re dreaming. Wake up,” Harry had never been good at this whole comfort thing. He squeezed Malfoy’s shoulder and the man stilled for a moment. Harry thought his job was done, until Malfoy gasped and sat up in bed.
“Don't be embarrassed,” Harry whispered between pecks. “You're gorgeous.”
“Are you going to swim or just float around? Show me what you’ve got.”
-Disemboweled
“What are you going on about?” Draco snapped, making one final attempt to grab the paper back.
“Please stop corrupting our child. I don’t want him turning out as spoiled as you are.”
On the seventh morning of his stay, Harry was awoken from his deep slumber by a frantic Ron, who was shaking his shoulder.
“F-Fuck, Potter, fuck! ”Draca moaned obscenely, legs squeezing tightly around Harriet’s wrist.
“Shut it,” Harry retorts. “You love it.”
Ron shrugged at Hermione as Harry turned around and walked out, trying to calm his rapidlybeating heart.
“Er,” Harry said, filling with immediate dread. “Don’t think I’ll be allowed to leave the house on the night of the ball. Hadn’t gotten far enough to plan that out yet, to be honest.”
“Okay, okay,” Harry muttered, leaning in to capture the Prince’s lips once again. “I’ve got the message, uh, Your Highness. I’ll kiss you.”
Draco held up a decadent hand, silver nails glinting in the moonlight.”I came to find you, Potter. And call me Draco,” his voice wavered slightly. “Please.” Draco cringed inwardly at how pathetic he sounded, how desperate.
of you to say, Harry, but it won't change anything; she simply doesn't need my help, the smart Witch.' Draco let a smile grace his lips and Harry seemed to copy it by reflex.
Offended, Draco pulled Harry's red jumper over his head and gave Ron a vile look. 'Not feeling like casting one today. But alright, if you insist.' With a flick of his hand, he didn't dry his own hair and clothes but Hermione's instead. A smile out of surprise graced Hermione's face as she thanked Draco. Harry knew what Draco was playing at and it humored him greatly; he knew how Ron hated it when other guys were being friendly to Hermione. And it was visible on Ron's face.
Draco noticed he still had his hand upon Harry's shoulder and slowly lowered it, only to get taken into Harry's. ‘Want to dance?’ the boy asked as he stared at Draco's pale hand and too long fingers.
And off they went, running the other way again to the Forbidden forest with a plan in their heads on how to get there but still making one on how to actually get in. As they ran from the castle to the trees, Harry couldn't help but ask where his three friends had suddenly come from. Ginny explained that Hermione had called for them using the enchanted Galleons; that they were the only three brave enough to answer the call for help. Harry glanced over his shoulder at Hermione, cheeks a crimson color making her face glow. 'Knew you wouldn't stay here — that you had to go save him. Might as well take some extra wands with us, right?' Harry blessed his friend right there and then; for just how clever she was and always seemed to know what he was going to do next.
on the blond in front of him. Draco on the other hand took his chance to take in the other boy's body; his broad shoulders, tanned skin, slightly muscular arms from flying probably and a few faint scars here and there. Harry couldn't be more the opposite of Draco whom was as pale as pale could be and basically bones covered with flesh. Well, he wasn't
Draco waved his words away and took ahold of his broom more steadily. 'Not to worry, Harry — they'll follow along.' And he took off, shooting up towards the sky as if he was a professional Quidditch player. Harry grinned as he took off as well, quickly caught up with Draco and looked down upon the roofs of Little Whinging's houses. Black squares, all the same. Tiny specks of light, almost like Christmas decorations. The wind blew in his face, a cold wind that he had missed ever since the start of summer.
Draco couldn’t let it go, though. ‘But what?’
Stepping forward and entering the room, Harry drew his wand and pointed it at the boy's back. Furious, he was; a burning fire in human form. And before he knew it, he had casted the spell — a spell that was only to be used against his enemy.
'Help him? I'm sorry but that's even more strange.' Hermione shook her head and tucked a strand of curly hair behind her ear.
A sound, the grasses moving — there was someone behind him. Turning around with his wand pointed at whomever was nearing; Draco was ready to attack and cast spells to defend both him as Harry — as all the others whom were there. But it wasn't necessary, as it was Harry himself who stumbled out of the grass into Draco's arms. 'She's gone,' he said to him, almost in whispers.
Even though it might sound strange, it was something that had happened quite a few times before in Harry's life; strange things that he'd never been able to explain. He'd already seen things move many times prior to that encounter in the bathroom, had seen people suddenly act strange, had escaped a handful of accidents… and no matter how many times they happened, Harry'd always kept telling himself that it was nothing, that he'd imagined it. Yet sometimes, at night when he laid alone in bed surrounded by the dark, he often wondered if there was something — or
A big black blob. A piece of dark fabric. Draco had no idea where it had come from, but it had appeared in front of his eyes as if it had always been there. And inside, something shining silver and red. Emeralds. It was the sword of Gryffindor that had appeared; ready to be taken and to be slain. What was the sword doing here, amidst the remains of a battlefield when it should be in Hermione's purse, Draco wondered. But he didn't wonder for too long, saw it as an opportunity and a leap of faith.
‘Now, now; you’re looking starved, Harry. And you as well mister Malfoy.’ She glanced between the two boys, a glance that came accompanied with a head-shake.
That same night, already way past midnight, Draco was stirred awake by Harry — a big smile still gracing his face as he held up a little vial in his hand, a white light glowing from it. 'I got it!' he nearly shouted. Draco, Hermione and Ron had been waiting for hours on end in the common room — worried wether something would happen to Harry or not. When he still hadn't returned around eleven, they had all gone to bed with a little heart. It had been hard for Draco to fall asleep, and it felt like he had just closed his eyes when he had to open them again for Harry.
A sixth bed had been squeezed inside the small room and Draco blessed the universe it was next to Harry's; at least he could be close to his beloved one at all times when he needed comforting. Dropping his suitcase in front of the bed, Harry wrapped his arms around him again and pulled him closer than probably ever before. Gasping for breath by the tight squeeze, Draco patted him on the back in order for release. 'Sorry,' Harry mumbled. 'I've just been so worried about you.'
Making his way to the Quidditch pitch and walking over the grassy grounds, Draco was lost in his thoughts and completely unsure of how to feel. Should he feel glad? Should he smile and carry on as if he wasn't going to murder Hogwarts their headmaster? Did it really make him feel any better that the man was going to die anyway? Murder was murder, wasn't it? Nearing the field and hearing a numerous amount of shouting coming from the sky; Draco noticed spots of red flying over his head and throwing a quaffle around. There was only one red spot left on the field; Harry shouting things up to that same sky and pointing in various directions. The new Gryffindor captain then noticed Draco and waved at him with a bright smile; one Draco found too bright not to return. 'And?' Harry asked. 'What did Dumbledore have to say?'
‘You have
Harry sighs.
'And what does it do?'
Every second of their last two days together they had spent in each other's company. They had left Dumbledore's office smiling, fingers tangled in each other as they had walked back to the Great Hall to face all of their friends who had fought a battle for them they couldn't fight themselves. It had been funny to see their faces as they had entered the Hall again, acting as if nothing had happened in the first place. Professor McGonagall had demanded everyone to sit down again and eat; something non of them had done before or after their yelling battle. Draco and Harry had taken a seat by the girls, who had still given Harry vile glares at first but resolved everything after Draco's explanation to them in French. Harry's friends seemed to take longer to be convinced that everything was fine again, that it was a good idea for Harry to date the son of a Death Eater. Especially Ron, who already held many grudges against Draco, had been hard to convince but had stopped sulking in the end anyway.
'What's wrong?' Harry immediately asked, taking Draco's hand in his and moving a bit closer to him. 'Why are you crying?'
she called out. The Hogwarts students around Draco started to applaud loudly and as Draco's smile grew, the applause suddenly came to a hold. Madame Maxime had transfigured into a tall man with a black hood pulled over his face. Draco could hear sounds a snake would make resound from underneath, almost as if it spoke in Parseltongue. The man's pale hand stretched out in Draco's direction, ready to grab him by his robes when the boy woke up.
Harry gave Draco a little side glance with his eyes, then gestured for them to sit down. 'So... you're normal again?' Ron asked, his eyes slightly squinted as if afraid Draco would hex him as soon as he faced him fully.
As the gates finally opened, he slowly walked towards the front door — its dark wood decorated with roses and peacocks — before having it opened by one of the house-elves. 'Master Draco has returned home,' the house-elf announced with a smile upon his face.
'Where are you taking us to, sir?' Luna then asked, taking a step closer to Dobby and bending a bit through her knees.
With the opened bag held out to her, Fleur hesitantly put her hand inside; removing a small green dragon only seconds later with number three around its neck. The dragon let out an innocent yawn as it seated itself on her leather gloved hand. 'The Common Welch Green,' Crouch said to her, eyes opened wide.
Draco would've cheered at his discovery if he hadn't felt so weak. Now, he laid emotionless and near-lifeless on the cold pebbles, his eyes searching for his wand of which he didn't know the position anymore. It was nowhere to be seen, and he was too weak to perform another spell without one.
"Like the constellation, my
Harry nods, taking a sip of his tea. It was camomile today, relaxing Harry all the way to his soul. But maybe it wasn't the tea that relaxed him; perhaps he had become more comfortable in the presence of Malfoy. He doesn't feel the rivalry anymore that he used to feel or felt when he visited him a month ago. The pity he felt for the blond also has disappeared and is replaced with understanding. And of course there are also other feelings that are slowly showing up at the surface of their relationship; but what they are, Harry's not sure about. Friendship, perhaps, but he feels different to be around Malfoy than he does when he's around Ron or Hermione.
Harry's heart makes a sudden jump, a stabbing feeling inside his chest. Where did that come from? He doesn't have time to think about it. The only thing he
'Then where were you guys all day?' Hermione had her arms crossed and still tried desperately to make eye-contact with Harry.
After another ssh from the librarian, they continued their research with a new set of eyes. But it wasn't long until that same new set drifted off in a deep sleep upon a book about Merpeople.
The rest of the day turned out clumsy as well. Draco'd accidentally pushed someone's pencil case off their table as he'd roamed through one of Harry's classrooms, followed by him bumping into someone's locker and sending the loudest bang metal could make through the hallways. The students, however, hadn't seen anything weird about it and had just glanced around to see who'd been idiotic enough to bump into one of the lockers. Draco'd always been clumsy; even before he'd become an angel. His brothers told him he was the most elegant looking of them all, but when it came to elegance in
side!'
A half-written letter to James greeted him from the floor; crumbled and torn apart by his father or mother. He had no idea whom was worse now; the father he had always known had some kind of evil in him or his mother who didn't seem to understand how wrong the man was she was so in love with. And Draco was the center of those two people; loved them both but had no idea on how to deal with their visions — with their support of a monster.
, as they called it.
Dumbledore. We were just wondering how things went after we left,' Draco explained, seeing Harry nod to his words beside him.
There was an angel in the Dursleys their house. Upstairs. On the attic. In Harry's room. His name was Draconis— no,
'I wanted to; I'm a guest and therefore should bring my hosts and friends some gifts. Here you go,
'Don't worry, you're not alone in this, alright? Believe it or not but I care about you,' he then whispers to him.
The girl had said something similar to Harry but in the most terrible English Draco had ever heard; making it sound even worse. As he saw the hint of red leave his eyesight, he couldn't help but take a quick glance anyway. He found Harry walking away from their little group, looking at Draco over his shoulder. His grey eyes caught his green ones and Draco tried to project his emotions through them; tried to tell Harry that it wasn't
They sit down on the uncomfortable chairs again and Draco makes a new tea tray appear with a flick of his wand. No rose this time and Draco's china tea cup has been replaced by the one Potter so kindly made for him. It makes his cheeks turn pink a little; maybe he should've just tucked it away somewhere, acting like he never got it.
the Champions posses, shall we?'
,' Draco answered, swallowing, and even though he knew Harry's French was terrible, he knew the boy could at least understand those words.
Slowly feeling better again, he opened his eyes and took a deep breath. Voldemort had seated himself down again and had his red eyes still fixed on Draco — just like all the other Death Eaters. It seemed as if they were awaiting something, but by the look in their eyes their hunger hadn't been fed. 'May I ask, my Lord, how you have come in the possession of Salazar's locket?' A man asked, of whom Draco didn't know the name. 'I thought it had been stolen from you?'
Snape didn't even glance at Harry but answered him between the healing spells. 'Perhaps. You shouldn't have interfered.'
Draco just stood frozen, that was for the third time that night as well. His arms kept straight by his sides and his chin held up high, only to not touch Harry's messy hair or tanned body. Even his eyes he kept closed with great force, hoping for the moment to be over soon and never happen again. Harry seemed to notice how uncomfortable Draco was and pulled back. He slid a hand through his hair and tightened his grasp around his invisibility cloak. 'Sorry about that... don't know where that suddenly came from,' he muttered.
'Can't you see I'm dying?' Draco throws his hands in the air, raising his voice just the tiniest bit. A few tears escape his eyes but he ignores them, keeps staring at Harry with great determination. But the arse doesn't even dare the look at him anymore. Doesn't even dare to look at the resemblance of near Death.
Harry thinks,
will start using it against you one day.'
Lifting his shoulders, Draco gets up to his feet and retrieves the book from his desk. As he hands it over to Potter, their hands touch slightly; the warmth of Potter's fingers radiating through Draco's leather glove. It makes his heart skip a beat; he felt that! He felt the
Suddenly remembering that conversation, Harry knew why Draco had looked away. 'They don't approve of it?'
As he dreamt away at Draco's sight, he totally forgot about the impatient stares of his best friends that were still cast upon him. After a minute of complete silence, Hermione cleared her throat and snapped Harry out of his daydream. '
Harry shrugged. 'I'm not sure yet, really. Maybe an auror, maybe a professional Quidditch player — I don't know. Being a professor here at Hogwarts sounds appealing too after hearing you talk.'
The Marauders Map; how grateful Harry had been to still have that piece of parchment in his possession. He hadn't dared to glance at it before; afraid he would lose Draco's trust must he check on where his lover was heading off to at night. But as the blond had sneaked out of bed again a few days after Halloween; Harry hadn't been able to control himself anymore. As he had glanced at the piece of parchment, he had quickly found Draco walking up stairs and having his feet lead himself to the seventh floor. There the French seemed to pace through the hallway for a while; stop sometimes to glance at something — perhaps — and then to start pacing again. First, Harry had thought Draco just liked to roam that particular hallway at night; as a kind of favorite place to clear his head, but as another student had made his presence — he hadn't been so sure about his first speculation anymore.
'Yes, but —'

Hermione and I have done enough research about it to know it'll work. But for how long; neither of us can say.'

'Yes, of course,' the boy answered.
'Isn't everything,' Draco replies.
Madame Maxime rose from her sofa, towering above Draco like no-one else could. '
Harry gave Draco a smile that colored his cheeks slightly as the doors to the Great Hall opened up.
Draco shouted at the locket, but it continued nonetheless.

With a hard push, the double doors swing open for him, and he's ready to make a big entrance, showing the Aurors that he's still
Harry was now the one to sigh. 'And at Hogwarts? Come to Hogwarts with me and we can try to hide you there—‘
There was also one time that Draco had been talking to a few girls outside in the Clocktower Courtyard when a hint of red had entered his eye's view. He hadn't dared to look up but as the girls fell silent in their conversation, he couldn't ignore the boy any longer. Still, he had kept his eyes staring in the distance; not looking at anything at all.
Four steps forwards, three to each side. Arms stretched out — perhaps two times. Hands in the air, jump up high. Yes, Harry could just reach the ceiling with his finger tips. At least this room was better than the Cupboard under the stairs.
Draco frowned. '
he starts, shaking his head, ‘don’t pity me. I’ve seen the pity in your eyes back at my trial, and I see that same emotion in your eyes right now, too.” Harry doesn’t even have time to deny it, as Malfoy suddenly starts unbuttoning his robes.

Draco's eyes widened up to the size of lightbulbs as he stammered a few French words, excuses if Harry was correct. 'Oh, look at the time!' the blond then called out. 'You better hurry, Harry, before you miss your train.' He pressed another kiss against Harry's lips, making him forget what they were talking about for just a second before pushing him in the direction of the wall. 'I'll see you again soon,
Silver colored eyes stared into Harry's and he could
Malfoy nods again, eyes looking away from the tea cup and hands drawing back from Harry's. It immediately leaves an empty feelings inside Harry's chest; the warmth that Malfoy's palms spread suddenly missing. 'I think you should leave. It's already late, anyway,' Malfoy then says.
Staring out in front of him, mountains different than the ones he was so used to seeing doomed up in front of him. A castle, one he knew but not as well as another. A task, a reason to be here instead of where he was supposed to be. '
'Is that a promise?'
'So? Doesn't mean he can't be friends with Harry or help him?' Hermione replied. It was as if she was talking to her book, her face not even glancing at Ron as she said those words.

'You're not an idiot.' Harry's voice was just as hoarse as Draco's and together they sounded like an old couple. And old, tired couple that had just survived a fall from Merlin knows how high. A strand of hair got pushed out of his eyes as a weak smile on Harry's lips became more visible. 'You should just stop looking at me all the time; it makes you miss certain things easily.' Draco grinned as he knew the boy's words were true; he had experienced it many times before that he had missed out on a lot of small details he would normally always notice. Whenever Harry was around, it seemed as if his mind only wanted to be occupied with the boy and with no-one or nothing else beside him.
'My help? But I already told you everything I know about dragons,' Draco could only say, but Harry shook his head.
It took a few seconds, but a vague smile appeared on Draco's face as well. 'Me too,' he replied, even though it sounded very off.
'We're insane for doing this!' Hermione now declared, also reaching the top of the hill and taking deep breaths. She was wearing dark, intricate robes — the kind Draco's mother usually wore. Her face was set dim, a look of disgust readable in her eyes as she held on to a flask of Polyjuice Potion. 'Breaking into Gringrotts! We've officially lost our minds…' Harry and Ron ignored her, Draco on the other hand agreed, but knew there was no other way.
They had danced terribly the rest of the night as Draco hadn't even bothered to try anymore. His toes had been abused for hours as Harry had stepped upon them too many times. But he had loved every second of them twirling lopsided circles over the dance-floor, staring into each other's eyes. Not many words had been exchanged that night; not about their feelings, about Ron's words, about
Of course Harry hadn't been able to keep himself quiet after that comment. How could Kingsley forget about Malfoy that easily? He didn't do anything wrong, expect for maybe making a few bad decisions. And even if he
' Draco threw his hands in the air, rolled his eyes and turned around, only to turn back and look straight into Harry's eyes again. 'Why didn't you tell me that from the start?'
One step inside the carriage and he was immediately reminded of a train; a passageway with many doors to small compartments on each side. One of the girls of which he knew was in his year — named Marie — appeared behind him and guided him to one of the doors numbered eleven. The compartment was around the size of a train's compartment as well; holding just enough space for a small bed, sink with a mirror above and the tiniest desk he had ever seen. Seated on the bed, Marie pointed out the door that held a small bathroom; only to use if highly necessary. With a firm nod she disappeared, leaving Draco behind in his small, new room.
Harry clenched his jaw and looked away for just a second, tried to concentrate his mind but Snape's wand got pointed at his head again, the dark wood only a few inches away from his eyes. Pale blue, a row of shining white teeth followed by locks of silver, long hair and the smell of lemons; Harry's mind got filled with the same memories again, but this time Snape didn't draw back after the Yule Ball memory, kept his eyes wandering in Harry's mind. 'Try harder,' he heard the professor repeat as he saw Draco take off his Weasley jumper, the beautiful scar shaped as that of a butterfly gracing his chest.

, he shouted but nothing but sobs left his mouth. He pushed the blond away from him, suddenly more angry than sad because of what he had discovered. Draco's father was a Death Eater and Draco hadn't told him; he had kept the awful secret to himself all along. The blond had known what Voldemort and his Death Eaters had done, Harry had told him about his fears so many times; but Draco hadn't told him any of it. He pushed Draco away from him once again and the blond stumbled away, almost falling into the arms of his best friends. But Harry couldn't read their expressions; he couldn't see a single thing through his teary eyes.
‘I indeed did, Harry. How observant of you,’ Draco replied as he returned the grin.
But what else could Draco do to the cabinet? He had casted a million spells on it already; every kind of magic that could make an object magically do something. A spell to make the bloody thing dance, he had even casted upon it — yet nothing had happened. 'Will you be needing a new bird for it?' Draco then asked, glancing at the dead bird again whom still laid peacefully on the pillow.
A slight nod.
'I seriously thought your room would be the same size as that room you had last year,' Harry admitted as he moved from Draco's bed to his wardrobe — opened it up to take a look at the heap of blue clothes that were almost identical to the sky outside. Only a burgundy red jumper was sticking out; the one that was actually Harry's. He then moved to Draco's desk and spotted an unfinished letter that Draco had been writing to Harry before his father had taken him away; it made him realize that he now had two unfinished letters he had been writing to Harry — to his

And Harry stayed.
The moment flashed by, leaving in white particles as if snow was falling between memories and Harry caught glimpses of several times where his father and friends bullied young Snape; smirks on their faces as if they didn't seem to care about his feelings at all. It hurt Harry to see his father that way; it was a side he had never thought his father had possessed in his youth.

dancer.'
, Harry! Tell me why you don't talk to me anymore,' Draco demanded. 'You're just ignoring me like you don't know me!' Draco was getting more furious by the second, and perhaps more sad at the same time as well.
Sixteen years later nothing much had changed. Harry was still the black sheep of the family; a kind of disease in human form that was kept to be a secret — as much as it could be. The only thing that
After a nod, he saw Harry glance over his shoulder, at his friends who were looking around in wonder. Luna and Ginny pointed at every little detail of the architecture and Hermione seemed fascinated by the many talking statues that were positioned throughout the hallways. Students dressed in blue passed them, all nodding their heads to Draco and throwing weird looks at Harry and his friends; as if someone had disposed trash on their school's precious marble floors. Footsteps of gold were appearing in front of everyone's feet except those of Draco; leading them in a direction unknown to them — but clear to the only local of the group.
Harry let out a deep sigh as he turned around to face Draco again. The boy's hair peaked in every direction, his spectacles crooked upon his nose. The lust in his eyes had faded away as if Ron had thrown a bucket of ice cold water over him. Draco also felt a bite awkward and tried to cover his bare chest with his arms and hands, suddenly feeling that insecurity again. With flushed cheeks Harry picked up the jumper Draco had taken off only minutes ago and handed it back, perhaps in a disappointed way. 'I'm sorry,' he sighed, but Draco waved his words away. It didn't matter; of course there had been a possibility of it happening. They both had just been too stupid leave the door unlocked or choose a different moment.
stupid, his eyes focused themselves on his timepiece; the goal was for Harry to stay underwater for as long as possible. A few minutes passed but Draco knew it was too early to applaud and congratulate himself on finding a decent technique for Harry to use. His feeling was right as the tiny clock only marked seven minutes and forty-five seconds when Harry's bubble-less head appeared on the surface.
The girls all held their chins up high, just like Draco did. With their robes flaring around them, they must've been resembling butterflies fluttering against the wind as they made their way towards the castle. Especially the girls with their hair hanging loose over their shoulders; waving in sync with their robes. Draco followed their quick pace and watched each one of them carefully; making mental notes to compliment them on their elegancy later. They passed a few students whom wore the same black robes Draco had seen before; topped with brightly colored scarfs in red, green, blue and yellow.
Draco's little smile appeared again, not minding Harry's extreme enthusiasm. "I have seen them many times over the past years — and I've spoken to them at least a dozen times too. They always ask about you, always wondering if you're doing alright." Hearing those things about his parents made Harry's excitement turn into a certain sadness, a certain melancholy. Tears slowly started swelling up in his eyes, and as hard as he tried to push them away, they quickly flowed down his cheeks. "They love you so, so much, Harry. And do know that they can see you from up there too — not always, not clearly, but they can."
For the second time that night, Draco raised himself on his elbow again, looking down upon his boyfriend with shocked eyes. 'You must report this to Headmaster Dumbledore!
Harry hesitantly and with confusion visible in his eyes took a step back to stand beside Ron again, Hermione joining them with equal confusion readable on her face. With everyone now gathered around the blond, McGonagall finally cleared her throat and explained Draco's reason of stay. 'That's absurd!' one of the students called out afterwards. 'You can't let a Death Eater stay at our school!'
His mother doesn't seem very convinced but relaxes her shoulders a little, as to say that she at least
'I'm fine standing,' Draco replied with his arms now crossed. Looking away from her again but feeling an invisible magnet slowly pulling his eyes back, Draco tried to concentrate on the small fountain he could see out the breakfast room's window.
Harry just let out a deep sigh and closed his eyes, as if to ban Draco out of his view. His determination was reaching a whole new level,

. Draco's heart stopped as he first glanced at the twins, noticed they were thinking the same as their smiles faded from their handsome faces. 'She does indeed look like a toad,' André then said and Draco followed his eyes; only to see Umbridge sit next to his beloved Headmistress Madame Maxime.
'Can you please inform me once you find something?' Harry asked the Healer and he nodded in return. The nod was more firm than Harry thought he was capable of but gave him a feeling of promise; the Healer would try his best to help Harry as best as he could.
Dumbledore had seen the worry in Draco's eyes; had seen that he was struggling with keeping his nightly outings a secret to Harry any longer. Of course he had noticed the boy had grown suspicious of him; staring at him at weird times during the day and somehow trying to keep him away from Castor at all costs. Dumbledore had let him tell his story; about an object of dark magic the Slytherin was trying to fix — and with which he needed Draco's help as he wasn't the most clever Wizard of them all. Did Draco know what the object did precisely, Dumbledore had asked; to which Draco had said non. He didn't know anything more than that it was a complicated object that looked a bit like triangular closet. They hadn't been able to discuss a lot of it, though, as Harry had returned from the pensieve, from the memory of professor Slughorn, faster than Draco had thought he would.

‘Shut your mouth, monsieur Potter. Don’t you have a DADA class to give?’
Draco shrugged weakly, still crying with the girl's their hands on his shoulders. 'You wouldn't understand—,' he began but Fleur shook her head.
Draco shook his head. 'It's alright; I was looking for you anyway.'
He gathered all his courage and leapt forward, jumped, reached out for Harry's hand and felt himself fall down atop of the dragon's hard scales.
'It's a stag. Like my father's,' Harry explained.
at the boy. His voice was hoarse as if he had screamed all day, Harry's face a blur of tears.
Voldemort slowly nodded his head as he entwined his long fingers, his fingernails sticking out and making a shiver run down Draco's spine. 'With that information now provided to me, I have decided Castor will no longer be joining our side — at least, not directly,' he explained. Draco wanted to ask what that meant; wether the boy was dead or not — locked away somewhere. A silence fell, however, and the topic seemed to be closed. 'Even though you have helped someone else with completing his task, you haven't quite completed your own,' he then stated.
, Draco was quite the celebrity as well. In France however, Harry didn’t get as much attention at all and could enjoy his time without being stopped every other second.
'Draco,' the voice repeated, but once again Draco ignored it, for his father now had joined her as well. With his hand on her waist, his other locked in hers, they twirled through the room together — making Draco laugh.
'Draco.' Light grey eyes opened themselves, were greeted by a light brighter than expected. It was probably around noon, and he had forgotten he had fallen asleep in the early morning and not at night. Looking to his left, he saw Harry wide awake stare back with vibrant green eyes. Polished emeralds. Sticky strands of hair against the boy's forehead. 'Hello,' he whispered, as if only now realizing Draco was there, next to him.
A fury rose to his head before it started spinning of exhaustion, his body having to lay itself down in order to stay wake. In those moments he heard Voldemort say something — laugh again — but on his face was still readable that he was confused by what Draco had done. That he felt defeated, somehow. Or weaker than he had done before.
It unfolded in front of his eyes, grew bigger and scarier by the second as it towered above their figures — then above all the large piles that surrounded them. Draco's eyes found Castor's, whom faced the fire with a fear in his eyes Draco for once could understand.
Potter shrugs, as if he himself isn't even sure why he's worried about such a miserable man as Draco Malfoy. “Ever since your trail I've just been wondering where you were and—“
She would hate him and send him right back to Beauxbatons if he told her about him. 'I-I went to Hogsmeade. You told us we could go, Madame,' he told her instead. Looking up into her eyes was something he didn't want to but had to do — and to his surprise he noticed their expression had softened at his words.
'Precisely! I don't see him the same way as you and Harry do.'
'It's nothing. They just seem… excited, that's all,' he answered.

Looking at Hermione and Ron, they both seemed to be equally confused as him, wondering who dared to come steal things that weren't even theirs to take? 'Who took those things away, Kreacher?' Harry asked, looking back at the elf with a demanding stare.

Harry sighed, opened his mouth to say something but got shut off by the staircase suddenly moving again. Taking ahold of the balustrade and watching Draco do the same, they moved to another hallway where an old Wizard was awaiting them. 'Aha,' Dumbledore called out. 'Just the duo I was looking for. Follow me, please.'
The first part is written in cursive because it briefly describes Harry's feelings for Draco during some of the most important events that I have already written in detail in previous chapters.
Comforting, strong arms wrapped themselves around him — and he noticed how cold he was. 'It's alright — you're alright.'
'He has Draco,' Harry stammered. 'He has taken him away from me. He's not safe anymore. What — What if he's dead? Did I kill him?' He looked up into his friends' eyes. They looked exhausted after dragging Harry away from Dumbledore's corpse — after Harry had cried next to it for what had seemed like hours. Their own eyes were red and swollen as well, for they had shed tears of their own for the Headmaster they had adored just as much.

Madame knocked on the wooden door and within a second the face of Hagrid appeared in its opening. A big smile graced his face and he gave Madame's hand another kiss. A giant flower was placed in his fur coat's front pocket and it looked like he had combed his wild hair; it looked slightly different than before. Hagrid invited his Headmistress to follow him towards the Forbidden Forest, and Madame did so after throwing a glance over her shoulder at Draco; a sign that he should follow as well.
he muttered to no-one in particular.
Hanging a piece of pearl jewelry around his left ear, Draco turned around to stare at Harry; a sudden lost boy. 'I'm sure that Dumbledore has given you this task for a reason, Harry.
Draco managed to give him a nod as he held on to his books with dear life. 'I'm fine.'
Another sound was heard at the bottom of the tower; voices far away and more footsteps — but not very near. Still, it drew Harry's attention away for a few seconds — which was enough for the scene he had been spying on to evolve into catastrophe. A bright green light filled the whole Astronomy tower and Harry could swear he heard someone shout in a muffled way. Blinded and confused by it all, he couldn't help himself from hiding away any longer. His curiosity wanted to come out; see what had happened and know who had died. Because there was only one spell in the entire Wizarding World that blasted off a curse with such a bright color of green; the spell of Death. Avada Kedavra had been casted — but on who?
