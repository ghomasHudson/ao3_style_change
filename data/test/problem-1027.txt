About to take a bite when Malfoy proposed that, the Gryffindor looked at the other with his mouth open wide, fork lingering in front of him in the air before he lowered it. He hadn't been sure on what he would do at Hogwarts, not on his own accord or with the blond. But if they could use the room of Requirement and host a party there with the others that would be quite the perfect way to spend their time.
Now that took a turn he had never thought it would. Surely, he had come to the conclusion the other appreciated his presence, but that was about it. Or so he thought. He wasn't sure what the blonde had been about to say, yet it couldn't be that. There was no way, he shouldn't hope for such a thing. It was ridiculous he even came up with the idea.
"Not that it's any of my business though, excuse me for my…" he hesitated for a moment, wondering about what he should say next. "My impulsive words." He decided, not satisfied with what he'd said, but going with it nonetheless. It was all a part of his defensive system. The more unusual he acted in front of Potter, the more it scared him, and the more he tried to get away from it. What he'd done just now, was a perfect example.
A yawn escaped Harry as he laid in the embrace of the blonde. Honestly, he wanted to sleep, yet just the mere thought of the person he was cuddled up with and was actually returning the embrace was the very person he had started to grow attached to had him too awake to actually do so. It didn't seem as he could just slip away but that didn't matter. Lingering in the moment was a nice thing as well.
Ron didn't seem to be pleased to have been stopped in his tracks but after a few seconds, he crossed his arms and sniffed.
After a quick meal, he left the great hall again and went to his dormitory to get ready for the day. He wasn't sure what to do after that, but he'd decide that then.
He groaned and looked up to the ceiling. Luckily he hadn't come that far yet. He should head for the great hall to ask someone there.
Now that there was nothing to focus on, just the silence and peace this room brought, he couldn't help but lightly rock back and forth. That guy really was something. Attractive, talented, and not that bad in helping others as he had supposed the Slytherin was either, yet also something he could not touch.
He probably did, but that wasn't as satisfying as nagging Potter. Or rather, a lot less entertaining. Right now he wasn't joking, the essay didn't make sense. As much of a drama queen as he could be, Draco did strive for good results. He wasn't as pushy with it as Granger, but it did grant him good grades. Potions wasn't an exception. He was very suitable to help Potter, but why would he do that? Maybe if there were something to gain…
"You'll do well, if anyone's fit to be an Auror, it's you, Potter," he assured him. As much as he'd irritated Draco throughout the years, Harry had shown a great deal of talent for defense against the dark arts. Not only that but if Draco would have been able to get over himself, he would've admitted that Potter was someone to look up to. A born leader and fighter, highly suitable to become an Auror or something of the sort. His abilities were something to be jealous of, Draco couldn't deny that.
Harry wished to know what had made the other upset, although he knew better. One does not hide their emotions for no reason after all. It made him wonder what could have popped up in his friend's mind all that sudden to make him this emotional.
He had cuddled up on the other? Harry didn't have any collection of that at all, but then again he had no evidence to suggest he had not done any of such thing. But maybe it was an instinct in him. He had slept quite peacefully this night because someone else had been there. Maybe that was what he needed after all. Yet he couldn't just ask someone to sleep with him, now could he?
It seemed as if time didn't exist, as if they were in a completely different reality, one that almost seemed too perfect to be true.
As soon as the words left his mouth, he knew he was wrong. Well, not entirely. It was true that he rarely spent time here because he was hurt, but that was mostly because he didn't bother to come here in the first place. He kept things like that to himself.
Draco couldn't think clearly, he hardly registered Harry's words. He was too busy trying to comprehend that he was even there. It took him a while to figure things out, but eventually, he did. Sort of.
Harry had felt quite lonely even though he had friends besides those two, like Luna and Malfoy. Yet he felt differently when he was with the blonde. It felt the same as when he had been crushing on Cho Chang, as when he had been dating Ginny and was looking forward to seeing her again so that he could kiss her. Fuck. Malfoy was just being a nice friend and offering some guidance, there was no need to have expectations and hope for things that would never happen. Why did this happen anyway? Was it because of last night?
It apparently woke Neville up as he found said guy shoot him a confused look that soon turned in worry, Harry simply offered him a smile. "Don't worry, I'm fine," he said before the other could speak up. Neville slowly nodded before getting out of bed, eyes darting to the clock. It was 9 am, enough time for a relaxed breakfast.
Now if only his body would move right now, that would be great. But with Hermione staring at the two of them, Ron's hair peeking from behind her before he also came in view, he felt as if they had intruded. Noticing Harry's gaze shifting to something behind him, Draco turned around to see what or who it was. His body instantly stiffened and he could almost feel himself fall back into his usual posture, cold and distant. He had the urge to curse the two Gryffindors for walking in at this exact moment but was wise enough to not do so.
"Aha.." Draco hummed, concentrating on his bread. They had had this conversation before, and as much as he wanted to be there for Pansy, he had gotten bored with her rants. But he supposed it was fair to listen since she put up with his rants about Potter as well. Speaking of Potter, Draco realized he should be having lunch as well. He looked up and scanned the crowd of students, looking for a familiar mop of messy black hair. Honestly, did that guy even know there were several ways to tame such hair?
A hiss left his mouth. How could he do that?! Panic flashed through him. How deep was this part of the lake anyway? That blonde was so damn stubborn, didn't he notice how dangerous it was to stand there? It could crack beneath him.
A huff and a small smile was the only thing that came from him as he made his way to the ice. No way was he going to let the other live with that. He took a bundle of snow before he set foot on the frozen lake, grinning back.
Draco hadn't expected this. He'd thought that, especially after the war, Harry would want to be with the remaining people. That he'd want to be with them because they were still alive, to celebrate that. Draco couldn't find a reason for him to stay at Hogwarts, which probably only reminded him of the battle that had taken away so many people. Draco, on the other hand, had become convinced that it was his right to stay here. To stay at the place that reminded him of the awful things he'd done as some kind of punishment. All the death eaters had been punished, except for him. It was only fair for him to stay here without his family.
The Gryffindor reflected all of these things, proving that they were both reduced to the same kind of a mess.
Rather than a restless night, Harry had slept quite well. He couldn't really place where his dream was going to though. Aside the humming and the fire there had been something white and bright. He had no idea what it was at first until he recognized it as his Patronus. It was walking towards where he was looking, towards the fire, and then came to a stop to rest. It had just been this until something else came in view as well. Though before he could figure out what it was he woke up by something brighter than any of it, something that was more of a building site lighting luminaire.
He was and had always been, toxic. It was almost astounding how well the Slytherin could beat himself up, how low he could think of himself while pride was one of his foremost characteristics. Pride and vanity were his armor, his way to protect himself. He must have lost them during the war because Draco had noticed they had been absent all year.
He wasn't that sure anymore. Somehow, the hospital wing had become a place filled with new emotions. So much had happened between him and Potter, just in a few hours, in one room. Leaving would mean stepping back into the real world, and Draco wanted to postpone that moment for as long as possible. It was nice here.
"We're going to get food," he muffled from the bed and leaned against the wall to hold himself up just for a bit, "and we're going to do the Quidditch thing if you still want to."
He bit his lip hard and could feel his flesh break under the pressure and he instantly regretted it as he quickly pressed his fingers to it. "Just come here, bastard."
To Malfoy, it seemed like the golden trio was in quite a quarrel. He didn't feel like he had the right to interfere but did realize he was the one who'd caused this. This meant he should be helping to resolve it.
Harry looked off to the side to his red-haired friend. "I really appreciate your offer Ron, but I really don't want to intrude." Ron laughed. "You won't, and you know that. My mom loves you." Harry smiled at that. Yes, Harry had always felt like Mrs. Weasley truly liked him. It had made it easier for him to sit with the Weasleys.
Focused on his own little bubble he missed how they had moved towards the library. Hermione had said they should just head there as she needed a book as well, but he had failed to pay attention. The dizziness got worse and black spots formed in front of his eyes. "You know, I was meaning to ask you before…" Ron started. Harry hummed to encourage him to continue as the small spots turned to rather large black pools, his body swaying. "I heard from other students that they were going home for Christmas and all, and I was quite excited to go home myself but you don't really want to go home, I guessed. So what I thought- maybe you should just join us this year again."
"Maybe my parents should've made an effort to show me that then," he whispered, looking at the other through watery eyes.
He looked up at the Gryffindor, a mildly agitated look still lingering on his face. He noticed how the other's hair was a wild black mess, even messier than usual if that was even possible. He looked tired too, but probably less than Draco. He was like an actual lion who'd just woken up from a nap, Draco noticed. That was really all it could remind him of.
Harry had fallen asleep not long after Draco had left. He had been quite peaceful until he heard distant voices. They were quite familiar, but he couldn't quite figure out from where or who they belonged to. When someone shook him, he groaned hitting the back of the person's hand. "Let me sleep."
It was honestly a ridiculous situation. Draco Malfoy, offering that damn golden child help with his homework in exchange for a quill. What would his parents say if they knew? What would his friends think? What would his past self think? Certainly not what happened next. Draco nodded and took the pen, examining it for a bit, before nodding. "That'll do then."
His mind was spinning, thoughts of the Triwizard tournament coming back to him. This part was pretty damn deep, wasn't it? He had probably been around here when he had to go down for Ron. Heck, those creatures there were not all that friendly.
Not much later the door disappeared behind them, separating them from the things that had happened in there.
The silence had worried Malfoy. For the first time, he was worried if he'd been too mean. If the mocking had become too serious. It probably hadn't though, since Potter just continued after a little while. This meant Draco joined in again as well. "Maybe."
"We're not placing those at the party," he huffed. Fortunately he had only been caught twice under them, once when he and Hermione waited for Ron to hurry up and once when he had been wandering around and found Luna. Both incidents had been a kiss on the cheek. Harry wondered if there were people who would wait all day under one to get a kiss or some believed in the extreme version of it.
"Anyway, I just wanted to drop these things off. If either of you has any questions about Draco's condition, just floo one of these people," he taps the parchment, now resting next to Draco's wand. "Your floo is open to call any of them, any time you want."
It was warm and cosy. Plush sofas, oak kitchen, glass tables. Draco had, of course, transformed most of it to his own liking.
They'd talked about France at the shop - about his whirlwind romance with Scorpius' father, the aftermath, the years of work it took to become half the man he had once been. All for you, he never said.
"If everyone eats their sandwiches, it will be jelly time!" Jo shouted, grinning as the kids stormed towards the dining area.
"I am," came the reply when Potter pulled off, grinning up at Draco as two beautiful fingers slipped inside. His mouth moved to cover Draco's stomach in tiny, torturous kisses.
"Treat you so good." He rocked into Draco with deep, harsh thrusts that had Draco arching up and moaning every time Harry pushed into him. Every kiss was bruising, hands scratching up arms and down backs, desperate desire burning.
Picking out a few pairs of jeans, trousers, and a very nice button-down, he tried finding the tills.
If there was one thing Draco hoped he'd never live without, it was that sensation. The filthy sounds of Potter licking and sucking like his life depended on it, one hand holding Draco's hips in place, the other resting over his hole.
"He's... nice?" Ron asked, clearly not understanding. The girl holding his hand quickly broke away, running to sit in front of Draco. "Rose... Rose, no, don't sit with Malfoy."
Draco had threatened him with a dunk in the Thames if he didn't shower immediately, and he very quickly agreed the shower was probably his best option.
"Yes," Maria agreed, nodding her head. Thick curls bounced over her eyes, then back again. "And I'm going to let my brother put it in a weave this weekend."
Harry grabs the keys and his coat, about to head to the door. Throwing caution to the wind, Harry drops down to his knees, bending over just right to push his footstool far under the desk.
"Come on," Potter says again, looping an arm around his waist to support him. Draco watches as he swishing his wand at the room, bag and coat flying towards them and onto his shoulder.
"Potter," his voice shook as he raised his head to meet Potter's gaze. "How do you feel about fucking my face?"
"You said these were for lunch, so you better not try eating any." Draco scolded. He picked all the boxes up, moving them into the fridge. "I'll start making the basket when Gra- Hermione has left."
"Yeah. Wait, didn't you read the papers? Just after the trials, he broke it off with Weasley's sister and told everyone he was gay."
“Perhaps a winter wedding? The snow would be lovely,” Luna had said when the first few months went by, determined to convince Draco she knew what she was saying.
"Yes," Andromeda said, giving a very pointed look at Harry. "Yes, that sounds exactly like Harry here. Dropped off the face of the earth. If it weren't for the Minister, I'm sure the papers would have been advertising his death within a fortnight."
Tight jeans - not the new ones, these were a pair Jenna had forced him into on an impromptu shopping trip, telling him his arse looked amazing in them - the button down he'd bought Saturday, and he'd even gotten his hair under control.
"Yes, you're definitely developing the equipment," he caught as she rifled through her bag, pulling out nausea potions and a thick book. "You'll want to read this, then have a long hard think. I've written down the incarnations you'll need as well."
"You know I couldn't stay here. Draco did, of course." Narcissa was watching her son, perhaps confused by his closeness to Harry. "It was only this morning he told me he's been living with muggles since I left. Can you believe that?"
"I don't want to interrupt you, but I think there's going to be a murder if someone doesn't stop the kids." Jo butts in, pointing up towards the office. A string of desert-related curses was slowly getting louder.
Plus it's hot as fuck and Draco knows, somewhere in his mind, that he could come undone just by sucking on Potter's beautiful cock.
"This is Teddy, my godson," Harry explained, grabbing the boy from behind and hoisting him onto his shoulder. "Your aunt Andromeda is his grandmother."
"You're mine," Potter confirmed, drawing back until he was standing, hands cupping his arse so he could lift him into the perfect place.
"What do you want? I have my tea and everything, look." Draco waved a hand towards the corner in the table, piled high with sandwiches and ginger tea.
A small note from a witch stating he'd been recommended for their potions team, and asking if he'd mind receiving a floo call to check his experience.
But the slick was still pouring out of him, leaving him feeling horribly empty, and something inside him knew toys wouldn't be enough to sate the feeling.
Harry nodded, squatting to grab his footstool from the far back of his desk, and grinned when he heard Jenna swear.
He struggled to remember the last time he'd gone a date. Must have been six months ago, with a cute redhead from the bakery three doors down. That hadn't ended well, considering both men has made it all the way to the bedroom before realising they both preferred taking it.
When they came back, only Luna and Hermione dared mention the wedding. Harry pointedly ignored it all.
Harry considered him a moment, then directed his gaze to Finnigan. "I told you to leave." When he looked ready to argue, Harry shifted his head towards Draco. "You're scaring the kid. Get out of here."
Draco watched as the tiles filed back, opening a tiny arch into a new room. He followed Potter in, marvelling at the space.
Of course, they'd all overreacted. Someone had gone running off, coming back with a medical witch and Potter, panting and asking him where he hurt.
The rains had finished in the early hours of Saturday, leaving the streets damp when Harry caught the tube into the city.
"Very much so," came the reply. Harry felt eyes on him, turning to see Malfoy giving him another once over. His skin started burning, and he found himself liking the attention. "And you? Muggle daycare centre, I'm guessing a nice little flat tucked away somewhere, intrigued by a description my boss gave to her sister?"
He tried to stay strong, but the fear crept into his voice. He was an Omega, currently surrounded by two Alphas - oh look, there's a Weasley Alpha. Now there were three of them, and Draco was holding his son just a little bit tighter.
"Draco, don't." Harry warned, already moving back from the door. "If you need anything, owl Neville or Luna. But I'm going to be out of commission for a week or so, alright?"
"Merlin, you could at least wait until after dessert to lose your mind," Draco mumbled, eyeing the door to the kitchens. "I want my tiramisu, and I'd like to avoid it flying off my spoon, thank you very much."
"I'd need to find a sitter, for Scorpius." He bounced the small child, who'd remained strangely quiet. "But once I do that I could start straight away."
Draco looked at him then, biceps pressing against the material of his dress shirt. He was always well dressed in a very muggle way when he was in the shop - but he did all the heavy lifting, and it showed.
Harry swore. He may have survived numerous near-death experiences, but this conversation would kill him. He'd die choking on a toffee.
For a moment Harry had to resist to pick the girl up and swing her around in the air. He was thankful for her words because he could already see others mumble in agreement to that, even though they seemed unsure, while others just shrugged it off and were okay with it in general. He didn't know why he had that effect on people.
When the two Slytherins returned to the castle, they weren't cold anymore at all. Fooling around on ice turned out to be just as exhausting as Draco remembered it to be. Their faces were now flushed from the cold combined with exercise, and Draco's coat hung over his shoulder, as he didn't need it anymore now that they were inside again.
"Anyway," he resumed, less confident than before. "That's all I wanted to tell you. If this made you more reluctant to go to the party, I'll take my hands off of it, I don't want it to go to waste because of me."
Did this mean the room had changed or had Draco's needs changed? Had the room deliberately showed itself to Harry because it simply wanted to satisfy Draco's needs? No, no that couldn't be it.
Even though it was the truth, cuz it would be a good thing if his two best friends could get along with his new buddy Malfoy, it would also mean they would probably be able to hang out more and he wasn't sure if that was good for his heart. As his eyes found Malfoy's staring at him, he felt his heart rate pick up. Yeah, that was definitely bad…
And a smile. Merlin wanted him dead now, didn't he? Harry had been glad he could breathe again, but with this action, he almost choked on it again. That guy really didn't know half of what he was doing to him, did he? Still, he couldn't really blame the other as he had asked the blond to play for him, not the other way around.
Harry should have expected this, should have been prepared for anything of this sort, but he wasn't. The other had spoken softly, yet he had heard it clearly. Unable to form words he decided to just act and made his way over to the other, almost crawling towards the other as he didn't trust his legs. "You sure?" He asked, watching the other as he bit his lip.
He looked back at Pansy, who seemed to be a bit amused by all of this. Of course, she was, she'd always laughed at Draco's ability to make things more dramatic than they really were or turned out to be. To Draco, the fact that she was amused, was a good sign. It was a sign that the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were willing to coöperate with Slytherins, but that the Slytherins were willing to do this too.
Earlier Ron had given him a package, which he had put away and not opened due to their little argument. Harry stared at it for a while before he dumped the damp towel on the ground. His hair was still somewhat wet from his shower, but he didn't mind that right now. As he opened the box he found a sweater inside and he could feel himself sink further on his bed.
Draco was giving him a funny look. Harry knew why. The box - just smaller than a dinner plate - was plain black. No logo, no description. Just a black box.
"Bloody hell, not another one." Harry buried his face in his hands. He'd gone through Teddy getting food stuck on the ceiling for far too long. He wasn't allowing it to happen again.
"This is your condition, right? I remember Remus having a reaction like this after one of his changes. Come on," he's pulling at Draco's shoulders again, "I'd rather get you to one of our safe houses than risk something here."
They were making his skin itch all over, and the sick feeling in his gut wasn't going away, but he had to keep going. It had faded after his last transformation. Okay, it took a week and a bit, but it all died down. He just had to wait a week this time.
He shifted, trying to put space between himself and the other man, somehow escaping the suffocating grip.
"She said there was this really beautiful bloke her sister works with, who's hot but hides it, and looks like sex on legs if you catch him when he's got nothing but sexy stuff before washing day." Malfoy turned to Harry then, blush furious, and smirked. "I think she might have been selling you short."
Potter didn't argue - didn't even fight. Just held Draco's head in his hands, rocking his hips into the air.
When Hermione came by with Scorpius and Teddy, the two of them were grinning from ear to ear at what they saw. Their family.
"Harry Potter, you did not." Jenna gasped at him, reaching for his wrist so she could drag him into the ball pit.
"I was already broken. Ginny... it wasn't going to work out. Merlin knows I've figured that part out. I was with her because I felt like I needed her there to keep me together. When she left, and the trials were over, I finally realised I couldn't cope with it all. Every newspaper and magazine talking about it all, showing my face, talking about all the great things I'd done. Ginny didn't break me. Not even the war managed to do that. It was Rita Skeeter, and all those others at the Prophet."
Draco liked looking out the little window in the brewing room to watch Neville taking care of the plants. Having a fellow Omega nearby put his mind at ease.
“A nice, hot summer wedding would be best, right?” She had asked once again, the delicate tone in her voice dropping at last.
His dildo collection - all very carefully hidden beneath his bed - included one very special one he used to practice this exact act.
The Weasleys had all gradually spoken to him, dragging him into bone-crushing hugs and asked him countless questions about how he was doing. They'd questioned his proximity to Draco, who had moved to sit on the floor between his feet, playing wizards chess with the children and - after watching his daughter being taught a superior tactic - a very upset Ron. It had been easy to answer their question - good, very good, he's a friend, stop teasing him just because he's not as good as you.
"Oh, sorry. We don't really have any places open-" She glanced at Harry, studying his features. "But for the sake of improving Potter's sense of fashion, we can squeeze her in."
Like now, when all the staff are huddled in the office, brewing coffee, watching lightning in the distance.
Potter eased his hips forwards, pushing his cock in until his balls were resting against Draco's nose. He definitely hadn't considered those.
"That wasn't my fault." Harry insisted, pointing an accusing spoon at Draco. "Just because I made you jump a little, doesn't mean you can blame me."
“You know why,” he said pointedly, ignoring that treacherous part of him begging for Harry’s touch and pushing the Alpha away. “And I want lunch. I’ll be back in thirty.”
"Draco, I need to leave. You're being affected by your condition, and I'm not doing anything with you if you're not entirely with me."
"Please," Draco begged, wrists twisting to escape the ropes - to pull Potter close and get him where he wanted him.
The ice cream, as it had to be, was the perfect mix of frozen and melted gloop. He’d learned that lesson somewhere amidst the Great War of the Frozen Desserts. Ron had never let him live it down.
"I was just saying to your mum that we've got some brewing positions opening at the Ministry. I'll get someone to owl you about it."
"Except for every weather report for the last two weeks, telling you a storm was blowing in this week."
The boy finally looked away from the pan, eyes landing on Draco. A squeal erupted as he ran forwards, hair shifting through several shades of blond before it landed on the exact platinum of Draco's.
When he gets to the back exit, Malfoy's by his side, ready to leave. Setting the security, walking out and locking the door, it suddenly sets in.
Harry laughed again – deep and smooth – breath fanning down the back of Draco’s shirt. “Because you’re hard and you fucking know it.”
Draco wanted it. Draco wanted it so badly it hurt. But he couldn’t bear to hear everyone talking about it, every time he saw them.
This is what he wants. This is exactly what he needs. Like this he can control Potter - make him bend to every whim.
"What do you think?" Jenna asked at the same moment face poked its way around the door. Head dyed bright pink, Harry couldn't help but be reminded of Tonks for a moment.
"And Draco was just... eating?" Draco tries to ignore his mother pushing the plate of biscuits towards him. Just to prove a point he snatches up a custard cream, stuffing it into his mouth.
Malfoy, however, had stopped what he was doing and didn't move. He had to be very careful now, the wrong words or no words at all could be the end of him. He couldn't keep his mouth shut for long. He carefully straightened up from his crouching position. "You've asked me this before," he answered.
If there is any trouble while we are away, please inform Bradley. He will try to rearrange things to your convenience.
"Can be anything, as long as it interests me," Draco replied. There wasn't a specific thing he wanted. Proposing a deal like this was ridiculous anyway, but he still wasn't backing away. Maybe he'd expected Potter to react a lot more offended, or angry.
Harry hummed. "Ah, well forget about it then." If there had been no mention of what happened, maybe the war itself at all, it was not his place to say anything. Looking to the side he found the glass and with a soft puff, he decided to just take it down in one go. He was glad he did, 'cause it tasted horrible. "I thought it was over, yet it seems Pomfrey still belongs to the group that wants me gone. Merlin, what was in there?"
Draco stopped talking, breathing steadily and slowly to remain as calm as possible. The silence was pressing and his emotions were beginning to become a real bother. If only they knew how guilty he felt, but how hard it was to express this. How difficult it was for him to apologize and face everything he'd done. What was he thinking, trying to talk to the people he'd called a mudblood, or other filthy names? How could he possibly excuse his terrible behavior?
Harry had stepped one foot outside the building when he decided that no, that's too cold. With a frustrated sigh, he had come back into the building and wandered along the halls. Eventually, he had just given up on finding a place and just sank down on a bench in a hallway. He didn't know where this hallway was located exactly, but he was damn hungry.
"I mean, you don't look like you're very eager to eat anything at all," he corrected himself. "And I don't want you to faint because you've got me emotionally invested in you now. That makes you a victim of my care if you like it or not."
As he finally spotted the other, somewhere in the halls after passing through many of them, he let out a long breath.
Of course, the library again. He nodded and turned around on his heels. As he came back to the table he assembled the papers."Can you keep it with you?" He asked the blond, not handing it to him or waiting for a reaction as he placed the bundle of loose parchments on the table next to the other before he walked away again. This time he wasn't searching someone to help or come to the party, but just someone who could get his mind of… other things.
Relieved Harry made sure to point at Malfoy without putting the blonde in a spotlight, just tapping his own shoulder to signal his friend to look behind him.
He'd said it to protect himself, but when he looked back at it, it was a bit… well, very rude actually. Maybe that was really just the thing that'd put him into Slytherin. He thought about apologizing but didn't. Potter wasn't worth his effort, right?
It did make him wonder as of why he could have entered the room without any problems if this had been the guy's safe haven. Had he forgotten to lock the door, or was that even possible with a place like the room of requirement? The room had its own ways of handling things after all.
"I'll see you later. We can discuss the details of the party by then as well." With these words, he decided to walk away.
Not sure if the other would let him, he hastily tried to guide the other away from view. He had learned that he should have been more open with people as the years came by, but this was Malfoy. Harry wasn't sure how to act with him, but now the blonde was in a state like this he guessed he should just let him get it out for now. Letting go of Malfoy's wrist he grabbed the blanket. "I uh, am at a loss of words here so uhm," he spread his arms, inviting both the cold and Malfoy in. "You look like you need a hug or something though…"
With his last thought, the gears in his mind suddenly clicked on that topic, parents. As he noticed he was still staring at the other, he cleared his throat. "So, uhm. On the brighter side, what are your plans for Christmas, huh?"
Draco didn't sit down. He felt a bit empty now that he was done talking. It felt like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders, but not entirely. There was still something pressing down on him, something that would probably never be lifted. He deserved Weasley's resentment, and he deserved that weight on his shoulders.
Draco let out a frustrated sound and slapped his book shut. Why was he becoming so obsessed with the other? He thought it'd stop after he knew for sure what Potter felt for him, but that had only worsened it. The Gryffindor kept popping up in his mind at the worst times, accompanied by the most embarrassing thoughts. Draco was becoming a mess, even when he wasn't directly in front of the other. He really needed to sort things out, he needed to decide if he wanted to put his feelings away before they worsened. His mind and heart were fighting each other, leaving him confused and desperate for some rest. How was he ever going to figure this out…
This feeling of loneliness could have led him to Potter, in some way. Because they both struggled with the war, and they both didn't quite fit in anymore.
Harry's body stiffened at these words. He thought Malfoy had understood his reasons, that he had still been talking about Ron and-
Draco nodded. He didn't know what else to do, so maybe they could just return to the common room, get some tea and a book… They left the great hall and started walking back to their dormitories. It was then that Pansy suddenly perked up, wearing a smirk that simply meant trouble. "Speaking of acts for the party," she began.
Harry brought his hand to his temple. There was this itching pain growing in his head and he hated it. "You got your books for that Potion assignment?" Hermione asked as she grabbed her things. Ah yes, he had to get that other book. Well, he could do that later at the end of the day as well.
He shifted their positions a bit so that he could reach the other's chest and latched his mouth onto it, not being patient enough to be slow and gentle.
After a moment he stretched his hand out to the other. Malfoy looked down at the other's hand, not sure what to do. In the end, it just seemed silly not to shake it, he'd carried him over here after all. "No problem then," he murmured as he shook his hand. All he noticed was that it was a lot warmer compared to his own.
He made sure to grab a glass of water on his way before he went to search an open spot to make his homework. There had to be anyone else to help him out, right? With a hum, his eyes fell on Neville. Was the guy good with potions? He honestly had no idea. He knew the guy was gifted in herbology. Maybe the guys knew someone who knew though.
He let the Gryffindor struggle for a while but eventually pulled the sheets up a bit so that he could wrap himself into them. Draco wondered how he could be complaining about the cold. Because of how close they were, he could feel the other's body warmth radiating through the sheets. He felt like moving even closer but instantly threw that idea away. What was he thinking?
"Yeah, right," Blaise scoffed, mumbling something under his breath that sounded faintly like 'traitor' and 'weak'.
At the mention of that, he stirred a bit. With it pointed out like that, the angelic sound Malfoy had produced being a 'Christmas miracle' being his soft spot, he went quiet for a while. Did that mean he had a weak spot for hearing harmonic sounds or to Malfoy himself?
Draco neatly sat down beside him, keeping his distance, but being close enough to look at the book and explain it. Yes, he was actually doing this. What a disgrace…. "Right, first of all, the information you've already have. You can completely discard that." He took a new roll of parchment and spread it out on the desk. He then continued to explain what was wrong, and what it should be. He could've done that with kind words, but he decided to put it as it was: harsh and clear.
His next trip into work begins in the medical room, reclined in a chair with a witch fussing over him. He's thankful she's put up privacy screens around him, blocking out the sights and noise of the rest of the world going on with their normal lives.
"Harry works at a daycare centre for young children. Teddy goes there every now and then when he wants to get out of the house."
Harry turned towards the window, wondering if he was even remotely ready for this. It was probably a stupid decision. It had been Jenna's idea, after all.
"I'll go see what he needs," Draco says, pressing a kiss to Harry's neck. "Give you time to sort yourself out."
"Merlin, Potter, get your cock over here." Draco reached out, grabbing Potter by the hips and moving him where he wanted him.
Harry scowled, looking past Jenna. Sophie was in the ball pit, submerged up to her chin. A small group of children were sat on the opposite side of the pit, throwing colourful plastic balls at her head.
"No thank you. I won't be staying long." He turned to Draco, a strange look in his eye, before getting down to business. "As you're aware, the two of you have been under house arrest for almost two years. You'll be released in 32 days, as agreed when the sentence was first put in place."
Draco wasn't sure if he would be able to do that while the other watched him. He wasn't even sure if he was able to play in front of anyone. However, he did want to do it. Or at least try. He didn't know why exactly. His practice time would go to waste if he stopped just because Potter had walked in, maybe that was a reason. Or maybe he just enjoyed playing the instrument he loved so much. Whichever reason it was, it caused him to get a proper grip on his violin again and lifted it up a bit.
Harry allowed the other to come closer as he simply pointed at it. "Uhm, like right here. After the part on how not to use Fairy Wing in it."
The Malfoy manor had become dead silent ever since the dark lord fell. Draco had never objected to that, he too preferred to not talk about the war, but it had put the house in a cold and frozen kind of state. Maybe it was for the best that he stayed at Hogwarts this Christmas, it would undoubtedly be nicer than going back to the manor.
Now conscious of things like his heart rate, he shifted slightly to leave actually some space, no matter how little it was, between their bodies. "I think I'm in need of regular cuddle sessions," he stated. Now that wasn't all that much better as his other thought, was it now?
Draco would have preferred to tell them the truth, but he was a magnificent actor and the lies left his mouth within seconds. "I've been studying and lost track of time," he told them.
"I suppose so…" She mumbled, clearly deep in thought about something. She eventually turned back to Draco and folded her arms. "We're done here then?"
"You know, think of it whatever you want," he spat. Then he turned around and strode over to the Slytherin table, still fuming slightly. He didn't care about the whole hall seeing him and Potter bicker. He didn't care about his anger showing. Not a single student in this whole damn school had the right to judge him, and even if they did, he couldn't care to put up with it anymore.
He had to stay floating in a sea of his own bigoted prejudices and norms, he had to survive himself in this.
He hummed as he grabbed a donut himself. "Ron sent me a message about the donuts. Couldn't miss out on them."
"Well, allow me to make an even bigger mess out of you then," he said, lips pressing against the bare skin of Malfoy's neck.
"It's just that I don't have an answer yet," he softly explained, hesitantly bringing a hand up to the other's hair to play with it. "I'm not forgetting anything, it just needs some time." Draco wasn't sure if Harry had dozed off already, but didn't want to potentially wake him up to check. He looked so peaceful like this, it'd be a shame to disrupt that.
He took another step back, swaying a bit as to mimic a jump, but not actually jumping because he knew that was probably a bit dangerous. He saw the worry on the other's face, the genuine care. It surprised him a bit, but also reminded him of the thing that explained it. He liked it though, he liked worrying the other because it showed that at least someone cared about his well-being. Was that a healthy thing to think, standing in the middle of a frozen lake like this? He pushed the thought aside and kept moving back, bit by bit, flashing the other a mocking grin.
With the dark lord gone Harry had found himself having too much time on his hands which he never knew how to exactly spend. As he spent his time with Malfoy he felt something inside him spark, but he had brushed it aside as 'that he had just been lonely after Ginny'.
Luna hummed, she seemed a little spacey but he was used to her behavior after all this time. "I think that's nice. Yet how do you plan on getting all those people, you want me to spread invitations?" Harry scoffed at that.
Harry had expected the other to take his challenge, but the way the guy was almost jumping up and down in excitement had caught him by surprise. There was this glint in the grey eyes he didn't often see. It made him feel somewhat proud to make the other boy act like this.
While he felt somewhat fuzzy, something inside him made him alert. His eyes were wide open and scanning the other's face, noting how the other seemed tired even after sleeping along with him. Maybe it was because he had been resting on top of him, it had probably made it impossible to turn in his sleep.
"Being like this, just being nice, I think you know what I mean." Draco was talking about how stupidly difficult his emotions were making his life currently. How difficult it was to ask the other to simply cuddle. Why everything was so tense and nervous and messy. Why they couldn't just have been friends instead of arch enemies since day one. Why Draco had become the bad guy and why Harry had become the hero. And why in the bloody world they weren't supposed to get along.
Harry wasn't sure what to make from the things the other told him, and hence ignored it, yet he knew that the other loved to play. Or maybe that was too strong a word to express it, he wasn't that sure.
He wasn't really sure what he was implying, all he knew was that he felt himself burning up under the guy's gaze.
As he looked through one of the windows into the lake, he started thinking about his future. His parents had left him at Hogwarts for now, but he couldn't stay there forever. This was his last year, after that he was supposed to find a job and earn his own living. Many Malfoys had lived or were living on the family's money: few of them actually worked. Draco wondered what would happen to the manor, their fortune, and to his parents. There was a chance they wouldn't return to England, so what would happen to their belongings? Would Draco inherit it, would he even want that?
He thought about the question Potter'd asked him. During his first years at Hogwarts, it had seemed very useless to even think about dating someone. He'd never really given it an honest thought. During their fifth and sixth year, he'd wanted to date someone, but mostly for the image, as he'd said. He had never been really interested in anyone, not romantically anyway. Seventh year was one big mess, so no time for romance. And eight year… this year… He didn't even know. There was one thing he did know for sure. He'd never really been in love.
Every Malfoy was a sinner when it came to vanity, and Draco was no exception. It was a part of him, just like his blond hair was a part of him. Many people would see it as a bad trait, but Draco had always worn it like a crown. Of course, there were parts of himself that he couldn't stand at all. Rotten parts that even he couldn't get himself to be proud of. But he would never accept others to call him weak or pathetic. He couldn't see himself standing below others. It was both a blessing and a curse.
"So," he tilted his head to eye the other. "I had no nightmares tonight." He didn't know why he just stated that why he had not mentioned something like 'yeah so maybe I just have to talk with someone till sleep overpowers me' or whatever.
Harry failed to follow the other's story though. Just politely trying to follow it, nodding and giving short answers was what he did until Neville was done with his story. Harry wished the other a good night and soon enough was wrapping himself up in his blankets. They smelled familiar unlike the blankets at the hospital wing had smelled like, yet he wasn't all that surprised about it.
Draco was showing a ridiculous amount of care, it baffled him. Where was this feeling coming from, and more importantly, why wasn't he hiding it?
Draco blinked a few times. That wasn't the answer he'd expected. A simple yes or no would've done, but this… He had many reasons to ask Potter this question, and he was sure the other should probably know that already. If his suspicions were right, Potter was just trying to avoid giving Draco a real answer. But what if he wasn't right? Then Draco would be the one looking ridiculous. What if he had been wrong all along? What if he was falsely accusing the Gryffindor of liking him? What did that say about him, and more importantly, how would he ever be able to face Potter normally again?
The black haired girl looked up and sighed. The good thing about their friendship was that Pansy didn't dwell on fights. Not that she was forgiving, she just chose to not bother with bitterness and hate after they'd argued. No, she was smarter than that. She'd get back at it in a different way. Right now, however, she put her book away and nodded. "Yeah, I was wondering when you'd ask. You know I'm not going to put things like that on my feet," she pointed at Draco's skates, "ever, but I'll accompany you."
His arms lowered to wrap around the other's waist, resting his head on top of the messy mop of hair his hands had made of the before decent-looking blond coupe.
"I can't stand that girl," she muttered, maybe more to herself than to Draco. As per usual, Draco took it as a comment directed towards him. No use muttering something if you didn't expect a response right? "What girl?" He asked.
Harry visibly forced his shoulders to slump, to at least let him appear more on ease, as he unconsciously rose his eyebrow at the other who made sure to take up as much space on the sofa as he could. That was quite the way to hog a spot.
Things had to go a certain way. No one could act out all of their whims and wishes, no one could satisfy all of their cravings. And oh, oh how much did Malfoy crave at that moment. Indecent things he would never say out loud, nor dare to think about for too long.
Luckily he had finished most of it. He could just write the last bit now and add it to the whole that was still in the hospital wing, with his other belongings. Harry grabbed the book and went back to the tables. Somehow it felt weird to sit at that same table without Malfoy, so he went to sit somewhere else. As he continued his writings, he managed to get stuck at some parts and with a groan circled them, knowing he would have to ask someone to help him.
"Yes, a great pillow that is," he huffed and lightly patted the other's arm before he walked past him towards the door. Harry kept walking even if while it felt like he had to force his feet to move. They felt heavy, his whole body did in fact. He let out a short hum. Was it something the potion caused?
He was so focused on the other that he didn't even mind the tear stains on his expensive shirt. Draco would've cursed anyone for doing such a thing, but Potter...
Quidditch had always been one of the few things that had challenged him. He liked trying to win, trying to be better than others. He liked to be proud when he won, especially if it was against someone like Potter. The main reason he'd joined the team during his second year was that of that.
"Didn't know you had that weak spot all along," he added, now crossing his leg upon the bed while he leaned back on his hands, smirk still there and one of his eyebrows now raising up as well. Yes, teasing was fun.
Eventually, the Slytherin stopped to catch his breath. His hair was messy and his face was probably a bit redder than it usually was, but he didn't really mind. He looked up to Potter, who was still just standing at the edge. Somehow, he felt childish enough to call out and try to provoke the other.
Surely there had to be a good explanation for this, he couldn't do what Draco thought he was doing, that would be ridiculous.
Harry tugged the glasses from his face. Even though he had problems with his sight ever when he was younger, his uncle had told him there was no need for a kid like him to wear glasses. Maybe it was because he kept bumping into people that they had decided to buy him these. He had to admit he had experienced problems with it, even so, it probably being a cheap thing.
"I'll read this later. For now, I expect you to hand in your next assignments at the same time the other students do mister Potter. Else you'll be writing more like these," he lifted the assignment in his hand to indicate the load of work he was referring to, "As well as that I'll put you in detention. Is that clear?"
He scanned the common room, looking for someone he could try to convince to join him. Luckily, Pansy was sitting near the fire, flipping through some kind of book. Malfoy walked up to her and sat down on one of the armrests of an unoccupied armchair near hers. "So," he began, "the lake's frozen." He grinned at her, giving her the 'you know what I'm implying' look.
In all honesty, he felt stupid. Not just for telling him or telling him to forget it afterward, but just for having these feelings at all. It only caused problems he didn't want. Maybe it was for the best to let the topic rest for now. Malfoy didn't have an answer ready yet. Besides, he didn't want to ruin this nice cuddle moment. However, he did want the other to know that it was okay, that Malfoy didn't judge him or wanted to end their friendship. Because he absolutely didn't.
"Mal, get- fuck that's cold. Get away from there or it might break," he said, hand still trying to fish all the last bits of ice out of his neck. His nose felt cold after that hit as well and he wouldn't be surprised if it was red because of it. That did not take away his worry though.
Malfoy got himself some coffee and started silently sipping, his grip on the cup being a tad tighter than needed. He was glad there was no one trying to talk to him. His friends, or what was left of them, were either still in the Slytherin dormitories or already done eating. The other students around him didn't talk to him either, which Malfoy had gotten used to by now. Most of them were younger than him and judged him for being a former death eater. The rest was either too scared or despised him too much.
The Slytherin felt himself freeze a bit. This was enough evidence, right? It was pretty obvious now. But it hadn't been put into literal words yet. Somehow, even though it was nearly a fact, Malfoy couldn't get himself to believe it. He wondered if he would even believe it if Potter would admit it. But then again, wasn't this just a matter of wanting to believe it? There was one way to end all of this, to maybe get his mind to shut up. He had to know for sure if he was right about this.
She looked up, blinking a few times before a small smile played on her lips as she replied with a polite 'yes', accompanied by a nod. His excited feelings about it were dwelling up, though he could feel that his lack of sleep made it hard to express that. "We were thinking about holding a little celebration in the room of requirement with everyone who stays, what do you think?"
"Hey, so about Christmas," he started, "we could celebrate it with all the students that stay at Hogwarts. We could plan it out, use the room of Requirement, make it a real party." Now Draco wasn't sure if any student, except for the Slytherins, would be willing to do something that he'd proposed. None of the remaining eight-year students seemed to have forgiven him for his actions during the war. He didn't blame them, and he would never ask them to forgive him, but it still hurt. There was a big chance no one would want to come, but maybe if Harry hosted it… Maybe he could just help behind the scenes, make it a great party to repay them for what he'd done to their friends and family.
Harry laughed at that. "Seems so. Would have tried to sleep if it weren't that I knew he would come back to my thoughts. Sorry to keep you." He fiddled with the blanket after that. The only time they hadn't been bickering was when they had been discussing his Potion's homework, yet he didn't really feel like bringing that up right now.
Even though he had gone through his own stuff with the war, Harry knew that he probably could never fully understand what the other had been through. Just like he wasn't that sure if he could manage to recall these memories to tell anyone about what had happened.
With a soft smile on his face at that remark, Harry brought their lips back together for a few seconds.
He started to whistle as he came to the end of his essay. It had been quite nice to actually sit back and not yell at one another. They should do this-ohhhhh no. NO. Stop. Right. There. Harry, keep your head cool. After this, they would just split up again and that was it… He guessed…
As soon as said Slytherin was done eating, he got up and gathered his stuff. "I'm leaving early, need a book for astrology," he informed Pansy. She merely nodded as she continued eating. Draco turned around and strode out of the great hall, making his way to the library. However, halfway there he got stopped by an owl that came soaring at him. Now owls weren't allowed in the hallways and it wasn't usual for them to try to reach their owners during school hours. This meant that whatever message this owl was carrying, it had to be important.
Letting out a deep sigh, Harry let himself sink back on the bench and drop his mop of dark hair against the wall. "I had no idea…"
With his mind still lightly on Christmas, he recalled Ron's request to come over to his house. He felt like he would intrude though. And with the way things were going now, Snape would probably be on the verge of strangling him or anything. He guessed he had to stay at Hogwarts if he wanted to get on the right track with his assignments.
Because he was so focused, he'd totally forgotten about his surroundings after a while. He felt so happy and content that he wouldn't have noticed anyone walking in. As a result, the opening door didn't alarm him. He hadn't even registered it. For the first time in days, Potter had left his mind, even though he had just entered the room.
'Someone. If you hear this, please send help.' Harry wanted to slam his head against the table and-THUD. Oh no, he just couldn't control himself now, did he? He groaned, feeling his forehead tingle. That hurt. "I didn't mean it in such a way necessarily," he mumbled while rubbing his head. "Take a joke, Mal." He shifted in his seat and- oh shit... He did not.
The Slytherin nearly dropped his violin, but caught it in mid-air and clumsily held it, his eyes still set on the other. His secret was revealed now. This room wasn't his private space anymore. Someone had evaded the place only he could reach, which felt very surreal to him. Why wasn't Potter laughing yet? Or asking him what in the world was going on? He didn't even wear a bloody confused expression, he didn't look disapproving at all. What was up with that?
That wasn't hard to decide on, Harry noted. "Stay." He would have said 'do as you wish', but he knew that he would feel lonely and bored out of his mind if the other actually left. Not to mention he really could appreciate the company of this particular person. It wasn't like Malfoy hadn't expected that answer, but it did surprise him a bit. Potter seemed to like his company. Not that he didn't know that already, because he did. It was just weird to be reminded of it again.
At this point, the Slytherin noticed how he'd stopped shaking. His body seemed fine again, and his mind was a lot less chaotic than it'd been moments ago. He could function properly again, and most importantly, think properly again. He looked back at the black haired boy, frowning a little because he was thinking of what to do now. "Let's settle it for once and all then," he began, straightening up and fixing his robes. "From now on, we're not enemies anymore, but friends." He held out his hand for the other to shake it, to seal the deal. "I'll stop being a prat, but I'd like to ask you to convince your friends I'm not the living embodiment of Satan."
His breath hitched. Did he fuck up? Merlin's beard, he didn't show it, did he? Well, so much for keeping secrets. Harry scooted farther away from the blond, uneasiness oozing from him as he did. "I was just gonna say I would take you up on that," he murmured, trying not to let his voice waver. He tended to give in, yet he was not planning to do now.
Silence fell between them as the students around them silently muttered to one another. Harry felt his anger fly out the window as if someone just used Expelliarmus on it. "I mean… He's very busy… Very important…" Draco added to his previous words.
"What do you want, Malfoy?" Harry snarled without stopping in his tracks. "Honestly, I might just be bored," the other replied, probably actually being honest. Taking notice of that, Harry halted and turned with mixed feelings. "You what?"
Malfoy grinned and got onto the ice as well, slowly easing into the familiar feeling of skating again. "Then don't slip."
Harry bit down on his bottom lip. His fingers buried deep in messy hair, nails lightly scraping the other's scalp.
With a wave towards the door, he offered the blonde a smile. Honestly, he didn't want to be left alone in this place. Heck, it was not as if he would manage to even get a blink of sleep. Yet he didn't want to hold Malfoy here any longer. He had wasted more than enough of the guy's time by keeping him here with him. The company had him hooked, but he had to let his selfishness go. Malfoy had homework and sleep to catch up to as well. He couldn't help that Harry had nightmares after all.
"Where did that pillow go?" He shifted, rather searching for the soft bundle with his head in order not to lose the blankets again. Once he felt his hair pressing back against his scalp, he let his head fall on the supposed pillow in content. The pillow wasn't as soft as he had thought.
Harry couldn't help but smile at that. "Thanks Mal," he spoke in a hushed tone as if he were afraid for anyone else to hear him speak. "It means a lot." After a mere seconds, he decided to jump to his feet. Harry brushed the dust from his robes and scratched the back from his head.
Having the other boy actually realize that thought for him froze his body. There was no way this was really happening.
"Your friends will be here in a bit then," he said as he glanced one last time at the boy. He didn't know what else to say, so after that, he turned around and left to find the two other Gryffindors. He first went to the library, since that was the place where he'd seen them for the last time. Luckily they were indeed there, instead of in the Gryffindor tower. He wasn't entirely sure how to approach them, seeing as the only things he'd ever said to them were mean remarks, but as a Slytherin, he couldn't care less. They'd have to swallow it, and he did too.
Harry's mouth fell open, literally. Now, this was not alone a dangerous zone this was heading to, he was just so confused. "You…" He mumbled, at the loss of words. "You are actually willing to?" His eyes flew over the blonde's face in disbelieve, a deep frown edged on his face. Why would this even turn out this way? The last time was an accident, a little thing called a potion that made him act weird and Malfoy just had run out of enough energy to get rid of him.
After a while, the Slytherin noticed the other's breathing turning more shallow and steady, a sign he'd fallen asleep. Maybe he should try to do the same, there wasn't much else to do anyway and he was comfortable enough to do it. With a last glance at the Gryffindor's calm face, Draco nuzzled his head into the pillow and closed his eyes.
Draco merely gave him a confused look. "I meant helping you… not… doing it completely…" Had he been clear enough about that? Maybe not, but it was worth mentioning. He'd keep his word, which unlike his untrustworthy image, was part of his loyal personality.
Harry huffed at that reply. Wait for what, his heart to burst? Well, yes, wouldn't he just sleep peacefully then. Though he couldn't really do anything else, the other sounded quite drowsy already so it would be rude to keep him awake.
Draco simply watched the other walk around and busy himself. Was he trying to do everything on his own, all at once? Surely, he should know he could always ask someone to help him… He sighed and looked away again. If this was Potter's way of dealing with things, he wasn't going to stop him. The Gryffindor had always been chaotic anyway. A very endearing kind of chaotic.
It took a while before Draco got himself to answer. His mind was cloudy, divided between several thoughts that were taking up enormous space. Potter wanted to know why he was upset. Maybe it was best to tell him.
Draco found it hard to sympathize with people, but it wasn't hard to see that Potter was completely out of this world. He wasn't going to drink the potion in this condition either, which left Malfoy no other choice but to help him. He made his way to the bed and uncorked the small flask. "Could you please drink this, before you slip away any further?" Was he really doing this? Was he actually taking care of this guy? How did they end up like this…
Draco sat up a bit more, looked at the nurse's office, which was clearly empty, and scoffed. "Fuck Pomfrey. I need coffee, you need water, that's obviously not here, so let's just go." He really couldn't care about anything anymore at this point. He didn't care about Pomfrey, nor about what would happen if he and Harry entered the great hall like this. He'd cared too much about others already, right now he couldn't care less what people thought.
Harry's eyes flashed between the elves and Malfoy. His throat felt dry, yes, and he hadn't eaten yet. Yet he couldn't help but see Dobby in them. As one of the elves walked close enough with a plate, he signaled it kindly and asked for it, fortunately receiving it. He proceeded to grab himself a glass of water quickly before he left with the plate and glass in hand in kind of a hurry.
With a look behind him to the almost emptied glass, he let a smile decorate his face. "Aaannnd I might have to drink more if she is going to be willing to kick me out of here, I guess." After that declaration, he turned to get the glass from the little table to gulp down the last bit of liquid.
Draco merely gave him a confused look. "I meant helping you… not… doing it completely…" Had he been clear enough about that? Maybe not, but it was worth mentioning. He'd keep his word, which, unlike his untrustworthy image, was part of his loyal personality.
Malfoy shook his head to get rid of that thought and looked at the black haired girl next to him. "So, why have you been smiling like someone's about to make a really nasty, but entertaining fall?"
"It's surprising to see them both talk like this. I would want to know which year they are attending according to the story."
"So, we're still not allowed to ask where you go, but are expected to just welcome you back like this?" Zabini scoffed, clearly not okay with the fact that Malfoy was being so secretive. This was no surprise to Draco, Zabini had always been quickly irritated by being left out of something.
Against his will, he made sure to note that he had to wash the bundle of clothes before he grabbed something else to wear. He picked out a simple sweater from his closet and pulled the one he was wearing over his head. With a huff, he dropped it on the ground, next to his bed. He ruffled his hair with his hand, noticing the dust coming from it.
"Why are you saying no so quickly? You play wonderfully, it's a shame no one is ever allowed to listen to it."
He decided to end his little improvised speech there, where it would have the most impact. Blaise didn't seem as angry as before anymore, but absolutely not convinced yet either. Crabbe and Goyle did seem at least a bit convinced, this didn't surprise Draco, they'd always followed his lead and would probably accept most things he said anyway. And Pansy, well, she already knew about most of this. She seemed to be in thoughts, but not in a negative way. She'd clearly accepted Draco's words, even though she didn't show it that much.
Draco sniffed. "Oh, I'm sure they would have done a thing like that… And I would've went along with it…" He stopped for a moment. It was true, he had heard his parents talk about arranged marriages, he'd grown up thinking it was his destiny. He'd always thought he had to preserve his status, that it was a very good thing to marry someone from a wealthy, pureblood family. However, the war had changed this, as it had changed many things.
"Hi, Harry," he said. He'd decided to use the other's first name to show the others that everything was alright. Without any further explanation, he got down to his business, which would instantly tell the others that he was indeed part of this. "I've got a list of Slytherins that are willing to help with the decorations. The others have promised to help by bringing drinks and such."
Harry didn't know how to tell the other goodbye. It felt weird to just leave with a 'yeah see ya' but he had no idea how else to leave. Should he shake the other's hand in some bro-ish fashion or just lightly pat him on the shoulder? A hug was too intimate, wasn't it? He decided to just pat the other's shoulder.
I wish to inform you that unfortunately, the manor won't be suitable for celebrating Christmas this year.
With this thought stuck in his mind, he started making his way to the Slytherin dormitories. The library wasn't an option, it was too crowded with people that he didn't want to see.
Draco had gotten violin lessons since he was about 8. He'd always loved it when his parents hired musicians for their parties or dinners, so after a lot of pleading his mother had allowed him to pick an instrument to learn to play. She'd always thought it was very charming and had often watched him play. She, his father and Pansy were the only people who knew about it. It was one of the things Draco held close to himself, a good childhood memory that he shared with his mother. It was a fragile thing to him, and he was terrified that it would shatter if he wasn't careful enough.
After Ron and Hermione had left Harry had tried and failed, to fall back asleep. It made him frustrated. He was tired, but he couldn't help but think about what Ron had said. Malfoy had helped him while they had even failed to notice how bad he felt.
Hermione seemed to have trouble with the idea but started to nod slowly. "I see…" She might have talked calmly with them and let it sink in, eventually accept it as well, when Ron yelled from the entrance - seemingly unsure if he was allowed to walk away from there. "What do you mean, friends? That you helped him out with his trials was enough, don't you think? That guy helped Voldemort and his henchmen, Harry. Because of him people like Fred-"
There was a silence in which Harry was processing everything the other had just said before his eyes slowly widened, even more tears falling down.
Biting on his bottom lip, he desperately searched for an answer. Maybe he could act as if it was weird for the other to think like that by looking at the other weirdly. Ugh, why did he need to search for excuses anyway… Maybe he should just be honest after all. Put it down like the fact it was. Harry felt how his whole body seemed to protest against his decision, body tensing up and his heart almost seemed to clench. Beat around the bush.
Ron suddenly hissed. "Why is Malfoy looking over here like that?" Surprised Harry scanned through the students seated at the Slytherin table for the blonde boy. He found the boy seated next to Pansy Parkison, his eyes on Harry. "I don't know..." He mumbled.
"Not sure…" Harry looked at the lake. "I just thought Hermione might want to come out here as it has something peaceful about it. Plus there's an absence of people, as most students don't go outside in this weather."
Draco didn't get annoyed, angry or confused, he was just surprised. It didn't make sense for Potter to spend Christmas with him, or to be wanting it, but then again, in these circumstances maybe it did. He knew Pansy would be leaving. A lot of Slytherins did, actually. He'd have no one to hang out with during the holidays. Now he didn't depend on people that much, he would probably manage, but spending some time with Potter would still be nicer than being alone in the Slytherin common room all day.
A sigh left the black-haired boy's lips as he came to a halt, turning his head to spot white locks. "Malfoy." An eyebrow was raised at the sudden contact. "So he does understand English, marvelous." The boy remarked. Irritated at the sassy remark Harry rolled his eyes and continued on his way.
Ugh, why was it so hard to just formulate the right words? Why did his heart need to clench like that?
"Well, if you need something, water or someone to talk to, I'm here," she spoke before continued. To get that other student a potion probably.
He practically could see them connect the dots as their mouths slowly fell open and their eyes slightly widened. It was quite funny to see someone come to that 'Ooooooh' conclusion. It didn't take them long to figure out where he had actually gotten stuck and tried their best to patiently explain to him.
Oh, they were really testing his patience right now. How lucky they were that he'd grown up suppressing his signs of annoyance and anger. "As I said, he's not in his right mind. I didn't do anything. If it weren't for me, he'd be laying on the floor in this library right now. But he's your friend right? I don't care what you do with this information, believe it or not. Wouldn't hurt to take a look in the hospital wing, but if you insist on thinking I'm a liar, which I am absolutely not because I wouldn't lower myself to that level, I won't hold you back."
Malfoy ducked, but it still hit his shoulder. He instantly decided to take revenge for this and threw the snowball he was holding. As he did this, he set his foot back to get some more grip on the ice, but this resulted in an ominous cracking sound. He ignored it though, it had been able to bear him until now, which meant it should be able to do that for a while longer. He wasn't that heavy anyway, right?
He let out a deep breath as he shifted underneath the blankets and snuggled his head in his pillow. Such a cozy place. He drifted off soon enough with a content smile on his face as he thought about the things that happened that day. He had had quite a good day with the blonde Slytherin after all. There had been a few moments he had started to worry, like when the blond had almost fallen through the ice, yet he already deemed them fond memories.
Not sure what had gotten into him, he already started to list down things in his head. A bag of candy? Nah, Draco didn't seem like the guy to accept work for sweets. Maybe a muggle pen? It lasted longer than the ink of their feathers. But then again, he knew about the 'that is what she said' thing… There was no harm in trying though. He searched through his stuff in hope of finding one, looking almost victorious when he found one "What about this?"
It didn't take long for the tiny creatures to notice their presence. They seemed to recognize Potter, Draco guessed he'd been here a few times before.
Malfoy widened his eyes in a fake-offended scowl. "You will not, you prat," he scoffed. "You must have never properly watched me fly because if you had, you'd know I could easily beat you. Can't blame you with those glasses though."
Now that he'd finally told them what was going on, he felt more confident than before. Blaise had helped him see that even though not everyone would be able to forgive each other, Draco shouldn't let himself be held back by it. He had decided to start doing the right thing and would stick with it.
I can't tell you the reason for this inconvenience and hope you will understand that we are in no condition to celebrate Christmas as a family this year.
Even though he said that he vaguely pondered about the relationship between the members of the Malfoy household. Maybe he shouldn't have asked, it only seemed to make it worse. Though it might be better for the guy to let it out. Piling your feelings up takes its toll on your body. He let his grip on the guy's face go, looking around for any tissues as he figured crying made people all snotty as well.
"Mister Potter!" Harry wheezed as he heard the nurse ran after him, ignoring the weird glances of the students in the hall. He had no time for her potions, he had to finish that assignment and he wouldn't dare to miss out on the donuts. Like the message he had received, Ron and Hermione were in the great hall eating of the stack of donuts.
Harry flung his arm around the other and nuzzled into the other. His chest resting somewhere around the other's belly and chest. "You asked for it," he threw back, making himself comfortable. He paid no heed to the rapid beat of his heart. Deal with it.
Ignoring it, he turned around to get out of the room, but just before reaching the door, he turned around again.
If he told him, what would they do? It wasn't like they could just start dating. That was the only thing holding him back. No one would want a Malfoy to date their hero, it'd be a terrible combination and Draco would probably put Harry into a lot of trouble with it. It was simply out of the question, no matter how bad Draco wanted it.
He was so used to commanding them around and looking at them like they were simply moving furniture that shouldn't be noticed.
"Well, I never would've thought you would become keen on saving me. I guess I should risk my life more often then?" Draco grinned and dared to look over at the other for just a moment. He then resumed staring at anything but the Gryffindor. This is not the time for new feelings, don't start anything.
And there was Seamus Finnigan, running out from the back of the store and nearly colliding with Draco.
As you have probably noticed, the world has gone to shit. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if zombies sprung up and took over.
A knock at the front doors jolted him out of his daydream, head snapping to the door of the sitting room.
Because of course he was still in London, and of course, he'd defied everyone's expectations and opened a fucking potions shop, and of course, there was a sign on the door signalling a need for a brewer.
It was open and warm, with balloons huddled in corners and self-filling glasses on silver trays hovering in midair.
"I can do you against the table if you'd prefer, but I was thinking you could lie down all nice and pretty while I fuck you senseless."
Draco admired the Slytherin edge to her methods, but was utterly exhausted with her constant jibes. It was why he kept sending Harry to get the kids.
"He doesn't have his dad breathing down his neck to join a homicidal maniac, so I suppose that would change things."
"Harry," a voice came from amid the desks. Draco watched as Granger pushed her way through, clutching a stack of papers. "We've just had a report of an attack on a known lycanthropy safe-house. Are you free?"
"I did hear it, Ted. Watch the pan for me, okay? Don't touch it, just yell if it starts bubbling lots."
Hermione nodded, watching Harry's face. Draining the last of her tea, placing it gently on the table, she folded her hands together.
"Three years taught one working. In France. I can give you the address to contact them." Because who would hire him without checking?
Harry sighed, watching from the doorway. He'd somehow managed to spill his bowl of noodles all over himself, making everything he was wearing stink of garlic.
Now it was all on him. The four of them were normally really good at not asking Harry about his life, but the storm seemed to have changed their mind.
"I don't know, but you're not allowed to panic, because then I'll panic. It went away every time the last few days, so it'll go away again today."
It was the fifth day, Draco was exhausted beyond belief, but Harry was still as hard and insistent as he had been before.
No. No, that didn't sound very good at all. Not the day after the full moon. Not to mention his house arrest...
"I don't," he replies, carefully unpacking the bag. "It's a house of Black, so Black blood can always enter. Although I did ask permission."
Before he could argue, Potter silenced him with a kiss, parting his lips and playing with him until Draco had to force him away for breath.
"Not impossible," Draco intercepts. He knows this. His father told him stories when he was younger. "It's been nearly 500 years since the last wizard birthed a child, but it is possible. Back in the times when our numbers were just a few thousand, every birth was crucial. Powerful wizards - pureblood wizards - could have a child if their magic was strong enough to sustain a second life."
Harry turned to see Teddy wearing a jumper he could have sworn he'd lost last year. He's only managed to get one arm in, the other rucked up around his neck, still very naked underneath. He had two pairs of trousers in his hands, dragging them behind him
Draco had growled, low and deep in his throat, pulling Potter to him by his robes and ripping them in an attempt to get to his belt.
"You look like my grandmother's family, you do! She has this massive photo book," Teddy stretches his arms out, overestimating the size, "and loads of people in it have hair like yours!"
After four whiskeys, two ciders and an hour of Draco's - yes, at some point he became Draco - wonderfully crass jokes, he'd decided he didn't give a fuck what anyone else thought.
Shoulders back - not like you're in the army, Potter, just stop slouching - hip against his desk, arms in front of him. He stuffed his hands into his pockets, fingering his phone and the condoms he brought. Just in case.
Jo simply smiled at Maria, turning the box upside down and pouring her secret stash all over Harry's desk.
"He's sweet. He tries not to talk about the war because it makes him cry. Merlin, he won't wear short sleeves around Teddy because he doesn't want him to see the Dark Mark. He's trying to rebuild his life. He built one in the muggle world, but now he's having to learn how to build one around magic, too. Same as me. The only connection I have to magic is Teddy coming over every now and then."
Draco feels Potter breathing against his neck, forearms holding him barely above Draco's back. Draco breathes in again, scenting the new space. It's all new carpets and fresh wood. And Potter.
He can see a tiny bit of the old fury rise in Malfoy before he's out the door, taking the steps and hoping Malfoy's following.
"Yeah, unbelievable." Harry was grinning. Ron was trying to follow Rose with his eyes while Jenna talked to him. Rose, who was wearing a bright blue dress, hair tied back with a matching headband, and trying to piggy-back ride another girl up the climbing wall.
He looked down at himself, checking his pyjama pants and T-shirt were somewhat decent, before opening the door wider.
"Never leaving you, Draco." He'd promised, still rocking inside his Omega. "Gonna look after you. Gonna look after Scorpius. Our little family."
They had a simple routine that week - fuck until you pass out, an hour in the morning for other necessities, then right back into bed.
"Harry," Ron suddenly chirped up, watching the pair uncertainly. "How are you getting on with Malfoy?"
She must have guessed who the other one was as well, since she never asked, never mentioned his name. On the few times he visited, she came up with excuses of illness, decorating or trips out, closing the door in his face.
Harry hadn’t mentioned it when he ran away for a week, nothing but a note saying he needed some time, then he and Scorpius were gone.
"No, his is different. But he- well he gets violent when that need is denied. That's why I think it's best he spends his full moons and the week after in one of our safe houses, just to make sure nothing bad happens."
But they were grinning, and in love. The wedding was booked for the middle of winter - Draco refused to tell Harry why just yet.
"Granger," he greeted, nodding. He knew she may not like him, but if he got a job in the potions lab, he might very well be on neutral terms with her.
"Draco," the sound sent shivers down his spine, "stop playing hard to get. You're already having my baby."
The man behind the door looked at it, looked between Harry and Malfoy, then handed the card back and opened the door wider.
"Draco's really nice!" Teddy piped up, dragging Victoire towards the blond on the floor. "He's funny, and he likes my drawings, and he thinks mint ice cream is the best! But we don't hold that against him. It's not his fault he doesn't know how good chocolate is."
It had been far too long since Harry had dated someone - even longer since he'd had the confidence for a one night stand - and the idea of the blond was getting his blood boiling.
Draco pulled on Potter's hips, bringing his cock close enough that he could wrap his lips around the head.
"Babysitting for children under two can be very expensive, especially in London. I've met people who were charged £500 a week for childcare. A lot of people can't afford that. Since we look after a lot of kids at once, we can afford to keep prices low. Plus we do price planned and annual payment discounts."
"Jenna was kind enough to tell me roughly where you lived. I came here as a child when Mother's family still lived here. None of your charms can hide it from a Black, you know."
Too caught up in the intimacy of the act, Draco had pushed himself back onto the waiting cock, stretching his neck out to give better access.
A few days later, when Draco had finally managed to cast the spell correctly, a blinding white light had erupted from his wand.
"Well, we've decided to offer a gesture of goodwill. After everything you did, I wanted to give these back to you." Potter reached into a pocket of his robes, pulling two wands out, and placing them on the coffee table between them. "I know it's not much, but I've cleared it that you can use your wands from now on. We will be monitoring the use, but when we take the wards off the grounds, we'll do the same for your wands."
The first person Harry saw was a very harried Ron, carrying a baby in one arm and holding the hand of a small child with the other. He was stooped awkwardly to reach her, fussing the baby, but it was definitely Ron.
It was crazy. Absolutely fucking crazy. No sane person could possibly want something as depraved as this.
"Turn around for me?" Potter asked, kissing just behind Draco's ear. Merlin, he wished he didn't want to.
"What the fuck did you expect? Did you think you'd just stand there and I'd magically be able to blow you? I can hardly move like this, so you're going to have to do all the hard work."
The mark had faded to nothing more than a scar, but Draco could still see it. Trace the outline of it with his fingers. Feel the little dips where Fenrir Greyback's teeth had ripped into him.
Draco wishes he had the strength to punch Potter, but somehow the knowledge that his body had done this before reassured him - brought him down from a dangerous place and let him be peaceful.
"Well, would you like to-" Harry pointed at the bowls on the table, unsure how to go about asking Draco so sit at such a small table with him again.
"No, it didn't. But we did take a while in the restaurant, and you insisted we walk the whole way back."
Draco stilled as he felt Potter's hands on the swell of his stomach, anger coursing through his veins and spilling from his eyes.
Which is why he startled when he felt Harry's presence in the room, his scent thick in the small room.
"Not to mention your friends have found a way to blow up the potions." Draco muttered, unprepared for the roar of laughter behind him.
"It's brilliant! Not as big as Harry's wall, but it's big. It's nearly full already, but Grandma won't let me put my drawings on another wall. It's really unfair-"
"Cold coffee? Intentionally cold coffee? Potter, you are absolutely disgusting." Draco wrinkled his nose, bringing his own drink to his lips.
"How are you doing in here? I know the place is a bit of a mess, but we've been too short-staffed to clean things up."
It wasn’t that Draco didn’t want to get married. His skin hummed every time he thought about it – all his worlds aligning to perfection. But it wasn’t something he was prepared for.
"How about I pay for any extra drinks we get since you've beaten me to dinner?" At Malfoy's nod, Harry calls over a waitress. "Could we get two straight whiskeys - doubles, please - a pear cider and - Dray, what bottle of wine did you want?"
Draco didn't let Harry consider stopping any longer, dragging him down to a bruising kiss as he raised his hips to meet Harry's.
Harry pulled him into another hug, pulling Draco’s head into his chest and forcing calm over their Mark.
“Want some ice cream?” Harry asked when dinner was finished, pulling a tub of Ben and Jerry’s out of seemingly nowhere.
The figure didn't speak, instead, it was treading carefully as it walked around Draco's back to look at the potions.
"Draco, Dear, let him have some." His mother had appeared from the direction of the kitchens, carrying a pot of coffee. "Come eat your breakfast Dear."
Settled in the kitchen a few minutes later, Harry brewing tea in his pyjama pants and a newly-found jumper, Hugo sat in a transfigured high-chair with a bowl of mushy peas in front of him, Hermione started her interrogation.
Potter cast a glance at Draco, brows knitting together. "No, I'm not. I think Ron and the recruits are in the office, they should be able to help."
Ron was still watching Rose, frowning as she clambered into a plastic chair and held her hands out for a plate.
Draco turned from his potion, pushing a stray hair out of his eyes. She was another one who kept getting pissy with him.
It wasn't what Hardy was expecting. Then again, he was starting to realise that the only thing he could trust about today was it wouldn't be going the way he was expecting.
"I don't want you to get hurt. I saw how you were after the war, and after Ginny ended things. It broke you."
"Well, do you remember all the things he did? The way he treated us at school? He nearly got you killed."
It had been the first daycare Harry could find, a ten-minute walk from home, and they'd been more than happy to take the giggling boy for an afternoon.
Draco was watching him - he could feel it. He was having a lazy day, and that meant he wasn't wearing any of the new, stupidly tight jeans he'd impulse-purchased before his date with Draco.
"We?" Draco spits, punching Potter in the shoulder. He stumbled back, giving Draco the space to stand up. "All I remember is my fucking wolf taking over my brain the second it saw you. You knew what happened and you still went to the safe house. Did you enjoy taking advantage of me that much?"
"I'll tell you what, Harry," Hermione said, pulling a chair up beside Harry's armchair. "I'm so glad he's so clingy with the children. I don't think I'd have had a wink of sleep if not."
He tried not to think about it too often. He figured it was a dangerous road to go down, wondering how all his friends were.
Really, why was he even going out of his way to help this guy? He'd already taken more care of him than he'd ever done for anyone else. And it didn't even bother him, it actually felt kind of good to see the other smiling again instead of nearly fainting. Maybe it was because he still felt guilty about the things he'd done. Maybe he did this as an apology, or maybe it was merely a selfish act to get rid of his guilt. Or maybe it was because he understood what the other was going through. Because he knew how terrible the mere thought of Voldemort could be, and what it could do to people.
"Um, Harry? Are you alright?" Hermione asked carefully, stopped in her rant by the boy suddenly letting his head meet the table. Harry let out a deep breath. "Yeah. Just… tired. Lack of sleep." Ron snorted at that, knowing fully well his friend had gone to bed early last night yet had woken up a few times in cold sweat. Luckily he didn't mention that. Hermione looked at him for a while before she tried to scoot closer. "Harry. Are you sure you're okay? People don't look pale just from a little lack of energy." Harry sighed once again - god he has been doing that an awful lot lately, didn't he? "I'm fine. Just tired and a bit dizzy. Got a lot on my head."
Luna Lovegood had shown up, along with Neville and his grandmother, who had sat with Andromeda and Narcissa and talked about any topic other than Harry.
Three days after his next transformation, Draco floo'd one of the medical witches, asking her to come to the safe house.
"Well then, I'll give you these." She taps a stack of parchments and books, balancing on an empty stool. "And I want you to track everything. Everything. What you eat, any exercise, any sexual activity-" Draco splutters, completely ignored by the witch, "- and of course the measurements around your waist. Any changes in emotions, any changes to your transformations. If it's not normal, I want it written down."
The slick feeling was back, running out of him, into his underwear. Thick, wonderous fingers followed the sensation, dipping through the slick and rubbing at Draco's hole.
There was the suspicious pack that George had left when he helped them move in, but they still weren’t certain if they would turn into canaries eating them.
Somehow, just beneath the surface of his skin, a crackling fire lit up with every push of Potter's hips.
He did. He had no choice. Every inch of him was begging for this man to wreck him. Every instinct crooning at the gentle touches to his stomach, the tongue lavishing over the wound on his neck.
"Morning, Hermione." It still sounded weird. "I was just being a wonderful person, bringing this idiot a lovely, cold coffee."
Perfectly white shirt, tucked into sinfully tight black slacks, covered in a dark grey waistcoat, long black overcoat carefully folded over one arm. Harry could swear he nearly started salivating when he turned to footsteps on the stairs, seeing just how perky and round his arse was.
His trousers worked their way down to his ankles, Potter pulled away to remove his glasses, then he was back.
"Narcissa, I know you love him. That's obvious. But he needs to be somewhere he can't accidentally hurt you. We have specialists who can check on him - they're all excellent at defensive magic, so he couldn't hurt them if he tried. It should settle down over a few months, but for now, we can't know how or when it will happen."
He'd spent an unusual amount of time reading magazines and books all about this - about getting off in every conceivable way - and getting his mouth fucked had sent Draco down a rabbit hole of exploration and masturbation.
He wasn't even dressed properly! The T-shirt he'd slept in and a pair of comfy pyjama bottoms hardly constituted proper dress.
Draco yelped, nails digging into Potter's shoulders as he was pulled closer. Potter descended to sniff at the crook of his neck, trailing soft kissed up to his ear.
Draco screamed as Potter's teeth dug into the crook of his neck, clamping down and sucking as his hips started to move.
"There's a private one hidden just round here," Potter answers, steering him out of the office and through thin, twisting halls. "Safespace."
Harry did his best to copy Malfoy's action; raising a single eyebrow. He was certain he was doing it wrong, but Malfoy didn't seem to care.
He moved, pulling back to stare into Draco's eyes. "Draco, I definitely didn't tie you up the first time. Or for the last few months. You couldn't have stopped this."
The kitchen was open, waist-high windows letting you see in. Watching them work, Harry already knew he'd be treating himself this evening.
Potter was at the breakfast table, a piece of toast on his plate, drinking tea out of Draco's favourite mug.
"I get it, I just- All I remember about him is pain. Every joke, every hex, every time I got punished for something he did. And that was just from before the war. The things that happened... I can't get over it."
Merlin's saggy tits, his bite hurt. Every inch of him ached, pain curling in the pit of his stomach.
Harry cracks a smile, shooting a glance at Jenna. His boss takes it well, shaking her head and telling the newest member of the team to fuck off.
"I've already heard it all from Sophie." Harry waved a hand towards the door, where the shrieks of the first children could be heard. "Go on, off to work with you."
"Yeah, somewhere a werewolf can go when they have nowhere else. Please, let me get you to one of them."
"He's even managed to get it on the ceiling," Draco murmured, head tilted to see the distinct green spot amid the cream ceiling.
"So fucking good," he whispers, lips meeting Draco's neck, hand coming to tug at his cock. "So fucking sweet."
“Last I saw him, Luna was trying to convince him to take this weird baby necklace thing. It keeps away one thing or another.”
Harry let himself be pulled into a hug before Andromeda instructed him to sit. She sat on a long, sleek sofa, indicating beside herself. Harry hovered next to an armchair instead.
“Draco, this is the first time since Lily was born that we’ve had a night to ourselves. And that was two fucking years ago. Maybe you could look a little more… emotional?”
"No, that's not the exciting part." The medical witch continued, rushing to the other side of Draco's work station. More brewers moved in beside him, crowding his station to hear the news. "We think it could make it possible for male births."
But he recognised the twist in his gut, right where Harry's child was growing, and knew everything would work out.
"The conversation a few weeks ago - male pregnancy - it got me thinking. I'm - well, I'm a candidate. We can see if it's possible with me. I'm pureblood, I have lycanthropy, and I've not long passed my third year."
It wasn't like he had much to take. New charms had been put on Number 12, so even those who'd been there in the war couldn't find it, and Harry was quite content living a muggle life.
"Sophie, sweetheart. I love your enthusiasm for entertaining the little demons, but if you give them my sherbert I will make you regret it."
"One of those is where you'd work, the potions lab. They mostly make Wolfsbane, but they're working on some other things, too. I'll admit not much makes sense to me, but they're trying to make transformations easier and less painful. I'm sure they'll explain it to you."
He watched as the colour rose once again on Malfoy's cheeks, this time extended all the way down his neck.
He'd been sat in Potter's office ever since, curled over and whimpering in pain. Not from the itching or the cramping in his gut. No, he was in pain because he was hard - had been for well over an hour now - and he couldn't explain it.
"I mean, I drank a lot. Four whiskeys." Jenna's jaw dropped even further, and even Maria was looking interested now. "We went back to his place, and he told me to wait on his bed while he- well, I sat down, and-"
“Piss off,” he said, even as he doused the fires and leaned into Harry’s touch. Harry’s mouth was on him, fluttering down his neck, ghosting over the back of his shirt.
"You're also letting your coffee get cold," Draco called, laughing as Harry turned a startling shade of red.
Draco could feel it - feel some tiny part of him clenched around the head of Potter's cock, holding him there.
Draco's mouth moved against his own, slow and sweet. Draco's hands stayed on Harry's collar, thumbs rubbing in slow circles over the leather. Harry pushed forward, giving Draco's bottom lip a quick lick, grinning into the kiss when Draco returned the motion. Biting and licking at Harry's lips, tongue pushing inside, Draco moaned into Harry's mouth.
"How about we go check on Ron?" Harry asks Hermione, grinning when Draco scowls at him. He quickly grabs Hermione by the arm and escapes while Maria starts running her hands through Draco's hair.
"We'll get her a snack in a little bit," Harry assured, grabbing Ron's arm before he could move for the girl. "We do snacks at ten. She'll get used to the schedule."
Narcissa had noticed him and scowled, lips pursed together. Draco looked up, brushing ash off his waistcoat, catching Harry's eye.
Jenna turned her back to Sophie, glaring at the window. She probably blamed the storm for ruining her plans.
"That's the last call," Maria announces, putting the phone down and reclining in her chair. "Everyone's happy we're not open today, obvious reasons, and they know we're not opening tomorrow. We'll call again Sunday if we're going to be shut next week. Happy?"
Stood on trial and told everyone what had happened - what they'd been made to do. His mother had offered up memories of meetings, of begging for her son to be spared the torture of joining.
Draco was looking at him again. On his feet, facing Harry. He looked down at the collar in his hands. Up at Harry. Down at the collar again.
"Do you live in London?" Harry asks, needing to at least get his footing. He can only imagine what Malfoy could have learned from Jenna and her sister. He feels left out.
The place looked beautiful. Chandeliers burned overhead, casting the restaurant in a warm glow. Every table was for two, with a candle in the middle, a rose laid with the cutlery, and starry-eyed lovers talking and laughing together.
A hostess came forward, speaking to Malfoy in hushed voices before they were being led through the restaurant.
Potter grinned down at him - wide and dangerous and hungry - as he moved around the table to push at Draco's thighs.
He'd meant to spit the words at him, but his voice was rough and sleepy, and he was rather worried it came out sounding fond.
It had all spun Draco's mind, giving him an awful headache and prompting him to nap for the rest of the afternoon.
Not only had he made Potter’s life hell for the last three years, pheremones-be-damned, but he had staunchly held out on an actual wedding.
"Here you go," the waitress said, placing two plates in front of them. Tiramisu for Draco, chocolate and caramel lava cake for Harry. "Any more drinks?"
He refuses to accept that maybe - just maybe - Potter had managed to get him pregnant. The first wizarding pregnancy in 500 years and the poor bastard has to have Potter for a parent.
For the first time, he feels it - feels the building pleasure every time Potter rocks into him, the lightning shooting through his skin wherever Potter touches. The sound of Potter breathy moans, crooning in his ear, whispering filthy encouragements with every stroke.
Harry glanced down quickly, realising he was wearing the cashmere jumper Draco had left a few weeks ago, before looking back up at him.
The wizarding world wasn't nearly as close to accepting people like the muggle world was. Not to mention he didn't have anyone writing newspaper articles about his love life anymore.
Draco probably thought otherwise, but Harry didn't mind. He was thoroughly drunk, leaning against Draco in their tiny booth. He'd been breathing in the smell of his shampoo - lemons, or something of that sort - for the last five minutes, and he was determined not to move.
"Merlin," he whispered when Harry's hands reached up, undoing the clasp of the collar and carefully holding his wrists. He closed his eyes, hoping Draco would take the initiative to put the collar on him.
After the war, when all the trials had finished and Harry didn't have to attend any more official ceremonies, he disappeared. Left a letter on Kingsley's desk, informing him he was officially leaving the magical world and vanished.
“I don’t want to wait,” Draco decides, gripping Harry’s biceps. “But everyone’s making it this big thing, and I don’t know if I want that.”
"The medics think it's something to do with the wolf part of the anatomy. After a certain period of time - they think it's about two or three years - it starts to change. Instead of only coming to the mind at the full moon, it stays alive for a week or so afterwards. We've spoken to some people who were bitten when they were kids, or just a long time ago, and they say it takes over in a different way a week after the full moon."
He'd defied expectations by raising his son alone. Now he aimed to beat that expectation again by becoming a potions master.
"A blind date," Harry says, smiling a little when Hermione chokes on her tea. "My boss, Jenna. She set it up with her sister. He took me to dinner, and it went really well. He's come over a few times since then. We- I don't know if it's actually a thing, but I want to make it work with him."
Teddy grabbed Draco by the hand, dragging him towards the stairs. Harry picked up the trousers Teddy had dropped, handing them to Draco as he passed.
“Maybe I could tempt you with a different kind of dessert?” Harry offered, letting his pheremones loose.
Everything crashes around him, sending him toppling over the edge of an unseen waterfall, crying out as it plunges him under the water.
He tried to speak, to tell him there was no part of him that wanted anything other than to be his, but he couldn't. Because Harry was sat there in all his glory, staring down at him, and for the first time in his life he wanted nothing but to submit.
"I'll take that as a no. We can fix that," she insists. Harry noticed the other girls all lifted their heads, nodding enthusiastically.
"And you're gay?" That's the part Harry really couldn't believe. Or maybe he could. It was difficult to figure Malfoy out.
"Want you," he heard just before the blond screamed. He'd wanted to be gentle, but he needed to be inside him too badly for kindness.
That strange slick sensation was there, too. On those odd occasions when he let himself wrap a hand around his cock it came, rushing out of him, begging him to push his fingers inside. It was glorious, letting him get four fingers inside with no sign of pain. He couldn't reach the part that lit his nerve endings on fire, but a bit of experimentation sorted that out.
"I've always wanted this," he admitted. It had been difficult, fighting with Harry so often when all he wanted to do was make him his promised Alpha. "Always wanted to be yours. France made me realise that."
Draco swore, squeezing Harry's thigh, and Harry decided he'd do anything to get that sensation again.
"My sister works with someone your type," Jenna continues, finally choosing a sherbet dip lolly. "Tall, blond, fit as hell. Once, when they went out for drinks, he said he likes a man on the broader side, who doesn't mind being fucked into a mattress."
Shaved short on the sides, Sophie's hair-spray pulling the curls on top into what she described a 'fashionable flick.'
Draco ignored them. He was nearly finished with a new nausea potion, and he wasn't going to let his mother distract him from it.
Andromeda frowned at him, shaking her head slightly. "They were awful. When I was putting Remus and Tonks into the memorial editions, they tried labelling him 'Remus Lupin, the werewolf'. Very small-minded."
"You back?" Potter asks, hands squeezing Draco's hips. He's grinning, wide and toothy, eyes blown wide.
"I'm surprised you came, if I'm honest," Andromeda confided, not clarifying if she meant her sister or Harry. "Both of you, one in France, one in the muggle world. You don't even keep your floo open."
It was quiet. Aside from the house-elves leaving him tea and sandwiches, he was left alone in his tiny lab. Even his mother knew better than to disturb him.
"Stop," Harry held a hand up, surprised when Teddy actually stopped in front of him. "Ted, you're making me look bad. I've gone to all this effort," he waved a hand at the first pair of jeans and jumper he'd seen, "and you're going the easy route with no clothes? Come on, I haven't seen anyone here in years, and you're already making me look bad."
"Where are you taking me, Potter?" Draco asked, suddenly worried he'd been walked straight into a trap.
Harry wasn't sure what Malfoy meant by discreet, but an image of collars and leather trousers came to mind.
Draco had wanted some peace and quiet. He’d wanted to go back to that simple time, just after he met Harry, when he could forget all the wrongs.
"What?" Draco asks, lifting his safety goggles to take a good look at her. She was young - probably the same age as Draco - waving around a small slip of parchment.
When Harry asked them to move in, the only thing that stopped Draco from agreeing immediately was Scorpius. If he wasn't happy, Draco simply wouldn't let himself.
Draco vaguely feels himself nodding, wondering if he could get away with disappearing. He won't be able to hide it forever.
"I'm not stupid. And it probably will happen, with you like this." He didn't mind. Hell, he wanted it.
Dropping the keys on Harry's desk as she went, casting what Harry knew was a 'if you were into girls I would totally fuck you' look at Malfoy, then left them alone in the office.
"What are you doing here, Ron?" Harry asked, trying to stand up straight. A fourth child flung themselves onto his back, weighing him down.
"Harry! Harry come up here!" They heard, faint through the floorboards. Smiling, Harry jerked his head towards the stairs.
Those first few months had been horrendous – everyone he met asking how soon it was happening, what plans he had, whether he’d follow Malfoy or Black traditions.
Harry put a hand on his arm, stopping him from chasing Rose. "It's good to let them have a little independence. Come on, let's talk."
"What did you do?" Narcissa asked, staring at the boy. He'd climbed onto the sofa between them, turning his face Into Andromeda's side.
Balancing Scorpius on his hip while he wrestled with the door, Draco managed to get out of the street just as something in the back of the shop exploded.
"This is a lovely little place," Hermione commented, peering round at the place. "I see you have a staff wanted poster in the window."
"I need to know right this second, Draco. Is this you, or is this the heat? Or my rut? I need to know before we move forward." But Harry was already shaking with need, and Draco could feel where his trousers were wet with slick.
If only it had been a day of talking about Potter's failure of a dating life. No, his itching had left his clawing skin from his arms, his stomach felt like it was burning, and he'd nearly fainted just after he'd finished his lunch.
"I think it's a brilliant idea," Potter replied. He was looking up at Draco, grinning, when he added, "sit on the table for me?"
Malfoy's eyes snap up to his, a blush rising on his cheeks. Harry decides he likes that look on Malfoy, a moment before he realises he likes looking at Malfoy.
"Draco has a point," another witch adds. "If any of us had bet on lycanthropy making male pregnancy possible, we'd have been able to afford Malfoy Manor."
Potter struck gold, hitting that perfect spot so hard Draco went toppling over the edge in a heartbeat.
Draco did his best to ignore the stares and whispers. Not just for himself, but for Scorpius. For his son.
His breath hitched, a spark of fear racing down his spine. Without thinking his hand went to his stomach - barely swollen over the last 5 months, but its there. It's obvious.
"I suppose we should go to our dinner reservation," Malfoy says, leading the way down the street. "I left time before dinner for us to have a few drinks, so we can talk."
"They didn't. Think about it, Hermione. Sirius had this place under the fidelius charm since the first war, so they couldn't come here. Narcissa didn't know where Andromeda was, or how to get in touch with her since she'd been thrown out. The only family she had left was Bellatrix. She had to do what protected Draco."
Nothing seemed certain anymore. The only thing about that world that was certain was that if Harry had stayed, he wouldn't be getting ready for a date with a handsome blond. Well, certainly not a male one.
The date was on. A tall, handsome blond was going to pick him up from work on Wednesday - precisely six-fifteen, Jenna had assured - and he wanted to make a good impression.
"Not as unlikely as lycanthropy triggering male pregnancy," Draco chips in, pushing someone to the side to grab the tray of wolfsbane.
"You would have gotten them back next month anyway, but I thought you'd like them back as soon as possible. I also have this for Draco."
Next came Hermione, bushy hair pulled back on top of her head, debating something or other with Ginny. Behind was Molly, complaining about how her 'good for nothing son still refused to get a girlfriend'. Arthur was nodding solemnly followed by Charlie and George, copying the motion through their grins. It wasn't until Bill and Fleur came through with two young girls that Harry was finally noticed.
"Very original, Potter. Lord help you, because I'm certainly not holding your hand through this. Draco, Harry. Harry, Draco. Be a dear and lock up, would you? Kay owes me a drink."
They were on the sofa, Draco's face pushed into the back cushions, his gut twisting with each tiny bump of Potter's hips.
Sophie whistled, long and low, resting her head back. She was almost completely submerged in the pit, light brown hair fanning out around her.
"What we did to him?" For a moment, Harry couldn't help think she sounded like McGonagall. "Harry, what did we possibly do?"
“Brilliant,” Ginny said, heavy foosteps moving around the brewing room, searching the shelves and draws.
Scorpius loved having a family – he’d settled into sharing a room with little Teddy, and never stopped talking about how he was a big brother, and his dad was getting married.
"First, you'll have to be lucky enough to find a gay male wizard inflicted with lycanthropy in an active sexual relationship, where both wizards are powerful enough to make pregnancy possible."
"Fine," Harry grumbled, face lighting up when he cut into his chocolate cake and found caramel sauce pouring out.
Andromeda and Narcissa both raised an eyebrow, and Harry suddenly realised Draco got most of his expressions from the Blacks.
"Call you an idiot and try to cover your arse again. Come on, let's get you down the Ministry. Lots of people want to meet you."
