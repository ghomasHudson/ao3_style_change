Harry sighed. "Yeah, yeah. I just said that I'm going to talk to her later. When I get the time to do that." He was starting to get annoyed by his friends interfering in his love life all the time.
Malfoy, however, was already getting up. He clearly had no interest to stay with them anymore. Without a word or a glance he quickly exited the whole library. Harry thought it was a little weird, since Malfoy probably had initially had a reason to visit the library, before seeing him and deciding to confront him.
Draco, however, had not finished talking yet. "Don't baby me", he said, detaching himself from Harry and took one step backwards, crossing his arms. The Prophet dropped to the floor. Harry was watching him with a melancholy look on his face. "You took me for granted for weeks, Harry! You will never treat me like that again because of work, or anything else either.
"What?" he asked.
"I'd love it, but I don't think it's a good idea", Harry finally said. "The bed is kind of small - and I share the room with your brother."
, Harry?! After everything? I trusted you, and you...
Harry felt a lump in his throat. "So you were... horny... and I just happened to be there..."
Once again he glanced to his right side, seeing Malfoy still walking beside him with a slightly amused smile on his lips.
Harry kept glancing at Malfoy, who was walking beside him. Malfoy's hair was still well set but his cheeks were slightly red because of the alcohol, and his breath was creating small, misty clouds in the chilly night air as they talked. Harry tried to concentrate on walking but he just couldn't keep his eyes off the other man.
He was running his hands all over the Slytherin's beautiful, warm body, loving the feeling of it against him. So graceful, so perfect... Malfoy moaned in his mouth and his fingers were running through Harry's messy hair, and Harry could feel the desperation, the yearning,
"I know", Harry said with a sigh. "But if they won't accept us together, they're not my real friends, right?"
Draco really tried his best not to think about anything she had told him that day, and in the end he forgot the whole thing.
Draco kept turning in the sheets, glancing at the clock on the wall and waiting as the hours passed. Where the hell could Harry be?! Harry hadn't even informed that he would be working late that night, so Draco had no idea of Harry's location.
"Yeah", Harry admitted. "I would have never imagined that someday I'd have Draco Malfoy under my invisibility cloak with me."
Harry Potter was madly in love with Draco Malfoy, and later today he was going to ask the other man to be his boyfriend.
"Potter. What are you doing?!"
"What?" Harry asked, taken aback by Malfoy’s words. "Are they calling you...?"
"Actually, I think that Ron is taking this even too well. He's drank way too much", she chuckled.
"Kind of, yeah", Harry said. "I don't feel any grudge towards him anymore and… I guess I'd really… want us to be friends." He felt bad for lying to Hermione, but he had to lie. Hermione wouldn't understand… Not when he was still with Ginny…
The almost fully seated hall, decorated with silver and emerald green colors, was full of blabbering. Harry Potter, dressed in black dress robes and an emerald green bow tie, was standing at the other end of the hall, nervously fiddling with his fingers, waiting.
"I... uhh..." Malfoy seemed to ponder it for a while. "Let's do it", he finally sighed.
"Right. We'll do that", Hermione said with a happy smile.
him?" Harry blurted out, regretting it the moment the words left his mouth. He was seriously starting to get angry at himself. What the hell was wrong with him today?!
Harry turned to look at the Slytherin table where the star of his dreams was resting his face against his palm, listening to his friends, a diabolic grin on his pale face.
Draco was left speechless. He slowly pulled his hand away and kept staring at Harry's back with an empty gaze. He had never felt more mortified in his whole life. He couldn't believe what had just happened. Harry Potter, the man who
Malfoy looked mortified. "I would
"I do", Draco said without any hesitation, and they both smiled at each other with tears in their eyes.
I've been there for him for years! I've been by his side when he's needed to talk to someone or a shoulder to cry on. I've always been there and I would have given him
Why not." He flashed a tiny smile at Harry. "If we're still together then, that is. You never know what will happen when you think about our history..."
"Me neither", Harry said.
"Be careful not to pass out though", he suddenly heard Malfoy's already quite drunken voice whispering right next to his ear and he startled, the hair on his neck rising up. He quickly opened his eyes and turned to look at his side, realizing that while he had been resting his eyes, the Slytherin had stood up and was now crouching down right next to him.
He could see Draco eyeing them closely.
do it?!"
the man who he had hated for years. Malfoy who wasn't even gay?! And what about all his other thoughts about Malfoy tonight? He was
Draco let out a scornful snort, finally pushing Harry away from him. "Cut the crap! You would only be glad to get rid of me!"
"Hey...", Greg breathed, completely taken aback, before quickly wrapping his arms around his friend. "What is it?"
"Ron! Calm down!" Hermione said strictly, but Ron didn't pay any attention to his girlfriend.
", she stated, shaking her head. "I can't believe this!!!"
Malfoy sneered. "I know. Never imagined we'd manage to get along someday."
This time he was alone with Draco.
"Hey, what the heck are you laughing at?!" he asked, finally turning around, feeling both a bit amused and irritated at the same time.
to get your attention."
Malfoy was biting his lip, trying to calm down. Finally he shook his head. "No, I'm not", he whispered.
The problem was that he didn't get a chance to talk to the Slytherin. Malfoy did come to meals and Harry did see him at their common room too, but there were always so many other people around that he couldn't talk about last night. Harry tried to give Malfoy some signals but it didn't work either: Malfoy seemed to be avoiding any possible eye contact with him that day.
To his surprise, he didn't get pushed away. No, instead of pushing Harry away Malfoy hang onto him, holding him tight, his fingers almost crushing Harry's back, and at the same time Malfoy's face was resting against his shoulder and Harry could feel shivers running through his body as he felt the warm breath against his skin. He moved his right hand to the blond hair, stroking it gently with his fingers. He loved the feeling of it in his hands. So light, so silky… just like he had imagined.
After Harry returned home he started to prepare them dinner in the kitchen and Draco surprised Harry by participating as well. Well, actually the Slytherin just stood close to Harry and watched attentively what he was doing at the time.
"Nothing", Harry hurried to say, forcing a silly smile to his face. "I was just caught up thinking how lucky I am."
He heard Ginny's voice in his head.
"Find out what?!"
"Because I didn't know how to tell", Harry answered. "I haven't even left Ginny yet. I think it's better to do that first. Take care of one thing at a time."
Malfoy was sitting under a tree near the lake when Harry arrived. The Slytherin seemed to be lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance.
"Gosh… Shut the fuck up, Potter, and just hold me", he heard Malfoy's very drunken voice hiss against his shirt, making Harry smile. Still the very same old Draco Malfoy.
"There was a big... god damn it, just take a look at it yourself."
because of all the bad things that happened to her family. That's all."
"Why are you still here?" Harry asked.
His thoughts were cut off by remembering Draco's words from weeks ago about Harry messing with Draco's head. Was he going to do it again by letting his lust take control like this? Some things had changed since that time but it was a fact that Harry was still in a relationship with Ginny, that hadn't changed, even though they were having a break at the moment. Harry hadn't decided what he was going to do with Ginny yet. He didn't want to hurt her and he didn't want to hurt Draco either. Besides he wasn't even sure of what Draco felt towards him either, because he hadn't even dared to talk about his
"It's not difficult at all. Not much different from preparing ingredients for potions, you know", Harry had said. Flashing a supportive smile at Draco, he had offered a knife to the Slytherin, asking: "Do you want to try as well?"
They spent the next morning shopping for the last minute Christmas gifts and Harry was positively surprised that Draco was a great help for him. With the Slytherin's help he found proper gifts for Ron and Hermione quite quickly, but he still didn't have any idea what to buy for Ginny. Draco wasn't offering him any help with that one.
He paused, looking at Draco deep in the eyes, before finally ending his speech:
shut up, Potter!"
"-has had no kind of sexual experience yet,
"Love you, Harry..."
Harry shook his head. "Uh... not really", he said. "But..." He paused, hesitating. "We are... taking a break."
"Merlin, Mal-
"No!" Harry said and grabbed his arm roughly, turning him around again. "You have to believe me!"
horny. If they didn't have different common rooms, they would probably have ended up in bed together this time.
" He rolled his eyes. "Use your brains..."
He slowly lifted himself up and carefully pulled out of Draco, landing next to the other man on the sheets. Draco's eyes were still closed and he was breathing heavily, part of his platinum hair glued against the skin of his forehead. Harry's eyes rested on the very sweaty but still so beautiful Slytherin and without hesitation he pulled the man closer, taking him in his arms and kissed him, this time very tenderly, and Draco kissed him back.
This time it was Ginny who looked slightly annoyed. "I guess so…", she sighed, quickly bent over him again and pressed a quick kiss on his lips before turning around to leave. "Good night."
First of all, there was Ginny's desire to sleep with Harry, or
He kept caressing the Slytherin's innocent looking sleeping face and finally he saw the stormy grey eyes opening up very, very slowly and slightly, immediately boring into his own.
Harry was glaring at his best friend.
"I think we've had enough of talking for tonight", the blond said.
"Just answer the question, Malfoy", Harry snapped.
Under the invisibility cloak he could see Theodore and... no, just Theodore alone. No Malfoy. Theodore left the door half open behind him and stormed through the corridor with quick steps, entering his and Malfoy's room and almost slamming the door closed after himself.
Damn it, Draco looked so hot in the flickering lights of the television. Harry was all too aware of the fact that this time there was no one else in the house, just the two of them, and they would be able to do anything they wanted without no one knowing or hearing. His stomach lurched at the thought. Damn but he wanted the other man.
Harry's mouth opened. What?!
"You heard me", the blond said quietly, trying to look anywhere but at Harry.
He saw Hermione giving him concerned looks, but because Ron was also sitting with them, Harry couldn't talk to her about the things that worried him.
His eyes were shut and his hands were squeezing the sheets tightly, already eagerly waiting for something bigger.
, that's what it is." And then Malfoy had already pulled him closer and kissed him. Harry kissed him back, feeling very abashed right now. Blimey, Malfoy found his inexperience
"You just have a dirty mind", Hermione hissed.
Harry forced out a laugh, staring straight to Malfoy's grey eyes. A shiver went down his spine and the tingling sensation was back once again. There were
Like promised earlier, Draco's new shirt was already being quickly unbuttoned and soon thrown carelessly to the floor. Draco shuddered as Harry's long, skilful fingers were immediately caressing his bare upper body. Harry's hands were so warm, they were so strong and rough, they were such manly hands, and he loved the way they felt against the softness of his own skin. Just a simple touch by Harry was able to drive him crazy with lust.
"No", Harry said quickly. "We have to talk." He didn't know where the conversation would go but he knew that they needed to talk about last night sooner or later. However, the Slytherin's next question got him astounded.
Harry couldn't help feeling a little sting in his chest. Malfoy didn't even seem to care at all. It was quite clear that he didn't mean anything to Malfoy, not really. Malfoy had just been horny tonight and Harry had been available, but he didn't seem to be attached to him, unlike Harry was to him.
, without bothering to leave me a note or
"Fine!"
Harry gave Malfoy an irritated look. He could still remember that day very clearly. It had been their fifth year when Malfoy had disparaged both Molly and Harry's mom after Slytherin had lost to Gryffindor, and something in Harry's head had snapped completely and then he had attacked Malfoy and beaten him up with George. In the end Malfoy had been all bloody and Harry and the twins had been banned from the Quidditch team for the rest of the school year.
Harry replied simply with a shrug, flashing her a grin before taking a seat on his chair again.
Now, having realized his true feelings, Harry's eyes kept following Malfoy almost everywhere.
As the music echoed through the hall, they leaned close to each other and started to dance to the song.
"He used to be a madcap too?" Draco teased.
Harry sighed. "Okay, I get your point."
Harry pretended to be shocked when in reality he was embarrassed. Hermione was on the right track but he could
"Me too...", Harry gasped. Malfoy was rubbing at their slick members so hard against each other’s now that it was driving Harry mad. Everything was starting to go black, he was getting really close now. "Draco, oh god I'm gon- aaah-"
"What do you think", Draco said dryly, rolling his eyes.
"Nngh", was all that Harry managed to say back, shuddering hard as Draco's fingers were probing at his prostate.
"Fine... Ahhh,
It couldn't be denied that having seen the pictures made him feel guilty for cheating on Ginny. However, it didn't change the fact that he didn't actually regret what he had done.
"What are you waiting for then?" the Slytherin whispered against his lips, eyes dark with desire. "Just fucking
"God damnit, Harry", Draco was moaning in frustration, his hips jerking helplessly. "Stop teasing me and fuck me already..."
"You did have my attention, though", Harry commented. "But not in a good way. You were an arse to me all the time..."
"Like you already know, I spent the Christmas break at Grimmauld Place", Harry started. His throat felt strangled. It was now or never.
‘Yes, sir,’ Harry replied with a dubious expression on his face that had Draco smirking.
Harry fell to his knees in the damp leaves a sob tearing through him. There was no one around to hear him fall apart, no one around to comfort him because there was never anyone, there’d never be anyone and Harry would lose this war and people would die and he would –
i'm glad you're taking this so seriously ron
created a new chat
Someone needs to keep his ego in check
WAHTA
He claims he hates muggles yet he wilfully eats our crisps???? Aight then
He said yes.

Well, I do, but the fucking guidance counsellor said I should talk about it
You're neither of those things.

what did you expect?
23 hours, 59 minutes.
longbottom, i suppose.
we need a few weeks away from each other that's all
I thought we were safe :-(
shut up.
it's a public chat i can say what i want
Oh, and fifty points will be taken from your house.
I'm completely in touch with my emotions thanks
Also, I noticed you were missing from the hall at dinner last night. Were you feeling alright? If Mr Malfoy injured you you'll need to visit the hospital wing.

You never learn
It was a little wank, that's all
I've been closely following his movements as of late. He left the dorms twice last night - nightmares, presumably.
not like ur actually queer is it
To be fair though you don't just open someone else's messages
He HAS been called worse
Hello :-)
Takes more than a roomful of pubescent boys to intimidate me.
Ron mate
As if Snape would let death get in the way of handing in our potions assignments on time
Because whenever Harry drinks he either ends up crying on my shoulder or snogging anyone within a five mile radius.
Ron please calm down
I knew you liked them really ;-)
Yh well unfortunately that makes u at least 25% homosexual
nice vid tho
You really don't mind? I thought the wizarding world was pretty anti-gay.
pansy?
Since when are you in the habit of getting high anyway Harry
What the fuck did he unblock you
thanks very much for telling me by the way
ive got foundation if u want me to cover up the bruise
He must be the least tech-savvy person to exist in the twentieth century
you spitting in his face...... that was ur apology?
Have you got anything to say, Malfoy?
NEVILLE WHAT THE FUCK
You guys kissed?
Heads up guys: Hagrid's cooking tonight
Well, I'll leave the excuses up to you next time since you're clearly the expert.
Only gays wear scarves everyone knows that
ive upped the prices since receiving several threatening texts from draco
Blimey it's a small wonder the Slytherins have any left
That's brilliant
I beg your pardon?
Look mate I swore blind you still liked fanny
harry everyone knows
What do you mean it doesn't affect me??? Everyone's talking about me enough as it is
sent a screenshot to the chat
listen here potter
thats a yes then
You know
But I'm not interacting with her or any of the other Slytherins
Mate he wears that green scarf
As if.
She's good
Give her a chance she's desperate to be your friend
With what, exactly?
WHY ARE YOU AGREEING WITH MALFOY AGAIN
well, he needed to sort out my future at some point.
speak for yourself.
I suppose we should be congratulating you, really
oh come on luna

We're all eighteen after all
Chicken pox
Shut up I read
Best not
you know what i think they're great
A whole fortnight huh

No talking while I'm typing. Five points from Gryffindor.

Hi Neville :-)
Sounds unhealthy as fuck mate
You know I don't mind talking about it
Hey mate

Honestly fuck you
Has Ron figured out how to turn his phone on yet?
Oh, so you've stopped having nightmares now?
everyone knows u stupid sod
.... Hermione are you okay

from the chat
I'm waiting, Potter.
Why not? Malfoy has finished his already.
Coming out what
I mean I would've thought that was just common sense
HE INVITED PANSY PARKINSON TO THE PARTY
What??? As in telling people???
Merlin not Longbottom too
believe it or not i thought we were FRIENDS
NEVILLE WHAT THE FUCK
Could've just added them to the other chat but ok
i don't look like that!
Is it the pudding? It isn't as sweet as usual. I think they've changed house elves in the kitchens.
honestly just a little bit of ptsd n ur self-preservation has been sent down the plan
nah i just copy malfoys
You could just look at my face
Never intrude on a wallower Ron
then someone pointed out the hypocrisy of using a muggle device to complain about muggles
Are you just saying that
Oh Pansy
I'll talk to him
have you composed yourself now?
You're writing the essay yourself though. I'm helping Harry at the moment but I can give you some starting points.
Idk I think I just empathised with him a bit
It means retweet, Ron.
alright then. 20 galleons says potter likes it up the arse
You always say that
Are you going to offer a truce, Ron? That's a sensible idea. I'd thought of that myself.
created a new chat
Not before I snuck in a cheeky retweet though
What the fuck
WHTYTH EFUCK DID YOUS AY THAT
Ronald?
Anyway more importantly
But that isn't an issue because Seamus isn't getting pissed, he's ill.
ive got THRILLING news
Not another detention?
Yeah that he's every bit as hypocritical and tasteless as his father
have u ever considered.... u know.... sorting out ur own life???
You really are blissfully unobservant sometimes. I always thought Malfoy was gay.
If only we still had the threat of a murderous lunatic to excuse us
I thought we were meeting up :-(
it's christmas soon
draco's just pissed bc he's already had some messages from the gryffindors to welcome him back <3
Welcome!
idk how u judge homosexuality but in my books snogging another bloke is pretty fucking queer
Just because I lack your creative flair
omg u just lolled
He doesn't want to keep ur passionate homoerotic affair a secret anymore
As far as I'm concerned the slytherins were left to fend for themselves, actually
Was there tongue involved
Did you know you were gay even then
Touche.
I don't know what that means but yes
Do u wanna get pissed or not mate
I'm wallowing leave me alone
Oh, and little spoon
NEVILLE
That's been bugging me all this time.
how's ur cheek anyway
Re fucking tweet
Crack?
changed the chat name to
Understandable, have a nice day
Will do.
And I've nearly died like 10 times
exactly.
oh ur serious
Well, I certainly hope not.
like ur mundane, alcohol-free party!
Please
added
Actually can we do that now you're
what???? no????? where did that come from
Well, you did kiss another man.
Yeah well I have the courtesy not to because I'm sensitive and considerate
ALSO ill bring back snape next chapter dw i miss his miserable emo ass
absolutely not.
What a shame. Another five points from Gryffindor.
fine.
am i ur beard
Bloody hell why don't you go ahead and ban fun while you're at it
her insanity is a welcome distraction
But quite possibly
I agree
Ahahahaha Snape's been bitching abt us again
sounds like a u problem then
The fuck are you going on about this isn't a war
is this u finally coming out
Could be fatal sir
whthfu cnk
delete it at once!
Men tend to be emotionally stunted as a result of societal pressures. I doubt it's an issue attributed to Harry in particular.
get a load of this
MY SMILIES
In less obscene terms, naturally.
Harry this is serious
he didnt really need to
He's a lot less intimidating via text
I think you've broken Ron, though.
Mr Malfoy will also be suitably punished, but I'm sure that's none of your business.
Because you tried to have my best friend killed.
yeah i know
i'm better looking than you.
you really should learn how to detect sarcasm through text
THEN he got suspended for hate speech
ur literally an 80 year old man stuck in the body of a teenage boy
shut up u smarmy arse
there are no junkies in the malfoy family, thanks very much.
you must be into the minuses now!
Harry, for the love of God PLEASE shut up.
i just need to invite a few friends
I'm not writing your essay. That's cheating.
:-(((
anyway
do i just have to ignore him then
Can't have nightmares if you don't sleep in the first place
Neville I could kiss you
The feeling's mutual <3
Alright. Good day, Malfoy.
.... yes rlly u melodramatic bitch
and maybe it doesn't affect you but it's pretty fucking embarrassing for me
This is the worst day of my life
Not even that
Harry, this is an extra message. I would strongly advise you organise a meeting with the school nurse soon - even if it's only a one-off session. I have sent the same message to several of your peers. YOLO!
Are you alright, Ron?
I think it's wonderful that two men are comfortable enough in their sexuality to show friendly affection.
i've invited some of the hufflepuffs already :-)
You know I'm really beginning to regret speaking in their defence
besides i seriously doubt u would be of any real threat to my relationship ur too boring
one would almost think u didnt WANT me at ur party
they hunted us, remember? they started this.
yeah u haven't even brushed ur hair
Alright I'm done now you can remove him again
to the chat
Yeah, that's not what I meant.
Thing is I think I might be half and half
ur quite the hot topic at the moment
he wants sex all the time as well
i doubt it
anyway look
Like what
Me? Never
That wasn't my fault I swear
Right
HARRY
sent a photo to the chat
Any update?
You know what that's fair
i mean yeah
Wait, what?
why would i have twitter?
Funnily enough, no.
Yes? :-)
because i won't hesitate to tell snape if you have.
were we talking about me? i think we were talking about me.
Do it sooner rather than later. She deserves to know.
Oh shit
Do you want me to come with you?
Wait what happened
please
How could you hold a horse anyway they're fucking huge
and i don't know what an 'engineer' is but it doesn't sound as if he's well connected.
not my fault ur unobservant
Absolutely not.
And you're terrible at remembering to get your hair cut
to the chat
WAHST
Yeah yeah same difference
If it's any consolation it was an absolutely shite kiss and it lasted for like 2 seconds
in fact he ISNT in the picture, idk wtf ur problem is
Ron he invited Ginny
Omg <33343
You don't fancy Dean fucking Thomas again do you
i've told u you'll last longer next time
HARRY
This is Seamus' fucking fault
Anyway what was that abt a video
I don't know fucking muggle etiquette do I
Since when do u have Twitter Ron wtf
A befitting time for a meeting, I'm sure you'll agree.
Right sorry
That's not fair!
They've defeated Voldemort like 5 times I doubt they're scared of us
He's been very volatile lately, don't you think? What with him punching Malfoy and all, especially after we agreed to ignore him this year.
I can't change it on this chat anyway Seamus is the group admin
Right. I'm on my way now.
Professor
i wasn't trying to b NICE granger
what if he's dangerous, pansy?

Wot??????
Leave the smiths alone
heres a new chapter i had to bring in hagrid somehow because he is the love of my life and I feel he is SEVERELY underappreciated within the fandom n i will love him w all my heart till the day i fuckin die goodnight
Of course?
I don't know, Ron. Perhaps one day society will progress past the need for proper face-to-face interaction and we will communicate almost entirely through the Internet.
*RETCH*
You what?
changed
Right can we save the arguments about muggle bands for later because I have no idea what you're talking about
Don't worry! I've invited her already
Ah. Potter, Weasley, I appear to be missing yours. Ten points from Gryffindor. Each.
What? You think YOU'RE the eye candy?
shut up malfoy u spent like 6 years stringing me along dont talk abt not valuing friendships
and i cant sit here watching ur mardy arse sulk in the corner of the room for a second longer
How'd it go, then?
added
did we do anything wrong?
Why didn't you tell me about the video ffs
u know what i disagree
He's Irish
How the fuck did you get into the chat
Before you go, Mr Malfoy, let me remind you of the precariousness of your position at Hogwarts.
I'm your 12th sir
Harry??
Malfoy was being a cunt as usual
i expect my payment at dinner ;)
Absolutely not.
abt forty galleons worth
Still gets me every time
Lucky I got it done in time then
POTTER however

So did you???? We were pissed that's the kind of shit that happens
It's my turn to bring out the What The Fuck
Yh Pansy

I MENT CONSERVATIVE
is he actually queer?
were u seriously worried abt that??? u sweetheart

added
Can't I don't want Hermione seeing these messages
Weasel and Potter dragged her away before I had the chance to return the compliment anyway
Oh, alright :-)
Please
Right no thanks
draco he never shows any emotion besides mild annoyance of course he didn't
What horses??? I don't own horses
I mean I didn't say it at the time but I would be greatly comforted knowing Malfoy was rotting in Azkaban
Not really no
Half and half what
he's just some random muggle!
Oh, don't worry. I thought I'd do that myself.
to the chat
My bad
Wait does this anecdote involve humiliating Snape

Good. Now, since you've behaved like a child I have been forced to treat you as such. You will serve a week's detention to with me to ensure that you learn your lesson. Fighting is not tolerated at Hogwarts, as you ought to know by now.
... ok maybe
It's alright
why is a video of me on there?
You're saying that as if the Ron slander doesn't continue into the day.
Well, why don't you just ask him?
hes under the mistaken impression that we're all lying in wait for his response
: It's nothing to be ashamed of, you know. Everyone can do with a little extra help from time to time.
The proper term is bisexual.
You still down then?
He better not.
Is that sarcasm
Busy with what, exactly?
sent a photo

Why? We don't need a party. We have nothing to celebrate.
WHAT DID I TELL YOU

Really

You ate all the chocolate frogs you cunt
THERE ARE NO HOMOSEXUAL ESCAPADES

wtf???????
holy fuck we inadvertently staged a coup
nvm youve suddenly lost all preexisting sex appeal
is it?
Can't I wallow with you
Only you keep staring at Harry. Which I suppose makes sense as he is your boyfriend, but you're staring more than usual.
but did i not make up for that when i saved ur party
It's not unlikely that someone in your position would be considering harming themselves, Harry. We're just worried about you.
as if there were ever any doubts abt that fact
but there's the possibility he might lie
i've already had three letters threatening to disinherit me if i don't clean my act up, thanks.
added

Unless he's suddenly acquired an entire new personality in the last week.... no thanks
What was that
Right sorry I'll remember to suppress my emotions from now on

wot was that about deteriorating relationships
sent a screenshot to the chat
Aww. If I didn't hate him so much I'd almost feel bad for him.
Cheese and onion crisps always take precedence over pig-headed racism <3
must be an imposter.
I'm not even going to dignify that with a response.
Shut up Nev this is your fault
Hold ur horses
What are u banging on about then
RIGHT
you're not making yourself sound any less guilty harry
if by 'hot topic' you mean everyone hates me, yes.
just out of interest does ur dad have any expensive alcohol stashed away anywhere
Shit u right
leave him be he's embarrassed enough as it is
it must be serious
It was a video on Ginny's phone
Oh right
The screen's all smashed and I can see its insides
Really? That's strange. Perhaps he's blocked you.
Your dictatorship is over Hermione
You're always so articulate
fuck off
Pretty self-explanatory, really. Nude pictures.
nah u rejected my attempts at civility
Honestly, Ron, it wasn't anywhere near as bad as you think. Harry said it was just a friendly kiss. Like a kiss on the cheek, except, you know, on the lips.
This is demeaning
none whatsoever
trust me, he REALLY needs to have a good time
neville she's friends with MALFOY
That's why you asked Harry if he was queer wasn't it
please
plus nobody's making an effort to be nice to us.
I've been teaching him about the use of emoticons.
Malfoy spat in Harry's face. I'd say that's decidedly wrong. And completely disgusting.
Don't laugh
methinks ur finally giving up the heterosexual facade
.... i'll bear that in mind
fuck off.
as if pansy would deign to associate with muggles.
obligatory inter-house party. also harry potter listens to britpop n that's canon
my father's arranging my engagement right at this moment. does that sound remotely queer to you?
We're interacting via text, Ron.
like u wouldn't be doing the exact same thing if ur dad wasn't in the picture
Be quiet.
is typing
I'm sorry?
....What
And to think I was going 2 bring u presents
Wait you actually managed to get us invited
oh hes reading all these messages he'll just wait a couple of hrs before he replies
pretty fucking dreadfully
and if by some strange twist of fate i DID happen to spit in his face he'll be too pissed to remember it tomorrow anyway
saucy ;)
Yeah you're right I don't
... it's half past six
fuckin hell im not always coming onto u u know
remember when i charmed your legs together, longbottom?
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Harry squinting at the sky, even with his glasses on. “I don’t see it. Which one’s Ursa Minor again?”
It was almost hard to believe that he was now face to face with that very same powerful, dark, wizard who’d created such a beautiful place like the Garden of Mystics.
Draco thought,
He so desperately wanted to ask Potter if what they had accumulated over the past week was something close to friendship. He wanted to know where he stood with Potter- what Potter saw Draco as. But, like always, he was a coward who couldn’t form the right words. He wished Potter would just outright ask him if they were friends, so Draco wouldn’t have to. He wasn’t sure whether Potter was also scared of asking the question, or if he just didn’t care, and didn’t spend all day thinking about if they were friends or not; so the question never even crossed his mind.
“That’s… good.” Draco responded. “What about Kaspian? And why have I never seen him before this year?”
“Having hope? I don’t fucking know to be honest. Hope is way too overrated. But I mean the whole I-think-they’re-sleeping theory is better to believe than an I-think-they’re-dead theory. We do know they’re breathing, so there’s that.”
Elizabeth seemed to understand, and nodded her head, asking Pansy to continue on.
“Don’t say his name.” Draco looked directly into Potter’s eyes, scowling at him.
Alec was now looking impatient, leaning against the nearest tree and shooting nasty looks at Draco. Drys moved even closer to him and Harry.
Draco stormed into the Room of Requirement, ripping off his thoroughly drenched clothes.
Thank you to all my readers! Hope you enjoyed <3 It's been exactly a year since I first posted this which is absolutely crazy
All he had to do now was accept the reality.
Potter didn’t look like he was waiting for a response though. He glanced down at the instructions that were laid out between them, and then grabbed a handful of dragon scales, setting it down in front of the cauldron. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“Yes you can. If I can learn difficult spells, I know you can too.”
The enormous, sneery Auror looked in Draco’s direction as he heard the little squeaks of the hospital bed, and immediately turned towards the direction of the door, walking out of the room without a word.
Draco was about to run out the door and search the whole fucking castle for Harry bloody Potter when the entrance opened and in stepped, who could’ve guessed, Potter.
Draco got ready for bed, thankful that the Room of Requirement gave him everything he might possibly need. Even the pyjamas it had provided were top quality, they were like the ones he had at The Manor; silk and the color of deep green.
And even though the week was going by insanely fast, the prospect of spending time in the Garden seemed to ease their minds. It was like the air in the Garden of Mystics had been laced with Calming Drought, erasing all of Draco’s rational and irrational worries.
Instead of Harry placing his head back on Draco’s shoulder, Draco placed
“Yes, well. There’s always room for improvement. And besides I’m not teaching you. I don’t know any of those spells in that book. I’m just going to assist you in learning them and mastering some.” Draco pointed at the book in Potter’s hand.
“I’ve met his dad.”
Potter continued, “I’ve had way too many adults in my life throw their problems on children. It’s time they can take some responsibility for something. We figured out one part, and they can figure out the next.”
been able to send a letter successfully using the spell to surpass barriers. Granted, the spell hadn’t worked on breaking the actual barrier as a whole, but it had worked nonetheless.
He swore that every last one of them, about fifteen or so students from various years, wore slightly gaping mouths and couldn’t take their eyes off of him for one second.
“That’s an understatement,” Draco remarked, walking towards the water fountain and sitting down at a bench closest to where Harry was standing, still sticking his fingers into the falling water like a child.
He was excused from his classes while he was in the Hospital Wing, and he didn’t even have to make up the work. Harry had been told the same thing, given the event he had gone through, even though he hadn’t been in the Hospital Wing for more than two days. Although, Pansy said Harry still attended all his classes. Draco had a suspicion that was because Harry wouldn’t have been able to sit around doing nothing until Draco came out of the Hospital Wing.
Draco, surprised at the abrupt change of subject, couldn’t suppress the array of emotions now flittering on
The main Death Eater stood in front of Drys while the two who were still holding Drys in place by his arms stood beside him. They didn’t say anything; just waited calmly until the rest of the group came back together.
“But you did, Draco. You hurt me.”
Potter uncrossed his arms, raking both hands through his unruly hair. “When I woke up this morning, Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all asleep-”
“Potter that’s amazing! I knew you could do it!” Draco had actually been the complete opposite of sure, but he had to say something encouraging.
He thought of all the years of animosity between them, and how
Before he could stop himself, before Pomfrey could make it back inside her office, Draco said warily; “Madame Pomfrey?”
“Excellent work, Harry! Ten points to Gryffindor.” Slughorn admonished.
“You know how I was in the Hospital Wing before the Curse started?” Draco prompted, proud of himself for being brave enough to talk about this.
Harry had surpassed every barrier Draco had surrounded himself with. Because of Harry, because of all that Harry was and Harry stood for, because Harry saw past every possible barrier Draco had ever put up, tears escaped from Draco’s eyes.
to trap a target in a large bubble, and Draco’s personal favorite,
bad today, you have to admit,” Pansy said as she moved in front of him.
“Fine! Whatever. It’s my injuries. They aren’t fully healed yet and all this walking and running is definitely not helping my situation.” He stopped kneeling, and thought,
Harry didn’t shout again.
That night Draco sat in the Slytherin common room with his Arithmancy book open on his lap. He was deep into reading the text when he heard someone sit down next to him, loudly chewing away on muggle gum, and sighing over dramatically.
The walk back to the Room was filled with Harry’s consistent blabbering. Not that Draco minded. He liked listening to Harry talk, and his voice was soothing and familiar.
Somehow, Draco had been supremely good at avoiding Harry in the halls, and a situation like this had never happened before now.
. They were such unnatural positions; it had to be uncomfortable. No one could have intentionally fallen asleep with their fingers pinched between pages, heads poking the sharp corners of books. Except for maybe Granger, but she was the only exception.
“I can only ask it three questions?”
The bandage only had a smudge of blood on it, near the skull of the Mark, but other than that it was clean. On harder days, Draco wrapped his forearm up just for the sake of feeling secure. And as Harry started to unwrap it, Draco’s security fell, leaving him vulnerable in so many ways.
“Okay, okay last chance to turn back,” she said, coming to a halt at the top of the stairs that led down to the Great Hall.
“What?”
They had gone skipping away, huge grins plastered on their faces and squeaky giggles pouring not so discreetly from their mouths. Draco had
Draco couldn’t come up with anything more to say. Potter took his silence as time for him to speak.
The rain poured down on Draco as he stood still in the middle of the grass.
He thought about asking Pansy about Harry, but the words never came out of his mouth.
The first object that was set down was Draco’s wand, which he snatched right away, twisting the familiar wood in his fingers. He’d already lost one wand, so he was glad that his newest one hadn’t become lost or broken.
He told Harry about his adventure through the castle dungeons while searching for him, and how he had heard a noise that belonged to a person, which they now knew was Alec, and found a Slytherin tie on the ground.
“No. I’m sure Voldemort is dead. But I’m also confused about one other thing. If you sent a letter to your father, why didn’t you also send a letter of distress to the Ministry or something? Don’t you want us to have help?”
“Speaking of the Weasleys, what happened to you and… girl Weasley?” Draco asked, not wanting to think about how he would never find happiness any longer.
“And I’d do it again in a heartbeat.”
really that close to his. His expression displayed
At this point, Draco knew he was dead. But he also knew what the Wizarding World was like now. Drys had somehow convinced everyone that even though Draco had done a terrible deed; killing so many people, it was better for the world.
Draco thought. He knew he had to say it, say it before another crisis happened, before anything happened to either of them. “I got to know you, and even though I’ve only just started to know you… I’ve been in love with you, long before I even knew it myself.”
Just then, Alec Kaspian strode up to the Gryffindor table, where Potter sat. Kaspian sat down directly across from Potter, blocking Draco’s view of his face. Draco frowned.
Well, except one dream of his. A dream that wouldn’t come true if Draco kept avoiding it. He touched the gem dangling under his robes; he never forgot to wear it.
Draco took in the wonderful sight before his eyes. The floor was covered in cobblestones with tiny flowers and moss in between all the crevices, the walls mirrored the floor, with large amounts of moss and vines. In the very center of the room, a water fountain stood, spitting out water and letting it fall into the pool below, encased by the same bricks that made up the walls. Surrounding the water fountain and outer rim of the Garden, several wooden benches stood, along with different kinds of plants and flowers.
“And now I wanted to let you know, I forgive you for avoiding me. You shouldn’t even have had to ask for forgiveness for that, really. I understand needing time alone to sort things out. I just, I did miss you. I only really wished for a quick explanation on why you were avoiding me, even after that time we briefly talked in the Hogshead.”
Their friends came into view, having laid out a blanket and some dinner plates. All around them were other students, all different ages and from different Houses, clustered around the lake. Some were even swimming. The whole scene felt magical, and it was the perfect way to end the year.
The rest of the school was in complete shock. The area in front of the Great Hall was in disarray; a clash of chatter and stunned silence filling the air.
Potter was an idiot. He didn’t know a single thing about Potions.
Draco looked Drys directly in the eye. “I’m not accepting your offer. I won’t use the blade on Harry.” Draco didn’t know if he imagined it, but he thought he felt Harry exhale, and lean in closer to Draco’s chest. “You can’t afford to kill Harry, either, so I know you were lying about that part. And I will find a way to break the sleeping curse. You aren’t going to control me this time.”
From what he could see, Harry was sitting up somewhat and allowed enough room on his left side for Draco to sleep comfortably. The covers were pulled back on Draco’s side, and the empty space was practically begging Draco to fill it.
He lifted his arm out in front of him, still lying sprawled on the ground, and let out a gasp. His robe sleeve and shirt sleeve had both been cut off at his left elbow, revealing his forearm that had a brand new cut, slicing all the way down the skull and snake. The cut was obviously a new one, not one from his previous self-inflicted injuries, since blood was gushing out
Then the two of them had gone to their respective common rooms to check if anyone had moved, and were not in the least bit shocked to find no one had. They could obviously tell no one else was around just from walking the halls of Hogwarts, but they agreed they should also check their common rooms every morning together, just in case.
“Why two weeks? Why did you have to put everyone under a sleeping curse, and why only Hogwarts and Hogsmeade?”
Hogwarts had been put under. At least Draco knew, (or was pretty close to sure) everyone was alive. Potter and him could figure out what the bloody hell was going on and fix it and return everything back to normal.
“Now it’s my turn to ask a stupid question,” He said. Draco rolled his eyes and crossed his arms, waiting for Potter’s stupid question. “Why are you wearing robes when you could be wearing much more comfortable clothes? No one else is here. I don’t think you have to abide by the dress code.”
“What the fuck!” Draco hissed while rubbing the now sore spot.
“Yep. Just talking about funerals and whatnot.”
He’d dreamed of a moment exactly like this. Where he would be viewed as a hero, and not the villain. Of a day where people would really give him a second chance at life, because they could truly see he had changed. Of a day where people wouldn’t be scared of him, and would congratulate and thank him for a heroic deed.
“No. I even checked on the bloody House Elves and they were all asleep too! It looks like we’re the only two conscious.”
“I see.” He continued to look down at his hands and she went on. “You are welcome at Hogwarts, Mr. Malfoy. I hope you know that.”
“How-” Draco started, but Drys instantly cut him off.
, he thought,
“I thought you said getting hammered drunk was behind you?”
“Meet me at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, near the gates that lead out to Hogsmeade, and-” the Figure kicked Harry’s body again, which made Draco’s blood boil about a thousand times over, “you can save your precious Savior.”
“You know, why is it just us two? It could have been literally any other two students, but it ended up being
He and Harry still had so much to talk about. Especially after the fiasco in the forest.
They didn't bring up the subject again.
Potter shifted on his feet a bit, but didn’t say anything. He looked very uncomfortable and out of place. Instead, he raked his hand, the one that wasn’t still latched onto Draco’s wrist, through his already messy hair.
He realized, solemnly, that he only had one option left, and that was to talk to Harry. Tell him everything he had lied about, and hope Harry could come up with a solution as quickly as possible.
Draco had to close his eyes as the impact of Harry’s words struck. He truly did not know how to explain to Harry why his Mark was moving. He had no idea himself.
He should have been happy. It was killing him to think about how he knew exactly what--or whom--was making him unhappy.
“I’ll be by your side, too,” Harry said. There was a moment of silence between them, the only sound audible was the wind and their quick, short breaths. “Now, I know you told me specifically not to ever pluck an Anemonlea, since they’re rare, but…”
“So, what was that all about?”
dark wizards makes me sick. I just want to live the most normal life I can, you know?” Harry said.
As he made his way hastily through the corridors, he thought about Smith and Theo and their little group who would probably attack him once more if they found him alone in a hallway. He noticed there were no students around at the moment, so the probability of that scenario was very high. He knew their group could be hiding out behind any portrait or hidden corridor, ready to strike, but the prospect of Madame Pomfrey being in serious danger kept his body moving towards the Headmistresses office.
Both Blaise and Pansy laughed. “Not even in the slightest, Draco,” Pansy replied. “At least not anymore.”
“Weren’t you the one to suggest we look in books to solve this curse?” Potter smirked, and Draco felt a little bit of Potter’s happy and hopeful self return back to him.
“You had no other choice. Seriously. And you had no control over your father’s death.”
“Also,” Harry went on,”It’s kind of brought me luck? Like, I don’t know, it’s incredibly silly, but I feel safe when it's with me, I feel that it protects me. I just wanted you to have it now, since I feel like it’s protected and guided me a good amount, and now you deserve to have it.”
“No, I promise I didn’t,” Draco told him truthfully. “Ever since the Sleeping Curse, it’s been bleeding in random intervals. The two weeks I was confined to the Hospital Wing, it bled every day; I think it’s trying to get rid of Drys’s magic that was left behind from when he was in control. But ever since I left the Wing it just decides to bleed randomly--not very often, though--and I have wraps from Madame Pomfrey to wrap it up in when it does.”
He didn’t have to worry about the Aurors stationed at Azkaban reading his letter; along with removing the Dementors, they implemented more humane rules that insured the Prisoner's privacy. Immediate family members were the only people allowed to message anyone in Azkaban, and although the guards weren’t allowed to read the contents of letters sent to the prison, they were allowed to read what the prisoner’s wrote back. It wasn’t much more privacy for the prisoner’s exactly, but privacy to the family members outside of Azkaban. It was something, and that something was all Draco needed.
“What is this about, Potter?” Draco sighed.
The wall the spell had hit, revealed a hidden passageway, and Draco felt the need to scream.
A thread had been tied and knotted between them both, and then the thread had been severed. Draco desperately hoped to tie it back together again, even if it would never be the exact same.
“I’ll answer all your questions
“Draco?” Harry said, shifting his head so now his chin was lightly resting on Draco’s shoulder, his eyes mapping out Draco’s face.
Draco passed out.
Before he knew it, he was sprinting across the Lawn, heading in the direction where the path to Hogsmeade was located. He had no time to cast a rain repelling charm or a heating charm, so the drops of water pelted him and made him even more wet than he had been that morning. The mud in the grass did not help his situation whatsoever.
I've re-read and edited this chapter more than five times and I think this is the best its going to get, so I really do hope its an okay chapter
Draco hated Theo.
Potter had been far too insistent in his complaints and Draco was having a pretty terrible day as it was, so he eventually gave in to Potter and told him he would go to Hogsmeade. Potter had seemed supremely surprised that Draco had complied, and said he would wait for him by Hogwarts’ main entrance while Draco got bundled up for the bitter cold.
Draco had found Potter’s company pleasantly comforting. Sure, he wouldn’t have been Draco’s first choice in companionship, but he was a lot better of a choice than anyone else in the school. At least Potter didn’t try to hex him every second and call him hurtful names. Though Draco supposed Potter really should be doing all those things. He deserved it after all the years Draco had called Potter and his family horrible names. The prospect that Potter was being nice to him was still unreal, but Draco was starting to like the Potter who was being civil, and
He also briefly explained his stay in Azkaban, and how horrible that experience had been, even with the Dementors gone. It was tough, reminiscing on one of his most dreadful and humiliating moments, but Harry was there to comfort him, and tell him that he didn’t need to look back on it if he didn’t want to. Draco had shaken him off and explained he needed to talk about it with someone, and Harry was the only someone he would do it with.
“I’m just trying to help, Malfoy. Even after all these years, you’re still a right git who won’t accept help, even when someone offers.”
“Okay, well I’m just going to go to class.” Draco hoped class hadn't started yet. He cast a quick
“It’s just I never even suspected he was- gay.”
She had to prod at the fact that he and Harry now had matching scars.
The rain pouring down did not brighten his mood either. The thunder, though, made everything so much more dramatic, and no matter what he tried to tell himself, he was all for dramatics.
“So someone, put this ward up? On purpose? To… entrap us?”
There was no one walking by at the moment, but Draco still felt embarrassed by his mother’s embracing nature--which accumulated sometime in the past week. Although, if a student did pass by, he didn’t think he’d mind so much.
He wasn’t ashamed of who he was. He had accepted himself a long time ago, and it felt silly to dwell on the matter of who he chose to love. He knew his father would never accept him, but his mother might. He hoped his mother would. He technically still could produce an heir, it would be extremely complicated, but it could happen, and he would get to marry a man.
“Okay, I can’t do this, Draco,” Harry blurted out, which promptly silenced the elve’s noises in Draco’s ears. “Are you mad at me, or something?”
Every single part of his body had been telling him to grip his forearm and sooth the pain, but he couldn’t. Not with Harry around. He would’ve known right away something was wrong and probably forced Draco to show him the Mark.
“And Alec hates me right now, I’m sure. He probably wants me dead.”
Harry gave him a pitying look. “Yeah. So their Dark Marks are all alive too?”
Harry didn’t answer. Draco’s mind raced. What had he done? He seriously could not remember.
No one else had been around in the common room, it’d been late. They kissed for so long, and Draco remembered how good it’d felt. But that kiss was the last time he’d ever kissed someone. He knew he shouldn’t have done it. It was wrong in every way possible. So, Draco avoided him after that.
Pomfrey looked like she was still expecting an answer from Draco, and he knew he would have to give it to her at some point. He sighed and said, “No, I didn’t harm myself.” Madame Pomfrey seemed like she was anticipating a much more detailed answer, so he unwillingly went on. “I was… attacked. I’m pretty sure they’re the ones who cut me.”
Potter and him had breakfast, took showers, and got ready for the lonely day ahead of them separately in the Room of Requirement. Draco had dressed in his Slytherin robes once again, for the lack of another idea as to what to wear, and that time Potter hadn’t commented on his outfit choices.
Draco sniffed and tried to look away, but Harry’s eyes just wouldn’t let him move. “It represents the very thing you fought to destroy. It represents how we were on completely opposite sides. It’s
Me, who you didn’t even care about two weeks ago. There’s really no need to apologize. I was about to
“Please! I beg you! Do whatever you want to me, but leave them alone!” Drys cried out again.
Weasley nudged Potter’s shoulder, and that seemed to shake him out of his trance. Potter turned to Weasley, and said something to him that was apparently hilarious, because Weasley burst out laughing.
strong headed, but whatever he could work with would do at the moment.
“I’ll do it myself. I’m capable of wrapping a bandage.”
Draco knew he shouldn’t be saying those rude things. Especially to Savior Boy here. Draco rarely talked as it was, he didn't know why he was breaking his 'no talking to anyone but Pansy' rule he came up with. He also only talked when professors called on him to answer questions. Which was hardly ever. They all either despised him so much that they couldn’t even look at him, or were downright scared of him, which also meant they hardly ever looked at him. But, something about Potter just made Draco so infuriatingly angry, and it was like he had to lash out at him. Also, there was no one else around.
He had a point. “Look, Potter. I’m doing fine on my own. If you need company, go and drag Weasley’s arse out of bed and slump him over your shoulder or something.”
He wouldn’t have to go through the pain of watching Harry die. Not caring, when he would be turned into the Ministry and most likely die himself.
Harry returned the hug, squeezing Draco’s arms, and Draco wanted to melt right then and there.
was sleeping soundly right next to him, slightly curled up into Draco’s side.
Harry’s finger wiped away the stray tear, and Draco made an odd sound at the gesture.
He wondered that if Harry could hear the intrusive thoughts piling inside his mind, would Harry run as far away from Draco as he could get? Would he not want to sleep in the same room as him? Would Harry not even take a chance at becoming his friend if he could hear all the horrible thoughts entering Draco’s brain?
That night, Draco was reluctantly dragged to Hogsmeade by Pansy and Blaise.
“...but while Hermione and Ron had each other, I didn’t have anyone, other than Alec. He taught me so many brilliant spells, although now I know where and who he learned those spells from, and he kept my mind occupied: I do miss him, but it’s alright.”
After Pansy finally left, Draco went back to sulking in his hospital bed. He tried to fall asleep, but he wasn’t tired. Madame Pomfrey bombarded him with many questions regarding his physical and mental health when she noticed Draco wasn’t in the least bit tired. He answered them very vaguely, which annoyed her to no end.
From behind Theo and Smith, he could see Finch-Fletchley flourish his own wand and cast
“Well I am very glad you came and got me. The healing spells you cast did help a tremendous amount, but he’ll need to stay in here for a couple more days to fully heal all his injuries.”
“I can obviously see that, but really? Do you have to try and one up me at everything?”
“Merlin knows how he got that one-”
Draco choked on nothing as he took in Harry’s words. “Damn. Okay. That’s something I never would have expected. You’re as Gryffindor as they come.”
Ten minutes later Draco found himself getting dressed in the warmest clothes he could find, in his dormitory surrounded by his still sleeping roommates.
They made their way to the Potions classroom and Draco immediately got to work stirring the yellowish-looking potion clockwise for fifteen minutes, using his wand to keep track of the amount of time going by.
To his surprise, Harry didn’t laugh at him. “That sounds great. I truly believe you can achieve that, Draco.”
Even though the book had glowed, alerting them that the seven days since they started the potion was up, the glow had not provided instructions on how to issue out the contents of the potion.
"Ginny, I need to talk to you."
Before Harry managed to say or do anything, Ginny had turned his face with the hand around him and pressed their lips together, kissing him. It took a while for Harry to even realize what was happening before he finally managed to pull away from her.
Christmas break gone?" Hermione asked.
Harry couldn't say it out loud, but from the look on his face Ginny immediately knew the answer anyway. Her face twisted with disbelief and disgust.
"In love. With HIM?!" Ron hissed. "I know we've become closer with him but that's just... just... What the hell, Harry?! Think of all he's done to you, to
There they were sitting at Hog's Head: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Malfoy and Goyle, drinking, talking and having fun.
he gasped, wide-eyed. "I'm...
Malfoy was looking out at the lake, avoiding eye contact, not answering his question. It made Harry wonder what was going on. Malfoy clearly wasn't himself at the moment.
Harry shrugged. "I honestly don't have a clue."
Blood was rushing in Harry's veins. They were so close. He was almost starting to lean over… but his own thoughts stopped him right in time.
seemed to have something going on. Something beyond just an ordinary friendship. Harry was almost certain about it, and for some reason it made him feel kind of distressed.
"It's so weird", Harry finally said, gaining Malfoy's attention. "Sitting here with you. Us not trying to kill each other anymore."
"You haven't told anyone, have you?" He was staring at the painting on the wall.
Harry was looking deep into Draco's beautiful stormy grey eyes.
he asked as quietly as he could.
Harry forced out a laugh, but he was quite deep in his own thoughts. Though Harry wasn't gay, he had to admit that Hermione was right.
"Yeah", Malfoy said, still no expression in his voice.
Hermione was rolling her eyes. "Yeah, right. You've been staring at him a lot… I see the way you look at him", she pointed out. "If you're not obsessed, then tell me the reason for that."
Harry had been right thinking that the Friday night was going to be an interesting one, but he had no idea how interesting it would really get...
to criticize. "Come on! Just look at it. Like this one, right here..."
I won’t stop until your legs are shaking and you're screaming my name."
"Yeah."
She hugged both of them before they left.
"Okay…", she said. "About what?"
Malfoy here with Theodore?
Harry noticed Hermione's gaze lingering on his clothes and especially on his new, expensive looking golden watch.
Harry opened up the cloak.
was happening to him?!
Harry stopped walking. So did Theodore.
But Harry only let out a laugh. "You wish", he said. "Weren't you listening to me earlier? I'm going to taste you in every – possible – way." He moved lower again and pulled off Draco's pants, finally freeing his leaking member, fingers instantly closing around it with a firm grasp. "And I'm going to start from here", he said, voice full of craving.
There was a long silence before Harry broke it off.
"So am I, but I had already promised to go", Goyle continued. "And I
The Slytherin turned his head to look at him. "No shit", he sneered, returning to the books in the shelf again.
Harry was watching Malfoy, thinking...
"Good", he said, letting out a relieved sigh. He gained a resentful glare from the Slytherin.
He would have to stop these kind of thoughts right now before he'd make a total fool of himself.
"Take a seat, Draco", Greg said in a gentle tone, gesturing towards the couch where Blaise and Theo were already sitting.
There was another silence between them.
"You do know that after we leave this room tomorrow morning, nothing is the way it used to be", Draco mumbled to Harry's ear, naked body pressed against his back.
"Well, maybe that is true. But what would I do without you? My life would be empty and boring, and I already know that I want to spend the rest of my life with you. So... what do you think?"
have you heard?" the Slytherin finally asked him, pretending to be calm, but Harry knew that he wasn't.
Harry ran a hand through his messy hair, letting out a sigh. Of course Malfoy had been there to see everything...
Harry let out a short laugh.
Harry didn't bother telling his best friend that he actually had a hangover because of yesterday's drinking and that he didn't feel like eating at all. He showered quickly and dressed up just as quickly, before venturing to the Great Hall to have some lunch with Ron. Harry had hoped to see Ginny there, too, but she wasn't there anymore.
"Uh… okay, come on in", he answered, feeling a bit nervous. What could it be that Hermione wanted to talk to him about, alone?
"No", Harry surprised both Draco and himself by saying, holding the other man's gaze in his own. "This time
"How about starting from what happened between you and the Weasley girl today?"
New tears flowed from Draco's eyes and he quickly wiped them away with his hand. "Well, that's changed", he said almost inaudibly. "Now he doesn't give a damn about
Harry let out a heavy sigh. "I… tried to make Ginny understand… I thought she would at least
"I know, I know", Narcissa said, blushing a little. "I just wanted you to know that there are options. I know Harry's the only child too so I assume he might want childr-"
Harry was nervously rubbing his forehead with his hand. "I'm so,
Half an hour had already passed since he and Theodore had come back from their detention, and Theodore had immediately went to Draco's room to have a chat with him for Harry. At least Harry had
"I...", Harry mumbled, completely stunned. "I'm
"Not friends. Just classmates", Draco said.
Harry felt his cheeks starting to heat up a little. "
"That's not true, you know", Harry said without missing a beat. "Your eyes are very nice too."
An hour later they had finally reached the King's Cross train station. Harry waited until he saw the Weasley family leaving (he didn't want Ginny to see him leaving with Malfoy), before he finally moved on. He soon saw the blond Slytherin standing at the other end of the station, dressed in his long, black winter coat. Malfoy was looking a little worried and abashed, glancing in every possible direction, searching for Harry. Harry realized that Malfoy must have seen Ron and Hermione already leaving without Harry.
"The best", Harry answered with a confident grin.
" he managed to ask. Shit, shit, shit. Hermione knew…
"You know,
He was floating. He was feeling full of life again.
"Night", Ron replied.
"Well, it's become quite obvious to us that she still very much wants to carry on with you", Ron continued before taking another quick sip of his coffee. "So what do you think about
The journey continued. What about those lips... They looked so plump, so soft. There was a bit of cocoa left unnoticed on the blond's upper lip and Harry immediately wanted to lick it away. Damn, he wanted this man, so
"Whatever", Malfoy cut him off, sighing tiredly. "If you've done your talking already, I'd like to get some sleep tonight, so if you don't mind...?" He got up and walked to his wardrobe next to the door and opened it, starting to undress himself sideways to Harry.
Soon Harry heard the voice of a chair being dragged against the floor, seeing Malfoy and Theodore both getting up at the same time. His eyes followed them as they quickly gathered all of their stuff and headed towards the bedroom corridor. Before entering it Malfoy delayed, glancing towards Harry as if he had felt his stare. Harry quickly looked away. When he finally looked back, Malfoy had already disappeared. Harry was drowning in his thoughts.
silencing charms", she said, winking. "Besides, the beds aren't even
A hoarse laugh escaped Harry's mouth as he rolled himself on top of the blond again, already incredibly turned on. He was more than willing to help Draco satisfy his hunger. This was going to be a long night.
Sometimes they were still sitting at the Great Hall next to each other and sometimes they were still studying together or changing a few words – but that was it. Things between them weren't the same anymore, they clearly weren't best friends like they used to be. Things had really changed after their "date-night", or whatever it had been. Harry still hadn't asked Malfoy about what had happened that night and the Slytherin hadn't opened up about it himself either, but something clearly had changed. Harry knew that Malfoy wouldn't have been crying that night and switching rooms the next day for nothing. It bothered Harry but he didn't dare to ask.
"It's called
Harry turned towards his girlfriend again, about to speak but Theodore was quicker than him.
"No, Draco, listen to me -"
Or I'm gone."
Malfoy was shaking his head. "No", he answered.
Hermione and Ron glanced at each other. Hermione still looked a bit shocked by his outburst.
"I will do my best, Mrs Malfoy", Harry said, taking a hold of his boyfriend's hand. Both Draco and his mum smiled at him.
"Not even with the Weasley girl?" Malfoy asked.
"You're spending the Christmas with
"Well, I figured that since we're going to spend the Christmas together at your place, perhaps it’s time for us to finally be on first-name basis as well..."
Harry didn't bother to say anything in return. He turned towards the door again, took a deep breath and let it out before knocking three times and entering Draco's room.
full of Malfoy. At nights he found himself constantly having dreams about him and he couldn't stop himself from masturbating to them afterwards. It was becoming a very bad habit for him. However, it wasn't just about lust. No, there was so much more to it. He really cared about the Slytherin, way more than he should have. He had become incredibly fond of the guy.
Harry, feeling very nervous, did as he was told. He slowly sat on the edge of the bed first and took off his glasses, leaving them on Malfoy's nightstand before finally lying down. He rolled himself next to the Slytherin who was lying on his side again. There was another awkward silence between them.
"You know...", Ginny cut his thoughts by whispering to his ear. "I heard that the room of requirement has finally been fixed…"
"Hi", he said with a smile, bending over to press a kiss to his boyfriend's cheek before taking a seat next to him.
Harry jumped. Ron was choking.
"Yeah", Harry answered, taking another swig of his beer before landing it on the table. He took a more comfortable posture on his chair, resting his eyes for a while. He heard Ron laughing at something Goyle had said.
Malfoy snorted. "Are you
it all was. This would definitely not be his last time bottoming, no way. He loved topping Draco, loved being in control, driving the other man crazy and making him scream, but he also loved this totally new experience: submitting himself, being completely under Draco's control, getting Draco the way that no one else had before, and never
Harry's eyes travelled to the wall where the Black family's old picture had been replaced by a large picture of him and Draco.
"I miss quidditch", he heard Ron say. "Maybe we should go play someday."
"Malfoy, I've been wondering", he started. Malfoy turned to look at him. "Is it true that you and Theo...?"
"Unless you'd like to...", Harry started, hesitating. It felt embarrassing to ask. "...you know... come with me?"
"Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow then... Oh, right, I almost forgot, what about that Saturday?" she asked.
too, it seems?" she finally said.
Oh Merlin. He had just had real sex for the first time. Not with his girlfriend but with his old rival, Draco Lucius Malfoy, and he had
They exchanged a very long, thorough kiss, fumbling and nibbling at each other's lips with care, pausing and just looking at each other in the eyes every now and then. Harry realized how much he really loved kissing the man. There were no words to describe it, it just felt so right and he wished he'd never have to stop doing it. He had
Draco was slowly walking towards Harry with a small, beautiful smile on his light pink lips, and Harry was totally out of words. Draco looked smashing. He looked like an angel - though he surely wasn't one - and Harry couldn't believe that
"Thanks, Ron", Harry answered dryly, taking a sip of his orange juice. "I couldn't sleep well. I was having horrible nightmares the whole night."
Harry didn't know what to think. "You treat him badly because he cares about you…? That doesn't make any sense to me."
"You're not making it any easier for him if you treat him like shit", Harry said. "You're only making it worse."
"Disgusting, eh?" Ron asked him, seeing the look on his face. "I wonder why they're not using any silencing charms? I guess they
"You and Ginny. You should go together to Hogsmeade or something. Anything."
genes?", the Slytherin asked. His eyes quickly wandered to Harry's unruly hair, and he grimaced. "Good
"God damnit, Harry, YES", Draco groaned in frustration. "Just give it to me
"Thanks", Harry answered, already walking towards the door. He was so relieved to finally get to explain everything to Draco.
"I really thought you've got some feelings towards him", Hermione admitted, looking embarrassed now. "I know how stupid it must sound to you… I do know you're with Ginny and you're not gay, so… I'm sorry."
Ron lifted his gaze from the floor.
He was observing Malfoy way too much, he was always watching the Slytherin secretly. His eyes, his lips, his hair, his body... everything about him. He liked the Slytherins voice, he liked his weird habbits... His head was
Malfoy was rolling his eyes. "
Harry grabbed his pyjamas next and sat to the edge of the bed, starting to tuck his feet in them, not answering. His head was so full of guilt right now that he was simply unable to speak. He was disgusted by himself and the terrible hangover was making it much worse. He let out a heavy sigh.
Harry moaned at that, his whole body shaking.
attention to his Chaser-girlfriend during the match. He had been too busy listening and watching
Harry let out a heavy sigh, burying his face in his hands. "I don't know, Ginny!" he said. "Like I said, there's nothing wrong with you, it's about me, I-"
"I do", the Slytherin said and they melted into another kiss.
about you and you can't even let your friends know about us?!"
Harry felt very angry at himself for getting caught. "I... uh...", he started, trying to think of any suitable reason for him to be just standing there, right in front of Malfoy and Theodore's door.
Ginny turned to look at him. "I'm busy now, Harry", she said.
Malfoy was, once again, looking as gorgeous as always and Harry had a hard time trying not to be caught staring at the very hot looking blond right across to him at the other side of the table. His thoughts kept returning back to the afternoon, how he had nearly kissed that stunning man today and almost gotten something more as well.
"With you", Harry cut him off, a gentle smile rising to his lips. "I thought I already made it obvious enough, but I'll say it one more time." The Slytherin raised his gaze again to look at him in the eyes. "You're the only one I want, Draco. I don't want anyone else but you."
"Shut the fuck up, Malfoy!"
The train ride towards Hogwarts went slowly. Harry kept chatting with his friends but his thoughts were on different matters. He kept staring out of the window at the passing scenery, thinking of what was waiting for him when they were to arrive at school.
Theodore was watching him mistrustfully for a while, before finally saying slowly: "So you didn't just want to have a little fun with Draco and then just... dump him."
Harry took a deep breath and let it out before starting. "Ginny, have you already forgotten what happened before Christmas?" he asked.
Harry turned to look at her, nonplussed. "You want to break up with me?!" he spluttered.
"You're ashamed of me", was all Draco said back, not looking at him.
Harry reached Malfoy soon and laid his hand on his shoulder. "Hey. What's up?" he asked.
Harry glared at his girlfriend. First she was talking about sleeping with her ex-boyfriend and now she was asking him to go to Hogsmeade with her?
Harry had never looked so angry and devastated at the same time. "I was worried
us to break up! That has probably been her biggest dream ever since I left her for you!"
"I know. It's alright", Malfoy said. "I tried to hex you first that day. Let bygones be bygones." He was still not looking at Harry. Instead his grey eyes were fixed on the flames of the fireplace.
"Well, that will have to change", Harry said, chuckling. "No dirty details to him, okay?"
"I'm on 8th grade. I can go to Hogsmeade whenever I want to", Harry pointed out.
"I know this comes as a huge shock to you, mum, but me and Harry... we're
Malfoy startled and quickly turned to look at him. For a second it seemed like the blond was relieved to see that it was Harry, which was very weird, but the look quickly faded away. Harry sat next to him.
"Just ask her. She's missing you", Hermione said.
Harry let out another heavy sigh, gaze on his moving feet. Theodore's words made him feel even more terrible. "But after today, he hates me. I wonder if he'll ever even talk to me again."
Draco glanced at his side where the love of his life was lying with his back turned towards him, his black hair looking all tangled, deep asleep. He wanted to move closer to Harry, to press against his warm, tanned body, to wrap his arm around him, to entwine their fingers and fall asleep against him... but he couldn't. Harry had already rejected him earlier. Harry didn't want to be near him anymore...
Theo sent him a glare. "Don't you
Harry, instead, was chatting with Hermione who was sitting next to him.
It was almost evening when the portrait door turned around and Theodore arrived, Goyle right behind him.
"Draco..." he groaned. "If you don't stop right now... I swear I'm gonna come..."
Would he be able to sort things out with Ginny this time? Was it even worth it anymore? To tell the truth, he didn't know if their relationship was going to work after all that had happened. Before the war it had all been so different with Ginny: lots of laughing together, lots of snuggling and kissing… It had felt so right. Whereas now… he wasn't so sure anymore. He wasn't sure

That's better.
And he's upset Gin what do you expect
Hermione set me up an account isn't she a sweetheart <3

I trust I have her to thank then
POTTER
and it's an absolute TRAVESTY don't u think

pansy?
Whomsttt the FUCK is that
.....so?
i mean... did u tell me
Ur so selfless <3
Trust me, I know
On my way :-)
What the fuck

Are you there
Library in five! We'll start from chapter 3 and work our way through.
Please don't
ron has not shut up all evening
That's fair
Wait what
yh mad suggestion ur right
bullshit but ok
Right, well. I'll see you later, Mr Potter. Hopefully in more desirable circumstances, I'm sure we can both agree?
look at you and harry
Well, thanks.
You'll give me a stroke
Nvm he blocked me
Nsjwiikdjdjd
Don't you remember what we were taught about social media?
Well. I did try to put it diplomatically.
It's just quite curly that's all
Funny that
fine. but you can't stay too late.
Please can you help us <3
Wtf why
wait what
morning wank.
My what now
I doubt Ginny even THINKS of Dean now she has you
Yeah trust me I won't
im not exactly spoilt for choice at hogwarts am i
Why is he even offended by that he could've been called much worse
I wouldn't dream of it.
KILL I MEANT KILL
I hate u both
Well, because you'll end up blacking out after one shot of firewhiskey, for starters.
I saw Harry's cock
pardon?
No Professor
To get pissed, yes
i did not!
Hey can you do mine too :-)
even the fucking first years hate me.
holy fuck the gryffindors r so easy to manipulate
Exactly
I don't think a heads up is necessary thx
So Harry is gay as well?
HARRY
fuckin hell dont expect too much at once
... Do you really want me to answer that
It's eleven o'clock in the morning!
don't tell me you believed longbottom.
Love u too
anywho this will put u in a gr8 mood
Ginny dared u to kiss me how do u not remember
and besides, he's scottish.
I'll bring some treacle tarts up later
Make that 25% men 75% women
You can't be mean to me I had a traumatic childhood :-(
changed the chat name to
I can't do any stupid shit after the fight, sorry
Funny you should say that
Having a wank
How much for the essay
convenience, that's all. we'd all be better off without them.
Groupchat? Beginning of the year? Your pledge to the Gryffindors?
If any of the Slytherins so much as lay a finger on Harry they'll be sent straight to Azkaban. Pansy's not a complete idiot.
You what
i'm literally ten seconds away from leaving this chat
Seamus kissed me
Would you like the truth or a poorly concealed lie
potter r u actually queer or wot
Their what now
yh but ur both boring
Let him have his dramatic teenage breakup moment Hermione
is typing...
Since when did you all need alcohol to have a good time?
alright so. my attempt at incorporating angst into a text fic is fucking LAMENTABLE but here u go!!!! also thank you for all the luvverly jubbly comments i appreciate every single one of them!!!! here is some actual interaction between draco and harry as a treat
bless u
Aren't these new mobile phones brilliant?
i dont need to someone posted the vid on snapchat
his what?
everyone hates us
oh and someone put one of those filters on u
Alright. But don't blame me when we descend into anarchy.
You know
Yes. It's called bisexuality.
Seamus kissed me
or draco
Now THAT'S homosexual
WHY DIDN'T YOU LISTEN THEN
She's probably still lurking
What message? I didn't see any message
Anyone else nearly finished :(
what?
I sent mine in weeks ago sir did you not get it
FILTHY SLANDEROUS LIES
I don't. Obviously.
I wouldn't count on that mate she keeps worming her way into the Sodomy chat
no i genuinely think ive just gone into shock
and i think it might be contagious so it's best you don't visit me
Ron mate are u okay
Drinking? On the school grounds?
You're handsome as fuck you absolute idiot
SINCE WHEN YOU NEVER SAID
sent a video
Wait are you breaking up with him
Yeah, that's even worse
50% attracted to men, 50% attracted to women
Debatable.
Here we go again.
promise me u guys won't ever break up
I SAID I LOVE YOU
I hate you all with a burning passion
is he scarred for life?
Yes, but Harry's supposed to be working on controlling his temper.
u may b a stupid cunt but he's a FUCKING cunt
save it, pansy. believe me, i've heard it all already.
yeah i think u need to get that fixed
exactly
At least I know what the epiphany was all about now.
You're not remotely edgy
I kind of kissed back
removed
does kissing other blokes not strike you as a bit gay
As long as you don't stare at my arse or anything
cant even trust them to embellish an essay
Anyway stop avoiding my questions what's going on
Thanks !
What the fuck squared
changed the chat name to
WHAT DID HE DO WHATS HAPPENING
Excuse me?
He speaks!
anyway i thought u guys were friends
Wait do you actually think he's gay
bc ur a raging homosexual
unusually wise words ron thanks
I'll find pity elsewhere
What no
alright well ur dads gone viral
Salt and vinegar ftw
clearly i was mistaken
what? no i didn't
Lmfao when have we ever done that
I was asking Hermione
*cough*
don't say it like that!
Ha yeah he keeps accidentally liking my tweets
so when you were all shrieking like fishwives because youd been locked in the dungeon.... that was all part of your impeccably construed plan ?
the war's over n im done being miserable i want dick
potter really is a blithering idiot
I hate you
Why would he do that?
worth a try
She can be a bit rubbish in the comforting department
im so sorry this is probably utter rubbish but it's very fun to write so <3
yeah about that
people buy those unironically??
named the chat
How did you miss it? Pretty much the entire year group saw.
changed
Hello?
besides i have an EXCELLENT plan
Is that Finnigan ew
please don't ruin it.
surely it'll be alright if it's just pansy
The fuck is a phlejgm
Why didn't you break up with him when he kissed me????
Shit ur gorgeous
it's a type of muggle tv show
Nah I voted labour
Seamus I am in dire need of firewhiskey
He's not wrong tho
Just do it
Do you want to join him, Potter?
you literally said you liked it
? You're welcome, I guess.
Tf is a death eater doing with a mobile phone anyway
And what's with the username? Does your ego know no bounds?
It probably won't matter if the rest of the year's there as well
Where are you??
It's morning, dear.
Yes, Professor
OH lmfao
hermione.
i doubt they will anyway every1s still talking abt the weaselette's gay boyfriend
I'm doing the same
what fucking r ight do u have to kiss boys
I'm coming
theres no fuckin way the whole of eighth year is getting pissed n im not going 2 be there

Actually uh. We may b down half a bottle of firewhiskey

Alright who's down

Fanks !
Let me reiterate: WHAT THE FUCK

Yeah he only has like 10 followers though
aw thats cute
Cor thanks
o so ur bisexual
good night.
left the chat
Yeah me 2 thx
that may well be impossible
Alright keep ur hair on
No, Neville's right. She won't try anything.
Why was he crying?
And that obsessing over all-male groups probably indicates that he's not completely straight.
snapethesnake
The sex is fucking great as well
Parkinson literally tried to have Harry killed we can't invite her
WHAT ATTEMPT WHEN
Being a murderer is edgy?
Definitely good
Wasn't it lovely?
You're welcome!
Fucking hell
back to potter!!
Hermione?
Ron? Are you still here?
i never lie
just out of interest
i should just give up and go home at this point. clearly no one wants me at hogwarts and this will just make it even worse.
Please dont beat malfoy up I dnt think i can stand up to watch proeprly
it hardly matters if u snog a bloke lol
frankly, i couldn't care less whether they live or die.
i mean, hello.
Sodomy chat.
RIGHT everyone shut up the fuck up a minute
Anyway, onto the matter at hand: I do recall asking you to issue an apology to Mr Potter.
So you're coming then
aaaand the fighting recommences
anyway we should follow them i want to know what's happening in their little soap opera
No points from Slytherin then?
and u dont want to know the weird ass stuff he's asked me to do
You're all totally irresponsible.
I love you too. :-)
Ah, Potter. Come in.
aw shit is it alright
anyway i mean it
sorry ! got held up
wait people actually listen 2 the smiths?
Correction: everyone hates YOU. I don't do anything wrong.
What's RIGHT with take that
You just spent ten minutes arguing and now you're helping each other?
Bit contrary isn't it
lol good luck he left the chat hours ago
Ahahahahha
Fine. Library in five.
oh so Draco Lucius Malfoy with an abhorrent amount of emojis in their bio isn't you then
U fuck off u massaged me
Sounds like a load of bollocks to me
I said I was sorry
No no I'll get it done
he won’t actually DO it. he’s said the same thing about five times now. he's just worried i'll fuck up and we'll all land ourselves in azkaban.
i mean if i had a cock i wouldn't be putting it anywhere near someone's arse but each to their own
But you're very traumatised. And this probably isn't helping.
(See the end of the chapter for
hermione's been teaching me
created a new chat
You're still going to the party?
Reckon we've got about half an hour till Hermione realises we've gone so.... meet you in five?
****WE'RE all youve got
Harry punching Malfoy in the face.
What's wrong with Harry
No it must be eating into his mobile data
and blaise now owes me 20 galleons so im chuffed
fuckin hell ur dad hasnt caught wind of it already
The boy who lived a pouf... what an interesting turn of events
.... Yeah sure
Wait can u add him back I've got something to say as well
we've literally never spoken besides the time in third year when u hexed me for no reason
i'm fine thanks :)
I'll b a valuable ally in ur homosexual escapades
What's wrong with Take That?
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
Do you think he still fancies her
You did overdo it a bit with the enthusiasm Mione
No not the ferret
If we're going to have to deal with the Slytherins for several hours we're going to have to be PROPER fucked
draco shut up i literally caught u listening 2 the pet shop boys the other week
you gullible idiot :)
I've got edibles ;)
Aye you heard about Malfoy's Twitter
he doesn't go to school full stop he's got an engineering apprenticeship
Right. Yes.
Yeah he's really sick sir
fuck off, it's edgy
Hermione how much to get my essay done
Scary stuff
contact name to
absolutely not.
bagsy me be the new leader
to the chat
Please change that fucking chat name
i'm beside myself with excitement.
Well, I for one accept you whoever you're attracted to, Harry. When do you plan on coming out?
Thx ;-)
Didn't have u down as the type to listen to The Cure sir
What?
Your arse is nonexistent so no issue there
is typing
Malfoy isn't queer?????
He literally snogged you at that Christmas party last year
Missing the point
..... I said EXCUSE ME?
Have u forgiven me then
I'm straight
Are u any good at potions then
Good morning, Mr Malfoy.
Ponce
Fuck if I know
The fuck are u talking about
You're looking rather pensive, Ginny. Are you feeling alright?
has any1 ever told u youve got lovely eyes
hello pls excuse the het at the beginning we need 2 build up to harry's ~homosexual awakening~. also nudes.
... Deal
YES I SAID I DID
created a new chat
Pleeeeease
Where are you :-(
... And then he's surprised when people call him a cunt
yeah it was hot as fuck
it was nothing to do with my 'pureblood bullshit' and everything to do with the fact that all his friends are complete arses.
Shut up, Ronald.
in fact i havent the faintest idea what ur talking abt
Yes? Obviously?
he isn't it's on his story
Whatever that means
No, it doesn't follow in real life - you'll still be able to talk to him in person.
ur fucking impossible
Sounds great. You might want to turn off the caps lock button though :-)
No not like that
I'm sure you'll tell us anyway
If ur planning on smuggling food from the dinner table can u bring extra treacle tarts
You know what I'd rather she hadn't
so much easier than sending sexy pictures via owl
Strange
Have any of you guys seen Harry?
so i was thinking
As you said, everyone hates us
Please add me 2 the sodomy chat
Not a clue
....... no comment
Well, I certainly never came to that conclusion myself.
merlin's beard
added
I thought we agreed to stop the gentle stalking, Mione
love u too
fuck off
You know what she'll say Ron
YOURE MAKING ME LAUGH
You should be taking the opportunity to begin your assignment!
Good on him
It won't take a minute
What the fuck is a no homo
anyway i didn't say yes i said maybe
Have you not figured out where the capital letter button is on the keyboard
SHE has a name
Probably just a phase or something lol
it won't let me message him, professor. his name doesn't come up in my contacts anymore.
its actual gold
Then he brought up Fred and Harry punched him in the face
however will u cope
added
How come he gets special treatment tf
Exactly I'm the eye candy
i must've accidentally pressed a button or something. i can't get rid of it now.
pansy parkinson called me a fag hag earlier
Right
Sounds right up my alley ;-)
Oh wait u did actually tweet it
What a cunt
Why are you surprised
nothing, sir.
Five likes already baby
how do u think lol
AND u went all fucking pureblood on him
It's becoming a bit of an epidemic
You've gone completely batty haven't you
Dont let them see me yet im hiding in the loos
you better not have smiled back.
Alright hear me out
oooo rite i c
No comment.
For fucks sake
as expected
Yeah, emphasise on sometimes.
aw they're still scared of us
NO WAY THATS BRILLIANT
fuckin hell
I wouldn't worry, Ginny.
so why did snape tell me that he's just received several essays that are word for word copies of mine?
Mind you, he has had an AWFUL past year.
oooh the ellipses are out
Thank you for that insight, Ronald.
How do they joke about gays then, enlighten me
CONGRATS!!!!!
PLEASE
DETENTION.
Gangrene
The whole typing in lowercase thing
Why not :-(
but what if im holding him back or whatever
im all youve got darling it would do u good to at least pretend to be a decently civilised human being
you're excused !
Did he apologise?
As if you haven't been doing that for the past eighteen years?
Wot Draco
hes already started drinking hasnt he
He's so much better looking than I am
do u not know how time works darling
YEFUCKING WHAT
Yes, but I figured we'd just have the meeting via text.
oh right
But I'm still going
Alright I've got something to tell you
I said love you!
draco, please kindly remove the stick from ur arse n return to the chat in a better mood
Please don't
Ron calm down
Trust me he's not
Harry, I know you're reading these.
if worse comes to worse youll have to ask granger
Are you even listening to me?
You mean you could have done it yourself on the first day of term but Ginny got in there first.
What was what
Well, the offer still stands. My weekly sessions are doing me no end of good.
Don't tell me. Tell your therapist.
Reading
I literally have a girlfriend
Lol good luck
Alright look
Fuck off
no that's what they called him
wtf ur 18
Speaking of
HARRY :D
That's right
I know what you've been through, Harry. So please, just this once, leave justice in the very capable hands of your Professors.
NEVILLE
Anyway, Mr Potter. We need to have a chat about certain incidents that occurred this morning.

He was defending us
.....nvm
Please keep all euphemisms out of the group chat WITH OUR PROFESSOR IN IT.
long time no see
Mate you did say that
okay.
Nothing unsanitary about taking a shit we all do it
Yeah sure
Not yet

He was very off on Saturday as well. I put it down to a hangover but his behaviour yesterday evening just clinches my suspicions.

How do you know it's me?
Well spotted
Bisexual, Ron.
O shit do u not remember
But it suits you so well

..... Friday afternoon
Rather clever too. She's just annoyed you into agreeing to a therapy session.

Yeah you can sod right off with that idea
right. how many people have you sent my essay to?
Alright I'm done.
I'll just ignore it until it doesn't affect me anymore
I would've done it myself only I don't particularly want to touch him
but alas the friendly feelings weren't reciprocated
IM NOT
They are fuckin stupid they're all death eaters
YEAH THATS ENOUGH THANKS
And he keeps retweeting those emo quotes from Tumblr
Just as soon as Hermione wakes up because I can't make the account by myself
I don't even want to think about kissing you ever again

Boys! What did I say about drinking on weekdays?
Sir can u please unblock me on Twitter
Please don't break up with me

Shit she's got you there
I wouldn't leave Hermione to comfort you alone
Agreed. Malfoy's a prick.
Anyway, why do you care if Seamus is gay?
Seriously how the fuck do you keep getting in this chat
Ahem.
wait what
His dad
What's ur @ I'll follow u
u dont do anything full stop u just stand there looking all moody n shit
It means he has prevented you from having any connection with him.
Whatever. I'll be waiting for you in the library afterwards.
Yeah yeah I get it
Right
You're so charming <3
right.
you know what my problem is.
so i saw potter and weasel sloping off earlier looking rather worse for wear
What do you think
Now, Potter, it would hardly be appropriate for you to earn yourself an exclusion two weeks into your first term, would it?
How do you know about that?
Sod off
He's got 18 followers now bless him
left the chat
I just expected a little more gratitude after we collectively saved your arses last year.
honestly u don't have to be so jealous
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN
yes. always.
Sick !!!
i didn't SPIT, i'm not an animal.
well, draco is a stubborn fuck so i figured id hurry things along a bit
OHAND HARRY I BELIEVE CONTRACEPTION IS IN ORDER
They have wifi in azkaban???
Nah invite as many people as possible this is gonna b MAJOR
Really?
Idk his parents prejudiced wankers
No, believe it or not, it's got worse since then
Now's our chance to go to Hogsmead and get absolutely plastered
added
I would but Hermione is fucking terrifying
It's pretty sickening
draco darling you really are useless w muggle technology
Neville were u rlly completely silent for like 3 days only to return to proclaim ur dedication to the Romione ship
What the FUCK are you supposed to have in common with Malfoy
Just fuck off makfoy haven't u done enough
Blimey
Look, it's not that big of a deal, is it? You share a dorm with four other boys, it's only natural that it would happen at some point.
What about Malfoy? He started it.
Their names are next to each other in my contacts
U know
u coming?
anyway so u down ;)
Right.
well he's right
alright i apologised
I don't think he's completely fine
Thank u so fucking much ur a literal. Angel bless u I love u

Wait what's she doing here??
did u just say please?
I think there are far more important matters at hand.
and yet ur still using it to text me right now
but i've only had one warning!
Something is seriously wrong with Harry.
Good luck baby <3
why would he do that?
named the chat
potter's queer
Shall I save valuable time and dish out the detention now?
Harry was nervously fiddling with his unruly fringe. "What do you think?" he asked.
Harry had thought that Draco would dislike being at Grimmauld Place because, after all, Draco was a very neat, meticulous and systematic person. However, Harry was surprised to see that the Slytherin actually seemed to enjoy being there, or then he just didn't let his dislike show. Draco was looking like he felt right at home.
with you. I tried to get your attention in any possible way – but it didn't work."
Malfoy tensed right away. "I bet he has..."
He had been watching the film for half an hour already when he heard the Slytherin's confused voice behind the couch he was sitting on.
Harry hesitated for a while before he walked to the bed, sitting down on the edge, sideways to Malfoy.
Draco lifted his gaze, looking at him with an unreadable look on his pale face. "Really? You think so?"
Harry's sentence was left unfinished when he noticed a familiar, diabolical grin on the Slytherin's face. "What?" he asked.
Harry hadn't been cheating on him. Harry loved him and still wanted to marry him and have a family with him...
There was a short silence between them, until Harry finally started to shake with laughter.
"It's a simple question", Malfoy said pungently.
"Then why did you kiss her?" Theodore asked sharply.
ruined everything?!" Ginny hissed back at him. "Would you finally mind telling me what is going on here?!"
"Draco?" Greg said, sounding very worried. "What has happened?"
Oh god... He was nothing but a vile, immoral, sickening human being. He'd have to go. He'd have to go
felt like this with Ginny. To be honest, kissing Ginny felt like nothing compared to this and it really worried Harry.
”Harry, do you still need that book or can i get it back already? Harry? HARRY.”
"Well..." Malfoy was trying to find the right words. "I thought… if you
"Oh, right", Harry said, forcing his lips to a wide grin. "It was nothing, really."
"I guess", Hermione answered thoughtfully. "If we won't be too late..."
He closed his eyes again, just relaxing and enjoying the warm closeness of the man next to him. Everything felt so right. He was almost starting to fall asleep again...
"Well", he started. "In my opinion, the last thing that you should do right now is to go back home and keep on grieving because of that prick."
"I never would have thought that he'd do something like this", he said quietly, his voice already hoarse from all the crying and talking. "I know he has already cheated once before, with me, but... I didn't think that he would do the same to me. He said he loved me."
Ginny shook her head. "No, I haven't. But didn't you read the card I sent you with the present?"
They finally took their own places at the front, under the arch, and it was time for the man from the ministry, Samuel Rivers, to start the wedding ceremony.
"And he deserves it", Ginny cut him off. Her voice was now cold as ice. "Who cares? He deserves everything he gets!"
Harry shook his head. "Of course there isn't!" he said. "What made you think that I would cheat on you, after all we've been through? Don't you trust me at all?"
Draco had stared at her warm brown – but still so cold – eyes in silence, eyes that reflected how much hatred she still felt towards him.
"KEEP your hands OFF me,
"I don't know", Harry said, shrugging. "I guess I suck at lying. She saw right through me and seemed to be happy for us."
There was a knock on the door.
Harry could smell the lovely, spicy scent of Malfoy's cologne. Being so close to the other man for the first time, holding and smelling him was driving him crazy and he wanted to press his lips against that beautiful pale skin. He wanted to kiss him so damn much. He had
"Didn't sound like one!" Ron hissed. "But for
He took a deep breath, trying to get a hold of his nerves, moistened his fingers well with the lube and slowly pressed one of them against Draco's entrance, pushing it in.
Harry was looking at the picture with a blank face. He remembered when Hermione had taken that photo of him and Ginny. They had still been so happy during those days.
Hermione let out a laugh. "Well", she said thoughtfully. "If he
"Oh... I fell asleep", Harry said.
for this and you just...
"No", Harry replied, shaking his head. He pressed a quick kiss to the other man's lips before saying: "Merry Christmas, Draco."
and now you're saying you can't do this?! I've been waiting for weeks, months,
Harry lifted his gaze, meeting Hermione's eyes.
Malfoy was quiet for a while, absorbing what he had just heard.
After they had finally been too exhausted to continue, they had once again laid in each others arms, just kissing and looking at one another, no talking, until finally falling asleep. They hadn't talked about actual love out loud yet, but that didn't matter. Harry already knew what he felt for the other man, and he could see from the look in the Slytherin's eyes that he felt the same way towards him. The actual three words weren't needed yet. It was love, and there was nothing indistinct about it.
, but we've only been together like -"
There was a short silence between them all, apart from all the screams and hoorays around them, before Hermione surprised them all.
"Well, she
think Harry's done the right thing", she said, surprising both Harry and Ron with her words. "They were both supposed to spend the Christmas on their own, so it's nicer to spend it together, right?"
, Draco answered. "I'm sorry for believing anything she said to me. But you were acting so weird, so distant all the time. We were fighting all the time, you didn't want to have sex with me, not even be close to me! I was like air to you and then you didn't even come home anymore..." He couldn't stop the tears flowing out of his eyes again. "I thought you were having an affair with some colleague of yours. That you didn't want me anymore."
Their positions were soon reversed as Draco suddenly decided to roll them around and kiss him hard, starting to move his lips along Harry’s body next. Harry didn't mind at all. Draco's eagerness aroused him more than anything. The other man's lips were kissing every part of his upper body, giving him shivers.
"So… we could go somewhere together", she started again. "Maybe… have some butterbeers at Hogsmeade or something."
made the first move by trying to kiss me earlier, before Granger interrupted us."
There was a short silence before Malfoy spoke again. "Well, see you tomorrow."
wanted to.
Harry turned towards the crowd again, his eyes swiping through the quests. His eyes widened when he recognized someone who he had definitely not expected to come, despite sending him an invitation. But there he was, his cousin Dudley, looking a little lost at the hall full of witches and wizards, sitting at the last row with his brown haired girlfriend. He had clearly lost a lot of weight since Harry had last seen him. Harry's and Dudley's eyes met for a short while and they both gave a short nod to each other before Dudley turned to his girlfriend again.
break my promises, so..."
"Who cares", Harry said calmly. "She can send me anything, but it won't change a thing."
"What the hell is the matter with you?! I LOVE you, you fucking idiot!"
"I... I can't answer that", Harry muttered. He heard Malfoy sneer again.
"I'm a cold, selfish, heartless arsehole", Harry said to his husband with a sigh.
Once again, Draco heard Ginny Weasley's cold words in his head, telling him that sooner or later Harry would get tired of him as well and look for someone else instead... someone better than him.
"Where THE HELL have you been?!"
Draco was scowling at him defiantly and Harry was scowling right back at him for a while, until he grabbed the Slytherin by the shoulders and slammed him hard against the sink, kissing him roughly. Draco kissed him back just as fiercely, his hands immediately starting to rip Harry's clothes off, and Harry didn't mind. Their argument had reminded him of their earlier school years and his cock was already hard from arousal – and he could feel that the same thing had happened to Draco as well.
He kept caressing the platinum hair for a while, until he finally wrapped his other hand around the other man as well, pulling him tighter against his own body. Malfoy's grip around him tightened as well and Harry smiled sadly, the held back tears finally streaming from his eyes. He would cherish this night forever, because tonight would be the last time he could hold Malfoy like this.
him, or was he going to, in the future?
"You could have just
Harry had gotten a lot of nice presents from his friends and the Weasleys and while Draco didn't have as many presents as Harry, they were a lot more expensive than his. Draco had soon went through his own presents and just sat there on the couch, observing Harry as he still had two last presents left.
An hour passed since Ginny had left and it was already midnight, but still neither of them seemed to have any intention to leave the room just yet. They still hadn't said a word to each other, either. Harry had to admit that it was starting to feel a bit annoying since the same thing happened almost every night. Why was it like this? They used to argue and mock each other all the time in the past, and now it seemed like they didn't have anything to say to each other anymore. Harry wasn't afraid of Malfoy or anything, but he just didn't know what to talk with him about. However, this was their final school year and after that they wouldn't probably ever see each other again, so perhaps it didn't even matter.
The group walked farther into the room, and they were obviously here to mess with Draco, because all twelve eyes were dead set on him, and nothing else.
. Even though he had said so otherwise yesterday, he now thought the charm did not seem that hard. Draco had read everything there was to know about it in the defensive spells book he had found it in. He was tempted to try it out himself and show Potter how easy it was, but he was certainly not tempted to risk his probation.
“But you wrote that letter and had that vision when we had already become friends, Draco. You know that. Don’t make excuses.”
It was weird to think that a couple days ago, Draco had let Potter lead him to Transfigurations. Not even giving a second thought about trailing behind him. Now, it felt like he had to show Potter he was confident, and knew what he was doing. It might have been because of the little quip Potter had made earlier about Draco being a prejudiced Death Eater, but he wasn’t sure.
that came from the other side of the library. Potter was frozen in place as his line of sight went to the far corner. The corner was now surrounded in smoke, and the smell of burnt wood traveled over to Draco.
Before he left, someone squeezed his hand tightly.
“Whoa is right.”
“I don’t want to hear that word. I’m not a hero.”
“Do you care to tell me the details of what happened last night?” She said to him.
“Oh.” Draco was still blushing. “Well after Azkaban and before Hogwarts this summer, I got a couple Muggle outfits. I don’t know, I thought they were quite fashionable really.”
anyone knew, whether it be false or correct information.
He was horrified to find that there were tears forming in his eyes. He had made a vow to himself he would never cry again, not since Potter had found him weeping in the bathroom, and he hadn’t broken that vow, and he wouldn’t break it now. He was just extremely tired, and needed a good night's sleep.
“You’re going to be okay. Just hold still.” He felt a rush of coolness travel through him, twisting its way throughout every inch of his body. She had apparently cast some sort of healing spell, though he didn’t hear which one; she must have done it nonverbally. Even though he was already starting to feel better, and his eyesight was now back to normal, he felt like shit. His arm was still numb, and his chest and head throbbed an excruciating amount.
“Yes, of course,” Harry said, and he repeated the process, raising his wand and speaking the charm.
Draco rolled his eyes, and hoped Harry could see the movement through the darkness. “Yes, Harry, I’m sure.” Although, that time, Draco was lying. It wasn’t because of his Mark, but because of all the thoughts swirling in his mind about Harry.
“I am,” Drys agreed, firing spell after spell. “I’ll start where I left off.
Draco was fuming now. “Where’s Harry? Have you done anything to him? Did you hurt him?!”
“I made the chair disintegrate.” It came out in a sort of choked whisper, but Draco heard it perfectly clear nonetheless.
Okay. It would be fine. Perfectly fine. It was just one Potions class, how bad could it really be?
Before they traveled back into unbearable silence once more, Draco pocketed all of his items, placing back on the charm that was used to make the glassy, flower-entraping-crystal-ball a smaller size. He then asked Harry all the details regarding what happened to Alec, and all the dead Death Eaters, along with Drys.
“We’re very different. I think that the only reason you think that is because we both went through the same war and came out mentally scathed.”
“Alright, then. Maybe your body has just given up on trying to make you miserable,” Draco added.

bed- which made his heart ache painfully. He’d become so weak for Harry. Moping about his clothes on top of red sheets. But he wouldn’t trade being weak for the one he loved, for anything in the world.
"Malfoy, hi", Harry said, now standing behind the other man, causing Malfoy to jump a bit and quickly turn to look at him.
Theodore said, rolling his eyes.
Soon Draco realized that their time spent together had already lessened to only about half of what it had used to be before. They had used to go for long walks together, they had used to go to movies, bars, restaurants, clubs... they had used to do lots of things together. But now they only had like two or maximum three hours daily to do stuff together and they hardly even left the house anymore.
"Detention", McGonagall snapped. "Both of you. Starting RIGHT NOW."
"I haven't changed my mind", he said softly, pressing a quick kiss to the other man's beautiful lips. "I love you and I can't wait to marry you."
Harry was supposed to spend the Christmas at the Burrow with the Weasley family but he wasn't really looking forward to that. For Harry, the forthcoming winter break only meant not being able to see Malfoy for two long weeks.
"Would you like to be on top?" he whispered against the Slytherin's lips.
Malfoy gave him a bashful smile, making Harry feel weak in his knees. He was looking at the Slytherin's beautiful smile, feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. Damn how much he loved that smile.
"Well, don't."
"The others boys kept going on and on about their sexual fantasies with different girls, talking about boobs and stuff... Not me. My biggest fantasy was to be taken by The Boy Who Lived
"Have you even
"You won't hurt me", Draco answered. "Got any lube here?"
Just thinking about the possibility of Harry being in love with someone else, making love to some other man or woman instead of him... Draco's heart felt like being ripped out of his chest at the thought. He loved Harry so much that it hurt, but Harry clearly didn't feel the same way towards him.
Draco was sitting in a relaxed position, once again dressed in entirely black clothes that enhanced his gorgeous body all too well. His hair wasn't as groomed as it had been earlier today, it was already hanging loosely around his face and Harry loved that look. He remembered how attractive Draco had looked the morning after their sexual encounter few weeks ago, his hair all messy. As much as he loved the way that Draco always put effort to his looks, he also loved seeing him all natural which didn't happen very often. Draco was always beautiful in Harry's eyes.
"Don't!" he said hoarsely, not able to face the other man right now. He walked to the door and left Malfoy's room without one glance backwards. Closing the door behind him, he found himself heading straight to the bathroom to throw up.
After what felt like an hour, Draco had finally finished talking. He had told his friends nearly everything that had happened past few weeks between himself and Harry, and finally he had told about his and Ginny Weasley's meeting as well.
bastard!"
"Potter, don't tell me you… You didn't
Just like Harry, Draco was also wearing black dress robes and a white shirt under them, but his satin bow tie was silvery colour. The robes fit his tall and thin body perfectly. His platinum blond hair was rigorously set with a side swept fringe. Though Harry had been slightly disappointed when Draco had decided to cut his almost shoulder length hair a lot shorter before their wedding day, he wasn't anymore.
Then Harry’s lips found their way to Draco's neck instead of his mouth, nibbing and sucking his skin, grabbing his silky hair a little roughly at the same time, but Draco didn't mind. He loved it when Harry played a little rough on him. In the end the other man concentrated on leaving red marks on his pale skin and Draco was shuddering with growing desire.
Harry sighed again. He took off his glasses and rubbed his forehead and eyes with his hands. He could feel the other man's eyes boring into him.
He remembered the Quidditch match that had been played between Gryffindor and Slytherin in late April. He had hated Draco so much for cheating so outrageously, suddenly rushing from behind and grabbing at his Firebolt, causing the Snitch to escape. Harry had spent the rest of the match annoying the boy as much as he could.
Harry felt lost for words. He had spent his whole Christmas break with Draco, mostly doing everyday things, so he didn't have much to tell his friends.
Harry, however, shook his head defiantly. "Don't tell me what to do. I do what I want. I thought you had grown up already, but you're still the same dickhead as always. You really don't change, do you?"
Harry's sad and angry face turned to very confused in seconds. "Get rid of you?!" he repeated, totally perplexed by Draco's words. "Why the hell would I want to get rid of you?! You mean
"Hey, speaking of brooms, the match starts soon. Are you guys coming?" he asked quickly.
Harry's eyes widened as he suddenly remembered…
"Mm hmm", Draco said, moving even lower on his body. Harry's underpants were soon lowered and fingers were closing around his hard cock. "You have no idea how long I've wanted to do this to you", Harry heard him whispering.
"Draco -"
, he remembered Harry whispering against his neck just few nights ago after they had finished making love in their huge double bed. Hearing the words that night had melted his heart and made him feel like the happiest man alive, but now... having heard that Harry used to say the same words to Ginny as well, and to know what he still had ended up doing behind her back...
To Harry's surprise, Malfoy actually did beat him this time. Today was clearly not Harry's day. The Snitch escaped him a total of seven times. Secondly, Malfoy kept deliberately misleading him. All the time. Just like he had used to do for years. But this time Harry also found himself getting distracted by how Malfoy’s body moved on his broom in a whole new way.
as well, but you never knew for sure because it
I didn't mean it like that", Harry answered quickly, but the Slytherin had already nudged him aside, continuing his journey without him.
Harry turned to look at the other man, frowning. "Why would you help me? You hate me."
Goyle was standing at Theodore and Malfoy's open door, holding his wand high in the air. Harry saw pieces of furniture floating in the air in front of him.
"Combining
When they finally left the bar and arrived back to the 12 Grimmauld Place, Harry instantly lunged at Draco, took off his trousers, lifted him against the wall and roughly fucked him right there, Draco's slim legs wrapped around his waist, wanting to make sure that the blond knew it was Harry who he belonged to. Afterwards he apologized to Draco for his behaviour but the Slytherin only told him that Harry's possessiveness over him simply aroused him more.
Only after a minute or so, Harry was already getting very close. Draco's lips and tongue were moving on his member so pleasurably that his whole body was trembling uncontrollably and his hands were squeezing the sheets so hard his knuckles were white. How could Draco be so damn good at this?!
"Yes!" Draco cried. "Don't stop. Fuck me, Harry!"
He was feeling a little embarrassed standing there and suddenly being all romantic. It was not familiar to him, he had never discussed this deeply with Ginny or with anyone else. And this was
"You didn't?" he asked quietly.
"What is the meaning of this?! Care to explain yourselves?" Headmistress McGonagall demanded to know. She was really furious. "I've never seen anything like this, and right after starting a feast!"
"What?" he quickly asked, turning to look at his best friend. Now, instead of just Malfoy, everyone else was watching him too.
Harry shook his head. "No, we're not friends", he said quietly.
"...I thought he'd want to go out too because it's Friday", he tried to correct his mistake. "And Blaise of course."
"Just for the record, I'm NOT going to be your dirty little secret when we're back there! I will NOT be Harry Potter's private slut!"
"I know", Malfoy said, grimacing dramatically. "It's fucking crazy! And the saddest thing of all is that I'm kind of looking forward to it. I mean, how pathetic is
Soon Harry's eyes wandered to the blond Slytherin sitting next to him. The other man was sitting so near that Harry was able to actually smell his scent. There was this woody, spicy aroma floating around the blond. And something else, like... Harry tried to recognize the smell. Something like a slightest hint of vanilla, but still somehow masculine.
After his realization Harry had a hard time trying to sleep that night. All he could think about was Malfoy and how he had fallen for the guy. The whole thing was so crazy! He had never thought about any other guy
Harry was startled by his own thoughts, coming back to his senses. What was he thinking? He had a
Malfoy didn't answer anymore.
"Malfoy and Goyle came there later", Harry continued.
Theodore Nott was standing only few meters away from them and obviously waiting for someone, immediately laying his eyes on Harry and Draco as they walked by.
"Oh f-fuck...", Harry heard the other man groaning as he was eagerly sucking on the Slytherin's throat and rubbing their crotches together at the same time.
There was no doubt about it. He was going to spend the rest of his life making Draco happy.
"Draco, whenever you're ready", Rivers said, and Goyle hurried to pass the parchment for the nervous looking Draco. Draco rolled it open, quietly cleared his throat and started to read.
Draco was about to answer, when he heard a familiar voice calling out from the living room: "Who is it?!"
"I'm not", Harry said. "I'm really, really sorry, Ginny. I don't know how or when it happened, but it did and... I've fallen in love with him."
Sex with Draco was mind-blowing. It was powerful, it was passionate, it was kinky, it was intense. Their sexual chemistry was indescribable and they couldn't get enough of each other. Draco was the only person Harry'd had sex with, but he was already certain that he would never be able to have anything similar with someone else. And he didn't even want to experience this with anyone else, only with Draco.
betray and hurt her like this. And still, here he was in bed with someone else, naked, and with another man, no less. Okay, he may have been very drunk last night but that was no excuse. He had loved every second he spent with Malfoy and, to be honest, he even wished to be able to do it again, and not just kissing and masturbating together. He wished he could have more than that, go all the way with him.
The only thing that bothered him was that he had never slept with anyone else before. He was so inexperienced and he knew very little about sex between two men. He knew something about sex with girls but this... this was a very different case. He was afraid of making a total fool out of himself in front of Draco. Or even worse: hurting him. He did not want to cause any pain to the man he had learned to care about so much. Draco had already suffered enough because of him.
that, Weasley", Draco announced from the kitchen, his voice showing no interest in Ron's opinion of him whatsoever.
with him, you dumbass!"
Harry frowned. "Of course I mean it!" he grunted.
Even Draco Malfoy and Harry had finally made silent peace with each other. They still weren't friends or anything remotely close to that, but they also didn't hate each other so much anymore. Harry had testified for the Malfoy family soon after the war had ended and they hadn't been in bad terms since, he had been able to save them from going to prison, after all. Well, except for Lucius, but his crimes were too horrible to just ignore, and he really deserved it after all he had done as a Death Eater. Harry, however, didn't feel much bitterness towards Draco Malfoy anymore.
"How fucking thick are you, Potter?" Malfoy snarled, making Harry frown. The old Malfoy was back in business, just like that. "I don't
It was almost midday when Harry finally got out of bed, simply because Ron didn't let him sleep anymore.
should spend more time with her. We all need a little love after all that happened."
Harry was thinking about Theodore’s words and realized that he hadn't seen Malfoy the whole day either. Okay, so he had slept until midday... but it was still weird. He wasn't worried about the Slytherin, but he was curious. He also knew how he'd find him and so he got up, going to his and Ron's bedroom, carefully closing the door behind him.
"Like… tomorrow night, maybe?" Ginny continued right against his ear. "I've waited for
"Anyone could see us, you know", Draco said against his lips as they had to stop to take a breath again. "Aren't you afraid of ending up on the front page of the Prophet anymore?"
Malfoy laughed coldly. "All the time. Last time was barely half an hour ago", he said. "Like I said, it's nothing new. Also, it's the truth. You know that." Harry could see the melancholic look in Malfoy's eyes that he was clearly trying to hide with a laugh. Harry wasn't fooled.
"No", Harry finally answered weakly. "Could you... please... wait for a while?"
First they simply tried to see which one of them mounted their broom faster. Harry won Malfoy everytime.
His eyes kept wandering again slowly, across the table to Malfoy's long, thin fingers rubbing his almost empty glass of cocoa. His gaze lifted slowly towards the Slytherin's face, past that long sleeved and quite tight black shirt that was once again perfectly highlighting that very tempting body of his... Malfoy really knew how to dess up nicely. Harry's eyes kept going, now shamelessly resting on Malfoy's chest. Merlin, the man was hot. He trembled. Once again Malfoy's outfit for the day was making him feel totally wrong kinds of things and the alcohol was definitely not helping at all... In fact it was making it
bad day and for some
Malfoy frowned at him. "Seriously?
"I came from Hagrid's and saw you here", he answered. Malfoy didn't say anything back, so Harry added: "What about you?"
Draco looked at the remote control that Harry was holding in his hand. "What's that?" he asked.
" Harry snapped back. "But like I told you, he didn't have a choice! He didn't want to hurt anyone else. He's sorry about – "
Harry, once again feeling butterflies in his stomach, slowly leaned closer and pulled the Slytherin into a kiss. He felt the other man's long fingers sink into this messy hair as their lips moved against each other’s tenderly. Harry parted his lips slightly, letting Malfoy’s tongue touch his own.
"Ha-ha", Harry answered dryly, returning to his essay again.
"Potter?" he heard Malfoy's tentative voice behind him.
"Okay...", Malfoy said with a weird look on his pale face. "That's not what I heard... Greg said that you wanted to talk with me."
"Harry, are you alright?" Ginny walked to him and asked, sounding and looking totally taken aback. She leaned over Harry and pulled him up from the floor.
"Why would I change my mind?" Harry asked in a gentle tone.
Taking a deep breath he entered the room and closed the door behind him as quietly as he could. Malfoy was in a half lying, half sitting position on his bed, glancing over his book at Harry with a questioning look on his pale face.
"What's happening?"
Slytherin class is homosexual?!"
tell them that I'm going to break up with Ginny and they took it very well. Even Ron didn't seem to mind."
Harry was confused. Was Malfoy telling him the truth or was he just ashamed of what had happened?
Harry."
"There's no use", the Slytherin said. "Your hair's always the same mess."
There was an lopsided smile on Malfoy's lips. "Yeah, normal", he said lazily. "If we forget the tiny matter that he wants to bang the hell out of me."
"Your body is amazing", the Slytherin broke the silence, muttering against Harry's abs.
be! I'm leaving Ginny and after that I'm telling everyone about you!"
the one who started it in the first place, Potter.
"I became
Ron and Hermione didn't bring it up anymore.
"Yep", Harry said blithely, grinning at the shocked look on the other man's face. "You've never cooked before?"
Damn you, Draco! You really know how to torture me, how to drive me mad!"
us?!" Ron managed to ask between all the gagging sounds.
She turned around, her long fire-red hair swaying in the air as she flounced away from him.
"I guess I should go take a quick shower first", Harry said while getting up and putting his glasses on.
Harry nodded. "I did. Mostly with Malfoy, though. Goyle left early. Believe it or not, I actually had kind of fun in the end. Malfoy even bought me a drink." After glancing at Ron and seeing the slightly peevish look on his face he quickly added: "I'd rather have been drinking with you two, of course." He remembered their conversation from yesterday's dinner and decided that maybe it would be best to fix the misunderstanding right now. "And about that thing between Malfoy and Theo-"
"Where
"God, you're so gorgeous", Harry said and after that Draco heard him muttering out a cleaning spell. Draco could feel a weird tingling feeling inside him and the next thing he knew, Harry's hands had already spread him open and he was being entered by Harry's tongue.
The Slytherin kept preparing and teasing Harry for minutes before his fingers were finally replaced by something a lot bigger.
"I screwed up, okay", Harry sighed in an appeasing tone. "I'm sorry, Ginny."
Harry was holding his breath, standing still. Theodore had looked so angry. What was going on? What had happened? And where the hell was Malfoy?! He'd have to check from the map… Once again he was about to enter their own bedroom when he heard the portrait door open and close again.
"I regretted it
Malfoy didn't look at him anymore. He was suddenly getting up, avoiding any chance for eye contact. "Theo's right. I need sleep", he said.
he finally managed to ask, totally confused by now. "Your last...?"
"Well done, Potter", Theodore said with a sneer, and clapped his hands together. "You
"You didn't?" Harry repeated, looking unsure. "You're not just afraid to tell the truth? Because if you did, I promise I won't get mad... Okay, who am I kidding... I will surely get mad, but I can't blame you alone for it, it's my fault too for treating you like shit, and I'm sure we can work this out if -"
Harry was unsure of what to say. He had already decided to go to Grimmauld Place but seeing the look on Malfoy's face... Damn it...
"Draco, you don't have to say anything more if you don't want to", Harry said, moving his hand to caress the Slytherin's hair gently.
"Huh?" Harry startled and quickly turned his gaze on his two friends. Ron and Hermione were both staring at him. ”Sorry, what?!”
, Harry!" he snapped, now storming up the stairs and starting to head towards their bedroom by foot instead of apparating this time.
Harry finally turned his attention to the last, small present he still hadn't opened yet. He took it, turning it around in his hands. There was no card in it so he didn't know who it was from.
Malfoy must have seen Harry's confusion because, seeking a sorry smile, he soon added: "I was just coming from the shower when I saw her rushing out of your room, crying."
"Hey! Wait a minute! Where do you think you're going?!" Ron snarled. "I'm not done talking yet!"
We promise we won't tell anyone."
Harry shrugged. "Do we have any plans for Saturday?" He turned to look at his friends questioningly. Ron was petting Hermione's hair and shook his head. "I guess I don't have any", Harry said to Ginny.
way. No, he had always liked girls, dated girls and still… he had fallen for a guy. A guy who had made his life a living hell for years… When had this happened?
I forgave you long ago already. You don't owe me anything."
"They're saying that... you've been
"Night", he told Ron and closed his eyes, thinking about Ginny. He had been very busy with homework today and Ginny had been busy with quidditch (she was the new quidditch captain), so they hadn't had any extra time to spend together. Saturday was approaching though, so it didn't matter. They would make up for it then.
Harry did as he was told, undressing both of Malfoy's pants as fast as he could with his trembling hands. He was desperate to finally see and especially feel all of Malfoy. It was the Slytherin's turn to moan as Harry freed and immediately grabbed his hard member as well, eagerly starting to move his fingers on it. Harry loved the feeling of it in his hand. Malfoy's cock was bigger than in his dreams, nearly as big as his.
Both Harry and Draco were now crying silently and they were not the only ones. All over the hall, mostly women but some men as well, were wiping their eyes.
"So you think I should give him a chance?" Malfoy asked after a short, awkward silence between them. He sounded tense.
But, as said, getting closer to Malfoy had its downsides too. Day by day, the more Harry got to know Malfoy better and the more he and Malfoy were spending time together, his mind became even messier.
though everyone certainly seems to think so!"
"What about everyone at school?" Draco still pointed out. "First of all, your friends. They won't be happy about this."
Harry froze. He was staring back at Draco, clearly shocked by his words.
Harry soon flew down, landing softly on the soft grass and jumped off his broom, panting. Malfoy followed him soon after, squeezing the Snitch in his hand and swaying it at him in the air, wearing a wide grin on his face.
He saw Draco's eyes widening of surprise before their lips smashed together again.
Harry kept staring at the abstract painting on the wall with beautiful, calming dark green shades, lost deep in his thoughts. Just like he had thought, last night had really meant nothing to Malfoy, so it was pointless to tell how he really felt towards the other man. He would have to continue like nothing had ever happened between them, pretend that it had meant nothing to him either... He would carry on his relationship with Ginny and try to forget about last night, though it had been the best thing that had ever happened to him. He would have to do it, be with Ginny and have the kind of life that everyone expected of him to have: getting married and having a family with her.
Harry was still stroking the Slytherin's hair. "I don't think he necessarily meant any of those things. He was just jealous of you. He cares about you and just wanted to hurt you because you don't feel the same way."
"Ginny won't be pleased to hear about your company", Ron said.
Few minutes later, he and Draco walked down the hall straight to the dance area to have their dance before the congrats and dinner.
He found that he didn't even like the adept, familiar way that Ginny kissed him with her thin lips anymore. No, he missed Malfoy's full lips, the taste of his mouth and his clearly inexperienced, frantic way of kissing Harry... He missed the way that Malfoy had bitten at his lip and looked at him deep in the eyes at the same time. Merlin, he could imagine spending hours and hours just kissing the Slytherin and he wanted to be the one to teach him to kiss better.
"I am NOT hiding from him", Malfoy said icily, but Harry didn't give up.
"He clearly cares about you, Malfoy", Harry pointed out.
He raised his gaze for a while, meeting Draco's beautiful stormy grey eyes that were full of emotion.
Draco didn't have to be told twice. He rolled onto his back, spreading his legs, ready for Harry. Harry always preferred positions where they were facing each other because he wanted to look into Draco's eyes while being inside him.
It didn't take long until they both were already naked except their still remaining underpants. Harry was moving his lips everywhere on Draco's beautiful upper body, loving the view and scent. He was sucking and biting on the Slytherin's neck, this time without a doubt leaving marks on it. He was licking and sucking Draco's nipples and kissing Draco's chest, moving his lips and tongue along the scars. The Slytherin was gasping and moaning under him all the time, his body trembling with want.
"What did you say? Theodore's-"
"I guess we are", Malfoy answered.
Hearing a feminine voice under him made Harry finally open his eyes. He found himself staring into his girlfriend's brown, glimmering eyes and his face fell.
to be, this was what he had waited for all his life. Malfoy's lips were so soft, so smooth, so perfect against Harry's own and he never wanted to let the man go. These lips were meant for him only, him and no one else.
Malfoy bowed his head down again. "I could have said no", he said, voice weak all of a sudden.
He kept twisting and turning his fingers inside for a good while, listening to the other man’s whining, and finally moved his other hand to his cock, lubricating it at the same time with the rest of the lube that was still left in his hand.
Everytime the portrait door turned around his eyes fixed on it, but he was always let down, time after time. He saw Pansy and Blaise, he saw Seamus and Dean, he saw Goyle… but no Malfoy and Theodore.
Harry was staring at the ceiling again. Hermione had of course been just teasing them, but he couldn't get her words out of his head. Or Ron's, for that matter.
Malfoy let his wardrobe land against the wall next to the door, turning around smoothly, wawing at his wand again. Harry admired his flexible movements. Goyle was already sending more furnishings towards them.
What the hell was he still doing here in his bed? He needed to go see Malfoy, he needed to see him right now. Harry got up slowly, his head feeling all fuzzy because of his drunken state. Ron let out a very loud snort in his sleep, making Harry finally jump up completely. Trying his best to keep his balance he slowly,
After they finished eating, Draco went to his own room (Harry had given him one of the biggest rooms that had used to be Regulus' when he himself intended to sleep in Sirius' room on the same floor) and Harry went to the living room in order to watch some television. The wizards didn't usually watch television but Harry was not an ordinary one. Having spent his early life with the Dursleys he had always wished to be able to have his own TV - Dudley had had three televisions at best and Harry none, so now when he was finally living on his own, he had wanted to get one for himself.
‘Just after six,’ Longbottom replied.
Harry squatted down and said, ‘Hello,’ with a lazy grin.
‘And Malfoy gets to sit his exams too,’ Ron raised his eyebrows at this.
‘If you were anyone else,’ she’d told him and she was just as quiet then, words serious, gaze searching his for signs that he understood exactly what she was trying to tell him, ‘I would be threatening you and telling you exactly what would happen if you hurt him.’
All three nodded, faces grim.
His attempt at some form of diplomacy drew a snort of derision from Hermione. ‘Yes, Ron, they’re called boobs.’
‘It looks that way.’
It took a moment for the words to register. “Daddy” and “Papa”. Hermione had never been slow but now she was starting to feel like she’d fallen into some sort of alternate universe because Draco Malfoy was…gay? Pureblood Draco Malfoy was
‘Want to try it anyway?’
But he was still Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater, the bigoted bully of a boy who had wielded his arrogance and his wealth and his status as a sharp blade and though he could try and try (and try and try) there was never any making up for the things he had done.
He didn’t know how to do any of that, wasn’t sure even the power he wielded as the Chosen One could attempt such a thing, but there was one thing he could do. Or rather there was one thing he could refuse to do.
Hermione and the Weasel were all that had tied Harry to life in some of his darkest moments, they were what kept him grounded and sane (mostly) and gave him a reason to do the things he did.
He was in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom and it was sixth year. He’d been following Malfoy all year and now he knew it was the moment, this was the one chance he would have to confront him and find out once and for all what he was up to. It was finally his chance to prove to everyone that he wasn’t just obsessing over nothing, that Malfoy really was up to something.
‘Harry,’ he said sharply when he was close enough to be heard.
Harry didn’t understand that at all. ‘Of course, she misses him, she loves him. But why does that mean she has to feel guilty for talking to him and avoid both of us? I told her to talk to him – that I didn’t want to come between them!’
About the only thing he could remember clearly from that evening was Narcissa softly saying, ‘Albus Dumbledore did not do right by my son or you, Mister Potter.’
Hermione passed over the magazine. ‘
He and Harry stepped over the rope but didn’t go much further than that. ‘How do you want to do this?’ Draco asked.
‘Right.’ Harry frowned. ‘Why’d she send them to you?’
Draco hummed. ‘I am,’ he agreed.
‘Blood magic has consequences,’ Granger insisted. ‘It’s terribly dark magic.’
When he’d finally realised the truth, he’d been so desperate to keep Harry from finding out, so desperate not to ruin the friendship that had grown between them because he so desperately needed it, that he’d completely missed the signs that Harry was falling for him too.
‘But I,’ she looked at him after patiently waiting for Harry to explain and promptly corrected herself, ‘
Given that he could no longer feel the toes on his right foot – would that nerve damage ever heal? – he would have to take her word for it.
‘Bloody fucking hell,’ Harry croaked, rolling onto his side and wheezing as he tried to get his breathing back under control. The pain in his chest wasn’t the worst he’d ever experienced but fuck if it wasn’t a close second.
‘I think it is mostly about me.’ Draco truly hadn’t taken Weasley to be homophobic either. He still wasn’t inclined to believe someone that Harry and Hermione could love (someone raised by Molly and Arthur Weasley) could be so bigoted. And that was coming from someone who didn’t like Weasley and hadn’t had any real respect for him, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that Weasley was choosing his words intentionally to hurt Harry the only way he could. Although, somehow, Draco thought that made it worse.
‘Astara, there’s somebody I’d like you to meet,’ Malfoy said. He was looking at Hermione as he spoke with a strange look on his face she didn’t know how to read. ‘Astara, this is Hermione Granger, Granger, my daughter, Astara.’
But only a small part. The bigger part of him had been watching the two of them pine for years and thought they’d probably be good together if Ron stopped being an arse about it and Hermione stopped letting him get away with so much. He’d had to put up with a lot from them over the years and he was ready to admit that Hermione, having known Ron’s emotional range, probably could have saved them all some trouble by just laying it all out for Ron in simple words. Of course, he didn’t blame her for not wanting to. He just wished it could have been so simple instead of her waiting patiently for him to mature enough to meet her needs.
He’d been quite taken aback by her frankness, but she hadn’t said it to be mean or to gain his sympathy, she’d only said it to assure him that she saw exactly how strong his relationship with Harry had come to be. It had been this more than anything that allowed Draco to admit he and Ginny were genuinely friends and not simply faking it for Harry.
Harry still had nightmares, he’d had a few panic attacks, but what it boiled down to was that Harry had been on the right side, he’d fought as hard as he could. He’d lost people but slowly and surely, he was coming to understand that those he’d lost in that final battle had known the risks, they’d known what they were fighting for and they’d made that choice. His mind healer had spent weeks helping him understand that he couldn’t take that choice away from them, all he could do was remember them and live the life they would have wanted for him, the life they had fought for.
‘It won’t be easy locating the witch or wizard responsible,’ Hermione pointed out, needlessly.
Mendenhall was dressed in his usual tired looking auror robes, but Winthrop seemed to be making an effort to make hers more functional. She had a strange mix of muggle fashions on beneath the open scarlet robe – somehow, he thought Harry had a hand in that.
He supposed that meant the world was better off without the man he was. He didn’t know anything about the man he’d become, living as a muggle without his memories. The Ministry kept tabs on him, Draco knew that much, he didn’t want to know more than that. Goyle wasn’t his problem anymore. He never should have been.
He took Draco’s arm and held it up before them, tracing rough fingers over the black ink of the Dark Mark. It wasn’t moving anymore, the snake resting still once again. Just the fact Harry could so easily trace his fingers over the snake and skull, that he looked at the Mark and didn’t feel disgust or anger, set warmth blooming in Draco’s chest.
"No", Harry said, shaking his head and looking deep into his husbands eyes. "Not terrible at all."
"Yeah", Malfoy said, now staring towards the lake. "I come here often. Whenever I need to... you know."
Harry was staring at his girlfriend sitting on top of him, trying as hard as he could to get more excited about it. There was nothing wrong with Ginny. She was very beautiful and sexy with her red hair, oval shaped face, curved lashes, lots of cute freckles on her cheeks and nose and, of course, perky breasts. She was a real eye candy for any straight man, but for some reason Harry couldn't get to the mood
"I don't… know", he found himself answering after pondering it for a while. He really had no clue.
"First of all, you got it all wrong when we were in the train", he said. "Of course you could have come sit with us. I just thought that you’d want to go see your friends since we had been alone for two weeks without seeing anyone else."
"Like hell I'm gonna wait!" he groaned, letting go of Malfoy's cock. He was feeling very frustrated right now. He wanted the man so damn much and Malfoy was just going to keep him waiting?! "I want you tonight. I'm going to fuck you right now." He moved his hands to Malfoy's buttocks again, groping them ravenously.
Harry turned to look at his friends again. "Please don't tell her", he said instantly. "I don't want her to get any more pissed at me, so...
"We could have joined you", Ron said. "If you had informed us about your plans, that is."
wait."
at the same time.
up. First of all, his relationship with Ginny. Ginny had no idea what a distorted man she actually had as her boyfriend. Ginny hated Malfoy's guts and now Harry had ended up in bed with the same guy she so much despised. She would never forgive him if she found out what had happened last night. Moreover, how would Harry be able to forgive himself either? How was he supposed to look at his girlfriend in the eyes and pretend that everything was just fine when he had actually ruined everything for good?
What did I tell you?! You shouldn't make such conclusions when you know nothing about it."
After they had eaten he decided to go visit the graveyard where his parents were buried. After all, it was the evening before Christmas.
"Yes." Malfoy's grey eyes glittered as they turned to leave, side by side. Harry had a feeling that this Christmas was going to be a good one after all. He had no doubt about it anymore.
"Are you serious?!" Harry snapped at him, glaring at his outfit from head to toes at the same time. "You just decided to go clubbing,
Harry stared at Malfoy for a while, confused. Then he started to laugh. He just couldn't help it, this was too absurd.
you went after leaving the club! Or else..." Harry's lips were trembling and Draco could feel his hands shaking against his shoulders as he was gripping him almost violently.
Hermione and Harry were both shaking their heads, laughing. Harry was glad that things had gone this easy with Ron and Hermione. However, he was pretty sure that it wouldn't be this easy when it came to making up with Ginny. He’d realized that they had originally planned to spend part of the Friday evening together, and Harry had just stood her up without a word or a glance.
When he was stroking his girlfriend's fire-red hair, he suddenly realized how thick and coarse it felt against his fingers. It was nothing close to Malfoy's silky and so light platinum hair – that also smelled so good.
Harry didn't answer. He was staring at the lake again, hands deep inside his coat pockets.
has a good reason to be angry", Ron commented.
They came against each other almost at the same time, both crying of pleasure, cum mixing in between Malfoy's tight grip and their bellies. The Slytherin's now powerless body landed heavily on top of Harry's, his face buried against Harry's neck. They were just lying there for a while, bodies glimmering with sweat, before finally Malfoy rolled next to him.
"Really, another drink again?" Hermione asked with a sigh, shaking her head.
There was a short silence between them.
Malfoy's last sentence left Harry feeling very uneasy. The way in which Malfoy had said it was bothering him. So Theodore very much wanted to have sex with Malfoy... but had Malfoy
Malfoy nodded, avoiding eye contact. Harry quickly passed the Slytherin, entering his and Ron's room, leaving the door open.
if we are meant to be together, after all..." Having finished her sentence she opened the door and left, now crying openly.
"Oh, really?" Draco asked, moving his own hands to Harry's hips. "And what could that possibly be?"
He already saw the Slytherin standing at the appointed place, back towards him. He wanted to give the man something, but... what was he supposed to give to the man that he had fallen for? Harry sighed in frustration.
", Harry ended the sentence. He couldn't look at Malfoy in the eyes anymore. Right now he just wished to be able to disappear from the earth. Why the heck was he making a laughing stock of himself like this, in front of Malfoy, the man who had always very much enjoyed using any of his weaknesses against him?
Harry was looking at the Slytherin, truly astounded. "Third grade? You're
Draco shook his head and Harry sighed.
obsessed with Malfoy!" Harry finally hissed.
"I can't tell you", Harry said without delay. Seeing Ron frowning at him, he added: "It's private."
"Ginny wasn't pleased?" she asked carefully.
That was what finally caught Malfoy's full attention. The Slytherin's head turned towards him instantly.
It's all they've been talking about", Ron said quickly. "But what really matters is is it true?!"
"You didn't
"…calming view", Harry managed to finish his sentence. He was feeling very confused at the moment. The way Malfoy had been looking at him, almost like... But it
Harry startled. "What?"
have. Apart from the 6th year when you cheated."
"I understand", Narcissa said softly. "Your father can be, um... very merciless and... even scary. However, I'm going to go see him as soon as I get out. So if you'd like, I can take care of it for you."
Harry gulped, not knowing what he should say. "Umm... I thought she wanted us to have a break", he said. "That's why I haven't... you know."
are sure about it?" he asked.
Harry raised his eyebrow. "I don't know what the heck you're talking about", he said.
Malfoy closed his book. "About what?" he asked.
Ginny finally met his gaze. "It's alright", she said with trembling lips. "I forgive you. I... wish you a long and happy marriage."
"Hey! What do you think you are doing?!" he heard a very familiar voice inquiring loudly from one the couches.
Harry didn't know how to answer. There were too many things running on his mind right now. He was speechless.
Then came the day that changed everything for good.
Harry was rubbing at his watery eyes. What if someone found out about what had happened? He didn't even want to think about all the consequences. He would lose his girlfriend, his friends, his reputation... He could already imagine all the possible headlines in the Daily Prophet.
Malfoy, looking almost as shocked as Harry, quickly wrenched himself from Harry's grip, turning his back on him. With shaking hands he pulled his pyjama shirt on, starting to button it up.
That made Harry frown. She really knew how to ruin a moment. "Okay, I think you should go now. It's getting late", he said curtly. "Don't get caught."
Harry gave another sigh and shook his head as well. "No, Malfoy. No benefits, just a normal friendship. We already talked about this yesterday... I have a girlfriend."
"After she finally stops waiting for you to go back to her", Ron added.
Finally, after a minute or so, Ron straightened himself and turned around, heading back towards their table. Harry could see the two Slytherins immediately turning to look at him and Hermione, and he instinctively lowered his gaze back to his plate.
"This is so fucking crazy", Harry said again after they’d finally gotten enough of kissing, rubbing his eyes with his hand. "This is pure madness."
Malfoy was sitting in front of the window and Theodore was sitting on the other side of the table. They were finishing their essays. Together.
Harry just stood still for a while before following the other man. When he arrived to the corridor, he already heard Malfoy and Theodore's door closing.
That was when he remembered what Ron had told him earlier that day. Malfoy already
"Well, it would be pretty weird to still call him by his last name when we've spent the whole two weeks at my place together, you know", he said negligently.
"Listen, Ginny", he started again. He was still trying his best to keep his voice calm, only it was starting to get really difficult now. "He is not like he used to be. He's changed. You think you know him but you really know nothing about him."
"Yeah... I guess I'll never get over it", Harry lied, taking a bite of his toast.
Harry also remembered the feeling he had felt when he'd thought that Malfoy was sleeping with Theodore. Ron's words had caused him a total loss of appetite that time, he had wanted to vomit, he had felt like he was being strangled… He had been hurt, he had been jealous, but he had not been ready to admit it to himself that day.
Malfoy grinned, slightly opening his eyes. "Gotten any better at it?" he asked teasingly.
"Let's pretend I never opened that one, okay?" Harry said, seeking for a smile. He hated seeing Draco sad.
Theodore was eyeing Harry closely for a while, a pungent look in his dark eyes, trying to decide if he could trust him or not.
Was that how it was? Had Harry already gotten tired of him and got a crush on someone at work? Or was Harry already in love with someone else, having sex with someone better than him after work? Was that the reason for his stretching work days, for his tiredness...? Was that the reason why he always went straight to shower after work, to wash away the smell of another man... or perhaps a woman?
"That's none of your business", Malfoy snapped right away.
"I don't know. I guess I just like to cook the muggle way", Harry had answered with a shrug. "It's nice."
"Oh my", the other man said in a teasing tone, a lustful glint in his eyes. "All wet already? You've seriously missed this."
do the same to you. He will keep searching for better. It's inescapable."
His thoughts always returned to Malfoy, to his gorgeously styled blond hair, the beautiful scent of his cologne and especially that sexy looking outfit on his lithe body. Just thinking about it gave him shivers. Oh Merlin, how much he wished to be the one spending the night with Malfoy. He wanted to hang out with him at the pub, get completely wasted together, snog that gorgeous man in the cold night and finally, at the end of the night, shag the hell out of him just like he had done in his dream… but no. Malfoy was with Theodore tonight, the man who had flashed Harry that obnoxius smile, sending a clear message to him: You've lost the game.
"Oh, right! I forgot! He's only a poor, misunderstood boy", Ginny mocked.
him to care about me! I want him to move on! It's… not good for him…"
"The door is already locked. Calm the
"I do", he said right away.
Harry grinned. "Well, at least there's an upside in that... I don't probably need to worry that you'd try to steal her from me."
Malfoy's smile had faded away and he was now watching them, completely expressionless.
"Draco! Tell us what the hell is going on?!" Theo insisted immediately, sounding terribly worried.
"You lied to me, Draco", Harry said after the kiss, running his hand through the other man's hair again. "You said you weren't gay..."
"Malfoy!" he called out when he was about 20 meters away. He saw the other man startle and then glance towards him. Without saying a word to Harry, the man quickly turned back towards the lake, turning his back on him.
He didn't need to clarify it any more. Draco let out a sigh, breaking the eye contact.
Harry took another step closer to him. "It was", he said. "But not anymore. Things have changed since then. It's not what I want to do anymore. There are much more important things in my life now."
Draco raised his gaze and turned to look at him.
There was a short silence.
Harry tried to find the right words to use but he soon came to a conclusion that however he would put it, it wouldn't make Ginny take it any better. It was pointless to try and stall.
"I'm sorry, but it really does sound like you've been fooled by him for a long time", Theo sighed, his hand on Draco's shoulder.
Ron grimaced. "Yeah, I think I heard you groaning in your sleep", he said. "Was it about the war again?"
"I guess part of that is true", Harry said, crouching down to the ground to light up a candle with his wand.
After his sentence the Slytherin quickly stood up again, heading to order another drink for himself, leaving Harry completely speechless. He couldn't believe what he had just heard. Was this some kind of a sick joke played on him or was Malfoy actually being serious? He had no idea… Today had already been so weird, so confusing, that Harry's brain wasn't even able to work any more.
Harry glanced at her hand and instantly felt butterflies in his stomach. Ginny grabbed his face and kissed him again, this time more eagerly. Harry kissed back with enthusiasm, Ginny was a really good kisser, after all.
Ginny wanted to snuggle with him on the couch and all Harry could think about was who he had been snuggling with last night and how different everything had felt then. Ginny's girly, hourglass shaped body and her breasts pressed against his own body didn't feel right anymore. Instead he rather preferred the feeling of Malfoy's masculine but skinny body with no breasts, all sharp angles and lean muscles, pressed against him.
At breakfast Harry saw Malfoy and Goyle sitting next to each other, having a long conversation, and in the following Potion's class with the Slytherins he saw that Malfoy was constantly glancing towards his direction. Harry concentrated on his cauldron, pretending not to notice the other man at all.
Harry pushed Malfoy's hand roughly away from him, quickly jumping out of the bed.
Harry was just staring at the other man for a short while until he smashed his mouth against the Slytherin's again and rolled on top of him, kissing him roughly. Was he dreaming again? Malfoy had touched his scar and told him he wanted him... Why the hell did Draco Malfoy want him, Harry Potter, in his bed, of all people? It didn't make any sense to him at the moment – but it didn't matter. Merlin, hearing stuff like that felt so good, so arousing.
