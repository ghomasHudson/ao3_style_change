“Listen”
He pulled away and rubbed his nose to his, “Color, baby?”
“Re” he called, gulping when Remus’ eyes softened and offered a hand.
“I do not permit anyone going inside my bedroom so under any circumstance, don’t. Your bedroom will just be beside mine and if you have anything to say, knock and wait”
“Make me jealous? Pretend I wasn’t there to listen how you giggle like a fucking school girl?”
Draco sighed before fixing himself. He trusts Fred and George they could handle this. Whenever they come back, those twins took it in their duty to work hence their phrasing their ‘part-time job’.
Merlin.
“I’m sorry” he apologized sincerely, “I’m sorry for leaving you like that and not appearing for three days”
“I do not want to pry but don’t you have any decent clothes?”
And as those lips that were formerly wrapped around a cigarette kissing the corner of his lips to nipping at his chin to his jawline, mouth finding their way to his ears and tug on his earlobes gently, “Is this what you want?”
Dracy pouted, “I want to” she whispered, “Please, Harry?” she begged because she knows how her words of plea have such an effect on him.
Harry took hold of his wrist and put it on his shirt for Draco to grip on as they walked inside. Immediately hearing the noises, smelling the smoke and alcohol and the chaos that is the dance floor.
Harry sighed and even though he knew this was going to happen, he began to stare at the moving picture of him and Draco talking to one another.
It was Harry’s turn roll his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest. If you ask Draco, of course he did not look. Those muscles are fake. Definitely fake.
It did not help that the woman tonight is as gorgeous as a myth could tell. She was extremely exquisite in her silk gown, the slit up to her thighs which gave him generous amount to gawk at. She was simply
“Luna!” he exclaimed, “How are you?”
He pulled his fingers out and deftly unbuttoned and unzipped his jeans and when Draco looked down, he was right, Harry have gone commando. If he was still as confident as probably centuries ago, he would’ve smirk at him but he was just so desperate to be filled to the brim, to be fucked in a way they haven’t before.
He gulped.
He pouted when it didn’t hit any, “You can do it, Harry! Who knows you might hit a rare tour to visit a Dragon’s den or a wizard safari”
He encircled his legs tightly on him as Harry walked over to the bed and sat down. Draco smiled as Harry’s serious eyes turned gentler, his lips puckering, “You’ll hate when I have white hairs?”
She was slowly taking a walk while keeping her eyes on him. The glint in her eyes held the expectations of awaiting victory and he gave her this moment to think she will.
Harry caught her lips for one more kiss, his teeth pulling at her bottom lip to play with it as he began to chase his own orgasm. The sweet scent of hers causing him to want to pull out and slid down until his head is leveled at her pussy with her cum dripping out of her. And tongue fucked her for another mind blowing orgasm.
She washed the puke away before she walked back to her bedroom and took a nice shower. The water cascading over her body relieved her headache a bit. When she was done, she slipped into a simple shirt and went to the kitchen to find something tolerable to eat.

“I’m sorry, baby. I have to go to the Ministry today. Ron’s been bugging me” he answered.
“Yes, yes. I got the star of the night for tonight’s auction,” he grunted, “Money down, Mr. Poh. You’ll get the invitation after it”
His parents have been so happy for him and so accepting he cannot believe it. When he got those words out, he started to show the public who he is. He began in Hogwarts where students ridiculed him for being such a freak but it didn’t matter what he has gone through because one day, his whole life shifted.
When he was sure he is satisfied of how gorgeous he looks, he went back down to see Harry settled on the couch in the living room, several stacks of folders laid on the table infront of him. His Auror robes open and he was playing with his wand with his fingers. He looks so hot. So hot and it's making Draco's body feel hotter.
"Alright, alright. Just be sure to appear on his party. I think that's a good chance to play some dare games and have you dancing wantonly in someone's lap" Pansy grinned devilishly.
Harry watched his expression freely. Something that was kept a secret, something that was kept inside the bedroom, restricting him many ways to fully love his little boy.
“This is your little beanie right here” Andy pointed at a small. . . looks really like a beanie. Barely noticeable as the image in front of them really wasn’t shown in a high definition picture.
“Harry, harry, fuck, harder” he demanded still pulling on the dog tags.
As their teams packed to get back to the Ministry for debriefing, they remained in the place. Tangled in each other’s arms as Harry ripped his clothes away. Lips nipping at the column of his throat, hands groping his ass, kneading the soft flesh in his rough palms.
“I-i. . . I’m sorry” his voice broke, “I don’t have any excuses”
Dracy woke up from her nap to see a snack on the bedside table and a note that said Harry will be back early in the evening and she needs to get ready, dress up and little smiley drawing. She smiled at the cuteness of the note.
“Boss!” Fred gave a playful salute, “Lover boy’s been brooding” George added.
Something akin to self-hatred and guilt.
Draco cannot quite focus with the task at hand. He was busy feeling the warmth that’s emanating from his hand, the way his fingers seem to fit just right. And was wondering if he’s having some hallucinations and his mind is toying with him.
Lily sighed, “It’s called science”
She simply nodded.
“Luna” he smiled at her who easily smiled back and pointed at Draco.
Harry conquered her world and it’s her time to conquer his.
P.P.S. I don't have a beta so I sincerely apologize for any errors and mistakes that may have been able to escape from my eyes ♡
He took a step closer then another then another until the man raised a hand and signaled him to stop. He did instantly. But he wanted to step back when that feeling came back, stronger and pulsing like blood rushing through his veins.
“You asked me to come up here to
Holding Harry within a tender and protective embrace, Draco rocked them. Not sufficiently to shift the chair, but moving their torsos together in a gentle sway, back and forth, a motion which also created small changes in the positions of their hips and groins, and repeatedly slid the length of Harry’s cock against Draco’s.
a bottom.”
Crafty bugger. Harry involuntarily huffed out a tiny laugh. Only Draco could turn dominance and submission into an impromptu therapy session. And valuable though that lesson possibly was, Harry hoped it wasn’t all he was getting today.
Harry considered his own abilities to be severely overrated. “And what do I do? Wave my hand or squint myopically until I see something weirdly magical or sort of relevant and then guess what I think it is. Oh, yes… that takes great skill.”
so? What happened? Was it because I moved too high just then?”
that? I don’t, I… oh.”
Draco tried to steel himself for taking a small step towards making a huge decision. But there wasn’t really a decision to be made at all.
“Because it’s
“This is nice,” he commented, examining the carved wooden surface of the handsome bureau as he ignored Lucius’ barrage of colourful insults and the echoing knocks as Lucius attempted to use the cane to batter his way out of the frame. Harry was no expert, but the bureau might be mahogany.
“Good. Every wandmaker should feel connected to their work. This is… new though. And pretty,” she added. “My wands never do such a lovely thing.”
he would do that.
“I don’t understand you, Malfoy. I tried for ages to… and you weren’t interested. Then some weird thing happened, and now you keep pestering me.”
knew who I was. He looked so
, and I’m sure he knows that.”
“Then we won’t have
But Malfoy clearly had other plans.
If Malfoy swallowed Harry’s cock right now, then he could have anything he wanted. But to be honest, Harry would give him that anyway.
Draco angled his head to the side, as if he was examining something intriguing. “It’ll be with you, right?”
“I don’t. It’s a bit of a mood killer. Not that the mood hasn’t be decimated already. In fact, I think we’re doing entirely too much talking. And you’re not too skilled in deflection.” Draco reminded himself that criticism wasn’t likely to lead to a sexual encounter. “The important topic at the moment is why you left me on the bed by myself.”
that type of internal vision. It’d felt so real. And the mocking laugh as Harry’s hips had unwillingly continued to thrust into Michael’s body had been utterly convincing.
A cough sounded in Harry’s ear. Harry was about to turn when he caught the reflection of the man standing directly behind him.
“Sssh,” whispered Draco. “Stay still and I’ll explain the rules.”
Ever vigilant, Malfoy must’ve noticed the indecision.
Harry exhaled slowly and looked back to Draco, feeling oddly accomplished but still uncertain. He’d refused something which had been requested of him by someone he cared about, and they hadn’t pushed or insisted. George hadn’t even sounded
The current delay was torturous enough.
Yes, Harry was
Watching Harry with wary eyes, Ron spoke again. “And I’ve been wanting to ask you something. It’s… important. About the Head of MLE position. We think it’s going not too badly, but the other applicants might be more… favoured than Michael.”
“I’ve been…
Thrown out on impulse, Harry immediately regretted his reply. He needed to learn to think before he opened his mouth.
When Draco lay on his back beside him and opened his legs in invitation, Harry forced himself to remember that he wasn’t alone in this. Draco shifted his spine, getting comfortable, so Harry sat up and relocated himself to kneel between Draco’s open legs, feeling awkward about the reversal of roles.
But even as he basked in the thrill of submission, Harry started to feel a strange urge… that
it. All of it.
“Harry… why are you in Malfoy’s bed?”
“Breathe.” Harry hadn’t realised that he’d stopped until he gasped in air. “Well done,” Malfoy praised as Harry controlled his breathing. In, out, in, out, as Draco visually examined him, clearly assessing the situation. “I take care of what’s important to me.” Malfoy assured in a low, rumbling voice, but his gaze was questioning.
Draco’s fingers curled around and between Harry’s.
how, Harry managed to keep his smile in place. It helped to think of what he was about to do.
“Degradation?” The casualness with which Malfoy threw out the word caused Harry to inhale a gasp. His cock needed out.
Dubious, Harry frowned in suspicion.
Harry supposed he shouldn’t be surprised that a portrait of Lucius was in the Manor. Or that it was apprised of current events. Portraits had their own communication network to pass on news, he was aware of that, but Harry wondered how
Draco noted with interest that Potter had not yet exerted any effort to relocate from his current position.
“Perhaps a cleaning charm first,” Malfoy suggested. “For both of us,” he added, examining the mess on his shirt.
“You’ll do your pathetic best, I’m sure,” said Draco as he pushed himself off the doorframe.
to irreparably rip that dream away from him. It was more vindictive than Harry usually liked to be, but he was willing to make an exception. If Michael was so
Accurate description though that was, Amblehurst had also made plenty of accurate statements today.
, Malfoy.”
“Uhuh,” mumbled Harry.
disappointed if you disobey me.”
Michael looked like he was battling to find the right response. Draco looked like he was battling not to stomp Michael’s face into the ground.
“That was quite the nudge.”
Harry inwardly berated himself. He should’ve kept his mouth shut. Maybe then he’d be happily impaled at this point, rather than frustrated and abandoned. Speaking or moving without permission would only worsen his situation, so he stayed mute where he was, letting the coffee table take the weight of his upper body and ensuring that his hands were still firmly clasped together. He rested his cheek against the wood, concentrating on easing his panting and not rutting his cock against the underside of the table, all the while aware that Malfoy’s seated position would be providing him with a direct view up Harry's arse.
A soft rustle of sheets emanated from the bed as Draco stretched, roused, and yawned. And now he’d woken up Draco again. He watched in dismay as Draco sat up and swung his legs over the side of the mattress, but Draco didn’t stand.
with each of Malfoy’s thrusts, the fist tightened even more in Harry’s hair, his neck and shoulders ached from their pulled-back position, his legs trembled from maintaining their spread stance, and his cock
That suggestion was probably as helpful as Harry’s glaring had been.
“So, shall we be relating this tale of non-rug humping to Ron tomorrow?” Harry asked, both to reinforce that sex was not about to commence and attempt to encourage the return of Draco’s laughter.
“I know,” Harry replied.
“It seems that it’s
had contained him. So, why couldn’t Harry
Malfoy was watching the liquid wobble precariously as Harry moved.
Potter paled. Payback was a bitch.
Harry chuckled faintly as he straightened his back and raised his head to look at Draco.
“Do you want to feel me shove my cock down your throat, forcing you to
“Indeed. I imagine they’d be very interested if they received written proof. Probably wouldn’t even care where it came from.” Harry decided not to ask about the source of Draco’s information. There were probably some things he was better not knowing. “In fact, they probably wouldn’t even
It was an exhausted effort, but Harry felt a hint of a smile reluctantly bloom on his face.
Suddenly, Harry didn’t feel inclined towards post-sex snuggling either. And yes, he did want to be sitting up for this. Extracting his legs from Draco’s, Harry pushed himself upwards and over to a seated position with a grimace.
The time that Harry had initially saved by kicking his pile of clothes untidily onto the floor had already been repaid many times over. He fought to resist the urge to roll his eyes since his last display of that expression was what had prompted the lecture. If Harry did it again, he’d probably be left here unshagged all night.
it. That was so
And Draco knew it. “You’ll need to try harder than that, Potter.”
“That’s because it’s Malfoy family magic of an extremely questionable moral nature. Which you
personal and private. Only for us.”
that,” Malfoy sneered, even as he ruined that assertion with a gentle kiss to Harry’s jaw.
. But even as his mind supplied that assertion, he understood that most people don’t feel the need to do
Cringing, Harry shook his head in bemusement. They’d only had Jemima in the house for a few hours, and all she’d witnessed was sex. They may have been providing a terrible influence. He wondered how observant or intelligent Puffs actually were. He supposed he’d find out.
“No, it wouldn’t,” Harry answered quickly. Too quickly maybe, judging by the suspicious narrowing of Draco’s eyes again. Everyone was far too bloody observant today. Harry tried to move them away from the topic. “But it’s not important. None of my business anymore who the Ministry hires. We’ve got better things to think about. Loads still to sort through in here.”
A whiff of smoke hit Harry’s nostrils, signalling that something within the office had indeed started to smoulder. Harry concentrated; like a radar, his magic rapidly found the source in a corner behind him and without turning his head, he pushed his power outwards to smother the danger.
. He panted into the sheet, loud and open-mouthed. Draco hadn’t taken that slow at
One: The keening suddenly changed to what sounded like a gasp of surprise at the same instant that Draco spurted onto his stomach. Some of it reached his chin.
The silence that befell around them felt heavy and downright alarming.Well, It was for Dracy’s side and she doesn’t know how Harry feels about the question because he didn’t respond.
This really is worse than facing dark wizards.
“Now. In me now but platonic” he whispered, hearing Harry chuckled below his ear before he slid up and nibbled on his earlobe,
He furrowed his eyebrows, “What do you mean?”
Fuck.
“We’ll see you everyone in an hour” Harry tapped Dean’s shoulder and nodded at Ginny, “Here”
He’s been running nonstop. Trying his best to get away but it was obvious he’s just running in circles, not really escaping. Just rounding the maze of this dark forest as his eyes sweep to one tree after one another. He wasn’t sure what to do but he kept his hope that maybe, maybe there’s still a chance for him to go back to where he should be, to where he want to be.
Draco cried out and tried to lift himself off to meet Harry but found he couldn’t when he had no energy to use. His mind is swirling in the certain space that had him speechless. All he wanted is for Harry to come so he could feel his juices inside.
“Asshole”
He felt his towering frame encases him, wide torso, cinched waist, and all the strength those muscles entails invoke a lot of unnecessary depraved images in his mind. He wasn’t able to hold back the whine that left his mouth when he felt Harry’s warm breath hovering above his ear.
“Okay” Draco nodded and sighed, “Will you come back early?”
"What's he like?" Ron asked curiously and Harry shrugged. Not knowing how to really say what he's like because he can think of multiple things, words and adjectives to describe the storm that's slowly preparing itself to devastate his throne.
“Slow down there, raven” he heard a voice, “Don’t go getting drunk on me, now”
Harry is no heartbreaker. He is nowhere near to be one.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not only so you can lean on me but also so I could lean on you” Harry bent down and her eyes widened when he kissed her lips.
His lithe form told how young he still is. Twenty and thriving. A bright future ahead of him, fabulous and at the beginning of his life to enjoy things, go somewhere, and see the beauty it has for young people like him. Live somewhere, go to different countries, dance in bars, hang out with friends. There are endless possibilities for Draco to do now that he still can, now that his body still can.
Dracy, herself, is lying on his bed sleeping. He took a deep breath and reminded himself that she’s pregnant. Walking over to his bed, he gently nudged her awake.
When basically all of him throbs in a debatable way, his gut is right. He’d always been quick on the uptake.
The man who he did not even know the name of.
He reached for her and took her shirt off as well, followed by her shorts and her panties before Harry took care of his boxers. He joined Dracy right after, lips trailing her legs, to her inner thighs, pecking a kiss to her soaked entrance, to her tummy, her breasts and taking one nipple at his mouth and entered her.
He giggled childishly, “It’s okay. I enjoyed it. It was amazing”
After they have ordered their foods and was just busy waiting for it to be served, Draco looked up to see Harry smiling at him like a lunatic.
His mouth closed to her other breast, teeth pulling on her nipple as his hands began to travel south. He quickly moved on his spot until he was hovering above her, pinning her with his gaze, taking in her expressions as Harry’s fingers dipped in her navel, drawing circles and tapping seductively.
“Gettin’ to know you, angel” he winked, licking his lips and Draco unconsciously followed the movement.
What?
He was quick to call back and delighted that Harry answered back, “Where the fuck are you, sweet? I had Blaise track your phone. We’re coming”
She bit her lips. She’s beginning to feel that familiar emotions inside her heart, her mouth suddenly wanted to blurt out something but before she could even, she cleared her throat.
Ron stood up and offered a hand, “Nice to meet you, Dracy”
“Anytime. Tell me if you’re uncomfortable and we’ll leave straight out of here”
“Harry James Potter”
Draco moaned hoarsely, arching his body, chest touching Harry’s as he encircled his legs around his waist to pull him closer, “Please, sir, need it so much, wanna make you cum”
He is as hungry for her as she is craving for him. That can’t be denied.
And pretty sure, Draco twice wished on his birthday cake for Harry to have a cardiac arrest. Evil but pretty satisfying because Harry is a goddamn cocoon in slimy bullshit.
He bit his lips when Harry’s hand returned to his throat, his hold loose as Harry lost himself from the way he was pounding like a beast in rut. He groaned and unconsciously tightened his hand as he let himself near his climax.
He gaped at the man who have the audacity greater than his friend, Pansy Parkinson. The man who did not bother to make himself look even presentable.
She gasped when Harry pulled her to sit sideways into his lap, one of his hands immediately encircling to her small waist to pull her close to his heat, “H-harry”
Except it proved to be not at all easy.
"You look gorgeous, Dray!" Daphne spoke and raised her glass before turning to look at Draco's company, "You brought us desert, I see"
But somehow, he didn’t know why he found himself parting his lips in astonishment. That man looks utterly...
Harry sighed. Whoever invented the word horny, he’s damn right.
Harry is his complete opposite. He never visits the bar and he’s your iced tea in a world full of whiskey.
Luna’s smile widened and she shook her head, “Blibbering humdingers? You don’t know that? They’re quite famous”
He bit his lips tight, front teeth burying in it almost to draw blood as Harry’s fingers grazed through his clothed cock, lightly not enough to cause friction but enough for him to whine.
The compliment itself wasn’t for the stranger but for Harry who’s suddenly few steps away from them. His arms crossed in his chest, flexing his muscles proudly with a grim expression on his godly face. The three piece suit he wore did things to her.
Then the last ones came into view. Oliver, Percy, Hannah, Angelina, Parvati, Padma, Fleur, Bill, Viktor, Pansy, Hermione, and lastly Blaise. His head looking around them with their smiling faces and the scowling ones from the Greengrass sisters. They successfully formed into circle with a gap from the side. His hands were overflowing with roses.
Fuck him, dude. Just fuck the man who now hides behind winks, cheeky smiles, and flirty statements ever since the party they attended from. Those casual touches he realized he isn’t prying off to the way they just fucking had a movie night last night.
As they walked around the grocery, Harry taking what he needs from aisle to aisle, not minding the voices and controlling the temper inside him, Dracy didn’t speak and tried her best to ignore them the same way Harry is doing.
His heart hammered but he willed himself to calm down a little when the curtains drew open as Pansy stepped inside. Her heels clinking on the floor as she stood beside him, eyeing him up and down.
“Why don’t we take this in the bedroom, baby?” Harry asked and before she could even answer, he bent down and carried her towards his room.
It was there since first day but it’s worse (or better) now.
He gathered enough seriousness and tried to convince himself to turn back immediately if he so much as see Draco trying to lure him in again before finally opening the door to see Draco leaning on the headboard, hugging a pillow.
“What’s that?” he asked when he noticed Harry’s other hand is holding something.
She was panting, screaming, and hurting.
He snarled his teeth and glaring when the man laughed haphazardly.
She snorted and was about to start cooking when she heard the floo activating followed by excited and joyful squeals.
Yes. He does. And it is fucking him and him fucking. That statement standing own its own.
Pansy grinned proudly, unaware of the conflictions currently raging in him.
“C’mon! It’ll be fun and besides we’re not getting anywhere so might as well have fun” he wiggled his eyebrows as he tightened his hold on him, “Come on. I know, I know you hate me, sure. But the lips says otherwise”
He encircled his arms around his waist. He leaned on to him and inhaled his scent. He felt Harry tensing even more.
Harry answered with a laugh, turning his head to look at him. There was a glint in his eyes, an expression Draco didn’t know he had it in him. He blushed when Harry winked with such confidence. He waved his hand nonchalantly, effortlessly gathering his things to his bag.
Draco blushed furiously, “Pansy! That is not what I am expecting” he grumbled, eyes scanning for the familiar rat’s nest.
At mornings, he would bring their breakfast in bed, filled with a stem of tulips and a small bar of chocolate she’s gotten to love since the night she saw it back at the cottage’s food cabinet. It’s always been a part of her cravings and she would not feel good if she doesn’t have even just a single bite.
Harry raised an eyebrow at him and pretended to act nonchalant. His strict resolve is merely holding on at the moment because Draco managed to crack it within the short time he met him.
“Harry, ssh. It’s alright. It’s alright. I’m h-here” even she stuttered at the end. She can feel tears prickling her eyes but fought not to shed them. She’s broken and she suffered from her own life but it’s not as much as Harry had been traumatized.
Harry bobbed his head up and down, his fingers beginning to encircle his rim. He whispered a lubricating charm and entered one finger. Draco cannot stop mewling, moaning, and whimpering. All these feelings inside him and the way Harry is driving him crazy are overwhelming in the best way possible.
He rubbed his cock across her cunt, coating it with her juices and growling at the sensations prickling in his shaft. He clenched his jaw as he slapped her clit with his cock repeatedly, loving how she jumps at the sensations hauling her senses.
“How are you feeling, Mr. Potter?” McGonagall asked as he sit down inside her office. Glasses falling a bit on her nose as she peered at him with observant eyes.
“You love it”
Harry knows he wouldn’t display her like how others have done to her for years.
It baffles her to no end that Harry acted so casual back that night then it pains her when she observed that Harry had gone a little colder. He didn’t shout but he’s not talking to her anymore unless it’s something important.
(See the end of the chapter for
He breathed calmly, “Then I guess I should make it worth your while, hmm?”
“Do you think the baby will be healthy?” Harry asked, eyes glued to the image as well.
Draco nodded. Even when he knew how sick this kind of love is, he cannot afford to disagree with the man or he will be hurt again.
He moaned loudly when Harry inserted another finger, his whole body shuddering at the sting and the pleasure and all the sensations invading his being. The pain combined nicely with how amazing Harry was preparing him. His spit useless as a lubricant and it was such a delicious burn that Draco found himself liking.
The claps around them were thunderous followed by each team’s cheering squad. Seamus have spelled their cheering louder, wanting to beat the others especially when he drooled around Dean’s magnificent hotness.
Because like he said, it’s his job to worry, not hers.
“Jump” Harry whispered, tapping his butt and Draco obeyed right away. Harry caught him with one hand. Draco’s legs hang loosely because of his jeans on his knees, not really removed, constricting him of locking his ankles around Harry’s back.
He took a spoon filled with food and began to feed her.
What’s the number one of the House of Potter morals? He doesn’t know and he doesn’t care. Fuck morals. His mind is clouded and he cannot brush it away. He’s blinded with the beauty offered to him.
He found himself just across the road, eyes glued to Draco’s house. His bedroom windows were open, a dim light Harry can say is from the lamp is the only thing giving color to the house.
“Let me treat you, angel. Miss you so much” Harry murmured before tugging his shirt upwards and laving at his nipple.
Draco nodded quickly, “Yes, please. Daddy. Reward, please”
Harry smiled as he rolled his tongue on his lips, having the urge to take one nipple on his mouth and unable to hold himself back, he bent down. He squeezed on her breast and he moaned as he darted his tongue out.
Draco whimpered, his head already swimming and his breathing ragged, “
P.S. I don't know why my other end note from the previous chapter is reappearing in this chapter.
She giggled, one arm braced on his nape while the other laid on her lap, “Breakfast?”
"You don't know what you're doing. Stop it" Harry warned and glared at him.
He stared and fake pouted, “Why not?”
Andy began to talk about the baby’s condition and which part is beginning to develop. While pointing at the hologram in front of them, easily classifying which is which while Harry and her have a hard time specifying.
What he initially thought would be the end of their beautiful story became a gateway for much more sinful things ever witness in the Malfoy household.
“I know but Luna—
Pecking a kiss on his head, Remus smiled sincerely, “Love you”
“Okay”
He kissed him by the nape, moaning beside Draco’s ear who purred back.
“Harry” Draco whined and tried to arch his back but Harry’s chest pinned him.
"Parties end at six in the evening if it's held here" Harry repeated, tone stricter this time. Draco had no choice but to agree. If he plans to seduce the man, he at least have to prove he's a good boy.
Harry chucked amusedly, his eyes glinting as he stared at him, “Woah. Brakes here, sugar. It’s my mouth who cannot shut up”
He tug on Harry’s dog tags, shivering when his fingers came in contact with the cold metal, “Harry, please, please” he begged.
“When will I meet him?”
Harry smirked at her as he chuckled darkly as he stood up, taking threatening steps to get closer, noticing the way the woman flinch and the regret that washed over her features.
“A-alpha” she can no longer keep herself from moaning. Harry smirked and brushed her knickers aside and completely felt her. He teased her clit with his thumb while her middle finger hovered over her wet hole.
She smiled, blushing as she took a sniff of the tulips that shockingly and confusingly smells like Harry.
Sirius moaned, beginning to roll his hips to feel more, hoping to chase the friction that just won’t come.
Harry began to thrust slowly, feeling the way Draco hugged him and pulled him tight, as if he was sucking him in more and the way he felt him shuddered made Harry slightly lose control.
Harry spluttered, trying to get out of his bounds and Draco smirked, “I thought you’re stronger than me, daddy?”
“Well,” he licked his lips and Draco was stuck on the movement of his tongue.
Draco felt his eyes flattering close at the sound of Harry’s restrained voice, hips bucking uselessly as he grunted and groaned.
Did you like the chapter??? 🙏🏼
“You don’t see your mistake, do you? When you bought her for thousands of galleons, what did she think? She felt she’s treated like a thing to be owned. And I hope you’re not going to treat her like that, Harry. Not because she’s an omega she should be someone who will only do what you need of her”
Harry can say he’s lucky because he managed to get her without any preamble. His alpha wanted her omega but the question remains, does Harry want Dracy?
Draco yelped when he was suddenly thrown. Eyes going wide as he took in his surroundings. He bounced on the king sized bed as Harry towered over him with a cold expression, rage filling his nostrils as he slowly began to unbutton his sleeves.
“Take your time”
“Sure” he agreed then stopped. What? No, no!
Her heart hammered as Harry’s husky voice resonated behind her, body close to hers as she felt the warm radiating off of his body. She bit her lips, already loving the idea of a massage. She will never say no to a massage.
Harry studied her for a moment. Eyes observing her facial expressions as if reading her thoughts. After a second, he nodded, “Like usual, you’ll tell me when it’s too much?”
Just what in quidditch’s name happened? He knew it was a wrong idea to pair him with Potter in the first place. He was aware the man is hopeless in Potions and Professor Slughorn must think it’s something funny.
“Relax, hotstuff. I got this, jerk. Listen, let’s have a bet”
“I’m already so hard for you, love. Daddy’s cock is already hard for you. Want to fuck you, want to take you again and again in this bed, wanting to make you cum once in my fingers, twice on my tongue and thrice on my cock.”
He smiled. Just like the reaction he wished for.
Harry smiled before sitting up, “Can you get up, Draco?”
Harry bowed his head, feeling the water cascading over to his back sliding down to the floor. What the fuck did he just do?
“Are you okay?”
“Oh, yeah? Then how would you explain the thousand hickeys I saw from your neck from the day I was hired with this job?”
“Yes, yes. I get your point. Why don’t you go over there and show him what happens if Draco is jealous” Blaise creep in beside him, smirking and urging him by waving his hand.
“Love, come on. You’ll have me later” Harry whispered, urging to pull Draco’s head away from his shoulder, “Straighten up, baby. I need to feed you first”
“Don’t even think about it” Draco butted in, not looking away from his book.
"I'm still eighteen"
Draco opened his eyes and smiled at him, “W-what about you?” he asked as he saw Harry still hard behind those fitted trousers that did everything to stir his imaginations.
“Can you go find Harry? Tell him it’s urgent”
She bit her lips and gulped. She doesn’t know what to do at all. This completely came out of blue. She was just reading a book, dozed off and now, her father is here? Who wouldn’t be so shocked?
(See the end of the chapter for
To take over, claim her in the wooden floors, atop the dining table, have her behind bookshelves, in the bed, under the shower, and everywhere they can fit in.
The way he had admitted to wanting Harry. It is so fucking hot. No one in his past relationships had made a first move and certainly not as motivated and determine as Draco. Harry always did the first move and it was him who always did the wooing and actions.
“Mr. Malfoy” he chastised gently, “What are you doing?”
When Sirius heard that familiar disappointed click of tongue, he stilled. He willed himself to focus on Remus’ eyes. He wanted to bent down and kiss him deep on the lips with tongues and all.
Dracy was fast on her feet at the sound of Harry’s arrival. She have a book at hand and was just casually reading something on the couch when she heard the silent noise of the apparition.
He was so sensitive that a few strokes can probably get him off but he knew Harry was far from done with him. He was clearly taking his time, enjoying controlling to have fun with him like he had said. Now, he’s coming to regret letting those words out of his mouth.
“No! I don’t wanna hear it! Merlin, they’re so fucking loud. I cannot even cast any silencing charms!” James cried out.
Draco nibbled on his bottom lip and played with his fingers, "W-what did I do?"
He hates the man but those kisses are superb.
“You do not worry inside here. You’re my omega.” he murmured, letting out a little bit of his Alpha scent to freshen her up, entice her to let go for a bit.
Harry bent down and wiped the sweat from her face. She has her eyes closed and was obviously tired. He kissed her cheeks before sliding down to her ear, “You did so good for our baby, love. Did amazing for out little one”
Harry looked at the shops in Diagon Alley. Looking for that specific flower shop owned by the Patil Twins. When he spotted it, he saw Parvati Patil by the window, arranging some flowers.
Molly worked hard for it so they wore it with gratefulness. Harry’s and now, Draco’s friends sang Christmas carols as they made their way to the Great Hall, catching younger student’s attention and greeting them.
He watched her take a deep breath before closing her eyes. As her breath evened out, Harry smiled at her, he was content to stare at the beauty beside her as he tucked themselves under the blankets. He peck a kiss on her lips before pushing his arm under her head to use as a pillow.
Draco avoided him like the plague.
"Alright. Gather around everyone! We're going to play some dare games!" he heard Pansy shouted at the top of her lungs.
She bit her lips when Harry began to sniff her and afterwards licked at her collarbone, “Ngh” she whimpered when he bit her on her neck and sucked hard.
He sighed. He doesn’t have an issue about her wanting to know his life but trying to know everything that’s going on is not something he can appreciate. He loves at least having a privacy of his own, especially when it comes to the woman he’s associating his life with.
There was silence that followed and Harry spoke before Remus could lecture him for it, “I know you’ll tell me that I shouldn’t but I did. And I'm kind of, sort of—no. I'm utterly freaking out"
It didn’t take long before he felt it.
“You’re so adorable, sexytary” Harry leaned over. His smile turned into a smirk when Draco tried to act so tough and didn’t lean away. He met his gaze but there was that little tick of his jaw and that gulp.
Dracy looked down, “I don’t want to, uh, don’t want to—
He would answer,
“W-what happened?” he wasn’t sure if he wants to know but Harry always came back without a bruise before. Why now? Was it really about what Fred said?
They say never to do it obviously, not to overdo it, never drive up the hill in one go, never uncover instantly and most of all, never ever be too careless.
“Fuck baby. You taste so good” Harry complimented. He sat up and watched the way his fingers disappeared in and out of his hole. The way Draco quivered and his eyes rolling at the back of his head. It was such a sight, Harry palmed his cock.
“Sssh” Harry shushed and inserted a finger. All morals thrown aside because his godfather is right. Sirius is right.
“Aren’t you coming out? Astronomy’s in three minutes” he asked, not letting himself think too much at the expression he can see in Draco’s eyes— when the hell did he become Draco by the way?
Harry winked before turning his head to the side and expression turned serious, “Eleven o’clock”
“Malfoy?”
“So, what are you doing?” he asked, right hand caressing the edge of the table, “Do you want to go out for lunch?”
“Merlin, Potter. You have a meeting with the Minister today”
Draco let his own hands roam over the muscled torso pinning him down. His palm came into contact with the tattoos first before he massaged his pecs to his nipples to his abdomen. He imagined running his tongue on them and taste the salty sweat that trickled down but Harry was taking the lead right now.
Oh, he’s going to get it alright. He will make sure of it.
Draco squealed when he felt an arm wrapped around his waist and pulled him closer to a hard body. His eyes widened for a moment before they flickered with mischief.
He rolled his eyes, “Okay. You made your point but this is ridiculous. Stop analyzing what I do”
And now they’re here, in the middle of the child’s section.
It wasn’t Harry.
He even had the thought of having him into total submission, have him lying in a bed, waiting patiently for the Harry to pounce, take his time to taste him. And by the time, Harry got him to where he wanted him to, Draco would be begging. With that innocent eyes, pouty lips, and tears rolling down his cheeks.
He shook his head to try to wipe the distractions away and focus on writing what he has to tell Sirius. He knows he can rely on him and he wouldn't judge or criticize but would offer sincere suggestions unlike Ron who had warned him not to do anything his mind tells him to.
“Not yet but we’ll plan on it”
He doesn’t know why and how but all those touches and time together in the privacy of his place, he let himself fell without so much as a fight. His fierceness in their field of job didn’t quite reach to any of their shared escapades.
She gulped when the doorbell rang again. She played with her fingers and looked down to her tummy, sighing when she cannot no longer see her toes. Merlin. How big is their baby going to be?
He nodded and nodded, already wanting Harry to fuck his pussy fast and nice. Praise him again and again for being such a good baby.
Harry pushed in until he bottomed out. He gave Draco time to adjust first before he started to move, slowly, loving the way how tight Draco still is. His hole clenching around his cock and pulling him in even more.
“I’m busy, Harry” he said, “This is not a good time. I’m working”
And as they both released their own orgasm. Draco on the kitchen counter and Harry inside him, they panted, chest heaving and racing to gain back the air they’ve spent. There were no words being exchanged as he winced when Harry pulled out.
An involuntary whimper escapes him when Draco sits up straight, chuckling at Harry’s distress and looking him over intensely. “Merlin you are beautiful.” Draco says a few moments later and reaches for his own shirt. He starts to slowly unbutton it and Harry struggles against his restraints after the second button, desperately wanting to touch.
Also all my love and adoration to Monika, the best beta/cheerleader/alpha ever. She deserves so much more than me and my rambling.
“What’s your favourite memory from before Hogwarts?” Lisa asked.
by Merlin. He regretted nearly everything he did in the last two years but what else could he have done? Refuse the mark, run away and leave his mother to... No. He could never have done that.
She had a point. At their core they were still Slytherin, and they protected one another. Still, he could just spend that time in the relative safety of his dorm and just not face anyone.
Room of Requirement.
A knock interrupted their quiet a while later and Neville pushed his head in. He didn’t bat an eye as he saw his boyfriend cuddling with Draco and Pansy.
His eyes snapped up as he realized where he knew the smell from. A soft, “Draco” fell from his mouth involuntarily and within a fracture of a second his eyes had focused on the blond in question only to find that he was already looking at Harry too. Blushing vehemently, Harry averted his eyes in an instant. While looking away he noticed that Malfoys table was already clean, not a trace of the potion to be found.
The slight blush when the topic of Neville’s pet devil snare had come up, came to Draco’s mind and intermingled with Blaise saying “rewards” and without wanting to, Draco felt himself blush.
Harry gasped and Draco was about to pull back, when he felt a hand at the back of his head, stroking over the buzzed parts of his undercut and keeping him from pulling away. And suddenly Draco could taste more of Harry, could feel the heat of Harry’s tongue against his. Without really thinking about it, he pulled Harry closer still, their once chaste kiss turning heated. Draco’s brain gave up on thinking all together.
Damn, she drove an excellent bargain. He felt guilty for dropping all his problems on her. She shouldn’t have to worry about him sleeping enough, eating enough, socialising enough. But in the end, she was right; he needed to start somewhere if he ever wanted to get better. So he gave in and nodded.
They stood in the middle of the market for a few more seconds, faces alight with giddy smiles, arms still around each other, before Harry gently pulled from the embrace. He caught Draco’s hand in his and together they continued browsing the market, sneaking glances at each other every now and then.
Despite the small notes at the bottom of each picture, it took him nearly 5 minutes to understand what he was looking at.
“I am not judging you Draco. Sadly I can imagine how parts of the student body may treat you but I can’t do anything without a formal complaint.” She paused again, clearly wanting Draco to step forward and tell her about what was happening in empty corridors and abandoned classrooms. Draco only shook his head. With a sigh McGonagall continued. “I have noticed that Miss Parkinson is taking food with her whenever she leaves the Hall so I presume you have been eating?”
“Don’t! It’s not your fault and Pansy only told because she found you unconscious in the dorms and Madame Pomfrey couldn’t get you to wake up. I came as soon as I could…” Harry broke off. His eyebrows were drawn together and he nervously chewed on his bottom lip. “Merlin you were so damn cold. It took an hour for you to even get close to a normal temperature.”
An hour later, Draco sat with Hannah and Blaise, both of them pretty drunk and too close to snogging in front of him for his liking. There had been some Truth or Dare proposed shortly before but Draco had had enough forced socialising for one evening and had opted to stay where he was. Apparently the other two felt somewhat similarly. Draco leaned his head back against the cushioned couch and sighed, considering just getting up and leaving but deciding against it.
A few days later and Draco was certain of three things: One, that the time he could spend without touching Harry had reduced itself to 12 hours; two, that the pull of the bond was becoming stronger at an alarming rate; and three, that the symptoms had changed, so now he felt pins and needles in his chest — the point where the bond was located — and the tiredness had evolved to being all encompassing, to the point where simply blinking was too much effort. Needless to say, this had only made him crankier.
My love and gratitude once again for my most wonderful beta Monika. Honestly, without her I would have never finished writing this
Immediately Malfoy looked slightly frightened again, raising an eyebrow in a silent question.
In addition to the lack of sustenance there was the lack of sleep, which was partly his own fault. In order to avoid people, he tended to go to breakfast as early as possible. He slipped into the Great Hall the moment the breakfast materialised on the tables and left before anyone else had sat down, his bag filled with whatever food had been closest to him.
Apparently ignoring the implication that he would almost certainly make simple mistakes, Harry began assembling the ingredients.
“No touching my mark, no calling me ‘Malfoy’. Besides that, nothing your submissive little ass would even dare to try.” The sneer is back and Harry loves it.
He didn’t deserve this, not after the past years of hatred and pain he caused for her. But Granger sounded genuine, no trace of mockery in her voice or in her features, she just stood in front of the portrait, waiting and watching him. Draco let the sentences replay in his mind twice before he found the strength to speak.
“Kinky bastard.” he muttered, turning towards the mirror once more, to check his reflection.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know yet. I’ll probably take a bit of time off to take care of Grimmauld Place properly and do some soul searching.”
Blaise caught his eyes and asked, “Are you sure?” which simply resulted in him being shooed away by both Draco and Pansy.
Now like Minerva said, I specialise in non-invasive mind healing, which commonly deals with trauma or mental illness. Within the non-invasive field there are different styles of therapy, such as guided pensieve views, art therapy or conversation based therapy, which is my specialty. No matter the ‘style’ of therapy there is the option of a supplementary potion regime, depending on the needs of the patient.”
The constricting and contracting of the walls around his cock was enough to drive Draco over the edge as well, as he buried himself deep into Harry.
“Oh good! You’re ready. Hermione is waiting in the common room for us and Blaise said he’ll try to join us later, you know how he is in the mornings.” Draco did know. He had shared a dorm with him for six years after all, even his bed on some occasions.
“Yes?” McGonagall waited for him to elaborate.
, you may call me Draco.” Despite the nonchalance of Draco’s words, he looked nervous. Grey eyes flitted across the room and Harry could see the pale skin flush pink anew. Not knowing what to say or do, he stood awkwardly before turning with a mumbled, “uh.. yeah… I- I’ll see you later then… Draco,” and left.
Before his hand could fully wrap around his aching cock, Harry grabbed his wrist and pinned it above his head, grabbing his other hand and doing the same. “No,” Harry growled, “I still have plans for you.” Draco groaned desperately, his hands clutching at the sheets as he watched Harry slowly rid himself of his jeans and then his boxers.
(See the end of the chapter for
The low chorus of “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” combined with barely concealed sobs forced him to look up at Potter, and the sight nearly broke his heart. He wanted so desperately for Potter to stop crying — to see that dimple on his left cheek that only appeared when Potter smiled widely.
Things are looking up for Draco, don't they?
This time when he laid his head into his partners lap, Harry reached his fingers into his hair.
The decision was taken out of his hands when Harry took his hips, pushed him back against the door and kissed him hungrily. A moan escaped Draco’s lips and he pulled Harry even closer, one hand resting on the small of his back, the other on his neck.
Draco wanted to say that they had been talking multiple times a week for months now, but he knew what Potter meant, knew that this was an olive branch, a chance to actually talk about what happened to them, to sort out their complicated history.
Potter kept up and let out a small laugh. “Any chance I can convince you to change that? Neville and Hannah asked me to help them with the new shielding spell today, but I still have some questions about the potions essay. Besides, I know ‘Mione misses discussing the Runes with you.”
Finally free, Harry rushed into the bathroom to have an icy cold shower.
Even though she still didn’t move, Draco could see her mind whirring from thought to thought until finally she unlocked her limbs and began walking again. Confused, he fell into step next to her and asked, “What, you’re just going to accept it and call it a day? No questions, nothing?”
When they pulled apart, Draco looked dazed and Harry’s hand remained cupping Draco’s cheek. Softly Harry whispered, “I know you said falling in love is scary; but being with someone you love… It feels a lot like flying.”
“It might surprise you, but you do need to eat sometimes. Shocking, I know.” Harry said with fake confidence, gesturing to the plate in his hand.
It took a few minutes before Draco’s brain had the capacity to think on the last paragraph. Taking the floo back to Hogwarts felt like cheating. The headmistress was right when she wrote that he couldn’t hide from society forever. His eyes fell to his new tattoo, still wrapped in some clear plastic and he thought of his new haircut, short and wavy and most importantly: turquoise. There was no reason for anyone to tell him that he looked like Lucius, because he didn’t. Not anymore.
Harry playfully slaps Chris on the arm and then turns serious with a sigh. “Honestly, I don’t even know anymore.”
Harry was certain that the Slytherin had meant it as an insult but Harry couldn’t help but take it as a challenge: Time to give Malfoy a Patronus-worthy memory.
Draco remained silent and a few moments later they arrived at an inconspicuous painting of a fruit bowl. The soft order to reach out and tickle the pear seemed strange, but Draco did and moments later he stood amidst a flood of house elves.
“Don’t mention it,” Harry chuckled and turned. “One more thing though…”
“I was planning on getting some Ancient Runes work done before the study group session today.” Draco replied. Careful to not appear like he was running away, Draco picked up his pace again. It was too bloody cold out.
Malfoy turned to him, stopped dead in his tracks and apparated away. Harry vigilantly checked the windows and his surroundings for the rest of the day.
It took some effort, but Harry remained in the cottage and stoically forbade himself to think about Malfoy for the rest of the day.
“Can I hug you?” Draco blurted, unable to resist the need to comfort the other, and not knowing how else to do it. Upon Potter nodding, he scooted closer and pulled him into his arms, uncaring about his undone shirt. He buried his nose into the dark mess of hair, letting his own tears fall again while murmuring, “It’s okay. I forgive you.” over and over.
Without a warning Malfoy grabbed his wrist and raised his hand to eye level. “Your predominant mount is Jupiter, no surprise here, but you also have very clear upper and lower Mars mounts.”
And there sitting next to him was Harry, clenching his empty glass with a shaking hand, looking absolutely confused and slightly horrified. Realising what must be going on, Draco shot Blaise a glare, willing him to take the attention off of the Gryffindor, who was starting to look green by then.
Once again Harry had only Malfoy on his mind. The way the other had smiled while casting his sparkles, the way his eyes shimmered as he sat there, the way he was nicer nowadays, the vulnerability. Harry didn’t exactly know when it happened, but at some point Draco had become something close to a friend to him, someone he was excited to meet up with.
Harry spent all Thursday thinking about Malfoy. The Slytherin was clearly adapt with magic, being nearly as good as Hermione in both charms and transfiguration, so why couldn’t he produce a Patronus if not for the memory?
Harry felt a tear escape his eyes, and tried blinking quickly to stop the others from falling too. His gaze fell upon the dark blue parchment and he picked it up.
They chat for a while longer before Harry heads for the showers. When he redresses he notices a piece of paper in his right shoe and reads it.
For the first time this school year Draco was glad when dinner rolled around. Albeit he had simply studied, but the presence of the Gryffindor witch had had him on edge all afternoon and he was drained.
“Never have I ever fucked a Weasley,” Seamus stated, smirking at Harry and Hermione, only to yelp in surprise when Luna reached for her glass too. Hermione glared at Seamus before she drank.
He’s growing hard when he finally registers that Malfoy has basically just given him an out of their current position. Harry tries rolling backwards and lands on his knees behind Malfoys head. Before he can use the position to his advantage though, Malfoy shoots into a kneeling position and they start grappling again.
They both cried freely for what felt like hours, and neither of them made to move once their tears had dried, simply taking comfort in the warmth of each other. Slowly Draco felt the heaviness in his stomach being replaced with a fluttering airiness he couldn’t quite place.
Draco manages some social interactions and Ancient Runes are being translated.
“You okay?”
While it is unclear if Mister Malfoy also abided wizarding customs by properly courting his betrothed, it is clear that both wizards are very happy with each other, as visible on the picture on the right.
The ever present smile on Gemma’s lips turned a bit somber. “I’m afraid quite a lot, even though I normally like to get to know my patients on their own terms. I have read your trial transcripts and am aware of the intricacies of your parole. Minerva also mentioned your… let’s say problems with a certain officer and that you seem to be avoiding meal times.”
The piercing had been another impulse decision while Toby had taken a break from tattooing. Leah had convinced him to get a ‘daith’ after ranting about how perfect his ear shape was for this specific piercing. Feeling daring Draco had accepted, shifting on the tattoo stool so that Leah could reach his ear better.
He walked Malfoy through several meditation techniques that night, not once asking about the memories again. They planned another meeting for Friday evening and parted ways.
“PITY?” bellowed Harry. “Ever thought I might help you simply because I care? You could have told me! Of course I would have helped!”
“Like that, do you?” Malfoy comments on the erection pressing into his back, his voice sounds slightly strained, and Harry simply tightens his hold. A few seconds later he feels Malfoy tap against his elbow and lets him go. Before Malfoy can tease him more about his obvious arousal, Malcolm calls them into the line up to see each other off and Malfoy joins him on the instructor side.
Draco blamed the alcohol.
“Harry is my boyfriend now.” he said out of the blue.
While Draco monologued, Potter’s quill dutifully scratched away onto his parchment. But as Draco paused for a second, Potter interrupted, “Any oil? It seems strange that there is enough of a distinction to separate water and distilled water but not enough to differentiate between the different types of oil.”
“No, not really. I just know you.”
They had lain cuddling like this so often it had lost its awkwardness long ago, though it had been some time since they had held each other. During the war both had needed comfort and reassurance. Since returning to Hogwarts however, Draco had purposely evaded Pansy. He couldn’t bear to drag her down, to hurt her too. She still had a chance.
Slowly, the Great Hall began to fill. The population of Hogwarts rising to meet the day. Despite there being more students, Draco made no move to abandon his discussion with Hermione. Instead, he opted for another serving of yoghurt with berries and remained seated.
Draco made a mental note to thank McGonagall for showing him the kitchens. Dinner had started half an hour ago and the halls were empty. Despite his uneventful breakfast on Saturday, Draco hadn’t felt confident enough to face the packed Hall at dinnertime and had opted for ducking into the kitchen for a quick meal. The elves were more than willing to provide some food before the official start of dinner and had even forced Draco to take some cookies with him when he left.
All of a sudden, there were arms around him, hugging him from behind. “Love. You said the exact same thing 10 minutes ago. Come on. It’s time for dinner.”
Harry thought about reassuring him, telling him he hadn’t heard anything, telling him the lies the other hoped to be true. But he couldn’t. Instead he said, “Don’t look at me like that, it’s not the first time I’ve woken up to a roommate having a sex dream. Let’s not make a big deal out of it okay?” He grabbed his clothes for the day and headed towards the bathroom. Just before he entered he turned once more, adding “I’m sorry I brought it up.” He closed the door and got ready for the day.
“You can call me Hermione, you know?” She offered and the smile grew wider and warmer.
“I shou-..should have been sent to- Az-… -Azkaban!” His brain was still repeating all the things Morris had thrown at him earlier.
Draco waved it off and went over the general lesson plan with Potter.
It took almost half an hour before Harry so much as stirred in Draco’s lap again.. Overtaken by the need to protect and reassure Harry, Draco forgot all about the public setting and leaned down to place a gentle kiss on his boyfriend’s lips. They would deal with everyone else later, for now all that mattered was that Harry was sitting in his lap.
A glance at the clock above the fireplace showed that it hadn’t even been an hour since his departure, some of the younger years would even still be in class.
Draco had done over the past few weeks, he had forgotten about how soon this visit to his parole officer was due. Yet here he was, nervously fidgeting with the hems of his sleeves while obediently climbing the stairs to the Headmistresses office.
“More of an old one,” she said. “I hadn’t seen a lot of him for a while either. He’s been busy as well. All my friends… busy, busy, busy,” she teased. “But it’s been good. Sometimes I think we’re utterly incompatible, but he makes the effort worth it. He can do a wicked thing with his… but you don’t want to hear about the intimate details,” she laughed.
“And you looked like you were having fun, Harry.”
Tears were clinging to Draco’s eyelashes, and his cheeks were sodden. The sight broke Harry’s heart.
The position and the subtle control were exciting, he was so
“Did you hear what I
like you to be comfortable. I’d like you to

Potter looked like he’d attempted to smile but quickly given up. “But what if I’m always broody?”
in how Draco was spending his time. It was extremely unnerving.
Potter hesitated, appeared to mull over the question. Draco didn’t rush him. “I… suppose,” he replied after a while. “Yes, a bit. Maybe. It’s… different with you.”
But it was time to make a wand. Or blow the place up, whichever came first.
“One smack for every second that you wilfully ran over my deadline.” Harry was abruptly very concerned about his timekeeping. “So, eight in total.” That didn’t seem so bad. Harry hoped. “Stand.”
’ when you're speaking to me like I'm five years old?”
. Yes, definitely. Harry couldn’t shake the word out of his head.
Yes, Draco did. He’d told Potter that in answer to his inane questions often enough. Draco was tempted to ask if that’s what the apprenticeship would focus on. But that hardly seemed the point since Potter was either taking the piss or
, thank you.”
But although life felt more settled now, Harry didn’t believe for a second that Draco had forgotten what Harry had told him. And the essential piece of information which Harry still hadn’t confirmed.
An interesting night followed in the dormitory. The absence of Potter’s usual droning snores was very telling. In the darkness behind the drapes around the bed next to Potter’s, Draco listened to intriguing, unmistakable sounds and congratulated himself on a task well-commenced.
“Potter?”
Confused about the replacement of the comfort which had so recently been taken from him, but keen to regain some points for better behaviour, Harry stuffed the pillow back where it was.
But perhaps Harry

“I know. I feel like I should be at least considering my future though.”

“What happened?” was Draco’s predicable question.
Harry’s cock gave a violent twitch. Only Malfoy could utter his title with that enticing distaste.
“But, it’d be good for -”

Harry did, his cock was all worked up now, but still…
“No…” she said slowly, as if Harry was being dim. “He can be blacklisted. It’s a wandmaker safety system,” she added, possibly due to Harry’s incredulous expression. “It’d stop him from purchasing a new wand. We don’t advertise it. People would be upset. But I don’t like to blacklist someone unless it
Well, if Draco was going to
Draco was impressed by the coolness of the response and returned it in kind. “And it will be tomorrow, as well. So, I’m told.”
When Harry eventually raised his head, it took immense willpower to meet Draco’s gaze. Harry felt too exposed, not ready to deal with whatever response would greet him.
“What was… bloody
Harry did feel momentarily better, but his panic began to rise again.
“What?”
“I’m glad you understand that.” Draco placed Jemima gently on the bedside table. She immediately rolled off and onto the floor.
? Harry swiftly returned to his job, off-balance with his lack of sight, the bloody bouncy mattress, and his rising panic as he moved. With his sweaty hands struggling to keep their hold on each other, his thigh muscles burning, and trying to ignore the demands of his own need to come, Harry rocked faster. Faster,

simple. That doesn’t mean that the advice is wrong though.”
Draco straightened his spine and aimed to portray unflappable, graceful self-confidence. “You think so? Finnigan, are you busy right now?”
But as he let himself understand what Potter had done for him, there was only one right thing to do.
It was, Harry acknowledged. He rose from his seat by the bedroom window and made his way back to the bed. Back to Draco. Back to the future he was aiming for.
But Harry wasn’t done yet.
A distant part of Draco’s mind began to holler at him that this harassment of his sponsor could be a direct route to expulsion. But Draco was strangely confident that however this panned out, Potter would not be running to the Headmistress to relate the story.
“Harry. Look at me.” Turning his head, Harry did as instructed. “I think…” Draco audibly and deeply inhaled. “That you’ve shagged a whole lot of
Harry became aware that neither Ron nor Draco were looking at him anymore. Following their gazes, he realised that they were both watching the fruit bowl on the coffee table as it violently rattled against the wood. A red apple toppled over the rim of the bowl, rolled across the table, and thumped onto the carpet.
When had Malfoy done that? How long
And Harry abruptly recognised that things were about to get worse by becoming even

“I just, I’d thought things would be different, somehow. Now that I’ve… I did what they wanted.”

anus which you’re intending to buff your wand in.”
Very impressive for an inept lion. Draco wondered if Potter might be taking notes from the Slytherins.
Regretting his honesty, Harry imagined a wide variety of both brutally direct and delicately cruel methods which Draco could utilise to effectively deal with something when suitably compelled to. But it was strange; Harry didn’t know whether to feel terrified of what Malfoy might do or glad that he had a person who cared enough to defend him.
A particular movement drew out a gasp marginally louder than the others. Draco’s spine arced more forcefully upwards, and his heels dug deeper into Harry’s back.

Harry groaned with gratitude as his rim stretched to accommodate the invader, then his inner walls shifted as it moved in, in… a tiny bit out, then Harry almost shrieked as it relentlessly continued inwards, forcing its way into Harry’s rectum. More, more, bloody hell… how much more? Harry could stop its progress with a single spoken word, but he was not inclined to. He’d never had anything as large as this inside him. And he was thankful for every inch of it.

Harry’s arsehole clenched in approval.

His discomfort must have shown on his face.
The subtle threat worked. “I… I reassured him that I hadn’t done anything wrong. And he accepted that. And I
“It’s okay, Draco. I expect you to be honest,” he added, in case Draco was feeling reluctant to be open about Harry’s performance.
to me! Nothing I do can please
He thought that his inner battle was about to be lost just as Draco stilled above him, timing impeccable as always.
Still worried, but attempting honesty as requested, Harry answered, “I want to be taken care of by you.”
But as he heard a voice from along the corridor a short distance away, he knew some things would never change. Resisting the urge to stride quickly in the opposite direction, Draco squared his shoulders, found what remained of his centre of superior indifference and stood where he was, waiting.
Harry stopped talking, still anxious about his imminent schedule failure. He was letting people
Intrigued despite the probability of yet more insults, Harry waited.
Wrong, wrong, wrong. Harry had felt like utter crap; dirty and ashamed of his desires and he could barely look at Oliver afterwards. But Harry hadn’t admitted how much the words had hurt. He’d masked it with indifference towards the relationship instead. And he still wouldn’t tell him, especially not with an audience.
“Good,” Potter replied with the ever-chipper tone of someone who had
“But we could -”
“I am,” confirmed Draco.
Draco was content to let him, not to rush this, but Potter soon delved for more. The tongue returned for a second pass, pressing inside, and unfortunately Potter’s mouth was as hazardous as Draco remembered.
Malfoy stood in increments; palms exposed in a gesture of peace as he cautiously shuffled behind his chair. “Okay, your eyes are looking a bit scary. And your skin’s starting to do that… glowy thing. Maybe you should sit down again. We could redo the breathing exercise.”

to remove that contact before something… more was demanded of him. Harry didn’t
Harry tried to shove the urge down. It was just a false anomaly. Experience had taught Harry that he wouldn’t like it. Not
, in private. In public, Draco was the prodigal son, a perfect example of a Malfoy, but his father knew the truth.
But the one remaining constant was Potter’s attention to Draco. Potter remained persistently keen to involve Draco in unwanted social common room interactions, but this was becoming a steadily more difficult task due to Potter’s strange reluctance to converse with his housemates.
Where it belongs. If only Harry was confident about where that
Harry complied.
Potter’s increasing attempts to initiate conversations beyond the boundaries of their thrice daily meetings were beginning to grate on Draco’s nerves. His study times in the evenings were marred by Potter’s furtive glances and mindless chatter as he tried to involve Draco in conversations.
Standing with his bum cheeks cupped in Draco’s hands, surrounded by a shelved assortment of food products and the door leading to the Weasleys to his right, Harry wasn’t sure how to react.
us all day and trying to get out of the frame. This seems different… like he wants to talk to us.”
Draco was suddenly anxious for this to last a little longer. “Wait…
. And he needed to
It wasn’t far; Malfoy was seated again on the couch and was pointing to the same spot between his legs that Harry had knelt in earlier. Gingerly, with aching limbs, Harry shuffled over as quickly as he could and bowed his head. Looking down, he regarded his reddened cock and wondered if he would be happier if he was allowed orgasm today or denied it.
that.
“I won’t. You’ll like this,” he added, hoping his assumption was correct.
“Me? I didn’t tell him anything! I didn’t even speak to him.”
“Exactly how much do you imagine it?”
Draco had also learnt that ignoring the call habitually led to unwanted drama, so he dutifully replied, “What, Potter?”
Harry opened his eyes. Malfoy was standing in the doorway to Harry’s conservatory, peering down in obvious concern at where Harry knelt surrounded by chips of glass that used to be the large windows which bordered the room. The furniture hadn’t faired much better. On reflection, this might not have been the best choice of venue to calm down in, the plants hadn’t been as relaxing as he’d hoped.
Ron blinked patiently at both of them for several moments before he prompted, “Sugar?”
Now, as Harry further curved his spine away from Malfoy’s torso, only a strong grip on his hips kept Harry on Malfoy’s lap. If either of Malfoy’s hands slipped, Harry would end up on the floor. Although Harry’s tiptoes were connected enough with the tiles on either side of the kitchen chair to give him leverage to move his hips, the angle wouldn’t provide enough balance to prevent a backwards fall to the tiles.
“Do you really think I’d
Potter blinked, clearly baffled yet again as Draco stooped to gather the rest of his work.
“You’re…
Oh. Right.
He needed to improve the situation. If Potter presented a bad report to the Headmistress, then Draco’s time at Hogwarts was over. He didn’t want to think what might happen to him then. Draco would be nineteen when he graduated, and with suitable qualifications behind him, he should have a chance at independence. But that wasn’t going to happen for Draco. Employers in Britain would still view him as an untrustworthy Malfoy, and he had no financial means of venturing elsewhere.
“True,” Ron agreed. “Are you liking the job, though?”
“I thought that’s what you’d want.”
get out of this deal?” Harry asked as he shifted his gaze to meet Draco’s.
“Yes, Potter. As I’ve previously informed you, I’m extremely interested in Potion development,” Draco answered. “But in some societies, it’s polite to wait for a response before pawing at other people’s belongings.”
After he’d made it down about three more steps, Harry realised that Draco wasn’t following him. He turned, curious about the delay and saw that Draco was regarding him with a scrutinising gaze and a quirked eyebrow. Harry was about to ask what the problem was when he suddenly understood.
Their torsos pressed together as Potter’s mouth and tongue slid against Draco’s. Nice, although predictably unimpressive, but then Potter’s hand snuck its way to the nape of Draco’s neck, not precisely restraining, but firmly suggesting that Draco stay exactly where he was.
if he was being rude. Not to
Draco glanced at him expectantly, but Harry ignored the silent question.
Harry lost sight of Malfoy as he moved behind him. Malfoy’s position was soon confirmed though as Harry felt what surely had to be the tip of the plug press against his abused hole. The silicone was slightly cool and very wet, perhaps Harry had finally earned lubricant again. Or perhaps Malfoy’s semen was coating it. He gritted his teeth as the plug nudged inwards. Although his anus felt well loosened from its previous use, it still didn’t seem quite relaxed enough to take this. But Malfoy was persistent as he patiently twisted the object and altered its angle in careful movements, easing it inside and approaching what Harry hoped was the widest point. Harry’s dangerous level of arousal had again started to become an issue. This thing was so
No, Harry was going to pull himself together and seek out the
and you suggest that I go cook some bloody
Potter beamed. “Sounds interesting. Can I see it?” The parchment was in Potter’s hand before Draco could protest. “You’re interested mostly in Potions, right?”
Finally, Harry sighed. “Can I find out what he wants?”
“Why not?”
“Is that so?” asked Harry, feigning calm.
For horribly long seconds, Potter didn’t answer. Fighting his growing panic, Draco tried to utilise logic and recall if he knew a resuscitating spell. And whether it was wise to move someone who was unconscious. It’d been a short fall, but harm could’ve been done. Potter could have a concussion; he could’ve broken his
“I… suppose.”
“I’ve had many not-special someone’s. It’s not a secret, but you didn’t ask. Are you a virgin?” The deepening flush on Potter’s cheeks answered for him. Taking Potter’s virginity would be
This was insanity. Harry was leaving himself wide open for ridicule and judgment. Harry didn’t want that between him and Draco. He removed his fingers and cradled his wet hand to his chest.
They stood there together for a while; Harry’s face tucked down against Draco’s neck. Harry inhaled the scent of security until his breathing slowed. Draco didn’t speak, instead he simply held Harry until he was ready to re-emerge.
, anyway. It’ll just be me, then.”
. But maybe there was something… a way to use this opportunity. As far as most people were concerned, Harry had resigned as Minister for personal reasons; that was the official Ministry statement. His abrupt resignation had caused disparagement from the press and therefore resulting disapproval from some of the public, but as far as anyone was concerned, Harry was still on good terms with the Ministry of Magic. The Wizengamot had been careful not to publicly cut amicable ties with Harry Potter; it was too valuable to them.
They rocked together for a while, indulging in the pressure of groin against groin, mouth against mouth, building mutual appreciation. A more usual scenario would be Draco between Harry’s spread legs, but Draco hadn’t amended his straddling position, instead using it as leverage to push down. It was nice, this unhurried filling of their cocks.
had seen and felt what the box could do.
when his cock was being treated to attention, but he somehow found the words between his panting to ask, “Have you… done this… before?” He wasn’t especially keen to hear the answer, but curiosity was a powerful driving force.
Satisfied that no harm had occurred, Harry waved his hand at the box. Immediately, the blue light vanished.
And Malfoy was soon willing to explain his intentions. “You’re going to fuck yourself on my cock.”
Harry resisted the urge to inform Hermione that Draco had described her as ‘entertaining’.
Draco lay still, determinedly holding his body with rigid restraint as he spoke. “That was… enthusiastic, Potter,” he assessed, his mind reeling as he considered the various past kissing tutors who could’ve taught Potter how to
“Yes,” Harry nodded. “The details of the applications came through my office three times during the last month or so that I was still Minister. I was a bit surprised by Ron’s. He used to say that he didn’t want to be in charge.”
Patronisation was a reliable way to kick Harry’s tongue into gear. “I know it was
Harry locked his lower body in place, savoured the firm but insufficient grip on his penis and awaited instructions. It felt lovely to have his arms around Draco’s shoulders. His fingers caressed the layer of soft woollen jumper covering the strength which Harry knew was beneath. He was secure here. Safe.
Harry worshipped the derision in that voice. He could do anything if Malfoy was here. Draco took such wonderful
Draco responded with a single hissed word: “
“You mentioned something before about
“After all
It was hopeless, really. Potter was ruining him. Perhaps that was Potter’s master plan. But there was no use analysing every detail when he was tired, so Draco listened to the slow breaths behind him and aimed for sleep.
“I will not have you squandering or mishandling any of your possessions. Would you care for a demonstration of the most efficient method of folding such garments to maintain both longevity and efficiency of organisation within the available storage space?” Draco asked, voice seeping with a calculated degree of pretentiousness as his hand glided on shiny, wet lube.
. If Harry had been a better judge of character, hadn’t been blinded, at first by
“I am
fun,” Potter said. For a second, Draco thought Potter was referring to their sexual activities until he added, “Snape’s even more of a git when he’s teaching on a one-to-one basis. But… I’d be long dead if it wasn’t for him. Even after the war.”
Ron spoke again. “You have a lot of sway with the public. And the Ministry, I’d imagine. Hermione said I shouldn’t ask, but… anyway,” Ron mumbled.
“Please get an umbrella for Draco too,” Harry added as she stood, merely to see the affronted look on Draco’s face when he saw his drink.

If Harry said no, even at this point, Draco would accept it. Harry knew that because he
Granger and Weasley’s reactions appeared to have gradually moved past concern into a comfortable tolerance of Potter’s lengthy silences, satisfied by Potter’s automatic smiles and reassurances that he was fine.
“Just… to talk to you, I suppose,” mumbled Potter, evidently forgetting Draco’s suggestion of studying.
“Thank you.” Harry was getting thanked a lot today. It was fairly odd. But when Draco’s eyes narrowed with calculated mischief, it indicated that things might not be
am I obviously a bottom, if no-one else thinks so?”
“When have you ever been anything else? I made sure she was safe,” Harry added, not wanting Draco to think he’d been careless.
“Roll over,” Draco whispered.
Harry’s voice had been so faint by the end that Draco was bending over him, straining to listen.
Draco. The man who
“Aww… come on, Harry.”
asked his brother to come here for feedback.
Harry decided not to prod at the subject of proof until he felt steadier.
“I don’t know where that is,” he confessed. “I could’ve done things better.”
“I’m sure it would,” agreed Draco. “But I personally feel that the most thorough method to polish a wand is to insert it into a tight anus.”
. Buoyed by the new discovery of
Draco’s silence continued as he surveyed the black fabric, and it occurred to Harry what might be causing the hesitance.
Two heads shook at Harry. But no matter,
Several other heads had now also turned towards them, but Draco ignored the witnesses.

“I thought Hermione might have the right sort of connections to help him, but no,” said Ron.
“Yes, you do. You’ll come up with an interesting suggestion, I’m sure.”
In his own time, Malfoy spoke. “Do you think that whores deserve preparation and lubricant?”
“Who will decide whether or not you’re fucked tonight?”
I’ve ever
Confused by Potter’s sudden change of demeanour, Draco let his gaze follow the line of Potter’s stare. The design was plainly visible through the transparent fabric of Draco’s sodden shirt.
“Come down here and tell us about it!” George encouraged. “You owe me that much for the freebie!”
Instead of finishing his sentence, Draco lifted his head, lowered his gaze, and stared blatantly at Harry’s erection, appearing to consider something. Although Harry’s worry increased in the interim, his cock rose further under Draco’s visual scrutiny.

It occurred to Harry that the box
Luna blinked her big eyes at the tendril of magic.
Harry smiled; he could see more of Draco’s confidence returning with every minute. But he wouldn’t pretend that this issue was past. Wouldn’t let Draco bury it the same way which Harry was so adept at doing.
“After you graduate, you can do anything you want to.”
But Potter didn’t laugh. He sighed, a familiar sound which Draco was beginning to associate with him. “Yes, they do. I just asked them not to.”
“You can be free
“Oh,” Potter said after a long, tense minute. “I forgot.”
“Does having other people around bother you?”
“It’s okay, baby. I’ve got you.”
“I’m… not sure that’d be a great idea,” Harry offered, wanting to stop this endeavour before it gained any popularity. But he was struggling to think of a reason to refuse which wouldn’t sound childishly stubborn. Maybe Harry
“Yeah, they were,” Harry agreed. “Please tell me this rug is not something you plan to bring home.”

Tentatively, Harry sent an invisible nudge of magic out to clear a section of floor. Malfoy obligingly knelt in the space, close enough to lay a hand on Harry’s right shoulder.

Potter didn’t seem to
Malfoy tutted. “Potter, if you destroy all the pointless crap in my family home, that will only heighten my enjoyment of

Draco sniffed. “No… but I feel like I
“You think so?” Potter’s comeback hadn’t sounded nearly as confident or dismissive as he’d probably intended.
“Ermm… I…”
The thought of that incident becoming public knowledge made Harry feel sick.
Malfoy took a visibly deep breath. “Well, I’m worried now that what we… do together might be due to some sort of… adverse reaction to your past.”
“True,” Harry laughed. “But I'll give it a go.”
this.” Harry nodded. “Good. You’re far too used to thinking that you need to deal with all the bad stuff yourself. Now, close your eyes again.”
“No owl treats. Bugger off,” he snapped at the owl, sweeping out his arm in an attempt to dislodge it from his pillow.
As per Ministry requirements, Draco would then be subjected to questions regarding his day’s plans or accomplishments. The same routine was followed at each mealtime, a pointless exercise, since Potter could clearly witness Draco’s activities for himself during the course of the endless days. Potter insisted on sitting

“Yes, Harry… you really should be working on Snape’s essay.” Then, in an unforeseen, hideous turn of events, Granger suggested, “Maybe Malfoy could help you.”

Ahh… there was a real laugh; that was a much better sound. “Perhaps not.”
Relieved at this apparent return to normality, Harry chuckled as he followed Malfoy through the study door into the corridor but after only a few paces, Malfoy came to a dead stop in front of him.
“I should’ve stopped him from hurting you, Ron… and other people. I could’ve -”
“I know,” agreed Harry.
It would’ve helped Harry’s resolve if the man didn’t look like a wounded puppy. Bloody hell, they hadn’t been dating for long. And Harry’s skin was beginning to crawl being near him again. Harry remembered echoing fragments from the previous night, words that had been replaying in his mind ever since.
Harry wasn’t sure that he’d describe his progress as
Gaping, Harry took a step in reverse, raising himself back to the stair which he had just descended. Further retreat was stopped by Draco’s body behind him. The soft touch of a hand to the small of his back helped to calm Harry’s thudding heartbeat.
Satisfied that he had done a good job, Draco held Potter close to his chest as he continued to work his erection roughly into the groove until the pressure and pleasure became too great to withhold. As he groaned out his orgasm, Draco unfortunately didn’t realise how far across the bed both of them had wandered until his final thrust shoved them flush together and over the edge.
mentioned it,” Harry interrupted. “So, here we are.”
. No-one else could've done this. And I don't think you
Draco set his shoulders and appeared more sombre before he replied, “Yes. But not… now. Later.”
“I’m not moping.” Still that vacant stare. Draco wondered if Potter actually saw something fascinating in that middle distance.
The sparse response wasn’t much comfort. As he regarded Potter’s impassive expression, Draco could see all he’d come to hope for slipping away before he’d even had the chance to properly grasp it.
“It requires a thorough and specialist… polishing to preserve and celebrate its rigidity.” The bump shifted in a hidden but evident action. “What would be your… professional position on the preferred methods of achieving that aim?”
with shit like this.”
you’re so powerful. If you relinquish control to someone, you’d be giving that person a gift. Bloody idiots, if they don’t see that.”
Mind reeling with the utter unfairness of the situation, Harry waited. He wanted to be able to contribute something helpful, but his composure felt about ready to crack in two. And Malfoy had lapsed into one of his lengthy silences that often meant that he was either about to berate Harry spectacularly for his idiocy or come up with an atrocious suggestion.
“Then you may do that for me. And whenever I permit you to do something, I expect to hear appropriate gratitude. Do you understand?”
“Try as I might, I can’t seem to
“Sort of,” Harry decided. “A bit. I don’t know.”
“Oh.” A pause, then Potter breathed against Draco’s neck, “Snape taught it to me. And a couple of wandless healing charms. They’re useful in a sticky situation. But you probably know that.”
angry with, Harry?”
It quickly became a pitiful performance of stamina from Harry. Lost in the rhythm, Harry dimly realised that not only was he not attempting to withhold his orgasm, for once no restraint had been demanded of him. Malfoy's hands were in Harry’s hair, not gripping, but almost caressing the strands as he kissed Harry and they both rocked towards completion.
“I might’ve… lost the first two,” mumbled Harry and he was reassured by Draco’s laugh. “I was trying to think of a way to refuse,” he admitted. “Technically, I had the authority, but I would’ve needed a plausible reason. Approving and appointing someone new to that position takes months to sort through even a handful of applicants and endlessly pointless paperwork, so I figured I’d think of something.” Draco's earlier phrasing prompted a question from Harry. “Did you say they
Draco tugged him slightly, effectively performing the shuffle which Harry had been tempted to do. Harry moaned as their erections finally rubbed together. When Draco’s hands resumed their previous positions at Harry’s back and neck, and their chests were flush again, Harry ensured his grip was secure around Draco, and Draco began the game.
. “Come
“You might’ve mentioned something about my arse.” Looking over his shoulder, Draco caught sight of a sheepish blush colouring Potter’s cheeks. It was frustratingly endearing.
Okay. Stage one. Reviewing his own eager cock and Draco’s unflagging erection, Harry was going to consider that stage taken care of. Both of them were definitely aroused.
dry. The tips of Harry’s fingers felt distinctly slippery with water where he’d touched it, but there was no sign of moisture on his skin.
. How strange it felt to be offered something so huge. Draco hoped Potter’s faith in him wasn’t misguided.
“I don’t
“So, you didn’t blow the place up then? Very good, Potter.”
“And how do you feel that I’d be best to achieve that?”

Harry let out a laugh that was more like a huffing bark, and Malfoy's concerned frown deepened.
Draco had honestly never compared his Mark with others. A slightly hysterical corner of his mind suggested that perhaps the actions which had been necessary to force the mark upon him had affected the strength of the magic.
Lucius began to rant and rave above him, the predicament no doubt sinking in. Not paying much attention, Harry walked closer and took the time to admire the piece of furniture directly below the hanging portrait.
Ron looked nervous now. Molly looked like she was struggling not to laugh.
Eventually, Draco asked, “Really?”

. He couldn’t take much more of this.
Harry considered that, but the idea of a distracting project still seemed appealing.
He turned back to Draco, enjoying one more kiss. Maybe they could delay long enough for a teeny bit of tongue. Perhaps more…
“That was fun,” Draco cheerfully announced as he released Harry's wrists.
“Neither do you, but that doesn’t seem to stop you, dear,” Molly commented with a smile.
interested. In perhaps more than friendship or expulsion. Curious, Draco decided that an experiment might be of benefit.
Harry couldn’t contain the volume of his moan as Malfoy’s cock dragged across his prostate.
“You told me to fix it,” Harry repeated.

Harry gasped in disbelief. Absolute

It took much destruction of Draco’s pride to admit, “Yes.”
fault, not Ron’s.
Harry extracted his tongue from Draco’s mouth, turned his head towards the voice and gaped at Ron standing in the open pantry doorway. He couldn’t decide whether to be insulted by the implication that pantry-snogging was a normal occurrence for Harry or astonished that Ron had cracked a joke as if nothing had changed between them.
