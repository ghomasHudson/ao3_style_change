When the bell finally rang Harry took his time putting his things into his bag and did not change his pace when he could feel both Ron and Hermione glaring at him.
Even after a brief meeting with McGonagall after breakfast and a trip down to Hagrid's hut with Ron during their History of Magic free period, Harry was feeling miserable.
Draco huffed before glancing at Harry's watch. He must have decided enough time had passed as he grabbed the beeswax from the desk as well as a sharp knife and began dicing it roughly. "So what is the problem then? Make sure you aren't stirring the potion when I put this in, there might be splash back. I doubt you want to experience whatever the disastrous effects that Slughorn warned against."
Harry was used to seeing Draco in all black but there was something about the outfit that made him look especially beautiful. Their robes did in fact match except that they were the inverse colours to each other. While Harry's shirt and tie were stark white, Draco's were pitch black. Harry could already imagine how Draco would look in his black ensemble with the white and gold jacket that reached his ankles.
"I hope you find the Castle as fascinating as most of the young people who have passed through here," McGonagall tells him, extracting her hand. "Don't be late, Potter." She tells me again with an estern look.
"It's okay, it was just a bad dream. You're safe,” I whisper in his ear, as I press him against my chest and then loosen my grip a bit. "I am always going to protect you, no matter what."
"But, Draco hasn't seen her," I say, feeling disappointed. As an orphan, I know how difficult it is to lose things that belonged to your parents, especially memories.
“You are better,” Ron says to me. “But you have someone to look after,” he pats me in the shoulder. “Just as much as Parkinson have to look after someone else.”
“I am glad you are here,” I say, pulling him to my chest again. “But, please, don’t do anything else that can endanger your wellbeing, Draco, please,” I beg him. “I beg you. I can’t live without you, not when I am used to you and our little family.”
"Why?" Ginny asks me, arranging things on the table. "Should I stop treating Harry the way I always treat him just because the moon elf has self-esteem issues?"
And Zephora Zambroni didn't even need a wand to knock out a couple of people in the room. Her words alone were enough. She can do wandless without sweating.
"Mr. Potter-Malfoy to you," he says to me in a relaxed tone. And this time, he gets up more carefully. "Why did McGonagall gave him detention?" I sigh deeply. "Harry," he scowls at me.
"We'll be ready, Cissy," I whisper like a promise. As my eyes rise to the sky and the sun begins to erase the vestiges of the moon with each passing minute. "And then, when all this is over, I will be with you again, to live the life we didn't get the chance to live in order to keep our child alive."
“Mate,” he says softly. The barrier destroying itself, making prism shattered-parts adorn the whites of the land. Until the dissolve like sugar in the rain. “Mate. Harry.”
“It isn’t,” I say to him. “But he is a half-blood and he was raised in the non-magical side of the UK world.”
“Don’t worry about it, Draco,” she says and I can see a smile adorning her lips. “I will talk with your superior about everything, and I am pretty sure she will be happy to know you are actually out of hospital,” she pauses. “Do you need me to take something to her?” she asks, her brown eyes searching Draco’s body.
"I'm paying attention to you," Dray tells him in the most innocent way in the world, because it's a gesture Muggles use to get other people's attention when they're not paying attention. "I promise."
"Uh," Harry swallows hard and his gaze falls on Dray, who has discreetly stepped away from Molly. "It's not what you think," Harry says quickly, taking Ginny off of him, but gently, and looking at Dray. Dray's head tilts to the side and he looks at Ginny and Harry carefully.
His head nods gently against my neck and I delight in knowing that Dray trusts me enough to accept me as a wizard and even let me take him to a place that is totally unknown to him. Using magic.
"Don't worry Miss Hermione Granger," Zephora's voice brings me back from whatever Regulus Black has put me on. "You will have it as soon as you and young Weasley have taken an oath with me."
I force myself not to think about what happened last night and focus on Harry. Harry is behind me at my left hand and his magic is still in the air, but calmer now. Madame Pomfrey is in front of me, a little more to my right, perhaps, trying to put distance between her and Harry.
“Don’t worry miss Unspeakable,” she says softly. “At least, in that way, his is not going to suffer once wonder boy here has everything under control.”
However, I see him move towards the dining room with two plates of toast and jelly in hand, while three others float behind him. For a moment, I am enraptured looking at my husband's body and ...
My students look at each other and nod slightly. This is where the doctors are made. When there is ethics and morals, which helps a doctor to make the best medical decisions. Or uncover their patientes lies.
What is this thing with mothers and grandchildren? Pansy told me a few days her mother is expecting her own gran-children soon. But, I am pretty sure Pansy is something from the other world. She is so special, and no one is up to her standards. She says I am, but that's stupid. She just says it because we were raised together. Obviously, I am the best little brother she has, since she has none from blood.
And I lift my face to see a man place a chair in the middle of the stage and Dray sitting on it. The camera focuses on the gray-eye man, his eyes are illuminated by the large lamps and I can see how his body slowly begins to relax. The gestures on his face reflect a melancholy that I never thought possible in someone so full of life.
So, I hope you are all safe and sound at home, because I am. I went to the shop yesterday and I was happy about that. If your are feeling bad or sad or claustrophobic talk with someone.
Dray nods softly, his movement diplomatic but relaxed allowing me to let my guard down slightly. Although I'm not entirely sure where we are, the reality is that the magic of this place doesn't feel hostile. And so, I don't need the compulsion to ready myself to strike.
"Just a little," I tell them. "It is normal. Daddy is healing, but healing takes time and effort, and sometimes it will hurt a lot. Sometimes it won't hurt at all, until it's completely healed." The children look at me and nod. "Do you have everything ready?"
"And what is the paper in your hand, love?" Draco asks curiously, again, as he hands him a frog-shaped cup of tea.
"Teddy, no," I tell the little wizard in a playful whisper, as I hug him and pull him away from the lady's hand. "I am sorry," I tell her and she just smiles at me.
"I will, Zephora," he says, his eyes looking down at the floor. "You don't know how much I regret doing it that way, hurting him until it scared."
“Are we all sure of what we have to do?" I ask to each of those present, especially because Harry and Ron are capable to go do this task without knowing what they really need to do.
My son's little hands are holding on to my sweatshirt like a life preserver and I feel bad. I want my children to have everything Draco and I ever had and more. Once I let go, my gaze is focused on Draco's and I can immediately feel it in our link. Draco has something in mind.
“About you being in love with Malfoy?” he asks me and I nod fast. “Because, Harry,” he mumbles. “There’s something about how people smell when they are utterly happy,” he says to me, separating us. “And whenever we are out in pup nights, the few I had the pleasure to ever join, there’s this sweet smell coming out of you,” he says to me and I can feel myself growing hot. “And the few times drunk Draco Malfoy has dance with you, it goes sweeter and sweeter,” I look Bill in the eye and I know he is saying the truth. “He is good for you, little brother,” Bill says to me. His eyes no longer shinning with unshed tears.
Out of the corner of my eye I can see Arthur approaching us, as the other Weasleys move silently in the room, each with their eyes on the person who is speaking with his hands. I see Molly resting her head on Arthur's shoulder, as he wraps his arms around her.
"It sure is some Muggle invention I don't know about," Arthur says, his eyes twinkling. "Do you think he will show it to me later?"
"To bury a pureblood, there is always someone who has to remove the body, otherwise the body moves to other place, where it decomposes on its own in a matter of years, not days." Ron says.
“Even if he is unconscious, his brain is processing information,” the healer says, while mapping something with his finger. “He is quite impressive,” awe sipping in his voice. “Really impressive,” a little smile is painted in his lips.
There I am, at Eylopes Emporium, looking fondly at Dray, while he petted a venomous snake. His hand is moving in the photo, his lips saying something to the snake, while I try to keep him safe.
And those who are still outside the theater greet him, as we head towards the nearest train station.
However, I can't finish describing the situation because a couple of knocks on the door makes everyone's attention go to that place. The door opens and a short, plump girl enters the room. Her hair is a chaos of dark curls and her cheeks are rosy.
And then, the most heart wrenching sound tearing Draco’s throat, a wail of despair, deep sadness… The cry of a wounded soul. Magic leaving his body in an attempt to hurt and maim, crashing against the vases and the windows of the room.
"Dray," Molly calls him. "Are you alright? I'm so sorry for Ginny's jokes." Molly says quickly, lokking between Harry and his companion.
I start to make my way to the bathroom door in my room and I take a quick shower, brush my teeth and put on clean clothes. I carefully walk out of the room, trying not to wake Dray, and I immediately feel like a rope is tugging at my heart.
“Draco,” I hear my mother’s voice calling me softly, but I don’t want to open my eyes. The warm sun feels inviting and I can feel myself drifting into unconsciousness, ready to take a nap. “Draco,” I hear her soft voice again, but this time it sounds away.
"This is the only file we have of Narcissa Black," one of the St. Mungo's nurses tells me. "It is a small file, because she was a pureblood, so there were very few occasions when she came to Mungo’s."
"You died?" he asks me in disbelief and pain clouding his gaze. “This is just an illusion? Are you not real?"
I just can thank God, because Albus Dumbledore was never my paternal role model. He was just someone that was there… Guiding me to be the savior the Wizarding World needed. Nothing more.
"The damage was not to her long-term memory," she tells me in a serious tone. “Before you came we gave Draco a brief neurological exam. What we are concerned about is not his long-term memory, but his short-term memory." She tells me in a serious tone and I pay attention to her. "Due to the nature of the accident, it is quite a handful that Draco did not break his neck in the accident, yet he has neurological damage, Harry," his blue eyes dance with concern. “Draco cannot withhold new information at this moment. We think it's temporary, but it won't get better if he don't go to therapy to help repair the damage his brain sustained. Potions can do a lot,  but he, already, has six of them listed,” she tells me and I sigh. "So I want Draco to do not just physical therapy, but therapy to help his brain recover."
I'm not a pureblood, nor I am the Harry raised by Muggle uncles. Because, I know the only reason Voldemort got an army of Death Eaters was for the simple fact that he knows how to explode one of their stronges and controversial points of morality: the blood status.
"First, Dray is one of the smartest people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting in my entire life," I tell them in a serious tone. "And second, he doesn't know my name because Dray is not a wizard, he is a Muggle."
"Harry?" Madam Pomfrey's voice makes me open my eyes and I immediately lean over to look at Harry. His fingers are massaging his temples and applying pressure to the point. "What happened?" Madame Pomfrey looks at me first and then at Harry.
“Because I am Harry Potter and he is Draco Malfoy. Most people don’t care about him being a spy in the past for the light side. A lot of them still belief he took the dark mark out of the deepest wishes of his heart to please his father and the man he supposedly shared believing with. I cannot risk him like that. He is in enough shit consulting for the DLME as a Potion Master, creating antidotes for the worst cases Aurors, Unspeakables and Hit Wizards has to deal with. Even going to lengths of losing sleep over helping people that will gladly spat at his face in the street. Even if he helped to win that bloody war of yours. So, forgive us for trying to protect each other from everyone that hate our guts out there.”
I don't even want to give her an answer. I see Sirius come through the door and wrap me in his huge arms and I feel like a little boy, crushed between his father and his older sister, and all I can do is hide my face in Sirius' chest and cry.
“Stop looking at me with those baby puppy dog eyes,” she says softly. “I know where is Potter.” She says roughtly.
I try to convince myself. One too many hallucinations in the past weeks? Days? Hours? Has taught me that, Bellatrix likes it when her… guests, screams their lungs out.
Nesha's cold hug makes me refrain from kissing Harry again and starting something neither of us has time to finish right now. Nesha's wet little tongue tickles my neck and I can't help but laugh as my cheeks heat up.
“If you keep hugging like this, I'm going to get jealous,” he let the comment slip and Dray blushed furiously. His cheeks stained a painful red.
Because thet baby sister is dead. That one is Narcissa, the Asset’s mother. The other is batshit crazy, the Asset’s Aunt. And the other, is batshit crazy too, but she is in our side, the other Harry’s side, and she is the Asset’s Aunt. What’s wrong with the Black family?
"Good morning, class," I say formally, my face serious. "I think you already met my assistant for the day." I stands next to Scorpius and he immediately smiles at me.
“Someone tampered with his magical core,” he says, moving his wand over the parchment. “It says so in here.”
"Last morning, when Blaise and I were at Rossé Cotage, one person said they could track down Narcissa Black if we had something personal about her," Ron tells me, his eyes still bright. "It's a kind of complex spell that only people who are almost fossil use," he says seriously. "Mione must know more about that. However, what is striking is that we did not see it before. I mean... Not her, nor her little vodoo shop.”
"Harry," he calls out to me softly and I walk over to him, placing a kiss on his forehead and walking beside him. "I'm sorry you had to left work in the middle of your shift," he tells me in a whisper.
Jaxley and Bella has never play well along. They are like stupid children with an affinity to kill everything and everyone in their paths, and that’s just what a good day looks like for those two.
"How do you do it?" Draco asks me and I feel my heart begin to beat strongly in my chest with the shock that I have taken. "Can you teach me?" I smile at the blonde.
"You're right," she tells me, putting her hand on the doorknob. “Harry, no matter how Draco looks to you now, I don't want you to make any face, nothing to suggest that he still doesn't look quite right. Okay?"
I watch him throw his head back as he laughs at something she tells him and my blood freezes in my veins. Dray says something to her and she quickly shakes her head, shiny black hair moving with that simple movement.
Even if I vow myself to never take advantage of his open invitations, I still feel blessed. I hold Harry a few more seconds, and then I am making myself let go of him, regaling him with a beam.
"Not because you have seen someone from the mafia sitting in a restaurant does not mean that it is the best time to arrest them," he tells me in a serious tone.
“A lot,” she says untangling the long roll. “This is an old parchment written in old german. And a linguist translated it for us,” she says, opening the roll. “This is Hades and his lovely queen, Persephone.” She says poting to the two well draw figures. “They loved each other, but they were separated for half…” Hermione trails off and I know this is my chance to speak my mind.
"Still teaching to little brats like me in his academy," Dray says, while a smile blush take over his cheeks.
"Enough games, honey," I bite hard where his neck meets his shoulders and I hear him groan. Draco tries to separate himself from me as the pace becomes faster and more punishing, his hand reaching for his cock. And without thinking, I take his wrists with my hands, and I carry them behind my husband's back. Trying to glue our bodies together again “No love, no hands. You're going to come just from this."
"I promise you to remember in the bad days the reasons why I decided to be by his side, and I promise to relive the good moments over and over again, until they turn into light during the dark moments," I say with a heartache inside my chest. “And I promise you that I will love him, as he loves all living beings that exist on this planet, even if those beings are over a meter tall and are the most lethal things in the world, I promise that I will love him as Dray loves. And although not every day I can love him one hundred percent, I swear that I will try and I will never let anyone take him away from my side. I will give him reasons every day to love... To love me.” I tell Narcissa and feel the tears welling up in my eyes. This is so overwhelming that it feels like a physical burden. “I promise you that I will fight my own darkness to keep us both in the light. But, I also assure you to keep Dray in the light, where he can be safe. I trust in his strength, and I am sure that if I ever lose myself in the dark, he will come find me and we will be together again, and we will continue forward, even if there are bad days."
The door opens and Hermione’s head peak from it. She looks at Draco and then, her eyes sets on me. Her face is set blankly and her hands are gripping the door so hard, her knuckles are turning white.
Old magic. Zephora Zambroni's magic is similar to the one that is always coatting the Room of Requirements. Breathing on its own somehow, warm and solid at the same time. But, I am pretty sure this woman is capable of killing without giving the act a second guess. But, then again, all the founders could do the same. All of us can chose to join Voldemort and kill and hurt and maim.
“Who the fuck warded Malfoy’s house?” I ask for third time, while trying to unthread the massive ward. It’s like being lost in a fucking hurricane of threads.
I pale as I remember my conversation with the headmaster a few days ago. The assurance in Dumbledore's words that Dray was not a little white dove.
I feel terrified, but once I understand that the voice is not really directed at Dray, I let peace invade me momentarily.
"Tata," Teddy tells me, pointing at the people marching to the stage and the second white hair I see passing is Dray. Dressed like a prince, with a gold medallion around his neck, he makes me feel extremely proud. "Tata," Teddy starts bouncing on my legs. "Tata!"
“But you are the best there is in the world, Draco,” I say, closing my eyes and trying to activate all the charms this penthouse holds. “And they knew that. Didn’t they?”
“He is good,” I hear Ginny telling me, still not in the grass, but in her broom. “Hufflepuff may have had a good chaser. He has really good balance for a newbie.”
"Gin," I call out to the girl. "Could you not be all over Harry while the boy is here?" I ask the redhead youngest female.
That’s odd. Because, just minutes before, he was taking in all the room. And suddenly, Draco is out of bed walking straight to the window and I see the last two days starting again in front of me.
“Dumbledore wasn’t at our side,” I whisper, feeling broken. “It was never his intention to keep the Black family alive.”
And after a long three minutes, I can finally see the hallway that will lead me to my own office. Without any patience I open the door to our office and see Hermione sitting in the small armchair that has the room Ron and I share in the ministry.
What a rubbish childhood. And these are the things that I know that the Wizarding World can not even start to guess. Who could paint Lucius Malfoy as an abussive Father and husband? Not all these stupid people, blind enought to turn their backs when you need them the most. Not the ones whose, actually, never tried to implemented red flags to extract an abussed child from his home. This stupid dorks are the Wizarding World. Thank Merlin they have Hermione and Draco to take them out of their missery.
Ron's face turns to pure curiosity and I grab my wand with one hand and cast a copy enchantment on the pages, which immediately double. I stand up and take off the robes of the aurors to feel more comfortable, a pair of black jeans and a T-shirt from the Ramones.
He leans down to kiss me and instead of sensations I am consumed by the force of feelings I know don’t belong to me but Harry. I am assaulted by sadness, loneliness, betrayal, guilt, and…
"Now while we're there, everyone should stay calm," and she looks at me, as if for some strange reason I'm going to break someone's neck. "And I am serious, Harry."
I don't know why, but it pains me to think of the thought of not being by Harry's side or losing him forever.
“Because the spleen is what helps the body create white blood cells, which are in charge of fighting against diseases and infections. He's a doctor and I know he work clinic time. The patients in clinic time are full of germs and we wizards are not immune to cold. So we hope to save as much of that organ as we can, Harry. If that doesn't happen, he will most likely have to give up his medical career and take extra steps at home to keep from getting sick. But, only if he lose his spleen.”
"Hi, I'm Dray," he says to the house elf in a quick tone once his hands carefully close on the old elf's arms. "Did I do something to bother you?"
"This is Dray," Harry tells them, as the white-haired boy looks at the Weasley twins. "And they are the twins, Gred and Forge," Harry says and I look at him from my place, trying not to laugh. "I mean, Fred and George," he directs his nervous laught to the opposite side of the boy.
Dray nods softly, his eyes turning a lighter shade. I'm sure this isn't the first time I've seen them change color in seconds. Or in spirits...
And I feel relieve wash over me, knowing that surely, he will be home waiting for me when this war is over.
Today she looks completely pretty, with brown hair tied up in a strange bun, her bangs gently falling onto her forehead, leaving her face practically free to admire.
“No,” I tell her seriously. “He is still sleeping and Smart-Healer comes here every morning and every night to ensure his safety,” I say to Hermione, while said Healer is passing the arch that connects the dinning room with the kitchen.
I cannot help but feel proud of my soulmate. It will take a few months training his magic so he can control it better, but we will be ok. He will be formidable and now, he has a way to defend himself.
"Uh," I look at Dray with wide eyes. "A what?" I ask him, not believing what my ears have just heard.
"I'm not interested in the house, whatever that is," I tell him in a serious tone. "It's just ... Have you ever seen someone as pale as me wear something as pale as yellow?" I say, gesturing wildly. "This is a fight against my fashion sense, which let me tell you Mr. Harry, it's amazing," I lift my chin and look down at him, but all I do is make Harry lose all semblance of sanity and start laughing.
"Draco is awake, Harry," I hear Hannah's voice through the fireplace and let happiness wash over me.
“Yes,” Parkinson answer. “The biggest one is connected to his potion lab,” and then her manicured finger falls over a spot.
"That doesn't mean it cannot be cool," the boy replies, lowering the huge suitcase he carries on his back. A black suitcase with cloth patches with names of bands I loved when I was younger, when Harry was a newborn.
Unless… He's actively trying to bring Dray to the Wizarding World. If Voldemort is searching for the kid, why give him the oportunity to see him in the middle of the Ministry? The only eplanation an auror can give for that is... Ambush.
I try to open my eyes just to see where I am, but my body feels too heavy, sleepy… weak. I try to grasp better on the reality, but everything is coming really slowly. I can feel the cold sipping through my bones, while my head starts to pound furiously, like a hammer trying to scramble my brains out of my skull.
"This, Harry," Hermione begins solemnly. “This is Narcissa Black's consciousness. Each of the objects that flow through this river have a memory of her life, while she was alive, and others belong to her memories of when she was dead. "
"Dray," the male voice causes Dray to turn in the direction of the sound. And I see how the man extends his hand to the blonde. "Excellent work today," he says, shaking the blond's hand. "Take care of these little hands, I doubt that there are others like them around here," says the man, shaking his hand one last time and releasing him.
"I can sleep and wake up next to you and stay with you for the rest of my life," I say softly, circling his back with my thumb. "Because I love you, Draco Potter-Malfoy. Because you are my sun on good days and my moon on the darkest nights. You are my universe, Draco, and without you, there would only be storm and darkness within me. I love you because you are exceptional and wonderful, because you do not speak of love, you only show love towards those you love. And to me, that's more than I could ever ask for.”  The feelings are knotted inside me and I feel that I am so full of love inside, that if I don't tell him, I'm going to explode. “I love you and if tonight you cannot love me, I will love for both of us. And if tomorrow you can't see the wonderful person that you are, then I will tell you every day, every morning and every night until you believe. And if you can't believe, then I will believe for both of us.”
"I can, my love," I say to him, drewing a deeper breath, brushing his cheek with the tip of my fingers. "I can understand you now," and he pushes his face against my hand.
I just swallow slowly, not wanting to make this hard for her, or stupidly cruel for the blond. Whatever Hermione is covering up, it couldn’t be good.
“You still have me,” I say in the same whisper he used a second ago. “You still have me, Draco. They didn’t leave you alone, they left you with me and Greengrass, and the ever-nosy Parkinson.” I erase the tears track in his face. “You still have us, and we still love you.”
"No, but it's important to Potter," Severus replies after a heartbeat. “We saw them in a hallway kissing Potter. This action, although completely disgusting, also made us see that the boy is important to the boy. If we caught this person, we could make Potter come straight for us."
"Converse are soft shoes, Ronald," he tells me, turning his eyes back to where Harry and Charlie are. "Harry," Mione calls him, as I watch dishes dance from one place to another and most of my brothers and their respective partners sit at the table. "Where did you disappear yesterday? You said you would come back and then, only your Patronus appeared outside the bar. ”
"You are so perfect, Dray," I whisper against his ear and he shudders, a needy moan reverberating around my fingers. "So beautiful and so perfect."
I am sure it is not poison. Poison are not meaning to taste this good and as Snape made me drink a few of my own potions, I really know how semi-poison taste likes. My potions were meant to make people ill at best, kill them when I was really out of it.
"Ah, you mean Draco Malfoy," she says dismissively and immediately put each hand on the shoulders of each of my children.
Was, Harry. You are as normal as any wizard. But, even if Dray have the spark inside him, he is just a muggle. Anxiety inmediately make a spot for itself in my chest.
"You have nothing to apologize for, Dray," I tell him, placing my index finger and thumb on his chin and lifting his face. "Nothing bad happened," I press our foreheads together and Dray let me be, and I feel calm again between us. "It is I who must apologize to you, for not informing you in advance about all this," I leave a kiss on his cheek. "You forgive me?"
“We need you at HQ as son as possible Harry,” his voice is full of something that reminds me of the fucking Live Chess Board back in Hogwarts. This is bad. “Kingsley is calling all the people he can gets his hands on. This is You-Know-Who-Related.”
"Oh," the magical head says to me and I immediately see the enchanted object start to wink at me. "I never thought you were the type of young man who likes to be with boys for one night," she says playfully. "You're already maturing, Harry. Surely you want to have a lot of action,” he tells me in a whisper. "And not just from the aurors." and wiggle her eyebrows.
"Sometimes they say Daddy is a murderer," he says, and his eyes fill with tears again. "Is that so? Did Daddy hurt someone? ”
“Nothing too much, dear nephew. Just a new…” she stops to think. “Improvements. So, you can stop doing the muggle stuff with the muggle apparatus that makes music. That’s so unbecoming of a powerful being like you. Because you are not even human. You are a freak that have magic, but can’t do magic really. You are a little freak that is so old, and yet… So slow.”
“Instead, you just backed up and left Severus to do all the hard work,” mother’s voice whisper against my ear. I look up to her with blurry eyes. I can feel the warm stream of water running down my cheeks. “I should have aborted you when I had the opportunity to do so,” she tells me, raising her wand. “You are an abomination, a humiliation to my family.”
"I'm sorry Minister, but I can't do anything to make your dream come true," he says in a serious tone. “As you know, last night some prisoners escaped from Azkaban. Not only do we have information that Yaxley left Azkaban, but others also managed to escape last night with him,” Ron tells him in a serious tone.
"I would rather lock them in a bunker and never let them out, than let someone as mad and full of hatred as Voldemort set their eyes on them," he whispers and I feel like this is not even the worst part. "I would rather commit suicide than force my children to do what my father forced me to do."
Which is very curious, because my magic has never done such a thing. And it doesn't feel like mine at all. The scent of Dray invades my senses. Moon is looking at me like if I am some kind of freak.
I smile up at her softly, she touches my hand with hers. Ron is nowhere to be seen, since he was out finding someone with the names of Lee Jordan, Katy Bell and Susan Bones.
"I just need to check that you are real," he says and pulls away from me, then stands up, "Don't be a dream, please," and his lips rest on mine. And this is more intense than last night, much more intense than last night. More fiery. Innermost.
This chapter have an almost explicit scene, but not so much because... Well, I am not like that. But, well yeah. I dunno if it's like all the other stuff I had published before, sweet and all that, but you will let me know.
"Yes, Papa," James's amused voice, as he sticks his little fingers into my dough, brings me back to reality.
Her body is mangled and bloodied but she is still alive. I know her because she is the sister of Theodore Nott, my own nemesis and the only child to ever took the dark mark. The same kid that was murdered by Voldemort himself so his family can be absolved of whatever shit was happening at the moment.
My heart swells with joy. However, the sound of feet on the floor makes me back away from my husband. My hand on Draco's, our fingers intertwined.
I hear him laugh and it's the most wonderful sound I've ever heard. He extends his bare hand to me and I immediately take it in mine and let out a whisper full of horror.
I close my eyes and chant inside my head an old ritual to bond Draco and Nesha to some extent. My magic will be just a catalyst and this will be temporary. Maybe two or three days, then the magic will be gone.
What I am greeted with, however, is a total change in my own half-empty apartment. While it is true that I made a promise to fix everything so that Dray would want to stay in our home, the truth is that it is not easy to ask for durable furniture and apparently it is not easy to raise it more than twenty stories to a penthouse in London.
"Is Master Draco upset with Kreacher then?" he asks me, his shoulders sagging and his eyes starting to mist.
"You're not ugly or hideous," I tell him, tracing my tongue over his earlobe and feeling him tremble in my arms. I press his hips toward me. "Feel what you do to me, Draco?" I whisper against his ear and a small moan escapes his lips. "You are so fucking beautiful." I see him close his eyes through the reflection of the mirror and I lift him in my arms.
The house is empty except for Minerva McGonagall and Neville Longbottom. I nod briefly in greeting, carefully tightening my hold on Dray.
And just before Dray can touch himself, I intercept his hand with mine and bring his hand up to my mouth and leave a kiss in the center.
Draco is still so young. The war didn’t change the naivete of his soul. It just made him mature enough to understand the difference between bad and wrong, and from wrong to horrendous. Being a spy for Dumbledore wasn’t easy on him, but he still keeps some of his childish treats… His childish innocence. Like stickmen on his PJ’s, smidges on card box or a glass of warm milk after bedtime.
He chuckles in my face, bending to let another kiss in my face. Until now, Harry hasn’t kiss me in the mouth like a normal couple… But, then again, we are the definition of a lot of things, but normal has never been part of that list.
It's hard to tell, especially when the Headmaster is involved in anything related to the war. I know from Professor McGonagall that there is a prophecy that specifically talks about Voldemort and me, and I also know that the same prophecy was lost. Around May of last year, the Unspeakables were furious because someone broke into the department of mysteries and took it away.
I retract my thumb from inside his body. A noise to complain against my actions is followed my Dray pushing back against my body.
"Papa loves me more!" he says in a serious tone and I pick him up off the floor to sit him on the kitchen island.
Yes, this same place was where a magical duel took place, in which Bellatrix Lestrange ripped a part of Sirius's neck and Martha Yowle was sucked into the veil. I can still hear the smirk as she cursed Sirius and watched him bleed on the dark cold black floor.
"That's the reason why Voldemort want him," says Ron. "It makes sense. He doesn't need a wand to make magic. He protected Harry from Voldemort in his dreams, maybe now it is in an unconcious way, but still he can. Voldemort use a kind of Legilimency to put lies in Harry's mind, and latelt it hasn't work because Dray is in Harry mind. If you have a device that can make Occlumency, then I am pretty sure Voldemort may wants it, because the Ministry is not stopping at Veritaserum when they can get their hands on Death Eaters," Ron's voice cute deep in the silence of the room. "Voldemort is craving the power this kid has inside him."
Tonks sighs once she knows Kingsley is too sentimentally compromised to speak about this. This is one of his friends’ children after all.
"What was an attack on your dignity, Darling?" Magdy asks me, the same woman who looked after me in the afternoons after I came home from school.
"Sorry," he apologies to the mediwitch that is walking by his said. She smiles at him, and ruffles his hair.
"He's going to be fine, Harry," she tells me. The smile on her lips touching her eyes. “He will need therapy, and most likely a wheelchair while completing therapy, but he will be alright. Also, I want him to see a mind healer. "
“Just came here to fetch you, since you forget to eat lunch, tea and now, you are maybe, trying to miss dinner, too” I point out, keeping myself in his line of view, just so he can read my lips properly.
"Thanks, Molly," I say leaning forward and wrapping my arms around her. Even when I don't have my original mother here, I'm immensely grateful for the simple fact that I ran into Molly Weasley of all people one autumn afternoon when I wasn't sure how I would get to this weird school: Hogwarts.
Nope, not Potter. Definitely Malfoy, the evil of the Malfoys is what shines in my son's eyes. However, I know that my son has a beautiful heart. Scorpius has a heart as beautiful as his other father's, because that's the way Harry is, completely beautiful.
"It is not very common in magical British society for children to see their grandparents a lot, but on special dates the whole family gets together and people talk," Blaise murmurs, as he pulls out his wand and casts a silencing spell around us. “The lastname Rosier was born in France. Like my family, they come from other countries where customs are different and, the French just like the Italians, have this thing about families. The Rosiers have the habit of making everyone in their family know each other. And not only that,” he sighs and feels like he's trying to figure out how to put into words everything his mind is thinking. “Evan Rosier had a very close friend, the heir to the Malfoy family, another very old French family, pure blood and with so much, much money and influences in every country in Mediterranean, Europe, Greece, Romania, Portugal, Spain and Italy. The next Malfoy family heir was promised to marry a daughter of the Black-Rosier hosehold who was born the same year as Lucius, the Malfoy's only heir.”
"It's true, Harry," Draco's voice fills the room and I twist my neck at the memory. Draco is sitting on a log in the middle of a clearing. His shoulders covered by my own jacket.
But Harry needs his sleep. I can deal with the nightmares, and the dread, and the feeling of being suffocating by cold hands on my own. Harry needs a good night of sleep desperately; I can see it in the dark circles under his eyes. His, usually, tanned skin, is pasty and pale. And it, combines with my own hallucinations, makes even the waking hours a complete hell.
“Maybe, Harry The Original knows one,” I say softly to her. Lovegood is not someone I should yell at. She is a fucking goddess, and I don’t want to piss someone as powerful as her.
"Papa's favorite dessert is Daddy!" Scorpius says proudly, as if he remembered a very difficult answer.
“The mood-blood,” the crazy woman with the ugly wand says. “The mood-blood that is friend with Harry Potter. We hate mood-bloods.”
Hannah Abbot stands in front of the microphone and I tuck the cello between my legs, letting the unique calm that Amazing Grace emits seep through every fiber of my body, as my hands move in time to create a flower bed for the night. melody that Hannah sings.
“Something my parents say to each other every day? Like when we are not looking? " Scorpius asks her with angel face.
“Because this is Master Draco favorite,” he says to her. Never wavering. “Where’s master Draco, Harry?”
The dark-skinned woman takes my hand and begins to drag me to where the stairs are. I see her move around the house with her eyes closed. Without stumbling even once. I feel like in a trance, where the only thing I can do is follow this stranger through my godfather's house.
And don’t take me wrong. I could be death, if it wasn’t for his need to ramble until boredom come. So, I am alive due to his lack of being able to shut his trap. Too much for a dark lord that loves to torture and kill.
“Master is really good to Winky,” she says and she hugs my leg and I caress her head. Her hair black and wavy.
"I cleaned it up." Zephora answers. “She was only found dead, with no trace of Dray, because to Death Eaters, Draco Black died that night in Wales. Do you know what happens if you throw an Aveda Kadabra at such a small human being? ” Zephora asks and I shake my head gently, because it is horrifying knowledge to have that information. "They become magic again. With no body to bury, magic consumes them because when a magical child is born… ”
I look again at what Harry is wearing today. A sweater that I had never seen before, but that does not fit two sizes bigger than him, pants that are not so tight, but are not torn or holed anywhere and...
“I am going to Lovegood,” I say softly, not caring that much. And then, I can feel my body compresing, my magic latching into something magic and then… I am in front of the weird house of Luna Lovegood.
I nod and then, I took her hand to apparate away, thinking about how bad is Dray’s mental health if his mind is surrounded by galaxy-like mist.
"Good, it's just a few scratches," he replies. "Scorp took one of the worst parts. But, Miss Hannah says that we are going to be able to play in a few days.”
“We have a spectator room, if you want to see your husband while he does therapy,” she tells me, as she stands up and starts looking for something on another desk. "It always does new patients good to know that they have the psychological support of a family member, especially those who arrive in similar states to the one your husband arrive in." Her sweet words make me smile. "Healer Abbot told me that it was a miracle your husband didn't break his neck." She tells me in a serious tone.
Dumbledore and Scamander are close friends. But… Scamander might now the Lestrange. Scamander knows them.
"Yes, and I send him to Hogwarts," I say slowly. "Hogwarts is the key. We need Dobby and we need to go to Hogwarts."
"I love you," I say in a whisper, and leave a kiss on his forehead before playing along with the twins.
Kingsley opens his mouth and his hand is extends toward the blond's face, who stays still, while the huge dark hand caresses his delicate cheek. At that moment, I see Kingsley's eyes fill with tears and one of them runs away.
“Well, I think our jobs are reversed now,” I say to him. “Because I always was told that I should be the one to destroy Horcruxes.”
"It's just..." and I breathe a sigh of relief when James begins to speak. "I like music," and his little hands are intertwined in a nervous gesture. “And they teach it at school, somedays. I am just affraid people will laugh of me if I play bad, really bad,” James' eyes fill with tears and I immediately hug my son with all my strength.
"If you wake up now, we can make love before we have to go to Molly's," I place a kiss on his silvery head and that puts him on alert.
"I want to go home," is the sad sob that escapes his lips. "I just want to go home." If he knew that our Lord feeds on the pain of others.
"That's all there is, Robards," Kingsley tells him, covered from head to toe in robes that scream: Minister for Magic. Don't mess up with me. "You are relegated to whatever Neekeal needs. This time is no longer yours," Kingsley stares at me after that. "How are you, Harry?"
The nurse conjures the wheelchair for him and extends Draco his wand to him. Draco lets a slight Scorugify fall on him and begins to move towards the exit.
These are my own eyes. They are shinning with something akin to the stars above the sky. They are warm, but the magic surrounding the owner of said orbs is cool, like the ocean in the middle of the winter.
“Is he awake yet,” Hermione ask me while I pull together a simple breakfast. Winky helping me to fry the bacon.
"If He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named wants that power it is because he knows something about the child that we ignore." Robards says and I immediately see him look out. "We don't know what his face is like, how old he appears to be, what his magic signature is or his essence, we just can assume what his age is." Robards finishes saying, while his eyes wander around the place. "But, not even that is granted."
"I will ask for an order for Saint Mungo's," I say in a serious tone, as I hurry to Robbards' office.
I lift my eyes from the memo Robards just sent regarding all the cases that were ours, mine and Ron's, to give us the list of new Aurors that are going to deal with those investigations. Immediately, I see a manila folder in the corner named after Narcissa Black and I immediately feel cold inside.
“He wasn’t,” he says softly. “Dumbledore was selfish enough to drive him to an early grave. He didn’t love Gellert enough. But I am not here to tell you about that. I am here to let you know what was the final destination for Bellatrix’s soul,” he says softly. His hands are moving in circles. An orb is formed and I can see a house. “Can you see them?” he asks me and I nod.
Harry looks at her, his green eyes spin with something I wouldn't know what to call, but the other emotion... I'm sure it's happiness. I am happy that my best friend has something similar to a family, even if I know that, despite the years, Harry is still not used to having one. He still believes that we are a loan, a family that he will have to give back someday and I am so proud that my mother put him in his place, that she reminds him that he is also part of this family, even if he is no longer in a relationship with Ginny.
I walk over to Teddy and put my hand on his head. Some crystals fall from his hair and I breathe a sigh of relief. My oldest son is fine.
"Love," Harry's voice snaps me out of my thoughts, snapping me back to reality. "Are you well?" he asks me, while he lifts my chin with his fingers, softly.
I gather all the Gryffindor courage and take Dray's hand in mine, as we head to the place where I know, Dray always parks his truck.
"Can anyone tell me what happens when there is an increase of oxytocin in the blood?" I ask the class, while I press a button on the remote and new words appear on the projector screen. However, none of my students raise their hands. "Mister Grayson," I call and the boy shakes his head. "Miss Levigne," and again there is a denial. Until finally a hand goes up. "Miss Lassonde," I say, waiting for the answer.
"Sure, Harry. I'll make Draco's favorite dessert, just in case they let you bring him home,” says Molly's voice.
“Not in our world. The humans and wizarding laws does not apply to you, since you are no one or either,” he says looking me in the eye. “What you did to Bellatrix can’t be done by lots. It is ancient magic that were locked down by other kinds of elves. The last Moon elf, like you, to walk down this earth did the same as you, with one Gellert Grindelwald.”
"Sweetheart," I call after taking off the boots that I wear every day at work. "Dray," I call out to him again, noticing the living room, where Draco spends most of the night, reading, until I get home from work.
"Dray, I'm going to take you to rest now," I say to the blond in a low tone, but he doesn't even seem to notice. He is out cold again.
"Harry," he says in a sensual tone, approaching me, running his hands behind the back of my neck. His hands playing with my hair. “You are still as beautiful as the day we had our first date. Even more beautiful than our wedding day,” he tells me and I see him lift his face. His mouth parted and ready to be kissed to death.
"Wow," Hermione tells us. "I see you discovered the entire Narcissa Black family tree." she say mockingly
I take his hand in mine and lead him to the main entrance, the one that adjoins the corridor that leads to the Great Hall.
“I know, my love. I do, trust me,” I say to him, trying to blink my tears away and swallow the painful lump in my throat. “I know and I am sorry for you know now how painful life can be. I swear to you, that never was my intention when I seeked you out. All I wanted was to bask in your easy, glowing happiness. And I am sorry, because I ruined that for you, Draco.”
“You can tell me everything you want, love.” I whisper back, leaning back to pull distance between us. Trying to keep our encounter PG-13.
Those were the worst month I had to survive, with Teddy complaining every other day about his mouth hurting. So I will cut my work short with the aurors to spend my evenings with him and Draco. My husband in the sofa, reading books about healing magic and muggle medicine, and me cuddling with Teddy while watching the best Disney stuff I can find back there. Teddy's little feet in Draco's lap and his face in mine, his eyes gleaming whenever Pumbaa and Timon entered the screen.
Ahahahaha. How funny. Severus loving the Dark Lord, being his lover and killing his pretty wife just to please a man who loves chaos and destruction. As much as Severus loved the destruction and downfall of Lilly Evans' life and her stupid husband, tempted by a Mudblood. The greatest stupidity that James Potter could do, one of those who we think could serve the Dark Lord, was nothing more than tempting by the lie that was Lilly Evans.
"And what is this young man's name, Harry?" my dad asks, taking his gaze off her muggle artifact. A Nook-Ia phoner or something. "Is he a magician?"
“I am sorry about saying it like that,” I mumble a quick but honest apologize. "But I really, really like you," I open my eyes and land on Dray's. Eyes blue like the summer sky stare at me with bright amusement.
“It is not scary. She is beautiful and feels very bad. Her wing snapped,” says Dray, touching said spot hurting and earning a glare from the little beast. "Forgive me, it was not my intention."
“I think there are bad news, Mister Potter,” he says, looking at Draco. He sighs again, a tire sounds this time. “I am pretty sure this is not what you wanted to listen when I first came in, and I am going to be honest, I wasn’t expecting this either,” he says, I look him in the eye.
I can't stand the confused face of my students and dropped the spell. I go down the steps and immediately all eyes are fixed on me.
"It is when a person has no husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend," I say calmly and Scorpius laughs.
“Hello, Miss Lovegood,” good manners being beaten down to me by Petunia Evans, the bitch. “May I come in?”
My hands are itching to touch him. I look into his eyes and I can feel his pinky finger interlocking with mine.
"The Burrow," says James loud and clear. The twins disappear and a few seconds later, Molly's Patronus returns.
"I took Dray to Hogwarts a few days ago," he tells them. "The sorting hat thought it was a good idea to put him in Hufflepuff," he tells them and smiles at me.
"We will have the team ready to intercept them next week," I reply, as I look him straight in the eye. "We are awaiting confirmation from the Unspeakeable and Hit Wizards."
Dray is red in the face with anger, his petit body trembling with pent up rage. His magic is all around his body, lashing out and maiming anyone who tries to get close to him.
I smell it. This is the same hoody use to lounge around the house when the mornings are cold. It smells like Harry, not like the detergent and fabric softener non-sense that Harry insists is good for your clothes and your skin.
The bulge between my arms moves and the tickling sensation returns. I open my eyes and look at Dray. His head rests on my chest and his hair tickles my neck.
“Yes, your father shopped off your ears and left you to bleed. Your life forced him to kill his wife. Did you know that, Dray? You forced two soulmates apart. You killed your mom and turned your father in a lonely, crazy person. Their lives are gone because of you and no one else but you.”
“It was pretty bad,” I say to her. “I never thought see someone I care for falling from a third floor will make me want to be a better Auror, a better wizard, a better…” and I shrug, because I don’t have the correct words to express what I want to say. “I am just glad Smart-Healer managed to put his brain together and in good shape again.”
I hear the shower turn on and I walk into the bedroom, where Dray has left his little winged snake in the middle of our bed. The little annoyance immediately crawls under the covers and rolls up, becoming one with the sheets.
"The faster the procedure can begin, the faster it will heal," Hannah puts his hand on my shoulder. “However, if you take him tomorrow, and even if you take him in a couple of weeks, I would tell you the same thing. Draco will be frustrated, and he's going to need someone to help him calm down. He will feel desolate and useless, you and I know Draco Malfoy and you know how he is. He will need someone to help him understand that he doesn't have to live fast or get better fast, he just need to get better at his own pace."
“Harry Potter,” the crazy voice is nothing like Dray’s. “You got yourself a beautiful boyfriend, I must say.”
“Why weren’t the wizards-like-police trying to catch him?” I am still trying to make heads and tails from this situation.
"I am taking the knife and the potion vial," I let her know, while lifting my hand to encase them in an extasis bubble. "I will take this to Saint Mungo's. With Merlin's help Malfoy will wake up and tell us to fuck off."
"If he have self-esteem issues, that's not my problem," Ginny replies, setting the table. “If you have a problem with something, you have to fix it. Harry doesn't like people who are weak. That's why he went out with me, because I proved to be stronger than the other girls in our house."
"Of course you're not horrible," I tell him in a whisper. "You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, Draco Potter-Malfoy."
But, how can I confess to the wizarding world, that unlike Harry, I did those sacrifices out of the selfishness of my heart? I didn’t passed information behind the Dark Lord’s back to help The Order of fucking Dumbledore.
I smile at nothing, as I watch the boy's blond hair dance with the wind that blows in the city. Dray looks over his shoulder at me and his eyes shine with such joy that my heart hurts. This is why I must defeat Voldemort, this is why I have discover what power I possess that he does not.
My magic has been weird lately. I can’t contact Harry through our bond. Isn’t he reaching for me anymore? Does he hate me now?
"That's... That's not true," I tell her, trying to stop my blood from rushing to my cheeks. "I did it to help Uncle Sev."
Just like that, he is gone with his eerie magic and Greyback, leaving two choices in my hands: help to evacaute the students at Hogwarts or search for my soulmate. I feel utterly lost and I let my tears fall when I know this is not just being lost, this is dispair... This is worst.
I listen to it with special attention and I feel that something does not fit. There is something that has been bothering me since the day Ron and I started putting together the puzzle of Narcissa Black's life, in an effort to find what Voldemort is looking for or why did she ran away.
“The use of magic can damage her,” the healer in charge yell over the yelping of the patient. “Or her brain,” she yells. “I need healer Mason.”
I nod gently, sitting in one of the few empty chairs on the little makeshift stage set up by the nurses and doctors in this wing. My eyes, resting on all the families that are trapped in this place to keep company with people they really love.
"Harry," he tells me, as he leads me somewhere, his elegant, long fingers curling around the straps of his case. He looks at me again and he is practically glowing. I can feel the spark of magic inside him growing, calling. "I know you, Harry." He says to me practically in a whisper, as he stops in front of a small cafeteria.
"Why does Voldemort want someone who may be alive, paraplegic, or dead?" I ask aloud, to nothing in particular.
I take a deep breath, putting one of my hands on Harry's shoulder. My godson immediately turns around and I see the smile that threatens to split his face in half. I give a smile to this boy who stole a part of my heart from the first time Lilly put it in my huge hands and told me not to fear. There was no way for me to hurt Harry.
I feel again the dull pain that is caused by feeling my hands empty, immediately my eyes fly towards his hands and I take off my gloves to give them to him.
I see him rub his eyes and fall into that state between sleep and awakening. His small hands, scrubbing the sleep out of his system and right away, I scurry in the shower, trying to keep it pure, even in my thoughts. I take the longest shower in my life, it's cold and one of the disadvantages of being in a place as cheap as this is that... There is no hot water.
"A gift from our friends in Warsaw," Neekeal tells us. "They tied the scene and managed to find a couple of cool things." Neekeal tells us. “For example, the blood in Narcissa Black's body was not just hers, but someone who shared more than 80% of his or her DNA with... Andromeda Tonks. This procedure costs magicians a lot of money. However, Kingsley gave his consent to do so. For those of you who don't know what it is, the Unspeakable Granger will tell you about genetics,” Neekeal tells us.
Carefully, I remove Dray's head and once I'm on my feet, help him stand up. He is up on shaky legs and I am pretty sure his brain is sleeping.
"I've never seen a snake with wings," he tells me. "Besides, I think it feels bad," he says without looking at me. His attention on the animal that is coiled on the palms of his hands. "It wing is broken." I nod gently.
However, I know that Dray will become a target. Voldemort may ignore this for a couple of days, but there is no way he will ignore it for long. Especially not with Lucius Malfoy among his ranks.
"Not this time," Robards says quickly. "If Voldemort wants him, alive or dead, it is because the Black family is hiding something and that child is the key to a door. The Dark Lords needs him to advance and perhaps, win this war." Robards sighs. "We have the consent of the Minister of Magic to carry out this operation."
"Harry's supposed boyfriend," Ron says with a smirk on his face. "Which I think doesn't exist because nobody knows his name or whom he is."
In the distance I can hear Dray's voice talking to a Victoire that is exercising her lungs in the most uncomfortable way that can exist for a baby.
"That's right, my partner is Muggle," I reply to Kingsley, wondering what he is trying to accomplish with this. "How do you know?"
You can follow me on Instagram @GreeneySilvery where I posted a picture about how Scorpius and James define Harry and Draco's love.
"But what if he believes all those lies one day?" he asks me with his bright eyes. Tears shining in his clouded eyes.
"Dray is breathing, I need the lady who came with Dumbledore," I finish the message and send my Patronus to wherever Dumbledore is.
"Nothing is ever what it seems, Wardwood," I tell him, as I stand up and start to make my way to the Unspeakables floor. "Not in your job nor in your real life."
"Are you sure you want to continue, Draco?" she asks in the sweetest tone that any healer has ever used.
"Daddy, you're not supposed to do magic in front of Muggles," he says, trying to hide a giggle. "What will Papa think if he discovers this?"
“I am sorry,” I can hear Hermione, but I know Draco can’t. He wanders over their beds, one at the side of the other. “I am really sorry, Draco.”
“If it is not the week-end, what I am doing at your house, Potter?” Draco’s posh voice yanks me out of me stare war against Healer Mason, and even if I lose to her I don’t care.
I trust Bill most of all, I trust Fleur. She is smart and a strategist. I can trust her to keep Bill out of troubles.
"I don't know if it has the mark," I say to Robards in a serious tone. "But, from how upset Dray was a couple of nights ago, I'm almost certain that Death Eaters chased them, or chased his father at some point, during Dray's childhood."
, nice. Now my evil twin is here, tied to the dark strand in my core. Because my magic is freaking fiery orange. A mutant orange.
"Good bye guys." Dray manages that sentense and he squeezy my hand in his. "I am never going to outlive that fucking day." He says, his eyes shinning with tenderness.
He smiles to me, a sun blind smile. I try to give him one back, but I am not sure I am doing it right. I know Hermione, Draco doesn’t know her. I know Slytherins, and Hermione is playing all Gryffindor on him.
I wake up with my head on Harry chest and slowly I start to pull away, trying not to wake him up desperately and wishing that we were most then just friends. I sit cross legged in the mattress and watching sleep. He has grown up into a fine man, with broad shoulder and square jaw and he is handsome as hell.
"It's a short ten-step walk, Draco," she tells him aloud. "If you give five or three, or whatever, if you don't finish today," she tells her seriously. "I swear, I will be proud."
Absently, I caress my husband's cheek with the back of my hand and his soft skin makes me sigh. It's like I'm twenty again and I'd be knowing Draco all over again, yet the presence of our children watching cartoons brings me to the most beautiful reality.
"Yes, my Lord," and like Naggini, I walk to the Dark Lord's throne and sit at her feet, in an exact copy of the pose of that detestable serpent.
"And just because all of you know his name now, it doesn't mean you will be able to say it in the future," continues Dumbledore. “Dray's original name will continue to have that seal. which will force you to never speak it. Until this war is ended.”
“He lost his ability to hear in the last attack, Head-Auror Robards,” Hermione pinch in and I am thankful for it. I cannot deal with him anymore.
Today is the day. Regulus will meet with Sirius again, because I cannot hold this any longer. Regulus has been impatient, specially knowing who the fuck I am and how much of a spotlight I am shading in his son.
"Come in," he says softly to me, and all I can do is take off my only remaining piece of clothing and get into the bathtub. The warm water feels good on my muscles. However, the temperature does nothing to make my erection decrease, but I feel a new wave of pleasure travel my back and nest in the center of my body.
“She is not going to approve his surgery if I didn’t tell her the truth. Parkinson is somewhere in Europe and Luna is in America, she is not due to comeback until next week. I just cannot let him die because our secret relationship, ‘Mione,” I say to my best friend. “I would love to for Draco to be here, by my side, to share this with the world, but if I wait too much, I will lose him, maybe forever,” I sit down in my own bed. Because, right now the severity of the situation is downing on me. “I just want for him to get better.”
"Make it stop," I say to Moody in a serious tone. My magic vibrating furiously around me. "You're hurting him!"
"I'm Dray," he tells him as if it were an everyday thing, a sincere smile painting his pink lips, as a slight blush settles on his cheeks.
I look at the plump, blue-eyed, brown-haired woman and smile at her. This is the second time that I am in this hospital, specifically waiting for this person. The only one who can look me in the eye without making me feel like a Rock Star or something similar.
"Yes, I am part of the cult of the lossers," I tell him joking, partially. "Come on then," I say, taking his hand in mine and feeling happy because it's me who has put a smile on his lips again.
“There's a feature coming out tomorrow because all Aurors are heroes,” Brandon Cooper tells me bored. Being Cooper one of the most creative aurors when it comes to hostage rescue tactics, I understand your boredom. "Or so Robards says."
"No," he leans down and kisses my forehead. “I'm calling you unique,” his eyes sparkle with sincerity. "There is no silver sun on our galaxy."
And the little lamia, the son of the vampires that can be exposed to the sun without dying, welcomes me. She is still in the clothes they required in her school. Red skirt and white shirt with a black vest.
"What happened, Mr. Weasley, is that Narcissa already gave you an answer to win this war?" I hear Kingsley's voice.
"But, I am pretty sure you actually became a spy to keep Mr. Potter alive," she says, her eyes glinting with mischief. “You can say whatever you want, you can even lie to yourself, Draco. But I know you better then any other human alive.”
"I love you too, Dray," I whisper, fixing my eyes on his. “With all that I am and with all that I have. I love you."
"There will be music, right?" Ron whispers, coming closer to us. Our bodies looking towards the entrance of the place. While the muggle girl put a green headband on his wrist.
It reminds me all the thing Harry has scaped from his mouth during our dates. Voldemort always trying to capture Harry, hurting him, degrading him with words… Wasn’t it enough with taking his parent away from him while he was just a baby? Then, the trap in sixth year to hurt him. Killing another boy in his haste to hurt my soulmate.
His hands grip the shirt I'm wearing more tightly and I press him closer to my chest. Draco is so cold that he could be mistaken for a corpse. With the weight of my body I make both of us fall back onto the mattress and I feel him settle into my arms. His face hidden in my chest, even if everything is dark.
"Not for this one. This is not a formal event, Miss Hermione," Dray tells her, as he tosses Ron's tie on the couch in my apartment. “It is not necessary for them to wear a tie or cloth pants. A black jean and a long-sleeved shirt of any color is sufficient. Plus, you guys will be in the VIP area,” he tells us, as he fixes my best friend's shirt collar. “It is not necessary for them to hang themselves with a tie. The only ones who need to dress like princes for this event are the musicians. It is something that our director always demands and provides."
Hope is shinning on his face and I feel a pang of sadness, because I know Hermione better. I know she is withholding information. Information that can make or brake Draco today.
“Don’t worry,” he says softly. “Sometimes people just forget a lot of things they had to overcome, but we are healer, we cannot overlook this kind of things. It can cause someone’s dead,” he says, writing something else. “I need to know a few things though, because this is not going to be easy for him,” he says, concern dancing in his features.
"Congratulations Jamie," Teddy fondly tousling his black hair. "You are no longer a baby," he says seriously.
“We were raised by a female-Hitler,” then they both salutes her and went out before their own mom can retaliate against them.
"But, he is so sweet. And Voldemort followers... They are evil." I tell him at the brink of tearing my hair with my hands.
Yeah, well... I am back. That reminds me that I will be busy for the next week, and maybe the update will be delayed a bit, but not for so much.
“I think is not hard to guess which side is Draco’s,” I say to her, while she keeps passing the garments. Long sleeves shirts and slacks, well pressed and of high quality.
“Draco is sustaining the Never-Ending Winter Curse,” she says sadly. “I actually cannot pronounce those Greek words and all their weird letters, but that is what means for us.”
I take the sheets and took him in, trying to cover his body with the heavy blanket. He has loss weight in this last tree days and I am unhappy about it.
"That's right, Mister Potter," he says softly. "Your husband will be well. Now we are just waiting for him to wake up on his own. Maybe it will takes a couple of months and a lot of love and a lot of understanding when his bone starts to heal and he will have to do physical therapy. However, he is alive, and that is what matters. ”
“It's okay, Nesha. He's fine,” I tell the occamy before he can attack me. “I survived, love. I am not an illusion or a ghost. My mom's love was what made me survive,” I tell Dray and lean in and touch his forehead. And in seconds, my arms are full of warm, soft body, as his arms close around my torso.
"It is not yet known for sure what oxytocin is or all the effects it causes in humans or in their bodies, however it is known that it is a hormone is produced in the hypothalamos and released by the pituitary. It is what cause natural childbirth and also, oxytocin is the hormone the that allows us to connect, in a way os speaking, with other living beings on the planet." he says with a single breath and I look at my students.
"See you tomorrow, Black," says another blond, setting a small suitcase on his back. "Excellent work," he tells her.
Obediently, Dray does what I've told him to do and when he swallows, I'm the one who can't suppress the guttural sound escaping my throat.
The brooms were handed over and the Gryffindor team, as well as the eighth years, made their way up to the castle in the amber light of sunset.
"I'm sure you didn't give him permission to tell anyone but Ron cracked and told me everything. About you and...
"I'll have to climb into your bed and get you," said Harry. Draco visibly paled and swallowed hard, Harry smirked at the thought of Malfoy being uneasy because of him. "Because we're talking this out."
Draco passed him a chocolate frog packet without looking at him, pulling his own out of his robes as well.
"Yeah, whatever," huffed Ron, not taking his eyes off Malfoy as he walked to his bed. "I don't want any funny business from you, alright?" Ron pointed at Draco accusingly.
It took no time at all for the two of them to reach the pitch, newly repaired and even improved after the war. They found a basket of spare quaffles toward the back of the wooden storage shed and took one out into the field.
Even Fred caught up with them and began discussing Jimmy and Ritchie's form as beaters from what he observed from the castle windows.
Harry said nothing but continued smiling as he tore open his own package and popped a chocolate egg in his mouth.
Hermione, Ginny, and Percy were already in the kitchen with Mrs Weasley when Harry and Ron arrived at the bottom of the stairs. Upon their appearance, Mrs Weasley ordered them to lay the table, pointing her wand toward a cupboard while asking Ginny to take the eggs off the flame.
"No, Potter," McGonagall shushed him in an exasperated tone. "Both of you are to remain in the castle for the remainder of the game as punishment."
This, however, was pushed to the back of his mind when he and Ron walked down the Quidditch pitch on Sunday afternoon to conduct the Gryffindor Quidditch trials.
Harry hung in the air a little longer while the rest of the Gryffindors descend onto the grass below. He caught Ron and Ginny slowly flying in his direction out of the corner of his eye. He forced a weak smile as he turned his Firebolt to face their Cleansweeps.
Harry lifted his hands in surrender. Draco turned to leave again but Harry lunged forward, grabbing his wrist.
"No matter, you can use one of ours," Charlie smiled cynically, catching a Cleansweep Seven out of the air and tossing it to Malfoy.
They found an empty compartment and Harry pushed both the suitcases he was holding up on the racks above.
"Potter, I have no choice but to present you with options and you have to choose one of them," McGonagall sighed, twirling her wand between her fingers. "You can either help me to help you in aiding your recovery. You are an adult now and I can not force you to do anything, I can only advise."
Students began to trickle from the hall and Harry had eaten enough breakfast to satisfy Hermione, so she proceeded to drag Ron from the table who was still stuffing blueberry muffins into his mouth. She was determined to get the two to make up before the end of the day, but Harry wasn't sure it would be that easy. He had expressed his apologies to the both of them yesterday, it was Ron who refused to look past his own stubborn nature and forgive him.
"Whatever," Harry sighed before pressing his lips back to Draco's, tired of talking and eager to go back to the temporary pain relief. Naturally, Draco had no complaints.
Malfoy simply grunted in acknowledgement of his presence when he dragged his bag and potions equipment over to the desk where Malfoy was originally sitting by himself.
There was no feeling of guilt, there was no fear that someone would walk in on them. Both wizards smiled against each other as Draco fell beside him, both their eyes fluttering open for a second to gaze at the other before Draco placed his hand on Harry's cheek and reconnected their lips.
Ron and Hermione all but nodded in acknowledgment of his announcement and Harry felt safe to sneak out of the common room.
Harry stared at him uncertainly for a while, he couldn't recognise the boy until he turned to him with a signature smile that twisted his gut.
Harry laughed to himself as he slipped into the other shower stall, hanging his robes and towel on the hook on the door before reaching over to turn the water on.
He stood perfectly still as the doors opened again, it was, of course, Malfoy who stepped out, his blonde hair combed neatly to the side and his pristine robes hanging on his frame as if they were newly ironed.
Malfoy sat down without a word to Harry, he reaches out for some of Harry's notes and reads through them.
"Maybe you should be more careful as to where you have these, uh, delicate conversations." Everyone's head turned behind Harry where a very smug Slytherin girl was standing. It was Park, she must have overheard the conversation during potions and told the whole school.
"Ever heard of the Broom shed?" Harry asked sarcastically. Malfoy rolled his eyes before strolling toward the shed.
Harry obliged, walking closer and sitting next to the Slytherin who continued to look straight ahead. Their sides were completely touching. Harry could feel Draco shiver a little bit and assumed it was because of the temperature. Harry snaked his left arm around Draco's back and his hand came to rest in the taller boy's jacket's pocket.
"If you tell another soul what I am about to tell you I will eviscerate you, Potter. But I have known that I was gay for a long time, sometime during the third year but it was the fifth year when I found myself becoming hopelessly and disastrously infatuated with you and by the last few months of the sixth year I had fallen so deep, Potter. I hated you so much for it, for making me feel this way about you. That kiss at breakfast, I can without a doubt call it the happiest memory of the last two and a half years. I did so many stupid things and most of them I could never expect you to forgive but if dare you think for one second that I don't have feelings for you, you are only fooling yourself."
It wasn't just the cranky school nurse that Harry was anxious about. This was to be the first conversation he was going to have with Malfoy after the war. The boys had always been on opposite sides of the fence, in their ideas and in where they sat in the Great Hall.
"Because I think we're friends now," said Harry, taking full advantage of this moment of vulnerability not often seen from Malfoy.
"Hello, Draco," he said softly. Draco didn't turn around but instead, he moved so that he was no longer sitting in the middle of the stump, but to one side as if silently inviting Harry to sit with him.
"Ronald Weasley, don't you think for a second you're skipping out on studying just because you're at home," said Hermione, prodding her boyfriend with her wand. "You too, Harry."
"All that's happened has put a lot of stress on you and you really don't need a relationship right now?" She said incredibly fast. Harry stopped and studied her face. It wasn't upset or angry, it was concerned.
Harry decided the best way to relax after the stressful, revision filled day was too take Ron down to the Quidditch pitch and have some 'bro time' as Hermione called it.
"This is my dorm too," he began slowly walking toward his bed next to Malfoy's. "And I need to tell you something."
"You can't?" Draco scoffed. "Harry Potter, I have been craving you since I was fifteen. What's worse is that I hated you at the same time and that just fuelled both emotions. You could never understand how I felt when you kissed me back that morning at breakfast. I literally felt like I was going to explode. I have done so many things to you that would warrant your hatred but here you are, my boyfriend, being my date to a ball and right now, holding me as we both try not to get too depressed."
"Wait," Hermione folded her arms. "I bet the two of you haven't even talked about it. Ugh, I hate boys!"
Harry shook his head before throwing the Quaffle toward the goal post, recalling it with the summoning charm when it passed through a hoop.
"Thank you for showing up Mr Potter," the Professor smiled at him as he took his seat next to Ron. "I'm sure Miss Granger will update you on what you've missed."
"Am I just an accessory to you?" Harry laughed, running his fingers through Draco's blonde hair who couldn't help but smile softly as he felt the Gryffindor's fingers against his scalp.
Harry looked to Malfoy to monitor his snarky remark, but none came. His only reaction was a scowl in George's direction.
Harry slept with the curtains drawn around his bed, painfully aware of the boy lying on his right. The entire cohort of the eighth year boys watched as Malfoy walked in almost as soon as Harry had seen who the bed had belonged to. No one said a word as the blonde haired traitor walked down the room to his bed.
"On the bright side Harry, we're going to Hogsmeade today, she can't curse all the food in a town can she?" Ron tries to cheer him up. "We can go to Honeydukes and the Three Broomsticks and-"
Hermione nodded and walked off, placing an arm on Ron's bicep as she did to make sure he wasn't going to encourage Harry to do anything dumb. He did, however, glance over his shoulder at him and mouth 'Good Luck' which Harry received with a grim smile.
If the whole room wasn't looking at them before, they certainly were now. Draco shot a dirty glare at the eighth-year cohort before storming upstairs to retreat to his bed perhaps, hiding away behind his curtains.
Draco smiled and shuffled himself toward Harry at the top of the bed. Draco sat cross-legged in front of Harry. Their knees touched through the sheets and Harry's heart doubled in pace.
The last four hours may have felt like they passed so quickly but the memory kept playing in his brain. Lying with Draco on his bed, talking about the stupid things that they did to anger or investigate the other during their previous school years, interrupted every so often by gentle kisses. Draco was not very impressed by Harry and Ron's polyjuice escapades during their second year.
"You're here!" Ron beamed as Harry made his way onto the Quidditch pitch for training. Yesterday morning was his meeting with McGonagall and that morning at breakfast both Ron and Hermione were watching him closely.
He sat up the back of the Gryffindor table with the seventh and eighth years, chatting about things other than their looming N.E.W.Ts for once. Hermione, Parvati, Ginny, and one of Ginny's blonde-haired friends were discussing Kingsley Shaklebolt's current campaign as Minister for magic while Harry, Ron, and Neville chatted animatedly about the Chudley Cannon's chances in the upcoming Quidditch season.
He picked up the white length of fabric which, from a glance at its cut, Harry assumed was to be his tie. He threw it around his neck, not bothered to tie it yet, when he heard the heavy click on the ensuite bathroom door being unlocked.
"Mr Malfoy, I am assigning you to be substitute seeker for the Slytherin team," McGonagall announced.
Malfoy flew to meet the ball and caught it, grunting with the force he took to his chest. "Is that the best you've got, Potter? Depulso!"
Malfoy soon decided that he would storm over to his designated stretcher bed and sit down angrily. Harry rolled his eyes and kicked his sneakers off before walking over Draco's bed and sitting down on his own that was flush against the wall.
"Well, you seem to be in a situation where you don't have any friends Malfoy," said Harry, getting frustrated now. "All your little friends have run off into hiding but you. Why is that huh? Why'd you come back! The only reason you and Mummy aren't in Azkaban with your Father right now is because I gave my testimony before the Wizengamot saying that you both were caught up in something you didn't ask for and defected in the end!" Harry whispered loudly, as to not get kicked out by Madame Pomfrey.
It was evident that Malfoy had slept but had been woken up perhaps as bluntly as Harry had as his blonde hair was messed up and all over the place, similar to Harry's normally. He was wearing a grey, long sleeve v-neck shirt with flannelette bottoms of the same colour that reached just above his ankles. Harry studied him while he refused to look away from the amber light.
"I'll take my own bed thanks," Ron shoved Harry's legs off the side of his bed, sitting down as Harry looked at him with mock betrayal in his eyes. "Malfoy can top and tail with Harry."
Harry tried to keep his head down. He tried not to think about it too much but that was quite hard when it was all anyone wanted to talk about. People were asking for dates to the ball, Harry had even gotten a few himself which he declined every time. If he was going to be forced to go, he would be there only when necessary.
"Well, I like you," Harry smiled. Draco finally turned his head to look at him, the beginnings of a smile cracking his indifferent shell.
"What are you talking about?" Harry stepped closer, their shoes almost touching but Draco refused to look at him, staring at the floor to the side.
And with that Ron and Harry were left alone again. Silence remained between them. It was clear to Harry that Ron was still annoyed that he had invited Draco and he could understand where he was coming from. Harry sat up next to him but he still did not initiate conversation.
"Well, what else was I supposed to do with it?" Harry shrugged. Harry extended it toward him but Draco unexpectedly took a step back.
The gargoyle grumbled something under its breath and let the door swing open. Harry wasted no time in heading up, not wanting the Gargoyle to start yelling at him next.
"A very mature response, Potter," she said, looking over her glasses as if she was still suspicious. "I think Miss Granger has finally rubbed off on you, it's only taken eight years."
"Something I would like to know is why you think this trauma has influenced your diet, or lack of I should say," said McGonagall. Harry sighed.
Harry slowly raised his left hand to Draco's shoulder and twisted his right hand around Draco's hand.
Harry smiled to himself and raced toward the wooden structure, confident that he would arrive before Malfoy in any world.
"You okay?" Draco noticed Harry's anxious fiddling. Harry nudged Draco off him, however not moving the arm that held him, so that he could look Draco in the eye.
Harry was not expecting an offer like that from Draco Malfoy. Harry was also not expecting his mind to take him back to the night in the dark where they had gotten so close. The image of Draco's lips seared across his mind and a hook dig into his stomach, seemingly pulling him toward the blonde haired boy.
"Potter," said Dennis with a grin as they reached the Fat Lady's portrait. Harry's jaw dropped when the frame swung forward to let the Gryffindors in.
Cheering erupted amongst the team and Ron got up on the bench, swinging his arm around his best friend's shoulders. "I want you to all keep in mind that this is Harry and I's last cup and if we don't win, we have decided upon a suicide pact because we refuse to leave losers!"
Draco had disappeared into the bathroom some time ago. Harry found himself glancing towards the locked door anxiously. It wasn't uncommon for him to retreat into the privacy of the ensuite while the rest of the dorm was changing. Harry often found himself wondering why this was but he never dared to pry.
On October 31st, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were studying in the library. It was littered with seventh and eighth years whilst all the other younger students were outside soaking up the last heat wave before winter.
The afternoon dissolved into the evening, the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall ate a triumphant dinner, most likely annoying the other houses as they laughed and shouted, revelling in their victory in the true spirit of their house.
Harry felt his cheeks heat up. His eyes darted to Draco briefly who was none the wiser as to what was about to happen.
Diagon Ally was a welcome change of pace for Harry. As he bought his seventh-year schoolbooks and supplies he had gotten rid of the previous year, he looked in all the windows of the shops and cast a mournful glance at the Firebolt in the window of Quality Quidditch Supplies as he remembered his own broom. He doesn't know where it ended up, broken most likely - no more than splinters and twigs. Maybe he'd be able to use Ron's broom to fly around the pitch sometimes. He doubted he will play Quidditch this year, getting out of bed each day to laze around the Burrow was hard enough, he wasn't sure how well he could handle Quidditch.
"Oh," was all Harry managed, his head spinning. Who else could he have told, what if Draco hated him for it?
When Harry had followed Ron up to the dorms after dinner that night, he had not seen Malfoy join them. He assumed it would be a lot less conspicuous for him to stay down by the fire while Harry would lie in his bed for a few hours before sneaking off to meet him there.
Harry led the way up the creaking stairs, looking back to Draco every so often, laughing to himself as the ex-rich kid looked around in surprise at the Burrow's dirty and raggedy interior. Harry only hoped that he was shocked at the number of rooms in the house rather than its' haphazard appearance.
Both Ron and Hermione looked up past Harry's bed and he followed their eye line to see Madame Pomfrey walking toward them.
They head out past Filch and onto the grounds to make their way over the bridge to Hogsmeade with their coasts and scarves wrapped tightly around them in the December air. The grey clouds that hung in the sky threatened snow but not a single crystal of ice had fallen this early in the month.
"I think this is the first time I've breathed since we went back to Hogwarts," Ron laughed as he threw himself on his bed, burying his face in the sheets. Harry sat down on his camp bed and inhaled deeply before exhaling. He closed his eyes. The noise in his head paused too. He felt calm and at peace. The thought crept up on him, surprising him. He was home.
"Harry!" Coote yelled as he passed the ball to him. Harry's reflexes did not respond and the ball hit him square in the face.
"Granger, Hermione. Outstanding in Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, Astronomy, Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, History of Magic, Muggle Studies, Potions and Transfiguration. It is a privilege to name her the Dux of this cohort."
"In your faces!" Ron screamed as Draco tossed the twenty-fifth goal for their team through the makeshift goal that George was defending.
"Oh, just one." She waved her wand and two cups on saucers gracefully glide into the room and settle in front of the two of them. The cups themselves were white with pale yellow roses decorating the sides which danced in an imaginary breeze across the ceramic surface.
"Potter, you have dirt on your cheek," Draco said, a disgusted look on his face. Harry rolled his eyes and rubbed it off before wandering over and pulling up a chair next to his boyfriend.
"Are you insane, Potter?" Draco scoffed. "If the Ministry gets wind of any wands previously or not under my name, they'll come breaking down the Weasley's door and haul my arse to a premature family reunion."
"Why I haven't received notes of any meeting between the two of you?" She asked. Neither of the boys spoke up, not daring to meet the headmistress' cold stare. "Mr Malfoy?"
"You're not defined by that thing," Harry grabbed Malfoy's arm right over the tattoo. Draco flinched, retracting his arm from Harry's grip. "I'm sorry, does it still hurt?"
Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forwards, gathering speed. As the reached the barrier, Regulus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged on to platform nine and three quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared.
Neither of them said anything. Harry avoided her gaze and looked out the large window. He realised that from the tower he could see the Quidditch pitch in the distance.
Silence fell over the crowd and everyone turned their attention up to the teacher's table where McGonagall was standing behind the podium, a lovely deep green dress on with a complementing witch's hat.
"She said she didn't want to treat you like a child," Hermione rested a hand on his forearm. "But you gave her no choice."
"Well now that you've said it, it seems obvious," Harry sighed, letting Hermione drag him back in the direction they came, toward platforms nine and ten.
"I was at home. Father was angry at me for abandoning him and the Dark Lord. He was yelling. Nothing new," he shrugged. Harry felt a pang of sympathy for Draco he had rarely felt in the past.
The Weasley's were the last to leave the hall, the goodbye to the son and brother who could never leave Hogwarts was somber and heartbreaking, even Harry rubbed at the tears in his eyes
"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married," whispered Lily ecstatically. "Teddy would really be a part of the family then!"
"I wasn't planning on missing out on seeing my favourite niece and nephew off to their first year at Hogwarts. Lily and Hugo frowned at her words which caused Ginny to laugh before correcting herself. "My favourite
"Mhmm," Harry nodded. That was a lie. His stomach was twisting and his hands were shaking underneath the desk.
Harry's body fell into autopilot mode as he retreated deeper and deeper into his mind. He opened his textbook and began taking notes while his old bad habits returned.
Harry sighed, rolling his eyes and decided to ignore Draco and instead focus on getting ready for bed.
Harry stepped out of the shower cubicle with just his grey pants and white shirt on, the rest of his outfit was thrown over his shoulder ungracefully, nothing an ironing charm couldn't fix.
"When I said that I wasn't expecting this," Hermione shrugged off her coat, hanging it on the back of Ron's desk chair.
Harry began his assent, the Firebolt catching up to the Nimbus 2001 soon enough. Park had her eyes fixed on the snitch which didn't seem to want to change directions anytime soon.
"And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts," Harry put in. "He likes a laugh, your brother."
Harry fell into the seat next to Draco. Harry was sure that something Madame Pomfrey gave him was messing with his head because Draco reached over and slowly threaded his fingers through his own. He looked down at the phenomenon that was resting on his thigh with wild eyes.
A basil green tangle of wool. Draco lifted it up hesitantly to reveal that it was a knitted sweater with a silver 'D' on the front.
"Petty?" Harry exclaimed, getting to his feet. "From the start, all he ever wanted to do is ruin me! And let's not forget how he let Death Eaters into the school and you know, was good buddies with our old pal Voldemort!"
"See, that was only a problem before. Now you're my boyfriend, Potter, I will be showing you off at every opportunity," said Draco, linking his fingers together over his stomach.
Harry grumbled to himself about how of an unhelpful friend he was being, intentionally loud enough so that he could hear.
No matter how hard Harry insisted that he would go, Hermione did not let up. Eventually, Harry got the message and caught up to Hermione's pace but she never loosened her iron grip on his wrist. He continuously looked back to Ron, trying to get him to help but he refused, simply stating that it was too funny and that Hermione did have a point.
Draco finally pulled himself out of Harry's grasp. "We've got to go, Slughorn won't tolerate our lateness much longer.
She released the bludgers and the golden snitch and picked up the quaffle with both hands. She blew the whistle hard and tossed the quaffle in the air.
"Ah, Potter." The Professor snapped him from his daydream by a  large window. "I just received an owl from Professor Dellow, are you quite alright?"
"Oh, you know you're welcome anytime, dears," she cupped Harry's face with one hand and Hermione's with the other. "Go on, take your things upstairs now."
As he turned to head back toward the Weasley family, a ghostly presence had joined them. Molly was sobbing as she reached out to touch her son but of course, her hand simply passed through his arm
The score was 70 – 50 to Gryffindor and Harry still had not seen the snitch. He kept his eye on the Slytherin's seeker whose first name Harry did not know but the name 'PARK' was printed on the back of her emerald quidditch robes.
"Shove it, Potter," Draco ripped it off his head, his blonde hair sticking up at random, giving the effect of a rather grumpy, blonde hedgehog. "Granger practically forced it onto my head"
," a voice inside his head growled. Harry couldn't help himself but to look back up at the plaques out of morbid curiousity. He noticed that under the Slytherin banner only one name was etched into the gold plaque, but from across the hall, he couldn't make out what it was. It turned out a lot of students were observing the newest addition to the Great Hall as it took Professor McGonagall three attempts of clearing out her throat to get everybody's attention.
"And fine, I'll tell you what we did. But you cannot tell anyone!" Harry hovered closer to Ron as if anyone could hear them from the ground anyway. "We kinda, sorta. You know, snogged," Harry struggled to get the words out.
He didn't notice Park pulling away, or the tower dressed in Gryffindor banners he was about to crash into. That was, until he did.
The bell signalling the end of the school day resonated through the school and Harry and Ron waste no time in throwing their quills and parchment into their bags and racing back to the Eighth year dorms to change.
Harry pouted and shoved his hands into the pockets of his robes before making his way down to the Great Hall.
Harry stopped squinting into the distance and looked up at Draco who was looking at him with a quite concerned expression.
"Us. I was caught up in a fantasy when I know that you do not feel the same way about me," Harry looked to the ceiling again. Draco's laugh, however, made him frown and turn his gaze back to the Slytherin boy.
"Even I think a break would be good for us," Hermione raised an eyebrow. "Why don't you want to go?"
"Mum said you'd be up here," said Ron flatly. His eyes darted between Harry on what he assumed was Draco's bed and the Slytherin himself, red as a tomato standing at the foot. "What were you doing?"
"Then do you feel the same way for this new bachelorette?" Ron wiggled his eyebrows, making Harry snort. He didn't reply for a while however, thinking about this idea.
Harry felt Draco's hand on his knee before he saw the Slytherin boy. He looked up into his grey eyes, full of worry.
He checked the battered, old watch that had once been Fabian Prewitt's. "It's nearly eleven, you should get on board."
He managed three forkfuls before sitting back in his chair and looking around at the table. The entire Weasley family had come home for Christmas. Ron sat to Harry's left, wolfing down his second helping of lasagne, and Percy sat to Harry's right who was making quiet conversation with his new girlfriend whose name was Audrey. Even Charlie had returned from Romania to celebrate the holidays at the Burrow. Bill and Fleur sat near the head of the table with Mr Weasley discussing something Ministry related Harry assumed, while at the other end of the table George and Mrs Weasley were arguing about something almost definitely Wizard Wheezes related.
Harry saw Malfoy wander up the stairs to the dorm rooms and he excused himself from watching Neville and Ernie's heated game of Gobstones to follow him.
The fire was still crackling, the house elves must not have come yet. Harry wondered what the time was, but he had not checked his alarm clock when he had woken and had left his watch on his bedside table. He pulled out his wand and made his way over the ornate grandfather clock.
"Only if you go with my outfit," Draco quipped. Harry sighed but could not wipe the smile from his face.
It had been ten minutes before Harry saw Draco enter the common room, he looked flustered and a little on edge.
"Good thing you're not otherwise we may not have been beaten Slytherin's arse so easily," Ron laughed while he made his way over to Draco.
What happened next at first Harry did not believe. Ron put his hand out in the air with his signature goofy smile plastered across his face. Draco slowly and hesitantly lifted his own hand to meet his in the most awkward high five in the history of wizard-kind.
"Lumos," Harry whispered. The tip of his wand illuminated a little of his surroundings, but most importantly, it illuminated a trail boot prints left in the snow.
"You don't know?" Ginny raised an eyebrow. "It's all anyone's been talking about since yesterday afternoon!"
Harry rolled his eyes before bringing his hands up to his face to hide himself, resting his elbows on the desk. "'S fine," he mumbled.
He was pleased to observe that Park had not seen the snitch either. Sitting above the game as well, cheering for her team whenever they scored a goal.
Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and jumped in surprise. He looked and saw Professor McGonagall behind him. He found it odd that he was now slightly taller than the Headmistress, a figure he had looked up to since he was eleven.
"Now, now, Severus. I'm sure the boy has other things to worry about than potions class. I hear you're back on the Quidditch team too."
"So you like girls. And Malfoy?" Ron sighed, clearly trying to get his head around the announcement.
Malfoy sighed and readjusted himself in his seat. His pulled up his left sleeve to reveal the Dark Mark, though no longer jet black, contrasting deeply with his pale skin.
"Hmm, truth," said Justin decided, adjusting himself on his bed under his boyfriend who in turn adjusted himself accordingly.
Harry found himself glancing at Parvati Patil next to him awkwardly, an uncomfortable feeling of déjà vu swirling in his gut. He felt a kick in the back of his calf and turned his head quickly to see Draco's sinister smirk.
"Enjoying the view, Potter?" Draco smirked. Harry choked on air, causing Malfoy to raise an eyebrow in his direction.
"Potter, you just have to admit that I'm just a better Seeker than you," Draco smiled as Harry drew near.
"Ten points from both Gryffindor and Slytherin," said McGonagall. "You had a disagreement? Would you two act your age for once in your life? You are not first years anymore, you are eighteen. I shouldn't even have to have this conversation with you."
"Perhaps I'll do the rest of the cutting, save the rest of your precious seeker's fingers," said Malfoy, chuckling as he continued cutting the Knotgrass before scooping it up into his hands
Harry strained his ears to hear Malfoy's reply but none came, the Slytherin boy simply grunted in pain every so often as Madame Pomfrey was administrating whatever treatment she seemed to be applying.
"Yeah, so if we have to put up with your sorry arse for the next week, you have to participate." George spun around, walking backwards so he can address Malfoy directly. "Besides, maybe this would put that signature smirk back on your ferrety face. Malfoy McGloomyface is a bore."
"Disillusionment charm," said Draco, remaining in a hushed tone. "I lifted it when I came in here just now, I don't want everyone else knowing I'm pathetic. Weasley and I, we went to the kitchens and got you breakfast. I can't believe I didn't know where the kitchens were. My father always refused to tell me."
"We've just got to find it," Hermione mumbled to herself. "Ron, could you put a pause on your bacon and help me?"
Kids. Wow. After eight years of constant threats upon his life, Harry had not really had time to plan his life beyond the grounds of Hogwarts. He laughed quietly to himself upon the realisation that he had no plan and little knowledge of the world ahead of him.
Harry opened his eyes and stared up at the uncomfortably familiar ceiling of the Hospital wing. He looked around his bed to see Ron talking to Hermione by his bedside.
Harry thought it best not to push the subject. "It doesn't matter, i prefer somewhere else over the Three Broomsticks anyway. Come on,"
No one said anything, the quiet crackling of the fireplace and the peaceful ambience of the busy street outside where the only sounds preventing total silence.
Ron smiled at his best friend proudly. Terry looked Harry dead in the eye, and then swept his gaze across all the boys in the room.
"Oh, you're here!" She beamed and extended her arms to pull the four of them into her arms. "It's so nice that you can apparate now, makes my life a lot easier without the trip up to London."
"Oh, hi," Dennis beamed, quite flustered at the attention from Harry. "I spent some of the summer at my friend Makrov's house. they're a wizarding family see, so he taught me how to play."
The trio sipped tea out of Hagrid's homemade mugs as they filled an interested Hagrid in on some of their mishaps during the last year.
"Can we just, eat?" Asked Harry awkwardly, very conscious of those attempting to listen in to their conversation as they passed.
Harry, of course, was referring to the moment that happened five days and twenty-two hours ago, not that he was counting. Unfortunately, as their N.E.W.Ts drew ever closer, he and Draco had not had many chances to talk since the kiss in the Shrieking Shack. Even in potions, Slughorn decided that in preparation for their exams that they should brew their concoctions individually. Their interactions over the past week had been limited to small smiles as they passed each other in hallways and in the dorm room as they prepared for bed.
Ron stared blankly back at him for a few seconds before squinting as if he had only just understood the words that came from Harry's mouth.
"I'm not turning gay," he said defensively. "I'm not saying being gay is a bad thing, its just, I'm not."
Harry felt himself being pushed toward a sofa table by Draco and Ron. He stumbled up onto it and looked out across the rowdy Gryffindors.
He had still not talked to Draco, not about their relationship at least. The stress of looming exams and his own stubbornness got in the way every time.
Harry watched sullenly as the younger Gryffindor students headed off to the warm, cosy common room and dorms Harry had fallen in love with. The hall emptied and now there were only four students left at the scarlet and gold table.
"And Slytherin is in possession!" Parker Williams, a fifth-year Ravenclaw boy with a mouth so large that even Harry knew who he was, had taken over the commentator job. "Beckett passes to Vaisey who dodges that bludger from Coote brilliantly. He passes and, oh! Out of nowhere, Weasley takes possession for Gryffindor, turning the play around back to the other end of the pitch. She passes to Creevey, a new addition to the team who passes back to her and – 10 POINTS FOR GRYFFINDOR!"
He wasn't sure why he was obeying Malfoy's words so easily. His first thought was that Malfoy had imperised him without his knowledge.
"Or, cast your mind back even further, almost a year ago now when I lied in front of my parents and some of the most brutal Death Eaters about you. You think I'd do that for anyone else?"
They eventually found themselves back in the Eighth year common room where the few students who decided not to continue with Herbology past their O.W.Ls. One of these students was Draco Malfoy, at a desk bent over a textbook, who raised an eyebrow at Harry as he dragged himself across the common room.
Draco didn't say anything for a while. He looked down at their laps, nodding slightly before he spoke up.
"Expecto Patronum!" Harry yelled. A wisp of silver smoke exploded from the tip of his wand, a wisp of smoke with the legs of a deer, however.
"To the best Quidditch team in the school!" Ron cheered, raising his mug of Butterbeer toward the sky. Harry joined in with the rest of the Gryffindors in cheering with various items held high in the air. "And to Harry Potter, the best Captain in the school!"
It was then Harry realised that Draco was probably still a little mad at him for blowing him off and avoiding talking about their situation just days before. Draco was letting Harry know just how he felt when he was trying to have another very important conversation.
"Well, I'd rather not catch something nasty like that this close to Christmas, especially from Malfoy," Ron leaned back on his pillows.
"Whatever, Potter," Draco smirked, pulling out the chair to Harry's right. "There's going to be a written exam as well as a practical demonstration as Slughorn has drilled into our minds. The written exam should only cover topics from sixth and seventh year in depth but it doesn't hurt to refresh the mind on what we studied from first year til now."
Harry zipped in and out of the other players in pursuit of the Golden Snitch just a few feet in front of him. The Hufflepuff Seeker, Summerby, was right on his tail.
"The difference between Wormwood and Bitterroot? Because I agree, they have many similar qualities." Draco said smugly.
Harry was very surprised at Ron's offer. He looked back down to Draco about three meters below, mounting his broom and kicking off to meet them in the air.
Harry pushed open the doors to the Hospital wing and immediately spotted the only bed which was inhabited.
Harry couldn't help but notice the thin scars around the mark. There was heaps of them, but none obscured the tattoo.
The whisper was for his fathers alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Regulus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was.
The new Headmaster of Durmstrang was a man of few words, and it seemed so were his students. A mere handshake and a murmur of condolences and congratulations were all he received from them.
He climbed the winding staircase, slowly mind you, in no desperation to get caught out of class early. once he reached the top, however, he absent-mindedly knocked on the door, his mind in another place. Unsurprisingly it swung open by itself and he sees the Headmistress send of an owl out of the grand window.
As he opened the heavy wooden door, the sound of water rushing from a shower head startled him for a second before he realised that it was coming from behind a locked shower door.
Harry's eyes shot open and he scrambled to sit up. He regained a sense of his surroundings, the familiar inside of his curtained four-poster bed.
There was no hiding from what Malfoy was clearly about to say, Harry stared at him venomously, wrapping his fingers around his wand in his pocket subconsciously.
"It would be a shame if you survived seventeen years of the most powerful dark wizard in history trying to kill you and you ended up dying of something dull like starving yourself," Draco laughed, touching the tips of his fingers to Harry's.
He remembered how Malfoy told him he was ambushed by a few students and Harry could only assume they were Gryffindors.
He debated brushing his hair but he knew he'd only have to redo later. He did brush his teeth, however, gazing into his own sad eyes in the mirror as he did so.
"How come he didn't tell me I needed a tutor?" Ron frowned as they head up to the eighth year's common room. "If Harry's that bad, I must be getting a grade lower than a Troll!" He laughed.
No one said anything. Harry looked between both Ron and Draco who were both breathing heavily and glaring at each other.
"I feel absolutely honoured that you decided to wake up on my watch." Harry turned his head to the side where he saw Malfoy sitting sideways in the plastic visitor's chair, leaning on one armrest with his legs over the other.
For an uncalculatable amount of time, the two star-crossed lovers held each other as if their very lives depended on it.
"Oh fine!" Hermione whispered, looking up from her books. "If the three of you refuse to do anything, you can go."
"There is a difference between cowardice and self-preservation, a quality you don't seem to possess."
He screamed as he watched his godfather tumble backwards into the gate, held back by Remus as Bellatrix Lestrange cackled without a shred of remorse after killing her cousin and the closest thing to a father than Harry had ever had.
Soon enough, more students trickled through the doors and most people headed up to the dorms to relax before dinner. Harry so desperately wanted to join them, to sink into the mattress and stare up into the canopy to wallow in his grievances but he couldn't just leave Ron and Hermione here so he grudgingly and half-heartedly wrote about the use of undetectable extension charms.
"I'm just stressed, I think," lied Harry. "Doing our N.E.W.Ts after a year of being out of practice."
, it is your fault." Harry was about to argue before Draco cut him off before he could begin. "Which I am thankful for, don't get me wrong."
After lunch, in which Harry half-heartedly ate an apple he decided to take a walk around the garden by himself, out in the fresh summer air. Not two minutes into his stroll, the bustling ginger-haired Weasley sister came bounding up to him.
"Anyway," Draco placed the mug back down onto the table. "I did want to talk to you about... what has happened between us lately."
"We can go back to kissing. Believe me, Potter, I've wanted this far longer than you have but I seem to have self-control," said Draco teasingly.
Something in Harry's chest was tugging toward Draco like a magnet but Harry couldn't imagine how they could be any closer.
The last trace of steam evaporated into the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand was still raised in farewell.
Harry's gaze lingered on Mrs Malfoy for a second before he turned to leave. He couldn't help the selfish beast in his gut that wanted to condemn the woman for supporting the one responsible for his parents not being here. But he kept his mouth shut, it was for the best.
Hermione was forcing them to study, what was new? The Golden Trio and Draco all sat around a round table in the library, their heads buried in books. Well, Hermione was.
As the eighth years moved off to their final class, Harry remained in the corridor just outside the ornate door.
Excited chattering broke out amongst the students, especially those in the older years who had been too young to attend the Yule Ball during Harry's fourth year. It took but a tap of her wand on the podium to quiet the noise.
"Hi, Harry," the girl said sweetly. Harry vaguely remembers her name. Amy? Amelia? "We were seeing where Malfoy was going. Kind of suspicious sneaking off from dinner, don't you think?"
He outstretched his arms toward McGonagall who placed the cup into them gently before raising it above his head, smiling lopsidedly as his brain began to catch up to reality.
"Why didn't you tell me? I'm your best friend for Merlin's sake!" Ron folded his arms across his chest. "And her brother."
Harry smiled as Jessica Silver narrowly missed the Quaffle as it flew through the hoops she was protecting.
"I think, that maybe we should spend a couple of minutes just us." Harry stared down at the floor between them. "It must be tough not being with your family at Christmas. I guess I can't understand what it must be like, all my Christmases growing up weren't very-"
For a second, Harry forgot what he was angry about. Quidditch. He hadn't thought he'd play this year.
Once every Slytherin student had received their diploma, the Hufflepuff students followed, then the Ravenclaws.
"But, I don't despise the idea of working within the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. But I doubt they'd let me in anyway," Draco absentmindedly tapped his left forearm.
"Because its the only way someone could ever love me," said Draco. He let out a small noise that sounded suspiciously like a sob but no tears come out. "Especially not... you."
"I guess I'm... I'm scared," Harry admitted. "I before a few weeks ago I didn't even realise that I could, you know."
"Neither of you has attempted to have a conversation with him yet, how are you so sure he's still a git?" Hermione rolled her eyes, grabbing Harry by the wrist and dragging him out of the classroom. Harry and Ron didn't say anything in response, they just shared the same look they always did when they knew Hermione was not in the mood to argue with them.
Harry reached his hand behind him, running it across the fabric of the sheets. The hand of the intruder covered his and they continued their mournful silence.
"I thought I had a good reason for hating you all these years, but I really didn't," said Malfoy suddenly. Harry wasn't quite sure how he should respond to this. It was such an absurd statement that seemingly came out of nowhere. So Harry said nothing.
Harry sat on his scarlet and gold four-poster bed in his pyjamas, watching Ron take a bean from a box of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans.
The rest of the day passed slowly. A clear sky made their walk down to the greenhouses after lunch quite pleasant but later in the afternoon, Harry dragged his feet as he walked down to the dungeons. Seeing Malfoy was the last thing he wanted to do. The conflicting hatred and pity tore him apart whenever his mind conjured up the sunken, silver eyes of the Slytherin. He followed Ron and Hermione through the doors of the N.E.W.T dungeon but he couldn't see Malfoy anywhere.
This close to Malfoy, Harry could recognise his cologne on the woollen fabric, he could also recognise the chocolate stain near Draco's collarbone,
The last thing Harry wanted was to revisit that day. He squirmed in his seat and Hermione placed a hand on his forearm.
"It's mine," Draco said quickly, looking down at his lap. "I saw it in the Prophet and imagined you'd like it. I apologise."
"I thought it would be nice if he knew where to send letters if he wanted to, in case he's not feeling well."
The Gryffindor Quidditch team all stood together in the centre of the room upon two sofa tables that had been pushed together.
With their broom on the grass in front of them, Draco leant against Harry's right shoulder, staring off into the distance at the lake and the trees beyond.
"Yeah," Draco smiled a little at Ron's enthusiasm. "Just give it a word and it will come back to you immediately, they say from anywhere in the world, but I doubt that."
"Then you fail," Draco shrugged. "But at least you tried instead of being a self-pitying, lazy, arse!"
Harry elected to ignore his comment about his friends but he decided to take a different tactic. "Meet me at midnight then, in front of the fireplace."
Sure enough, Malfoy was curled up on a green armchair by the fire so perfectly still that he could be mistaken for being asleep.
Ginny had told him that Snape had called off the Quidditch cup after only two matches last year without explanation, so much room was alight with anticipation for that day's match as they hadn't been able to for some time now.
"He said he was minding his own business," said Harry. "And he doesn't seem like that's his idea of fun anymore." Harry took another glance over at Malfoy's blonde head. He glanced down at his watch and sighed. His first meeting with the Headmistress was scheduled for ten minutes in her office. He was dreading it. He didn't feel like talking about his feelings with anyone, let alone McGonagall. He began slowly putting all his things into his bag and waved to Ron and Hermione who tried to give him encouraging smiles as he headed out of the library and to the Headmistress' office.
The tryouts were a breath of fresh air for Harry. He felt so at peace to finally be up in the air in brand new Quidditch robes purchased through Owl-Order and his team flying around him.
"A fitting end to Harry Potter?" Draco smirked and finally relaxed his hands into Harry's, leaning forward into him a little. "Something idiotic. Like you come barrelling in to save the day and you trip over your feet and crack your head open on the floor."
"He's probably crying in Hermione's arms right about now," Harry wrapped his arms further around Draco so that they were almost flush against each other.
"Potter, sit," McGonagall ordered. Harry did not hesitate in taking a seat in the cream armchair, it wasn't very comfortable, the line layer of upholstery seemed to be stretched over a wooden frame with the bare minimum of padding. "Would you like to explain yourselves?"
And with that McGonagall left Harry alone with a buttered bread roll with a few pieces of chicken inside as well as a banana.
He decided to shower. The lock of the door echoed through the tile room. He threw his pyjamas and towel into a pile on the shelf and stood under the water, letting it trickle down his body soothingly. HIs soaked hair fell in his eyes so he let his head fall back so the water was hitting his face.
The class soon got to work reading through the theory of conjuring spells and Hermione, who had read the chapter over the summer, began to conjure feathers out of thin air, succeeding on her third try.
"How have you been?" Harry asked stupidly even though he knew that he had received a letter from Draco that morning.
Harry made a break for it when he was sure there was absolutely no one else he had to greet. He spotted Draco easily enough; sitting by himself and lazily levitating a shiny green apple with his wand. Harry dropped into the seat next to him and sighed heavily.
Hogwarts was buzzing with excitement. The Remembrance ball was the following night. Everyone had their robes and their dates. Well, most people anyway.
Harry stayed low to his broom as he weaved between the other players, rolling and diving to avoid collisions and bludgers.
"Did someone do this to you?" He pressed. Malfoy closed his eyes and took a deep breath. But still, he did not answer. Harry found himself unable to hide a smile at his childish stubbornness. A smile turned into a small laugh which definitely got Draco's attention.
Harry stole a glance at Malfoy's bed as he thought about the attackers who put him in the Hospital wing.
"Oh, you need to lighten up, Potter," Malfoy rolled his eyes before walking away. "Are you coming or not?"
"Where are they?" Asked Regulus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform.
"I can't believe he put me with Melissa Linch," said Ron, still complaining about Slughorn's partner assignments. "She kept laughing at everything. What is so funny about leeches?"
"Something you said earlier in the year, or Ernie said it. You said your first crush was a girl, but you have a boyfriend now. Do these things change?"
In a way, Harry could relate to his childhood rival on a level that Ron, Hermione or anyone else in his life could not. Both their childhoods had been tangled up with the Dark Lord against their will and today, even after his death, they were still being affected in different ways to everyone else.
"That's fine," said Hermione as she scribbled something on a spare piece of parchment. "You're welcome to stay afterwards, I'm sure Harry wouldn't mind your company."
"Of course." Harry sort of knew that McGonagall didn't believe him, but she dropped the topic so she must not have been too upset. "I'll let you go to Potions now, remember, I need your decision by the end of the day."
Today, however, as most students lazily packed their suitcases and spent the morning n lounging around the common rooms, it was graduation day for the seventh and eighth years.
"What about you Harry?" Neville asked. Three pairs of eyes fell on Harry and he swallowed thickly. He wasn't sure of his direction any more. He felt the weight of imaginary pressure on him and his stomach knotted. He knew it was all in his head but that didn't make it any less real.
There were two spots left at the table, one next to Ron who was piling his plate with food, still glancing distrustfully at Draco, and the other beside it and adjacent to Arthur at the head of the table.
"I can' believe you broke in ter the Ministry of Magic! With Polyjuice potion!" He exclaimed as Ron told him about their escapade with their stolen identities.
The door behind him creaked open again, silently telling Harry that the conversation was now over. He grabbed his bag, throwing it over his shoulder before standing up out of the chair and back the way he came.
"You should try growing it out," Draco suggested in a distracted tone, his eyes on Harry's bird's nest of hair.
"Biscuit?" She waved her wand and a tray of chocolate chip biscuits appeared on her desk. Harry walked over grumpily and sat down on the guest chair, dumping his bag beside him and taking a biscuit, biting into it unashamedly. The Headmistress walked over to the desk before sitting down gracefully. By this time Harry had angrily eaten two biscuits and had a small pile of crumbs began pooling in his lap.
"So, Harry," said Hermione, finally letting go of his arm. "Without all the prying ears, without Ron, I'd like you to be honest with me. What is going on with you and Malfoy?"
The two walked in what Harry felt was an awkward silence before Draco took a seat opposite Hermione where Harry had been sitting just before. Harry took a seat next to his right and moved his parchment in front of him.
The gentle thud of the boat hitting the far shore of the lake came all too quickly and the group of seventh and eighth years made their way up to the Hogsmeade platform.
He realised at that moment that he had reached the end of his knowledge of what to do. He had never actually kissed someone with tongue, let alone a boy. He let himself become putty in Draco's hands, and his mouth. He attempted to mirror the Slytherin's movements but had absolutely no clue as to whether what he was doing was right.
"No, I didn't! Depulso!" Harry used the banishing charm to send the Quaffle back toward Malfoy, he tried to avoid it, but the Shooting Star was not quick enough, and he was hit in the arm.
"Ah, Mother, I have something of an announcement to make," Draco turned to her. "Potter and I, we have become very close. To put it colloquially, we are boyfriends."
He practically lay flat on his broom, willing it to inch forward just ahead of Park's. He wriggled further up his broom, just enough so that it wouldn't tip. He was almost there.
Harry nodded slowly. "But why do I feel like this. The nightmares, the flashbacks, the food thing. It's not like I don't want to eat, it's that I can't."
What they didn't understand, and Harry didn't either until recently, was that Malfoy had already paid so heavily for his crimes, both those that were placed upon him and those he made of a conscious decision. He had paid in the separation from his father and the house arrest of his mother. But he had also paid with the emotional toll of the horror he had experienced under the influence of Lord Voldemort.
"What do you want?" At least that's what Harry assumed he said, it was a bit hard to tell with the toothbrush in his mouth. Justin spat into the sink and rinsed his mouth before returning to Harry.
Ron was convinced that she was going to announce the return of the Tri-Wizard Tournament while Hermione was adamant that it would be somehow academically related.
"He's here for you now, I suggest you make yourself presentable," she said in a hushed voice but the emptiness of the large room allowed the statement to reach Harry's ears. He continued walking toward the curtained bed slowly to allow Malfoy time for whatever 'making yourself presentable' entailed.
Harry had just finished his assigned meal of steak and salad with a dessert of apple pie when Professor McGonagall stood behind the podium to make her address.
"Oh no, dear," Mrs Weasley took the dirty plate out of Malfoy's hands. "You go upstairs with Harry now and put your stuff down."
"I swear to God, Malfoy," he hissed. "Didn't anything that happened last year knock you off your pretentious, pure-blood high horse?"
But the vapour was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on the broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello.
"What? About us lounging around the common room together?" Draco's hopeful eyes didn't sit well with Harry. Why was he so happy about his potions partner's mistake?
Harry flashed him a sarcastic smile in return but neither of the boys knew how to continue from there. Eventually, Malfoy shot him a quick 'thanks' and walked away, leaving Harry alone in the corridor wondering whether to follow Malfoy or return to the hall.
"What?" Harry asked innocently, looking up at Draco who was sitting on Harry's thighs with his legs either side. "What am I doing?"
"I thought I would have. The first time I rode a broom, boarding the Express to Hogwarts for the first time, my first kiss, my first time. Nothing seems to be good enough," Draco sighed.
"It's gotten a little cold," Malfoy noted. "No peeping," he said, smirking as he faced away from Harry to unbutton his shirt.
"- then Slytherin house will have gained an excellent student, won't it?. It doesn't matter to us, Reg. But if it matters to you, you'll be able to choose whatever house you want over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."
"I'll be right back," he said, heading toward them. They didn't seem to notice him as he made his way toward them. He decided this was a good thing.
It seemed all too soon that a frantic Ernie Macmillan was running around telling everyone that they had to get ready or they'd be late, thankfully his boyfriend threw a pillow at him. However the damage had been done and Draco rubbed his eyes before sitting up off Harry, his hair messed up on the side he had been laying on.
Harry had missed this. The chilly Scottish air hitting his face as he walked through the grounds of Hogwarts, a broom tucked under his arm and Ron Weasley by his side. A small smile reached his lips and he inhaled deeply, the chilly air stinging his nose.
"Malfoy!" He called after him. Draco didn't stop, he kept walking. Harry quickened his pace to a jog, trying to keep up with him. "Draco!" Harry reached out and grabbed the Slytherin's upper arm, forcing him to stop.
"Well, I'll show you." Draco grabbed his partner's wrist and dragged him into the middle of the floor amongst the other couples. "Place your hand on my shoulder."
"You can be the boy now," said Draco, batting Harry's hand away from his own shoulder and placing his hand on Harry's.
Harry looked up immediately to see Draco Malfoy saunter back into the room. Most of his outfit was assembled but Harry immediately noticed that he had neglected to button up his shirt just yet.
Ron rolled his eyes and leant closer to Harry. "He still could have stood up for himself, spineless git."
The seconds felt like hours as the two glanced around the platform. Harry was even about to give up and go back to the burrow when out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco Malfoy appear out of thin air on the other platform.
They hung in the air on their brooms, soon getting bored of tossing the Quaffle back and forth and instead discussing pressing topics like whether Ron would ever be on a Chocolate Frog card.
"Come on, love birds," Ron yawned, kissing his girlfriend on the forehead and waving to her as she left for the girl's dorms. "Let's go look smashing."
"Potter," Draco warned but Harry didn't care. This is what friends do and Draco just had to accept that they were friends.
Aberforth soon came over with a tray of Butterbeer for the four of them. Harry took his mug with a small smile in thanks. He took a sip before sneaking a glance at Ron, who was still adamant on ignoring him.
"What are you out here for,Malfoy?" One of the boys called. About fifty meters away from the group, Malfoy's blonde head stopped and turned to face his pursuers. Harry ducked behind the corner, wishing he had brought his invisibility cloak.
So he knew that Draco didn't hate him. That was good. But he was sure that he had still scared Draco off by his actions the night before.
"And lastly, this year will be focused on inter house relationships. Forming bonds with people outside your house can strengthen our school and your personal lives." Ron let out an over exaggerated groan
Harry bit his lip to prevent himself from saying something he'd regret. He'd only a couple of hours ago gotten back on Ron's good side and he didn't want to go ruining it by defending Malfoy.
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Draco, and Parvati, who spent the celebrations with her seventh year friends rather than her fellow cohort, made their way back to the eighth year dorms briskly to avoid Filch and Mrs Norris.
"That was the point!" he lay his head back against the tall armchair. "All disturbance to that skin, it just heals himself, even with Him dead."
"Hey!" Harry punched him in the bicep. Draco just laughed and flopped onto his own bed before patting the empty space beside him. The Gryffindor rolled his eyes, shrugging off his own jacket before tossing it on his bed and jumped next to Draco.
. Harry realised that he had no choice but to consider the possibility that he had somehow developed more than platonic feelings toward the Slytherin boy. He couldn't be gay, could he? He was sure the feeling he felt for Cho Chang in the fourth year and Ginny Weasley barely more than a year ago was real. But so was this.
"I'm fine," he squeezed his eyes closed to reground himself. "The final team will be posted on the common room notice board. Try-outs are over, thank you, everyone!"
"Still a git," Ron grumbled. Harry thought back to that morning. He had gotten out of bed early to avoid getting changed with the other boys but Malfoy seemed to have had the same idea. They had stared at each other for a few seconds before Malfoy left for the common room, leaving Harry to sit on his bed to wait for the rest of them to wake up.
Draco looked around hastily. "We are not doing this out here." He dragged Harry to the nearest empty classroom and shoved him inside.
He sat at the Gryffindor table but made no effort to eat, he talked with his friends as they decided who they were going to root for.
It was tradition, the Captain's Speech. It wasn't speaking in front of a room full of rowdy teenagers that got Harry's gut twisting. It was also tradition to end the speech with a kiss to one's significant other. Harry was sure that after the two of them shared a dance together at the ball after many months of rumours, that his relationship with Draco was no secret.
Harry was determined not to stare just to spite Draco, so he didn't. Focusing instead on the fake Snitch in his hands, tossing it up and down.
The Dursley's hadn't taken Harry to the beach much during his childhood but one of the times they did begrudgingly allow him to play in the sand with his cousin, the waves had been very powerful.
"How long have I been here?" Harry groaned in discomfort. The two faces of his best friends lit up as they heard his voice.
Ernie and Justin both laughed. "It may just blow your mind but Justin likes both boys and girls," Ernie explained. Ron's frown got even deeper and Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise. The whole dormitory seemed to have this reaction and the two lovebirds sighed.
"You are so kind, and brave," Mrs Malfoy rested a hand on her son's forearm. "And you have done so much for my son over the past year."
"It was my conversation she overheard," Harry sighed. This caused Draco to look up at him through his eyelashes. "In potions, probably, she came up to me at breakfast and told me herself."
Kingsley Shacklebolt introduced him to the new head of Magical Law Enforcement, the President of the American magical community as well as the Australian and Russian Ministers for Magic.
The living room of the burrow was filled with Weasleys. Though Fleur matched Draco's complexion, the Malfoy still stuck out like a sore thumb.
After the battle of Hogwarts, Harry, though glad he had finally rid the world of Lord Voldemort, he couldn't help the overwhelming darkness of the guilt and trauma.
"I don't think any of the Slytherins will be brave enough to show up," Hermione scoffed. Harry propped himself up on his elbows upon hearing this.
"I'll be beside you the whole time," Harry promised. "For this evening, you will be an honorary Gryffindor."
"What those students did to you, simply a disgrace to Hogwart's name," the nurse said quietly, but not quiet enough. Harry's mind started to race. He began seriously doubting McGonagall's diagnosis of a meagre 'cold'.
"Yes, we can actually have a conversation in here," Hermione glanced between Ron and Harry, trying to get them to pick up on her intentions.
From the few weeks he had been sharing a dormitory with the Slytherin, Harry knew that Draco was not a morning person and would never leave the common room without looking presentable. He had also not seen the boy go to bed. In fact, he had not seen him since Ron caught the two of them on the Quidditch field. Ron was not happy with him, nor was Hermione for that matter. After a long and tiring argument, Harry and Ron went to bed without making up and Harry fell asleep trying to think of ways to make it up to him.
Harry nodded. They stowed away the broom under Harry's bed and head back down to the Great Hall just as the students began to disperse for first class.
He lay his head on his pillow and watched as Draco Malfoy carefully folded the red and gold scarf on his bedside table.
"Probably all the Ravenclaws," Ron flicked his wand to make a ball of paper bounce above his head while he lay on his bed. "Knowing Neville's grandma, he'll be coming back too."
Exchanging the letter for his gloves, Harry scanned the garden and found George easily enough. He wore a long brown coat with golden dragon hide boots that disappeared into the white snow.
Draco huffed before he readjusted his position to lay on his stomach, propping himself up on his elbows next to Harry.
"This was my fault," Draco admitted, unconsciously rubbing his thumb over the back of Harry's hand. "If I hadn't dropped them-"
This is why they moved us. Neekeal is trusting in Wardwood and so is Kingsley. And I may too, but Dray is too precious to me to risk him. If I have to waste time searching for this soil, then be it. But, I am pretty sure Voldemort is not looking for such thing, he is actively looking for Draco Black, the wizard. Which led me to ask myslef: is Voldemort aware of Draco's real father? For all I know, he could be. Still, there's someone that knows, even if that person is not alive.
“Where’s Parkinson?” Goldstein asks while entering the room and going directly to smart-healer lady.
Hair as blond as the rays of the sun itself, shining as if hundreds of diamonds were entwined in its strands; hands so milky, with long and delicate fingers dance on the neck of an instrument, whose name I do not remember anything about.
"Yes, Teddy," I say, leaving a kiss on his brown hair. "Dray," I say pointing with my index finger, at the blonde head dressed as a prince.
"Your sun is doing that, Harry," I tell him and in a matter of seconds, Harry's sun disappears. But not the heat.
“Not at you, never at you,” I say to her. “Just to whomever took your daddy,” I say to her. Because right now, I don’t have a daughter. She is the asset’s daughter. Not mine. Not now.
Dray's gray eyes stare at me and I can see the storm raging inside him. Four days ago I built Dray's magic while we were making love… And the next day, in our apartment, Zephora, Regulus and Albus were ready to launch questions and demand answers, that not even we understood or has an answer to.
“You know this mean your moon child is in danger, right?” she asks me. “Blood magic usually links two people minds.”
"When Dray was days from being born, Cissa took him with her to a small cabin on the outskirts of Wales, and when Dray's biological father came to see him for the first time, he noticed that his son had elf ears," he says with a voice as cold as snow. "So, he cast a spell on Cissa and took the little baby with few hairs and blue eyes and..." I see him look into the distance, as if he could see Dray's biological father in that same room. "He cut off Dray's 'excess of ears', his inhumanity," says Regulus, and my stomach becomes a huge knot. “That afternoon, I had to go to Cissa's, to make sure that little Dray had everything he needed in that little house near a Muggle village. But when I got there, Dray was in his crib, his pale head glowing red and his little eyes closing with exhaustion. The Death Eater Cissa had fallen in love with, the one that had promised her, the one that had changed, held his wand with a big smile on his lips as he watched the little ‘Abomination’ slowly bleed into a crib.” Tears fall from Regulus' eyes and I hear Hermione breathe hard. Mrs. Weasley's gaze is one of rage. Rage towards the one who did that to a little boy. "So I pulled out my own wand and cast a spell to knock him unconscious, I took Dray and Cissa and apparated them to Zephora's," Regulus stands up, putting physical distance between himself and everyone present. "And Zephora said it was best to seal Dray's power until it was inevitable, until he could defend himself."
"To France," Robards replies. "You and your team will be in charge of put together a safe house for the boy in France."
"Your family is cute, Harry," the boy murmurs, looking at everything around him calmly, until the environment is interrupted by a sound coming from somewhere in the boy's body. "Excuse me, I need to answer this or someone is gonna fired me,” his cheeks flush as he makes his way out the front door.
"I needed excuses to kiss you," Dray tells me, clinging to my body. Without thinking, I wrap my free arm around his slim body and place a kiss on his lips.
"You mean when Lucius cut off his ears?" I ask him, feeling the need to find Dray, wrap him in my arms and never let him go.
“You are strong. I know we can get through this, together,” and I lay down by his side, preparing myself for the worst. Because, for the next few days, maybe I will have to love for the both of us.
I let go of him, still hovering closer to him, just in case. His grey eyes are focus solely on Hermione and I know this is not going to be easy.
I cast a quick Scourgify on the heavy thing. It is a jar, a jar full of gummy bears and jelly snakes. Odd, they are all Muggle sweets.
“Unlike you, dear Auntie Bella” he says looking her straight in the eyes. “I am not a retarded wizard.”
I smile at the man, nodding gently and leaning back against the wall. Up to here we listen to the music that rather than relax, reminds me of battles and then, a few minutes later, I can almost perceive the sea breeze caressing my hair.
"Harry wasn't wrong," I hear Arthur tell me. "His nervousness almost faded," he tells me, looking at the scene in front of us. Harry's eyes shining with admiration and something else.
From one moment to the next the room begins to fill with "Awws" and "how cute he is". And it takes a couple of minutes until the room calms down again.
I look down at his finger. My magic is angry, really angry because the asset is lost and she is craving it’s closeness. Which, right now, is not an option.
And his intelligence, along with his loyalty and deep hatred towards Harry Potter is what still holds him among the highest ranks. Everyone in this house knows that Severus Snape would sell the whole world for killing Lilly Evans' son. The memory of his failed revenge and the death of his Lord.
“There was this weird other with golden roses,” I say to her. “And the other weird one, black and green and silver and it had two As. Oh, and two dragons.”
"But for what other reason would you abandon those whom you have known all your life?” I ask to no-one.
Until I decide differently. This time I plant my feet on the floor of the tub and start to push up every time Draco comes down on my cock and hits him, trapping his cock between our bodies and I hear him moan.
"Oh, believe me, Draco was the person who made me make the most trips to the hospital wing," I reply to Teddy.
"Look, Harry," Dray tells me, bringing the animal to his chest. "It is pretty." However, the horned serpent with a bird's beak stands up and looks at Dray. "Don't worry, Harry knows people who are going to make you all good," Dray tells it and then does the unthinkable.
She is interrupted by the doors appearing and then, Ron is walking through them with five people behind him. Hermione left me there to run in Ron’s direction and I smile. They look cute embracing each other.
"Harry, Chrysalis only come out at night. They are called night butterflies for a reason,” his hand moves and the muggle stove goes out. "And they live in the forbidden forest," he says seriously. “This was not only before the established bedtime. The chrysalis come out thirty minutes before midnight, until five in the morning the next day,” my cheeks turn red and I know that maybe tonight I will have to sleep in the couch.
