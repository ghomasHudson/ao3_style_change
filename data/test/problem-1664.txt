When they reached their apartment Draco dragged him straight to their bed. "Harry...I've told you how I feel about things like this. I hate pain and I'm really frightened about taking this potion..."
“Lay down, Draco...” Harry whispered.
He frowned at her in confusion but replied with a softly questioning hum.
Draco lifted his wand and used his magical core to search for his ties to the ward spells. He adjusted them, nodded to Hermione and then he kissed Harry’s cheek. “Thank you.”
“Kingsley…what’s going on? Why is this issue so important to the wizengamot?” Harry asked as gently as possible.
“Why not?” Harry frowned in confusion.
“Shhh...” Ignoring his nakedness, Harry pulled him out of his chair and into his arms. “You
"First, you all know Professor Severus Snape." Headmaster Dumbledore called out as the well known professor stood. "He will be taking over Defense Against the Dark Arts this year."
The crowd clapped as Draco grinned at his husband from the corner of his potions garden.
One night, just after having closed the case, Harry returned to his home and found an envelope from Draco in with his post. Opening it, he found a letter in Draco’s handwriting. He bit his lip as he read that Hermione had informed Draco and Viktor that he was away on a mission and they wished him luck. The blond also told him to let them know when he was ready for the Seekers’ Game they’d planned. With an excited grin, he hurried to his study and pulled out the stationery that Hermione had given him for his last birthday. He got out his favorite quill and wrote that he’d like to meet soon – perhaps even in the next day or so. He rushed up to the room he kept as an owlry and sent the letter with a lovely barn owl called Juliette after instructing her to wait for a reply.
Dudley pulled the coin pouch out and counted quickly. "Sixteen silver coins and five gold."
“Well, I'm not practicing for the ballet! What does it look like?” The boy in question was in absolute distress. “Please help me get off this platform?”
“Never...have I ever...spoken Parseltongue...” Draco smirked as Harry lifted his drink in a silly salute and swallowed the shot.
“I can smell the tuna from here, Harry.” She said covering her mouth and nose. “It’s SO gross! How can you eat that?”
Harry looked up in surprise.
“I don’t know, Harry.” Ron said frowning. “It could’ve happened just the way he said...but the way he wouldn’t meet our eyes as he told us his story...Mate, it doesn’t look good.”
The answer came from the unlikely source that was his mother. She wrote asking if Draco wanted anything in particular for his birthday, but the way she'd worded her letter was quite leading so Draco sat and thought to himself what she could mean.
“Not today...” Draco said sighing mysteriously as he turned to open the door. “Viktor’s inside. I’ll show you to the locker room.”
"Edith." Harry answered in an awed whisper.
Gasps were heard around the table.
“That’s great, ‘arry!” Hagrid said with a huge grin as he handed over the sheet of parchment for him to write their names down before returning to his partner.
“Dragon! Please don’t…” Harry whispered.
He repeated the things he’d said to Draco but added some as well. “Well, he’s never treated me with awe or deference just because I’m the ‘Boy Who Lived’.” He rolled his eyes but kept going. “I’ve always felt drawn to him and he’s always kept my interest. I know what he went through for the last few years. He saved me once and I’ve saved him… I’ve thought differently about him ever since then. Seeing him at school everyday and on Hogsmeade weekends… I’ve noticed how beautiful – I mean, handsome – he is and when I heard the Malfoys speaking and found that his sexuality meshed with mine, I was very interested…”
"Yes, indeed." Korlag nodded handing over a sheet of paper. "This shows that there is recent activity in one of the previously stagnant accounts. I didn't authorize any movement of funds from any of your vaults in the last thirty days and yet the balance is down by over a thousand galleons. I believe your guardian has gone around me and embezzled."
Lucius’ paranoia also had him setting traps. There were surveillance spells and portraits as well as the elves that would report to the elder Malfoy so they even had to fool those before they’d be allowed to enjoy their time together. Harry’s treatment of Draco had to seem harsh and crass because his father would never believe that Harry Potter would love his son and treat him well – and if he did believe that, he’d look closer into Draco’s supposed impotence.
“But he was able to open the Chamber of Secrets!” Blaise pointed out.
This seemed to only confuse Dudley more. "Ok, what's a muggle again?"
Harry sighed trying to think of what would convince his husband. They were in the sitting area of their suite arguing over the elder Malfoys’ offer to allow Lyra and Caelum to spend their nights in the nursery that remained attached to the master suite. Draco felt that the three nights they’d spent away from the children were already too much and wanted them in the suite that was designated for their little family. While Harry had missed his little ones, he felt that since he and Draco rarely got time alone, they should take Narcissa and Lucius up on this.
Draco thought to himself as he stared in the window of the shop. The necklace on display was the perfect gift for his mother this Christmas. She'd been so wonderfully supportive through the last several months and he wanted to give her something special.
I know you'll have questions but I promise that all shall be answered in time.
"Well, what if you just meet them. Have coffee or something...Drinks?" Dean knew one of those numbers and thought it was interesting that a muggle girl was acting as wingman to help Harry Potter land a date with Draco Malfoy. "Maybe it'll make the decision easier."
“Bloody hell…” Ron said as he read his copy of the letter. “Bloody Hell… Bloody HELL!”
Harry was hot on Dudley's heels. As soon as he was alone, Harry opened his letter. It was from the Ministry telling him they'd detected his use of magic in a muggle area but as no muggles were present this was a warning.
“Lucius said ‘the end of the month’, Harry.” Rax reminded him. “That time has not yet arrived. When my copy was being created my son told me it would be a fortnight but that’s when we learned that it actually took a full month.”
“Well, before you rush off, here’s a new spy device from the Unspeakable division.” He handed a pocket sized journal to each of them. “They communicate with each other and I have one as well. If you have thoughts or concerns… Hell – if you just want to talk – write in it. Unless you want the group to know what you’re writing, direct your words to one person. You’ll be able to see who wrote, so if I say: Harry – call me…Harry will be the only one to see those words and instead of ‘me’ he will see my name.”
Dobby protested. "But Dobby must show you around the suite!"
He was telling the truth. The house that was so overwhelming in its inherent darkness was now bright and cheerful. The façade was brick while the door was bright white. The structure had been more like a cold castle or jail but now seemed much more welcoming. Harry smiled at the tracks of ivy and climbing roses that were decorating the walls of the monstrous house.
“You knew about the danger?” Harry asked while choosing the clothing he would wear. His favorite black trousers seemed to call his name, as did a green silk shirt Draco had made him buy a few weeks ago.
Sirius nodded immediately and, although he didn't seem enthusiastic about it, Remus agreed as well. "Go back to bed, Remmie. I'll be along soon." When Remus nodded, Sirius sighed and waited until the door was closed behind him. "Dumbledore has had a lot to do with the lives of so many people, Harry. The truth is difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept...but we do accept it and support you."
Draco nodded silently fighting a grin. He knew Harry well and loved to please him as he’d once loved to taunt.
Pansy read aloud the letter she’d received from her father. Lucius related dealing with a few legal matters while Narcissa confessed to shopping for her grandchildren. Harry and Draco enjoyed their tales and told how they’d gone to the Tower of London and seen the Crown Jewels not to mention the ghosts of the two princes. Harry remarked upon the unreality of the apparitions and how they seemed to be one dimensional rather than the way wizard ghosts looked.
They were both breathless when Harry pulled back.
When Harry calmed, he felt peaceful – as if a huge weight had lifted from his chest. He lifted his head from Draco’s shoulder and looked into glistening silver eyes. “I think I know what I want our daughter’s name to be…”
“It seems like there’s a note from each couple!” Harry smirked. “Ron and Hermione say that they love the names we chose and congrats on fitting so well with you and your family. Molly and Arthur agree that adding Malfoy to my name was the right thing to do. George and Katie are glad I’m happy no matter what my name is. Penny and Percy say ‘thanks for the wreath’ and they like the names we chose. Dean and Ginny are happy that we’re happy. Bill, Fleur, Charlie and Gus think our names compliment each other, and the babies’ names are delightful. They also sent a list of names they’ve chosen for their own kids. Do you want to hear?”
Draco stood behind the couch with his feet shoulder width apart and bent over a little to grip the back of it. Harry’s hands caressed his legs as the brunette pulled the trousers and underpants down to Draco’s ankles.
Harry barely spared the elder Malfoy a glance as he flipped hastily through the sketches so Sirius reached out to calm him with a soft word. "I'll find it."
Harry frowned down at him. “Maybe...and maybe not...what kind of favor?”
Draco bit his lip and thought about the times he’d seen the snake in the garden. He recalled the first encounter and how Harry translated her promise to refrain from biting him or the children. The dog and the house-elves were even safe as well and all this from a single promise of a snake…If it had been just words, and not backed up by the truth of action – or inaction as the case may be – then Draco might have refused. As it stood, Draco lowered his impatiently squirming daughter to the ground and nodded to Harry. “I haven’t learned antivenin potions yet, Harry. You’ll need to ask her for a sample of her venom so that Al can develop one for us to keep on hand. You should also secure her promise not to bite my parents.”
Dudley finished the story. "So somehow that means I'm a squibble and I can come with Harry to be in the magical world."
Draco sighed, rolling his eyes. Could this Weasley be any more oafish?
"Who do you think will be able to?" Draco asked. "Hagrid?"
"It's nothing dangerous, Harry." Remus assured him gently. "I'll avoid him as much as possible so the compulsion spells don't take effect."
Harry nodded solemnly. “Of course I can, Dragon. I won’t have you feeling unattractive when you’re anything but.”
When they reached the master suite Draco found himself delicately gathered into his husband’s arms. He cleaved tightly to his lover who began to murmur soothing noises softly into his ear.
"Most of you will know by now that Lord Potter is searching for the founders' secret quarters." She explained. "So far, all but Slytherin's have been found and explored."
After receiving the package from the jewelry store a few days prior to the wedding, both young men agreed that their last courting gift to each other could be the wedding rings and Draco insisted on paying Harry back for his ring.
“Good…” Harry growled as he found the mark he’d left on Draco’s neck during the first few days of their re-acquaintance. He attached his lips to it and suckled with passion making it darker again. “Mine…”
Harry sighed. “What?”
“I’ll take you to meet them over the holidays.” Harry said as they walked out into the cold.
“Indeed, my friend. It is not his day.” Viktor looked distinctly proud of himself and Harry dearly wanted to wipe that arrogant grin off the other man’s face.
"Thank you, Professor." Draco replied as he scooped up his books and hurried to join his father. They walked slowly, allowing Dumbledore to get some distance.
"No, it's dorm style." Harry told her with a knowing look. "One for girls and one for boys. Blood relation to me is the only requirement."
"I'm sure you remember the second task of the tournament since it wasn’t that long ago ...and how Ron was taken for me to save? He's my best friend; practically a brother to me." Harry smiled as the other boy nodded once. He let a bit of fire flash in his green eyes. "However many branches on the family tree there may be between Ron and me ... however many arguments we may have, the Weasleys are more family than you are."
Harry’s eyes shone with happiness and pride as his hand intertwined with his husband’s. “Totally understandable.”
“Harry?” Draco whispered.
“This is hardly the place for a conversation like this one.” She lifted her chin and tossed her hair. “Lord Potter, might we adjourn to your office or something?”
Marcus was still looking for a new elf when Harry mentioned to him that he wondered if Dobby’s old friend Winky was still around. They asked the Headmistress, found that Winky was indeed still a member of the Elven staff, and still wished she had a family to care for. With the help of Minerva McGonagall Marcus had a new elf and was able to return to teaching.
Draco patted Harry’s hand with a slight smirk. “She’s not the first to have a problem with us and she won’t be the last.”
"Yeah. Harry's taking me through for my orientation so we can meet with the Headmistress." Dudley confirmed. "I'm living here, though, so I'll be able to say goodbye on the first."
"It was also decided that Malfoy and I will partner for all the classes we share. I hope we don't have to have this conversation multiple times, Ron." Harry frowned.
"You know something, Uncle." Draco scanned the older man's face. "Somehow...I know you do."
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
“Don’t…” Draco protested refusing to relinquish Harry’s embrace. “I don’t want to be alone yet.”
Then, the war ended and he testified for Draco and his mother, hoping beyond hope that it would be enough to keep them out of Azkaban... and it was.
Harry glared at them. "I'm losing the buzz I got from Draco's kiss."
Harry appeared and looked around but to Draco's mind it looked like he couldn’t see past the fog until he took a step forward. That’s when the castle came into view and his skin crawled at the eerie sight, knowing he wouldn't be able to interact with the other boy as he got a closer look at the lake next to the castle. It was disturbing to have Harry look through him thinking he was the Black Lake and turn toward the castle.
“No-no – that just won’t do. The parents provide the robes for their childrens’ wedding and reception. Lucius is quite right to say so.” Narcissa grinned. “We’ll get you a new set as well, Harry. No matter the cost.”
“Chosen!” Marcus stood up and took the parchment from the brunette.
"Harry?" Ron called. "Are you in there?"
"Gah!" Harry shouted and pushed the older man off.
/*/*/*/*/*
Harry looked it over and noted with joy that it was a fairly large manor house. He'd be able to host his family and his betrothed there for the holidays, though Tom would be excluded from their number. "Thank you, Korlag. I'll be in touch."
Ron wasn’t far behind but Harry already had the cloak in hand when he arrived. The redhead took the invisibility cloak and threw it over his head, hurrying to catch up with his cousin.
“Nope...” Harry winked and began to unbutton the blond’s shirt. “I want to do that for you, love.” He carefully undid each button and spread the material before kissing his pregnant husband’s chest. By the time Harry finished pleasuring his dragon, it was deep into the night and they both drifted off into a restful slumber.
"She didn't get a chance to say his surname because I hung up when she said his first, but you should've told me it was him!" Draco lamented. "You're his friend! You had to know it was his number!"
“Yes." Harry said with a smile. "The bed was a beautiful four poster; each post was a tree and the branches met above the mattress with the curtain flowing from the canopy and embroidered with a willow pattern. The carpet was a mix of deep green and dirt brown."
"Dudley has his own money." Harry said as he handed the correct form to his cousin. "How much do I owe you for the other two?"
“Now touch the cat,” Harry said.
"But it obviously mattered to Gunnora." Harry deduced instinctively. "And perhaps, her husband?"
Hermione grinned upon seeing him stride down the staircase. “You look so similar to Sirius with your hair that way.”
"Mcgonagall must've seen the papers and put it together." Harry nodded thoughtfully.
“That’s great...” Harry frowned and repeated his correction but she didn’t seem to take notice. “Draco, would you like some tea?”
“She told me to give you something small and frivolous because the real gift is the thought and emotion behind it along with the enjoyment you’ll get from just opening a gift from me.” Harry shrugged. “She also said you’d appreciate me being open minded... but I have no clue what that means because I think I am pretty open minded... at least since the war...”
"Yes." Harry said as they walked in. "You see, I'd spoken to a snake before our duel in second year...a python at a muggle zoo. My accidental magic set him free. Your little stunt only taught me that there was more to it."
When Garnett was finished both young men were more than satisfied with their trunks. "Mr. Potter, with the purchase of three trunks I am able to offer you a free rucksack!"
Harry hummed. "I've come into control of my life. After the death of my parents, a certain  old wizard took an unhealthy amount of interest in me. Through the machinations of that old wizard, I grew up with people who treated me horribly. With the assistance of my Gringotts estate manager, I discovered my wealth and title in time for my fifteenth birthday. I'm sure you read the Daily Prophet and the Quibbler recently...?"
The other boy frowned and pointed to his ear while shaking his head.
"Do not be afraid." A voice called from the doorway. "I apologize for my failure to warn you that this would happen. I am Olgok - healer of the goblin people. There are spells in the device you occupy that make it easier to see what's going on in your body. With this, we will determine exactly how to heal any damage."
Harry frowned uneasily at the tone of the solicitor’s voice. “Yes. He began the training in mid-September just after the twins’ birth. Why?”
Harry reached up and squeezed the other nipple at the same time, causing the blond to begin writhing under him. “Dragon, you feel so good under me...I can’t wait much longer...”
“I’ll be visiting all of the common rooms over the next week or so.” Harry smiled at him. “I’d like you to join me in yours with a friend or two. Anyone who might be interested in talking to me."
"I really need ten compartments, Mr. Tertell. Do you have anything like that?" Harry thought for a moment, mildly impressed that the owner himself was helping them. "I think four wardrobe compartments will do, with space for clothing, shoes, and accessories for each season. Three compartments should fit all my school supplies including potion ingredients and equipment as well as books for all subjects. I'd also like a specialized compartment for my quidditch gear. My pet supplies should have a space as well and then the last one could be a catchall."
A slow smirk crept across the older man's face as he contemplated this. "With what, pup?"
“I can’t believe Viktor is capable of this!” She said sitting on the bench next to him. “When we wrote each other during school, he seemed so chivalrous and gentlemanly…quiet. I thought it was just the language barrier when he was watching me study.”
"I know I'm only fifteen, but my actions over the last four years warrant respect even if my title doesn't." Harry continued.
“You don’t know that.” Blaise stared at him.
"I know what you're thinking." Harry smirked. "Our friends won't like it. Your mother might not be happy about it. We'll get loads of howlers from the public at large..."
“Do we have to keep the baby’s name a secret?” Harry asked. A week had passed since Harry had divulged his idea for the name of their newest daughter and all Draco had allowed him to tell was that the child had a name.  “I’m really excited about it and I want to tell everyone!”
“You are forgiven Draco,” the older blond said; nodding formally, before addressing the newest member of the family. “Harry, I do hope there were no health problems that may have influenced this outburst of tardiness.”
Harry's mouth went dry and he backed out of the greenery staggering down the path to a stone bench.
Harry watched in fascination as the elves bowed and curtsied to his son.
“I sorry, Unca Ry.” The little boy sighed for a moment but soon perked up. “You gonna put your owl on my toy?”
“I don’t know…” Harry sighed. “What about the spells?”
Harry narrowed his eyes at the blond. He was amused that Draco could switch from shy and vulnerable to demanding in such a short time, but he wanted to test his lover. He huffed as he left the butter on the counter and walked to the pantry. “I just bought some yesterday …didn’t know why til now because it’s usually only the kids who eat it.” He opened the jar and took out a clean butter-knife. With his playful glare in place, Harry used the knife to scoop some out. "Is this what you want?" He asks holding the Nutella covered knife out.
Harry cleared his throat. "Molly, everyone… This is our elf, Dinki. Lucius and Narcissa gave her to us for Christmas and she's a really big help. She's Dobby's sister."
"I called the numbers, Dean!" Draco shook his head and gripped his hair. "Michelle told me their names."
"I expect an explanation." Snape informed him. "My office after dinner."
“My husband had given me leave to name girl children while he would name the boys.” Altaira nodded wistfully. “So I had a name preference that I began to use in my private moments with her…Silvana.”
“Look, Harry...I think they’ll be fine.” Draco smiled softly. “We raised our children to be good kids and they’ve always been close. I really think they’ll be more confused than anything. They never saw you in any sort of bad light.”
They smiled at each other from across rooms but Draco never approached Harry and Harry let it stand.
She giggled as she looked intently at Harry's face. "You don't want me to flirt with him, do you?"
Harry licked the spot this time. “Are you close, slave?”
Dropping bonelessly back onto the chair, Draco sighed. “Alright! So it’s true. I have a crush on Harry.”
He was sitting in one rocking chair holding their daughter. Lucius was holding Caelum in the other one. Both children were asleep and oblivious to the tears running down Draco’s cheeks as he rocked Lyra.
“Of course not!” Vega’s eyebrow arched. “I’m usually at the Manor or the magical herbological conservatory that was founded in my name. When I heard the current heir’s spouse would be visiting, I knew I simply must stay to meet you.”
Draco whimpered and shook his head. "I want you in me when I come, Harry. Please?"
Draco sighed happily until he heard Harry’s next words.
“Lyra…” Harry whispered as he addressed the tiny baby. “You said my name, Lyra! You and Caelum have both said it now!” He grinned and fussed kissing her little cheek. He swept her into his arms and cuddled her before shooting off bright purple sparks for his daughter to enjoy. “Dinki, I want you to bring this vial to Narcissa and Lucius. Tell them it’s important that they look at it very soon.” Harry smiled as Dinki nodded still teary-eyed.
Harry grinned and kissed his husband lightly. “I also received this.” He handed Draco the letter from his parents.
The blond shrugged. “Yes...of course...”
"Luna Lovegood's parents and mine were friends too... make of that what you will but consider your words carefully the next time we meet." Harry's grin remained sharp edged as he stared the other boy down. "It's really too bad you don't have more respect for others. I acknowledge you as a relative but you and yours will not replace anyone in my eyes nor in the public eye. Must I make it any clearer?"
The blond nodded. “Yes, Harry’s not a politician so he doesn’t know how to subtly negotiate the twists and turns. He did alright during those few months before the wedding but now…? He’s out of practice and it shows…to me at least.”
“Mmm.” Pansy’s eyes fluttered and snapped open. “Oh, lord!”
“I suppose he’ll want to catch up with someone from Slytherin, but he wasn’t ever very impressed with me or Father,” Draco shrugged. “I think he was neutral in the war. I suppose if Pansy has her way, he’ll likely be visiting frequently though.”
Master Loveday nodded his agreement and Draco hurried off.
“Can you call me Harry when you do...see me later that is?” Harry asked teasingly.
“Thank you,” she whispered as she sat.
Draco only nodded as he moved back over to the bookcase. A book on basilisks soon sat on the bed instead of the shelf, along with one on aquatic animals and husbandry of them and several more on aquatic plants. He held one up to show the others. "This one looks interesting, Harry."
“It comes in several other shapes: a wolf, a cat, a snake, a dragon...” He said ticking them off on his fingers. “It also comes in the form of: an eagle and a bear.”
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. “You did? So when I took your wand… you really just surrendered it? I could’ve sworn you said ‘take the wands and go – hurry’. But what worried me was the look in your eyes that said ‘take me with you’.”
“I understand that, Draco, and you know that I love the twins as much as you do…but if we keep them with us then your parents can’t help or they’ll risk walking in on us. You know they want to help us.” Harry reasoned softly. “I think your mother’s idea has merit. We should spend our days with your parents and the children but reserve the nights for being alone…at least until we conceive.”
“Of course, Narcissa.” Harry nodded and took a bite of treacle tart into his mouth.
“Harry! No!” Draco scolded him. “I want it this way. I like that we’re the only two who know the baby’s name!”
“Your son has decided that he doesn’t want to wear blue today,” Draco began to smile but a tear ran down his cheek.
Draco looked startled at first and then he blushed and grimaced. “Too much information Father.”
Harry moaned and held the blond tighter before beginning to rub his cock into Draco’s back.
Draco chewed his lower lip. “That does sound nice… but we’re expected…”
Harry opened the door and told Astoria what had been agreed to. She frowned but nodded her agreement before leading the way down the corridor. They soon arrived at the door to Draco’s suite. Harry glanced at the woman beside him. “Did you tell him what time to expect me and that I’d be taking over his suite?”
Calmed by her husband, she went to the floo and called Andy’s healer. The woman came quickly and by the time Harry and Draco arrived in the room, she had her findings.
Harry shook his head. "Please just hear me out?"
Draco nodded and they left the bar. "Your place or mine?"
Harry saw him and hurried over to greet him, obviously hoping for another kiss but, with Draco's stuffy nose, he held up a hand and apologized. "Not feeling well, Harry. I took a Pepper-up but I'm not better yet. Sorry."
“I hope it tells you that I’m not going anywhere,” the blond said softly. “I love you, Harry.”
“I’ll be there but...erm will it be a large event?” Harry asked.
Draco considered this. Yes, Harry might just be correct. When his father said he approved of the Kent locale, what he meant was that it seemed safe and secure for his son’s new life. By mentioning to Harry that the ministry would ward it, he provided an extra measure of that security that Harry would likely have forgotten. The point about the floo was to be sure there was a line of communication and travel open at all times. The spelled border would not just protect Draco and their children, it would keep Harry and the dog safe as well. Finally, by reminding Harry about the first week of summer vacation, he was saying that he wanted one last week of his son’s company before Draco truly started acting like a married man with children on the way. Draco wished he could give that to his father but he’d never be able to, because Draco no longer felt like a child. He felt like an adult and he had adult responsibilities to take care of.
Draco nodded and knelt on the couch to bend over the arm. Harry warmed the lube with a quick charm before applying it to Draco’s opening. Draco moaned with pleasure upon feeling Harry’s fingers enter his body. When he felt Harry’s finger lightly brush his prostate, Draco whimpered and reminded Harry of what he really wanted.
Harry patted his ‘dog’s’ head and looked over at George. “Let’s find out if she’s seaworthy.”
"Boy or girl?" She asked, suddenly awake enough to function. "What do they look like? Your type or mine?"
Draco glared a moment longer before sweeping off toward the lagoon. He hurried through the garden and as he entered his favorite place on the grounds, he tried to recall which direction Nagini had come from.
"Alright. Let me know if you change your minds." Harry grinned and turned to Ron and Ginny. "How about it guys?"
"Hi." The little blond stared up at him and pointed toward the couch. "You gotta be careful-er, Hawwy. Da floor in da sitt-in womb is lava."
Harry grinned as his husband stood to shake Kingsley’s hand. He was proud of the way Draco’s confidence had grown over the last two years.
“Let’s go to Honeyduke’s first, Harry.” Draco suggested. “I’ve been craving some Jelly Slugs and I haven’t had a licorice wand in ages.”
“Enough! The Minister is wrapping up his speech! Can we all agree to be pleasant for the press?” Draco asked quickly. “Please, Father; I won’t have you badmouthing my spouse.”
“Please tell me, Draco?” Harry hurried to assure the blond. “I won’t judge you! I swear!”
"We can go to Loch Ness on my birthday, stay for a couple of weeks and then use the London townhouse to get to the train on September first." Harry grinned. "Let's eat so we can start shopping after a quick stop at our room, Dudley."
“We know our darling Draco is pregnant again!” The flirtatious great aunt called out.
Before the night was over, Blaise had graciously invited Pansy to join them in April so everyone had plans for the next week of holiday.
The morning after his birthday, Harry woke to find Draco entertaining the three toddlers in the sitting area of their bedroom. The blond was reading to them from an old book and didn’t see Harry right away.
Harry handed out the life jackets as the twins pulled in the gangplank and waved to Mac as the enchantments began to awaken. He felt something in the back of his mind click and, as the oars lifted, he was able to calm his friends. "The boat knows where we're going."
Harry shook his head but his nervous energy drained slightly. “I’m not sure...I had a dream ...a disturbing dream.” He ran his hands through his hair. “Are dreams reliable? Am I developing The Sight? Is that even possible?”
The elves delivered a simple meal for each member of the family as well as their guest. After the meal, Draco and his parents left the room to wait for their other guests while Harry remained to get a rundown of his executorial duties.
18 - Hug
Harry frowned. "I don't understand."
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
Draco followed the other two men and allowed himself to relax in the company of his new friends. He blushed when Harry held the door open for him and again when the brunette helped him with his chair.
Dudley huffed. His frustration was getting the better of him for a moment. "Do you have to call me that?"
Madam Pomphrey caught up with Harry and Draco quickly and informed them of the things Draco would need for the length of his pregnancy. "There are vitamin potions and stomach calming draughts. He'll start the morning sickness soon if he gets it at all. Most men are lucky enough to escape that part of pregnancy while almost all women must endure it."
"Harry!" Dudley called out from down the hall. "I didn't have the chance to give you this when we got here."
Draco was very subdued as he walked into the town with Harry, who took him over to the jewelry store where they’d gotten their wedding bands.
"Yes. That was before." A ghostly voice sounded before its owner entered the room.
“You want to start with the whiskey or the vodka?” Draco smirked at the other man.
“Yes.” Draco nodded grimly. “And he wasn’t happy.”
"Many, sir." Roody answered with a strange twinkle in his eyes.
Harry's hand was cramping by the time he finished affixing his seal to the last form.
Ron snorted in amusement. "Well, I thought they'd make you get married first and we would be next – and so on."
Potions Master Loveday had come to visit and talk several times since they’d left Hogwarts. Harry asked the man’s help in adding to the list for Draco’s apothecary. The older man was also able to get the brunette in contact with his friend who taught at the nearest Wizarding University. Windyvale University was the closest one to Kent with a correspondence course in business. Only once Harry had passed this course would he be allowed to take the one offered by the ministry, so he planned to take it seriously.
“It is the name that connects you to us, Harry – and us to you. The name and the blood of your and Draco’s children form a bond of unspeakable power! Pure-bloods treasure that! We protect it with all that we are – the oldest of us do at any rate!” Lucius ranted. “If children are – in and of themselves – to be cherished and celebrated, then so too are the adult members of the family who married into it and helped to continue that oldest of traditions! Do you understand yet? Each magical life on the family tree is a jewel of the most priceless quality, Harry. If Draco left you, you would be lost to us – so too would he if we attempted to take him from you against his will. We would then be lost entirely because we would lose our future.”
“It never bothered James when I had a boyfriend...but at the time I was just Uncle Draco.” The blond’s lips curved slightly. “But I wouldn’t worry about Albus. He’ll be more understanding than you think."
Draco kissed Harry on the cheek before asking for it well done but sliced thin on a roll with chunky Bleu cheese dressing.
"Did you tell them that a lust potion wasn't necessary in the first place and that the next time they get a male pregnancy potion for us, they should get a basic one?" Harry asked wryly.
“Draco…” Blaise frowned at his friend. “Not much could affect you like this.”
The blond shrugged. “It’s ok. We can do that later. Can we eat before we go? I’m starving.”
Draco nodded and closed his eyes as he reached for the rose Harry had conjured. He felt Harry’s hand brush his as he took the one Draco held.
Both women stared. Neither had been told.
Harry turned Draco around, pulled up his trousers and cupped his pale, wet face. “I’m sorry this punishment was necessary…but I’m not sorry for executing it. I love you and our children love you. We need you to keep your strength up and we need to be able to trust you. Understand?”
"Ziva will be right back, Master Harry!" She said before popping out of the room.
Dobby's eyes filled with tears again. "Winky would be so happy as a bonded elf again... but Dobby would be lonely at Hoggy-warts without her. Winky is being like a sibling!"
"The hallway is just past the vase. There's a bathroom, and the next two doors are the dorm style rooms." Harry directed them wondering why Zack was allowing him time alone with the others. "After them comes the guest room on the opposite side of the hall, then the owlry and my room."
"I slipped a note to that cute new barista at the coffee shop..." She said carefully. "I gave him my number..."
“From there you can decide whether or not to allow divorces.” Hermione nodded absently. “To help that along I think you should arrange to have a census of sorts to ascertain which couples are happy and which aren’t.”
The brunette looked his husband over carefully. He felt the leash of control he had around the blond as a tangible thing. “You’re so beautiful…my Dragon…”
Harry wrapped his arms around his fiancé. “I’ll hold you to that.” Their lips met softly.
“Well, if I ever got pregnant, I’d hope to be one of that 9.8% too.” Ron grinned.
“Good.” She nodded. “That makes things easier. So, I heard you talking to Ron on the train back in June. You said something about a girl in my year with pale blonde hair.”
Percy nodded. "Dad insisted on a powerful one. If I reveal even the most minor detail of what was told to me yesterday, it will place a tongue tying hex on me which can only be undone by the caster."
Draco picked up the kettle while catching his breath and poured the water for tea as Harry got himself under control. “She’ll need another mug, Harry.”
Smiling to himself, Draco changed into his newest bathing suit before heading to the kitchen. He took the water pitcher and two glasses with him into the bathroom and cast a cooling charm to keep it chilled.
“Yes, of course I remember...I just...” Harry began.
“It was worth the momentary worry…” Harry grinned up at his husband. “But next time… please send an elf.”
"Interesting!" Remus smiled.
The tug at his navel was strong and the whole group landed on the lawn of a beautiful manor house. Harry stood and looked around. In one direction the tree-lined driveway extended to a large wrought iron gate. A lovely fountain sat on an island in the center of the circular drive but on second glance the drive was not circular at all... it was shaped like a rather large capital letter P.
Harry’s eyes held onto Draco’s as the blond slid all the way back down. The emotions Harry saw in those grey orbs told him that Draco was very excited by this experience. “Again…and faster this time.”
Ron’s eyebrows went up as he also caught on.
Harry snorted softly at the difference and lightly squeezed the blond’s hand to give him support.
Your father-in-law,
“Oh?” Narcissa jumped on his proclamation.
Marcus suddenly peeked out of the bedroom. “Is she here yet?”
Tom nodded. "I was under the impression you didn't know what they were."
"Yeah..." Ron stood awkwardly. "I need to finish my erm charms essay."
Draco gulped audibly as he approached the large bed and ran his hands up and down one of the posts before waving his wand to lock the door and silence the room; it’d become a habit. He turned to face Harry as he stripped down to his skin and climbed up to lay in the middle of the mattress.
Harry chuckled and motioned for Draco to do the honors.
The last new student went to Hufflepuff and everyone looked to Dumbledore to signal the elves but he sat silently for a moment longer to allow Professor Mcgonagall time to move the hat and stool behind the podium.
“We think he’ll have your eyes, Mother,” Draco was saying softly looking down into the bassinet that held a happily burbling Caelum.
"What if the customer was a squib?" Harry asked, glancing at his cousin.
Still dazed from those coffee flavored kisses, Harry turned with his boyfriend to face Narcissa Malfoy.
“Yeah, but how can I run something as big as the Malfoy estates and businesses when I was only taught to follow my father’s orders?” Draco frowned nervously.
"Perhaps you need to test him?" Sirius suggested. "Or get an oath of loyalty?"
If you're gay, here's his number.
“He’s amazing, Harry,” Draco whispered softly as he counted the baby’s fingers. When he finished, he pulled off the baby’s soft white socks and counted his toes. “He’s beautiful. Where’s Lyra?”
"WHAT?" Hermione and Ron yelled at once.
“Animagi.” Harry finished when he’d turned back.
Harry smirked at the blond nodding silently as they took two seats at the round table that was situated to the right of the door. The food appeared as it always did and they ate quietly. The mark on Draco's neck was remarked upon during their time at the breakfast table and Harry was late to his second class because Draco had dragged him into an empty classroom for yet another bout of marital relations. He was beginning to worry but then they got a response from Draco's parents during lunch. The Malfoy owl landed proudly in front of Harry, showing that he knew who was in charge of this marriage.
The group went on to Diagon Alley where they ate lunch at the Leaky Cauldron. When they were through, Pansy was too tired to join them for the rest of the afternoon so she flooed back to the townhouse while Harry escorted Draco to Madam Malkin’s. Harry happily watched Draco try on clothes and got measured again himself.
Fred took up where his brother left off. "And can't pay his debts."
"Hmmm." Harry smiled at Draco's blush, having misunderstood. "I'll have to see if my library has a Japanese dictionary.  Maybe I can find a name that compliments that one."
"I'll write to mum to get two and you can give me the money later." Draco smirked when Harry agreed and they leisurely walked down to Zonko's joke shop.
Harry beamed. “I’ll see to it, personally.”
Draco bit his lip and gave in. He let Harry guide him into position after watching as the brunette set a Notice-Me-Not charm as well as a silencing charm.
“Andy already left but I hate to leave you…” Harry hated leaving without knowing Draco was right behind him but supper at the Weasleys wouldn’t wait. “Alright, don’t be long, love…Lyra – be good for Daddy.”
"And we don't mean our little brother." Fred dropped the tone of his voice to the point of a growl. “Or the squib that ran away from home.”
Victor Krum, his old acquaintance from the Tri-Wizard Tournament had been seen attending a museum opening with none other than Harry’s old rival from school – Draco Malfoy. The blond – if it was possible – had gotten more beautiful than ever and was now frequently being seen on the arm of the Quidditch star.
"Thank you, Harry." Lucius said quietly. "Thank you for letting us be part of this. You both have access to this room if you need it." He took a breath and walked away quickly.
L******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
Luna was on the floor with her head in the fire. "Yes, Uncle Luc. He'll be here soon."
"May I ask what that's going to be like?" The brunette asked gently.
Ok, so here it is:
“They want us to have another baby, Harry.” Hermione frowned. “They expect me to become pregnant by July.”
"Hmm..." Harry had to admit it made sense. "I am curious as to other aspects of life. Are you planning to act as the usual absurdly superior git? Will you associate with the same people? Are you willing to hold civil conversations with me in public?"
Harry looked at her with new interest. "And she runs a school for them?"
Draco considered this for a moment. If he was agreeing to be courted by Harry, they should indeed use each other's first names. Did Harry actually think he could be what Draco wanted... needed? He also recalled comparing his love affairs with the altercations he'd had with Harry and how he had passion with him.
Ginny snorted. “That sounds like her alright.”
"This is no joking matter, Father!" Draco huffed, and sent a pouting glare at the older man. "I'm not a normal fifteen year old boy! There are things about my life he might not be able to handle!"
Feeling strangely bereft, Harry took himself into the next room to speak with Ginny and Luna.
Dudley looked at him and took as deep a breath as he could before taking off at a flat out run. He'd never done what Harry told him before but he could see how grim his cousin's expression was. He'd never seen Harry this way and knew that this was what the magical world saw in him.
Draco stared down at his unfinished food as Harry began to step away from his chair.
"It doesn't look all that different, Lucius." Harry felt cold.
“The mother dragons last year.” Harry stared at the young blond.
Luna’s soft voice called out inviting them into the birthing room. “I think you’ll all be more comfortable for this conversation on the sofas in here. Honestly, Blaise – where are your manners?”
“No, really; tell me.” The blonde commanded.
“We’ll just have to accept a half-blood into the family if we want him to continue the family name. Oh, no; he’ll have to forego the traditions!” She whispered as her hand flew up to cover her mouth. “My baby boy won’t have a traditional courting!”
Petunia reached out toward her son. "Dudlikins, come with mummy. I'll fix you up...make you something to eat while dad and Harry talk. Yes?"
Harry’s gaze turned predatory and he adopted a smirk. “You look so beautiful, lying there, Dray…” He licked his lips and moved to stand at the foot of the bed. Draco’s legs were slightly spread so Harry had a good view of his body. “Take your cock in your hands…I want to watch you touch yourself, Dragon.”
"Dobby is finding you on the floor, Mister Malfoy. Merlin's book is deciding it is time to communicate with you. Please to be listening to it?" With that, Dobby disappeared.
Bold + italics = parseltongue
Percy stared at him.
“It’s alright, Harry. We’ll say it however many times they need to hear it.” Draco assured him.
His father caught him with a knowing stare and one stately eyebrow rose in challenge.
"You did very well today, Draco." She said softly. "I am proud of the way you ran that meeting."
“Nope…” Harry smirked.
Harry lifted Draco’s balls and slipped his cock into his husband. “God, Dray! I love how you feel around me!”
“Well, the tamest one is romance,” Draco shrugged. “You love to carry me off to the bed and kiss me sweetly while we …you know. Some people just grope and fuck – no romance, no kisses. We’re not saying that kinks are bad, Harry. They’re just things you like.”
“No!” Draco started frantically shaking his head. “No...Harry don’t leave. You weren’t hurting me! Please - just don’t leave a bite mark.”
The Minister walked in just then and saw the purple cloud. "Talk about working fast, Harry! You and Draco are the first parents of all the couples that married in the last month. Not only that, but you have two babies on the way! Congratulations, my young friends!"
"Your parents have called you worse than that. Dudders. Diddykins. What's wrong with Dud?" Harry asked scrunching his face to show his confusion.
“For?” Lucius asked softly, sounding dangerous.
“Yes, Narcissa – we’ve been discussing it, but we got distracted and somewhere along the line, Draco pointed out that my last name would be different from his and our children’s last name…” Harry paused. “I realized that I wanted a more unified family than that.”
"And the witness did nothing to stop them? I suppose that's not a crime in itself." Draco gritted his teeth.
Voldemort glared at the snake who had just poked her head out from under the couch to join them.
“He just wants to be sure you’re safe, Dragon.” Narcissa stepped to her son’s side and took his hand.
“Y-yes.” Draco nodded thanking the gods that the room was lit poorly. “Luna.”
Harry's distant cousin had said.
The headmistress stood at the faculty table to address the confused students. "Ladies and Gentlemen! I'd like your attention, please?"
“I took a few moments to speak with the boy, Harry.” Lucius chose his words with care as he watched the younger man. “He told me to some extent what you said after Andromeda died – that he didn’t have to worry and he had many people looking out for him and that we all love him. I applaud your approach to things of this nature as I unfortunately have no finesse with young children. When my father fell ill and died I was brutally honest with my son.”
“I’ve had a feeling about that for a while now.” Harry snorted. “With all the control he exerted over you, if we became friends, you would’ve known where I lived and how to get to me whenever Voldemort wanted – wards be damned. I might’ve even come for visits to the Manor if we were friends.”
Draco shook his head. "At least it's safe for now."
This letter is to inform you that your marriage to Mr. Draconis Lucien Malfoy-Potter has officially passed through the Ministry inquiry. All testimonies and arguments have been heard and the Ministry officially ratifies your marriage as a stable and loving home for all involved. Congratulations and enjoy your life together.
“And you, young man…” Abraxas nodded and relaxed into his chair.
"He is part of the hat's prophecy." Draco confirmed. "The lost son."
"Harry?" Draco's voice sounded sleepy but content.
Madam Malkin pushed him into his dressing room and while he cast locking and hardening spells on the curtain, she hurried into her back room through a hidden door in the mirrored wall.
The blond glared at his husband. “You’ve made him a Gryffindor!”
Harry approached the strange collection of metal pieces that resembled an oval shaped gazebo. He laid out on the floor and was startled as he began to float.
Harry smiled but remained silent as he walked in to this sight still holding the newly cleaned cock-cage.
"The sight runs in my father's family." Luna blushed with a giggle. "My cousin sees people's animagus forms. I got a different form of it that affects my memory. I remember every moment of my life."
That drew a tight smile from Harry but he answered amiably. “Not the worst I’ve ever had but also not the best.”
Draco whimpered as Harry began to pound his hips against the desk. He moaned with every stroke and tightened his anus once in a while to keep Harry guessing. Soon enough Harry gave up his teasing thrusts and pulled Draco up against his chest. He licked the light bruise at the juncture of Draco’s neck and shoulder, “It seems I haven’t marked you in a while…”
"You swore a secrecy oath?" Harry asked.
“Kit.” Teddy bounced again as he searched for the correct picture. The cat was grey with black markings that could almost be glasses. It meowed instantly at his touch, making him giggle again.
Harry registered the words and this time when he pulled out he let only the head stay inside before thrusting all the way back into Draco. And this time he reached the promised land, causing Draco to give a keening cry and wrap his legs tightly around his lover. “So good. Oh gods, yes!” He cried scratching at Harry’s back.
"'Classmates'." Harry said softly with wide eyes. "I was going to say 'classmates'."
"Since you haven't any siblings, you can invite your closest school aged relatives to live with you in the suite if you wish. If there are four or more occupants, the school will assign a second elf." When Harry grinned, she made sure to point out that only blood relatives or future spouses were allowed to live there - not just good friends.
“Coin?” Pansy asked Blaise in a whisper.
“Full disclosure on both sides?” Lucius asked, a little surprised.
Draco mopped his tears away with a handkerchief but nodded to Harry, “Yes, Harry. I’m sorry.”
“It’s just a replica.” Draco smirked. “I’d like replicas of Diggory’s and Delacour’s dragons as well but Viktor’s family has business connections with mine so Father simply asked.”
Ziva smiled at the older woman. "Miss Molly is staying in biggest bedroom on third floor and thanks to casserole, dinner will be served soon."
“She also told us that she’d just found out she’s pregnant.” Luna said sadly.
“And then…?” Teddy waited to see what Draco would say about the catastrophic tumble.
Lucius gaped at his son-in-law’s veiled threat.
“Amazing!” Harry leaned in to see. “The twins’ eyes didn’t even change this quickly.”
"How do I do it Molly? How do I explain to him that his grandmother doesn't know him? H-How do I help him move on?" Harry began to cry. "I'm his godfather. I'm supposed to be able to help him with things like this."
“What part of ‘I am the submissive spouse’ do you not get, Harry?” Draco smirked. “When I said my vows, I promised to obey you... Whatever you want, just ask it.”
Draco pouted and glared at his husband. “You withstood it. Through the whole day, I was trying to tease you and make you break my punishment and it didn’t work!”
Harry's eyes widened. "What does that mean?"
"Thanks." Harry smiled and went to the drink table. He ordered two full champagne flutes and a pitcher of pumpkin juice for his table. He carried the champagne and the pitcher appeared on the table when he got to it. After handing Draco his champagne, he waved Dean and Ron off to the side. "It's all set, guys. We three couples will be discreetly tested with the spells that detect consummation. All we have to do is dance in front of the Headmistress' table in just under ten minutes."
Draco smiled through his tears and then hurried to summon their cloaks.
"Oh, shut up, Harry. It's not my fault I'm having cravings." Draco pouted. "And any mood swings I get won't be my fault either...They're yours."
Draco nodded with peaceful silence as he cuddled Lyra close before turning to watch Harry give the vial to Dinki.
Harry flipped through with a frustrated frown and tried to put it back on the shelf. "I can't read it."
“Move, Harry. I need you to move inside me.” Draco gasped as his wish was granted.
“I know, Molly...I just suddenly feel lost. I heard you and Arthur talking to Ron yesterday before his wedding and it hit me this morning when I woke up that I didn’t have that. I didn’t have anyone to tease me about making sure I knew what to do when it came to being...” Harry blushed. “Intimate... and such. Not that I don’t know...I mean I do! It’s just that I could picture Sirius or Remus joking around about it and I could almost imagine my parents being flustered as they said those well-meaning things that would embarrass all of us but still make me feel they cared.”
Harry grinned and took a take-away box from the counter. "Yes, and a sweet treat from Bella Vita."
“Yes!” Voldemort cried. “Old Horace used to throw wonderfully intimate gatherings for his favorite students! Don’t tell me that he’s stopped!”
“I asked if he was going to make the sketched owl a little darker so everyone would be able to see it and he shook his head. ‘It’s a ghost owl Uncle Luc,’ he said. ‘It’s haunting Uncle Harry.’” Lucius whispered the last and couldn’t hide how affected he had been by Teddy’s words.
Seconds later the elf was beside him with his daughter in her arms. “Little Mistress be clean, dry and not hungry. So, Dinki be thinking that Little Mistress is being jealous that Little Master has more time with their Papa, Master Harry.”
“Dobby was always telling Dinki of the punishments Dobby was given, sir.” Dinki looked up at Harry balefully as she snapped her fingers to rid the clothes of wrinkles. “Mistress Cissy was never punishing Dinki like that when Dinki was caring for Master Draco and when Master Draco wasn’t needing care, Dinki just helped in the kitchen. Master had no reason for dealings with Dinki.”
“I don’t want to fly without you next to me, Dragon,” Harry whispered, kissing Draco’s hand.
Harry nodded and called for Kreacher. When the elf appeared, Harry looked at his guest. “What would you like, Draco?”
Ginny nodded and her eyes widened as her protective side came out. "I'll be ready by tonight."
Draco was allowed to join Harry in the room as he followed through with the procedure. He grinned as he watched Harry change and then spread his wings while Susan walked around him in a tight circle. She took detailed notes as well as a picture when she passed each angle of view and it didn’t take long before Harry and Draco were walking out of the ministry building.
Please note that this chapter overlaps a bit with last chapter.
Narcissa turned a disapproving stare upon her offspring. “Dinki, bring me a small serving of treacle tart from last evening’s meal.” Within seconds, she held a small dish of Harry’s favorite dessert. She cast a light warming spell and placed the dish on Harry’s nightstand.
"Look, Draco..." Dean hesitated but then soldiered on. "I've seen that girl in here before and, if the friend is the guy I'm thinking of, he might be your type."
“This looks like bits of chicken eggs.” Pansy whispered, quickly becoming grossed out.
Harry nodded slowly as he processed this information. "And now?"
“And I insisted on trying again before casting the spell.” Narcissa’s voice took on an apologetic tone. “You can both go back to sleep after we see what the spell finds.”
“You have another gift, you know.” Draco interjected a little while later.
On top of the bookshelf sat a full team of miniature quidditch players. A signed and framed poster from the 1933 Chudley Cannons now hung on the wall above the bed. The lamp had an orange colored shade with the team's logo. An orange logo rug sat in front of the couch and several pennants were arranged around the bright orange, framed uniform on the wall opposite the poster.
“Dinki took him for a nappy change just before you landed, love.” Harry smiled. “He’ll be with the others by now.”
“I was alone…All alone,” Draco whimpered. “Somehow I knew the twins were safe but they weren’t anywhere in sight or anyplace I could think of…”
Harry turned around and stared as his glass of water began to swell and overflow causing Draco to panic and stand only to slip on the ice that had formed beneath his feet.
"Ginny, too Harry... Please?" Hermione whispered blushing.
She smirked and put her teacup down as she walked to the door. “I’ll see you at dinner Draco.”
“We could put on the wizarding wireless and drink every time they say your last name…” Draco chuckled at Harry’s glare. “We could play ‘never have I ever’…”
“Not at all – really. It’s nice to hear that he cared because he wasn’t one to openly show emotion,” Draco gave the other man a half smile.
The weekend came quickly and soon enough Harry was welcoming the guests to their party. He smiled at Greg Goyle as the other man escorted his older daughter to the designated children’s area while Parvati brought their two month old to sit beside Hermione and Hugo at a nearby table with Charlie and Gus who had little Edgar in a pram beside them.
"Then, it's over unless it happens again...at which point, you have free reign." Harry told her matter of factly. When Zack's eyes widened, Harry smirked. "Just part of what you face unless you follow the advice I gave you last night."
"Master Harry?"
“I promise.” Harry nodded before turning to his cousins. “I need something from my room, girls. I’ll only be a moment.” When he returned to the sitting room with his communication mirror, the headmaster was gone. He put the mirror on the desk and spoke to the girls. “I haven’t had a chance to talk to you but I found something last night in the Hufflepuff common room. Ginny, you tell the twins. I’ll talk to Ron and Zack...family meeting. Tonight.”
"Good. Now remember - we can't let on that I've been there before." Harry murmured as he picked up his things.
"He did call, actually." Michelle whispered, her lashes stuck together with tears. "It wasn't until he called that I thought maybe I shouldn't have done it."
“I so wanted a taste of your cock, sweet dragon, but if I do that, you won’t last long...so it’ll have to wait for another time.” Harry whispered as he undressed the rest of the way.
He slipped the confusing letter into his rucksack along with the letter from Gringotts and pulled a set of robes out of his trunk along with a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. His trainers were on his feet and the socks he was wearing were clean when he put them on that morning. He rushed to seal his trunk with magic and threw his clothes into his rucksack. Then he remembered that his homework hadn't been completed and decided to simply shrink the trunk rather than send it to Ron. A swish of his wand had the trunk small enough to put in his pocket and one more swish did the same with Dudley's duffle bag. Freeing up both their hands, just in case. Hedwig was nowhere in sight so she must've been out hunting. So he shrunk the cage and added it to his rucksack.
It took several days of nearly constant cramping, but the birth canal was fully formed and functional by the twenty-sixth. All they could do at that point was wait to see when Draco would be ready for the surgery because he’d told Harry that he didn’t want to try squeezing two small watermelons out of a hole the size of a lemon. During the waiting period, which was only around six hours, Harry was very disappointed to find that wizarding tradition didn’t allow the father of the children into the birthing room.
"How can you be sure he's telling the truth, Harry?" Sirius asked, frowning with worry.
"I promise, Molly." Harry shook his head.
"Just look at the list, Mr. Malfoy-Potter," the squib said.
Narcissa joined him a moment later. “The Healer told us – I hope you don’t mind.”
“You! You were the one who kissed her that day!” Reg Cattermole stared at Ron wide-eyed.
Harry’s green eyes sparkled as the words sounded in his ears. “That’s better. Friends shouldn’t use last names.” Harry smiled at the other man. “How’ve you been? How are things with Viktor?”
Harry ate his portion quickly and excused himself to 'take care of a few things'. Dealing with the stubborn redhead was so difficult lately. As he climbed the stairs, he realized that he and Ron needed to have another difficult conversation soon. He'd never told Ron outright that he was gay. It also wasn't something he planned to advertise...unless he found someone he wanted to date. Harry sighed as he reached his bedroom and wondered if they'd ever get their friendship back on track.
“That was wonderful!” Harry told them. “You know what? It works for Daddy too. Ask Daddy to come here.”
Draco bit his lip nervously but agreed with a nod.
Draco let out a low snicker and Teddy shrugged with a high pitched giggle.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Here look at this, Draco."
Marcus turned to Draco. “What didn’t she tell me?”
Harry's eyes snapped over to his cousin's face and then over to where he was pointing.
Lucius looked at his son and niece with a sigh. “This is why you set the meeting time so early.”
Draco – on the other hand – concentrated on Harry’s voice. He responded to each and every insult and comment.
Harry sighed happily. “What he doesn’t seem to realize is that I’ve gently coaxed him to make many important decisions. His behavior is where I get my directions from.”
Draco frowned as he worked out Harry's logic. "I think I see where you're going with this."
“You, Master! I’m yours!”  Draco shouted as Harry licked a spot on his throat.
A red burst of light hit Cedric in his chest and he went down like a rock. Harry started to groan as he tried to pull his classmate behind a gravestone but it turned into a wince as a sharp rock scraped his arm and he barely had time to catch the Hufflepuff's head before the urge to press his hand against his scar hit Harry hard. He put his back flush against the stone behind him and tried to catch his breath when he heard it.
Harry cleaned the blond’s hand with another charm before allowing Draco to straddle his hips. Harry took hold of his cock and kept it steady as Draco sank onto it.
Her eyebrow lifted but she accepted the correction. "Very well, Mr. Malfoy-Potter...Rumors have spread far beyond the walls of Hogwarts as to why you and Harry disappeared for the last week."
"I can make one set of clothes for each of you now but the rest won't be ready before tomorrow afternoon." Madam Malkin offered. "Is there an address I can send them to?"
When the harpist started to pack her things, Harry squeezed his husband’s hand before making his way to her side. He asked the woman to stay for just one more song and if she could play a nice soft tune. Then, he looked around and saw his mother-in-law speaking with the Minister’s wife. He also noticed that Lucius was looking curiously at him but paid the older man no mind as he made his way to Narcissa’s side.
Draco shivered in pleasure. “I think I can handle that, love.”
The awed expression on his cousin's face was mildly amusing to Harry but he tried not to let it show as he turned around to dress.
Draco’s eyes widened in fear and he burrowed his face into Harry’s chest. “I-I didn’t even notice but now…” His breathing and heartbeat sped up slightly which Harry caught instantly.
“Yes?” Harry’s voice was muffled but still understandable as he kissed Draco’s palm before licking it.
"Tells me about what?" Harry asked, confused.
He and Draco had gotten home hours ago so they could settle the children before the Minister arrived. The floo flashed green and Harry could hear Kreacher’s voice as he greeted their guest.
“It’s gorgeous…” Harry whispered as he took in the decadent sight. “I can picture you there…on that huge bed…naked and waiting for me…”
Draco stared at him, unsure if he should be awed or scared. This powerful man wanted to be his friend so he honestly didn't want to be either. Then he realized the possibilities if Harry were bent to the different sides of the conflict. "We have to be incredibly careful about this information, Potter."
A glance at the head table showed several things that he would need to mention to his boyfriend...or perhaps he should call him his mate? He made a mental note to talk about it with the boy in question later. For the moment, Professor Slughorn looked a little too interested in Harry’s activities but then, other staff members seemed interested too.
Draco said nothing but pocketed the letter and left the common room.
“Remus is on it. He’ll find a good tutor for our purposes.” Harry reported.
Harry nodded. “I’m sure Andy was thorough with her instructions.”
Having just left the university library after being there for almost eight hours, Harry was completely drained of energy. He agreed enthusiastically with his friend when she tugged on his arm to pull him into the usual coffee shop.
"Is there anything else we need to know, Madam?" Draco asked.
"Yes." Draco warmed to the subject. "If I want to go out with my friends, I expect you to either find something to do with your own friends or go with me or have a really good reason for me to not go...and vice versa."
“Sorry, Harry,” Ron winced as Caelum began to fuss. “We got a letter from the ministry and we wondered if you did too.”
Madam Pomphrey had informed all of the men and women who were carrying twins that they needed two appointments per month and Draco's was on the fourteenth. So, before classes began, Harry made sure to have his husband awake, fed, and at the Hospital Wing doors directly on time at 8:30 AM.
"There's always tomorrow!" George finished.
"Whereas I strutted in assuming you'd grown up like I did and since muggles had raised you, you'd need help making contacts and networking among wizard-kind the way my father had taught me from a young age. I sought to make you feel indebted to me which would..." Draco muttered softly.
“Family history is very interesting, Harry, but could we have the short version?” Draco smirked.
Draco's heart fluttered at the sound in his husband's voice.
"I asked Korlag if I was betrothed." Harry replied. "Apparently, my mum and dad didn't believe in it and Dumbledore hadn't thought about it yet."
Draco came out from the bedroom to greet him. “I was just about to relax with a book, Harry. How was breakfast?”
Olgok brought a large mug over and handed it to Harry. "This is the first dose, Mr. Potter. The next dose will be given in a few minutes. Bottoms up!"
"Now, how would I know something like that?" Lucius allowed his eyebrows to rise.
"Do we need to send for supplies?" Harry asked as the elf allowed them entry. He let the rest of his party go in first.
Narcissa frowned. “I don’t quite understand, sweetie.”
Harry remained silent as his best friend struggled to find words to explain why he didn't intend to move in.
The holiday continued with little difference to the last two years. Having switched off with the Weasley family last year, this Christmas Day was spent with Draco’s parents, Teddy and Andromeda. The children had received many toys and Draco was happy to see a voucher to the apothecary in Diagon Alley for potions ingredients. Harry’s favorite gift…besides Draco’s pregnancy…was from Lucius and Narcissa. It was a portrait of Abraxas Malfoy for their home.
“Yes…I’m now Harry James Malfoy-Potter…and we’ll discuss baby names another time.” He smirked shyly.
Draco only stared in shock as Harry's eyes closed and he began to snore lightly. It was several hours later that he finally got some sleep.
Draco nodded cautiously as he sat down. "I suppose I can listen to a story."
Harry nodded and stood. The walk wasn’t long but it calmed him. The training room had dummies set up with fake wands and they looked mildly threatening. He didn’t even give his friend and partner a chance to take aim. He fired off so many hexes and curses that Ron just ducked behind a bookcase and rode out the storm of Harry’s temper. Some of them were nasty ones, like the Sectumsempra curse and others were simple but still deadly like Bombarda. Some were even juvenile like Ginny’s Bat-Bogey Hex. Ron didn’t see Harry get this way very often or over something petty and it was never anything good that came of it. When Harry fell silent, Ron peeked around the corner to see Harry kneeling on the ground surrounded by bits and pieces of debris.
"One problem at a time, Draco.” Draco murmured to himself as he entered his bedroom. “First thing to tackle is helping Harry. How do I help Harry?" He sat at his desk and pulled two sheets of parchment from the drawer. Then he wrote a title at the top of each one and began to think.
“Kreacher, you are not a bad elf! Now, Draco and I are going to Hogwarts and you are going to accompany us.” The brunette paused. “One of the reasons you were chosen is because we are very happy with your service. The other reason is that Dooley and Dinki also believe you can handle this duty.” Harry had no humor in his voice. “The Malfoy elves have already packed so that’s one less thing you need to do.”
“I believe your presence may frighten him, Lucius,” Harry said frankly. “If it does, fear will override arousal and cause him to stay soft.”
Draco sighed. "Harry and I have already discussed this, Father. We won't be dissolving this marriage no matter what the Ministry decides."
The barn owl called to him again and as it turned to take flight, Harry noticed that there was something on the nightstand – an envelope. Stepping closer, he saw a list of names and as Harry took the envelope into his hands he heard another owl call which caused him to run to the window.
“Harry...can we just go home now?” Draco asked softly.
"No. I think these elves would be like you and not have much contact with Dumbles." Harry told him. "Is the other group in Hufflepuff house?"
Harry looked down into Draco's silver grey eyes and knew what he meant as their lips met.
"Good." Harry nodded to himself. "I'll tell Remus to step up the search for an occlumency tutor. Now let's get to dinner."
Draco didn’t answer with words but his smirk said it all.
"No. I wouldn't." Snape stood his ground. "I would not even do that to you."
"Yes, Harry – you've mentioned it several times today." Draco was nervously picking at his clothes. "Are you sure I look alright? This robe doesn't make me look fat; does it?"
"We'll sleep on it, mate." George had a determined look on his face while Fred only nodded in agreement.
Across the room, stood his bookcase. He concentrated on a random book and pulled with a surge of magic. This resulted in the entire contents of the shelf jumping toward him and falling haphazardly on the floor. Harry huffed in frustration.
“Can I have him arrested now?” Harry asked gently. “Have you had enough?”
"At the time, the interests of one female squib wouldn't have mattered to wizardkind, Mr. Dursley." Headmistress Prewitt told him regretfully. "There was even precedent among the pureblood families, during that era, to abandon or kill a squib if one appeared to 'taint' the bloodline."
Harry sighed. "Ziva?"
Draco glanced at Harry. “No, Blaise; far from it… Where did you get that story from?”
