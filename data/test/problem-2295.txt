Malfoy muttered under his breath about strange little boys who enjoyed broccoli but Harry didn't catch it, as his entire world had turned on it's axis and plunged into fiery rage. How dare he? Who the fuck does Malfoy think he is, letting Teddy call him that? His real father is buried under the earth after giving his life to fight the man that the Malfoy's had fucking hosted in their home. The man Malfoy had served. The man who'd killed his parents. And he taught Teddy to call him "daddy"? Does Teddy actually think Malfoy was his father? Did Malfoy feed Teddy some lark about getting a girl pregnant and then abandoning them? Did Teddy even know about Lupin? About Tonks? About the war that killed them and the medals they got after their deaths? Did he know that the man he thinks is his father helped the people that robbed him of an actual family?
Supper crawled to a close with Teddy patting his belly theatrically and the cat winding between his feet expectantly, having actually succeeded in charming a slice of meat. Draco gathered the dishes and Teddy leapt up, picking up the cutlery where the china would be too heavy.
And the whole Teddy situation felt the same. Too big. Hard to control. There wasn't enough calming draught in the world.
“Hey!” Teddy protested, but he had a distinctly mischievous grin which spoke to zero offense. Malfoy rolled his eyes and playfully kicked Teddy’s chair.
“What do you want.” Malfoy demanded. It was a stark contrast to the shrill tone he’d had before there was a child in his arms.
And just like that Draco's demeanor sharpened, the uncomfortable longing he'd felt and dismissed during his time detained growing until the feeling flared brightly and painfully in his stomach, along with the gut punch of a realization.
Teddy squealed and nodded, apparently too excited to remember his dislike towards him. Malfoy also nodded, a bit disbelieving and exasperated, but nodding.
him was the right word, as Draco didn’t really speak. He simply hummed and dropped an “oh?” here or there to keep his mother talking, but never engaged. And he certainly didn’t talk to Harry.
Teddy fussed at the words, which Malfoy quickly shushed. Harry licked his lips. “I’m not here on auror business.”
Draco’s face twisted up but before he could say anything a hand came down on his. Draco snatched it back.
“Supper will be served soon.” Malfoy muttered, gesturing to the neatly set kitchen table that marked the boundary between the separation of the two rooms.
"But I always put peas in the stew." Malfoy said reasonably, glaring at the sky before snaking his arm back inside and coming back with an umbrella.
“Okay,” Harry said peaceably, carefully modulating his voice in a way that made Draco feel like a child, “okay. We’re not doing that. The only tradition we have to honour is sleeping through the night tied together. That’s it, and it’s all we’re doing.”
feeling rude, and felt a bit competitive over the graciousness he’d been shown by a Malfoy) he noticed Teddy hugging the kitchen door, scrunching his face up as he “eavesdropped” on their conversation.
Harry’s thumb ran over his hand and only good breeding kept Draco from jumping out of his skin. He smiled apologetically and then gestured at their bound hands.
He apparated. He couldn't stay there and even attempt to regain his control, not while Malfoy had his godson's hand in his. Not while they joked about supper. Not while Teddy called him "daddy" like Lupin had never existed.
“Thank you for telling me the truth,” Harry said finally. He cut off any room for a response by blowing out the light, pulling the covers over himself and turning his back to Draco.
Another silence, but this one all the worse considering the leader of the Kingdom he was in was considering whether or not Draco had plotted to murder him. And why shouldn’t he? Draco had been anything but agreeable leading up to this whole thing and now Pansy’s fucking steel had been found stuffed into his trousers.
he’d want with his cooking (and honestly the sheer idea that Malfoy was out there cooking the muggle way was still too senseless to fully process). Maybe he should bring something for Teddy? A toy? What kind of toy would he want, but not have? Malfoy seemed like the doting type after all. Should he just call Malfoy again? Er, well no that doesn’t sound like a lovely idea. Still, he wanted to bring something.
“I’d damn say so myself,” the seamstress muttered, backing up to take in Draco’s full attire. Draco almost sneered at the woman but collected himself.
Harry desperately wanted to say, but the words tied themselves into knots in his throat. He was. Technically. Maybe literally.
“Look,” Harry said, hands raised in surrender, “I don’t know what’s happening. You have to tell me.”
And, well, this was why Harry couldn’t form an opinion. Malfoy was sitting across from him, haughty and poised and oozing disrespect with every breath. Yet the mere fact he was here, in his home drinking the tea Harry had served and revealing any information Harry asked for meant something.
A thump came from upstairs, and Harry watched as Malfoy carefully cocked his head to listen further.
Draco, for his part, reached for the gift, tightening the binding on Harry’s own wrist. Again, the gift was extravagant and jewel encrusted. Draco pulled the blade from the sheath and took a breath at the pattern the blade sported; spots and swirls of contrasting shades of grey, almost like the knife had been dipped in a stream and left to dry.
The final piece to his outfit was the snow white cape attached at the shoulders with metal links. The cloth was heavy, a testament to the length that the seamstress unfurled behind him. The fabric was delicate, but it felt like it could stretch the whole length of the great hall. Draco hoped it wouldn’t.
The old man in charge of leading the ceremony took the cloth Draco had carried up the aisle and Draco settled in, knowing his part would be much later in the ceremony. Apparently Potter weddings meant one long droning speech about history and the meaning of life. Draco tuned it out.
“No no, it’s okay,” Harry said, scrubbing his eyes, “I think I’m just beginning to see just how much you didn’t want to go through with this.”
Those thoughts persisted through his head for another three months. And then when he tried, genuinely tried to pick himself off, he couldn't. He couldn't make the limbs move. He was trapped.
Malfoy’s eyes flicked up to meet his. “Absolutely eloquent compliment, Potter. You should be a food journalist.”
This specific custom had all been explained to him beforehand of course, but faced with the reality of the next step killed any joy he might have found in his aesthetic.
“I witness the binding,” the old man spoke, “and I declare it true.” At his words Draco and Potter reached out for each other’s hands once more, the small chain of fabric sagging beneath their clasped hands.
upbringing for his godson, even if the circumstances around it continued to leave him distressed and ashamed.
Harry flexed his left hand from where it rested on the table, tied to the pale hand only a few inches away. There was enough slack in the binding for them to each comfortably eat their meals and, well, apparently not talk. Just next to Draco sat his mother, a gesture Harry had hoped would act as a sort of peace offering. Instead, Draco was well and truly facing away from him, letting his mother chat to him about gossip Harry had no interest in.
Harry nodded, his nervous energy from before helping him match Teddy’s excitement. “How did you get him?”
Harry quickly closed the door and locked it, sighing something awfully fierce as he dragged Draco over to a large vanity. With nary a word Harry released his hand, instead busying himself with removing his crown and shaking out the bits of gold from his hair. Draco couldn’t move, feeling rushed and disregarded. His inaction really wasn’t helping any, as Harry had already moved on to the clasp in his boots, not wasting any time.
Teddy pouted, but it was a lot more childish and melodramatic than before and made Draco breathe a sigh of relief.
Marge bit her lip, gently unfolding a scroll and staring down at the pages. "Edward Remus Lupin, aged five months, was surrendered to ministry services by Andromeda Black due to inability to provide care on September third. One week later Edward Lupin was claimed by distant family member-" she paused, raising her head to meet Harry's eyes, "Draco Malfoy."
Immediately Harry backed off, picturing the scene Teddy must be witnessing and letting Malfoy off the door. Malfoy sneered at him, but the tension was back in his shoulders.
war that had taken his parents and his throne away from him was one of the bloodiest and longest wars ever to known history. When Voldemort had killed both King and Queen of the Potter kingdom Harry had just been one year old and stowed away by the stablemaster, ferried across his kingdom to be raised the joined forces of those that would oppose Voldemort’s dominion. Harry had grown into an excellent fighter and, though it pained him to admit his merits, an inspirational leader. Under his command Voldemort fell and his decades long conquest ended. It was thought only natural that Harry would ascend to the throne, but the reality of post-war politics meant that Harry needed to project stability and strength to the people who had lived under Voldemort’s rule. He needed to heed tradition, and he needed another who bore his name.
Hermione pulled away shakily. “Well, if you insist on it…” Harry nodded. “Then you should finish getting ready.”
1. There is no magic in this universe *wink* in the regard that magic is a lost art that no one believes is real yadda yadda usual medieval au stuff
The third time Harry took a look at the muggle home may have been be less intense, less horrified, but no less emotionally engaged. It was darker, sky overcast and angry in a way Harry couldn’t help feel was directed at him. He was here for dinner with his godson for the first time ever.
“Excellent,” she replied, and Harry raised an eyebrow at the boldness. Seeing as he’d already seen close to a hundred gifts today she had to be a lesser noble, the kind of people who typically spoke very carefully when addressing royalty.
An adult laugh sounded next to him and Harry glanced at Malfoy out of the corner of his eye. Maybe the strangest thing about this whole thing is that he expected a fight. He remembered Narcissa, he remembered the first moments of his re-awakening and the tinge of jealousy at her devotion to her child, even if the feeling barely registered in the moment. Even Lucius, though Harry hated to consider him for any extended period of time, was a devoted father. When he’d found out Draco had taken Teddy he’d been out of his mind with what-ifs, but the forefront of his fear had been about Malfoy passing on horrible plureblood shite. He hadn’t been
Harry scowled but waved him on. Receiving wedding gifts was the absolute worst part of this whole affair. Harry had called for a break at least twice already, and the sun was going down. No wonder his court marshal was stressed.
“Teddy’s upstairs.” Malfoy explained, shooting him a dirty look for the language. He then raised his voice to a shout. “I’m sure he’ll be down soon! Like he promised!”
Quick as a snitch Malfoy tried to wrench the door shut in his face, only managing to catch Harry's fingers as he tried to hold the door open. Pain blended with agitation and before he knew it Harry was literally kicking the door open and barging in, vaguely remarking on the beige muggle walls and haphazard pile of shoes on a mat.
Harry coughed. Mustering up some gryffindor courage, he tried to push the discomfort down only to realize his ‘observe Teddy’s homelife unbiasedly’ plan meant he’d failed to realize he had no idea plan to how to act.
Swallowing his pride (something he’d grown accustomed to ever since the marriage was proposed), Draco asked, “What happens next?”
After that exchange the evening was a lot less tense. Yes, it was still an exercise and by the time Harry called it a night he’d felt thoroughly wrung out, but conversation that wasn’t lined with barbs or hostility was a huge win. Instead they spent an hour or so over tea and biscuits (which Malfoy has also made), having a stilted conversation about this and that while Teddy watched. Eventually he got bored and asked to be excused but he remained in the line of sight, pulling out a toy from the bin and fiddling with it on the floor. Teddy’s animosity seemed to have abated towards him (apparently children were fickle), but when he remembered he disliked Harry he made sure to shoot him dirty looks.
Teddy’s records arrived just a few days later, everything from school records from his muggle nursery to vaccinations to chronicled visitations from Melinda. Teddy was apparently an active little boy who plays on a muggle football team (though “team” was a stretch) and had a wide social net of friends whose information Draco also felt the need to give him, along with his class schedule. It was a bit much, but Harry felt…considered. And it certainly felt good to pepper in facts to Teddy’s life.
. Regardless of any impression Malfoy’s muggle home or his interaction with Teddy might have had on him, it was still Malfoy.
Malfoy shrugged. "It was easier for me to walk around with him. I didn't want people accosting me when I was carrying a baby, as you can imagine."
After one of our DADA lessons, Draco was asked to stay behind to discuss the essay he'd handed in, though there wasn't an essay set. I didn't want to leave them together, I wanted to know what Snape was saying, but there'd be no way he was going to let me, and I couldn't stand by the door because he'd probably be able to tell. As I stood by the wall waiting for everyone to leave and Snape to finish jabbing so I could interrogate Draco, Ron walked passed and dropped something at my feet. A set of extendable ears. I didn't thank him, just quickly picked them up and slipped one under the door when Snape slammed it.
Harry turned his attention back to see three people standing behind him. Hagrid had pulled two men out of the air, dressed formally for a footman and driver. It was amazing.
"I'm not. Why the fuck do you think I apologised to Hermione for acting like that in front of her? But the last time you two talked, he punched you. He turned on you, already knowing you were in a dark place, because you were trying to be happy with me and he didn't agree with that. So now he's decided his tantrum is over, and your gonna run back into his arms. He is taking advantage of your weaknesses, and I try and stand up for you but I'm the arsehole. Fine, fuck it, I'll just fucking leave you to it. I'll be the sad fuck, pining for you like a lap dog letting you use me for sex, knowing that you'll never fucking love me back. Because I am that in love with you, all I want is for you to be happy, but I can't even do that."
The alpha laughed, "I've never had the chance to taste it, given I've never needed to. But I'll make a note of it."
Harry shrugged. "She'll get over it, not her first boyfriend. Besides, McLaggen's on the side to keep her company."
A tear fell down Harry’s cheek as he read the letter, and he couldn’t hold back the rest as they fell. Harry scrunched the letter up, and threw it at the bathroom door, just as Draco left it. The paper hit him in the face, and he stood there stunned for a second. Harry turned away, casting a cleaning charm on himself, and heading to his discarded uniform.
Snape wanted to protest, he really did, but he knew how stubborn Harry was, and he actually wanted to be shown some affection. He told Harry his soulmate was Neville Longbottom, and Harry’s bottom jaw hit the floor. He’d noticed Neville staring at Snape before, but he didn’t think his dad’s butt was in his friend’s eye line. Harry agreed to tell Neville and try and admit his feelings to Draco subtly, with harmless touches and little compliments.
He helped me up, and I ended up flush against him, his arms around my waist. He was so warm, and yet his hands were still colder. Was that strange? It certainly felt like a lovely contrast. He told me that my room was in the dungeons, so he'd be able to walk me there as often as possible. If I wanted him to. With everything he did, there'd be a sense of hesitation, like he was stepping on eggshells.
Harry pushed Draco back, his hands squarely on Draco’s chest, moved away from him. Draco just stared at Harry confused, not understanding Harry’s reaction, and asking why Harry was acting like he was. Harry was so confused, he knew how he felt about Draco, but he’d never looked at another man before, and now he was kissing one. He had his back to Draco and felt him come up behind him, putting a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
“No, he got me a potions book, which I think was meant as help,” Harry laughed. “The owl came this morning, from a mysterious sender, but my dad knew who it was by the handwriting. I didn’t think Draco Malfoy was that thoughtful.”
She skipped back up the stairs, turning to start on the right as Harry gaped at her. She was the smartest person he knew, but he didn't understand how it was possible for her to have a suitable suit lying around. She only owned dresses, and Ron certainly didn't have the money to wear frock coats. Even if they pooled their earnings together, they could afford the fabric for a sock. Petunia held the money tightly like that. But she was still the smartest person he knew, so all he could really do was trust her. She'd never been wrong so far.
He’d made peace with Hermione, it wasn’t hard, seeing as we’re so close. But Ron, he still wasn’t happy. Hermione hugged him, and he smiled. She asked what was up, but Harry just shrugged, trying to keep his relationship a secret until Draco was ready. Harry walked over to his table and sat between Draco and Neville.
“Yes Sirius, you’ve already said that about fifty times,” Remus growled. “But Lily sounds certain in Snape’s letter, so please honey, shut up and let him finish.”
"Are you going to still be here when I wake tomorrow?" I found myself asking as we walked through the enchanted door.
He looked confused, and his thumb paused its caress over my hand. He let go looked me dead in the eye, asking if that was the question I wanted to ask. I said nothing. So, he answered.
“He’s supportive, surely he won’t just leave you,” Harry smiled. “And I think Neville will be a great father.”
I blushed, shaking my head vigorously. I hadn't been lied to, my pen pal had been open about being a male in Slytherin like I had been about being a male in Gryffindor. After thinking I fancied him, the guy had even been honest about like girls. But he did admit he thought a few guys were cute, so might be up for exploring it if I wanted. We weren't as desperate as Harry and Draco, so I didn't know it was Blaise until his name changed in my journal. Which meant mine changed in his. I'd locked the journal in my trunk, despite seeing the bookmark glow. I didn't want to know what he said, so I ignored him in favour of eating with my friends. I didn't have Harry's luck, so it was doomed.
A single tear fell from Harry’s eye as he looked at the adorable scene in front of him. 6 months of planning, and now he was the best man to the most beautiful wedding. He wiped the tear away as he passed his father and his friend their rings, and smiled as they recited their vows to one another.
I rubbed the back of my head as I took the book from him, our fingers grazing, and flicked through the book until I got to the right page. Whereas I expected his skin to be warm and clammy like mine in the warm classroom, it was actually quite cold and smooth. Like marble, but softer. I retrieved our ingredients while Malfoy prepared the cauldron, sharing a look of disdain with Ron, who was sat beside Gregory Goyle. That wasn't going to be pleasant. When I got back, Malfoy asked me to start prepping the ingredients, warning that he was going to need to fiddle with the method occasionally.
"I think, you should show me this book. Let's see what fun we can make from it. After all, I have you for the rest of our lives. More than enough time to try it all."
"While I'm sure you'd love to thank me and all, you's better get in that carriage and go. Yer already late."
I left my friends in the doorway and ran before Slughorn came into the room. I didn't know where to look. I guessed the Slytherin dorms, but I wouldn't be able to get in them. It would be a waste of time if he wasn't there. Then it hit me, I could use the Marauder's Map. It would tell me exactly where he was, and I'd know if he was okay because of who he was with. I ran as fast as I could back to my suite.
"Voldemort is in Azkaban. Kept sedated in a special magic-coma, without magic so he's as powerful as a little muggle girl." Ron chuckled as I gasped, "okay I'll explain. Well, Snape had the idea to make the special cell with Dumbledore's wand, because it's the Elder Wand, like the most powerful wand in existence, and knock Voldemort down with this poison inspired by some muggle fairytale about apples.
Hermione chewed her bottom lip, glancing around conspiratorially. This usually meant she knew something that others didn't and she didn't want them to. It immediately sparked Harry's interest. Hermione confided in him that she had a book, though he joked that she had many books. It made her smile, and she explained it wasn't like the stories she read him after nightmares, it was a book about bonding for omegas.
Harry looked down, smiling at the lion crest necklace. It wouldn't just be his memories he could hold on to from this night. And he hoped the prince would keep his ring, a keepsake from a special night. Harry never wanted to take off his necklace. It was beautiful, his long-forgotten family crest and something that connects him to his sweet prince. Besides, if he wore it under his clothes, his relatives would never find out.
"Well, you probably want to know all you can concerning the…You-Know-Who thing, and I want to ask about those cuts. So, who's asking the first question?"
A long finger curled under my chin, turning my head to face him, exposing the huge hickey on the side of my neck. People paying enough attention to notice gasped, and Hermione started fanning herself and whispering to the other girls. He pressed his lips to mine, and I almost melted into them, except he pulled away too soon. I curved my hand to the back of his head, pulling his lips back to mine eagerly. His chuckle rippled through his chest, a sweet sound, and he pulled back with a smirk. He leant down to kiss the love bite on my neck before backing up heading over to his table, holding onto my hand until his arms weren't long enough and it slipped from his grip.
"Even then. I love you, nothing's going to stop that. You've honestly helped me so much with what I've been going through, and I know it's not over, but I know you'll be with me to support me. And I'll support you back. We'll be fine. I haven't got Voldemort to worry about, and I don't know about you but I'll get you through them."
I returned to the dormitory, where my friends waited to see what had been said. They quickly disbanded after I explained he wasn't there. Ron was as pissed as I was over who little effort Malfoy had put into an apology, smaller box and wasn't there.
Ron wasn't taking it seriously at all. He came out of his stall, laughing that he'd already sent a message through to his mysterious pen pal. He hadn't said his name but wrote something stupid about being on a blind date with whoever would answer. Hermione was less than pleased with Ron using the project to pick up a girlfriend. I couldn't be certain whether it was jealousy or her overwhelming need to make us take lessons more seriously. But all her nagging was directed at Ron, so I was kinda happy with the peace. My mind was unsettled enough without her adding to it.
“It’s not your fault, it’s mine,” Harry blushed. “I hadn’t even looked at another guy until I came back to school and saw you.”
“Are you sure you wanna do this?” Draco whispered against his lips, fingers running along Harry's torso and stroking his nipples.
Harry was struck dumb, but Malfoy didn't let him ask questions. One minute he was holding Harry's arm, preventing an escape, and then Harry was alone. This easily could have been a trap or a prank, but Malfoy's tone sounded serious. And he could have something really important to say, detrimental to the war or something. Harry needed to hear him out, a fight was coming and Dumbledore wasn't preparing him, so he needed all the advantages he could get. But first, Hermione needed to be told, so someone would know where he went if it was a trap. Harry had learnt from last years blunder with the Ministry.
Dudley's face contorted with rage, and his hands clenched into fists. I knew that if Uncle Vernon hadn't started yelling me down, I'd definitely have a broken bone or two. As I left the room and went down the stairs, I reminded myself for the millionth time to learn to do a proper Episkey for when he does hit me. Aunt Petunia was in the kitchen starting her husband's breakfast, and I relieved her of breakfast duty. My uncle assured me that I was getting a punishment later when they got back from the cinema to see a film with Dudley before he left for another school year. He also warned that if any of my tasks were left undone, I'd be punished for them as well. Determination ran through me. Hogwarts started in a week, which meant that the Weasley's were picking me up tonight, so if I was hurt too bad then they'd notice. And this was definitely not something I wanted to discuss with them. Though he punished me anyway, putting a cigarette out on the back of my hand when I set down his breakfast. I didn't give him the satisfaction of screaming.
"Morning boys and girls!" Our bubbly professor grinned. It seems wrong for her to be a morning person too. "Let's start, shall we? Muggle history can be a pretty big topic."
They weren't yet out the door before Harry started moving. He couldn't breathe and was so disheartened he needed fresh air. He needed to get out, to be by himself and cry. Hermione rushed into the room, seeing the mess and promising to clean it while Harry took his time. She looked like she wanted to follow, but held herself back as Harry begged her to just stay and clean. He needed this time alone, so he ran out to the gardens, to the comfort of his safe space.
The 'club session' lasted 90 minutes, but it felt like even longer. That was an hour and a half of the most awkward speeches and disgusting photos that had ever been shown to me, or was likely to ever be shown to me again.
A voice in my head chuckled. I wasn't punished for being gay, although if they found out then I'd definitely be in much more pain, much more often. But what I said was different, and probably insulting. "Why are you doing this?"
He opened the door, thanking Merlin that he didn’t freeze up at Malfoy’s sweet, sexy voice. Harry was beginning to get angry with himself, he hated Malfoy, so why was he thinking of him like he was. Harry tried to clear his mind by emptying the contents of his trunks into the conveniently placed dresser. Malfoy started to go through his trunk, sorting his clothes into piles before putting them away. Harry finished first, and sat down on his bed, putting pictures on his bedside table.
I shook my head at her bluntness, "that was the second time we've kissed properly, so that's why you haven't heard anything. And I'd rather he didn't find out about how long I've wanted him. He knows I've always wanted to be his friend, but not that I've wanted to be more before now. I don't know how he'd react."
Harry turned his head slightly, catching a glimpse of the toned bicep of the arm connecting him to Malfoy, but looking down before he started letting his mind wander. Turning back around, Harry offered the chance to talk over whatever his enemy wanted to before he left and forgot he’d seen him, or that they'd kissed.
When the lesson ended, Harry turned away from Draco as he stood up, which meant he got a spectacular kick in the head, that made him clutch his head and groan. This time the more he fought, the worse it got until he was actually bawling his eyes out, trying to rip out his hair, but the pain ever ended, at least until Harry blacked out from the excruciating pain.
Harry went to see his dad and admitted that he was right and that Draco was always in his mind. Snape smiled, glad to see Harry in love with someone who deserved his love. Snape’s only issue was that Harry hadn’t acted on his feelings, and insisted that he did, as soon as he could.
Except - maybe it had. I remembered back to when I thought of his lips, thinking they were kissable, even though I knew he was a guy. But then I thought about if I could kiss him. If he was really attractive I would think it through, but actually kissing a boy - maybe not. But if I could, if it came down to wanting to kiss a boy, I think Gemini would be my type. His witty, biting sarcasm that makes me chuckle, his jokes that are so bad they're funny, the views that make me question everything I know about his house. He had to be ugly. It would be cosmically unfair if he was good-looking with a sweet personality like that. Maybe I wouldn't be able to resist him.
Harry blushed, and rolled off Draco, getting himself up. He offered Draco a hand and helped Draco up. Everyone else in the class was staring at them, and they separated completely. Even after that little incident, they still finished first. As a reward, Professor Slughorn let them leave lesson early, so they packed up and left. Draco turned towards the Great Hall, but Harry turned back to Defence Against the Dark Arts.
Hermione was also sorted back into Gryffindor, and then Neville was called up to the stool. He shakily sat down, taking deep breaths as the Sorting Hat sat on his head. It took longer than the others and then declared Neville a Slytherin. Harry knew Neville enough to know he had an internal meltdown, but he remained composed and went to sit at the Slytherin Table. Harry knew he was next, and he’d spent all night thinking about what the hat had said in first year. He didn’t think it was right to leave Neville on his own in Slytherin and decided that maybe he was ready to go to Slytherin, like the Hat intended in first year.
"Mr Malfoy came this morning, if you leave those I send word for him to come to collect them." The professor smiled, "I must ask that you please refrain from fighting again. Thank you."
"Your names have been scribed on the dorm doors, each room is either a single or a double, and don’t worry, boys aren’t mixed with girls. Now does anyone have any questions?"
"Get out of here. Granger get him out of here." He growled, "I'm not letting you anywhere near him after how you've treated him."
I bit my lip. So he had put a lot of effort into this. I felt bad for not reciprocating better. Maybe I should ask Gemini to apologise to Malfoy. But how can I pull that off without him knowing it's me? If he doesn't already know, asking for advice might have already screwed me over. This would just have to be something I feel bad about but never bring up. At least I put some effort into it.
Frank started to cry, so I rocked him a little, smiling that he was my little boy too. Neville wrapped his arm around me, and we headed off outside, so we could apparate home. I shivered a little because of the cold, so Neville stood behind me and cuddled me properly, as he kissed the top of my head.
"I also don't imagine there are beautiful things like that in our gardens," Lucius smirked, leaving his son to stare.
"I'm sorry, I had to tell them something." He started, still not looking at me. "I only told Madam Pomfrey, well and your Godfather after he started throwing a fit. I could only say what you'd told me, so Dumbledore wants to see you in the morning. Given how Ron isn't your biggest supporter anymore, he thought it best keep you in a different room for a week, or until Christmas seen as he has to go somewhere for a while and wants to know you'll be okay. Just for the record, I'm sorry for breaking your trust, especially after I've only just gained it, but not telling them so they can help you."
Harry tried to defend himself, but Draco wasn’t having it as he turned away. Harry broke out in tears, and he hardly knew why, because he’d never let Draco see him cry, but could tell it was the demon in him seeking penance for his mistake, and begging for forgiveness. Harry felt so embarrassed to be crying and tried to stop as he wiped his tears away.
When Benylin walked in, charms jangling on her wrists and skirts, I was about ready to rush her to start already. But she took her time, slowly introducing the topic of love and relationships, a worthy topic after multiple students had approached her to question things. This was the part I already knew, and I was trying not to show I had any idea what she might be going on about. Poor Neville blushed two seats down from me, not hiding his involvement well. Luckily, nobody paid attention to Neville too much, so it wasn't likely someone noticed.
Snape stormed out of the classroom, his cape billowing behind him, and left me with Harry. I sat down at the workbench and held Harry’s hand. It was cooler than normal. I brushed his hair out of his face and shook my head. I didn’t understand what the hell was happening, but Snape spoke to me like it was my fault. What did I do? I thought over everything that had happened, realising that it started this morning. When Harry started avoiding me.
We let her go on, none of us wanting to know anything this 'club' would teach us. Ron only wanted to talk about our names, but nobody was willing to own up to theirs. He just laughed, thinking he was hilarious using the pseudonym
Ron and Hermione had tried to pull him out of it - of course they had - but he'd turned to stone, just letting the years wear him away because there was nothing else he could do. He was stone, he couldn't move, he couldn't feel. He just was.
Draco had known, had been warned over and over again as to what was being asked of him. He would have to abandon his middle name, the name of his father, in order to be sworn into Potter’s house. His father had done too much in the war, had offended too many people. He hadn’t even been allowed to come to his son’s wedding, though that had not been overtly discussed. Draco was allowed to bear the name Malfoy as a compromise to abandoning Lucius.
than the horrific reality of a public custody battle. No matter how much it tore at him, Draco needed to create a place for Potter in his life. The alternative was too horrible to contemplate.
Somehow, in all his anxiety over the day and subsequent night Draco had never considered the future beyond it. Maybe subconsciously he’d never thought he’d get this far, or that the person who became a Potter would no longer be Draco. The future had been disconnected from him, a would-be meant for someone else, but with Potter’s one comment somehow a worse horror came to him: a husband who didn’t touch him, didn’t talk to him, didn’t include him in his life. His husband would take other lovers to satisfy him, either out of some misplaced idea of Draco’s virtue or just because he simply wasn’t attractive enough. Draco would have no one on his side in these foreign lands and no purpose to occupy himself with.
For all his horror towards what sex between them would be like, he never considered that it might be the
“Oh, wow.” Harry gaped at the floral china and neatly arranged table linens. The meat was already carved, picturesque slices lined up and covered in some kind of gravy. Accompanied was a lovely blue casserole dish full of mashed potatoes that appeared to have been double-baked, and a matching ornate platter with a deliberate arrangement of green beans. Fancy glasses full of water sat in the corner of each table setting (except Teddy’s, his cup was neon orange and very obviously unbreakable) and a low vase full of daisies sat right in the center of the table, completing the look.
A crown was placed on his head, smaller, with less height than the one Potter wore and without the jewel centerpiece, but the same style and colour of gold.
Doors opened from behind them, the opposite end from the entrance to the great hall they’d used. Sunlight illuminated them and for just a moment Draco let himself relish the picture they made, halo’d by the light coming in from behind them.
And they did bow. As he passed they fell in waves, lowering their heads in a respect that made his insides squirm, but gave him a reprieve to lift his head just momentarily to the ceiling of the great hall. The hall itself was a lovely, if bland, light grey stone that supported itself with columns interspersed where the rows of guests sat. Of course, it was lavishly decorated but somehow all the flowers and ribbons couldn’t hold a candle to the ceiling. It was a twisting symmetry of carved stone and stained glass, leaving huge swaths of natural light into the hall; colours dancing in geometric patterns on the walls no matter where you turned. The stone running in between the glass had the Potter history carved into it, with marriages and treaties and all other notable periods in history permanently etched above their heads. The fire that had burned the corpses of Voldemort’s conquest had happened in this hall, and the ash had coated the ceiling, hiding the beauty beneath for decades. While much of his family’s history had been lost with book burnings and the destruction of monuments, the ultimate record had survived. Beneath his parents ashes.
Before he could even contemplate what to do the door was thrown open once more with the man helping someone significantly smaller through.
Malfoy made a noise. “They are, but I wanted Teddy to have muggle friends. And it’s an easy way to give me some rest from his antics.”
Harry nodded slowly, gesturing for a court servant to take the gift off his hands. With barely a pause Parkinson turned to Draco and dipped her hand into her own pocket. Harry tensed, but a small dagger was quickly extracted and presented to Draco by Parkinson herself, her servant cautiously waiting behind her.
All at once Harry’s words leave him, clogging in his throat with emotions he didn’t expect him to find in this encounter.
Harry had an answer, an answer he'd allowed himself to have without shame. He'd been sick. He'd been trapped. He'd been swamped with too many damn funerals to count and it had all been too much for a teenager fresh out of a war.
Harry bit back a sigh, watching as Draco turned once again to his mother and accept her hand on his arm with little fuss. Hilariously, Harry did the same when Ron pat his shoulder.
Teddy made a sound at his voice, which Malfoy compulsively soothed. With that, with too much conflicting information and emotions running high, Harry let himself be shuffled out the door with no further issue, barely catching a small voice ask, “What’s a godfather?”
Malfoy stopped walking and flared his nostrils, whipping around to stare in the vague direction Harry was still invisible.
Malfoy rubbed his wrist, steeling himself with a shaky breath. "Go to you room, Teddy," he said, much more calmly than he'd been speaking to Harry, and quite a bit more calmly than Harry expected of him.
“I will ask Melinda about your claim. If you’re right then-” Malfoy cut off, a desperate gleam in his eye. “If you’re right then I will be in touch.”
Harry ignored him, fully aware at the abysmal state of his home. “Ron, er,” he said instead, “could you go get supper? I need to speak to Malfoy.”
“We’ll see you next week, Potter.” Malfoy sighed, opening the door open and ushering him out with new vigor.
Harry tipped his head and watched him curiously. “Well,” he chuckled, “I’m sure you wouldn’t want to do this every night.”
Malfoy walked off before Harry could reply, hurrying into the kitchen where the clatter of ceramic soon followed. Harry stared, but quickly shook off the entire scene as Teddy came sprinting back to him.
While Potter carried his infamous sword at his belt, Draco carried the ceremonial bit of cloth that would bind Potter and him together, a practice they certainly did not do at Malfoy weddings. To be fair, there was a lot to this affair that was just not done on Malfoy soil. Letting the riffraff in to gawk being the main one.
Harry should have checked up on him. Merlin. Merlin. No matter how hard it was just to keep on living, he should have visited him. Or just even given him a fucking thought beyond how Teddy was just another person he was letting down.
A chirp came from his ankles as he closed the door to Teddy’s room, along with the cool press of a wet nose.
Draco wasn't a person in their eyes. He didn't think for himself, he didn't have values or beliefs. He was a child who had followed his father blindly. He'd never been genuine. He'd never cared about the cause.
The sound of scribbling broke the silence and Harry watched as Andromeda scrawled something on the back of an unopened letter.
A month off, after all he'd been through, wasn't a long amount of time. His friends had thought so, giving him his space and only popping in once or twice. But after the first month, well, Harry started to run out of justifications. He had to move. Finish school. Start his auror career. He had a life all his own now. He had to start living it.
Malfoy nodded. "Melinda is the only one who knows our address, barring you now of course. I never take Teddy with me to the wizarding world so no one even knows I have him. There aren't any proper wards around the house, being muggle, but I've put up enough rudimentary wards that have sufficed. The ministry wouldn't let me keep Teddy if he wasn't safe. Is that it?"
All thoughts to this ended when the court marshal cried; “Announcing his Highness Prince Draco Lucius Malfoy!”
Draco had nothing to say to that, so he said nothing. Instead he swung a leg over the edge of the mattress and kicked the knife under the bed. “There. It’s gone. No need to worry.”
“From this day onward,” the old man spoke to the crowd from behind Draco, “this man will be known as his Royal Highness Draco Malfoy Potter, and be granted the title of Prince Consort, legitimate husband to his Royal Majesty the King Harry James Potter!”
Teddy immediately went back to his work and Harry heard a coughing laugh from beside him. “He’s a little manipulator.”
Draco sighed, feeling a stinging in his eyes himself. He’d had Teddy for six years, and for those six years he’d done his absolute best to distance himself from a horrible past and a vindictive present. He’d done everything in his power to create stability and safety for his charge and for himself, rearranging his entire life around the kid crying into his ratty old muggle shirt. Then, after all these years, came a spit in the face to all he’d worked to build.
Harry stood before Malfoy’s home after sleeping until noon, hastily showering off the week’s work, and throwing on an old Weasley jumper. He folded down the wrinkles in the garment, somehow nervous. He’d started the week off so confident but now felt a strange nervous energy. Harry shook his head.
The file ended up being an overzealous apothecary manager (not owner! The notes from the ministry agent who’d taken the initial case notes exclaimed) to a rural wizarding community who was absolutely certain supplies had been stolen, but seemed to have misplaced sale records for Harry to match to the original order records. The manager had instead sent ten months of backlogged records to prove how detail-oriented they were, and therefore the unprovable crime was true because they could be trusted to be kept fully aware of their stock. Basically Harry was being forced to investigate a crime that most likely hadn’t happened with an overzealous client for an essential business that cannot afford to be disrupted in a small community.
"How about you?" Harry had whispered when everyone was distracted with Ron. "Think you'll give it a shot with Blaise?"
It wasn't until Friday that we settled on a place to have our little picnic, finally calming Gemini's panic. He'd found a secluded little cave near the lake that he thought seemed perfect. They could build a fire if it got cold, were protected from rain, but the large entrance still let in enough natural light they didn't need to use magic to see each other. I let him know the food was sorted and I was picking it up before I went to the cave. Dobby had insisted he handle everything, pulling Winky in to help him. It was good to see her getting a little bit better.
Sirius left with a wink, embarrassing me like the perfect father figure. I made to move out of bed, but a firm hand settled on my shoulder, keeping me where I was. I looked over to see Draco biting his lip, avoiding my eyes, and worrying about something. I placed my hand over his, trying for a supportive smile. I told him whatever he was holding back wasn't worth the worry, and I'd try not to react badly. I wanted as much open honesty from him as I'd given him about this.
"What are you thinking? Potter, of all people? You're a wealthy, attractive young man, you could have anyone, and you go and burden yourself with the damaged goods."
Harry looked past Draco at Theo, who casually entered the room with a smile. He kissed Draco on the cheek as he passed him, but headed straight to Harry, grinning. Theo laughed at the tears in Harry’s eyes and blamed it on him trying to get between him and his lover. He smiled that it was only a matter of time before Draco realised that Harry wasn’t good enough, and come running back.
Ron and Hermione sat down on the end of Harry’s bed, looking at him anxiously with his birthday presents in their laps. Harry smiled at them, reaching out to take his presents off them. Ron handed him a small rectangular parcel that was flexible like clothing.
I looked back over, and he met my gaze. He smiled slightly and turned away to continue his conversation with Pansy. All the Hufflepuff girls start chatting and panting. Susan Bones looked like she was about to faint. Ron chuckled, verbally warning me that they were probably going to lock me in a broom closet with him until we came out a couple. The idea plagued my thoughts. I supposed it wouldn't be too bad, as long as he reigned in his snarky comments and arrogant attitude. He was very good-looking, no doubt looked just as good naked…probably best to end that thought train. But I cut myself to deal with my mental pain, self-abhorrence and my nightmares, which meant almost every night. I couldn't be in a relationship with him until I could be perfect at keeping my problems a secret or just get rid of them, cos I didn't want a fuck friend, I wanted a boyfriend, and nobody was strong enough to bare my burden with me.
Harry had to shake his head, trying to pull his hands free. He only just yanked his hands free, having to jiggle his finger out of the signet ring and leave it behind. He didn't let the opportunity slip, turning back to the front of the castle to sprint away. The prince called out to him, his footfalls sounding behind Harry. But the omega couldn't let that get to him. He needed to stay ahead. He spotted the carriage quickly, it was the only golden pumpkin one. He called out to the footmen, having the driver ready to pull away before he got to the door. He was leaving the gate before the prince caught sight of him.
Nobody reacted, too surprised by how happily she said that to verbalise our shock. She launched into a lecture on how important it was to integrate among each other. She had attended Hogwarts in her childhood, and despite her sunny disposition had been placed in Slytherin. Everyone was enraptured in her speech about her time as a Slytherin distrusted by all the other houses, yet not trusted by her own house for not fitting into the mould society had set.
"And I have the perfect form for an omega, even the tailor says so (because she's paid to). I have strong hips, I'll be able to carry loads of kids and that's important to a prince. He'll need strong beautiful heirs, and I have the strength and beauty already (he was fat, that didn't mean he was strong. He might have the wide hips for carrying a baby, but the prince would have to get one in him first, and that didn't seem likely. The beauty comment wasn't even worth denying seriously)."
“Aww, now you’ll have a little brother or sister.” Draco frowned, “But that doesn’t explain why you’re in here.”
Before, if he wanted something doing he had to do it himself, as well as do the work for everyone else. In the palace, he wasn't the servant. He had his own servants. And they always asked if he was okay and if there was anything they could do for him. It was a surreal change. And he thought he would have his alpha with him to ease that change, maybe by letting him do little things himself, or at least it would feel good to have Draco show concern whereas it was uncomfortable for the random beta servants around him. But Draco had been keeping his distance since they got back.
Harry followed the order, eagerly sucking to push that promise closer. He was almost embarrassed, but how could he not choke on his moans when Malfoy takes those lips and wraps them around his dick. It was so good. The fingers left Harry's mouth, and they reappeared at Harry's hole. They went in without so much trouble, and the discomfort didn't show up until the second finger was inside him, too distracted by how hot and wet Malfoy's mouth was. The third finger brought the pain, and Harry tensed.
." I peaked up at him to see him looking at me in confusion. My cheeks heated. "I don't sleep well, I have nightmares and that leads me to cut myself. I guess I was just thinking that if you were there, it'd help. But if you still don't want to, or feel I'm guilt tripping you..."
"Okay everybody, I want to ask you all to take a seat." The new professor smiled, "but the twist is, you can't be next to a member of your house on either side. So find somebody with a different colour on their tie and take a seat."
I shook as I waited for Neville to come by like he did every night. I shook as I waited for him, remembering all the sweet things he’d said to me, and how he’d stood by me, even when I told him what I was, and what responsibilities he now had. Neville truly is such a loving, kind boy. And I couldn’t bear it if I lost him now, not after all these years of wanting.
We trod out of the carriages and up the stairs to Hogwarts. Cho was googling Malfoy like he was water in her oasis, and I don't understand why it bothered me. I noticed him look up at her and gesture her to the side, far enough away for no one to hear them. Hermione and Ron seemed interested as well, and the three of us walked slowly so we could watch them talking, well watch the blonde talking. And whatever he said, she wasn't happy about it.
Draco bounded down shortly after, and together they headed down to King's Cross Station, Platform 9 ¾. They met Ron and Hermione at the entrance, with little Rosie Weasley. Rosie and Aries started talking, laughing about something, and Leo started talking to Ron. Hermione looked beat, she had little Nathan on the way.
Harry blushed a deep shade, causing Hermione to smack her alpha on the back of his head and remind him of how Harry grew up. His relatives hadn't thought he'd bond with anyone, they kept him hidden and probably meant for him to never find an alpha to be with. So he didn't know what bonding was, same as she hadn't before they'd bonded. Then Ron had the sense to also blush, realising he'd made the situation more uncomfortable than he had intended. He made up a fake excuse, pretending to hear his name being called, and ran off towards the castle again.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed, making Harry attempt an escape before they could start a full-on fight, or something else more passionate. As Harry’s body moved away, he felt a tight grip on his arm but was refusing to turn around and face the risk. He hoped Malfoy would let go, but that was about as likely as Voldemort marrying a Muggle-born.
"Harry my boy, I want you to work with Mr Malfoy," he smiled. "Professor Snape said you two would work best together, so the first workbench please."
Draco flinched, but opened his eyes to look into Harry’s, and let out the breath he’d been holding. As his lips parted, Harry couldn’t suppress his urge to kiss them, intending it to be a sweet little peck. But when their lips connected, it turned passionate, and Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck to pull him close. The blonde reacted, wrapping his arms around the other boy’s waist, running his fingers round to the buttons of Harry's robes. Their tongues tangled in the fight for dominance, but neither boy gave up the power. That just turned Harry on. Harry felt his buttons being loosened, and his robes pushed off his shoulders. His shirt was pulled out of his waistband, and nimble fingers caressing his skin.
. No numbers, no extra hints to who they were like I had done. No clue if they were a boy or girl. I guess I was wrong, this class will be strangely exciting if it's anything like the homework.
"You always picked on me and the friends I did have, nearly always. That's why I'm not entirely sure any of this is genuine." But I want it to be.
"Then I'll provide a new plan. We'll retire for tonight, and then tomorrow we can get to know each other and maybe make out. How does that sound?"
"Think about it Ron, you ruined the Yule Ball for me because you were jealous I didn't go with you after you'd been developing feelings for me. Draco's had these feelings for years, and when Harry learned the depth of them, he didn't say he loved him back. That would bother anyone. I think his problem is that Harry has problems, so he doesn't want to talk about it and upset him. He bottles up his feelings, so this little thing pushed him over the edge. Ron came and bugged him, he felt guilty for the pushing, then Harry has a go at him when he thought he was doing the right thing so he's guilty and confused and probably ashamed. It was too much, so it's hard to say how long this will last without an apology from Harry."
Harry jumped off the table, and fell on Draco, knocking him to the floor. Harry stopped his head from hitting the floor and pulled him into a kiss. Draco started to push him back, but gave in eventually, clutching Harry to him. When Harry pulled back, he declared he’d made his choice. Draco just nodded, stroking Harry’s hair. They smiled at each other and climbed off the floor.
Harry shivered, his girlfriend slowly sliding from his thoughts, "actually, I'm more the one being tied up. Submitting."
He looked away, facing forward. I did the same, waiting and hoping for him to apologise or take back what he said because I didn't want to lose my best friend. When nothing was said, I guessed he wasn't talking to me, effectively ending our friendship.
The alpha took pity on his poor, uncomfortable omega and slowly removed the rest of his clothing. It had to be slow, to make sure he didn't touch Harry's skin. He needed to avoid that until they were going to bond, otherwise, Harry would beg for more and get more uncomfortable. And he was suffering enough already. Another cramp hit and Harry curled himself on his side, tears building in his eyes. Being with an alpha sucked, the cramps were almost unbearable. But he refused to close his eyes, gaze fixed on his alpha's hands as they started removing the layers of his clothes. Inch by teasing inch of perfect pale skin was revealed, with his alpha's slim but firm build. But this meant his whining got louder.
There was a thud from our surroundings, and we looked in unison to see Susan Bones had fainted on the floor, her friends staring at us instead of helping. I started giggling, and soon we were both laughing. I enjoyed his laugh, and he seemed to enjoy mine. Hermione would probably faint if she saw us too.
Harry tried to think positively about it, it might be a long walk but it had the best view. His eyes wondered over to Malfoy, who was watching him closely, stroking his lower lip as if deep in thought. Harry blushed but didn't understand his reaction. It would be easy to lose himself thinking about those lips. The teachers stopped us in the Common Room, and Snape moved forward.
Molly's voice rang tense, but responsible, "Sirius, don't do something you'll regret. You've just got cleared."
Harry giggled, finding the man's pronunciation rather endearing as he pointed out the pumpkin patch. His aunt didn't especially like pumpkins, but they showed wealth so she insisted they grow some. The man looked delighted by the sight, pulling out a pink umbrella from under his coat. Without a word, he pointed it at the biggest pumpkin and a spark shot out the end. To Harry's amazement, the pumpkin started to roll, shifting away from the patch, and swelling to an unreal scale. The vines and leaves started writhing, forming wheel-like shapes and lifting the pumpkin like a carriage. In fact, it was starting to look like a carriage, with golden leaf details.
“Well, it may be your fault we’re in this mess, but I love you.” Neville smiled. “And now I know that I don’t have to sacrifice a family because of my sexuality. You really are amazing, and everything I could ever dream of.”
I kissed him, it was all I'd wanted to do to reassure him. I apologised for losing my temper when I knew he was only trying to do the right thing. I should learn from my mistakes, but I still wanted my confession to really mean something to him, and it was my thing, so I planned to tell him later. Maybe during dinner, or when we were in bed. One night with his mouth on me and now I wanted it all the time. Because he was tender and compassionate with me, not like the crap I knew before. And I just know he'll be the same when we actually go all the way.
Malfoy grinned, and for some reason, the fact he was happy made Harry happier. It was really starting to piss Harry off. And that’s when it hit him. Severus had explained the whole soulmate situation to Harry, and that he would feel different around his soulmate. And Harry knew one thing for sure, the way he felt towards Malfoy was nowhere near normal.
It only got worse. Because she then brought the two parts together, teaching how sex worked and the things it then causes. The pregnancy I could handle, the pictures were okay and after the scary talk Professor Benylin made it sweeter with baby pictures of happy families. Then came the STDs. Things I never want to talk about or see again.
The omega smiled sadly, his eyes shone as he looked up to Draco. "Because my family are wealthy, but not on the level of royalty. And I'm basically a servant in my own home. Certainly not fit to be a queen."
I nodded, shoving Malfoy away. He carried on smiling, looking like he was going to say something, but we were interrupted. A giggling group of girls shuffled past us, some getting terribly close to me, and shockingly close to him. He tensed as a manicured hand brushed against his ass, and the girls almost swooned as they walked away. Malfoy just shook his head, asking how I ever put up with that. I was still confused by why they were fondling him anyway. He shuffled past me.
I didn't understand. I dropped the hem and turned back around. Hermione grabbed onto me, Ron too, and I felt her tears on my neck. I hugged them back, and Sirius started shaking with barely contained rage. Dumbledore rasped about getting me to a room where I could get caught up on the events of the summer, while they continued their chat with the order. I nodded and proceeded up the stairs with my friends and my luggage, taking them to the same room I was in last year.
“Oh, and Neville,” Harry grinned. “Professor Snape wanted to see you, I must have forgotten to mention that at lunch.”
"I like the psychology stuff she was talking about, and it might be fun to learn politics or history, or both." Hermione grinned. How she could be so excited about learning was a mystery to me. Especially since she was actually a muggle-born and raised.
I tried not to wince, it's not like I didn't already know I was 'damaged goods', but it was painful to hear someone say that to influence someone I was starting to care for. He went on about suggesting my feelings weren't there, and that I was going for the money, or using him purely because he was pretty. I was a little miffed, as he went on and on, slandering me for being fake when I was nothing but, and Draco didn't say a word. And then he finished.
"Sorry, guess I'm a hugger," he blushed. "I just don't know how to comfort someone, so I tried to think of what Granger would do... oh how the mighty have fallen right?"
Draco and Harry walked to Potions together, laughing about something Snape had done. Harry liked seeing his dad as a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, seen as that’s what he’d wanted to be for a long time. They were still joking around when they got to the Potions Classroom. Slughorn welcomed them in and told them to partner up at a workbench. They went to sit together, and Slughorn ordered the class to brew a cauldron of Antidote to Uncommon Poisons. Draco got straight down to business, opening the book and starting the potion. Harry liked how bossy Draco was when it came to Potions, it was kind of hot.
I gaped, think I’d said more than I should, and embarrassed that I’d practically just told him I’m interested in him. I looked away, blush burning across my face, and Snape came to crouch next to me, resting his hand on my knee. He told me it was alright for me to talk to him, that he was someone I could trust, and that’s when I just did it. I didn’t plan on it, I just kissed him. He was so surprised he fell over, and I nearly fell with him. He looked up at me in shock, and I lost every ounce of my courage, so I scurried away and left him in shock, just running back to my room.
And just the word was enough to have Harry howl, head back and desperately pushing back for it, rutting against his alpha like a wild whore. And the actions were very welcomed. So much so that Draco pushed on, swelled knot pressing past Harry rim and making him come before he even knew what was happening. He was in such a blissful state, he barely felt his alpha roll his hips for the last bits of friction he needed until there were fangs in his neck. And it was like orgasming again, feeling a bond snap and writhe between them.
Sirius stroked his head softly, and Harry winced when he yanked out some of his hair. Harry grumbled, rubbing it better, as Sirius laughed at him. Sirius left, in a better mood than when he came in, and Hermione and Ron looked at Harry expectantly.
"Are there any other omega males living in this estate? We are required to allow them to try also." Blaise asked.
Harry groaned, rubbing his temples. He should have been expecting this, but he hadn’t planned that far ahead. He asked Seamus if he moaned when everyone else got sorted, and why he couldn’t just get over it like everyone else was pretending to do. Seamus gaped at him, before glaring. Snape stepped in as Seamus reached for his wand, warning Seamus not to lay a finger on his son or there'd be hell to pay. Everyone gaped, even the other teachers, but Harry just sniggered.
“Then tell me who you like, I’ll tell them you need to talk to them tonight, and you have to be happy too.”
"But you don't need to worry, I know what I'm doing. I've brewed this before." The blonde smiled before it turned sad. "I'm sorry about getting defensive this morning, I just felt embarrassed. It was rude to threaten you when you didn't do anything."
He moved from my mouth to jaw, and I relaxed against his touch. He whispered that he loved me into my ear and I couldn't help releasing a little moan. He nibbled my earlobe, kissed down my neck, over my chest and had a quick lick of my nipples. I shivered as he moved down my stomach, but the prick avoided my... well,
"SIT teaches us that we can stop prejudice with a single in-group, so in Hermione's example we would be Hogwarts students and not separate houses." Professor Benylin smiled. "And RCT uses superordinate goals. Working towards a common goal so everyone can benefit. Now, tell me how we can apply this to the school."
Both startling and frustrating, Draco finally understood why the guards barely heckled him or why the prisoners on either side of him barely gave him a second glance. Why his father was dead while his trial was still months away. Why his solicitor always gave him a pat on the arm and confidently assured him he would be okay. Because he would be. Because people didn't care.
to care for, Draco. You’re the one who assumed responsibility, so I don’t know what you want from me.”
“Come on,” Harry said, pulling at Draco’s hand and now he realized they’d been stopped because the entrance to the room was directly in front of them, Harry confidently taking hold of the handle and almost propelling Draco inward with how eager he seemed.
Harry yelped and pushed her away when a voice came from the doorway. “Well, don’t you look dashing.”
“Last thing,” she muttered under her breath, and Harry held his as she took in hand his father’s crown and stood in front of him patiently.
Made of pure gold, the crown spun a modest height with poised and angular points that resembled a stag’s antlers. The peaks pointed forward, twisting along the circle of the crown to gather at the front where some peaks twisted up like they were ready to skewer and enemy, while others just twisted, creating a nest-like center where it hosted a large blood-red jewel.
“Okay.” Harry agreed, but before he could react Teddy was grabbing his hand and dragging him towards the television.
“Can we watch the film again, Draco?” Teddy asked, clasping his hands behind his back and staring at Malfoy from behind his eyelashes.
It was all…entirely too domestic. Harry had gone in with zero expectations and yet still he found them subverted. Draco Malfoy took muggle cooking classes. The majority of Teddy’s friends were muggle. He played with little plastic men and casually shifted his hair to match the cowboy figurine without even noticing it.
Then a year after the war the world started to turn again. People went to work. Hogwarts was reopening. The prophet reported on the economy or the local government elections in a remote wizarding community. It wasn't as if the war had just disappeared, of course not, but it was no longer the biggest issue in people's lives. They had grieved. People who needed to be in Azkaban were all there. The ministry was up and running and had been for a while. People were ready to move on.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, taking a step towards Teddy and suddenly realizing he didn’t know how to talk to children, “I don’t think we were properly introduced. My name is Harry Potter.”
2. This is going to feature a Lot of lore, because a lot of the tension comes from the disparity in culture between the two
Teddy barreled down the stairs much the same as he’d done before, tripping on the last few steps only to catch himself on the rail. He was dressed like an adult, with a knitted cardigan over a solid colour, but more startling was the white-blond hair worn stylishly sculpted in parody of Malfoy’s current style. Teddy gave Harry and imperious look, hands on his hips before striding right past him to Malfoy’s side.
That was why he was here, standing on Andromeda's stoop for the first time in six years, flushed pink and hoping to see his godson for the first time since his parents' funeral.
“Well?” Malfoy drawled, despite the caution in his voice. “Are you going to speak or has some tragic act of heroism robbed you of that ability?”
But whether he liked it or not, Malfoy had made an impression on him. He was undeniably recognizable as the Malfoy Harry had experienced in school, dignified and pompous when he’d talked down to Harry with such a posh accent. But he’d berated Harry…with a toddler tucked into his neck, effortlessly placed there in such a familiar gesture that made a nerve in Harry’s heart twinge. Even now, after a full day of slogging through work and replaying that picture over and over in his head, Harry couldn’t reconcile the slytherin death eater bully with the man who had so carefully cradled Teddy’s head.
. His nervousness disappeared, replaced with a jutting chin and a glare so pronounced it completely warped Tonks’ features into something distinctly Malfoy.
He shook his head, and Harry almost had half a mind to call her back to explain herself (because that had been a threat, hadn’t it?) when Draco clarified: “She’s my best friend. She’s just the absolute worst best friend in the whole world.”
Days bled into each other. Months. Years. Harry cried, but couldn't quite feel what about. He just felt hallow. And so tired.
Teddy’s eyes narrowed further and he scoffed, reaching up to grab Malfoy around the neck and whisper something in his ear. Malfoy smiled at him, but it was subdued.
Just a glance at the woman who opened the door made dread pool in his stomach. She was greasy and disheveled, in her nightgown even though it was the afternoon, and her eyes were clouded over with a familiar and terrifying fog.
Draco clenched his jaw and let his neck bend for just a moment before springing back up proudly. His boots were black. This was not a negotiated concession, this was something he was trying to get away with. A small act of defiance the day of.
By late afternoon Harry was steady, relatively, and physically walked to Malfoy's place in his muggle clothes this time, eliminating the option of disapparating. He needed to see Teddy, properly. He needed to know him.
"He's your cousin," the woman spoke like she was reading from a form, "his grandmother is your mother's sister."
tw for: discussions of non-con (as a concept), gore (in history), violence, and any other triggers associated with the arranged marriage trope.
By the end of the week Harry was beyond knackered. He hadn’t had time to consider what to get Teddy and certainly hadn’t had time to ring Malfoy to ask. Balancing the ego of a big fish in a small town was an exercise in patience Harry hadn’t even felt when dealing with an angry and vengeful toddler. Harry loved his job, it stimulated him and made him feel fulfilled, but public relations wasn’t exactly his favourite part.
"He was adopted out." Andromeda whispered, clutching her cup of tea to her chest. "But I trust Melinda. I know he's with a family that cares for him."
His mother was unperturbed, casually flipping through the prophet. “Why don’t you consult one of the books you bought, Draco?”
The silk slid smoothly over his skin, the familiar luxury doing nothing to ease the tension in his shoulders or pounding in his heart. The colours of the robes only exacerbated it; a blood red chest piece over the customary white of the occasion, trailing down to act as a partial tunic which cinched at the waist and ended at his thighs where white trousers began. These were not the colours of his kingdom, not the colours Draco grew up wearing. Over the seamtress’ shoulders he inspected the outfit in the mirror, desperately seeking out the small concession he knew were there.
“A lovely gift, but I’m afraid I couldn’t part with my own sword for very long,” he said, patting his hip.
"Oh bloody fu-! Hello! Mr. Potter!" The older woman exclaimed, hastily re-arranging her desk at his entrance. "Do come in. My name is Melinda Marge and I am at your disposal."
The thought had been at the back of his mind the entire interaction. A whimsical, ludicrous thought that somehow a death eater had been called to provide something to the children who’d lost parents during the war. A gesture of goodwill, or perhaps one last piece of penance the ministry hadn’t named in his trial. Whatever he’d thought, he’d never actually believed they’d
Harry turned to Malfoy for clarification and was startled to find him already watching him. Slowly, Malfoy nodded. “When it was clear Teddy was a metamorphagus it would be too dangerous to allow him to go to a muggle school unsupervised. I used the muggle nursery, but now he goes to a private wizarding institution to learn his basics…” He trailed off, looking uncomfortable. “I can send you his records if you want them.”
Teddy's eyes slid over to Harry's and it took all of his willpower not to gasp. Teddy truly had Tonks' features, brown hair worn short and the dark eyes Harry knew would twinkle with mischief. He was clutching at the banister, shoulders to his ears and tiny fists clenched to his chest, staring at Harry with wide eyes.
There were funerals, memorials, tributes, awards, charities, and all sorts of functions post-war. Every day Harry would wake up and already have a million things to accomplish. He had to be there for the Weasleys when they finally buried Fred, not letting himself think about the affair beyond what he needed to do to get Ron back on his feet. He had to be there when Hermione took the obliviate off of her parents, which had not gone over very well. He'd had to be there at Lupin and Tonks' funeral, buried together just like his parents had been, Teddy wailing out in Andromeda's arms even though there was no way he could understand the impact of the ceremony.
Draco swallowed down his bile and spared his mother a smile. It stretched his skin uncomfortably and Draco already felt exhausted, imagining the next few hours where he’d have to muster a smile for those much less deserving than his mother.
Before Malfoy had said such a thing the idea that he could have still been involved with criminal activity had never entered Harry’s mind, but the thought made a new sickness burn his stomach. He’d have to look up Malfoy’s file when he got back to work.
Now it was Hermione’s turn to smile sadly, getting to her feet and abandoning the papers at the writing desk. “You’re a romantic, Harry,” she said, fiddling with his collar when she got close, “to have to commit to someone you don’t love? I just don’t think you’ve understood how much it will hurt you.”
Harry had been there for all of it. All the harsh grief coming off the Weasleys in waves, the guilt that had Hermione living with the Weasley's before the end of the summer, the pain of those brave strangers bundled away in St. Mungo's with curses so dark there was no one who could help them. He'd been there through all of it, ready for it. The relief of finally having a future outside of Voldemort had been so blinding that it carried him through every kind of pain.
When Malfoy opened the door he barely spared him a glance before ushering Harry in, gesturing for him to add his loafers to the shoe pile. The shoe pile, along with all other domestic and trivial evidence of human occupants still left Harry flat-footed and strangely blank. An ornate bowl full of business cards and breath mints sat upon a lovely wooden table. Static photos of landscapes and nature decorated the wall. Nicks to the baseboard and bumps to the beige walls speak of a well-used hallway. Used by children.
Harry grimaced, cooling slightly. The issue, the one he’d been dancing around in his head for the last hour of the film, is that confronting Malfoy with all of this seemed dangerously vulnerable. Inching much too closely to a heart-to-heart than Harry wanted with the man. He needed Draco’s permission to do so much that he wanted to do with Teddy, but being forced to consider Draco an authority in this matter still made him squirmy. Malfoy had been more than accommodating, and that was an absolute fact Harry forced himself to swallow. What Harry wouldn’t give to know what was running through his mind about this whole matter. What he wouldn’t give to know what he’d been thinking six years ago when he’d taken Teddy on.
The voice was heavily accented french and belonging to the young woman with absurd spectacles and a massive piece of parchment floating next to her, quill poised.
Feeling a bit like he was imposing once again (because a film was just a bit more of a commitment wasn’t it? Was he being invited to stay or was he being subtly asked to leave?) Harry jerked in his seat, not knowing if he needed to rise or not.
“Out of the way, my lady,” the seamstress waved. Draco’s jaw clenched tighter at the disrespect. Mother rolled her eyes.
. That the nonsensical idea of Malfoy stealing Teddy away was surrounded by context that Harry had no knowledge of. The Draco Malfoy he knew was a prat, and might still be, but the person who lounges in front of the telly in muggle jeans could never, ever be mistaken for the boy who’d preached pureblood nonsense every week like sermon.
His magic hadn't been the same after Voldemort. It had felt like a rubber band that was stretched for too long, and now that the pressure was off, it was too big. There was too much to hold onto and it slipped out if he forgot about it for just one second. It was like his magic was angry, but it wasn't. It was just too big.
But more than that, more than the title of godfather, along with Potter came the threat that Teddy could be taken away from him.
Worse than rage, magic leapt from underneath Harry's skin, straining at his core and desperate to destroy the landscape around him. While Harry was desperate to undo what had clearly already been done.
A pinched look distorted Malfoy's features. "Are you going to offer me tea, Potter? I imagine this conversation will take a while."
Teddy grumbled under his breath but climbed into bed without fuss. The fussing came when Draco got up to leave.
The boy…the boy was a normal child, energetic and round-faced, with a garishly orange raincoat and matching boots. His grin was grand and blinding, and directed firmly on the pale-blond pointy man completely covered in muggle garb and living in a muggle home. The umbrella was made of plastic for merlin’s sake, and though his coat was stylish with it’s grey pattern and upturned collar it was stylish in a…well
“I suppose,” Harry said sadly, “that if you came to bed expecting violence, a knife wouldn’t exactly be the worst thing to bring.”
The woman stared at him carefully, steepling her fingers then bringing them down to rest on her lap. "We would be very grateful if you could take him in."
The spell was thankfully broken easily when she rose and frowned at him, leaning over to pinch the fat on his back. “Straighten your back.”
Draco was clever and witty and intelligent, he could command a room with his tall tales and make his mother laugh with a sly grin. But behind those qualities...was nothing. There was no soul to him. Nothing he believed in. Actually believed in. He was a superficial construct of what a person actually was.
“He really does.” Teddy interjected, making both Harry and Malfoy swivel their heads to him. “He takes classes for it.”
“So?” he said, striking a pose and pulling his face into the cheeky grin he knew she couldn’t stand, “How do I look?”
Teddy nodded vigorously. “It’s my favourite film ever. You see this orange cat?” He pointed at a drawing of an orange cat on the cover. “His name is Thomas O’Malley, and so is my new cat!”
The bed shifted as Harry sat up, creating a looming dark shadow right next to him. Draco unconsciously shuffled away.
Harry also blushed. “I…” but Draco was already moving. After all, he had been spurred into action, hadn’t he?
“Uh,” Harry started, getting up to help but, not finding anymore work to be done, just hovered awkwardly over the table.
when he had the perfectly respectable excuse of not honouring his family’s traditions in that they would be in conflict with his new husband’s. Now he would have to…
His solicitor had put together a case for him, as well as his mother. But while Lucius Malfoy was a big fish and had his trial almost immediately, Draco wasn't held to the same regard. He spent months in that cell, months to cry and bang his head against the wall and eat the repulsive toast they kept forcing through the door’s slot.
This was shame on another level. This was shame in it's true form, and it was all Harry could do not to bury his head in the dirt and scream.
The audience clapped and before Draco knew it he was gliding past the crowd, a procession of servants behind them to carry their capes. The made their way back into the castle through the great hall, Harry’s hand in his acting as a guide to his steps. Instead of heading back to the small chamber he’d been granted the night before, they turned left up a winding staircase, small windows along the climb telling Draco they were ascending one of the turrets the castle hosted. Most likely the tallest one, if Potter tradition matched Malfoy in this regard.
"I won't put peas in the stew if I can put broccoli in." Malfoy said as he closed the gate behind them.
His mother had gone through the same, he knew, and leaned into her side just a bit more. She had been a Black daughter, a perfect match for his father as the kingdoms were direct neighbors. It made it worse of course, knowing that his mother felt the need to comfort him. It confirmed his suspicions that Draco was going to hate the coming night, that what laid in store for him was every bit as awful as Draco could imagine (and perhaps gave him a less-than-charitable thought or tow towards his own father). Harry had been in a war his entire life, and Draco wasn’t naive to the coping mechanisms his lot had used. Years at war, going from place to place had spread a reputation of the western coalition forces done in the name of Potter, a reputation built on bravery and honour and all that drivel, but also a reputation for, ugh,
But to say such a thing to Malfoy...would be impossible. Malfoy may have surprised him, may be just midly more restrained with his tongue and may go gallivanting to muggle markets to buy his food but he was still
He was a bad person, as there can be no doubt considering how his life had turned out. But more than that, he was barely a person at all.
“And do you know why I picked to name him after the orange cat?” Teddy asked, shaking Harry’s arm in his excitement. “It’s because he loves Draco so much! Doesn’t that make sense?”
"I, um-" Harry stuttered, "I'm very sorry for dropping in so suddenly, but I felt I had to explain myself in person."
As he approached he could hear noises from inside, the clanking of dishes and muffled voices. That was good. They were home. No reason to dally.
like he'd cared, but sitting alone in his cell knowing his mother was in much the same position while his father was dead made him re-evaluate that. Draco was starting to understand that he'd never understood what
It was true. Even as he spoke Teddy leaned towards Narcissa, hands trying to grab at her hair. His mother pressed two fingers to her temple, massaging gently. “Have you tried simply- giving him attention?”
Malfoy had nodded to this, hashing out the details for the specific time while Harry put on his trainers. Before Harry could ask if he should bring anything (he
Harry rounded the corner of the bannister, only to be blindsided by the still unusual sight of Draco Malfoy in full muggle regalia, hands shoved in his Jean pockets looking distinctly chived off. "Oi Mate! There's a prat here to see you!" Ron cried from the bottom of the stars, jerking a thumb behind him at the visitor.
“In my kingdom,” Harry spoke gravely, making Draco feel two feet tall, “there is no tradition that requires sex. Well I mean, yes, there is the
Harry gave it a sad look, but knelt down to accept the crown. It had been his father’s, and he’d been wearing it the day Voldemort had killed him. It had been revealed that when they’d been killed Voldemort had ordered their bodies be burnt to ash, which they had, but the crown had stayed intact. It hadn’t melted or lost even an inch of its intricate shape. Voldemort had taken the crown as a trophy, but when he’d been overthrown the foot-soldiers had discovered the crown and brought it back. It would have brought them great fortune if they’d sold it, but the peasant army had brought it back to Harry.
Potter but I’ve done nothing illegal by both muggle or magical laws, beyond what I’ve already been tried and acquitted for.”
A small bell jingled merrily and as Harry rounded the corner just a step behind Malfoy an orange ball of fur sprang at his host, a small nose nuzzling into his throat.
The cat purred, tail swishing as it reached up to lick at Draco’s chin. Harry blinked, but then another pint-sized projectile was aimed in their direction. With a shrill laugh, Teddy barreled into Malfoy, reaching up to pat the lowest section of the cat.
Draco’s foot almost stepped on Potter’s cape but he caught himself just in time, his heart rate picking up at the close blunder.
Respectful silence followed the end of the old man’s speech and for the first time Draco let himself meet Potter’s eyes, both of them sharing an understanding that they were to speak next.
Etiquette lessons from the age of four made Draco perfect for his role. Poised and elegant, he carefully didn’t react to the sight of his future husband, though every inch of him wanted to spit a few uncharitable words.
Draco scowled, angling himself and Teddy away from her. He took a breath. “My name is Draco. I think you knew that. Well,” he considered, “you probably don’t know that, but it’s been said before.” Draco frowned. “I guess I haven’t actually ever introduced myself. How inappropriate.”
Harry ignored him, taking advantage of how his husband had turned to watch her leave by gently tapping his wrist. “Do you know her?”
“No! He’s been over three times! I didn’t forget the first time!” Teddy yelled, slamming his free fist down on the bed.
Teddy grumbled and peeked out at her, looking much too disgruntled for a baby. He coughed and a spit bubble formed at the corner of his mouth which the woman wiped away. The baby seemed to take offense to the action, affronted with narrowed eyes.
“And you’re not exactly mine.” Harry retorted, but his heart wasn’t in it. The inherent dislike regarding Malfoy was juxtaposed to their situation, leaving Harry grappling to form any kind of opinion.
,” Draco expressed. “Look, that was the knife my friend gave me, okay? From earlier toady? It was a comfort. Nothing more.”
may be a political miracle but it had stolen everything Draco had been promised from birth, and it left him with duties and expectations he didn’t know how to handle.
Teddy coughed, drawing away from his arms to wipe his hands over his eyes. “Alright?” Draco asked wearily, keeping his arms outstretched.
That wasn’t entirely fair, if Harry was being honest. By all accounts the ceremony had been a smashing success. No one had tripped or fallen in any undignified way, no one had stuttered or mumbled their vows, and there had been no grand interruptions in an attempt to protect Harry from the evils of a political marriage. Ron, who had the dubious honour of sitting beside him at the head table, was even making an effort to express just how moved the crowd was by Harry’s voice.
Harry scowled, showing the first bit of anger Draco had seen from him yet. Draco rose up on his elbows, tensed for whatever would happen next.
"You're not in trouble," Malfoy said quickly, "but you need to go to your room while I deal with our guest."
Draco agreed with the sentiment, but quietly. They’d never worn such a ridiculous piece of clothing in his kingdom and for the life of him he couldn’t understand the appeal. The servants unclasped the fabrics from both of them, carefully folding them until little squares remained. Then, to Draco’s horror, all four of them turned on their heels left, with nothing but a quick bow to signal their leaving.
A young woman approached wearing much darker colours than what was considered fashionable, but the more interesting thing was how Draco stiffened, giving his undivided attention for the first time that evening.
If everything had gone according to plan Draco wouldn’t have had anything to fear. Well, he probably would have been self-conscious and nervous of course, but it would have been his job
The sky blue of his house could be seen on the sleeves in such a way that they didn’t intrude on the centerpiece. Mere threads of his blue trailed into a slopping design at the edge of his sleeves, elaborate and true to the symbols of Malfoy, but so pale they were almost lost among the white of tradition. Black was the colour usually worn in his country, acting as perfect contrast to the quicksilver and unsuspecting colour that made up his house. Blue on black.
“No occasion.” Draco said, folding his napkin on his lap. “Some people just have higher standards for mealtimes.”
Harry nodded easily, feeling the extreme gap in his knowledge of child development make itself known. He’d have to buy a book or something, maybe pester Molly on where a six year-old should be in life.
Teddy raved for a few minutes further, recounting a number of anecdotes around the cat (which had made it’s way back over to sniff curiously at Harry’s ankles) and Harry listened attentively to every word. He had been right about Teddy’s passion it seemed, he was so energetic. Were all children as spirited as Teddy was? Well, objectively that was probably the case, but watching Teddy zoom around as he gestured like a madman made Harry feel like Teddy was special.
“He’s a baby. He wouldn’t understand so he wouldn’t gain anything.” Draco pursed his lips. “And I do talk to him.”
“Mother, please.” Draco begged, holding the babe on his lap even as he struggled. “What am I doing wrong?”
Harry had felt shame before, or at least he thought he had. He'd made mistakes. He'd gotten people hurt. But therapy had made him realize how... normal his mistakes were, and had also made him realize he'd felt shame for things that were never his fault to begin with.
The point was that there was no ill-will. They had found a seat at the table and new connections could be forged.
"Of fucking course there wasn't any paperwork! His parents died in the damn war that took over the ministry."
Hermione scowled, and made sure Ron noticed her scowl from where she walked on his other side. “Seriously, Ronald?”
“Oh, ‘Mione, please,” he begged, but he could tell the gesture was genuine and not just a tease. It was so much harder to deal with the emotion rising in his throat when she was earnest like this.
“You should have seen it, mate.” Ron rolled his eyes then pressed a hand to his head in a dramatic fashion. “Oh, our king,” he said in a pitched voice, “so noble, so gallant is he. His words bring tears to the eyes of even the coldest men!”
"We only just got him crawling." The woman hushed, in deference to the swaddled baby dozing in the ministry's blandly decorated bassinet.
“He’s a metamorphagus. I’m told his mother had the same ability.” Malfoy ran his hand over Teddy’s head as he spoke.
“I mean it.” Harry said, taking another bite for emphasis. “This is amazing. Did you prepare everything, Malfoy?”
Thoughts of orphanages evoked wispy images of angry little boys who steal things that don't belong to them, and Harry quickly skittered away from the thought. At least Teddy wasn't in one of those places.
Teddy snapped his fingers as example and squeaked as foamy toothpaste began to drip down his neck. Draco handed him a towel.
