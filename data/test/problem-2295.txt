They’ve collected parts from several snakes, a half dozen faeries, a hippogriff, and a unicorn after they spend nearly an hour summoning reference books trying to figure out if unicorn bones are as cursed as their blood, when Harry’s spell lead them to something unexpected. They smell it before they see it, but Draco’s still not prepared.
He’s panting, eyes squeezed shut, and the only reason he’s not on his knees is Slughorn’s hands gripping his biceps, forcing him to stay upright. “Sorry,” he says, and when Harry manages to pry his eyes open Slughorn’s face is tight with misery. “I forgot what it feels like, the first time around.”
“Oh, no, we met when he joined my wife’s alchemy class,” Nicholas answers. “But it wasn’t until his thirty fourth birthday that we–”
, and you were a vicious fourteen year old,” Sirius insists. “That was not a fair fight.”
Harry doesn’t know what, exactly, just happened, but he knows Draco looked like he was about to pass out when he’d walked away. They’re rushing back to their tent, the Death Eaters apparently gone, and the muggles being taken care of. “Ron, what the hell–”
“Oh, good,” Arthur says, although he’s so pale that now he’s the one that looks like a ghost.
“It’s none of your business,” he snaps. “Either make your demands, or bugger off.”
He nods and walks over to his godparents, “What’s up?”
Two customers are cowering behind Ollivander, who’s facing off against Bellatrix Lestrange.
If Draco’s disappointed about the whole thing, he certainly doesn’t show it. Instead he seems
be a good teacher, I know that from personal experience, but only when he wants to be.”
Fred sighs. “As I’m sure we’re all about to find out, Umbridge can do whatever she wants.”
Everything he isn’t saying hangs in the air between them. Crouch has just accused the Boy Who Lived and a house elf of summoning a Dark Mark. Poor judgment is the kindest description of his actions
“I’ll try not to get so many detentions that it interferes with practice?” he offers.
into it, and the spot where the blast hit the shield is now an iridescent silver. As long as he keeps chanting and doesn’t blink, that will keep happening. The judges have finally figured out that Fleur isn’t fucking around, and they get out of their chairs and back away, wands in their hands.
Hermione and Ron are leaning over to get a better look, but everyone remembers what happened last time they touched a necromancy book, so they keep their hands away. Harry picks it up and as soon as he does there’s a shiver down his spine. “Ah.”
His eyes narrow. “Snape asked me that question too.”
Sirius’s mouth drops open, “The
“You’re welcome,” Padma says graciously, then pulls at her sister, urging her to follow her out of the great hall. “We’ll get started on it right now. Bye Harry!”
“I don’t know,” he says, because no one has called him Harold his whole life, no one has called him anything but Harry. But maybe it is a nickname. He has no idea. “Maybe?”
“I want to know how to use a sword,” Ginny says.
“Sure,” she says, pulling out her wand.
“If you make me say it’s fine again, I’m going to hit you,” Blaise threatens.
Her nose wrinkles and she shrugs, swallowing before saying, “Nothing conclusive yet,” and taking another large bite.
“Hey,” Draco says, grabbing onto Harry's robes and tugging, “Look.” He points, and Harry follows his finger until he notices the same thing he had.
He can’t wait to go back home for Yule with his new extremely dubious bagpipe skills. Sirius and Remus are going to hate it.
“Did you see the cover of Witch’s Weekly?” Blaise offers. “Apparently, Harry has a harem. That consists of the entirety of the Gryffindor house. They quoted Finnigan, and of all the people to impersonate, I don’t understand why they chose him.”
“Was behind it all,” he snaps, “I hope you’re proud.”
“I would have passed the auror exams!” Sirius protests. “I just didn’t have time. There was a war on, you know.”
He jerks his eyes open, not sure when he closed them. “You’re supposed to say it back, you know.” He’s not worried about it, but it’s the principal of the matter. He told Harry he loves him, so Harry should say it back.
She sighs, but also dries his hair with a wave of her wand.
here? Who let you in?”
Somehow Ron and Hermione get shuffled over to the center of the room, and someone loudly asks a question about the dementor attack. It takes a beat, but then Hermione begins to answer. At the same time, Percy and Tonks materialize seemingly out of nowhere and guide him back through to the kitchen while everyone’s focused on hearing about the fight in Diagon Alley.
Making everyone wear uniforms should theoretically make things easy, but instead how carefully people ignore the dress code and to what lengths is scrutinized viciously. Pansy hasn’t been altering her clothes since she was twelve just for the fun of it. She’s been making a
Pansy shrugs. “Now that his parents know and Voldemort’s not quite as present of a threat, I doubt he’ll be too concerned. It’s not like he enjoyed it.”
He hears the yelling first, and it’s so surprising he stops in his tracks. It’s – it’s not people, but house elves. Why would house elves be yelling? Did someone burn dinner?
me about it. What did you think Madame Hana was doing with you anyway, having a friendly chat?”
He doesn’t give a shit what Cedric said. He yanks Harry so he stumbles and knocks into him, and Draco’s kissing him in the next moment. “Can it wait?” he asks, minutes later when Harry pulls away just so the both of them can breathe.
Draco is frowning, but he shrugs off his shirt and tosses it aside. “It looks worse than it feels.”
“That they’re a professor,” Cedric says grimly. “Right. We’ll go on together, and hopefully find Fleur. What about Viktor?”
Cassius pales, then grabs the front of his robes and yanks him inside before slamming the door shut. Completely unnecessary. Draco would have come inside of his own volition if he’d asked. “Who have you told?”
Winky silently passes him a bowl of freshly mashed flesh eating slugs, and he adds it into the scar softening salve he’s brewing. It’s exactly the right amount and consistency. She really is picking this up quickly. At this rate, she’s not even going to need his help to make potions.
“Yeah,” Harry agrees, but he’s assuming it comes out fonder than he intended by the way Ron retches and tries to smother him with his pillow.
Which means that if someone’s going to the effort to take the head, it’s probably to protect themselves against Harry specifically. No one else would be powerful enough. Well, no one else anywhere near Hogwarts, unless they expected Dumbledore to call in another favor with the other Mothers he knows, but that’s just as bad.
for it still remain flexible enough to change dimensions-”
It takes a long time to finish, not-healing not only all the places where the body had been sliced open to get to the bones but reattaching the limbs, which involves connecting significantly more flesh than just closing wounds. By the time he finishes his whole body is sore and he’s drenched in sweat and it feels like the scent of decay is clinging to every each of him. He’d be more upset about it if he wasn’t so
Considering how late he went to bed the night before, it’s way too early for him to be awake, but he can already tell that this is going to be another school year full of sleep deprivation, so there’s no reason not to get a head start.
There’s the soft sound of footsteps behind him. “Finally!” he exclaims, turning. “What took you so long?”
“Great, keep your mouth open wide,” Draco says, and cheerfully sticks his whole arm in her mouth so he can pour the healing potion down her throat, then another, then another.
“Harry is my soulmate,” he says, the first time he’s said those words out loud to anyone since he told Pansy and Blaise years ago, and it’s a rush, it feels like falling. “I understand the importance of secrets, I really do, and I’ll keep yours.”
“Goodnight,” he echoes, but Blaise falls back asleep just as quickly as he’d woken. Draco’s an expert at sneaking through the castle at this point, so he barely hesitates as he walks through the halls. Although, technically, he doesn’t have to sneak. Since he’s a prefect, curfew doesn’t apply to him anymore. That still doesn’t mean he wants to have to explain himself.
“No one is making fun of you,” Draco says, and Blaise nods, looking startled she thought otherwise. “You look great, Pansy did a great job.”
She blinks. “Excuse me?”
Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake’s language pass his lips, and this isn’t what he wants, what’s the point of insulting Malfoy if he can’t understand him –
So he has a lot going on right now, obviously, which is why he’s panicking a little bit. Not about all that stuff, he’s handling it just fine, more or less. But his boyfriend’s birthday is rapidly approaching, and he’s struggling to finish his present.
She’s sitting on a stool, working on some embroidery work for Cho’s wedding dress, her head bent over her needlework instead of looking up at him. “What is idiotic master needing from his lowly house elf, who is clearly so unimportant that he can not be telling her when he goes running off to do stupid things?”
him to use magic during the summer, it’s why he’s so burned out all the time. Seamus’s dad’s a muggle, and he always wants to see what his son has learned, so his mom lets him doing a demonstration before taking away his wand for the summer. And, I mean, we all used our parents’ wands growing up. Not often! But, well, no one casts their first spell in Hogwarts.”
Lucius shakes his head, but in disgust rather than denial. “What a waste of ink. It’s unfortunate that so many of them are just incompetent rather than actively criminal.”
Pansy ignores him, and taps her wand against her hand, considering. “Yes,” she says, “on one condition.”
Percy’s felt that way, that for all he loves and is loved by his family there are moments when he feels separated from them. But Tonks is a metamorphmagus, and he feels extra silly for asking her that question.
They both shake their heads, and Draco relaxes a little at their vehemence. “Does this mean we need to start being nice to the Gryffindorks?” Pansy asks.
They talk the practical aspects of his latest invention until his pocket is vibrating again, and he doesn’t bother to answer it, instead walking down the hall to open the doors to the magical maladies department.
Black shakes his head and croaks, “I thought the same. They wanted to make it you after I refused, and I told them not to.”
Luna doesn’t look up from reading, but makes a similar sound of agreement.
It’s hard to get everyone to focus during Rabitat Aldefa, but Harry can’t blame them for that. It’s the day before Christmas break, and for once he’s just as eager for it as his friends. He’s so excited to go home and see Sirius and Remus, and the Weasleys and Hermione are coming over to spend Christmas with them. It’s going to be
Tonks buries her face in her hands, shoulders shaking. Percy takes one of the scrolls off the table and starts whacking her with it. She can’t contain herself after that, her bubbly laughter erupting and filling the dining room. “What are you laughing about?” he demands. “We could be living comfortably, we could have had a lovely apartment in Horizon Alley, and instead our best bet is signing the lease for a closet with horribly loud neighbors that smells of cabbage.”
Draco eats the last of the biscuit and dusts off his hand. “Come on, hurry up, the last thing we need is to be caught lurking in the girls’ bathroom.”
The last thing in the world he wants to do is to listen to is Draco and the Weasley twins argue about semantics.
She’s watching him closely, and the struggle on his face must be all the confirmation she needs, because she slumps and puts her hand to her head. “Harry-”
That night, Harry is running late coming from Hagrid’s, and he had in fact made Harry rock cakes and pat him on the back and let Fang slobber all over him. None of that should make him feel better at being forced to participate the death tournament, but it does. He expects to be the last one to arrive at their abandoned classroom. But he gets there and looks around their classroom in confusion. “Where are Ron and Draco?”
“If Fudge is going to jail, does that mean Dumbledore is going to be minister, since he’s the Supreme Mugwump?” He hopes not, even if he’d be good at it, he’s a little too removed from the consequences of his actions for Harry’s taste.
he’s going to explode. Draco doesn’t say anything, only fixes what he can once Harry is done and banishes the rest.
Pansy makes a face, then says, “I suppose they are both from Tamil Nandu. I don’t think that’s enough to get their attention, even with his fame. Harry, were any of your ancestors connected to the spell dancers?” He doesn’t get further than raising his eyebrow before she rolls her eyes and says, “Yes, right, you don’t know, or course. You should ask Sirius or Remus if they know. Or try and look it up, there has to be records of that somewhere.”
“I speak what?” he asks.
“He wouldn’t have to. I wouldn’t get caught,” he says, and Harry can feel his anger, in the tenseness of his muscles and the way his voice rumbles in his chest. “I can be creative if I want to be.” Harry’s well aware of that, and it’s one of the many reasons he’s glad Ron is his friend. But it also means it’s possible Ron does how to properly dispose of a body, and just hasn’t brought it up because it hasn’t been relevant. He would kind of like if it would continue to not be relevant, personally.
“She made the right decision,” Draco says, and only shrugs when Harry glares at him. “What did you expect me to say? It’s a
They’re walking a little in front of everyone else, so Draco nudges him in the side, trying not to pull attention to it but also not wanting to let it lie either. “Hey.”
He’s finally allowed to look in the mirror, and the square of cloth has formed itself into a robe. It falls down so it almost touches the floor, and the sleeves are long and billowing. It doesn’t clasp in the middle, instead sticking to his sides so the front of the suit is still on full display even while it maintains the proper robe shape and silhouette.
“He doesn’t understand,” Anastasia says. “I don’t understand. What are you talking about? I don’t know who you were worried overhearing you if you’re going to be this vague.”
“Shut up,” she tells them, but doesn’t deny where all her hard earned money is going to go. “I like it here, it’s lovely, but if I spend all summer shut inside I’ll go mad.”
need them, because I was a metamorphmagus, what kind of shitty metamorphmagus needed potions to change their appearance? But it doesn’t work like that, obviously. So he marched me to Madam Pomfrey and demanded a potions regiment be set up for me, and that I be prohibited from using my abilities until my magic had recovered from the strain.”
She says it as a joke, but now the air around them is very awkward, and Quinn is starting to look outraged, and he really doesn’t want them to get in a fight in the middle of the great hall about Snape’s political leanings. Because he is a Death Eater, but he’s a Death Eater for Dumbledore, so it’s. Fine. He thinks.
Harry comes rushing into class, barely avoiding being late. He stops in front of the Slytherin half, blinking. The look of exasperated irritation his soulmate gives him isn’t staged at all, and he’d start laughing if it wasn’t undignified. “See something you like, Potter?”
“To represent you in court, of course,” he answers. “You don’t need a lawyer. According to the law, you’re guilty, and everyone knows it. You need a performer.”
,” the three of them chorus.
Not being able to send his parents letters that say anything beyond boring generalities is frustrating for a number of reasons. His life would be so much easier if he could just
“About bloody time!” Flitwick snaps. “What took you so long?”
Lucius tries to gasp out a response, but Voldemort’s crucio is still leaving him breathless and unable to speak. Draco hates this, he hates that he can’t do anything but stand here and watch this. But even if he was stupid enough to try and cross wands with Voldemort, he knows he wouldn’t last a minute in a room full of Death Eaters.
“Hermione,” Ron says reproachfully, “when have we ever tried to improve Snape’s mood?”
“Draco did manage to steal most of the high society gossip for himself,” Pansy interjects, “but thanks to Harry, you guys did manage to make the front page. A few of them, actually.”
“Ginny’s going to be so mad when she hears about this,” Millie mutters.
. But staying on his good side is what keeps Dad safe, and Voldemort will end up here anyway, he’ll force his way in if we don’t invite him. So we should invite him.”
“Where are you going?” he asks, taking her hand. She places his other hand on her back, and rests her own on his shoulder.

“I was. But Susan wants to use me a media ploy, and I agreed. Luna really wants to go, and I don’t want her going with just anyone. I’d push her on Longbottom, but he’s already taking Ginny.”
. The muggles have really messed up a lot of their seven seas, so the queens have been away for the past fifty or so years trying to deal with that. In the meantime, Prince Akeakamai has been the regent of the two unplottable seas, and the diplomatic face of the merpeople for that time too. The queens don’t show up unless something is really wrong.”
“Thanks!” Hermione says genuinely while Ron pulls a face.
Draco raises an eyebrow, because he’s never known Harry to be turn up his nose at anything, never mind an extremely expensive wedding, but then he realizes that he’s serious. He really does think it’s nice, and that’s probably the sum total of his opinion. “Don’t let Amos hear you say that,” he says fondly.
“Three hours and twelve minutes,” she answers promptly, “I wouldn’t recommend trying to sleep more before tonight. You don’t have enough time to complete another sleep cycle and meet with your friends before the party.”
Hagrid pushes Buckbeak away before he can attack again, but there’s already a puddle of red underneath Draco, who’s trying to struggle to his knees. Millicent takes off her robe and presses it against the slashes, and it’s soaked with blood in an alarmingly short amount of time, “He needs the hospital wing!” she cries. “Hagrid!”
“Or maybe if we’re attacked by a swarm of rogue dementors? Although that’s less likely now, considering I killed most of them.” She gapes, mouth opening and closing silently. “You’re welcome,” he adds, because there’s really no point in doing this halfway.
As if he’s had the time to learn that in all his spare time. Besides, he promised the Patils that he’d let them teach him Hindi next, and he’s pretty sure breaking a promise to Parvati ends in disembowelment. “All Mothers speak dead languages,” he says, “with a little help.”
“She wants you to stop pointing your wands at her, and for everyone to relax,” Harry reports.
“Oh,” he says, and figures, hey, he has nothing left to lose. “Can I ask you question that’s none of my business?”
“You will be seeing Master Draco tomorrow,” she says, “You should be asking him that then.”
A little color returns to her cheeks. The glowing along her chest isn’t as bright, and it’s grown patchy around her chest and neck where the leeches are draining her blood.
“I don’t know any,” she says as he walks to his dormitory.
“You did a little more than help,” he says dryly. He takes the seat next to Harry and nods to the snake on their kitchen table. “Who’s this?”
“No more games,” he pants, turning his back on Fleur and aiming his wand at Harry. “Avada–”
Draco crosses his arms, “He shouldn’t go alone! What if the classroom is dangerous? Or something goes wrong with the floo?”
Remus ruffles his hair, then pushes him towards the bike. “Take it for a spin.”
Harry loves quidditch. Loves the competition, the ticking clock, being part of a
They already know about Draco. There’s no point in holding anything else back. “Voldemort and his followers are staying at Malfoy Manor. Draco’s been spying on their meetings, and then he writes everything up and sends it to me in his letters. You can’t tell anyone that they’re staying at the manor either. I’ll mention it at the next meeting if you want, say I saw Voldemort talking to Mr. Malfoy about it.”
Draco knows he’s joking, but he still leans over to kiss the edge of his jaw. “I’m a snake and I like you.”
It’s really good to be back at Hogwarts.
He frowns, trying to decide if he’s offended or not. “I’ll make a good barrister. I have the grades for it. You know I do.”
“Finally!” Blaise says as soon as he steps inside, “He won’t tell us anything, maybe he’ll tell you!”
There’s a beat where no one speaks.
He feels the weight of four incredulous pairs of eyes on him.
,” she says. “I guess. Somewhere. Probably. You’d think he’d be with us if he was here. Like attracts like after all.”
Harry rolls his eyes.
Percy doesn’t bat an eyelash. “Yes, Dora, I’m proposing. In the middle of an Order meeting, sitting down, with no ring.”
“Hey, Lils, over here!” someone calls out, and for a moment Harry turns and thinks he’s looking at his double.
Lucius doesn’t take the opportunity to run, or get out of the way, which Harry thinks would have been the smarter play. Instead he uses Voldemort’s momentary distraction to curl his right hand into a fist, takes a step away, pulls his arm back, and punches him as hard as he can right in the middle of his flat nosed face.
“Oh, except for the initial protego powerful enough to protect a panel of judges from a pissed off half veela,” Blaise says.
“It’s nothing,” he says, picking up silverware once more, but he doesn’t make any move to continue eating his food. After a moment of silence, he adds, “He knew my father.”
Sitting up has pretty thoroughly exhausted him, and what he really wants to do is go back to sleep. He turns pleading eyes on Ron, who rolls his eyes, but says, “Sure, whatever.”
Cedric smirks, like he knows exactly what he’s thinking. “It’s okay, I don’t mind if it’s you. I’ve met my soulmate, and it’s not Eun-hae. My soulmate is – nice. She’s an auror, and from an old family, and my dad was thrilled about the whole thing. But we’re not together, and we’re not planning to ever be together.”
Draco thinks there’s some sort of mystery or conspiracy going on that’s somehow connected to Snape’s career trajectory, and for once Harry has zero interest in sticking his nose into something, because he doesn’t care and he doesn’t want to care.
He wants to ask why it even matters if they match, but he can just tell that that will be the beginning to a whole different type of lecture that he doesn’t have the energy to endure. So instead he says nothing, and listens as Pansy lectures him on the proper way to turn a mouse into teacup.
Remus stares. “How would you know? You lived off your trust fund.”
He pushes Harry out of the way and leaves the shed, nose in the air. Harry should maybe be worried about how good of a look arrogant is on his soulmate.
It must surprise her, because she laughs, and relaxes. “I could always use more friends,” she says, easing back into herself and releasing her death grip on Draco’s arm.
Ginny rolls her eyes, “Relax. Draco invited Luna, and she invited me. Draco was real pissy about it.”
“Oh no,” he deadpans. “People finding out I’m romantic with my girlfriend. The horror.”
“The Yokuts in America. They’re fantastic at material manipulation. Do you think they could do this one too?” He’s going to have to talk to his parents about this, or get some investors or something. His investment portfolio is doing pretty good, but even he’s not sure he has the money for that even if he drained it.
by the course this conversation had taken. “I’m always up for a game,” he says, and cracks a grin when Ron whoops in delight.
“I did,” she confirms.
“It was our pleasure,” Perenelle says, her dark, heavy gaze resting on Ron, who doesn’t seem to notice. He nudges Hermione with elbow and then he’s gone, seemingly unaware of the weight of the Flamels’ gazes on him.
Yeah. That was an interesting afternoon and all, but it wasn’t exactly being tied to a gravestone and forced to fight Voldemort and all his Death Eaters.
So it’s really for the best that he never gets the opportunity.
“We haven’t learned any preservation charms that strong,” he points out.
He knows exactly what she means, and she’s right. He’s done that type of large magic before, and it’s always left him exhausted.
They all focus on the ground as they see a glint of gold rise into the air, darting around them. Clarence’s magically enhanced voice reaches them in the air, although now that Harry looks down, he can see he’s not alone. Lee has apparently shown up to offer commentary. Brilliant. “Fliers,” Clarence says, “begin!”
He can’t appreciate her look properly, because he’s just realized something, and he’s trying to stand in the next moment, but he doesn’t get very far, Poppy using her deceptive strength to grab his shoulders and shove him back into bed. “Where do you think you’re going?”
Cho and Cedric are laughing, and Harry waves goodbye to everyone as Ron drags him away.
Narcissa’s hair is in a complicated updo and she’s in tight dark blue robes which fall off her shoulders. She’s got teacup and saucer in her hand, and she looks neither impressed nor surprised to see any of them bobbing around in her lake. “Hello, Harry dear.”
“Something on my face?” Draco asks, teasing, as he walks over. He holds out a hand to pull him to his feet then tugs on the bottom of Harry’s shirt, pulling it up over his head and tossing it aside. He reaches for his pants next, hooking his thumb under his jeans and underwear tugging them down over Harry’s hips until they pool at his ankles so he can step out of them and step even closer to Draco.
She turns to him, and beams. “Thanks! I had Lavender help me apply the relaxer potion, she uses it way more than me.”
It’s then that he finally notices the kiss marks all down his neck, and several pieces fall into place at once. “Merlin’s balls,” he says, “you’re sleeping with Cassius?” No wonder he’d been so concerned about Draco going into his room before.
The sink lowers into the ground, and Harry blows Myrtle a kiss before jumping down the massive pipe. He hears Draco laugh before following him, and he’s smiling even as he rolls onto the ground.
“You guys should meet us at Florean’s,” Ron says. “We can harass Harry, and besides ice cream for lunch is what dreams are made of.”
Fleur shifts so she’s sitting on her broom, but sideways, one dainty leg thrown over the other. The transition is so smooth that Harry doesn’t even realize it’s happened until it’s over. “You do much better than many others! But it is not your strength.”
“Oh,” he says, shoulders drooping. “Yeah, that’s fine.”
Oh, good. Harry’s about to start explaining when they hear the screaming. It’s faint, like it’s coming from outside. Dean presses his face to the window and says, “Er, guys.”
“Of course we will,” Millie says brusquely. “You’d do the same for us, wouldn’t you?” It’s a redundant question, because of course he would, because Hagrid at his worst is still better than most people at their best.
“Crucio!” Voldemort casts again, as if he thinks the first time didn’t have enough power behind it. It hits her once more in the chest, and she rocks back at the force of it, but all she does is tremble, as if she's stayed out too long in the cold. Voldemort stalks forward, grabbing Narcissa’s chin and forcing her to look up at him and for her curtain of pale hair to fall back from her face. She’s not even biting her lip, showing no signs of strain. “Won’t you scream for me, Narcissa?”
“Are we just going to leave this like this?” Blaise asks.
“That doesn’t explain anything,” he says irritably. “That makes even less sense. Why would he go to all that trouble
He shrugs. “I’ll think of something, I always do.”
Harry spends the entire day barely keeping himself awake, and he’s really going to need to take a pepper up potion if he doesn’t want to die on the quidditch pitch. He’d noticed Slytherins wearing badges, but all his classes were with Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs so he hadn’t really been paying attention to them. He’d been preoccupied with the more pressing concern of not falling asleep in the middle of transfiguration, and the secondary concern of making sure Ron doesn’t vibrate out his skin from the anxiety he’s doing a poor job at hiding.
“See what?” he asks. He means for it to come out as irritated, but Draco’s too pale and there are lavender bruises beneath his eyes, which isn’t unusual, but him not glamoring them away is, so mostly it comes out as plaintive.
They play and talk the whole way back to London, the air between them easier than it has before, because unlike every other time they’ve done this, it’s not their last little bit of time together before the end.
“That would be me!” The voice sounds familiar, and he turns around to see the auburn haired witch from the Wizengamot in the same muted silver robes. “Really, Zaira, you almost gave half of them aneurisms, was that really necessary?”
“No problem,” Ginny answers.
Remus rolls his eyes. “He didn’t send that either. Are you just supposed to guess?”
It’s an iris, a deep purple with a stripe of vibrant yellow down each petal. It’s gorgeous, the petals perfectly formed and more beautiful than any real iris he’s seen. He hadn’t know a flower could suggest arrogance until now. He has to swallow down the sudden burst of hysterical laughter, because he’s afraid if he starts he won’t be able to stop.
Hagrid hesitates, twisting his hands in the front of his shirt, looking more like a nervous first year than anything else. “I - I had to. He’s, he’s slow. The other giants were bein’ mean ta him. It wasn’t right.”
Harry doesn’t know anything about fashion, but he knows that he’s never seen Cho more beautiful. He thinks she’d be beautiful no matter what, but the dress certainly doesn’t hurt.
Oh. Right.
Draco had scoffed and made fun of him, and brought back two packs of sugar quills and a dozen delicately made marzipan candies in the shape of marigolds, the same flowers Draco has on his hip. It’s in a thick box with silk ribbon, and there’s no way Draco got it at Honeyduke’s, which means he went to some sort of snobby specialty shop just to get it for him.
, obviously. I asked a group of second years, and they said you made them.”
He’s sort of aware that that’s a flawed way of thinking and that if he told his friends his reasoning then they’d yell at him for it, so instead he just decides to keep his reasoning to himself.
, in a way all his other hazily pleasant memories aren’t.
She sighs, but says, “It’s not what they do, Mr. Potter, but how they do it. For example, whether I strangle you or use a suffocating jinx, you die just the same.”
She scowls, but switches to Tamil. “
Draco’s quite for a moment, then he says, “The way you talk about breaking into a prison and destroying anything that gets in your way is really hot.”
“Swimming,” he says, “You’ve never been to a beach, have you? Let’s go swimming.”
Draco knows him so well. They’ve worked so, so hard to know each other this well. They certainly hadn’t known each other at all those first few years, saying one thing and hearing another and misunderstanding each other constantly.
He messily pulls his hair into a bun, already having decided to spend the morning finishing his essay so he can drop it off with Flitwick and Pomfrey and be done with it. They can fight amongst themselves whether he’s submitting it to a medial journal or the Charms Review because he refuses to have an opinion about it.
“He never had a home,” Harry says. Ron stretches so his lower leg presses against Harry’s, which means he’s doing a horrible job of hiding the wave of sadness that crashes through him.
Harry laughs out loud when he sees it, but he has no idea what Blaise is planning. They find out everyone in their year and above got one, a tiny slip of paper that seemingly just materialized in their hands. Ron must see his confusion, because he claps him on the shoulder and says, “House elves. They must have recruited a couple of the castle ones.”
It’s not like he cares, but. “You could drop them off at the Ministry.” Before he’s even finished speaking, he realizes the problem in that. “If they’re not alive, they can’t talk, meaning they can’t implicate us.”
“Good thing we stopped the wards from eviscerating her then,” he says, and Harry hopes he’s not being literal.
After he’s dressed, he concedes that it’s possible that there’s a possibility that Harry’s going to consider this to be more a punishment than a reward, since Draco refuses to leave the before midnight. They’re throwing the party, he can’t skip it, no matter what Harry says.
His gag is removed and his wand is shoved back into his hand. The ropes holding him to the gravestone slip to the ground, and he doesn’t realize his legs are asleep until he tries to step forward and falls to his knees.
Hagrid slips into the forbidden forest, and no one thinks for a second that they’ll be able to catch him in there, not at night anyway. Harry expects them to give up.
Theophania swings her massive head around to look at him. She bares her fangs, the venom dripping off of them and landing precariously close to where he’s standing. “
“Holy shit,” Dean breathes. “Ron, I never thought I’d say this, but your brother is a bit of a badass.”
Ron and Ginny nod once and then as one they all bolt for the kitchen door.
Draco has to admit that Neville is a surprisingly good teacher, and he and Blaise make an excellent team. When he’s not having a mental breakdown in potions class, he’s almost normal.
The tentative happiness working its way up his chest dies in his throat. “Oh, I – thank you, but I can’t. I – my parents and I aren’t really speaking right now.” They would sign, he knows that, they wouldn’t hold it over his head or hold it against him. But it would be giving up too much ground for him to lose, and he wants this so bad it hurts, but not enough to go back on what he said, what he meant.
Cho nods, eyes wide. “Draco, that’s wonderful!”
Harry lazes around until noon, at which point he’s allowed to go upstairs to his own party. He’s more excited about his godfathers seeing the greenhouse than he is about his own celebration, and it shows.
Ron sighs and lets go of Harry’s robes, slumping down at an awkward angle and rubbing the back of his neck. “I was afraid you’d say that.”
“We’re serious,” George insists, “we need a new strategy. I think we should focus on knocking Malfoy off his broom. We’ll keep an eye on everything, of course, but Harry doesn’t need our help against Flora. If anything, we’ll just be keeping the Slytherin beaters off him. Malfoy is going to be an actual problem this season.”
Bill nods. “Even if he hadn’t, Gryffindor’s line has been dead for centuries. But after his death his son refused to give the sword up, and then at one point it went missing, so it’s just been like this ever since. Goblins stopped taking wizard commission once they didn’t get the sword back when it was owed and that’s the end of it. Of course, most wizards don’t recognize that something can be paid for and used by an individual without actually belonging to them, so most of them don’t even acknowledge that the goblins have a reason for all this.”
Since he holidays are just around the corner, he can’t blame everyone for being distracted. He’s distracted too. “Okay, that’s enough,” he sighs, after seeing a bunch of lackluster spells. Everyone stops casting and falls silent. “What can we work on that you guys will actually be able to concentrate on? If we’re all not focusing, we might as well be in bed.”
By the time she’s finished doing as he says, she’s almost entirely calmed down. Harry is impressed. “Where did you learn to do that?”
Ron shrugs, “Werewolves are stronger than the rest of us, even when they haven’t transformed. They’re faster too, and they have a temper.” He scratches his chin, “Then again, Lupin doesn’t really have a temper. At all. I don’t think I’ve ever heard him raise his voice, honestly.”
“Well,” he says, “the rest of the scores are a bit high, aren’t they? It’s not like my end of year scores look like that.”
“But,” Catalina says, “what if he doesn’t believe you?”
“Let’s go save Snape,” Ron says firmly, shaking out his hand. “Fuck. Okay.”
“Miss Edgecombe!” McGonagall gasps, “How did this happen?”
Fred thrusts the book back at him. “Well, why don’t you ask?”
They disappear with a crack, and Hermione snarls. Ron searches Harry’s face, nods once, then snags her elbow and drags her towards Theophania. “Come on, let’s go.”
There’s smattering of horrified laughter. Umbridge’s eyes narrow. “Mr. Potter, that’s quite enough. You-Know-Who is dead, I won’t have this sort of fear mongering ridiculousness occur in my classroom.”
He struggles for a moment, managing to somehow turn an even deeper shade of red. “Yes. And that’s all I’m saying about it.”
Snakes can’t sigh, but Theophania still gives the impression of doing just that. “
He enters his and Blaise’s as quietly as he can, and has unbuttoned his pajama shirt when he realizes the sling is going to make all of this more difficult. He walks over to Blaise’s bed and pokes him in the shoulder with his wand, then takes three steps back.
“How do you even know about that?” he whines. “You’ve been here! This whole time! No way Poppy let you get out of bed looking like that.” Wait, that’s it. “Poppy told you?”
Fleur ignores him and goes up to Ron, giving him a kiss on each cheek and then doing the same to Harry. Hermione just manages to stop glaring in time for Fleur turns and grabs her in a bear hug. She’s shorter than Hermione, but that doesn’t stop her from lifting her off the ground. “Friends! I’ve missed you!”
Except for that time they – well, he assumes Harry wasn’t exactly paying attention to the contents of his desk then either.
Draco, personally, is getting real tired of the Dark Lord’s shit.
Draco doesn’t take his eyes or wand off Lupin, but he wants to, and
The boy blinks, then grins, putting his hand over hers. “Hi Lily. I’m Severus.”
. He isn’t used to having this much free time, and he has no idea what to do with it.
Daphne breaks the heavy silence by clearing her throat. “We’re here if you have any questions or concerns. These are uncertain times. But first and foremost, this is a school, not a battleground. If you have any social or personal concerns, or even if you just need some help with your coursework, we’re here to help.”
“I’m beginning to feel like a glorified messenger boy,” Harry grumbles one night at the start of October. He takes Hermione’s charms essay from Draco that’s positively dripping in green corrections, and hands him his arithmancy project that has enough red that it looks like someone bled on it.
They slam into each other, Fleur falling to her knees and wrapping her arms around Gabrielle, who buries her face in her sister’s chest.

“Except he could have,” Harry continues. Slughorn was a Mother. A Mother doesn’t linger in the mortal plane after death,
George shrugs, “Bill was with Ginny and Percy, and Charlie went with Dad. We need to get back.”
Remus catches Lucius’s eye. “Chess?” Lucius makes a face. “There’s also darts and scotch in the games room.”
The inside of the carriage is much bigger than it looks like on the outside. It contains over one hundred rooms for the students, a kitchen, and a common room. Saida leads him down twisting hallways, and he waves at the people he recognizes – which is most of them, actually. Just his luck that Saida was the one to answer the door.
“I’ll go last,” he says, “First Catalina and Dumbledore, then Slughorn and Sharon, and then Nanaia and I will go together last so she can keep the trance going until the last moment.”
Sophia hesitates and he does
It takes Cedric several minutes to answer, pulling his head out of the binder to blink at him. It looks like a seating arrangement chart. Cho is doing math, but it he doesn’t think it’s schoolwork. He’s pretty sure it’s a budget. “What?” Cedric asks after blinking at him slowly for several moments.
Something dark flashes across Lucius’s face, but before he can question it, Lucius leans forward and presses a kiss to his forehead, a gesture Draco associates more with his mother than his father. “Be careful. Please. Stay out of the way as much as you can.”
Title is from this quote: "I told her once I wasn't good at anything. She told me survival is a talent.” ~ Susanna Kaysen, from Girl, Interrupted.
“Don’t be like that, it’s time to put all of your mother’s training to use!” he says cheerfully.
This is how the Chimera Map is born.
“Okay,” he says, because of course he does.
“Tell her not to eat me,” he says, blithely pulling off loose and damaged scales.
“Actually, yes,” he admits, which Draco hadn’t been expecting. “You did very well today. Much better than I was expecting.”
? Is that even possible?”
Harry shrugs, and only doesn’t laugh because that would mess up his breath control. Which he doesn’t
It’s a wasted effort. He turns the corner to a dementor right on top of him, rattling breath and creeping cold over his skin.
She stands behind Draco, settling her hands on his shoulders. She can’t help with this, healing is never something she’d been able to do, so she’d never learned. But she’s not trying to stop him anymore. He can manage one more spell, maybe, and he can’t use episkey again if he doesn’t want it to backlash. “Ementur lignum carnum,” he mutters, lightly tracing his wand over the wounds on his father’s chest and stomach, where most of the damage probably is. It’s a more advanced spell than he should probably be doing, but what’s he’s already done isn’t enough, he’s only slowed his father’s advance to death, not stopped it.
“You really will die if you try, I feel the need to reiterate that,” he says. “But fine.”
“Being a Mother is a lonely journey,” Catalina drapes an arm around his shoulders to give him a brief squeeze, “but that doesn’t mean you have to walk it alone.”
He definitely doesn’t deserve her suspicious stare, he’s done absolutely nothing to warrant it. “My dear Fleur, we’ll celebrate now amongst ourselves. But tonight? We’re throwing a
“Here, let me,” Harry starts but is cut off with a snarl.
“I’d be dead a hundred times over if it wasn’t for people helping me,” Harry says. “So what? Get the trophy, and end this stupid tournament. We have to make sure Fleur and Victor are all right.”
Draco makes an appointment with his account manager and whines at Filius until he agrees to let him use his floo. She’s also his parent’s account manager, and he really shouldn’t be as nervous about this as he is. Elda is downright friendly by goblin standards.
Lavender gets to her feet, “It sounds fun! Where’s your sense of adventure, Neville?”
“He did, actually,” Harry looks to the entrance to the great hall, then morosely back at his overloaded plate. “He didn’t really mean the ugly thing. He talks about Abigail like that too.”
He shrugs. “Not really. I mean, worst case scenario, we just move to France, right?”
“Gladly,” Hermione says, raising her wand and casting, “Mobilicorpus!”
“The teapot, dear,” Lucius says blandly. It’s also silver.
The laughter is much harder to ignore now. He sniffs and looks down at his book. “I have a boyfriend.”

For a moment, nothing happens.
“Not here,” Draco mutters.
Arthur claps Harry on the shoulder, “Best of luck with your militia of teenagers.”
“I’ll show you when you get back,” he says. “It’s not going to go any faster with you watching me, and I know you worked through lunch yesterday. There are laws against that you know.”
“It wasn’t just your book then,” he says, trying to push the image of the man’s eyes out of his mind.
Once everyone reaches the edge of the wards, they’ll be able to apparate out, and that just won’t do. But he can’t reasonably stop all of them at once.
Malfoy is smirking at him like he’s

can we?” Harry presses. “It has to be because he’s changed, because I haven’t, but I don’t really think he’s changed either.”
Neville slaps Harry upside the head. “You astral projected? That’s illegal!”
Winky drops him back off just before dawn, and he crawls back into bed exhausted and content and
“Any more is too dangerous,” he says. “For the both of us.”
They got silent. They hadn’t gotten that far.
has sat like that with Harry before, there’s nothing inappropriate about it. But – if there was – would he be allowed to get mad at that? He thinks of Charlie asking if he had a boyfriend at the train station, and – does he? Draco is his soulmate, but does that mean they’re boyfriends? Are they just dating my default? Or – are they – not?
Pansy raises an eyebrow, and she’s still got her ice queen face on. “You know that none of us will be able to attend, right?”
His boyfriend’s face swims onto the glass a moment later. Draco can’t tell where he is, but it looks dark. “Are you still at work?”
“That sounds nice,” Cho says wistfully.
Theophania is watching him from curled along the edges of the chamber with Abigail sitting on the crown of her head. Nagini is wrapped around the stool Winky is standing on, her head raised as she stares into the bright flames. She likes fire so much that sometimes he thinks that she might be part ashwinder, but even she’s keeping her distance.
There’s a pretty good chance that everyone will be too busy to answer their mirror right now, so he doesn’t waste time on it, instead going straight to the Gryffindor common room. “Password?” the Pink Lady asks.
“–that people are waiting,” she finishes, sighing. She pats him on the calf and then disappears with a pop.
Quinn smirks. “Aren’t you curious to see if you could do it? Just as a little?”
“Right, sorry Harry,” Slughorn says while Anastasia just looks put out. “This is just a little bit more difficult to explain than I’d anticipated, is all. I wish I’d been able to explain it before, especially when Albus sent us after the locket, but well, with the unbreakable vow it wasn’t really an option, you understand.”
The door flings itself open, and the casket pops out of it so quickly that a hasty cushioning charm is all the keeps it from crashing to the ground. It’s made of light color wood with iron handles, a very simple casket considering the wealth of the person inside it.
“That was a good class,” he says without thinking about it. “Did Snape seem less … himself to you guys?”
It’s Blaise. Who has what looks like every single dress shirt he owns piled in front of him as he methodically polishes the each button on each shirt. He must have summoned them from his closet since Draco knows he hasn’t stepped foot in their room since last night. Unless he’s brought them from home, which is even more concerning.
“Okay?” Hermione says. “I want the bad news first.”
He catches up with Cho on the other side of the maze. “What are you doing?” he asks, and she jumps a nearly a foot in the air.
He’ll never do it on his own, but he and Hermione could probably trick him into by just asking him basic alchemy questions and then writing down his answers. Ron probably wouldn’t even notice until the royalty checks hit. It’s not like he walks into a bookstore without Hermione.
“You don’t look like you’re enjoying yourself, is all,” he says, gesturing to the chessboard.
“She is probably at our seat, we are seated on the other side,” he says, pointing vaguely to the opposite side of the tent. “I am certain she was going to murder me for my ticket, but I was mostly just teasing her. She has been – intense, ever since her girlfriend broke up with her.”
“We can’t just run away with it and drop it off at Gringotts,” Ron says, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. He has the same look on his face as when he plays chess. “If we’re really trying to avoid another goblin war or just worsening the relationship between humans and goblins, then we have to make sure it can’t be tracked back to Hogwarts.”
“Your face is disgusting,” she says, emerging triumphantly from the fridge with a jar of pickles. She pauses, “I didn’t mean that, I like your face.”
“You’re kidding me,” he says flatly. “Can’t you undo it?”
They both squeal and jump to their feet, and Harry takes a step back in alarm. “You won’t regret it,” Padma promises. “You’ll look fantastic. Our grandmother is a weaver, we know what we’re doing.”
“That is not being the point!” she says, pushing her sewing to the side to get to her feet. “Master Draco should not be being so reckless with his own life! If he is being gone, where will I be? Where will Winky go without Master Draco?”
“I think I know you a little better than to fall for that act,” she says dryly, but then she hesitates. “Draco, I knew you weren’t like that before I knew you at all.”
“I’m driving,” he says, and when Harry opens his mouth to protest, adds, “Neither my hair nor my robes can handle doing flips through the air, and you will not be able to help yourself. I’m driving.”
“Hey!” He turns to glare at Ailauni. “You’re the one that attacked Nagini in the lake?”
He’s so tired. He wants to be with his boyfriend and his friends and eat a real meal. He wants to congratulate Sirius on being a free man and wait up for the results of the election results. He wants to go home and hug his parents.
Then it’s Harry’s turn.
Great. He likes both of them. “Well, how did everything else go? Besides the Umbridge bit.”
Cedric frowns. “Your
Harry raises an eyebrow. “Can you pick your books in twenty minutes?”
He kind of wants to be sick. This isn’t like making fun of Longbottom, or threatening the first years. This is real, and terrifying. “My father suggested heating the buttons and spreading the molten silver over your heart. Personally, I’m rather curious as to what would happen if I made you swallow them.” He feels like he’s about to vomit. He hopes it doesn’t show on his face. Threats aren’t particularly effective if he throws up at the thought of following through.
Draco ignores him, pulling out his wand and casting a quick diagnostic spell. The ward magic only extends to Ron’s wrists and not any farther, so worst case scenario he could cut of his hands. But that would probably be way harder to explain to Poppy than the wards in the first place, so maybe not. “Desciscendum,” he casts, but the wards don’t even loosen their grip. Great. He shouts, “Winky!”
But it’s Harry.
The door opens so suddenly that Draco narrowly avoids punching Asim in the face. “Keep it down!” he hisses.
There’s a smattering of muffled laughter, and Aiden, one of the first years, grins up at him and says, “You’re not my real dad.”
That doesn’t make any sense to Harry, but Pansy’s spine straightens. “Is that how you solved the directional problem?”
He waits, to see if he’s going to get any more sort of explicit permission, but she just keeps staring at him. “Okay,” he says, then takes a step closer to the body. No one moves to stop him so he keeps walking.
“Draco!” his dad says harshly, hands clenches into fists.
“I’m saying that it shouldn’t have been up to Percy Weasley to stop the whole country from collapsing in on itself, not matter how well he did it, and that unless there are some personnel changes, it won’t matter who the prime minister is, but I,” he pauses, rubbing his hand over his face again.
“I thought Nicolas Flamel was French?” a man Harry doesn’t know asks.
Great.
doesn’t change what you
“They said it was a legally binding contract?” he says, because surely if it was so easy they would have just let him out of it. No one was happy about him being the fourth champion, himself included.
They’re old enough that they can go to Hogsmeade without it being a designated weekend, but Harry asks Draco out on date on an official Hogsmeade weekend anyway.
On one hand, Draco never actually got around to completing the paper for his sky projections, and he did promise Filius that he would finish that up and submit it to the Charms Review. On the other hand, this is easily the coolest thing he’s ever made, and he has an uncharacteristic urge to tell everyone about it immediately. At least this time he mostly remembered to take notes and write down his reference materials as he went along, instead of having to back track and figure out what on earth he’d done after the fact.
Hermione’s quiet for a long moment and he thinks they’re getting somewhere, but she just shakes her head. “He didn’t interfere with my relationship with Viktor, so I’m not going to get involved with his relationship with Lavender.”
He could do with a little bit less math in their lives, honestly. This is a lot harder than having to fight a dragon or sneak into the ministry.
“Well, since you asked so nicely,” Lucius says.
Dumbledore stands, still saying nothing at all, just watching, waiting. Harry has no idea what he’s thinking.
There’s schoolwork, of course, but he mostly ends up doing his homework in class. He has to, if he expects to still have time to make his thrice weekly trips to Flitwick’s office, where he grades papers, summarizes articles on the latest charms breakthroughs, and generally does all the things an aide would do without officially being his aide. Officially, Draco just uses a lot of Flitwick’s office hours.
doesn’t feel heavy. He pushes himself up, which takes a lot more effort than it should, and he understands why.
Hermione still looks uncertain, but she nods. “Thank you for your time, Mip, Dal. I appreciate it.”
.” She slithers back over to the statue. Instead of the long and pompous incantation Voldemort had used, she simply tells it to open, and then disappears inside it.
“That’s not – I’ll gladly read your paper,” he sighs. “How long will this last before the spell needs to be reapplied again? Does it need to be corporal? I don’t know if I have the magic reserves to recast this all the time and do my normal shifts. I suppose I could call in some favors from the auror department.”
. It’s one thing for Draco and the rest of them to talk shit about their sour head of house, but it’s quite another to watch Umbridge do it to his face. Even Theodore, who kind of hates Snape for no reason Draco’s ever been able to pin down, is looking at Umbridge like he wishes he could kill her with his glare alone.
It never comes.
There’s another great echoing boom, and Draco’s really starting to panic when things go from bad to worse. The statue of Zarathurstra groans, and its mouth falls open.
Remus suddenly grabs onto Sirius’s shoulder, “Wait. Petrifying - during your second year - is Theophania - she’s not the basilisk.”
, much less someone like Voldemort.
She’s not mollified in the slightest. He catches Saida’s eye and she sighs, then shrugs. Apparently sometimes Fleur is just like this.
The train is moving by the time he makes it to their usual compartment, knocking twice against the door. It opens just enough to let him in, and then he’s yanked inside. The door slams shut, and he only has a moment to look at furious green eyes before he’s being kissed. Harry cups his face and presses him up against the door, and Draco grabs onto his boyfriend’s hips, trying to pull him impossibly closer. Harry’s taller. And thicker. There’s more muscle on him than there was the last time he had Harry in his arms.
Harry doesn’t think it will be that easy, but he hopes it will be. He hasn’t received nearly as much blowback as he was expecting for being a Parseltongue, so maybe he’s wrong. He’d like to be wrong.
Which, in hindsight, was probably a little too much.
She asks, “If I say no, you’re just going to continue to study on your own, aren’t you?”
“Flitwick?” Hermione demands.
“I’ll do the detentions, it’s fine. It’s not a problem, and I don’t want you trying to defend or help me, because I’m not planning on stopping,” he confesses. “She’s going to be awful no matter what, you have to know that. So I’m going to give her someone to be awful to. Better me than anyone else, better she focuses all her energy on me than sticking her nose into different parts of Hogwarts. Besides, getting to yell at a ministry stooge for being awful is probably good for me, or something. Cathartic.”
it. He doesn’t give a crap that Dumbledore is the headmaster, about his long list of accolades and titles, about any of it. If he thinks he can manipulate and push Draco around, he’s got another thing coming.
Harry
Lucius closes his eyes again, but not like he’s tired. Like he can’t bear to look at him. “I don’t know. I – he’s your age, and I just.” He makes a frustrated sound in the back of his throat, then sighs. He says, almost too softly for Draco to hear, “I want you to be proud of me. I want you to be proud to be my son.”
So instead he makes himself scarce. He’ll go find Luna and practice vanishing her shoes.
“Listen, merprinces don’t just kiss people willy nilly,” Draco says. “You said you were able to breathe underwater after he kissed you.”
She jabs him in the chest hard enough to bruise. “If you were any less brilliant on a broom, I’d murder you,” she says, then walks up the girls’ staircase before he can respond.
He doesn’t look on the edge of his seat.
“You all know what I think about divination,” Hermione says, and Ginny snorts, because the whole school knows how she feels about divination. Possibly all of magical Britain knows how she feels about divination. “But Ron has a point. Just because she can do, doesn’t mean that she can teach.”
He scrutinizes it for a long moment, before nodding and giving it back to Harry. “Severus, will you?”
“No.”
“Good,” Florean says. Then, “Can I ask you a question now?”
He doesn’t want to go back to the common room, doesn’t want to face all his housemates. They’d been cheering when his name got called, but no one else had, and – this doesn’t feel good, it doesn’t feel right. He’s getting tired of people congratulating him for things he didn’t do, for things he didn’t want to do. That’s why he likes quidditch. At least when people admire him for that, it’s because he’s earned it.
He’s just made up his mind to go to Hagrid, who will pat him on the back and give him rock cakes and let Fang slobber all over him, when someone grabs his elbow and yanks him down the corridor. He struggles for a second before he catches sight of bushy brown hair. “Hermione! What are you doing?”
The book remains stubbornly still. He gets the idea that now that he asked it to go from the beginning, it won’t move on until does as it says. “Mass reanimation.”
He looks down at his hands. He still has some mud stuck under there from quidditch practice. “Yeah, okay. No Slytherin colors.”
“It doesn’t say anything useful then,” he decides, “no clues about how we win this war and finally kill him? Does it even say if we win or not?”
“We is liking to be kept busy,” one of the castle elves, Dal, says, “Hogwarts is good, there are lots of messy children!”
She vanishes with a crack. Draco blinks. He hadn’t expected that, and has no idea how to react to it. Blaise yawns and says, “I can’t believe I just heard an elf say therefore.”
Harry doesn’t even glance at Pansy and Millie’s direction, instead getting stuck on him as he crosses the room to his side. That does help mollify his ego, even if Harry is clearly biased. He reaches out, running his hand through his hair just like Draco knew he would, then smoothing his hand down Draco’s back before attempting to slide into his back pocket, which is a nice but futile effort since the pockets are fake. Real pockets would ruin the lines, after all. Instead his hand settles on Draco’s hip, and he sees the exact moment that Harry registers the mesh underneath his hand.
Unbelievable. “
Watching their respective parents politely not glare at each other is very weird.
“I’m a prefect too, but that’s whatever,” he says, making notations on the exact wand movement he’d used to summon the ink out of someone’s skin. A half decent way to get rid of tattoos, probably, but a bit trickier when the ink was cursed to eat the person from the inside out. “Oh, and I’m a chaser on the quidditch team. And my boyfriend also runs this teenage militia study group thing that I’m in, but I’m not sure if we’re keeping up with that this year, I haven’t asked. I’m thinking I’ll drop divination to take care of magical creatures and just do the reading in my spare time.”
Percy isn’t phased. “Yes. She thinks werewolves should be euthanized. Since Azkaban isn’t secure anymore, she’s been trying to get Fudge to just give the remaining prisoners the death sentence. She wants the Ministry to remove all its money from Gringotts, which, in case you haven’t been paying attention in History of Magic, would absolutely start another Goblin War. Which she wants, because she wants to kill all the goblins, and she can’t really do that while they’re holding everyone’s money.” He pauses, taking a deep breath and visibly working to calm himself. “I’m sorry. I know she’s awful. Believe me, I know, and she’s only going to get worse. I’m sorry. But if she’s being difficult over there, it means she’s not trying to push forward policy that will end in innocent people dying.” Percy looks a lot older than he is just then, the flames making the dark circles under his eyes even darker, while making the rest of his face look washed out.
“Professor Snape,” Flitwick corrects while Pomfrey lets out a delicate cough that’s clearly a laugh. “Regardless, we were wondering if perhaps Pomfrey and I should start coordinating our efforts in regards to your independent studies.”
“Magic is not wanting to reside in the material,” Winky says, holding one of the failures in her hand. “Can you not be using a container?”
Blood should remain pure. Muggles and their ilk have no place in their world. But – Millie grew up without a mother, and she’s just as likely to get attacked as Granger or any other halfblood or muggleborn. Millie, who’s
Thank merlin. House elf magic is different, more slippery, but the incantation works just the same. He has to be extra careful when applying the healing charm, but thankfully it only resists him for a few moments before sullenly settling into Dobby’s skin and leaving his hands good as new.
“Right,” he says, then has to swallow twice because his mouth is dry. He presses his hand against the small of Draco’s back, and Draco holds onto his shoulder, while their other hands are pressed together. “Sorry I’m so bad at this.”
teaching you the spell and supervising your casting. I would also advise not to aid Quinn in any of zir experiments, but I imagine it’s too late for that particular wisdom to do you any good.”
Midway through the party, and after all parties involved have drank too much for it to be exactly safe, Fleur, Clarence, and Harry get on their brooms and glide above them. Someone, probably Fleur, had charmed Harry’s broom so that it let out a trail of colors like a real gliding broom. They clearly don’t have a picture in mind, but the three of them artfully glide through the air, making a pretty mix of colors and patterns. Everyone cheers, and if they were trying to be even a little bit subtle about this party, that’s now effectively out the window.
He’s assuming those would be the same dinner parties that used to give Neville panic attacks. “I’m sure that could be arranged.”
“No,” Ron says, “but hey, it’s a nice, uh, distraction?”
A bit of actual humor cracks through, and Sirius squeezes his hand. “I’m glad you’re okay, and that Voldemort isn’t rummaging around in your head. But I am worried about Draco.”
He twists to see Umbridge in the doorway and scowls. “Dolores,” McGonagall says, outwardly calm but the skin around her eyes has tightened. “I’m in the middle of a career advisory meeting.”
The visit to Hagrid’s is largely unhelpful, because he spends most of it getting sidetracked by talking about Madame Maxine. Harry does manage to secure a promise that Hagrid will try to find a place for them to play quidditch.
Can he trick their bodies? Maybe?
(she's added more since the last chapter!)
his father to be one of those men, but what he wants has no bearing on reality, unfortunately.
“Good morning,” Draco says agreeably, “Now fuck off.”
“No!” Harry cries, appalled. “Why would we do that? What’s the point of calling you here if we’re the ones that did it?”
There’s a moment of silence. They step into Dumbledore’s office and Fawkes gives a single trilling hello.
There are several hundred wands on fire, some of them burning several different colors. Maybe this didn’t start as a magical fire, and only became one because of its location? No, it can’t be. Ollivander makes all his wands heat resistant, otherwise they’d burst into flame the first time someone used them for a powerful spell. It had to have been on purpose.
Draco hastily scratches out the last bit of the treatment he’d given, then sends the scroll sailing into the filing cabinet with a flick of his wand. “Yes, show me. We should set up some sort of schedule to meet up at Hogwarts, or Hogsmeade, or something. I’ll introduce you to Hermione, she’s helping me work out some of the containment runes, you’ll love her.”
When the meeting’s over, he goes back to the dungeon first. It’s sparkling clean, and the scar softening salve has been finished and put into an airtight jar. Winky is sitting on the table with one of his old curtains in her lap, a needle in her hand and moving almost too fast for him to follow. Whenever he sees her like this, she reminds him of Pansy. There are sewing spells, of course, and Pansy knows them, but insists that if she can’t do it by hand, it won’t turn out as well when she tries to do it by magic. “Winky, what are you still doing here?”
“I’m not brooding!” he says, offended, and huffs when Draco raises an eyebrow. “I’m not, take that look off your face, if I wanted that I’d just wake up your mother.”
Ginny sighs, “He really should work on his saving people thing. It’s going to get him in trouble one day.”
Harry stares at him. Sirius shrugs, unrepentant. “I didn’t set his office on fire, so I really don’t think he has anything to complain about. Anyway, he wants to use the house for meetings, which means there will be people coming in and out fairly often. I told him I’d think about it.”
? I should have gone to the Prophet and gotten you sacked!”
“When done correctly, a ghost is solid – or at least semi-solid – for the first couple seconds after a summoning. If I can isolate that reaction, I might be able to replicate it.”
“Anyway,” he says, “Final exams start in two weeks, then we have the third task a week after that. Should we set up a study schedule or something?”
Hagrid stays perfectly still, only twitching when Draco reaches out to pet her scales. “This is Hagrid. He’s our friend.”
Umbridge screams as the blue goop come crashing down on her. Based on the gurgling sound that soon follows, he can only assume she swallowed some of it. That’s going to give her a stomach ache.
“You didn’t tell Elda that did you?” Bill asks anxiously. “I don’t want there to be another goblin war. For many reasons, but also a war is one of the things that dissolves my employment.”
Uhg, fine.
did several cute sketches from the last chapter that you can view
“Everything’s going to be fine,” he repeats. “I have you, and you have me, and we have all our friends. The war is coming, and I don’t think we can stop it. But it’s not coming just for you or me. It’s coming for all of us. So we’ll face it together.”
“Hey!” Ron says, pushing Harry aside and pulling Gabrielle closer by her wrists to steady her. “Calm down. You’re okay.” He’s speaking in a low, soothing tone, but he doesn’t let go of her, keeping her steady so she can’t pull away and drown.

“It’s comfortable,” he says, surprised. Now that he’s had it on a for a minute, it feels less constricting. “I like the color.”
Given Arthur’s brush with death, and the very real possibility that Voldemort might try and enact revenge, the adults decide it’s for the best for the Weasleys to stay at Grimmauld Place for the holiday break. Harry’s
“So, necromancers?” Draco repeats. “The sooner you answer me, the sooner I leave.”
. He’s trying to think of something he can tell her, because a curious Hermione with no resolution is even scarier that an employed one, but before he can think of anything, someone runs bodily into his side. “Draco!”
“Did you really fight Voldemort?” Andrew asks.
“We’ll get to that,” Hermione says. “What went on down there? The prince nodded to you!”
“Well, it’s a good idea, isn’t it?” Harry says. “Isn’t the whole reason we’re staying here and not at Remus’s cottage because it’s supposedly impenetrable? So if there are secret meetings to fight back against Voldemort going on, then here seems like a good place to have them.” He swallows, “Will I have to stay in my room while they’re happening?” It reminds him of the Dursley’s dinner parties, where he’d have to hide upstairs until everyone was gone. It makes him feel a little sick that he feels that way, because he knows it’s not the same, that Remus and Sirius are nothing like the Dursleys. But he can’t help it.
“Exactly,” she says, “and of course we’ll call everyone who says we were inner circle a vicious liar, but if there were less of them saying it, then that can only help.”
“Are you okay?” Ron asks. “What did you do?”
He should take the gift she’s offering. He shouldn’t press his luck. Hagrid is already murmuring his thanks, but Draco’s not exactly great at leaving well enough alone. All they’ve done so far is make a shitty situation worse. He doesn’t want to do that, and it doesn’t matter that she hasn’t exactly help, because that’s her
“Who?” Draco is fiddling with his tie, trying to get it sit just right even though they’re the only ones there.
“There is no second Hogwarts champion!” he steps forward, placing a hand on Fleur’s shoulder to let her know she can let go of Skeeter’s wrist. She does, and Skeeter pulls it back to chest, rubbing at it more than can possibly be necessary.
“Wait until you get a couple languages under your belt,” Blaise had said dryly. “It gets easier. And harder. I tend to speak in a mix of Italian and English if I’m not paying attention.”
“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.”
It’s the night before the first task, and Draco and Harry are under the invisibility cloak, sneaking out to the forbidden forest in the middle of the night, because they’re idiots. He should have put his foot down, should have refused to help with this completely ridiculous endeavor. But if he had, Harry would have just attempted to summon it on his own, and his all power, no control spellcasting combined with trying to summon a large, dangerous magical creature could only end in disaster.
He doesn’t have to push his way through, because they part for him. Sneers are on their lips, but when he steps forward they get out of his way. “Mr. Malfoy,” Crouch says, blustering, “this doesn’t concern you–”
Zaira, who’d been pulled from the same party as Amelia, is in a silk burnt orange dress that has a slit that goes nearly to her hip. She’s sitting with one leg over the other on Amelia’s desk so her very long legs are on display. She has on the type of very tall and very thin heels that even Pansy would struggle to walk in without wobbling and light catches on the gold straps as she kicks her foot in a nervous gesture that Draco really hopes is calculated, because he’s never seen Zaira off balance enough to so much as twitch.
The thing wails at that, prostrating herself. Draco assumes he doesn’t kick her only because they have an audience.
Millie, Neville, and Blaise look similarly disgruntled when they glance up. Pansy is mouthing the equations while she reads them, which probably shouldn’t surprise Harry as much as it does. It’s not like she’d be able to design wards as well as she can if she didn’t have a decent grasp on arithmancy. Ginny just shakes her head before pushing the paper away. Luna is frowning while she reads, but he’s pretty sure she’s actually reading through them.
Harry shrugs, “It’s not like she can make it any worse, right? Might as well let her do what she wants. How was the full moon? Is Remus okay?” They’re eating breakfast, so they should be speaking in Tamil, but he wants to find out everything he’s missed first.
“Don’t try and give me any romantic bullshit,” Lavender says sternly. “I know you’re just taking him out because you want to show him off to everyone. You don’t need privacy for that.”
The merman’s eyes crinkle at the corners. “Inform him it was not planned. Come, you must return to land.”
He flicks one of his peas at her. “
Harry blinks from the burst of bright blue light. What could he be casting that on -
That was an incredibly embarrassing speech, and maybe he should just stop swimming and let the lake take him and put him out of his misery. Ron grins from ear to ear, and hugs him right then, the both of them freezing and soaked and with Ron carrying Gabrielle on his back. “Okay,” he says, pulling back and urging them both forward again. “I – okay.”
He picks her up under the armpits and plops her on top of it, forcing the ladle into her hand. She’s scowling something awful at him, and he’d be impressed if he wasn’t so worried about whatever is going on upstairs. “I’m not, Abigail is coming with me. Keep stirring this, then add the eucalyptus once you bring it to a boil, but not for more than four minutes.”
“They’re all here, somewhere, I saw Remus and Sirius earlier. Does Sirius remember that he’s a wanted criminal?” Millie asks.
She’s his age, a teenager still, and she’s holding the book in front of her.
Snape isn’t keeping a close eye on any of them, is trusting their self preservation instincts will keep them safely in the common room. But he can’t send something this important in a letter, and Harry needs to know.
He drops the book into his hands, just like he had with Luna. Just like Luna, he’s completely fine. “It looks Greek to me,” Fred says, “like, real actual Greek.”
His mother sniffs and takes out her wand, “You’re positively filthy, darling. Did you forget how to cast a scourgify charm?”
It’s not fast enough to cover the light, girlish sound of McGonagall’s full belly laughter.
. Sometimes that means being a rich aristocratic pureblood with snobbishly good manners, and sometimes that means wearing jeans so tight he can’t breathe in them, but he’s flexible that way.
, okay. Then
Now he’s wandering around the muggle platforms. He could find somewhere out of the public eye and summon Winky, but there’s something very little kid like about needing his house elf to take him home, and if his parents are just going to straight up not bother to pick him up from the Hogwarts Express without so much as a heads up, then he’s not going to hitch a ride home with his house elf.
Zaira and Kingsley are laughing again and Amelia just gives them a blank look before her face contorts in disgust. “That is
He waits for them to nod in return before sweeping out of there without a backwards glance to any of them.
“Malfoy has to let us go,” Fred answers.
until he’s released, and then corner him away from prying eyes.
There’s a locking spell, but since Sprout encourages her students to steal from her, it’s easy to undo. He slips inside, creeping along the edges of the wall to keep from drawing attention to himself.
McGonagall glares, even as there are general murmurings of agreement from the rest of the house.
As soon as she’s gone, Cedric drops his head onto the table and groans. “I haven’t slept in days, I have no idea what I’m doing, and she’s going to dump me for someone who’s less of a disaster.”
Blaise wolf whistles. Millie flushes and glares at him. “Don’t make fun of me.”
Sirius goes with him through the floo to the Leaky Cauldron, just in case. But the Weasleys are waiting right outside the fireplace for him, and it’s not just them.
“Rome Severan House,” Ginny answers, and the flames shift to green. There’s a long moment, and then a man Harry doesn’t know sticks his head through the fireplace and says something in Italian.
He raises a bushy eyebrow. “And how long will that be?”
Good advice. He’s definitely not going to take it.
Lavender blinks a couple times before grinning, the dimple on her left cheek coming out like it does when she forgets to keep her smile a certain size. “Don’t worry Ronniekins. Your whole big strong nice boy thing is pretty hot too.”
“Well, what am I supposed to do?” He’s definitely shouting now. “Just sit here and hope you don’t die? Wonder everyday if I’m ever going to see you again?”
He shakes his head, “No, I mean, yes, he did, but it wasn’t
Sirius turns to him, glaring. “Like you have room to talk. You’ve done so much shit, you’re lucky your kid and mine are together, otherwise I’d turn you inside out.”
Harry is the best at Tamil out of his friends, but that’s because he spent the whole summer getting daily lessons. Now that he’s back at school, his skills have started to lag, and if he keeps this up, Pansy will outpace him. He refuses to let that happen. Which is why he’s awake an hour before breakfast with a book in his lap, taking notes on pronunciation. Neville will sometimes get up and study with him, but the closest Ron will get is stumbling out his bed and into Harry’s, curling under his covers and mumbling out a conversation in Tamil. Dean and Seamus have started using some words in Tamil that they’ve picked up from them, but they have no great love of languages. Seamus speaks two different dialects of Gaelic, while Dean just sticks to Latin, and only that because his mother makes him.
(See the end of the chapter for
,” he says, with more force than he intended. Ron’s eyes widen. “He – he’s what he is,” he says, “but you’re my best friend and my first friend, and I wouldn’t have anyone or anything if I didn’t have you. I don’t remember my parents, so you, and your family, are – you were the first – I felt so
They walk to the prefect bathrooms in silence, and Harry smirks when Draco says, “Apple cider,” and the door opens for them.
He has to press the split open skin together for this to work, and he wishes he had tape or something to keep everything in place. As is, he has to hold the wounds shut with one hand and hold his wand with the other.
Harry turns to glare at him, and Draco admits, “My first year levitation weight was five hundred pounds. I could have done it. Well, my illusions were crap back then, so not that bit, but the deadly rain of rocks part is easy enough.”
Millie raises her hands, “All right everyone, calm down. George and Fred didn’t let anyone do anything. Blaise bought Ollivander’s land off him. It’s either going to a joke shop or a hat shop, so.”
All their heads turn to see Katie floating ten feet above the ground, convulsing and screaming, while Leanne ineffectually jumps up, trying to grab onto her.
Cormac crosses his arms. “Oh, shut up Malfoy. Just take him and go.”
When he looks up, both Remus and Sirius are staring at him, and neither of them look happy. “Okay,” Sirius says, “now we are prying. What was that about? Why would Draco send you a letter when he can just use the mirror?”
The skeleton tilts her head to the side, almost like she’s confused, and it’s enough for him to see a hole in the back of her skull. He thinks it’s a bullet hole, and it can’t be from after death, because if it had been the necromancy magic would fixed it so it was barely cracked.
Draco can tell that something’s bothering his boyfriend, but Harry just dismisses it when he asks, so he decides not to push. Harry’s usually pretty good about telling them things, but sometimes he just has to stew in it for a while. If he doesn’t come clean on his own within the week, they’ll just send Ginny in, who if nothing else can be infuriating enough to trick him into yelling about what he’s upset about.
“You could get hurt,” Dumbledore says, looking even older than he usually does, looking tired.
Moving through the water is easy, and he’s
“And flooing would kill you, I suppose?” he asks, but it’s more offhand than anything else, because Sirius knows the game even if he’s not interested in playing it. “Alright then, Harry’s around here somewhere, I swear I turn around for a moment in the number of redheads multiplies.”
a normal summer.
Snape doesn’t have his wand out, but Draco does. He aims it right at Snape’s face. “Get out of my way.”
Good point. “Find Firenze,” Draco tells her. “If not him, at least someone who won’t skewer us on sight.”
Mip shakes his head, and takes a seat across from them. “So young, and so impulsive. They exhaust me.”
Sirius bows to Hermione, taking the back of her hand to kiss it. “Why, Miss Granger! When I saw you last you were a little girl! Now you’re young woman.”
“Harry!” Percy begins, furious, then he gets a closer look at him and his eyebrows dip together in concern. “Are you okay?”
“Who cares about an attorney? I want her to stand there and make the Wizengamot feel like a bunch of idiots who are in danger of losing their seats in the next election,” he says.
The attic contains so much alcohol that they couldn’t possibly have gotten all of it from Rosmerta. Not that she wouldn’t sell a couple teenagers that amount, it’s just that Harry doesn’t think she has that much on hand.
“So whoever did this specifically didn’t want us to know who they were and knows that you’re a necromancer, if not a Mother,” Draco says. “Or we’re overreacting and the head and bone marrow being gone are just a strange coincidence and have nothing to do with Harry or necromancers at all.”
Harry answers, “
His mother and boyfriend are there, as expected, but so is his father, which is unexpected.
“You don’t need to be experienced to lead a study group,” he argues.
It can be altered, too. He can tell it to show him the night sky anywhere in the world, in Hong Kong or New York or Sydney. He has it set to Tamil Nadu, India, though. It’s where his father’s family is from.
“Queen Persenet,” Dumbledore greets.
“What on
Harry’s pretty sure this means he has a boyfriend now.
She taps the map, “You’re good, he’s in his office.”
Fred says, “Mate. That was
Draco runs the palm of his hand over Nagini’s head, then steps over her. He clambers onto Theophania’s back without hesitation, then looks down and holds out his hand to the person closest to him, who happens to be Colin Creevey. “Come on,” he says.
He’s compromised about his hair, no wanting it to fall around his face, so it’s half down and half up in a bun on top of his head. He has on a white silk button up shirt with pearl buttons and black satin shorts. The best part, of course, is that the shorts have a mesh stripe along the sides.
Which is how he ends up straddling his soulmate, pointing a wand at his face. “I - Harry?”
It had been a resounding success. Hogwarts had actually felt united for the first time, all three schools had actually felt united. It has been
“If by accepted, you mean his ears are still ringing from when you ripped him a new one after threatening to set his office on fire with him still inside it and stomping out, then yes, that’s how I’d describe it,” Remus says mildly.
Of course, a moment so nice can’t last.
That’s true, actually. Draco remembers the huge fight about it that happened about a year before he started Hogwarts. A portion of the Board of Governors had decided that the professors needed to increase the required combination of continuing education hours and professional accolades that a professor needed in order to keep their position at Hogwarts, but they hadn’t wanted to increase the professors’ personal research and continuing education budget, which obviously hadn’t pleased any of the professors. That had then sparked a whole debate on whether Hogwarts was an institution of learning or prestige, and the answer had ended up being both, pay the professors more if they need to do more, damnit.
has done several gorgeous pieces for siat that you can view
and Moody was there, and, and I,” her voice cracks and she continues on in Korean, something Harry can’t follow at all, but Cedric is nodding along and answering her in kind, rubbing a soothing hand up and down her back.
“Not pleased?” Draco guesses, because he doesn’t know Parseltongue, but he does know Abigail.
There are lots of words that can be used to describe his mother, but he doesn’t think delicate is among them.
Harry slips from McGonagall’s desk and slumps into the chair opposite her. He likes pissing Umbridge off and giving McGonagall a hard time, but the last thing he wants is to get his head of house in trouble.
. Who knows their customs and wears their colors and would punch anyone who tried to say she was anything less.
Harry enters the great hall with Ron and Hermione and sees that Quinn and Cho have moved over to the Hufflepuff table today instead of dragging Cedric to theirs. Cedric has an arm around his fiancé’s waist as he flips through a charms book, scowling. It’s too bad the whole Draco being decent thing is a secret, otherwise Harry would volunteer him to help Cedric study for his newts.
He looks at his shoulder, considering. Can he do a blood replenishing spell right now? He can’t see very well, black spots dancing across his vision. But his shoulder is right there, it’s not like he can miss.
The woman in pink looks like she’s sucking on a lemon, and Fudge keeps patting his face, eyes so wide that they look a little crazed.
Draco is leaving arithmancy when someone hooks their arm in his and yanks him down the hall in the opposite direction of where he’d been planning to go. The opposite direction of the great hall, which contains dinner. He’s hungry!
Snape bites back a scream as Hermione’s spell straightens all his limbs and he goes floating into the air. Harry knows he’s probably pissed right now, but it’s better if Snape can’t move for what comes next. Ron reaches into his pocket, flicks something out from his hand and shouts, “Butterbeer!”
By the time he looks to Draco, he’s almost entirely himself, pants several inches too short and Colin’s shirt straining against his shoulders, his long platinum blonde hair hanging down his back. “Your face!” he hisses, pawing at his pocket for the vile of polyjuice potion. He glances at Millie, and sure enough, she’s back to looking like herself, and looking very uncomfortable in Lavender’s clothes, which are a couple sizes too small for her.
Fleur, Viktor, and Cedric are the ones to come up with a solution. They play rock paper scissors for the trophy, and agree to split the winnings. All the judges but Dumbledore are horrified, who seems delighted by their solution. “It’s more fair than anything else in this tournament has been,” Viktor reasons.
fly in there without worrying about some random plant trying to kill him, he’s reluctant to do anything but basic moves, because if he messes up and crashes into something delicate, Neville will murder him. Even Sirius isn’t under any illusion that he gets a say what goes on in his greenhouse and has been staying away from it. Harry’s excited to see his godfather’s face when it’s finished.
Cedric hesitates again, and Harry’s about to just push him at the stupid trophy when he grins and ruffles Harry’s hair. “Okay, okay, I’m going.”
Harry has already said his last goodbyes to his great great grandmother and the other residents of the tomb, sealing them up with a few spells that will hopefully be a little harder for someone else to break later down the line, and now it’s his last shift at the ice cream parlor, and for some reason it seems twice as busy as usual. He feels like he’s just gotten there, and then the next moment he’s lifting the chairs on top of the tables so he can mop up, and Florean is covering the tubs of ice scream, being careful not to jostle them too much in case they start yelling. He almost doesn’t say anything, but this is his last chance to ask. Well, his last chance to ask until next year, and it’ll probably be even more awkward then than it feels now. “Florean, can I ask you something? You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to.”
“It would, actually, since you’re up against people who are older and know way more magic than you,” Pansy says dryly.
He’s already told Blaise to find somewhere else to sleep tonight. Usually he’s not so inconsiderate as to kick him out for the whole night, but the bedrooms in the shrieking shack have just been renovated, and worst case scenario he can spend the night there. Draco wants his soulmate, his bed, a silencing charm, and to not to have to worry about keeping track of the time.
the heir?” Harry asks, mind whirling.
“What?” he asks.
Cho gently lays Cedric on a bed opposite to them. “Is he going to be okay?”
It’s sounds kind of silly and childish, but he can’t wait until he can just date Draco like a normal teenager. Draco grins and kisses him on the nose, “Yeah, okay. I was personally planning to hex anyone who hit on you or stared at you too long, but I suppose your idea is a little more subtle.”
Seamus blinks. “Why would Malfoy help?”
“She can’t take you off the team!” Harry shouts, and Ron winces, probably because that was a little bit right in his ear. Everyone in the common room is staring at them, which he feels mildly guilty about until he realizes they’ve been staring ever since Fred entered the common room, sans George. He assumes he’s with Cassius.
“I’ll bring you your uniform for this afternoon!” Sirius calls out, because, right, Harry’s an idiot who scheduled the last shift for both his jobs to be on the same day. He has to be at Florean’s at two, which is barely going to give him enough time to get there and get changed.
“No,” he says. “He cut his head off. I guess he could have used this spell on himself after, but if he was already dead and could perform magic and casting an astral projection retrieval spell does make someone become a ghost, then he would have just used that instead of whatever this is. Besides, being a ghost makes someone easier to summon, not harder. If Slughorn were out there haunting someone or something, he’d be easy to find. Even a normal necromancer could do it, never mind Mothers that have worked with him for decades.”
,” Theophania says.
“Missing?” Draco echoes. “What do you mean missing?”
Harry, in full view of dozens of people, summoned an unrestrained patronus and killed hundreds of dementors. No one is going to cause trouble or say he isn’t qualified. And if there are some people who are thinking it, well. The Gryffindors won’t look divided in front of the Slytherins, the Hufflepuffs follow Cedric and Susan, the Ravenclaws follow Quinn, and the Slytherins –
Harry almost walks past Luna, because she looks so different than normal. “You look really nice,” he says earnestly. The Patil twins had done a good job matching them – even though their clothes look so different, they’re sporting the exact same shades of blue and green.
“You could have worked anywhere,” he says. “Every shop in Diagon Alley and most of them in the other alleys would have hired you on the spot. Why did you choose mine?”
He sighs but retrieves the book, carefully handing it over, but thankfully she takes it easily with no curses or burning flesh.
“That’s my cue,” he says, hopping off his bed. “Have fun.”
She hadn’t said anything useful when he’d questioned her about Snape’s career trajectory per Draco’s request, but he thinks this might have a better success rate. Actually, maybe he should come at this sideways. “Wait, I have some other questions first. Can you perform the unforgivable curses wandlessly?”
Luna hesitates, then steps forward, taking Zaira’s hand. The woman twirls her around and says, “Wonderful, you’re such a pretty girl.”
He takes a deep breath, flings out his wand, and shouts, “FLIPENDO!”
The door slams open. “Sorry!” Harry says, breathless. “I was meeting with the other champions. I was just telling them that I wasn’t going to try for the cup, and that they can ask me for help if they need it,” Merlin above, it’s not like Draco expected anything else, but that is exactly the type of crap Ginny was talking about, “and we ended up talking for longer than I thought we would. Sorry.”
They’re confused until Draco vanishes McGonagall’s robes, leaving her in just her underwear. “Ah,” Katie says.
The truth of it is, he’s faced Voldemort before, and survived every time. But he was never alone. He always had friends to help him, which he doesn’t have now.
“The goblet is a protected artifact, isn’t it?” Ron asks, resigned. “Dad hates those, they’re not allowed to destroy them or even tamper with them to make them less dangerous, and they always somehow manage to fall into muggle hands.”
“It’s delicious, don’t worry,” she says, giving him a warm smile. “I wouldn’t feed you something awful, and if you hate it, we’ll order something else.”
Harry snorts, and Draco shoots him a glare because, as usual, its Harry getting them in the middle of things rather than the other way around. “Do you know how to contact the centaur herd in the forest? We need to speak to them.”
“If you did, we’re going to call Headmaster Dumbledore and formally issue a duel to the death, as is our right under our treaty signed by both Headmaster Dippet and the Minister of Magic,” Firenze corrects, as if that’s better.
“Are you mad?” Ron hisses, “Mum’s going to kill you!” He looks toward the door, clearly waiting for their mother to come running up. Nothing happens.
“See?” Pansy says. “Who cares if your mum had a soulmate who wasn’t your dad? Bit unfortunate for all involved that it’s Snape, but at the end of the day, that’s not what’s important. You know that.”
Draco turns and sees Umbridge pushing her way through the stands out of the corner of his eyes.
Hermione’s eyes narrow, but before she can say anything a hush falls over the table, and Harry realizes everyone is staring at the space just behind them. They turn around.
Why are they asking him? Why would he know? He does, of course, but that’s hardly the point. “Yes.”
“Tell me what it is first, and then I’ll tell you if I can help,” he says. “You’re being vague and it’s rather worrying.”
Two months, Harry reminds himself as they walk towards the exit where the Dursleys are waiting for him, just two months.
“Of course I can. The question is, why should I? This is ridiculous.”
He can’t help but be cheered at that. Remus and Sirius are still against him helping clean the house, but every once in a while, they’ll find something fun and interesting enough that they’ll let him join in.
“We’ve missed you too,” Hermione says, looking vaguely guilty.
Wait.
“Draco had quidditch practice, he should be here soon,” Blaise says.
Harry is almost relived to head over to the Durmstrang ship, if only because it means he’ll be able to take a break from answering questions about the second task. He feels like he’s told the story a dozen times already to the Gryffindors alone.
“Am I really grounded?” he asks, “Which, you know, my best friends are here, so that’s fine, but then I have to tell my boyfriend. What is being grounded, exactly? I’m just going to go ahead and assume you’re not going to lock me in the cupboard.” Honestly, as long as they locked him in the one on the third floor corridor, he wouldn’t mind at all. That one has a whole tea room hidden in the back.
Asim’s eyes are wide as he gently caresses the sphere, which would be a little weird if Draco didn’t know how dedicated he was to improving the lives of all his patients, and what this could mean for all of them.
He fusses with the taps, making it this side of too hot, which is how Draco likes it. Well, it’s possibly slightly cooler than Draco would like it, but Harry’s not looking to get his skin scalded off. When he looks up, Draco’s already undressed and is undoing his hair. It’s down to past his shoulder blades and such a pale blonde that it almost looks white in the right light, against his miles of pale skin and his light blue eyes. He looks like all the color’s been leached out of him, but not in bad way, like he’s one of those Greek statues people put in museums.
“You could be killed,” he continues.
He does, he looks more like a proper pureblood than a living skeleton, trimmed hair and his eyes no longer sunken deep into his face. That’s probably due to the man who’s head that appears next to him – that of Remus Lupin.  “Harry,” their former professor says warmly, then he looks over and up. “Draco, fancy seeing you here. How unexpected and shocking.”
Draco’s eyes narrow. “Mum, I’m really sorry about this.” He jerks his wand, using his magic to pushe her back into the study so he can run inside.
Filius nods. “I did expect them to be here by now,” he admits.
Draco looks Cassius over. He’s furious, and – and he looks
“We’re not done talking about this!” Quinn yells after him.
There’s something wrong with everyone at this school, but it’s probably the same thing that’s wrong with him if it took him five years to notice. “Do you think she knows?” he whispers to Ron, who’s facilitating between fury and despair. The new educational degree has been pasted outside their common room, although he’s certain there’s another in the hallway outside of the great hall.
“Yes, Master Draco,” she answers.
“Anything for our star quidditch player,” she says, still leaning and resting her chin in her hands.
Harry scowls. “Stop arguing and come
He forces himself to listen to her, forces himself to relax. He has a lazy smile on his face when he turns his head to press a brief kiss to Pansy’s cheek, “Thanks.”
“Most of the time,” Hermione says. Ron glares at her. “What? Sometimes a little murder can be helpful.”
“We figured out a way to get past her sensing charm,” George says, “It’s a potion, we’ll brew it for you when we get back to school. But be smart about it! If she catches you casting, she’ll know we messed with it and set up a whole new one.”
“Now, Cornelius, perhaps now is not the time to act recklessly–”
Confused, Draco opens it.
Harry’s not the only one with a soulmark in their year. Dean and Seamus are even soulmates. They’d found out before they were even sorted, and once they’d touched the black rings on the back of their calves had transformed into an oak and maple tree respectively. Lavender Brown had a soul mark, a black ring just below her wrist. He’d seen others, people flaunting them in the hopes that someone with a mark in the same place would see.
she mutters, tilting her head to give Draco easier access.
Ron lets her go, and Cedric and Cho do the same to Gabrielle. She bolts, running towards her elder sister, arms outstretched. “
“Better hobbies?” Blaise offers.
Mr. Parkinson raises an eyebrow, some of his panic fading under amusement. “Is that so?”
Luna is really, really good at dancing, and Harry’s never felt so grateful. With Luna leading him, he manages to make it through the dance without looking like an idiot, and once they’re dancing in the crowd and not the center of attention, he even has fun.
She looks to actually be considering it for a moment, but just shakes her head. “I’ll keep watch. Have fun down there. I hope you die.”
, damnit. He doesn’t get a chance to say any of it, because Harry walks out of the bathroom and leaves him there alone.
“Which calming potion?” she asks. “The Calming Draught will be making the mind slow.”
Harry’s pretty sure that Minerva has never been nervous a day in her life, but he says, “It’s nothing bad. It’s something I asked Snape but he didn’t really answer me.”
Harry feels a kind of kinship with Percy just then. He’s too young to be getting almost killed by Voldemort all the time, and Percy’s too young to have to manage a whole corrupt government.
“They don’t want you to lead a study group,” Ron says, and when Harry turns to him his eyes are narrowed and he’s glaring at the rest of them, Hermione included. “Do you?”
“My grandmother and your great aunt were good friends,” she says, and Harry doesn’t even know who his great aunt was, never mind who her friends might have been. “She adored James, and would have loved you too, I’m sure.” This whole conversation kind of makes him feel like he’s about to break out in hives and it’s only been thirty seconds. But she still has her hand on his back, and she’s being nice, so he intends to say thank you, but she steamrolls over him, continuing to speak before he gets the chance. “I heard you talking about languages, your father so loved his languages. How many do you speak?”
Harry is disappointed, because he’d wanted Draco to be there. But he can’t say that, because it makes him sound like a kid. It’s not important, not really, but Draco won’t be able sneak away during Hogsmeade, and it’s just – he wants his godfather to get along with his soulmate. Remus already knows Draco, and likes him, kinda. But Sirius doesn’t, and it’s not like there’s a lot of opportunities for them to meet.
“What?” Harry says, wide eyed. First Lupin knowing his parents, and now Draco’s mum. “Sirius Black was in the same year as my dad? Do you think they knew each other?”
Even Harry sits up straight, the whole class leaning forward eagerly. That’s something that gets touched on briefly at the end of sixth year and nothing much tends to come of it.
It bubbles and boils over, turning a thick, angry red that makes it look like the whole thing is spilling blood. The air grows thick and tense with magic, then there’s a bright flash of light that Harry squeezes his eyes against. When he opens them again, a tall, pale man with a flat nose and red eyes is standing in the cauldron.
The grim look on Draco’s face confirms that he does, in fact, know.
“If she’s so great, why did Crouch get rid of her?” Harry asks. He goes to grab a gingersnap for himself, but a second plate appears, containing treacle tarts. Draco supposes those must be his favorite, by the dumbfounded look on his face.
He blinks, and looks around. George is gesturing at him from behind a tapestry, everything but his head and one arm obscured. “What in merlin’s name are you doing?”
“There’s no point,” Ginny agrees. “We could tell the Order where everyone is, but it wouldn’t change anything. That place is so well warded that anyone who tries to force their way in will probably just end up dead. Or worse.”
The relief nearly leaves him giddy. He grabs a pillow off his bed, and hits Blaise over the head with it. “You absolute git. Are you going to help me or not?”
“We’re not old enough to-” A tray with a strawberry daiquiri, the exact same shade as her bikini, floats over to her, being carried by four similarly colored pixies.
They both look to Bill, who is pale and wide eyed. He obligingly turns and lifts up his hair. In the same spot on the back of his neck is a falcon. He doesn’t know Bill well enough to know how much of him is like a bluejay, but a soulmark portraying Fleur as a bird of prey makes sense to him.
He pats Colin on the back. “Great! I need your brother’s too. And for you two to hide in the chamber of secrets, for, oh, probably the rest of the night to be safe.”
Harry wouldn’t have noticed if he wasn’t looking right at him, but there’s a minute movement on Dumbledore’s face that Harry would describe as a flinch if it were anyone else.
That’s a joke, because if he did have any questions, he’d ask Draco and Hermione. It’s probably a net positive that the two of them bully the rest of them into doing their homework and doing it well, but sometimes it’s really annoying.
Draco blinks, wrinkling his nose. He hasn’t caused any other house meetings. Has he?
(she's added more since the last chapter!)
“Talking about me?” a voice asks, sounding far away. Draco rolls his eyes and then must tip the mirror up because then Harry’s watching Narcissa walk into the room, which judging by the quick glance he got is the kitchen.  She’s wearing a long, voluminous mint green skirt and a tight off shoulder white top that goes down to her elbows with her hair swept up in a ponytail. She’s wearing a silver dragon pendant that rests between her clavicles and diamond teardrop earrings that he assumes cost more than most people make in a month.
“How do you know that?” Harry demands. He’s long past the point of feeling embarrassed about missing these things, but this one hardly seems obvious.
“That’s acceptable, Mr. Malfoy. I truly am sorry about this,” Dumbledore says. He doesn’t sound sorry.
“Sod off,” a girl’s voice snaps, and Harry turns to see a young woman with fiery red hair and glaring green eyes. His eyes. “I saw what you did to Sev yesterday. Really? You haven’t outgrown this yet?”
too stiff. It’s nearly sunset, and none of them are eager to be in the forbidden forest after dark. Harry knows from personal experience that it just ends in things trying to eat them.
Oh boy. Draco can’t handle crying. “I’m sure the bathing suit Millie brought is fine-”
Cedric tils his head enough to look at him, “I’m mostly the only one who calls her Eun-hae, she prefers going by Cho. So I’d call her Cho. I mean,
Draco rolls his eyes, even though Blaise and Pansy look like they’re considering in it. “That’s a lot of trouble to go to just so I can get some extra practice in. Pansy and Blaise can go without me, that will be fine. It’ll give me some time to catch up on homework.”
Harry raises his wand, circles the pile of bones twice, then jabs his wand into the center. “Ola zontana!”
Blaise walks in just as Draco is zipping up his jeans. There’s no reason to wear his uniform on the weekend. “I’m going to go visit Hagrid with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Want to come?”
“Well, he was trying to kill my friends,” Fleur says slowly, as if Fudge were a child.
“Do I want to know how that works?” Ron asks.
Draco nods, “Sometimes I almost resist my dad, but my mum? Forget about it. I’ve never even hesitated.”
“Don’t raise your voice at me!” he snaps. “You don’t know what you’re talking about. I heard what you did in that field with that blasted house elf. Surely you don’t think that thing picked up Potter’s wand on accident–”
half of them, just guessed and hoped for the best. “For extra credit?” he asks, even though he doesn’t need it, because he’ll do it, he’s going to make Hermione write out his equations for him, but he will do it.
“Mr. Riddle?” Harry asks. “Can you tell how the spells are layered?”
has done fantastic portraits of
Dumbledore pauses, taking his eyes off Voldemort to look at Flitwick. “Filius, is that you wearing young Mr. Creevey’s face?”
“WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA!” he shouts, hoping everyone is too busy screaming to notice, and the spell barely catches Harry, only manages to slow his decent for a moment before it slides off him. He casts it again, and the same thing happens, and it’s not enough, he can’t catch Harry this way and he’s going to die.
“It would, actually, but I don’t care about your father. I care about me. Regardless if my aunt gets the appointment or not, I plan on following her footsteps into government. I won’t be able to do that if people think I’m just another one of Dumbledore’s puppets. Will it help my aunt if her favored niece is known as a moderate? Yes. Am I doing this more for my future career than anything else? Also yes.”
Draco rolls his eyes. Blaise says, “We should bring in Millicent too.” They all look at him, and he shrugs. “We’re getting outnumbered. Spending so much time with this many Gryffindors is bad for the digestion. Besides, Millicent hangs out with us a lot, and she’s not stupid. I’m sure she’s noticed we go missing for several hours at a time multiple times a week.”
Or at least he thought it was.
“Here,” George says, and casts a summoning spell. In the next moment he’s holding something that looks like a thin red rope. “Fred and I came up with these before we knew that you would be attending the Order meetings. They’re called extendable ears, and with a few glamour charms they’ll at least be less likely to be noticed than Draco peeking through cracked doors, for merlin’s sake.”
Luna repeats her actions, as do the twins, until Harry’s left in Flitwick’s office with Draco, Pansy, Blaise and the professors. “I think that’s more than enough excitement for one night,” McGonagall says. “Shall I escort you back to your common rooms, or can you find your way there yourself?”
“Oh, Harry.” Quinn reaches out to squeeze his shoulder, warm and nonjudgmental enough that he feels slightly less mortified about his outburst. “He was never awful all the time.”
Everyone laughs, but Harry’s pretty sure he’s not joking.
There are two pops and Winky and Dobby are standing next to Harry. “You must be going!” Dobby says urgently. “Miss Umbridge knows where you are!”
“Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy,” she greets, turning from petting Fawkes’s to face them. She looks at their joined hands, blinks, and asks, “Who won the pool?”
No, he can’t make himself feel sorry for Marietta at all.
“Good idea,” Harry says, summoning Prongs and sending him off to get Tonks.
“Did you have a good time?” he asks, and it’s a serious question.
Harry was sure that he would never meet anyone as infuriating as Rita Skeeter. He was wrong.
A thirty foot python comes crackling to life, and it’s strong enough to knock the basilisk off course. It dances according to Harry’s shouted instructions, and is just big enough to be annoying but small enough to slither away.
Draco considers getting an early night’s sleep or doing some of the reading he still has for Poppy, but instead he heads to the Gryffindor tower. Harry’s around somewhere and Draco’s positive he can get him to abandon whatever he’s currently doing to tell him he’s pretty and badly braid his hair. It’s about the effort, really, even if Draco ends up having to redo it himself half the time whenever Harry tries to do anything more complicated than a simple three strand braid. Maybe Pansy could teach him.
Draco still doesn’t like it.
He’s just started to quiet when there’s a presence at his elbow, and he looks up to see Winky hovering next to his bed with a cup of hot cocoa and Abigail comically wrapped around her, and he has to smile at this sight of his big black mamba struggling to be held up by a tiny house elf. “Here you is going, Master Draco!” she carefully sets the cup of cocoa on his bedside table and heaves Abigail onto the bed. She hisses in displeasure, but is quick to curl on top his back. Winky wrings her hands. “I will draw Master Draco a bath now? That is what the other elves said you is liking when you are sad.”
“He’s not old enough!” she protests. “He doesn’t need to worry about this, he should focus on school, not fighting You-Know-Who.”
Fred grabs Hermione’s shot and takes it himself. Hermione can’t seem to decide if she’s offended or not. “When did you learn to drink alcohol, ickle Ronniekins?”
“What the bloody hell,” Bill says through clenched teeth, “is she doing here?”
But he missed Sirius’s trial and hadn’t even managed to swing by Grimmauld Place after to congratulate him, since he ended up bitching his way into Amelia Bones’s office to go check on his boyfriend. So when he receives a last minute invitation from Remus and Sirius to meet them at Madame Pudifoot’s, he accepts and resolves to be back in time for practice, or at least bring back Ron some cake if he can’t.
Ron turns out to be annoyingly resistant to it. “Five older brothers, two of which are Fred and George,” he reminds smugly, which leaves the rest of them with no choice but to spend the rest of the ride trying to tickle him at random moments to startle a laugh at him. Pansy ends up being the only successful one.
this. He’s just stuck with it.
The changes are the same, but he’s not sure where to go. The great lake is big – far, far bigger than it looks from the outside, and if he just starts swimming in a random direction he’ll never find her. Hermione mentioned a spell once – but it seemed to silly, like the spell the twins gave Ron to turn his rat yellow in first year.
Except after explaining the spell, it explains the wand movements. As far as Harry is aware, avada kedavra doesn’t have any particular wand movements associated with it, yet these instructions are precise, down to the exact angle his pinky should be held in. Then on the next page there’s a completely different set of instructions describing wand movements for the killing curse with no explanation on what the differences between them are supposed to mean. Under different circumstances he’d just test the difference himself, but, well, it’s the killing curse. If it wasn’t in a necromancy book, he’d see if maybe Draco’s mother could test it out for him, but he doesn’t want to risk her getting caught with any sort of rebound. He’s a Mother, which means he doesn’t have to worry about that too much, but Narcissa doesn’t have that protection.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Hermione says, and she seems to have shaken off whatever surprise she was obviously feeling. “You just never mentioned it.”
Narcissa’s lips quirk up at the corner, and because they’re alone she doesn’t bother to smooth out her expression. He knows she’s not quite as free with her expressions around him as she is around Draco, but the difference between now and her tightly controlled, emotionless face is startling. “Actual gardening, dear. I don’t have any murders scheduled for this morning.”
Draco doesn’t dignify that with a response. “Think about it,” he says, before opening the compartment door and stepping outside. He has to take several deep breathes before going to find his friends.
She’s not surprised in the slightest. He’s a little worried about what that means for their secret keeping abilities, but she just sighs and says, “Draco, I’ve been watching you come and go since second year. It’s obvious you were sneaking out to meet someone. I can’t say I’m surprised it’s Harry Potter.”
However, since it’s pretty much dark all around him, he notices the lights are on in the greenhouse, and not just in the part that houses the plants that need more sunlight than the sun can provide. He debates minding his own business, since trying new things is good for him, but heads toward the greenhouse anyway.
Harry raises an eyebrow and even Draco is impressed. He may not have been in the same house as Percy, but there’s no castle big enough to escape the rumors of him being a workaholic micromanager. From everything he’s heard since, not much has changed. He’s surprised Percy can even say the word vacation without breaking out in hives.
“You’re welcome,” he answers, pleased. “Thanks for talking to me. Can I talk to you again?”
He pouts. “But I haven’t even figured out how to add more than one location yet! It’s only half complete, I don’t think the Charms Review will be impressed with something that’s half done.”
“Oh Merlin above,” Remus says, “Minerva wasn’t lying? That really happened?”
Millie looks up from her muggle book, which is very clearly muggle and not disguised to be anything else. “I think maybe the time for secrets is coming to a close.”
“This is important gossip,” Wood says grimly. Harry squeezes in next to Katie, who gives him a friendly smile. “Boys?”
He’d used Draco’s present to set up a slice of the Indian sky in his bed last night. It’s cloudy and damp outside, but he’d woken up to a bright sun, so he’s in an excellent mood when he goes down to breakfast with Ron and Neville. They’re on their way to the Gryffindor table when he notices someone waving at him, and he ends up walking to the Ravenclaw table instead, Ron and Neville following him after realizing he wasn’t behind them anymore. Cedric had been the one waving him over, Cho sitting next to him one side, and Quinn on the other. Harry mostly only knows Quinn through reputation, thanks to Draco and Seamus. Draco because he’s gotten pulled into zir latest crazy idea, and Seamus because apparently he and Quinn blow things up together.
stamped across it. With the size, it can only be one thing, and he’s already grinning by the time he opens it and a competition grade golden snitch goes flying out. He catches it immediately, the wings beating wildly in an attempt to free itself, and he slides his finger over the middle groove to deactivate it. “Awesome!” he beams. “Thank you. It’s great.”
Ron scratches is nose. “The whole flying car thing made sense at the time, and no one died, so. Could have been worse.”
Sirius hesitates, which immediately grabs Harry’s interest. He tends to be very forthcoming with Harry. “We’ve been staying at Moony’s cottage. It’s remote, and well protected, what with the full moons and everything. But we’re looking into fixing up my ancestral home.”
!” Ron says. “I don’t know how he expects to maintain his grades with a house elf sucking him dry.”
Neville scowls.
and I would have loved to let you handle it, Father, I really would have. But you couldn’t do that because you weren’t there!”
“Shut up, you’re coming,” Ron insists. Draco shrugs and doesn’t argue any further.
Draco laughs and twirls them around. “This is so cool!”
Draco considers going on that spiel for a second because at least it’ll be distracting, but there’s the elephant in the room that they’re not discussing. Harry’s washed his hands of the whole thing because it was seriously stressing him out so he’s elected to instead actively ignore it instead, but Draco has a much better track record of meddling in other people’s love lives. Really, he’s more qualified to have this conversation than Harry is.
“My darling Sophia,” Voldemort hisses, red eyes flashing, “I suggest you become more forthcoming with the details before I do something to help jog your memory.”
(See the end of the chapter for
did a super cute pic of harry and ron that you can see
Sirius just stares. Arthur coughs, “Uh, Molly honey, I think, maybe, given past experiences, we should consider that that’s not exactly within Harry’s control.”
Harry tries to think of how to ask him what he does during the summer in Tamil, but all he can think of is
Uhg. This morning sucks.
He rolls his eyes and ignores him. “It’s not the time for that right now.”
“But you have so many friends,” Pansy complains, “It’s just so hard to keep track.”
He uses the water to gently deposit Harry onto the sand, and he stumbles but doesn’t fall. “Thanks for your help!” he says, waving. He clearly has no idea how important or powerful the merman is, even if he now knows that he’s a prince.
“It’s not that simple. And that doesn’t matter, I don’t need to be his friend to be intolerant of your bullying. I don’t condone it when he does it, so I don’t know why you think you’d get a free pass. I thought you’d grown up,” she says sharply, tossing her hair over her shoulder before walking away from them. His father scrambles to his feet and goes chasing after her.
Cormac is going red in the face. “Malfoy, get out! You’re a prefect, you’re setting a terrible example!”
The scene ripples, but it’s the same hallway, he hasn’t moved at all. He’s confused until he turns and sees Snape towering over his mother, furious. Lily glares right back, not giving an inch. They look the same age as him now, fourth or fifth year. “Potter? Really?”
“And now there’s not,” Harry says. “This isn’t a war, and we don’t kill people even when they deserve it. That’s not our job.”
First, they have to get anyone who’s in there, out. Then they can worry about putting out the magical fire.
“Because I’m not stupid enough to cast Dead Man’s Tongue,” she answers. “Even if I was, I’m not even sure that would work on a necromancy book.”
“No, I totally get it,” he assures her. “Will you be joining us in the chamber today?”
Pansy rolls her eyes. “We know that. He can obviously keep a secret, that’s not the point. No reason to give him another secret to keep if we don’t have to.”
He flinches and tries to step back, but there’s nowhere for him to run. Lucius jumps in front of him, and he’s not going to have enough time to push his father out of the way, what is he thinking –
(See the end of the chapter for
Pansy snorts, “Draco had a huge, embarrassing crush on Blaise’s mum when we were kids. He got over it, Blaise teased him about it
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Blaise sniffs, “my uncle changed the law. I just benefited from it.”
They just have to cross the main hallway, then they can start heading down to the dungeons using the East corner staircase. It’s not one of the main staircases so it doesn’t move, and it’s narrow and makes everyone who uses it dizzy, which means they probably won’t cross paths with anyone. They just have to get to it.
She pauses in running to stare at him. “
Perenelle steps forward, quiet and small compared to Umbridge, not that it matters. She’s clearly accustomed to being the most dangerous person in whatever room she enters. “My husband told you to leave.”
Judging by the Slytherins’s faces, it’s not nearly that easy. “It was made to choose a champion to duel to the death,” Pansy say quietly, “Non participation isn’t an option. It’s connected to you now, Harry. It’ll know if you don’t participate, if you lie.”
The others elbow their way onto the seats, the compartment still cramped even with the expansion charm, but Draco bypasses that completely and plops himself onto Harry’s lap. “This’ll make it a bit hard for me to play,” Harry points out, but considering the way his arms encircle Draco’s waist and he rests his chin on his shoulder, he assumes it’s only a token protest.
Ron walks over and throws an arm over his shoulders while everyone else bursts into applause and starts a very off key rendition of Happy Birthday. “Do you like it?”
Hermione is the one who sends her patronus to get Kingsley, which considering he’s head auror, maybe should have been his first choice.
Harry is sorely tempted to make a joke about how the word attempt is misrepresentative of Draco’s skillset, but considering he’s going to have to live with these people in his life forever, he restrains himself. Barely.
There’s no way he’s going to admit he doesn’t have enough magic to cast so much as Wingardium Leviosa, so he gives an elegant shrug that he’d learned from her.
Ron spreads out his arms, beaming. “The good news is I know what the first task is! The bad news is it’s dragons. You’re going to have to get past dragons. The other good news is that my brother Charlie is here. He says hi, and that he hopes you don’t die.”
“Miss Basilisk is not eating Miss Nagini,” she says, “I is assuming that means they are friends.”
A large silvery peacock cocks his head to the side, so well formed that Draco can see the different pattern of feathers on his chest, to say nothing of his tail feathers, which are even taller than Draco. Clearly he’s improved since third year.
If they think Poppy’s wards are going to keep them out, they’re mistaken. “How long have I been out?” Days?
“No it’s not,” Arthur says. “But we don’t have time to argue about it. Do you want me to escort you there?”
“Thanks!” He runs down the hall, leaping over the stair banister onto the floor below. He doesn’t even make a sound as he touches the ground. He’s managing to stand and walk just fine, but he can’t figure out how to open the door, so he just phases through it.
He’s been out for two days. No wonder Sirius looks so exhausted. Last night was the full moon, which meant he spent the whole night awake with Remus, and then came home to sit by him. He feels his cheeks flush, a little bit because he’s pleased but mostly because he’s embarrassed. Sirius didn’t need to do that! He was just tired out from summoning such a large patronus.
“Need I remind you, last time there was a book that talked to us, Ginny got possessed,” Neville says, but he doesn’t sound that put out. Draco and the twins had already cast every diagnostic spell they could think of, and as far as they could tell, there wasn’t anything malicious about it. But intent didn’t always equal effect, so Neville was right, they should be careful.
“A few more weeks?” Draco guesses. Millie and Blaise had apparently had a very productive discussion with Ollivander and Hermione seems really excited about whatever she and Ron are working on with the rubies. If they were trying to make this sword functional then they’d probably need something closer to a few years, but a decorative copy that just gives off a vaguely similar magical signature is pretty firmly in their wheelhouse. They made the Chimera map when they were in third year, after all. “Give or take.”
But he’s just blown up his aunt, threatened the Dursleys with magic, and now he’s out in the middle of the street with no idea where to go or what to do, and okay, he’s definitely panicking.
The magic hits the apple in a shower of cheerful yellow sparks. The apple grows in size, the stem extending and curling towards the ground, eventually forming four sturdy dark brown wheels. The apple has swelled to the size of a small carriage, and it shifts, turning from flesh into polished green glass, a window carving itself out and edged in gold, while the inside is the crisp white of the inside of an apple, except it’s all plush silk seating.
He shrugs, “She probably messed something up in that forest – it wasn’t a mistake she took your wand, and whatever she was supposed to be doing instead was important enough that Crouch got rid of a loyal and talented elf over it.”
“If you’re trying to use me to get to my father, I appreciate your ruthlessness, but you’re barking up the wrong tree,” he tells her. “My opinion wouldn’t influence his vote.”
Silver light pours out of her wand and briefly forms the image of a large wolf before it dissipates and is absorbed. That seems to shake his father out of his reverie, at least a little, because he holds out a hand and casts, “Expecto patronum.”
“This means they like us, right?” Harry whispers, nudging Draco in the ribs.
Ron and Lavender are laughing at him, but it’s one thing for him to be gross with his boyfriend, and quite another thing for anyone else to do it.
That’s how things stay, until Harry drags him into a dimly lit corridor after Transfiguration. “Are you mad?” Draco hisses. “Anyone could see us!”
If he’d stopped and listened for a second, Harry could have told him that wouldn’t work.
Draco gives him a tentative half smile, and Harry can’t help but return it.
“So it can be reported to my parents? Absolutely not.” His teeth are chattering. “Can I put my clothes back on now? I should have had Winky start a fire, or at least put a warming charm over the place.”
“I’m jealous,” Pansy sighs. “She’s doing what I would do if I didn’t have things like and investment portfolio or a public brand.”
Dumbledore stands, “Miss Delacour, please calm down–”
“Never,” he promises, and Harry’s hand find his just for a moment before they’re shooting across the grounds and then lifting into the air, the castle getting smaller and smaller below them, until it’s just him and Harry and the clear night sky.
As his boyfriend comes into focus now that he has his glasses on, it’s immediately clear that something is wrong. There are purple bruises under his eyes, like he hasn’t slept at all, and his smile looks more like a grimace. “I have to tell you something, and I don’t want you to be mad.”
Okay, this is going even more off script. Snape is supposed to tell him that it’s an acceptable option and send him on his way, like he does for literally every other student. “I am.”
“It just looks like English,” he says helplessly. “Do you think the language thing is part of the curse?”
What his dad means is he’s too impulsive. He rolls his eyes but refrains from getting into an argument with him over whether some of his soulmate’s foolhardy tendencies may or may not have rubbed off on him. “Just finished working on something, and I was too keyed up to sleep.”
Draco does everything right, the bowing and the eye contact, and he doesn’t walk forward until Buckbeak bows in return. He’s giving the hippogriff the same affectionate smile he gives Abigail when he says, offhand, “He is kind of ugly, isn’t he?”
It’s different than when he came home for the holidays, because this was summer, and this was the first one where he didn’t even have to see the Dursleys, where he could just go straight from the train station to home.
He looks over at all of them. Pansy, Blaise, and Millie are clustered together around a group of Ravenclaws and Beauxbatons students hotly debating something none of them care about, so they’re heckling both sides. The Patil twins are stunning in pretty saris and each of them with an equally pretty Durmstrang boy on their arm. All four houses and all three schools mingling and laughing together. He can’t help the unsettling feeling that this is the beginning of the end.
The merpeople crowd in, and if they decide to fight him, he’s very outnumbered, and literally out his element. “Not much use in coming all this way to lend a hand if we leave them here to die,” offers up a merperson who looks young, with long braided hair and large eyes.
He rolls his eyes, “They can move
Okay, actually, this wasn’t even a little bit what he wanted to talk to Asim about, but while he’s here. “What is it with you and my dad? How did you two know each other?”
Hemione looks like she’s considering just blasting her way past, and Blaise takes a subtle step away from her. “Can we have a hint?” she asks.
Snape looks at all of them, his lip curled with faint disdain, and says, “Malfoy, you handle the start of year announcements,” and then turns to go back to his quarters.
He hugs her back, pleased. She’d come in second in the first task, right after Cedric. “Sorry, I had to take care of something. Why are you looking for me? You should be celebrating!”
she says, delighted. “
“Will you finally tell me where the hidden staircase is? Tonks said her mum won’t break,” Sirius complains.
He nods.
“You’re done?” he asks, surprised. They’d been making good progress, but this place is huge. Sometimes it feels like new rooms pop up every time he turns a corner, and since this is a magical house, that’s not exactly outside the realm of possibility.
Percy rolls his eyes. “And you’re with me, and Harry’s been family practically since Mum picked him up on the platform five years ago.”
McGonagall’s eyes are unfocused. She’s not all there, not that Draco can blame her, but her voice almost sounds normal when she says, “Yes.”
,” Saida says in French, “
Thank Merlin.
She presses the back of her hand to his forehead, like she’s checking for a fever.
“Now that that’s over with,” Blaise says, passing the firewhiskey bottle to Ron, “I want to know where the hell Harry got a warded book on necromancy.”
He holds out the Marauder’s Map, and Harry takes it, cheeks flushing. He almost wants to keep it for himself, wants to keep this part of his dad for himself, but that’s not very fair. “Er, do you think, I mean – can I give this back to Fred and George? They’ve been making good use of it, is all, and it was a map made by pranksters for pranksters, so I feel like it’s something they should have.”
Draco opens his mouth to explain about what his dad had warned him about this morning, but when his breath comes out in cloud in front of him he realizes he doesn’t have to.
“Mr. Malfoy is dealing with some house matters,” Snape says, smoothly pulling everyone’s attention back to him. “I doubt he’d be very much help, anyway.”
“You is supposed to be saying yes, that is a thing you can be doing,” Winky says, but she sounds patient rather than patronizing. How often is she just hanging around Kreacher? He forgot that house elves could go invisible around people that weren’t their masters.
“Well,” Harry rubs the back of his head, “the thing is, that after you took it away, we kind of – made our own? Draco and Hermione had figured out all the spells and stuff you guys used to make if before you took it, so after that it was pretty easy to figure out how to do it ourselves. Your map is missing a couple things, anyway,” he adds, just to make Lupin laugh.
Draco shrugs, “I’ve been worse.”
“It looks good,” Draco confirms. “Can I ask why you’re using us for clout? Because you’ve never used Harry for clout before, and you certainly could have considering you’re in the same house and year as him.”
“Yes,” Sirius growls.
sorry this took so long, i've had a vicious cold for the past two weeks that's almost entirely gone now, but it really threw off my writing schedule. there will be one more chapter of phoenixes don't take orders, then on to the next book! i've outlined through sixth year, so we're not done yet :)
She can sound long suffering all she likes, but Theophania looks rather pleased with having four people fawning all over her.
“Go in the cave and tell us what’s there,” he says, then tacks on, “please.”
Astoria, who’s been laying on the couch flipping through a magazine with her wand in her hair, asks, “What now?”
, or anything. But we talk, and drink, and again, he really is very funny. I know that’s hard to believe, but it’s just the kind of humor you don’t pick up on until it’s too late and then you’re left laughing at the wrong moment, and then he mocks you for it.”
Draco pales, looking past Ron struggling to stuff his newly found and apparently not dead rat into his pocket. His dad
“Mother of Merlin,” Draco breathes, looking down at Abigail. “It’s a snake.”
He hopes Moody doesn’t plan on trying the Cruciactus Curse on them next. Crabbe and Goyle have been exposed to it, but surprisingly it had been his father who had drawn the line there, saying that was something for when he was older. The only other one in their year who had dealt with it was possibly Theodore, but he’s not sure because he’d never asked. He hadn’t thought it would ever come up.
“He saved a snake,” he sneers, and Draco doesn’t understand what that’s supposed to mean. “That’s not the part that matters.”
He hesitates. He’s inclined to do as Tonks tells him, but he’s very aware of the fact that Percy is running a significant chunk of their government, and he doesn’t want to get in the way of that.
Draco can’t breathe, and it has nothing to do with his still bleeding wound. Had they stuck close to Voldemort during this fight on purpose, just in case they had to do this? Is this is why they’d all done so well against so many Death Eaters? They’re good, but they’re not that good, not as disadvantaged as they’d been. His father doesn’t surprise him, even though he hadn’t expected it, but Sophia does. He’d known Sophia loved him, because she’s family, and his family is a lot less dysfunctional than Harry’s, minus all the murder. But there’s loving him, and there’s turning her back on Voldemort for him.
“Well, shit,” he says. “Uh, I’m going to go now.”
identical to Gryffindor’s sword. Harry’s never held the original, but when he picks up this one he can feel the power flowing through the blade and purification of the silver is strong enough that his skin tingles where he’s touching it.
The killing curse isn’t necromancy, but it is death magic. It’s also, from a necromancy perspective, incredibly simple.
She frowns and absently puts a couple pieces of toast by his elbow, like he won’t notice if she pretends she’s not doing it. He picks up a half piece and takes a bite to prevent himself from being surrounded by a small tower of breakfast food. “That doesn’t seem fair. Malfoy didn’t listen!”
Well, yes, because that would make him a liar and lying to Poppy never ends well for anyone, especially not him. She can and will take her displeasure out on him during healing tutoring sessions and he’d like to avoid that if he can. “It’s been a while since I’ve done a quality check on your potions cabinet, hasn’t it? All those terrible smelly potions that need to be looked over and reorganized based on effectiveness.”
hiding? If you really think there’s a chance we’d try and kill you, you didn’t come here alone. That would be kind of stupid, because if Harry and I tried really hard we might be able to do it, and you don’t get to be Archer of a herd by being stupid. And I’ve literally been taught by Firenze, so I know he isn’t.”
“Tell me something I don’t know.” He looks around her tornado of a room. “Do you have anything to wear in here? How do you find anything? I do have a house elf, you know, I’m sure she’d be happy to help you out.”
“So send Dumbledore a fucking patronus and call it a day,” Draco says, “They clearly know he’s missing, if not where he is. That’s probably why Dumbledore called Poppy away.”
“I’m sure I don’t want Voldemort in my house,” he answers, “but that’s not something that we get a say in. He wants to be here, and he’ll end up here.”
“Lavender can do what she wants,” Ron says. “
The next morning, Harry’s sitting up in bed and reading another of Draco’s letters. He’d given the extendable ears to Winky, who’d hugged him around the knees before going back. It’s still not quite dawn, light just beginning to filter through his window, which is why he’s surprised by a knock on his door.
“I astral projected into Nagini’s body while Voldemort was controlling her, and he was trying to use her to kill your dad. But it’s okay! I pushed us both out of her body, and then Nagini defected to our side, or at least left his, either way she’s currently wrapped around your dad. Voldemort is pissed.”
She’s starting to get a little wild around the eyes, which is never a good sign for any of them. A frazzled Hermione is a scary Hermione.
Ron opens his mouth, but Fred raises his hands. He and George share a look, but he only sighs and says, “Fairs fair, I suppose, if we know their secrets it’s only right that they know ours.”
Harry laughs so hard his stomach hurts, and doesn’t stop even when Hermione threatens to set him on fire. It feels good to laugh, and whatever’s gone wrong, he’ll find out tomorrow.
Sirius rubs his head, and then pulls Ophelia to her feet. Sophia is stirring too, which is good, because it means she’s not dead. Remus pushes through the crowd, many of whom are already leaving, making their escape before they need to explain themselves. Remus glances at Sirius, but runs to Harry first. “Are you okay?” he asks, then says, “You’re grounded forever.”
Tonks’s hair becomes a vibrant purple and shortens into a severe bob. For a moment true affection shines through before she’s back to grinning manically. “Nice to meet you, Harry. I see your date is my cousin.”
She has a point.
Ouch. It’s true, but still. “That’s what makes a Mother a Mother. We’re not born necromancers. We are born able to access the magic from the realm of the dead. That’s what they mean when they say we live in Lady Death’s shadow and she knows our name. When I perform necromancy spells, I don’t even have to try and pull the magic from the other realm. It just happens. When I try and use my own magic, things like the graveyard in fourth year happens, or when I got distracted with the inferi. That would have killed anyone else who tried but it didn’t kill me. My body and magic can handle necromantic magic to extent that other people’s can’t. So the necromancy spells I can perform are more powerful and they’re less likely to harm me. But people aren’t able to hold an infinite amount of magic inside their body at one time. A Mother, or someone good enough to access the necromantic magic from the other realm, can only hold as much necromantic magic at one time as they can their own magic. Just because you have access to a practically infinite amount of necromantic magic doesn’t mean that you can use it.”
Draco banishes Abigail back to her tank, and then leaves him alone in the classroom, still laughing.
“Darling,” Tonks says, her wand held in a tight grip, “I think Pete set you up.”
is about you, Sev. This is about me, and what I want.”
They’re making a lot of sense. “Okay, yeah, you’re right. Still a bit weird that Snape was friends with my mum, though.”
Harry stops resisting him, and picks up the pace. This works up until a green smoky spell appears from seemingly nowhere, and Ron just barely glances up before throwing himself to the ground, yanking Harry and Hermione along with him.
“Yes,” he says, then rummages around in his pockets. “I have – a chocolate frog, if you’d like. They’re quite delicious.”
“No,” he says, and the unexpected honesty of it makes him tense in Harry’s arms. He hadn’t meant to say that. Harry rubs his hands down Draco’s back, trying to sooth him. “But come out of that maze alive, and I will be.”
Dumbledore raises an eyebrow. “I don’t think that’s-”
She taps her wand to his head, and there’s the feeling like a cold egg being cracked over him. “Thank you for what you did,” she whispers, reaching out to squeeze his arm. “I don’t know what Cedric would have done otherwise.”
Shit.
(she's added more since the last chapter!)
” he says, and it’d be more convincing if he wasn’t leaning most of his weight against Draco’s back. “He’s teaching me the patronus charm. The boggart is useful, and obviously not as dangerous as a real dementor. Put your wand down, you lunatic!” Oh, that’s actually a rather good idea. But a patronus charm? That’s not something most people learn without going through auror training. Harry tugs inefficiently at his arm, but his wand is still trained on Lupin. “What are you thinking anyway, attacking a professor?”
Theophania curls back as if she’s been struck, but neither of them look away from the other.
“I didn’t think he would go through with it,” Dumbledore says, sounding almost irritated, and Harry starts in surprise. Is this what Dumbledore sounds like when he talks to other adults? He almost sounds human. “At this point, I believe young Mr. Malfoy would doubt me if I told him the sky was blue.”
“What’s going on?” Seamus demands, his hand clasped in Dean’s. “Where are we going?”
,” she answers. “
He follows the blood trail down, swimming deeper and deeper. At a point the sunlight doesn’t reach him anymore, which is another thing that doesn’t make any sense, the water is clear enough that the sun should still be able to reach him, but he doesn’t have the time to question it. He pulls out his wand and casts, “Lumos!”
Draco frowns, but Zaira doesn’t miss a beat. “Of course you are. You have your mother’s face, dear, and there was hardly a woman more lovely than Pandora. I’ve heard you’re excelling at divination?”
“Well, I would have been hard pressed to look worse,” he says.
A hand pushes itself out of the ground, and Harry screams. A decayed skeleton rises from Voldemort’s father’s grave, and the glaring ghost sinks into the bones.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione are still yelling, but Draco thinks back to one of their last patronus lessons with Lupin, and takes a closer look at Black. His robes are tattered, and hang off his skeletal frame. It’s covered in dirt and mud but it’s there - wrapped around his wrist is a mark, a delicate sprig of wolfsbane.
“I can’t imagine what you would think up if you were trying to do it on purpose,” she mutters. “Alright, everyone to the headmaster’s office. I’m sure your sister and brothers will be along shortly.” She looks at Harry. “Can you walk, Mr. Potter?”
Harry is convinced Lucius Malfoy is a bad person. But he’s also pretty sure he’d eviscerate anyone who harmed his son, and Harry’s kind of in favor of that general attitude. But maybe it’s a good thing Draco’s fighting with his parents? They are, well, Death Eaters.
He’s read it. The pages missing from the version that Slughorn gave him are there.
“Why didn’t you tell me that Snape and my mum were soulmates?” he interrupts.
“I do learn from my mistakes,” Dumbledore says quietly.
They all crowd around it, and the thing is the map shows where the
“She were unable to write down her results,” he says. “The theory and the math holds that it’s possible, but it’s just a theory. What other theory was in the book?”
“Well, I said it was because they did unforgivable things, but he didn’t tell me the answer,” he scowls. “Are you going to? If I have to figure it out by unscrambling the equations in that book, it’s going to be a while.”
“I haven’t done any of the theoretical work on light yet, I’ve been focusing on metalwork,” he says, not raising his eyes from the parchment. “So I can’t help you with that, and you’ll have to wait for anything else. I’m almost done breaking down this charm for Flitwick, and if you make me lose my place, I’ll cry.”
Winky is unimpressed. “I is wondering when you would be coming. Kreacher is a bad elf.”
He turns away and looks to Draco when he says, “Go ahead.”
Harry looks at them, and realizes – the adults don’t know, of course they don’t know, and he has to be the one to tell them.
Of course, McGonagall chooses that moment to go running onto the grounds, moving faster than he’s ever seen her move before. “Oh, shit,” Lavender breathes. Harry feels a seed of doubt. Surely if this was all part of Hagrid’s plan, then McGonagall wouldn’t be getting in the middle of it. Right?
open presents.
“Sure,” she says, “I like Harry, but he’ll have to get over it. He can take a joke – it’s so juvenile anyway, I hardly think he’ll stay awake at night crying over it. Why’d you pick it?”
He shakes his head, “Pansy’s the only one of us that’s any good at transfiguration. Didn’t Narcissa teach you that umbrella charm? Can you cast it smaller?”
Percy gives her a relieved smile. “It’s okay. I know she’s terrible, and I was serious about it getting worse. She’s made up a position called High Inquisitor, and it’s basically going to put her entirely in charge of Hogwarts. I fought against it, but the Wizengamot hates her too, and they’re all willing to give her whatever she wants if it means keeping her away from them.”
Quinn frowns. “It’s not about that, but fine. It has to be before the holidays, otherwise my brewing schedule is going to be fucked. I need to speak to you alone.”
Hagrid looks like he’s holding back a fresh wave of tears. On one hand, Draco thinks it’s just what he deserves – who brings animals like that to a group of kids? He’d followed instructions, and the savage animal had clawed at him anyway, just because he’d said he was ugly. On the other hand, Harry
His mind wanders back to Moody, and how quick that walk must have been, then he shakes his head. He’s clearly spending too much time around Luna, and it’s making him paranoid, is all.
How on earth did merpeople get involved in this? “Chief instead of a prince? That’s a downgrade. Also, honey, I feel as if I’m missing a lot of context here.”
Well, he’s got a point there. “Your robes look good.”
The dragon thrusts his head around Harry and down, and Draco is convinced that he’s going to die. But instead it just looks at him for a long moment. Then it’s tongue darts out of the its mouth, like Abigail’s does when she’s tasting the air, and grazes the side of his face. He guesses it understands English.
“Be quiet,” he snaps. Abigail raises her head from his shoulders and lets out a low, angry hiss. Sophia freezes, then slowly shifts to look over his shoulder, and he knows that she understands when she tenses against his back.
He stands up in front of everyone, taking out his wand and flicking it through the air, so green words are left shimmering in front of them in his boyfriend’s perfect handwriting. “Reasons I think we should steal Gryffindor’s sword from Dumbledore’s office. One, it belongs to the goblins and returning it them is the right thing to do.” Hermione nods very seriously. Pansy and Ginny roll their eyes. “Two, it’s the only way to get the goblins to accept the commission to make the magic bank and therefore the only way to prevent me from spending the next fifty years trying to figure out how to do it myself.” That seems compelling for Luna, Neville, and Millie. “Three, it’ll piss Dumbledore off.” That gets Blaise and Pansy. “And four, I think it’ll be really funny.” Ron and Ginny grin, because yes, it will.
Blaise goes cross eyed staring at the test tube and then pushes it away. “Okay, fine. But we’re documenting every single incremental change we can quantify. Doing something once is an accident. Doing it multiple times is the first step us actually making something useful.”
“Let’s not fight,” Ron says, holding up his hands. “Dad, thanks, but it’s really okay. We’ll go wait upstairs, it’s not a big deal.”
“You’re not telling us the truth, either,” Blaise says, scowling.
start. She’s not sick. She’s dead. “No, this can’t - the whole bloody point of Potter is that he’s supposed to protect you, what use is he-” Snape pushes himself to his feet and goes through the house, shouting, “Potter! Where are you? It’s Severus! I mean, it’s Snape!” He shakes his head, muttering to himself, “Idiot, he’d probably taken the kid and ran - why didn’t he give the kid to her, why leave her behind to fight, even if she is a,” he stumbles, tripping over something, and Harry and Snape look down at the same time.
He turns to face them, and frowns, “Uh, fluently? Or just like, enough to not cause an international incident at a dinner party?”
Neither Ron nor Krum had vomited or fallen asleep or stopped drinking by the time it was time for everyone to go back to the dorms, so they’d called it a tie, shook on it, and swore to beat the other next time.
“How inappropriate,” a sugar sweet voice simpers, and just like that Harry’s grin slides off his face.
He almost makes a derisive comment about Harry’s intelligence, then catches himself. Muggle raised, muggle raised, why must he always forget that his soulmate is muggle raised? He’s lucky Harry knows up from down most days. “House elves can’t divulge secrets of their former masters. I mean, they
The Gryffindor common room is empty of everyone except Hermione, who’s lying down on one of the couches with her neck on edge of the couch so her hair can fall over the side to avoid it being squashed. An empty Gryffindor common room before midnight is unusual enough that Draco actually looks twice, as if there were people he’d missed the first time. “Where is everyone?”
“What do you need us to do?” Draco asks.
“What?” Blaise asks. “What are you talking about?” Harry takes the note out of his pocket and hands it over to the Slytherins. Pansy snatches it from his hands and holds it up so they can all read it. “Flamel the alchemist?”
He breaks the spell without responding to the second part. He doesn’t like making promises that he doesn’t intend to keep.
“Of course,” he says, confused. It’s still too early for anyone but Hagrid and the house elves to be up, so it’s just them, standing at the edge of the great lake at barely past dawn, the air still chilly and heavy in the air.
he asks, because for once the story he’s been told about the founders doesn’t feel right, doesn’t feel as if it fits. He knows that Slytherins aren’t all bad, so it makes sense that their founder wouldn’t be either, but this is – more, than he thought there’d be, and he’s not sure what to do with it.
Harry of course intends to fill his friends in on everything that happened last night, but all the things that happened last night means he oversleeps and has to rush to get ready and down to the great hall in time to get to class.
“We’re throwing a party in the Shrieking Shack. Durmstrang, Beauxbatons, and Hogwarts fourth year and up.” He pauses, considering, then tacks on, “Plus Luna.”
to be angry, he sees the anger on his teammates’ faces. But the Slytherins are hoisting Draco onto their shoulders and he’s laughing, and Harry can’t even remember the last time he saw Draco really smile in public, never mind laugh, and he can’t be that upset about it.
About thirty minutes pass, and two merpeople bring an unconscious Fleur to the surface, but Harry is nowhere in sight. They twist their arms to direct the current to push her to the shore, then disappear back into the water. She doesn’t look hurt, but he’s too far away to tell for sure. Cho and Viktor hurry over to her, but before they make it over she gasps awake and pushes herself upright. Her bubble head charm shatters, and she pulls herself to her feet, swaying. Viktor and Cho stop in their tracks, and Draco doesn’t understand why until she turns to face them.
Ron leans across the table and grabs Cho’s hand, and Harry’s confused until he sees the sparkling ring on her finger. “Cho Chang!” Ron says, grinning wide, “Are you
“I nicked it from Sprout’s private stores – she only puts up locking charms but no sensors because she thinks curious children should have access to restricted ingredients. If you’re smart enough to get past her wards, then she figures you’re smart enough to not seriously harm yourself,” Blaise says. “Longbottom nearly caught me while I was leaving, but he takes stuff from there nearly often as I do, so I’m sure it’s fine.”
“Always,” he says, then shouts goodbye to everyone before dragging Draco to the roof.
Harry’s not planning to make him, but he’s not the only one who matters here. “Okay. I – okay. Everything’s going to be fine,” he decides, even though the future seems more uncertain and dangerous than ever.
“Oh, absolutely,” he agrees, “Unfortunately, if they want me to tell them things, then they should have thought about that before – well, before we started fighting. Now we’ll all just have to deal with the consequences.”
Then, because clearly their situation hasn’t hit rock bottom yet, the dementors arrive.
“You don’t have to be so rough,” Neville complains, but doesn’t do much to disentangle himself from Blaise’s grip. “Are you sure we should be seen together? You’re acting very familiar. Although, you are also being very threatening.”
“Sure,” Harry says.
Draco guides him through spinning him, and steps neatly back into his arms, smiling. “See? You can do this. You’ll be fine.”
Lucius tries to form words, but can’t choke anything out past the screaming sobs. Draco glances around the room again, slower this time, and a sort of cold, horrible realization settles in his gut.
This time when Firenze sighs, he lets them all hear it. He’s fond when he says, “No, you shouldn’t, but what you should have done hasn’t stopped you before and I doubt it’ll stop you in the future. We have a perimeter alert spell. We know when students enter the forest, Harry. We knew you were there, as we’ve known all the other times, and when students who aren’t you do the same. You are neither the first nor the only student to break the rules, and as I’m not your professor anymore, it’s not really my concern if or when you enter the forbidden forest. You didn’t do anything to deserve Archer Damsa’s ire. Sometimes circumstances are unfortunate without you being to blame for them.”
“This shows you are very wise,” he says, and laughs when Asim glares are him. “Sorry, sorry, show me your notes, I’m paying attention.”
“Are you – a battery?” Asim ask, rubbing a hand over his face.
Draco blinks. “How far along are you in that thing?” He’s been so preoccupied with his own independent studies that he hasn’t had the time to pay attention to Harry’s deep dive into necromancy, which Harry doesn’t mind. Half the time he’s not sure what he’s doing, exactly, so it’s better that he doesn’t have to try and explain it to Draco. He’s low on time on top of it anyway considering how much time he spends planning their RA lessons.
“A little bit of prying,” Remus amends. “Because, you see, we can’t help but notice that you were yelling this morning, and then you spent hours doing dangerous manual labor, all before breakfast, which is a little odd. A bit out of character, if you will.”
Luckily, Hermione knows what he’s asking. “Teuila carried him, but he’s the biological son of Kalama and an unknown royal merman from Teuila’s people.”
Harry heart jumps to his throat when he sees Draco’s skin burst open, the magic settling deep into his skin and ripping it apart, and for a moment it’s easy to push away the voices curling at the edge of his consciousness, the ones he’s been hearing ever since they opened the door down this hallway. Millie screams from behind Draco’s shield. “Stupefy!” he snarls, aiming for Voldemort’s chest, but unsurprised when he steps back and out of the way. He just wants his attention off his boyfriend, wants Draco to have a chance to heal himself, since it’s not like the rest of them are any good at it.
Tonks acts like she can’t hear her. The circles underneath her eyes deepen and darken and her hair lengthens and turns a mousy brown. She gathers it up, pauses, and Draco wordlessly takes out his own hair tie and offers it to her. “Draco, when I tell you to, drop the shield. Harry, you recast it. Draco’s going to need his strength. You know how to cast a shield charm, right?”
“And if we’re busy, we’ll throw you at the senior prefects,” Draco says, jerking a thumb at the sixth and seventh year prefects, who pretend to look outraged. They’re supposed to act in a smaller role after fifth year, but Draco has no problem with tapping them to do things. He really is too busy for this.
“Okay, this is nice,” Harry says as they’re walking down, the sand sinking beneath his feet and between his toes. It’s so soft. He didn’t know sand could be this soft, and this pale. The waves are gentle and curving, and even by the weak light of the moon, it’s easy to see how clear and perfect the water is.
For the first time, Harry is burning with curiosity over whatever their conversation behind closed doors was about. Neither her husband nor children had done much to sway her, but she’s still looking at Sirius as her shoulders slump. “Fine.”
“Well, we’re going to find out, aren’t we?” he says. Ron glares at him. “Relax, Filius went over ward breaking with me weeks ago. What could possibly go wrong?”
He’s distracted the rest of the day, burning with curiosity about what this could be about. The hardest part, of course, is getting out of bed without waking Nagini. But he manages, tiptoeing out of his room and down the hallway, until he can take one of the secret passageways into the dungeons. The Western side is used for potion making and storage, but the Eastern side is kept mostly empty. It consists of a dark, damp room that’s intended use is herbology, and a room twice the size of their dining room and completely empty.
Ron gives him a friendly clap on the shoulder, and Blaise almost looks like he doesn’t want to rip his arm off. “Mate, you haven’t seen a nightmare until you’ve seen Hermione on three hours of sleep reciting every general in the goblin wars for the past three centuries. In the middle of
“No one to send running away screaming when you flood the bathroom?” he asks sympathetically.
Dumbledore’s leaning on his elbows with hands are clasped in front his mouth, which Harry’s almost certain is to hide that he’s smiling, because his eyes are. “I see.”
“You mean you’ll make
Then, just as Dumbledore is getting up to speak, the goblet changes color again, and it spits out a fourth slip of paper.
He's okay. He’s not as good as Hermione, or anywhere close to as good as Ron. He likes seeing a completed circle and trying to figure out what it does more than he enjoys actually making the circles, even though the part where he gets to do alchemy is super fun.
Fred apparently decides that magic is beneath him, because he’s closing the distance between them with the clear intention of punching Keenan in the face.
