Draco blinked thinking over what Orion said back when they’d first met, an idea quickly forming in his head. “You guys want to be friends then, you’re essentially blackmailing me into being your friend” The blonde deadpanned plainly.
Harry’s blank expression slowly morphed into a scowl, “I’m going to kill him.”
Blaise sighed behind him sounding put upon, “Look Malfoy, this isn’t how these things work okay, we’re not-”
Leo smiled as he watched Millie, Carina, and Lyra huddle together as they laughed and walked the dirt path down to Hogsmeade Leo walked lazily between Julian and Theo both of whom were discussing the new possible recruits Daphne Greengrass and Tracy Davis, both girls had expressed a possible interest in their cause. Theo and Julian were discussing ways to test their sincerity.
Carina’s wild dark blonde curls framed a happily smiling face as she bent to kiss the boy breathless. Her clothes were more relaxed and casual then any of them had seen her in before. A skin tight Brown t-shirt, with a beige knitted scarf around her neck, worn blue jeans, and brown knee high boots. The girl looked good.
“Say it love, I need to hear it,” Draco urged sitting up on Harry’s thighs still pinning his hands down.
Harry hummed in concern before lifting the corner of his comforter inviting the blonde in, “just don’t try anything funny when I’m asleep alright?” He teased trying to cheer the blonde up.
“Are you cold?” Leo asked suddenly, they hadn’t stopped at either of their Common rooms and Draco hadn’t worn his School robes to Supper.
Hermione looked up at him in disbelief before showing the picture to Ron to get his opinion.
Leo didn't tell them why he was planning an outing again so soon. Or why he was insisting they call him Leo. He wanted it to be one big surprise. Not that they hadn't had enough of those these past two weeks. He figured they deserved some good news, what with the bad news they were about to receive. Dumbledore being an obstacle was not in they're plan.
you do something about it.”
Malfoy blinked at him again eyes wide in surprise, before quickly dropping his head looking at his shoes, his messy blonde hair hiding his expression.
“Then we’ll destroy him.” Carina agreed a dangerous gleam in her eyes, she had to stay focused she couldn’t let her insecurities effect the mission.
Leo’s expression shuttered before going blank, “You wet it then.”
Harry frowned, breathing heavily as he tried to work out what to do. Draco didn’t seem to want him to do anything though. He was basically attacking Harry’s neck so he could ask. Draco grabbed the loops if his jeans dragging him up and into his lap wrapping Harry’s legs around his waist as he did. “I’m in charge do only as I say,” He demanded before claiming Harry’s mouth again.
Leo chuckled darkly, “You really want me violate you in the house elves corridor?”
The rest of Harry’s Birthday passed much more peacefully, there was a small disturbance, when an hour later Mr. Evan’s took a call only to return twenty minutes later looking solemn. After much prodding from Lily he announced him imminent divorce. Lily and Harry had quickly apologized, the latter looking miserable.
“Your parents are going to be home Tomorrow Kid, you might want to start thinking about what you’re going to tell them. My suggestion… is waiting until before you’re both preparing to leave for school. Let them Cool down while you’re both safely tucked away at Hogwarts.” Sirius patted the blondes shoulder before climbing to his feet and heading for the Kitchen. The two watched him go curiously, not sure what to think of his new attitude towards Draco. After a few seconds they shrugged and turned back to the T.V.
Harry groaned pitifully, “Draco I don’t know about this on-AH,” He cried out whining again as Draco forced his tongue deeper this time and left it there.
With that Draco swept down the aisle and out of the classroom. He froze when he spotted Blaise, Adrian, and…  “Ron?”
Harry was about to overload. "STOP!" He bellowed jerking his hand out of hers when she grabbed it as if to get his attention.
“Oh so you’re the bloke he stalks,” Paul interrupted, a sly smile on his face, as if he’d just revealed something Draco hadn’t known.
Hermione- Carina Aurora Black (Harry's Cousin)
“I love you,” He chuckled helplessly, before smothering her response with another kiss.
“Oh I’m very busy as you can see,” Julian held up his book, brows raised in mock sincerity.
“Hello cousin,” Draco jumped at the drawling voice and about dropped the mirror.
“That’s so wrong, Orion’s got such a vibrant personality, why would anyone want to change that?”
Draco blushed feeling embarrassed, "I could have sworn I closed it." Draco insisted.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
“UNCLE SIRIUS! GET. OUT!”
Professor Flitwick had puffed up frantically when he’d grabbed Chang, “Mr. Koshkov! As your newly appointed head of House I can’t allow you to man handle another student!”
"I'll write him myself," Lyra frowned, watching him like a hawk. She obviously wasn’t fooled, but she wouldn’t call him on it… yet.
"Fine" Leo relented, but he wasn’t going to like it.
Orion pinched the bridge of her nose, as if praying for patience, “Maybe, but he’s also Hot and Unattainable, that makes him even sexier. Women love what they can’t have, just as much as Men do.”
The twins obviously were facing a similar dilemma, confusion clouding their mirrored eyes.
Lyra huffed, her hot breath seeping through his slacks. Causing him to squirm in discomfort, this girl was going to bloody well kill him. Julian sighed tugging lightly at her messy bun. She obviously got the message as she sat up.
“Look Ms…”
Julian raised an unimpressed brow, shrugging both girls off, they were making his skin crawl. He’d already acquired his true goal anyway.
Julian closed the door behind him looking worn out. It had obviously taken a lot out of him going toe to toe with the raging Weasley Matriarch, "That was exhausting mate."
Ron merely brushed his thumb fondly over hers and gave her hand a gentle squeeze. “Just wishing Professor Whinsaw would just get himself fired already.”
Sirius smiled and hugged her back happy tears falling from his eyes for the second time that week. His Niece… well, who would have thought a hug from a fifteen year old girl could make him feel this important… this needed. Reggie’s little girl, he protect her with his life. He’d never leave her side again.
“What about our lives after school?” Millie asked shrewdly, she wasn’t convinced quite yet, and she wasn’t about to do anything that might compromise her standing in life after Hogwarts.
“Did you…?” Draco asked quietly, afraid to even finish his sentence.
Harry looked up in surprise, “Sure, but is everything ok?”
The blonde quirked a brow smirking in amusement, “Actually my question was, ‘What the bloody hell you thought you were doing stalking sitting up in that tree?’ but since you weren’t there today it’s actually ‘where the hell were you?’ I guess you could say I’d grown use to my little stalker.”
Draco flipped them before Harry had time to really process that he’d moved, “Don’t make me any promises love, I’ll hold you to them.”
“You wanted me, can’t back out now,” Draco chuckled nipping at his jaw.
“We’re Slytherins Leo, and we spend most of our time with you, we were bound to figure it out.” Millicent explained, smiling sheepishly.
The three nodded, attempting to quell their laughter, "Yeah."
Harry blinked at the waitress’s quickly retreating back before looking down at the pizza. Draco was eyeing him and the pizza warily.
Draco gasped and moaned at the feeling of hot nearly painful pleasure that coursed through him and barley felt the finger shoving itself in his ass.
Dumbledore was having a
Remus grimaced, ever since they’d found the girl on that cold frozen bench Moony had claimed her as his and Remus did feel the protective pull to rip the boys arms off every time he so much as brushed shoulders with her. But he was able to control himself, sooth the wolfs nerves with a simple truth. “You’ve still got Lyra.”
Draco scoffed shooting an amused look over his shoulder, “Har this is a primarily muggle town, anyone who’d recognize me is back that way. Even so, I’m wearing muggle clothes, no Witch or Wizard with half a brain would DARE accuse a Malfoy of wearing muggle garb much less to either Lucius or Narcissa themselves.”
‘Draco’, it was nice to have a name to go with the face, and what a nice face it was. Draco smirked as he seemed to size Harry up, “So, to what did I owe the pleasure of your company?”
"This is going to be a lot crazier then I first imagined," Lyra chuckled, taking off her school robes and tossing them across her seat before sitting.
“And why on Earth are they allowing you to address them so informally, as if you were-”
The others nodded pushing away their own plates and standing. They walked out of the Hall passing the Slytherins as they went. Leo ordered Tracy not to look back. He wanted to see how loyal Daphne was to her friend.
“And…,” Draco requested, raising a brow, “What have you learned.”
“I could put on the spoiled, rich, snobby, heiress act.” Lyra mused, before smiling wickedly, “And Theo and Cari can be the sickeningly in love new couple. You know the couple that’s so into each other and sweet they make people squirm in discomfort?”
Ginny scoffed, obviously oblivious to it, "Yeah, remember when you used to be one."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~HP~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~DM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry’s heart broke a little.
forgotten. Draco sighed as she lectured him on hygiene as she shuffled through the filthy clothes piled in the corner of his room.
Pansy meandered through the halls of the large ‘Castle(?)’ not quite sure where she was going. The brunette had originally been looking for Draco, only to spot him out a window snogging Potter out in the gently falling snow, truly a romantic setting. The young Slytherin had given up on Romance long ago herself. Her mother had seen to that, Pansy was to marry one of her Fathers business partners in place of her precious elder sister, Delilah Parkinson had been born a sickly child and despite growing out of her illness had always been the favored child. What Delilah wanted, she usually got, leaving Pansy with whatever lost her interest, including it seemed an overly interested widower with an interest in young girls. The man was in his late thirties now and was aging quite poorly, he’d been a handsome young man in his mid twenties when Delilah had grown taken with him, being a boy crazed preteen herself at the time.  By the time Pansy was preparing to leave for school, Delilah’s interest had faded, along with most of the man’s good looks. No longer interested and with the man demanding the right to a Parkinson heiress’ hand the enabling couple looked to their youngest and made the offer, with the reputation of the entire Parkinson estate riding on Pansy’s virtue and willing participation, the Parkinson Matriarch cast a horrible spell on her youngest. Anyone looking at the young girl would see a plain, wholesome girl with nary an attractive feature in sight. Pansy of course could see through it, but she knew what others saw, being quiet the skilled legimens she was able to see what her mother had done to insure her purity. She didn’t
They were drawing a crowd again. Theo and Millicent were standing warily off to the side as they’d been walking with Leo.
“I won’t hurt Harry,” Draco promised as Sirius started out of the room with a cup of tea, “I won’t let Lucius or Narcissa either.”
Harry sighed as he stepped out of the Floo. He was relieved his Dad was alright, but he’d worried about poor Draco, waiting alone back home. It was times like these he wished his Father could be more open minded. Unfortunately that was not the case, and he was sure if he found out about Draco now, he’d curse his boyfriend into oblivion.
(1) Hallo Liebes - Hello Love
“Theo?” She asked quietly, plying with their linked hands idly, admiring the way they seemed to fit perfectly together.
“Malfoy,” Leo called stopping the blonde who had attempted to turn around and sneak away before Leo saw him. The blonde sagged and slowly turned back around to face him.
Adrian shook his head frowning, “No, that’s not what we said,” he insisted, looking baffled.
“Nope,” Ron grunted tossing a chip in his mouth.
“Cave Inimicum?” Leo asked Julian frowning, he’d never heard of the spell.
“And who led you to that idea?” Julian asked calmly, though his stomach was in knots. Lyra was too edgy for this to be a result of her concern for her cousin. If this was about a girl she’d have come in ranting about ‘that Bitch!’ as she’d done when Lisa Turpin had purposely dumped her potted soil all over her in Herbology then had the audacity to accuse Lyra of sleeping with Leo, (Of Course Dumbledore was telling the truth about them not ACTUALLY being related) and telling her to stop being a greedy slut and to share him. Lyra had proceeded to punch her in the nose before hitting her with the hive-conjuring curse and a hair loss hex. The hives had spelled out ‘Stupid Whore’ on several parts of her body.
“To make sure you come back.” Harry explained with a wink.
“Rion, Mik,” Draco smiled winking at Harry in greeting.
Julian pretend to think for a moment pushing his self of the wall when he saw Nott and Bulstrode exit the common room, “Well it could have been about your situation, possibly some advice, maybe a warning or two. You really never know with these things for all you know I may have been looking to help.” Draco raised his eyebrows in disbelief. “But this is all Hypothetical right Malfoy?” Julian chuckled lightly walking toward his confused comrades. “No, if you want help with Leo I suggest the Library Malfoy, that’s your only hope.”
“Boss,” he returned cautiously, playing the part of a loyal lackey perfectly.
Draco chuckled, “You know I have to rebel as much as possible, and if my room is messy Narcissa and Lucius won’t bother me in here.”
Malfoy adjusted the temperature again watching the potion carefully until it bubbled into a bright red again.
“Draco hexed him to Bray like a donkey every time he opens his mouth,” Remus chuckled lightly immediately stopping at the cold look the man threw him.
“So Ms Black, how was your night in the Tower?” Draco asked mildly as he led her down to the end of the table gesturing for Blaise and Adrian to take the seats across from them.
Draco choked feeling a sense of dread wash over him, his boyfriends Father was coming to kill him. He hadn’t even gotten to tell him he loved him yet, he hadn’t even really come to terms with that fact yet himself.
“Who would you be using these with other then me?” Draco asked with a slight edge in his tone.
Carina and Theo found Draco in the Library starring into a book with a blank expression on his face. The lack of movement in his eyes told them clearly that he wasn’t actually reading it.
I may or may not edit this chapter down the line, like I said there are a few parts i'm still ify on so I apologize if you notice something I missed or if parts of it seem disjointed or rushed.
A slow amused smirk curled Blaise’s lips, “You realize what you’re saying …? You do know who I am right?”
Carina grimaced, understanding his unspoken end to the conversation. "I don't like it, I'll help, but I don't like it."
Orion looking mildly shamefaced came over to pat his shoulder consolingly, “Of course he wouldn’t. Mika and I meant it when we said we’ve never seen him so devoted to someone before. He really likes you Harry, he wouldn’t even think to look at anyone else the way he looks at you. He’s going to do whatever he can to be with you.”
Leo shrugged, before attempting to change the subject "I'm going to write to Sirius, want me to say anything for you?"
"I'll get straight to the point. I know your rebelling against Dumbledore. I've never been fond of the man and honestly I don't trust him. So whatever big plot you have going on… I want in." Millicent raised an eyebrow threateningly, as if warning him not to reject her, though her stance was a business. The girl was defiantly not joking.
The others froze in shock, a folder slipping from Carina’s numb fingers, the papers fluttering messily to the floor.
And it was a wonderful sight indeed, Draco stared fixedly at his ass as he walked. He just wanted to… bite it. Draco bit his lip and blushed, when had his thoughts become so bold?
Draco Malfoy paced back and forth before the Floo, his agitation evident in every stride. He’d forced Blaise and Pansy to be ready a half an hour before they were scheduled to leave, he’d wanted to be ready the moment they were set to go.
Malfoy dropped them in, adjusting the flame again, “Heat until turquoise,” Malfoy mumbled to himself. A small smile flirted with corner of his mouth when a second later the potion slowly began to brighten to a brilliant turquoise color.
“Now Harry,” Draco drawled in amusement catching the other boy’s hands and using them to pin the raven down, “Why so impatient?”
“Stay away from him,” Leo hissed shoving the boy back against the wall and storming away down the hall. Muttering curses under his breath.
Harry frowned, turning to look at the blonde, “Bedroom phase?”
“Boys,” The twins sighed in union.
“NO! Don’t even speak. You have no idea what you’re talking about Carina.” Leo snarled, causing the girl to pause in shock. “You’re head is so full of hot air you barely take the time to stop and THINK before settling on an idea so fucking far from the truth it’s pathetic! You’re not infallible Carina. Not even you can have all the right answers all the bloody time!”
Remus wasn’t sure why he was surprised when Sirius slunk moodily into his study a few moments after his house elf Jonsi informed him of a disturbance in the west wing and asked if he’d like him to  intervene. Not wanting to interrupt or disturb in case it was merely a small argument (Jonsi tended to get fussy when the children argued) he’d waved it off and asked for tea to occupy the nervous elf.
Carina frowned slightly, she didn’t like being made fun of “It’s not cute, and we’re serious, believe me we have a whole lot more planned then a few pranks.”
"Watch it boss," Lyra warned, glare warning off his temper.
Ron- Julian Michael Prewett (Fabian Prewett's Only son)
“Not oglin’ tha’ Neighbor a yers again wer ya?” Seamus demanded in exasperation.
"Sorry!" Carina called back to the annoyed manager.
“So Prongslet, any hunky young blokes catch your eye? Have you shagged any of them yet? Which do you prefer top or bottom? I heard some blokes prefer both, do you?”
Twin- Lyra Amalthea Black (Carina's sister)
"BOY Stop that racket!"
Lyra and Carina exchanged an eerily identical exasperated look with Julian sighed pinching the bridge of his nose. Carina continued on shaking her head in resignation, “He’ll be deaf by twenty-five… if that.”
"Harry get OVER here!"
“I’m acquainted with a Ravenclaw who went over my last paper… you marked six of the twelve questions wrong when you shouldn’t have. We compared answers and either you forgot to mark her answers wrong by mistake, or you ‘accidentally’ marked them wrong for me.”
Leo had been sulking around the RoR for the past few days and acting more aloof toward the other Gryffindors then normal. The Twins and their friends were growing worried. Leo had refused to talk about it, merely mumbling something about being wrong and sweeping off to terrorize Neville and the Patil Twins. That was another concern they had. If Leo kept targeting Dumbledore’s spies in his frustration the old man was sure to catch on.
Pansy Parkinson, of the Ancient and NOBLE House of Parkinson, MY family is almost as old as your own. If you find yourself ever needing anything, I’m sure I’ll be MORE than capable.”
"Because you're dreaming Draco," Leo smirked.
Leo laughed long and hard, as if he hadn’t laughed a day in his life. His face colored a worrying red as he fought to breathe through his laughter. Finally after managing to calm down he looked up at the blonde, mirthful tears making his eyes glisten with carefree joy, he smothered a chuckle as he simply stared taking in the self conscious boy with a curious light in his eyes.
Leo left the statement at that letting the now frightened girl process his threat. He turned to leave gesturing for the other three to follow.
Pushing open the door Draco chuckled when he spotted Blaise and Adrian leaning against the wall attempting to look as though they hadn’t been ease dropping.
“Be careful the tunnels old, don’t trip over any roots. Watch your head as well.” Leo led him down the tunnel guiding him over an astonishingly large root (Draco would honestly call it a log really) and under thin hanging roots that reached for them emitting high pitched whines. Draco’s heart pounded wildly the whole way through the tunnel and nearly beat out of his chest while they were sneaking out of ‘Honey Dukes’. It was with a wild laugh that they made it out on the snow covered streets of Hogsmeade.
The other boy chuckled darkly, flicking the cigarette into the corner, “Of course. Everything comes at a price Malfoy, but you’re well aware of that.”
"Sirius?"
Leo groaned, when Draco didn’t respond, turning on his heel to leave.
“Maybe you should lie low for a few days. Carina’s going to murder you when she hears about this,” Theo mused, scratching his neck awkwardly.
"Oh it is, but it's 'Leo Harry-James Potter. Two middle names in honor of your paternal and maternal grandfathers." Remus explained sympathetically.
“You see, the Boss has been a bit… distracted lately. He’s always tense and high strung and he’s not focused on things he should be.” Lyra informed him, shrugging nonchalantly, drumming perfectly manicured nails on the table in front of her.
They both turned when an unamused grunt interrupted them Potter was scowling eyeing their interaction critically. Blaise rolled his eyes, “Draco I do believe lover boys getting the wrong impression. He seems under the delusion that we’re lovers.”
Draco frowned even more, feeling skeptical “I beg your pardon?”
Draco was stunned, he tilted his head studying Harry thoughtfully before leaning forward a lightly brushing his lips against Harry’s cheek. He pulled back smirking at Harry’s bright red face.
A short stumpy Dwarf pulled the sleigh to a halt before grunting as it climbed down the side and opened the door for the Three… now Seven Slytherin.
Professor Snape pocketed the vials, and swept away to continue his lecture, “As Mr. Prewett previously stated. This potion will be one of the most difficult you will ever make!”
“Unfortunately, we don’t get on well,” The blonde admitted cautiously, he still wasn’t sure if he trusted the Italian, but there wasn’t much he could do with any of the Information he had obtained, at least not without running the risk of being wrong. He had nothing solid on Draco, and if he could help it, he wouldn’t until it was determined whether the other boy was trustworthy or not.
Harry- Leo Harry-James Potter
Now Draco was dragging his shorter boyfriend down the street rushing along so they wouldn’t be ‘late’. Harry was sure to point out that if they did happen to be late it’d be his own fault. Draco slowed to a stop raising a brow at him. He turned, keeping his hand in a firm grip. Draco tugged the smaller teen closer, the space between them almost nonexistent, mercury boring into jade. Harry blushed suddenly feeling shy as Draco dipped his head breath caressing Harry’s lips. His breathing stuttered before Draco gently took his lips in a soft sweet kiss. Right there… in the middle of the road… for anyone and everyone to see. Harry’s heart fluttered at the path his thoughts were taking. Wrapping his free hand around the blonde and threading his fingers in the hair at the nap of his neck. The older teen hooked a finger in the belt loop of his younger boyfriend’s jeans pulling him closer as he deepened the kiss. Harry’s breath stuttered as Draco pulled away licking his lips.
“Professor McGonagall warily placed the hat on his head, as if sorting another student may cause more trouble. The Hat remained silent for much longer than Harry expected, or maybe he was just impatient, but if the uncertain look Professor McGonagall was giving him meant anything it probably was taking a while. Professor McGonagall turned to the Headmaster uncertainly just as the seam opened wide and-
Julian examined the chess board in front of him, "The day we go back to Hogwarts is here." He mused running a hand over his mouth thoughtfully.
“I believe you’ve said more than enough Mr Malfoy,” the man drawled coldly, never looking up from the papers he was grading.
“I want to ride you,” He panted, pleasure clouding his eyes, his lips red and glistening.
Harry gave a whiney groan in response trying his best to do as instructed, but he couldn’t help himself when he felt Draco’s thumb messaging the skin above his hole. He kicked at Draco’s shoulder forcing him away.
“Don’t argue with me Theo,” Leo warned, effectively ending the conversation when students began looking their way.
“Is this my room?” Draco asked nervously, looking around for his trunk.
Leo raised a brow mockingly, shoving his hands in his pockets, “Isn’t that my line?” he drawled carelessly.
Malfoy nodded politely before pulling his things back to him and opening his book back to the correct page.
Grey eyes glowered up into green sullenly, “I thought you said this was too dangerous?” the torn expression on Leo’s face only proved to irritate him more.
“No! You’re driving me absolutely mental!!” Leo accused, glaring at him and taking a step back.
The raven didn’t respond, merely panted his head resting on the blonds chest. Draco cracked a half smile, “That was… something” Draco panted breathlessly. He allowed himself to smile as the raven shook with his light laughter.
“Is this okay?” Draco asked, looking for Harry’s approval. He was still a little insecure about his abilities as a boyfriend and Harry was constantly reassuring him that ‘yes’ he was happy with him.
Harry- Leo Harry-James Potter
An annoyed grunt sounded from behind the Italian, “Are you really starting a pissing match with one of Potter’s Cousins Blaise?” Draco stepped around him into the room, curious eyes taking everything in.
“BOY! CUT THAT RACKET OUT!”
Professor McGonagall faltered, watching Mikhail stalk angrily over to the Gryffindor table, and drop stiffly into the space Hermione and Ginny offered between them. Ginny patted his back hesitantly, earning her a stiff but grateful smile from the boy.
Harry sighed, relaxing back into the older boys embrace, “I wish we could’ve been in the same house.”
Leo chuckled, “Not exactly… this is my room. I did say I needed a shower. Have a seat, I’ll be quick.”
“Pleasures mine,” Orion returned politely, smirk still in place. “Are we allowed to meet your boyfriends Draco?”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat before calling out Mikhail’s name expectantly. The Bulgarian smirked as he sauntered up to the stool confidently.
Leo and Julian recoiled, "NO!" but there was no escaping the devilish duo. (Sorry I had too. J)
Harry flushed in slight shame, “Oh… I’m sorry, we can still-”
“What about me?”
Draco blinked stupidly at the mirror for a second before placing it face down on the table for a moment. He pinched the bridge of his nose debating on what to do. On the one hand he could hang up and go about ignoring Potter and his ever growing crowd of lackeys (Bloody Bulstrode and Nott). On the other he could listen to Black (Who was this guy kidding? Draco knew who he was.) and possibly win over his crush. Let’s face it, Draco wasn’t over him, he had a thing for the whole bad boy attitude. Maybe he didn’t like being insulted, but Draco couldn’t deny being attracted to Leo’s domineering personality. As sad and twisted as it was, there we have it.
the woman for what she’d done, in all honesty she was happy, it was truly a blessing as it had shown her not only how horribly shallow not only the boys in her school were, but also the girls.
“Draco,” Knowing sable eyes bore into his Soul silently accusing him of trying to lie.
"Just give up Draco the bloke's obviously straighter then a wand mate." Blaise grunted in annoyance.
Five students filed into the compartment taking seats around them, Draco raised an amused brow as the all eyed him warily, so he’d have to start then.
Hermione bit her lip as she scanned the page of her Arithmancy book, why couldn’t she get this? Everything else she could get if she studied hard enough, but this… the answers seemed just out of her reach. Hermione threw the quill down fighting back tears. Leaning back in her chair she covered her face in despair. Why couldn’t she get this? Other people seemed to catch on just fine, so it should be simple right?
“GET OFF MY NIECE!”
Daphne relaxed looking anxious for a moment before returning to her food as they sat at the Gryffindor Table with the rest of the ‘group’. Julian, the twins, and Theo all nodded their greeting.
Draco blinked up at him, feeling very touched that the boy would want to share something so beautiful with him. He didn’t know what to say other than, “Thank you.”
Harry gasped in shock when an arm caught him around the waist and before he knew it Draco had practically mounted him from behind. Lips brushing sensually against his ear, “it’s alright another time then, let me help you this time.”
“Don’t be silly,” Draco waved him off with a scoff. Blaise and Adrian relaxed minutely appearing relieved, “Some days it will be Mikhail, he’ll insist you call him as such.”
Twin- Lyra Amalthea Black (Carina's sister)
“HA, hahahaha DRA-CO!” Harry cried scrambling to hold onto something.
So Sirius 'Adopted' her and we dragged her Home to Black Estate (His Uncle Alphard’s old home), where Sirius insisted we'd all be living. Dumbledore be damned. She thought we were insane at first and locked herself in her room. She knew about magic of course, she attended a magic school in Greece. Though she insisted her name was Callia Harris, and that we were mad. She spoke English well considering she'd lived here before her 'parents' moved to Greece shortly after they'd died in a car crash leaving her to bounce from home to home.
“trying to access,” Fred continued.
Glancing up, Harry grinned at the sight of his ever patient boyfriend, he was too good to him. He strode quickly over to the taller boy, and launched himself into the blonde’s arms, immediately placing an eager kiss on his lips. Yes, he’d wait to tell his Father, maybe he’d tell him after he graduated… when he can properly hide Draco… in America, or Australia…. Somewhere he can’t find them. That sounded lovely.
Harry Potter
Leo nodded, he needed advice, the kind of advice only a mature adult could give… maybe he'd write Remus instead.
“Hello Hermione, so what’s going on?”
Charles grinned, a pleased glint in his eye. The Game was on.
Draco sat thinking for a moment, what could it hurt?
“Harry I almost forgot!” Ginny cried digging through her bag. “You were late to breakfast so I grabbed your mail and fed Hedwig some bacon for you.”
“Julian, Hagrid is a victim too, back off,” Carina warned, sighing heavily.
Lyra nodded, “Davis is usually in the Library Saturdays and Sundays studying for classes I’ll start cataloging my observations first thing tomorrow.”
xXxXHPxDMXxXx
The two nodded grimly as they were given orders and told what to listen for. At the end of the day they went back to the dorms with Millicent and Theo feeling satisfied with their chosen path.
Leo smirked slowly, "I want you Draco and I've spent too long denying these feelings."
“Oi, Boss,” Julian whispered leaning forward, and poking the other boy with the tip of his quill.
Draco eyed him shrewdly, “You shouldn’t.”
How could he forget their wedding, Sirius had refused to come, on the grounds that he wasn’t a Black anymore, therefore he owed ‘Reggie’ nothing.
Lily looked at Sirius, “I’m going to be staying here at the Hospital Sirius, I’d appreciate it if you and Rem stay at the House with Harry.”
Lyra chuckled, “Just out of curiosity how much do you know? You said you saw we wore masks in front of the school, how much do you see?”
You finally meet Lyra! Not what you expected? I hope no one's offended by my description of Ginny, I don't hate her character. Unfortunately she's not going to be a very pleasant character in the beginning. I imagine as the only girl in a family of boys, she was spoiled but felt isolated when she was treated differently then them. (I have Five older brothers so I can confidently state that it happens. I was a bit of a brat until my friends gave me a healthy dose of 'grow the fuck up') I may have her redeem herself down the road if enough people ask me too. If not she's probably not going to be in the story too often.
Harry- Leo Harry-James Potter
“What’s the plan for Today?” Julian asked curiously.
"Leo hmm," Draco smirked, as he watched the boy slip into a compartment, "You've just met your future boyfriend."
Leo raised a brow, before pulling a piece of parchment, ink, and a quill from his bag, “Show me. I’m going to send this note to the twins to meet us here, you cast the Charm and we’ll see how well it works.”
Sirius and Remus froze, expression quickly becoming stony, especially after spotting Harry’s distraught teary eyed face peeking out at them from his Mother’s comforting embrace.
“Mates… Day off.” Leo reminded them with an amused smirk.
"Mister Potter, mind telling us where Mister Weasley is?"
“I thought I’d just said.” Draco sank a bit deeper into the tub trying not to get too excited about Leo’s proximity.
~Draco Malfoy~
“It’s funny, never believed I’d see Gryffindors with masks. You wear them well,” Blaise studied them carefully pausing on Carina, “Tell me honestly Cara… you wanted Draco and I to follow you.” It wasn’t a question.
Remus cleared his throat interrupting, Ron now Julian’s, train of thought "I found Lyra."
“There are other more legitimate reasons as well, but I’d rather talk about those later.” Harry pleaded, no need to get into his first few ‘adventures’ at school just yet.
So sorry it's so late and took so long to get it up Here's the Christmas Chapter!
“Move,” Harry breathed after a while.
xXxXxXx
Rapidly approaching footsteps startled the blonde from his thoughts, a familiar voice cursing in annoyance.
“You need to get dressed,” Draco informed him breathlessly, frowning regretfully.
"I'll do it." Millicent smirked, "I can't guarantee it'll happen right away but I'll try."
“Harry,” Draco growled clearly unimpressed.
Draco frowned as the younger Slytherins darted around the corner snickering wickedly as they glanced back at him. Rounding the corner Draco swore under his breath at the empty corridor. This was the fourth time now he’d been given the slip, they were taunting him, the bloody bastards. Just wait until he found the dorms, he’d make them regret ever even looking at him wrong.
Harry choked eyes widening in shock at the blunt statement, before quickly stripping out of his jeans and pants. He watched transfixed as Draco calmly undid his belt pulling it from its loops before just as calmly undoing his jeans. He finally grunted impatiently reaching out and yanking the jeans down.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~HP~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~DM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Blaise gave him a blank look, “We’d decided not to mention that again, hadn’t we?”
“I’m impressed,” Leo admitted, leaning back in his chair with a pleased smirk.
Leo groaned forehead connecting sharply with the floor.
Draco and the others started before hurrying in as Sirius turned to the Dwarf, the large doors slowly closing behind them, all on their own.
Fawkes trilled again a dark glare aimed at the man.
Leo smirked, sitting down in a black leather armchair he conjured wandlessly, “Excellent.”
Harry gasped, arching lightly against the blondes hard body. Draco snuck his hand under the slighter boy, grasping at his lower back, as his lips attacked the skin behind his ear.
“Don’t call me that,” Harry groaned as he ground into him again, “But yeaaaahs.”
“He’s stable for now, All we can do is wait until he wakes up.” Lily informed him sadly.
Draco frowned as he stepped into the Potter household. Muffled shouting could be heard just down the Hall, causing the boy to hesitate before fully entering the House. This was not what he’d been expecting to encounter when he’d come over to celebrate Harry’s Birthday today. He’d expected to arrive to laughter and smiles. The sight of his Boyfriends miserable tear-stained face and a furious one-sided arguement was not what he’d had in mind.
“Harry,” Draco growled, he was so close.
“Well said Draco,” Lily murmured approvingly, releasing one hand from Harry to stroke the back of his head in affectionate approval, never looking away from her family.
“Why,” Harry panted sounding mildly disappointed, yet completely satisfied all at once.
“He doesn’t agree with his parents views, he feels trapped at home, he just wants to be free!” Harry was desperate for his godfather to see that Draco wasn’t just another Malfoy.
Lyra and Carina nodded smiling lightly at him “We love you too Lee.”
“Ha,” Draco cried, as the dry digit forced it’s way passed the tight ring of muscle. The blonde squirmed at the dry friction against his slick walls, he huffed and whined as the digit dragged and plunged into him again and again, an embarrassing squelching noise causing his already flushed cheeks to burn with embarrassment.
“Draco are you okay?” Pansy asked suddenly, “You have a strange look on your face?”
Hermione- Carina Aurora Black (Harry's Cousin)
“I’ll find a way to survive,” Lily teased smiling lightly as Harry’s face lit up.
Lyra nodded, hiding a smile behind a spoonful of mashed potatoes "Hilarious,"
“Leo?” Draco panted softly, still out of breath from running.
Cho looked horrified, “Your parents are dykes?”
Leo was Furious. He was beyond furious, he was murderously angry. Drac- MALFOY, was mocking him. He’d listened when Leo had demanded he stay away from Carrington, instead he moved on to Blake, then Meade, then Conant! He just kept finding someone ELSE and it was making Leo crazy.
Harry frowned when Draco almost immediately pulled away, a strained expression on his face. He almost looked afraid.
~Harry~
“Nah, I think I’m just going to relax and enjoy the multitude of warm bodies that’ll warm my bed.” Draco mused sardonically. Raising a brow as the man’s face slowly turned purple with his rage. “Careful Uncle Sev, mind your blood pressure.”
The park was like a small island, though there were houses surrounding the small circle of land there were also plenty of trees making it the perfect, secluded hang out for teenagers later in the evening. Today it was empty. Spotting the blond rounding the corner Harry darted forward tackling him.
Harry panted heavily, watching the blonde through hooded eyes. Draco finished quickly grabbed a clean pair of boxers from his bag, slipping them on he brought Harry a pair from his top drawer.
Harry couldn't believe how easily she was talking about magic it was crazy. And the soft warm smile she wore changed her appearance drastically. He could actually see some of his Mum in her. Like her smile, his Aunt and his Mum had the same smile. He’d almost say his Aunt was pretty when she was like this.
“Waiting for me?”
Draco arched a brow at the phrase, chuckling coolly as the figure began melting back into the wall with a hiss of displeasure. “’Survival of the wisest’… what happens if you get it wrong?”
“How would you know!?” Draco sneered, feeling insulted that this man was mocking him. He didn’t need this man poking fun at his predicament.
“Sit,” Leo ordered firmly, pausing in his conversation to looking at her sternly.
“Tya ne si struva nepriyatnosti,” she shouted, though she looked as if she wanted to hit the girl as well.
Leo’s smirk bloomed into grin as he rounded the blonde gripping his hips tightly and almost effortlessly lifted the other teen to the tunnel entrance. Draco grunted face flushing when he felt the other boy grope his bottom as he attempted to haul himself into the secret passage. Tossing his leg over the side and straddling the statue Draco gazed down at the other boy haughtily, “You know Potter it’s usually polite to buy your date dinner first.”
Blaise sighed deeply, a mock look of disappointment on his face, “Unfortunately Draco disapproves of fun so he’s not dead. He’s been admitted to Saint Mungos without a name, they’ll figure it out when he wakes in a month or so, but he won’t be able to speak of our little… ‘talk’”
As it turned out James wasn’t going to be home tomorrow. Word came in from The Head Aura that things had gotten a bit out of hand and James had been hurt Protecting Lily. He’d been sent to Saint Mungos immediately.
Everyone turned to the dorm in union, Draco nearly dropping Harry as he surged to his feet, “Mikhail?”
Her Mother headed for the door without a glance, skillfully avoiding her daughters reaching hands, “Not now dear.”
“So what did you want?” Julian got straight to the point, he turned to the twins expectantly.
Carina blushed staring up at him with wide doe eyes, “You still can, I haven’t actually said it yet you know.”
“Eadric ‘The Slasher’ Slytherin, murdered those women in this room?” Draco paled, looking mildly ill as he looked around, as if he’d suddenly find the floors stained in blood.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I want to help.” She blurted out nervously and if they were honest a bit lamely. It was obvious the girl hadn’t really thought through how she was going to approach them.
“LEO HARRY-JAMES POTTER!!! ARE YOU SERIOUSLY SULKING BECAUSE YOU WERE WRONG?!?! YOU CHILDISH MPhf-” Theo smiled awkwardly at the staring students in the Gryffindor common room. Carina had stormed out of the library the second Draco had finished recapping the incident for them and had burst right into the common room screaming furiously at the top of her lungs.
Harry gathered his courage and pulled the photo out of his back pocket looking around the subway restaurant cautiously. He glanced at the photo, hesitated, and then slid it onto the table towards her. Hermione shot him a triumphant look and snatched up the photo looking at it curiously. The smug look slowly melted away as shock took over.
Padfoot chuckled, “Maybe not, but I know you still like Leo. And I’m the only one who knows the Potter’s stubborn streak and Leo’s reactions well enough to help you pull his head out of his ass.”
Once the last student left the room the blonde stood swinging his messenger’s bag onto his shoulder and making his way to the front. “Professor, can I have a word?”
The two sat stiffly at the table staring at their hands, Harry glanced up to see a dark look on his Godfather’s face. The man was working up a rage, and Harry needed to stop it now.
“What ARE you doing outside the Slytherin commons Prewett?” He asked as if the answer didn’t matter.
Malfoy nodded as he stirred in the doxy eggs and adjusted the temperature.
Blaise and Draco turned back to the raven impressed. Neither had ever heard of a student getting away with that, they’d thought there were spells to prevent it, and the punishment if you were to be caught was severe.
“Upstairs.”
“Best news I’ve heard all day! Take your Mother with you!” Jonathan retorted scathingly, Isabel looked affronted as her eldest Daughter ushered her out with her family. He slammed the Door behind them leaning on it heavily. “I’m so sorry Lilybug.”
Harry turned and hugged her, as she burst into happy tears again. The woman stood looking at her in concern.
Bill offered her a pained smile, “Me too love,” He glanced back into the kitchen as the sharp sound of porcelain smacking against porcelain echoed after them, “Me too.”
Draco studied his angry friend one last time before, nodding at Orion and moving resolutely to the stool.
Paul shrugged grinning like a cat that got the cream, “Well at least we know he’s not taking a tumble with some random bloke in the park.”
Carina wore pink pajama short shorts and a white cami, while Lyra wore red plaid pajama pants and a black sports bra.
Lucius returned to his paper silently dismissing his presence. Narcissa sighed appearing put upon, “Go read a book or something, your bags are packed correct? Just meet Tinsel in the Parlor when it’s time to leave she’ll drop you off at the Station. You want to leave early so no one sees her dropping you off. We wouldn’t want anyone to think poorly of the family would we?”
“Oh really,” Draco asked slightly breathless. The sinister undertone in Leo’s simple statement sending pleasant chills up his spine. “It’d be about time you did.”
Leo crowded Draco back against a work bench bracing his hands on either side of the shorter boy, “Did you miss me?” The casual question was followed by feather lightly kisses trailing down his neck.
Draco fought a smile as he looked over his shoulder, “Will you now, hm, maybe I’ll suggest it. Though I’ll leave you out he might not let me otherwise.”
Be well Dear Brother, maybe someday I'll tell you why I stayed. Just know I'd never betray you Sirius. Stay strong, stay good, and stand firm. Remember me, for I don't think we'll meet again for a long long time.
Draco and Harry sat in silence watching a random comedy show, Draco glanced at Harry every once in a while feeling anxious.
“Now it’s both our faults.”
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
"Like reinventing ourselves, New name, new attitude… I like it." Julian grinned.
Tracy deflated looking dejected before hesitating and standing quickly, she turned and moved quickly away from her group at the table, who were what Leo and his friends had labeled ‘Death Eaters to be’. All their observations pointed to their unwavering loyalty to Voldemort. She stood awkwardly behind them at the table fully aware that she had all eyes, including the glare of her previous group, on her.
Orion smiled beautifully pulling off the hat and handing it back to her new head of house. Walking calmly to the seat beside him a light laughter escaping her lips as he all but pulled her onto the bench.
Draco smirked, eyeing Harry up and down, “well I haven’t.”
"Wait like the Harry Potter?" Lyra’s brain shut down trying to process that one, “Are you having me on?”
"You've been harassing me about this for weeks," Potter chuckled, looking amused as he shrugged off his brown leather jacket (Authentic leather, Draco noted in approval).
“We’re on vacation Malfoy,” Julian drawled idly flipping through a dirty magazine that had Carina and Tracy wrinkling their noses in disgust, Daphne and Lyra pointedly ignoring him, and Pansy eyeing him warily as if not quite sure what to make of him. Theo shifted uncomfortably in his seat beside the boy, shooting his girlfriend desperate looks as if desperate for her to realize he wasn’t looking at the scantily clad images. “Just relax mate… maybe loosen up a bit, none of us would blame you if you and Leo went off to relieve a bit of… tension.”
The Blonde squirmed for a moment before the penetrating stare became too much and he gave in, “We kissed.” He admitted quickly, hoping against hope that Blaise would let it go.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*~~~~~~~~~~~~~*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Leo’s forest green eyes looked darker than he remembered, piercing into him as he chuckled.
The first girl’s jaw dropped in disbelief, she poked an accusing finger in her shameless friends’ chest “You third rate skank! You have a boyfriend!” as if Julian hadn’t already known that.
Draco shot him a bland look rubbing his cold hands together. “It’s December Potter, and snowing, maybe you could have warned me about our little date, before dragging me out into the snow?”
Harry floundered and choked, "But that makes you."
Leo groaned, silently damning the shockingly naïve blonde. Leo may have refused to believe he wanted the blonde, but at least he didn’t torture the other boy like this. Leo grunted as the blonde obliviously bounced and squirmed in Leo’s lap, trying to maneuver himself into a more comfortable position in the regrettably narrow corridor. Leo could lean all the way back against the wall behind him and still have his chest pressed flush against Draco’s. He honestly couldn’t actually feel his leg right now with the uncomfortable position they were in.
Tracy nodded quickly fighting the urge to hug the boy, she responded breathless with relief, “Completely, you won’t regret it, I promise.”
“On purpose,” Harry huffed flushing in embarrassment, “You’re obviously seducing me without meaning too.”
Harry glanced at his clock, “Tonight,” Harry agreed.
Julian leaned back in his chair cracking his knuckles lazily, “Actually, it started after Leo woke in the Hospital wing the end of first year-”
let GO?”
Harry trembled lightly memories of last night drifting lazily through his mind, “Upstairs.” He decided.
“Alright… What is it?” Harry pressed tilting his head slightly, and tugging lightly on the taller boy’s shirt.
Draco smirked, “Looks like we both have some learning to do.”
“Have they been asking you where I was going this summer again?”
Theo shook his head scooting closer, “Leo please, listen to me, the guys dangerous.”
“Yeah, but he’s more like an older brother,” Draco sighed, pulling Harry closer, “My best friend’s are Mikhail Koshkov and Orion Black.”
Sirius grinned sitting down at the desk to write a letter to the youngest Malfoy.
“Call him dad?” Draco sighed walking over to sit on a corner of Harry’s bed, Harry hurried to follow, “Well he’s not really a dad, well he doesn’t act like it anyway. I use to do everything I could to be like him or make him proud. Finally one of my classmates at Drumstrang pulled me aside and asked me what I was doing. I told him to mind his own business like the little bastard I was pretending to be, and he told me to grow the fuck up and really LOOK at who I was trying to become. I had no idea what he meant. But I watched my parents more closely after that, I was twelve so of course I thought they were the best parents in the world, but after about a year I began realizing that I was more of an accessory then an actual person in their eyes. Status is the only thing they care about. My Parents would sacrifice anything for the sake of status. Me, our relationship, each other, Nothing is sacred to those two. If they ever found out I was bisexual they’d disown me faster than you could say Quidditch. They wouldn’t care who I wound up with, bird or bloke, they would rather die than have my sort of ‘filth’ taint their precious ‘status’. So he’s Lucius, and my Mothers Narcissa. They know I no longer respect them. They already warned me not to stand against them in the public eye. If I had somewhere to go I’d tell them.”
Draco frowned, not seeming to understand.
bad day. Letters had been pouring in demanding answers about the safety of their children. Not to mention, Smith’s disappearance nearly ruined his plans for the Malfoy brat. If he couldn’t get rid of the brat, he’d never get Potter back on his side, and he’d never separate him from Black’s blasted Nieces, they were terrible influences on the weapon. Just look at all they’d done recently. He needed to separate the group. Malfoy was the key for that.
But the real question eating at Draco, was is the Golden Boy really all that Golden?
"Little bit," Harry smirked, amused by his strange Godfather’s antics.
“Not yet Draco,” Leo informed him solemnly, “It’s too dangerous for me to have you now. And we’ve much to discuss before then.”
“You all seem to forget that I’M in charge here,” Leo looked at each of them sharply, “We’re going to focus on our goal from now on. No more of this pointless crap about Malfoy!”
“You know, they aren’t really as bad as you think Uncle Severus. Blaise seems to believe their putting on masks. Hiding who they truly are…” Draco trailed off keeping his eyes on Pansy’s hand as he bandaged it. He didn’t want to see the judgment in his godfather’s eyes. He really liked Leo, even if he was a bit mad, Draco couldn’t control who he liked.
Draco frowned, hoping he wasn’t talking about what had just happened. He didn’t need Harry and the others hearing about this, much less Orion and Mikhail. “What are you talking about?” he silent cursed at the slight rasp to his speech.
“What did you just say?” Draco asked coldly. Let know one say he’d inherited nothing from Lucius Malfoy, when he was Angry… you could
Draco tilted his head thoughtfully, “How…” he frowned not able to think of anything he did while they were swimming that could be considered seducing.
Draco debated for a moment, “How are you planning on helping exactly?”
Julian merely stared at her, silent and assessing as his head tilted minutely. Pansy had her hand pressed firmly to her mouth, her face doing its best to impersonate a tomato, she couldn’t believe she’d shouted at him in his home. Her mother would be furious if she ever found out! Julian was the Ideal Suitor her mother had in mind for her ‘precious’ Delilah, and if she one day came to him and discovered Pansy’s thoughtless reaction she’d never hear the end of it. Julian was handsome, he would be both rich
"What's up mate, you’re being unusually quiet." Leo asked, concerned for his friend.
Harry groaned still panting heavily. Draco didn’t give him to long before he pounced again this time his tongue teasing a ‘new’ part of his body. “H-hey! Didn’t lick there! Draco that’s Gross.” He squealed, when he felt the tip press against the tight untouched ring of muscles.
MDS MDS MDS
“Harry?”
Leo paused and tensed up ready for whatever silly pick up attempt Malfoy was going to try.
“Seamus! Dean! Didn’t know you’d be here.” Harry grinned hopping of his bike to hug his two friends. Dean rolled his eyes.
"Hilarious" Lyra repeated, choking on a giggle.
"How," He gasped in despair as the boy backed off.
Blaise’s brows shot to his hairline at that one and he burst out laughing at the sullen look on her twins face, the muttered complaint of ‘we’re twins’ all but drown out.
Carina hummed feigning disinterest, “I accused him of cowardice… I was wrong.” Her eyes flicked to his, giving a small hint as to what the misunderstanding was about.
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
"I see that," Leo glanced down to make his point.
Molly bristled, "I raised you."
The three paused turning to look at the blonde in surprise.
Blaise tilted his head thoughtfully, “So you lost faith in the Headmaster?”
"Right, sorry," Pansy blushed, obviously embarrassed at her behavior.
"How DARE you, I took you in RAISED you as my own, I am your MOTHER!" Molly shrieked. Face skipping red and burning an ugly maroon color, in her fury.
Julian glanced up from his book, azure eyes boring into the twins the younger boy closed his book with a snap. “Fred,” he murmured casually, an almost mocking smile curling a corner of his mouth.
Ron- Julian Michael Prewett (Fabian Prewett's Only son)
Leo and the others observed her calmly with blank expressions.
Harry nodded slowly, he wasn’t going to deny it, the boy had amazing eyes, he doubted he’d ever see eyes more entrancing then Draco Malfoy’s.
“I told you, the git offended me personally, it had nothing to do with Malfoy,” Leo snarled, to be honest Leo couldn’t answer as to why he felt offended by Archibald but he did. And he didn’t feel like forgiving the boy yet. Besides Malfoy was still visiting him so he wasn’t really suffering enough for Leo’s tastes. Maybe when the blond stopped visiting, he’d CONSIDER letting the boy heal.
He knew nothing was happening, he trusted his boyfriend, but he didn’t like not being able to talk to Draco about it.
“Why?” Harry asked looking horrified at the thought of waking up that early in the summer.
“What!?”
“Lord Potter,” Millicent smirked glancing back at a smirking Theo, “I believe we have ourselves a solid alliance.”
Petunia and Vernon looked indignant holding the massive boy protectively between them, “Don’t expect a visit for the Winter Holiday!” Petunia warned shrilly.
Adrian and Blaise seemed to catch on to his silent question, or they were just really good at Legilimency (Unlikely considering his perfection of Occulmency). “Crabbe and Goyle use to follow Parkinson around, doing everything she ordered them to. Now that you’re here seems they’re gunning to be your ‘muscle’ if you will.”
"Nope," Leo smirked, pushing his grumpy mood to the back of his mind, this was supposed to be good news.
Leo leaned back turning his head slightly to the right, “Yea?”
“Thank you,” Draco grunted, rubbing Harry’s back comfortingly.
Chuckie smirked at the growing blush on Harry’s face, “Wouldn’t shut up about you actually. Seamus and I were debating coming over and forcefully introducing him to you. But we figured that might be too strange.”
“I’ll destroy those weak little Brats one at a time,” Dumbledore snarled before sweeping behind his desk “And all the Potter/Evans magic will be mine as it should be!” He snarled viciously, pulling out parchment and a quill to fine tune his perfect plan.
“Bugger off Vernon!" He shouted back trying not to sound shaken. He licked his lips nervously and crouched slowly to pick up the Album with a shaking hand. He opened it, and starred in shock at the girl in the middle, who looked startlingly like someone he knew. Only with long straight dark blonde hair and a darker complexion, but it was familiar all the same.
“You blew up Carrington’s glass! Why?” Malfoy demanded childishly, the barest hint of a pout on his lips.
Harry snickered. His Mother had decided that as a Marauder, Sirius had an unfair advantage in the prank war, and began giving Draco suggestions. One such suggestion was putting Nair in Sirius’ shampoo. In true Good Boyfriend form, Draco hadn’t ratted her out, unfortunately that meant Sirius was gunning for him. Poor Draco hadn’t even known what Nair was, the poor sod.
“No he won’t,” Julian smirked lazily, he’d never realized how simple it might be to manipulate the grim man. He watched the Professor sweep out of sight down the Hall. He wondered how the man would react to finding out he didn’t actually have Detention… or did he?... Whatever, either way he wouldn’t be there.
Draco panicked glancing at the ice warily, he was not in the mood to fall on his ass in front of his Attractive, Sweet, and Utterly Amazing Boyfriend. He’d much rather be doing something that he could impress the boy with, like maybe… er. Draco honestly couldn’t think of a thing he was good at that the boy would be impressed with. He was good in school, most social gathering that involved impressing his Fathers Business partners with said good grades. He was decent at flying…. But Potter was better, at Flying at least, and he’d been charming enough to convince Pansy, Blaise, and Draco himself to join him for the winter holidays.
Theo through a warning glare at Julian as if expecting the same from him.
Thank you all for your overwhelming support, I feel very blessed and I hope I do you all proud.
Leo handed over two of the tiny wings.
The girl nodded nervously, twitching under his piercing stare.
Tilting his head at a smirking Blaise indicating he should move first, the blonde surveyed the common room closely. Taking in the gray leather couches with black and green velvet throw pillows, and the marble walls and floors. The room was cold and clinical aside from a few items obviously brought by the Slytherins themselves. Like the Wizard made Pool table, ‘inspired by Muggles not that he’d say anything’.
“Mhmm, probably related to your godfather, Orion and Mikhail are the two people my Parents want to get me away from the most. They hate how much trouble we cause together.” Draco chuckled, thinking back on all the mischief they caused.
“We’ll discuss it at a more convenient time in the future I’d like to hear from everyone though my decision will be my own.” Leo drawled lazily, as if anything else would be more interesting. “Anything else?”
"Think that's funny do you," Leo glared looking entirely unimpressed.
Theo glanced down at her, fighting an affectionate smile, “Yes love?”
Daphne hesitated before pulling out her wand, “I just mastered the Cave Inimicum charm, but my Caterwauling Charm is still stronger would you like me to show you one of them?”
"Your request is quite interesting, though I have to wonder, … what's in it for us?"
“Sphinx fur blankets,” Blaise murmured impressed as he pet the blanket draped over him, Theo, and Millicent. Watching it purr and tuck around them snuggly as the sleigh rocked before beginning to move. Draco watched in awe as they traveled through what he was convinced was a magical winter wonderland.
Draco smiled as he entered his compartment on the train, joining Pansy and Blaise. They would both be joining him at Potter’s this Christmas. Prewett had extended an Invite to Pansy from Leo formally during lunch a few days after their date. Leo was really going all out to gain his favor. Blaise had apparently informed the other boy that Pansy usually spent Christmases at the Malfoy household, so in a show of good will had invited the brunette to make Draco feel more comfortable.
“Aren’t you worried your parents will find out?” Harry asked anxiously, giddy excitement bubbling in his stomach, as Draco led him by the hand down the street. His other hand shoved into the worn brown canvas coat Sirius had lent him. Sirius had actually lent him the entire outfit, to decrease the chances of someone possibly recognizing him.
Leo’s eyes finally left the Italian, lighting on the smaller blonde instead. He straightened almost imperceptibly, but the Italian’s sharp eyes caught the move filing it away for later observation.
Leo quickly measured them out and handed them over. Malfoy nodded his thanks as he slowly stirred them in, before adjusting the temperature. The potion slowly bubbled into a blue color causing Malfoy to nod firmly.
“It’s little Purebred Pricks like you that really get under my skin though, Arrogant, Cocky, poisoning good students like Ms Granger. What I wouldn’t give to just hit you right now.”
Leo’s brow pinched in thought, “I wanted to show you that I was wrong… that I acknowledge that you were right. You… do things to me. Things I don’t really understand yet. I didn’t want to understand at first, I wanted it to stop, you drove me mad. Julian, Carina, Lyra, I drove them crazy trying to fight it…. Then I kissed you, and everything I thought I knew, thought I understood about myself. Just changed, suddenly every thought and decision I made, was in some way linked to you. I woke up in the morning wondering if you were already up or if you were just waking up as well. I chose to take the long way to Defense hoping I’d see you along the way. I went to bed at night wondering if you were still up. You were in every thought. So I brought you here, to show you that I was wrong. I’m not the same person I was in the last few years, and neither are you. So I want this field in this moment to represent our new beginning, a blank slate. I want you with me, I feel like I’ve been walking my path alone for too long. Will you walk with me Draco?”
Hermione apparently couldn’t hold her tongue any longer. “You prejudice little-”
Draco choked face reddening embarrassingly. It was natural to worry about curfew, not to mention Professor Snape was bloody well brutal in his punishments. He may not scold them publically but in the privacy of the dormitory he really tore you up.
Breakfast the next morning was a quiet affair.
"It’s so stupid, like a bloody Soap Opera, I'm not even a Weasley. None of us are who we always believed we were? It’s so stupid! My name's not even Ron for Merlin's sake, I mean come on really? How lame can you get? Merlin, my names Julian Prewett, MOLLY’S older brother is my Father." Ron's laugh was slightly manic, as he spat out the Weasley Matriarch’s name, he slammed his hands flat on the table looking down at it. "Bloody hell.”
Blaise and Draco traded guarded looks, before Draco shook his head, “We don’t have any House Elves. The Malfoy’s, I mean my parents specifically, employee Human Butlers and Maids. House Elves creep Mum out. Something about a House Elf named Kreature being obsessive.”
Draco slowed when they made it to the Great Hall walking calmly into the Great Hall and straight toward the Gryffindor table where Orion and Mikhail were sitting with Harry and his friends.
A slow smirk spread across his face, as he looked her straight in the eye, and winked at her. Pansy sat up straight looking startled before facing forward a bright blush on her cheeks.
Despite expecting it, despite knowing it was necessary.
Draco sighed, “Right, well. I’ll see you in the morning Harry.” Draco caught his chin placing a soft kiss on his forehead before brushing a quick kiss to his lips, after that he was hurrying back into the school to see if he could follow any lingering Slytherins to the Dormitory.
Julian nodded, “I’m sure you’ll need more than a moment. Just do me a favor and don’t tell anyone you know, least of all a Weasley.” It still felt weird referring to his former family by their surname. He doubted he’d ever grow use to it.
“Ride me Harry,” Draco urged, squeezing his hips lightly.
“Lord Malfoy,” Carina greeted politely before taking her seat, “Lord Zabini.”
Harry bit his lip nervously glancing at his Godfathers, Sirius jerked his head as if to say, get on with it. Harry sighed, “Mum, this is my boyfriend… Draco Malfoy.”
Carina chuckled struggling playfully in his firm grasp, “You have to let me say it back,” she complained with a laugh.
“So come to Hogwarts,” Harry smirked wincing as he sat up, reaching over he nipped lightly at Draco’s shoulder, “I’ll make sure you behave.”
Harry chuckled miserably, “You sound so sure.”
“Good,” Harry chuckled before curling into Draco’s side, resting his head on the blond’s chest. “Good night Draco.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco chuckled, “So why were you watching me?”
“Good man,” Sirius cheered, turning his attention back to the teens. He opened his mouth to speak only for a loud squealing to erupt from behind him. Carina darted past him, seemingly appearing from nowhere, and threw herself into Theo’s arms. Theo yelped as he stumbled back, holding her tightly in an effort not to fall.
The Day before Harry’s Birthday, Draco took Harry on their first date.
Remus turned to look at him, "Sirius we forgot, all those years of living in the same school hanging out and getting to know her and we forgot." Remus pressed, trying to get him to understand, and trying not to laugh at his old friend’s present situation.
“We’re almost there, let’s hurry.”
Blaise waved them forward, insisting they should start moving or they’d miss lunch, but the uneasy glance he shot over his shoulder told of his desire to get them far away from the man as quickly as possible.
Julian smirked looking unsurprised, “It is. Julian Michael Prewett, pleasure to meet you.”
“I’ll go grab the ingredients if you don’t mind setting up the cauldron,” Malfoy offered after Snape finished his speech.
tall, as the top of his head just barely skimmed Draco’s chin, but the man made up for it in width. Draco could understand how Harry could see the man as intimidating though as the man
Twin- Lyra Amalthea Black (Carina's sister)
Leo dragged him quickly down the corridors, Draco had no idea where, and the horrible feeling in his gut was only increasing. Where on Earth was this bloke taking him? He really wanted to enjoy his first date with Leo, he’d worked really had to get Potter to like him, but he wasn’t going to accept anything less than incredible. He may fancy the pants off the silly Gryffindor, but he was still a Malfoy.
Isabel looked horrified, “How dare-”
Draco frowned eyes trailing ‘Leo Potter’s’ every move. He hadn’t expected this when he’d boarded the train this morning. It will definitely prove for an interesting year, and called a lot into question. Did he really want to pursue Leo now that he knew he was Potter? Yes, he had an amazing Ass. But was he willing to do it publicly? The Golden Gryffindor would obviously want everyone to know. Because who wouldn’t want to brag about Draco?...
“Oh my,” Lily smiled softly, grinning at the sullen Black, “You have been an Ass Sirius.” She laughed at the disgruntled pout the man gave her before reversing the hex, “Now who wants to help with Dinner. Will you be staying Dear?”
Harry blinked in shock at the awkward admission, and was Draco blushing again? Harry decided not to mention it this time. He wound his arms around Draco’s neck loosely and smiled slightly, “I can do that.”
HOLY SHIT!
Malfoy nodded slowly his eyes never leaving Leo’s, “Alright, that sounds fair. I haven’t been pulling my weight on that end and for that I apologize. I promise that when the time comes tomorrow no matter what Professor Snape decides, I let him know that I’ll be testing the potion tomorrow.”
“Wait, like real?” Theo yelped in shock. Carina flushed in embarrassment, and hugged herself defensively, why did her family hate her? She was a good sister right? A good friend and cousin to Leo?
Draco trailed his fingers up Harry’s shirt exploring his toned stomach as he began rocking faster. He quickly pulled Harry’s shirt of when Harry grabbed onto his shoulders and start making little nosies with each movement.
“Tougher and more stubborn than an Ox,” Draco smirked, repeating Amelia’s complaint of two days earlier. Charles barked out a laugh as Amelia smiled, Lily and Harry smiling bemusedly, not quite part of the conversation but not isolated from it as the Dursley’s and Evan’s were.
“Wait,” Pansy blurted out in shock, staring at the strange boy in wild disbelief, “Are you saying you fancy me Prewitt?”
Draco frowned not quite sure whether to be offended by the admission or not. “Share everything with me Draco, I want to be there for every smile and every laugh.”
The raven haired boys head whipped up and before he knew it his arms were wrapping around the boy and he was staggering back with the force the he’d been hit with. Choked cries muffled against his chest could barely be heard.
The Dwarf steered the Reindeer through open arch the old brass gate raised for their arrival. Draco craned his neck to watch as the gate lowered behind them the loud clicking of a chain and pulley mechanic echoing of the stone walls. Whipping around again as the sleigh slowly came to a stop before large solid wood doors, Draco ignored Daphne and Pansy’s grumbling in favor of staring at the doors separating him from Leo Potter. A nervous twisting forming in his gut, he was finally here. Draco would get to see Leo in mere moments.
“Blaise the M.L.E could link it back to you! Anyone who saw what was going on could link you to me and if they noticed Smith and I’s interaction they could try and pin this on you!” Draco rambled franticly.
“They’ll give them to us at breakfast,” Blaise grumbled before looking as if he were about start in on him.
Carina smirked, “We’d like to help you Malfoy.”
“It’s midnight,” Harry chuckled breathlessly, “We’ve been at this for eight and a half hours.”
Ron shrugged, absently turning his attention back to his breakfast. Draco’s gaze pierced into the boy and Harry felt him tense minutely beside him, “Alright there Ron?” he asked calmly swiping another piece of fruit from Harry’s plate.
Leo raised a glossy black brow two strange black strings hanging from his ears.
Bill thought for a long moment, his mind going over every red flag he’d ever unintentionally ignored, with a heavy weight of determination, Bill turned to nod grimly locking eyes with the cautious twins, “Yes, but not to Molly and Arthur. Fred, George, do you think you could get a message to Julian?” The twins hesitated before nodding warily.
“Prat,” Draco chuckled pulling him into a hug, “I have good news.”
“Drumstrang is a Pureblood paradise, no Mudblood’s allowed. Why… did Mummy and Daddy transfer you here?” He drawled a calculating glimmer in his eye. This moment, his answer, could very well determine whether his stay at Hogwarts was comfortable, or a Hell on Earth. Draco frowned, his mind running a mile a minute, before he fully turned to look at the teen.
Draco laughed lightly tugging Harry closer by his belt loops, “I’m going to Hogwarts.”
“Sit down and shut up!” ‘Professor’ Snape ordered sharply, as he swept into the room. “Now I HATE repeating myself so listen closely.”
Draco fell asleep the moment he settled in his compartment, dozing lightly against the window. So it was safe to say the heart attack he nearly had when someone landed in his lap and placed a rough kiss on his lips, was completely justified.
“I did say I would,” Draco frowned, disgruntled by the other boys lack of enthusiasm.
Harry nodded, “Being in a relationship is all about spending time together, sex is only a part of it, the physical part. Granted it usually comes after we’ve known each other for a while but every relationship is different.”
Draco glanced at him startled, “Excuse me?”
The four had barely sat down when someone unexpected descended.
The man was for too passive aggressive. Holding grudges over the smallest slight or perceived offense. Draco had once, at five years old, given his Godfather a child’s Guide to fun Contemporary Potions for his birthday. He had thought it may be a fun way for them to bond or for Severus to teach him the basics. It had been an olive branch of sorts, an invitation for the man to grow closer to him. The blonde now carried a small barely noticeable scar, along the hairline of his temple, where the Man had smacked him violently with the book. He’d shouted at the, at the time, small defenseless child for over an hour. Severus had snarled at Draco to never insult the fine art that was potions, with such a wasteful and offensive subject again, and ordered him to his room when he had insulted the man further with his tears.
“What did Uncle Sirius do now?” Carina asked looking exasperated, one hand on her hip with her other arm still wrapped around Nott’s neck.
“Then let’s continue.”
Harry had laughed the first time Draco had pulled a prank on Sirius. Sirius had made a passing comment accusing the teen of being a pretty boy. The blonde had seemed to let it slide with nothing more than a raised brow. The next morning Sirius had woken up with wide glittering Blue eyes, full pink lips, and a long mane of blonde hair. Draco had smirked and asked him who the ‘real’ pretty boy was. Sirius had thus declared war, beginning a seemingly never ending prank war.

Even Harry looked startled by the revelation, while Mikhail merely chuckled, a wicked gleam in his eye. “Naturally, I’m surprised Draco didn’t mention his Godson’s Father was the Famed Viktor Krum.”
Draco sat in his compartment bored to tears. He was wondering where in all the blessed world Potter and his stupid lackeys could be. He'd gone to harass the goody-two-shoes savior only to find their usual compartment occupied by the Weaselette and her stupid friends gossiping loud about something or other.
"Thought so, now Lyra needs to be sorted she should be on your list."
“Leo have you seen- Bloody Hell!”
“So are you and Malfoy a secret couple Boss?” Tracy asked curiously as she dealt out the cards for another game of Bullshit. She’d developed a fondness for the muggle card game and enjoyed the challenge of playing against Julian, Theo, Carina, and Daphne.
to! I’ll not have it. And I’ll not have you ambushing Lily and Harry like this again. You only thought you could get away with this because James isn’t here.”
“Blaise,” Draco near begged, eyebrows knitted in anxiety, he didn’t want to talk about this.
Lyra sighed tightening her bun, a fact Julian didn’t miss, before starring into the fire. “We still don’t know what’s wrong with Leo, I’m thinking of asking Draco.”
“Right,” Harry mumbled, looking amused at his boyfriend’s giddy behavior at getting one over on his parents. Draco had been more then interested when Sirius had offered him the clothes. Going through everything and feeling every article commenting on the different fabrics. Harry had to threaten the boy to get him to pick a damned outfit so they could go. Sirius had to promise him full access to his clothes for their dates to finally get him out of the house. Though Harry couldn’t exactly complain, Draco looked sexy as hell in Muggle clothes, especially his ass.
Harry smiled , obviously getting the message.
“You’re getting better,” Draco smirked running his fingers through the younger boy’s hair.
“Dammit!” Leo hissed glaring after the blonde, he’d just put his foot in his mouth again and pissed off the temperamental boy.
Harry smacks his chest looking affronted, “I don’t talk about him that much. But they’re my friends they’re bound to come up eventually. If anyone has a right to be jealous it’s me! You talk about Orin and Mikhail about as much as I talk about my friends!”
Draco exchanged a bewildered shrug with the others before turning his attention to the castle they were slowly approaching. Draco was in awe, he wasn’t even inside yet, and he was already impressed. Leo’s home was beautiful, amazing even. The only Castles Draco had even seen or known to exist had a distinct gothic style to them. The Castle before him seemed to be done in a light grey stone, with Cross shaped windows in the towers. It was smaller than Hogwarts but, in Draco’s opinion, far more grand and beautiful.
Smith smirked slapping aside his hand/wand and forcing him against the wall, “I don’t think you have any room to make ideal threats here.
"Right let's look for Lyra."
Julian sighed, "Well this year will be interesting, I guess I can try harder in class. If only to piss off the teachers and Molly, maybe I’ll get a laugh or two out of it."
The group finished their breakfast in a slightly more comfortable silence, ignorant of the sharp eyes watching and cataloging every gesture and action.
‘Noah’ held his chest with a mock wounded expression, “Chuck he hurts me, right here.” He gestured to the wrong side of his chest, obviously trying to indicate his heart.
Harry moaned pitifully crying out when Draco shoved his tongue roughly back into his deeper than before. He pulled his tongue out spreading the twitching bud with both thumbs, he frowned thoughtfully pressing one in causing Harry to jerk under him and moan weakly. “Do you have any lube?”
friends?”
Draco sighed in relief, “I just turned sixteen last week, June 5th.” Draco informed him returning to his neck.
“Yes,” Fred murmured after a nodded from his brother.
“On the first day yes,” Adrian gritted out, before quickly adding, “Look Malfoy we need-”
The next few days followed a similar pattern.
Blaise smirked leaning forward to kiss her hand, a sly smirk on his lips, “Bella* I’ve misjudged you, you’re a lethal woman. I’ll speak with your boss.”
Leo lost it, grabbing the couch pillow he was leaning on and hurling it at the girl angrily.
“I’m NOT mad,” Malfoy insisted sounding exasperated, “And I ALREADY forgave you Leo.”
Leo glanced at Millie pointedly, no one noticed the quick drop of her eyes, “Millie join us, we’ll take pity on the poor girl, I’ve nothing of importance at the moment and this may be good for a laugh or two later.”
“When we were swimming today,” Harry deadpanned. Glaring at the older boy, as an embarrassed, blush spread across his cheeks.
Leo sipped his tea casually, never taking his eyes from the two, “We have a new problem.”

They went through classes Tracy becoming increasingly distressed at the lack of contact with her friend, though she didn’t outwardly show it. Theo and Millicent kept him updated on their observations over the course of the week.
Blaise arched a brow, “Potter?” he questioned mildly, and if Draco had been anyone else the casually asked question may have caught him. Fortunately for him, only in these moments, he was a Malfoy. And Malfoy’s were always on their guard around their own and those like.
Harry smirked, “Good, because if I’m right I really think I’m gonna like it rough.”
“Carina, Lyra, Julian, this is Tracy, we’ll be keeping an eye on her,” Leo drawled, as if merely introducing the girl was a chore. The others nodded murmuring their greeting, before returning to their previous actions. Julian flirting shamelessly with a sixth year girl causing her friends to giggle girlishly, Lyra turned to engage Millicent and Leo in conversation, while Theo and Carina made eyes at each other.
“NO of course not, you’re just confusing me is all.” Harry defended himself hotly crossing his arms and looking away sulkily.
"But, so my names not Harry?" 'Harry' asked looking helplessly lost, this was all too much. First he discovers a long lost Aunt, now he’s not even Harry Potter?
"If you must but be clear on one thing, I'm in charge if anyone takes Dumbledore down, I'll be first in line." Leo stated grimly, as he led them toward their ‘base of operations’ as Lyra called it. She’d been watching too many muggle movies.
“Dammit Rin,” he shook his head disparagingly, an exasperated smile on his face, “I wanted to say it first.”
Tracy and Daphne had been surprisingly helpful in weeding those few out, and had been the ones to scathingly inform the trouble makers that they weren’t running a social club.
“Really Leo? Why have the stereo on if you’re going to listen to your Walkman?” Lyra chided, looking exasperated.
The young man raised a smooth dark brow at him.
It was sort of a relief when he felt Leo’s hips press flush against his bum, there was so much of him, and he didn’t think he could have taken anymore of him. The first slow drag of retreat had the knot in his gut clenching in pleasure. Winding his arms around Leo’s neck tighter, he did the only thing he could as the strength and speed of Leo’s thrusts increased until he was pounding into him leaving Draco breathless with pleasure.
Draco sighed and glanced at Blaise who’d just sat down beside him. He had known Blaise since they were children a more calculated yet warm person he’d never met. He just hoped Blaise never found out about Smith or the poor boy may end up dead. You see, the rumors about Blaise’s family and his Mother were more than just, they were the truth. Blaise was being trained to take over the ‘Family Business’.
The blonde snorted softly, “I’d had the same question in mind really.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry relaxed minutely, looking bashfully at his shoes, “I know, I just really don’t like the idea of him being pawed at by people like Parkinson, she’s the devil incarnate I swear.” Hermione and Ginny grimaced at each other in agreement.
most ruthless and lethal Mob Families in all of Western and Eastern Europe.” Theo warned subtly, voice lowered to attempt to keep their conversation somewhat private, without drawing the attention a privacy charm would bring.
Harry buried his face in his comforter, attempting to hide his jealously, he was being silly.
“I’m impressed,” Harry smirked breathlessly after being dropped onto his bed.
Draco froze turning to look at the Woman attached to his arm.
Blaise rolled his eyes at the brunette’s enthusiasm, “If he didn’t you would’ve just exposed yourself Pucey.”
The man kicked his chair back with a bang, as he reached across the desk for Draco’s throat, only to cry out in pain as the blonde caught his wrist twisting it painfully. As he swung his feet down and slowly stood to tower over the hunched man.
Leo dropped his fry in shock, while Ron seemed startled, but nodded knowingly.
The Italian stared him down, cool blue eyes seemingly piercing his very soul. Before an amused smirk curled the corner of his mouth, “You hate your parents.”
Amelia and Charles exchanged mildly amused looks, “Yes, seems a bit shy though, he hasn’t said much. Though I assume he’s your boyfriend.”
Standing up and feeling insulted that Potter was ignoring their yearly tradition, Draco stalked out of the compartment, and right into someone's broad chest. He looked up only to see find he’d walked into the hottest guy, with the sexiest dark green eyes he'd ever seen. The boy smirked and lifted his strong jaw slightly in a defiant manner, "Malfoy, I presume?"
Draco caught his shoulder driving into the boy as hard as he could, chest heaving with the wonderful mix of pleasure and need.
“Salutem sapientissimus,” Blaise spoke clearly, obviously expecting the blonde to remember for himself from now on.
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
“You’re in a castle you know,” Draco glanced over his shoulder coolly at the bland statement. A tall Italian young man stood hidden in a shadowy alcove.
It wasn’t actually a question, more of a threat actually. “Yes Mother.” Draco finished his breakfast and excused himself from the table to ‘read a book’. He actually went back to his room to sleep, hey it was only seven fifteen he had almost two hours before he had to leave. He’d arrive at the train at eight forty five. So he set his wand for eight thirty, and climbed back into bed careless of the wrinkles it’d cause in his clothing. Black slacks and a gray cashmere sweater, he wondered what Harry would be wearing today before drifting off to sleep.
