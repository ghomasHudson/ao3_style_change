Draco tried moving towards Harry but felt himself frozen to the spot; fear starting to take hold as the world came into focus. Beside Harry stood a monstrous creature, and Draco swore it smiled at him.
Draco nodded, taking a deep breath as he closed his eyes, focusing on that deep feeling, that need he'd always had. He felt the air stir around him and when he opened his eyes he could see the blackness was mingling with Draco's own aura. The purple circling in on them, almost fighting with the darkness around them. Draco could feel Jariss above him as he spoke, "I know what my duty is," they said in unison. LeFay stepped forward and let his hand caress the side of Draco's cheek.
Harry LeFay and Draco Malfoy continue were they left off in their discussion, and into the bed room.
"Easy. You're perfectly save here Potter. Now answer the question," Snape said sternly. Harry relaxed tentatively. his eye glancing between his potions master and the door frequently as he sat back. Something Severus didn't miss.
“You could try shifting!” Severus suggested, only to have Bill looked over at him like he was insane.
"But do you accept it, this is what I am Draco. Can you accept it, can you accept me?" LeFay asked, his eyes glazing over Draco's face.
LeFay nodded, “We are having a tough time. I feel it’s mostly on my end but, Tatsuya he, well,” LeFay grimaced.
LeFay snorted. “I have to say, the Wizengamot is, or rather was, full of idiots. If they knew the truth well,” he smiled, “I basically run it now.”
“Cadmael, I need you to trust me,” Harry said softly as he lifted the bowl to Cadmael’s lips. There was a small grimace but then a smile formed across Cadmael’s face.
“Narcissa, we’ll give you two a few days. Hopefully he will come to terms with it, but we need to do it soon. There is only a week before their school year begins,” Sirius stated. Narcissa nodded before bowing slightly and turned to leave. Remus turned back to Sirius to try and push the subject, only to be interrupted by a sudden commotion in the hallway.
Harry however was completely stunned. All that time… Harry sucked in a deep breath as he felt tears start to form at the corners of his eyes. Remus put an arm over Harry’s shoulders to try and comfort him.
Harry nodded, “I feel I still have a bit to learn but, I’m not afraid anymore. I can embrace this, and I know now that if I ever really turned into something as twisted as Voldemort or Albus, I wouldn’t command the power over the others here that I have now. If the others followed me it would be by choice, not just fear, and that if they ever felt I couldn’t offer what they needed they would leave or correct me, just like I would for them. Submitting to power isn’t something forced upon another, it's something willingly given to those they trust.”
Cadmael laughed, “That's pretty rich coming from you, you just dropped him as soon as you started getting feelings for him. You let some worthless wizard’s spell take your mind from you and completely forgot about him. Went off gallivanting and causing havoc elsewhere because you lost your mind to your primal half! LeFay told me everything, you even tried to kill him multiple times! Refused your feelings for him because you let measly wizards control your every move. You disgust me!” Cadmael shouted back into the dust cloud, using his free arm to hold some of the wound closed along his side.
Draco rolled his shoulders, trying to relax. Telling himself this man wouldn't have been here if Harry, LeFay, didn't think he was worthy. At least that's what he told himself.
Draco trotted in through the painting after Harry spoke the password, his head held high. He was rather liking his life so far, though he did feel slightly guilty about how his friends looked after getting the news of his death, especially Pansy. Still, it was only slight guilt and it was fun growling and snapping at anyone that passed them in the halls. The look on their faces as they ran off or even just flattened themselves against the walls was priceless. Harry on the other hand was not amused.
“He did?” Bill and Severus said at the same time. Harry nodded, putting his hands in his pockets and rummaging through them for a moment before stopping when he hit the collar. He'd apparently forgotten about it's existence in all of the action from the day before. “If he did then his reaction could have been his magic and body trying to fight all the foreign magic in his system,” Bill thought out loud.
Harry’s eye widened, welling up with more tears as he squeezed Cadmael’s hand tighter, anger rushing over him after registering what Cadmael had said. “Shh, rest. I’ll have them treat you after, but you’ll have to tell us everything you know once you’re stable enough to talk. I’ll handle Draco,” he said quietly as he dusted off the side of Cadmael’s face. There was a soft nodd from Cadmael as he licked his lips and let his eyes close. The medics witches lifted him onto the gurney carefully as LeFay stood, dusting himself off.
LeFay nodded and then yawned, “Yes, he wished for you not to get involved as well, but I suppose its to late now," he glanced at Draco who seemed surprised, "I need to get started on the rest of my plans for the night. You are welcome to browse around the castle, but don’t try to leave just yet. You’ll find the wards won’t let you through this time around. After dinner, I’ll get everything in order so you may move freely.”
“Oh don’t play dumb, Malfoy. Why else would you show up here in the middle of nowhere, wearing a Glamour and hanging out in a Muggle bar of all places. Have you suddenly gone native?”
“Lunch?” Draco asked, confused. It had only been early morning when he had come up here, how could he have lost track of time like that.
Draco is back in the dark and dank tunnel. He is standing in front of rusty wrought iron door. The lock is the only thing that looks like it hasn’t aged a day since it was forged. Draco tries to open it in vain, whatever he does, it won’t budge. He looks around himself and in front of him he sees a shallow puddle. At the bottom he can make out a heavy iron ring and a set of keys.
“Hey,” Draco grabbed his hand and pressed a gentle kiss against Harry’s knuckles. “You’re thinking too much.”
“You’re enjoying this far too much. I’m starting to think all there is to you is an overdose of snark and attitude.”
Harry pressed his cold cheek into Draco’s, letting himself be held and drawing strength from his proximity. It was at moments like this, when Harry so clearly needed him that Draco wondered what he’d done in the years before they’d become lovers. Who had given him support when he’d needed it? Had he always just pretended to be strong, because he had to be? Was it Draco who allowed Harry to show weakness for the first time?
His legs had carried him away from wizarding London out into the streets of Muggle London. He was walking past a row of houses, some of their windows covered by drapes to keep out the sun, others thrown wide open to let in fresh air. A gust of wind made him shiver as he walked. Despite the sun and cloud-dotted blue sky, the first signs of autumn were fast approaching. The cold breeze made leaves dance around his feet as he heard an unfamiliar song from one of the open windows. A woman was singing, her voice sounding eerie and so sad it made his own heart ache for what he’d lost and yet couldn’t let go.
He returned into the main room, with two coffee mugs, handing one to Malfoy and then taking a seat beside him.
“I’m sorry, I can’t do this anymore. It’s over.” Harry’s voice was calmer than it should have been under the circumstances.
Draco was just about to turn away from the window and hide further in the back of the bookshop he’d sought refuge in, when Harry appeared. The mob turned as one man and now it was Harry’s turn to be questioned, hassled and pushed.
“That’s none of your business, Malfoy. Now get back to work, I’ll be checking up on your progress again in an hour.”
Harry looked up and was too shocked for words for a moment when he realised who the speaker was. He had never before found himself on the other side of the man’s smile, only ever his sneer and snide remarks.
“Dunno, maybe a glass or two?” Potter seemed to seriously consider Draco’s question, counting on his fingers, when he came to five he returned his hand to Draco’s thigh and nodded. “Yes, two, no more.”
“What a low shot Harry!” Draco said huffing with indignation. Then suddenly smirking added, “True Slytherins call it being cunning by the way! Has a much nicer ring to it, don’t you think?” With that he bucked his hips suddenly, dislodging his startled boyfriend in the process.
Bill sent him home where all Harry could do was stew on the injustice of it all. Hadn’t he done enough? Somehow nothing he did ever seemed to be enough. If his life had been a proper fairytale like so many people suggested, killing the evil wizard should have been enough. The world afterwards should have turned into a kind of paradise, full of pleasant people and for him, the hero of the story there should have been a significant other to live with happily ever after.
Unable to hold back any longer, Draco turned around and reached for Harry. Their lips met again, almost brutally this time, biting, snarling and lapping at each other, both needy and desperate. Draco squeezed Harry’s behind so hard it must have hurt but Harry’s only response was to kiss him harder and continue massaging his bits through his clothes.
Draco perused the map Harry had unrolled in his lap. The structure on the page was circular and seemed to wind and twist upwards, like the inside of a conch. It looked a bit like the rune that Draco had manipulated the previous day, when he had revealed the staircase.
There was a hand on his shoulder and despite his reservations and worries, Draco allowed himself to be turned around. Harry’s hand on him, even through several layers of clothing felt like a brand of ownership and for once he couldn’t bring himself to mind. It was the last time after all.
“Fuck!” Harry shouted and hit his fist on the table so hard it hurt. The pain filled him with grim sense of satisfaction. If only there was another way, if he could somehow convince Malfoy of the need to be careful. Perhaps if Harry spent more time with him…
“Mr. Potter, remember that nothing can hurt you here. They are only memories. You are completely safe.”
Draco stops moving and Harry’s fingers encounter the damaged skin in the centre of his cheek. It is warm and sticky, nothing like what Harry remembers from their youth. Harry is afraid of hurting Draco, but it seems like Harry’s touch is actually soothing the ache somehow.
“Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!” Draco added for good measure, running his hand through his hair in a gesture of exhaustion. “Fucking Harry Potter!”  He went on, seeing how it was all his fault.
“I also heard that you might not be opposed to spending Christmas Eve with a certain available frightfully attractive bachelor, if he was asking.”
It took the team almost two weeks to find the tunnels leading up from the ruined village directly into the lighthouse. It was then that Draco understood what must have happened. When everyone else had gone to bed, he snuck out and went back to the city. But this time, he took the entrance from the lighthouse. It took him two more days and he was close to giving up, when he found them.
Ginny had cleaned all of his clothes, but she’d also washed his dressing gown, which had still smelled of Draco, even almost a month after he’d last worn it. Harry had hidden it at the bottom of his wardrobe under a stasis charm and sometimes, when he couldn’t bear it any longer and he was sure that Ginny wasn’t at home, he would take it out, press the soft fabric to his face inhale deeply and let the memories come. In those moments he could pretend that Draco had been with him of his own free will.
He didn’t know how much time had passed when he finally made his way to the nearest apparition point, his mind filled with a hazy fog. They’d barely spoken while Draco had tried to calm his nerves through the consumption of copious amounts of tea, magically refilling his cup more than once. The only sound in the room besides Draco’s occasionally ragged breathing was the noise Potter was making as he rummaged around, jotted down calculations on his note-pad and finally cleaned away his equipment. Later on Draco had made an appointment to get fitted for his scold’s bridle, also known as spectacles, in a week’s time.
Draco stared at his tired looking reflection in the mirror.  Today was the last day of his community service at the ministry and the last day of his forced stay with Harry. The Malfoy accounts had been unfrozen and the anti-apparition spell had been lifted. Even his wand had been returned to him after Harry had yet again spoken for him and praised the level of reintegration and rehabilitation he’d achieved.
Harry had been intrigued despite himself and listened in more closely. When the wizard who had complained conjured an image of a lighthouse by a windswept cliff, to show to his co-worker, Harry had been enchanted. One of the reasons he found it so difficult to take his vacation days was because the first few times he had gone on vacation he had ended up constantly surrounded by his
They woke up much later, still in the same slightly awkward position, yet neither of them willing to move away. They only moved apart far enough to be able to look at each other, leaving their legs entwined. It took a long time before either of them spoke.
fights then. Resigned to his fate he tried to calm her down, knowing full well that it was no use. They assumed their respective roles far too easily these days.
“Holly?” he called and the house elf materialised beside him immediately. “Show Potter to the door please.”
For now he decided to just keep going as if nothing had changed. He would pay more attention to what Draco said and did and try to do a bit of reconnaissance on the side and if that helped Draco to stay safe, that was just an added bonus.
Like water sliding down a windowpane the glamour fell away. Leaving one very unhappy looking Draco Malfoy standing shivering in the middle of the street in a tiny village in the middle of nowhere.
“I’m sure you know about doctor patient confidentiality, but that’s not why I’m not giving them to you. I know you only mean well, but I know you and I’m deciding not to reveal my clients to you, because I believe that to be in their best interest. However I can ask some of them if they are willing to talk to you on their own accord.”
The darkness lifts the minute Draco steps onto the square. Although it is crowded, Draco can only hear the shuffle of feet and the sound of cloth moving against cloth. There are no voices although everyone seems to be talking constantly.
It wasn’t long before Draco’s desire to work things out with Harry overcame his fear and he stopped his pacing. The rusty gate to the small front garden, if one could call it that, felt cold and diseased under his hand as he pushed it open. Flakes of rust stuck to his skin, he brushed them off negligently, walked up the three broken steps and reached for the door, touching the wood, but hesitating to knock. It was as if the whole house was decaying under his touch. A dark sense of dread and foreboding overwhelmed him and he shrank back from the door. He heard a noise and when he looked up, he saw a raven fly overhead, swooping down low and coming to rest on the stony Black family crest that was still above the door.
He can hear a dark chuckle that sounds all too familiar but slightly off and slowly turns around. His eyes fall on Harry, bathed in white light and dressed in a pale robe like some kind of messiah.
Draco was trying to find the diary. If his mother had taken it, because she was after all the most likely candidate to have gone through his things since the rest of the house didn’t look as if it had been searched, she must have hidden it somewhere. His assumption was based upon the fact that the every time the Aurors had searched his home, it had taken him forever to find all of his things again, most of the time, small valuable items tended to stay missing unless they had been charmed in a way that would make sure that if removed from the Manor they returned to their vault in Gringotts. Coming to think of it, maybe that was one of the reasons the Aurors returned so often, because they tried to figure out where in Circe’s name their loot had gone.
“Just up front, I will not discuss you and your dealings with Draco any longer. You won’t listen to me anyway and while I don’t think you are good for each other, he told me he would take care of it himself. Now, I’m assuming you found some correlation between accidents and the involvement of Slytherins or former Death Eaters and their affiliations, is that correct?”
“So, what you’re saying is that you decided it wouldn’t hurt to open your Christmas present delivered by owl and wrapped in WWW paper today at work, while you were catching up on paperwork.”
“I hope you’ll feel better soon. I only came by to see where Sophia had got to, I got worried when she didn’t come home.”
“I was just topping off my mug for the fif—eh, second time, when he burst into my office.” Potter thought for a moment. “I tried to ask him what he wanted, but he simply kept coming closer, which was a bit weird, considering we don’t even shake hands usually.”
Thusly admonished by his mother in front of the last person he wanted to see right now Draco slumped down in his seat. Holly appeared at his elbow and began piling eggs and toast onto his plate before pouring him a cup of coffee. Draco sneered as he took up his fork, ignoring everyone at the table and stabbing his eggs viciously as if it was their fault.
He tried to find a clear patch of floor somewhere that wasn’t covered in debris or glass and took the book, the box, the painting and the lantern with him. Draco didn’t trust the desk or the desk chair for that matter. He sat down cross-legged, placing both the lantern and the painting on top of the box. He untied the string and set the quill down on top of the painting, before opening the soft cover. The writing was exquisite, sure steady strokes filled page after page.
Her behaviour towards him had grown increasingly cold over the years and who was he to blame her? She’d said that there was something seriously wrong with him and that they should get therapy to work things out, but he had refused. Not because he thought he didn’t need it, but because deep down he’d known that what had broken between them couldn’t be fixed through talking or anything else.
“I love you Harry.” He’d never heard his own voice filled with such tenderness, and the delight that suddenly lit up Harry’s features as he heard those words chased away any anxiety he might have felt at taking such a risk. He was pulled tightly against Harry’s chest once more. A series of frantic kisses were scattered all over his face and lips until Harry pulled back far enough to look into Draco’s eyes once more.
Draco carefully Levitates Potter into the house. It’s too early for his parents to come downstairs and for once he is glad about them sleeping in on Christmas morning. He doesn’t know how he would explain floating an almost frozen to death Potter through their entrance hall to his parents. Being charged for kidnapping and killing the saviour will definitely not help in rebuilding their reputation.
Draco nodded, feeling warmth creep up his cheeks as he remembered the high-pitched scream he had let out, when he had discovered just how much of his hair had disappeared.
“I am here now Harry, I won’t leave again, I promise.” Draco bent down and gently kissed his boyfriend. “Open your eyes Harry, I am still here and I am not going anywhere.”
He tried to get his frantically beating heart under control by taking a couple of deep breaths and folding his hands reminiscent in that of a prayer, he knew his knuckles were turning white with the pressure he was applying, but he didn’t dare look to check whether Mrs. Malfoy had noticed his terror. Harry almost missed what Mrs. Malfoy said next.
Draco is still steadily moving backwards on hands and arse along the rim of the pond, trying desperately to get more distance between himself and that thing.
The sky looked like it was about to rain and a cold wind swept the last of the fallen leaves through the deserted park. The lone figure of a man dressed in black and looking forlorn was illuminated by the yellow light of a single street lamp nearby. To the casual observer it appeared as if the figure had withdrawn so far into whatever it was that kept his mind occupied that he didn’t even notice the cold or the approaching night.
“’s alright.” He mumbled. Making an effort to speak more clearly, he added “don’t want him to leave.”
“Harry, what’s wrong? I really need to speak with you. Please let me in.” Draco knew he sounded dangerously like he was begging, but he couldn’t really make himself care.
“It’s alright; it’s not your fault, besides I could do with some fresh air after being trapped in a stuffy hospital room for weeks.” Draco said, quickly stealing a kiss from Harry before climbing onto the broom behind him.
“Oh, for fuck’s…” Potter shook his head disbelievingly and mumbled something that sounded a lot like ‘what a fucking idiot’ before taking Draco’s palms into his left hand casting a healing charm on them with his right. He sounded exasperated as he went on.
When Albus arrives he is full of joy and laughter and so is Margy who keeps poking her head into the conversation, talking about how awesome the dungeons and the new underwater windows are and that she can probably see Merpeople from her bed. Harry smiles and cheers them on, while still worried about what is going to happen.
She didn’t even want to see him, had just sent him away, he’d felt lost and helpless and for the first time he could remember in years, the two parts of him acted in unison, wanting and needing the same thing.
Draco pulled out of him slowly almost all the way, before pushing back in, their skin making a slapping sound when Draco was sheathed all the way once more. Draco picked up the pace, if only slightly and Harry met each and every one of his thrusts, still not quite enjoying himself, but not wanting to stop either way.
The She-Weasel sighed resignedly and rushed off to stand with the others by a shop window on the other side of the street to keep dry, but not before shooting another murderous glare in Draco’s direction.
“You said they told you there was nothing more they could do. Draco, they lied, they didn’t cancel the curse! They just left it to fester and that’s why the skin has not been healing and why using magic has been painful. Every time you use it, it strengthens the curse’s hold on you.”
To make things right between Draco and himself there are other issues he has to sort out first. It’s the only thing that matters and that he needs to protect at all costs. While he had been bitter and thought Draco had stopped loving him that obviously had never happened, much like how Harry had never truly got over Draco. If there is ever supposed to be a chance for them being ok again, Harry needs to find out what happened to Draco and all the others and he needs to put a stop to it.
For a moment Draco couldn’t believe what he was hearing. That fucking cunt! She knew about them, she had to. She’d done this on purpose to fuck with his mind. The all-consuming hatred that boiled up inside of him at the thought of her putting Harry to bed and then going on to fake intimacy with him for the benefit of an audience, was not something that was easy to hide. He tried to calm himself and carefully set the mug down, before he squeezed it any harder, making it burst. Draco tried to focus on what was important – the fact that Harry hadn’t slept with that bint, the fact that the first thing he’d done, after seeing her out of the door had been to crawl into bed with Draco, the fact that… wait, how had he even ended up in his own bed?
Back in his tiny office, Draco couldn’t stop running his fingers over his kiss swollen lips. For the first time in months, he was completely and utterly happy. He belonged to Harry and Harry belonged to him.
It is barely a whisper coming from somewhere undefinable but growing steadily in volume. It is answered by a voice sweet as honey and Draco can’t help but find he agrees with it.
“Well, Potter, congratulations on saving the world, on vanquishing the darkest wizard of all time. Thanks for trying to save me, even though I didn’t deserve it.  Here’s to you, may you be happy with the life you chose and may you be able to forgive me for not letting you save me this time.”
The skin on the back of his neck prickles, like he is being watched. Draco turns around slowly. A dark shape slowly drifts along the avenue towards him. The bright light around him flickers for a second and it is as if a shadow passes across the clouds. If Draco hadn’t still been looking at the strange tree people he would have missed it. For that short moment when the shadow touches them, they change. Their faces become those of people suffering in agony, their mouths wide open. The beautiful sound of leaves moving on a breeze turns into an eerie mindless wail, while their graceful dance turns into that of creatures writhing in pain. Something tells him that this is real, not the pleasantness he has seen before.
His steps are feather light, as he makes his way into the centre. The force that called him here is still not releasing him, calling him forward. The middle of the room is taken up by a giant basin, in the middle of it is a small marble island. Distances seem strange and different, while the windows on all sides seem to be within easy reach of a few steps, the fountain adorning the marble island in the middle of the artificial pond is so far away that Draco suspects he would drown if he tried to swim there.
He hadn’t touched Draco again after the incident in the locker room, for fear of any kind of physical contact being misunderstood. Harry was the last person who would take advantage of someone under his care.
The light fades away and just as before when the growing darkness touches the creatures around him they begin to change. The fish becomes a shark and the blackbird a vulture, their demeanour even more menacing than before. The sound of hoofs on the pale stone of the square is loud in the sudden quiet and Draco doesn’t have to turn around to know that his enemy is back. The black horse snorts and cold shivers run down Draco’s bare arms and back as the temperature keeps dropping.
that you have to talk about him all the time?” She said his name like it was an insult. “I thought this evening was supposed to be just about the two of us.”
In the beginning it had been obvious to him that Draco was trying to repay his kindness, and he’d tried to be strong, tried to be a friend to the man who wasn’t allowed contact with anyone from his past. Uprooted and alone, of course Draco had turned to the first person who’d shown him any kindness at all.
These days he had it tightly under control. As much as he had wanted to hurt Robards for what he had planned to do to Draco, Harry was tired of fighting. Nothing he had done seemed to amount to anything, but one more grave containing a body, unloved and unmourned.
The tea was just the right temperature when Harry took his first sip and let himself sink into the cushions of the armchair, somehow far more comfortable than they had been the night before. He would have to deal with Malfoy tomorrow. Harry didn’t even know where he lived, until he did, he would be unable to keep an eye on him. Looking at the fireplace, Harry wished for the first time that he had listened to Hermione and had had it connected to the Floo-Network. He needed to talk to her about this. He was sure she might have an idea of what was going on. But how to go about it?
She removed her wand and was now pointing it towards a floating scroll and quill, ready to record whatever he said next. He was reminded of Rita Skeeter for a moment and hesitated. But then he shook off his worries and straightened up.
“I’m sorry,” he mumbled again, getting up from the chair and shaking his therapist’s hand. “I hope she feels better soon. Will you be free tomorrow afternoon?”
“Seriously though, Potter, while this coffee is making me partially reconsider my opinion of you I’d still like to know why I have a crick in my neck from sleeping naked on the floor in your home.”
“I’ll be right over. I’m almost done.” Draco carefully spread some more dirt across the roots of the freshly planted lavender and gently firmed it down with slow even movements of his hands. When he was finished, he got up, carefully brushed the earth from his fingers, patted the dust of his trousers and went looking for Harry.
“Silencing Charm!” he managed to gasp while he was being devoured by Harry’s hungry kisses. Harry’s shoved both of his hands into Draco’s trousers massaging him through the thin fabric of his pants. He could feel himself firming up rapidly under Harry’s determined hands; apparently his body needed less time to overcome his surprise than Draco did.
“Do you regret it?” Draco’s voice sounded small and vulnerable, nothing like what the Draco Harry had got to know had sounded like. He drew Draco closer by the wrist he was still holding onto and enfolded him in a hug.
“Be that as it may, you already implied that you can’t protect the people who press charges from what is already happening to them. A kind of viral public violence towards what people consider the losing side of the second wizarding war, with nobody there to interfere. What makes you think them pressing charges will make a difference?”
Potter looked up at him then, expectantly. Draco went on. “I’m not even talking about the time You Know Who was there, I’m talking about that thing my father does, where he gets to be home for Christmas and then locks himself away in his study or his library, knowing that we’re waiting for him to join us. I can see my mother fidget and worry and sitting at attention just staring at the door. Sometimes I feel like I don’t exist, like I don’t matter…” Draco stopped talking then. Somehow his supposedly sarcastic and cheerful story had become too personal.
As much as Harry had thought he would enjoy seeing a flustered and distressed Malfoy, he really didn’t. Malfoy seemed almost vulnerable, his arms protectively crossed against his chest and hugging his sides. His eyes were darting around the room as if he expected something horrible to jump out of the shadows any minute. It really wasn’t funny at all.
Harry sensed that tonight something was different, Draco didn’t gaze at the flowerbed in front of him like he had for the last few months, he seemed to be holding something in his hands that completely captivated his attention. Worry knotting his insides, Harry stepped closer trying to get a look at what could possibly grab Draco’s attention like that. It was a small nondescript glass phial Draco kept rotating in his hands. The sight was mesmerising.
After reading the first two paragraphs of the report in front of him for the fifth consecutive time without any of it managing to even remotely penetrate Harry gave up. Exasperated, he dropped the report onto his desk and closed the file. Maybe he would be able to concentrate better if he stretched his legs for a bit. Mind finally made up, Harry dropped a note on Ron’s desk and left.
Draco was at his wits’ end. The only way he could confront Harry about what had occurred was if he went to London. He already knew he couldn’t do it - couldn’t bear the resentment and hatred that had intensified what felt like a thousand fold. Not only was he a convicted Death Eater, but he’d also dared to lay his filthy hands on the precious saviour. Not that the public actually knew anything specific, but they had chosen to make up their own facts and punish Draco for them. He was sure that if the Manor hadn’t been so well protected by its wards and a few spells the ministry didn’t need to know about, he would have needed to take up permanent residence at St Mungo’s by now.
Harry thought desperately as he found his eyes drawn toward the perfectly shaped buttocks clad in tailored trouser again, like they had been so many times before. He still remembered what they felt like under his hands, remembered the scent of Draco’s skin and hair and how it felt having that lovely warm body pressed against his. For the life of him he couldn’t remember why at the time he’d thought that this wasn’t what he’d wanted.
And wasn’t that just the most hilarious thing. Of course Draco didn’t trust Harry, how could he after what he had overheard?
Draco flicked his wand, unlocking the floo and asking her to come inside. A flash of green flames later Pansy stepped out of the floo, looking impeccable as always, apart from the twin stains on her trousers where she’d been kneeling in front of her fireplace. The exchange of air kisses over and done with, Draco closed the floo once more.
Malfoy started shivering. His face slowly turned and he looked straight into Harry’s eyes, there was no recognition. Harry didn’t know whether Malfoy was a sleepwalker or what was going on. All he knew was that he had to get Malfoy away from the cliffs. As if his thoughts had conjured a reaction, Malfoy took a step forward and it was only thanks to Harry’s reflexes that he didn’t fall to his death.
“No it’s not alright. I shouldn’t have… Merlin, Malfoy you don’t even fancy me… I didn’t care, I would’ve…”
Draco reached for him then. Harry could feel Draco’s hands gently tracing his arms, and chest. They were still lying on their sides, their position slightly awkward but neither seemed willing to move if it involved breaking their kiss.
“I don’t need your pity,” Draco spat, wanting to lash out despite the fact that only a moment ago he had tried to comfort Potter. Potter was obviously attempting to speak but Draco waved his hand as if to show that the thing he said was nothing of importance. “I’m sorry, it’s alright. Just don’t.”
Draco’s slender hands reached for Harry’s shaking ones and gently took them. He pressed his palm against Harry’s and spread their fingers so their hands rested against each other like a perfect mirror image to make it easier for them to compare. Where Harry’s fingers were thick and strong, Draco’s were long and slender. Despite Harry’s alcohol-induced impression his hands weren’t huge at all; Draco’s fingers were in fact longer than his.
Like a child that decides closing its eyes will make it invisible to the monsters in the shadows, Draco presses his eyes shut, forcing himself to calm down. The intruder is still approaching, but Draco isn’t moving, isn’t even shaking anymore, as he gets his breathing under control. The man is standing close enough in front of Draco for him to be able to smell him. Neither of them moves and the spell is only broken, when the arm of the sofa Draco is sitting on groans under his tight grip.
“Here drink this,” Draco said after vanishing the sick, pressing a glass of water in Harry’s shaking hands and helping him to take a few sips, before setting it down on the table. He conjured a warm wet cloth and carefully cleaned Harry up. He pulled him close again, rocking him gently back and forth.
Raindrops pelted against the glass, the noise building the perfect backdrop for Draco’s mood. He sat on his bed, his face buried in his hands. The day felt off and wrong somehow, the kind of day where the sun rose behind such a thick cover of clouds that it constantly looked as if night was just about to fall. The kind of day one would prefer to spend inside, under the covers wrapped around someone warm and watching the rain slide down the windows, while waiting out the storm.
When they are done with Draco’s torso, arms, neck and face they take a break. While the curse slowly creeps back up Draco’s torso, it doesn’t do it fast enough to be a real danger. Harry runs his hands along Draco’s arms, neck and chest and at the end cups his face. Where their skin touches the inflamed skin becomes light pink scar tissue that looks like it had healed over years ago. It remains like that, even when Harry gets up and takes his hands away.
What had happened had been so horrible that the only solution had been to blame Draco for everything. If he hadn’t been up to something, if he hadn’t lied, if he hadn’t kept secrets, Harry wouldn’t have been forced to do what he did. Deep down Harry knew and still knows that was a lie.
Harry hadn’t meant to fall asleep. He awoke when Draco placed a kiss on the crown of his head. In this moment he could pretend that Draco wanted him, that he wasn’t just indulging him. That he had kissed him, because he wanted to and not because he felt obliged to.
Night was just falling outside and even though it grew ever darker inside, Draco didn’t switch on the lights. Somehow the lengthening shadows managed to soften the harsh reality of their break-up, or so he thought until he noticed that not a single item was out of place. The flat was too clean. Whenever Harry was upset, he started cleaning things and sorting things. Draco suspected it was some kind of coping mechanism. You could always tell Harry’s state of mind from the state of the flat –socks strewn about, dirty dishes in the sink and magazines covering the dining table meant he was happy without a care in the world. The neater things became the more upset he was about something.
Harry, with that predatory prowl that he had so admired and that had never failed to make Draco want him, approached the bed slowly, a gentle dreamy expression on his face that stood in complete contrast to what he’d already done to Draco. He broke into a smile as he took out his wand. Draco still hoped that he would heal his wounds and let him go, but another sharp pain on his chest, just above his heart told him otherwise.
“We don’t have to talk about this now, if you don’t want to. Do you want to look at the other maps?”
“You too and send my regards to your wife and daughter!” The sound of men slapping each other on the back could be heard from the corridor, before footsteps approached and Potter appeared in the door frame.
The night out is fun. When Harry sees his chance, he mentions to a slightly tipsy Percy that he needs to have access to some patient files and health statistics for a case he’s working on. Percy generously invites him to come to his office the next day, before Oliver pulls him away.
Harry stared at the page and the neat writing emotionlessly proclaiming Lucius’ Malfoy’s faith. Despite everything the man had done, that kind of ruling still seemed harsh to Harry. He began to wonder how it affected Draco and his mother. As much as he himself despised Lucius Malfoy for his choices and his attitude problem, Harry was sure of one thing, the man loved his family and had ended up sacrificing everything for them.
She was almost there, he could tell. She must have spotted him on the stairs because suddenly a warm body sat down beside him, gently unclenching his hands from the banister and massaging them.
As if snapped out of a trance, Potter took a hasty step back, his hands however were still entangled in Draco’s hair and sent his new glasses flying. They both heard the distinct sound of glass cracking, as the spectacles hit the floor.
Without a conscious thought he reached for the conch shell on his nightstand and began to restlessly turn it in his hands, running his fingers along the craggy edges. There were so many things he had to work out, so much he was unclear about himself that he didn’t quite know where to start. As the rough outer layer of the shell brushed against his skin he remembered Harry standing in front of him twisting his hands uncomfortably on a square somewhere in a Muggle city. Latching gladly onto the opportunity to let go of his inner turmoil where his family was concerned Draco thought about why the image of Harry in distress bothered him so.
Harry couldn’t suppress the noise he made at the feeling of Draco nibbling on his earlobe. He was already lost and he didn’t mind one bit.
“I believe, if we could get one or two people who have been assaulted, to press charges or at least attempt to press charges, we will be able to trace what happens to the reports and see who is behind the campaign of blackmail that must be going on for all those assaulted to suddenly claim they fell down the stairs. I believe they would have tried the same with Draco if his case hadn’t been so high profile and even then they just made the reports disappear by misplacing the witness statement itself and neglecting to preserve any evidence.”
The torsion clock in the corner chimed brightly just after she had left and Draco realised that he was at least half an hour late.
Harry had no idea what the morning would be like, if Malfoy would be hung-over or what he would be like at all. Harry found, as he drained two large glasses of water in his ensuite that he didn’t know very much about this Malfoy at all.
The ground begins to shake and plaster dust start to rain from the ceiling. He can feel Harry’s hand gripping his forearm tightly.
The urge to give in to temptation was strong and Harry had to use all of his self control to break the kiss and back off. He pushed himself up on his arms, looking down on Draco, whose pupils were blown wide with lust. This wouldn’t do.
“I was just… just catching up on some reports.” Potter looked a bit lost for a moment as if he had no idea how he had got to where he was. “Wasn’t I in my office just now?”
Ginny had left with an early portkey. Harry was still staring at the spot on the floor where she had stood only moments ago. They’d had a fight after she had seen Draco wearing his clothes. He could tell that she was jealous and despite what he’d told her, he had to admit at least to himself that there might be reason for it. They had both agreed on an open relationship during the time she spent at Quidditch camp. Whatever happened in each of their lives while they were separated wouldn’t matter once they were back together again.
“I don’t want you to go. You are here with me every night, but in the mornings you are always gone. Why do you have to be so cruel?” He whispered, pressing his eyes shut as if that would help keep out the harsh reality.
“Harry, I know you usually see the best in everyone, but you have a massive blind spot. I said this before, but almost everyone who did something you consider as bad still deserves a chance at redemption. You told me your own son got sorted into Slytherin. Do you think he should be on a government watch list for his talents?”
That had apparently been the last thing either Harry or Granger had expected. The surprised expression on Harry’s face only grew in intensity when Draco pulled him close against his chest before quickly pressing his lips against Harry’s.
Something must have happened to make his family remove Pyxis so completely from their lives that only this diary which Pyxis himself had hidden away as well as the other belongings in his room remained behind. Where history was concerned, Pyxis had never existed. Draco had his suspicions as to why his ancestors had refused to acknowledge their son and had removed him as punishment.
When he opened the door and found Draco, soaked and windswept, Harry had to fight his impulse to bring him inside and take care of him. He looked confused and scared. Remembering his resolution from earlier, Harry schooled his face into a neutral mask and asked him what he wanted, when Draco, no, Malfoy, didn’t speak.
In cave about the size of Atrium at the Ministry, all the villagers sat in a circle around a larger raised stone slab. On the ancient altar lay an immobile figure. Wrapped around it was a creature that seemed taken from someone’s nightmare. It had an elongated upward twisting body like a scorpion with eight spidery legs. It also had a birdlike beak and sharp claws and then there was a plethora of tentacles growing from what must be the creature’s chest. They were wrapped around the figure on the stone and it took Draco a moment to realise that figure was Harry.
He was scared. What if the memory itself would overpower him and he would forget everything again. Harry remembered the acute loneliness he had felt, when he had lost his sense of self, the total isolation even now crushing his heart. Draco was the last person he remembered speaking to before the dream had begun. Maybe he knew what had happened and how Harry had come back to Grimmauld Place.
Draco is really scared now. Harry’s hands are roaming his torso, now and then squeezing a nipple but ever more obvious in their directions. Surely he wouldn’t, this is still Harry. But then Harry pushes his knee between Draco’s legs from behind and rubs his erection against the cleft of Draco’s clothed arse.
Malfoy’s hand was touching his. His skin felt electric where they were connected and desire so intense rushed through him that he quickly tore his hand away, wiping it on his trousers to stop the mortifying feeling. The entire exercise proved pointless. After months of peace of mind the want was back, burning hotter than ever before. The people surrounding them all but forgotten, it took all of his not inconsiderable self control to not lean in and close the gap between them and letting his fingers run all over Malfoy’s beautiful body.
“Without you,” he paused again. “They don’t understand that we almost didn’t win, that it took people from the other side to help us win. They don’t understand what price we had to pay to get here. We all lost someone we love. And I have lost so many people, Draco. I can’t bear the thought of losing anyone else.”
“I’m sorry, but I mean it. Not tonight, maybe tomorrow morning, when we’re sober, if you… if you still want to…” Harry’s voice trailed off. He didn’t know what else to say and he felt guilty enough as it was.
“Now, hold on!” the little man shouts and Draco can feel the paralysis leaving him just as he bends down with his bucket again. His hand shoots out and grabs hold of the tiny insect and he is yanked forward with such force that he loses his footing. The small creature drags him along and up for a few metres before the tiny man stabs his hand again and Draco drops like a stone.
Everything felt surreal in this dark and silent room and Draco allowed himself the luxury of admitting that he’d always loved watching Harry sleep. His Harry was beautiful in his sleep with no worry lines marring his features. If he’d been able to, Draco would have stretched out his hand and caressed the soft skin of Harry’s face.
The man’s hood is drawn deep into his face, most likely to keep out the cold, but at the same time hiding his features from view. If only Draco could see the man’s face, he wouldn’t feel so vulnerable. If only he had somewhere to focus his anger and fear.
Harry saw disappointment flicker across Draco’s features and, overcome with the need to reassure Draco, he leant down and kissed him again. He gathered Draco into his arms and held him as tightly as he could. His face was pressed against Draco’s and he was breathing onto Draco’s neck.
“Don’t worry about it.” Harry said as he clumsily dabbed at his wet sleeve with a filthy paper napkin. Draco made a face. Harry swayed dangerous in his seat and had to quickly reach out to cling to the tabletop to stop himself from toppling over.
He’d once made the mistake of actually showing up with everyone else and had been forced to realize that nothing had changed. He’d been shoved, cursed “Death Eater scum”, had been spit on and somebody had even set his cloak on fire. In the end he had to flee into the tiny space of one of the men’s rooms, jamming his shoulder against the door while quickly applying a locking charm to escape his tormentors.
“Luna, I know you said you wouldn’t reveal any of your patient files to me.” He says and quickly adds “and I respect that,” when it seems like she is about to protest. “I looked into the data available to me without raising too many red flags, but I need more. I don’t want to pressure anyone into anything that would endanger them. I was just hoping you’d be willing to ask some of them to speak to me. For this case to move forward, I need confirmation and I need reports to be filed and people to press charges. If that doesn’t happen, I’m not sure how to help them. Especially since the only person I know who wanted to press charges won’t talk to me.”
His hands were in Harry’s hair, tilting his head this way and that, so he could easily control their kiss and explore Harry’s mouth at will. Draco enjoyed the feeling of Harry’s hands on his buttocks, where they’d slid into his trousers and pants, kneading and pinching and pulling their crotches even closer together. Their shared breath left their bodies in ragged gasps and Draco could tell that Harry was close. Reaching behind him he removed Harry’s hands from his pants and stood up, smiling wickedly at the disappointment he saw on Harry’s face.
His steps are oddly light and silent as he walks, as if the floor is made up of sponges. The light is off too. It is so bright that it hurts his eyes where it hits the puddles of water left from the rain. Draco looks around himself; he wants to look down at his feet to find out what causes the lack of noise but somehow looking down isn’t one of the options available to him, no matter how hard he tries.
Draco could feel his heart racing and took a sudden step back. He collided with the chair, which in succession collided with the desk, which bumped into the bookshelf and made one of the smaller picture frames shake and tumble to the floor. The sound of breaking glass was loud in the small space.
I was cold and lost, the pain was unbearable, but I knew I couldn’t stay put. So, through the pain I stood up and left the cave. The pull that never hurt before, was pulling me down to the ground with each step I took. If I ever doubted that the curse was activated before I knew right then that it was in fact what I was feeling. Each step was like stepping on glass with sharped edges.
“Malfoy! I thought you were in hiding with your dad since before sixth year. Why are you chained to a wall?”
"Sorry, that was me I always wanted to go on a date with you, so I guess this was what the room decided I needed."
When he finished talking Harry came over and talked to me. “I know it must hurt being kept from the one you are mated with, but just this once, stay here and wait for it to be over. I need you to be alive when this is all over, so that we can talk about this. I promise that I will see you after this battle.”
He hugged me, pulled back and placed the ring on my finger he went into kiss me, but I stopped him. “Harry, I have one request before we get excited and end up snogging all day…again.”
I decided to speak up. “Longbottom… I know you won’t believe me, but… I was with Harry, Ron, and Hermione just before I fainted. Ron had left the three of us before we went to Godric’ s Hallow and the two of them had to leave quickly and left me behind. If you don’t believe me stored in my wand are memories of the time, I spent with them. You are free to look at them. I am going to go to the restroom now.”
I was forced to take the task of helping Hermione out with Malfoy, which was easy, and got easier when he woke up. At first, he wouldn’t speak to anyone, but Hermione. Which was okay because most of the time was spent with Ron yelling at me. We walked into the room shortly after he awoke, I took notice of everything about him. His hair a pale blond that most girls would kill to have. His eyes a strange blueish silver. A long time ago, I wanted so much to be his friend, but then I saw the truth of his character. He was cruel, and mean, but now he was frail, and weak.
I looked at him as he glanced at the clock and as he left, he said one final thing. “Malfoy, you know you can call me Harry, right?”
She froze for awhile as Harry squirmed in my arms, and to my utter shock proceeded to shout. “You finally told Harry that he is your mate!” The entire Hall went silent as hundreds of people looked at her as if held in tension. Then Harry, without stopping said, in the happiest tone of voice I had ever heard before, “Yep, we have been dating for a week now and I wanted to tell others. So, here we are telling you.”
He shrugged his shoulders, and his brother left with Harry. I began to fear that this was the last time I was ever going to see him again, so I shouted. “Potter!” He looked back at me. “If you don’t come back, I make no promises about what I am going to do, but you will never know the truth. You better come back Potter!” Harry ran up to me grabbed me by the shoulders and kissed me. “I will come back for you Draco, and if I die, and that is a big IF, then you will be free to be with your mate. Until I die you are stuck with me Malfoy. I will see you later Draco.”
“Hermione, I would be a fool not to trust you after all you’ve done for me. You convinced Weasley that I wasn’t a spy, you healed me, and are letting me join you even though I have done nothing but hurt and mock for as long as I’ve known you. So, this is the least I could do in return.”
I thought no one would save me or even help me, but I was running out of options. After I started the summer before my sixth year at Hogwarts, I was faced with a nightmare many thought dead for years and yet there he was standing to greet me as I entered my house for the summer.
He entered the room a big smile on his face and dirt covering him. He ran to me practically causing me to fall, he kissed my lips again and I was the happiest I had ever been. It made me wonder why I ever hid my feelings in the first place. I was ready to tell him everything, but I was exhausted and before I could think about it, I had fainted into his arms asleep. I told myself that when I awoke, I would tell him everything… Hopefully.
“Don’t apologize Draco, this is my fault. I wasn’t raised with this knowledge, and I should have done some research about Veela before making that comment. I am the one who should be sorry.”
I don’t remember how long I was down there when he finally just tried talking to me. I ignored him, which isn’t a good idea I guess since it got much worse after that. I was beaten every day, no stopping or breaks and very little to eat. I wondered if this is what hell was like or if it could get even worse than this. But it did. He’d add more to what was done to me every day when finally, he asked me to join him. All I had to do was accept him and follow him and I could be free, my father would sometimes join him in trying to persuade me it didn’t work.
"Harry, it has been two weeks and three days since I last spoke to you, and if I wait any longer without contact with my mate my body will deem it as a rejection and I will die. I am certain that if we do not have this conversation now then I will die before I can talk to you about anything."
And that's the end of this story folks! Thanks for sticking in there till you got here. I hope you liked it!
“If he has awakened that curse there is no way he could live by himself. I don’t know what happens to the Malfoy’s, but no one has ever survived the process of starting the curse without something bad happening to them. Harry, if we don’t have him with us his body might literally try to kill itself.”
Even though they had gotten some hair from her when leaving the Manor, it did not mean that it was the best course of action. So, they thought of a plan without me. When they were done Hermione went to find water so Harry and I were left alone.
Harry laughed and picked up the first diary I used after the escape and said. “I don’t have to write mine down. I got them memorized.”
I knew then that I was the key to his curse, but I wasn’t sure I knew what I was getting myself into.
Both Luna and she nodded their heads. “You forgot that Veela, who have found their mate but haven’t completed the bonds, once away from their mate will slowly fall into a sleep state until either their mate is there, or something with the scent of the mate is near them. That is something you should remember until your bonded to Harry.”
His face had been distorted but his eyes had stayed the same bright emerald green that I always envied. I spoke with my harsh voice that was chalky compared to his velvety smooth voice. “Can’t even remember an old school bully of yours? I must be losing my touch if even Potter can’t recognize me.”
“Well, you have far more people to tell then I and my side won’t threaten to kill you if you hurt me.”
“Will you two both stop yelling he might have a headache and you could be making it worse.” They stopped talking and she continued. “Now, Malfoy care to tell us why you have been missing for a year.”
I was shocked, and in that moment, I felt mad at someone who wasn’t the Bald menace. I felt that I should help him.
I was right about the most wonderful smile ever. Harry, and I had made it back to the house we shared at Christmas, and to my disgruntled nature found all of my diaries that I had written about this whole adventure. He looked at the words I had written concerning the curse and he started to cry.
I awoke to the sight of the same people who were in the dungeon surrounding me on a bed in a place I didn’t recognize. I was no longer chained, but I had no idea what had came to be after I had fainted in front of the Boy who lived. I looked around at faces of people I pretended to hate during my school years and moved to sit up, but someone stopped me.
“Draco, I have been wondering about how we would see each other from now on and I thought I might have to spend the summer without seeing you…”
“Those are my wings, and currently they are protecting us from the on rush of students begging for our attention.”
“I know. But once we start going other places, the world, mostly our friends, will need to know. I don’t know much about your friends, but I think most of them, like mine, will not like the idea of us dating.”
“I have everything I could ask for right here in your arms. I don’t really want anything for Christmas. What about you, anything you want for Christmas?”
We planned to have our wedding to be the next summer at this very garden with all our friends and family at this place where I learned the value of my smiles for him. It was my way of making sure that next summer he’d smile for sure. He laughed at that comment but told me that it was perfect. It was my way of giving him just one more smile for the day.
Harry sighed, looking down at the wild animal before him. What was he going to do with this thing, he couldn't control it without magic. Groaning Harry made his way over to his bed and flopped down on it face first. "I thought you weren't going to give me trouble," he mumbled into the bed. Draco merrily stopped chewing on the fruit bar and gave the face down wizard a look that said, 'you wish'. He then returned to the bar and continued eating. His ears swiveled like a cat's behind him as he heard Harry adjusting himself on the bed behind him. It didn't take him long to finish off the bar and start wandering around the dorm, sniffing around the other beds.
Draco tried to look apologetic but just couldn't force it out. He had seen what Fenrir was capable of when the man was alive, and the name still made him sick to his stomach. Hati seemed to understand though.
No matter what he had tried the damned thing wouldn’t come off. In the first few years he had tried potions, curses, charms, you name it, in anger. Now it reminded him, sadly, of what he couldn't have. That Harry, LeFay, was still alive somewhere but didn't care a damn about him. Deep down though, he was hopeful. Perhaps it stayed firmly clasped together because part of Harry still lived in LeFay, perhaps LeFay was just waiting for the right moment to come and claim him. Yet, it never happened in all those six years.
“Heir Malfoy,” Harry nodded, bowing sarcastically before going back to unpacking his things. Draco was pleasantly surprised, it was the first time Harry had called him by his title. Maybe he was getting better manners when dealing with purebloods.
"I would never my boy," Albus said, sounding shocked. Oh how Severus wanted to roll his eyes but didn't risk it in the Headmaster's company. "I just didn't think you would go out of your way for some one that wasn't in your favor."
"Potter, do you know what a familiar is?" Snape interrupted; a rather vile looking sneer on his face, "Not those pets student's bring in for their classes, but real familiars."
Draco could hear the sudden snap and crack of Harry’s magic as the man stood suddenly. He looked over at Harry who, despite the magic fuming around him and causing the air to crackle, looked fairly still put together.
As they entered their room, after passing through a luggage check, Harry was awestruck by the color scheme. The room was done in mostly green and black, with hints of purple. He was so infatuated with the coloring that he didn’t even notice the bed until Draco pointed it out.
"Potter!" Severus snapped as he heaved the heavy mass into his arms, clearing the middle island with wandless magic and setting Draco's body up on it. "This is not the time! Help me!"
Twelve people had shown up within the past three days as well. Draco never saw them, but he could hear their voices when he passed by the drawing room. He couldn’t make out any of it out do to a privacy ward on the room, but he could tell the difference between each. They never left the drawing room, which lead Draco to believe that the floo there was open for them beforehand.
“But this year, he had his inheritance, he didn’t seem that different!” Neville interrupted, hopeful.
“They don’t have to do this, I trust them just as they are now,” Harry protested. He wouldn’t want them to swear themselves to anything they didn’t want to do.
Ammit hissed and rubbed his face against Harry’s cheek. Harry nodded as he walked over to the window and opened it for Bubo, Ammit’s long tail dragging a bit on the floor.
“I wasn’t myself then,” LeFay answered and pulled his wrist from Draco’s grip. “Report back to me when you’ve checked the grave,” he added and left.
The scent that filled Harry's being calmed him beyond compare. Oh how he'd missed being this close. He'd grown tired of looking at an empty side of the bed.
Lucius let out a deep sigh and leaned forward, running his hands over his face. He was tired, tired of everything that been happening lately. Tired that they seemed to be always in peril one way or another. "After your mother looks you over," he stated softly.
Lucius stood up sharply, slamming his hands down onto the fireplace. He was fuming! "What about Sirius, Lupin, anyone?"
came the soft voice of the kitsune. After hearing it laugh at him for the last twenty minutes he was a little uneasy at the sudden change in attitude.
“Well, that was… Informative,” Remus stated as he lifted his head, placing his hand on Harry’s shoulder. Sirius chuckled and shook his head as he looked over at Lupin.
"He'll find some one else. Some one that can actually make him happy. Now let's focus on Albus and what he's planning," LeFay stated. Tatsuya grumbled as they started back into the paper work. LeFay conjured his patronus then, and as it formed a he stared at it. The cute version of a hebridean black dragon stared at him for a long moment, it tongue sticking out slightly. "Go tell the others that I want a meeting in five minutes, everyone needs to be here," he told his patronus. The tiny dragon opened its wings and flew through his office doors.
“Yes. To wipe all entities, he deemed dark off the face of the earth. Solidify himself as the leader of the wizarding world,” he paused, “Everybody wants to rule the world. Doesn’t matter what they sacrifice to achieve it either.”
Sorry again for short chapters, but I'm also trying to build up to where a lot of the action is going to start to happen once they are at Hogwarts, along with a lot of the major conflicts. I promise chapter 7 is going to be very interesting, but you guys are going to have to wait a bit longer than usual for that one.
Narcissa lifted her eyebrows in surprise. She hadn’t known this. She thought that Hogwarts had always been this way. “Why did Albus change the rules?” Narcissa asked, though she was sure Sirius and Remus wanted to ask the same question.
After they paid for the cauldrons Sirius decided that they would go ahead and stop by Menagerie’s first rather than head to Malkin’s. With how long it had taken with the fitting, making the clothes would probably take just as long. Harry walked ahead while Sirius carried the items they had purchased in an expandable bag he hooked over one shoulder. He watched Harry peek into the window before heading inside, and the smile on his godson/adopted son’s face was priceless. Sirius always knew Harry had a soft spot for animals.
Draco has been having some trouble himself, wondering if being this close to another is actually okay. Or if he is pushing his luck.
Harry knew that was definitely true. He sat there for a moment, staring up at Tatsuya who tilted his head. “Why did you chose… What you chose to sing,” he asked and blinked up at him. The Kitsune seemed confused for a moment before it too sat down, still looking down at Harry.
There; in a rocky clearing next to a cave entrance was the most breathtaking sight Harry had ever seen.
Harry stretched and glanced around as he woke, only to find that Remus, Sirius, and Parvati where already gone. Much to his surprise. The fire was all coals by now and Bill sat discussing something with Severus on the other side. Harry cleared his throat.
Charlie shook his head, “Not well. Whatever spell hit him: whether it was a combination of a curse and another spell, stunners, or something that hit him while he was shifting; is proving to be challenging.”
Draco smirked to himself, it was as good as a time as ever to explore the Lord's private quarters. LeFay wasn't paying attention, and would probably be at it for a while.
“Now Draco, we talked about this before we even came here. Plans have just changed, you two sharing the room will work better than you by yourself. That way if anything does happen you'll each have the other’s back. Am I understood?” Narcissa stated, glaring till Draco nodded.
Harry felt his animagus form dissipate, leaving him kneeling in the snow as he looked up at the monstrous being. A full grown dragon looked down at him, eyes narrowed in irritation. It took a moment for LeFay to gather himself as he recognized the Hebridean Black looking down at him. He closed his eyes and bowed his head, letting out a sigh of relief.
“I’m glad. Tatsuya give in a bit to Harry, you had your time to live. You are only his guide for the moment, remember that,” Hisashi warned.
“Yes… Though we’d rather not like to share it. Why are you telling us about Harr- Lord LeFay’s?” Narcissa questioned. She was puzzled, most people tried to keep their inheritances a secret for as long as possible, though she knew some that would out right flaunt it. However, the few that did where sometimes shunned for the fact they were part something else. Especially with the strict magical creature laws placed by the Ministry.
Harry slowly relaxed as Remus continued speaking, coming to a slow understanding. Sirius nodded along and when Remus finished Harry didn’t feel so frightened. He was worried about what he would do about school, not to mention he didn't even know what day it was. Shit, he didn’t even know how long he'd been out. He looked back at himself in the mirror and then slowly started to get to his feet. With help from his two father's he wasn't as hard as he thought it was going to be. He'd hopefully get his land legs back in time.
Draco wasn’t sure what happened, but he watched as LeFay seemed to change, his overall aura becoming darker and his posture lifting. He watched as the green eyes looked up at him, and he couldn’t help the bit of arousal that flushed through him.
“Leave us,” LeFay commanded, eyes locked with Draco's. Douglas seemed the only one hesitant to leave, but a quick nudge from one of the others and he left with a glance at his Lord.
Regulus stepped up being Harry and smiled, “It will be fine,” he said to the counter man. Upon seeing him, and glancing at the Lord Black finger on Regulus’ hand he started to apologize but Regulus cut him off.
The room was silent but Severus could tell Augusta was pissed. As was Albus but he was the one getting all the dirty looks. Neville was pale and he was sharing an empathetic look with Harry who had his hands tightly wound into Ghost’s fur. Sirius looked pissed, and Severus was even sure that if Remus hadn’t been holding onto the man he would have already hexed the old fart. Severus shifted his gaze to Harry, feeling a pang of guilt. If he had known. Yes, it would have been hard to take Harry in, but he would have if he'd known. For Lily.
LeFay paused mid step, gaze falling to the ground for a moment before he glanced over his shoulder. “I have to attend to other duties first, but I plan to when I get the chance. After all, his is my mate now, and that can not be undone.”
He stood up, keeping his eyes on the castle walls ad he started across the moss-covered ground. Keeping his wands drawn Draco walked through the large arching gate way; his eyes searching the stone walls for any hints of what this place might be. Looking around the courtyard he could see a few bubbling fountains, and heard birds chirping like it was the middle of spring. He couldn’t help but smile slightly,  this place was amazing. He'd heard about places being kept seasonless with magic or stuck in a particular season but he'd never seen it done before.
“Some, the mind healers are working as well as they can, and I have August testing out another lead. Something is awfully fishy when it comes to the deaths of his family. Fenrir was a savage, but his own family, it just seems off.”
“Yes, I suppose that assumption is correct. If you were to go to a mind healer Tatsuya’s essence could be purged. Perhaps a muggle trained counselor or therapist?” he suggested, “Now, go ahead and take your proper form,” Hisashi’s white maw frowned, his head turning slowly to the opening of the maze. “It would seem we have a guest.”
Harry sat on his throne, looking bored as he sipped at his goblet. His nails tapped away on his chair as he waited for the last of his council arrived. “August should have arrived by now,” he growled quietly.
“Do you really think that something so big, so powerful, would just offer itself up on a platter if it didn’t want to?” Hisashi scolded, “We are creatures, animals, not constructs made by society. If he really didn’t like submitting to you, he wouldn’t. Dig deeper, dig deeper and you will understand the truth.”
“Good, I’ll speak to you after then,” Tom stated, then turned to face the transparent wall as he watched the rest of the participants enter the other room.
Severus pulled out two more potions, a sigh escaping his lips. “These two are the last positions of Cadmael’s treatment. One will finish removing any memory tampering as well as heal and help pull any memories into the missing time gaps Cadmael has currently. The other will remove the rest of the compulsion and suggestment charms,” Severus explained. He then turned to Cadmael, uncorking them and holding them under Cadmael’s nose, “Do you take these potions willingly?” Severus asked Cadmael. The beastman nodded slowly, eyes clouded in a moment of confusion and pain. “The potions will take a moment.”
Sirius was shaking with rage, “If only Albus hadn’t done what he did! If he hadn’t chained him like a dog Harry would have learned to control himself, to find his balance!” Everyone went silent as Sirius panted for breath.
Harry woke the next day to the sound of a house elf popping into the infirmary. Yawning he sat up as the house elf set a plater next to his bed with breakfast on it before popping away. He ate slowly, unable to think anything else but the worst happening to Parvati and Draco. He gave up eating three minutes in and then sat back in bed, closing his eyes and breathing slowly. He might as well do some exercises to try and return his body to normal. His tails he had mastered hiding but turning his legs and ears back to normal proved extremely difficult.
With Ammit's death Draco has to suddenly his place at Harry's side. Without it Harry's power would become wild.
“They aren’t just your apples.” There was a slight pause as Harry glared at him. He blinked a few times and opened his mouth before closing it again and looking down at his horde of apple slices. Slowly he pushed the plate of slices towards Draco with one slim finger, his eyes never leaving the plate as Draco hesitantly grabbed one.
“I’m fine,” Draco told his dragon. The Hebridean Black smirked, dark scales humming underneath Draco’s skin.
Severus shook his head, "He is too unstable. The change back by itself would kill him. Hand me the tears."
Snape glowered from his seat, his arms crossed over his chest. On the inside, Snape smiled a little, he was thoroughly impressed.
Draco took another sip of his tea and shivered, his dragon blood wasn't use to being active in this weather. He'd much rather be hibernating right now.
Harry was confused, turning his head to look over himself, his tails moved with him, curling towards him so he could see them. They were longer now, almost trailing on the ground and his fur was the same. His antlers felt a bit heavier as well, but not by much. “Most of the time, when one first transforms it is the first stage of ones animagus form. The more you go back and forth the more your animal, or in this case creature, self catches up with you. With magical creatures, this happens even more,” McGonagall explained. “So, he is probably grown a bit since his first transformation.”
Harry jumped a little and then headed into the store with just as much energy as a thrown bouncy ball, going from cage to cage and item to item, everyone else around even started to smile. Ghost on the other hand, was not so energetic. He trailed behind Harry slowly, glancing at the cages and gulping. He almost regretted suggesting the idea as he glanced around, trying to stay out of the way as Harry made his way to the front desk. He looked up at them as they spoke.
“Thanks,” Draco muttered as he dusted himself off. Harry nodded and then turned to Remus and Sirius as they stood in the doorway of the drawing room.
“You know, when I saw you I almost didn’t recognize you,” Bill stated before heading forward again. Harry trotted after him.
“I guess,” he finally gave in and grabbed a piece of parchment and his quill. “I need to tell Severus what has happened.”
“It’s another rumor sighting,” Narcissa stated, emotionless. Draco took the letter from her and read over it himself.
Severus snapped back around to face LeFay, furious. He shoved Harry back against the wall, watching the Lord bounce against it without phasing him, "I swear if you don't go after him. If you break his heart again," Severus snapped, grabbing the front of LeFay's robes, "I won't care if it kills me to put you in the same misery you put him through everyday," he snarled.
“I am not brooding,” he mumbled under his breath as he tapped his wand on his suite case, opening another compartment. A house elf popped into view, startling Draco enough that he almost dropped the glass dragon egg replica he had in his hand. “A warning beforehand would have been nice!” he snapped. The house elf pulled at the ends of its ears and bowed apologetically. “Well-ll.”
“The room is past those guards there. Just head inside and they’ll start. Everyone else is already inside," the goblin spoke and pointed a finger, "The inheritance test will be taken afterwards."
Harry sat straight up, panic setting in. "Malfoy Manor!?" he all but screamed. He went to whip the blankets off himself but Severus' hand grabbed his.
Harry almost pissed himself as he jumped out of bed, looking around for who spoke. He heard booming laughter and relaxed as he realized it was coming from himself. He left out a sigh of relief and then went over to the window, moving the shades back and opening it. Bubo blinked in the bright light and hooted from his perch at Harry.
Harry, along with Bill, Charlie and a few others start out on their journey to find the dragon, Draco, and Parvati. Of course he leaves out the tidbits of what happened last night.
Harry looked at the wall behind the man, scanning the more decorative collars. “Oh! That one!” Harry said, pointing at a collar on the wall, that looked rather expensive.
It was Remus’ turn to chime in, talking quickly before Sirius could speak. “Albus Dumbledore,” he snarled, “The man blocked most of Harry’s powers, including his creature half and almost killed him. Now his magic has gone haywire do to the sudden release of the blocks. Though I’m sure Harry feels much better now; even with his accepted titles his creature half still overcompensates. Not as badly as before, but they are still side effects.”
Harry seemed to notice Draco’s eyes wandering and tightened his jaw as he leveled their gaze. “What did you want Draco?” he growled.
Harry nodded his head and then slowly stood up, carrying his heavy familiar with him. He set Ammit in his tank as Harry went to start changing. “Why are you telling me to save it for tomorrow?” Harry asked as he started stripping. He heard the Kitsune moving again, seeming like it was getting comfortable while Harry was starting his bed routine.
“Stable, we were able to get quite a bit of information from his memories, as I’m sure you’ve seen. But we’ve run into a pretty big blockage, formed during his childhood, and one within the last few days. The mind healers are currently working on both. The exhaustion has kept him under for most of it,” August explained, eyes scanning both men before he stood. “Have you gone to see Draco yet?”
There was a low growl echoing in LeFay’s head before Tatsuya looked over his shoulder at the wizard.
Harry felt guilty about what had happened, if he hadn't done what he did to Draco, if he hadn't suspected Draco being a death eater maybe this all wouldn't have happened.
“Well… I’ll sleep on this side and you on that one. So, you can be closer to your… Snake,” he hesitated as he watched Ammit climb up the bottom bedpost. He shuddered and then headed to the bathroom to change; Ammit reminded him too much a Nagini.
“Lady Malfoy, Mister Malfoy, we’ll see you at dinner,” Remus stated and nodded at them before closing the door.

“Also," Black spoke up quietly, bowing his head, "I was wanting to inquire about the Black’s Vaults." The goblin's eyebrows rose.
Draco roared. Severus hands went to his head, physically in pain from the assault on his mind. The sticky charm disintegrated as Draco got shakily to his feet, he tried to leap off the cot, only to fall in a heap as his legs gaze out.
When Ghost didn't move Snape pushed the animal with his foot. It made a noise Harry had never heard before, almost like a squirrel chattering in a tree, and then started following Harry out of the hall.
Harry could feel the eyes scouring his body as Draco just sat there staring. He swallowed. He felt like an animal being appraised before being shipped off to who knows where. Then the door opened behind Draco and Narcissa appeared, followed closely by a very worried looking Remus and Sirius. “Lord LeFay, are you okay?” Narcissa asked as she stepped around her son and helped Harry to his feet. “Draco, you shouldn’t just be sitting there,” she chimed.
It did have a mouth, he realized as it spoke, but it was a jagged line spawning part of its neck and head, glowing green from within. He had to looked away from it, not because of fear, but the utter defeat surrounding him. It seemed to feel the sadness and disappointment coming from Harry as it leaned its head forward and pressed its face again Harry’s. Harry smiled slightly, unsure and still terrified.
“He isn’t normally like that,” Harry interrupted, “Albus has him under some form of compulsion or suggestion charm. His memories are also a mess, Albus had done just as much, if not more twisting than he did to get me to fit his mold. It’s changed him.”
“Draco! Finish packing and stop brooding!” Narcissa yelled from downstairs. Draco scowled at his door before placing more clothes into his trunk, along with a few priceless trinkets he had grown accustom to having.
“Isn’t that a bit dangerous?” Harry noted, looking a bit worried. Theo smiled big, flashing a set of almost saber looking fangs.
Severus nodded sadly, looking down at his Godson who seemed to be nearing the end of his mental break.
Draco was panting as he stood in front of LeFay, even though he was on the other side of the desk LeFay could feel the little dragon's anger right down to his bones. Draco's eyes had turned the color of the dragon's he held beneath his skin, making LeFay's skin crawl. Draco must be very emotional to let his control slip, LeFay noted. Standing up slowly LeFay gestured at the door. "Leave," LeFay commanded in a low voice.
Draco wasn't listening anymore as he got to his feet, wobbling as he started to step towards the bed.
Tatsuya growled, curling tightly around LeFay's mind. Harry, LeFay, tried to shrug him off, but soon gave into the urgent pulling at his mind.
Draco leaned over Harry and smirked, “Course I will. We are bonded now after all, I mean, even our magic has settled, no more creature features,” he said with a light laugh as he tugged at his hair where his horns used to sit. His face became serious for a moment as he helped Harry to his feet. “I have to ask a serious question first,” Draco’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Do you love him, Cadmael I mean?”
“Blocking someone’s core is like duck tapping a dog’s mouth shut,” Sirius cut in. Remus took a moment to collect himself and continued, thanking Sirius quietly.
Draco stood there for the next ten minutes in the dark before finally giving in to the fact Harry wasn’t going to put on any more clothes.
Harry leaned over to his night stand and grabbed his own class list, setting it on the table so they could compare.
What he found there was not disgust, malice, or even anger. Fear yes, but it wasn’t what he thought it would be like. It was fear of him yes, but fear that Draco would be unworthy of LeFay’s presence, that he wouldn’t be useful. Fear that he wouldn’t be what Harry needed. Fear of his power yes, from good reason, but there was also an overwhelming amount of arousal. Lust, and the longing to make Harry his and his alone. He was surprised and pulled away from the connection, but something lulled him back to the connection point, so hesitantly Harry placed his hand back on it. He smiled then, a sense of security, and trust enveloping him. Draco trusted him, respected his power. With someone as strong as LeFay on his side he wouldn’t have to worry about defending only himself, he’ll have something to defend him and have his back while he was weak. He wouldn’t have to be on guard as often. Relief, a strong sense of relief that he wasn’t alone anymore.
“Careful with that,” Harry croaked, his throat felt really sore. Like he had been screaming all day long.
“I think he and Ginny are still salty about you breaking up with her before summer started. Plus, the fact, we…,” she trailed off and bit her lip a little. Harry nodded in understanding and then looked over at Neville and Luna before glancing around more and frowning.
There. Draco stopped fast in his tracks. It was faint, oh so faint. Nails dug into hardwood and stone as Draco flipped around the edge of a staircase, blood splattering as he loped up the staircase. He was panting as he got to the top, never mind the frantic calling of Severus and now his mother from below as the ran after him. The floor switched to carpet and he could feel himself weakening as he stumbled. He had to get to Harry though, he had too! He pushed the door open to his right with his nose. When it didn't budge he started ramming it with his body, his mouth become bloody as he tore at the door. Finally he made a hole and squeezed through just as someone tried to grab him. The door flew open and he stopped in his tracks, looking up at a very human looking Voldemort.
“Did you only just finish?” he was surprised. Harry nodded sheepishly and rubbed the back of his head.
Luna smiled sweetly and leaned her face into her hand as she rested her elbow on the table. “Everything has been amazing. I came into my creature inheritance earlier than my parents expected. They knew beforehand but wanted to surprise me,” her voice sounded just as distant as ever as she tilted her head to look at the ceiling. “It’s a pretty long held tradition that every few generations there is a girl born with a unicorn inheritance. I’m pretty lucky.”
He hadn’t really been thinking when he told Draco about the favor he wanted him to do, but in his defense Tatsuya hadn’t stopped him either.
“Come, it’s been a long day. Lets rest with some tea,” Draco suggested, taking the taller man’s hand and leading Harry into the next room. They sat down on the sofa, with Harry resting his head down into Draco’s lap. “Is this how it will always be?” Draco joked.
Bill looked at Charlie and they seemed to share a look before Charlie spoke. “I’m not sure about the hissing, but the black blur Harry saw could have been the dragon. Which means it might have taken Parvati. I don’t know why it would unless Parvati’s creature inheritance coincides with its own biology. We’ll have to ask her sister, since they are twins it’s likely they have the same inheritance,” Bill nodded as Charlie finished speaking, scratching his head.
"No one you need to be worried about. Now, that's all you remember?" Snape was worried now. If Harry had forgotten about what he'd done, and about Draco how was he going to explain everything.
“Well, I’ll go get ready then,” Harry giggled. They smiled at him for a moment before going back to bickering as he headed back up to his room. Harry sat down on his bed with a light laugh and then went to push up his glasses when he realized he didn’t have them on.
“I don’t have a creature inheritance but I’m betting its connected,” he stated. “Everything else I’m not sure about. He also has physical wounds that look bad. I think the centaurs attacked him and Parvati when they crossed into their territory. I can’t get close enough to mend them or pull out what’s left,” Charlie explained.
Remus stared at Harry for a moment and then nodded slowly. “Apparently. I wonder why Dumbledore never spoke of it. It could have helped Snape a lot, perhaps we should tell him?” he suggested.
“I expect you were comfortable while waiting?” LeFay asked, quirking his eyebrow as he lifted his cup to his lips.
Ammit continued smiling as Harry’s eyes went wide and he sat back, mouthing wow as he looked up at the ceiling. He heard someone scoffing at him and looked down at Ammit.
LeFay's gaze bored into Draco's, confusion written across his face. What was Draco trying to get at?
“I’m never going to get use to this, am I?” he mumbled. As if answering his question one of his tails slapped his bare leg and then curled in on itself. It was almost amusing to watch as Harry scowled at the tails and tried to pin one of them so it stopped knocking his things off his nightstand. He sighed in defeat and grabbed a pair of black skinny jeans, only to find they wouldn’t fit or stay up because his tails where in the way.
'Fine!' LeFay snapped, handing over the "reins" so to say as Tatsuya took over LeFay's body movements. Without pause the dark kitsune sped up, bounding through the snow with ease compared to the dragging walk LeFay been doing. 'Don't waste all our energy!" LeFay snapped.
Sirius pushed through the crowd and stopped when he saw Draco on his hands and knees; Snape kneeling beside him.
The room burst out laughing as Ghost only seemed to look more triumphant with his handy work. Harry however wasn't amused. He turned to Dean who was laughing the hardest, "What exactly happened?" Harry asked.
"My turn then," he whispered into Harry's ear, and he could feel the automatic rush of arousal flowing through both of them. This was going to be an exhausting night, but he was going to love it.
There was a loud crash as Harry burst into the glade, his eyes searching for Draco. “Draco!’ he called out. The singing stopped and the smile faded from his face.
"Well, since unicorns are almost immortal beings, I'm not exactly full grown so...no laughing," she stated and pointed her finger at all of them. Her transformation was much like Theo's; in the fact that her clothes morphed with her. Everyone was smiling brightly when Luna stood, a small yearling version of a unicorn with a silvery mane and long spindly tail with silvery strands at the end. Her horn however was nothing but a small nub, compared to a full unicorn's. Only about the size of a person's middle finger. No one dared laugh at the very angry looking unicorn even as it tried to take a step and slid over the hardwood floor. Harry went over and petted her silky mane, grinning brightly.
Ammit commented. Harry blinked his eyes tiredly and yawned, looking around his room. Bubo wasn’t on his perch so Harry guessed the owl had gone out flying.
More explanations and discussions about Draco and Harry's return to Hogwarts, as well as some happy Ghost fluff at the end.
The comment froze Draco was as he sat up, his eyes glued to the bed he was sure Harry was in. Something in the back of the mind wondered why he wanted to be guarding Harry with his very life as well. Of course, Harry was his, no one else's. It was obvious.
LeFay chose not to respond as the doors behind his subordinates where pushed open. He watched in fascination, recognized the man instantly even after six years apart. As he stepped into the hall LeFay’s generals stood to face the intruder. LeFay, seeing them readying to attack, stood; clucking his tongue softly. The two vampires and werewolf in the room visibly relaxed at the cue, while Douglas, a wizard, was a bit slower to respond.
"Harry became a horcrux on the night of Lily's death," Narcissa answered so her love didn't have to. Lucius grunted in response, leaving space between him and his former wife so he didn't crowd her.
Draco recognized the voice as goatee man from earlier. He coughed, feeling his throat closing off as the vampire squeezed. “I didn't say I was. I’m not looking-for-trouble. Trying-to find-friend,” Draco managed to choke out.
Six years and no sign of Lord LeFay. No real sightings, no attacks, no deaths, and Gringotts refused them access to Lefay's accounts.
Harry nodded and relaxed a bit, the fear he felt slowly turning into awe. “Wait, if you are this old, and have all of your tails, how come I only have three?” Harry asked Tatsuya. The kitsune seemed to be a little surprised but gave, what Harry thought, was a smile.
“Which one should we open first?” Harry asked, interrupting Remus' thoughts as he flipped the Gringotts letter over in his hand.
“I think that would be rather rude to spring ourselves on our guests,” Sirius stated as he stepped into the floo and dropped the powder. Harry grumbled and followed suite.
“It’s saying something about me coming for my mate,” Harry stated, not taking his eyes off the Naga.
Harry asked and bounced on the bed a little. Ammit laughed harder, and smiled in only the way a snake can.
“I will not swear loyalty to that reckless numbskull!” he shouted, enraged by the mere thought of bowing to Potter.
Draco put his tea down onto its saucer, "What happened at Hogwarts six years ago was not your fault!"
He had heard from Hermione how bad the creatures where treated in the wizarding community, especially under the Ministries’ rule, but he didn’t think it had gotten to where they were not getting the jobs they needed. He’d been so focused on the war and Voldemort he never really thought about the state of the wizarding world. How much didn't he know about it? Maybe he should talk to Hermione when he got back to school about what books he should be reading. She always seemed to be more informed than him. He had read a lot on the wizard bloodlines and etiquette from the Black library because Sirius thought he was highly ill mannered when it came to high-blood society, but he hadn’t thought about anything else. How was he so stupid? Harry frowned and started to play with the fur on his legs as he continued his debate with himself.
Draco’s stiff defiant posture cracked as he felt, and saw the magic pool around LeFay. It felt the same as when he’d first met LeFay after he disappeared. That day that seemed so long ago now, he swallowed and bowed his head just slightly. When the form changed and the leakage of magic started pouring from LeFay, Draco could feel his will weaken. The fear that this small animal below him had far more power than he could muster started to creep up on him, as did the building need to make this creature his.
"It's late, you'd be better off staying here rather than finding your way back through the halls. I'm sure you'd get lost," LeFay said as he dropped Draco onto the bed.
Harry’s eyes went wide and he slumped onto the ground, his legs flopping to the sides of his thighs.
“I’m fine… Just spooked that’s all,” he answered and looked up through the trees. Another scream, not human, echoed through the trees, causing Sirius to stop fussing.
“Tails?” Harry spun around in a circle as he tried to get a look at his hinny, almost falling over in the process.
LeFay felt his instincts kick into over drive as he gripped Draco tighter; the arrowhead pendant scorching his skin.
Harry woke up to bright lights. He squinted his eyes and tried to sit up, raised one hand to rub at his eyes. “Where am I?” he yawned.
Harry nodded, “Speaking of which, we should get redressed and head to the main hall. The meeting I called for should be happening soon.”
“Well that’s odd, it says this one is from Gringotts. What’s the other say Harry?” Remus asked as he took a seat at the table. Harry’s mouth twitched.
LeFay looked over the image, his lip curling as he spotted himself. Out of focus but clearly there. It must have been taken during his run to give the werewolves there reworked wolfsbane potion.
Harry continued to sit frozen to the spot between his two father-figures, thoughts buzzing around his ears. When he heard what Augusta said he lifted his head sharply, “That makes it sound like he did other things as well,” Harry commented quickly as she started escorting Neville out the door.
The Naga spoke mid leap at Harry. It landed short of Harry and then rolled up around Harry, staring down at him.
"I'm sorry Draco," Severus said as he knelt down to his godson's level. Draco shook his head, wiping at his eyes furiously.
With that the three headed back home to put the last things into motion before Harry and Ghost left for Hogwarts again. This was going to be their one and only chance to get some of these done before Severus took them back. Though, they had made quite a few new plans. Hopefully it all went as planned.
"Well," he said, starting slow as he lifted a hand to rub his head, "Not a lot I guess. I remember taking Ghost down from Gryffindor tower and heading to the potions room. We ran into you on the way there, and... Wait, did something happen with the familiar bond? Where's Ghost?"
Draco didn’t make any suggestion that he acknowledge what his godfather had said, instead choosing to stare into the fire.
Regulus nodded, “Your boy needs something so that people know he isn’t just a wild animal roaming around.”
LeFay tilted his head, "Curious," he said quietly as someone broke thought the wards. It was odd, he didn’t recognize the magical signature as one of his followers. Even then there was only a select few allowed to move through them freely.
LeFay looked up at the dragon, eyes comically widening. “But even as kitsune, he’s huge!” LeFay spoke, mouth feeling funny as he tried to talk, he wasn’t used to trying to speak in this form. Magic made most of it work so it felt odd.
Severus looked back at his godson, and nodded his head slowly. "Nagini was in the room with us when you two came in. I didn't know at the time until she was posed to strike me down. You jumped in between and fought her off, however, you took so many bites," he paused to lick his lips, "It would have been impossible to bring you back. Even now you are limited to the form you have until your core fully regenerates."
"Apparently he had," Tom spoke up. "We found various broken charms on Potter. It would seem he was under various compulsion charms as well as a few binding ones. Some of his memories have also been tampered with. Narcissa has spoken with a mind healer, but they said they can only work so much on an unconscious patient. They don't want to risk being the reason he never wakes."
"Hey mate!" Ron said as he entered the room. Harry looked up from the book he was reading to see Ron with Hermione right behind him. "No one else is up here right?" Ron asked, gesturing towards Hermione. Harry shook his head.
Neville and Luna where snickering behind them, grinning. "It's your turn now Theo, since you embarrassed poor Herm," Harry stated as he crossed his arms. Herm nodded from behind his leg and sat with her tail flicking. Theo groaned and then nodded, but smirked a little. Harry lifted his eyebrows slightly.
“Nothing you’d be interested in. People keep sending it back so I’ve just kept ‘em in the back here,” the man said as he scowled at Harry. “Why not come over here?” he said and tried to draw Harry’s attention. Harry was to focused on the wood shavings as they moved and the head of a green serpent looked up at him. The man grumbled and watched as Harry eyed the snake. Its scales where copper colored and patterned in what looked like a mane behind its head and along its back.
Harry perked up. Promise, what promise had he made to this boy? He turned his good eye over his shoulder, looking over the boy. "Promise?" he asked softly, blinking a tear out of his eye.
“I can’t make anyone happy, can I?” Sirius stated as he left the room with a huff. Both Lupin and Harry chuckled as he left before a few taps at the window drew their attention. Remus frowned as he went to open the window for the owl; only to have another one fly through. It landed on the table before dropping the letter, passing by Lupin again in a rush of cool air. While Lupin grabbed the letter from the first owl, Harry was already picking up the other from the dish it had landed on.
“Others do it because it’s basically like marriage, only more binding,” Bill cut in. Harry felt sick, and the expression on Draco's face made it worse as it went from slightly irritated to slightly sympathetic. It came to Draco then that Harry really hadn't know what he'd done. “It's super common among those with creature inheritances because it also allows them to share their magic, controlling those with excess amounts and so forth. The only catch, honestly, is that it is almost always based on a servant master relationship. One will always have more control than the other. Albeit it’s still has rules so the power can’t be abused...,” Bill rambled as he laid on his stomach with his head in his hands. “You ever hear about muggles' BDSM, it’s kind of like that.”
He left after that not a single word needed to be said after that. I was alone, empty, and cold as I cried my heart out for the first time.
This was the last place on earth that I wanted to be. I didn’t think that being caught by snatchers would lead them to bringing us here. But then again, last year I would never had thought I would go anywhere, but Hogwarts. It was a big shock to learn about Voldemort’s plan of eternal life, and way of defeating me. Horcruxes, some gross, nasty, little things made whenever some wizard kills someone and splits their own soul into an object. Dumbledore told me about these things last year, just before I watched Snape kill him. I promised him that I would find all them, and destroy them before trying to end the Bald menace, better known as He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.
“No ‘buts’, Draco. You have stayed in your room long enough. I’ll allow you to take it slow for a few more days, but you need to get involved in the family business again. Running away from it won’t make it go away.” She squeezed his hand once and then stood up again, the sound of her skirts oddly loud in the room as she walked towards the door. She turned around once more. “I only have your best interests at heart, Draco.”
“Look, Gin, I’m not going to argue with you about this. I’ll call him whatever I like and frankly I don’t care whether you are happy with that or not. Now, let’s just enjoy the day, the way we agreed we would and stop fighting, alright?”
Harry didn’t know what to do. Should he offer Malfoy some tea, or something stronger? He looked down at his still shaking hands. Whatever plans he made would have to wait till he calmed down sufficiently.
The floor was cold beneath his feet. Draco groggily walked over to the window, but just when he was about to close it, the wind brought the scent of freshly mown grass and just something that seemed to scream
Harry casually sat on the corner of Draco’s desk, passing him a cup of tea with ‘Aurors do it with shackles’ written on the side of it. Inhaling the delicious scent of Earl Grey, Draco hummed with pleasure. When he looked up, he could see Potter smile at him and couldn’t help but smile back.
“There wasn’t…” Comprehension dawned on Draco; he must have dropped the letter when the window had broken. He had forgotten all about it after finding out about the chamber. He seemed to have forgotten about a lot of things since then.
“You know very well what you said, just because someone has been sorted into Slytherin doesn’t mean they are a bad person. You should know that. After all you told your own son it didn’t change anything, so why is it different for everyone else?”
She slammed her mug onto the table, as she got up and pointed an accusing finger at him, spilling what was obviously cold tea everywhere in the process, even on the pages of her open book, which Harry now realised actually was the novel he was currently reading.
Harry stood still staring at Draco, his wand extended towards the boulder and smiling like there was no tomorrow, while the wind blew the strands of his hair around his head. It was like a punch to the gut when Harry realised he had never seen anyone more beautiful. The intensity of his own reaction surprised him. He tried to downplay the effect Draco was having on him by pretending to adjust his scarf, hoping Draco hadn’t noticed what could only have a smitten expression on Harry’s own face.
“Oh, the doctor said not to use magic and I like the cool evening air. The mosquitoes, however, not so much.” The lie fell easily from his lips. Because on top of sitting in the cool evening air, he also enjoyed being able to look outside at the stars, but telling revealing that to Harry felt much too intimate.
“Good morning to you too, Draco. Mr. Potter is here as my guest so before you go on, I suggest you rethink your behaviour.”
Harry didn’t know what to do or how to express what he felt except through outbursts of intense rage. He pushed the healer aside none too gently and stormed out of the hospital.
Draco didn’t know how he was going to get out of this; obviously apologising had been a bad move despite it seeming like the right thing to do at the time. Draco wished he could think clearly, but having Potter this close was incredibly distracting If only Potter wasn’t so damn attractive when his every fibre was humming with rage, his treacherous thoughts added. If Potter came any closer, he’d find out just how distracting he was being. Draco had to act and soon.
He ran his hands along Draco’s bare chest and sighed at the feeling of the warm smooth skin all there for him to touch. Draco smoothed back Harry’s bed hair and smiled when Harry in turn ran his fingers through Draco’s hair.
But what if the reason for Draco staying away was because he couldn’t remember anything either? Harry felt an overwhelming sense of loss at the thought of his memories being the only ones left of the time they had shared. What if it was too late? The thing between Draco and himself was something special, something that made him feel whole and truer to himself than he had ever felt before. Giving that up would be nigh impossible.
Draco nodded mutely. It was not like he had any choice in the matter. His mother’s skirts rustled as she made her way out of the room. Silence weighed heavily on them after she left. Neither Harry nor Draco seemed to be willing to break it. Draco stubbornly stared into his mug, preferring to watch the coffee grow cold to looking at Harry. When Harry finally spoke it was almost too quiet to hear.
Harry and Draco collapsed onto the sand at the bottom of the cliffs, both gasping out ragged breaths.
“Don’t pretend this is about anyone but you and me and your feelings, it’s always about you Draco, isn’t it? Always you, never us and never me. It’s about how I make
“So you don’t forget to whom you belong,” He whispered against Draco’s lips, before releasing him and helping to drape the cloak over him, making sure nothing showed.
Ignoring what he’d been told, Draco went to his room, took a quick shower, changed into his pyjamas and threw himself onto his bed. He promised himself that he wouldn’t cry. Not over Potter, not over how lonely he was, but before he knew it, he broke the promise he’d just made.
Draco shuddered, suddenly feeling cold. Was Harry behind why he felt so tired lately? Had he been doing something to Draco in his sleep? Draco’s wand was in his hand and trained at Harry within the blink of an eye.
When he was almost ready to come, Harry let go, leaving him on the brink. The stare Draco was subjected to made him tremble with its intensity. He was completely at Harry’s mercy and he loved it. Harry grinned wickedly for a second and Draco knew something deliciously indecent was about to happen. His expectations weren’t to be disappointed.
Before he could extricate himself, Potter had slammed him into the wall of the lift and was sucking wet kisses into his neck. For a moment Draco gave in, unable to hold back the moans that wanted to spill forth.
No hello, no nothing. But then, maybe Harry doesn’t deserve cordiality from Malfoy. Not after everything.
The slip and slide of their tongues felt amazing. Harry lost himself in the sensation, running his hands through Draco’s hair, while Draco clung to him, running his own hands down Harry’s flanks, desperately trying to untuck Harry’s shirt. Harry didn’t mind and groaned when Draco’s slender fingers finally found skin. Draco tasted like coffee and those sweet cakes he always liked to submerge in the milk foam every morning in bed.
they had was so very odd. At times it felt like a single word would be able to break it. And Draco didn’t even know whether he wanted it to last. This constant sense of unease was starting to wear him down. But then there were times, when Harry said something or did something so unexpected and wonderful that Draco forgot about everything else. Some small thing, said without thought that somehow made feeling torn and insecure all worth it.
“Pans, long time no see. What can I do for you?” Draco drawled in an attempt to hide his disappointment and the emotions still raw under the surface.
“Oi, Harry!” Ron shouted over the din, clapping Harry on the back, startling him enough that he almost fell off the chair and only Ron’s quick reflexes saved him from falling on his arse. “Easy there. I thought you’d got lost on the way back. I see the big bad wolf got you instead.”
“What do you want from him Potter? Are you bored? Is that it? Haven’t you fucked with his head enough already? I can’t even get him to leave the fucking house.” Her tone was accusatory.
It still looked like rain, but this time Draco had pre-emptively cast an umbrella charm on himself that wouldn’t wear off for another half hour. He realised he was too early and not wanting to appear too eager, which he wasn’t and whoever said that was a filthy filthy liar, Draco made a pretence of studying the window display in the shop windows across from the ocular specialists’ headquarters. Ten minutes before his scheduled appointment, he made his way through the drizzle and confidently stepped into the entrance hall, almost knocking over a man who’d stood too close to the opening front door. His sudden appearance had almost caused the man to lose his balance, making him reach for Draco’s arm to steady himself. The man, of course, was none other than Harry Potter. However brief the contact might have been, Draco’s skin felt like it was on fire where Potter had touched him.
Draco raised himself up on his knees and moved back a bit, resting the hand that contained the lube palm up on Harry’s shoulder to keep his balance and reaching behind him with the other to insert two lube covered fingers into his tight opening. He gasped and moaned as he worked himself open, fucking himself on his fingers. Draco knew exactly what he was doing – he was intentionally driving his lover crazy. Harry’s erection was leaking copious amounts of pre-come which pooled on his belly as he watched. Looking at Harry’s face, his pupils blown wide with lust and his gaze riveted on Draco’s undulating hips, a heady sense of power overcame Draco. Harry got off on watching him, he realised.
“I love how completely debauched you look, with your red lips that just beg to be kissed.” Draco was pulled upright close to Harry’s chest and his lips were yet again captured for a few short, biting kisses.
The something digging into his side however made it impossible. Draco shifted and tried to reach for it, causing the person behind him to tighten its grip around Draco’s middle. It took a bit of manoeuvring on Draco’s part, but he eventually managed to remove the thing he had lain on. It turned out to be a shard of what could only be the broken conch shell. What in Merlin’s name?
Cocooned in the lovely warmth of his embrace, Draco felt himself relax and let go of his fears. Maybe Potter wouldn’t leave, maybe he would stay with him a little longer. It didn’t matter what would happen later, it only mattered that he was here with him right now. It didn’t take long for both of them to drift off into a deep sleep.
“Potter.” Draco did not manage to hide his surprise at Potter’s obviously changed attitude towards him. He rose from the sofa and shook the man’s hand. “My son brought it in for repair last time he went shopping for school supplies. I didn’t even know we had a watchmaker in Diagon Alley.”
“Don’t stay up too long, Draco.” She says over her shoulder, before the doors close behind her, leaving him alone in the room that’s suddenly filled by dark and terrifying shadows. Draco leans into the sofa, pulling his knees up and hugging them to his chest. He grabs the blanket from the armrest where his mother sat and clutches it to him. The warmth from the fire still radiates from the fabric and Draco wraps this warmth around himself like the hug he so desperately needs.
Draco was nervous. He had accepted the fact that he would most likely never have hair again and would have to rely on a combination of hats and hoods for the rest of his life. He was only lucky that wizarding hats hadn’t gone out of fashion. With the way his luck was going it was only a matter of time. He stood in the foyer of Malfoy Manor, tugging on his tuxedo as if to fix its already perfect fit. A hand slapped his away.
That did it for Draco – the time to tease was over. He wiped his lube covered hand negligently on the sofa and crushed their mouths together, before coating Harry’s cock with the rest of the lube and stroking slowly up and down the pulsing length.
“I see you are still pretending to be a lesbian!” Draco finally said, indicating her dark trouser suit that showcased her beautiful legs to their best advantage.
That night, like so many before, Harry dreamt about what it would have been like to meet Draco under normal circumstances and when he woke the next day seemed even more bleak than it had the night before.
Draco was here, he was really here! Harry wouldn’t have been able to believe it, if it hadn’t been for the strong arms that held him. The time apart seemed to have been nothing but a bad dream, he was here with the man he loved and that was all that mattered, not how he got here or what happened, just this. Death and loss were a thing of the past, even Ginny. Ginny and the baby, his baby that he would now never get to know.
The man’s face was turned away and half-hidden in shadows, it was difficult to make out his features. This time there was no helpful notation on the back to allow Draco to identify who the man was, but he had his suspicions. He flipped several pages ahead, trying to find the place the picture had fallen from without any luck.
To forego having to open the curtains for more light, Harry casts a spell that leaves a dozen warm glowing orbs floating over the bed and casting a golden light. Draco visibly relaxes but doesn’t move other than that.
He looked at Potter who had a bemused expression on his face and was already reaching for Draco again.
He is so absorbed in his own world that it feels like he’s resurfacing from a deep and dark lake when his mother calls him to her side. Her tone is almost harsh. Draco walks over to her as if in a trance, he doesn’t know how long he stood by the window, but from the look on her face, she’s had to call him more than once. No wonder there had been a rebuke, however gentle. His mother isn’t used to being disobeyed.
Potter couldn’t hold back a choked sob, he reached for Draco blindly, grabbing hold of Draco’s neck with his free hand and burying his fingers in the hair at the back, all the while pulling him into their next kiss.
When he turned the corner of a large set of shelves, he found Pansy lying on the floor in a pool of what looked like blood. Draco knelt beside her, quickly feeling for her pulse. Relief flooded through him, when he felt it thready but surely under his fingers. The blood he saw came from a head wound that had knocked her out. He carefully examined her skull, but it seemed like she had been lucky, the wound still bleeding sluggishly seemed to be responsible for the blood on the floor, but was not life-threatening. After he made sure that Pansy was ok, he got up again. He had to find his son. Only when he stood, did he see the footprints leading from the pool of blood around Pansy’s head and shoulders further into the warehouse. They were not human. Draco could feel his own blood run cold, when he realised what they meant.
I followed her out of my room. We walked in silence through the hollow house, the sound of our shoes echoing as we make our way to the garden. We made it to the edge of the garden where we planned to start the wedding march. Mother and I walked toward Harry. It took everything in me not to run to him, but I was determined not to embarrass myself. I made it to the altar where he was standing. I wasn’t paying attention to anything that wasn’t Harry, so when we were to read vows his voice was the clearest thing I had ever heard.
He smiled as he put it on. He then dragged me out of my seat and into the garden saying, “Now for the rest of your present.”
“Yes.” He kissed me, and I did not want it to stop there. I wanted to claim, to be claimed, to give him everything, and to get everything in return. I suddenly relished in the idea of telling everyone that this man, that Harry Potter, was taken off the market for good, and that it was I who won him. I purred the thought. “Draco, why are you purring?”
“We haven’t even sat down with individuals and hear them threaten to kill you if you harm me yet. The troubles have only begun Draco.”
“No. I just… I wanted us to slowly tell others and not suddenly have the entire world knowing. I can’t be mad at Hermione being happy for us, nor at you for wanting to tell others.”
"Good follow me." I start walking to the room of Requirement. I hear his footsteps behind me. Once we get there the room has people walking everywhere. I know that I cannot ask them to leave but I instead imagine a place where Harry and I can be alone. I opened my eyes to see a picnic setting with a clear night sky. "Oh, now your just being funny."
I watched as he left. I whispered to myself, “Harry, I won’t be free to be with my mate if you die because you are my mate. I will die when you die.”
She opened the present and inside was a golden Narcissa plant with Lilly leaves. She gasped, and Harry responded. “A gift for both my mothers given to the one who is here to receive it. The gold changes colors depending on your mood.”
She smiled up at me and wiped her eyes. The rest of the dinner went smoothly. She sent us to bed early and Harry stopped us in front of the door to my room and spoke. “You would have died that day?”
I left the Hospital wing and wandered the halls of Hogwarts and entered the girl’s bathroom. Moaning Myrtle no longer stuck to this girl’s room for some reason so I sat in there feeling useless and worst of all empty. I had never felt so un-full until this day when I hadn’t seen him, haven’t held him, haven’t heard his voice, haven’t… haven’t… haven’t. “Harry…,” my voice croaked, “I miss you…” The words didn’t feel enough, but I struggled to find the whole of what it was. “I need you…” Still it wasn’t enough.
“Hmmm…” Harry seemed to think about it. He smiled before he gave his answer. “Well, unfortunately the only present I wanted this year was to marry you, and you insisted on waiting a year.” He laughed at his small joke as I glared at him. “Honestly, Draco there really isn’t anything I want. Though I would appreciate something to let others know I’m taken. I get a lot of random people asking me out and some of them don’t believe me when I say I am taken so maybe something to ward people away from me?”
“Well this part of the garden is special and filled with many important flowers. This part of the garden is called the lovers corner and the soil has a spell on it that keeps the flowers that lovers, who are bound by true love, plant alive and blooming so long as their love goes on. All the males in my family, as proof of their love have planted flowers for their wives because so long as they loved the flowers would thrive here.”
The voice and vision lingered when the twin brothers stepped forward. I could see their eyes, one had blue eyes, the other green. You could barely tell the difference unless you looked hard enough for it. I pointed to the one with blue eyes. “Harry said that the two of you were fight over who gets to stay behind with me. Since you two cannot decide I pick you. My I know your name?”
“Because out of everyone I know, you are the only person I trust with the knowledge this book contains.”
“I was hoping to get rid of some boredom and start doing some research about the curse that my family has, and since this is the Black ancestral home it would probably be the only pureblood library that houses the information.”
“She didn’t, but I read up on Veela when you handed me the book. It was so I would know what would happen. Just so you know, you and Harry might be mates, but that doesn’t mean you are bonded.”
I watched as they talked amongst themselves not listening to them when I felt the pull get stronger. I didn’t know why this was happening but I had a feeling that I had to do something.
I saw him hand the book to Hermione a week later. I was jealous that I heard him call her by her first name, and I briefly thought it was her that he liked. But, his answer to why he calls her by name floored me. I managed to answer, and ask about his loved one. I managed to convince him to tell me what it was like to fall in love. I will never forget what he said. “Hah… It was shocking once I realized I loved them. At first, I was jealous of what they had with friends then as I got older, I kept looking at them wondering when I could be the one to make them smile, to be the one who would make them want to try harder. I thought that it was a faze, something I would grow out of, but I never stopped hoping that I’d make them smile. I felt like I was going to die when I heard that my parents sided with Voldemort because I knew that meant that I would one to hurt them the most. Then I knew no matter what would happen I couldn’t tell them, because they live in the light and I- I am stuck in the dark. They mean the world to me, and as much as I want to tell them, I am not worthy of anything they give me.”
Harry held me in his arms whispering silently. “At the time I thought Fred was your bonded because when we asked you to pick someone to stay I thought you would have picked your intended to keep yourself safe. I was prepared to die that day because I thought that you would at least be safe with him. I doubt had I known I wouldn’t have gone into those woods that day.”
He hugged me hard after that and promised that even if he worked hard every day for the rest of his life, he would always find time to be by my side. Even though he had made that promise it still was hard on me to watch him run around, so I decided to join him. Harry hadn’t expected me to join him but once I did, he started to take more breaks and started spreading out how often he helped people. He didn’t wish for me to feel tired and he knew that I would follow him no matter what.
I left the large group of Gryffindor’s and walked into a corner of the room, and watched as they prepared. My heart was pounding, it wanted me to be with him coming up with ways to protect him, and have him by my side. I wanted to hear his voice more, hold his hand more, hear his heartbeat some more, finally give him a kiss, I wanted to spend the rest of my life by his side, I wanted him. It was as if the pull I had felt intensified so much that it was physically hard to move away. The farther I went from him the more I hurt and ached for him.
How could I not? I had to stop and think of what the best plan of action could be. After all I was a Slytherin and Slytherins think ahead.
It was during our last few days at Hogwarts that I got a shocking surprise. Harry and I were sitting by the lake having a wonderful picnic with each other. He was feeding me while I kept my head in his lap. I was enjoying one of our last dates at Hogwarts when I felt Harry squirm beneath my head. I sat up to look him in the eyes, “What’s wrong Harry?”
“Mr. Longbottom! This young man was missing for entire year! Even if he was a spy Dumbledore would’ve wanted him treated just like any student! I will not let you hurt him in any way!”
“Fred, it’s not really a pleasure meeting you, but it is nice to see you switched sides. Maybe the Malfoy’s aren’t really insane after all.”
“Very well.” They left me in the room alone and the pull of magic I felt earlier was duller then before. I put a hand to my stomach where the pull was and wondered what was going on with me.
“Potter, I will tell you this, if I, and they, are still alive after the bald maniac decides to try and start a war he can’t win then and only then will I tell the person that I love that I love them.
For a moment we were silent as the sadness of that comment sunk in to everyone. I couldn’t help but get close and hold his face in my hands. “For your unnecessary loss I am sorry, I hope that you can consider my mother as yours for the rest of your life.”
I was shocked by it but, I wanted to know more about this person he would love. I wanted to convince him to tell them before the war was over, but the stupid Dragon wouldn’t listen. He called me jealous and told me that both me and this person would have to wait. In truth I was a little jealous, and tried to get him to call me by name, but he through one complaint back at me. I left laughing that day wondering if I could get him to tell me about his person.
I knew then that my day was going to be a long one, as I sat in the library waiting for him to come and see me. When I did, I didn’t bother trying to tell him then. The day was rather long, but dinner was when it all started.
I ran to the house and saw them apperate to somewhere leaving me behind. I fell to the ground not feeling my legs and whispering the words of love. I felt pain radiate around me and didn’t know what to do, so I ran away towards the unknown and hid in a cave and waited for the pain to stop.
I was in the dark with no where to go. I hadn’t realized that I feared anything anymore, but I was wrong. In the dark, every turn had visions of death, which wouldn’t normally scare me except, they were all of Harry dying in front of me. I was terrified. The pain of breathing got worse, it got colder, and colors had all been drained from everything. I sat there wondering if everything was just a dream, that I hadn’t been saved, that I wasn’t a Veela, that Harry didn’t love me. With every thought it got darker and colder, and breathing was almost impossible.
The start of school lead to nothing climatic. We went to Hogwarts with anticipation and nothing bad happened, so it went by rather quickly and it was as if suddenly it was time for Christmas. It was just before winter break when I realized just how much of my Gryffindor my Harry really was. He tried in his own way to surprise me with a Christmas present. It started with the first week of December and a simple question. We were hanging out in the library together when Harry got my attention with a simple,
Even though it was winter some of the plants were still blooming, and Harry stopped me as we passed them. “Why do these plants still bloom even in winter?” was all he asked.
I froze. We had only been officially dating for a month now, it felt to sudden, to fast, but I knew he was serious. I looked at him and the ring that was being presented. On it I could see two different engravings, I couldn’t quite read them in the box, but I had seen this ring before in a picture of the Potter family before they had been killed on the hand of Lilly Potter, Harry’s mother. I was reminded of pureblood traditions that put this type of engagement as one of purest love. I wanted to cry tears of joy, but I kept them in as I had to answer him. I looked into those Emerald green eyes that had always enchanted me. I opened my mouth and spoke from my heart. “Yes, yes, yes!”
I felt like my adventure was just starting and without any clue as to what was going to happen to us next, we left the Black Manor. I was wondering where we were going to go next and if the curse on me will get any stronger or if I will die before I can tell Harry that he’s the one I was talking about. My world was changing and I wasn’t sure I was as ready as the golden trio was for this change.
I felt a warm spot forming on my shirt, I looked down to see him crying. "Why cry?" I whisper. "You tell me such a romantic story of your namesake, and include a connection to my Godfather who I lost because of that lunatic. You even put my hand to your heart. Why now? Why did you not start with holding my hand? Why wait till the end to put my hand on your heart? Why are you being cruel to me?"
She stopped and looked me in the eyes while saying, “You have to tell him the truth, sooner rather than later. He needs to know before you to bond for life.”
“Because he told me how he felt. If I were to tell him, I’d turn Veela and since he already accepted my love if he isn’t my mate I will leave him the moment I finish telling him how I feel.”
He picked up a fire poker and dug it into my skin sinking it in as I screamed. Thus, started the torture so cruel and horrible that I couldn’t even speak and my screams were beginning to hurt. Days of this lead to not remembering how I got there or when it was. I was barely even human anymore and yet he kept trying to steal me from myself, but no matter how much blood I was caked in or how long I was trapped I didn’t allow for my mind to be conquered by this monster who claimed to be a man.
I went to bed that night with dreams of a smiling Harry, and a really hard problem. I knew that one day I would have to convince Harry that this particular problem is one I cannot solve by myself, or rather don’t want to solve by myself, and ask for his assistance but I would never rush this. I couldn’t ever rush him into any of this Veela-ness. I just knew that a week into any relationship, especially ours, is not the time to discuss such things. I dealt with the hard problem by myself not really feeling satisfied, and I went to bed hoping that tomorrow I would feel better.
“That isn’t even half of the present. In the envelope is also the Malfoy family ring. Consider it your mark of being claimed by a Malfoy.”
“Cause, I am pretty sure she already knows, and she will be able to help calm down Ron and make points to the other Weasleys so that they would be able to understand it.”
I didn’t pay attention. He was alive, and walking, and breathing, and I wasn’t going to spend time that I knew I should with him wanting for the okay to see him. So, I ran. I ran to the girl’s room that I swore to never enter again. I saw him panting in front of one of the mirrors a smile on his face, and then I heard it. A voice so proud, happy and kind say something I didn’t actually ever believe was for me, “Harry Potter, it’s you. You’re the one I love.” I gasped as he turned around with horror in his eyes that started to get brighter the more I looked.
"My mate is the craziest, loveliest, most courageous, beautiful person in the world, and the most wonderful thing of all is the face he makes when he is jealous."
He left the library laughing. I smiled to myself as I wondered if I would ever be able to tell him or if the curse will kill me first. See what I hadn’t told Harry was something I would keep with me till I died or got a little too close to death. I read it out-loud after I was sure he was gone. “‘If the other person rejects them then they will die because Veela cannot handle rejection from any possible mate.’ How can I tell him I love him if he ever knew the truth?”
This time the kiss was swift and gentle. He looked me in the eyes before he spoke next. “What did I do to deserve someone like you to be mine?”
It ended like a spark, us kissing and holding hands and we moved into the ballroom. We were greeted by our friends and family. When we had said hello to everyone it was time for our dance and our song. I waited for it to come, but instead of from the spell filled with songs it came from my husband’s mouth.
I blushed unsure of how to respond. I gave a nod and opened the door leading him in. We got ready for bed and I slept with my arms around his waist and my head on his shoulder. There could never be a better way to start off my summer than this moment right here in his embrace.
I knew that once the battle would start it would feel more like a war, and I was ready. That day felt like hell. I could feel the people dying, I could hear the screams, I felt every spell Harry was hit with, and it hurt not being able to save him. Fred would stop me whenever I got close to the door, and I would get angry at him, but I knew I had to stay put. When we heard that man’s voice begging for Harry I froze. I knew that Harry would choose the route of sacrificing himself, so instead of rushing to the door I fell to my knees waiting for my death patiently.
“I say we start with Hermione, then go tell Ron, then the rest of Weasley clan, then we hit up my side with my mother, Blaise, and then Pansy.”
I recounted my story from the beginning telling them everything I could remember. It wasn’t anything good, but it was something. As soon as I finished I looked at the three of them in complete silence. I took this time to admire Harry. His green eyes were so bright and brilliant that no emerald would stand a chance against it in comparison. His hair, even though it was rugged, was a beautiful black that framed and curled around his face perfectly. I was jealous of his friends who could put a smile on the face of his. Harry’s voice broke my admiration.
Severus gathered his stuff and then headed over to talk to Narcissa, Harry watching all the while. He couldn’t catch what they were saying but it seemed important. He didn't have time to try reading their lips as both Remus and Sirius headed to the door, dragging him along.
Harry spoke for himself, “I, we, are unsure of ourselves. As LeFay I am worried he will refuse us once he knows the real us.”
!” Sirius yelled, amplifying his voice with his wand. Both men stopped and straightened, turning their attention to Lord Black.
LeFay had planned to try and go see Draco, but after what happened...He needed more answers before approaching Draco again. No matter how much his heart acked. Cadmael was currently being treated and LeFay was taking the chance he had now to go through the beastman’s memories while he was unconscious. What he found was enlightening, but also maddening. It would seem that Albus had indeed ‘saved’ Cadmael as a child, raising him as his own for a while before being forced to turn the child over. At least, that's what it seemed like from the memories, though Harry had a sneaking suspicion that not all was what it seemed.
“Look, Fred, even if I could get out of this room, my mate begged me to stay. I cannot leave this place until he tells me to. But right now, he must be planning to die, so I must sit here and wait. I cannot move.”
It did not matter to me, and it was short lived before the battle started up again. Then after the ruckus, there was only silence as I waited for Harry to come in and save the world, my world.
“I know. Hermione thanks for the shirt. I would have hated feinting in the library, and I wouldn’t have enjoyed waking up to his face covered in tears.”
They argued till the door to the room I was in opened and I saw two more people I have tormented. Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. Of course, Harry Potter had to save me from death’s door, or Fathers whip whichever comes first. Harry Potter the Boy Who Lived, who saved us all when he was just a baby, the boy who’s story I had heard a million times before I actually met him, and the boy who was so eye catching that I felt the feeling of falling in love. I was such an idiot though and loss any chance at being friends with him when I insulted his new friend.
I felt like purring at the nickname but held back for now. “I would like it to be a long engagement half a year minimum, a year max. We just started dating and even though we have known each other for years people still only see me as the Death Eater’s son; if we go to fast with this they will all think I put a spell on you or something. I know its not fair to you, but I don’t want you have to prove it to the world that you aren’t. Can we do that, for me please?”
After waking up, I had to wait a long time for my injures to heal before I was allowed out of the hospital wing. That had taken a week. Then I began helping with the reconstruction of Hogwarts, and that had taken another week. I had had enough. I walked around till I found the boy who had been plaguing my mind for weeks now. "Harry Potter."
It was one of my longest waits. I did not know how long it would take before I could not sit still anymore, but I knew he was alive. He had to be, after all I was still alive.
Harry had frozen at what I had said. He turned to look me in the eye and said, “I can hurt you by leaving you alone?”
We destroyed two of those stupid life lines and knew that there had to be more at Hogwarts, so we made are way there. When we got there Neville greeted us with a smile. He dragged me off to the side, “Harry, you won’t believe this but Draco Malfoy is on our side! He is probably in the girl’s room that Moaning Myrtle used to hang out in right now, but I wouldn’t- “
I walked away forcing each and every step away from him and the warmth that cascaded down my body whenever I was around him. I wanted to turn around run to him and wrap my arms and confess everything to him, but I couldn’t lose him I just couldn’t not when I wanted to be with him more and more.
“It was during the battle before the end when Voldemort called Harry out for a sacrifice to save the students of Hogwarts. I was with them when he entered the part closest to us. Voldemort had shot the killing curse at him and ordered me to check and see if he was dead. I froze, I had a feeling that he was the boy you had told me about for ages and I was worried that I losing him so soon after the curse took hold of you would kill you so I asked him if you were alive, he answered with a small nod of the head and I told the monster that he was dead even though he wasn’t. It was why they let me off with house arrest instead of Azkaban. Thank you again Harry for your written alibi for me it got me more freedom than my husband and now I can meet you and see my son.”
As much as I wanted to cheer for his success if I had tried that at the time I would have gotten close kissed his lips and spoken the truth to him. I mean I had gotten so close to revealing the truth that I had a great set up of just straight up telling him how I felt, but I couldn’t tell him because it would put everyone in danger including myself. I decided to tell him this, “I am glad that you did it. Here sit down and wait for me to brew you some tea that you can drink while we wait for the others.”
“Harry! Are you trying to get us all killed?!? He’s a death eater’s son and could very well be one himself! What if it was a trick for us to take him so that they’d have a spy? I mean, bloody hell, he could be just waiting to kill us!”
“If your mate were out there fighting you would do everything to save them. We can’t let an endangered species fight in war trying to protect someone with the risk of death on the line. The Veela community would have our heads if we let you fight.” Hermione answered.
“In time yes, but if I say it for all we know my mate could be in league with Voldemort and I’d be forced to join his side.”
“You know he hasn’t left your side since you fainted. He also didn’t go to sleep until recently. I don’t think I can stall him much longer; besides you will die if this keeps up Draco. If you die not telling him how you feel he won’t be able to recover, you should tell him.”
When the kissing stopped my mother showed us to our rooms (right next to each other) and we started an early dinner. During the fabulous dinner I finally asked the question that has been bugging me since Harry told me. “Mama, I heard you saved Harrys life could you explain to me how?”
I awoke the next day ready for the day ahead. It was a chilly morning that had me wishing I had Harry to snuggle with. I imagined waking up to those bright green eyes staring at me, his dark hair threaded in my hands, as I moved the blanket away and wrapped my arms around his waist bringing him close enough to kiss those beautifully pink lips of his over and over again. I didn’t realize that I was dreaming until my alarm went off. I was troubled again by my hard problem, but I took a cold shower and felt a little bit better, but still I was unsatisfied. I had a feeling that many more days where going to start with such a feeling at least for a while. I got dressed and made my way down to the Great Hall.
“You shouldn’t try to sit up, your wounds might reopen.” A girl with brown curly hair was speaking and I knew who she was even though she had mellowed down the curls. Hermione Granger. She was a very nice girl that threw a great punch that I can still remember. I have never been able to tell this girl that she is much too good for Hogwarts and probably would have done better in a different school. I felt guilty for all the pain I caused her to suffer, but I couldn’t change that now.
It was now the week leading to Christmas and I had found the perfect gift for Harry. I was getting excited as the days ticked on by. There were many days without much to do so I gave Harry an official tour of the house. As we walked, I showed him my favorite place, the garden.
I was being pulled away from the front door and towards the dungeon that hadn’t been used in years. This man was Voldemort someone I had only ever heard of how ruthless he could be. I knew I couldn’t be reckless or I would die. I watched as both my wrists were chained to the wall without me trying to scream, and all the while he watched me. He finally smirked at me when my eyes met his.
“I know that Draco, but I fear the people will try to tear us apart and I know I can’t spend a day without seeing you in it.” He sat me against the tree pulled my hands to his lips and kissed them. He put up one knee pulled out of box and moved it closer to me. “Since I can’t spend a day without you in it, I figured I’d make you mine forever to the public. Draco, will you marry me and be mine forever?”
“He did?” I looked at Harry and saw the innocent look on his face. He was playing a game with me. I smirked as I thought. Well two can play at this game. After my name had been cleared shortly after the battle, and I had begun to help rebuild Hogwarts; most people thought that I had became friends with Harry and I took advantage of that thought to casually pull him to my side and then hold him there by his waist. I spoke only loud enough for Harry and Hermione to hear me. “Harry here is my mate.”
“Because you forget one crucial thing about me, I’m a Slytherin which means I am cunning and that I have a reason for everything. Maybe I want you to spend the rest of this time thinking about me to such a degree that you can’t consider death as an option. You won’t know why until I let you, so enjoy the time trying to seduce me Harry because you never know what happens.”
Though I didn’t feel that overwhelming feeling of darkness anymore I did learn why I was having that hard problem, and it was not something that I was aware of until this day of darkness. It gave me much to think about and I had to consider how Harry would take the news. I just hoped I would never have one of these dark days ever again.
