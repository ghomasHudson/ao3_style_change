" Harry dear, please talk to me. Tell me were it hurts?" Narcissa said as calm as he could.
"You didn't know? I thought the rumor would have spread fast" Harry said tilting his head. "We found it in our second year, Ron and me went to save Ginny. Your father put a cursed diary in her schools supplies and it was draining her soul and controlling her, she technically was the one that opened the chamber and caused the attacks."
"We needed to wait for you both to reach certain maturity in your magical core, we mostly stayed on the sidelines. We didn't want to interfere with your lives."
His relationship with his two youngest has always been the most strained one of all of his children. Even when they were toddlers neither of them seemed to create a bond with him. They stuck more to their mother and barely tolerated him at best. He didn't really have any emotional bond with them either, so he just stayed on the sidelines.
Even Narcissa and Lucius knew that they had not been helpful. Lucius with the diary, he doesn't know what it did or what it caused but he knows it was dangerous for Harry and the young Weasley girl. Narcissa now realizes how the little stories that Draco told them about the school, even though they were vague, they could let her see how Harry didn't seem to have self preservation. It was as if he thought no one would care if he died.
"Not everything, just as much as the other know. It's too dangerous to put that information in a letter, it could be intercepted by the wrong people." He didn't feel comfortable hiding this from them and he trusts them to keep their mouths shut, but it's not just his secret after all. Harry has no reason to trust his friends. Harry's smile helped him relax.
"I think you just lost our bet dear Severus" Lucius smirked.
i hope you like this chapter ^^
"They got me out of there, I don't have to go back to my relatives house again." Fred and George's eyes widened comically to then look at each other having a silent conversation.
"Our people believed it's a sign of the end," there was a tense pause, "We were warned that one day another species would make the same mistake we did and would suffer a worse outcome...they say they would be here to watch the downfall."
"Hi" Harry said after a few minutes of silence turning to look at Draco.
"What is that and how can it be dangerous?"
"If you say so little bird" Draco said. He remembered what they had come in for in the first place and turned to the twins "can I ask you a favor?"
"Vernon! .... That monster is in his room" her voice was loaded with such disdain that it surprised Draco a little. He could not believe that these were the people with whom Potter lived, he already wanted to kill them and he hasn't known them for more than 10 minutes.
Narcissa couldn't resist anymore, she pulled Harry into her arms like that would protect him from the outside world (in her motherly opinion it would). She rearranged him in her lap, leaving his head on her shoulder.
"You two look very odd" he said offhandedly.
"Quirrell in first year with the whole having Voldemort in the back of his head. I'm not sure if he wanted to harm me or kill me but my guess is he wasn't planning very good things for me. Lockheart tried to obliviate me. Remus accidentally went a little werewolf on me, but it wasn't your fault, Hermione and I shouldn't have been in the forest in the first place. Crouch or Moody with the unforgivables and he did try to kill me after the tournament." He said all this like it was the most normal thing in the world. The others were horrified.
By their third year he figured out the reasons he just couldn't leave Potter alone. He had a giant crush on the guy which is one of the stupidest things to ever happen to him. Potter is one of the only people Draco couldn't stand and yet that didn't stop him from dreaming about him every night. At first he refused to accept this, he blamed it on hormones and proceeded to date every wizard with black hair and light color eyes (not obvious at all) to convince himself it was nothing. Of course denial can only work so much. For the Yule ball he knew he was fucked, he had never felt so much hatred and pure rage before seeing Potter dance with one of the Patil twins. Even though the other boy was clearly uncomfortable something just snapped inside of Draco. If he hadn't had Blaise and Pansy he might have cursed the girl into hell for touching Potter.
Luna went to Harry whispering very softly in his ear so no one else could hear her "it will be fine, once you follow your instincts everything will come back." She gave him a peck on the cheek and bid the others goodbye with the twins since they could use the floo from their apartment.
"But that is very dangerous for such a cute boy." The guy at the counter, who looked around the age of 19 with black hair and blue eyes, was clearly looking at Harry in an inappropriate light. "A cute kitty would look much better, don't you think pretty boy?
"Mostly? So you did interfere before."
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry decided not to try his luck at the moment and took the potions without complaining. He tried not to pull a face, but didn't quite manage to hide his disgust. Dinner was quiet for the most part. Draco and Harry began to talk lively about quidditch and other trivial things, while the adults kept their distance. They didn't want to disturb the small bubble of peace that had been created, but all good things had to end eventually.
"Can I tell them?" He looked at the adults. He didn't want to impose anything, no matter how much he trusted the twins they didn't have the obligation to trust them too.
"Tell me a little about it." Running her fingers through his hair, quite happy that he didn't feel as tense in her arms anymore.
"You know all dignified and Malfoy I guess?" tilting his head trying to think of how to explain properly.
"For the love of Merlin woman, stop screaming." he sneered "Petunia, I should have guessed that you would have the bad judgement of marrying this whale. Now since we don't want to be here any longer than necessary, show us where Potter is and be done with this.
"Mr. Malfoy, as you may have noticed, you have forced your inheritance out. This means that you are also able to take your lordship if you wish to do so. If this is what you would like to do, inform me as soon as possible" the goblin leaves them in the room.
"Some would say an emotional connection."
"Pansy you are going to kill him" Blaise said and she instantly took a step back.
"You would be lucky! But who in their right mind would want to be with a slimy Slytherin like you" looking at Draco completely. Draco only raised an eyebrow, he knew there was absolutely nothing the other could say about his appearance as conceited as that sounded. "You worthless bloody ferret."
"It's a spell similar to what you call a glamour but this will make them go inside your skin. It doesn't hurt per se but it will be uncomfortable if used for an extended period of time. Do you want to try?" Kaly said kindly and got closer when the other nodded. The rest were still watching their every move like a hawk, it didn't bother her, after all they were strangers. "Repeat
"I sincerely couldn't care less what your opinion is. But we have more important things to do than wasting our time with you, goodbye." Draco squeezed his hand as a sign of support. Harry was proud that his voice didn't shake.
"Oh really, it's today? You are the only person I know that would be this happy of going back to writing essays." Draco smiles, it was a little endearing how happy he is about this.
In a matter of seconds the image of Draco on the ground had changed leaving in his place a huge tiger. Their heads barely reached the joint of the animal's shoulder, the fur was pitch black with blood red lines all over it. The creature got up and gave a loud growl causing them all to retreat feeling in danger.
"It was not a threat ..." Harry spoke, his eyes were red for crying and he was still holding Draco with all his strength. "He was asking me permission to get closer..."
They all kept reflecting on their own guilt for hours until late into the night. They did not talk to each other. They all understood that this was something they had to weigh what they did and did not do by themselves.
"I don't want to intrude, but would you want to talk about it?" Narcissa asked politely.
"Well, you never show any interest in our candidates to marry son, and you've been talking about him unceasingly since you were six. I think that more than agreeing with the situation, it's more that neither of us is really surprised about it" Said his father smiling, he loved to surprise his son.
It took a while before Harry felt a little more himself. He was still shaking, but he had stopped sobbing at the very least.
"What?!" The three adults say at the same time and he vaguely explains the situation.
"I'm looking forward to that." He really was, even if for the last five years he has ignored all the Slytherins except Draco. He is interested to know more of them.
"Yes, he had lunch with us it was very nice." Harry smiled but then briefly adverted his eyes. "We also ran into Ron and Ginny, that was a little less pleasant."
"And we gave our lives to save him? Look at how pathetic he is. He couldn't even defend himself from a bunch of muggles" James Potter said in a disgusted voice. Harry took a couple of step back startled, bumping into something behind him. He turned around immediately and looked at the familiar cemetery now surrounding him. Cedric's angry ghostly face was staring straight at him.
Once they entered the store they quickly went to the back, Fred and George gave Harry a key after his last visit. The twins were concentrating on a spell on a bright blue cape but stopped immediately at their arrival and jumped to hug them tightly.
"I understand" he raised his arms in surrender. He didn't feel bad about the threat, he was sure that Blaise and Pansy would do the same if they were in their situation.
The taller one was just behind, she had a waist length wavy auburn hair with chestnut color eyes. She looked completely bored and had this cold and unapproachable aura about her. She was wearing a floor length navy blue skirt fitted at the waist with a flowing white blouse.
Harry just sighed fondly and put breakfast on the table trying to sit down.
"Okay love if you're sure of this, he will be part of the custody options." He didn't look completely convinced with the idea but he knew it was useless to discuss this.
They found Narcissa and Lucius outside of the robe shop talking with someone he recognized right away as Mr. Weasley. He almost bolted out of there again but remembered the twins telling him Mr. Weasley was genuinely concerned for him when he disappeared. He felt good about his decision when Mr. Weasley actually saw him and he could physically see the weight lifted from the man's shoulders.
"How could they do this? He's only 15 years old ... I don't even want to think about what they did all these years." His wolf wanted to dismember all those who dared to harm his cub, he was having a lot of trouble holding Moony back.
"Thing are just not working anymore" he sighs and gives them a sad smile. "We fight all the time and I don't believe it is salvageable any longer."
They were shopping for around three hours, going to all the stores they could. In the end Harry and Remus were perfectly dressed and had many new clothes. They purchased everyday items to formal robes, even pajamas and underwear ended up added to the list. Harry was now dressed in black skinny jeans, a green t-shirt, and a jean jacket. It was all a little loose, but if Severus and Narcissa's treatment turns out as expected he should fill them out soon enough. Remus had simple black pants, a white button-down shirt, and a blue cardigan that now fit him perfectly.
"I told you she was not serious" Blaise's smooth baritone voice came from the front of a bookstore.
"Good morning, how ..." George started.
Harry looks for James's voice. As soon as he finds his father, he smiles and starts making grabby hands for James to cuddle him. Both parents had the softest smile on their faces when James got up and took Harry in his arms snuggling him in his chest. Lucius and Narcissa laughed a little at the nostalgic scene, being more familiar with it thanks to Draco.
Molly started to be more overbearing and critical of all of their children. Bill had to endure the constant criticism about his appearance since he was old enough to chose his own clothes. He barely talks to them anymore. Arthur isn't sure if Bill will ever again after the horrid way Molly reacted to his engagement.
"I prefer to talk, I don't want to think about this again if I can avoid it." He was going to move, but Narcissa fixed his position in her lap. "What else do you want to know?"
"There is no creature blood in the Malfoy line or the Black line, how is this possible?" Well that was not completely true, his family did have some Veela blood somewhere in their line, but this was certainly not a Veela.
"So, if I can handle the lordship thing, I won't have to go back there?" A little skeptical, it sounded too easy.
"A little?" he responded unsure. "I believe I did passable in most but I most likely failed history of magic and divination miserably."
"Who are you? This is not your problem go away" Ron tried to push him but Draco caught his arm before he could.
Despite the time there was a considerable amount of people in the alleys and at the bank. Fortunately no one seemed to be paying attention to them. They went straight to the main desk, the goblin looked at them as he left his glasses on the desk and before Lucius could speak Harry stepped forward smiling brightly at the goblin.
"Lucius he is just a child, he is even younger than our Draco, he cannot be the champion of the light" Narcissa said indignantly that someone would put a child in a situation like this, her heart ached at the idea.
He saw some pieces of a rather lonely childhood, the day Harwind presented as a submissive at fifteen years old disappointing his father that expected him to be a dominant he could train for war, his little brother being born and his determination to raise him himself and show him all the love he never received. More and more flashes came to mind but it didn't stay long enough for him to grasp everything and leaving him with a headache.
"It depends on the week. They normally fed me three times a week. They gave me the leftovers and a little bit of bread. I usually got water while watering plants or cleaning the dishes, that was fine... if it was a bad week, well I just didn't eat."
"Overrated."
"Congratulation you know a big word" Draco said uncaring of whatever insult the other could throw at him. Ron got closer like he was getting ready to punch Draco.
"Mother has been pushing for me to get betrothed soon. She still holds the concept that I'm straight" Pansy answered before her expression turned somber. "Father hasn't been home all summer."
"Don't you think Draco is acting strange with him?" The attitude of his nephew baffles him. Severus knows that Draco has a good heart under the facade that he presents to the public, but he could not say that he saw him as someone gentle so to speak.
"That is what our stories believed, they said you would have the answers. The mated pair that our kind slaughtered were said to bring the solution before they died." The silence stretched again, it was well into the night now and the exhaustion of the day was catching up to all of them.
"Harry breath with me, everything is fine, we are not judging you I promise. Even Severus doesn't, and you know how much he loves to judge people." Harry laughed a little at that even though he couldn't breath properly yet. Severus glared at Remus although he preferred not to say anything. "For your last question, you were in his lap because every time he moved out of bed you clung to him in your sleep and you sounded a little distressed. So he preferred to stay with you."
"you gave us our start-up loan, we haven't forgotten."
"Well, young man, your eyesight was really damaged. It was almost irreversible, and those glasses were the wrong prescription for you," said the doctor, returning Harry's glasses. "When was your last check up?"
"It really was a pleasure Arthur, I hope we see you soon" Narcissa said.
"When we felt the change they sent us to find both of you. It was a difficult process trying to stay hidden during the war time but when we heard of the-boy-who-lived we knew it just had to be one of the babies we were looking for," she looked at Draco, "you where harder to track down. It took us a couple of years, if not for a brief article in the paper about your family we wouldn't have been able to find you until he went to Hogwarts."
He gave them a genuine smile and the image of the room disappeared. Griphook silently asked for the papers for Remus and Harry to sign later and waited for them to tell him to continue. They were in a tense silence for a couple of minutes. They let Remus and Harry grieve for a little while and process the information.
He apparated in the house just in time, not two minutes after he arrived Lupin and Harry got back carrying their own weight in food.
"Thank you for the compliment" Narcissa laughs.
"Like you were actually going to stab me," Draco rolled his eyes.
"I was a delight to live with!" Draco feigning hurt, it was most definitely a lie.
"Can anyone explain what just happened? What the hell is that thing?" Lucius asks, baffled by all this.
"Aunt Petunia usually hit me in the head with the frying pan or she made me put my hand on the hot oil... my uncle, well he normally used his belt, or the cane, depending on what I did... if I did accidental magic, it was worse then. He would hit me or choke me until I lost consciousness. Then he locked me in my cupboard for a week or two. Aunt Petunia usually gave me a glass of water every four days more or less... I guess she didn't want me dead or something." He shrugged with that. He never really understood why she didn't just let him die. It would have been better than that life. "I guess that's all. Dudley is just a spoiled brat that likes to make life harder for me. He mostly just made me do his homework and beat me up as often as he could. He also made sure I couldn't have any friends at school by threatening them. Dudley always punched me when they played Harry hunting."
I'm very iffy about this chapter I had it done like two weeks ago, but my computer decided to die at the worst moment possible. It finally worked again but I lost everything I had already wrote :(
Later that night with Harry wrapped around him, almost completely asleep, he carded his fingers through the silky ink hair.
"Prat" he giggled and kissed him again. Draco was more than happy to comply.
"That creature is our Dragon, dear" Narcissa said in disbelief.
They couldn't stop to think about it much because Remus was already walking to the door after it was deemed safe and knocked before they could catch him.
"Alright, we will be as cordial as possible as well. Are the rumors of the golden boy true?" Pansy asked.
"You called me ... Harry?" He was very confused by what was happening. He really didn't know how to process all this.
"Dragon, is it really you?" Narcissa asked, the creature only looked at them before nodding, confirming that they were not a danger to him or Harry. "Is there any way you can come back to yourself dear? You are a little too big for this room now."
"How can you be this much of a moron, that was obviously sarcasm" Draco said astonished at the redhead. "Believe me I would prefer death over being near the abhorrent smell of her perfume again." Ginny glared, it appears that she settled for offended. Ron got even angrier.
"Well dear brother of mine, what do you say?"
The walls seems to be closing in, his vision is blurry from the tears. He can't even see their faces anymore, he has to just stand there and listen. Soon enough he curls up in a tiny space that he could barely fit into, incapable of breathing while Voldemort started to laugh. All the while the dead keep screaming his failures.
"Why don't you both accompany us to lunch. Unless you are busy with your store?" Narcissa said.
"Yes, all submissive can bear children, doesn't matter if is a Male or female although is very difficult for a male to get pregnant without a mate" Kaly said chuckling at his reaction.
"My mother is currently in Italy with her soon to be eighth husband. Fortunately she did not force me to meet him this time" Blaise said. "Theo is staying with me again this summer, his father seems to be even crazier this time."
"Well, Draco smelt a little like peppermint, apples, and the essence of the air right before a storm. It's a unique combination actually." His wolf settled down by being next to her. Calm enough at least to not fear harming anyone. "And Harry smells like sugar with a hint of lilies and something more earthy. I don't know about Snape or Lucius."
As if he had summoned, them both men entered the room. His uncle rolled his eyes when he saw the position he was in, but began to leave the different potions for Harry on the desk without saying anything about it.
"Oh right, the will. I guess the next thing to do will be to divide our things."
"Then can I do it?" Harry asked, blushing when Draco helped him get up to sit him back in his lap.
"Is shopping always this tiring?" asked Harry.
"Yes, I remember them being a couple since I entered Hogwarts. It's sad but I suppose these things happen" Narcissa said sadly. "I'm just glad they can divorce, it would be unfortunate if they were bonded like Lucius and I."
Harry give himself the time to really look at Malfoy. He didn't expect that answer, or more like he didn't expect to see so much sincerity on every word. He had originally thought it was out of pity for his current state. But he didn't see any pity or judgement in Malfoy's eyes, he could see some nervousness, expectation and a lot of fear of being rejected again. He looks different that his usual posh and cold mask that he uses at almost every turn. Now he looks more human, more approachable. He had forgiven the insults and hexes a long time ago because he always thought that he defended himself, so they were always even in his mind. Malfoy has always been an enigma to him, he is someone he always tried to ignore but never really succeeded at it. He always ended up thinking about him in some way or ended up watching him. Harry was always aware of him no matter his situation. He has watched him from afar so much that even he could have glimpsed little vestiges of his true personality, with sincere smiles or moments where he could not contain his joy. There were not many, but he knows they exist. The more he saw these little glimpses the more he wanted to get to know him. Along the way he may have fallen for him a little. Only someone blind could not see that the boy was beautiful, tall with a good amount muscle. His hair was always perfect and it looked so soft and matched perfectly with his gray eyes that in some light look silver. He really wanted to know him better since the third year, but he never thought he would have the chance. The guy hated him after he rejected his hand in friendship first year. He didn't really regret denying him because Malfoy had been terrible at the time, but he regretted never trying to fix it. Now he could fix it and get to know him. He decided to extend his hand this time.
"Now don't be a couple of babies, it wasn't too bad," Draco laughed at the tired expression. "You two just needed to try on the clothes. It's not that tiring."
"Just remember to tell people where you got it." Before he could protest again they were both pushed out of the room with the instruction of looking around.
In an instant the name came to him, bringing everything back in a rush almost making him dizzy at the fast flow of memories that were clearing his mind and forcing the more animalistic instincts to stay in the back of his mind where they belonged.
"Dragon come, it's time for lunch" his mother calls him from the door. Remus was actually the only one who knew how to cook a little. He made all the meals for everyone, his mother began to learn although he thinks it's just to spend time with the werewolf.
"Oh god, what is happening to him?" Remus said distressed.
"I really love cooking, if it doesn't bother you, I wish I could do it here too ..." he ask shyly.
Draco paid without any issue, it was actually a lot cheaper than he expected. He is pretty sure Harry would complain if he were to know the price of the gift, thankfully basic social norm assured he will never know. "What is the warning it gives?"
"Wow" was Harry's very eloquent response.
"I would say we have but for how many?"
"Our species made a big mistake... we tried to break the most sacred thing magic gave us. We didn't care about the consequences and that was our downfall" Adris said with remorse.
"They punished me if I did something wrong... or if what I did didn't meet their criteria." He curled up a little tighter.
"For our son Harry, we would like him to have everything that my family can offer, the titles, the properties and everything else. There is a special vault that is in Lily's name, I think you want to see what we keep there ..." James and Lily sigh looking at the baby in her arms. He looked so calm and happy, without understanding the evil of the world "the moment we knew you existed you became everything for us, we are sorry if we are not there to see you grow up. I hope you know that you are the best thing that happened to us. We are proud of you in every decision you make in the future, as long as you are happy we will be too."
"Hahahaha, I think you should try Draco, Harry doesn't hold grudges. If you give him a sincere apology, he will forgive you immediately" Remus said. That is true, Harry does not seems capable to hold grudges if the person apologizes. But in this particular case it will help that he has been equally obsessed with Draco since first year.
"To all or friends, thank you for being here with us and having been part of our little family. We love all of you and we will wait for you all in the veil."
"Oh yes, because it's so easy to do a potion with someone breathing down your neck and half of the class throwing things in your cauldron" he looked pointedly at Severus and Draco.
"Are you nervous for your results Harry?" Narcissa asked.
"I believed it was safer for Harry to be here than in a hotel in muggle London," Remus added.
"Oh, I forgot we were doing this again" James laughs and looks at them again while Lily took Harry to sing a lullaby.
"Do you have no decency?" his godfather glared at him. He was always cranky in the mornings.
"Where did that come from?" asks a dumbfounded Lily, she was happy but didn't understand when the change happened.
"What did you two bet on now?"  asked Narcissa amused.
"Harry!" Draco saw that the ice in the room began to cover Harry's body. He tried to approach but an invisible force did not let any of them get close to him.
He doesn't understand what happened with Ron if he is honest. He used to be a sweet child, a little too quick to anger but he was loyal. This last year he changed so much he almost can't recognize his son anymore. He couldn't believe he would leave his best friends like he did and not be even a little bit concerned when Harry disappeared, that he could honestly believe the slander he was saying to someone he used to care for so much. Ginny just worries him. She used be so shy and simple, she preferred to be by herself and now out of nowhere she seems to have changed and he is not sure it's for the best. She stopped caring about everyone else and just does whatever she wishes no matter if it hurts others or if it's dangerous.
"HARRY!" they said at unison before throwing themselves at him for a hug, they ended up on the ground in a little pile "Happy birthday!"
"So there was a dragon, I was right!" Draco said narrowing his eyes at Harry who looked at him sheepishly.
"That was technically accidental magic, and he just wanted to go home. It seemed reasonable at the time..."
"I don't really know why he's doing it, but at least I'm pretty comfortable this way." At that moment he started running his fingers through Harry's hair again, causing the boy to literally start purring. Draco looked at the boy who now had his head buried in his chest as he gripped his shirt tightly and smiled softly.
"We would like Sirius Black and Remus Lupin to take care of Harry, and if for some reason they are not capable of this, we prefer Frank and Alicia Longbottom." When Harry heard the voices of his parents he automatically began to shake and tightened his grip on Draco's hand. The little amount of times he got to hear their voices before it wasn't in the best of circumstances.
"You went where you knew there was a basilisk with the most incompetent human being possible" Neville said.
"Son, I think you should get out of there, I don't think Harry is going to be very welcoming to you when he is more aware of his surroundings"  his father told him.
"But whyyyyy" Draco whined just to annoy him more. "I'm not doing anything inappropriate... yet," saying the last part under his breath. By the scowl on his godfather's face he heard him anyway.
"How is that you are here?"
"She does not like that Fleur is part veela. She is convinced that she is using her allure on him," Fred rolls his eyes "as if Bill were that incompetent as a curse breaker to not realize if she was doing it."
"Maybe, but it doesn't really matter. It was just another reason for Bill to cut contact with mom." George shrugged, they decided to order the food and change the subject for the moment.
The Order sent them to a house in a tiny muggle town south of Scotland. They were sent with his Uncle Sev and Lupin, which was surprising. His mother told him that it was because after Black's death Lupin's mental state got extremely bad losing one of the last members of his pack. The death hit Lupin hard. Severus was not pleased with this, but his mother seemed to adore the werewolf and no one dared to say no to her if you wanted to have a pleasant life.
"We will be back soon, we want to buy a couple of potion ingredients," said George and they took Draco without explaining more.
"Does anyone else know about this?" Narcissa was not satisfied with that answer, but it was the best Harry could give them.
"Harry, did you not realize that guy was trying to flirt with you?" Remus asks.
"Thank God you did. I don't have the patience to raise two children yet" instinctively putting a hand on her stomach with a tiny smile of longing and a bit of sadness.
"It's okay, it was a long time coming" he looked sad but resigned to this outcome.
"Well I do not see why not." She gave another quick check up before allowing him to get up. "Come on dear, it is almost time for lunch."
"I'm sorry." Harry looks at the room that was completely destroyed and still covered with ice "I didn't know this could happen."
"I actually wanted to ask them to send a letter for me..." They started to go in the direction of the store, it was still crowded in the streets just mildly less frantic. "I promised Pansy and Blaise I would contact them before the term started."
"We will go as well, dad needs me in the mornings " Luna said smiling and looking to be the only one that was calm and even happy with the turn of events, a stark contrast to Neville who looked white as a ghost.
Harry was surprised by his new position. He couldn't remember ever being held like this. Harry assumed his parents maybe did it, but he can't really remember them. Her warm was making him drowsy, and he felt the strange urge to cry. He didn't know why her comfort would have this effect on him, but tears started to fall uncontrollably.
"School isn't really our thing. Can't say we learn much from it." Fred shrugged after answering while clinging to Harry.
"Wow, how were you..."
The next couple of days passed by without any problems, all of them easing into a routine. Draco and Harry ended up sharing a bed every night to avoid the nightmares, it actually worked most of the time.
"Yes, we decided to at least be cordial with each other friends as much as possible." He wanted to say Gryffindor is not that bad, but Harry did have the tendency of run into danger constantly.
Percy has had severe anxiety, since he started school he regularly had panic attacks. He obsessed over every little thing that he had done wrong real of not, and now it look likes he left the family completely. Percy doesn't answer letters from any of them, even when Arthur tried to visit him at his work he was turned away.
"We will be around if you need us, don't worry." Patting his head, " you can send us letters with all your questions. Your owl will know how to find us she is rather resourceful. She found us quite a bit during our stay in the woods."
Harry was cooking what smelled like pancakes. He could also smell fresh tea and coffee, it made his mouth water. Draco sat at the table as quietly as possible. Harry didn't seem to notice him while humming some Muggle song and moving comfortably around a kitchen. Suddenly Harry put a plate of pancakes and a cup of tea in front of him.
Narcissa followed him out completely aware that she should stay inside in case Remus's wolf, Moony, decided to attack. But the werewolf needed someone now and she wouldn't abandon him.
"I believe the Slytherins were the only ones that didn't get her lovely treatment" Harry looked angry. "Who was I supposed to report this to? McGonagall just told me to keep my head down and my temper under control, Dumbledore didn't even look at me the whole year, and even if he did he couldn't do anything about it! And can you really tell me you would have believed me if I came to you sir!?"
i hope you like this chapter any feedback is greatly appreciated. This is definitely not going as I originally thought it would but oh well, I'm enjoying writing it ^^
"Draco?" He said once he was able to regain some resemblance of control of his mind and body.
"Where is he!?" Draco said worried.
Everyone was in shock, more the ones that were there when Draco transformed. At least now they would have an answer for that, but it was obvious that most of them were still very on edge by this whole situation and it was very difficult to be patient to get the answers.
"Remus dear, please come here." After a little while she found him under one of the trees, crouching down to meet his eyes and softly pulling him to her shoulder "there you are dear"
"I found her in the library that night and I asked her if she was worried about James. I just couldn't fathom how she was okay with him being an auror." She always had been overprotective and over indulgent with James, so much so that James was sure that his mother was going to cry and scream at him for hours no to do it. No other reaction made sense. "She just smiled at me and said that she can't stop James. If this is the path he chose in life, the only thing she could do was make sure he knew he is loved and has her support every step of the way while he is still healthy and alive in her home."
"Easier said than done, believe me" he rolled his eyes. He enjoyed the smile Harry had now that Remus would come back to Hogwarts.
"Of course if Lucius says so you will  believe him. Are you reliving one of your childhood crushes? Yes, Sirius told me about your little crush in our first year." She teased him laughing at his slightly red cheeks." I think you have a thing for Slytherin love, I mean you did date Reggie for two years, and before that you had this massive crush on Lucius."
"I don't remember sir," he put on his glasses to try "wow, it really was bad."
"Don't worry, I'll get it." He was surprised at the price, but he wasn't leaving Atreya there. "Can you also add the things I need to take care of her properly please?
"I would also like to add Severus Snape as a third option" said Lily surprising everyone.
Draco hugged him as tightly as he could, the pain of seeing him die was too fresh, the screams of agony still present in his mind. Harry keeps saying comforting words in his ear while letting him bawl his eyes out for as long as he needed to, he wasn't sure how much of what he saw was real. His memories were fuzzy and difficult to figure out between old and new, it was giving him a migraine.
"If you got him out of there, it's enough to be good in our book" George said
"I'm a Kiritari" Adris talks looking mostly at Draco and Harry since they were the ones that actually need the information "a dark creature."
"more than both"
"We could ask him tomorrow morning, now you need to sleep you look horrible." He smiled at the weak glared he received.
Dumbledore was surprised and unsure. He didn't want more dark wizards in the school, but it was a good plan of action and he could keep an eye in them a lot better there. Following this tiny request could get him into Harry's good graces again. "You make an excellent point Harry, I shall speak to them about this immediately. Can you please send them up here?" Harry ran downstairs excited.
He didn't pay much attention and went down to make breakfast, he didn't expect to see all the others already at the table with a table full of Harry's favorite things.
"Either category is innate in you, and they had their own idiosyncrasies. For example, I'm a submissive, that will make me weaker physically speaking and smaller than my mate. I will also be the one carrying children if we decided to have them, things like that" Kaly said. "Adris is a dominant, so she of course is supposed to protect me since she is stronger physically and will tend to be more territorial with me."
"It took longer than I expected but congratulations." Lucius said sending a look to his son, he fully expected him to start the proper courting soon.
"From what I know they couldn't have a traditional bonding ceremony because neither of their families approved of the match between them. They were both official betrothed to other people at the time. They eloped once Molly found out she was pregnant" Remus said offhandedly and received incredulous look from everyone. "Sirius told me after he got drunk once. Apparently his mother still had some contact, or at least kept an eye on Arthur's mother, and found out about this even though they covered up the scandal at the time."
"Harry dear please, we need you to control your magic!" Narcissa screams desperately trying to reach him somehow.
They finished their meal and started to look around. The regular stores didn't offer anything worthy, they had been to most stores here and knew their way around dark or cursed objects better than they probably should at their age. But after hours of searching it seemed that none of their usual stores had anything remotely appealing.
"What did they made you do for them?"
"Well, I guess I have to do one of these things, even if it's useless because I'm not going to die any time soon. I guess it's not a bad idea to do it in case Moony finally snaps and kills me for stealing his chocolate."  He smiles at them while Remus rolls his eyes affectionately. "I want to leave Prongs and Lily the property that the Blacks have in Russia. I know that Lily is dying to visit and I think your little fawn will like the cold if the sudden craving Lily has for ice cream is something to go by. For Moony, I want you to have the house in the north of England. I know you will love it, it is simple but it is perfect for you. I also want it to have 5 million galleons, shut up you deserve it and you are not rejecting it. I can almost hear you being all humble saying that it was not necessary. I know the ministry has been even worse for you in the last year and I hope this helps you a bit while you settle down to find the job you love. Maybe you could start your own store. You always loved the idea of having a bookstore.
"Are you planning to stay here?" he asks after a while of cleaning and some mindless chatter.
"How I didn't see the signs, I was browsing through my memory and they are there ... there are not many, and he does not match with other child abuse profiles that I have seen before. But they are there! What if he is not the only one I missed?!"
"Your point?" Draco raised an eyebrow while Harry rolled his eyes.
"Wouldn't it be more comfortable to sleep with them out then?"
"Goodbye, have a safe trip please." Accompanying them into the garden for them to make their way to the woods.
"I bet"
"He has always been a special child. Maybe that is why he does not completely coincide with others, or the situation he is in has forced him to hide the signs better than most" it was the only thing he could think off, he really doesn't know much about what to look for in general with these cases, much less with a rare case.
"Mother please" he hid his face in his hands while Harry laughed.
"How did it go?" Remus asked, confused by the happy expression Harry had.
"You wake up at 5 in the morning, who does that on purpose?" Crossing his arms because really why would you do that to yourself.
"Yes that one. Well that was my room until I got my letter to Hogwarts. Then they moved me to the room upstairs, I think they got scared thinking that maybe someone was watching them. "
(See the end of the chapter for
"Great, the werewolf will be teaching again" Snape scowled.
"Well to be more specific is the way your magic smells. Thanks to my condition if I spend a lot of time with people I can smell their magic." He left out that technically he could only do that with people his wolf recognized as members of the pack, but they didn't need to know that. "Magic is directly related to emotions and generally changes certain things to show the emotional state of the person. Yours just changed to love and contentment."
"Blood ward? That's ridiculous, those need a strong emotional connection with the family. Her taking you in could seal the spell initially, but if there was no love, the spell would disappear immediately."  Severus added with his poker face in place, but deeply disturbed by everything he just listened to "You didn't know about magic?"
"All right honey, that's enough for today. We'll talk about those ward and the sorcerer's stone at another time. You need to rest." She sent her husband and Severus a warning look so they wouldn't press for more now just in case. None of the men seemed to be listening anymore.
Narcissa looked at both boys proudly. "You both did great, congratulations! Since we all woke up early today we can go and buy the supplies right away and get something special for dinner as a celebration." Everyone agreed and soon after they found themselves in Diagon Alley. It was full of students and parents running around gathering their school supplies.
"They are so happy, they are finally happy." She couldn't even remember the last time her son smiled like he did today if he ever did before. "I don't understand how you have managed this with Harry for so many years...I'm going crazy and it has only been a day."
Harry read the little paper and frowned, he didn't write this, he did write a note a bit like this but he was 7 years old. But after the beating he got when Dudley found it he stopped him from doing it again. And later when he begged Dumbledore to let him stay in Hogwarts because the Dursley's were going to kill him now that he knew about the magical world and was denied.
"So you are Potter" Ron spat with more hatred than before. "You have sunk low haven't you? Dating a Slytherin?
"I guess you could say it's a Silian thing. We don't need much sleep in general, about four hours is more than enough. Of course there is the exception of people that simply want to sleep more." She quickly checked his back pleased to see everything was fine. She had worried she was too late to help him the day before, that could cause some damage in the new wings. "Everything looks fine. Soon you should be able to fly with them without any trouble."
"Do the children know?" Remus asked.
"Harry, we need to talk to you about all of this" Narcissa said as gently as she could.
"Yes Dragon, but you have been infatuated with Harry for years" his mother helpfully said.
"Lordship means that you, as the next heir, take the title of head of the family. In your case I have the certainty that you would have the title for the Potters and the Blacks. I am not completely sure of any other branch of your family." Draco explained wondering how much Harry knows about the magical world, taking into account how he was raised. "It is dangerous because it is a lot of magic to accept, and controlling it can be too much for your magical core. That is why normally most people do not take them until they are of age and have their inheritance."
"You are so dramatic when you talk sometimes, hopefully we will survive this."
"Ginny! I told you not to run like that!" came Ron's voice that was walking toward them, scowling at Draco and his companion by extension clearly not recognizing him yet, "Malfoy what did you do to my sister!?"
"I understand. If it was up to me I would send them as far away as possible to keep them safe" he said with total sincerity, he had thought about it more that once.
"Yes, since you seem to have been born without self-preservation, something had to do that job." He laughed when the other glared at him. "You can't deny you are always running directly into the most dangerous situation you can find."
The both appear outside the safe house where Lupin opens the door for them and guides them to what is generally Draco's room. Narcissa was using her old healer training to fix the open wounds on Harry's back. Draco had the boy's head in his lap and was sliding his finger through his hair being careful not to wake him up or hinder his mother. Even if she had the proper training she did not exercise it frequently so she needed absolute concentration on her task if she wanted everything to come out well.
"Because that makes it so much better" he said rolling his eyes. When he spotted him watching them he raised one eyebrow and looked him up and down. "Can I help you with something?"
"That may be true, but you weren't there when I was discovered and you passed his test of loyalty afterwards as well. He still trusts you" Lucius said neutrally.
"We were just asking Mr. Weasley if he wanted to join us for dinner" Narcissa said when the silence got too long. Harry briefly tensed with the prospect of dinner with Ron before she continued "since he wanted to ask Lucius for some law advice and he is on his own."
Harry's excitement didn't waver the rest morning. He was skipping around the house singing softly, he was so restless and distracted he ended up slipping and crashing down on the floor. Draco looked at him move with a soft smile and couldn't help but laugh. All the noise finally woke up the rest of the inhabitants in the house, they were looking at them in various degrees of amusement and irritation.
"Who are you?" Snape asked cautiously.
"Fine I guess. At least I won't have to think about that until next summer ... " He was tired even after sleeping almost all day.
"It's true the parents may have some reservations, but I will handle all of their concerns" Dumbledore said. He conjured the contracts and quills for them. "Regrettably I need to go, I have to inform the rest of the Order that Harry is safe now. If you will excuse me." Once the contracts were signed he left right away and the rest went downstairs to the others.
"Only you would think about the political advantages of that. I don't think it would work, there are too many years of bad blood between the two of them."  He roll his eyes and finishes packing the last of his private lab. "All ready we should go back now."
Some time later the twins told him that the Weasley family had been estranged for a long time. Everyone had problems with the attitude of their two youngest members, both were too spoiled and their mother refused to see that they were going astray. It was a miracle Ginny wasn't pregnant yet with how irresponsible she was about taking care of herself. Ron was so dumb their mother would need to pay someone to hire him once he graduated.
"Yes indeed. I will assume that young Harry already told you the situation?" turning around to face them now.
"Finally awake?" He let Draco accommodate his wings to fit himself more comfortably on his back.
please any criticisms is greatly appreciated I'm really trying to improve my writing :)
on Harry, that did the trick. Harry opened his eyes and instantly threw himself at Draco, sobbing uncontrollably, still not completely able to distinguish between reality and the nightmare.
"This should help with pain at least temporarily. Your body will continue to hurt for a few days until the new magic settles completely" Severus explained.
"of us combined."
"I don't, it just happens" he said indignantly.
"We could find a better solution than allowing her to torture you into submission!" Severus said sharply.
"Not much, I never really tried to learn. It seems a bit useless to me if it is likely that I will die before finishing school." Harry has always thought this way, he does not see the point of learning something he does not have much time to enjoy and understand. He has only concentrated on surviving and at least trying to marvel at this world as much as he can in the time he has.
"Perfect follow us" they said in unison.
"Mmm, I don't think so. They seem to be smart kids, they would have too many witnesses," Lucius replied.
"I need to go and make breakfast," he was very amused by the whine he got in response. Thankfully he was able to escape Draco's arms and went to do breakfast for everyone and clean up a little, an ingrained habit at this point. He took Atreya from her tank and let her curl up on his neck, she was content to be with her master.
"Oh..I had hoped you would stay, there is so much I have to learn yet" sadness leaking into his voice.
"We were looking for official emancipation for Mr. Potter" He spoke regaining his composure and after thinking about it for a moment he added "and it may also be a good opportunity to hear the wills."
"Maybe, but I don't really know how to release them now and they would use too much space" Harry shrugs, it's not really too bad so he doesn't mind waiting until tomorrow. "Don't worry it's fine, I promise."
"Okay to start, Padfoot will receive my parents' cabin in London, also dad's book of charms and mom's poetry. For Moony he will have 10 million galleons and one of the houses in London. I prefer that you choose which house you like. We will not let you say no Moony please just accept what we want to give you." James smiles at him, putting the puppy eyes that he always used when he wanted to convince him to help in a joke.
"Yes Mr. Weasley, it would be great to talk more with you" said Harry, a lot more relaxed at the idea it was just him.
"I think it was a threat to you but it wasn't for Harry. I'm not sure why but I didn't want any of you to get close to him." He started to stroke the boy's hair to calm him down, he was still a little shaky.
"I'm not sure that's possible father. I may be interested, but I do not think Potter is. We don't have any kind of positive relationship so far, and I am pretty sure he will curse me if I even ask him." It still hurt a little to say out loud even if it was just a fact. He was quite surprised that his parents were supporting this.
"Could you... uh maybe stay... you don't have to of course. I just was really comfortable before ... uh sorry... "Harry talk so softly Draco needed a couple of seconds to understand the request. But once he did, he moved Harry gently. Draco laid down by Harry and let him curl up to him without another word.
"You don't pay here"
"Harry, it's time to eat." That did not work, and Harry simply complained a little and snuggled more into Draco.
"Favor?" they asked together with an identical devilish grin, "we are all ears."
The others returned to their seats, conveniently ignoring the way the teenagers had decided to sit. Griphook conjured a wooden box and put it in front of Harry, inside this box there were seven rings. Each had a different symbol in the front, some of them seem familiar for Harry.
"They had a will?" This was the first time he heard about it. "Well no,  I'm sorry but I'm not currently receiving any mail sir, I didn't know you had requested me here."
"I don't know if they had one, if they did it is in the Potter's manor and that place vanished with them."
"It doesn't really bother him, he is quite happy for her I think" to the expression of surprise that he received, he explained better "my parents don't love each other in the conventional sense of the word. They love each other more like siblings than a couple. Their parents forced them to marry, many pureblood families sign marriage contracts without the consent of their heirs. Both of them decided that they would marry, but both are allowed to find a person to love for themselves. I think that my Father has been trying to woo Uncle Sev for years."
"You never know when you will need one. It's better to be prepared... all done now try."
Everyone turned around abruptly, there were two women in the door that lead to the garden.
"What do you mean vanished?"
The group went to "Odilon's Cauldrons" for a well-deserved lunch. The restaurant served French cuisine, and was small but elegant. Odilon's Cauldrons was almost empty, which made getting a table for eight quite easy. Fred and George were surprisingly comfortable with this strange group. Although they were spending most of the time catching up with Harry and Remus.
"I think I can..." he was falling asleep already, he grabbed Draco's shirt tighter. "Yes I .... think I can... please don't go," soon after his body went limp on top of Draco. Usually he couldn't fall asleep after a nightmare, but the warmth of Draco's body and his steady heartbeat relaxed him like nothing else.
"Hedwig. Apparently she's rather good at finding them."
"Alright we are going to do this efficiently, Severus and Lucius please can you two go get the books for the boys, Remus please get the other supplies like quills, ink, and parchment, and we will go to Madame Malkin's to fit their new robes" Narcissa said with a smile and all of them dispersed. The only ones that bothered to put up full glamour this time were Lucius and Severus, after all it was rather easy to blend in with the crowd.
"It did give us a lot of time to test out our products" George said while putting his arm around Draco's shoulders resting his weight on him.
The man's face became one of disgust and hatred immediately. "There is no Harry Potter here! Go away, you freaks!" Narcissa put her wand on his throat with a soft smile on her face but her eyes promised painful murder. She has limits to her patience
"It's a long story," Kaly got up and moved to the center of the room. With a wave of her hand all the lights gathered in her palm, allowing her to conjure an image. "We were created almost at the beginning of everything, we were the first creatures magic blessed with its gift."
"All of you being in the castle would be a great advantage if we receive any kind of attack." He went silent for a while then continued in a friendlier tone, "I would like to know your opinion on the matter of course."
" you people?" Fred finish both extremely confused.
Draco smiled at the excitement in the tone welcoming the change of topic. "Yes I am, disappointed?" he said with a teasing smirk.
Then it hit him, the familiar scents of peppermint and apples made something click in the depth of his mind and told him it was important for him to remember this, to remember this person.
I have no idea if this can be triggering for anyone but better be safe than sorry this mentioned an attempted rape and violence not too extreme or graphic for my standards but you never know.
"I'm a little tired but I think I'm fine, I'm sorry for the trouble." He smile weakly while Narcissa ran a couple of spells to check his magic levels.
"I haven't heard him use it since his second year..." Severus responds, a little disturbed by the language. Most of Voldemort's followers could spend hours upon hours listening to him speak with Nagini, but he only got chills from it.
"Harry, are you okay to continue?" Draco asked softly, grabbing the boy's hand to give him something to keep himself grounded.
"Well with the current situation it would be terribly irresponsible on my part to not have a qualified DADA teacher. Remus, as Harry established, has been their best professor to date." Remus beaming at that, he had worked very hard for the job. "And your family Lucius still will need protection when term resumes. This is a good solution, we would have both of you fill in the position of DADA professor. As for Mrs. Malfoy, Harry mentioned your previous healer training. If you so desired, your knowledge would be greatly appreciated in our infirmary."
" to find Harry's things. They opened the cupboard under the stairs and took the truck exchanging silent looks of horror at the small cot with bloodstains that was inside. Narcissa gather all of the child's drawings that were in a small box in the corner. Remus released Hedwig telling her where to go while Draco lifts Harry in his arms. Draco's mother linked her arm with his and they all apparated to the safe house.
"Everything hurts." Severus came over and gave him a muscle relaxant potion.
"Harry, it's a nightmare! Come on, wake up!" he shakes him "Harry! Wake up, please!"
"That sounds like my Harry, and how did you end up in the bed?"  Narcissa and him were rearranging things for all of them to eat.
"Moony! That was not necessary!" Harry was always worried when someone spent money on him.
"Are you ready Flower?" James asked.
"Your magical inheritance, to be more precise, is the magic that your family has been accumulating for centuries. The older the name is the more magic they have. The lordship is one of the things that activates it or you will receive it on your 17th birthday when your magical core is prepared." Narcissa said a little worried that Harry didn't know about this even after being in this word since eleven. "The Potters and the Blacks are as old as the Malfoy's, so it is a significant amount of magic."
"No, not that I remember at least. Uncle Vernon threatened me with that. Often saying that if I didn't stop being so useless, he would just have to sell me to some of his colleagues for a couple of hours. I really don't know if he ever did it, because I passed out for a couple of days sometimes. But I don't believe it because Aunt Petunia wouldn't have liked him bringing people like that to her house in case they were thinking of doing something to Dudley." He never really thought about that, he prefers not to consider it much "And Dudley has been groping me and things like that since last year because of puberty I suppose. But that would be everything, it has never escalated."
Severus looked taken back while Harry took a deep breath to calm down. "I think I'm the only one that did it often enough to get a permanent scare, and she did get what she deserved." He had a slightly sadistic look on his face that sent a little shiver through the others.
"Let me see cub." Remus reached for the letter and smiled proudly. "You did great Harry! You even got an O in potions."
"Thank you, but I can't breathe" he tried to push they off chuckling and sitting next to Draco again while the others sat down in front of them.
He felt relieved when Fred and George hugged him a couple of days later and said "
"Thank you?" Ron was starting to turn red but before he could say the rest of the phrase Draco cut him off,  "Oh you see that wasn't so hard. Seems like even someone as dumb as you can learn basic manners, congratulations."
"Harry" said with relief, this relief was short lived because suddenly Harry's was tumbling down. Luckily Draco was fast enough to catch him before he hit the ground.
"Who would be our other guests?"
"Close your eyes please and keep them that way until I tell you to open them." The doctor turned to them, "his eyes were in very bad condition. His current lenses were practically useless. Now this spell works just like muggle contact lenses and should last for many years. If you feel that your prescription no longer works, you will have to return to refresh the spell. But in general it should be better for a long while."
Draco was in a trance, everything else disappear the moment he locked eyes with the stunning creature in front of him. It was a strange kind of beauty, one that could be considered scary but you were still incapable of looking away from it. He didn't even notice the others getting there at all, they didn't matter when he could be looking at the beautiful creature in from of him.
"I ... I'm sorry sir, but that snake is too expensive..." Now he looks a little scared.
Draco couldn't process all of this new information. How could someone do that to a child!? And how could no one do something about it?! He didn't care if it was a muggle or wizard. No one should do that to anybody, much less a child at their care. When he heard about Harry's cousin, shame ran through him. That sounded familiar, a spoiled brat making his life harder and taking every opportunity to make him miserable. Now he understood better the repulsion Harry had with him. He was a mirror image of that whale he saw at that house every day (well he was better looking but that's besides the point). How could Harry forgive him so easily? He should be mad, he should hate him, and yet Harry forgave him like it was the easiest thing in the world.
"I want to be more surprised" Fred said, but saw the cape they had been working on before, they needed to finish that today.
"Harry it's fine. They take it out with a spell that doesn't hurt." Remus smiles knowing that Harry developed a slight phobia of drawing blood. Harry takes a deep breath and extends an arm.
"I will say that you Harry, are a submissive as I am, and Draco would fit better with the profile of a dominant."
"Yes, we all signed the contracts. Thank you for the recommendation cub."
"We may need them, but it doesn't mean they would want to help us after what our kind did to them."
Severus apparated out of that house so fast he almost splinched himself. His mind was running wild trying to process that the child he has tormented for years, the child he hated more that anyone else in the world has been abused at home and he didn't notice. How didn't he notice?! He knows all the signs and what to look for in every case. He has done a perfect job at finding students all over the houses that were abused since he started working as a professor. He was silently helping them if they weren't his snakes. Still when it came to the child he had promised his best friend he was going to protect he let himself be blinded with hatred enough to bully the child since the first moment he saw him. Creating another place where he couldn't be safe or ask for help to get out of that awful place. Lily would be so ashamed of him, he can almost imagine her disappointed face.
They stood their in awkward silence for a moment. "If this is all you needed to discuss with me sir, I believe you should go to the Order to inform them to stop looking for me." He turned around to leave when something came to mind. "Sir do we have a professor for Defense Against the Dark Arts already?"
"Why do I feel like a doll?" Harry said flatly to the rest of the group.
She took them upstairs to a door with at least 7 locks on it and a tiny cat flap at the bottom. She then proceeded to practically throw the keys at them and run downstairs.
Harry regretted the loss of heat the moment it disappeared, something inside him was screaming his discontent but it was not the time to concentrate on that.
"I need you to tell me about those bad weeks. What happened then?"
She could see the problem immediately, in Harry's shoulder blades hard lumps were forming. The skin was red and irritated and it looked purple just at the base of the lumps and it was starting to bruise pretty badly.
"I think my mother has a crush on him." Harry's eyes went wide at that, looking at Lucius unconsciously. The one time he has saw his uncle beat someone other than him was when his aunt got asked on a date by one of the guys at the store.
"An angel?" Harry spoke in a low voice, feeling dizzy from moving so fast after losing so much blood. He was looking at the blurry white outline that was Draco, unable to see in his current state. "Did I really die?"
"Our own magic turned against us, it was a massacre. People falling dead on the spot without reason. We couldn't fix this, we could only beg to whoever listened to spared us." She paused for a moment getting rid of the terrible memory. "Just a handful of each survived, we have tried our best to live in the shadows and never expose ourselves until, well now."
He will never claim to being a perfect father he has been absent more often than he would like to admit. He loves his children with all his heart but he has not been there every time they had needed him. He sometimes got too caught up into his work or trying to understand the fascinating world of muggles. But he couldn't just stay silent when Molly belittles the way their boys decided to lived their lives, if what their doing makes them happy shouldn't that be all that matters to them? They brought them into the world not to fulfill any expectation but to give them the happiest life they could offer. If that happiness looks different from what they expected, well that is fine with him.
Mr. Weasley tensed minutely before his expression changed to one of defeat. "I wanted to ask you if you knew a good lawyer."
"Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, I want to visit Fred and George. They must be worried about the lack of letters." He could see the face of disgust that Severus made but he chose to ignore it.
"We can help, I'm guessing the three of us have enough of a brain to come up with something" Pansy said.
They went back to the doctor's office. The healer was focused while muttering a couple of spells on Harry's face. The adults looked at up at their entrance briefly, but gave them no more attention than that.
He knelt in front of the tank in which they had it in.
"Better me than the others! As long as I was her focus the rest could go under the radar!" Looking defiant at him. "Or do you think once I gave up she would stop? The only thing that would accomplish is prove her method works. I wouldn't give her the satisfaction."
I'm not entirely happy with this chapter I have rewritten it like 5 times already hopefully is not to bad
The morning was quite calm. The adults considered using a glamour, but it would be troublesome to have it on the whole day and having them divided their efforts for Draco and Harry. They end up deciding to use constant vigilance.
"Ahh ..." Harry wasn't sure what reaction this would have, but he was confident that the twins would give him the time to explain. "Can you all drop the glamour please?"
"I prevented her from falling on her face. You know most people would say thank you for that but I guess that would be expecting too many manners." Harry groaned, trying to convince Draco to be polite to Ginny but Ron is a lost cause.
"What happened to your species?" Lucius asked. "If you don't mind me asking."
"Finally, but the most important of all for my future godson. I want him to have everything else that the Black family can offer him, the title, the properties and the vaults, in addition to what I have in my personal vault too. I can't wait to finally meet you, It will be a lot of fun to see you grow up and teach you how to drive each professor crazy and make you a little Marauder. " He looks at them directly with an expression between sadness and content "But if you are seeing this, it means that I didn't make it. It is okay, I will always be around in one way or another. Let's be honest, if someone could drive death crazy enough to allow them to return to life it would be me. I want to be buried in Godric's Hollow next to Reggie's memorial. I don't want him alone anymore. For everyone I mentioned, you have been the best family I could ask for and I will be waiting for you on the other side. Take all the time you want. No need to hurry."
"Hurts hurts hurts!" Harry said incoherently but seemed to be trying to touch his back, so they used that as a guide. "Remus, Draco, grab his hands, Fred and George grab the legs, don't let him move!"
"you will pay," they finished in unison.
"There are not wards around this house" Severus concluded after a couple of spells.
Harry was enjoying the day immensely with the anonymity, without his old glasses and hiding his scar with his hair, no one even gave him a second glance (Draco disagreed with this glaring at more than one person that were staring at Harry for being attractive). Even a lot of his classmates didn't notice him, it was a refreshing change. They did stare at Narcissa and Draco a lot, he noticed both held themselves in an impeccable manner walking with grace and mostly non expressive faces. People either stared shamelessly at them or they started murmuring something probably unflattering to the closest person.
Nobody said anything or moved for what felt like hours. They just let Harry cry softly while Narcissa comforted him for as long as he needed . After about twenty minutes Harry pulled himself together a little.
"I bet, that our dragon would get the fiancé he wants. He is a Malfoy after all, we don't settle for less. But Severus didn't agree, for some strange reason he keeps doubting me." Lucius sat on the chair Remus transfigured.
The process of his lordship was quick and easy with his inheritance already acquired. The goblin which Harry seemed to get along was kind enough to bring them water and something to eat, after an hour Harry began to move again.
"Mother, could you transfigure some glasses? I think he will need them once he wakes up." Draco didn't even attempt to move.
"B-but that's impossible ... this has to be a lie!" Narcissa said in anguish, she hated what the first war did to Lucius, this simply couldn't be happening again.
"You will not find anything Severus, those girls already said that there was almost no information of them for us to find." Lucius said one night when Severus he was particularly snappy for his lack of progress.
"For my dear friend Severus I would like him to have our old albums, the blue moon pendant he gave me, and 5 million galleons" Lily smiled at him.
"We are survivors from two ancient races, I'm a Silian" Kaly said. "I'm what you would call a light creature, I believe we are related to the veelas in some way, but I'm not sure about that."
"Hi! what brings you to" Fred said crushing Harry with a hug.
"I will go help him. It is true dear, you need to eat. Severus, Lucius, behave." She practically ran after Remus.
"I'm serious, Pansy finds the love of her life once a week and Blaise is only interest is what new jacket he can buy and sometimes gives rants about how he wants to find a rich person to maintain his lifestyle. They are insufferable" he said with fondness in his voice. "Theo is quiet, but he deserves a prize for not killing us in our sleep."
"These rings represent the lordships in your name. On your father's side you have the titles of the Potter, Peverells, Gryffindor and Hufflepuff families." They all gasp at the mention of the Hogwarts houses, this was news to everyone. "On your mother's side you will get the titles of the Slytherin and Ravenclaw families and finally thanks to your godfather you have the title for the Black family."
The twins got the worst of it, Molly was harsher to them than she had ever been before. She tried to mold them to be something they weren't meant to be. He did worry excessively when they dropped out of school for their store, after all who wouldn't? But he has seen them succeed, seen them create something wonderful that make them happy, even if it is unconventional. There is nothing to criticize them for anymore.
The adults slowly left the room to the kitchen. Narcissa was the last to leave, she put Harry in bed and kissed him on the forehead.
"Isa? What are you doing awake?" Remus opened the door almost right away letting her in.
"Thank you..." Harry said in a small voice, not yet ready to accept that, but he needed to hear it after that horrible dream. He just then noticed he was completely drenched and said in disbelief "did you?... did you throw water at me?"
"Wouldn't you like to know" the twins laughed. They stayed in the store for a little longer before they had to go meet the others.
"What are...." George said.
"Mmmmm not to alarm you but .... I did not write this, I haven't tried to escape since first year"
"He will need your assistant very soon, do you think they will help us?"
"In that case, I hope you start courting him soon. You only have a year before you are of age and get your inheritance"  his father said, he seemed pleased with the turn of events.
"Is that true sir?" He said in a neutral tone as his gaze promised the guy painful death if he kept insisting.
He took a deep breath and got closer slowly "Harry?" He tentatively called, a couple of steps of distance still. The cluster moved slightly, "Harry" he called again more firmly this time. The cocoon then opened taking his breath away.
"Nice to meet you" Narcissa said out of automatic politeness. "Can you please tell us how both of you got here?"
"Oh you must be Luna and Neville, nice to meet you " they returned the greeting and sat down.
"I could recognize his smell anywhere, it's him."
"How didn't I notice... this is my fault."
He entered the stored quickly with Blaise and Pansy following. "Excuse me sir, can you show me this necklace please?" The clerk got up from the main desk and went to where he was near the window.
"Lovegood," Draco politely nodded in Luna's direction, she didn't seem to be nervous or scared of him so that was good.
"I don't understand it either" they looked at Remus to see if his extensive knowledge of magical creatures could help.
"Ahh!" Draco wakes up disoriented "Harry?... what happened?"
Logically he knows they will not laugh at him. But a bigger part of him still wanted to run for the hills and never look back if it got him out of this conversation. He couldn't lie to them like he lied to anyone else every time they asked. These were Slytherins, they know lies better than anybody. They wouldn't be deceived as easily, and Remus could literally smell if he was insincere. There was no way out of this but to tell them the truth, as much as he didn't want to do so.
"Remus would you let me stay here tonight?" she said out of nowhere making Remus blush. "I don't want to be alone... would you hold me?"
"That will be a conversation for later, Lucius, when can you make the appointment at Gringotts?" She quickly said, she still didn't want to talk about the war.
"Lead the way." After making dinner the both of them decided that they would all eat in the room with Harry.
"How have you been Arthur? How is work at the Ministry? " Remus asked once they had all ordered.
"No, you didn't die, Harry. We're here to take you to a safe place." He spoke in a soft tone that no one had heard before, Harry seemed to relax slightly.
"I agree, I don't know if your golden boy is much of the jewelry type but this is perfect" Blaise added. "With his luck anything that can give him a minimal semblance of self preservation should be forced upon him."
"Dear, it is alright. This is a lot to handle and you especially have a lot of stress on you. It is normal that you need to let it out every now and then." She took off his glasses to clean his face. "Would you talk a little more, or would you rather rest? Both will be perfectly fine."
"It will be strange to not see them together anymore," Remus said after a bit of silence. "They have been together for as long as I have known them I believe."
"Thank you" he said sincerely, quite relieved that it was her. He decided to bring the conversation back to the important issue. "What do we do now? If what you said is true and we are a warning, what can we do to prevent that massacre you showed us from happening?"
"But she was so sweet, I'm sure she will owl soon" Pansy said whining.
"No need to thank me" she disappeared for a moment to then come back dragging her half asleep mate. "We will go for now, the journey to the other is long. We will try to gather more information about the legends as much as we can."
