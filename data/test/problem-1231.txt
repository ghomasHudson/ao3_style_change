It was three more days, days filled with quiet since Harry was still considered active on the Cock Case, and he was
Malfoy ignored him as he took up his wand to cast a few spells at the penis, and nodded to himself as the colored sparks of magic fizzled and died out. He made a few more notes on the paperwork before he snapped on a pair of gloves and picked up the penis to give it a few brisk strokes. It firmed up in his hands, and Malfoy set it down on its end, the balls drawing up closer to the shaft as they made contact with the chilly steel of the exam table. It wobbled a bit, but stayed upright looking all big, and. Perky. Very perky. Almost intimidatingly perky.
, and Harry cursed Hermione and her stupid calendar again. But all he could say with Kingsley and Bartram both staring at him was "Yes, Sir."
Malfoy’s cheeks went a little bit pinker, but his smile turned sly. “I’ll hold you to that. Normally I make a bloke buy me dinner before any cocks get involved, but I suppose I can make allowances for the peculiarities of the situation. I’ll settle for a drink.”
Harry eyed Malfoy for a second, then plucked the stack of paperwork from his hands and brought it slamming down on the cock. The sparks fizzled and went out, and Malfoy looked pained as Harry handed him the papers back.
Harry turned his attention to the hat, desperately hoping that he was mistaken. Upending it carefully, Harry's penis rolled out. He took a moment to hope that the similarity was just a coincidence, so he nudged it over with a quill. And then that hope died; it had the same freckle on the right side, right near the base, that looked kind of like Belgium, and which begged the question of just how the
The latest cock appeared to be just that: a cock. It wasn’t sparkly or vibrating, and was blessedly unfamiliar to Harry.
“Because the alternative is showing up with a cock in my hands,” Harry huffed, trying not to imagine the looks
Many of the Aurors were peering over the tops of their cubicles, but as soon as Harry opened the door they all ducked down out of sight, eager to avoid drawing any unnecessary attention to themselves. Harry sighed a little to himself and snagged a stack of evidence envelopes and copies of the paperwork he thought he’d need before he left the Auror Department and went back to his office in Apparition.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Someone left a very realistic fake cock at an Apparition Point. This'll be break room gossip for a week at the most."
He stared at Harry until Harry gave in, otherwise they’d be here all bloody day. “What does that mean, Malfoy?” he ground out, and made his voice go a little mocking as he added, “I don’t understand, please explain it to me with your giant brain.”
“Oh for the love of—” Harry muttered, then snarled off a Stasis Charm to keep his lunch warm, dumped the stupid arsehole vibrating cock into the nearest Containment Receptacle, and stormed off to St Mungo’s.
He wondered how he could have missed it. He distinctly remembered thinking in the beginning that the stupid acronyms reminded him of the safety posters plastered all over St Mungo's walls. And after the incident with the vindaloo, he
There were several moments of breathless kissing, as Harry slowly worked Malfoy's cock, before Malfoy finally began tugging at Harry's flies. Harry tightened his grip slightly as he felt the first grasp of Malfoy's fingers, narrow and tight, wrapping around his own cock.
"I'm sure it was fine." Harry gave the box a little nudge, returning her attention to the matter at hand. "If I could just...?"
that I wear gloves at all times when performing a physical examination,” Malfoy said, shoving the cock at him again. “Now touch it.”
“No,” Harry said, easing around to the other side of the exam table, putting some distance between himself and the newest cock. “I promise you this thing hasn’t come into contact with any cumin.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry said, collecting the thick sheaf of paperwork and stuffing the cock back into the hat. His mind was still occupied with running through his potential leads and what forms he’d need to submit to follow them through. “Thanks, Malfoy,” he said as he turned to go.
“Don’t listen to Ron,” Hermione said dryly. “Ten minutes ago he laughed so hard at Harry that his drink came out his nose.”
“All right,” Harry sighed. “I’ll admit they’re an impressive bit of magic. However, I’d find it more impressive if I didn’t have to run around collecting them from all over the city.” He sighed again, deeper and more put-upon. “Or keep them on my desk.”
Harry shrugged. "Now that exams are over, I think Rosemary's handling most of it. That and sticking a trainee in to babysit. Pretty quiet there most days when there aren't any cocks."
St Mungo's was busy as well. Because apparently the thing to do on a Saturday was to make Harry's day a little more difficult. He trudged across the floor, skirting around the crowd at Muriel's desk, and stood in line to wait for the lift.
"You're from Apparition, aren't you?" she asked briskly, and nodded to the box. "Take that up to Spell Damage. Ask at the desk for the Healer on duty." She frowned a bit at him. "Are you new?"
"But," Harry said, looking down at the cock. Lacking any further attention, it had begun to droop a little, like a flower in need of watering. "It looks real."
Looking back, that should’ve tipped him off that things were about to take a turn for the terrible. Because that was just how Harry’s life worked. Things proceeded smoothly for just long enough to allow Harry to build up a bit of false hope, and then promptly went sideways.
Except when he arrived at St Mungo’s and the mediwitch on duty on the fourth floor directed him to exam room 5, Malfoy wasn’t there.
“Absolutely,” Harry said. “I am completely afraid. Because that thing is incredibly disturbing. Distressing. Dangerous, even. And whoever made the bloody thing is
“Yes, I’m positively sure that I filled out the request correctly and submitted it to the appropriate subdepartment,” Harry told the bored-looking wizard manning the front desk. “And
“Potter,” Malfoy said, sounding half exasperated and half amused, and Harry realized Malfoy had been trying to get his attention for some time. “I’m finished, if you’d like to stop cluttering up my exam room?”
The Vicious Cockmonster perked right up, just like the last one had, and Malfoy sighed. "Where's the form?"
Pansy made a small thoughtful humming sound. “Yes I can, because I don’t think you’ve thought it through. He does tend to talk rather loudly, doesn’t he? Do you really want the entire pub to know about your case?”
This cock was located unfortunately close to the Apparition point at one of the Highgate Ponds, which, as it was the first truly glorious day in May, were quite busy. Harry nodded to the Auror and Obliviator standing at the edge of the path, and quickly scooped up the cock before ducking back to the Apparition Point and away.
"I don't like it any more than you. But this one got sent to a Member of Wizengamot, and it's suddenly my problem."
“It can,” Malfoy said, continuing to fill out the form. “Especially complex and delicate spellwork. Which of course the spells on these would have to be, to make them so lifelike. Whoever enchanted these must be tremendously talented.”
Ron snorted, finally coming close enough to prod a penis himself. "So weird seeing them sitting on your desk like that. Maybe we can get you some pants to cover them up with."
"Mr Potter. Yesterday you brought what you thought was a Splinching accident to St Mungo's. Is that correct?"
He couldn’t help it, he laughed a little bit too. Thought briefly about making a joke of it, about how back in school they should’ve charmed the Snitch into cocks and Malfoy would’ve beaten him every game because he apparently had no trouble catching those. But no, he shouldn’t say that, Malfoy would probably take that poorly, and Harry had sort of enjoyed the lack of antagonism of today’s visit.
“Don’t forget when you got called in on your day off so that Arthur Weasley could give you a replica of your own—”
“How’d it go?” he asked, tapping his spoon briskly against the rim of his mug before he set it aside.
“Right,” Malfoy said, shaking his head a little as he bent over the papers again. “I just assumed you’d keep them in boxes.”
It wasn’t until he stepped out into the lobby at St Mungo’s and cast a hurried Drying Charm on himself that Harry realized he’d neglected to pick up the Containment Receptacle after he’d retrieved the latest cock, and also said latest cock apparently liked him enough to go hard just from Harry touching it. Or maybe it just like traveling by Floo, some preciously optimistic corner of Harry’s brain suggested. He scowled and blocked it out.
“Anyhow,” she said, hefting the box and balancing it on one hip to give Harry’s arm a pat with her free hand. “Looks like you’re back to boring Aurorwork, now. When I dropped off the paperwork to transfer the case, Kingsley mentioned he was putting you with Ron.”
Harry resisted the urge to ask what exactly about his face, and instead focused on how grateful he was for Ministry-issue heavy woolen robes, which were doing an excellent job at hiding the fact he was
The penis was now vibrating so hard that Harry’s whole desk shook with it. His drink sloshed from its cup. A picture frame clattered down onto its face. And. Oh no. No. The other penises had begun to grow hard as well. The buzzing sound filled his small office, loud enough now that Harry worried it could be heard from the hallway.
"Oh no," Harry assured him, slumping back in his chair. "Kingsley was very adamant that I take sole responsibility of this case. I think he's still narked about the bathtub thing."
Harry straightened abruptly, before he turned to blink owlishly at the grinning Rosemary. "You're sneaky."
Harry found himself not at all surprised. Pansy seemed to know all of the people who took the most pleasure from terrible things happening to him. "I hate you."
The cock reached the end of the table and seemed to curl in on itself a little, tensing, its bollocks swaying in a way that reminded Harry of a cat wriggling its hindquarters as it prepared to make a jump.
Harry grinned, twisting his hand on the upstroke. Malfoy's gasp at that was quickly followed by a squeeze, and Harry’s own cock was suddenly caught in a painfully tight grip.
Because it was entirely unprofessional of him, but suddenly Harry couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy looking that intently at his actual cock, about Malfoy’s hand wrapped firmly around him and sliding up and down his length in smooth, even strokes. It was horrible, and distracting, and involuntarily compelling. Malfoy’s hand drifted lower to give the bollocks a fondle, and what was left of Harry’s composure snapped.
Then the day got worse when Seamus poked his head in with a "heard you were in today" and asked him for lunch and saw three penises on his desk where there had been two. And then he laughed as he made Harry tell him the full story.
Harry briefly pondered trying to keep Seamus from the plate, but sighed, holding it out. "Hey, Seamus."
Well, that and Tuesdays. But he didn't want to spend his weekend thinking about Tuesdays. Harry didn’t even like spending his Tuesdays thinking about Tuesdays.
to get the cock inside, and screwed the lid on tight. “There you go. Don’t say I’ve never done anything nice for you.”
Harry was surprised it took Seamus and Ron until nearly the end of the day to stop by his office. He'd spent most of the afternoon expecting them, counting down the minutes until the three hours were up and praying they wouldn't stop by before then. He really really really didn't want to explain the erections to them.
He worried about himself at that, too. That Malfoy's crazy cock logic was starting to seem… reasonable.
"You get that fucking wanker here right this instant, or so help me I will arrest him at work and make the biggest fuss I can cause and he will
he was right not to trust, started whistling 'God Save the Queen' at a shocking decibel, while the Vicious Cockmonster started to throb along in time.
Harry glowered at him. “Do you want to know what I did today? Today is Tuesday. Tuesday is Mrs Periweather and Persimmon.”
"Yes, hi," Harry said, setting his box on the edge of the desk. "I need to see the Healer on duty. The Welcome Witch sent me up here. I'm from—"
“Bastard,” Harry muttered, dropping the kettle down onto the counter with a loud clang, which his throbbing headache immediately regretted. Auror Fowler owned a coffee mug roughly the size of a standard size two cauldron, which, really, was just bloody unnecessary.
He gathered up a Containment Receptacle and the paperwork, took a deep breath, and went to the Apparition Point specified in the report.
Malfoy left the exam room in another swirl of robes. Harry stared at the stack of forms and shoebox, and felt the dreadful certainty that lost sex toys were about to become his department.
"You mean the time you accidentally Apparated into a Muggle's bathroom while he was having a bath?" Seamus asked gleefully. “And they had to call in eight Obliviators to deal with it?”
Harry had barely caught his breath when Malfoy gave his hair a light tug. He didn't want to move. Malfoy's shoulder was surprisingly comfortable for being so bony. Finally, with a chuckle, Malfoy wiped his hand on Harry's shirt before sliding his fingers under Harry's chin and tipping his head up. He gave Harry a heart-stoppingly sweet smile, and Harry found himself grinning back like a lovesick fool.
He didn't finish the exam before it firmed up again. But Malfoy was apparently in no mood to take any more bullshit from sparkly penises, and shot a strong enough
Pansy raised a brow at him when he didn’t respond right away, and Harry sighed and took another drink from his pint. “Go bother Seamus, then, if you think he’s so unprofessional. He’ll be more than willing to blab about an open investigation.” And right now, having Seamus lay out the particulars of how Harry’s life had gone particularly pear-shaped over the past few weeks was preferable to being forced to do it himself.
,” Harry said archly, taking a much-needed gulp of his pint. “I’m fairly sure you haven’t heard of it.”
“Nnnggh,” Harry said, flinching again as his brain helpfully supplied a colorful mental picture of what it must feel like to have one’s cock and balls Splinched off. He took a deep breath, then another, and another. Right. He had a job to do here. He was a professional. He was here to help.
On Tuesday, Harry found himself actually hoping for a new cock to appear, just for the chance to pop over to St Mungo’s and maybe see Malfoy again.
Harry cast a few lazy charms at the parchment, but didn’t pick up anything from it other than the words had been spelled onto it instead of written. It meant that they didn’t have the advantage of matching it to a person’s handwriting, but there was a small chance they could lift the sender’s magical signature from it if they hadn’t been clever enough to mask it. Worth a try, Harry thought.
“Why not?” Malfoy asked, frowning down at the cock in his hands. He turned it over, as if examining it for some flaw. “It’s a very nice specimen. Lovely proportions. Couldn’t ask for a nicer looking cock, really.”
On the table, the cock was now doing a repetitive reaching... thing. Stretching in a way he had never known a cock could do, before springing in again. The table was starting to wobble rather rhythmically, and Harry spared a moment to hope the soundproofing of the rooms held, as it sounded rather like he and Malfoy were… well. Like they were doing something that would get them written up at best, fired at worst, if they were doing it on the job.
The throbbing behind Harry’s forehead promptly doubled at the mere thought. He bit back a sigh. "Yes, sir."
Harry hadn’t noticed the papers had got singed. Must’ve been when he was trying to get the sparklepenis to stop sparking. He shrugged.
After arriving at the Burrow and exchanging hugs and greetings, Harry was certain he was prepared. He made his way over to the couch where Ron was sitting and plopped down beside him. He took one look at Ron's face and spoke quickly to head off the piss taking. "Someone has to be using Polyjuice."
“Just bothering you,” Seamus said, wandering in and picking up a quill from Harry’s desk. He poked idly at BDSM cock.
"So kind." And then Harry let out a very manly squeak when Malfoy tightened his fist, stroking Harry's cock with a vengeance. "Oh. Oh, fuck."
"Of course. I'll see you tomorrow at dinner. Molly's making treacle tart, especially. Don't be late!" Harry continued to stare at the empty chair as the sound of Arthur's happy footsteps quietened down the hallway.
It ended up an oddly pleasant evening. Even if he did end it feeling a lot more sympathy for whoever sent Bartram the penis.
For a long moment, Harry just stared dumbly at it. Because, how had this become his life? The penis had begun to quickly firm up from its own vibration, and Harry knew from personal experience grudgingly gained over the past week that once the penises got hard, they usually took their sweet fucking time to deflate again. And that as terrible as it was to have a line of flaccid penises lined up on his desk, it was infinitely worse to have a line of erections there instead. When they were erect there was twitching. And
Then Malfoy turned back toward him, with his arms extended and a terrifyingly intent expression on his face. He moved slowly but steadily towards Harry, cock held out in front of him like some sort of perverted divining rod.
Harry laid it slowly, gently on the table. Not willing to jostle it in case it… did something. He didn't even know what he was doing with these cocks anymore. His life was a neverending nightmare of cocks. Big cocks, small cocks, sparkly, vibrating, and now striped.
“Exam room 4,” she interrupted, raising her voice to be heard over the rambunctious cock in the box. She looked like she was struggling not to laugh at him. A part of Harry wanted to be upset, but honestly he couldn’t find it in himself to blame her. “Sounds urgent. I’ll send Healer Malfoy right in.”
Harry hesitated with his hand on the doorknob. “Er. Do you. Want anything?” he asked. “I could get you some tea. Or something. If you want.”
The fourth of the CopyCocks, as Seamus had dubbed them (“Get it, Harry? Like copycats, but cocks. Because they’re penises,” he’d said, grinning broadly, and Harry had groaned and told him, “That’s awful, Seamus. You should be ashamed of yourself. Now shut up and go away.”) appeared bright and early on Monday morning.
"Exactly what I said," Malfoy told him with an impatient little frown pinching the corners of his mouth. "It's not real."
It was actually a bit frightening that she and Malfoy seemed to be agreeing on something. And that Malfoy was agreeing with
Rosemary gave him a long look, then she nodded. "Yup. I'll see you in a few hours." She turned back to her office.
The only good thing about stomping into Spell Damage after lunch on Saturday with his cock in a hat was that Malfoy looked as miserable as he did. "That's not a Containment Receptacle."
If he’d been asked just ten seconds earlier, Harry would’ve said with one-hundred-percent certainty that scooping a disembodied penis off the cobblestones was the absolute lowest point of his day. But ten seconds earlier, Harry wouldn’t have known that he’d be forced to present said disembodied penis along with an inch-thick stack of paperwork to Healer Malfoy.
Harry leaned down, flipping the lid closed, and stared a moment. He'd never gotten authorization to trace the information linked to the pseudonym and company, lost wherever lost forms met their end, but something in the looping script, or maybe the angle he was looking at it, pinged familiar to him.
thing to do. But he was enjoying the thought enough that when Malfoy did finally open his mouth, the lack of
After the excitement of Saturday and the ensuing embarrassment of Sunday dinner at the Burrow, Harry was almost relieved when the next week was relatively uneventful. Although he made a disappointingly small amount of progress in his investigation, only two more cocks appeared between Monday morning and Friday afternoon. He was called to retrieve the first one on Tuesday, which actually worked out in Harry’s favor as it meant he missed ferrying Persimmon and Mrs Periweather to and from the groomer’s. Rosemary’s scowl as he hurried off down the hall warmed him to the very bottom of his heart, and he couldn’t resist waggling his fingers at her in a cheerful wave as the lift doors slid safely closed.
Malfoy visibly gritted his teeth. “My holiday was perfectly lovely, thank you for asking. It’s the coming back to find that they’d arsed up my schedule and put me on the overnight shift that
“It’s just weird, is all,” Harry said when he took the third one to St Mungo’s. He’d forgotten to grab a Containment Receptacle on his way out of the Ministry and had been forced to wrap it in yesterday’s
Really, were it not for the months of piss taking, plus the fact that a perfect replica of his cock was still attached to a chair, he'd write the whole thing off as Bartram reaping the benefits of the mountains of red tape he was more than half responsible for.
of careful breeding whose esteemed lineage is longer than my left arm. Persimmon is the fucking pinnacle of kneazle-dom.” He huffed. “I called Persimmon ‘just a kneazle’ and Mrs Periweather hit me with her purse.”
The rest of the morning continued apace. Harry burnt his toast, and spilled his tea, and then when he finally made it into work—only five minutes late—he was greeted by Rosemary grinning broadly and waving a Containment Receptacle at him.
Sighing a little, Harry squeezed into the crowded lift. He kept a tight hold on the box to keep the lid firmly affixed, pressed the button for the fourth floor, and—
put all sorts of exciting mental pictures in Harry’s head. Harry swallowed and did his best to focus on the cock at hand and not the one in Malfoy’s pants, and what he may or may not have done with it while on the clock.
Looked like Vindaloo Cock had gone off again, and it must’ve been right up against Sparklepenis because seconds later a jet of rainbow sparks erupted into the air.
"I don't. You come in, bringing me a new cock each time. I do a thorough examination. Chat up a piece of heroic eye-candy, send you all on your way when I'm done. What do I have to worry about?"
Malfoy snorted and snatched the stack of paperwork away from Harry, flipping angrily to the first page. “It’s a sex toy, Potter. Do you think that thing is in any condition to be shoved up someone’s arse?”
The elf gaped, and then turned to dash further into the house. Harry followed, slamming the door behind him. Once inside, he looked around, trying to determine the best place to give Malfoy a piece of his mind. He could hear the elf squeaking frantically from somewhere deeper in the house, and he spared a moment to regret giving Malfoy the home field advantage.
Of course, the balance was middle of the night drunken Splinchings on Fridays and Saturdays, but those were when he was still up, anyway. And he could take a Containment Receptacle thingie to a Splinch point, and drop it off at Spell Damage while drunk himself, and it would be someone else's problem until Monday.
There was still bickering, of course. And Malfoy poking a bit of fun at him. But it was edging closer and closer to the sort of bickering and fun-poking that Harry’s friends did with him.
"Problem with Polyjuice, or the cocks in general, is they give no indication how the real thing would behave when faced with similar circumstances." And Malfoy's hand was moving quickly, dragging Harry closer to the edge than he was ready for. And Malfoy still managed to sound like he was giving a fucking History of Magic lecture while he was doing it. "So while I can experiment, wank, whatever, the reactions are inherent to the device, not to the model."
"No, she just thought you were hungover." Hermione took another bite, chewing quickly. "And I'm glad that you're getting some use out of it. You should read things beyond case notes and Quidditch periodicals."
He banged on Malfoy's door for nearly a minute before it creaked open and a small house-elf glared up at him. "You is to be having patience. Master Malfoy is not here right now."
Standing up, he gathered his things, left the paperwork on his blotter and the cock pushed to the farthest edge of his desk, and headed down to the Auror department to meet Ron and Seamus so they could head to the pub together.
I waited three to five days for a response and when I didn’t get that I contacted you via interoffice memo, and all I learned is that the lot of you—”
Malfoy's smile at that wasn't the smirk Harry was expecting, but a small pleased thing. "Well then. Wow me with your cocks. And your vocabulary. I've heard you
Spell Damage was, again, blessedly quiet, and he approached the desk quickly. "Quick sign-off. It's not a splinch, but needs a Healer's say-so."
None did. It was still his life. He sent another half-hearted memo to Filing to see if they'd located his evidence, but he knew it was mainly just for the record of having done it. The evidence itself was lost, but it wasn't his fault if he kept asking for it. Or something. At the very least he was giving those wankers another excuse to send him a snide memo.
And then realized that whatever bastard had done it (Harry’s money was on Seamus) had also stolen his lunch.
“Stasis Charms work by repressing an object’s natural energies and refocusing them inward,” Malfoy said, tossing the cock into the Containment Receptacle. “It’s like how when you put a Stasis Charm over a cup of hot tea, you get a puff of steam when you release it.”
Something like his cock. His cock, which twitched at the thought. He lifted his sheet and stared at it, half-hard after the stupid dream about stupid sodding Malfoy.
Over in Bad Cock Corner, the Vindaloo cock began to vibrate, and Harry sighed and hit it with a Levitation Charm so it could shake all it wanted without bringing down the whole shelf or exciting the other cocks. The shelf wasn’t quite tall enough to accommodate the Vicious Cockmonster when it perked up all the way, Harry had learned. That’d been rather a low point in the case for him, prying a fake cock from where it’d wedged itself in his bookshelf. He only counted himself lucky that no one had been around to witness that.
"Hello there!" the Mediwitch greeted him cheerfully as the broccoli woman sat down with her paperwork and a quill.
Honestly, they were freaking him out more than a little. He and Malfoy spent a while testing Number Six, just out of a morbid curiosity to see what it would do. It trembled at the sound of his voice from behind a closed door. It throbbed when he touched it. Most entertainingly, when they stuck it to the exam table and Harry walked around in a slow circle, it swayed toward him like a compass needle following magnetic north. Harry insisted on putting it back in the Containment Receptacle after that. He’d made it this far without seeing how realistic any of the cocks were when they ‘came’ and he’d rather like to keep it that way.
!” The penis continued to vibrate, the sound growing louder the longer it went on. It was fully erect now, flushed red and straining up towards the ceiling. “Oh god, stop. Stop!”
"So those are the cocks?" Seamus leaned in close, examining both from every angle. "And they really get hard?"
Harry dropped his forehead to the tabletop again. Then gave it an extra thump just for good measure.
Without looking at any of the bystanders or reacting to the smattering of applause his stunt had earned him, Harry hauled himself out of the fountain and made his way, sodden robes dripping and wet shoes squelching with every step, over to the nearest Floo.
“Coriander,” Malfoy confirmed. “The properties of coriander were covered in seventh year potions. However, I believe you were otherwise occupied for that lesson.”
Hermione raised her eyebrows. “I assumed you’d have the forethought to arrange for your own transportation home at the end of the night. You’re an Auror, Harry. I know you know how to think tactically.” She crunched into a slice of cucumber.
. Do you know he examined and took notes on my cock for forty minutes? Commenting all the while, comparing it to that Vicious Cockmonster."
It wasn’t until he’d made his way down to the Atrium that it occurred to him that Rosemary hadn’t mentioned what
It deflated instantly, and Malfoy left it and the completed paperwork on the exam table without another look or word to Harry.
“Five minutes, Potter,” Malfoy snapped. “Five more bloody minutes and my shift would’ve been over and you would’ve been another Healer’s problem.”
The penis twitched. Harry blinked a few times. No, definitely not his imagination. The penis really had twitched and was now beginning to harden. Malfoy gave it another stroke with his wand and, yes, no question about it. It was getting hard. Malfoy swapped his wand for his quill and used the feathery end to give the penis a tickle. It twitched again.
April meant the Apparition Exam, and Harry felt some measure of relief when on 1 May, he deposited the rings back in the closet and gathered his effects and the seven penises, six in the box, one
"These tables are made to withstand a great deal of weight and force. But apparently not while rocking."
Malfoy cackled and turned away to snap on a pair of gloves. “Honestly, Potter. It’s a fake cock. It hasn’t got feelings, you know.” He adjusted the snug cuffs around his wrist. “And while we’re at it, nor has it got ears. I promise you it neither knows nor cares what I say about. I mean, I understand that you’re the Saviour and all, and you probably can’t help yourself rushing to defend anything you feel could use your aid, no matter how small or helpless—”
"I'm multi-talented." But he pulled Malfoy close once again, leaning in hard, until Malfoy gasped. "And you're not complaining too much."
Harry covered his face. "Oh, god. Please, just put it down on the desk and promise me you'll never say that again."
And that made the best noise of all: a half-choked moan as Malfoy’s grip went lax around Harry's cock and he began to spill in hot wet spurts over Harry's hand.
The first thing he noticed when he arrived at the Apparition Point at Diagon Alley was the half-dozen people standing around. The second was George Weasley, crouched over something on the ground. Harry groaned, pushing his way through the crowd and past the Aurors blocking the Apparition point.
Harry supposed it looked a bit like the cock currently sitting on the corner of his desk. If one could say a chihuahua looked rather like a rottweiler because they were both dogs. But it was huge. Intimidatingly large, even flaccid and nestled in the silky-looking blue cushioning inside the box.
Harry scowled into his bowl and viciously stabbed a chunk of tomato with his fork. He honestly had no idea how he could have been so mistaken as to think Hermione was his best friend. Ron was Harry’s best friend, always had been and always would be. Ron knew how to commiserate properly when a bloke was feeling down; Hermione just brought out
But no, with his luck, that would end him up in St Mungo's, waiting for Malfoy to reattach something.
By the time the lift doors opened and Harry stepped out into the waiting room, the cock was twitching constantly, loud thumps against the cardboard sides of the Containment Receptacle punctuating the ongoing drone of its vibrations.
"Potter?" Harry turned to see Malfoy standing in the doorway, wearing his lime green scrubs and looking completely bewildered.
But to his surprise, Healer Reynolds cast one single solitary spell at the cock, then filled out the top page of form 68-J, initialed page two, then flipped all the way to the final page and ticked off two boxes before initialing again. He shuffled the papers together, tapped them on the exam table to straighten them, and handed them back to Harry. All of thirty seconds had elapsed.
“Oh yeah,” Ron said gleefully. “And then the Unspeakables sent up to Level One for someone to go fetch all the evidence for them. And guess who got stuck with that job?”
"At least I know you've got some idea of how to handle a cock," he commented instead, working quickly on his buttons. "And don't even," he continued when Malfoy opened his mouth, likely to say something arsey. "No other Healer I saw for
"Mm. I notice you’re not saying you didn't want to." Malfoy gave a little wriggle at that, causing his cock to slide a bit in Harry's grip, and Harry could only shake his head. "You obviously need more practice. I can send you more."
"Would? Yeah. Did?" Harry sighed. "Not so much. He looked way too gleeful when he worked out that it was mine. And that’s not even the worst part. The worst part is I had to take it to St Mungo’s to have it inspected by
Harry had heard Malfoy laugh before, cruel or derisive or mocking, but never like this. Open and deep and a little helpless, and...nice. Very nice, actually. Malfoy had a surprisingly nice laugh, and it did something strange and a little fluttery to the very pit of Harry’s stomach.
She gaped, and then pointed across the hall to an open door. He hurried in and dumped the bundle on the table. Then he stood back out of the way. Just in case. He couldn’t hear anything from within his bundled-up robes, and didn’t see any smoke. Still. No sense in taking risks with it.
Harry reached out and grabbed the plate in one hand, and a biscuit in the other. Whatever the shape, Ron made delicious biscuits, rather like his tea. "This is the only reason you're not dead right now." And he took a large bite.
Harry finally wrangled his robes into a ball, great bloody thick Auror wool uniforms all heavy and hard to get off for
Harry snapped his fingers. “That’s the one. Well, the latest cock was found charmed to his forehead.” He paused a moment, remembering. He hadn’t had time to really enjoy the image it presented, what with panicking and trying to get it down, but he was very much enjoying the memory. “It fit quite well, too. The balls rested over his eyes, the cock drooping down over his nose. It was actually something of an improvement, in my opinion.”
Everything gave Malfoy the advantage though, which Harry was feeling heartily sick of, so he simply entered the room to the right, looking around at the dark wood and books and contemplating hexing the lot.
He was relieved to get a call to respond to a Splinching on the following Monday: Day Ten of No Cocks. He grabbed a Containment Receptacle and headed for the scene. And instead of the cock he’d expected, he found a nose. Harry blinked down at it. Well. That was a lot creepier than he thought it’d be. But, duty calls and all that. He packed it away in the Containment Receptacle and bundled it off to St Mungo’s, where Healer Reynolds grumbled a bit as he filled out form 68-J and then briskly reattached the nose to the middle-aged man to whom it belonged.
"Are you kidding?" Ron asked. "We weren't going to come anywhere near you until all the particulars of the case had been settled."
Harry just shook his head, because phrased like that, it made a bit of sense. Stupid sense, and he was really starting to worry about Malfoy's mind, but sense.
"No, I. You." And then, when Malfoy broke into his stupid fucking-with-Harry grin, "You're an arsehole." Maybe the chest-clutching should’ve given it away a moment earlier, but Malfoy had always been an overdramatic git. It was sort of hard to tell when it was put-on and when he was being serious.
Rosemary and Hermione both laughed at that, and Harry sighed. "Well, back to St Mungo's for me, I guess. Ugh, why did Kingsley make this
"That's evidence," he said firmly. "Unless you're offering to help out on this case, in which case it's all yours." He waved the card at the two cocks perched on the far corner of his desk.
For a long moment, Harry stared dumbly at it, his brain still desperately trying to process what the fuck had just happened. And then the sound of a door opening down the hall kicked him into action. He scrambled into the hall and snatched up the cock and all but threw it back into the exam room. He didn’t mean to aim it at Malfoy but Malfoy caught it on what seemed to be pure blind instinct so it was probably okay, no harm done to either Malfoy or the cock, and Harry hurled himself into the exam room after it and slammed the door behind him.
Harry gave her a petulant look. “I already told you to do that. Can’t threaten me with my own suggestions.”
Hermione huffed quietly. "But don't worry about Rosemary. She knows most of this is new to you. She'll help you out."
Ron and Hermione exchanged a look, and then Hermione was the brave soul to ask, “So, what does that mean?”
matched the script on the box in miniature, and Harry took a deep breath, flipping the box open again and digging around inside. Malfoy's handwriting was loopy and fancy enough that it could still be a coincidence. The cock rolled out, coming to a standstill beside the others on his desk and he stared at it a moment, waiting for it to do something, anything, before looking at the care card.
Malfoy simply shot him a look, before he smirked. "Who wants to have sex on the job, anyway? Much less fun than advertised and more trouble than it's worth."
When he entered, all eyes turned to him. "Have a seat, Potter." Kingsley gestured to one of the empty chairs around the long table. Harry crept forward, sitting beside Rosemary and as far away from the fuming Bartram as possible. Kingsley's expression revealed nothing, but Robards was red-faced and Rosemary was pale and clenching her fingers against the arm of her chair.
Rosemary grinned, and he felt something low in his stomach drop. She held up the Containment Receptacle she'd deliberately hidden behind the wall of his cubicle, and gave it a little jiggle. "Got a report of a cock for you."
Harry shrugged. "Apparently it's what they need if it's not a Splinching, too. I'd take it up with those wankers down in Filing, but Hermione's been working on them for five years now, and if she can't get through, I have no hope."
Rosemary's lips twitched. "You mean…." She made a surprisingly obscene gesture, and at Harry's nod, started cackling. "Oh that's brilliant. Maybe we should take them home. Try them out."
“Well, we’re going to have to work out how to make it stop,” Malfoy said, fisting his hands on his hips. “I can’t examine it in that state.”
Harry could feel all the blood leaving his face as he stared at the penis in Arthur's hand. The very familiar penis in Arthur's hand. "Harry? Do I give a statement or just leave this with the other penises on your desk?"
He frowned, picking up the box and wandering to the lift, stepping on and then off again automatically when it reached Level 2.
Rosemary’s laugh echoing down the hallway really didn’t bode well for him. Harry looked down at the thick stack of parchment he held in his hand and sighed.
as reasons for it. It probably wasn’t a coincidence that when the new fountain went up, all the other figures were identical to the ones that’d stood there previously, except for the wizard. The new wizard’s face bore a striking resemblance to Bartram.
"What?" Ginny looked across to where Ron was once again laughing and Hermione carefully studying her glass. Then there was a thump, and Ron jumped, reaching for his leg.
He'd finished his tea and fifteen pages of parchment when he heard a commotion just outside the department. He poked his head out of his office and then went to join Rosemary, who was standing in the department doorway, watching whatever was going on in MLE.
Malfoy huffed a sigh, wiggling out of his trousers and pants, and kicking them off his ankles. "Oh, please. I've been sending you cocks by way of flirting and you're
"Cheer up, Potter." Malfoy gave him something that actually looked like a genuine smile. "We'll always have St Mungo's.”
Which was utterly mad. And Harry thought maybe he should be annoyed at how much time Malfoy had made him waste over the past couple of months. But, especially knowing Malfoy’s stance on unnecessary paperwork in general, there was something undeniably sweet about him suffering through stacks of pointless forms just for the excuse of spending time with Harry.
"You're needed, I'm afraid," he said, and had the decency to sound apologetic about it. That alone set Harry more on edge than the fact he'd been summoned to the meeting in the first place. "If you'll follow me?"
“I know the rules, you wanker,” Harry said. He threw a teaspoon at Ron’s head and missed. “I was rat-arsed, I’m not stupid. It’s not like I Apparated into Mr Smythe's bathroom on purpose. And anyhow, I was off-duty. What I do in my personal time shouldn’t have consequences at work.” He scowled at where the spoon had landed against one of the skirting boards. “It’s entirely unfair.”
The idea of someone coming in to investigate what sounded like an entire horde of angry bees and instead discovering Harry with six erect penises on his desk filled him with panic. On the heels of that came the horrified realization that although by some miracle he’d thus far avoided discovering exactly how realistic the penises were when they ‘came,’ if the vibrations kept up much longer Harry was going to find out firsthand.
“Your kicked-crup expression doesn’t make this any less funny, Potter,” Malfoy said, laughing a little. “Sorry.”
"And Rosemary just stood there behind Mrs Periweather and laughed at me the whole fucking time. Kind of like you, you arsehole." Harry aimed another kick under the table, this time
Harry waited for him to go on, for some snide comment or subtle dig about their past history. But it never came. Malfoy just stated the facts calm as could be and turned back to his paperwork.
Harry burst out laughing as Ron and Hermione turned equal shades of red, and took a large gulp from his pint. Ginny cackled, rubbing her hands together, looking ready to take the piss out of them both for the foreseeable future when Seamus walked up, plopping down next to Ginny and shoving her tight against Harry. "Hey, mate. How goes Apparition?"
Malfoy made a noise of frustration, grabbing great handfuls of Harry's hair and pulling him in again, and then it was the dizzying feel of Harry’s tongue against Malfoy's, of gasping breaths, of never having enough air. Shutting Malfoy up like this was markedly better than listening to him be an arsehole, and Harry made a mental note to do it more often. Frequently, as Malfoy was guaranteed to always be an arsehole.
Harry didn’t see how informing him, ‘That had penis on it,’ could possibly do anything even remotely useful for their working relationship. Sometimes ignorance was bliss, wasn't it? He coughed once, awkwardly. “Er. Never mind. Thought it was slipping.”
"Mrs Periweather is a breeder of champion kneazles." Harry went on, ignoring them. "Every Tuesday, she has an appointment with Pretty Kneazle Boarding and Grooming in Surrey."
He glanced over to see that Seamus had flipped open the evidence folder, looking at the card that'd come with the Vicious Cockmonster, and Harry snatched it out of his hands.
"I'm testing its reactions," Malfoy said calmly, like tickling disembodied penises was something he did every day. Harry had briefly considered studying to become a Healer after the War, when he'd wondered if joining the Aurors was really what he wanted to do with his life. For a short time, he'd thought that it might be nice to help heal people instead. In this moment he was suddenly very glad he hadn't.
"Splinching. Don't know who, but we just got a report of pieces found at the Apparition Point beside Gringotts. We'll need to collect them and take them to St Mungo's. Check for anyone missing bits, and get a Healer from Spell Damage to sign off on form 68-J." Rosemary flapped an inch-thick stack of parchment at him. "And by that, I mean you."
“I ought to write in the Wily Willie one,” Malfoy said, pulling a pair of exam gloves from the box on the counter. He was still smiling.
The masochistic penis bobbed in place, and Harry was so done with this. He took the shade off his lamp and dropped it on top of it so at least he didn’t have to look at the fucking thing. He hoped it’d go down soon. He sighed and slid his fingertips up beneath his glasses to rub tiredly at his eyes.
to become common knowledge, I suggest you set a good precedent here.” He and Ron stared at each other for a moment, then Harry laid down his trump card. “I’m not above spreading around pages of form 68-J. You know how Malfoy feels about gingers.”
“I can’t wait to hear what Seamus thinks of this,” was all Ron said as he attempted to stifle his laughter.
Because, oh my god, Malfoy was wanking a cock at him and Harry was in no way prepared to deal with any of this.
"Yeah, what are they doing there now? Is Twycross back?" Ron glanced around as if Twycross was going to pop out from behind a cock or something.
I would get this! You had to know I would guess. It was all boxed up in the Ministry. You changed the card!"
On the bright side, if it was worse, he’d probably get to hear Malfoy laugh about it. When he wasn’t being cruel, Malfoy had a surprisingly nice laugh. He’d heard it quite a lot this week, as the flirting had kept up as well. It was still a little weird to Harry, because it was
was just unfair. The look on Kingsley’s face darkened and intensified, and Harry’s protests died in his throat. “Right. Rosemary.”
Harry woke up late and in a state of mild panic from the nightmare he’d had. He’d been back in Hogwarts at the end of his first year, working his way through the puzzle rooms to get at the Sorcerer’s Stone. Except when he went into the room with the flying keys, they were all cocks. Hundreds upon hundreds of tiny winged cocks zipping through the air, and Harry had to collect all of them for evidence. Then, in that strangely seamless way that dreams did, the room shifted and became the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, the flock of cocks became one giant penis that chased him tenaciously through the air and ejaculated fire when it got close.
Malfoy lowered the cock a fraction. “Are you serious?” he demanded. “Potter. You brought this to me wrapped in a newspaper.”
And fuck, but Malfoy's hand felt perfect, tight and smooth and oh god Harry was lost. Completely lost. He leaned in, kissing Malfoy frantically, knowing he was too close for anything but sloppy, breathless, gasping kisses. Malfoy's hand was tight on his cock, his other was gentle, cradling his head. Malfoy pulled back, pressing Harry's head firmly against his shoulder and murmuring in his ear. "Come on. Come on." And Harry was helpless to resist. Malfoy's words and hands pulled his orgasm from him, unraveling him like a thread.
“You’re joking, aren’t you? Malfoy, that thing is covered in silver and gold glitter and shooting rainbow sparks. I may not be a Healer, but I’m pretty sure it’s not real.” He shrugged. “Hitting it only works for a little while. You should get your exam done before it starts up again.”
Fuck. It was no wonder he missed Malfoy. The case was nothing but a frustration. And not that Malfoy wasn't frustrating, but he was exciting as well. And when he was staring at the line of penises on his desk, it was frustrating and boring. And it was amazing how much he could miss Malfoy in just a single day.
Hermione sighed. "Yes, all right." She approached the desk, bending down to examine the first dick. "These are very realistic. They behave normally?"
, with a new cock in my hand. And you fucking planned it all, the flirting, everything else, for what? Just to fuck with me?"
With that, she turned around and strode off, head held high and somehow managing to look regal and imposing even with a box full of cocks, her march down the corridor accompanied by a loud buzzing and bright bursts of sparks. Halfway to the door, slightly tinny notes of ‘God Save the Queen’ echoed back to Harry and Ron. Hermione didn’t even flinch.
what about our situation could be seen as Pavlovian." And the bastard gave the cock another wank, and Harry didn't know if he wanted to laugh or punch him or snog him until he couldn't see straight.
He then proceeded to ignore the entire conversation. He didn't even care anymore. When he waved at the barman for another pint, Hermione was repeating the rant about Bartram and nepotism that she'd probably been building up to deliver in his office earlier. Letting her words wash over him, nodding in the gaps, was something he'd mastered years ago, and he concentrated on drinking his pint.
Later. He’d take a look at the report after he got back to his office. Not because he cared what Malfoy thought of this newest cock. But because it was his job. As an Auror. A temporarily displaced Auror, but Harry prided himself on his solid work ethic. In fact, he should probably read over all the other forms as well. Not that Harry particularly cared to hear Malfoy’s opinions on the other two cocks. Because Harry didn’t care about Malfoy’s opinions on
Rosemary shook her head. "It's office policy that we hold onto any items left at Apparition Points for 60 days." She dropped an intimidatingly thick stack of parchment onto Harry's desk with a thump that made the cock wobble. "Fill those out and then box it up and take it over to Lost and Found." She jerked her thumb down the hallway. "Last door on the left."
It was a rhetorical question, but Hermione piped up, “Oh yes, it’s one of the things the Ministry really ought to change. I’ve written several letters about it to the Wizengamot already, but now that you’re working in Apparition yourself, perhaps we could—”
that I made sure you have multiple copies of mine?" Malfoy paused and raised his eyebrows. “And need I remind you that mine liked you best?”
“Yes,” Malfoy said, disabling the Shield Charms with a sharp slash of his wand. “In any case, here’s your paperwork, and here’s your…
Harry wasn't sure if he was lucky or not that Molly called everyone to the table. He knew he wasn't when, as he sat down, Ginny piped up with, "So, Harry? How's Apparition treating you now? I've heard so many interesting things about your new juris-DIC-tion."
Harry gladly fired a stunner at the stupid cock, finally breathing a sigh of relief when it drooped off the edge of the table, dangling limply.
"I didn't wait. She Flooed back to inform me it was time to pick them up and take them home again three hours later."
He stood a moment, staring down at it and concentrating on his breathing. He was uncertain if he was more likely to chuck the stupid thing into the wall or break into hysterical laughter. Because there was a dick in a box waiting for him. There. On the floor.
Malfoy laughed at that, loudly at first, and then a lingering chuckle as he set the penis back down on the table and grabbed the stack of forms. "All right. Yes I am, rather. But your face..."
Harry frowned at Hermione, cheerfully eating her salad. "It was Ron's birthday! How was I supposed to know when it would be out?"
The Spell Damage waiting room had a lot of posters lining the walls, cheerfully recommending that witches and wizards ought to practice safe spellcasting.
“Sorry,” Harry said, not sounding sorry in the slightest and also not caring enough to even try. “I thought we were stating the bloody obvious. The hat is not a Containment Receptacle. I am primary on this stupid bloody case. This is form 68-J. We are both standing in St Mungo’s.”
Harry gave a mental sigh of relief as he tucked the card safely away in his case file. He couldn't imagine the nightmare it'd be if Seamus and Ron found out about the hands-free options detailed in the instructions. That was the absolute last thing Harry needed.
"I'm sorry, sir. My head…" Harry winced a little to get his point across when the throbbing headache made finishing the sentence feel more trouble than it was worth.
For the first time since this whole mess had begun, Harry hoped Malfoy would be the Healer on duty. This whole thing was horrible, and the one small sliver of silver lining in all of it was that he got to drag Malfoy into all this horribleness right along with him.
He leaned back, holding his pint defensively. "Nothing really to spill. Apparition got called for a Splinching because the toys are
"Okay, one, it's not a sex toy collection, and it just sounds dirty when you say it like that. It's part of an open investigation, and as such I cannot comment directly. Two, if you're going to take the piss out of me about the cocks on my desk, you need to provide me with a lot more beer first."
Flirting. This was definitely flirting. From Malfoy. At Harry. Malfoy was flirting at Harry and Harry had no idea what to do with it. Was Malfoy fucking with him again? What if Harry responded in kind and it turned out Malfoy was just making fun of him? Or, what if he was serious and Harry ignored it, and then Malfoy thought he wasn’t interested? Which would actually be worse?
Harry blinked, realizing the scuff was no longer in his eyeline, replaced by Kingsley's annoyed face. "Sir?"
Harry was required to stun it three more times over the course of Malfoy's examination, just because every time he opened his mouth, it perked right back up again and continued its attempts to reach him. It put a damper on the whole flirting thing, because Malfoy was getting obviously annoyed by the second perk-up.
The spell released in a backlash of energy and the cock exploded off the table, slammed against the ceiling, bounced back down to ricochet off a Shield Charm protecting the exam table, and hurtled straight at Harry.
“The last one,” Harry ground out, “was a bloody monster. Of course anything else looks small compared to it.” Malfoy’s eyebrows arched as he gave Harry a skeptical look, and Harry huffed out a breath. “I’m just saying,” he muttered. “It’s not really a fair comparison.”
to great effect, but Harry thought he’d keep that bit of information to himself. Seamus deserved it.
"Insufficient Deliberation." Rosemary nodded sagely, taking a large slurp of tea. "It always fucks with Destination. But look on the bright side, you're the biggest non-Splinching incident to hit the Department in the last decade. You'll be the stuff of legend until something better comes along."
Harry, who had been staring a hole through the side of Hermione’s head, turned back to Ron. “More ridiculous than sticking an Auror with it?”
Harry's thoughts skidded to a halt, because "Hermione? What the fuck does Hermione have to do with this?"
The worst part of it was that he couldn’t say anything about it. Even if the thought of admitting to Malfoy that the cock lying on the exam table was an exact replica of Harry’s own didn’t make him want to sink through the floor, it’d only motivate Malfoy to be about a thousand times more obnoxious about it. Oh god, the commentary. The mere thought of what Malfoy might say made Harry cringe. Nope, there was nothing for it. Harry was forced to stand aside and suffer in silence.
"What's up?" Harry whispered to Rosemary as he took in the frantic scrambling of blue and red robes.
Harry shrugged. “So. Funny story. I sort of lost the Containment Receptacle as I was retrieving this one and had to improvise.”
Reluctantly, Harry clambered to his feet and trailed along behind him into MLE and the briefing room.
"I'm not wearing gloves." Harry grinned and reached out, giving it a poke, and watched it bob in Malfoy's grasp. Malfoy huffed a sigh as Harry batted his hand away, finally grabbing his cock and giving it a tug. “It’s a very nice specimen. Lovely proportions. Couldn’t ask for a nicer looking cock, really.”
"No!" Harry decided then and there that his idea of keeping Malfoy quiet through snogging was the right one, and proceeded to do just that. Malfoy speaking, hell Malfoy
Back in his office, he set his lunch and his drink down on his desk, then carefully slid the cock out of the bag so it sat on the edge of his desk beside the other five.
Too late. Hermione’s mouth pursed into a firm line and her chin came up and her brows drew together.
Rosemary smirked. "Get out of here if you want me making excuses for you. And you owe me breakfast in the morning. I want something yummy."
“You always make the front page,” Malfoy pointed out dryly. “But at least this way they’d have to blur out the hand holding it.”
nsure the product never comes into contact with coriander, as that may disrupt the charmwork and cause it to behave erratically.
His suspicions only grew when he was called to collect another cock just a few days later, and found that it was an exact duplicate of the last.
"Wilkie is currently recovering from Spattergroit, and will be retiring after this year, anyway." Kingsley shot him a stare that quickly turned foreboding. "Think of it as training in case you need to stay in Apparition
“Come on,” Ron said, nudging Harry’s arm. “Let’s go see Kingsley so you can sign off on the transfer, and then I’ll get you caught up on the break-ins case.”
Luckily, Tuesday was apparently a slow time at the Museum, at least that morning, and Harry made his way quickly to the cock waiting for him. On a bench. Someone had apparently assumed it was an exhibit and set a little gate around it. Otherwise, it was perfectly normal, unfamiliar; Harry didn't trust it, but thought that nothing could possibly top what had already happened.
No such luck, then. And Pansy was like a barnacle: sticking tenaciously where she was least wanted, and sharp enough that he had to be plenty careful in getting rid of her. And, oh. Now she was giving him a look like she could tell that he was drawing unflattering comparisons to sea creatures, and Harry was almost afraid she knew what he was thinking. She couldn’t, could she? He was mostly certain she didn’t know Legilimency.
Malfoy scowled a little bit and jabbed the cock again with his quill. “The coriander in the vindaloo must have interacted with the enchantments on the.” He broke off, glancing down at the cock which had twitched hard enough to tip out of the box entirely and was now slowly buzzing its way toward the edge of the table. Malfoy hit it with a Stasis Spell and it froze in place. Harry’s ears rang a bit in the sudden silence. Malfoy gave the cock another glance and sighed. “The enchantments on the specimen,” he finished.
It was amazing what being confronted with an unnaturally accurate replica of one’s own genitalia did, motivationally speaking.
He glanced around the room, but everyone seemed to be staring at him. He lifted the lid, and peered inside at… well.
It was almost a surprise when Malfoy's hands left his hair, trailing around his shoulders to begin wiggling in to work at the clasps of his robes. Harry pulled back, gasping what felt like his first full breath in ages, and dazedly took stock of the situation.
"Yeah, because that's so much more subtle. I'll stick with the naked cocks, thanks. I'm hoping they scare Mrs Periweather off when she comes by on Tuesday."
The Apparition Point had been closed off, and after the pleasant quiet of the empty street, the noise and bustle of the hospital's lobby was almost a shock.
A few minutes later, Malfoy swept into the exam room. He came up short when he caught sight of the flowers.
Which was of course when his Floo chimed and the Ministry Welcome Witch's voice carried through his flat: "Auror Potter, please report to Apparition
“Potter,” Malfoy said, his face suddenly very sympathetic as he reached out and touched his fingertips to Harry’s forearm. “Are you defending it? Do you… feel
Harry shrugged again and yanked his robe away with a flourish. The sparklepenis tumbled out and landed heavily on the table, glittering brightly in the harsh light of the exam room. When it struck the table, it began shooting sparks again. Thankfully it landed aimed away from Malfoy. Malfoy was already in a mood today. Harry didn’t want to know what he’d do to Harry if the penis had shot sparks directly at him.
"Poor bastards," Harry said, suddenly feeling a lot more cheerful about his own mound of unnecessary paperwork, though he did feel a little bad for Ron and Seamus. When a Member of the Wizengamot came down to MLE, everyone in the department got caught up in the ensuing storm. Drinks would probably be on Harry, next pub night. Which, even that thought cheered him because it meant that someone else's life was currently worse than his.
“Sorry,” he muttered as the doors opened on floor three and he elbowed his way out, fleeing the lift as fast as he possibly could without resorting to knocking anyone over. “Sorry, ‘scuse me, sorry.”
Rosemary stopped talking and peered at him. "You've got that blank stare thing going. You had your tea yet?"
"Okay. But. Why?" he asked, unable to help himself as Malfoy gave the penis another tickle, got another twitch, and used the quill to jot down a few notes on the stack of paperwork.
So when he got the memo that another cock had been discovered on Friday, dread settled like a stone in the pit of Harry’s stomach because if it was another CopyCock, it would almost certainly be worse than the last.
The slip of parchment had been tucked away beneath the Cockmonster’s rather impressive set of bollocks, and Harry spared a moment’s thought to be grateful that Bartram obviously hadn’t removed the cock from the box and discovered it, otherwise that meeting would’ve been a lot worse. Harry didn’t even want to think of Bartram’s outrage if he’d seen it.
Harry tried to kick her and whacked his ankle painfully against the leg of her chair. “Fuck,” he sighed. He really should stop trying to do that. He should stop assuming that anything today would go right.
proclaimed another in a cheerful red font, just above a cartoonish illustration of a sad wizard standing some distance away from his left arm, a pint glass still clutched in its hand, while a group of horrified Muggles looked on. That struck a little close to home for Harry, so he studied the floor tiles until it was his turn at the desk.
“Word’s come down from on high,” Ron said. “They’re transferring the case to the Unspeakables. Ridiculous, if you ask me, wasting resources like that.”
“Fine, fine,” Malfoy said, putting it back down on the exam table. “But I really did have a point. It’s not just sensitive; it’s only sensitive when it’s near
. When he dumped it out onto the exam table, he found that it’d gone mostly hard just from being carried around. “Well.”
Malfoy shot him a glare, annoyance quickly overwhelming the amusement. "I am aware of the forms needed to do my job, Potter."
"That they enchanted? It's got…" and Harry leaned in, glancing around the office. He lowered his voice because he knew if word got out, he’d never see the end of it. "It's got
Malfoy turned away, wanked the cock. Turned back to Harry and wanked the cock. Turned away again. Harry had no idea what he was doing and was a little afraid to ask.
"Completely. Er, well, they've got a hands-free keyword, but that lasts three hours. And that's not really
Unfortunately for Harry, the pattern continued. Every three or four days, a new cock would appear, looking identical to the one before it. And each one was increasingly friendly toward Harry and Harry alone. And, oddly enough, so was Malfoy. Harry hadn’t had a good argument with him in… well, it’d been about a week, now. Maybe two weeks? Harry honestly couldn’t quite recall when the last time he’d had a good fight with Malfoy had been.
Harry didn't miss the way Rosemary flinched back half a step. "Yes?" she said, voice remarkably steady when her posture said she’d rather like to flee.
Harry took his time making the trip down to the canteen and then back, two paper cups in hand. He stopped in the lobby to have a bit of a chat with Muriel, then took the lifts back up to Spell Damage where he nodded to the Mediwitch on duty at the desk and went down the hall to the exam room. Balancing the cups precariously in one hand, he opened the door and had just enough time to register the faint glimmer of Shield Charms before Malfoy hit the cock with a
As the next week progressed uneventfully, Harry found himself growing more and more worried. The sudden lack of cocks made him anxious, he found. Ron told him he ought to be glad of it. Gave him a friendly clap on the shoulder at the pub and suggested the case might be over. No more cocks. (Seamus didn’t even bother trying to hide his disappointed look at that. “No more cocks,” he’d echoed desolately, and Ron gave him a clap on the shoulder too and said, “Cheer up, I’m sure something else ridiculous will happen to Harry soon. That’s how his life works.”)
Harry threw a balled-up piece of parchment at him. “Shut up. It is. That’s the only reason for how awful the whole thing is. My evidence going missing. The lack of clues.”
And they burst into laughter again, and Harry just sighed and sipped his tea. "Speaking of cocks, feel ready to release your fucking Sticking Charm? That's evidence you're tampering with, you know."
He hated it when she started using all those big words at him. It reminded him, "Your bloody page a day word calendar thing is a menace. Are you aware I spent my morning thinking of synonyms for 'cheerful' when I was talking to Rosemary? I think she thought I was on Forgetfulness Potions."
realistic. Malfoy knows because Ministry bureaucrats require potential Splinchings to be signed off by a Healer. Malfoy's just been the one on shift."
"You sound like Hermione,” Harry grumbled. “And pretty much everyone else but Kingsley." Personally, Harry suspected Kingsley shared everyone’s views, but was prevented from actually voicing any of them for the sake of professionalism.
Harry took a closer look at the cock on the ground. George was right. It was… sparkly. Not just glistening slightly, but covered with silver and gold glitter. "Oh, what the fuck?"
Malfoy laughed again. "If you were going to strangle me, you would have done it in the initial burst of indignation."
“Don’t look at me,” Harry grumbled. “I’ve only just transferred to Apparition. I hardly know anything about what goes on there.”
Malfoy swallowed again, his adam's apple bobbing, and Harry was abruptly aware of how close he was standing. That realization was quickly followed by another: that he didn't know what he wanted more, to punch Malfoy or snog him until he begged for mercy.
The wizard shuffled some papers around on his desk. “And as we said in each of those memos, we’ll contact you when we have more information regarding…” He frowned down at the paper.
“Cheer up, mate,” Ron said with a level of cheerfulness that made Harry, what with his departmental transfer and his hangover and his pitiful lack of a decent cup of tea, sort of want to hit him. “They’ve probably got tea down in Apparition.”
Ron shrugged. “Guess not. But when it was you, it was funny. Anyhow, I figure Bartram’s still kicking up a fuss about it. Must’ve been whinging an awful lot to get the case kicked over to the Unspeakables.”
"Nope, it's true." Rosemary cut in. "If you check the minutes, he's voted against the last seven motions to reduce paperwork. Got a cousin in charge of Boring Archives, Records & Filing."
The only bright point in his day was reading through Malfoy’s commentary about the cocks on the forms he’d filled out. Despite his cracks about Harry’s cock being small (which, it wasn’t, it was a perfectly respectable size, thank you very much) the rest of his descriptions were surprisingly complimentary. ‘Exceedingly well-formed specimen,’ he’d written. And Harry couldn’t say why exactly he was so pleased about that.
"Potter!" Pansy looked up as he slid onto the bench, and grinned at him. "I've been hearing rumors...."
The new penis waiting for Harry at King's Cross a week later looked different than the previous seven. It looked different from
"All right…?" Harry noticed the Cock Casefile open on his desk, and glanced around. Seamus didn't seem to have done anything, and he crept further in, towards the Bad Cock Corner.
Back at the Ministry, he settled in at his desk. He sat the newest cock in line beside the other two and took a moment to pray that he’d crack this case before he ran out of space on his desk. He finished up his request for Magical Analysis on the note that had been sent to Bartram and sent it off to be processed, then pulled out a blank sheet of parchment and began to make notes.
“Really, Potter?” he asked, raising his eyebrows. “You’re going to give the Mediwitches all sorts of ideas about us, bringing me flowers at work like this.”
Malfoy blinked. "She… She ordered the cock. For Bartram. I knew she ordered it of course, and in exchange for keeping it quiet, she used her position in the Unspeakables to ensure the business wouldn't be traced to me." And after an obvious examination of Harry's face. "You… didn't know?"
At least they’d waited til mid-morning to summon him to the Ministry to fetch the latest Splinching. He’d had a bit of a lie-in and a leisurely breakfast, so it certainly could have been worse.
The best thing about being transferred to Apparition, Harry thought to himself while lying flat on his back in bed, with the sunlight peeking through the curtains, was that while he was technically on-call on the weekends, he wasn't on shift. That meant Saturday and Sunday were pretty much guaranteed to be for lie-ins until May.
“Don’t mention it,” Harry said, fervently meaning just that. Offering to fetch tea for Malfoy, and Malfoy acting grateful for it. It was bizarre enough to make his head explode.
It didn't do anything, which was not at all comforting. Harry had learned to be wary of things that looked innocent. And also of things that looked unusual. It occurred to him that this case might be making him a touch paranoid.
Ron and Seamus would doubtless be by later in the morning to see it. Put it through its paces. Harry snickered to himself as he grabbed his quill and slid the first page of parchment closer.
Harry could feel his vocabulary turning right off, as his brain abruptly shifted to small words. Like 'cock' and 'wank' and 'Malfoy' and really his entire relationship with Malfoy and cocks was just "Pavlovian."
He was jostled out of his reverie when Ron thumped him on the shoulder. "Why are we talking politics? Why aren't we talking about the fact that Harry's got not one but
your friend, Harry. Which is why I'm calling you on your bullshit." Hermione pointed her fork at him, lettuce dripping a bit of vinaigrette back into her bowl. "Suck it up and take your punishment. You've no one to blame but yourself."
When he reached the front of the queue, Harry made sure he had a firm hold of both box and paperwork, and Flooed to Gringotts. He stumbled out of the Floo, ignored the look the nearest Goblin gave him as he tracked soot across the shining marble floor, and headed outside to the Apparition Point round the side of the building.
“It’s my understanding they’re for Splinched body parts, not sex toys,” Harry said, feeling a bit silly even as he protested, because mismanagement of office supplies wasn’t something he’d ever concerned himself with before.
“Second year, I think,” Harry said. “She went on a kick about expanding her vocabulary. Went straight through the whole thing, cover to cover. Took her about four days.”
And then he stood and made his escape, heading straight for the tearoom where he found Ron stirring sugar into his cup of tea. He looked up when Harry walked in.
"No idea. Member Bartram came stomping in from the lift about five minutes ago. Straight to Kingsley's office. MLE's been like a kicked bee's nest ever since."
“Coriander,” Malfoy corrected absently as the cock began to flop and wriggle its way nearer to Harry. “What on earth is it trying to do?”
Which was true, unfortunately. That was exactly how Harry’s life worked, which was why this sudden normalcy left him on edge.
A glimmer of light caught Harry’s eye, and he turned quickly to see ripples fading from the surface of his drink, though he didn’t think he’d bumped the desk. Frowning a little, he held himself very still and quiet, watching warily, but nothing more happened. Probably just his eyes playing tricks on him. It’d been a long week, after all. He ate another bite and picked up his paperwork again.
