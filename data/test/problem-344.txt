“I think you’re going to have to admit that he didn’t do it, Harry,” Hermione said, kissing him on the head and then grabbing her bag from Ron, who stood up to follow her to the Floo with a shrug.
He dropped his arm and chuffed, not quite able to use humour to deflect fully the pain that shot through him at that slight hesitation. Potter softened.
“Well, I should fucking think so,” Hermione replied darkly. “You should be getting passing marks just from standing in class upright every day.”
“You know, strong enough. Strong when you need to be, but plenty stubborn too,” Draco said, taking a step away from the counter. "I'm sure of it. That's you to a tee."
He offered Harry his hands, knowing better by now than to touch him without invitation in the midst of an attack. Harry gratefully took both Draco's hands in his own and focused on his concerned face, the pace of his breath, trying to slow down his thoughts. Finally, he the beat of his heart calmed and felt the immediate exhaustion take hold, so different from the general tired he always felt now. Instead, his head rolled down, his neck no longer stable enough to hold it up. His eyelids drooped, his muscles relaxing.
“Alright, love?” a kind lady said behind him. “You forget the pattern? No worries, think Tom changed it this month. Here, let me.”
"I just… don't know if I can do it anymore,” he said sadly. “The weight of you needing me, it's just pressing me down too much. I love you, and I don't know if I ever won't, but I just can't be the only thing keeping you alive anymore. I can't be the only reason you're still here. If I don't leave now, I think it's going to kill both of us."
“Harry,” he said gently, making Harry pause. “Go see George. He has a big box of things for you. To give to the family.”
Pansy gripped his shoulder gently. "Well, since you’re spending more time with him these days, given how much you've been talking about him in your letters lately?"
witnessed a creature quite like the ones that surrounded their little party, dashing about from left to right.
It's all going down in this chapter. Trigger warning. There is nothing super violent or graphic, but please proceed forewarned. Its a long one, because breaking it up would be mean. But I also promise the story does not end here.
He carried the mug of tea the kettle produced with him, ignoring the growl in his stomach in favour of getting started. Breakfast would just end up in a waste bin. There was no point in wasting time. He stood in front of the door for so long that the redwood started to form swirling patterns. The tea might have grown cold had this not been the mug that Draco had charmed to stay warm for five hours once heated. Finally, he told himself out loud how ridiculous he was being and pushed open the door.
Draco moved about his days in that first week of classes in the sort of daze he had experienced only once before; his world view had shifted, a tilt that made him feel rather discombobulated. Fortunately, he didn’t see Potter for the first three days. Unfortunately, he had no idea how to feel about that.
The first person he ran into in the street looked at him like he was insane when he asked about this Digone Alley place he needed to find, and hurried off with his shopping with nothing more than a few fervent glances backwards.
“You always say ‘work out the rest’ in the same tone you say a spell, do you know that?” Draco sighed and sat up off of Harry’s shoulder, holding the ring box as though it might explode. Harry reached over and opened it for him, showing off the black brushed tungsten-and-rose-gold ring that was inside. Draco exhaled and lifted the ring from the box, inspecting it.
It was so tempting. Tempting to just lean in and let go, let the story be written here instead of two weeks ago. But the small jolt in his stomach reminded him why he was not going to do that, and he took a step back.
“Look,” Neville interjected. “I’m sorry, alright? Is that why I’m here? I’m sorry for the...spores. And the...everything after.”
There had been a time when he had been the same, wary of strangers. Or, really anyone who wasn’t his cats. Larry with his Mohawk. Meg with her bizarre meow. Triage, named after this near-death collusion into Draco’s life. These three had made a cohesive team against the world, and they occasionally tolerated Draco. Since he himself had always felt barely tolerable, their relationship worked out very well.
. He met a lovely half-blood witch named Agatha who Draco and Harry met at Christmas the following year, and they never brought up the banks again. Partly because it was embarrassing and unfair, given that many hexes and curses left their victims memory-less. The Compulsion had not been one of them. Avery the senior died before he could learn of his son’s betrayal of the ancient blood, and Draco’s mother gave Carl away at his wedding in Massachusetts the following March.
"Alright, Potter? You said you needed to speak to me?" Kingsley asked, dragging Harry’s attention back to the room.
Barging in without a real plan was a Harry Potter speciality, but even he could admit to himself that he wasn’t sure what he was trying to accomplish here; there was no way he was getting information on another person’s account, especially not an old family. He wasn’t stupid. But at the same time, the glimmer of hope Pansy had provided was making him a bit drunk. He’d spent the last six months in utter misery, convinced he had broken apart the only thing that had ever really started to make sense. If Draco’s fleeing hadn’t really been his fault, if Carl wasn’t really the cause of any of their current unhappiness, then maybe the Goblins would give him what he needed.
He stood up again, even though Harry was sure he'd only been sitting a moment. He watched him head back toward the door.
“But of course, the famous Potter,” Astoria finally said, offering a delicate hand to Harry, who kissed it like it was 1902. She laughed politely, but the smile did not reach her eyes.
As he turned the corner to head up the west side-street, a flash of something in the near distance caught his eye. Initially, he’d assumed it was just a rogue coin or wrapper in the cobbles and he’d continued on his way. When it happened again, however, he turned more quickly and saw that the glint was coming off a tall figure in a dark coat. A tall figure in a dark coat, dark trousers, but with shining, too-long, silver-blonde hair. There wasn’t even really thought before Harry leapt to the side of the street and watched the figure get slightly further away, studying it from a distance. There was little doubt about it, though. The furtive, cautious figure was
around him. And you want me to waltz into his life and say, ‘hey, Harry Potter, fancy a chat about the worst year of your life, with me, a man you hate? Oh, and by the way, I got you the job because I was trying to apologise, not so I could have some sort of delayed revenge’?”
He picked a pair of horribly off-coloured green antlers and headed towards the cash. The overly crowded shop had way too many shelves piled into every corner and he was in too much of a bad-morning induced haze to pay much attention; it didn’t surprise him, as a result, when he walked straight into a pram.
*please forgive my French. It is dodgy at the best of times, and isn't going to get better by impersonating an aristocrat. I'll try to limit the French. Please, don't tell me how many mistakes I made. I did my best ;) **
He followed them at a clipped pace, even when they walked through a brick wall and he found himself facing the garden of a very shitty looking pub.
Harry flushed slightly but he grinned. “Honestly? It’s mostly breakup food. I figured emotional eating is emotional eating, regardless of the cause.”
When Draco emerged from the shower twenty minutes later, he found a much more civilised Potter on the other side of the door. It was more than the fact that he’d changed into a proper shirt and dark, fitted jeans. There had been a subtle shift in attitude as well. He seemed calmer, more resigned to the day. Draco understood the reaction to dealing with Gerard, particularly when the interaction happened during the daylight, while sober. That wasn’t how Gerard was meant to be encountered.
. Harry supposed that if you were going to run a business of questionable practices, then high street advertisements were hardly going to be the norm. Still, it would have been nice to have just a bit of light.
She shook her head but did stop talking, in favour of holding out the reindeer pyjamas she'd just pulled down from the shelf. He took them, scanned them, and threw them in the box to the left.
The point, he supposed, of a Compulsion, was that they played with the right emotions. They balanced themselves into the psyche quickly and solidly, making it completely indistinguishable from the real emotions. By the time he’d started feeling the flu-like symptoms of a long term compulsion, Draco had already suspected something was wrong. The flat that he lived in with Carl felt
to love. You're Draco sodding Malfoy. You don't like about ninety percent of the people you meet. Just tolerating is already a feat. And from these stories you've been unintentionally telling us, you're doing way more than tolerating.”
After a moment of sitting in this pathetic tableaux, a sad smile pasted itself on Diego’s face as he let go of Draco’s hand. “You know, Draco,” he said. “You deserve to be the person you are around Harry as well.”
“It hasn’t actually been that long, you know. You ought to remember. There was a desk involved,” Draco teased. The third glass of cider culminated in the worst of his many terrible decisions over the past few months; he winked again.
daydreaming about a world in which Harry forgave him and his family for the fourth, fifth, hundredth time. He pretended that the look he'd seen on Harry's face that morning, the one full of hope and lust, had been real. He wished that Harry had all the information, because he himself had told even Pansy all the information. But it was just a fantasy.
? He’d plotted out many starts to the conversation in his mind. He never got much past the first sentence.
Draco closed his eyes tightly against the memory and let his head fall to the desk beside the largely untouched breakfast tray. He felt ill. He tried to imagine going to his father and saying he couldn’t do the meetings today because he was hungover and lovesick and acutely lonely. The thought made a pathetic giggle bubble up in his mind, imagining a world where he just owled Harry instead, met him for lunch in the little parkette he’d discovered last year.
Potter has been reclusive since the moment he joined the team. He doesn't travel to away games with them, doesn't stay in the same hotels, doesn't come to team meals. Draco thought he understood why; after all, it took him a year to be dragged away from his own ghosts and made to be human again. A year of badgering and pestering from the captains that if he wanted to be on the team, he had to learn to trust them.
Harry knew from school that Grand Openings needed direction and activities if they were going to be successful. They brought out people who had come on interest alone, and not necessarily because they were ready to spend money. He wanted to make his opening fun, but for the life of him, he couldn't work out a theme that wasn't unbearable or an immense amount of work.
. But it was clear that Draco did not plan on finishing his sentence. He was smiling a large, frighteningly fake grin, listening as 'Ed' made a fool of himself, and trying to delicately extract them both from the situation. Harry made it easier for them and fled first, leaving the cart behind just as Ginny came round the corner, visibly baulking at the scene before her.
Malfoy whirled around, shouldering his broom and storming towards Harry in such a sudden change of direction that Harry stepped back defensively on instinct alone. “Same thing you are, idiot!” Malfoy roared. “And I’d like to know
“It’s so complicated, I don’t even know where to begin,” Draco said truthfully, turning over to face the man he definitely did not deserve. What he found wounded him slightly. Diego’s face was foreign to him; it was set in a determined line, a hard crease between his eyes, a set to the jaw. Draco sat up slowly. This was definitely the start of a very difficult conversation, and it no longer felt appropriate to be lying down — even if his head was still spinning and his stomach was still in knots.
The girl stared at him for a moment, clearly attempting to decide how to react. Her mouth opened and closed a few times before she took a deep breath and said, rather calmly considering how much air she’d just taken in, “Sorry but you’re Potter and Prose right?”
“Now. If you’ll excuse me, gentlemen. Auror Weasley and his wife, and Mr Malfoy and I have a very important brunch to expense on company time.”
But the words disappeared somewhere between his brain and his mouth and he hated it, because, in that instant, he
, of all people, are here asking me about it just goes to show how insane this world has become. You’re not getting your bloody comment. Get. Out.”
Theo looked at her, shock in his features. He opened his mouth for a moment before wrapping her close and kissing her deeply.
. You do things. It's your… thing. You do things you shouldn’t be able to do. I know one hundred percent that you can do this. You just have to decide if it’s what you
Draco chuckled. “That’s the one. You know, as much as we both know I love it here, I think you saying there is a ‘history’ here is a little pretentious. It’s only been three years.”
The dinner was to take place in Temperate house; Harry was actually a bit excited. The large glasshouse loomed over them with classic Victorian overkill, and he knew the food was going to be amazing. He wandered around for a moment after disposing of his coat, taking in the greenery and bypassing the bar. It was a bit early for him to begin his four drink limit and he didn’t really feel like he needed the comfort yet. He’d always been pretty good at this, comfortable in social settings even when they should feel awkward.
like him because it feels too sudden," she insisted. "But you realise it isn't, right? You've liked him since, like, third year. Maybe fourth. I get it—those tournament robes were fucking gorgeous. And not dying from a dragon? Hot."
Neville did not immediately reply. Harry froze in the middle of the street, stopping an elderly couple behind him who tisked loudly.
“Take Diego and go home,” Potter rasped through clenched teeth. Draco stood up and tried to move towards Harry, who held up a hand. “I need...I just need you not to be here, Malfoy.”
“I think we’re no good for each other,” Draco replied, pushing food around with his fork. “Also, I don’t mean to make this…you know, awkward and everything but—”
"No fucking kidding!" Harry's voice had a complicated mix of exasperation and puppy-dog levels of excitement fighting for viable space.
Harry smiled and reached beneath the cushion. He dropped the box in Draco’s lap and smiled when Draco arched an annoyed eyebrow.
“I’ll most likely be fine,” he said in an unconvincingly chipper voice, still careening around corners as quickly as he could without drawing attention. When Draco
Harry opened his mouth, meaning to reply. He found he had no words. Instead, he reached out, pulled a paper from the pile, and picked up the spare quill that sat beside Malfoy’s inkwell. He read through the paper, correcting a few mistakes, then scrawled a small, dignified
Harry took another breath and shook his head. Draco prepared another argument and was about to launch into it when Harry suddenly reached out and took off his apron. Draco felt every nerve ending in his body jolt; he was oddly terrified, so uncertain of himself that his knees felt weak. It was a very new feeling, and he definitely did not like it. He forgot to breathe as Harry got his coat and came out from behind the counter. He nodded at Draco and held open the door. Draco walked out, taking a gasping breath in the fresh air. He tried to get a hold of himself and thought about everything all at once. He’d never actually anticipated being here, with Potter willingly striding along beside him. The entire idea was insane. He shivered, half from the cold and half from the anticipation.
of him. It’s not good enough. It’s not an apology. It’s not a reason for your trust. It’s just...all I have.”
didn't believe the words he was muttering. He felt her gentle hand on his cheek; her knuckle brushing the dark circles beneath his eyes as she clucked quietly.
Staring at himself in the mirror, he thought about Diego’s banter with Potter at the coffee shop. He thought about the nicknames and the teasing, and the self-deprecating laugh he never used at home. What did it mean that he hadn’t known any of those things were even
He cut himself off and stared holes into the parquet floor. When he finally looked back up into what he had decided was an awkward silence, he found Potter smiling in an infuriatingly calm way.
Draco chuckled and laid back down, turning to face Harry’s bed. “Think I appreciate you waking me up. Was a bad one.”
“You could—” Harry began, shaking his head as he realised what he’d been about to stay. “Never mind.”
When the doorbell rang, Draco dragged himself up out of his prone position for the first time in an hour, disgusted with his own inability to get dressed. He’d never in his
“Dunno,” Draco shrugged, petting the soft, fuzzy feathers beneath his hand and too enamoured to rise to Harry’s taunting. Just as he responded, though, Buckbeak lowered his front legs to the ground and chuffed.
“Come on,” he relented. “Let’s go find you some lovely tail before I’m forced to set you up with Daphne.”
“Oh, I’m ready,” Harry replied, stepping up to the shelf beside Draco, crowding into his space and reaching behind him. Draco inhaled sharply and felt himself collapse a little bit into his frame. But Harry just held out a large brown file folder.
“Bill, thanks for talking to me, but I’m not sure you...I don’t know if what I need to know is something you’ll have the right experience with to help me.”
Hermione’s eyes narrowed, taking stock of his story and seeming to try and line up all the evidence she had available to her.
A year sped by him; for the anniversary of their first date, Harry surprised Draco with a trip to Spain, where they had eaten their weight in spicy, sultry food, frolicked for hours on white sand beaches, and fucked like teenagers for the better part of the too-hot afternoons. That particular break from reality was incredible; Harry slept soundly for the entire week and his heart swelled at the lightness in Draco's face, which had been missing for months.
The box was one of those cheap photo storage boxes. Black, with a small brass window frame on the front for labelling the box. He lifted the lid.
In which several things are revealed, not the least of which is that Harry Potter is apparently gay now.
The Kitchen had been their saving grace; the non-profit that welcomed all regardless of background or means had been both confusing and a more than welcome reality for two Purebloods who’d been abandoned by those they’d fought to save. Living there two nights a week got them through that winter.
“Hermione, we’ve been over this. I need to stay and finish my potions assignment. I’ll be there Christmas eve.”
Harry hadn’t been at the flat in nearly three months. His manager had been trying to convince him to sell it for the better part of a year, but since Harry had always harboured this plan in the back of his mind, he’d stubbornly insisted on paying for it and the horrendously expensive property taxes the whole time he’d been on tour.
“A number?” Theo laughed. “You mean, that projection that the board creates that has never, in the history of the organization, been accurate?”
Harry argued with Hermione all the way down to London. For some reason, she had insisted they take the train. Which meant that it had taken five hours longer to get to Draco than it needed to. She’d insisted that he needed to get some more sleep, he’d insisted that there was no way he was going to be able to rest. Ginny had finally sent a
Owen had had enough. In the middle of his captor's argument, he looked wildly around the street, desperately searching for anyone who might be able to help. An officer, a strong looking bloke. Hell, a
All through his inspection, Potter stood still, right in front of the door. Draco finished the bathroom, his final place because of all the things that can go wrong in a bathroom. And Potter was still stood there.
“What are you on about, Malfoy? We all know that your ‘experience’ in the forest is hardly innocent.”
“It won’t be that long," Lucius said, shaking his head. "I can help things along. I will have my wife—”
He needed to change tactics. This was not what he’d had in mind when he’d waltzed into Draco’s office to demand he take his midnight shift on Saturday next. Of course, what came out of his mouth next hadn’t been either.
That’s what was making this so painful, really.  Love wasn’t the problem. He just wasn’t sure that was enough anymore.
He tried, for a moment, to connect the timelines of what he understood. Draco, when they had first started seeing each other, had refused to come anywhere where they may run into wizards. He’d assumed it was just Draco being skittish and afraid of prejudice. Since those were both valid reasons, he’d just let it go.
Harry smiled ruefully. “The trials where I defended you and successfully kept your questionably problematic ass out of jail? Or do you mean the ones where I testified against your father and led to him being put in Azkaban.”
No one said a word, looking at each other in such palpable discomfort that Draco had the inappropriate urge to laugh. Harry, beside him, smiled awkwardly and gave a small wave.
Ginny rushed into the kitchen, expecting to find him flat on the floor mid seizure, and burst into an amused grin when instead, she saw Harry’s stricken expression of existential crisis.
“Sure. Whatever. Get back to work, loser,” she said, laughing at him. “Or have you already carved out an entire afternoon of pining over the bloke?”
“You could take the day,” she said, strangled. It had taken her a lot to offer and it made Draco smile.
burst past his head and over the window to his left. It clearly met its mark, because the wall behind him remained unharmed.
"Right. Yes. No. Of course, it is. I'm so sorry, Draco. That is obviously... not what I meant. I just—sorry."
“I’m no good for you,” Draco spluttered. “I know…I mean, I understand what you… yesterday, you said—”
“You’ll go another day,” Draco snapped. His first name in Potter’s mouth was uncomfortable for any number of reasons, and he was currently trying desperately to be suspicious and unhappy with where he was.
He’d decided to never set foot in the place, and he’d managed quite well at first. Until he’d decided to give up the office space he’d been borrowing from the publisher, with its bland walls and silence. It wasn’t working for him; he needed to be able to people watch, to drown out chatter and focus. After a series of failed experiments in parks and public libraries, Diego had suggested he just suck it up and come to the cafe, where he could supply him with free coffee and snacks. He’d reluctantly agreed, since trying to explain why he didn’t want to be near Potter was out of the question. Yet, at that moment, he’d begun the countdown to the day when everything fell apart.
Draco had shut up. He’d kept quiet through months of planning; fewer months than most, but they didn’t want anything fancy. It wasn’t really who they were. The end of May, decided on because it was after all the anniversaries, but before the start of the birthdays. Practicality more than sentimentality, the only time that had ever been the case.
“I’ve been meaning to ask,” Draco said haltingly, trying to offer a boon. “How did you end up here. Owner, and stuff?”
He understood, in hindsight, how his friends had felt and where their distrust stemmed from. He got why they had been concerned, but he’d been furious with them at the time. When he looked at it through their eyes now, he saw the boy who had been his enemy suddenly occupying all of his time.
“Harry, I know you do. The thing you don’t know is… it's about Carl. That’s the part Pansy doesn’t...she thinks she knows. She doesn’t. Let me finish.”
They descended a staircase that Harry had never taken and hopped into a very short, very uneventful mine cart ride. They seemed to be only a level or two down, which was confusing given the vault number.
“Do you think he knows that we know he’s there, Zinzin?” Draco murmured, swinging his legs down from the window and watching the cat as it approached Harry’s trainers. “I don’t think he does, do you?”
He stumbled into the front door and locked it behind him as quietly as he could. Ron surprised him by grunting a hello from the sofa in the living room.
have come from a Weasley. He unfurled it and threw it over his legs, the part of his body attached to the frozen ground, and therefore, the least protected by his warming charms.
It’s not that it actually helped him sleep, but at least he didn’t feel phantom arms encircling him when he curled his aching joints into those uncomfortable sheets.
The man with the pointy stick and his red-headed girlfriend both whipped around, but the pretty one with the curly dark brown locks didn’t seem to need to confirm his story. Gripping her friend, who was still holding him, she dragged them all up the steps.
“You know, Zin,” Draco was saying now. “It’s not so bad being in the castle now, is it? It’s quieter, and the snow isn’t disgusting from people trampling it down on their way to the greenhouses. It’s...peaceful.”
He climbed up, bending his legs into the grooves behind Buckbeak’s wings, closing his eyes and tucking himself low, like he was on a broom. He managed to not jolt when Harry settled in behind him and gripped his waist. It was too familiar, too comfortable, too
Draco gave in. The complicated feeling of unsettled remorse that had appeared when Harry hugged him nestled down a little further on his shoulders. He reasoned that if he was going to be able to talk to anyone, at all, for the rest of the day, he was just going to have to tell Pansy.
Draco had tried so hard at first to help. He would hold onto Harry in the middle of the night, having woken up to wild thrashing or screams. He made potion after potion, trying to find the right combination of Dreamless Sleep and Calming Draught. He insisted that Harry ask for cases closer to home, and when Montgomery reluctantly agreed, Harry made Ron take on a new partner so he could stay on the difficult cases, where he was good and necessary and needed.
He collapsed to the ground beside Harry, the foot of space between them just enough that he couldn’t feel Draco’s warmth. When Harry turned his head, he found Draco’s forehead crinkled in anger. He left him to his annoyance. The feeling was familiar. After all, it had taken him
Draco is approaching comprehension when his back hits the lockers and his knees buckle and Harry's soap is in his mouth as he presses his face to Draco's neck.
He pulled the paperweight Hugo had made from it’s revered spot and packed it into his small box of ‘keep’ items. Refusing to delay and consider closer, he reached beneath the hidden ledge under the top drawer and retrieved the key. For no reason he could discern, he decided to start with the bottom drawer.
“It’s been two years, Dray,” Diego went on. “Two years of not knowing about this giant gap in who you are. Those people today... they were not fucking around,” he inhaled sharply, looking away. “I think that girl could have broken me in half. So, I think I need to know now?"
“It would seem that way,” Ron agreed. “I only discovered the issue because my new desk fell apart all of a sudden. The Pixies were just attracted to the offices because they eat them.”
That night, sleepless as usual, he remembered Collette's words and went down to the lounge. He never went to the lounge willingly, so the large, wingback chair he sat in was new to him. He immediately loved it. He was noticing more and more of these small moments of comfort. The noticing was nice. Like waking up after a long sleep. He catalogued this moment for later use, thinking that when he managed to go home, he would get a big, soft chair like this, with the back high enough to cradle his tired head, the support he wasn't aware he had needed.
Keeping it open, it would seem, was far more difficult. The first time it had happened, Draco had approached the Muggles with such fury that he’d been removed from the bank by security. Since he still didn’t have his wand at that point, he’d been utterly humiliated by how little force it had taken. Still, he’d assumed he’d made some mistakes, and the next day, he’d found a new bank and opened a new account, transferring what money he’d been able to recover into a secure box.
that he was thinking about the possibility that he and Potter's magical signatures had just attuned, meaning that the historical implications of his research may be accurate. He also hadn't hinted that Harry's secondary argument that dark magic bonded more permanently to ruins and surfaces than its counterparts felt closer than ever to true.
Draco shook his head and pulled his hand from Harry's grasp. "No, I won't put you in the middle of this. I'll go to the Aurors, tomorrow I swear. Keep yourself away from it, though."
“I’m glad to hear it,” Malfoy responded, a genuine smile gracing his delicate features and making him seem far more vulnerable.
“Draco, don’t be daft,” Harry laughed, deflating. “You’re job is important. You’re busy when you’re busy. I’m not, like, some Victorian housewife that needs entertaining. Have you been sat here all this time worrying I was mad at you? What is this, some sort of apology fancy meal?”
Harry laughed in spite of himself and, on impulse, decided to settle into the table with his tea instead of fleeing. Malfoy looked up in surprise but cleared a space for Harry and picked up his quill again.
Harry wavered between a few emotions. Finally, he seemed to settle on shared amusement. He sat down at Draco’s desk, in one of the large wingback chairs he’d stolen from his parents' house without telling them. Harry Potter looked ridiculously small in the oversized chair; when he curled his legs beneath him, dropping his bag to the floor, he looked younger and more vulnerable than Draco had seen him since they were in school. He turned in his chair back to the coffee cart quickly, hiding his reaction to the sight before he let his emotions get the better of him.
“Harry, this is your last chance. I’m taking the train now,” Hermione whined as she resettled her large book bag and bag. He took her duffle from her gently and shook his head.
Tonight, there was tension in his shoulders. What the fuck he had been thinking by inviting Draco Malfoy, king of proper and buttoned-up wit, he would never know. He held his breath through the Virgin announcement, waiting for Draco to storm out. A part of his brain did realise that as Draco was standing beside him nearly naked, there was likely more to him than he currently knew.
Draco reached up, only having just realised that he'd walked home with his jingle bell adorned felt antlers fixed firmly to his head.
. They had talked about their 17th year endlessly in the first month of their relationship out of necessity. Draco hated the marred skin on his forearm. That had been the last time Harry had kissed that skin, and the repeat of it now startled Draco into forcing Harry to turn around.
“He is, I swear. Right now, he’s shoving a half a mannequin into a very ugly reindeer sweater. Why would I lie about this.”
But finally, on the third Saturday of endless showings, Harry followed the man into a two-storey, open warehouse with bright windows that faced the river. There was a grain elevator still in a corner, holes in the floor, and beams that desperately needed reinforcement, but the bones were all he saw. He saw vaulted ceilings and sturdy floors. He saw open space and places for waiting rooms and offices.
the only important bloody thing in your life is the frigging job, which still manages to keeps you from the house for days at a time. The job that drags just a little bit more of you away each week. The job that erases any progress we've made each time you get dragged back into it. "
The Ministry never suspected a possible union between a Death Eater and The Chosen One, not even when they were married three years later; despite the presence of many Aurors, Curse-Breakers, and even elected officials at their small and intimate ceremony in the Highlands. No one asked any questions when their marriage certificate mysteriously managed to be processed without it ever leaking beyond the offices of the Magical Registrar.
“Hermione, I refuse to let you feel guilty for this,” he insisted. “Honest question, though...do you think I have any hope of him forgiving me?”
"Harry!" Draco exclaimed more concern than an actual exclamation. "What-what are you doing here…oh, wait. Do you want me to leave? I'll leave. It's okay. Don't wake the others. I tried to tell Hermione it was a bad idea and—"
“Before you yell at me,” he began, raising his hands in a quelling fashion and taking a step back to try and seem less threatening. “There’s information you don’t have.”
to look at, but in all honesty, the hatred and the brainwashing may have guarded some of his more adorable features. In the store, busy and in bad lighting, Potter’s full force was unleashed on him. He shoved his glasses up his nose, shoved his hands in his pockets too often, found a way to trip on nothing, and smiled as though it was the first time in his
She sat up suddenly and threw a pillow at him. “Okay. Enough of this. You know the whole story. Now we plan. In the meantime, I’m going to go down to Hogsmeade. Want to come?”
“What, you mean because not even a year ago you told me that you were hesitant to trust me with Harry’s happiness, despite having agreed to stand up for him at the wedding?”
The arm slung over him was possessive and warm, bundling him into Harry's side on the too-small guest bed in Hermione's house. It was too familiar, too real, too past. It was perfect.
From the tiled floor to the chipped cupboards, this room still felt like home, but when he opened the cabinet where the coffee had always been, he found plates instead and sighed.
prick,” Seamus corrected. “Who also had that whole ‘misunderstood broody heir’ thing going for him. And rich.”
Still, the rest of his shift was spent with his stomach roiling at the thought of being fired so close to Christmas, and he sent a
“Not working with me anymore,” Harry muttered, quietly enough that Draco wasn’t sure he was still a part of the conversation. “Not working with me anymore, not my fault. Is that...inside his flat. And, obviously, fine. So. Now. Yes. Now, Potter.”
Ron surveyed them both with an owl-like gaze. He shook his head. “You two go. Bring me back a latte. I’ll get started on… well, on this.”
One day, in early December, Harry ran into Malfoy in the staff room, sitting with a stack of papers. He’d cleared his throat as Harry pulled down a mug to make himself some tea, a ward against the chill of his own office.
“But that’s not really like us, is it?" Draco interrupted." The simple answer is almost never the right one, not between us.”
“Right, that’s me done for the day,” Draco whined, flopping onto the cushions on the floor beside Harry. “I can’t believe the sofa didn’t arrive on time.”
“Draco!” Lily shouted, flinging herself into his arms. He calmly caught her and smiled a beatific grin as he slung her up into his arms. The sight sent Harry’s stomach rolling, his heart racing, and his blood boiling in anger.
The tip of his wand glowed, shooting a large circle of silver light, warm and comforting, into the clearing around them. It was so large that it illuminated all the trees at the edge of the forest. Harry could even momentarily see that there were daisies in the ground by his feet.
" Draco exclaimed. "You're the one dealing with this. I've had a lot of time to, I don't know, process? Why aren't you furious. Why aren't you demanding an apology."
Draco felt himself smile, reach forward to clasp Diego’s arm. “I’m fine,” he said soothingly. “Just needed water.”
Thankfully, Draco chose this moment to arrive home; comically shocked to find Harry there, he smiled as he walked past him to put the kettle on, running his hand through Harry's hair as he went. Harry tried not to wince. These casual touches—which had once been so welcome, a reminder that he was not alone—had started to grate on him and make him cringe. He was poison, affecting the air they both breathed, and he didn't want Draco to drown as well.
Despite the knowledge that he was going to need more help at some point, Harry didn’t remember to start looking. In the chaos of finishing the work on the building, Luna filled in the gaps of his ability to do everything all at once so well that he was able to ignore the fact that she was going to leave him at some point.
Apparating straight into his bedroom never lost its thrill; it was a freedom and a loosening of a tether that disguised how confined he was. His brain wanted him to celebrate every time, but he stubbornly hung onto his anger at his family instead. Treating him like a teenager who’d been given a slightly later curfew hardly forgave them for trapping him in his own life.
“Not forever, I hope,” Harry said brazenly. He laughed when Draco blushed. “Oh goodness, Barkley. This is going to be fun, isn’t it?”
Ron shrugged. "Maybe not, but you are always looking at him like he's a piece of treacle tart.” He sniggered when Harry did, in fact, choke on his tea. “Besides. I said 'fun' not 'undying romance and soul mate’. What could be more fun than toying with a former enemy for your own gain?"
you, I don’t need to meet the new grads. They’ll be in my way any day now, just like they always are. I’d rather wait until I’m getting
; his hair was neatly combed, making the wild curls look intentional rather than insane. He wore a neat shirt, his coat open and his scarf hanging loose. He seemed to have acquired new, stylish frames for his glasses. All of this led Draco to the comforting conclusion that someone was taking care of him. Which, of course, brought his mind back to the
Or maybe in the showers, waiting for permission from the next shower stream, muttering filthy things while he palmed himaelf, daring Potter to flee. Harry would not back down, because he was Harry Potter, and Draco was sure he wouldn't deny their obvious chemical attraction. And if he stayed, Harry could have him, right there, buried deep in the base of his spine until Draco forgot his own name.
Lou nodded, looking down at her clipboard. It didn't matter. Harry had spent a lot of time studying her expressions. As he had known she would, she had immediately picked up on what he
Potter stared Draco straight in the face, and Draco let himself breathe for a moment before nodding.
“You will never speak of this to her. You jeopardize the very existence of this organisation if you do. Please tell me I do not need to remove the memory of my being here?”
"Are you sure?” Draco said, rare uncertainty creeping into his tone as he echoed Harry’s embrace. “You would tell me, right? If you needed… help." Draco was speaking so quietly now that Harry almost didn't hear the last word at all.
Sure enough, Potter’s face darkened imperceptibly. No doubt, he was reliving the night in the forest, just as he himself had been all month. It's hard to forget your first unicorn sighting anyway, but to see one the way they both had was...
Ron stood up from where he had been leaning on Draco’s replacement desk and proceeded to explain the situation. As he spoke, Harry became more and more incredulous, and Draco had to fight the urge to laugh.
uncomfortable, which was irritating him since he’d spent half an hour more convincing Draco that it wouldn’t be weird to share a tent.
Draco fought for the three days before Christmas to relax all on his own, to not need the emergency appointment he’d made with at Dr Stenhouse just in case. But, by the twenty-third, the reality was that he wasn’t sleeping. His friends all knew Christmas was usually bad for him and they were giving him lots of space; this year, leaving the castle took on some added weight that he could not yet name.
Hermione reached out and took the baby from Harry’s arms; she stirred slightly and then relaxed into sleep against her mother's chest. “So then, the question is why the hell are you sitting here right now, leaving him in agony?” she asked, laying Rose down in her cot.
The mornings were the hardest part. Returning to the world where Draco wasn’t allowed to acknowledge that he was hurting. The place beyond the deep grey of his bed-curtains was currently his least favourite of all the places he visited. Especially when the curtains were like this.
He strapped her into her backpack contraption and set out into the brisk afternoon. He didn’t let it stop him for too long that he hadn’t actually
At first, he was exhausted every time she left him alone again. The emotional pain would throw itself back on him as soon as he Apparated home. Since he'd been robbed of his wallowing time and his despondency for the day, he would take it late into the evening before passing out wherever he was from pure exhaustion.
Harry had started on the East wall first. The tower above him stood impossibly stable, and the memory of watching Dumbledore’s body fall from its edge kept him focused and determined well after all the others would leave to eat. Almost silently one random Wednesday, Draco had joined him. Side-by-side, they would lift their wands to affix brick after brick. When exhausted of magic, they would move them by hand, piling the cement glue with rudimentary tools. As dark would approach from the lee of the mountains to the North, they would stop at some unseen signal and stomp up to the castle in silence. They worked this way for two weeks.
“Um,” Draco replied, taking the plate. He was normally not at a loss for words, but here he was, once again without a script in front of Harry Potter. He honestly had no clue what was happening right now. He took a huge bite of warm scone, trying to buy himself time.
Harry smiled in response and fiddled with the fork the server had left behind. They stopped talking for a moment, studying the wider room of the very small pub they’d ended up in.
He spun to head back down the stairs, and Harry’s arm reached out of its own volition to grab his elbow. “Wait. Let me back up. I’m not here to… check on you. Or even chastise you. Not really. I’m… well, I came to apologise, actually.”
After his little moment of Travers corralling, Draco’s day went relatively smoothly. In fact, at lunch, he owled Harry and convinced him to meet at the trattoria for dinner.
It was so early that Draco wasn’t on his game. He was only half paying attention when a particularly ballsy scammer approached them. Draco could spot them a mile away. He held the string aloft, ready to tie it to Potter’s wrist. His shady partner was lurking by the railing, ready to try and distract. Draco hit autopilot, and wrapped an arm around Potter’s arm, locking his bag between them.
“Mr Potter,” she said sternly. “You are now a teacher of young, impressionable people. You have the opportunity to undo the prejudice of generations past, such as the ones that were once inflicted on Mr Malfoy. I daresay that if you spend the time understanding each other a bit better, you may find you have more in common than you imagined.”
Inside, there was one more piece of parchment. It was scrolled tight, taking up no space at all inside such a large container. Strangely, it hadn’t moved at all in Harry’s attempts to remove the box; it was sitting as though it had just been placed there, in the middle, straight as if Draco had used a ruler to measure the sides before placing it. Anticipating more pain, Harry gingerly reached into the box. The parchment came free, and he unfurled it, sitting heavily in Draco’s large leather chair as he did.
The next thing Owen knew, the wall behind him had caved in with the great crack of an explosion and an unfamiliar haze of purple smoke. He looked around, dazed, and quickly realised that whatever had happened had knocked out both his captors. He didn't hesitate a second more. He dashed over their prone bodies and out the door.
try. He bit back his automatic retort and templed his fingers over his tea. He closed his eyes for a split second and tried to calm himself down.
The hate and anger have always made Harry sexy and alluring in very indecent ways, since Draco despised simpering affection or softness, preferred to have a bit of fight with his fuck. The only time Draco ever felt he was close to understanding Harry was when they had spent time together on the Quidditch pitch in years before. And that time is past.
“Ron, just. Stop there for a moment,” Harry finally interrupted, holding up a hand. “You mean to tell me that all nine—
"Oh," replied Ginny, understanding. She inhaled deeply, hesitating before she continued. Harry gestured for her to go on. "Would you consider...you know, back on the horse, other fish in the sea, and all that?"
“Travers. I owe these people far more than my life. So yes. Besides, I’m not at risk. Harry will figure it out.”
"So, the Docks, I think," she said, using her signature move of completely ignoring him and getting her way anyway. "They seem promising, all those old grain elevators and everything.”
McGonagall finally looked up from where she had been writing, gazing at him over her spectacles with the sharp features that had spent many years chastising him.
“Theodore, darling,” she muttered, pulling away. “Were you actually worried about asking me to leave London? I’m only here still because of you. You are all such idiots. Seriously. How did you even survive without me.”
“What? He doesn’t know anyway,” she grumbled. “Fine. So, Owen. Will you help us a little bit longer?”
His trousers must be soaked, cold and extremely uncomfortable. Harry gave himself a stern talking to take his mind off of Malfoy’s trousers and held up a pathetic half wave that he instantly regretted. He really was such a git. Trying to cover his embarrassment, he moved toward the bench slightly faster.
Tuesday was easy; he went into the store at noon, meaning he’d had time to finish his Christmas shopping, reopen his own bank account, ate a delicious lunch at The Pomme before he’d had to deal with the jumper shipment and the angry grandma’s who were trying to return too-small clothing.
But for two weeks after discovering that Potter owned the place where Diego was working, he had fallen into such all-out hopelessness that he’d almost lost the plot completely. If he was allowed anywhere near Draco’s life, Potter would make it a living hell, just as he always had. He would tear down, brick by brick, the carefully constructed comfort zone that he had painstakingly created.
“If you’re going to tell me you don’t want to keep doing this, would you mind waiting until you aren’t in my bed? Like, tomorrow even.”
“I adore you, Geegee.” He kissed her on the cheek and she smiled a long-suffering smile before belting him across the head.
Filius chuckled, picking up his fork again. “Ah, yes. He’s fine. First year teaching and all that. Think he’s been holed up in his quarters marking. Nothing like the sheer and total panic of the first set of reports to set yourself up for being more organised, though. He’ll be fine.”
Harry stared at his glass for a moment, no response springing to mind. “Shit,” he said eventually. “We'd better get going or we'll be late for that thing.”
The breaks, the small ones, were enough at first. They helped Harry sleep, which was honestly half the battle. If he slept, he didn't panic as frequently when he was awake.
“Yes, I have in fact noticed that Draco Malfoy is half-naked and in you’re bed at nine in the morning, Harry. I am after all an Auror,” Ron snapped. “And normally, I’d be mortified and leaving to go and scrub my own eyes out with the business end of a toothbrush. But right now, I mean it. You both need to get up and get going right now.”
But, the long and the short of it was this; Harry Potter was quick to forgive. Draco Malfoy was quick to judge, but quicker to reassess and adopt hopeless causes. They struggled to stay put, struggled to settle down, never stopped helping others. Draco kept his job, Harry his. They raised two children with a foot in both worlds, and when the children asked questions about the past, Harry would spin fantastic tales that made them both seem more heroic and romantic than they were. Draco would fill in with just enough truth that they would believe them.
“So do you!” he called after a chuckling Harry. Still, a grin stuck itself firmly on his face as he wandered to the bathroom.
His father had acted predictably; a giant rage, marching into the bank to amend his will. But the truth was, Draco already had an exit strategy. He was going to go to jail for all his attempts to murder, but after that—if there was an
When he finally got it open, he found a large, brown legal envelope that he lifted out and automatically placed in a box that was to his right, in the ‘Hermione and Ginny’ pile. He reached beneath it and found that whatever the envelope had been sitting on was stuck. Solidly stuck. And dark. Almost imperceptible in the darkness of the drawer. Puzzled, he tried prying at the edges for a moment. There were sides to the object. It seemed to be some sort of shoebox-sized box, with a shallow lid and no handles. Changing tactics, he tried prying the top off the box.
Three months later, that confidence had completely disappeared as Harry stood in the nursery of the maternity ward, looking down at two small, wriggling things in the same small cot, calm and clinging to each other with one hand.
Harry winced. He thought he’d been hiding the dreams from her. He should know better by now that Hermione Granger didn’t miss much. He cursed himself for forgetting that and forced a smile onto his face.
She shrugged as her face relaxed. “Ron and I talked. We decided you were the only one who got to choose what happens next. We’re not happy with you being so miserable, but I don’t think this is our place to advise you.”
“Okay, I am going to try this memory thing. I am not saying it’s going to work. Just...for the record.”
process, but once or twice, mid-giggle fit, Draco could have sworn that he’d seen a tinge of jealousy and frustration on his partner’s face. It was gone almost as soon as it appeared, but it did give him pause. Was it possible that Draco wasn’t alone in his discontent?
“Maybe… just maybe take the card of this therapist anyways. Just… to have.” He stiffened, staring at her sympathetic eyes and pointed gesture. He broke the gaze, took the card, and stormed out of the Ministry.
He threw himself forward and kissed Harry, fiercely knocking him back on the couch, making up for all the times he’d almost closed the gap between them, for all the moments he wanted to reach out and tug on Harry’s curl behind his ear or fix his crooked glasses. Draco kissed Harry for three years of working too many hours side-by-side and yet ignoring how marvellous he smelled. He kissed Harry for his bravery, for his rushing into every situation but this one. He kissed Harry with all the gratitude he would never be able to express for not putting their working friendship in jeopardy, ever, even though he was
"Well exactly. And when we're done here, were going to go eat waffles with my family. And then tomorrow, I'm coming with you to the Auror department. And the day after
He let his sentence fall out of the bottom as he realised that he was following Draco closer towards the wall. He didn’t think that he’d actually planned on staying inside, let alone looking at an instrument.
“Harry, what the actual fuck are you doing! The sign on the door is HUGE! Do. Not. Open,” Neville shouted. “I can not believe you...your selfishness really knows no bounds, does it?”
Against his will, the corners of Harry’s mouth turned up, and Hermione — who never missed anything, ever — hit him across the head with the tea cosy.
. I meant, like, real help. Professional help. We could probably both use some, actually. I'm surprised the Ministry didn't make us all do mandatory counselling after the war. It only makes sense that you…. well, you saw more than anyone, Harry.”
Potter whirled around to stare at him with a glare that would have withered a lesser person; he was in tired jeans and a rolled sleeved plaid, his hair a disaster and his glasses stuck on top of his head. When recognition dawned in his face, his scowl deepened.
“Hay fever?” he asked quietly. “I get t in the fall too. Annoying, isn’t it? Most people only have to deal with Spring allergies. There’s a pressure point...right there,” he pointed delicately toward Neville’s ear. “May I?” he murmured.
Saturday morning found Draco warm and cosy and unwilling to move for anything; the blanket was the perfect weight and Harry, though not quite touching him, radiated just enough heat to be a steady presence.
“Listen to this one; a bezoar is for being a bezoar in potions for poisons. Essentially? Right. But semantically? Painful.”
Harry followed his point and found it. There on the horizon, darting around playfully, rolling onto it’s back as it ran. A glittering silver fox.
Thirty-five minutes had passed, every single one of them spent with Draco staring at his phone screen. He hadn’t stopped alternating between tearing up and overwhelming fury since his meeting with the head Cursebreaker the day before. It wasn’t the type of mood one brought into the Ministry, but part of him
Sure enough, the hypogriff touched down a moment later, skimming the water and drenching them both, to peals of laughter.
“You have an accent,” Ginny interjected. As usual, the brilliant ginger was the first with the important questions that didn’t matter at all. Draco chuckled. He’d long ago warned Travers that the youngest Weasley could be a problem here.
Potter laughed but came over after handing a drink to a young woman with a beatific smile. Then, he proceeded to stare at the sketchbook for an uncomfortably long time.
He threw on his last clean button up and ran a passing hand through his hair; yet another reason to get a job. He needed a haircut and he refused to use his parent's money to pay for something so trivial. As a result, his hair was currently more unruly than it had ever been. What had once been a fashionable sort of undercut flop was now just a chaotic mass of curls. He pretended to look Classic Rock, but he probably just looked like a ruffian.
Today though, he had at least an hour before he was going to let himself go home. More importantly, he was having a hard time. Surely he could justify something like a guitar with his parent's money; ultimate happiness had to be the goal of inheritance, right? He took a deep breath and pushed open the door. The melodic bells that went off were very appropriate but they made Harry want to cower behind the tower of amps he found himself faced with just inside the door.
"Hermione," he whispered. "I don't expect forgiveness. I'm honestly not sure he'll even see me. But I have to try. I have to — he needs to know what happened. Because I—"
When the five o'clock bells rang, he made up his mind. He'd organised his dresser, moved the kitchen around so he could actually cook, changed the order of the living room so that they had space to write independently, and had cleaned the bathroom. He was bored and he was hungry. Either Potter woke up, or Draco was going to eat without him.
On Autopilot, Harry reached out and took the key and paper from her outstretched hand. With trembling grip, he unfolded the page.
Pansy. Well, okay. I don’t know this one for sure. But I’m pretty sure its Carl this time. Using Polyjuice. I think he has my hairbrush.”
Harry shrugged. “Took the day in protest. They don’t fire my partner without telling me and get away with it. I brought food. Fired food.”
Draco woke up the next morning in a state of slight panic. Not only was he hungover for the second time in the span of a week, but now he was in a strange bed and with very little memory of his night after around the third pint. He scrambled out of the twisted sheets around him, and got up quickly. He ignored the dizzy vertigo and pain that spread through him from his head to his fingers and rushed out of the bedroom wildly. His eyes did not land first on the kitchen table or the familiar man sitting there but instead found the old, gnarled broomstick bolted to the wall over the mantle.
Harry grinned. “Not taking that bet. It’s inevitable,” he replied. “What do you reckon? Worst convocation speech in history?”
He ignored Potter’s absence, in fact, until the first Saturday in the January term when Quidditch practises were cancelled. The notice was innocuous, scribbled on parchment and tacked to the front hall notice board. But to Draco, who knew that cancelling Quidditch was an escalation that hadn’t been seen since the war, a dark and tiny panic set in; at breakfast, he worried at his plate until he was so obvious that Flitwick, sitting to his right, cleared his throat and looked at him pointedly.
Harry grinned, coy and abashed. “He’s not here. You can be the first to know that I am here stag. Use the information wisely, and you could net yourself a tidy profit from the press.”
"Part five," he whispers, his voice soft and gruff despite his efforts to remain calm. He's hopeless. So attracted to this man his voice can't even remain neutral. He clears his throat and tries again.
Harry laughed again and threw his food container on the nightstand. He collapsed back onto his pillow and shifted to stare at Draco.
linked by a universal thread. Why else have we ended up entangled, even after Hogwarts? You were the first wizard I met. The first. I thought I hated you, but I don’t.”
For a few moments, after Luna disappeared back into the back, they sat awkwardly. Finally, Harry cleared his throat and put his hands on the warm cup in front of him.
They were in potions before he finally snapped. He’d made it through Charms and Advanced Detection Spells, two hours of torturous practice for their first set of midterm exams, due to attack the upper years the second week of December, now only a fortnight away.
“Pansy bought it for me because I loved hers so much,” Draco replied lovingly. “I was worried I wasn’t going to be able to figure it out. Filius did have to help me with the electric thingy, but other than that it's actually pretty easy.”
“Lily, why don’t you go get Draco’s present while he and Daddy have a quick look at your snowman outside.”
“Draco,” was his reply, a perfectly arched eyebrow the only concession to his disapproval of his chosen outfit. “A productive day?”
He reached out and took Draco by the hand, pulling him forward until the door fell from his grasp and rested gently on Draco’s back instead. He waited for Draco to flee, to stop him. But he didn’t, so Harry kept pulling and Draco stopped resisting. When he finally had their bodies flush, trapping Draco’s hand between them, he smiled.
“This is Ron’s office,” he said eventually, avoiding Potter’s eye and finding panels d and e from the floor.
That had made the sleeping potions his only real option if he planned to continue to survive. For the next few weeks, he spent most nights avoiding going to bed; dozing unhappily on the couch until he conceded the point and, most often, slept in the guest room. Even that bed wasn't free of fantastic heated memory, not the way they had used the house, but at least it had rarely been seen for sleep alone.
“So you know how you've been standing on this parapet for about three hours now? Creeping out the first years and all that?” Harry announced. “I'm wondering if you are also feeling like a Victorian lady ghost. Because that’s what they’ve decided what you are.”
Harry pushed past Draco, who was the most relaxed he’d ever seen him; the image of a Sunday version of Malfoy sent his brain over the edge. Standing in the entryway of his tiny row house, everything clicked into place for Harry.
“Harry?” a voice called, shaking him from his ridiculous reminiscence. He shook his head slightly and looked up to find a bemused Bill Weasley standing before him. “Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you. I was told a
He collapsed against the tub with Draco still holding his hands and didn't resist when he pulled him down until Harry's head rested in his lap. They sat this way for hours, Draco smoothing his hair, murmuring,
“Harry. Draco.” Neville nodded at both of them, removed his jacket, and sat down before he could change his mind.
It wasn’t until he hit the street that the tears welled up in his eyes. He had dried them by the time he made it back to the cafe, but the
She paused her rummaging and granted him a pitying look before continuing. “Well, yes. Exactly. I tried so hard to convince him to leave a simpler clue. He insisted it wasn’t safe. You know what he was like, of course, hard-headed when he’d made his mind up. Big softy the rest of the time, but not once he’d decided something. Not exactly the most novel combination of personality traits, but, goodness, did he love you. Would never shut up for more than a few — aha. There we are.”
Ron’s Auror tone was nothing like the voice he used normally, and Draco could see why. It sent a strange chill down his spine. The darker, sillier part of his brain, the one he kept locked tightly away, hoped that Hermione had him pull that voice out sometimes. It would be a dreadful waste if not.
“Welcome to bloody Paris,” Draco sighed sarcastically. “You’ll never again not know the time. I’m going to eat, you coming?”
“So not because of the French then? I’ve been told it sounds quite sexy,” Draco replied. The why he would figure out later. Still.
He knew Draco was trying and he really wanted to let it go, to go out for dinner and forget the slight bump in the road. But hearing Draco say they weren’t okay set him off. For the first time in months, he felt like they
“No contact, I promise. Not going to hurt him. This was the stupidest thing I’ve done in a long time,” he glowered.
“Look,” she interrupted, her therapist veneer slipping just a little as she exhaled in a sound that was very close to exasperation. “You haven’t been in months and now you’ve called me at home during my vacation time. Obviously something is bothering you. So, if you aren’t going to ever open up to me, why am I here, Mr Potter?”
“Not really,” he replied, with a smirk she probably couldn’t see in the darkness. “It’s only orientation.”
Wednesdays were Draco’s favourite day. He was always off, had been for three consecutive years. Since no one else ever wanted Wednesday as a single day off in the middle of the week, it had never been under threat. And, at this point, he had enough Old Timer clout that no one ever asked him
Unequipped to deal with that piece of anger right at this moment, Harry took a step toward Draco instead. He reached down and scratched the kitten between its very pointy ears. She stretched and laid a paw on Harry’s hand, pinning it to Draco’s cool, hairless arm.
“Just for a little while, you big baby,” she replied, her voice catching just a tiny bit. “I feel a lot better about doing it now that you’re going to just get over yourself and go get Harry Potter into your bed.” She pulled back and arched her brow. “Right?”
sure how, but he knew he had. He’d stay here until someone dragged him out. There was nothing left outside these walls, so it seemed fitting to remain trapped by them.
accepted if Draco was able to go were simply trusting an Auror partner. That nothing existed between them that hadn’t always been there, a tolerant animosity built on mutual respect. She insisted, so he’d squashed the flame. Despite the fired food and the Irish Coffee and the Christmas gifts.
Draco looked long and hard at her. She stared right back at him. Even when he had been at his most threatening, she had always been capable of holding his gaze. Once, early in their relationship, Harry had dragged him to a games night at her house. They'd played a game of risk where he'd tried to bluff his way through. Instead, he'd ended up locked in a deadly staring contest that she eventually won. Of course, unlike today, she'd also burst out laughing and declared him acceptably ridiculous to be dating Harry.
be dissuaded from waiting there until you arrived. While I admire the gusto, I fear I could not wait until your classes finished for the day.”
Theo laughed heartily and slung an arm over his shoulder. They spent a quick hour at his large, drafty loft and he stole the extra fluffy green button-up that he always stole before they headed into the night with a jovial cheeriness that he hadn't been feeling lately.
With four days left and only images of scones and coffee cups on the page, Diego made some crack about how productive Draco looked in the quiet shop. Draco had no choice but to throw his sketchbook in retaliation. Irritatingly, Diego was quick and he caught it deftly, laughing heartily, drawing attention to them.
“It’s not your family either though, Draco,” Harry replied, pulling away again and kissing his forehead as he stood. “The sooner you admit that to yourself, the sooner we can get over this silly game you’re playing.”
“Rose,” he said as he sat her down in the booster seat attached to the table and stuck some fish crackers in front of her, much to her delight. “I don’t suppose you can tell me if I’m being ridiculous, can you?”
“What is eating?” Harry quipped, tossing an eyebrow up that Draco was relatively sure he had not been able to arch two months earlier.
Malfoy was headed down a corridor toward him. “Potter?” Malfoy sneered, apparently unsurprised, disdain quickly settling across his smug face.
Harry shook his hand, nodded once, shouldered his bag, and spun into Apparition without another word.
"Ron,” Harry warned. “Whatever you are about to suggest, it isn't happening. Even your eyebrows are untrustworthy right now."
He took a few more sips, scowling as the silkiness of the milk caught up to him, and it stopped feeling quite so sweet. Finally, he sighed in frustration and threw the pen on the table. Taking the cup with him, he stormed to the front of the shop.
Finally, Lucius cleared his throat. “You and Astoria are expected to make an appearance at the gala this weekend,” he muttered, clearly trying to regain his own composure; perhaps he was in the office. Draco’s gamble had, for now, paid off.
“Est-ce que ça va, mon chou?” he rambled. “Et plus tard, nous pourrons dîner avant de rencontrer Abby et Lou chez eux. Penses-tu que nous devons apporter des fleurs?”
A week before Christmas, Draco was sat at the counter, on his third latte, laughing hysterically at Harry. He’d convinced him to put on Christmas carols and had been treated to no fewer than three all-out performances by Harry and Bridget, complete with dance numbers. He distantly heard the bell in the empty cafe, but it took a full thirty seconds for him to realise that it was Diego who was standing at the counter. He felt cold dread sweep through him until he actually looked over; Diego was grinning broadly, looking between Draco and Harry.
“For now,” Draco muttered painfully, Pulling back and resting his forehead against Harry’s. “This is a game to you. We just… wanted to see how far we could push each other, and you’re winning. That’s always been the way.”
“Something wrong?” Draco asked cautiously. He wasn’t sure that their relationship warranted this, personal details, check-ins. Jovial banter over lunch was hardly friendship. Still, he felt like he needed to ask. Potter shrugged again and turned to face him.
Harry’s return from Neville’s was a bit rocky; he normally didn’t Apparate when he’d had more than one drink, but truthfully, he was eager to be back in his bed at Hermione and Ron’s, snuggled down in the warmth. He loved Neville, so he hadn’t cancelled their plans, but he was in no mood to continue socialising. He had his answers now; even with all the information, Draco was out. Draco didn’t want him anymore. That was fine, he’d known it for months, but something about knowing that he could have asked Harry for help and hadn’t made it feel much more final.
Harry’s smile turned to a smirk. “That’s just because you’re a needy little brat who knows I’m right. We are dating. You and I. We are a couple. If you don’t admit it, I don’t come home with you again. If you don’t admit it, no more brilliant sex. And I meant it. I come over this time, I’m spending the night. I’m fucking exhausted from the back and forth. We aren’t eighteen. I need to sleep.”
“It’s ‘Harry’. No one calls me by my surname. It makes me uncomfortable. Even the students only call me ‘Professor’ or ‘sir’. I don’t mind calling you Malfoy, but
A story: I was going to post two chapters today because I missed yesterday, but instead, I'm combining them. It makes more sense. Is this breaking advent rules? Yes. Yes it is. I'm super sorry. If that's hard for you, here's a chapter for December 11th: After Pansy left, Harry spent the whole day packing. He listened to too much sad Christmas music, decided to go to bed early, and woke up far too early for the train he was planning on taking.
Pansy made a large brunch for the whole crew, an oddly sentimental gesture on her part; as a good pure-blood daughter, she was an excellent cook. Which of course meant she usually refused to do it. Draco scarfed down more pieces of stuffed French toast than was likely wise, chasing the powdered sugar down with latte after latte he made on the fancy muggle machine that was his favourite part of Pansy and Theo's house.
She sighed at him and drank the rest of her drink in one gulp. “I’m getting another round. Anyone else?”
Malfoy smoothed down his hair from where it had been dishevelled in the wind, grinning as he shook his head and came to sit down against the wall as well.
“Don’t fucking lie to yourself, Harry James,” Hermione insisted in a quiet hiss. She so rarely swore that he took notice and chuckled a little. “You know exactly what he wants. He showed up at my house six days before Christmas, with a wild expression and a wilder tale. You know he wants you back. Stop being an idiot and go get him."
“Watch your tongue, young man,” Lucius snapped. “Who on earth gave you permission to transfer ownership? I certainly don’t remember hearing about it from the board.”
“Well, I don’t fucking know. We’re only in this mess because I screwed a couple of — oh, shut up Harry. Merlin, you’re worse than Pansy.”
"Harry is right,” he decided. “We're talking in circles. Let's break now and reconvene tomorrow instead. In the meantime… Andrew, can you see if you can get that paperwork filed? And Draco, I trust you are still looking into the appointment of a new liaison?"
it had been longer than he’d intended. Mostly, because the darkness was lifting, only slightly. He was waking up. He tried hard not to let his awareness shift too far toward the light. If he woke up before Harry had found him, he’d die of dehydration before anyone even heard him.
answered the door in sweats. Apparently that was about to change. At least the grey-specked fabric was clean, and his t-shirt was designer. If you squinted, Draco
When crunch of snow and a warm weight beside him interrupted Draco’s grumbled irritation and silent cursing, he didn’t look up at first. He was a vindictive man; he refused to be the first to speak, the first to acknowledge, and yet he knew that if he were not frozen to the core, his cheeks would have blushed from the realisation that he hadn’t been the only one who had
“Don’t you dare,” she said dangerously. “Don't you dare address me so informally. I am the matriarch of a noble house, and you are a
“Sorry,” Draco replied quietly, staring at the floor. “Was just heading to the stores, didn’t see you moving too.”
and appointment-less,” she returned, raising an eyebrow at him as her finger hovered over the phone keys.
Harry looked at the ground for a moment, at a loss for words. Ridiculously, he felt his eyes well up.
In the distant fuzziness of the rest of the house, they both heard a fussing baby and Harry stood so suddenly that he dishevelled the blankets beside him.  “I’m going to go get her before Ron wakes up again,” he said shortly, stomping out of the room.
When Harry had finished, though, he’d cleared his throat. He began his sentence two or three times. Finally, he sighed and stated, "Forgive me, Potter, but you realize you don't actually seem all that…"
November had always been cold and grey, but the darkness seemed to permeate every nook of the grounds earlier than normal this year, and Harry was morose—though even he had to admit it was getting a little old.
As he waited out the silence on the line, his whole body hummed with satisfaction; satisfaction of the decision to give Abe the shop. Satisfaction that he was already telling his father about it. Satisfaction that, just for this one tiny moment, he had his father by the short and curlies. He was, apparently, feeling reckless.
“Sorry. That was...you don’t have to tell me. I didn’t mean to pry.” Harry meant it. He had no idea where the question had come from.
above all else. The small, squat representative that arrived on his appointed day did not garner Lucius’ confidence and he had taken to repeating everything the man told him.
The ‘Mooncalf-icorn’, as Potter insisted on calling it, was a big hit, and the publisher had decided Draco would be the illustrator for the entire series, a simpering and inane group of board books about magical creatures. Every time he brought it up, Harry would burst into uncontrollable laughter, and eventually drag Draco down with him. It was hard not to laugh at the Muggle idea of what constituted a ‘
“She’s a handful, but…” he murmured, giving the kitten a final scritch as Harry pulled her to his chest. “Best half-kneazle I’ve ever had. You’re sure it’s what you’re looking for? She’s going to be...rather large.”
I’m struggling with. So please save me whatever ‘the pureness of your memory’ speech you have memorised and just...show me.”
Harry looked at him with his mouth hanging open as he headed toward the door with his latte. Only when Draco had nudged the door open with his hip did Harry say, “Fine, apology accepted.”
Draco Malfoy. His white-blond hair stood out in a sea of black robes, especially as the sun started disappearing behind dark fall clouds. The most irritating of these moments was when Malfoy stood at the window of the clock tower, gazing out over the hills like an old, mad king. Harry always saw him, since the tower and the pitch were adjacent, but it wasn’t until a student pointed out that it was the third lesson in a row where Professor Malfoy had been in the tower that Harry decided he needed to know why.
Only, mutated. If you talk around them, they imprint on you and…” Neville waved around him vaguely. He inhaled deeply and trailed off.  “Yeah,” Neville added with a sheepish grin. “I understand
Pansy laughed. “Isn’t that a bit complicated since you no longer own the shop as of this afternoon?”
“I look ridiculous. You don’t have to rub it in. You, sitting there practically a carbon fucking copy of Frank with your impossibly perfect corset and your hair. I get it. I’m not Rocky. Pansy made me.”
He spent three weeks fixated on that night at the bar before he couldn’t take it anymore. He was fucking up at work. He hadn’t slept a full night. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Draco, frozen in place from across the room, looking at him like he’d never seen a human before.
"Sounds fair,” Harry laughed, stepping forward to stop the doors closing. “Tomorrow?" he asked hastily.
"I've been waiting for you to just pin me to a wall," Harry says simply, as though he's slightly disappointed. "But lunch sounds good. On two conditions."
“You are an idiot. I am ashamed of myself, frankly, for having wasted so much time on you,” Pansy stepped closer to him, spat in his face, and recoiled as if to slap him. Diego’s hand shot out and had a hold on her wrist before she managed to unfurl. “
“Well, no,” Ginny conceded angrily, “but I think it’s going to be rather difficult to waltz up to a goblin and say, ‘pretty please take us to this unconscious man’s vault’.”
“You know,” Draco said in that loud, low whisper people reserved for loud places, “I didn’t think it was going to be possible to lose my virginity again, but I have to admit, I’m already enjoying this immensely.”
actually existing as a couple again. He thought they were both being themselves. He was doing his best. To hear Draco so directly contradict this belief annoyed him. And he snapped.
The night was cool and dark, cascading shadows long through the hedgerows. They’d decided to walk to an Apparition point rather than floo, hoping to shake off some of the fuzzy warmth of too much food and drink and good company. Which meant that the moment Harry and Draco’s relationship changed, they were standing under the only streetlamp in Ottery St. Catchpole, staring at each other over dust motes that made Harry shiver even to this day.
Harry shook his head vehemently. He cleared his throat and forced himself to make eye contact. "Please, Kingsley,” he begged. “A lot can change in a year. It isn't what you think. I miss the action. I… this was never what
“Okay, no seriously,” he insisted. “What is going on?” “Pardon me, sir?” the lady asked him, tucking her stick back in her purse. “Who are you?” he demanded.
“We tried other things first,” Draco whined. “I swear we did. We had a team on it for months. But we needed solid evidence of the syphon, Hare. We needed to prove it was
“You’re a natural,” she continued. “Draco, Harry will be back late tonight. I think I should put you up in the guest room and you can talk to him first thing. Okay?”
Harry's eyes cast down as he remembered what little he could from Draco at school. You'll forgive me for not buying that one.”
Now frustrated, Draco’s hands flew up in a strangely animated show of emotion for the normally sneering, judgemental Slytherin.
Draco looked at her for the first time; he was shocked to find her leaning on the railing, eyes damp and a flush in her cheeks.
“Well, whatever, it was weird,” Harry said dismissively. “Diego took some time off, and I was sure you’d come waltzing in here to give me some big speech about the Pansy thing or about Diego. Only you didn’t, did you? You disappeared.”
The man standing there might as well have still been seventeen; it honestly was not fair for someone to have changed so little. Course, half the problem was that, to this day, Potter still had only two facial expressions. Either stunned and slightly confused, or annoyed and suspicious of Draco’s very existence. Apparently today, he was choosing the dunce hat.
“Oh my god, shut up. Sap,” she teased. She kissed him on the forehead and walked out the door with another box, looking more graceful in three-inch heeled boots while holding a moving box than most people did on the dance floor. He loved her with every fibre of his being.
Harry literally choked on his own spit trying to back up the conversation. He grabbed Draco by the shoulders right before he could sit and spun him around to face the aisle.
The rapid French did its job as they took the next few steps, successfully dissuading the men from approaching them. When they had turned away and moved down the steps, Draco quickly dropped Potter’s arm.
“Ron, I am doing a bad thing,” he panted, out of breath more from fear than exertion; fear of what, he could not quite put his finger on.  All he knew for sure was that he
“Draco, please,” he begged. “Remember, we said we were going, to be honest. I am actually trying right now. Tell me."
“Abe, mate, I’m very happy for you. I’ll send you a huge basket of...something. But trust me when I tell you, no one needs me crashing their wedding this month. Marco would kill me.”
“Stuck on what?” Potter asked as he walked over, leaning on the counter beside Diego. Draco hated when he did that; it made it impossible to ignore the lithe line of Potter’s body, the strength of hard work etched into his arms, the flush of being around steam constantly. And since noticing these things made him uncomfortable at the best of times, noticing them on Potter made him feel downright anxious. He fixed his gaze on Diego, opting for cool disinterest rather than anger, hoping to end the conversation sooner.
The thing that Harry wasn't telling anyone was that the buzz of anxiety was almost constant behind his eyes. He was hiding the darkness that pressed down on him until he couldn’t move because the air was too thick. There were still moments of panic sheer and utter panic, where his breath was stolen and his heart pounded in his throat. The problem was that Harry longed for the panic attacks these days; those were the only moments where colours returned to their normal intensity, where the muted fuzziness left his world and put things into sharp focus. The moments where his vision tunnelled and his breathing quickened suddenly felt like the only moments where he was actually
At first, Draco just nodded and accepted the odd pieces of information. He was hardly one to broker peace, given that both men had collectively been teaching at Hogwarts for nearly a decade. He did find it strange to see the two Gryffindor’s so estranged, but he figured he’d get more information before he spoke.
“That’s not the lead, Pans. When I woke up, you were standing in my kitchen, carrying my ex-boyfriend’s belongings and murdering my favourite plant. That was very
Draco looked away; Harry let the tiny flare of victory make him blush and followed when Draco started walking. They made it all the way to the bar at the other end of the greenhouse before Harry had thought of a way to correct the situation. Draco ordered two glasses of white and Harry threw in a request for one of the fancy, themed cocktails on the list in front of him, much to Draco’s chagrin.
He stopped dead in his tracks, grabbed Draco by the hand, drew him close, and kissed him soundly. After a small moment of sheer panic, Draco clearly decided worse things could be happening and kissed back. With one step taken, the floodgates of their obvious physical desire for each other collapsed. The way Harry remembered it, they had barely made it back to the flat before being arrested for public indecency. They may have had no idea what they were doing, may have been mismatched and confusing from the outside, but as Draco dragged Harry's name from kiss-swollen lips at the heat of climax, Harry decided that they could sort the rest out later.
In which Draco learns that Harry died. Not, 'was gravely injured or lost consciousness' or 'medically had no heart beat'. But actually fucking
“Well,” Potter considered. “There were moments when I knew I definitely should not be doing it, you know? But the timing was never right for me to just…quit.”
He nodded into her familiar coconut scented hair and forced himself not to start crying. He’d cried enough tears in the past seven months.
Without turning or stopping, Harry said the sentence he’d been asking for weeks. “Why’d you kiss me.”
“I would never say that because I love Rose with every fibre of my being. I would die for her,” Harry insisted. “Besides, I don’t have to say it because you just did.”
“Neville, relax. This isn’t about the match. I...I am wondering if you can get me something. Or maybe just come with me to get something?”
“Stop, Potter,” Malfoy called back. “Go see McGonagall. You were supposed to see her before you saw me.”
Owen stumbled out into the street in the frenzied chaos of whatever had happened in the hotel. Clearly the blast had been loud enough to alert others, but he managed to slip past them as they scrambled up the stairs.
He blurted a short, dark sound, which may have been construed as a laugh in another world, one that wasn’t as broken and twisted as it was now.
“Got you a croissant, too,” Harry murmured lowly as he passed. “For you to chew on while you contemplate how lovely we would look sitting
Draco leapt down the stair into the sunken kitchen and found Harry at the table with a piece of toast shoved in his mouth. “Ha,” he declared. “Joke’s on
“Darling,” she crooned, patting his shoulder as they entered the glow of the porch light. “How many curses have you managed to break? Now, off to bed with you, you git.”
They have Tuesdays and Wednesdays off after travel games and Draco has gone home instead of to the pub. He's too tired, run ragged by being put on first string for the first time since Potter's arrival. The man himself took mysteriously 'ill', though Mora would give no details.
“Sod off. McGonagall invited you here without your N.E.W.T.s, same as me. Whether you like it or not, we’re on equal ground here Potter.”
The sat and stared at each other across the table. Neither moved a muscle, neither dared enter the space between them, the years of unspoken history, the attraction they’d ignored, and then dealt with, and then ignored again. Finally, Barkley—likely confused by the silence and the disappearance of his scratches—sat up with his paws on the table and gave a loud and irritated bark. Both Harry and Draco looked at him in surprise. And then, both laughed.
As tradition mandated, the projection of forty clients was sorely lacking; the regular crowd of forty had arrived by noon into the warm lounge, settling into their normal crews and pulling out cards and instruments, and the newcomers doubled their numbers by the time lunch was actually served. Draco stood behind the counter only as long as was necessary to serve food, and then dragged Theo out to the lounge, forcing him to play a couple of songs to make Maria smile.
"Well, strictly, no," said Harry, shrugging his shoulders. "I'd rather just take you home and… to put it politely, jump your bones. But society has taught me that most people aren't huge fans of that direction. I'm completely cool with it if you are, though."
“He’s just as fit. Isn’t that annoying? The rest of us, we’ve aged and gotten stress lines, put on weight ‘round the middle, and he, the bloody git, looks just like he did at 16. It’s fucking irritating.”
“Harry,” Madam Malkin announced in a reverent whisper the second she stepped out from behind the curtain to the back room. “Oh Harry,
He only just heard her mumble how hopeless he was as he left the classroom at a quick clip. He caught Draco by the elbow and whirled him around just as he turned the corner. For a split second, a glare lit up Draco’s face. It was a strange reality, to say that a glare lit up a face, but it was true. He returned, for that moment, to himself. It made Harry’s stomach lurch, then immediately after, fall into a melancholy that was familiar and painful.
Draco technically hears the words, although he's preoccupied by the fact that they are murmured in between wide mouthed kisses along his windpipe. Harry pulls his face back, pins Draco's arms to his sides, leans in until their foreheads are touching.
“Yeah, I was going to ask about that, but then in the chaos of the paperwork, I never did. How did you manage that? My bank accounts and credit and—”
“Yes, well, there is a reason I am an anonymous illustrator,” he said, muffled because his face was back on his sketchbook.
Or else in the doorway, up against a wall, dragging moans from the rubble of their past and waiting until Harry begged, jutting his groin against Draco's thigh with abandon until Draco finally conceded and took him in hand.
Harry laughed lightly, but when he took another drag of the still lit cigarette in his hand, Draco could see that the man was shaking.
? When exactly were you going to tell me this? How the hell do you expect me to contain your publicity if you are going to
come sit closer to his boyfriend, Draco picked up his things and moved to the bar. He had to admit, it was nice to have Diego asking random questions, stroking his shoulder as he passed by. While he was stuck like this, it made a nice change to be distracted rather than stare at a blank page angrily.
Tormenting people was a pathetic way to express emotion, but Draco had never really been given a good model in that department. He was older now. Had some significant, expensive therapy behind him. And therefore, he understood exactly why he’d wanted Potter then. Exactly why he wanted Potter now.
“I don’t know what you’ve got your back up about,” Draco huffed. “It can hardly come as a surprise that I’m here.”
“The car is already waiting for you on the street, you dolt,” she called back at him from the third set of stairs. “Honestly. Learn to be famous. Idiot.”
“Fine,” Harry grumbled, picking up his pack from where he’d dropped it and storming off without a backwards glance.
Draco’s expression must have been hard enough for Travers to get his answer. He held up his hands in surrender and offered a file to him at the same time.
“Look. I won’t seek you out,” Harry allowed. “But I’m not going to stay silent while you… do your little act.”
“No, I’m fine,” Draco snapped, drawing back his anger by clearing his own throat and standing before trying again. “Thank you, for this. I’ll look into it tonight and bring you new information. I know this isn’t easy.”
He was almost finished the ale by the time he decided he needed to do something about this instead of just staring out the window melodramatically. He was, after all, a proud Gryffindor. He took hold of his courage and found the nicest piece of parchment he owned, writing as neatly as he could manage and wrote a letter. A letter he should have written months ago.
to say anyone's name is 'weird' at work. Not to mention, it's kind of, you know, horrible. No matter where you are."
“Still so dramatic Potter,” she said, patting him on the shoulder and smirking when he flinched. “I’m not going to
The Mage was not actually one person, as Lucius had always assumed in the tales he heard. Instead, they were a secret society whose council was made up of old world witches and wizards who still followed the old rules. Rules-based on serving
“For what?” Harry chuckled, wrapping his arms fully around Draco’s waist and pushing his hair back off his forehead.
Not to mention the fact that Draco wasn’t fully himself either. Whenever he felt himself get too angry, he’d leave the flat. Whenever he was in a terrible mood, or when the nightmares returned, he’d just hide. That couldn’t be right, could it?
When Draco showed up with the parchment in hand already, fury crusted into every pore of his skin, Harry had grinned at him. Apparently, that had been all it took. He’d disarmed the Slytherin. Open emotion and intention? No secrets, only honesty? He won.
“They haven’t been paying me for years,” Draco spat. “They must know I am not coming back. Pansy, just go.”
It was a Saturday—for the record if for no other reason. It hardly mattered to him what day it was. He had no alarms, nowhere to be, no reason to be awake at seven seventeen. He still wasn’t back to work, technically because he wasn’t due back at the school for two more weeks. Less technically, it was because he wasn’t going back.
“Oh, sorry!” he exclaimed, taking in Draco in a distant sort of way. “What time is it? There were...bells?”
“Malfoy!” He called as he approached the sopping bench where Malfoy and Barkley sat beneath a large, purple umbrella.
had stayed with him for months, but then, it had been the fourteenth. The bank thing didn’t happen again, and his promise to his father before his death rang through his ears. Here he was, sitting on the
“Draco!” he called cheerily, all the tension in his head released. He was the one who knew how to do this. He was in charge. He was happy he’d invited Draco.
Which was a ridiculous thing to say, given that they were going to be at school together for the next eight months. Harry had torn off after Draco down the lawn the second his senses caught up with him, but Hermione and Ron peeling around the corner with Ginny in tow had distracted him just long enough to lose him in the wide grounds. He’d likely just ducked around a corner, but by the time he’d finished a strange afternoon visit with his best friend and ex-girlfriend, enough time had passed after the kiss to cool off Harry’s head and make him awkward. He’d spent the last two months trying to work out how to bring it up.
With that, Potter waltzed from the office in a full billowing of robes; Draco beamed at the stunned Ministry officials and Ron saluted as they both followed Harry out of the office.
“Sorry, Professor Lewen,” he murmured as the old witch tutted at him. “Need to try again. I’m just going to run to the loo and give it another go.”
Maybe more violent than was strictly necessary. Definitely more mysterious and aggressive than he’d meant to be. Still. He sent the owl.
“Sorry, Gogo, your turn with the lavs,” he apologised, tapping his watch meaningfully as he went to lock the door.
“It seems very likely,” Ginny said slowly, turning the body over in front of her and staring at Harry, who sighed, cast an
“Harry, what on earth are you on about,” Pansy replied, sounding just a tad exasperated. “Draco isn’t in Diagon. He’s right here. I’m looking at him. He’s at work, in the store.”
“No, it isn’t,” Draco frowned, glaring at the cup. “I’ve had lattes before. They are all...gross. Milky. And fake. Just wrong. This is…”
“You’re acting like one, too,” Marci declared, opening the file he’d dropped in front of her and skimming it. “This isn’t that big a deal. It’s just an interdepartmental investigation. He’s claiming you’re unfairly prejudiced against him.”
“Nothing,” Draco said lightly. “Just a weird thing we used to say at school. Harry reminded me of it. It’s stupid. Look, things between him and I were….complicated. And–”
The smile Harry received in return for this statement was painfully shy; it took everything in him not to reach out, pull Draco’s face between his hands, and insist that he had meant it. Clearly, no one
The problem with the whole situation was that for a long time, Draco couldn't figure out how he could possibly be finding Potter attractive. He was Potter, for Christ's sake. Needling, infuriating, clueless, gormless
when doing research. That had just made Draco laugh harder, and he was still snickering when they took to the large stairs in front of the Basilica. The thought of the Saviour of the Wizarding World getting cold from reading was ludicrous. He wouldn’t be surprised if he had a pair of fingerless gloves shoved in his messenger bag.
, I hate both of you,” Pansy shouted. “It’s the fourteenth! The fucking Fourteenth of Fucking December. That's what day it is. Okay? Okay. Now. I am leaving, and you two are talking. Fuck.”
interested in pursuing their little attraction again after three years. Harry needed to stop flirting, stop acting in this self-indulgent way that was unfair to them both. Sure, he knew Draco found him attractive, but in all honesty, after three years that didn’t mean much; he knew what he looked like. His appearance was an expensive, carefully crafted affair. Gloria insisted that the bare bones had given her something to work with, but Harry knew he hadn’t been worth much at all before he had been carefully turned into
’ phases. Not Draco's type at all, really. But it was hard to correlate Diego's beauty with his personality, once you knew him. He was the ultimate softy, a caregiver; it didn't match with the chiselled, blasé exterior— and even that was part of his charm. He was oozing in contradiction; the ass of a man who could expect to be worshipped, and yet with the personality of a saint.
Harry chuckled. “Urgh, yeah, mate. You always have. Loudly. And with gusto. What the hell are you on about?”
dead and now we’re here, with the key to what is apparently your bank vault and a set of very confusing clues, and that’s all we know. Now, we can’t promise you you’ll be safe, but can you please just come down to the vaults with us? Your surname, it’s—”
on the breast. ‘More dignified than a jumper,’ she’d said briskly when she’d handed it to him at his first Christmas lunch. He’d entered the house this year with a weight in his stomach; surely, this was the end. This was where the blanket forgiveness, the foolish acceptance of his very terrible betrayal of Harry’s trust, all ended. Molly Weasley was not Harry Potter. She did not forgive easily and she did not tolerate people who hurt her children.
Draco grabbed Harry's hand in the corridor and pulled him back, leaning against a wall. Harry mimicked his stance and waited patiently for the freak out to hit.
Somehow, his answer made Draco uneasy. Rather than argue or start an even longer conversation than this one he already didn't want to have, he drew his wand and began to mutter the first wards that came to mind. He may have been imagining, but Potter's indifference took on a slightly grateful air, and it almost looked like he might be smiling.
Harry opened his mouth to reply, but Neville raised a quelling hand and looked around them both, hands on his head in utter dismay. “Don’t speak!” he shouted. “How could you have spilt it

"You had more to lose," Carl said sadly. "I think that's why. It might not have been real, but you and I were one of the better things that happened to my life. I think I'm having a hard time letting that go. Even if it was all a…spell."
The expense was not a summer expense; the budgeting that Harry did was one of those ‘I grew up poor’ habits that Draco found equally exhausting and adorable. He generally went along with Harry’s insistence on a ‘summer budget’, while his school salary stopped. It wasn’t strictly
“We do have the key,” the man said quickly, leaning forward so the creature could see him. “Vault 1212.”
“For just...that shirt. And not asking anything. And coming even though I was an ass this morning. And always, really.”
Favouring slight scruff and long bangs, Harry had to admit that Malfoy was fitter than he’d ever seemed at school. It was… intriguing. The Aurors didn't see him that often, since Malfoy’s position in the incarceration department rarely required him to leave his office. Still, even in these brief, rare moments, Harry had noticed him. And, apparently, Ron had noticed him noticing.
“And I suppose that means the Ice Queen was there,” Abe added. “She tell you about the engagement? Don’t think she’s too happy about it. She’s been telling everyone for a week. I think she’s secretly in love with him, which is ridiculous because he’s as gay as the day is long, but then we don’t really choose who to fall in love with, now do we?”
“Don’t you even start talking to me about the battle, you hypocritical bastard,” Harry growled, ignoring the shocked glances of his fellow teachers.
Whoever Harry had been expecting to see when Ginny closed the door, it was definitely not a sheepish and terrified Draco Malfoy, and he choked on his sip of coffee before looking back up in surprise.
But it was indeed Draco standing there, tall and aristocratic, hair pressed carefully off his face. He had a thick, dark grey pea coat draped perfectly and falling to his knees, accompanied by a Ravenclaw-blue scarf slung loosely, accompanied by a black leather gloves, and boots Harry had never seen. He looked perfect.
He climbed the stairs after practice in a quick double-step that left him out of breath. He came to the top of the tower he hadn’t been on in years and found Malfoy ignoring the footsteps, head resting on a nest of his arms against the wall.
Normally — any other day, in fact — the retort that Draco felt would have come easily. He could have started a battle that he definitely would have won. But he surveyed the room with a surreptitious glance and found it in utter disarray; multiple pieces of wood were strewn all over the floor, there were tools scattered everywhere. Potter, for his part, looked a little bit…unhinged.
Suddenly, Draco's arms were full of dark, sleek hair and damp cheeks, happy giggles and a tiny little girl who wouldn't still be alive had his centre lost its funding.
They’d end up in hysterics every time Draco finished a sketch, and Harry’s face was transformed into lightness and clarity, the weight of pretending to be someone else momentarily lifted. It made Draco wonder what living as a Muggle had done to his own personality, his own appearance. He hadn’t noticed, but it was hard to see small changes in your own face.
Monday morning brought them both to Sacré-Cœur for a bright and early eight o’clock appointment. Potter had woven a ridiculously thin scarf around his neck three times, bristling when Draco had teased him. Apparently, he got
Draco laughed.”Yeah, I guess so. But just let me tell you...my father will be hearing about this in the quarterly meeting.”
with Malfoy, he pulled back so far that it felt like a slap in the face. Harry just didn’t get it. He was trying. Trying to redeem Malfoy in his mind. Trying to forgive him. Trying to let him be this new person that Harry didn’t actually hate being around, who was acerbic and possibly even witty when he wasn’t spending every minute of the day a brooding, moody lump.
sending Travers backwards and flat on the ground. Harry leapt forward trying to block an impending spell.
He led Harry across the room with her glass of wine and introduced the two of them with the typical grace that had been expected of him since the dawn of time. They sized each other up with an almost imperceptible level of ferocity that surprised Draco; did they know that they held each other in slight competition, or was he reading into that?
His brusque tone was feigned, and he knew Harry would pick up on that; he just also didn’t have the current headspace to resist Harry. If he didn’t get him out of his room before the elves appeared with breakfast, he knew he’d end up going along with Harry’s plan. Most notably, he’d wind up agreeing that staying in bed all day was an excellent plan, that he could definitely ignore his parents and their very ridiculous hold on him, and that he could survive going back to the club for the fourth night in a row.
Harry stormed his way out of the store, startling a pigeon that was roosting on the sidewalk. He kicked at the ground with his toe and scuffed his shoe. He stared at the marked toe for a moment and then forced himself to unclench his fists. The card Abe had handed him was still there, crumpled and ragged already from all the gripping.
“You sound like Dr Stenhouse,” Draco whispered, his eyes watering from being squeezed shut. He opened them and found Harry’s palm, moving to scoop his cheek.
"Yeah, yeah. You really need this fucking job etcetera. Whatever. That doesn't mean she gets to terrorize you. You have enough of that in the rest of your life. By the way, has he—"
Harry lasted three more months at the Ministry. For twelve long weeks, he battled his way through interdepartmental mistrust and overly cautious questioning of witnesses. He went to therapy and learned all the letters and acronyms that summarised who he was in the post-war world. But then, the story came out that prisoners were being released in light of the war crimes tribunal.
He was unobtainable, so that was check number one in Draco's column. He wasn't a pureblood, and he had, in theory, destroyed his father's little cult leader. So that was basically the entire list.
, I warned you that you had a month to convince them to let Draco be my beard. Your time just expired. I’m quite over being a simpering little rose. I’ll just go with penniless artist and ironically start doing opium, like a nineteenth-century poet.”
Summer meant a packed park, but even being prepared for it, Draco sighed as he approached the gate and tightened his grip on the leash.
One, he was sad. Two, he was very much aware of the fact that the number of people on the planet who were going to understand exactly why were very limited, and one of them was currently fumbling around his kitchen presumably looking for coffee making supplies. And three, he could really use a fucking drink. He lurched forward and silently took over the making of coffee from Harry, who was looking helpless over Draco’s prized Italian espresso machine.  Harry turned back to his bags, unpacking a great variety of biscuits, crackers and cheese, bars of chocolate, crisps. Draco handed him a tray and watched in amusement as Harry put together the trashiest,
Harry appeared in the kitchen, also pyjama-clad and wrapped in a wool blanket that was trailing on the floor. He sat at the empty seat to Draco’s left; Draco let the tension he’d been holding uncoil slightly. It seemed that the morning had brought back physical boundaries. As much as he wanted to pull Harry into his lap and keep him there forever, Ron be damned, something about the following of social cues on Harry’s part put Draco back at ease.
Draco jumped down off the table, hands in his back pockets as he turned away from Neville. For his part, Neville felt his head turn, waiting for the punchline; Draco seemed nearly apologetic, but. But. There was something underneath the remorse that was hard to read, and Neville knew that when it happened, he was going to be uncomfortable. At the very least.
“I can tell,” she said sympathetically. “In all fairness, I think he may have just hit his limit for how shitty he can feel. He doesn’t have any sense of self-preservation anymore. He just seems to decide he deserves whatever comes his way and deals with it. He never…Carl wasn’t really anything.”
,” Draco said playfully, his teeth suddenly making it to Harry’s earlobe. “So noble. So...virtuous.”
“Draco,” he supplied, returning the shake. “So, seriously. Now that I’ve officially wasted five minutes of your time, is there something I can help you with?”
“What are you marking?” Harry asked, fishing around for a neutral conversation topic; it was not an easy feat. Harry was relatively sure this was the first conversation the two of them had had that was occurring in neutral territory. The feeling was very strange.
late, but André always made the mistake of arriving at the same time as Erica. Draco actually suspected that he had a bit of a crush on their crotchety manager, which was fair, he supposed; from a strictly aesthetic point of view, Erica was probably pretty. It was hard to make a fair judgement, despite the fact that she was probably only about thirty. The years of retail and fighting with management who never bothered to check on the actual stores they owned had made her resentful, and she wore the bitterness like armour. He’d seen her drunk, once, at a May Day party the store had thrown. Since then, Draco had found charity for the woman in places he didn’t expect it.
Draco nodded and followed Neville outside. Together, the moved the crates into the storage room. Draco even helped cast the last of the stasis charms. As they finished, they stood in the back room looking at the boxes until finally, Draco cleared his throat.
“It’s only been six months, you know!” she announced. “If you wanted to just… you know—” she waved her hands indiscriminately between them. “Everyone would just go along with it. We’d be happy, actually!”
“Okay, so you broke up their engagement. That’s...worse, I suppose,” Draco said generously. “Still, five
Harry reached up and took Neville’s hand from his mouth. He didn’t speak, kissed the back of the hand that had stopped him instead. Suddenly, there was a workbench behind his back that Harry was hoisting himself up onto. Suddenly, he was grasping at hair and pulling at a shirt that he managed to remove. Neville was dragging Harry’s chest into his own and shoving hands down the back of his trousers, and all the while, their mouths remained silently attached.
By the end of the summer, Draco's prophetic remarks about his career had started to come true; Harry was sent on more and more gruesome cases, with him and Ron's proficiency with solving things quickly fueling greater and greater confidence from Montgomery. Very soon, Potter/Weasley became the go-to team for cases with weird puzzles to solve, and Harry was so busy travelling across the country that he relished the moments where he got to go home.
“I was gonna get Mathis to cover my shift, and you aren’t on call, and you should come with my friend’s and I to our Saturday thing. It’s fun. You’ll enjoy it. You need to get out of this lab.”
And because he was Draco, call he did. Right at that moment. Moreover, he finagled an appointment for the very next day, despite the fact that it was Saturday and last minute and the doctors at Mungo’s were always booked for months in advance. Then, he dragged Harry, almost by force, out of bed the next morning and into the fireplace. Harry didn't even have the energy to protest the Floo, his least favourite form of travel. They arrived directly onto the professional office hearth of the oldest wizard Harry had ever seen. He had to be older than even Dumbledore had been, with angry, pointy fingers and his eyesight was clearly impossibly bad.
” the brown-haired women hissed, turning sharply back to the bank worker, who just nodded shortly and began to walk away with a terse 'wait here' behind him.
Draco held his breath for a moment, until he needed oxygen. The light itch of a pen tip hit his skin, and he remained frozen for the first minute. The hand that slowly turned his wrist was rough, calloused from too many burns and too much time spent damp; the shift of fingers lightly on his skin kept making Draco’s stomach jolt.
“I don’t, not really,” Harry replied quickly, scrubbing the back of his neck in embarrassment. “I just doodle.”
At least in a place like that, when he had no ideas and his sketchbook taunted him by sitting blank, he could blame his misery on his surroundings; Draco’s scowl could be because of other people and not his inability to do his fucking job.
“Well, thank fuck for that,” Ginny’s harsh voice said from the open door. “Are you two morons ready to come back inside? Lily has a present for you, Draco, and apparently Albus has made extra waffles because you love them. We don’t really have time for sappy reunions. We have to be at the Burrow in two hours. Can you two sort out the finer details of your stupidity tomorrow?”
Harry rolled back over to face him, resting on his arm. “I want to tell you. But. Well, okay, don’t take this the wrong way but you tend to get a bit...jealous.”
“I know that,” Harry murmured. “Then you appeared, and we ended up in this… this thing.” Draco looked at his hands. “It was great for a bit there. I won’t deny that.” “Draco—”
Now, that did not mean that Draco wasn’t going to make him work for it. That first meeting, he’d simply ranted and shouted at him in public. ‘How dare he’ this and ‘who did he think he was’ that; and yet, when Harry had (gently, of course) sat at the bar and ordered two whiskeys on the rocks, Draco had straightened his sleeves, sat down primly and swallowed a sip with a long, open neck as though he definitely wasn’t sitting beside his childhood enemy.
“Bullshit. Obviously I did. You wanted me to answer the question of ‘how do I make the most stubborn human being on the planet admit he’s an idiot and go back to the only relationship where he’s ever been happy’ in a
He stood up and looked around the office. He considered his options, the niggling in the back of his mind. He thought about the same thing he’d been thinking about for the past three months, even before Potter had shown up in the Ministry and proved him right.
As Draco placed the antlers on the counter, the woman behind the till smiled a beatific grin at Harry pushing the pram out of the store; Draco couldn’t blame her. Harry Potter, dressed for winter and fit as he ever was, cut a hard figure to ignore while pushing a pram with a smiling baby.
“Sorry,” he said when he noticed Draco looking. “This is so stupid. Its just...my friends had convinced me I was crazy.”
There were less archaic forms of communication available, of course. Both of them had mobiles, of that he was sure. He could probably have easily dug out Potter’s ministry email address. But where was the fun in that? This way, it was like they still lived in the same building; at any moment, Draco could leap up, thunder up five flights of stairs, and find Potter, safely tucked into a four-poster bed and a wild smirk on his face.
For reasons he would never be able to explain to anyone out loud, Harry always took the train when he left Hogwarts. He could convince himself that it was his dislike of the Floo, or that Apparition took too long because of the number of stops you had to take, but deep down, he suspected it had more to do with nostalgia than anything. Arriving at King’s Cross never seemed to lose its appeal, and if he was honest, the fact that it took several hours to get there was comforting to him. It allowed him to prepare for London, for the city of Muggles, for the loss of the bubble of safety that moving between the Castle and Hogsmeade created. It was a strange feeling to realise he didn’t really feel at home in the Muggle world anymore, what with all of his days being surrounded and engulfed with magic as they were.
“Did you not get a scone? They’re fresh,” Harry said, hanging up his coat, putting on an apron, and robotically handing Draco a plate.
"Draco," he laughed, "relax. I didn't know it was you. Ron just said I was on the couch, nothing more. Need a pillow."
Not only was this particular brand of disaster the owner of perpetually terrible curly hair, caramel silk for skin, and slightly hunched, terrible posture was also snarky and magnanimous and brave beyond any reason. He was exactly the opposite of everything Draco was, which immediately became a problem.
Harry glared at her for a fraction of a second before standing up, placing his coffee gingerly on the table, and pacing over to the desk where a card from a Godchild sat, a picture of a house and three smiling faces in scribbled crayon.
Draco looked annoyed for a moment before he stood up and brought his chair back from the fire. “Yes, right now. Idiot. Unless you had other plans for the afternoon?”
The bravery fled him now. The stupid courage that held fast disappeared in the light of this tall blonde man and his shorter, squatter compatriot, who looked like he could break him into three separate pieces just with a fist.
The first few years of growing up pass by quickly for most people; there are moments that stretch out before you and feel like decades while they happen, but inevitably, the years pass you by without much permission to move as fast as they do. The times of trials and impossible things quickly disappear, and even when they were at their worst, the moments of exciting new things, the watching in wonder, it far outweighed the cost of the hard times.
The coffee he drank was black and too strong, but he choked it down with the resolve of an ancient seer. He’d need every ounce of caffeine to survive sitting beside his father for the entire day. He picked up the memorandum before it got dripped on by the errant coffee pot, and found a note on the back, written in a familiar script, careful and neat despite the obvious afterthought of the message.
“And now, of course, he’ll be even more sanctimonious, thinking he was right all along and only he could have caught me out,” he whined.
? Probably not. It was just the impact of Paris. Romance seeping into every statement. Innuendo dripping from his pores. He was fine. “I was just nattering. Asking if we could go get dinner before going to Abby and Lou’s. If we should bring flowers. Nothing scandalous, I promise.”
“This is my father’s gala,” Draco replied. His tone was light but there was a flash of darkness in his expression that Harry stored away for further investigation. He didn’t push for more information. It made sense that Draco Malfoy’s father was involved in an organisation as huge as Borgin and Burke. It wasn’t exactly a secret that they were very, very rich.
The kitten had been given the very Pureblood full name “Madame Sophina Le Zinnia Malfoy”, which Harry knew because Draco liked to croon at her with her full name. It probably would have annoyed Harry in another time, but since Draco more often cooed pet names at the grey fluffball, Harry was instead enchanted. Most often, she was ‘Zinny’, but it was just as likely to hear Draco mutter
Potter held out his arm, and Draco gripped it by the forearm without really thinking. Without really remembering that he'd never actually
“Today,” Draco continued. “I had myself removed from your will, Father. The bank will send you the papers. I am entitled to
Instead, having filled his cup, Harry leaned back against the counter, turned to face Malfoy, who quirked an eyebrow in question. Harry didn't reply for a moment, but for some reason, Malfoy also stayed rooted to the spot. They were locked in a strange and intense stance, both daring the other to leave first.
did this. Draco didn’t strictly know what was happening, which made Harry’s face heat in shame anytime he thought about it too long.
?” he sneered, to no effect. He had to admit that his cold, austere sneers were somewhat lacking these days. Something about the grey lighting, the uniform, his limp, unkempt hair.
Disconcerted, Minerva had called Harry into her office to ask what Draco had done to him, or what Harry held over Draco.
“Oh, don’t worry. I’ll get to her,” Harry insisted, crossing his arms and looking back to Draco. “So, explain to me how I brought you back to life.”
“We’ve got to stop meeting like this,” Draco teased with a smirk. “Do you think we should share social calendars?”
This meant that when Harry showed up, unannounced, at his door twelve weeks into some increasingly expensive owl post flirting, Draco was completely unprepared. He was in three-year-old boxers whose elastic was gone. He had not cleaned the bathroom. He’d made soup the night before and forgotten to take out the compost. These were the thoughts that went through his mind as he opened the door to find Harry Potter pacing on his porch.
Malfoy visibly bristled, straightening himself to his full, impressive height and veering away from Harry as quickly as he’d approached. “Best watch it there, Potter. This is the new world Ministry. Prejudice will not be tolerated. Even if it comes from the
Harry paused. He whirled around and grabbed the pink paper from Draco’s kitten-filled hands. He made no attempt to stop Harry as he unfolded it and read the coveted survey results inside. He found nothing surprising since his own survey read much the same way. He wrinkled his nose.
“That’s a very fancy coffee thingy,” Harry remarked, seeming to have decided to just ignore the bizarre coincidence they’d just discovered. Draco decided he could pretend, too. Clearly, this wasn’t a thing they were talking about right now.
Harry, at these words, stood suddenly. He began to pace. He paled even more and started to shake. With little warning, he went to the far corner of the vault and vomited. He crouched down to the floor, his head in his hands. Draco, after years of practice worrying over Harry Potter at every minute of the day, couldn’t stop himself from rushing over and bracing Harry’s back.
Draco tilted his head, said nothing. Harry inhaled deeply.  “You could move your bed into my tent. There’s room if we move things around. If you’d sleep better.”
“Right,” Draco said awkwardly. He stood up and gestured with his antlers. “Got to run. I’m late for work.”
Harry laughed. “Honestly? Probably 10% the fact that it’s me that’s asking, and 90% the regret of agreeing to go to Rocky Horror for the first time. Deep breath. You’re going to love it.”
Harry knew, then, that Draco had won. He had convinced them that he was not his eleven-year-old self anymore. Instead, he was worthy of Neville's affection, and Hermione's concern, and Ron's firm nod and a jarring handshake.
,” Harry insisted, sitting heavily in his chair and staring firmly at Draco until he looked at him. “Yesterday you couldn’t make sparks. That was very nearly corporeal. That is so much better than
Harry opened his mouth to reply, then hesitated as a thought struck him. He inhaled deeply, resisted the urge to wince, and blurted, “Draco, why did you say yes? To tonight?"
“Your concern is touching,” Draco scoffed. “But I assure you, I’m fine. I will be...fine. For a few months.”
Potter smiled, an open and honest smile that seemed more genuine than reserved. "No. Thanks, though. And D'Orsay, please."
Harry nodded without looking over. “I don’t dream about him either. I dream about the battle. Doesn’t seem fair, does it?”
The door was propped open, so Draco figured that was likely a good sign. Ron hadn’t been in the office when he’d arrived, and somehow, everything had set off warning bells in his mind. Which was dumb, of course. Potter was allowed to be wherever the fuck he wanted to be, honestly. He was under no obligation to be in his office at lunchtime. Except, the problem was that Draco felt the unsettling reality of having grown used to something like a millstone around his neck and he was furious.
He stepped forward, took Neville’s hand in his own, pulled him off to the side of the walkway. He pressed them both into the wall, took the chance afforded to him by Neville’s furtive glance around to the crowds nearby. He pressed his lips to Neville’s, carefully. Gently. He waited to be pushed away. Instead, he was drawn closer, a free hand weaving into his hair, a clasped one gripping desperately.
This was ridiculous. This needed to stop. The man was engaged. The man was engaged and now technically his boss again, and more importantly, he was
Neville gulped. He — really and honestly — did not believe he was here for an apology. And everything about that reality was starting to sink in. In a painful, pant constricting sort of way.
place. He wouldn’t have thought the goblins would stand for such pedestrian acts as Christmas music, but the clear sound of
She skipped merrily out of the kitchen and Ginny turned to Harry, placing a gentle hand on the small of his back and pushing him forward.
“No,” Harry grimaced. “No, no. I bought he and his wife a house, in Chiswick. They’re perfectly happy. They just have no memory of The Old Bean.”
He turned and walked away, forcing one foot in front of the other until he was met with the relative warmth and brightness of the main road. It was getting busier as the morning progressed, and he leaned against the cold brick of the corner for a moment, breathing heavily. He pulled out his phone and dialled a number he hadn’t used in a very long time.
Draco stood up and surveyed the ground between them. “So, you’re saying that I can’t use those memories. Because the guilt gets in the way of the spell. Not the, uh, stupidest thing you’ve ever said.”
“Why don’t I just go get some food. We can eat here. The shops will be rammed so it’ll be a minute. Do you care if I just buy something easy? A quick bread, cheese, meat sort of thing? Or, I could go to the creperie just round the way. Up to you.”
“Harry isn’t ready to speak yet,” Draco explained, gesturing to Harry, whose face was a new, delicate shade of blush that made Neville’s throat constrict.
By the time the Christmas Holidays arrived, he had to admit that they were almost friends; even Flitwick commented on how much better they seemed to be getting along. Harry couldn’t help but admit it. Despite every reason not to, he realised that he actually
Suddenly, things were very much present. Things were technicolour, vivid, and probably always would be. The words ‘need to talk’ somehow replaced the potion fog. Harry sat up. He moved very slowly, as though talking to a suspect. Something had shifted in the room, something painful and honest. He did not like Draco's tone.
She flicked one ear of the Santa-hat-wearing headpiece and it jingled merrily, punctuating Draco's already terrible morning. He held his head in his hands for a moment and made a pained sound.
“Well, you were right not to tell me,” Draco smirked, recovering himself as Harry looked at him expectantly. “That is a terribly useful story to have in my back pocket.”
He tramped around the room for a few minutes, searching for the file he knew he had left somewhere on the bookshelf, but he kept getting distracted. It was really quite irritating.
Draco sat up, curling his knees in. From the corner of his eye, Harry watched him become smaller than he’d ever seen him. It felt very wrong, to have someone so tall and slender, so agile, curl into a feeble ball.
Harry decided after three weeks of being in his new home that if he was going to keep telling people about Dumbledore's Army, he was going to have to actually start looking for a space. It wasn't until he started that he realised how ridiculously difficult this whole thing was going to be.
It took him two weeks to work up the courage to go back to The Old Bean, to find it within himself to apologise properly to Harry. He waited until a day when he knew Diego wasn’t working; not for his sake, but for Harry’s. He and Diego were on good terms, really, but he didn’t know how Potter felt about him without the safety of his connection to a favourite employee.
“I’ve only known for a few weeks. And he just moved out last week. I swear, I had no idea. I didn’t even know
Surprisingly, Potter chuckled softly before standing up to face Draco again. “You’ve had other lattes in
It was a quarter to nine on a Tuesday evening. Normally, Draco would have been completely wrapped up in a blanket, sitting in front of the fireplace with a glass of pinot and a book, while Astoria watched some mystery or home decor show near him. He was extremely unhappy about that he isn’t there now.
Potter, against all odds, burst out in a fit of laughter that he quickly tamped down. Still, there was a smile there, ghosted on his face, when he nodded sheepishly. Draco ignored the tiny spark of gratified satisfaction he felt at the expression.
In response, Oscar immediately made himself indispensable. Within the first hour of meeting him, Oscar had fixed the leak in the pipes that neither Luna or Harry had been able to figure out, hung the hand-painted DA sign, and solved the problem of a theme for the grand opening.
Theo laughed at him when he got up to get his third. "Pansy," he laughed. "I think perhaps we're ready for gifts."
“So there is no way, in any world, where you are going to come back and suddenly be my partner again in the Auror department.”
Draco nodded gently. He stood up and inhaled deeply, closed his eyes, murmured the spell. The effect was immediate.
He knew it was technically more than that; the fact that he had spent many hours flirting with this man before he’d ever even considered fame, or the impact Draco had had on his world-changing career. But that stuff wasn’t really in play here. He wasn’t that person anymore, and he had no idea who Draco was now.
Draco took a deep breath so he didn’t ruin everything by punching his boyfriend’s boss. He tried again. “What. Is. This,” he asked in his calmest voice.
With Luna helping, he decorated the space with soft, cushioned flooring in the practice space, added a moveable duelling stage, and found Muggle gymnastics mats for tumbling, disguised with magic to look vaguely like the large floor pillows that had once adorned Trelawny's office.
“And they didn’t fire you,” Diego said, an intriguing hint of irritation in his voice. “Miraculous. Harry, will you change this bloody music? It’s depressing.”
When Diego had first arrived on the scene, Draco hadn’t been much of a person at all. He’d been living off of hush-money from his parents, promising not to tell anyone that he’d actually gilted Astoria because he was gay. He was in a flatshare with people whose names he honestly couldn’t remember now, drinking and partying way too much. He had nightmares that kept him from sleeping at night, and he couldn’t stop moving for five minutes during the day without panicking.
“Be right with you,” the friendly, unmistakable voice of the old dressmaker called out from the back. “Just finishing up!”
to like the sun. Supposed to grin at strangers and say inane things like ‘hot enough for ya?’. Being a Brit who liked the sun was too predictable.
Ron had scribbled the address of Harry’s flat on a scrap of a memo about floor cleaning charms, and Draco had clutched it so hard it was barely legible by the time he found the blue front door in Maida Vale; it was way nicer than he’d anticipated.
"Too much? I can stop. I'm not trying to make you uncomfortable…I know you're dealing with a lot right now."
And the confusing reality that his dead husband’s owl had delivered a note about an utterly baseless connection to the man who was now rightfully trying to flee.
“You don’t understand,” Theo said miserably. She shook her head at him in confusion. “Pansy, I’ll have to live there. In Wycombe. This back and forth won’t work when it’s more than two days a week.”
Hermione held him now as though he might fly away, and he understood her worry; he squeezed back, trying to make her understand that he meant his words. He was excited about tomorrow, without reservation or trepidation.
“Sitting by the lake with Pansy and Blaise. Studying for finals in third year. That was such an easy year.”
“Yeah,” Harry breathed, running a hand through his hair and disheveling his attempts to flatten it. “Yeah, I’m...Draco.” He put his coffee down slowly on the table and sat beside Draco on the couch, facing him and inhaling deeply. “Draco, I need to…tell you. Something.”
Theo’s money had come through first. A loophole in the Reparations law, a regulation that allowed him an allowance per year because he was the last living Nott. He’d found them the dingey flat and moved them in immediately. Having learned better than to trust any ounce of fortune, neither had left their Muggle jobs. They were content, comfortable.
If I ever become a different person and decide to get married, I promise you that I will spend all the money I have to get married in the Temperate House of Kew Gardens. You owe it to yourself to google it. Seriously.
“Someone is still using Polyjuice to turn into him,” Harry offered, sipping his tea. “He’s pretty sure it’s Carl.”
“What is it?” Harry interrupted, craning his neck to try and see the paper. Hermione shushed him and gestured to Ron.
sale can eat my—sorry, I just got off the phone with cooperate. It's been a long one." She exhaled slowly, gripping her ubiquitous clipboard tightly and closing her eyes. "Reminder that the bloody
“But Harry,” Ginny went on. “I have been patiently waiting here for you to finish this story because I wanted to know. I wanted to understand what went wrong. What he’d done to you.”
Harry shrugged. “Not particularly. It’d be nice to have some company, though. I don’t like food shops.”
"Fine," he said as he walked out the double doors, almost angrily stomping as he did, clearly annoyed at his concession."But I swear to all that is sacred, Potter, if this is some sort of plot, I will gladly lose my job in order to properly curse you."
Finally, as the whole staff stood listening to Professor Grubbly-Plank babble on about how to protect the forest from the students and the students from the forest, Harry snapped. They were standing at the edge of the pumpkin patch, gazing into the dark foliage, when Malfoy cleared his throat and raised a meek hand that halted the conversation.
And that had earned him his first, real, unreserved Draco Malfoy laugh. It was rich, and full, and required all of his faculties to listen attentively. He was instantly hooked. Malfoy took his last swig, and stood up, shouldering his coat in that dignified way that Harry thought only people in films pulled off.
“Forearms,” he confirmed, kissing Draco deeply, and backing them into the tapestry behind them to continue the contact.
“You’d never know,” Potter said, looking at him as he put the sketchbook back down. “You’re very good,” he took a step back and crossed his arms.
The next day, Harry went to Montgomery and admitted that he wasn't ready to be back in the field. He took the desk job. He just wanted Draco to be okay, wanted him to be happy. He deserved to be happy, and it was not fair for Harry to take that from him.
"Part six" he mumbles into Draco's lips as he presses down. "In which Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy probably should have just fucked in eighth year."
The older women sitting behind the counter looked up briefly, annoyance flashing on her face as she sighed. “Look, love. Why you people don’t just floo is beyond me, but you well know you buy your ticket on the train, and you’re about four minutes from missing it. So if you really fancy the many hours of nostalgia, I suggest you run, dear.”
Harry shrugged so nonchalantly, that Draco felt the need to grit his teeth. “I mean, you’ve told me before. But, you handle the paper. It’s what you do.”
He sat up quickly. The solution was so simple it was ludicrous, so stupid it felt perfect despite its reckless roots. He pulled out the drawer and found a scrap of parchment and a pen.
Three days passed quickly. Draco did too much and too little, held Harry too tight and not long enough. He begged Harry’s sleeping form to hear him mutter words about the closet and the black box. Hermione’s memory had already been modified, fortunately not by him. There was no going back at this point. Hermione wouldn’t remember what she had agreed to until they wound up in Madam Malkins, and Harry wouldn’t wind up in Madam Malkins unless he followed the insane trail of breadcrumbs that had been laid before him.
“Just don’t let yourself get behind by helping him,” he warned with a knowing smirk. “Though I suppose you young folk do have to stick together, don’t you?”
Diego pulled his own marker from his apron pocket and tossed it down to Harry, who stared up at him for a moment before taking a deep breath and walking over to where Draco was sitting. He hesitated a moment more before pulling Draco’s arm forward by the wrist.
two years, which felt like a decade. No Spain this time, just a slightly tense dinner out together in Muggle London, followed by Harry claiming exhaustion and going straight to sleep.
It was Draco’s turn to snap to Potter. He let his expression go deadly neutral. Truthfully, he still had no idea how much Potter knew about his year and a bit in Paris, how much of everything he said was actually taunting. Which, technically, was true of their entire truce-filled tolerance of each other. He was going to have to dig through that whole mess relatively quickly, given that they apparently lived together now.
Ron had shrugged, carefully avoiding Harry’s eye and holding out a scrap of paper he’d pulled from his pocket. More to shut him up than anything else, Harry took the number and left the room, allowing his brain to continue its low, pounding beat. He placed it in his wallet. He had actually decided part way through the day that he
“Don’t say anything, I’m serious,” Neville murmured, grabbing his arm and pushing it down. “I’ve been trying to tell you about it. They’re spores.
Even though he left his short shift happy, he was still sad and exhausted, and the walk home felt longer than normal. He almost gave in and took the tube, but he stuck his headphones instead to drown out the sounds of the canned music being piped in all down the high street. He'd attended the protest when they'd started doing it last year; a rare display of public support, he'd stood firmly against hostile architecture of music in public places. Driving people away from lingering on street corners was not a cause he'd support.
The evening had been pleasant, although not overly date-like. Malfoy, it turned out, was actually quite funny, if in an acerbic sort of way. It was like he had taken all the meanness and bullying of his youth and channelled it into observational wit and self-deprecating humour. As he described his time since school, he seemed content, and not at all like the person Harry had pretended he knew in their youth. It was surprising.
“Well, you never get shopping done, and he kind of figured this year may be a bit harder, what with the whole—”
Ginny softened and folded him into her arms. “Okay. Okay, let’s go. We can ask Madam Malkin what she knows. Then we’ll go for dinner at the old place. Get really drunk. Okay?”
Draco winced. Amanda, always meaning well, was only just barely still employed. Even though he knew she didn't care, he really,
," he said gently, picking up Draco's hand again and pulling him closer. "We are going to start celebrating Christmas in that dreadful little flat of yours and Theo's. In all the moments in between, I'm going to continue to be confused and alarmed and sad and afraid of what it means to love each other still. Can you handle these terms?"
“I know,” Draco whispered back. “Harry, I am...I will spend the rest of my life apologising for this.”
me?” Harry fumed. "I’m not 'erasing progress'. I'm doing fine! What would you have me do, huh? Quit? Stay here and cook and clean for you like a fucking house elf?"
Harry, he was sure, hesitated for the barest fraction of a second before he disappeared into the darkened corridor and shut the door behind him.
"Yes Draco, I remember. False bottoms. Please, go for it. Explain to me, what on earth do you need those for?”
. He hated the shops on Saturdays with very good reason. Ginny, as usual, had refused his refusal. She had talked him into coming through the strategic use of pointed glares over actual words. In another time, he'd have risked being punched for the chance to tell her how much she looked like her mother at that moment.
“It’s fine, either way. But you need to decide right now. We can just go grab another drink somewhere, and then you can take yourself back to your sad, empty bed in your great, gloomy castle. I told you, I won’t force you.”
“They know where you are,” Owen said boldly, seeming to think he had some sort of advantage all of a sudden. Which was ludicrous given that Harry still hadn't seen a wand or any form of protective spells or clothing. It was almost surprising to note how large the man was, how well-trained he looked; Harry almost wanted to laugh. Despite the fact that he looked as though he may wet himself at any moment, Owen Travers seemed to be attempting intimidation. Harry whirled around again, pointing a threatening arm in the man's face until his mouth closed involuntarily.
“I don’t know. It’s just standard wizarding practice. But the point is that those false bottoms have important stuff in them. Promise me you will retain that information, Harry.”
Harry was staring again; he gave his head a small shake and tried to look interested as Kingsley spoke, attempting to refocus on what the Minister was saying. After all, that had been his promise, at the beginning of the end. He had sworn that they would be able to work together. That they could carry on as normal.
Harry left Draco’s office in a trance. He was halfway down the corridor, standing in front of the tunnel, before he managed to convince himself that he hadn’t just imagined that whole thing. Heat had flooded his cheeks, his whole right arm was numb; had Draco simply lunged at him and pounced, it would have felt less intimate than that handshake. Unbidden, the words he’d spoken to Louisa bounced around his mind; he needed just one more glance, even if it meant he was solidly caught.
Having decided to walk from the Apparition point on Tottenham Court back to the flat, Pansy had lit a cigarette from the crushed pack she kept in the side pocket of her bag for emergencies. She was therefore quite distracted as she approached the porch, and it wasn’t until the last second that she noticed Theo leaning on the rail, hands stuck in his jacket pocket, looking off into the middle distance. She stubbed out the smoke as she took to the stairs and ignored him as she fished out her keys.
to try and keep himself awake as he furiously cleaned the flat. When he'd agreed to stay the weekend with the baby so Ron and Hermione could go away for two nights for the first time since she was born, he thought he'd been fully aware of what he was signing up for. He had been woefully unprepared. Rose may only be going on a year, but she was in a strange, simultaneous stage where she wasn’t sleeping through the night but spent her days running around like a whirlwind pulling everything off the shelves.
It smelled like bread and bad water and too much pee on the street. It felt like spring despite being late summer, and there were random, inexplicable flower petals littering the street. Their origins would never be revealed, and they just added to the overwhelming sense of deja vu. As did having to complete his order in French. In London, he rarely spoke in French. Sometimes, he read books, or listened to French radio, but never spoke. Still, the words rolled off his tongue, the teasing quip ready when the girl behind the till teased him for buying such a variety of things. The softness, the smoothness, the fact that he didn’t have to guard his accent. It all settled across his shoulders like a comfy jumper and, arms laden with delicious morsels of France, he found himself content. Content, and resigned.
He sent it off before he could change his mind and three months later, when the England reserve team announced it’s new fall roster, he refused to let the little seed of satisfaction that wheedled its way into his stomach take root. He squashed it down heartily and never said another thing to anyone about that letter.
“And furthermore,” Harry said, his voice reaching a whole new level of volume that sent a shiver down Draco’s spine. “That the Ministry has been
“I mean, no you aren’t. But that’s okay. I deserved at least that much from you. I’m sorry I hexed you.”
Harry nodded once and gestured for Draco to continue. He leaned back against one of the bedposts and waited for him to begin.
But Owen stopped speaking. He stopped moving, frozen to the spot despite the man still tugging on his arm. To his left, next to the strangely medieval building with the large owl sculpture positioned on the top, there stood a very tall, very sinister-looking man. A man with silver-blonde hair and a raptor-like gaze, surveying the street.
Draco looked away. The question was the right one; he’d known Harry would get there eventually. “Because, Harry, he wanted his will to be the final one. Carl’s full name is Amiecarel Vivantial Prudent Avery.”
And so, Harry ended up back in school. It was weird, trying to work his way around Muggle business practice, work out sums and figures he hadn't used since year five, learn new maths he didn't ever think he would need, and then go home and teach it to himself all over in the context of magic. There was probably an easier way, had he looked a little harder, but he didn't need easier. He went to bed every night feeling directional and fulfilled in a way that he never had during Auror training. He had spent those two years feeling like he already knew what to do to catch evil, and he resented every second. This was challenging, exciting. He could easily get lost in not understanding something, and had to push and fight his way back to the surface.
Hermione’s sleepy face disappeared in an instant and she sat up a bit straighter. “Oh,” she started. “I was hoping you...wouldn’t notice. Not until morning.”
Draco looked at Potter hard, searching his face for the teasing, for the punch line, for the anger. When it didn’t appear, the tiny portion of his brain that was trying desperately to find an angle into this job clung to the idea like a liferaft. Mooncalves, with their long necks and big eyes, their fluffy, definitely pony-like tail. It could work. The story the art was for was a bit goofy and fun.
“I won’t stay,” Draco said quickly, standing up and picking up the takeaway cup he had requested. “I just came to properly apologise, for Pansy.”
“He’s been something other than that for you for a long time. Draco, we are fine, you and I. We agreed on that already. Go,” Diego opened the door for him. “Be happy. I’ll go for a walk.”
things. He revelled in it some more until Ron said one sunny day, "Mate. It's getting a bit weird, er, the mentioning every sense."
“Draco, I know you aren’t used to this. So I’m going to keep fucking saying this. You. Are. My. Boyfriend. I’ll say it until you believe me, until you agree. This is what partners
"Hey,” Harry said in mock offence, throwing himself from the bed and advancing on Draco. “Well. Fine. That’s true. But I am excellent with actions…"
“Draco. He once went from believing his godfather had murdered his parents to having the man be his very best friend within a matter of days. You give him all the information and he forgives you. It’s what he does. I feel like maybe he isn’t capable of throwing away love. You may have to give him some time. Not expect to be back in a wedding suit any time soon, but still.” She regarded him across from her on the couch. “I’m going to take a little longer. I know it wasn’t technically
He’d met Diego in the midst of a tailspin. He was running out of money, his flatmates had stolen all his gold family heirlooms, and he was quickly becoming something a Malfoy had not been in a very long time; broke.
“Hermione insists that it will wreck the incantation. I think maybe it’s an overabundance of caution, but I understand where she’s coming from. Her entire career rests on this case.”
The term had been in full swing for a week, and Harry hadn’t seen Neville for more than five minutes the entire time. It was obvious that he was being avoided. And for some reason, Harry was extremely mad about it. Finally, on the eve of the first weekend of the school year, Harry marched himself down to greenhouse three and flung open the door.
"Fine,” Draco groaned. “I'm not actually angry. I'm sorry. It's just… Harry, I hardly see you. It's like we don't exist as a couple anymore."
When he showed up at the shelter before even Alex had gotten there, he had to admit to himself that he was maybe getting a bit too dependent on the busy days off. He’d worry about that after the holidays, though. Right now, he had work to do and a purpose. There were worse ways to spend his time.
At the time, the words had filled Draco with cold shame and anger, but he fumed silently for the entire hour that Potter spoke. When the council announced that he would be released to his mother’s custody, without his wand and under house watch for a period of sixty days, the words had taken a week to sink in.
“Well, that’s my point. They’re as wrong now as I was then. You’re the best Cursebreaker they have. But by the time they figure that out, you’ll have found yourself some gloriously complicated private practice and be making buttloads of money with a fancy beau on your arm, and they’ll be sorry.”
“Not if it’s because you’ve fucked around with his emotions!” she replied sternly. “Harry, I love you, but you haven’t exactly had the best track record for relationships lately.”
“No, what?” Harry pushed. “Back to what? Normal? No offence, Draco, but you don’t even know what that would mean for me. Truth is, you've only ever seen me fucked, Draco. At least as adults. If I recall, you weren’t a big fan of who I was before that.” “That’s not the point, Harry—” “Admit it, Draco,” Harry interrupted. “You’re scared that this is as good as it gets. You know what? Maybe it is. I will not be chained to a desk.”
Quick note before this very short chapter. Yes, there is ignoring of canon birthdays here. I was going to add the tag 'ignoring of the long and expensive fanfic that has somehow become canon' but it was too long and clunky. It doesn't make much difference, but still. I do know I did it ;)
“So the new flat is ready, then?” Draco asked harshly, already knowing the answer. The new flat had been finished since the last week of November. And they both knew that he knew that.
Harry confronted Draco in a terrible mood on Monday morning. It wasn’t intentional, and it definitely did not go well. He’d slept terribly, tossing and turning and waking up every five minutes. It was a Bad Dream kind of night, where the silence of the dorms really bothered him. Finally, around five that morning, he’d given up and gone down to lie by the fire with a duvet, passing out for the last few hours in a weary sort of way. He missed sleeping next to other people. His own bed was too small and too large and too not-containing-his-friends, and the dreams tended to get the better of him most nights.
He was far too distracted by thoughts of curly hair and gentle blushes, of resurfacing emotions and of debilitating self-doubt.
Draco smirked. He’d eat his Quick-Quotes Quill if the story she was about to throw him was actually any sort of scoop. In two years at the paper, he’d never written anything that he hadn’t already heard about in the society pages.
Harry took it automatically and opened it slowly. He smiled. “You should just put it back on. Oh, relax. God, your face,” he teased with a laugh. “I’m not suggesting we march down the aisle next week. But. Draco, I’m not sure there’s any point pretending I don’t still want to marry you. Oh sure, I don’t trust you right now. I’m hurt. I’m confused. And I sort of want to murder every person you’ve ever called ‘family’, but all of that changes nothing. I was ready to take you, for better or worse. This is worse.”
He knew, before Harry even voiced the thought, what had happened just now. The problem was that he was struggling to believe it, to comprehend.
“I was already awake,” Harry replied, rocking Rose back to sleep. She was fussy and possibly teething; waking up in the night wasn’t a normal thing for her anymore. Harry was struggling with his brain’s suggestion that she knew something was up.
The name, though, was enough. Something inside of Harry snapped. He wasn’t great at doing things halfway. If they were going to be civil, they needed to
He trailed off as he got close enough to take the leash. The man’s smile turned to a smirk as he glanced away and as Draco took the lead.
“Kettle’s yours,” he said, closing his eyes. Carl didn’t respond, instead of picking up a box and escaping through the propped open front door. He pulled a saucepan from under the sink and filled it with water, leaning heavily on the counter as he waited for it to boil.
As the rhythm of the pen continued, he felt himself relax slightly, unconsciously studying the focused face in front of him. The scar was still there, but it was so faint now that it was almost white. If you didn’t know to look for it, the messy curled fringe would hide it completely. The glasses weren’t the same dorky circular frames either. The ones he wore now were still weirdly large on his face, but in a stylish, almost trendy way. It was irritating, and a little endearing. Draco shook his head, clearing it of that thought, just as Potter pulled back and capped the pen.
During lunch on the first day, Harry sat at the opposite end of the long staff table from Malfoy. For the rest of the week, he did his best to avoid the blond-haired man who hadn’t changed physically in the decade since they’d left school. What he could not avoid, however, was hearing the way Malfoy spoke, with a soft sort of seriousness and low tones, always offering things that were ‘only in my opinion’. As the orientation got underway and changes to the rules were made, he qualified every addition with ‘if I examine my own thoughts’. He seemed to be either hiding or dispelling of his usual black-and-white temperament and it was slowly driving Harry insane.
Draco chuckled again and wrapped an arm around Harry. He was nuzzling, nestled and content. It made Harry sigh a happy sigh. This had been so many months of planning, this moment on their eventual-living room floor, no furniture and boxes creating a wall within the already small room. They had the kettle, mugs, and tea. That was it. Everything else from their newly combined lives sat in a tangled maze. Whoever had decided they should move right before Christmas was absolutely mental.
Cowed, Harry dropped it, muttering to himself as he turned back to his table. He stayed quiet the rest of his brew time, but when he noticed Draco packing up, he intentionally threw an entire extra sprig of holly into his bubbling mixture, causing it to turn blue and catch fire.
"Oh, Harry,” she soothed once she noticed his attention shift to her. “You've got to tell me what happened. Seriously. You have to."
Draco began furiously shaking his head. "No," he insisted. "That was me, being a twat. Me, protecting the wrong thing. As usual. We, you and
“You have direct evidence that The Mage exists. So yes, you are. Now, what else do you want to add?”
“Why do I feel like you’re mad at me?” Harry asked. Draco didn’t reply. “Listen, I just…you asked me if I was sure, before. About never having time to quit?”
They ate sitting up in Harry’s bed. Later, Draco would probably find this gross. Right now, he was not really up for a discussion of anything that involved leaving the warm comfort of this miniature world they had suddenly entered.
“I. You. I haven’t been able to… I mean, we worked together, and I’m me and you’re you and frankly, that’s enough for…I just realised I needed to shut up and let you live your life, but it’s been hard. So
,” Diego actually laughed. For a moment, he just stood there laughing at Draco. Just as Draco was starting to get annoyed, Diego sobered and cleared his throat. “You think he hasn’t told me you were still coming? If it bothered me, I’d have come to see you. Let’s not be that couple, seriously. It’s boring. Besides, I just came to say… you should really just ask him out, already.”
Harry bounded into the small flat with the smell of fish and chips assaulting him immediately. Apparently, Seamus had decided on eating at four in the afternoon again. He’d be worried about his flatmate’s eating habits if he thought he had any grounds.
Harry winced as her mouth pinched into a tight line. He knew that expression. He would be in trouble for whatever awaited him, at some point if not right now. He smiled wanly as she gestured for him to leave.
Harry’s smile fell. “I know that. I was kidding. Look, I’m going to go exploring for a bit. You coming or not?”
happy. For the first three months of this increased workload, he had been. He revelled in the fact that he was trusted, a good Auror, triumphing over his initial doubts and hesitations. He loved coming home exhausted and hungry to find a whistling, soft-haired blond puttering about in the kitchen despite his insistence that he would not become Harry's '1950s housewife'. He'd been so grateful those first few weeks that he had often found inventive ways to reduce Draco to finishing meal prep in only his pants. Things were good. Yet, in the back of his mind, Harry wondered. He wondered how long he could go before the nightmares came back. He wondered how long it would be before the panic returned. But, although he did wonder these things, it seemed too good, too safe, too right, in those first three months, to bother questioning when it would all collapse.
The ring box weighed down his pocket until finally, after pudding, they all started to trickle back to their homes. The years of the Burrow being able to hold them, house them, were long past. Hermione took the baby home, and Ron Apparated a short time later. Slowly, one at a time, the other families disappeared. Harry sat in the kitchen, helping with the washing up, and Draco took himself outside to stare up at the stars, unsure of if he should leave. He almost did.
“We’ll take a long lunch. We’re owed it, anyway. Come on, my treat. A ‘welcome to being a curse-breaker’ pint or something.”
“Sometimes. It’s adorable. Usually.” Harry looked very worried for a moment. “I’m pretty sure this isn’t going to be one of those times when it’s adorable.”
As he rounded the corner into one of the dog’s favourite rhododendrons, he stopped short at the sight of a brown-haired man crouched down and whispering to his very anti-social, timid dog, whose tail was wagging and whose leash was under the man’s control.
“Draco,” he murmured. “It’s going to be okay. We’re going to figure it out. I’m here, now. I’m going to be here.”
She stood more quickly than her outfit and age would have suggested she could, triumphantly holding up what looked like a small slip of paper and a brass key on a thong of leather.
“We’ve solved the pixie mystery,” he announced loudly, startling Harry bolt-upright. “You two both need to get into the Ministry, right now. There’s a debrief in Malfoy’s office in fifteen minutes.”
“Fucking Harry Potter,” he groaned to himself as he packed up for the day and spilt out onto the street.
“Well, coming from you, darling, that means next to nothing. Please, stop being an idiot.” She turned and left the room, letting the partition slide shut. “You need to be gone in an hour, my parents will be here soon,” she called back through the screen.
“So it has literally nothing to do with Carl,” Harry repeated from his position of lying down on his sofa, face pitched into the sofa.
When Carl's anguished expression came into full light, a wave of pity-filled guilt and affection rushed through him so fast, he felt a little nauseated. He shook his head firmly.
But as time went on, as the notes continued, he started to see what was happening; he'd likely, in actual fact, always been a least a little bit in love with Harry Potter.
He hurried down the path, ignoring the strangeness all around him and yet feeling like it wasn’t that strange. If he’d stopped to consider this for a moment, he might have questioned why people in strange, Halloween-reminiscent hats and long flowing robes didn’t feel strange in the middle of a Saturday on a Scottish high street, but he was moving too fast, trained into thinking twelve steps ahead. His only concern right now was discovering what he was involved in with that damned black box. For some reason, his hesitation to just pop in and shoot the brown-haired saad man before his employers got to him had made perfect sense. He had a sneaking suspicion it was in everyone's best interest to protect that man.
Draco closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. He was not normally this shy; Potter discombobulated him and it should probably be more of a warning sign to him than it was.
Draco swallowed hard, resting his head on his desk again. “It doesn’t feel like it is, Pansy. I’ll…I’ll lose her.”
Malfoy’s head snapped up to glare at Harry for a moment, his arms limp at his sides. “I almost told you why I was here,” he spat. “Don’t know what came over me.”
“Why?” she asked, genuinely puzzled. “Did you also want me to personally inform you that you are going to be required to teach Slytherins?”
Randomly placing compliments on an individual who you never see, and more importantly, who does not trust you, is not enough to convince them that they should date you. Particularly, Harry suspected, when that person also happened to be your former childhood rival.
“Mr Potter,” the cool voice of the goblin on duty intoned, regarding him with a healthy dose of suspicion that was his regular welcome at the bank. Harry supposed that successfully breaking into a bank and stealing a part of its security system had not led him down a path of unending trust, but it did get a little tiresome having to deal with the Goblin Cohort every time he needed to secure a few galleons.
of that before it made his life more difficult. Instead, he’d been rash and childish, literally running away.
been missing the action of the field. He had just failed to remember how boring it really was at the end of the day. He'd forgotten how much of his time was actually spent
She nodded at him and he silently left. He didn’t know that he deserved her trust, but he would never stop being grateful for it.
“I already told him that,” Pansy interjected. “Look, you two. Focus. We can deal with you in a minute. Harry, you’re
Luckily for both of them, the opening notes of the shadow cast introduction began and they stood in their seats as everyone around them settled down. Well, not down. No one really did anything calmly at a Rocky night. It was basically his favourite thing about the theatre. The jeering and the swearing. The complete lack of any propriety.
“Well, you’re the one who just used the word ‘screwed’,” Harry replied, shuffling back and standing up. He picked up both containers of food and started to walk out of the room. “It’s late and you should stay. There’s a new toothbrush under the sink. You smell like curry.”
“My therapist,” Harry explained, with just a hint of challenge in his tone. He clearly still anticipated mocking from Draco; he wanted to take away all the memories that made that true. For a moment, he was so focused on the sadness that Harry’s tone instilled in him that he didn’t hear his words. When they filtered through, Draco froze.
