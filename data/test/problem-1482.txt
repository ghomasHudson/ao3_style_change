“What is this tosh you’re spouting?” He asked with the clearest possible enunciation, “That’s not what life is like at all, Potter. That’s not how it is for people. If it was, everyone would be skipping along the streets with pockets full of wildflowers, singing at the top of their lungs.”
“Right,” said Harry, though nothing about his tone of voice inspired confidence. But then, maybe Potter was a visual learner. Draco pressed on, more to give himself something to focus on than anything else. Right arm curled around an imaginary partner, left hand to the side, Draco glanced at Harry.
“Hopeless?” Potter offered.
It had been a while since Draco had felt a nice, purging wash of loathing directed at someone other than himself. He hated being looked down on. He hated it even more when the derision was well-founded. His smile and voice were still fixed to the gold standard of civility, "I'm afraid I never mastered it, no." At least that particular charm was not part of the Hogwarts curriculum. He could feel a little less foolish for not having learned it.
“What I’m trying to say is, I’m sorry it’s so hard for you to think of a moment when you were truly happy. There was a time when I wouldn’t have been able to either and it was horrible. So, I’m sorry that’s how things are for you right now. It’s the worst.”
Drifting through indistinguishable night and day a week dragged into a month, and one month multiplied to two. His mother’s letters kept coming of course, and he answered them, and occasionally Pansy would come to visit and criticize the state of the furniture or the shine of the silverware, but for the most part little changed. The house seemed to slump lower and lower in its foundations, but Draco stopped caring. There was no one around to impress. The library was unbearable these days, but Draco didn’t ever really feel like reading. Mimsy kept on cleaning, and the food looked as nice as ever, but even if it hadn’t, he didn’t think it would have made much difference. Nothing appealed to him, anyway. Mimsy fretted and tried to ply him with little glasses of mulled wine and mugs of thick, spiced drinking chocolate. She put warming pans in his bed every night, slipped tonics into his bath, and would sometimes leave a particularly nice and freshly pressed set of his robes hanging on the hook in his room in a way she must have hoped was enticing. Sometimes Draco would even force down the drinks or put the robes on, just to stop her from peering nervously at him for a little while. But he was never in the mood for the drinks, and he had nowhere to wear the robes to. Nowhere he wanted to go, at least. He was only waiting. For what, he wasn’t sure. For his parents to come back, though their stay in France didn’t seem to be coming to an end anytime soon. Until everyone had forgotten about him, maybe, however many decades that would take. Or perhaps for the house to give up and swallow him whole, subsume him into the peeling wallpaper and stained grout. It was all fine, all good enough for him and more than he probably deserved. So, Draco let it continue without any further intervention—until the Boggart.
Draco’s eyebrows raised significantly in interest.
Harry momentarily gripped his arms hard, his eyes seeking Draco’s, seemingly seeking some sort of confirmation.
“Oh, do shut up,
And on, and on it went. Dragging Draco and his hard-earned, quiet, reputation through the mud.
and filled his stomach with a nervous anticipation, remembering the letter he had sent the day before. He thought that Harry would love these.
Draco couldn’t help but smile, his heart felt lighter than it had in such a long time. “What are s’mores?” He asked.
Draco lifted his head and looked over at Harry, his arms crossed over his chest, but the gooseflesh disappearing in the gentle warmth of the spell.
” He was talking to his fig bonsai. Its roots bulged dramatically out of its cracked pot. He couldn’t look at Harry. This was cruel manipulation. Cruel and merciless.
“I don’t drink— excuse me.” Draco said curtly and made to leave.
“Whatever you need, Harry.” Hermione said, turning around and wiping her hands on the dishcloth by the sink. “Anything. And no more secrets. If you need to tell us things to stay accountable, tell us. What else can we do to make this a supportive home for you?”
He stared into his tea, letting his thoughts wander back to the dream he’d awoken from, their voices blurring in the background as he swirled his cup absentmindedly.
“But you get hard reading 400 year old gay smut?” They were getting closer, he thought.

“I thought you were done with your research, what’s with all the paper?” Harry asked jovially, striding over to Draco’s workbench where he sat hunched over many sheets of parchment, letters spread out in front of him from many different senders. Harry smelled like outside, and he had brought a clean chill with him when he came in the cottage.
Draco searched Harry’s face, counting each new line, each new wrinkle that had appeared there through their years together, feeling love blooming in his chest at the sight of them.
____________________
He rapped lightly on the door and the voices inside faltered. After the sound of scraping chairs on the floor, followed by heavy footsteps, the door was opened to reveal an exhausted and harried looking Ron.
Withdrawing his hand he tucked a small object and folded piece of parchment into his pocket. Nestled next to his talisman and an assortment of old letters from Harry.
His eyes were suddenly wide, scanning the parchment, shock apparent on his face.
“So,” Draco, drawled, trying to regain some of his composure, “Hermione was right. We’re already doing it. We’re already keeping the balance. The thestrals are just guiding us.”
“I’ve been thinking—” Draco repeated, still softly, not really sure how to articulate his whirring thoughts.
A squib had no well such as that. No, Felix was not a squib, and Draco was furious that he had been told he was. He was frankly astonished that Felix had lived and survived for as long as he had with such damaged and mangled magic. With a curse that had been allowed to smoulder in the depths of him.
“He’s an idiot for not loving you as you are. Children aren’t made to be the instruments of their parent’s dreams. They’re made to be loved and cared for.” Harry said, his tone resolute, but his features soft.
Later that evening, Harry was folding up brown packaging paper around his present for Rose, giving Little Dipper a pep talk about how to deliver a package, having no idea if he understood or not, but trusting the little bird nonetheless. He’d sent him on a few test deliveries (to Draco while he was out and about in the forest, mostly, but a few to Hermione) and he’d done perfectly well so far. He seemed keen to repay Harry for his kindness, and the little black owl was tilting his head this way and that at the large and rather cumbersome package Harry was wrapping.
“Move in with me, Draco.” Harry said, watching Draco cut up his full English into bite-sized pieces.
“I— uh— I was busy.” Draco said evasively, looking anywhere but in Harry’s eyes, not wanting him to know how little he wanted to be here today. “And besides, Mrs. Weasley wouldn’t let me by without attempting to hug me to death.”
“Damn.” Harry said impressed, grabbing the peanut butter and closing the cupboard.
Sharing one more impassioned kiss, Harry finally, finally turned over underneath Draco.
“Draco, I know you’re in there!” called a dreamy voice that carried through his apartment from beyond the front door.
“Oh my god, you were pulling my pigtails, you prat.” Harry laughed at the realization.
“So, we’re even, then?” Harry asked, his voice coming out more hopeful than confident.
All of the Goodbyes
Draco was listening with such rapt attention that he almost missed the sad smile Hermione and Ron exchanged with one another. The unspoken sorrow that passed between them as they both made to touch some part of their child as she mindlessly gnawed on a mushy stalk of eggy broccoli.
— but sure,
“Can you feel it? Between your fingers, in your palms, up your arm and into your chest? Can you feel it pooling there, filling you?” Harry said, watching Draco swallow, his adams apple clearly visible as he tipped his head back further, his pale face up to the grey sky.
, really. It’d be much more fun with you there. And you could meet Thor!”
“‘Ello there!” He said loudly, and as Draco crossed the threshold Hagrid wrapped him in a near crushing hug. He found he didn’t mind one bit. Hagrid may be huge and overwhelming, but like Harry said, there wasn’t a more pure soul alive. “How’s the unicorn stalking, ey?” he asked.
“I’m okay.” It was Draco who finally spoke into the space between them, their arms still linked, a reflected pose, each of them the strength of the other.
He felt himself flush before answering in a disparaging tone, “Everyone knows when your birthday is, you’re Harry fucking Potter. I’m surprised it’s not a national holiday, to be honest.”
“Excuse me?” Draco asked with a shocked face. “Potter. First of all, no. We’re friends, I’m capable of having friends. Platonic friends. You berk. Second of all, have you just assumed this whole time that I’m gay?” Malfoy looked infuriated, deeply amused, but also very angry.
Harry had been itching all morning. His shoulders, his back, his forearms. Fuck, even his eyes felt like they had a persistent layer of sand behind the lids. Long rows of flaking skin along his forearms stood out. He pulled his sleeves back down. Down more. Over the backs of his hands. I must tell lies.
“I mean it, Malfoy. It will help,” Harry said it with enough conviction that Draco bit his tongue and focused on eating his food, “Merlin, what’s on these vegetables? They’re delicious.” The portion sizes that Mimsy had given him were more than what he would have eaten even in the best of times: Draco didn’t force himself to clean his plate. But, with Harry commentating on how good the food was, he did eat most of it, and was feeling warm and haler than he had in ages by the time he put down his fork and knife. The dishes from the main course and accompaniment were cleared away, replaced by two crystal goblets of remarkably similar blackberry fools, as well as a small glass of Armagnac for Draco, and he groaned, sinking back in his chair, legs stretched out under the table.
“I’ve already told you I’m alright,” He said shortly, looking pointedly away into the fire, “What more do you want from me?” And that should have been the end of it. But Potter could never just let well enough be; it was what had thrown him into danger, and into the spotlight, so often at school.
Which was how they ended up in Malfoy Manor’s main hall fifteen minutes later with Harry shirtless and draped in one of Draco’s bathrobes, sitting in the chair closest to the fire.
“Okay, we don’t have to be really traditional, if you don’t want to. What do we do, then?” Trying to ignore the sensory memory of Harry’s wand in his hand, and that warm jolt of realizing for how long he’d been holding it, Draco threw himself into more comfortable thoughts about choreography.
“No… Not yet.”
“Yes, I suppose. So?”
“Weren’t you listening?” Draco asked, but he couldn’t help but smile. Oh, he relished being better at something than Potter. And Harry happened to be rather charming when he was confused. He was also charming when he was self-possessed, and incandescent with loveliness when he was angry or brooding. It was difficult for Draco to think of a time when Potter didn’t look his own personal brand of scruffy-beautiful. Draco was hopeless. And in terms of the lesson, so was Harry.
“And then?” Draco asked, looking over Harry’s shoulder towards the piano, still playing the sweet melody, to spare himself the butterflies he was guaranteed to feel if he looked Harry in the face right now. He could enjoy this moment and hold himself together at the same time.
“Auror Potter,” He said with the smallest inclination of his head, “I’m surprised this warranted your time.”
with something and I—” Scalding hot tea splashed onto his thumb, and Draco looked down at his cup of tea. His hand was shaking. He bowed his head—away from the fire, away from Harry’s probing gaze—drawing inward, forcing his voice to steady and his hand to still. His thumb was still burning. His eyes burned more. At a flicker of movement before him, Draco looked up. Mimsy, clutching Harry’s freshly washed and dried shirt in her hands, crossed the room to hand it to Harry with a look of utmost suspicion in her enormous eyes, before turning with far more tenderness towards him.
“He’s right there.”
“Is Master Malfoy wanting anything? Mimsy could be making a trifle for him. Or perhaps a pigeon pie?” She said, pointedly putting her back to Harry.
“I’m staying.” Harry might as well have shouted them. Draco started with sheer surprise. Weasley’s mouth fell open.
“So what? This is
“Yes…” He said haltingly, looking away from Harry. At the fireplace, at the gardens, anywhere but at him, at an utter loss for words. He had no guidelines to interact with Harry in this context. Potter finally cleared his throat and rumpled up his hair.
They drew together again, Harry holding Draco’s hand, his other arm curled around his back, Draco with his hand on Harry’s shoulder. Together they took the first set one movement at a time, with Harry moving haltingly, Draco always anticipating the correct steps and sometimes finding himself offbeat as Harry figured out how to move his feet, his hand drawing Draco forward at the wrong time, but still comforting in its steadiness and warmth.  Forestalling failure in the second part of the dance as they returned to where they’d begun, Draco tilted his head, in the direction of the next step, “Left, then a turn.”
Draco and Harry wake up together.
It had to be a Boggart, of course. Voldemort was dead, and his mother and father had disappeared to France, but they were alive and as well as could be expected. The arrival of his mother’s owl the next morning reassured him of that. The only trouble was, Draco had never actually managed to cope with a Boggart before. He’d stupidly blown off the lesson his third year, and the opportunity to master the skill had never come around again. Even if it had, Draco wasn’t confident in his current ability to laugh in the face of his worst nightmares. The thought of going in there to deal with whatever horror the Boggart could brew up for him plunged his guts into ice.  He wasn’t sure Pansy had ever learned either, and Draco certainly wasn’t going to call his parents back in from the Côte d'Azur because he couldn’t handle a Boggart. Anyway, he didn’t want them to see what the house had become under his stewardship. With few options left, Draco sent an owl to the DMLE, requesting assistance in banishing a dark creature.
“You sure about this?”
“You’re not!” Weasley said. Harry was clearly expecting this reaction, because his arms were folded over his chest, and his feet firmly set, as though prepared to tackled.
“I don’t want you to think I’m pitying you again, and I don’t want to drag things up that you don’t want to talk about. But do you want to talk about that at all? Because it seems sort of not good,” Harry said haltingly. And Draco didn’t want to talk about it. Why would he? But there was a gentleness in Harry’s face that had found the resonant frequency of Draco’s heart strings, and everything hurt, and Harry had done him the service of staying the night and firmly justifying it, without Draco having to say a word. Draco looked back down at his soup, and ate a few more spoonfuls: gathering his wits as Harry watched. Finally, he took a sip of water, and cleared his throat.
“I’m not pitying you—”
Despite the tea and water, and his now twice-cleaned teeth, Draco’s mouth went dry all over again. “I wouldn’t want to impose,” He said, scrambling for anything to say that would save him from sounding desperate for company and comfort against the terror of his own bedroom.
It took a long time to convince her to return to bed after that. Through alternating pleas and murderous looks, Mimsy coaxed them into accepting a calming herbal tea after the potions, and then pressed Draco into taking a bath and changing into proper night clothes. She prodded the table harp into playing a warmer melody, swapped out all the bedclothes in both his bedroom and Harry’s, and set a small brick of magical incense at the edge of the fire. With the room smelling of frankincense and lavender, Draco freshly cleaned and sitting on the edge of the bed, and Harry already half-asleep against the pillows, Mimsy held Draco’s hands in her own.
“Wow, I hadn’t seen these the last time I was here,” Potter said, making some sort of stab at brightness, “Who are they, Malfoy? Relatives of yours?”
Draco held out his right hand, and Harry took it. He hadn’t noticed until that very moment that Harry had taken his dueling gloves off at some point. His hand was warm and firm, and his fingers curled with steadying certainty over Draco’s. Merlin, it was nice, just having his hand held. It wasn’t even businesslike. It was extended and comfortable. Just
"I know!" There was a frantic pitch to Harry's voice, "Expecto Patronum!" Like sunlight breaking through clouds, a blessed glow radiated out from the sitting room, bringing warmth and calm with it. Draco's heart slid back into place in his chest, and from the other room, Weasley gave an audible sigh.
Tongue still sticky-dry, chest burning, Draco fought for words. “It’s back,” He managed, “In my room. Looks like me.”
“I don’t need your sympathy,” Draco said, setting aside his tea and crossing his arms over his chest, “All I need from you is to exterminate the monster in the house.”
“Probably a ferret,” Draco said darkly, remembering in a flash the pain and humiliation of that transformation in fourth year. Harry snorted with laughter.
Draco wakes in the dead of night to a new, horrible vision.
“It’s not so difficult. A basic quadrilatère is composed of four sets, each set having four movements, each movement taking four beats. So, the beat of the music sets the pace, obviously. I’ll demonstrate once on my own, and then we can do it together,” Draco said, trying to ignore the fact that a lost look was already starting to overcome Harry’s face, “We’d begin with the lead’s right hand on the partner’s left shoulder blade, partner’s left hand on the lead’s right shoulder, holding hands at shoulder level with the free hands. I’ll pretend as though I’m leading, with an invisible partner, so you can practice leading. Understood?”
“—from the grounds and then hex—”
“You taught them all Patronus charms,” Draco said, grabbing the stem of his crystal goblet and dragging it closer to himself, “Don’t give me that humble rot, Potter. I don’t believe it for a second.” Not trusting his mouth any further, Draco started in on his blackberry fool.
“Stop pitying me Potter, or—”
“I haven’t forgotten. But his mum lied to Voldemort for me. To his face.”
“Merlin. It hasn’t looked this good in ages,” Draco said, standing up to take a turn around the room, sliding his fingers over the dust-free lid of the piano, “It wasn’t like this when we came in, I’m sure of it. I would have noticed.”
“Any luck at all?” Harry asked. Misplaced optimism, Draco was sure of it.
“I mean, they have us run and do other agility stuff. But I’ve gotten into sport, actually, and been training up for that—going to the gym and everything. Been playing rugby, if you’ve heard of it. Muggle game. Just for fun: I’m only okay at it. But it’s distracting, and it’s nice, having friends who don’t think of anything when they see my scar. The muscles have gotten me attention in the wizarding world that I didn’t really want, though. Witch Weekly wanted me to do a pin-up photo shoot for a charity calendar.”
“Morning.” Draco inclined his head, grinning slightly at the irritating cat that endlessly wound itself around Aberforth’s legs, content with torturing its owner with indecision.
“Thanks.” Harry finally said. Relieved, for the moment.
“You don’t have to explain if you don’t want to. We can talk about it later.” He offered, gently, releasing Draco and taking a step back to give him space.
November 17th, 2008
. Draco was determinedly pacing around the cottage having dressed hours ago. His simple grey ceremonial robes having needed to be dried with magic near a dozen times already, sweating as much as he was. Harry was only just now in the loo, getting changed.
But, he suddenly realized that he did indeed still have hands and that they were attached to limbs, and that they could move according to his will. His hands were being brushed over something spongy in a small shallow pot, guided by Neville. The entire world seemed condensed into that small pot in his lap.
The spoon began to glow blue in their hands, illuminating Harry’s face before him, so similar to the glow of the blue bells during their ceremony. He barely had time to consider the thought before the uncomfortable sensation behind his navel jerked his midsection forward and pulled him into a cold whirlwind gale of magic. As the forest disappeared around him he saw Voileami and Flea launched themselves into the sky.
When his probation had finally ended in his 3rd year of Healer training, he applied to do a potions rotation in France. At this point, the panic attacks were a part of his routine. Make tea,
“Nothing is
“Isn’t it obvious?” Harry asked, grinning into Draco’s neck, gently tightening his hold around his waist. Clearly relishing their closeness.
He spun around on the spot in the alleyway and found himself standing face to face with Voileami.
Draco hoped he didn’t sound too petulant and defensive, frowning and crossing his arms. “Why aren’t we talking about your love life instead, you’re a war hero for Merlin’s sake, shouldn't you be swimming in admirers?”
—” she choked.
Harry shot him a look as if he couldn’t be sure of the subtle sarcasm. “You better be fucking joking, Malfoy.” He said with an unsure smirk.
“What does that
Pansy sighed dramatically. “If you must know, one of these is sparkling
At some point, Voileami had appeared in the room. Standing still as a statue by the door. No plodding hooves, no shrill nickering, no endearing snorting. She silently watched as Draco concentrated deeply on the work at hand.
“How did you find me?” Draco asked.
“No, I am not okay.” He said, trying not to take his anger out on Harry. He was so bloody handsome with sugar on his face and that stupid apron, and he was so fucking nice.
, he thought bitterly. What, with the disaster of Astoria, and now Charlie, pureblood and blood traitors alike, he was
Drowning.
“Harry Potter!” He gasped, his eyes wide, a smile forming into a huge grin upon his face, his hands wiped across his trousers quickly as he hurried forward, his hand outstretched, his face so eager. “Such a pleasu-” A murmur, a ripple of recognition, fear bubbling into excitement, into awe. The faces turned to him became beacons of fervent whispering worship.
Gregg and Luna were still in their pyjamas, wrapped in fluffy bathrobes, Luna complete with bunny slippers. Across from them draped on the old settee he and Harry had napped on earlier, carried down from the work room, Hestia looked regal. She was adorned with violet flower crowns and wrapped in purple and gold silk, her feet tucked neatly beneath layers of luxuriant fabric. Neville, who was perched at the far end of the same settee, was still wearing his gardening apron, a smudge of compost across his freckled cheek, as if he had been interrupted doing midnight replanting.
Draco looked back at him, trying to figure out how to even start. “So, I take it you don’t know anything about patronuses that change.” Draco tried again.
The forest around him made it’s usual night time noises - owl hoots and the chirruping of frogs, the rustling of wind in the towering trees. It was calming in it’s familiarity - the silence had been far more terrifying. As was the reminder that the world outside still existed, with all of it’s persistent evils. He heard a faint howl in the distance.
Cold and shivering magic settle around him, it felt relieved and oddly welcoming— as the wards do when he returned to the Manor. The door swung open to reveal a pitch black interior and a wave of musty dampness wafted out around him. As he stepped in he felt the house respond to his presence; the air felt less and less oppressive as he moved in through the front hall and the horrid smell began to dissipate.
Here he was, again. Deciding between life and death. Alone.
“Now yours.” Harry said, smiling at him.
“Gryffindors. 5th years mostly, but some 6ths as well. Calling me names and saying things. Saying things about my dad. And the war.” He shrugged, looking away out the window into the night. “It’s how it is. They want someone to punish. And here I am.”
“That’s true, you didn’t. She gave birth in the smallest corner of the room, between the wall and the bedside table, where no one could comfortably help her. Your father was a wreck— I don’t think he expected labour to be so real, so raw. He was cool as a cucumber right up until your mother vomited spectacularly on the oriental rug.” She chuckled at Draco’s startled laugh. “You were born in the caul, right onto the floor on a towel. When your mum tore the bag, you opened your eyes, but didn’t cry right away. You just looked at us, calm as you please. It wasn’t until your father started howling and crying that you joined in. But for the most part, you were the quietest new baby I ever saw.”
Harry was in recovery. He was just barely seven months sober, and he was scared and vulnerable and unsure of his hold on his sobriety without all of the complications of Draco’s erratic emotions. And fuck, on top of that, Harry had only just figured out he was gay. Even if he was fairly certain Harry had been subtly eye fucking him for a few weeks, Draco was 110% certain it was because of their isolation and the fact that Draco had been there, had helped him through the thick of it. Draco had been Harry's lifeline, and then they had traded places and Harry had proven that he could handle the things that Draco had given him to hold, and it was natural for them to feel bonded in the intensity. Any adoration from Harry must certainly be circumstantial.
“You know what I mean, Draco.” She said with a deadpan expression. She was the only one at the hospital who called him by his given name. He loved her for it.
“I’ve made you tea.”
He came with a loud cry, his orgasm washing through him as if pulled by a lunar tide. He fucked up into his fist, riding the last of the receding waves until the sensation was almost overwhelming and his cock was nearly flaccid again. He lay there feeling elated with his breakthrough. Floating on a cloud. The shame that normally broke through his post orgasmic haze only danced on his periphery, unable to gain entry into the hallowed space he had cultivated during his explorations.
He watched him curiously a moment, but the kettle began to whistle for tea, and Draco groaned from the mass of blankets at his back. Leaving the little vulcan to his newfound home, he busied himself with preparing tea, even cracking a few eggs and requesting several rashers for bacon, sniping with Draco gleefully as he made small efforts to drag himself from the warmth and comfort of their bed.
The door to Harry’s left swung open, revealing none other than Draco Lucius Abraxas Malfoy. Fucking Malfoy.
Greg’s look of indignation melted into one of sympathy and sheepishness. “I’m sorry Draco, I shouldn’t have touched you without asking, especially after we kind of cornered you.”
His eyes lifted to look at the row of four bottled potions. Each containing a deep velvety liquid of royal purple. Each labeled with the specific ingredient it was testing. All of them were blood cleansing potions, but he had made them with either tail hair, mane hair, saliva, or blood. He was planning to send samples with his research to the Department of Mysteries, along with a few theory papers on other potions he thought he could make.
Goosebumps crept across his shoulders and he sank deeper into his soft duvet, smiling to himself. He let the cosseting embrace of this new hunger mingle with the flutters of contentment that emanated from his core like the pure reflective light of a full moon. It engulfed him in new sensations of hopeful expectancy.
It must have shown clear on his face, for his father asked with a sharp voice, “What is it? What’s wrong?”
“Harry…” He said softly, watching the glowing form alight in the field behind Harry, shaking its head and snorting indignantly as it folded it’s impossibly large leathery wings.
The web of golden smoke emanating from the centre of the spell became brighter, more pronounced, encompassing more than just their garden and cottage. Draco could feel in his heart where the golden force was extending to. Covering miles of forest, following the spellwork Harry had placed to protect them weeks ago. The hollow would be safe. Sacred ground for them. For their thestrals.
By the time the sun finally agreed to rise, Harry had already made himself three cups of tea. He’d made Draco one as well, but it was so long ago that it’s long since gone frigid and is criminally oversteeped, and Harry knows that Draco will never deign to drink such swill, so he’s left it sitting beneath the windowsill.
Harry let out a great huff of air, smiling to himself. Draco’s last reply, three weeks after he had sent the letter, let him know he was still thinking of him too. He lay back on the rumpled sheets of his bed, the parchment resting on his bare chest as he waited for the ink to dry.
Harry just continued to watch him speculatively, sipping his mint tea. Draco suddenly realised he must be worried. About him. The git.
be excited, I’m supposed to be— I’ve worked so hard for this— to get here— but I’m honestly just—
“Are you sure you’re comfortable with this, I could always apparate back this evening after our dinner—”
Harry had never felt this magic before, especially not here, and he fumbled for a second, seeking it out, tracing it’s roots, letting it pull him toward it. There was a familiarness there. A sense of something. Something that smelled of dragonhide and tasted of a kiwi, just under-ripe, bursting with flavour, tempered with the smell of woodsmoke, the crackle of wet logs popping on the fire.
“And you are?”
“I know you’re a self-deprecating bastard, but think about it. You’re about as tightly wound as Filch on a Peeves hunt, and thin as a bowtruckle.”
“Oh, now it’s a pleasure, is it?” The taller one chuckled cruelly. “I knew you’d be more amenable to discussions when there wasn’t a door to slam in our face.”
Harry opened his eyes slowly, the dream fading instantly. The dried herbs hanging above him smelled sweet, and it instantly made him feel sick. Why did he have to take the top bunk?
Today was much the same as the days before, however, and Harry had come to like and appreciate the tireless ethic of the rather large and ungainly insect, bustling between the many blooms, pollen coating it’s black backside. He reached into a satchel he had been borrowing from Malfoy and pulled out one of the books on dark magic that Narcissa had sent.
He shrank his things and stowed them carefully in his pocket. Looking around his little dreary office, he said a quiet goodbye, closed the door behind him, and strolled towards the nurse's station.
Harry nearly groaned, realising Ron had been the one to find him, shrinking in shame against his crisp hospital sheets, starchy and thick. He could hear the fear beneath the attempt at humour in Ron’s voice. He let the guilt wash over him. Let it suffocate him.
Draco just sipped his tea and watched with great amusement as Harry repeatedly opened and closed the door, waiting for the house elves to work their magic.
“He gave it all up, in the end. The pureblood mania, the nonsense of it all, it caught up to him. He couldn’t watch people die. But, he didn’t feel like he could escape. He had no one to turn to, so he conspired with a house elf and gave up his life so that others may live.” Harry said finally, turning until his gaze met Draco’s, both of them facing each other.

to the blackness beyond the protective enchantments and began his watch.
“How bad is it?” He asked, clearly uncertain whether or not he wanted the answer.
“Enlighten me, professor.” Harry sighed.
Apparently fucking not. He looked up to see two thestrals walking towards him, and noticed the cut on his foot bleeding pretty badly. The smell probably drew them, but then again, they seemed to follow him anyways.
Coming back to St. Mungo’s had been a huge mistake, he thought bitterly to himself as he strolled through the too familiar and suffocating halls back to his office. Sprigg hadn’t changed one bit in the last year, and it seemed no one around him was aware that everything had changed for Draco. Draco felt completely separated from his surroundings and the others in it. His usually easy conversations with Unice were stilted and full of sympathetic sighs, which made Draco want to puke. He didn’t want anyone’s sympathy, he just wanted to be left alone.
She smiled sympathetically before putting her research face back on. “Okay, so, suicide attempts.” Draco marveled at how she could dissect concepts such as suicide with such cool, clinical precision. He was really beginning to understand her detachment from the esoteric concepts of death.
It was late. The sun had long since vanished from the sky and the hoots of owls were all that could be heard in the cold fall air outside the small window of Draco’s office. He was hunched over a scattering of parchments laid out across his large walnut desk, ticking off ingredients on a list for a potion concept that was evading him. Something that could be instrumental in his Haem work if he could just piece it together.
He reached out to smooth an errant curl from Harry’s disaster hairstyle as he huffed an endeared laugh at Mrs. Weasley’s expense. He was sure Ron would tell Harry what he had said to the Weasleys, but it felt too raw to bring it up now.
He took a deep breath, letting the love of everyone gathered wash over him and saying what he needed before he lost his nerve, “I think- I think I’d like a hug now… please.”
Malfoy nodded again, and Harry relaxed considerably. The looming threat of advanced healing potions out of the way, he realised that this was something he could handle. He had never seen someone have one before, but they had had a training seminar once, a few years ago, for when victims of crimes or people on the scene have one. It was mostly about just being calm and quiet and comforting in a respectful way, and Harry thought he could be rather good at that. He sat and rubbed Malfoy’s back and refrained from asking any more questions.
Harry was smirking unconcernedly at Draco’s rambling rants.
“No. No one knew. No one could, or your life would have been in considerably more danger than it ever was. And, as I’m sure you remember, your life was in near constant peril.”
“The lesson that you all were supposed to have learned from the war. From me. From all of us who died. Was that caring, that opening your heart, loving, being kind, these are far more powerful forces, far more primal magic, than any curses, hexes or jinxes. I am only alive today because of love. Voldemort rose to power in the absence of it. To hate children just for the legacy of their family is a doctrine of his, not mine. It is a product of fear. Of spiteful, ignorant hate. And I could not be more disappointed to hear that it is now being espoused by those who are using my name to excuse it.”
Harry sat in the tea room, slowly picking at muesli and yoghurt with bananas and strawberries, a glass of orange juice on his left. He had awoken from another night full of dreams, thick and molten, like memories, all of which refused to fade in the light of a new day.
Draco cringed internally at the thought of how he had acted that day. But he didn’t want to let on to Harry. “Of course I won’t laugh. Don’t you trust me?”
March 09, 2008
“The thestrals! They led me through the forest down into this gorge and up a cliff face to their lair!” Draco was gesticulating wildly with excitement, but Harry just looked more and more concerned.
They lost their pants some time after, and Draco put a hand on his wand long enough to cast the necessary spells before grabbing Harry by the hip, leaning forward to speak into his ear, “Go on and brace yourself against the headboard, Potter. Unless you’ve got a better idea.”
“That’s right.” Ron said. “This case is closed before it’s started, and really, this is mostly a formality to see
Chapter Sixteen – Beginning
Potter’s blood contaminant numbers were off the charts.
do everything.”
“My poor bonsais.” Draco sniffed, his head now tucked against Harry’s shoulder. “They’re probably irreparably damaged.”
He wondered if he should give his little thestral escort a name. It only seemed right. That way, he could address her properly when they spoke. He turned slightly as he walked and reached out to touch her face. She seemed to enjoy that. As he felt the fuzz of her nose and smooth tight leather of her skin as he contemplated what to call his companion.
Draco allowed himself the time he had, nearly laying on top of Harry, to just imagine what it would be like. Something he had never really comfortably done since the war. Sex always felt overwhelming and scary, even if he wanted the closeness quite desperately, and he tried to be comfortable with the idea of actually being physical with someone.
“You’re the only one in this entire building who wears shoes that click like you’re about to start tap dancing.” She said, with zero humor, still not looking up at him.
Feeling buoyant in the face of Felix’s diminishing curse and returning magic, he led the young man back out of the exam room to tell Juniper to pencil him into the schedule for next month’s appointment.
The walls, floor, and ceiling were the same monotone slabs of shiny black granite, giving the place a look of wetness. It reminded him of Voileami’s cave, he thought with an ache in his heart, but not as beautiful. No glowing moss, no artful nests. The light from the numerous torches on the wall seemed to be sucked into the blackness of the granite. He honestly didn’t know how the receptionist could see anything on the parchment in front of her.
“Do you ever miss it?” Harry asked quietly, watching Flea fly high above them as they walked down the sloping lawn to the gates.
“Won’t you be late for Luna’s? It’s nearly 10.”
Harry wretched and heaved and spit bile into the toilet. Sweat was dripping off his nose, drool spilling from his lip, hanging down from his mouth. The force of his heaving stomach had made his eyes water, but he didn’t know now if he was just tearing up or sobbing outright. Everything was running together, the violent spasms of his gut, his stuttering lungs and pounding heart. In his head all he could hear was this is it, Harry, you’re going to die. You have no choices left.
Draco snorted. “No you berk. Honestly, how vain do you think I am?” Then he added seriously. “I just don’t want to add another layer to your Gryffindor guilt complex.”
Harry’s mouth was hanging open. “You’re friends with Neville? Neville Longbottom? Our Neville? And Neville saw you have a panic attack?”
There were dozens and dozens of beautifully constructed round nests of woven sticks that were blanketed with green moss, some of the glowing algae, and leaf litter. The cave was huge and wide and there must have been near 100, that he could see, of the giant winged beasts all meandering between the large nests, greeting tiny foals, bringing food, and cleaning one another.
Oh thank fuck, was Draco’s first thought. Fuck, not again, was his second.
_______________________
This was it, as soon as he opened his eyes and they noticed he was awake, he’d have to start explaining what was going on. He’d lose his job, he’d probably lose his friends, he’d be a disgrace. He was a disgrace. The thought of the Daily Prophet getting hold of this juicy bit of gossip made him burn with anxiety.
A few short minutes later it rang, and within moments, a quiet young man with large eyes and a soft face was sitting in the plush chair, watching him with unblinking eyes. He looked tired. Worried. His fingers fiddling endlessly with an elastic hair tie on his wrist, as though he didn’t even realize he was doing it.
“Feels nice, right?” Neville asked softly, “Deep breath, good. Doesn’t that smell better?”
“I’m just having a hard time believing that you’re not seeing someone. You just look too… pleased with yourself.”
I appreciate your Halloween invite, and I know you’re worried about me being a hermit, but I am really in my element and I’m not lonely. Like I said, the thestrals keep me plenty of company.
Harry didn’t look angry or even upset, but Draco’s stomach twisted in knots. He knew he should have swallowed his pride and penned a fucking letter that just said
The thought of sharing his secret and quiet relationship with Harry with the rest of the world was unnerving and exposing. The thought of telling Pansy that they would not be drinking in his home was an uncomfortable one. He’d better get it over with. Uncapping his favourite muggle pen, he wrote;
Harry quietly came to sit at their small table. “I suppose that makes sense.” He said, his shoulders finally relaxing. “When Hermione had Rose, Ron sent me about a dozen owls, panicking all the while. I wasn’t any better off.”
“Well, you know, Unspeakables under a certain clearance rank aren’t allowed in certain areas or access to certain information, it’s something you earn over time. And, obviously, I hadn’t been promoted to that level yet— never realised how deep the secrets went. After the three of us with Kingsley carefully combed through all the bylaws pertaining to the DoM, we managed to find a few loopholes that allowed us to audit and investigate the department. We found some compelling evidence to present to the Wizengamot, and we were able to pass some bills that granted us access to, well—
“Are you going to tell me what all the yelling was about? I was in the middle of something very delicate and important, Potter. This is not the day for interruptions…” His voice trailed away as he caught sight of something coming gliding over the trees behind Harry, illuminated against the blue violet sky, and his mouth hung open, his eyes going wide.
“Mrs. Malfoy, please, call me Harry.” He had replied politely, confidently, reaching for her hand. “I’m here to introduce myself as your son’s suitor.”
Draco took a deep breath and asked resignedly. “Okay, do you really want to have this discussion?”
A twig snapped behind him and he jumped. Voileami ambled through the snow amidst the trees towards the valley below, following her own path a few paces besides Draco’s own. He stood and watched her walk, a flood of uncertain feelings swirling in his midsection. He wasn’t sure what to feel towards her at the moment. He loved her, yes. She had watched over him for more than a year now, yes. She allowed him to heal people in ways that others could only dream, yes.
Draco’s pleasure and ability to access it shouldn’t be hung up on the perverted choices of an irredeemable soul. He could have it, and Lestrange couldn’t touch it. It could be for him and him alone. For him and for whomever he chose to share it with.
He scribbled his response and sent it off with the waiting owl before dashing back to his cauldron to finish off his work.
45 minutes later, Draco was panting and sweating as they came through the trees in front of the cottage. He carefully lowered a very groggy, also sweating Potter, who grunted a little at the contact with the ground. Stumbling as Harry stood on shaky legs, Draco helped him slump up the steps to the front door.
“You want me to wear a
come! And besides,” She continued vehemently, “Theo, and Flora, and Hestia… We’re all Slytherins and we need to support each other.” She looked determined, righteous.
Draco stepped out of the doors to the curse damage ward as several Aurors shoved past. He’d just come off a 24-hour call.
Reverently, he pulled his duvet out of the crumpled cardboard box and shook it out as Harry crept back onto the half-made bed from the floor. After fitting it with a new duvet cover, a dark burgundy, he threw it onto their bed, covering Harry completely.
She gave him a wicked grin before moving to stand in front of Harry. “Potter.” She said, with all the authority she could muster at speaking to the man who killed Voldemort.
He knew that Harry wouldn’t begrudge him for not being ready, knew that his acceptance and admission of their feelings could be enough for right now. His smile was victorious and full of love.
Lucius’s eyes were as bright as the last time Draco had seen them and he knew in that instance that, while Lucius’s body may be deteriorating, his mind was as sharp as it ever was.
”. Draco had to count to 10 before dealing with absurdity that they could ever think he’d want to use unicorn blood to somehow bring back the dark lord.
The Little Dipper
“We’ll all support that decision.” He finished. Before he could remove his hand, Harry’s reached out and grabbed it tightly and he nodded stiffly, seemingly too overwhelmed to speak.
“To help remind myself that even the Savior of the wizarding world is also human.” Malfoy shrugged. “Do you want it back?” He asked, finally looking up into Harry’s bewildered expression.
“No, no!” Draco said. “Nothing like that.” He sighed and slumped forward, running his hands through his too long fringe. “It’s just. She’s under the impression that I’ve been out here all these long months in near total isolation and she’s worried that that’s having a negative impact on me. And the things I need to discuss with her are the exact opposite of isolation, so I’ll have to tell her I haven’t been alone. And I just wanted to talk to you about it because this is supposed to be a your place of refuge as well and I didn’t think it was fair to out you, even if not by name, without discussing it with you first. Do you see?”
Harry was guiding Draco with determined steps as the Aurors came up the hall, looks of panicked concern on their faces at the sight of so many haunted, hungry beasts crowding the cell.
“No, Harry, trust me, you don’t—” She said seriously. Rose quietly watched her mother, no longer waving the spoon. “There were people being kept down there— Muggles. Wizards. Squibs. Children, even. The experiments we found—”
Sirius and Remus were with him, for all of his failures and all of his work he’d done recovering, his parents too. For those we love never truly leave us. Dumbledore’s words echoed in his head as he cast his own patronus and watched it take flight in the afternoon sky, stark white next to his all black companions.
______________
Harry pushed his shoulders down and walked ahead into the dark where he knew he’d find the staircase, the lights popping in and out of order as he made his way up to the third floor, to Sirius’s old room. He needed the comfort of something familiar. He needed to feel less alone. Somehow, in his addled state, his dead godfather’s bedroom was the answer to how helpless he felt.
Draco was shaking his head fondly at Harry, unable to hide the glowing adoration he felt for him in his moments of joy at the thought of his DA students.
He decided that since it was his birthday, he wasn’t going to work on his dead end research. He had spent every morning since receiving the unicorn blood experimenting with it in his potions corner of the cottage. He was determined to put it through every feasible test he could to determine that it was indeed useless. He felt absolutely defeated, convinced that his entire sabbatical would be for nothing. No matter what he did to the unicorn blood, it made every remedy, every potion, every spell not only useless but sometimes even dangerous. The blood cleaning potion he tried to make with it ate its way through the beaker he poured it into. There was no way he could have fed that to someone, let alone someone ill.
Honestly, how did he stand a chance to be a kind child with this woman raising him?
Harry debated slipping the coaster and whatever was beneath it into his pocket. His experience with cocaine hadn’t been very positive. He didn’t like how his heart raced and his thoughts got even louder. He already had enough adrenaline in his day to day life, what with the flashbacks and the startling so easily, and the fact that his job as an Auror put him in constant mortal danger. However, on the plus side, he had managed to keep an erection, fuck someone and orgasm, even if it did end in confusing thoughts of Malfoy and his wallet being stolen. Harry swallowed.
CUBICULO SURSUM RESPICERE”

“No, really. I hate agapanthus.” He continued, after seeing the apparent look of incredulity on Draco’s face. “My aunt had them in her garden and she fawned over them in the grossest way. I used to poison them when she wasn’t looking.”
Draco narrowed his eyes in response “I suppose.” He finally let out, searching Potter’s worn and angry face. “If you say so, Potter.”
“Fine.” Severus said shortly. “But we’re coming back to this later.”
This curse was another one that festered— like Felix’s. Attacking Lucius’s magical core, wasting him. It progressed slowly, insidiously. It could have been counteracted in its infancy, when the mirror was first broken, but usually by the time the victim realizes they’re sick, it was almost always too late. And, in Lucius’s case, having been trapped in the literal 9th layer of hell that was Azkaban, he had been far too weak to fight it. If he hadn’t been imprisoned all this time, he may well have lived another ten years before anyone realized he was ill.
Hermione stood, forgoing all formalities of the appointment, and hauled Draco into a crushing hug. “I’ll see you Saturday for the
Harry’s furrowed brow and thin mouth echoed this sentiment.
Neville’s brows creased in thought, “Do they?” He asked gently. “How often?”
Harry’s face was ernest - his green eyes bright and full of sincerity, of regret and determination all at once.
“I’ve always felt drawn to go through the veil.” Harry’s voice came quietly through the dark. They were wrapped together in their duvet, a fire burning in the grate, Harry’s body like a furnace against him. Draco had finally showered upon returning home and picked the remaining detritus out of his hair before allowing Harry to pull him under the covers. He felt properly warm for the first time in days.
He walked to the arched doorway to the kitchen and saw Harry and Greg fused together in a tight hug, rocking slightly on the spot. He stopped short at the endearing sight, not wanting to interrupt them and leaned against the wall in the shadows. He could hear Greg mumbling something into Harry’s shoulder, his face hidden. He could see Harry nodding and whispering back.
Draco went over his research from top to bottom starting with the unicorn conundrum and his (and Potter’s) theory on soul purity, finally ending with the thestral blood and his nonexistent theory on that. Severus nodded along and asked sporadic questions.
Harry rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet, his hands shoved in his tattered black jeans pockets. “Come on, Malfoy, let’s go!” He yelled at the cottage, eager to get started on helping Draco with his patronus charm.
“Well this is fucking weird.” Harry mused, tiredly, almost smiling.
“Out.” Harry said, his voice thick, throwing his jacket on over the sweater and pushing open the door, before he lost his nerve. Before he apologised to Draco for something he didn’t do wrong, for something he didn’t regret.
Hogsmeade was the same. And different. Like Harry and Draco. It had been rebuilt, painstakingly, but with so much honesty. With homage to pain. To the war. To the sacrifice of love.
Harry knelt in the mass of ruined flesh, once so organised, so thick with life. He reached his hands forward, loops of bowel sliding between outstretched fingers, oily and discordant and so very warm. Hot. He swiped them aside, the sea of writhing eels, moving deeper, hands seeking the edges of something more solid. Heavier. The source of that gentle thrum. He could no longer hear Flea behind him, for his thoughts, everything, was obliterated by the feel of that magic. Just beyond his grasp. Calling to him. Rhythmic. As if it were breathing. Singing.
Draco was mildly astonished by the admission and comfort with which she spoke about it. It was nice, it felt almost like having a friend. Whatever those were. “And the shit people prattle on about you in this gossip mill is nonsense. If anyone was actually paying attention they’d know you’re clearly too soft to be evil. Eat your chocolate.”
“She wrote to me again, you know.”
After long moments of quiet, an owl hooted, the call eerie and single. Further down into the forest valley, another owl answered.
______________
“What if I can’t do it.” He asked, looking away. His knees were drawn up to his chest, his arms around them, curling into himself as tightly as possible.
Harry stood a moment, revelling in the petite mort, his mind blissfully blank and his desire quelled for the moment. He did a quick cleaning spell and lowered himself down into the hot bath, feeling more at ease than he had in months, dropping low into the water, eyes closed and the heat wrapping itself around him. It was long before he felt the need to get out.
He sighed. “Yes. I’ve seen one other.”
“I mean it.” Harry said sighing and coming to sit across from Draco on the rug. He took Draco’s mangled knitting from his hands and put it aside. “I know we’ve danced around this and talked a bit about topping or bottoming— as if its some kind of inevitability, or some kind of pinnacle of sexual expression or intimacy— but— it's not. We don’t have to ever do it.”
Greg laughed openly and looked between them. Draco had a shrewd suspicion he knew what was happening.
Consciousness eventually left him, and his features finally relaxed, the grimace that had been holding his secrets for the last two years melted away, his glasses resting skew across closed eyes. He was out cold.
He was still smirking to himself at the thought when a crash immediately to his left made him jump out of his chair.
“Did you tell a teacher, Teddy?”
“Yeah, well, I can’t believe no one at the hospital picked up what was going on with you and sent you home with orders for bed rest, but here we are!” Draco finished dramatically, indicating how unbelievable their predicament was, completely ignoring Harry’s second question.
Draco stretched and cracked his tense back, he knew he would be here with his paperwork for a while. Good, he thought sourly. He needed all of the distraction he could get.
“Um— right—” He said more loudly, trying to inject some normality and authority in his voice. “So, Harry and I are going to perform the spell under the wiggentree just over here— We’ll need all of you to stand around us in a circle. Have you all been practising the incantation?”
“Who else was on the list?” Draco asked, trying to anchor himself to the conversation. His voice coming out gruffer than he had anticipated.
“We can’t.” Draco said quietly into the silence, in response to their magic twining around them, it was like his new mantra he was chanting inside his head to keep him on track. To keep him strong.
Harry cleared his throat, seeming to come back to himself and making a decision. “Yeah—Yes. Me too.” He got up and hugged Luna, more soundly this time, clearly less afraid of breaking her.
Harry vanished the tree to the snow covered clearing outside their cottage before apparating there himself, ignoring the butterflies that had appeared in his stomach at the idea that he wanted Draco to be impressed by the tree he had found. He wanted Draco to know he’d cut it down for them both, that he wanted Christmas to be special for them both. He wanted Draco to feel full of the same joy and cheer, to feel full of love.
She was endeavouring to make Draco feel like he could still belong to his family and legacy if he wanted it. He wasn’t sure how to process that or even engage with it. I mean really, he thought, what was he suppose to write back, thanks for the porn?
“Okay.” Said Harry slowly. “I don’t quite get why you’re so nervous if all you want to do is talk to your therapist about having a flat-mate.” He looked speculatively at Draco. “Unless, I’m doing something horribly offensive that you haven’t told me? Is that why you’ve been so tetchy?”
Draco’s face felt bright and hot; his heart alive with rigorous indignation. Harry was breathing hard, eyes bright behind his glasses. If he wasn’t angry, at least he was frustrated, and that was something Draco liked a hand and a foot over pity. He smiled, sharp and slender, and felt like himself for the first time in a long time.
“What’s the matter with it?” Pansy asked with indelicate disgust as Draco led her from the entry hall into the sitting room, “It wasn’t this bad when I left. Have you lost control of your elf or something?”
“I’m not a tough audience,” Harry said, “And I’ve never played an instrument, so you’ve got that on me. Let’s hear it, Draco.”
“No idea,” Draco said, and his fingers drifted towards his wand with a mind to cast a time-telling charm, but Harry was already tugging up his sleeve a bit to peer at a golden, star-spangled wrist-watch.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, which Draco didn’t want to hear. But there was a charming note of earnestness in his voice, like so much about Harry.
“About the house,” Harry said, nodding at the sad curtains and the windows, which had become increasingly opaque, week by week, “Is there really something the matter with it?” It would have been a relief that someone, at least, didn’t think anything of all the Manor’s glaring defects if it hadn’t been such a horrible thought that this is what Potter believed it was meant to look like. After weeks of staring at it and despairing over it, watching it grow worse and worse, as though it was rotting around him, with Mimsy in a tizzy no matter how many times he told her he didn’t think the state of the house was a statement on her work ethic. Considering what his parents would say if they saw it now, what his father would say—and maybe that was even optimistic, since his father hadn’t said a word to anyone since shortly after his trial. It had become an unbearable place, yet somehow also the only place Draco could bear to be, even though it seemed intent on driving him out with Shades and Vampiric Moths and now some unnamed horror… Draco gave a high, humorless laugh; a manic substitute for tears.
“What are you doing?”
“You’re supposed to turn all the way around,” Draco prompted, trying to hide a twitch of a smile. To which Harry turned another three quarters around, instead of just turning back the way he’d come, forcing Draco to fumble along with him. “Aradia’s ashes, Potter, half turn. Half turn.”
“Do they have—” Draco began, before realizing that, against all odds, they were almost certainly here in response to the letter he’d sent yesterday. Why would they send Potter out on a minor errand like banishing a Boggart, partner in tow? Unless, of course, they wanted to check up on the ex-Death Eater and the Malfoy Estate at the same time. Draco sighed, tossed the paper aside and rose. “Show them in,” He said, “I wrote to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement yesterday. Tell them I’ll be down in a minute,” He paused, wrestling with his old grudge against Weasley in particular, before adding, “They have the hospitality of the estate, if they want it. Tea, coffee, a bite to eat. Whatever they like. I may be a little while. And try not to look so horrified, Mimsy. Potter will think I’m abusing you and engineer a way to set you free.” With a full-body shudder, Mimsy disapparated.
“Can’t you do anything about that, Mimsy?” Draco asked, staring listlessly at the floor of the drawing room, which had adopted a greyish tinge.
“It could never trouble Mimsy to take care of Master Malfoy,” Mimsy said with delight. Once again, she’d managed to put herself directly between him and Harry, and was pointedly ignoring the Auror. “Poor Master Malfoy has hardly been eating anything. And what is I to do if you is wasting away? I will be making you something very nice. Something good for your constitution.” And with a sharp crack, she disapperated. Draco sighed, and massaged the bridge of his nose. Something told him that dinner would be far more elaborate than bread and soup. Harry looked over at him, a familiar expression of puzzlement twisting his mouth.
“Oh, please. Potter doesn’t want—”
“I have first-hand accounts of what an excellent teacher you were in fifth year,” Draco reminded him. He was almost positive Harry flushed with embarrassed pride. Merlin, he had to stop that.
“What are you talking about? I don’t have to ‘want’ it, it’s right there. I mean, you’re going to give it back to me when you’re done, aren’t you?” And that was exactly the sort of attitude he should have known Harry would have. Because out of all the wizards in the country, only Harry Potter didn’t feel a touch of anxiety when someone else was holding his wand.
“I’m pretty sure we’re on first-name terms, Draco,” Harry said, still smiling that
“Do you have any childhood memories with her you really treasure? Bedtime stories, walks together, cooking together, anything like that?” And once again Draco had to laugh, because Potter certainly had no idea how a proper wizarding house was run.
“Absolutely not,” Draco said at the same time as Weasley growled, “No way.”
“Oh no, Potter, of course not!” He drawled, “I like lumps under my carpet and dull floors and windows I can barely see out of. It’s always been my deepest desire to live in a house that looks like it’s been abandoned for twenty years and refuses to get warm. You thought I wanted to live somewhere nice? As soon as I got the chance, after all the work my mother did after the war to make the place decent again, I really put my back into turning it miserable.” Draco wanted Harry to lose his temper with him. To call him a prat or go bitter and broody. Like that would set the world to rights. But so much had changed since they had left school. Harry had gotten more patient with maturity, and maybe Draco had become more transparent. Either way, once again Potter didn’t have a comeback.
"Ron would love that. Doubt it is, since you’ve got a grudge against them. Might be a cat. Seems like you’re a bit aloof sometimes, like a cat. Do you only want a scratch behind the ears when everyone’s working?” Harry asked, with a tone that Draco might have taken as flirtation if he hadn’t been grinning quite so widely. As it was, stuck between the understatement of ‘a bit aloof sometimes’ and the sheer ridiculousness of the ear-scratching question, Draco found himself open-mouthed and tongue-tied. Harry cut in again before Draco managed to get a word out, “Oh, don’t look like that. I was only playing around… Look at that. It’s dark out. What time is it?”
“Couldn’t tell you,” Draco drawled, flicking his wand threateningly at a Welsh Pixie who was approaching with too much enthusiasm to be trusted, “The last time I was here it was working fine.” But that had been nearly a year ago. And before Draco could even mull over just how pathetic his guardianship of his family’s property was, Potter was on his arse on the wet rocks, tugging off his boots. “What
“I wouldn’t say no to one,” Harry said, cracking a smile, “Just don’t tell Hermione. I’m meant to be trying to wean off, and practice meditation.”
“Exactly, you got something,” Harry said, squeezing Draco’s shoulder with a strong, warm hand, “That’s brilliant! Now you know you can do it. It just takes finding a better memory and getting in the right frame of mind. We’ll get there. Now come on. Give it another go. Just to get a feel for it.”
“Yeah? You’re sure about that? He wanted you dead for years. He acts like something other than scum one time and—”
Despite the unfamiliar bed company and the events that had passed just an hour earlier, it had been a long time since Draco had been swept to sleep so quickly and peacefully.
“Seems great to me,” He said, setting the boots down by the footboard and looking around with what looked like sincere appreciation, “Honestly, Draco, your whole house is so posh that it’s hard for me to see what’s wrong with it. My aunt and uncle would probably find something to complain about, after they got done drooling over the crown molding and the chandeliers and the number of fireplaces. I mean, it seems old. But it is old, right? You were talking about your great-great-great grandparents, or whatever. So I don’t even think it’s a bad thing. Not that I don’t think it should be fixed—” Harry said quickly, as Draco opened his mouth to protest, “But I’m just saying, it looks like something a historical society would care about preserving. So to me, someone who’s never lived here, it looks fine. And whatever Ron was talking about—it feeling bad, or whatever—I’m not getting it. Except for that first attack, I’ve been having a pretty good time, actually.” Was that heartfelt too? A simple compliment to cheer him up? Was he actually flirting? Harry’s eyes glittered, pupils wide in the shadow of the room, “You’re not a bad host, you know.” Pixie shit, he was flirting. Why in the heavens would he do a thing like that? Feeling like a tea kettle about to start whistling with panic rising from his heart to his ears, Draco cleared his throat.
“Lumos mobilis,” Harry said, and an orb of yellow light darted out to hang in the hallway, revealing nothing. “What’s going on?” He asked with a tone of firm urgency, neither relinquishing his hold on Draco nor lowering his wand.
“You’d be surprised,” Harry said, and finally looked away from Draco. That was enough to puncture his rage but left him buzzing still with a dulled sort of electricity. He didn’t know what to say to that. Potter was confounding without even seeming to try. Harry took another deep, slow breath, and then nodded towards the hedges. “Come on. We’re not getting anywhere right now. Want to show me around the gardens for a bit? I’d like a walk.” And for reasons Draco didn’t entirely understand, that didn’t sound like the worst thing in the world.
It was Harry’s turn to laugh. “Alright, alright! Sorry. Something with your family, then. You can’t tell me you’ve never been happy. I don’t believe that.”
Addled nightmares of figures, masked and robed, moving through the grounds and towards the house, blurred into waking. Draco could feel clammy sweat under his shirt and against the back of his neck, and his heart racing as though he’d just run up a flight of stairs. His mouth was dry as paper. He opened his eyes. His bedroom was cast in the weird half-light of the dying fire. Draco tried to draw breath. His body refused to obey his command. He tried to lift his hands, to kick his legs—nothing. He lay like a corpse, unable to do anything but stare up at the ceiling, waiting for his consciousness to fail. Unbidden, his chest rose and fell. Mist drifted from his nose: the air was winter-cold. Something drifted into the edges of his sight. But this time, unlike the fearful movements of the illusory insects in the wallpaper, it continued to move into his field of vision with stately slowness.
‘You are of course welcome to join us any time,’ The most recent one had read, Draco crouched over a writing desk that felt as though it had shrunk by a decent ten percent, ‘The Mediterranean air is doing wonders for your father’s health, and the gardens at the cottage are in full bloom.’ They had gone to the smaller French estate after the trials to escape the unpleasantness lingering in Britain, and in the hope that the change in climate would benefit his father’s flagging health. Either out of pride or sheer indifference, Draco had not accompanied them. He was still not sure which.
. They look straight out of a skin mag.”
Fingernails digging into his palms, Draco dragged himself to his own bedroom. The room had a distinctive scent of Mrs Skower's, partially covered by sage and lavender: three dried bouquets of the stuff were arranged in porcelain vases around the room. It was obvious Mimsy had gone to work here, taking advantage of Draco’s longest sojourn away from his bedroom in nearly a year. But the place still looked like hell. Though not the first affected place in the manor, his bedroom was certainly one of the worst hit. The warmth and heat of the fire died just feet away from the grate. The floors seemed scuffed by the dragging of iron-shod feet. Mimsy had pulled the curtains closed here, to shut out the night and hide the disastrous glass, but they looked moth-eaten, and Draco could smell the bittersweetness of rot rolling off them, even through the cleaning product and the dried bouquets. The wallpaper—green vines on cream—that had once appeared to flutter in a breeze at his command, now looked wilted and sickly. Along the walls, there were brief flashes of movement. Here. There. Always in the corners of his eyes. Not like the wind in leaves. Much more like furtive, darting insects. Feeling like a puppet with its strings cut, Draco fell heavily onto his bed. The bedframe lurched and groaned, shifted, but held. Draco closed his eyes and rubbed his knuckles into them. Even when something was handed to him, he was helpless to do anything but fuck it up. He lay there for a long time in the chill dim, on top of the covers, not able to pull together the energy to even remove his own boots. Amazing, really, how he could be so useless.
“Malfoy’s not going to hurt me, Ron. If he wanted to, this would be a really stupid way to do it, anyway.”
It had been years—years! —since Draco had so much as touched the thing, but between the age of six and the summer after his fourth year, his parents had hired a tutor for him. Once upon a time he had been quite good, until other, darker pursuits had claimed his time and his hands. He stared at it, considering the dragon ivory keys with their opalescent patina, carefully cultivated by hundreds of years of use under his family’s fingers. The instrument had a lovely voice, too, with strings made of copper-wrapped dragon heartstring, and the whole thing was goblin-made. It was probably one of the most expensive things in the house. Beautiful and irreplaceable, gleaming in the pale sunlight. Draco stared at it for a span of minutes, until his eyes grew tired of it, then he looked away, across the estate’s dark forests and gardens, overgrown now and starting to go to seed. He should hire someone to look after it, even if it would mean paying a premium to win them over to working on the Malfoy Estate. Once it would have been a choice position, to be head gardener to an old wizarding family of good name. Though, of course, that was the problem, wasn’t it? The Malfoy name wasn’t so good anymore.
“I suppose we should have some music, then,” Draco said, staring at the piano with some mistrust. There was nothing quite like the thought of your parents’ dead bodies crammed into the frame of an instrument to make it unappealing to play. But the room didn’t have the same menacing chill that it had suffered with the other day, and Harry was watching him with thrilling curiosity, so Draco seated himself at the bench, fingers stroking the conditioned ivory. It was almost as warm as a living being, itself. He looked at book on the piano’s music rack and cleared his throat, “Léandrés’s
“Blimey. It’s past four. I was sure Ron would be back by now,” Harry said. The bothered little crease was back between Harry’s eyebrows. Clearly Harry had been expecting Weasley and Granger to work their magic quicker. Maybe Draco had held out hope despite himself, too, because something chilly settled in his guts, and his tongue felt tacky against the roof of his mouth. Aurors and other Ministry employees working first shift clocked out at 5:00 PM. In less than an hour, Harry was going to be off-duty, and but for Mimsy, Draco was going to be alone in the house. The thought of returning to his room and rousing in a cold sweat in the dead of night to face a living nightmare turned his stomach quite sour. He tensed his jaw, holding his shoulders firm.
“Right. Okay. Have you ever been in love?”
They started out around the cobbled paths bordered by low hedges and bushes, mostly not in season, rather weedy and in need of pruning, but still lush and lively. Draco pointed out several beds containing St. Gertrude’s Butterfly Bushes, which were rustling too much to be muggle plants, considering how little wind there was. “At one point, they were nearly extinct,” He said, “Almost every one grown today is a descendent of grafts donated by the Estate.”
“You’re an Auror, not a groundskeeper,” Draco said, but apparently Harry didn’t care about that any more than he did getting wet feet or risking a fall on the slick rocks. He just kept wading deeper.
Draco had never seen Mimsy looking more frigid than when she poured tea for Harry; shooting Draco a questioning look before retreating quickly into the hall. Harry’s gaze followed her with evident concern. Draco sighed. “She used to serve the Lestrange family,” He said with a lazy wave of his hand, “So she holds a bit of a grudge against Aurors in general, and you in particular. You and your kind killed Auntie Bellatrix and Uncle Rodolphus, you see.” Harry opened his mouth, looking more than a little defensive, but Draco cut him off, “Not that I
“Oh, yeah. They went on strike—stopped cleaning Gryffindor Tower because she was stashing hats everywhere. Only Dobby was willing to do anything in there,” Harry said, and Draco felt a tug of a smile in his stomach and on his lips, though he let his gaze rest safely on the flames lapping up in the fireplace.
Draco wanted to open his mouth. To run. To grab his wand. But he was helpless to so much as blink. He lay paralyzed at the foot of his bed, as a pale face looked down at him. Skin like a cave creature, whose great-grandparents had died knowing only stories of the sun, translucent and mildew-damp, was pulled over harsh bones. Its cheeks were webbed with fine venules, and blue veins bulged in its neck and under its eyes. Great, grey eyes, wet and bloodshot in the red emberlight. Its hair was long, long as his father’s, lank and matted as it had been in the weeks following the trial. But its pointed chin and finely chiseled nose were not his father’s. And those eyes—those eyes were not his father’s either. His own twisted doppelganger stared down at him.
“I apologized, obviously. Extensively. I told her that this was her home, and I was happy to share it with her; that I valued her work and was sorry if I had appeared ungrateful. I was fairly certain that she’d despise the suggestion in the first place, but after Dobby, and after Granger had been right about so much else, I thought that I should extend the offer,” Draco said, exhaling a slow, deflated breath. Beyond that, too, he’d been ashamed of his own condition. He hadn’t wanted any more witnesses to his disgrace. “That put her in a good mood straight away, and she’s been incredibly doting ever since. I’ll tell you this, house elves aren’t shy about showing when they’re displeased with their situation. Everyone could tell Dobby was miserable. Mimsy was upset when I suggested she might prefer to be on her own, and punished me for my insolence. You saw how the Black Family house elf responded when he felt he was being pawned off to an unworthy wizard. And surely Granger received some form of complaint from the Hogwarts house elves during her campaigning?” Harry laughed at that.
“Then the partners are reunited, then 1-2-3-and forward, backwards,” Draco made first two quarter-turn steps that he had performed in the first set, slow and easy, bringing him opposite of Harry again. “Front step,” Draco said, stepping straight across the imaginary circle, elbow almost brushing Harry’s side, “Back step,” And Draco took a light step backwards, into the space he’d just vacated. “So, you end at the other side of the circle, facing the opposite direction. And the pattern continues. You end in your original place every other time, and you remain contained to a circle. It makes it fairly easy not to bump into other people at balls. And that’s all there is to it: turning around the circle, making a square in the circle, revolving around the circle, then the half circle turn. A basic quadrilatère.”
“Yeah, most people prefer unicorns I guess. They’re just so... pure. They make people feel like there is such a thing as absolute good in the world.”
Draco sighed. “Not if you’re going to let it ruin your day. I’d rather keep it on, thanks.” He said with a sardonic laugh.
The smell of copper was gone from the air.
“I see.” Ginny said, eyeing Draco. “Well, we could go out when you’re done with Malfoy.” She pressed.
“ —please— Draco — Gods— I —” Harry was babbling nonsensically and Draco lifted his face, his lips feeling swollen.
Harry startled as he felt a soft presence at his left wrist. Looking down to see Malfoy’s hand nudging against him.
Oh thank fuck, was Draco’s first thought. Fuck, not again, was his second.
“You alright?” Harry asked, unsure what to do in this situation. He was overwhelmed with curiosity - did Malfoy have nightmares since the war? Were they the same things that Harry had nightmares about?
. He had written after that appointment. Now it seemed to taunt him.
Chapter Two – Off Call
, he made a hasty exit. He needed someone to talk him off the ledge.
The bartender laughed, and slipped him a coaster across the bar. “Try this. Go home, get yourself comfortable and get ready to feel like you’re flying.”
Later that night, Draco was pacing anxiously, waiting for Pansy to arrive. He didn’t know why he thought this was a good idea. Pansy was a viper, and she and Harry would either get on too well, or not at all. He didn’t know which possibility he was more afraid of.
Harry sighed and smiled down at his gift. He was so pleased with how it had turned out. After one of their winter storms, Harry had gone outside to find the Wiggentree had lost one of its main branches, a nice and straight one that was too slim for carving figures, but he had held on to it anyway, storing it above the rafters to dry out a bit. One evening, he’d looked up to it, worrying over what he could possibly give to Rose for Christmas, and just knew he’d found the perfect solution.
Harry sighed and sat on the stool next to Draco. “Do you need any help with this?” He waved vaguely at a few scattered ingredients on the bench. Draco smiled to himself.
“Draco.” He tried again. “Whatever you want to do you have my support— but, there isn’t a lot of time—”
“Oh.” Harry breathed out the word all in a rush. He realised, for the first time, that this may have been less than a pleasant excursion for Malfoy as well.
?” Draco asked, feeling himself blush.
None of this made sense. He had the hots for Potter, that wasn’t love.
“I use to love roses.” Draco said finally. He didn’t actually mean to say it. It just kind of slipped out.
Flea shoved Harry gently and snorted again. Harry laughed and pushed him back playfully. The great beast unfurled his wings and made as if to nip playfully at Harry’s shoulder, which he dodged easily, still laughing at the beast’s antics.
“What?” He asked, looking dumbfounded.
Harry kissed him, clearly satisfied with himself. “Just thought you should know.”
The thought of being set up with another man was truly laughable when he sat perched, wearing Harry’s Weasley jumper, his flat covered in things to remind him of Harry’s presence. He ought to tell his mother he was otherwise involved before she tried something like this again.
Harry’s hand hung in the air, outstretched. He recognised the owl, he realised. Once he could see it properly, out of the rain and puffing his feathers out in the warmth of the cottage. The little barn owl was Hermione’s. The waterproofing charm, as good as her signature.
He strode down the hall, following the familiar route to Gryffindor tower, burning with a strange new sort of bone deep disappointment, and each step tightening his jaw, his teeth set against the fury building inside him.
The article ended with information for those who were still struggling after the war - signs and symptoms of PTSD, issues of addiction, what constitutes sexual violence, then where to get help, even how to help loved ones, and the like. It was wonderfully done, and brightened Harry’s mood considerably. Dennis was a gem of a man, and how much he cared for others was evident on the page.
“Mr. Potter,” she had said, a confused lilt in her voice, “what a surprise. To what do we owe this pleasure?”
Harry had a look of abject shock on his face. Draco continued, “Ever fantasize about touching a woman or having sex with a woman?” Still using his healer voice, despite the rising tide of flutters in his chest.
Harry opened his eyes and regarded Malfoy, both frustrated that he had to explain something so incredibly intangible and ethereal and that he had only just barely worked out for himself moments ago, and grateful he hadn’t just said no, assuming that he was going there to fuck himself up again.
“Blimey Harry, what have you done with the place?!” He was looking around, his mouth open. Rose was not helping, bouncing in her chair and yelling “potato” over and over again.
Harry sighed deeply, smiling at her. How could he possibly refuse? And it’s what he’d wanted, in any case. A way to give back. To help prevent the spiral before it ever happened.
Harry pushed his shoulders down and walked ahead into the dark where he knew he’d find the staircase, the lights popping in and out of order as he made his way up to the third floor, to Sirius’s old room. He needed the comfort of something familiar. He needed to feel less alone. Somehow, in his addled state, his dead godfather’s bedroom was the answer to how helpless he felt.
“What… the
He tried and tried, repeating it over and over. His panic dragging him further and further under. Each failed attempt fueling the burning fear in him. Harry was surely dying.
Hermione and Ron had invited him over to the house for Sunday dinner with a whole speech planned and everything. They’d nervously fussed and twittered and gone on about the weather and Hermione had eventually come out with it. With the big news. That she was now in her second trimester and she could start telling people and they’d wanted to tell Harry first.
Draco was quiet for a moment. “I actually hadn’t really considered where exactly I would go or be in order to study them. I mean, my application included a petition to the Ministry to conduct my research on the herd in the Forbidden Forest, but I don’t know if it’ll be accepted. And if it is accepted, I don’t know how I’ll situate myself.”
His father had been stoney with distaste when he found out Draco had been fooling around with Theodore Nott and Lucius and Narcissa responded to Draco’s confession by setting up a “premarital matching” with Astoria Greengrass in his 5th year. He shivered at the memory of being in a forced sexual situation with a girl without his consent. Well, he supposed, that was what he got for thinking he could be honest with his parents. They were convinced that he didn’t know what he was talking about and he clearly hadn’t tried hard enough with girls, even though Draco had never once thought a positive or sexual thing about a woman in his life. It usually didn’t matter if a pureblood was gay or what their preferences were, so long as they were capable of producing an heir. After his truly horrifying and embarrassing experience with Astoria, he knew he couldn’t impregnate anyone without the help of a lot of potions and a lot of alcohol. He was as gay as gay can be, and his father resented him for the weakness of not being able to copulate with a woman for the perfunctory purpose of reproducing. He pushed the thought aside, feeling nauseated.
He sighed heavily and raked his fingers through his hair with more force than was necessary. “No, Potter, I’m not mad they match.” He said without looking at him.
Climbing up and down to dash to the tiny loo to sick up every few hours was actual torture, but he’d be damned if his pride would allow him to voice his weakness and ask Malfoy to swop with him.
“How noble of you.” Draco scoffed, turning to ruffle Harry’s hair, which had already been sticking up in all kinds of odd directions thanks to the howling winter wind that had persisted over the forest. Harry’s heart stuttered a moment, filling his chest. How far they had come.
“Mm” huffed Harry in amusement. “It’s galub jamon. And, yes, sinful is how I might describe it.” He teased roguishly, popping one into his own mouth.
non fuissaet pro cremationem…”
“I used to imagine - as it hit me - that it was like falling into honey. I know it sounds bizarre, just, that’s how I used to feel, like it was soft and soothing and healing and it would just soak away the pain, heal everything, all of my scars.” Harry finished, swallowing hard.
“Ok. I believe you.”
Draco looked back at him, trying to figure out how to even start. “So, I take it you don’t know anything about patronuses that change.” Draco tried again.
He sighed, smiling to himself. His magic these days was immense, but not in the terrifying and unpredictable way it had been before - it was calm and placid and gentle, and responded to his needs without him having to do much thinking about it. When he had walked out this morning, the grey sky had cleared and the weak winter sun had shone through to the clearing where he wanted to practice. He had started to notice that he had a bit of an effect on the weather these days, the atmospheric charms he had learned so long ago crackling up from his fingertips without him actively thinking about them, the winter chill constantly buffered by a sense of warm and comfort that surrounded him.
,” She added in tones of hushed horror.
“Knowing you, Potter, you’ll be unteachable. But I can try.”
“I wouldn’t ask you to. Sounds miserable, what you’ve been feeling. You should definitely eat,” Harry said. Poached salmon in white wine sauce over pilaf and roast vegetables in a balsamic glaze followed the soup, and while as he’d predicted, the portion sizes were notably smaller for Harry than they were for Draco, Harry stalwartly refused to swap. “Listen,” He said, gesturing with a Brussels sprout speared on the end of his fork, “You got though all the soup okay, didn’t you? If you start to feel sick, I mean, stop eating. But I promise, I’m fine! I ate loads for breakfast this morning. And being well-fed will probably help you with the Patronus Charm.”
“It might be close enough to fool people who don’t know me, or care to,” Draco said, dragging his fingertips along the rumpled comforter, “It started to cast the killing curse on me. I ran before it finished. If it’s capable of spellcraft… I don’t understand it. Why it’s here. Why it wants to kill me, but seems almost indifferent towards you. The Ministry all but tore up the floorboards, stripping the house of all dark objects and artifacts of esoteric magic, so I don’t think I could have activated a curse in that way.”
“Okay,” Harry agreed, stepping to the left in perfect time, and then following it with a turn—but only a quarter turn.
“Yes,” Draco said, “Doomed.” It was too close to how he had been feeling recently. Like nothing good awaited him in life.
“She’s my mother, Potter,” He said, when Harry did nothing but look at him in confusion, “Not my governess or my nursemaid. She was busy running the household and talking to people. She had more important things to do than run around after me, feeding and washing a baby. Can you imagine?” But clearly Harry could imagine, because something that looked an awful lot like pity was coming over his face. “Don’t look at me like that,” Draco snapped, “It’s the way things work for traditional pureblood families. It’s better for everyone involved.” Potter still looked like someone had dumped a bucket of water over his head. It was a moment before he gathered himself and nodded.
"Through the floorboards. Sort of burst apart when Harry's Patronus charged it, and trickled away like smoke," Weasley said.
“So you’ve noticed my fragile ego,” Draco said in icy tones, “Thank you ever so much for pointing it out.”
“Just fix it and keep going,” Draco said.
Draco had no expectation that the DMLE would respond to his owl. He expected to have to wait a few days to give them a reasonable time to ignore him before marching down to the Ministry to demand to be seen. He might not have been at the height of British Wizarding society anymore, but he was still a taxpayer. But it was less than twelve hours later when Mimsy appeared with a crack in his bedroom, clutching her ears in alarm. Draco stared at her over the top of the
“Leave me.”
After the dance lesson, Ron comes back with the results of his and Hermione's research thus far.
“I’m fine,” Draco said, dropping his hand, “It’s forwards, backwards, forwards, backwards for the first set. Let’s try it again.”
Harry looked flummoxed, “Where then?”
Clutching his belly with one arm, breathless with laugher, Draco managed to wheeze out, “Is that what I looked like, to you?” His stomach muscles were starting to ache, and his eyes were tearing up with the delightful madness of Harry spinning around and around on the spot like a figure in a music box in Draco’s sitting room, trying earnestly to get his approval. He swooned against the chaise lounge, letting his laughter ease gradually. Dabbing at his eyes with his sleeve, he looked across at Harry, who was surveying the room, smiling still but looking nonplussed.
"Stupefy. Stupefy! That's not mine, Harry. Protego!"
Eventually, Harry nudged Draco’s cheek with his shoulder, and gently extricated himself from his arms. Silhouetted by brilliant sunlight, Harry stretched, then turned towards the bathroom. “I’m going to take a shower, if that’s alright,” he said, “Breakfast after?”
“Heavens, no!” Draco spluttered, feeling his ears go pink. Infatuated? Obsessed? Tangled up in lust and jealous passion? Yes. But in love? That was something else entirely.
As quickly as he could be bothered to, Draco showered, shaved, brushed his teeth and hair, and dressed in an expertly tailored white linen shirt, black trousers, and riding boots made of Ukrainian Ironbelly. He considered putting on one of the last items of clothing he’d bothered ordering for himself—a forest green jacket with silver fastenings and velvet side-panels, which was flattering, stylish, and never worn—but he couldn’t be bothered to summon it out of his wardrobe. He went downstairs without it.
"Gone 'for now'? Gone where?" He asked with his best play at haughty cool.
, not his mum.”
“—be so miserable!”
“Yeah. You too,” Harry said as he sat up, eyes glittering, and caught Draco’s mouth in another kiss before yanking his shirt off over his head. Draco shucked off his own shirt, tossing it across the room before dragging Harry back into their breathless embrace.
Draco stopped a few feet away from the bolted sitting room door and gestured towards it. “It’s in there,” He said, keeping his voice level, though the thought of so much as opening the door, even with two Aurors at his back, filled him with dread, “It’s in the piano, actually. If I could trouble you not to damage it—it’s an antique, you see. Priceless.”
“I is not knowing, Master Malfoy,” Mimsy said, patting more Gilfrey’s Gentle Silk-Safe Stain Remover onto the once-bright fabric, “It is not me doing it.”
“Mimsy is polishing the floors three times yesterday,” The elf said twisting the hem of her dishtowel apron, “But it stays.”
“Yes,” He agreed tentatively, “What of it?”
, Draco.” He was going to commit that sound to memory. ‘
“I wasn’t judging. I like pretty things, too,” Harry said, and Draco quirked an eyebrow at him.
“Is that so? I never had you pegged for an esthete, Potter.”
Draco tried again to open his mouth, or to scream, but his lips only parted a fraction, his breath catching in his throat. He was suffocating. He was surely going to die for want of air, if this dark beast didn’t kill him first. As though reading his thoughts, Draco’s mimic drew a wand out of the sleeve of its motheaten robe and brandished it in its hand. White and spidery. So much like the Dark Lord’s hand. “Little weasel,” it said, voice threadbare and dusty, “What are you doing in my bed?” Draco’s lungs forced out a breath of mist. He twitched a finger. He was going to die. He was seconds from death. He had been waiting for eons, but the precipice was terrifying. “Little weasels don’t belong here. There is no room for pests.” The weight on his body was lessening, though it was like being dragged up from an ocean trench. He clenched one fist, and felt a tear spill from the corner of his eye and down his cheek. The doppelganger lowered the wand—Draco’s wand—until it hovered above his nose. “Don’t cry, weasel. It’s pathetic, and it won’t save you.”
. And after dealing with many muggleborn teenage magic folk coming through his department through the years that had participated in muggle recreational drugs, he had become even more fascinated.
“I’m okay. Just working on something new.” Harry said, giving them both a small smile.
Harry sighed and stretched his shoulders down. He was nervous, but Draco was right. He couldn’t hide away. He couldn’t expect Draco to carry everything for the rest of their lives. He had to start making a life that he could live. And this was the first step.
“Yes.” Draco encouraged. “Anything you can tell me would be great.”
He already wished he was back at Tenebris Hollow with Harry. They had had such a beautifully cozy morning together. After waking up next to him, and not panicking, Draco had felt more confident in himself and oddly more comfortable with his attraction to Harry. It didn’t need to be so scary, it didn’t need to feel like an out of control beast. They could coexist with their feelings and be okay.
Harry heart was pounding in his chest, but he wasn’t sure if it was still from the run or being let in so close to Draco, sharing this with him. He had balked all those months ago at the term intimacy when Draco used it to describe them sleeping next to each other, but here, in the clearing, bodies close and Harry’s nose full of the smell of Draco’s dyed yarns and potions brews, of the hints of lavender and mint, he knew exactly what he meant. Intimacy.
He breathed out a sigh of gratitude before he turned and walked back into the cottage. It already seemed cold and derelict with their things packed and Harry gone.
“‘Ello there!” He said loudly, and as Draco crossed the threshold Hagrid wrapped him in a near crushing hug. He found he didn’t mind one bit. Hagrid may be huge and overwhelming, but like Harry said, there wasn’t a more pure soul alive. “How’s the unicorn stalking, ey?” he asked.
“Well versed in thestral potions now, are you?” He teased, his small smirk feeling rusty and out of place.
Harry summoned parchment and a quill to him with a wave of his hand, laughing softly to himself.
“Mm.” Harry said, brow furrowed.
“Well, you should be! This is amazing.” He was floating on his back with his eyes closed.
He had told himself he took the books out to learn more about the dark arts, but what he really wanted was to help Malfoy with his research in some way - he hadn’t let him come with to go sit with the unicorn herds, but Harry had wanted to be useful nonetheless, and they both knew it wouldn’t be with the potions side of things. His work was important. Harry believed it would help many people, and he wanted Malfoy to succeed in it.
Hours later, as the wind picked up and whistled around the frozen fields of the hollow, Harry awoke with a start. The fire had died down, lingering coals glowing red in the bed of ash, the cold seeping into the cracks and corners of the cabin. Harry rubbed the sleep from his swollen eyes, his mind prickling with the sense that something had wrenched him from sleep. Something sinister.
Draco nodded stiffly. A deep sense of disquiet settling in the pit of his stomach.
“Healer Malfoy.” She said professionally, but with warmth and a hint of an ironic smile, as she extended her hand to Draco as if they were meeting for the first time.
Harry and Draco sat far closer than necessary at the head of the table, finding a hundred excuses to touch one another throughout dinner. Harry’s hand rested gently at the small of Draco’s back. His thumb moving methodically on his spine. Draco’s hand on the nape of Harry’s neck, fingering the soft black curls that had escaped his hair tie during the flurry of spellwork and subsequent mobbing. Harry shooting frequent, undisguised, adoring glances at him.
He reached over and took another sticky dough ball and considered what he wanted. “I think it’s too soon to say.” He finally said, hoping not to hurt Harry’s feelings.
He would get spooked and end up running, he knew it already. He had accepted the fact, ever since his fiasco with Charlie, that he would be alone, and the best he was ever going to get were vivid dreams of Harry’s hard body against his.
So, it would have to be Hermione. She would be heartbroken, but, ever the practical witch, she would find a way to carry on, she would know this burden was too much, she would know how long he had carried it. How long he had carried them. He needed rest. And quiet. She would understand.
Draco felt his heart swelling. To hear Harry explain and defend their growth together to someone. It was validating and heartening.
“Who’d’ve thunk— this cabin, way out here— that’s a big table— when do we eat— I could eat a whole cow— where should I set this roast?”
. The home Draco had never had but had always wanted. The place you go to when you are weary and broken and in need of respite. Where you go when you want to share in your joys and victories— full of acceptance and unconditional tenderness. Harry allowed him space to grow and bloom, tended the potential within him like a devout gardener.
“Houselves.” Draco intoned “They don’t fuck about.”
The last of their heaviness evaporated, Harry’s magic reached out in light swirling tendrils once again.
“Swapsies?” He asked, and Draco snorted a wet laugh.
“This is lovely.” He said, and Harry could see he was trying hard to be kind. To be nice without being sweet. Soft, without being open.
Greg was nodding eagerly and looking between Harry and Draco, waiting for their reaction.
“Oh, no—” Harry laughed. “You’re not getting me to ruin your dinner plans for you.” He made a show of straightening Draco’s collar and smoothing the front of his shirt. “You haven’t spent time with Pansy in ages, and you told me— not two days ago— that you wanted her and I to get to know one another— so, this is
The snow crunched beneath him and he slid, catching himself on an old elm, his inadequate shoes slipping on the icy downward slope, where the forest floor dipped towards the valley that held the cave.
“Can I touch you?” Harry asked awkwardly and unsure, sitting down on the ground next to him, his brow creased.
September 24, 2008
“You’ve seen thestrals at St. Mungo’s, have you ever noticed them in specific patient rooms? Have they ever seem to lead you anywhere?”
He finally looked away, not being able to stand the searing heat of Harry’s gaze. “And, I think that’s happened because of the intensity of our circumstance and forced proximity.”
Draco’s breathing began to even out and he buried his face in his hands and berated himself. What the fuck? He had had a genuine moment of vulnerability and connectedness with another human, and instead of easing into it, he fucking ran. Literally. He literally ran away. Into a forest. To avoid being in an intimate situation. How was he ever going to go back to the cottage and face Harry now? That had been so fucking embarrassing. It’s not as if that situation had even been inherently sexual. If he had stayed and not been a complete berk, Harry probably would have woken up, rolled away and not even noticed, and they could have had a perfectly normal morning.
Malfoy looked at him a moment longer, his eyes sleepy but seeming to take in how badly Harry was handling things at the moment.
“You mean to tell that you don’t need to kill them to do this?”
May 16, 2008
Harry’s head popped up from behind an unruly rosemary bush, his disheveled bun threatening to fall down around his shoulders, a fistful of carrots held triumphantly in his fist. “I have dinner! Well, part of dinner?”
Actually, every Friday is Auror Pub Night. Like clockwork, they leave the office and head to the pub, get drunk and celebrate whoever’s locked up someone big and bad recently. Every week, Harry gets the routine shoulder slap and “see you at pub night, Harry!” usually with finger guns from one, two, sometimes three different coworkers. Harry always smiles and laughs, confirming his attendance with a thumbs up, hating the sick ritual and the fact that he’s not even sure of the people’s names who are asking him.
Harry sighed deeply, pulling Draco closer onto his chest. He wanted to feel his weight on him. To feel grounded. He wanted touch, skin on skin, to feel his breaths and his heart and all the things that soothed him when his thoughts started to congeal in the parts of his brain that craved oblivion.
Draco didn’t speak. The veritaserum didn’t pull any words from him.
The sun was rising higher and warming the forest, reaching deep down even to the shady spots beneath the trees, covered in lichen and mosses. Everything was calm and beautiful and still, and he felt decidedly comfortable, comforted, even. Maybe this is what he had been seeking, all those nights desperate for a reprieve from his own life. This was healing too, in a new way, a way that didn’t leave him with the empty sour burning of guilt and the metallic ring of shame - no, this was good.
Draco just gawked at him, “What in Godrick’s name does that even mean?” Draco realised the slip too late, Potter’s use of the Gryffindor founder’s name when he swore having obviously rubbed off on him. Fuck.
Eventually, he slept, body curled into a crescent, hands pulled against his own chest.
He couldn’t do this on his own steam. He needed support to help convince St. Mungo’s and the Ministry that not only was this research important but that he was a person capable of doing it— and that he wasn’t so easily corruptible and tempted by dark magic as they all assumed him to be.
“There’s something else too, something I’ll need your help with tomorrow.” Harry said, his smile now more mischievous.
“Sore.” He muttered softly.
“Sirius, I can’t keep living like this. I don’t know what to do.” Whether or not he said it aloud, he didn’t know.
” She intoned in a sing-song voice.
Several hours had passed. Draco’s butt was numb in his desk chair and he was surrounded by a hurricane of paperwork, but his application was
“I know you’re there.” He said, still looking down into his tea with great contempt.
Standing naked before Draco, skin painted with dark splashes, his hair congealed stiff in places, Harry finally looked up at him. He could feel his heart beating hard, and he knew his skin is radiant with magic, his body full of it, just as vibrant and loud and strong as the Dragon was. He let Draco drink him in a moment. He could see the pink on Draco’s cheeks. He could feel how flustered Harry made him.
“Yes. Luna and I are very close. I spend a lot of time there when she doesn’t have meetings.” Draco said. “The male thestral isn’t always there, but often enough.” Draco knew exactly where this line of dialogue was leading Hermione, even if he didn’t say Harry’s name.
He dropped his quill and closed the file when he realised he was flinging bits of ink all over his desk. Sighing in frustration, he looked down at the worn grain of ancient walnut. He had found the beautiful piece at an estate sale in Kent— he’d nearly fought an old lady for it. Using his wand he cleaned the specks of smudged ink before running his hands over the smooth wood apologetically.
Reading, he felt as though his insides had been replaced with lumps of cold iron, weighing him down. He was sinking.
“Me either.” Harry said, rolling to his side and hanging his head down over the edge of the bed, barely able to make out Draco’s features in the absolute dark of the cabin, lit only by the dying embers of an earlier fire.
After spelling the mess away and giving everyone a proper hello, he was put to work chopping the vegetables so Neville could continue enthusiastically explaining his plans for moving forward with his greenhouse business.
Draco didn’t have time to dick about with ominous door carvings. He said with a loud and thunderous voice, “I am a Black, let me in!”
He felt Hestia’s hand grab for his as he moved from under the wisteria and out into the rain. Her fingers just slid past his, and he didn’t look back, breaking into a run before spiralling into the crushing darkness of apparition.
Draco snorted, feeling loved. Feeling understood. Feeling maybe it was time to stop hiding himself away in a cave in the forest.
“Of course.” The smile Harry gave him was radiant and understanding. It held no malice or bitterness. “Can I touch you?”
“I know Harry, but it’s hard to watch the ones you love die.” Sirius said softly, as if in his ear. Kind and gentle and soft like the honey. Like the honey that felt thick and heavy in his lungs. In all the places it shouldn’t be.
“A mum unicorn ran forward to defend her foal but Gropie accidentally clipped her with his fist and knocked her down. En I was so worried about ‘im hurtin’ the foal that I dove in fron’ o’ ‘im and took the blow to me head instead and managed to knock Gropie out before collapsin’ meself.”
wrote about us?”
Hermione was kneeling on the ground by the sofa, where Ron was seated, just taking off his auror robes.
“What’s wrong you git? You look as though you’ve had such a fright and I know it can’t be this soup I’m making because it smells incredible and if you don’t want any it’s fine I’ll eat it all myself, even though you’ve been gone all day and didn’t even let me know when you’d be back and if you’d be here for dinner.” Draco was grinning slyly, his eyes bright and soft and kind and creased at the corners with his obvious joy that he was indeed home at last and Harry’s mouth was suddenly so very dry with how effortlessly beautiful he was, and how stupid he had been to take so long to notice.
Harry really was charming when he wanted to be, Draco had mused wryly as he watched Harry smoothly weasel his way into his mother’s good graces. Narcissa seemed to warm to Harry quickly enough after the initial shock of his appearance. She asked them all of the awkward questions;
He thought of Harry, and of all the things he wished he could do with him. Of the ways they could explore this newness together. He hadn’t felt desire in weeks, too marred by the guilt of having run again. But, now, basking in his newfound sense of freedom and self discovery, he felt desire wrap around him like the warmth of the impending summer sun. Dancing across his skin like golden rays of brilliant daylight after a storm.
It was only after he had ensured the safety of their hollow. Their forest home. That he opened his eyes. His lips still moved, the spells still flowing from him, but his voice was soft now, soft and gentle. Gentle and safe.
When he pulled back, Harry’s eyes looked glossy and soft, his mouth was red, and he looked properly taken apart. “Now,” he said, reaching down to help Harry put his trousers right and straighten his shirt, “why don’t you tell me why you asked me here to begin with.”
Harry stopped, tilting his head back and looking up at the heavy grey sky.
“Malfoy! Come and see!” He yelled, again. His voice strong and clear in the cold air. He knew the other man had heard him, and the door to the cabin swung open with a muffled swear.
At that, Harry finally looked up, his magic smoothed back down, his shoulders softened. Draco knew that Harry just wanted to be heard, to be understood, to have authority over his own life. He didn’t want to feel guilted into something. Didn’t want to feel ruled by a savior complex he worked so hard to leave behind.
He was washed in warm relief as the wards shimmered and the lock clicked, the door swinging open to him. The thestrals shook their heads, silken manes the last to ripple with the house’s magic before the door swung shut behind him and all went still again. Harry stood, motionless in the familiar entry hall, taking deep breaths, willing himself to remain calm. To not think of the last time. Of the days before they started camping, the days before the heaviness of the horcrux they carried. It had been hard even then, in the terrible old house. It had been filled with uncertainty, of fear.
Another idea caught his attention, and he hastened to mark it down lest it evaporate from his thoughts before he could grasp it. He was so lost in the rhythmic movement of his own hand and the words flying out onto the page, that he didn’t immediately notice Voileami’s sudden departure.
“Yep.”
Harry’s eyes are filled with tears, and the dream swims in and out of focus for a moment, the sound of his breathing and the feeling of a great weight being lifted off his chest distracting him from the forest scene. He can hear a red deer calling in the distance. And a wolf howling. And it’s as if the forest is full of the same joy that is so evident in Sirius.
Draco was sitting in bed reading when Harry opens the door, wide and forceful, a shock of cold nipping at his heels. He didn’t look up, but concentrates, really concentrates on closing the door without slamming it. On hanging the cloak up without shredding the soft fabric in his hands. On unlacing his boots. Undoing his belt. Every movement is slow and deliberate and takes all of his energy. All of his focus. Because it has to. Because if he lets himself drift for even a moment, he thinks of her, laying there in bed. He thinks of the slip of steel still hanging on in her cold, cold skin. If he stops focusing, he’ll think of the peaceful look on her face. And that. That’s what will take him. Grip him, all of him, painful and sure and oh, so convincing.
Draco surpassed a laugh as Greg scuttled quickly away to retrieve the demanded ice cream. “Don’t judge me, I’m in labour.” Luna said with a reproachful smile, sensing everyone’s amusement.
“Not a word.” Draco warned with a raised eyebrow.
article. When he finally regained his composure, he and Harry went over the ceremony for the evening.
His thoughts were circling around the months they had spent in the Forest of Dean, the fear, the panic, the nights he would spend unable to fall asleep at all, heart racing at every small sound the forest produced. He had carried a horcrux and lived on adrenaline and scavenged mushrooms and he had survived amid the terror. He had fought his heart out, he’d rescued his friends from certain death, he had kept it together. He’d even felt strong under the cloak of fear, sure of himself, sure of his mission and his path. Each morning he rose with purpose, he had scrubbed his face clean and gotten dressed knowing exactly what he needed to do. He’d been full of this incredible and unyielding desire to live, to persevere. In the end, he’d done just that. Lived. Won.
“Oh, come now, Harry—” Pansy teased, her smile widening, “I hear you weren’t much better— maybe even worse. At least Draco didn’t follow you all around the school at all hours. Well, sometimes he did—”
“No, really. I hate agapanthus.” He continued, after seeing the apparent look of incredulity on Draco’s face. “My aunt had them in her garden and she fawned over them in the grossest way. I used to poison them when she wasn’t looking.”
Heaving a large sigh, Draco put down the caramel and sat back in his seat. “You aren’t fucked up Greg.” At this, Greg looked up into Draco’s face with imploring eyes. “You have a condition. This is a disease. And the first part of getting your life back together is recognizing it.”
“We can start tonight.” Harry’s smile was genuine and he let his magic pour from him, gentle and warm and knowing, knowing the relief of laying down the things you carry.
Harry lay back on the familiar skin, cushioned perfectly on the plush greenery beneath him, his hands resting comfortably behind his head, legs stretched out and ankles crossed, his bare feet finally accustomed to the rough terrain of the hollow.
Neville shrugged and laughed, “I’m just saying, I hope you get what you need. When do you leave anyway?”
It was the early hours of the morning, still dark outside, but the last of the birds that hadn’t yet migrated had begun to sing their chilly morning song. Draco moved quietly about the cottage, trying not to wake Harry, as he made himself tea and mentally prepared himself to finally stop being a complete twat to him. It wasn’t his fault, and they needed to maintain civility if these last few months weren’t going to be miserable.
“I’m home.” He said simply.
He could hear Harry’s even breathing as he slept on, oblivious to Draco’s dilemma. Thank Salazar's tits for that.
How he craved to be free of all of the pain, the fear, the terror of his future. How he needed to let go of the responsibility, of the pressure. How he begged for escape. All of that juxtaposed against the knowledge that he loved his new life. His sobriety. That happiness was his, was attainable, that drowning all of these things in a bottle of Jameson was cowardice, was easy.
The thought that someone could hurt Draco burned on the tip of his tongue and his skin was peppered with a familiar rush of adrenalin. Harry poured his desire to protect him into the magic that swirled around Tenebris Hollow, a warm breeze from the South sweeping across the clearing, lifting the tendrils of hair that had escaped Harry’s top knot before disappearing down the other side of the valley.
“No. Not without extraordinary effort, and even then, it wouldn’t last.” Harry said, his face hardening.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes, his blonde hair sticking up at all angles, making him look even sharper and pointier than usual. “Of course I’m alright. It was just a dream.” His voice had found the hard edginess it had always had at school. Harry nodded, to himself, more than anything. Malfoy was scared.
Harry’s look of utter confusion lasted only a few seconds more before it was replaced with a look of pure horror. “Oh my fuck.” He said. “The bathroom.” His eyes went impossibly wide.
“I call top bunk.” Harry said, a hint of challenge beneath his exhaustion.
“I changed, Harry. I did the work. I went to therapy. I came to meetings. I still do. I removed myself from a family I could no longer stomach to be associated with. I changed my name from Carrow, and I grew with the pain until there was nothing left to run from. And here I am.” Hestia climbed the steps to Luna’s door, her palm on the wrought iron handle.
“Shall we floo?” Luna asked, wearily. She couldn’t apparate, not now in her third trimester.
He didn’t know how long he’d been sitting there, the sun’s rays spilling over the mountain ridge before him, flooding the cave and ravine with molten sunlight, letting the warm light drench his face, when he heard a familiar hooting, a reproachful call.
It was long past midnight, everyone yawning in turn, the conversation slowing down. Harry leaning in frequently, almost as an excuse to press in closer, to touch his mouth to the shell of Draco’s ear, asking,
Draco just blinked.
He scooted closer and brought Draco’s hand up to his mouth to kiss and spoke into it. “I’ve told you before— you’re more than just an object of my desire. We don’t need to be or do anything differently. What we have is perfect the way it is. I don’t have any expectations of anything more— anything different. I never want you to think you owe me sex or something to keep me around or interested.” He picked up Draco’s mangled sock as if to demonstrate something. “You’re very interesting without it.”
“Try and catch me early this time.” Harry looked out to the South again a moment, the sheer cliff of the ledge dropping over 1000 meters to the next granite outcropping. He took a deep breath, steadying himself, ensuring his boots were firmly planted against solid rock, curling his hands into fists.
“Get the fuck off me.” Draco hissed, and he stomped towards the door. As soon as he cleared the front entrance he sprinted down the street and apparated in the first alley he came too. He could have walked home but he didn’t want that creep following him.
Harry reached in his pocket to feel the familiar Holly of his wand - his thumb tracing a favorite groove. He felt soft pulling and tingling of magic beneath his hand, a feeling that had been steadily growing stronger and more sure since the night he had managed to cast lumos. He hadn’t succeeded in any more spells, but he didn’t feel like rushing the process, either. It would come back. He had to do the work first, though. He was comforted by the fact that all of his anger had been his own, and hadn’t escaped in his magic, hadn’t boiled over into something uncontrollable and flighty, as it had before.
Lifting the two boxes, he said a silent farewell to the loud pipes and rattling windows and walked back downstairs.
“I quit.” He said simply. “I
Without hesitating, he bolted up the steps taking them two at a time, his robes wiping around his legs, his pockets heavy with naloxone dispensers. The smell of dark magic was nearly overwhelming as he scaled the floor landings one after another, feeling shock at how Harry had been living in such a place. The house was derelict and diseased.
“Harry, no one can make you do this. You’re right. It’s not fair. You didn’t ask to be chosen for anything. If you choose not to—”
“Greg?” Draco asked stupidly. “What on earth are you doing here? Is— is there a meeting happening?”
It didn’t last long though, eventually he started feeling the edginess creep forward sooner and sooner in his work day, his magic starting to hum and demand he get back to The Gallows and then promptly to Grimmauld Place. The lack of sleep was starting to catch up to him as well, and he felt himself start to nod off at his desk more and more often.
Draco let out an all mighty sigh of defeat. “Yeah, okay.” He said as he withdrew the letter from his pocket. Sometimes therapy felt like being skinned alive.
It was fucking embarrassing. Draco had taken a pure and chaste moment and turned it into wank fuel like a total creep. It had taken every ounce of self control and self flagellation not to run his fingers through Harry’s hair and pull him into a searing kiss. He was eternally grateful that Harry had pulled away first, as he didn't think he would have had the strength to do it himself.
” with a smile.
It irritated him to no end that Potter had known he was up to something, and it irritated him even more that when he had finally confronted Draco, instead of doing something fucking useful, like Gryffindors are supposed to do, he threw a curse that nearly bled Draco dry.
The smile on Harry’s face dropped and he looked seriously at Draco. “So, you’ve never enjoyed sex with a woman?” he asked gently.
“It was only after he came back to England in your fourth year that I had the second occasion to speak to him. By then, whispers in the darkest forests had come to him, had hunted him. Had called him grim and many other names, and thestral herders had chased him endlessly, working to trap them as their own. By then, Sirius had come to know what he was. Cursed. And bereft for it.” Harry’s magic hummed in the air around them. He sat still save for his twitching foot, a fist jammed under his chin, his eyes hard on Dumbledore, considering.
He pushed through the door, ignoring the thestrals and their impatient pawing, and slammed it behind him, not wanting to think too hard on why things were the way they were. He was just trying to survive. Like the years he spent fighting Voldemort, he was just doing what needed to be done to keep everyone safe, right? He knew this wasn’t good for him, hell, it wasn’t like he’d picked up jogging and eating celery, he wasn’t an idiot. But he’d always been the one to put himself on the line, the one who went headfirst, alone, into anything, because he knew that was how to keep his loved ones safe.
He was sweating. Shivering. His mouth was so very dry.
“And, I’ll need your help…” Harry finished, meeting his gaze, hoping he could trust Malfoy with this.
Harry stopped his languid stretching to look carefully at Draco. “Are you mad our patronuses match?” His voice was even but he sounded… hurt.
“What don’t you want?”
“Patient was sent to spell damage four days ago, and they just realised he has what appears to be a blood curse. They’ve already sent him to room three.”
Ten minutes later, everyone was settled in the sitting room. Well, everyone except for Harry, who had yet to return.
September 16, 2008
Hermione and Ron both eyed him suspiciously. Rose was throwing cheerios on the floor, one by one, still singing the breakfast song.
“In— In my pelvis and my chest, above my heart. My scar hurts a bit too. Tingles.” She said sounding confused.
Harry pulled out a little scrap of parchment and scribbled his first words to the outside world since March.
Ron was promoted to Head Auror not long after Fred, their first son, was born, an October child. The last few years, Ron’s been home every weekend. He no longer goes on raids. He got to be as much of a stay at home dad as he could be, and good thing too because George was born barely ten months after that, ensuring they’d both be in the same year at Hogwarts, when that fateful day came.
“What’s wrong you git? You look as though you’ve had such a fright and I know it can’t be this soup I’m making because it smells incredible and if you don’t want any it’s fine I’ll eat it all myself, even though you’ve been gone all day and didn’t even let me know when you’d be back and if you’d be here for dinner.” Draco was grinning slyly, his eyes bright and soft and kind and creased at the corners with his obvious joy that he was indeed home at last and Harry’s mouth was suddenly so very dry with how effortlessly beautiful he was, and how stupid he had been to take so long to notice.
