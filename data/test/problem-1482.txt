Draco had no doubt there were plenty of grubby hands in the Ministry just itching for a chance at the vaults.
“Granger, honestly. Look at them.” Draco drawled, indicating the clearly guilty look on Finch-Fletchley’s face.
“So, everybody’s here. I’ll just come out and say it – Lucius and Severus have both reported their Marks went active today. We’ve got to figure out why, and if there’s a threat what to do about it.”
magic, they’ve identified, and understand what they’ll do if you put any two of them together.” Potter said.
Minutes later, the family looked on amused as Draco sat up, hair completely touseled, face red, and wearing a sweater whose yellow shade made his skin and hair look sallow and pathetic.
“Huh, so if we use water, that’s helium or two, and oxygen or eight, which puts us in a base-six-plus-two mathematical system. Ugh, that’s going to get real complicated, real fast.”
There was no portrait that jumped out at Draco, nothing that aligned with his own observations of Potter with those around him.
Harry still was looking to the side, over Draco’s shoulder. The beautiful green eyes staring at the wall behind him as if to forget he was there.
His voice was scratchy from disuse. How long had he been here? Weeks? Months? Time didn’t seem to mean much in this cold, empty place.
“Harry. We have to finish the ritual.” He pushed at his husbands shoulder. Harry groaned in protest. “Harry,
“Very well. I will not stand in the way of your attempts to court Mr. Potter. For now. See that you give me no cause to change that.” He said.
“There’d be no limit to what could be done with such knowledge.” Draco finished for her with a smirk. “And since the Muggles have already gone through this breakthrough, I think all we need is someone familiar enough with how
“You know, that may be amenable. You’re nearly as close a friend as Draco, and certainly good looking, good magic levels, rich, pureblooded, and not too closely related.” She mused thoughtfully. “Perhaps we should talk?”
“My Lord. The Blood gift is traditionally a powerful enemy of the family whose son is being courted.”
Draco watched Harry watching him. Watched how the wide green eyes widened from perplexed curiosity to worshipful awe, then started to glimmer with some emotion much stronger than aesthetic appreciation, and finally warmed until they were burning with desire.
“I think Scorpius would need to be at Hogwarts with you, but that may not be such a problem. I believe the Headmaster may finally get his wish this year.” He looked at his husband inquiringly. Draco quirked an amused eyebrow, then nodded.
“I appreciate the consideration.” Thomas said, politely. He reached into his trunk and, yes, there ready to his hand was the promised book.
“Did you get to the Great Library? Now you’re the Lord Malfoy you should have access.” Blaise asked interestedly.
Narcissa’s eyes visibly narrowed when Draco came back down, freshly showered, groomed, changed, and a completely neutral expression on his face.
“I know you could have. You’re extremely clever, you had him wrapped around your finger from the minute he came over here at Sorting. And actually, you still do. So don’t waste it. Let me be the evil Malfoy bastard, I’m good at it. You’ll be able to pull on his Gryffindor sentimentality for something else. And this way, you’ll be doing him a favor by settling for the estate instead of what he thinks is really valuable.” Draco told her.
“I think we can assume whoever instigated Heirloom, Magic, and Blood was quite sophisticated enough to calculate whether they could survive the magical levels of the honeymoon.” Blaise said dryly.
Draco groaned, his tongue was stuck to the roof of his mouth, his body immobilized, and he was tightly bound with magical ropes.
The hexes were lost in a powerful haze of overwhelming magic, Harry’s magic and Draco’s magic combining into an incredibly strong, incredibly sophisticated series of shields around them as they completed the ritual.
“Well even if you take them down quick, then you still have three others who’ll make you pay for that.” Regulus objects.
Pansy let out a gasp, her hands covering her mouth in horror as her eyes grew huge in shocked disbelief.
“You weren’t in the bed.” Harry moved forward, putting a hand each on Regulus’ and James’ shoulders as he drew them towards where his husband held the infant.
“It seems quite unnecessary. I see no reason to make a gift of what is only needed for a few years at most.”
Draco leaned forward, alarmed, hands reaching past dishes of steaming food to touch the Gryffindor on his face. Harry leaned into the contact desperately, tears escaping closed eyes.
The magic swirled around the room, sealing it. They would not be able leave until they had finished what they started.
HARRY JAMES POTTER! HOW DARE YOU KEEP THIS FROM YOUR FAMILY! HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON UNDER OUR NOSES WITHOUT YOU SAYING A WORD TO THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT YOU? I’VE JUST SPOKEN TO REMUS AND HE’S DEVASTATED YOU DIDN’T CONFIDE IN HIM! SHAME ON YOU! YOU KNOW HE SEE’S YOU AS HIS CUB AND THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT HIM?
why we had to wait until now. And if we hadn’t, we’d still be here today to get your fathers’ books.” Harry retorted. The ward was working…sort of. The path wasn’t exactly clear, but the crowd between them and the wandmakers’ shop was less closely packed now.
“Voldemort is gone.” Draco said firmly. “The bindings he has left behind, on the other hand, are still there.”
tell the lies that need to be told, blackmail, betray, mislead, and double-deal. I’ll make sure you live to strike down the Dark Lord like the idiot Gryffindor warrior you are.”
keep your hands off each other long enough to help me keep Ron from killing himself?” Granger cut in, her voice scornful.
“You will place this inside a container, and deliver the container with it till inside to my house elves at Malfoy Manor. They have instructions for its care and protection.”
As was custom, Draco found something wrong about every room he entered, and soon the full contingent of Malfoy houseelves were busy, frantically scrubbing, polishing, sweeping, warming, cooling, painting, remodeling, rearranging, and, of course, simultaneously self-flagulating.
“Of course not! We’re rivals at school!” Draco retorted. “However, he has made what could be considered overtures of alliance. And there is considerable sexual tension as well, which is always helpful in this type of negotiation.”
bottle of shampoo, Draco thought. Well, surely the Muggles didn’t have the catalyst for styling spells integrated…but if things could be combined even a
Potter summoned his wand and conjured a glass of water for him, complete with a crinkly-looking straw which he held tenderly to Draco’s mouth.
And now that he’d been shaken from cloud of emotions that had paralyzed his self-interest, he would see that the marriage proceeded.
Now there were just shrugs of commiseration from the Gryffindors, calm agreement from the Ravenclaws, blushes from the Hufflepuffs, and from the Slytherins…well…it was pretty pathetic to have to be reminded of something as basic and necessary to civilization as personal
Draco guided Harry to sit on the edge and handed him the wand he’d taken earlier. Then he walked a ways away before sitting himself.
“There was a boy there, he did something to me…everyone disappeared…it was empty, for so long.” He explained haltingly.
“In that case, I’ll still want to minimize my audience, in case of slips. The Headmaster, the Head Auror, and another Auror of your choosing. And all under an Oath for secrecy of any details that don’t bear directly on the Azkaban escape.” Draco negotiated.
Potter’s hands moved away from his crotch as certain parts became extremely sensitive, then he sighed as knots of current began to swirl against him like vague caresses.
“This is an anti-magic field generator. One of the things some of the Death Eaters were able to steal from the Department of Mysteries last year.” Lucius informed him. “I’m afraid at the moment we are all temporarily squibs.”
Draco felt the magical energy building up and hoped his mother and Severus were moving quickly out of the room. Only the Lord Malfoy was allowed within the study except during certain rituals.
Now to take a look at the latest addition to the scroll. Not that Potter’s half-blood lineage was any secret.
“Really? How bizarre. I seem to remember some fuss about that from a few muggleborns during my own Hogwarts years, I suppose. You wouldn’t want to approach them yourself, then.”
Beyond the fact that Potter was exhausted, his magical levels about half-drained from feeding his broom through such incredible maneuvers, and he had, indeed, a broken nose, was another much more vital fact.
“Thank you. Now…there is only one other I think I should speak to immediately. Would you mind terribly if I made use of your floo?” Draco asked politely.
Draco allowed his hand to slide a few inches forward, his thumb caressing back and forth on the inside of Harry’s thigh. Harry dropped his fork with a gratifyingly clumsy-sounding clatter. The leg was burning against his hand through the fabric of Potter’s trousers, a burning pleasure that was nearly painful. Draco continued his narrative in a softer voice.
“I am extremely busy, so I will make this brief. Many of the other teachers do not like Slytherins, and will treat you unfairly. I hope your Prefects have explained the reasons for this. I expect you to respond to their foolishness with respect and dignity as befits your status. You may complain to your Prefects, or if you think it is
Then he stood and walked to the bed, looking down at his husband snuggled in blankets and throw pillows.
He smirked at the Dark Lord over his husband’s shoulder as he delivered the true final line of the prophecy into Harry’s ear.
He turned his irritated attention to Fred, who stood slightly in front of George, looking rather disgruntled.
“I’ll make sure the spell is appropriately phrased. I don’t think Potter expects me to take a Killing Curse for him. Perhaps something potions-based.”
“Hmm…Potter-Malfoy, eh? I knew those two had it in for each other from the start. So let’s have a good look at you…you’re certainly quite cunning, but you let your brother redirect your cleverness into pranks I see. Hufflepuff would be better for you than Slytherin, certainly. I see you’re a very curious lad but I can see you don’t care for books or book-learning, you want to experience things directly. Definitely Gryffindor over Ravenclaw. Now I can see you’re mostly a pleasant fellow but you’re more interested in protecting those you already care about than meeting new friends. Hmm, yes you’re loyal but to a select few, and quite fierce about those…with that lust for excitement and adventure, you’d better be a GRYFFINDOR!”
The man froze. Tom could see a tall, handsome man with dark skin standing behind him, his wand held delicately at the back of his neck.
, Potter…the Glumbumble reinforces and thickens the glass of the vial, causing the dragons blood to be more compressed and heat up more, further thickening the glass, and so on, until eventually the entire mixture is solid…and very, very, hot. When it reaches that point, it shatters.”
Draco grabbed the wizard’s scroll and spread it out on the table. Several clips helpfully extended themselves from the tabletop and held the edges in place. Draco just stared.
And Tom Riddle buried his face between his new father’s chests and cried like the little boy he’d never had the chance to be.
“I am a powerful wizard of an ancient pureblood line. I have held in my hands power a witch like her has no conception of, powerful in these New Magicks though she may be.” He reminded himself.
“There was a bit of a fuss about the bloodright spell, I think some Muggle parents were pretty terrified by that bit of magic. Isn’t there something a bit more subtle? There should be some spell that prints a genealogy on parchment or
“Jamie. My name is Draco Malfoy. You should always give your last name when you introduce yourself. It’s very important to wizards where you came from. Do you know where you came from, Jamie?”
“First-years are not allowed their own brooms. You know that.” Draco said tonelessly. It was an old argument.
“Well, right now I’m concerned that the current Lord of Black has none of the family blood in his veins.” Draco told him.
“How foolish, to sneer at claims made by someone who has examined the list of his rival’s magical inheritances, when you have not.” Draco replied calmly.
“That’s not how these things are done-” Draco objected, stopping dead as his stomach let loose with another inhuman-sounding growl.
“After Sorting, the prefects of each House can meet to decide how to balance the current students with the new first years.” Draco slid a meaningful look at the other Slytherin prefects. “You know where to find me. The rest of you, I’ll see in the Head Boy’s room tomorrow afternoon. You’ll get to me with the time, won’t you Michael?” He gave the Head Boy a nod, deciding to treat the older boy as an equal for the time being.
“I’ll take care of you, Harry. I can’t change fate, and I’m no Gryffindor hero, but I’m good at plotting and manipulating and pulling strings, and I’ll do that for you, Harry. You’ll see. All that I do will be for you, so we can be together.”
There was a pregnant pause as the last name sunk in, and then the commotion was exquisite. Half the upper-years were on their feet, craning to get a glimpse of the long-lost Black.
Then Bellatrix was there, with Lucius next to her, and the horrible red streak of Crucio was flying towards them, Potter stepping in front of Draco to take the terrible curse…
And many more enchanted glass shards, which found their marks in the ranks their own spells hadn’t touched yet.
“Oh, nevermind. Let’s try something else instead, since they told us to stick to the periodic table. The theory should still work the same. What about hydrogen, isn’t that supposed to have a liquid form?”
“Well. He may be heir to your dread powers, but I’m sure he has never been taught how to use the Unforgivables. And he’s had his head filled constantly with gaudy red and gold and endless small furry animals by his Gryffindor friends and that old fool these last six years! That he attempted it despite this is evidence of the will and intention to do so, at least.”
“I’m your Head of House. That means I’m sort of here to help you with things you’d normally bring to your parents, if they were here. Since we don’t allow them to live here unless they’re teachers, you get me instead. Now, you older students have been here for a while, and I expect you to do your part to help the younger students, and especially the first years, get used to living and studying in the castle. Especially the prefects, but I mean everybody. Gryffindor is a family, and family sticks together and sticks up for each other. If you see one of your housemates having trouble, of any kind, you step in and try to help. Talk to a Prefect or me if you’re not sure how to do that. Yes?”
Muttering something about skinny, underfed boys always banding together, and something that sounded alarmingly like an arithmancy formula having to do with pregnancy and pelvic girth, Molly summarily ordered him to sit and began a whirlwind of preparations of what Draco was sure would be a monumental breakfast.
“Oh. Hmm, with the changes you made I suppose the standard antidote isn’t wise. Take him to the hospital wing for a charms-based cure.” Snape said absently, then walked off muttering, “Glumbumble and sopohorus. Hmm, I wonder if…”
Draco smirked as his godfather chuckled mockingly. He knew his godfather’s teaching style, but this was a rough Occulmency session even for him. Dumbledore must have ordered the lessons over his objections.
of casting a familiar green-colored curse at…Draco himself. A vicious, rabid-looking version of Draco, face twisted into a rictus of hatred, a similar green glow just growing on the end of his wand.
“I have an idea for this time. But, they are older and bigger, and they have very long, hairy arms. This is going to be a war, and I’m good at making plans but we need my brother Regulus to help make them better. That’s how we work. So, if I save you all tonight, you have to help me get to Regulus after.  He’s with the Gryffindors. Deal?”
Harry gestured at the parchment in his hands. No, it was Muggle paper, but he recognized his father’s handwriting, shaky as it was.
Jonas stood there, his eyes burning with a thirst he most recognized from Draco’s mud-, no, his muggleborn protégé. It had barely even been a few hours, and the young man had crumbled before his own curiosity. Lucius smiled at him, waving him to the seat opposite him.
“My Lord. I bring you my son, who is now Lord of Malfoy, and desires humbly to treat with you on behalf of the family.” Lucius said.
The young man hesitated, his perfect posture flawed by a moment of undecided tension. Then he stepped forward, off the edge of the porch, striding resolute towards where the teenager wrestled with the children and wolf.
“You are far too skinny, Harry James Potter, I can see every detail under your skin!” Molly retorted, and grabbed possibly the most powerful wizard since Merline by the ear, dragging him to the chair next to Draco.
With that the two Malfoys removed themselves from the office, casting several highly specialized and obscure locking charms on the door before leaving the entrance.
“Advoco Phasmatis Malfoy” Draco incanted, pointing his wand at his hand. His skin was sliced in the shape of the Malfoy crest, blood welling up and filling his palm before suddenly evaporating to swirl around them in a great silver cloud. He heard Mr. Weasley echoing his part of the spell and soon the silver cloud was joined by a bright orange one, the easily identifiable color of the Weasley hair. The two clouds circled slowly above their heads, opposite each other.
“I think that’s enough, gentlemen.” Dumbledore agreed. “Are you satisfied that Mr. Malfoy is innocent?”
This was the man he had worshipped as a child. Whose memory he still worshipped, at least the memory of an earlier time. Who had taught him everything, made him into the Lord he was now. And now he sat, repressing shivers, on the wrong side of the desk he had once wielded.
Cloud looked past him to where Thomas had darted in and swooped up the infant Scorpius into his arms, and was now cooing at him with a completely carefree grin on his face.
one. But I still think you’re pulling something, Malfoy. I’ll be watching you!” he threatened, eye spinning crazily.
“Because, my Lord. I see no indication that you intend to spawn another heir, and a heritage as powerful as yours calls for reinvestiture into the other pureblooded lines.”
knew I were considering it, I’d be greatly embarrassed. So I would like your agreement to keep it quite confidential, whether you decide to help me or not.”
“Draco…um…okay. So you got a bit creeped out.” Harry said gently, as if he were part of the psycho-ward at St. Mungos.
And with that, the couple turned their attention to their meals and their new co-workers, who excitedly cooed over Scorpius and asked questions about their curriculum and teaching strategies.
“This is what appears when you ask the Room for somewhere to hide things in. Apparently it’s been a popular request over the years.”
romantic, in a way.” He seemed to be looking at Draco’s throat suddenly, and his face colored and his eyes went a bit glassy. “Though…it will be hard.” The blush deepened. “Um, I mean, difficult. Not to…do….”
Draco swallowed. How did he not think about that! Potter was the more powerful wizard, and his magic less refined. Royal blood, yes, but infused with the relatively untamed magic of his mother just the same. Of
Draco leaned forward and grasped Potter’s hair in his hand, pulling it back from his bloody forehead, squeezing it in his fist and jerking Potter’s face towards him, away from the wands on the grass, face to face, inches apart.
On the left side was a stylized logo of a charging lion, surrounded by small portraits of individuals. The other two members of the Golden Trio, of course. The werewolf. The rest of the Weasley brood. Dumbledore. And an uncountable number of much tinier portraits. No doubt, Potter would jump to save anybody he’d ever met, without thinking first.
He didn’t mind admitting it. Brooding was a very Slytherin trait, going hand-in-hand with such stereotypically Slytherin things as devious schemes for personal gain, diabolical plots of dark revenge, and sudden unexplainable bouts of cruel, evil laughter.
Sighing, Draco picked up the silver knife, wrapping the silk and the ribbon around its handle, and moved forward.
“I will be quite happy to avail myself of appropriate advice. Mind, I intend to spend what you may consider a great deal of time in the Malfoy-Potter staff quarters. I’m afraid your demands on me will have to take third place behind my newfound family and my academic study.”
“Do you take me for a Hufflepuff, father? If there will be a wizard more powerful than Harry, or than our sons, it will be this one. I have given my son a powerful, utterly loyal ally for life. If they are inclined, they may transform the bond into a marriage bond one day and even further enrich our family line.”
Somehow Draco didn’t see Potter reacting positively to the pathetic stratagems illustrated in the trashy literature he’d uncovered so far. Draco was sure these horrid tales had some connection to the, no doubt, nonsensical pre-negotiation courtship rituals that Potter would expect of him.
“Ssssso the father called Draco worked a great magic to take the venom from that head’s fangsssss, and believed that head was destroyed by doing thisssss.” The Dreamer said.
“Well, I asked his friend Granger and she wasn’t extremely forthcoming. She would only tell me to be ‘honest’ with Potter.”
“Yeah, I know I’m a bit young, but I finished my undergrad in Quantum Physics when I was 20 and polished off a Masters in Theoretical Quantum Mathematics two years later! I think the admissions board was a bit skeptical of me, but when I started picking apart the formulae in their prospectus they were intrigued enough to let me in.”
it! And then I wake up, and I’m sick, and I don’t want to tell anyone about the dream because I’m so
“Because it’s the right thing to do, ‘Mione! Hell, if even the ferret can see that you should be able to! She’s his daughter and never knew him, and Harry did even though he’s not really his son. It’s not fair to her, she’s a real Black! How would you like it if you were taken from your parents at birth and someone else replaced you?” Weasley argued.
The other Slytherins (aside from Blaise, who knew who must be the cause of such behavior) were carefully keeping their distance, while watching furtively, and reviewing their own interactions with Draco for the past several weeks, hoping that they were not the targets of the undoubtedly elaborate scheme percolating in their Prince’s mind.
The door to the study slammed shut, and there was an immediate flash of blinding light as a wave of force slammed Draco to his knees.
“But the math, man, unless you’ve got a supercomputer hiding around here that’s really going to suck.”
“Have you a death-wishhh, young Malfoy? Even your generational magic cannot stop a Killing Curse if Potter strikes at you.”
He pulled on Potter’s shoulder, and Potter thankfully took the hint, turning counterclockwise himself to cover the area Draco had turned his back on and Stupifying another enemy as he pivoted and stepped to his left, bringing himself once again back-to-back with Draco.
“No…he was just some boy, he said Scorp chose him to take care of him so he was his adopted brother. He got really mad when we woke him up arguing.”
Dizzy disappeared with a pop, and moments later, two houseelves appeared on their knees, industriously alternating between scrubbing the nearest stone surface and smacking themselves on the head with the scrub brush. Not nearly as impressive a technique as Dizzy’s, Draco noted sourly.
“Draco!” Pansy squealed in delight, in full public empty-headed girlfriend mode. “You came to breakfast! Where have you been all evening?”
serious about this! If even a fraction of what the Prophet prints is the truth, that could leave you magically drained…”
Lucius nodded and produced the canvas bag, the dark stain of blood clearly visible seeping through its bottom.
Smoke from various explosions and spell side-effects hazed the air, and the formerly crisp battle lines had become a series of sudden swirls of anonymous robes with spells flashing towards and away from each, in seemingly every direction.
“That’s a horribly rude thing to say, Regulus! You’re lucky P-Papa didn’t hear you or you’d be writing even
“You should all be very proud of yourselves. You’ve just been sorted into the noblest House of the Hogwarts Four. Slytherin House. It is not an easy house to be a part of. The other houses are afraid of us, because we grow up to become very powerful witches and wizards. The other houses are
“Welcome to all of our new postgraduate students! If you will look around you will see that you are surrounded by the very best and brightest from all around the world… I hope you will all take this opportunity to connect with the future leaders of the global community!”
Draco growled. He knew what the connection was, he’d studied it extensively in Potter’s scroll, and the chances of the Dark Lord seeing into his mind while he was awake were slim. Still, no way to explain that to Potter, was there?
Draco reached his hand into his ancestor’s cloud, pulling forth the identification of the event that started the feud.
Regulus paused, the hand still comfortably in his, and looked to either side of Lysander for another half.
the Dark Lord will make it last for weeks, months.” Draco sneered right back. “Just tell me what I need to know.”
“I’m Eric Macmillan, I have a dorky kid brother named Aaron and my best friend is Derek, but he’s a muggle so he can’t be here. I like to play football and climb trees. And flying sounds fun too.”
“We’ll be working on those. I’ve designed a series of exercises that will enhance your reflexes, my boy. We need you to have a spell ready to your lips whenever a wand is raised against you. And not the same spell every time. And yes, I think it’s time you began learning some custom-modified offensive spells as well.”
“It would be improper for me to tell you how to use it. I’ll say that in the hands of my ancestors, it has been used to devour wards, and on one occasion, to drain the magical energy from an enemy. Quite painful, I understand.”
Draco looked down at the plate. He’d tried to take only one of the gigantic but dangerously delicious flapjacks, but Molly had forced three,
But this…this groaning anguish in the pit of his stomach, that horrible twisting knot of some new and terrible kind of pain – this was what he had been warned about! He had
“Harry…you said once that Hogwarts is like your real home, mate.” Ron reminded him. “Hogwarts is way bigger than Malfoy Manor.”
“I know it’s hard, Reggie. I’m so sorry I had to sit and watch that happen to you and Jamie” he whispered fiercely. “It’ll get better with time, I promise. And you’ll still see him all the time. Think of it as you two splitting up for one of your plans. You both get to learn things and make friends separately, and then the two of you will know twice as much and have twice the crowd between you!”
Not deigning to yell through the house (it was, of course, acceptable for the lady of the house to call out to the Lord, as it indicated their eagerness to see the Lord return to his domain), Draco took the main staircase to the second floor, his footsteps measured, dignified.
“Well, we should first try to understand what happened in terms of events. To Tom, and if there was anything else happening in the world.” Hermione said matter-of-factly. “I’ll reach out to my contacts and pull records for magical anomalies detected in the last few hours. Harry and Draco, you should talk to Tom and try to get a timeline of events from his perspective. He doesn’t have to know if you don’t think he should, but some facts would be much better than speculation at this point.”
“Of course. My guess is that naturally, 19 would have to end up with us, 15 for Ravenclaw, 27 for Gryffindor, and 20 for Hufflepuff. Then there are another 32 who could go either way.” Zabini handed over a binder full of profiles.
The boy frowned, raising his wand again, an invisible force pushing the two back from the cradle a couple steps.
“Dragon blood. Jobberknoll and scarab would normally make you quick witted and smart…dragon blood causes those ingredients to have the opposite effect.
“It’s not the same!” Harry burst out, turning on Draco in fury. “I can’t believe you think I’d actually give up all my memories of the man who was like my father, just like that!”
“Surely the Dark Lord could not have offered a greater reward than the power he offered me as his Right Hand!”
The old woman found another pillar to lean against, so she stood beside the young watcher. The peaceful set of the face, the affectionate roll of the eye at the other boy’s antics. This was no fresh hormone-inspired romance.
Draco silently opened the door, closing it softly behind him as he padded softly over to the side of the bed.
“I guess they’re planning on sneaking in here in the middle of the night or something,” he soothed, “they wouldn’t forget about it if it’s some kind of big tradition.”
Potter paused in the middle of a sentence, mouth…half-chewed contents lodged inside…hanging open for a moment as he pinned Draco with his green-eyed gaze. Then the moment passed and something the Weasel said got his attention again.
“Of course.” Draco said pleasantly. “So. Usually it’s something unimportant. But in this case I also happen to be annoyed with him.”
“I think you boys need to think very carefully about this. We took a big risk telling you where Tommy came from, because you’re his brothers. But do you think most people in the wizarding world are going to bother trying to understand?” Harry said.
Draco was still as a statue except for the clenched fist that slowly moved up and outward to chest-height, the fingers slowly opening to reveal the prize inside.
“I’ve been calling your name for the last five minutes, Malfoy.” Blaise said, eyebrow raised in supplication. That had better be supplication.
“That’s okay Rose. Anyways, in the water he can swim wicked-fast. I’ll show you in the lake when we get to Hogwarts.”
“They go in a potion, and they’ll be used to make vague memories of childhood for her, the childhood she would have had if the man in your memories had been that way towards
Hexes flew at them, hitting Potter in the back, and Draco felt his magic pulled into the Talisman to form a powerful shield.
“Kreacher is a bad house elf. Wrong to question Master Draco, even if Master Draco is foolish to not enjoy the wonderful Dark Magic. No, no, no. Bad Kreacher!”
“You’re welcome. You’re worth it.” He said, and reached around Harry to place the Cloak over him, concealing his body from view. Draco leaned in and placed a chaste kiss on Harry’s mouth before pulling the hood over his head.
She quieted immediately, recognizing the gesture, but her eyes narrowed as she studied Draco carefully.
“They’re both high-energy forceful spells, and Incendio requires your wand to point down after until the flames are gone so they can’t be bounced back at the caster.”
“Because I’m making sure that Harry Potter will win. And you’re getting close to the sorts of secrets people get killed to keep.” Draco added meaningfully.
Granger smiled. A big, horrible, understanding smile. Like Draco was some sort of cute puppy dog that had just bit her hand trying to get at a toy.
“That was…a very, very foolish thing for me to do. God, Potter, if you weren’t so powerful I’d be dead or a squib right now.” Draco gasped.
Tom wordlessly held out his hand, cupped as if to hold water, and made a small cut in the meat of his palm with his wand. A few drops of blood quickly spread out on his palm.
AS WELL AS A FEW PRECIOUS MOMENTS OF YOU GROWING UP, LIKE THAT TIME YOU GOT YOUR FIRST PRACTICE BROOM AND GOT YOURSELF TRAPPED ON THE CEILING AND WE WERE ALL LAUGHING TOO HARD TO GET YOU DOWN WHILE YOU HOWLED DOWN AT US, BLESS YOUR LITTLE HEART!
“She is learning quite well. I expect we can start looking for potential alliances for her rather soon.” He observed.
“I’ll want your promise to actually deliver the items to me if you penetrate security and recover them, also.” Draco added, and when Bill agreed they both submitted to the Oath.
“Ronald! I thought you’d agreed there’d be no more name-calling. He’s gone to great lengths to make peace with your family.”
Draco shut the book and turned in his chair so he could see him. Harry’s face looked troubled, fearful.
“Yes. I actually found it quite fascinating. It sounds like the Muggles have developed some…theoretical approaches that could be fairly useful in potions making.”
Lucius blinked. He would not cry in front of this man. Not yet. That would be foolish, to lean on such kindness so immediately. But, perhaps this time, his instincts would turn out to be correct, and Jonas might prove as worthy of trust as he seemed. This time, he would be careful. This time he would apply the full range of tests his ancestors had taught him, the ways to gauge the honor of foe or friend, not through the magic that had served him so well, but through the careful study of his actions. Oh, how he regretted his failure to apply his father’s lessons back towards him, and those the man bade him give over such trust to!
The opening appeared and Draco ushered Blaise into his room, ignoring his smug look at being trusted with the password.
had died, on the same night as your parents, there would be no more Potter blood. The Potter magic would slowly go insane, isolated in the ruins of Godrics Hollow, and over time grow malignant and bitter, and the area would become a nursing ground for Dementors and other Dark Things. The Black magic, Sirius refused to touch while he was alive, and it’s been doing the same. Tell me, does old Kreacher act a bit
“Severus, you’ll need to compartmentalize when dealing with young Thomas. I know you have had difficulty  with this in the past, do you think it will be a problem now?”
so there will be binding non-disclosure agreements to be signed by those who have not already bound themselves.”
Draco took another cautious look at the portrait. Potter was still all huddled up. He rolled the scroll up, shrank it, and put it safely in an inner pocket before heading off to beg a burn salve from Professor Snape.
“Ohhhhhhhhh…” Harry moaned as he slid smoothly into Draco, and Draco echoed it with a gasp of his own.
Then he moved carefully sideways, stalking the naked boy he knew would be bathing in the middle of the spacious room.
Still. Harry Potter’s equally unprecedented contribution to their bloodline would make up for his father’s horrendous decision on this matter, hopefully.
“What seems to be the problem here?” Snape’s smooth baritone slid into the conversation, causing the three Gryffindors to jump guiltily.
Draco congratulated himself once again for recognizing, in a stroke of brilliance, that the rarely-invoked wizarding traditions of adult courtship wouldn’t be sufficient – Potter would be expecting the Muggle rituals.
Draco waited for his grandfather’s reply, then gave it voice, his own voice coming out sounding stunned.
Jamie jumped slightly and narrowed her eyes at the blonde-haired man regarding them from the other side of the room.
“I suggest you apologize. Your brutish assault has quite offended my son, and you would not want him to take offense and bring suit.” Cloud’s father continued.
A pointing-stab with a slight twist at a mirror and it shattered, followed by another, and another, and another, and another.
“Oooh, but that wouldn’t be nice! Bella and the others are coming through soon! We’ll have such fun! Mmmmm, Draco let me have one nice little bite before you bond…just one, nice, delicious little taste?”
“I guess we have our answer to that question.” Draco said dryly from the doorway. “I’ll have the house elves bring Granger and the others up here.”
“Let’s get you cleaned up. I still have to face the rest of your adopted family. And six meals.” Draco said seriously.
“Potter. Please try to pay attention. Memories of her father, remember? They’re a vital ingredient for the Childhood potion to give her a sense of the wizard. Do try to select the better memories, will you? I don’t think Jamie needs to remember her father’s death for example. You claim to have looked on him as a father, so those are the memories she’ll be needing to establish her sense of belonging in the Black line. Are you even listening Potter?”
Harry’s breath caught, and Draco saw his eyes glisten suddenly with tears as he reached a trembling hand towards the ring.
His blood started dripping…falling sideways irrespective of gravity, each drop landing on Potter’s rune and seeping inside.
Draco could still feel Potter’s magic in his core. That part of him no longer felt like a perfectly chiseled bedrock of ice, but like rich soup of acidic power, with sharp spikes sticking out in precisely geometric patterns.
“This was just before I turned 11, I accidentally – and magically – sent a boa on my cousin when we went to the zoo for his birthday. Hit my head when Uncle Vernon throw me in my cupboard…”
“Draco, is something going on between you and Potter?” Blaise asked as it was Theo’s turn to play in their Exploding Snap game.
Potter shook his head. “I don’t know how… just that… Teddy said it’s an accident… and that… he feels responsible,” he sighed. He was clearly trying his best to stay calm. “Sirius… Sirius said that Teddy was the Black Heir and that… that he could adopt him or something like that if Teddy had nowhere to go…”
Draco had just come down to the pitch. The Gryffindor training session had ended a few minutes before.
Harry tiptoed for long seconds and sighed again. “So! This one,” he said, holding up his fringe and exposing his signature lightning-bolt scar, “I guess you know. Next, he raised his right arm to show him a scar on his elbow. “This one was when I was seven, my cousin, Dudley, was chasing me around with his friends – they called this game ‘
“I get it…” Teddy sighed. “You two are going out and I don’t want to be around when things will get naughty!”
Teddy was busy too… he was working on NEWT level potions with Snape. Those were clearly above Draco’s level and even if he could help with the ingredients, it wasn’t as interesting as really experimenting with the process as Teddy did.
Harry’s face turned bright red and even if Draco was pretty sure the others didn’t know about the true nature of their relationship, Harry was doomed to spit everything if he let him like that.
“I get what you mean… But seriously, if he’s with Snape right now, he’s probably on the best hands he could find in the Castle!”
“Is something wrong?” Theo whispered into Draco’s hear as Pansy was beginning the story of the third week of July. He had always been good at noticing when Draco was feeling uncomfortable.
“I…” Harry started but stopped when he realised that what Draco was saying was the truth. Of course, they talked every day, but they never clearly labelled what they were. “I started going out with you when you kissed me in those changing rooms…”
They set up the mind-healing sessions with Madam Pomfrey on a joint free period. It wasn’t easy at first, but Draco did his best to be there when Harry needed him. He hadn’t expected the mind-healer to ask him if he wanted sessions on his own to talk about what was going on and other matters – like his father, for example.
“And these out to the sides must be special abilities?” Draco mused, concentrating on a drawing of an eye off to the left. Ah. Dumbledore could see invisible things. How typical. And…there…he’s a Legilmens. And an Occlumens.
“Great. The one time I get my fiancé all to myself away from nosy schoolmates and Rita Skeeter, some perverted old house means we can’t do anything here.”
Tom did feel sorry for the boy. Not that he wouldn’t take advantage to collect another vassal for his new family, of course, but it was a harsh fate to be backed into at such a young age. He watched as Heroditus Nott struggled with it, and then the moment when the decision was made.
“If it were the two of us, sure, that’d be no problem.” James said carelessly. “Without him…huh…I don’t know. I’d have to train you, and there’s not much time.”
In another compartment, the following dialogue could be heard, if one happened to be listening from underneath an invisibility cloak. Of course, one would also have seen the facial expressions and physical drama that accompanied it.
Still. Best not to encourage it. His plans would be severely set back if the boy became angry enough to make a public scene. He shrugged Pansy off of him.
“If you boys could hold off your conversation until later, we still have a few things to discuss. Most importantly, whether Tommy should go to Hogwarts.” He cut in.
Draco carefully kept his face pleasant, not letting his eyes narrow. Lucius was clearly testing him, attempting to exert control over the situation.
killing them tended to not only tip people off that such an event was planned, thus ruining the element of surprise, but also had the drawback of making one look foolish if things didn’t go as planned.
…repeatedly…and cooing to each other in low urgent voices about beautiful glistening white swans, and roses, and mysterious gifts from the ancient past, and a secret admirer, and oh, isn’t Harry so
after all), and surreptitiously shooting grooming charms at his husband’s hair when he wasn’t looking (well…
“It was.” Lucius said, grimly. “And, perhaps in time I will tell you more of that. I cannot claim to have been on the right side of things, to my shame. There are things I did-“
“Oh, it’s quite standard Mr. Malfoy-Potter. The results simply aren’t standard. I’m afraid you’re going to give birth twice in a row.”
Professor Snape stopped trying to unlock the door, his face going white, first with shock, then fury.
“You owe them to her, you know. You should never have been Black’s heir. He’d have given everything to her, if he knew. The inheritance, all his attention, everything. He still would…if he were still alive.”
He carefully climbed the steps and found a compartment half-full of Hufflepuffs. A subtle repelling charm and a notice-me-not on the seat insured no students would attempt to take the apparently empty space, and his Invisibility Cloak would prevent their notice of an adult on their train. The Hufflepuffs were far too busy being touchy-feely with their long-missed friends to investigate, anyway.
“I’m sure. But they won’t get advance notice. Powerful bonds should be witnessed by friends and enemies. Not reporters.”
“Occulmency will help, as well. Now, spend a moment clearing your mind, and then look me in the eye. I’ll be trying to jump into your mind the way Professor Snape did…only a bit less forcefully.”
Draco could almost hear the protective thoughts churning through her mind now. To back out of a negotiated marriage at this late stage was controversial at best, and with Draco’s current level of emotional investment, intolerably cruel.
“Maybe…maybe he didn’t have to become Voldemort, then. If Riddle…if Tom had had a family…” he stopped.
Dumbledore looked straight at the two students, then turned his head away deliberately, that annoying all-knowing twinkle in his eye.
“I can’t wait much longer, Potter. I want you. My magic wants yours. And you and your magic want me too. You know it.” He spoke into Potter’s ear, reveling in the way the boy shivered under his breath on his neck.
“Sorry! So why did the Dark Lord want to pick on you if you were just a kid? I thought the only kid he was after was Harry Potter?”
“It’s just a projection of the pure wand that used to exist. The Dark Lord’s wand won’t recognize him because this Tom’s magical signature is still pure, and that wand has grown along with the magical signature of the Dark Lord.”
damage my relationship with my godfather, whom I hope to apprentice to in the near future! Damn you, Potter! I should have known better than to trust a Gryffindor with secrets!” Draco raged, his voice never raising above an angry hiss.
“I guess it’s about time for you to eat, and I’d better get on the train so Tom doesn’t have a panic attack when it leaves.” He mused.
Tossing the box inside, Draco transfigured it into a comfortable pad that covered the stone floor of the small space, then crawled inside.
“You place me in a very difficult situation, Mr. Malfoy. You say you do not need my trust. But you seek to place yourself in a situation that is perilous to the entire world if you are not trustworthy.”
It’s anger purged, the Howler continued on blythly in a more conversational tone, which was nevertheless amplified to epic proportions by the same spell, making Molly Weasley sound like a terrifyingly cordial monster talking to its prey before devouring it alive.
Exactly two minutes later, Bill Weasley entered the room, a lopsided and somewhat confused grin on his face.
Draco scowled at her and made a shooing motion. “I think you’re supposed to get to her before she actually has a chance to make the wrong friends. Now get going.”
“Look. You were the one who got your beaters trying to kill my friends. I was mad, alright? It’s not like I started things, you know.” Potter growled.
Harry stood quietly between Granger and Weasley, not appearing to pay much attention to them as Weasley turned bright red with anger, and Granger gesticulated with authority at the Sceptre that lay on the table before Dumbledor, who simply twinkled knowingly in Harry’s direction.
“Good. I want you to see this perfectly the first time!” Draco said, and pulled Harry forward just a few more steps until they were standing just before the intricately carved crystal.
“That would be shocking upon first acquaintance!” Severus objected. “These children would revere him as a Parselmouth, but they are still Slytherins!”
“Petrificus Totalis!” Draco froze in position and toppled to the side. Potter leaped up, about to tackle him when an Impedimentia curse hit him.
“No. The primary, and the marital specialist will be sufficient. Make sure the wards don’t let any individuals through that aren’t bound to the Family.”
Snape opened the door and turned towards Draco, a displeased look coming across his face as he took in Blaise’s presence behind Draco.
A heavy silence fell across the room, Draco seemed to consider Harry's words, but he didn't speak for several minutes. Harry's anxiety grew with the silence and he wondered if he could go on his own. It couldn't be too hard to run away, just for the night. "I suspect if I don't take you, you'll try to go on your own." Draco said, seemingly reading Harry's thoughts again.
In the early evening Harry crept through the halls to  Draco's room. He unlocked the door with a small key Draco gifted him and quietly padded into the room to peer behind the sheer white curtains around Draco's bed. Draco slept with stony stillness. He hadn't stirred in hours and Harry wondered how he could sleep at all. They'd fed the night before and Harry was energized. He crawled into bed beside Draco and the sleeping vampire draped an arm across him, but he didn't wake. Harry frowned. He wanted to go wander, to run through the forests in the cool night air. But stronger than that desire was the need to remain exactly where he was, tucked under Draco's marble arm. He felt tethered to Draco like an anchor, as if the tie that was formed when he drank from him those weeks ago wasn't severed when he stopped. He yearned for more of Draco's blood. He yearned for more of Draco.
It seemed to take ages before the valet returned with a knock at the door. "Your bath is ready, sir."
Draco’s face shifted and he dropped the human facade he wore. His features turned to angular stone like Harry’s, and his canines elongated to sharp points. He blinked once and when he opened his eyes Harry looked into two soulless pits, black from corner to corner. Harry scrambled backward across the bed and pressed his back into the wall. Draco was incredibly beautiful still, too beautiful perhaps, it was almost alien and it terrified Harry to his core.
“You are to stay in this room. I expect your transition to be complete in a week or two, the bloodlust will start to ease then and I will begin teaching you how to live this life.” Draco stood and strode across the room, he stopped with his hand resting on the door knob and turned to Harry once more before he left.
Draco closed the wounds at the human’s neck and wrist and carried him to a guest room to recover, he'd let Harry overindulge and Oliver could hardly stand himself up. When Draco returned to his chambers Harry was sleeping once again, but Draco was bored and the night was still young, not even midnight, so he shook Harry awake. Harry grumbled, but rolled over to look at Draco hovering over him with his knees on either side of Harry's hips.
Behind him Harry finally stirred and Draco was shocked to find he was relieved, he was growing anxious with just his memories to keep him company. Harry reached across the bed with a sleepy sound and Draco crossed the room to meet him. Harry pressed his face into Draco's chest as he laid down and inhaled his scent.
Potter groaned with pleasure, and Draco felt the pull on his magical core as Potter started drinking in his magic.
But the six items scattered around the Dark Lord only brought a mocking smirk to the lips of the young Lord Malfoy.
“Oh, there are terrors aplenty. Less so, now. Our society is in a state of flourishing after the resolution of a decades-long civil war that got… very dark.”
“Jamie. The Magic gift is given by someone personally known to both the suitor and the one being courted. The last gift is given personally…at the end.”
enough to conduct this courtship properly in muggle terms! I’m seeking your advice as someone close to Potter, Granger.”
and the line of force was suddenly a visible line of silvery-blue energy crackling between his wand and the water, and Potter was dragged to the middle of the bath, frothing water swirling powerfully around him and his green eyes burning furiously into Draco as he
“You’re right. I wonder why nobody ever thought of that.” Draco said slowly. “Merlin…he’s going to be…why has nobody thought of that?”
Regulus blinked, looked at Lysander’s hand still in his. He apparently wasn’t going to get an answer until they separated into boys and girls dorms. He wasn’t sure if he should feel weird about that, but either way, holding Lysanders hand in the Common Room would open up one can of worms or another. He released it, surprised at how reluctant he was to do so.
Harry sighed and motioned to Draco, who told the boy the tale of the man another Tom Riddle had become, the Horcruxes, the night Harry’s parents had died, the destruction of the Horcruxes and their battlefield marriage.
The artifact responsible was quickly placed on another childish head and continued its loathsome task, unaware or uncaring of the repercussions of its cruel decision.
“I don’t think I can be like you. I’ve watched you, you know. As much as you’ve watched me. You play games. With people. Use them, like Ron does chess pieces.”
“He can’t just--” he heard Granger exploding before the compartment door magically swung shut behind him.
“That’s why the Unbreakable Vow.” She said, chagrinned. “I understand, it’d make it pretty obvious who was courting Potter.”
“You were in the bath, and…touching yourself, so I used a spell I know to make the water touch you too. It’s a progressive spell, so I have to keep feeding it. Like Leviosia. But then your magic recognized my magical signature…and, of course our cores are always hungry for each other now. Normally we’re both doing things to each other, and close enough to touch, so we feed off each other at the same time – balancing each other. But this was one-way.”
“Ah, you’ve a strong sense of justice. I wonder if I should put you in Gryffindor this time? How ironic that would be! But no, for you I sense it must be either Ravenclaw or Slytherin.”
Severus let out the breath he’d been holding and withdrew his hand from the phone, observing it as it hovered before him.
It wasn’t so bad, actually, having the most powerful wizard of an age completely besotted with you. Draco thought. Even if it was just because of a weird incest fetish.
“I…I was supposed to, before I…well…before it was all erased. I’d just gotten onto Platform Nine and Three Quarters when everything went wonky!”
“Muggle chocolate, you mean. And yes. Here, I’ll show you.” Draco drew out the small box and handed it to her, watching as she opened it and gasped as the chocolate frog tried to escape.
“I’m fine Ron.” Harry said, the moment broken, and he reverently placed the plant on the ground as he reached for the remaining contents of the package.
Draco nodded in acknowledgment of this fact, then looked at Hermione expectantly. She did not disappoint.
Jonas lifted his hand away, watching Lucius carefully as he struggled to maintain the face appropriate to a mere acquintance.
Weasley lunged and snatched the note out of Granger’s hand, his mouth opening and closing in shock as he read the fancy script.
BUT FIRST! I'll confess I have a very undisciplined approach to how I write. I don't actually plan everything out in great detail from the beginning. I haven't chosen which of the various potential Dark Lords should turn out to be the cause of Lucius/Severus' Mark's activating. I've set up several, and my way of writing is to leave myself agnostic and write things that could support many conclusions. Your input would be very welcome, so if you choose to comment, please mention how you feel about any of these:
“Sorry. Malfoy.” Blaise corrected himself. “Professor Snape was in here looking for you earlier. He didn’t look happy.”
a boy whose safety I take as a very personal responsibility. I’m aware of your past with Mr. Potter, which may lead you to discount much of the fanfare that surrounds him, but there remains the fact that he is very important in the scheme of things.”
One more hallway and they stopped in an alcove with a nice view of the door to the Potions laboratory.
Why had the Hat separated them? That was surely an awful thing to do to both of them, he thought. Would someone try to separate him from Scorpius one day?
“I…Draco, she wouldn’t tell! Not even Ron. I tell her everything, and she would have figured it out when she heard about the explosion anyways. She’s not stupid, you know.” Potter hissed, trying to pull his arm away.
“Mrs. Weasley…as much as I appreciate the offer, I don’t think it would be appropriate to dine with your family before Lord Weasley have completed negotiating a reconciliation.” Draco tried.
The second troubling thing was that, viewing the Pensieve, Draco had a feeling he was looking at a slightly
“Additionally, I expect unity outside of these rooms. In the common areas of the castle, especially the Great Hall or the classrooms, there will be absolutely no bickering or dissent among you. You will hold your tongues and then settle your disputes
“You aren’t seeing everything. You see the wand above the water, and you see its reflection in the water. You don’t see the wand in the water, nor
“Luuciusss. I hope you have a very good excusse for entering unannounced and unssssummoned.” Voldemort hissed at them from the throne set on the dais between two staircases. Draco stiffened in outrage as he noticed that the family coat of arms had been covered up by a banner depicting the Dark Mark, behind him.
Harry smiled at him, an expression that lit up his face and made Draco feel suddenly lightheaded for a minute until his face seemed to sort of crumple.
“Of course. Memories of her father, remember?” Draco raised an eyebrow at him. “And of course, as her nearest relative I’ll be financing her end of the bargain.”
“Mr. Weasley is currently working. If you would like to wait he will be finished for the day in just under four hours.” The new goblin said.
“I still remember all the chatter about the ‘pretty green-eyed boy’ at Madame Malkins. Once we realized who you had met your father was of a mind to forbid you from associating with him…of course I changed his mind, I doubt that’s a battle he would have won at that age.”
Tom shuddered under the kind hand and the even kinder words. A strange pricking sensation was behind his eyes and he found that Harry and Draco, behind him, had suddenly gone blurry.
Ron started sputtering with outrage at that news, and Granger was physically restraining his wand arm now.
Interestingly, another kind of line to one Petter Pettigrew, indicating Potter was owed a Life Debt.
And finally…Draco gingerly removed from an insignificant-looking chest a plain brown canvas bag, a relic Draco had had tailored according to the oldest traditions he could find. It was traditionally used to present the head of the enemy being given as a Blood gift.
He waited, an eyebrow raised. His father nodded his apology and Draco formed the Intent that would cause the phone to connect to Granger’s personal line.
The entire common room shuddered at the idea of actually marrying a Mudblood. Consummation with their raw, uncultivated young magic was rumored to be an experience that was both extreme and scarring…wizards who’d secretly mated with Mudblood witches were often unable to enjoy relations with their proper wives from then on.
Draco focused on one of the glowing circles around Dumbledore. A talisman, a small pin worn over the heart. It had the effect of deflecting any heart-stopping curse. Draco looked at another one. A glamour, over his eyes apparently, to make them twinkle good-naturedly at all times.
“I don’t think that will be necessary. The Dark Lord’s wand will simply have to be purged of it’s history before we can reunite it with it’s replica.”
they didn’t mind – the poor buggers actually tended to depression if they ever got bored), “leading on” unsuspecting women (so he liked to flirt, big deal, it’s not like he was flirting with
If Harry continued his current pattern, he’d be facing the Dark Lord much sooner than that. And the Dark Lord certainly would want him disposed of before he came into his powers, even if he didn’t realize the boy was his magical heir.
Draco snapped his finger, and the plates and food vanished. He reached across for Harry’s hand, taking it in both of his own.
“Good morning Fishburne. I am Lucius Malfoy.” Lucius shook it firmly, giving the young man a measured smile.
“Regulus, James, I know we told you you’d be getting a new brother.” Draco told them carefully. “Well, it seems your Daddy’s magic had a surprise for us.”
Evan’s magic would be in Harry, tamed by that of his Gryffindor father…and hopefully more so by Slytherin through the Dark Lord. But it would still be an extremely powerful wash of magic pouring through Draco…no doubt he would be scarred the way the average pureblooded wizard would be scarred by mating directly with a Mudblood.
“Look. I’ll think about what you said. I don’t think I’m going to end up marrying Jamie. But if it’s that important, I know Muggles have ways of making a baby without having…uh…well you know. Without marrying and…stuff.” Harry blushed again.
“Regulus, James, I’d like to introduce you to your brother Scorpius Hyperion Potter-Malfoy.” Mysterious stranger forgotten, the two boys peered down at the infant, which regarded them with little interest.
The twins just smirked and nodded, delighted at the surprise effect as everyone gabbed excitedly at each other about their parents.
“Nice catch, Potter.” He said, grudgingly. It had been a nice catch. The idiot had jumped off his broom mid-dive, right before hitting the ground, to snag the thing.
. There are a lot of wands out there, especially going back into the past. We’ll find out what this is, and we’ll deal with it if it’s a threat, okay?”
“Magic! You have none of the Black blood, so you have none of the Black magical traits! You are a Lord Black and you can’t handle the ancestral magics
when they separated us. Like, hexes all around, and when they wrestled us down, we were biting and spitting and screaming. They kept us quarantined from each other for days, dude. Days. Opposite sides of the castle, said we were ‘co-dependent’ and needed time to ourselves.”
Draco had timed his speech perfectly. As if on cue, the Head of House glided through the door, robes billowing awesomely behind him.
“Zabini.” Draco said his friend’s name, casually. Blaise turned to him and raised an eyebrow. Draco raised his chin and allowed the corner of his lips to tip up slightly. Blaise nodded in understanding and followed Draco and Professor Snape to his office.
Potter cast a Notice-Me-Not charm on the alcove while Draco searched his own pockets and came up with a few pieces of string.
“Potter accepted an agreement by waving his hand. I don’t think he even intended to do it. He was angry when he realized what Placitum Perago meant.”
“Yes. I’ve already approached Miss Granger about a research position after she graduates. His Blood-gift will please Dumbledore. And I’m considering the Crystal Sceptre as a suitable Heirloom.”
“Well. I suppose we’ll find out for sure when we have them over for dinner next. In the meantime, I’m not going to hold back just because those cretins might be watching.”
In seconds, Tom was staring into hypnotic green eyes as he fed his little brother for the first time.
Slytherin. And the Dark Lord, of course, though fortunately he isn’t diluted by the empty blood of the Dark Lord’s
Raised by Muggles, Draco reminded himself. Immensely powerful wizard, but raised by stupid Muggles. Of course he knows nothing of any of this.
“You’ll find that privacy spell you need in chapter three. Mind the twist at the start, if that’s not spot-on the whole thing will unravel at the precise moment when you need it most!”
“Whatever, Potter.” Draco said, and was suddenly looking at the back of Potter’s neck. Potter’s fingers tightened slightly on his wrist, pulling him closer until he was very nearly flush with Potter’s back.
“Well…he has to, right? He’s eleven.” James said slowly, as if stating a painfully obvious fact to a moron.
A statuesque woman with curly brown hair was projecting her voice with some presumably Muggle version of an amplification charm.
“He won’t refuse. The ritual I have chosen will give him a choice of accepting or destroying the one he most desires.”
“I…feel most confident leaving this in the hands I’ve laid it in. If they consult you or wish to examine it, that is their prerogative. But for me…no, I have well learned that I am not equipped to involve myself with such matters. I will do as they suggest, nothing more.”
This was a maneuver he’d only ever seen his father and mother accomplish, and he’d been wanting to dance this way with Potter since he’d first tasted his magic that first day under the Invisibility Cloak.
“I’m sure Dumbledore has. And probably the Dark Lord. Probably why he’s been so anxious to kill him every year since he came back to the wizarding world.” Blaise said thoughtfully.
Lupin closed the book he’d been reading and rose gracefully to his feet, crossing one arm across his stomach and propping the other elbow on his fist, his hand coming up to stroke his chin in a thoughtful gesture.
Rose petals were strewn artistically all along the table, and a single long-stemmed rose with its thorns intact lay long-wise in the very center.
“Pansy, go find the American witch and introduce her to some of our girls her age. Do try to be discreet with the portfolio this time, will you?” Draco spelled the American’s background check to separate from the binder and handed it to Pansy.
A slashing motion with his wand sent a jagged streak of white light at the fine couch, its imported elven fabric ripping apart in several places as its entire frame was subjected to massive torquing pressures in opposite directions. The splinters flew as the wooden frame gave way under the force, buckling into a pathetic heap on the floor.
“Your grandfather, Abraxas, used the very same to suck the life and magic from a captured Light Wizard, this heirloom is known to me! And you have gifted this Dark artifact to Potter?”
Harry’s eyes were glued to Draco, looking at his face in the candlelight, his shining blond hair, the trickles of water sliding down his toned chest, highlighting the glimmering pale skin in the multi-hued glow of the candles as it was slowly revealed, inch by inch, sliding out of the water until Draco was standing fully, the water covering him just below his belly button. Just barely high enough to conceal his raging erection.
Narcissa took in a shocked breath as she recognized by the grey diamond that it was a derivative Malfoy signet, granting the wearer partial privileges as betrothed.
Draco had been brooding, hardcore, ever since viewing the troubling (and rather arousing) Pensieve memory that morning.
Draco watched with dread as an entirely too realistic bolt of green light trickled back along the line and created a lightening-shaped symbol next to the portrait. The portrait shuddered and cringed away from that side of the scroll, holding a hand over his scar…blood leaking out between his fingers?
Was that it? Draco was just someone who could make Potter react, without fail? The person who could ‘get to him?’
Draco sucked in his breath and edged closer to the reclining boy, his nostrils full of the wild scents of the soapy potions that enhanced Potter’s natural pheremones. This was getting out of control. Potter was on the other side of the room and Draco was a panting mess.
“I’ve watched Harry Potter for six years. It is Dumbledore that has propped him up as a symbol. Against his wishes, my Lord. Harry Potter wants nothing of his status or his fame.”
“Perhaps we should talk to Tom about what was happening just then? What if one of the Death Eater’s children tried to pledge their loyalty to him?”
Draco let out a growl and tossed the useless book into the fire, where it quickly joined the pile of Harlequin novels in the process of becoming ashes.
“Zabini. I should hex you for sneaking up on me.” Draco said, his voice completely unshaken, icy, even.
The other students blanched as James brandished the hissing snake, then again as he slipped into Parseltongue for the last comment.
“Shut up, Eric! I’m telling it!” James shushed the other boy, his eyes widening as he turned back to Frankie, who was still staring at him, aghast at the picture being painted.
“How to Win Your Mate All Over Again”…was clearly not relevant, as he and Potter were both quite human
“Yeah, you’re right. But this isn’t a formal inheritance. It’s only supposed to be seen and used or even known of by Marauders. So if you want to see it, you have to become a Marauder, Jamie. And…you can’t tell anyone about it. That means Malfoy.” Potter said to her.
“Well…they’re still ninjas. And with their longer, hairier arms, we’ll be at a disadvantage.” He explained logically. “I expect that, no matter what we do, we’re all going to die a very slow and painful death. BUT the key is to go down in Hufflepuff Dorm history having taken at least one of them down with us! Now, who’s with me?!” He cried.
By the time the Dumbledore was saying his nonsense words, Slytherin had picked up an unprecedented 34 first-years.
“You older students, I know there is usually some horseplay involved with a bunch of kids of different ages thrown together into a close situation like this. I will let some degree of playful teasing pass. But, and you had better hear me, as the older student,
“So, Harry. What would you tell me if I asked you what the nature and purpose of the Marauder’s Map is?”
“Is that what you were? A recruit that didn’t know what you were getting into? Didn’t think it through? So then when you found out you ran to the old fool? Is that it?” Draco pressed.
“To be sure, it isn’t for the faint of heart. It certainly isn’t my preferred mode of transport! My son, on the other hand… well, we can’t all be athletes, but a Quidditch player at the grade school level will zip around at speeds upward of a hundred miles an hour.”
we’re connected? I see into his head sometimes, by accident, I don’t know if he sees into mine. But I won’t take the risk of him seeing…
“I think what Harry’s trying to say is, he never knew Sirius had a daughter, and now that he does he’d like to get to know her. Isn’t that right Harry?” Granger put in helpfully.
“There is a lot that has been concealed from your scientific community. Granger and my son think it’s time to reveal ourselves, and apparently they’ve managed to persuade the right people.”
“You mean…I mean, no. I just…I never knew…if I had I would have…where did…” Potter babbled helplessly.
would most certainly not be carrying it.” Draco sniffed. “Not that that’s likely to happen anyways. Considering…well…
Then there was a blue flash as the trap on the doorway activated, and Harry Potter disappeared in the blink of an eye.
“It will constrain you to ask questions only according to a certain form. This allows us to demand honesty from each other, but in a way that guarantees the protection of secrets that can only be divulged once married, or only to blood.”
Draco turned and nodded to the American witch, whom Pansy had successfully pulled into their ranks. Then he looked at both of the pureblood exiles, reserving a moment of eye contact for Jamie especially.
The Dark Mark had it’s own line stretching upwards, up through the Gaunts and into the Slytherins, up to Salazar himself. And a host of silver trickles cascading down to the Dark Lord and then to Potter. More symbols, in silver. Parseltongue, Legilmency, Possession, and a
“I believe that would be twenty points from Gryffindor for having the audacity to disparage familial ties while talking to an orphan child about her parents. Ten points from Gryffindor for trying to pick a fight with a first year, you should be ashamed of yourselves. And five points for being out of your seats in the middle of the feast. Please excuse yourselves.”
“Oh, ok, good then. Only…are you sure this is safe to drink for now?” Potter asked, his eyes already lighting up with the idea of setting off an explosion in his most hated professor’s potions cupboard.
The two wizards turned to Tom. The boy held Scorpius protectively, a wand held in a shaking fist, as if to ward them off.
Harry frowned in worry as James was sorted into Hufflepuff. Neither twin looked happy at being separated, and no surprise. The two hadn’t been separated since their birth, the only time he could think of that they’d been separated even for a moment was when Regulus had been presented to the Black family magic as the new heir.
“Who batters the walls of his crypt in an effort to escape and purge his line. Potter is a descendant of Gryffindor, and pure.”
Draco felt the discomfort of a paintful throb in his already-hard member as Potter let out a long, low sigh, stretching out his long body underneath the suds as he leaned back against the edge of the bath, his back to Draco.
His normally messy hair was matted, he was sporting what looked like a fresh black eye and his face and neck showed traces of older bruises as well. His eyes looked sunken and hollow. His too-large clothes hung on a scarecrow frame and the collar of his shirt was ripped.
“Oh!” Granger was turning as red as her Weasel boyfriend now. “Well, I mean, I don’t see how…surely they wouldn’t misuse the Prefects Bath for…that…?”
“Now wait a minute, if you’ve got some kind of gadget watching us in here there’s no way I’m staying here!” Harry growled.
From behind a tattered tapestry he withdrew the silk sheath that had held the Crystal Sceptre for generations, before he had given it to Potter.
social graces? He was a Lord, twice over, and one of those of the Ancient and Noble House for Merlin’s sake! It was painful to watch!
, Potter. The ones you hold in your memories. She has a higher claim to them than you. Any pureblood would agree, including the ones on the Wizengamot. Just ask your friend Weasley. You have to give up the memories, give her her legacy as a Black.”
No. He would be the Lord Draco Malfoy, with all the icy power and carefully measured familial love that that exalted title expected. And his father would know that he had at least succeeded in one of his life’s works.
That done, Scrimgeour discreetly exited the office, along with most of the Aurors, and Moody shuffled forward to carefully place three drops of Veritaserum on Draco’s tongue and watch him swallow it.
“In any case, I really don’t think it’s relevant. We need to start negotiating a marriage contract now. For heaven’s sake Potter, you’re nearly an adult, this needs to be settled before you start getting
an ally completely was presumptuous and rude, not to mention foolish. Trust was reserved for close family. But
And in Cloud Zabini, a different kind of loyalty. A true friend, perhaps.  He had read about such wonders before, could it be too much to hope that after years alone, he could now have parents, a baby brother, and even a true friend?
“His eyes are already as green as Harry’s.” Hermione said, surprised. “It took even Regulus a couple days to show silver. You must be very proud.”
“Finite. Now Mr. Malfoy, I’m sure you know that resorting to physical violence is not an appropriate way for a Lord of Malfoy to behave. Particularly in public. Would you care to explain yourself?”
“I do have one other matter that I could use your considerable contacts on, however.” Draco said carefully. “Which is somewhat outside your role as barristers. I would prefer this be done by those who are bound to me. It would enable you to consider a shadow of this development outside your duties here.”
With a small smirk Draco met Harry's eyes once more before he opened the doors. Harry gasped. Behind them was a grand ballroom, massive and round, with windows that stretched ceiling to parquet floor. Atop the gleaming golden starburst laid in the flooring was a party, the most extravagant party Harry had ever seen. Vampires filled the room, dancing and laughing, their clear voices carrying across the room like a symphony. Harry was frozen in the doorway, there were dozens of party goers and he was suddenly overwhelmed by the crowd of living statues. Draco's grip on Harry's hand tightened and he led him into the room. Harry followed with measured footsteps, eyes flitting from face to perfect face. Some of the vampires wore their human masks, but many boasted black eyes and crystal-cut faces. Every one of them was dressed in luxurious fabrics and glittering jewels; Harry noticed that their styles ranged from new to old, but all of them looked flawless, even in fashion dated a century.
"Draco! You came!" The woman crossed the room in a flash and pulled Draco into a familiar hug. "It's been too long, dear friend."
He approached the two, nestled together in the corner, and with measured caution placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder. Harry looked up at him, his black eyes were blissful. Draco pressed a hand against Harry’s face, and murmured to him, “who knew you could be so impressive?” Harry’s cheeks flushed pink with Lavender’s blood and he stood to meet Draco’s gaze.
His thoughts turned to the tub, his conversation with Harry, the power of a vampire's blood. He remembered the twins in India, Padma and Parvati, they were such a strange pair. In all the time Draco spent with them he never heard a word uttered between the two, yet when they spoke to him they did so in unison, their voices like a haunting chorus. They'd been sharing each other's blood for longer than Draco had been alive. He'd heard a bond like theirs could never be broken, that not even death could sever a tie that made two souls one. Their story had a tragic end though, one he'd left out when he shared it with Harry. Padma was killed by a hunter and Parvati went insane when her soul was ripped in two. After her sister's death she walked straight into the ocean, no one ever saw her again. Draco thought she was probably still there somewhere, sitting on the floor of the sea petrified by hunger, barnacles growing on her stone skin. All the while aching in eternity for the other half of her soul.
Harry glanced back at Draco with worry in his dark eyes, he'd always been a terrible dancer, and now Pansy had him set on edge. He was sure he'd embarrass himself, and he really didn't want to embarrass Draco. Draco felt Harry's worry and wrapped an arm around his waist, pressing him into his side.
Draco's eyes pored into Harry's as he watched him drink from his wrist. He nuzzled his face into Harry's neck and inhaled the scent at the crook of his shoulder, then he sank his sharp teeth into the spot where Harry's pulse fluttered. Harry whined with pleasure. Every sensation was heightened, each touch and scent and sound washed over Harry like waves. Draco's blood satisfied a craving he didn't know existed until he tasted it. He knew he would never get enough. He drank from Draco greedily, like he did when he was newly turned, without any inhibition. His hips ground against Draco's and Draco leaned back, laying the two of them on the bed.
The two rode their horses swiftly in the autumn chill and Draco led them far into the country, he stopped abruptly and jumped from his horse. The moonlight seemed to glow on the horse's pristine white coat. Draco tied the two horses and took Harry by his hand. There was a spot deep in the forest here that he'd been wanting to show him.
Silently the two approached the house in the darkness, Draco gestured to a tree that grew beside the house, nearly as tall as the tower of additions to the cottage that had been built over generations. They climbed the tree with grace and ease, and sat perfectly still, hidden in the thick leaves. Harry could see right into the windows of his house, there were lit candles in nearly every room, and a fire was burning in the fireplace. He breathed in the scent of smoke billowing from the stone chimney.
Harry released his grasp and knelt to lick the wound at Draco's groin closed, he was sure the vampire would be displeased if the bite was left to heal on its own and mark his skin. Draco held up his hand. "No, leave it."
Draco passed him the cup of hawthorn berry tea, the new one took it from his hands and sniffed it, then wrinkled his nose. “Drink,” Draco urged him.
Draco approached Harry slowly, drinking in every inch of him. With outstretched arms he cupped Harry’s face and looked into his black eyes. “Your transition is finished, Harry. You are truly a vampire now.”
"Those humans at Pansy's party were under her influence Harry, they won't remember it to tell. As for myself, well, I can be sure my staff will never share the truth." Draco sat in the new armchair that was now in the corner of the room and crossed his legs. "To put it simply, I pay them very well, and some of these families have worked with me for generations. My staff wants for nothing. They get the best housing, clothing, food and schooling for their children that money can buy. In return I get their discretion and I have never been betrayed. Those from your past life cannot be bought, they will never accept what you are now."
Harry wrinkled his nose. "He's scared. I can smell it." Draco grinned, his new one was such a quick learner.
Draco would be the last to deny he was materialistic, and for a moment he relished in the awe on Harry’s face. “It’s not much considering it took me four hundred years to collect,” Draco chuckled with faux humility.
Harry head was floating and he looked down at the bleeding marks on his chest. "They aren't healing." He said, puzzled.
A possessive knot formed in Draco's chest as he took in Harry's perfect body, weightlessly moving in the water. He swam closer to the vampire and tangled his limbs in Harry's, locking their lips together as they floated in the depths of that icy, crystal pool. He felt the tie between them tighten and his mouth watered when he thought of Harry's blood. He couldn't help it this time when his eyes turned black. He knew he was doomed by Harry, that he could not deny him. He would find himself one day with their souls ensnared together. He feared it and yearned for it all the same.
Draco bristled at Pansy's change in demeanor. "This is Harry, he is a very close companion of mine. I ask that you play nice."
Draco scooped the new one back into his arms and dipped him gently into the tub. Dirt and blood swirled in the water, turning it a muddy pink. He started with the new one’s face, he had to see it. With a wet cloth he wiped away at the grime. The new one was statuesque, his features looked as if they’d been carved from marble. Draco rubbed his thumb across the stone skin of the new one’s cheek, it was almost rosy, flush with the blood he’d been gorging on. He dipped the vampire’s head back and soaked his hair, working his fingers meticulously through the blood matted curls. Draco scrubbed every inch of the new one clean, taking care not to jostle the stake still lodged in his heart.
Shallow pants left Harry's lungs as Draco worked his member, his jaws still locked tight around Harry's neck. Harry felt himself fall over the cliff before he realized it was even there, and his climax hit him like he was crashing into stone. His muscles coiled and he spilled over Draco's hand. Draco made an approving sound. He seemed to be as lost in Harry's blood as Harry was in his touch.
Draco ran at full speed toward the city, the scent of the new one so fresh he could practically mirror its footsteps. As he entered London he honed in on the sounds that surrounded him. Human cities were so loud, always bustling with activity and filled with chatter. He filtered through the mindless droning of the human’s voices and the slow thudding of their hearts. Screaming pierced through the monotonous symphony and Draco turned on his heel in an instant, heading straight for the sound. He found himself in a seedy part of the city, at least senseless violence wasn’t a change to the status quo here, he thought darkly. His steps faltered when he came across a body lying in the street, the mans throat had been ripped out, blood filled the cracks in the cobblestone beneath him. The new one was nowhere in sight though, this one was fast. Draco growled as he resumed his hunt, it was easy now, the new one’s scent was strong and it was leaving behind bigger crumbs. After a few minutes Draco knew he had found what he was looking for. He stood outside a small tavern that reeked of the unmistakable smell of blood. Even after centuries the smell still made his mouth water and he soaked it in.
I was new once too, I know your focus is singular right now and I know the thought of all those slowly beating hearts is making you wild. You are not an animal,
“You don’t have to be afraid, Harry. It’s really quite wonderful, being a vampire.” Draco said. “Everything is heightened. Everything is better. Our senses are perfect, our bodies are strong and fast and protected from disease. Your life can be one of eternal pleasure if that is what you wish. That feeling you get, the thrill when you drink the blood, that can be how you feel always. I can show you.”
The room was still and quiet for a moment and Harry poured into Lavender’s eyes. He released all of the tension in his body and fed her soothing reassurance. The sensation visibly washed over Lavender, her shoulders fell, her clenched fists opened and her rapid breathing slowed.
. He shouldn't be frightened, he told himself. After all Pansy was Draco's friend, would she really do anything to hurt him?
Harry stared at the woman who had somehow turned Draco into a giggling school girl and he was struck by her. Pansy was the most beautiful woman Harry had ever seen. Her hair was inky black, long and straight it hung just below her waist; where the light hit it shown blue like a raven's feathers. Her face was all vampire, black eyes darker than a moonless sky were framed by jutting cheekbones, and yet somehow she didn't look frightening, she was hypnotizing. Her attention turned to Harry, as if she'd just noticed he was even there.
"Reminiscing, I suppose." Draco sighed and gestured to the pile of journals beneath him. He picked one up and tossed it to Harry, who caught it before he realized it was even in the air. Harry thumbed open the pages, the writing was a thin, loopy scrawl and he couldn't understand a single word. He ducked his head, embarrassed.
Draco Malfoy scowled at the letter in his hand and tossed it onto the table beside him with a sigh. He’d heard rumors over the last few nights of animal attacks at the nearby farms and was suspicious of the predator that was terrorizing the area. At first he believed it could be a wolf gone rabid or something of the sort, but the missive delivered to him this morning proved that to be false. An entire village was slaughtered in the night, just twenty kilometers outside of London. This was the work of another vampire, of that Draco was certain, and it was nearing closer to him and his home every night. This vampire must be newly turned, he thought, no one else would be so obvious in their killing.
Despite the blackness, Draco could see Harry roll his eyes at him. Harry traced his fingers over the pulse in Oliver's neck and he flinched, Harry's smile flashed needle sharp fangs.
Draco paused his words and looked at Harry, he was enraptured by his story so Draco continued on. "So we were turned, and my family joined the vampires. The one who turned us had many names in his life, he was older then than I am now. I knew him only as Tomas. He'd lived long enough to remember when vampires didn't have to hide and he longed for that time. He believed that humans were fodder for us, that it was foolish to ever allow ourselves to be driven to the shadows by them. He tried to create an army. Many old vampires joined his cause, and he turned the humans he deemed worthy, the ones who could aid him."
Sheepishly, Harry undressed, avoiding Draco’s eyes as he did. When Harry dropped his trousers and kicked them aside Draco gripped his shoulders and took him in one time, up and down. “You really are quite stunning, Harry. Now, get dressed.”
Draco rose from his spot and crossed the room to Harry, who had taken a seat on the edge of his bed. He sat beside him and took Harry's hands, planting a kiss on each palm. "I've missed you." He murmured at him.
There was a second when Harry stilled and stiffened, taken aback by the unexpected kiss, but as quickly as the hesitation came it went and Harry eased into Draco's touch. He parted his lips, eagerly welcoming the slip of Draco's tongue. Draco's hand slipped around the nape Harry's neck, holding them together with gentle firmness.
Harry sat up and rolled his eyes. His green eyes, Draco noted. "I want a human." Draco could have sworn Harry was pouting at him. He was getting spoiled.
Waves of lust crashed and broke over Harry and a heavy hardness grew between his legs. Draco finally stirred from his slumber, he turned onto his side, pressing Harry's back against his chest and wrapped his arms tightly around the young vampire's waist. Draco's body was firm and solid behind him, Harry ached for the hand on his waist to travel further to where his desire grew. Harry released a sigh when Draco rubbed his nose against the mark on his neck. The skin there had scarred over and two white crescent moons marked the crook of Harry's neck.
Harry’s black eyes widened. A flurry of thoughts scattered in his brain trying to make sense of everything that had happened to him.
Harry’s cheeks flushed again, lighter now that the blood was fading, and he nodded. Draco took his hand and led him from the room. “Come with me to my chambers. I won’t be caught dead with you out and about in bedclothes, I had something nice made for you.”
Blood pooled in Harry’s mouth and it was the most decadent thing he’d ever eaten.  Lavender was sweet and tart, she tasted like oranges in the summertime. Harry breathed in the scent on her skin just the same  as he drank from her neck; he sighed in contentment, and Lavender sighed too. As he drank, Harry listened to the thumping of her heart, when it began to slow he pulled away, licking his lips. He then drew Lavender to his chest, and closed the wound at her throat with a pass of his tongue, all the while soaking in her summery scent.
Drinking the boy’s blood was like fanning a fire, his hunger only grew. Luckily for Harry, the boy’s scream had alerted his family to the danger and three adults, two women and a man, ran toward the sound. If only they had known to stay safely inside their home. Harry started with the boy’s mother, gulping down every last drop of hot red blood that flowed through her body. The father was next and Harry finished him as quickly as he had the other two. He was insatiable and finally he turned to the boy’s sister. She had tried to run while Harry ate her parents but she’d stumbled over her own feet and was lying on the ground when Harry turned to her. Her expression morphed and terror filled her eyes, a strangled scream escaped her lips when she saw Harry’s face. She tried scooting backwards in a desperate attempt to get away but Harry was atop her before she could move. He looked at her face curiously for a moment, she whimpered, and then Harry ripped into her neck too.
Harry wasn't sure if that was better or worse, but he nodded in acceptance, resigned to the knowledge that there was no changing his fate. "Do you remember any of it? Before this?"
Harry quickly pulled on his new clothes, and stepped in front of a tall standing mirror. His black trousers were slim in the leg and fit him perfectly, the white button shirt was crisp and precisely pressed. Over his shirt he wore a dark crimson vest, embroidered with black design. Finally, he wore a black single-breasted dinner jacket. Harry was shocked at the man before him the mirror. His sharp yet androgynous vampire features were made more masculine by the cut and style of his garb, and his pale face was frame beautifully by his black curls and black jacket. He turned to Draco to find him beaming.
“I intend to remain publicly neutral until the very last moment, but I do need both an ear and a voice in the Dark Lord’s inner circle. So, yes. A spy.”
Draco folded his arms, an eyebrow raised skeptically as he inspected them, a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.
Tom knew, from Draco’s instructions, that this was a very polite and artful way of inquiring as to his blood status and family. He smiled at the other boy in response.
“No one is asking you to.” Draco said shortly. “I am informing you of my intentions. In confidence, I might add.”
“How do you know he’s not evil? Even if this Tommy hasn’t done evil stuff yet, maybe he’s planning to?”
Now if only Draco could find out what all his mentor had discovered inside the Gryffindor’s thick skull.
“I’ve decided that, given the state of the wizarding world, and your position with respect to Harry Potter, that the risk of any confusion regarding my nature and my intentions regarding the war and Harry Potter is counterproductive.” Draco said.
Draco thought of his long line of ancestors, the pride of the Malfoy legacy stretching back eons. Nothing that happened now could undo that long history.
Draco watched him, saw his drawn face, paled with the implications of his new position of weakness within the family hierarchy. Shadows from months spent in the company of Dementors.
!” Draco stumbled for a second before finally recovering himself and shaking a finger at her teasingly. “But if you think for one moment that I’ll wear it while eating anything think again! I saw those nutrient-enhancement knots, I’m not completely ignorant!”
They stood back-to-back again, and Draco this time stepped to his right, going in the same direction as they’d gone before, pivoting counterclockwise. No new targets. Potter followed, and had to banish a random monster the Dark Lord had brought as part of his army.
The Slytherins, except for Draco, shrank back under the invisible weight of that power. Draco could feel the pressure too, like Potter’s power was pushing out from his body, pushing the air forward so that it
“Right! Good! Um, I mean, fine then, I guess I should come get you at Slytherin so you aren’t spotted. Uh…midnight at the door to Slytherin?” Potter stammered. Draco wondered how the boy knew where the entrance to Slytherin was.
“Very well. I will leave it to your Prefects to show you to your sleeping arrangements. Good evening.”
“Very well. Thank you, my lord. I Heroditus Nott challenge Heir’s-Mate Malfoy for right of dominion, to bind the lesser family for one generation, in recompense for the ill done my line.”
The ceremony was small and simple. The two young men stood face to face atop a grassy knoll, the priest behind them bracketed by the setting sun.
Draco frowned slightly, knowing Thomas had successfully scared off his friend from trying to hold his brother. They would need to have another talk about his territorial instincts with regard to Scorpius.
The young woman looked amused for a moment, leading him into a private alcove withdrawing the device from a small bag hanging from one shoulder.
“Oh, well at least I’ll have the satisfaction of getting one proper meal into you! It is tradition, after all!” she said cheerily.
“Well…I think it’s really hot…but you can come up to my room to fix it if you want?” Harry said hesitantly, taking a step in that direction.
“You wouldn’t even know!” James sneered, “Now do you want to hear how it’s going to go down or do you just want to wait for your fate in ignorance?”
“Stir it into the nitrogen, which will react and then settle. Then we need an electric current running through the mix, but first filtered through the same amount of the second element, silicon. So…yeah…run the wires like that…then into the silicon, divided evenly, yeah. Great. Okay, I’m clear you can turn on the current.”
, but she’ll feel like she’s known him as her father all her life. It makes her more like his proper daughter.” Ron explained.
The powerful spells keeping his hair beautiful and perfectly in place had worked during that entire time, even with the magical explosion of their bonding. But he had no idea if it would have held up to Bellatrix’s use of Dark magic on him. Or…perhaps more likely…Madame Pomfrey could have removed his grooming charms to avoid cross-interferences with healing spells.
“But you said the Seeker was the key to the game, that their offense was shite, and if we just take out Potter we can run up the score until you catch the snitch.”
The boy whirled back to face him, dark eyes blazing, the wand magically reappearing in the hand that wasn’t busy caressing the baby’s soft white hair.
He raised his wand in salute, an eyebrow raised questioningly. Harry waved his hand agreeably. Draco felt a tingle of magic.
“I am aware of that, Mother.” Draco said, raising a hand in a motion he’d learned from his father, effectively cutting off her arguments.
“Potter?” Draco whispered into the back of Potter’s head. He was trying not to breathe too deeply, Potter carried an exotic spicy smell about him that was making Draco light-headed.
“What? What secrets about me? I helped you solve your riddle, surely you can grant me this small favor?” Tom asked.
So. The Headmaster had clearly deduced that she was there to discover his password, and accommodated it. Draco wondered if this meant the old coot had some inkling of his intentions. Surely not.
From deep inside him issued only a barely audible groan that carried every iota of feeling the young Malfoy had ever allowed himself to feel.
Harry woke up early. Really early. He loved to look at Draco who needed his 8-hour-long beauty sleep. On the other hand, Draco slept late, and Harry tended to fall asleep comfortably settled against his chest while Draco was reading his book on muggle or wizarding medicine.
Harry smelt like broom polish and something sweet. Draco had stopped crying but didn’t want to let go. He had never noticed that Harry had that small scar behind his right ear. His nose stroke Harry’s neck slightly, his lips brushing his skin and the other boy tightened his grip around Draco’s waist. It felt so bloody right…
“Unlike your stupid best friend, I answer when I’m called… especially when it’s people that I care about who call…”
Granger seemed focused on Teddy’s new pierced ears and, clearly, Draco didn’t want to take part in that debate. He shivered when Harry’s finger brushed against his hand. Draco raised an eyebrow but couldn’t stop looking at his best friend. This was so… flamboyant!
Draco was too shocked to react. He certainly didn’t except Pansy to come up and slap the girl in the face.
“Shut up, Draco!” Teddy snapped. “I told you I didn’t want to play your stupid game so now piss off, okay?!”
“Yeah, too bad, I’m not into girls…” Draco sighed, pushing Teddy off his lap. “I’m only into the Harry.”
Just to make sure, Draco marched to his best friend, barely apologizing to the people who had to move to let him pass through.
“No, Sirius was and will always be the white sheep in the family,” Narcissa smiled. “Oh, his parents had been so enraged that day. Not only was he a Gryffindor but he didn’t even have the decency to be chosen as their Prefect! Such a shame…” She chuckled. “Thankfully, Sirius had had the wonderful idea to be at the Potters’ that day, otherwise…” She shook her head. “Anyway, I would still have been proud of you even if you weren’t Prefect, I hope you know that?”
Draco didn’t miss the drop, leaving Harry’s hidden face and crashing into the marble floor. He immediately stood up to catch his boyfriend into a tight hug.
And Draco groaned. It’s been three years since Teddy became friend with the girl and he had talked to her occasionally, but she rarely made any sense. Teddy seemed to be the only one to understand her sometimes…
“A parting gift?” Harry repeated. “I think  I could think about a thing or two… but we don’t have much time… I’m patrolling with Teddy tonight…”
Harry grimaced slightly and for a second, Draco feared that Teddy was lost alone somewhere in the Castle – although Harry seemed to always know where everyone was at all time. But then, a heavy mass with rainbow hair crashed on Harry’s shoulder.
Harry kept Draco informed on Teddy’s progress on an almost daily basis. Sometimes through owl in the morning but most of the time during their now ritual night talks. It was kindly comforting to talk to Harry like that, lying on the bed, a book waiting open on his laps while they talked and joked and smirked and sometimes blushed. Well, especially Harry. The boy was wearing his every emotion on his sleeves.
First, I couldn't find time to post this earlier this week because life just wouldn't let me... then, it's short... sorry.
They kept on flying around for almost an entire hour until they finally retreated to Gryffindor changing room. They were both panting but couldn’t get rid of the smile on their face. Harry’s hair was even worse than usual and Draco grimaced when he noticed how pink his own cheeks were. They looked ridiculous…
And Draco smiled without commenting. However, he could tell there was something else in the Gryffindor’s mind.
“I see…” Draco sighed. “I might tell Theo but Pansy… I’m not sure she can keep a secret.” He admitted.
“We are just wondering if everything alright,” Draco explained – Gryffindors could really be useless sometimes. “You seem a bit down lately…”
’ with Harry pretty easily. Harry was right when he said Teddy would be the hot topic anyway. It seemed that the Wolfe had switched to predatory mode this year and it was funny to watch.
Draco turned away, making his robe swirling like Snape always did, smirking at hearing the astonished reaction of his best friend. Take that Gryffindor bravery!
“No.” Harry over-articulated the simple word and Draco sighed. “They said they won’t stand it quietly anymore, you know… They won’t do anything drastic, of course, but Remus said it’s important that Teddy realises that he isn’t alone… Sirius’s therapist thinks the same apparently. She said that Diggory’s death might have triggered something in him… you know how he never talked about his godfather’s death, right?”
“And he’s not in a good place right now. I can’t force that onto him…” Harry said, shaking his head again.
“Nothing… Just that it doesn’t matter anyway. He’s probably gay so who cares… being raised by two fags, there’s no way he turned up normal… Maybe that’s why he doesn’t want to do it. Because he’s scared, he can’t raise it… I mean, you just have to see you and Potter to know that Ted will follow your steps sooner or later… He worships you so much… it’s disgusting.”
When he entered, Harry was still in his quidditch uniform, his head on his hands, slightly groaning.
“His godfather died last summer???” Draco exploded. “Why didn’t he say anything????? And what do you mean Heir Black?! My mother is from the main branch of the Black family! She would have known!!!!”
Harry looked at him quizzingly. Draco moved his head slightly and the Gryffindor got the message. He took a few steps, probably away from Teddy.
“Potter?!” he guessed, and the mirror blurred to let the messy head appeared. There were red curtains behind the Gryffindor and Draco smirked at the collection of pictures which seemed to paper the boy’s bed head.
He caught his arm and dragged him to his lap. Harry didn’t fight it but still seemed lost in his thoughts.
In the end, Draco had asked Harry if it was okay if he talked to Black about what was going on and he agreed, as long as he wasn’t there. So, Draco asked Lord Black to meet him for the next Hogsmeade weekend. Harry was forbidden to go anyway – he apparently had to get back on his Defence against the Dark Art essay urgently.
At that point, a younger Gryffindor came knocking at their compartment and Harry – as the perfect prefect he was – went to see what was going on.
“I think our parents had made an unbreakable vow to make our lives miserable…” Draco sighed, and Harry chuckled before kissing him lightly on the lips.
Harry jolted up and almost fell on the floor if it was not for Draco catching him before it was too late. The Slytherin glared at Teddy who was waiting by the door, a smirk on his stupid perfect face.
“You’re not a freak, Har’,” he repeated, pressing a kiss on his forehead. “And if you’re not normal, it’s not because you’re with me, it’s because you’re extraordinary in your own way and you’re beautiful and brave and funny and incredibly cute when you blush… It’s because I’ve never seen more beautiful eyes in anyone else, and that includes me! You can only be extraordinary because the grand Draco Lucius Malfoy is more than smitten with you. I love you, Har’ and I’m sorry that that bastard makes you feel so bad about yourself even after so many years. I wish you could see yourself the way I, or even Teddy, see you.”
“That you’re sharing a dorm room with your ex, but you failed to mention it during our 10-month relationship?” Harry asked. “Why would I be?”
“Honestly… Sirius told me that between my parents’ heritage and his, I could probably live the rest of my life without having to work a single day,” he said.
In the end, Draco didn’t manage to find Teddy back before he was forced into Slytherin Common Room. He tried calling him through the two-way mirror, but the Hufflepuff didn’t answer.
That night, he sat down with his friends in the Slytherin Common room. He was just back from his Prefect round; he had switched place with Pansy so he could be with Teddy for a change. The boy had been going out with a Ravenclaw girl, but Draco doubted it would last.
The Gryffindor did take a step in his direction, so he was close enough for Draco to grab his wrist and force him to take another. Yet, his eyes were definitely avoiding his.
“Yeah… Flint asked me the same thing, actually…” he sighed. “I had to tell him I’d forfeit if he curses you last week.”
“It’s… It’s not the same!” Draco answered embarrassed and above all afraid of how easy it would be for his mother to slip that sentence casually in front of Harry or his guardians. He would never hear the end of it if she did.
“What are you talking about Blaise!” Pansy laughed. “I mean, the Boy-Who-Lived is clearly smitten but Draco is only playing around, aren’t you Drake?”
.His imperfections were what made him attractive. Like his stupid glasses that put far too much emphasis on the emerald green of his eyes…
Draco nodded. He knew that Harry had some insecurities, but he didn’t expect him to voice them aloud like that…
(Well, mostly the end of chapter 22, really... and the very beginning of 23 - In other words, the end of their 4th year and the beginning of the Drarry!)
“I told Hermione when she came over last week but I’m not sure she heard me…” Harry admitted sulking a little. “As for Ron… I’ll tell him tonight. He might need a bit of time…”
Draco lifted his eyes from the book he was reading and looked at the two-way mirror laying on his nightstand. He took it in his hand and made sure he was presentable before answering.
And just like that, the tension between them disappeared and Harry’s face was back to that lovely tomato red.
Harry started to blush at that. Well, Draco couldn’t tell that that was very surprising coming from Black.
Harry chuckled but still pressed himself against Draco’s body. That would become their new routine. Lunch after Potion classes because they couldn’t bare be next to one another for two hours without touching or brushing or teasing… Then one or two hours after their respective Quidditch training. They eventually gave up on going back to running together in the morning. They didn’t have time or energy for that this year. They had Prefect duties after all! But that too could be arranged to spend even more time together.
Draco and Harry were sending a quizzingly look at their best friend while the door opened slowly, revealing Blaise with none other than Tracey Davis. All eyes turned to Teddy who refused to meet them back.
“I know…” Draco sighed. “It’s just… it’s not normal. He doesn’t look like he would take care of himself if we’re not there to tell him when it’s time to go to the Great Hall for lunch or dinner…”
Draco froze under the glare on his best friend’s face. And the worst part was that Teddy didn’t even seem remotely sorry when he just went back to his book a few seconds later.
“I… I talked to Blaise and… Davis…” Draco explained in a low voice. “She’s trying to make him jealous because he refused to sleep with her…”
Draco nodded. “Yes, we can trust Snape. He’s an expert occlumens so he can probably help Teddy with his shock or something…”
“It wasn’t easy. He refused Ron, Fred, George or any Weasley… and you met Charlie, he’s hot…” Draco pinched Harry’s ass at that comment – even if he agreed with him. “Then, I proposed Seamus or Dean… Maybe McLaggen – our new keeper, Teddy actually threw up at that point…”
“It’s not good…” the second one followed in the same tone. Draco really didn’t know how Teddy could tell them apart.
“I was five or six, dropped the plates while doing the dishes… they broke… They were my Aunt’s favourite… wedding gifts and all. She hit me with a frying pan…”
“He kept on asking me to promise him that I’d never married Ginny Weasley,” he chuckled slightly, trying to lighten his mood.
“Shut up! I don’t even know how I managed to survive the evening already. When Remus came back home, he asked if we had switched clothes because he could smell your odour all over me! Sirius, literally, rolled on the floor laughing!”
“Hello to you too, Pansy,” he said as naturally as possible. She was coming their way, Theo following her calmly. “Edward is with his guardians; he will be over shortly. How was your summer?”
“I’m sure you will do a wonderful prefect, my dragon. And maybe even a gorgeous Head Boy in two years…”
Teddy told him that he envied Draco’s and Harry’s relationship because it looked so real. Of course, the boy was going out with his 3rd girlfriend that year, but he told Draco that it wasn’t the same and that they were merely playing around while Harry and Draco weren’t.
Harry grimaced at that but still nodded. “Remember how people reacted when you started hanging out with Teddy who was also known to be my friend, back in first year… People just assumed that you befriended Teddy just to build your way up to me and eventually cut my throat in my sleep… I… I don’t want that to happen again…”
Draco didn’t think that it was a very sensible thing to say to shocked students who just might have lost a friend, but he had better things to do with his life than arguing with a senile old man.
Even during their ride home, Teddy wouldn’t talk or look up from his books. It was unnerving. Even more when Draco could see how worried Harry was by all this…
On the 1st of September, Draco arrived early at the station as his mother needed to be somewhere else at 11 but still wanted to go with him. It was ridiculous as he was 15 now, but who was he to deny his mother?
They went at it for long minutes until Harry straightened up a bit. He wouldn’t let the matter go then.
But Draco’s fear had been proven unfounded. Teddy had surprised him by giving him a chance to stay in touch wherever he was and whenever he wanted.
“Not tonight, obviously… But sometimes this week? I need…” Harry bit his lips and apparently decided not to finish his sentence. “I don’t know what to do but maybe you’ll have better luck than us?”
And oh, how wrong that had been. The stupid Gryffindor had betrayed him where it hurt most in order to protect him from small
The lines disappeared and were replaced by a single sphere around the dancing Albus, with several small symbols inside it. Then there was a box around that sphere, with many symbols and portraits inside the box but outside the sphere. And finally many symbols and portraits outside the box.
“Good morning, Great-Aunt.” Draco said to the portrait. The image of the aged Matriarch paused, her mouth frozen in the act of opening to shriek another series of epithets as her eyes frantically took stock of him.
“Yes well, I suppose every artifact has its own range of subjective values, depending on the person. And Sirius Black has been a sore spot for Potter ever since he died. I think I’ll go on and push things a bit.”
“Yeah. And you get me. Well, mostly. I’m different other ways too. But you get the twin thing at least, cuz you’re half, and you can get why it’s different to be different. And, dude, your Wrackspurts are almost gone!”
Harry looked on, shocked for a second at the uncharacteristic behavior, then smiled slowly, sending a conspiratorial glance at the children.
Harry Potter would be taught no lessons, much less reduced to any quivering mass of anything, by this pureblood. Until consummation balanced out their magical cores to each other, Draco was doomed to be the Gryffindor’s whimpering plaything.
Tom looked at Cloud and found behind the pretty mask he wore the blonde’s eyes were practically beaming at him. He cast the boy a wink and turned back to the huddled upperclassmen.
“But! My papa told me that if I do a friend a favor, and want them to be my friend, I must be up front about the recipe vacation!”
Then Potter groaned, low in his throat, and this time Draco did join in with a groan of his own, his imagination spinning with images of what Potter’s hand had just encountered down there.
bounce the Killing Curse off his forehead as an infant. That’s quite…extreme, for accidental magic.” He finally said.
“Based on your predecessor’s performance, I suspect you may have some natural talent for the art.” Dumbledore continued, ignoring the interruption.
“Sorry I’m so late everybody, since I’m half of the life support system for an infant, you may find me easier to locate in my quarters if I’m mysteriously missing from my office at any point.”
“What do you take me for? Your mother? Go on, the sooner it’s done the sooner you can join us. Zabini? Parkinson? Crabbe? Dinner.” Draco gathered his group together and swept off towards the Great Hall.
The shy smile betrayed the bright eyes. Potter was nervous! Draco was glad that Potter wasn’t all confidence. This was apparently affecting him as much as Draco and was he glad about that.
When he made eye contact with Harry, he was not expecting shock writ clearly on his face. “Don’t look so alarmed, Potter. I know my manners, even if I haven’t displayed them in the past,” Draco bit out, clearly annoyed, and a little hurt.
And frankly, no matter if we had won, if our lives were switched I’m sure we would have still found each other.
“Draco Malfoy, would you allow me to take you out on a date and woo you properly?” Potter almost whispered. As if afraid of disturbing something.
It’s surprising to me that your rabble of Gryffindors cannot seem to hold their liquor. Blaise and I met up the morning after and we were both in top shape. Though he did mention Ginevra was, shall we say…..extra fiery that morning. I shudder to think what he’s getting himself into with that witch, but his mood since the start of their relationship has taken quite a turn for the better. A holiday does sound wonderful and I know I’ll need it, I feel my hair going grey just thinking about the stress.
Harry knew that Draco was avoiding talking about his feelings. He was going to let it slide for now.
But I do know I am human. Don’t need to write you a letter to know that — but maybe you need to look in the mirror. The eyes that will stare back will be human, regardless of the haunted appearance. You are human, Draco. Because if you weren’t, those bloodcurdling dreams wouldn’t affect you. You wouldn’t be trying to figure out all these things. The fact that you so desperately want me to present a compelling case to you about all things life, and magic, and love is proof enough.
“No, Potter. I don’t want your charity. We both know you’re going to be selected, I may as well go stand in front of the warden and ask them to take me in!”
Before Harry could agree, Ginny snorted. “No, thank you. Ron would have kept making weird faces every time the topic of my sex life would come up,” she pointed out while loudly banging the car door shut.
Voldemort’s specialty was always the mind though. I’m not sure what curse he used, whatever spell he cast upon me, but it’s never gone away. Even now it sometimes hits me, the twisting of my thoughts. I can’t tell what’s real anymore, what’s
It was easier being alone. Voldemort was persuasive - I would have given up the Order in a heartbeat, killed Dumbledore and damned the entire Wizarding World if it meant keeping you safe.
I'll have you know that Gigglewater is NOT my favourite drink. Some little twink bastard friend of Seamus' was doing his best to get me drunk (he could've just waited, it turns out) so when he said "Gigglewater is SO unmanly" I took the out and chugged it every time he looked at me (which was too much — Seamus is also due a hex to the bollocks). Anyway, I may have underestimated Gigglewater's potency (I'm sure you noticed) but I promise I didn't like it. And sorry if I was… weird. Yeah. I promise I'm more “civilised” under the influence of a Tempranillo (if you like red) or a dry af Sav (if you prefer white). I tend to avoid rosé myself. Bad night back in Auror training with a guy I should've probably avoided with a bit more finesse (I threw up on him — but to be fair, he deserved it. He was lecherous, and a Wasps supporter). Do you ever get people throwing themselves at you? I can only assume the fame has about the same level of potency as knowing how to dress yourself nicely and all that shit you do. Never teach me your ways — my life is dangerous enough. Though, actually, if you could look at my wedding outfit and let me know what you think while you're here on Thursday? Ginny reckons it's fine but I maintain it's TOO FUCKING TIGHT and she’s being a mischievous shit. As usual.
I cannot convince you of anything once you've made up your mind. I had forgotten that, and your letter so kindly reminded me by challenging me to convince you. So, I won't try to. But I can lay out my heart for you, right here, in this letter.
PS. I know you’ve already read this and you might not even take it home with you, but I wanted to say, for posterity, you have the most amazing arse and I will now probably never be able to sit on my couch without a raging hard-on. Thanks.
PS. Don't wear white, I'm going to make spaghetti and meatballs (so red wine is probably better - right? See, I'm not totally uncivilised).
. Convince me that the wizarding world is different, that there is something more out there. Because I ran. I ran from that life, and I had no intention of coming back.
“No. That’s not what I’m surprised about. I’ve never… never... You know what, we can discuss this later. Let’s focus on the problem at hand.”
Anway, if you’re interested, I was thinking of inviting them around mine for dinner this weekend under the guise of planning the stag and hen parties. I’ll cook if you supply the drinks? (If I ever recover enough to drink again) How’s Thursday?
The blond man had made it all of ten steps before he came to a halt. Almost comically. With Ginny avoiding colliding into the dramatic git that was Harry’s boyfriend at the last minute. Also comically.
At the risk of sounding sappy again, you deserve the throne. It doesn’t have to be Malfoyan though, does it? Although now I understand your need for secrecy. It is part of the reason you survived. But why from me? Why now? After we won; albeit without most of our sanity. But I wonder, does it matter? Because if I can have you again, my sanity, or whatever is left of it, is a price I would be willing to pay.
“Gentlemen. There will be no fighting in the Hospital Wing. Mr. Malfoy, here is a potion to heal your ribs and another to reset your joint. Mr. Potter, you’re in rather worse condition, you’ll take a bit more work.” Pomfrey glared at Draco before handing him two vials.
Regulus clutched at his stomach as a knot of loss almost made him double over, his vision swimming with tears until all he could make out was a pair of muggle shoes – Nike sneakers – standing patiently in front of him.
any recording spell in any of the locations you’ve reserved for us, and you don’t remove them now, I’ll find out about them when I slip Veritaserum in your tea at some undisclosed future date, and then remove your bits in a very painful and magically permanent way.” He informed them.
“I suppose Dumbledore is using it for something and is protecting it his own way. That should be completely unnecessary. An ancient pureblood family home…is virtually unassailable. If the Lord of the Manor is managing it properly, that is.”
been willing to do exactly that, something that Draco couldn’t exactly grill him for without explaining how he came to know the secret.
“Malf-…Draco’s right. You don’t need his notice. But you shouldn’t call him the Dark Lord either. That gives him even more power than being afraid to say his name. Most people refer to him as ‘You-Know-Who.’”
“There is a particularly painful existence reserved for those who destroy the one they love.” He said somberly.
“Blood-Traitors! Muggle-lovers and mudbloods defile the house of my ancestors!” was the first thing Draco heard as the portkey deposited him in the entry hall of Grimmauld Place.
Harry waded swiftly towards Draco, pushing small waves of water in front of him, and Draco noticed that the pink head of his own penis was exposed in the troughs between waves. He looked over at Harry and caught his breath at the brown head just barely breaking the surface.
“And Dumbledore, and Severus, and your werewolf friend. That’s as far as it can go. Until it’s done, sealed, and the blood gift completed.” Draco pronounced.
Draco took a deep breath. He would say as much as possible to be recognized as truth, but as little as possible to inform.
potions, right under our very noses! You know which cabinet that alarm is for, some of those potions could be dangerous in a student’s hands!”
“Draco, darling! How did it-” Narcissa faltered as she saw her son’s grey eyes brimming with anger and disappointment. “Draco?”
“Undoubtedly. These are generational magics, my Lord. The core of every Malfoy buried in our cemeteries is joined together as the power of the Malfoy blood magic. No wizard, not even Merlin, could stand against the Malfoy magic while standing on Malfoy land.”
There was a moment of silence, only broken by one of the twins coughing hysterically behind his hand. Draco glared at the offending bookend.
“Nonsense! As long as the boundaries of the contracts, and the state of technical virginity is guarded by appropriate spells, I see no reason to interfere with their exploration. I do most certainly approve of the limit of two guests per prefect, however…that should keep your…
with you, father? The old Lucius would have already slipped into the role James Potter left vacant and become Harry Potter’s closest mentor by now!”
“My father was at the Dark Lord’s right hand. My grandfather before him. They took excellent notes.”
“I know all about your prophecy.” Draco waved a hand dismissively. “I took that into account when I planned everything. That’s part of the reason why we can’t be seen together.”
The boy took a deep breath. There was one thing, one wonderful amazing thing that would certainly get the other’s interest.
Harry seemed to have forgotten his own problems for a moment, and he and Hermoine…and the rest of the students in the Great Hall…were now staring at Ron with quite a bit of interest as the message went on…
“Animagus transformation is the ability for a witch or wizard to transform into the form of an animal. It’s very difficult, most wizards and witches never learn how to do it, but Sirius and my father both did it while they were in Hogwarts.” Potter told her.
“Tom has had some trouble with the wand you gave him. Or perhaps I should say…wands.” Harry added, pulling the familiar length of Yew from his inner pocket. Tom produced a similar wand from his own pocket.
Draco snatched his wand back from his boyfriend and sent stinging hexes at the twins, catching each in the backside as they retreated.
“Now. Mr. Malfoy. We have double the normal number of first-years. Something I was not prepared for, which almost always displeases me. Somehow I suspect you are responsible.”
she wasn’t forbidden. Like the Weasley’s weren’t desperately in need of a beneficial marriage alliance, given the pitiful state of their coffers.
“Right, and I’ll try not to insult her friends right away either, dear,” Pansy reminded him sweetly.
Draco paused, then nodding to accept the compliment and the implied apology. He considered his father.
He flipped the cover open and found the table of contents, feeling frustration curdle in his stomach like sour milk as each of the chapter titles failed to apply to the situation:
run to that old fool!” Snape snapped. “You’re throwing about accusations you have no conception of, and-”
The few Light Malfoys had always hidden the Sceptre during their lives, ashamed of its connotations. But the more numerous Dark wizards and witches, and even one Dark Lord, had always retrieved it. Flaunted it, corrupting its use to more and more heinous acts.
Granger’s wand was suddenly out and pointed at Draco, no doubt some obscure curse she’d read in a book somewhere on the tip of her tongue.
And suddenly they were in the center of a crowd of Weasleys, all wanting a chance to hug and kiss and exclaim over the couple.
Their father had been absolutely frantic with nerves about the impending trip to Hogwarts. Trunks had been packed and repacked and audited for further repacking. Their wands had been meticulously polished, counter-jinxes drilled, Protean charms executed and tested, style and color charts for outfit assembly memorized and recited, and the pre-term reading assigned by their godmother obsessively supervised.
