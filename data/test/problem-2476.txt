It ate away at Harry's consciousness like it no doubt ate away at the blonde boy's soul.
"God, Draco, I love having you at my mercy," Harry smirked as he nibbled along Draco's jawline. He let his tongue wander over the pale skin and rocked his hips downward. Draco grunted and thrust his hips, grinding their dicks together through the burn of their underwear.
However, when he looked at Draco as they wandered from shop-to-shop he knew he was falling for the blonde, and falling incredibly fast. He couldn't help but wonder if the older man felt the same way or not. He hoped so. But he wasn't going to put his feelings on the line and risk their friendship for some unrequited love nonsense. He was a big boy and he learned from his mistakes.
Draco looked up at his godfather and felt the fight ebb out of him for a moment. He clenched and unclenched his fingers and shuddered in his heavy dressing gown. The fire crackled in the grate before them and he stared into it before answering, "Fine, I'll write him a letter. But I shall decide where to go from there on."
"Grow up," he smiled as she huffed weakly beside him, her lips twitching slightly. He reached out a hand and squeezed her shoulder, "I didn't think I'd see the day you felt sympathy for Malfoy, Hermione."
All through breakfast Draco kept his eye on the blonde man, casually dressed in dark pressed trousers and a fitted knit jumper that brought his eyes out beautifully. He was only half paying attention to what Hermione and Ron were planning for their day and he ignored Ginny completely when she was coming out with what she and her latest boyfriend were planning for the little holiday. He didn't care. The only thing that he cared about was Draco and having a great day together, even if nothing more came out of it.
"Well I know you love Italian food so I decided to make us reservations at 'Ask Italian' for you."
Harry mentally grumbled as he tightened his folded arms across his chest and glared out over the balcony of Severus' new summer house settled in the Lake District. He didn't know how Severus had managed to do it behind his back, but before he knew it, it had been entered into the registry that Harry had the first two weeks of August off on holiday leave and it was non-negotiable. Suffice to say he was not happy when he'd had to pack his trunk and join Draco, Narcissa, and Lucius on a train to the Lake District in the blazing heat of the August sunshine. He barely spoke at all the entire journey up there, not feeling the need to participate since he was already in such a horrible mood.
"I wish we didn't have to leave," Harry breathed as the sun kissed his face and a soft breeze combed over his features. Draco nodded his head. He, too, had no desire whatsoever to return home to dreary London. To a small flat that would have cold, uninviting floorboards to tread over. And yet it was their home, and they needed to return there to make sure that it remained their home. He clutched Harry tighter to his side and rested his head sideways upon his lovers cotton skullcap.
She didn't want to risk giving anything away after all.
As one, they stood up, plates in hands, and moved over towards the Gryffindor table. A wave of whispers followed them but they ignored the voices as they went to sit down on either side of the Gryffindor table. Despite the slight awkwardness, they squared their shoulders and continued to eat and started talking among themselves.
"I know and I'm not asking you to forgive me.
Draco was clearly fighting the instinct to go back to sleep. He reached out a slack arm and twitched his fingers in Harry's direction, "Come back to bed," he hummed softly, his eyes struggling to stay open
"What if someone were to find out about it?"
Later the night, by the light of the candle Harry took a panicking breath before ripping open the envelope despite knowing already what was inside. The solid shape through the paper was hardly difficult to discern. When he tipped the contents into his palm the tears finally gushed out along with the rough sobs that choked out of his throat. He dropped down sideways onto the mattress and pressed his clenched fist to his mouth, his wet lips kissing his white fingers that were clenched tightly around a simple gold band.
Last night however, he hadn't been able to restrain himself as he'd read about the latest story Skeeter was spewing about his life, most of which wasn't even remotely true. It had struck a nerve when his guard was down and he hadn't wanted to unleash the anger on Draco, but he found he couldn't stop himself. He'd left as soon as he made sure the blonde was alright.
"Shh, shh," Harry hushed him with a finger against his lips. "Don't worry about it, it'll feel good."
With a quick wordless twisting of his wand, Draco transformed the limp hospital gown into a replica of Harry's black fleece all-in-one pajama sets that he wore in winter. It even had the feet and hand covers too. Harry hummed and hugged his waist, finally feeling warmth dribble back into his body. "Thank you," he breathed.
A pressure that felt like a dragon's egg collided heavily into his chest. Bright white light flashed momentarily in his eyes. Water surged through his gullet and poured out his nose and bubbled up at the back of his throat. The pressure pummelled into his chest once again, and he felt his skull crashing back down onto something rough and hard. The world seemed to spin and water poured out of his throat and made more room for air to surf down his nose. Colour swam in spots before his eyes before settling into blurred shapes stretching far and wide. His lungs soaked up as much air as possible and his stomach unwound itself from the knot it had been twisting in. He pressed his mouth against what felt like wet wood and inhaled stiffly before his forced his head up.
Harry huffed a small smile and wiped at his dampening eyes before looking up with a timid smile at Draco, "I kept all of your letters as well. I had them under my pillow whilst I slept. I think they helped me push on with the treatment and the therapy."
There was a crack that streaked through the sky, a flash of bright light and then a torrent of thick, heavy raindrops began pelting down across the grounds. Harry gasped and bolted up to his feet as though he'd personally been struck by lightning. Draco scurried up to his feet tugging the blanket up as he leaned heavily on the tree trunk. Harry didn't notice how close they were, tucked underneath the weak shelter of the blossom tree. Draco couldn't help but smile. It had been ages since he'd gotten caught in such bad weather so suddenly. The laugh that bubbled out made Harry look up at him as if he were mad, but he didn't care. He stepped out from the blossoms, his cane dropping into the grass, as he tilted his chin up, spread his arms wide and laughed up into the falling rain, feeling as though he were being reborn into a fresh new chapter of his life.
"I think that's everything," Theo grumbled about ten minutes later as he came back from the store cupboard with, what he hoped, would be the last of the jars they needed.
He placed the hat on Harry's head and bent over the back of the chair to press a kiss upon his boyfriend's mouth. He then gripped the handle bars of the wheel chair and began his struggle home, his head held high into the air, daring anyone to mess with them.
It was half past eleven on Christmas Eve and Harry found that he wasn't tired as he sat curled up on the plush red armchair in the common room of Gryffindor tower. He was exhausted from working on his holiday assignments to the point that he'd practically finished all of them. He'd spread a blanket over his lap and stared into the fire as it crackled in the grate. He was so deeply lost in thought that the tapping of a barn owl on the window sill almost made him jump out of his skin.
Draco shifted slightly so that he was now looking at Harry. His eyes didn't have any weight to them, though, it was almost as though he were slipping into a daydream. Was he imagining what Harry had been through, what it had felt like? Harry shivered and wondered if anyone could really and truly know what he felt like, and he doubted that it would ever happen.
Harry's smile as the sunlight dappled his features, took Draco's breath away. They were standing outside their hotel, as Draco unloaded the two suitcases from the car boot and Harry held onto Seeker's lead with a semi-limp arm, his face up-turned towards the sky. Seeker seemed to be reveling in the sunshine as well -it was such a dramatic change from the on-off weather of London.
Feeling sick and shaken he tossed the pillow across the room and watched as it thumped weakly against the wall and slid down to the floor. His was hot and cold in equal measures, shaking and biting down so hard on his tongue to stop from screaming, that he could taste his own blood pooling around his teeth. He clawed his fingernails down the length of his face, hyperventilating between his palms and trying not to cry and scream out at the fear spiking in his heart. Draco was still alive; he was still breathing and shifting restlessly in the bed. He was fine, absolutely fine! The manic laugh that choked out of his throat almost scared him even more as the dark night sky outside lighting with the first amber kiss of dawn. He rubbed at his arms and legs, his fingers almost vibrating with the cold as he watched Draco from across the room. How could he even think about ridding the world of someone so beautiful? He shook his head and sneered at himself, digging his nails into his thighs and wincing as the blood seeped out and spotted the cream nightshirt. He'd have to get rid of it before anyone saw. He'd been so careful with his others, not clawing at himself through the fabric, but this time he had needed the pain, needed to feel something other than the dark numbness creeping into his mind and freezing his blood.
"Promises, promises Malfoy," Potter hissed out as he jerked in the chair. His mouth opened in a silent 'o' shape as he came in both his jeans and Draco's hand.
"Sorry babe," Draco purred softly as he stopped at a cross-roads and walked over the tarmac towards the tram-stop. "Might as well get back to the hotel quickly so that we can get you all warmed up."
Draco didn't even pretend to look offended of having a wand jabbed into his leg. Even to this day, after months of progress, there were still the odd group of students who still weren't keen on having 'death eater's' in the school any longer. According to them, it didn't matter that the Dark Mark on Draco's forearm had seared and burned for a week straight after Voldemort's demise and was now just a patch of raw, red skin that had scabbed over and was finally healing. The bullying was mostly being taken care of, but there was still the odd night when Draco would come back into the eighth year common room and with blood running down into his collar from a busted nose.
Harry let out a cry of sheer agony as his blood poured out of him and stained the floors. He felt his boy convulse and slump down onto the floor, Draco's roaring voice of anger toward his father, Voldemort, the Order, the Death Eaters and the Ministry blurring and distorting in his ears as he sank down onto the floor and let the darkness overwhelm him.
"Does it hurt?" Harry asked.
Harry was so close to turning, swiping up his wand and walking out of the door and just leaving the blonde there to sulk. But as soon as his hands rested on the doorknob, he found that he didn't have the energy to feel so defeated anymore. He wasn't going to walk away from this. He turned around and silently crossed the room to where Draco stood. He stood a foot away from him and drew in a deep breath, "I had a pretty poor childhood with my muggle relatives, so much so that getting a full meal seemed like a miracle, let alone Christmas dinners. I didn't get much of any of that until my first Christmas here in first year. That really was magic and it took my breath away. It made all the tormenting of past years and the darkness from Voldemort's seemed quite small and meaningless." He heard the blonde snort and couldn't blame him. "That first Christmas brought to light the magic I'd always dreamed of and then it was real. It was so real, Draco," he breathed out and watched as the blonde shuddered gently in front of him, "I want you to see that magic. You deserve to see that kind of magic. Is there anything I can do to make you see it?"
Calais, France in the year 1852 was the year where Harry Potter's life took such a dramatic turn of events and had quite literally changed his life forever. He had been training underneath a very prestigious Healer in the French wizarding community and spent a lot of his time studying in the basement of the apothecary, his clothes often smelling heavily of various forms of incense and potions ingredients. He didn't mind it because he truly did love what he was studying. He got to sit in on surgeries and analyse various patients under the effects of different treatments. He didn't mind being on trivial duties that sent him around the hospital; he liked the menial tasks as much as the elaborate ones and would write long letters to his father in London, informing him about the various things he was learning about. He earned barely enough to keep himself alive on but he truly did love the work that he couldn't turn his back away from it.
Harry smirked as he peppered gentle kisses up Draco's body, smoothing his free hand up and down the blonde man's pale muscles, "It's alright, my love, just relax and you'll enjoy it."
"AH!" he screamed out, his veins throbbing in his throat as he punched at his legs and chest and stomach. He wanted to feel something other than the crippling desire to curl into a ball and die there. "AHHHH!" he let out another scream, his entire body burning with shame, humiliation and overwhelming sensation that no one had cared enough to follow him.
Seeker was more than happy as he bounded through into their apartment towards his cushioned bed by the sofa. Draco went straight through into the kitchen whilst Harry announced that he was going to flick through the T.V. channels for a descent movie to watch.
Harry nodded weakly, "Yes he had but I also find that it would be beneficial to me if you agree to let me read to you."
And Nicolas is so adorable! He's almost always happy. Such a smiley baby! I'm looking forward to blowing raspberries on his tummy tomorrow and playing peekaboo. All in all, it's going to be a nice, relaxing, calm day. I may not even get out of bed!
"Well, since you're the one asking, I suppose I can't refuse," I could vaguely hear him say through the speaker against your ear.
How dare you tell me that our babies might have something seriously wrong with them, and then just NOT explain anything?!?! I'm reaching nearly Panicky Harry levels of concern here!
Alas, we didn't quite get to actual penetration, as Rita woke up from her nap and insisted that Harry comfort her. Actually, this was a bit of a shock for all of us, since she'd been sleeping in a bed with the boys in a room that is connected to our suite, but right there with the door open so that we could hear them if they woke up. Rita must have had a bad dream again, because she apparently sat up from a dead sleep and wailed: "DAAAAA!!!!"
Draco
Friday January 19th
Then Hermione pointed at you as imperiously. "Ron! Harry! Blaise! Take all of the children and go, right now!!!"
I know I’ve been busy, I know I need to make my family a priority right now. The first few weeks were crazy, while yes I had some kids that were just curious about me, I mostly had a huge influx of muggleborns this year. Quite a few in Gryffindor, but a few from other houses as well, even a Slytherin if you’d believe it. And as the muggle studies teacher, they’ve latched onto me as a little bit of home and normal in a scary new place.
I just had a really great, and enlightening, talk with Sirius. Even though he and I talk often, we rarely talk about our shared past. He talks about my parents, and he has asked some questions about my childhood, but those few years we had together before I lost him is a time we rarely talk about. I don't know if we're both still a bit too fragile with our feelings about him coming back or what but we've definitely skirted around those ugly years during the war.
That said, it's almost impossible to leave and/or purposely 'ignore' a two week old when she has the ability to blow things up when she's not getting her way. For example, Kisa decided that SHE could calm Morgana down by taking her and giving her a firm look while saying: "There now, love, your Great Auntie has you, and I will NOT tolerate fussiness."
I had a chance to peek at your emails but had absolutely no time until just now to reply (aside from the quick demand for an update). I am assuming and hoping you're at home. As you are probably well aware, I am not. You were right about one thing, I was definitely called to the all hands on deck situation here at Unity. The part you were wrong about was the smooth transition because they weren't traumatized. It has been an absolute nightmare. We are used to traumatized children, we are less used to brainwashed children.
So... What was it?
Why don't ***I*** have a tattoo of that?!
As I'm sure you're aware, since you called it, I of course gave in immediately to Siri's begging to be allowed to try out. Unlike you though, I do have some stipulations.
"I want a turn!" Harry repeated, more emphatically. "I mean it's obviously going to be weird, but I know I CAN, and just... I want to..."
Draco
My dear, it's time to say, I thank god for you, I thank god for you, in each and every single way, we are the lucky ones,
Biological Parents Harry Potter and Voldemort
"Oh my darling boy!"
Tiger and Viper seem very amused; my counterpart looking quite happy to watch too, while the Viper is getting rather handsy with his husband. The three of us are talking about Nora, since she's also a new development since the last time we saw them.
P.P.P.S. Why is the Minister for Magic going with us???
Then I realized that with her in the room, I could encourage them to practice *trying* to hit each other in the five spots they already knew. It's shocking how much better at self defense they get when they KNOW what'll happen to them should they let their guard down. Only a couple let an opponent slip through their defenses and had to be tended to by the Mediwitch.
Harry
I did the only thing I could and hugged her tight. "I promise I won't tell him. The news should come from you, whenever you decide the time is right to tell him. No pressure."
I was prepared to be anxiously anticipating your arrival right now. Don't get me wrong, I am definitely hoping you get home any moment. If you were to show up right this moment, I would go running out of this classroom screaming "Class is canceled, tell everyone not to bother me for the rest of the day" possibly knocking over small children if they happen to get in my way.
Just like Lumi does. She's SOOOO soft! I could just lay here petting her all day!
I need to preface the upcoming conversation with: I love her with all of my heart and soul. She is perfect and wonderful and beautiful and brilliant and powerful and MINE. Nothing she could ever do would change my love for her; NOTHING.
I take a few minutes to wander around poking at his Occlumency shield, decide that he's not quite ready to have an official test on it yet, and then give him some advice and assign him to keep working at it before leaving. Thus, I've only been spending between five and ten minutes a week teaching him - far less traumatic than you were anticipating, I'm certain.
(See the end of the chapter for
-Draco, Oliver here, I agree with everything Harry is saying just so you know. You would be brill and I'll support any decision you make. I love you-
Harry
House Unknown: Hat sorted Hufflepuff
Fine, fine, fine, apparently I have been very selfish since I purposefully scheduled an intake of rescue horses just so I wouldn't have to help with wedding planning. Next you'll probably say I was the one who started the barn fire which caused the issues in the first place! You know I did not plan this specifically to get out of dealing with panicky River duty. It just so happened to coincide and I took advantage of the situation. I might be part Slytherin, but there's definitely Gryffindor in me! I won't cause an issue to get my way, I'll only twist it around until it suits my own purposes.
OMGs you guys! I'm so excited about the story arc that Chrissie and I came up with while she was on vacation, that I serious want to post everything between this post and it, like right now. lol. But I also don't want to run us out of new material in one go, so... sorry? :-)
Wednesday June 22nd
"Oliver, love, shift onto your side and use your mouth on Harry while I finish seeking my pleasure, yeah?" I commanded even though the end seemed to be a question.
And doesn't that just prove the point that I'm shallow and vain? I got mad for shallow reasons and finally stopped throwing a strop because of vain reasons, then completely forgot why I was mad for selfish sexual reasons. Ugh, I really am a terrible person. And... I don't even care.
He sighed. "Alright, fine, since you refuse to listen to reason, tell me: WHAT will it take for you to finally feel like you have atoned?"
Oh my poor sweet boy. It took every bit of self control to not just start sobbing again.
I had to interrupt, "And this block won't place her in danger of becoming an obscurial? Or cause her magic to shift so that the other threads take on darkness to compensate?"
I walked over to the group while everyone else stood a bit back so as to not crowd the station should anyone else need to come looking for help. "I'm Draco Malfoy and that's my Aunt and daughter you're shouting at."
Dear Hestia, so sorry to squick you literally the moment you post a specific request not to be squicked. You probably want to skip Harry's email in this chapter.
All of my love,
Mon Coeur,
"Until he isn't," I grumbled, afraid that the babies would once again grow too big and YOU'D have terrible problems.
At this point, I can only pray that you don't feel the same way about my keeping this a secret from you.
Love you!
Has Muffy been sneaking our daughter ice cream a lot??? I must go deal with this...
Eric looked rather amazed as he and his father looked around the Sun Room a moment later. "This place is HUGE!"
In any case, I'm about to take Viona shopping for her familiar. See you later!
Tuesday at 10:39 PM
But you're deluding yourself if you think they're not going to be stared at. They're going to be gorgeous! Being stared at and pointed at will just be part of their reality. The other kids at school will whisper to each other as they pass by: "Look, it's that Malfoy kid. They say his/her father used to be the best looking kid at Hogwarts for seven years in a row - before he married that foolish Gryffindor bloke who broke every rule the school ever made and had to have a few more made up just so he could break them. Didn't he also save the world or something?"
"We do," I assured him. "Who better to be her Godfather than her biological father's best friend?"
Which is pretty ironic, I admit, because she's my first baby - you know, the first one I had inside me. Thus, she holds a special place in my heart. I'm almost always thinking of her. But I suppose, I also trust that she's a capable Malfoy who doesn't need her dad interfering in her life anymore. I dunno why I forgot to get her a gift, but the thought of not having one to give her today really made me upset.
The younger kids were playing something that resembled Hide and Hex, and the golden and all too brief silence was utterly destroyed, but that was only to be expected. Naturally, Jasmine couldn't run around and play, so she was in my favorite wrap on my chest and facing/watching all the action. She was rather excited, repeatedly squirming and flinging her arms and legs out as if she was imagining herself running around with all the others.
But then I realized that I had a baby - or well, probably teenager - marmoset on my shoulder and that was frankly rather amazing since every time we've been here before, the marmosets have kept themselves hidden and I haven't wanted to scare them by hunting them down just to pet them a couple of times. But now that I had one and it seemed interested in me, I plan to change forms later and see what it's like to try to have a chat.
Huh... You were right! You said that I had gotten parasites feeding of my energy and magic, I just didn't realize it at the time...
For the most part, festivals like this are so welcoming to everyone. It's like a giant family, where everyone is allowed to be themselves and they find likeminded people or at the very least, people who welcome everyone. But no matter how great the group, there are always some bad apples that threaten to spoil the bunch. So when we were walking hand in hand I heard someone mumble "fucking queers" as we walked past. I tensed, and honestly thought about just ignoring it since we had all of the children with us. Especially since I didn't notice you react at all, I thought maybe I misheard.
Oliver looked nearly irate. "I was SO CLOSE to another orgasm! Couldn't you both have waited about 4 more seconds?!"
Sirius was looking around nervously. "We should probably leave him here and take off before the spells wear off and people notice something."
"Exactly!" I concurred. "But as I was saying, not only has he been even quicker to anger lately, but he's also been holding onto his anger, and maybe most telling of all, he has spent YEARS working past his issues and moving on, and he had basically succeeded, and now suddenly, they all seem to be back in full force."
Honorary?!?
River stood up rather abruptly and shouted out: "Mahafsoun and I are going to have a baby!"
I never said the clue was hidden in our room. It's hidden in the email. But don't you worry darling, I have a second clue and this one IS hidden in our closet. Do you think you are up to getting Viona dressed today? Ask Muffy to come get Viona from me and ask Dibly to pop you into the closet. Right at the entrance where I have been keeping Viona's collection of shoes, is a deep lavender swing top with little coordinating purple, green, and blue floral leggings. Could you please please please get her dressed in that outfit for me?
After lunch, I had another meeting that I'm not entirely sure why I was there. It was a departmental Head thing, except it wasn't run by nor did it involve Hermione. This is the second one in as many days, and since all that really happened was drinking a glass of cheap wine while discussing progress on some of the current issues they're dealing with, I'm thinking that it might actually be a daily bitching session designed to help them unload and relax a bit.
They were surprised to see me, but when we explained that I was simply there to tell Honoko about my visions of her father, they seemed to shrug as if thinking that I was a bit weird but harmless. They asked Honoko if she wanted to wait for me to leave, but she looked up toward the sky and said: "I have a feeling that Malfoy Draco-san is a part of this for now."
"Say mate, have you ever thought about finding someone and settling down?"
Don't be too thankful that you're not experiencing Miles' dilemmas as his dad. I am sure between our six we'll have plenty of instances of stress and not knowing the "right" thing to do or say. It's not all going to be distracting our daughter's anger away by bribing her with a trip to Russia! And I think it's absolutely hilarious that you're going to tell our kids they can't date until they're twenty when we were married before our nineteenth birthdays! You great big, gorgeous, hypocrite!
She took a deep breath. "Police tried looking for him too. But they've not seen him. Irene has put out adverts in the paper trying to appeal to him directly or to anyone who might have seen him. So far, nothing. I originally picked up this file thinking that MAYBE we could find and then reunite another child with an anxious mother, but as I interviewed her, things came to light that make me wonder..."
"Dad!" Siri protested, pushing me away. "I'm too old for stuff like this!"
Why maroon???
More importantly, I would have insisted on us all using my tech, and so, someone would have been monitoring us and could have come to our rescue if needed.
Thus, cased closed, I suppose.
Oberon - on the other hand - looked like he couldn't decide whether he should run screaming or pet them and pray they didn't eat him.
"Hopefully not THAT early! I'm not due until December 20th!" Elena exclaimed in alarm.
I started to go after him, I couldn't let him think I don't love him. He's my world! My little buddy! I'd do anything for him, that's why I'm so upset about this whole thing. But seeing as you were the only adult who wasn't openly weeping, you told me to try and calm myself down while you try talking to him.
"DRACO! Stop talking to the baby and start playing with ME! Please..." He pouted like an adorable cherub. I couldn't help but kiss him.
P.P.P.S. Pippa is dancing like an utter slag, but the Russian Officials don't seem to mind.
So I show up, and while it's been a while since I've seen him, I've known the boy for what, fifteen years now? You wouldn't think he'd react in any other way to my showing up except a "Wow, hi Harry, it's been a while." Right?
Hey! My loves! This week is insane and while I know you each have your own things to get done since we are moving next week, we could really use some help playing with these kids. The people who've been hard at work getting ready for this weekend's activities could really use some prep time where the Kids aren't underfoot!
Draco
As for this class, I'm so giddy that I'm almost feeling high!
He and I popped back a little bit before dinner. I assumed I'd find you two in a few places; I thought our room would be most likely, possibly OUR playroom or the KIDS' playroom, definitely thought the stables would be worth a search, but I guess I should have read your email first since you were out owling in the north fields. When I finally gave up and asked Muffy to help me find you, she sent me that way. I greeted you both with kisses and enforced Muffy's command of "tell the Masters dinner is being ready."
I am going to insist you sleep with us tonight and not in the garage again. You've been so tired, you're obviously not getting enough rest. I called the wizard who contacted us in the first place, he will be taking over Amala's care while we're on our big eight day trip. She will be fine. Your family needs you on this trip. Remember feeling as though you needed to tell Lainie to stop flirting and spend time with her family? You need to stop caring for the cheetah and join your family on this holiday.
Ok, I may be exaggerating. While cheetahs could eat a baby easily, I don't think Amala actually would. But I certainly didn't want to test that theory! Can you check me for grey hairs sometime soon? I haven't seen a single one, but I am certainly assuming they're on their way with this troop of drama bringers that is my family.
As I’m sure you’re unsurprised by, it was wonderful. I am already in love with every single Kid here. And we’ll be taking them all home with us.
Your Daddy Harry
Zwei looked at me warily, even tilting his head to the side and squinting his eyes almost suspiciously.
My Harry,
This is where things devolved into very NOT traditional territory at all. I'm not sure which culture it is, actually - Chinese maybe? - but there's a culture that believes that if a malevolent being kills someone, their spirit is trapped in that being's service until freed. It's NOT a Zulu belief, but I suppose that's not the thing that matters here.
Draco tells Harry a little more about the darkness inside him.
My Loves,
“Dads? Dads?! DADS!!!” River demanded their attention. “Stop snogging for two minutes!!!”
"So... at least I can say with all confidence that Darrin Young had NOT been involved with the gang of his own volition, and in all honesty, that's probably the reason he died," Hannah finished informing me.
So, I'm going to take Rita to the ballroom and dance while we wait for our appointment.
Phew.
Yeah, the Luna and I thing isn't even a "hard limit" for me, just something I can't even imagine sexually. There would be zero arousal for me, which I assume would manage to deflate you pretty quickly. And even if I managed it, I would be terrible at it. So yeah, let's keep that as a little fantasy for your brain, keep it stocked in the bank for when I am too uncomfortable to do anything. However I would be willing to pamper her the way I pampered you the other night ... for YOU. I could paint the two of you to have matching toenails and the like. But being on the bottom of the Draco sandwich while you moan in my ear from being pegged? I could handle that!
After class, I was thankfully free from overly energetic babies, and so, had relaxed a bit. That said, I still ached and had this feeling like any little movement I made could potentially trigger her to start back up again. So, I promptly got into a nice warm bath and stayed there until Aya came and massaged me with her magic table that can accommodate the bump and take all pressure off my spine.
"Even so, I'm serious, we'll go home and tell the bloke flying our jet to come back for Dudley and Donna whenever they want.," I assured you.
"Vivi, my Princess, don't do this to yourself. Don't do this to your sister. Go apologize, tell her you trust her to know herself, and go giggle and make wedding plans together."
So while I am not an animal with no self control, I do hope that *eventually* we're all three comfortable with playing with others. For example, I understand that you are on team 'all the way gay' with Harry, but I do like the occasional woman. I just realized that I hadn't really talked about that before, no wonder it was a shock for you to see it. Even after Harry read emails to you describing me having women, you probably assumed that that was something I liked to do in the past, but stopped doing once I realized that men were more fun.
All of the students who didn't have permission to participate in the full ritual had their own, toned down version starting after lunch while the rest of the students had to attend the rest of their classes. For both versions, we started by leading the students to the apple trees and asking them to each pick one. This was a great time for them to practice their summoning charms. Once everyone had an apple - Macmillan, Susan Bones, Parvati Patil, Luna, and I helping those who hadn't mastered the charm yet - we led them to a large sunny area next to the Black Lake.
Since I had to go into the office today, and since Dean and Seamus wanted to have Dylan today/tonight, I decided to bring all three of them with me. After dropping Dylan off, I brought Gabriel and Morgana to the Auror Department with me. They were surprisingly well behaved, content to scribble on the walls of my office - I mean create art - as I had small progress update meetings with all of the Aurors on their respective cases.
Ok, on to the next idea, so you know how much I love wearing satin or lace or just pretty knickers for you. And I really like seeing all of your pale skin highlighted with shiny scraps of material. But, and again not on any sort of a regular basis, but do you remember that costume I wore at your birthday party? The harem outfit with all of the flowy veils? And then I wore that bit of kohl to darken my eyes. Well, seeing as you are attracted to both men and women, would you ever want to see me dressed a bit more femininely? Like with the knickers, but all the way? Stockings and heels and a slinky little dress. I would do that for you.
We love you!
"Is this REALLY you liking her, or is this simply a need to help someone you think needs your help?" I questioned.
Friday September 22, 2017
"It's the Hufflepuff thing, isn't it?" You correctly guessed.
And when I was brought to my knees by all of that - no! Literally on my stomach on the ground! As I was mentally laying on the ground in mental agony during a rather intense existential crisis, the two of you would pop up and ask me:
I had sort of the same idea actually. I bought you a solid gold pendant to dangle from your collar and property of Draco tag. As you already know, it's a tree. So far, the tree has two roots - one with my name on it and the other with yours - and three branches. Viona's name is on the biggest branch going almost straight up and off to the left. Orion is the slightly smaller branch going up and to the right, and the branch for the Demon is slightly smaller and to the left of Viona. The tree can be added to as our family grows.
I took three or four deep breaths, "He did, but I come and talk with you all the time, it's not like I only ever talk to you when there's been an incident."
So these wizards clubs are just an excuse for men to get together and drink without having to deal with their women? Barf. No thanks. The only thing going for it is they can get your favorite alcohol? A Malfoy can procure any good drink better than some fussy club owner, and then we could hang out and drink with our powerful women and not a bunch of boring old coots? Yeah, enjoy poker night if you ever choose to go with your father, but I'm good!
After breakfast, I spent a few hours with Leah, and the three littles that weren't sound asleep, working on signing. I think I'm getting the hang of it slowly but surely. It will take me a bit of time to really master it I'm sure, but we have a bit of time before our six month old is really communicating in full signing sentences anyway. She and I are learning together. Leah mentioned that the best way for me to become really fluent and comfortable is to sign as I speak even if Jaz isn't with me. Every time I say something that I have the BSL word for, I need to be using the sign.
The only other news I have for today is that I received an email back from a few of the squibs that I thought would be interested in running a daycare and the initial response is good. I've arranged it so they - and two witches from when I was interviewing assistants - will meet with me on Tuesday the 6th at 1PM at the Leaky. I have a feeling that this will be a little easier than opening a post office simply because they won't need to pick up and deliver packages all over the country. But we'll see. I'm currently thinking that a facility in Diagon Alley or right outside the Leaky in that area I'm having developed as muggle/wizard hybrid will work best to start with, and then possibly look for other areas that need wizarding child care.
"As far as we know, in our world Voldemort didn't create any children of his own, but even if he had we wouldn't care. Until we tested our Della against Rodolphus' DNA, we weren't really sure, and it didn't matter to any of us. She was our little queen and we loved her. You see that tall kid giving piggy back rides to the toddlers?"
Oh Fuck Harry! Oliver! What am I going to do?!
Hopefully Yours,
Sunday October 21st
So I had a glorious day of shopping with you, followed by a rush to catch up with our kids, and then a class to teach. Due to the time difference, it was a very long day, and so by rights, I should be dead to the world, but nope. I'm sitting in bed next to you, after having shagged you senseless, and I can't sleep.
Grinning, Oliver shifted until he was on top of me and giving me lots of delightful kisses. His hands were roaming my body and felt rather nice. A glorious ten or so minutes passed like this until he took hold of a certain part of my body that was poking him in the hip.
Wednesday September 1st
So, while they're doing their tour I figured I could come respond to your email.
Draco!!!! Oliver!!! We are getting married in twelve days! Twelve days! We're not going to be ready! We have so much to do. Decisions still need to be made. Last minute fittings and oh hell, what if the weather doesn't hold up? We're getting married in the woods, what if it's rainy and drippy and gross?
Saturday, December 16th
It didn't take long for Bellerophon to 'whisper' in Viona's ear: "What's the matter? Why is your dad acting like such an arsehole?" Side note, did my hearing get better, or do these kids honestly not know how to whisper?
"Oh love..." Pansy purred in sympathy even as Blaise grumbled something about Kisa making them disappear if she found out.
After the friend left, I was obviously alone with the pretty auburn red head with greenish brown eyes that had flecks of gold in them. She gave me a look that made it clear she thought I was being pathetic.
And there's the rage mood swing. Lovely to see you old friend.
"For the first time since Halloween, we're not truly worshipping the sun," Macmillan said.
The other bit of good news is that the hearing to determine if they actually need a full trial (or if they can perhaps dismiss the charges), is set for Thursday June 1st - thus after we get back from our Anniversary trip (which I am quite looking forward to). I made sure to sit Antonio down today as the rest of the kids were lugging all the instruments outside to play/jam in the sunshine and tell him that I have something important to me coming up. That we're going on a trip to celebrate our first anniversary, and that even though I'll be gone for a few days, it doesn't mean that I am abandoning him.
Intoxicate me now, with your loving now, I think I'm ready now,
Grandbaby. Not grandson or granddaughter … grandbaby. I say that because my Lainie-Girl hasn't announced the gender yet. She's planning on doing so tonight at the baby shower. But I'm currently listening to Viona ream Ethan a new arsehole. Not Elena because she has barricaded herself in her old room and refuses to speak to him. He had the bollocks to show up here before the shower so he could explain to her that it's probably not the best idea to do the gender reveal. You see, ETHAN thinks waiting to find out will make the reveal at birth that much sweeter. ETHAN thinks Elena won't want to deal with people having opinions one way or the other. ETHAN thinks that waiting to hear boy or girl at birth is "one of the best surprises in life" and Elena will really regret telling everyone tonight.
I've been so busy that I haven't even had time to flirt!
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
At least it's a place to start. And we all know she's brilliant enough to have your problem solved in three days flat! Also, she'll probably solve my problem while she's at it.
Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul - Boy I gotta watch my body 'cuz I'm not just anybody - 'cuz I really need somebody, tell me you're that somebody,
I'm leaving the Princess here while I go to lunch, I don't think she needs to see her Uncle Ron during one of his temper tantrums! I can't imagine it going too badly though. Hermione was going to tell him yesterday, and we didn't get Ron flooing in hysterically or a message from Hermione saying he freaked out and left, so the worst case scenario didn't happen. Maybe we'll barely have to talk about it and then I can just enjoy a nice lunch with Ron. Most of our circle is in and out of Unity or Traditions pretty regularly, but I don't see Ron very often at all.
So you lathered, scrubbed, and rinsed off every millimeter of my body, using your hands to ensure that absolutely no soap remained on my shaft nor any part of my privates. I let you have all the fun fondling me you wanted, honestly relaxing and enjoying every moment. Eventually, you were frustrated enough with the teasing of yourself that you helped me out of the tub and used a towel and your magic to dry me off completely without over-drying any part of me. As you did, you gave bits of my body kisses and tiny licks.
But, no, you must be right, only a monster would have left River with a trusted adult, to eat biscuits and milk with a group of children roughly his age, to work off your emotions in a safe environment. How do you sleep at night? You monster!
And the idea that I don't need the stress because I'm the one caring for Haz right now? Or while she was still at the clinic before we came home yesterday. Yeah, that was so hard. It was emotional for sure. But it was mostly her sleeping while I stared at her like an absolute creep. Honestly when you came in and they were talking about the dilators and said I had just stepped out for a coffee? She had kicked me out. I made the same argument, "I should know these things so I can make sure nothing goes wrong!"
So... I suppose that I need to work through my hang ups and detrimental core beliefs before I can truly answer that question, but... I think that I would react much in the same way that I reacted recently, and by that I mean sob out my hurt feelings to Harry and hope that he will go all Rage Halo over Draco on my behalf. My Mind Healer helped me to realize that I prefer to play the mediator, that even if I'm actually the one hurt, I'd rather have someone else fight my battles for me so that I can step in and make peace.
In any case, I opened my eyes all ready to go. I planned to lead his parents to his body so that they could bury him and be done with it. I HADN'T planned on you holding a hand to my head and frowning.
To be clear, I chose Laudanum in low doses because it is a substance that does not need to be taken regularly in order to work the way I want it to - such as the traditional potions need. You said it yourself that the potions you're on needed to be taken for about a month before they reached their full effects, and that you need to take them daily to continue the benefits. Even if Yesenia managed to prescribe me the exact perfect regimen for me on the first try with a minimum of side effects, I would still be depending on something else to control my emotions for me, and that really does horrify me.
But that wasn't my favorite part. Mine came just after that. We swapped again and I had my own "twin" to play with while you played with yours. Viper sat in the big cozy chair and made me ride him facing towards our husbands. The two of you seemed trapped in your own world. You kept swapping back and forth on who was topping. Sweaty pale skin rubbed against sweaty pale tattooed skin. Gorgeous hair, shining silver eyes, perfect cocks, it was an erotic vision dreams are made of.
Your tender love... Your warm embrace... your sweet kisses... I just can't get enough!
And speaking of for me .... are you going to tell me about Sunday? Or just leave me squirming in anticipation until then? Not cool! You know how I get!
Come and play with us!
Well, since we merged the Insta-owls with the Crystal Mobiles at some point, I think I'll just call him and talk about it. Hang on a few minutes and I'll tell you what I learn.
I can't wait to see who our little Serenity Blaise will be. Our Calm Fire. Honestly controlled fire is the best name if we want our child to be a reflection of the three of us.
Ms. Morgan finally came to a decision and held out the paper for me. I took it and read it over.
I sometimes WISH I was one of those, so happy with my gay marriage to my men that I never need the occasional fanny. But... hmm, I suppose that it's not a need so much as a strong desire, one that gets really rather distracting and annoying in its distraction when it's been a while. I start thinking about women and then fantasizing and then, well, begging I suppose.
She needs to be reminded constantly that her worth lies outside of her charms, and her happiness is wanted even if no one else ever benefits from it.
The flight should be plenty long enough that I could potentially have a long talk with the bigger kids the way you did while I was on my .... hunting trip. I'm sure you covered a lot of important areas, but even more important (to me) than ways to keep themselves safe is to make sure they know that they could fail to follow every single one of these plans and anything perpetrated against them would be zero percent their fault. I NEED my children to know that they could come home from an orgy, having been assaulted, and know that they will have complete love and understanding given to them.
Harry
My Sanity,
"See you later!" I called after them. Sebastian waved back at me. "Later Draco!"
Together,
As for our darling Eris, sigh... It seems that she's getting married on Saturday June 15th in Hawaii and all we can do is support her. I know it seems a bit sudden and a bit rushed, but didn't we nearly elope and give our mothers just a week to plan our wedding? I don't think we have room to talk.
He needed to be there for when Harry woke up -he needed to be the friendly face in a foreign land of white-washed walls and disinfectant.
change my mind." Without another word he pressed his mouth roughly against the blonde's and kissed him with a passion Draco hadn't known he'd possessed. He kissed back and pressed them both down into the mattress, the bed creaking as the touched one another as they kissed. Every touch was intoxicating and drove Harry mad; they were skin on skin, mouth on mouth, rutting gently.
"What do you get scared of, Harry?" the blonde man breathed gently as he splayed his hand over the naked, tan chest beneath him. A small part of him at the back of his mind told him that he didn't want to know and that he should be afraid of the answer, but he berated himself and told him that he was nearly fifty for goodness sake, if he kept running from things all his life he wouldn't get anywhere.
Once she even needed to cast a silencing spell over them at the abuse they hurled at one another. Most of it wasn't aimed at one another, it was simply to exhaust themselves and vent, but sometimes one or the other went too far and they wouldn't see one another for a couple of days.
Draco huffed, not even having the energy to roll his eyes. "You said ... no magic ... so you're ... cleaning up." Harry's jaw dropped. Draco smirked, smacking his wet thigh with his limp hand. "Get to it."
Harry felt itchy in his own skin as he gripped the bedrail tightly. He didn't know what he could say. What should he say? Everything seemed inappropriate. "Hi," he managed to breathe out, the silence cracking between them.
Draco was close to going mad. Every nerve was humming like a live wire through his muscles. He couldn't remember the last time he'd gotten such an adrenaline high from sex. Of course, sex with Harry was always amazing and left him burning long after they'd stopped, but this -was a whole new level! His heart was humming loudly in his chest, he was pretty sure he'd forgotten how to breathe.
He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. No, he wouldn't go back to the room. He had enough trouble sleeping and trying to avoid panic attacks whenever he walked by a classroom his aunt had destroyed or through the courtyard where Fenrir had slain his fair share of innocent children. He didn't need the burnt ruins of the room adding to those nightmares.
Stars flashed before Draco's eyes when Harry's head entered him. He clenched, making Harry hiss in pleasure, his strong hand gripping Draco's hips possessively. Draco felt both of their bodies quiver as he lowered himself until he had fully sheathed Harry's cock. He moaned, arching his back and gripping the table behind him.
That's how he found himself half an hour later placing his wand on the mantelpiece above the fireplace and striding out several paces away from Draco before turning back to face him. He had a weak protection charm on his body that hummed gently over him, but he still felt fear bubbling up in his stomach as the blonde straightened up to fix him with a firm stare. There was no hatred in his eyes; just something so haunting that it left Harry breathless. "I've asked the room to help protect me as best it can, so as soon as you even think of an unforgivable or anything like that, you'll get reported."
A cold, damp hand rested on Draco's, sending frosty spikes shooting up his arm. "I didn't stop off for a drink, Draco," he stated matter-of-factly, referring to Draco's earlier accusation, "You know that I didn't. I haven't for years so why would I suddenly go back there now?" he asked, his words getting harsher as he wore on.
"Why?" Draco hissed, "so that you can watch him sleep? If he gets away from this Hellhole of depression maybe he will feel more inclined to respond to the treatment!" He did not care that he was snapping at her. She needed to be told. Just because she had received training and a degree to work as a Healer did not mean that she was qualified to know what was best for Harry. The world of medicine developed every day, every hour, and humans were only JUST starting to understand the basics of it all.
Draco followed his vision of Harry's fingers to his wrist and then up the dampened curve of his forearm until his eyes drank in the squared jaw and the stubbled chin and the tired yet bright green eyes, "Perhaps sometimes I wish to have a quiet conversation with my husband, instead of worrying about whether or not Severus is asleep at this hour." Harry gave a fleeting smile before his eyes drifted to the fireplace, a hairline frown appearing on his features. The man came around the edge of the armchair. Draco pried an eyelid open to look up at the sodden man before him and sighed, "Go and get changed. You look a fright."
"Draco? Please eat something. You won't do yourself any favors if you just sit there staring into space," Hermione stated in a motherly tone. Draco ignored her. Just like he had been doing for the last five days. "Draco?" she tried again as she placed a cup of steaming tea on the coffee table in front of him. He did not even turn to look at her. "Please?" she tried in a soft whisper, a broken whisper, the voice of someone who was on the brink of giving up.
"Can be delivered via owl. Next?" The nurses' mouth opened and closed soundlessly. "Good. I shall be off then."
Harry looked up at Draco with a tired smile, "so what did Cass give you?" he asked softly, gesturing to the blue bag.
Wriggling closer to Draco he rested his head on the other boys' shoulder and hummed contently. He didn't want to move. Not yet. He was more than happy to sit on the stone balcony with Draco and bask in the silence of a burden finally lifting off his shoulders and ascending up in the night sky to settle among the stars.
As soon as they were in their room Harry collapsed backwards onto the bed, sighing loudly, and arms flared out on both sides. Draco gave a soft, loving smile before removing the container of hot chocolate and balancing it on the small shelf that also held their coffee mugs, kettle and cutlery. He grabbed the kettle and went into the bathroom to fill it up. He quickly put the kettle on the boil and turned his attention back to Harry. The younger man looked exhausted. Draco twitched his mouth and lowered himself to his knees at the foot of the bed and busied himself with untying Harry's shoes.
I was thinking that tomorrow - which would be tonight by the time you read this - we should go to an actual place to eat dinner. Pick any restaurant - muggle or wizarding - and I'll bring you there and pay. Let me know if you need me to obtain a quick Portkey to France, Spain, or Italy. Actually, as much as I do love French Cuisine, I also rather enjoy Japanese food and some Ethiopian food - the less spicier things. India is always good for Tandoori - again when not so spicy. I'm probably a wimp when it comes to spice, but I prefer to taste things, and spicy food usually just numbs my tongue, makes me cough, and then I don't taste any of the other flavors in the food. Such as the food. Anyway, we could Portkey to anywhere in the world for dinner, but obviously, places with a significant time difference will need a lot more advance planning for a quick dinner trip and back than the closer European places.
It seems I have permission to have my wicked way with you while you're sleeping. Be prepared to never sleep again! Haha...
*Deep breathing*
You were grinning like a fool at that point, but still feeling a bit raw, because you stopped me from going on by kissing me again. Then you linked arms with me and said: "Where's the nearest place we can get out of here?" By which I knew you meant Apparate all the way home.
You're the one that I want,
Sunday July 26th
She looked up in surprise and frowned in concern. "Is something wrong?"
I think that part of Robards' problem was that he liked to be not just a supervisor, but something of a silent partner to all his Aurors. Thus, let's say Bletchley was working on a murder case, or a missing child case - or a better and actually currently real example of Ginger trying to dig up evidence on Kevin Miller - Robards would not just have them come to him in his office and report what they know on the case as they made progress, but he'd ALSO work the case from his office in case he could come up with insights and perspectives they couldn't.
Now, come on and wake up. Come run away with me. To our honeymoon and our forever.
Okay, we'll talk about it later, think about it! But first, prepare to get your world ROCKED!
Harry is boggled, Oliver is upset, and Draco is taking the kids to the park.
Draco
Elena hugged me - careful not to squish Orion or Viona - and babbled excitedly. "I showed Kisa my old room and she couldn't believe I had to share a place so tiny with other kids!"
Yes, we have to/get to go out on dates. I would love to start with the movies. I would like to see either The Mummy which is an action/fantasy film set in Egypt in the 1920's, or The World is Not Enough, which is a spy movie. I can look for other films if neither of those sound appealing to you. We could go out to dinner either before or after if you'd like. A very traditional date is "dinner and a movie" so that would be great.
Which just left Eri and Ori - who are only five months and not able to go trampling through some cake yet - and Rod and Bianca - who are about two weeks older and *also* not old enough to play in a cake. Plus Daisy, who's just a little older and not quite able to crawl yet. Lucky for us! Can you imagine if ALL FIFTEEN of them were messy wrecks by the time they were done?! Oi… Although, eleven messy wrecks really isn't too different from fifteen, I suppose.
Speaking of souvenirs, I found a little gold pendant shaped like Italy to add to our collection.
Harry has a free evening and Draco finally has a chance to confront Orion.
Monday June 5th
Greetings from beautiful sunny Maldives!
"Harry!" They cried out in extremely relieved joy, swarming you to hug you tight. "What happened?"
I shook my head. "No luv, it's not. I promise you that I honestly and truly don't want any of this from you. Even if I DID let you guilt me into doing something like this so you could 'properly thank' me, I wouldn't enjoy it, I'd feel like a monster afterwards, and your goal of thanking me would not be achieved. Trust me, if you truly want to thank me, then do so by being happy."
Oliver Wood
So, after having read your email, Oliver and I went to the Crystal Room to shatter crystal with you. The room itself is self perpetuating, which means that it starts out with a large amount of perfect crystal in all shapes and sizes for one too throw about in a rage, and after that has all been thrown - which usually takes a while - or after a reasonable amount of time if it isn't all thrown, it will regenerate all that crystal so that it's ready for the next time.
Dearest Harry,
OH WAIT!!! I nearly forgot, one of the reasons that we've both been slacking off on writing emails this past week is that the Tiger and his crew were here. Viper had popped off from Japan to return here at his designated time to go get them. Then they were here with just my parents and siblings until we officially got back.
May 13, 2000
No one needs you to get to the point where you've been able to make a ministry official cry. If he's been able to work with Hermione without breaking down but you broke him? I would be willing to bet you'd gone to extreme levels of tantrum that maybe even I haven't seen before. You started a brawl over tea? I think we should have you pensieve that moment so we can bring it out the next time someone suggests you get up early for a week straight.
I think Julia got a picture of when I ordered Ginny to lay on her back and spread her legs wide and simply wait for me to decide what if anything I wanted to do to her. The catch was that she had to submit to a blindfold spell. Her breathing got interestingly ragged as I hummed in thought and traced a finger lightly over her body. Then I decided to insert my fingers inside her and stimulate her to a gushing orgasm. A *screaming* gushing orgasm.
Well, obviously it's more than a booty call. He seems to really adore his Draco. I'm glad, maybe he'll keep his grubby little hands off of mine! I'm so pleased that he is stupid enough to not realize you're the best lay of his life. Dumbass. But I totally get where other Draco was worried he was just being messed with. That's how I felt when we were first talking to each other. Like I had to be so careful because if I let it slip how long I had fancied you, if I let myself fall even harder for you, how terribly it would hurt when I found you were just messing with me.
Yeah, Oliver and I definitely won the lottery getting you as our husband. You'd think we were still horny little teenagers with how often we need to shag each other. Honestly, we're either forty-something or nearing our forties, we each have two husbands to keep physically satisfied, and we shag multiple times per day. Every telly program, movie, and article I've ever read makes it sound as though once you've been in a relationship with the same person for long enough the spark goes away and sex becomes less important - or if not less important it becomes less often. And here we are still wanting each other as much as we did the day we married.
See, what we had forgotten was that it was one of the nights in which my siblings were planning to come home for the weekend. We were all sitting at the long formal dining table - since it was just about the only way we were going to fit all of us at the same table - when the clock chimed six and my parents stood up to stand by the fireplace. I stood next to them.
I'm quite looking forward to this ritual. It's naturally on a Saturday so we don't have to feel bad about keeping the kids up later than usual on say a Tuesday night, knowing that they have classes the next day. But also, just being able to see what Elena and her crew do for the class portion of it. It sounds like they've come up with a way to incorporate the concept of trick or treat by basically having volunteers or groups of volunteers decorate some of the classrooms so that students can go from room to room and interact with them for treats.
"Escort me to my seat?" I asked with a pretty pout.
Once they were satisfied that we were honest about being in a good place, that's when it turned from an inquisition to a roast. They did impressions of us Draco! Our friends, our best friends, Godparents to many of our children, business partners, they had these impressions in their pockets! And you know they weren't the first time they'd been performed.
No. No we don't.
That's when Lainie started sniffling. "Hearing someone else say it like that. It's just... I wish my first dad could be here to meet his little namesake."
She brought enough food for a couple of days of light eating - mostly sandwich meat, bread, and bags of crisps. That said, she's not eating very much and seems to be working herself into actually doing it.
"WHY SO MANY???" Erma blurted out in shock.
Tuesday May 25th
But then again, not my marriage, not my business. If it were my marriage, I would say something. As sexy as I find the idea of just sitting under your desk, either by myself or with Ollie, to keep you satisfied, I hate the idea that I would need to because I otherwise wasn't seeing you.
My Adorably Ridiculous Love,
Saturday June 15th
I silently let him play out an interesting scene in his mind in which he sacrificed himself for her so that she could escape danger. I suppose he doesn't realize that our girl can actually protect herself and - more importantly - is smart enough to avoid such situations. In any case, he has my stamp of approval.
"They're dead too. All you have left in the world is me, but don't worry, I shall take good care of you."
Before we could get too lost in conversation, our kids practically pushed us out of our suite. Dinner was as lively as ever, with a rousing debate on several subjects. My mother wisely offered to watch a movie or two with the kids before tucking them into bed later. This gave us no reason NOT to retire directly to our playroom after dinner was finished.
Oh my Draco,
Oh My Loves, I know it breaks your heart that Ree isn't ready to let you hold her often. For so many reasons. Because you know why she's fearful and it makes you sad for our little girl. Because you know why she's fearful and it makes you furious towards the monsters. And because I know you both love her and want to get to know your newest child. You want to bond with her. Ollie you want to introduce her to the stables and take her on a broom ride. Draco you want to dance with her. And she isn't ready for any of that.
Oh fuck me, that was hot.
But my libido is back and I don't think it wants to wait until tonight, I think I'm going to go find you and drag you to the nearest cupboard and have you thoroughly violate me.
Hurry home,
Feels so good being bad, there's no way I'm turning back... 'Cuz I may bad but I'm perfectly good at it, sex in the air, I don't care I love the smell of it, sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me,
When I recently downsized a bit, you were worried that without my businesses, I would have nothing, but the truth is that I do so little for my businesses that even with them, at this moment, I feel like I have nothing to do. Think about it, only when I am buying or helping to start or fixing an emergency do I ever really need to do more for a business than attend a meeting once every three months.
I raised a brow. "Another bar... or a spa?"
So, since you were missing and it seemed that time might be of the essence, I immediately went into your office and firecalled Minister Shacklebolt. I barely had to read the letter to him and he was already ordering his secretary to liaison with the muggle hospital and any agency necessary. At the same time, he issued me paperwork designating me the temporary caregiver so that I may go check up on this baby and make sure that all his needs are being met.
But the good news is he had already started setting aside instruments for your usual annual order.
The human and marmoset in me completely understands this - she needs to eat - but the tiny part of my brain that is still obsessed with ants can't help but be horrified and distraught at all the egregious ant murders taking place right in front of me!
And it got us to a place where we could find Gorman to save Harrison. Again, wouldn't have changed that for anything.
P.S. If I ever get my hands on Fate, I'm MURDERING her!!!
Around ten or twenty minutes later, we had our brood in hand. Ten or twenty minutes after that, we finished saying our goodbyes and passing out hugs. About an hour after we decided to come home, we finally managed it, our arms full of excellent food made by Molly because she was certain we haven't been eating enough lately. I literally could not assure her that we have, even though we have!
I think it helps that Draco and I married young and Oliver was starting out a new phase of his adult life. We didn't live alone as single adults for many years before we all got together. As we grew and changed, we built our lives around each other. Tiger had many many years of having no one and nothing to answer to but himself. Sometimes, hearing about their lives, I think Tiger still acts too much like a bachelor.
And now, I am dead certain that Eric realizes that Eris can defend herself if necessary, which is useful information to know if he was even slightly planning anything. But that said, they are getting on surprisingly well. I wouldn't think two literal strangers could work together so well to co-raise their baby, but it's like you said, I should REALLY stop being so surprised by fate.
After we arrived at the Russian Ministry and were settled in, we had a few hours of going over every detail at length. See, on Wednesday, I'd basically given an overview - a very long overview - but I didn't want to overwhelm them with information. So, now that they've had a few days to think it over, they realized that they wanted to know the specifics. Once they were satisfied that they knew all the details, they told me that they needed until at least Tuesday or Wednesday to think it over.
But now we're all three on the plane to Amsterdam for our weekend away! I'm already a bit hysterical worrying about our babies. But I think the adults and the elves are well aware of how much we meant what we said about bringing us the babies if there were any issues. I'd rather be disturbed on our weekend away than miss something important we're needed for!
So... heh heh heh...
Monday September 3rd
I guess this is apparently a good tactic as it worked. I had a LOT of women trying to chat me up before I finally figured out what they were doing. THAT'S when I turned the tables on them.
-Are we doing a Kids friendly Halloween party again this year (please please please?)
OOO!!! I think I felt a contraction!!! ….. ….. ….. DAMNIT! No... just a bit of gas... sigh...
Yeah, there is a weird spell on the house, or on you, or on the kitchen itself ... I'm not completely sure how it works ... but the very memory of the location of the kitchens is charmed to not stay in your head. Bloody elitist, sexist, pureblooded morons.
But then again, it might be worth a try...
I don't miss you because you are finally back in our bed where you belong! You were cleared of being contagious this morning, Jaz was cleared Saturday, and Zaire yesterday. Finally, I would get to talk to you and tell you all about my week without you. I could tell you all the silly side effects the littles had. I could hear all about what happened when you erm nevermind'ed. But you climbed into bed with me and promptly fell asleep!
If you're confused about Draco calling Oliver's ex-in-laws a very rude name, keep in mind that he did try to refer to them semi-respectfully until they broke the camel's back in his mind by plotting to murder Oliver. And Oliver knows that Draco has started referring to them as such, and is a bit hurt by it, but hasn't said anything because he feels that Draco's rudeness is motivated by concern for him, and so, it would be a bit petty to get upset about it.
As for me, I have lived long enough to know for certain that Malfoy Manor will *always* be here for me. That it will not shatter into a million pieces if I decide to go away for several months at a time - otherwise going to Hogwarts would have been disastrous *years* ago! Thus, I have no need to fearfully cling to my home as the only place in the world for me. I know I can go out and help you spread your heart and soul around the world for a year - or even several years if it ends up taking that long - and still have a home to come back to when you're done.
In case you were wondering, at five and six years old, Zwei and Siri will still allow me to wake them up on their birthdays singing Happy Birthday! It may have helped that I was carrying a tray of pancakes with candles in them.
P.S. I think McGonagall's concern that prompted her to ask me to sponsor Miles with a tutor is that while Traditions is currently providing an excellent education to Squib children, it's not exactly set up to offer N.E.W.T. level classes to a Sixth Year Hogwarts student, and so, he'd need someone that could teach him potions and advanced charms and the like.
Since we were too worried before our appointment with Rowe yesterday to really do much talking, I figured I would let you know how the party planning went.
First of all, we are so proud of you! Even though we have missed you like crazy, we're in awe of your ability to drop everything and help kids that need you. It's definitely one of the reasons I fell in love with you. Oliver still maintains that it was your fantastic Quidditch Skills that snagged him, but I think we all know that it was your love for kids that healed his wounded heart not so long ago.
The weird thing is that I keep dreaming about this little girl. She's about the same age as Siri and Zwei, has long blonde hair and green eyes, and seems to be running joyously all around a meadow. I'm really hoping that this girl is simply lost and using a bit of magical help to call out to me. I would HATE for this girl to be kidnapped or even dead already and suddenly sending me dreams of what happened because it's Halloween and the veil between the worlds is thin enough to allow for easier communication.
I reached over (now that Jaz was 'helping' me demolish the food on my plate. As was Zwei) and took your hand in mine. Since you couldn't kiss me, you kissed Zaire, and then Siri, who was half trying to sit in your lap too. Our boys must still ask for Elena to sing this to them from time to time, because they were able to join in too.
Yours,
Love,
I dropped my head into the palm of my hand, already having a strong feeling of dread as to where this was going.
This gave Eris and Oliver a chance to introduce Serenity, who is mild mannered and adorable and had no problem with Lubanzi holding her. Except that this made Rita visibly anxious to anyone who happened to be looking at her. Lubanzi was smiling at Serenity.
My Heart,
When Trey came into our lives, he called me Daddy and you Papa. I didn’t think anything of it. Until much later after Nora Madeline came into our lives. And even a while after when her speech went from toddler babble to full sentences, she still called me Daddy.
But you really don't have to thank me. You are my first priority at all times. I would do ANYTHING to keep you safe and healthy.
I love you, but do you still think I’m a moron? Do you think there’s a chance I would put any of our babies on it unless I had charmed it, them, and the surrounding area with every safety charm I can manage? Between the two of us who is the mother hen? Which one of us does Vivi STILL call Mumdah if she’s sleepy or not feeling well? You utter prat.
With this little cobweb potion, you'll fall into dark devotion,
-	Age 5
I'm a tiny bit exhausted.
If this guest wishes, they could probably stay in that cottage for the rest of their lives without ever saying a word to us, and we likely wouldn't notice aside from seeing a light if we cared to look while out hunting with the owls.
Draco
Friday February 16th
So now, I have a device that is about 15cm by 10cm that can do everything an Insta-owl can do, everything the Crystal Mobiles could do, AND everything the Magitablet can do. Keep in mind that we'd programmed the Magitables to be able to do everything our laptops can do, so basically, I've just created a single device with the power of a God, haha.
Friday June 2nd
But speaking of Love Stage, I know you don't like Anime - Harry - but Oliver, would you be interested in watching it with me? It's about an 18 year old aspiring manga artist who once starred as an adorable flower girl in a commercial, and now 10 years later is asked to come back for a reunion commercial in which he's now the bride. The problem is that the first experience traumatized him a bit, and so, he's not exactly willing to do a second one. Even so, his big brother bribes him rather brilliantly and he agrees.
Hornily yours,
That round little pudgy face, big intelligent brown eyes watching the whole thing play out. Those same brown eyes I got to stare into earlier today as she screamed her son into the world. Those same brown eyes I saw in miniature when little Vincent stared up at me. Our baby girl is a Mama. A fierce mama bear that will wrangle the world into exactly the place she wants her son to grow up in.
Saturday September 30th
But there is one more thing I want to say before I sign off, and that's: I did as you asked in your email, picturing myself in Hannah's place as YOU were in my place, and I still don't think I would have called Grandmama. That I would have known with all certainty that calling her is a death sentence, and a particularly nasty one at that. Instead, I would have force fed a lust potion to the person who DARED to touch what is mine - because even though I have a sharing kink, I do have limits, and this is one of them. After she (or he, it could easily be a man too) was desperately begging to be buggered by everyone in the city, I would have brought her to a place I know of where the patrons like to be violent. VERY violent. I would have handed her over, letting them know that she likes it rough, and then I would have watched just enough to know for certain that she was being brutalized. Then I would have left because I don't want to see that and risk remembering details of what had happened to me once upon a time ago.
Which he could not do. It took us a solid five minutes to figure out a plan to get him out of your clutches. And it was so hilarious because every time we'd move your arm, you'd wrap your leg, or the other arm. At one point, you even hooked your chin over his shoulder. It set me off into a fit of giggles, unfortunately. For Oliver, who still needed to use the facilities. I was a bit worried we were going to have a bed-wetting situation if he hadn't gotten free when he did. (I forgot about the emptying charms until he was well into his morning routine.
Harry
P.S. Looks like I'm going to have to get reacquainted with my right hand as well!
And, this is in no way disparaging of Hermione because she would also do a fantastic job ... but she has not spent the last almost twenty years trying to better Wizarding Britain. Alright, it could be argued that you haven't spent almost twenty years either, since we lived throughout the globe for quite a few of those years. But you have a solid decade of building your life, building your businesses, and building your family in the very country you want to help lead. You created a Muggle/Wizarding area of London/Diagon Alley to make the shopping process easier for Muggleborns and to help build businesses for the better of society.
As a small detour to my recap, I just wanted state for the record how proud of Siri I am. He's been running with me every chance he gets, and so we've spent a bit of time together (along with Zwei). I feel so bad about being so very driven and caught up in my own shite that I was literally undercover when Siri had his very first professional Quidditch match. He's been so gracious and understanding, NOT holding it against me in the slightest. He has given me a play by play account on more than one occasion, and while he's disappointed that his team didn't win that match outright, he's excited that they earned enough points overall to keep them in the running. His next match in mid-April shouldn't interfere with ANYTHING on our calendar, and so, barring another unexpected undercover mission, I should be there to cheer him on.
This made Delphini sigh wistfully. "I wish Della and Viona could have been here at the very least."
After practically every moment of our time at the Water Park was rehashed for my parents' enjoyment, the conversation turned to various interests. Orion reported that his Macadamias were selling very well, that demand continued to be rather high. Viona and her sisters spent at least twenty minutes giving us all a detailed report of Hazeris' continued smashing success. Elena waxed nearly poetic about her school and how she already had a core group of students that were serious enough that they'd probably stay with the school for the next few years at least.
AHHHH.... This was my favorite class yet. I look forward to making this a standard part of my class each time I have a new set of students who think they're making good progress. Which - by the way - is an EXCELLENT reason to give our tinys that age freezing potion. That way, they'll ALWAYS be these tiny little pixies that don't look like they should be able to break a sweat, much less an arm.
Muffy squeaked, babbling something so fast I couldn't understand her. Pippa pulled her out of my hands and smacked me up the backside of my head.
Ooh, bring all our kids who came by too! I think everyone would love to hear Shtara sing! I mean honestly, is there anyone on the planet who wouldn’t want to hear her sing?
This brought a small smile to Harry's lips. “While Viona was still a baby, we apparently decided to get pregnant. BOTH of us. You carried Eris and I carried Orion. Eris is petite with black hair like me while Orion is tall and blond and gorgeous like you. They're 9 – as is Hazel. Her back story is complicated. She was created during an accident when a pair of criminals used some altered Polyjuice and a hair they stole from me. Haz was taken from them when they were captured and sent to Azkaban – and the funniest thing was that they didn't realize that Haz had some of my DNA, they simply thought it was coincidence that he looked like me, so they called him Harrison – Harry's son.”
"I think that could be rather interesting," I agreed, gesturing to the 'dark room' where all sexual acts were supposed to take place. We relocated and then she grabbed her husband by his chocolate brown hair and looked him fiercely in the eye. It was a bit amusing to see a man at least as tall as I am and built like a linebacker cower and look genuinely afraid of what that petite little woman might do to him if he disobeyed her.
I suppose it's a bit like defragmenting a computer.
Oliver, I know you don't understand the playing thing, and when you talk with Harry about it, the conversation usually goes something like Harry saying: "I honestly wouldn't ever play if it didn't meet some of Draco's needs," which probably makes you feel like my needs are at diametrically opposing ends than yours - and that eventually, one of us will have to give. But I can assure you that I've learned very very well that marriage is about compromise.
I smiled at him. "I - for one - am extremely grateful that we have these spells."
Do you suppose she's already... No actually, I REALLY don't want to know!
Ugh I hate that you had the day you had yesterday. I want to let you sleep that off for days. But I do NOT want you to miss this event!
You chuckled, Harry. "He's over at Unity House, helping out with nearly last minute preparations."
3 - Continue consulting for the Aurors. The option you argue against the most.
So, I think I know everything I need to know. No wait, let me rephrase that. I now know things I guess I didn't really want to know. Or wait, I guess I did want to know them because I'm curious and a bit of a snoopy bastard. The important part is that I now know things that I didn't know before.
You came closer than usual in figuring out the meaning behind my anger. It was the lying and the lying by omission that truly hurt me. Not that actual actions during the sting operation.

"So... you're making dinner then?" Necklace asked hopefully.
Friday May 17th
Meanwhile, everyone else decided whether they wanted to drum or dance. Things got just a little wild fairly quickly, but not *too* wild. They were able to maintain the propriety and respect expected of them while dancing naked and playing with fire like hooligans. We all had lots of fun.
(See the end of the chapter for
Yesenia chuckled. "As good as it is to give the Kids a healthy example of a loving relationship, some of them are glaring at you as if they're going to come over here and knock you off your feet."
"WHY WAIT YEARS WHEN THAT'S SUCH A WASTE OF TIME?!" Farrah blurted out ardently.
And now that I've recapped my day, I feel like I can sleep. Good night my beautiful little mutt,
Pippa, as capable and competent as ever, managed to rent us a large mansion in the wealthier area of Kermanshah - the capital city in the province of Kermanshah, Iran. We chose it all those years ago (the province of Kermanshah) because it was on the border of Iraq and had one of the 10 most populated cities in all of Iran in the province in case we needed things that just couldn't be found in smaller cities or towns. Or middles of nowhere.
I'm currently in the Crystal Room, where I went to finish venting when I realized that I had turned into full blown Hurricane Draco and was beginning to take it out on you and Oliver. The good news is that I smashed enough Crystal to feel better, so I'm going to sign off and go apologize to you in every way the two of you want. I think maybe starting on my knees, what do you think?"
I was extremely manly and composed as I calmly agreed. Alright fine! So I was drunk and NOT in control of my emotions as I bawled and wailed, hugging her and stroking her, erm… back. I am pretty sure the word yes came out at some point, because she started sobbing and hugging me all over again. I'm dead certain one of our daughters - probably the pregnant (and thus sober) one, took plenty of pictures of the highly undignified moment, so you'll be able to see it for yourself.
Then - once Finnegan realized that the girl was actually Miles - he got upset and said it wasn't fair that he had to share a dorm with a boy who was gay and wanted to be a girl. That Miles should have to share a dorm with the rest of the girls. Things like that. And so, if you haven't heard, Finnegan at the very least is not happy about their dorm situation. Although, I would not be surprised if Finnegan went straight to you to complain, or maybe he stalked off to his second dorm at Traditions.
You took the words right out of my mouth, it must have been while you were kissing me,
Important thing number one: I want to do it and I was feeling a bit angry all of a sudden that I needed to ask for permission. Important fact number two: OF COURSE I need to ask for permission because this could involve some potentially huge things that we're already still half fighting about.
"I think I more or less already knew all of this," Oliver said, frowning slightly again. "Harry's been open and honest about his feelings. It's YOU I have a harder time reading."
4. Tile Fish Dumpling in Clear Soup
I gave him a suspicious look. "Did.... Did Harry DO something to you?"
Deciding to play it safe in case you weren't fully recovered, I decided to wake you in one of my favorite ways when you do it to me. Taking your shaft in hand, I worked you up. My mouth joined in on the fun when you were about half mast. You moaned very softly a few times, but didn't wake up as I did my best to make your toes curl. One of my hands wandered toward your tight pucker, but I didn't finger you for one very important reason...
Harry smirked knowingly, "Don't let my appearances fool you. I was so excited that day I'd been awake long before dawn. I was pacing back and forth everywhere until Severus told me to go out into the garden and he would call me in when you had arrived, but then you and your parents went to take a nap and I didn't see you until later that day. You had honestly looked so handsome," he stated as he looked over at Draco who, although travel-weary with bloodshot eyes, still sent the blood pumping through his veins. He let his mind wander momentarily back to that summer when Draco had followed his parents into the conservatory; he had looked immaculate as ever, like the night they had first met in the hotel function room in Paris, and although he looked a little thinner than beforehand, Harry couldn't help but smile as wide as he had.
Oliver, if you're reading, I'm not NOT including you, I just am a bit in shock, so...
I can't wait to see Ollie's features in miniature ....
I told them about my dreams. In detail. Apparently the detail of having a few of the lower ribs removed hadn't made it into the official file yet because that hadn't been discovered until the Autopsy, and so Hannah didn't know about it and her boss had only *just* found out. At first, that made me the most likely suspect, but since the actual murder took place after my dream - while I was conducting the Halloween ritual at Hogwarts with thousands of people who could confirm my whereabouts - I went from suspect to legitimate 'seer' in about 5 minutes. Which was how long it took for me to Insta-owl Robards and have him send along an official alibi on Ministry stationary. The muggle police don't know exactly what the Ministry is, but they know that it's a high ranking secret part of the government, and so, I was well and truly vouched for.
Another thing that came up in my talk with Miles is that he feels a bit guilty. See, he took the potion and got up the duff on purpose, but he hadn't really intended to tell his boyfriend the truth unless he had to. He was just going to keep the pregnancy a secret forever - if possible - and then raise the baby on his own. He really feels that his boyfriend will feel like strangling him if he ever finds out. That said, Miles had promised to see him during holidays and at rituals if he could convince me to bring him with me, and so, he's now feeling rather guilty about agreeing to go to Africa with us and would like a chance to tell his boyfriend that in person. Thus, I'm going to sign off and bring him to Hogwarts for a bit since dinner is about to be served and he should be able to have said chat in the Great Hall.
Don't worry about Viona being jealous of Jaz. A little jealousy between siblings is normal, we have enough kids to know that! But she has Viona wrapped so thoroughly around those tiny fingers it's not even funny. She honestly reminds me of Lainie at that age, Jasmine is her baby and nothing we could say would make her think differently. It's probably a good thing we made the choice to adopt her or Viona would have just smuggled her home in one of her trunks.
"Please!" He cried out a bit fervently.
Plus, I'm actually sort of curious to see what I ACTUALLY would look like as a woman. Also note that it's designed to be temporary, so, wouldn't have been a good longterm solution to Hazel's desires, even if we HAD known about it before now.
Harry Potter - Malfoy
You will see
And I just got to listen to Teddy regale me with some story about .... something. I don't think he took a single breath! I have no idea what he was talking about, but I am sure I heard the word Dragon a few times.
Don't worry, she definitely loves you, you're her first nephew. She made sure to have us messaged immediately, I told you about the birth, and then I sent our congratulations and a gift. Actually I think tomorrow we should try to have a magi-skype date so we can meet little Aleksei. I'm getting so antsy for babies. I want to snuggle and smooch little Aleksei and I can't wait to snuggle and smooch our grandchildren!
Hey there Sexy McHotAss,
So, medically speaking, the potion Rowe added on Wednesday during her tweak to the regimen is likely the culprit. She said that particular one is very polarizing, it either really helps or it makes things worse, no in between. It's why she added such a low dose to begin with. Since we are all so particular about documenting his seizures, we caught it quickly enough that he may have another extended seizure or two in the next few days while it works out of his system, but it won't cause any lasting damage.
Hermione sighed and gracefully into the armchair adjacent to the sofa. She ran a hand through her curly hair and sighed, her tired brown eyes glittering with tears. "Draco, please, let someone help you? You don't want Harry to come home to you making yourself ill, do you?"
Little did he know, that's exactly what was happening to Harry. Every. Single. Night.
"And how would one go about doing such a thing as to ease this mild infliction on his mind?"
left and returned to his own room, still wearing Draco's nightshirt.
"I did miss you, you know?" Draco finally muttered softly, as he looked up to find Harry watching him intently, "I just didn't know if I was allowed to after … everything."
With her threat hanging like a black cloud in the air over their heads, she turned on her heel and briskly stalked from the room. They both listened to the clicking of her heels on the hardwood floorboards. The roar of the floo network opening and closing as Hermione left their apartment, made them both sigh with relief.
Thankfully, the Sorting Ceremony was over rather quickly, welcoming the old and new students back and introducing Professor McGonagall as the headmistress, Slughorn had returned to teach potions and there was now a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who he couldn't be bothered remembering the name of. When the good appeared he picked at it and sipped at his pumpkin juice but barely ate anything. He was emotionally starved but his appetite for food had diminished almost entirely.
"Here?" he rasped out, "Why?"
"The nurse said you're too weak to go out at the moment," Draco breathed, refusing to look Harry in the eye. He loathed himself for having to deny Harry this mild form of happiness. It broke his heart to deny his lover the chance of sun-kissed happiness. He touched Harry's knuckles with his fingertips, the silence swelling up in the atmosphere around them.
Draco had once pleaded with Harry –as much as a Malfoy would plead anyway –for the brunette man to take him back to Calais with him to see the place where he worked and where he lived. He said he wanted to know and see everything about Harry's life and be able to envision things happening during the time where his companion was away studying. Harry had insisted it was nothing special, even going as far as to say that the air in Calais would harm Draco's progress, which had angered the blonde into ignoring him for a full two hours. It stung Harry deep down but he merely feigned disinterest, instead spending the quiet down-time to read through his assignment to make sure it was coherent for the board. Eventually the silence had grown too much for Draco and he snapped that they were being stupid little brats, and thus their argument was forgotten for the most part.
"Yes," Blaise replied slowly, "He is also barely eating and looks as though his eyes are going to burn a hole through the table. Go over there and take him outside. You might as well."
A jolt shot up his spine. Children. It was a subject he had side-stepped when they had eventually adopted Seeker, and it had not been mentioned since. He was not even sure if Harry wanted children anymore. He watched the small bubbles floating downwards in the air and drew in a deep breath -and stopped short. He could not ask Harry that. Not now, at least. First he needed to focus on a weekend away in the sunshine for the both of them.
"Harry-"
Harry leaned over him, his tan skin a soft caramel colour in the glow of the candles. His eyes were almost swallowed my his pupils and he was already breathing deeply. He leaned back completely, unfastened his trousers and slid out of them. Stroking his hands up Draco's legs made the blonde man quiver; having soft fingers brush through the fine blonde hairs up his shin was oddly ... arousing.
"You're not becoming delirious as well, I hope?" Harry hedged his voice as wondrous and flooded with concern as it had been a few months ago when they had first met at the function in central Paris. Draco watched as Harry edged around his bed and settled himself in the chair that had been pulled up to the side of Draco's bed by his mother a few days before. He watched as Harry sat down and propped his briefcase up against the ornate bedside table and leaned over so that he could study Draco a little closer. "You're looking far too pale, have you been eating?"
Harry hummed, listening to the dulling thud of the blonde's heart. "Did you like it?" It had been the question on his mind throughout the majority of the evening, not wanting to jinx the moment.
Harry wanted to protest, but his words died in his throat as Draco shot him a pointed look. It was true, even he had to grudgingly admit to it. His face fell and he dropped his chin to his chest as he tried to relax his tense shoulders. "Yeah I guess you're right. I only came back here because I was sure that there was something I hadn't learned yet, or that it would fill my time before I managed to go off into the world."
Whilst he waited in the oppressive reception area to be guided through along the maze of corridors, he stuffed his hands into his pockets and drew out his bus ticket. He had not wanted to touch the portkey sitting on the kitchen counter -that was for emergencies only. He ground his teeth together and began folding the edges into one another. He had been fascinated by the origami birds Hermione liked to make when it was a girls' night in, so he had asked her to teach him. She had gladly accepted the challenge, and soon Draco sound himself making origami cranes with any small amounts of paper he could find. Including bus tickets.
"If I tell you the reasons why I've been avoiding Draco to such great lengths you won't even think me human, Severus," Harry murmured darkly, his pupils dilating as sleep tickled at the recesses of his mind.
"Tyrant?" Lucius supplied with his usual dry chuckle, "Of course I am aware of the rumours and what they print in the papers. However, where my son is concerned I will do as much as I can to make sure he is comfortable. Even if it is for a short amount of time." He eyed Harry's obvious discomfort before sighing, "If you wish for me to convince Severus I don't mind taking on that task, but I would like you to agree first, otherwise there is no point for me to do so."
A the brunettes confusion, Draco turned to her with a furrowed brow, "you didn't know?" he asked quietly. She shook her head. He let out a harsh bark of mirthless laughter that made Hermione flinch in her chair. "Typical. There always shutting me out of his life. I wouldn't be surprised if Harry died here and now and I'd have to wait to read his obituary in the Daily Prophet."
"Does he seem any different?" Blaise asked Pansy that evening over dinner. Draco hadn't come up for dinner yet, choosing to mill about in the dorms for a while doing Merlin knew what.
"I don't want to think of a life without you," came the soft whisper much later that evening as the dusk rolled up over the ocean and the sun had vanished from the air. They must have dozed off because when they woke up Draco had a stiff crick in his neck and was spooning Harry, his arm wrapped tightly around the brunettes waist. Harry shifted in his arms as he breathed the words into his ear. "I honestly don't think I can -how can I live without Harry Potter?" the words were soft and wrought, emotionally exhausted from all the crying. Harry tightened his hand over Draco's fingers.
The train creaked along the rails and with a cursory glance out of the window; Draco noted that he was only two stations away from where he needed to climb off. He couldn't wait to get home to the warmth that he hoped would be welcoming him. In this blasted weather he honestly prayed that the timed charms he'd performed on the floors and furnishings would gently start to warm up within the next ten minutes. The place would feel almost Heavenly when he stepped inside, he was sure of it. He packed the letters away into his satchel, knowing only too well how they'd end as he rubbed his fingers against his temples and cleared his throat. He rubbed his hands together before slipping his gloves on. At long last the train pulled up into his station and he slipped his cloak around his neck, grasped his cane in one hand and his leather satchel in the other as he hobbled off the train, the creak in his knees making him wince a little. '
Shaking his head he wordlessly excused himself from the table and let his heavy feet drag his body over the bright green grass down to the small dock leading out a few metres into the lake. Draco was already waiting there, his hair gleaming in the sunlight. Despite the bags under his own eyes and the restless night he'd had, the blonde man still managed to look impressive and somewhat happy. Was he really that excited about spending some quality time with Harry? It couldn't be true. It just didn't seem to make any sense. Something stiff stirred in his chest as his mind wandered back over the night before and how oddly comforting it had been nestled in the crook of Draco's arms. The feeling had been a dulled down, muffled echo of what 'comfort' used to feel like, but the fact that any feelings at all had penetrated the dull blackened numbness surrounding his mind. With a sigh he let Draco walk ahead of him a few paces whilst he stuffed his hands into his pockets. The wooden planks creaked underfoot as the water glistened brightly on either side of the narrow pier. If he didn't have his hands out, he wouldn't feel the urge to push Draco over the wooden beam barrier. He dug his nails sharply into his palms regardless, just in case the urge spiralled too far out of control.
"Is that what this is?" Draco asked straightening up a little, "Because if you've having a teen-life-crisis I will not hesitate to throw you over this balcony." He had meant it as a joke but he was surprised when a shadow passed over the brunette's face. "Harry?" he asked after a moment, "Look this is clearly bothering you and if you can't tell me or even Hermione, then you'll need to talk to a professional which will not only cost a lot, but there is a risk of it getting out to the public. So, what'll it be?"
Draco opened his arms and beckoned, "Come here. I want to hold you."
Draco jumped as the door shut and then almost leaped out of his skin when something warm and thick curled around his shoulders. He panted heavily as he slipped his fingers over the tassels that tickled them and shuddered, not realizing how cold he had become. The blanket had been charmed to warm him more than the fire ever good, and the room seemed to hum in appreciated as it didn't need to use as much magic to keep the fire high and roaring. Draco swallowed thickly, his eyes prickling with hot tears for a whole new reason. He pulled the blanket tighter around his shoulders and curled his legs beneath him, hunching over and sniffing loudly, "Thanks ... Potter."
Blaise straightened up and looked over his shoulder at the Gryffindor table. Potter was sitting over there at his table, hunched over, with some mild bruising around his eye that wasn't completely covered by his weak glamour. Weasley and Granger were seated next to him but appeared deep in conversation with the she-weasel, all of them kept glancing over at their friend. Something was definitely off and bothering the boy. It looked as though a dark cloud was hovering over his head. Clearly he wanted to talk, but with his friends being a couple now and his obvious aversion to the she-weasel's company, he was stumped.
Draco shrugged a shoulder not making any move to dislodge the hand from on top of his own, "I know you didn't. I didn't mean to snap. It's just been a long hard day and it just doesn't seem to end." He looked up at the green-eyed man beside him and turned his palm around and linked their fingers together. "I wish you could have stayed though. I thought Slughorn was in charge of the ward today anyway?"
By the time he had finished and went to wait in the Entrance Hall he was getting a little anxious until Draco stepped up next to him, "Hey Harry can you wait a moment? I need to go and try to speak to Slughorn about something for next lesson. You don't mind waiting do you?" he asked, his pale cheeks flushed pink.
Potter stopped short as he watched Draco breeze past him and make his way to the stands surrounding the arena. He glanced own at the blonde's arse and then jolted at what he'd done. Shaking his head he called out a firm, "No!"
Harry was surprised and couldn't deny the way his stomach flipped as he slid out from the bench and straightened his own robes. Ignoring the protests that Ginny started to give, he walked around the end of the table and gestured down the aisle between the tables, "Let's go then."
Draco nodded his head, "Alright that sounds good. Oh and ..." He glanced around and bit down on his lip before moving closer, almost cornering Harry into an alcove. "If you fancy meeting up later tonight," he breathed, one of his hands trailing up Harry's forearm, "I'd be happy to do that as well."
Draco's eyes were open and his breathing was a little more laboured at the sight of Harry clothed in only a nightshirt and dressing down perched on the edge of his bed. "I'm sorry," Harry breathed, not really knowing why he was whispering, "I didn't mean to wake you up."
"Malfoy just let me help," Potter stated in an exasperated manner. "You don't want to wear that. It's far too rough."
Draco had to admit he'd wished Potted acted a little more shocked than just tilting his head back to glare up at him. "Yeah well Hagrid's not the only Giant here, if you know what I mean."
Draco chuckled to himself before turning on the T.V. flicking through the channels, and then handed the remote over to Harry. "You enjoy the soup; I'm going to run you a bath."
Draco sighed inwardly, the sky seeming drearier now. He was in constant denial of late and he loathed himself for it. He gripped the steering wheel tighter, his knuckles flashing white. He let out a shaky breath, tears prickling his eyes. He coughed stiffly and continued along the motorway the blood draining from his hands and face. He drove past a sign.
"Harry," the brunette corrected, trying not to let any measure of annoyance ebb into his voice, "And I am just here as a Healers apprentice from Calais for the weekend. I'm not really on any level of society, but I am training to be a healer so that I can be as decent as Snape, if I can be."
Harry let a small smile grace his lips as he reached out and traced a line down the blonde man's features. When had he stopped noticing the slight crow's feet around his eyes, or the way his slender neck had gotten a little thinner, the shadow of his beard already starting to grow back out again? He still looked handsome but he also looked a great deal more distinguished than he had when they were younger, or even when they'd gone to spend the summer at Severus'. He had no doubt filled a little around the neck and cheeks but his muscles were a little leaner than they had been a few years ago. It was to be expected as he was now forty-three years old. He let out a soft sigh and relaxed as Draco's fingertips caressed his scalp. "That feels nice," he murmured as he closed his eyes and leaned into the touch.
To you I offer every beat of my heart for I believe you will value it,
Love you always,
Elena and I stared in silence at each other for a long moment before I sighed. So... guess what? We now have at least one extra passenger coming with us to Africa. We also have a daughter that's extremely hard to argue with!
She nodded in understanding and opened the box before anyone could ask her to do so. The box contained a bundle of red silk and a note that read: "Please put this with your father's necklace and bury them together - or whatever you like, just please don't let them be separated."
Draco didn't loosen his grip on Harry's arm, if anything he tightened it. His face was serious if a little tired. He shook his head firmly, "I don't want you to go anywhere."
"Are you sure?" Harry sniffled into his shirt cuff as he tried to dry his face off.
"Oh but I do," Draco replied sincerely, "You're forgetting that up until that moment, I'd been living at
Harry shifted slightly and entwined his left hand with Draco's right, over their knees. He squeezed. "I trust you, Draco. People trust you. That is my wish ... see? I even made it official." At Draco's frown, Harry shifted so as to dig something out of his jeans pocket. What he produced was a rather crumpled origami crane. Draco couldn't help it -he burst out laughing.
It had been a trying week for everyone and by the time Draco forced himself to go Malfoy Manor to sort out his father's estate, he was emotionally and physically drained that he was so tempted just to get a wheelchair and have someone wheel him around in it. He didn't want to do it, but seeing the amount of distress that his mother was in he simply couldn't ignore it, even if it was for her own sake. He felt cold and shaky as his heels clicked one at a time as he trailed through the long marble corridors and up the grand staircase to the second floor. Everything seemed cold and colourless as he drifted along as if in a trance. He smoothed a hand over his slightly dishevelled hair and grimaced as the cold wintery air settled in his bones. It was far too dreary a day to be rifling through papers and getting accounts in order. He didn't want to do it and his father's solicitors had dealt with most of it including the reading of the will, which was all well and good but it left Draco with dealing with the private matters that only he and his family knew about. It wasn't that much of a secret that Lucius' accounted would immediately be shared out amongst Narcissa, Draco and Severus. Not that he cared about any of the accounts themselves. It was only because Mother wasn't fairing too well that he was taking another duty on his shoulders. Not that he could blame her for that.
He wouldn't be able to hurt anybody anymore.
To say that nobody recognised Harry in the fine altered robes was an understatement. Lucius was able to hide most of his surprise except for in his eyes, so much like Draco's own, only a fraction colder, whereas Draco's were like warm mercury. Harry flushed a little as his slick backed hair actually stayed in its styled position, with the new scented wax that Draco had offered him earlier. He felt far too inferior compared to the rest of them and felt as though he was playing dress-up but he didn't voice any of these thoughts as he was invited to dine with the Malfoy's –the first time that Harry had met Narcissa Malfoy or even heard her name mentioned –before they set off in the large coach to the hotel where they stripped their travelling cloaks and walked into the function room where much the same people were there, including a flock of new people who may have heard all the commotion about the enthralling topics to be discussed, and couldn't pass up the chance to wag their own tongues and offering their personal opinions.
Harry chuckled again as he ruffled Seeker's flanks. "Well he must love you lots since you've spent all of this time with him."
"Well at least you're not raising to the bait," she smiled over at him before launching into a speech about him getting to crack the egg open and find out what the clue was about. Harry nodded along and tried not to smile too much. Poor Hermione. She really didn't know him that well, did she? Then again no one knew that he had a copy of '
"Draco," she stated, her dark eyes challenging Ginny to say something about it. Harry had to bite his tongue to keep from laughing; he could tell that Ginny was desperate to sneer about the whole thing and how Malfoy deserved it. He'd heard the speech enough times in various tones, as had Hermione. "It's utterly ridiculous! He wasn't the only one here that day. I'm not saying people should be nice to him but just leave him alone if they're going to be ignorant about it all."
, he thought as he stared down at the words,
He tugged the light chord and watched the tiles plunge in to blackness before making his way towards the bedroom, Seeker trotting along behind his wagging his tail.
"I can't ... wait," Harry managed to say as a yawn stretched his pink mouth wide open. Draco rolled his eyes and after a few more clicks, he shut the laptop down and placed it on his bedside table.
They dressed in a comfortable silence and parted ways at the end of the corridor with a small peck on the lips and a gentle squeeze of the hands. As Harry turned to head back up to Gryffindor tower to get some semblance of sleep for the final task, Draco watched him go and prayed to Salazar that Harry would make it back in one piece.
He glanced up to see Harry's face increasingly pensieve as his eyes glimmered in the gold light of the fire. "You kept those?" he breathed, his voice barely audible over the crackling of the flames, "After all these years you still have them?"
Draco had been the one to go the extra mile, of course. He'd heard that Potter had been asking -not to subtly -where the prefects bathroom was. He decided to take some action and sneak out of the Slytherin dorms to escalate the game. It was late and he'd been standing just down the hallway waiting patiently in a dark alcove, his grey eyes watching the door as he waited for Potter to finish doing whatever he was doing in such a big bath tub.
He only had to wait another ten minutes before the blonde came back, looking a little drained but otherwise looking hopeful for the day ahead that they'd planned. He reached Harry and gestured for them to get going. He was about to mention the phial but decided that it could wait until lunch. He wasn't suffering from a headache right that moment. It weighed down in his pocket and bumped against his thigh as they made their way to one of the last carriages, before clambering up inside and sitting down.
Harry rolled his eyes, "don't jinx it, Draco."
"Can you ... um ... help me write about this?"
Draco shook his greasy blonde hair, "Later," he stated firmly, "For now, I think you should go."
Blaise waved off her concerns with a flick of his hand, "You're still far too dramatic, Pansy," he stated loftily, "Besides, I was sick of seeing Draco moping around like that."
"Welcome to my world" Draco breathed dryly, as he wiped at his face with the cuffs of his sleeves. He sighed and breathed in deeply, "if you want I can ask the nurses to let you go for the weekend."
Harry was trying hard to suppress a smile as he poked as his pasta with his fork, "can we go tomorrow?" he asked hopefully.
"Goddamnit Harry, I fucking love you!" Draco moaned out, his voice echoing in the small room. He gasped and clenched his jaw tightly as his cock was drawn out into the cool air. Harry's hot fingers wrapped around him and started to stroke. He felt his legs turn to jelly as he clung onto the brunette man's shoulders. "You're such a fucking tease," he growled at the back of his throat.
"Just going out around Hogsmeade or something. Maybe get food, look around shops, hang out, you know."
As the sky finally decided on becoming dark blue, Draco felt his stomach give a painful rumble. He had not eaten since that morning and he had only had some noodle soup along with Harry. He grimaced as another rumble broke through his thoughts. They needed to stop off for something to eat. He doubted any of the food at their apartment would be edible anyway. As he turned around another corner he came to a slow stop at a red light. It would not do to go in and eat and leave Seeker in the back of the car.
Draco smiled and hugged Harry even closer to his warm chest. He ignored the prod of Harry's bones through his skin and clothes and focused on warming the younger mans' body. Despite the warm temperature, Harry seemed prone to the cold. "I'm just glad that you have managed to keep all this food down."
"I don't want to go to sleep," came the bleary reply as Harry's eyes started to droop.
Later the evening, Draco hadn't appeared in the Great Hall along with everyone else. For one, Harry Potter, this realization was a little unsettling after the funny looks the blonde had been giving him all afternoon. It was as though he were love-struck or something. But for the other Slytherin's, it was a much needed moment of secrecy that they could duck their heads together and trade information.
He doubted Malfoy had heard him.
"I don't want to leave you, Draco," came the breathy whisper in the darkness. "I am finally happy and now -I just -"
"Tell me you're close?" he croaked, as he felt his stomach throb and knot.
He glanced over to the phone attached to the wall just outside the kitchen. That was where it happened. Harry had worn that soft black hoodie he wore on rainy days. The sky had been grey outside the window and rain had lashed down noisily, filling the screaming silence with the sound of needles. He could still hear the words falling out of Harry's mouth, like a distant echo in his ears. "That was Doctor Nickson. My test results came back this afternoon ... he said that it looks as though I have ... erm ... C-cancer"
Harry shook his head and held up his hand, "Oh no, I couldn't possibly do that, Master Malfoy."
"Blackpool? Why are we going there?" Harry asked, the frown he wore marring his smooth head.
dead, and that is the most important part. You
He knew it shouldn't have bothered him so much but he couldn't help it. He hated waking up alone without Harry curled around him, but he especially loathed it when they went to bed fighting. He hated going to bed angry because it would sit there, in the back of his mind and slowly spread like a poison through his body whilst he slept.
Harry laughed lightly, "I'm twenty-two, Draco. You're only five years older than me. It'd take a lot longer than that for me to even breathe near Snape's ranks no matter how hard I push myself."
"You weren't before?" Draco asked incredulously.
Draco snorted dryly to himself and drew the blanket tighter around his body. "Just go. He's not coming back. We both know it."
Even though his tone indicated that he would appreciate a change of topic, he couldn't stop the question from falling from his lips and spilling out into the air. "What are you suffering from, if it's not too impertinent a question to ask?"
. It was exhilarating. He felt a rush every time he smiled at the blonde in full view of everyone else. He loved the rush, but he loved the feeling blooming in his chest whenever the blonde returned the smile even more. "Should we say usual time?" he asked, wanting to lean up and kiss those soft pink lips. They'd only gone as far as to kiss one another on the forehead whenever they assumed the other had fallen asleep beside the fire or, in recent weeks, the armchairs that popped up.
Ginny furrowed her brow and Harry couldn't deny his interest was piqued as he lazily flicked through his Defence textbook whilst eating his food. "Who are you talking about, Hermione?"
Draco snorted, "Are you kidding? No offence, Potter, but being the Boy Who Lived has its perks. Until the day you die people will reason that defeating the Darkest man of all wizarding history, is more of a merit to your name and magical ability than any piece of paper saying you passed. I'm pretty sure you'll be blindly marked anyway as soon as they see your name."
He loved how care-free Harry appeared.
The door to the room appeared with a weak groan and this time he didn't feel much hesitation holding him back as he pushed the handle and entered. Nothing else had changed and the fireplace still stood as proudly as possible off to one side. Only this time, he didn't have much time to admire the room as he felt a strong force barrel into him and pin his body against the rough wood of the door. He gasped as something sharp was pressed into his throat and he felt a fist punch him in the stomach, forcing him to drop his wand. He winced as he heard the wood skitter across the flagstones, no doubt being kicked away. He gasped out and just about drew in a lungful of air before a sharp slap whipped across his face. He yelled out and gripped his hand to his face as the fuming blonde stepped away from him, wand still digging into the base of his throat.
She was jolted out of her readings as Professor Slughorn's voice resounded through the room, "And now I shall read out your project partners so listen up!"
Hastily unzipping his jeans, Harry slid his chair out from under the table to give Malfoy better access. His mind was running blank as he felt someone touching his cock and getting him good and hard. He let out a strangled grunt at the back of his throat as Malfoy grazed his teeth down his neck and pumped his fist harder around the, admittedly, impressive length.
It was on one of those long days where he was observing some new spells that made it easier and safer to dissect body parts without any excess blood spurting out all over their robes that Harry received another letter from Draco. He smiled as he recognised the intricate scrawl on the front of the envelope. He never ceased to marvel at how beautiful his name looked written in Draco's hand. He flipped it over as he went over to sit in the hard backed chair at his small wooden desk and turned the oil lamp up a little bit more so that he could read in the gloom of the twilight. He felt his smile fall a little as he read Draco's latest reply.
It was soothing and familiar.
"Are you close?" the brunette grunted above him.
Draco rolled his red-rimmed eyes but took up the duelling stance, so similar to the one he'd done in their second year. Harry was pummelled with a memory so gripping that he didn't realise Draco had cast a spell until it hit him and sent him flying backwards against the flagstones, knocking the wind out of him. He landed on his back and blinked up at the ceiling, gasping for breath before he felt his body being levitated and spun around in the air and slammed down onto the floor again.
Lucius eyed him with scepticism before turning to face him, "And would you be willing to complete such a task for my son, Mister Potter? I daresay some company his own age would not go amiss either, if I dare say so myself."
"Oh, Draco that's NOT true!" Hermione exclaimed desperately.
Harry chuckled to himself, such a pleasant sound that Draco almost relaxed a little against his sweat-stained pillows. The silk would be ruined there was no doubt about that. "I'm going to give you your bath, Draco. I have some scent oils in my satchel along with some properties that general help to strengthen your muscles for short periods of time. It'll give you enough energy to sit about for a couple of hours for when we eat and then when the maids strip your bed sheets. Yes I asked them about that as well," he added at Draco's surprised face that turned to him.
With a lot of whining, Harry dragged himself out of his lover, to the edge of the bed and almost dropped full-body on the floor. He caught himself just beforehand with a grunt. Draco was lying sprawled out on the bed. On wobbly legs, the brunette man padded heavily over to the bathroom and unrolled half a roll of toilet paper to wipe the cum off his chest and stomach. He shivered as the cool air snaked around his ankles and he had to brace himself on the sink before slowly taking the used condom off.
Harry nodded his head. He hadn't been expecting a warm welcome. He didn't deserve even the thought of one, he knew that. But to hear Draco talk down to him like that made his blood run cold. He managed to get his tongue working, "I know nothing I can say or do is going to make anything better," he looked up and fixed Draco with what he hoped was a determined look, "I am going to, though. I'm going to get better. Severus is going to help me. I
"Seeker! Don't run too far!"
Harry found his tongue sticking in his mouth, "I'm not a very strong rower."
The following morning he had felt beyond well-rested and as though he hadn't a proper care in the world. It was hard to hide how his aura seemed to glow around him, but he just couldn't contain it. Over the rest of the day he tried to keep an eye out and see who was watching him. There was no one.
Severus inclined his head, a smirk itching to crawl onto his lips, "Naturally. I'm sure there are a few healers below Harry he would do an excellent job but I can send a friend of mine in to oversee things if your concern is truly that great." His cool dark eyes dared Harry to challenge him. He knew that the young man wouldn't be able to find anything to argue with, and it was present in his manner when he simply inclined his head before hunching over his bowl of yoghurt and fruit. Severus spared a look at Draco and inclined his head over his glass of pumpkin juice. Draco offered him the weakest of smiles that his tired features could offer and Severus accepted it. There was no doubt about it that something had occurred between the two younger men and he was determined to get to the bottom of it, even if did mean getting Harry to see some sense that he was working too much over taking care of himself and of Draco.
Okay, the harder stuff … I'm going to preface this by saying, what you do with your mental health is between you, your healer, and your mind healer. I've always said I will stay out unless you invite me in. But since you keep telling me about your mini health breaks I feel as though you've invited me in. Please feel free to tell me to butt out if I'm overstepping. I would like you to talk with Rowe and Yesenia, and tell them exactly how often you're dosing yourself.
Tommy stuck his tongue out in mild disgust. "Blech! WHY are mushrooms on the menu?"
I set Wojtek down and when I stood up, everyone had their eyes on my shirt, which said: I was taught to think before I act, so if I smack the shit out of you, rest assured that I've thought about it and am confident in my decision.
Draco
Thursday March 31st
Well, the cat's out of the bag now, hahahahaha!
It's early. It's early even for me. Well, it's not so early for me to have been awake, but seeing as I've already gotten ready for the day and am ready to leave at my usual wake up time, it's early. You would probably just call this time "yesterday"!
Alright, I know that this is going to send my adorably panicky little mutt into, well, panic mode, but our department - and thus me - was sent an anonymous letter today that I sincerely hope is someone trying to play a very poor prank. Honestly, this almost has all the classic fingerprints of our 'trouble twins' Siri and Zwei all over it - in that if they were feeling like they haven't seen me enough, this would DEFINITELY get me to visit them at Hogwarts today.
And don't get me started on the STI. Fuck my actual life. At least it's treatable.
Incoming!
"Such as his stalker?" Siri asked curiously.
My patient husbands,
Harry
The good news is they assured me it was common during MTF surgery recovery for a woman to not quite know how to reach physical satisfaction. Unfortunately, there are a ton of misconceptions, rumors, and assumptions out there. The chance that she will not be able to achieve orgasm or feel sexual satisfaction is almost completely nonexistent. The reality being it's just going to take some experimentation and willingness to try different tactics until something fits.
The letter was not nearly as lovely.
"They've been doing that all morning," Viona informed me as she strutted regally to my side and gave me a kiss on the cheek. "I nearly murdered Eri because I woke up to her hovering over me in our bed with a massive energy ball in her hands aimed right at me. She's only still alive because I haven't learned the Avada Kedavra yet!"
P.S. You did absolutely nothing wrong, so don't you DARE blame yourself for having preemies again!
I've had a couple of days now to think about our shag the night of my birthday. It really wasn't bad at all. Sorry, that came out so rude, it was actually nice. It's uh, not something I'd like to do all the time, but I could absolutely do it again if you wanted to explore a bit more. It being your gorgeous face made it so much easier than I thought it would be. Knowing it was your heart and soul, no matter the packaging, simply meant I was making love to my husband. No squicks I promise.
He uses your heart against you and I fear the day you will completely close off that big beautiful heart of yours to keep yourself safe.
You have a dragon tattooed on your hipbone? Er, hold on a moment, I have to run to the loo.
P.P.S. Sweet Salazar! The memory of you with shoe polish smudges all over your naked body is going to be wank bank material forever!
If there is any sort of higher power, they are definitely getting off on messing with me.
Until now.
I kissed you, and then kissed you again. "I love you."
Then why am I so upset?
Harry and Oliver
The good news is that since I don't have a trip to plan this week, my entire attention (when not working on magical batteries) can be on our play room. I'm thinking I'll commandeer the suite above ours for it. That way, I can build a staircase from our bedroom directly to it, and then we can have stairs up to a sort of Widow's Walk on the roof where we can have a hot tub to soak in while we gaze at the stars.
I'm going to go find Draco, make him read his email, and we are going to come find you to give you cuddles and kisses and talk to our baby girl.
Harry and Oliver don't need to forgive Draco, and Draco thinks it's time to go out and blow off some steam.
I laughed. "Our newest - Rita - is a toddler that we rescued from some absolute monsters. Meanwhile, one of our older girls just had twins with her wife, so our family just keeps on growing and growing. OI! Dylan! What did you just put in your mouth?!"
March 6th
Which was true but since neither of us could be sure that it was the event directly prior to his disappearance, I hadn't mentioned it to you previously. For example, that could have been a delivery, and Darrin could have accepted it and gone to take a shower before something else happened. My visions don't come with time references, so unless I happen to see a clock in the vision, I can't tell if one thing happened before or after another thing.
"JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE IT, DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M A MORON!!!"
Speaking of things that may need to be altered or rescheduled. Are you sure you want me to go on the tour without you? I could see about rescheduling it. I could even cancel the whole thing if that's what you think is best. And hey, haha, silver lining then no one could throw things at me! You can't be laughed off the stage if you never get onto the stage to begin with right?
"Oi! Boss! The vehicles you rented to haul us all to the Water Park have arrived!" Pippa called out as she entered the room.
I hear you about the hypocrisy, but keep in mind that there are actually very few purebloods left. Thus, the majority of the Death Eaters - especially the ones *not* in the Inner Circle - were actually half bloods or less. That means that they wouldn't have had as much aversion to breeding with muggles. Plus, honestly, it wasn't about blood, it was about fear and the ever present question: If they can do those terrible things to muggles and muggleborns, how long before they do those terrible things to half bloods? Would they ever dare do them to purebloods??? I'd better not risk it...
And your poor grandmother! Subject to dementors because she took vengeance upon some piles of filth that called themselves a wizard and witch? Damnit! How can we with magic claim superiority when we're relegating girl children to an uneducated future with only an arranged marriage to look forward to, and murdering or orphaning any children born without magic! I'm so mad! I can't even think straight right now!
I think it's hilarious that she's not even related to her and Pansy is still terrified of Molly!
This is a picture post, and barring any glitches, it should be complete now. Keep in mind that the pictures are visual aid for the outfits described and not meant to be an accurate reflection of the kids' looks or ages. That said, I think some of them come pretty darn close, lol. Also, congratulate Chrissy for finding 'real' pics of Harry and Draco ^_^
I could do that. I took a deep breath and went back to undressing myself but much slower. Revealing all of your sub inch by inch. Standing there finally, completely starkers, awaiting instruction.
My Men,
It's like I've been awakened, every rule - I had you break it, it's the risk that I'm taking, I ain't never gonna shut you out, Baby I can see your halo, I know you're my saving grace,
"Say, Draco?"
If not, that's alright, I actually haven't had these plans for a super long time I just started thinking about it a few days ago. Actually yesterday to be precise. When I was reading your email and you said I had to think of something to do with Siri and Zwei for their birthday I laughed because of course I remembered their birthday was coming up and I already had those plans set just waiting on confirmation we were going to Greece. However I had completely forgotten my own birthday was coming up! I am getting old and senile apparently because I can't remember my own birthday!
"Yeah, yeah, that's it, keep it up, yeah, mmmm. You'd better be ready, I'm going to, yeah, yeah, that's it, Harry!!"
Harry
And when you've cried your last tear for the day, blown up your last vase, and glamoured the pink out of your weary eyes, we will be inviting our whole family for a lovely meal and game and movie night. Because not only have they all missed you these last weeks, but each of your children wants to be here for you.
Happy birthday to ME apparently! "What do you want for your birthday Love?" - "To spend the entire day shagging my husbands in every way possible" - "I suppose I will make that sacrifice for your birthday" .....
Yes, please read that with the maniacal laughter I wrote it with.
Better than I imagined it being. Trust you to not want me to keep my messy face, so you ran your hands through the wetness on my face and fed me your come fingerful by fingerful. "That's my very good boy!"
My husband Edmond died yesterday. It was expected, but the fallout has been more of a shock.
The sight of them mesmerized me enough that I almost didn't notice the abuse raining down on me. Eventually, I just couldn't ignore it any longer and had no choice but to surrender to the ordeal. To give into the pain and let it carry me away. I can only assume that Oliver had cast a denial spell on Falcon, because the glimpses I caught all showed me that Oliver's vigorous mouth was really working Falcon's shaft - almost like a professional.
Obviously, your favorite part was all the puppy play, and yes, that turned me on so badly that I honestly thought I was going to find out how many times I physically *could* orgasm in one day. But I managed to hold most of it back, haha.
No, it was disappointing in that something could be wrong, or nothing could be wrong. Our worries weren’t relieved and we don’t have any plans to fix the issue if there even is one. We have to follow a “wait and see” approach.
Actually, ever since I started craving milk - which I am still very much craving like it's better than ice cream! I've had them delivering milk at least once a week. Funny enough, they've had this system in which they almost never see or interact with us (and obviously not the elves) by leaving order forms each week when they drop off a delivery. The elves order things we need on the form, go obtain money from our vault and have it converted to muggle currency, and then leave the order form on the counter with the money so that it gets picked up during the next delivery. However, when I started wanting milk like it was as necessary as the air I breathe, I actually ambushed the farmer during one of his deliveries and demanded he deliver as much milk as he could each week.
They beckoned to the others. "This is Eric, the father of my baby boy Luka. Here, hold him! He LOVES his grandpa Draco."
Since you were occupied with our guest, I had no problems inviting Amala to lay on the bed and lick Wojtek while I fed and played with him. This naturally made Bear (the dog) come over and try to lick Wojtek's face too. To my surprise, Venus came close enough to sit on the foot of the bed and watch us curiously. I stayed up a bit late, but when midnight was approaching, I figured that you weren't coming to bed - especially since I had read your email and knew you were under a snugglebug.
Also, what do you mean a "that foolish Gryffindor" costume? A specific Gryffindor? Or just foolish Gryffindors in general? I think I need to see this costume! And, bravo on the "hot" pun about your phoenix costume, but let's be real here is there anything you could wear that wouldn't look hot on you? You're bloody fit!
Since hands on crafts and projects have been so popular, we gave everyone the option to turn their apple into applesauce and cider. This was actually fairly easy because there is a spell to juice an apple. The spell does what one of those muggle appliances - a juicer - does, by separating the juice from the pulp. Neither spell nor appliance is perfect at removing the juice, which is good because the pulp is simmered with a small amount of juice and a few spices (mainly cinnamon, but there was a variety to cater to individual preferences), until it is soft and 'saucy,' haha. The juice can be consumed right away, but the best thing (in my opinion) is to let it sit in an open to the air container which is covered by a cloth or paper towel to keep insects out of it. It will ferment just slightly in about 24 hours into non alcoholic cider, and if left longer, will morph into hard cider, then wine. Then vinegar. I look forward to asking the students at the next ritual how many of them remembered to check on their cider and drink it or bottle and store it before it turned to vinegar, buwahahahaha!
So, on Sunday when Harry was spending the day in his Gryffindor office with his Lions, and Oliver was out playing a friendly Quidditch match with all the house teams and anyone else who wanted to brave the cold wintry weather - although it was astonishingly sunny for this time of year in Scotland. Anyway, while you were both busy, I was having tea with Minerva and we were chatting about our upcoming wedding plans (and Harry, since I know you misread that, I MEAN your, mine, and Oliver's NOT Mine and Minerva's!).
"My Harry is mad at me again. He's frustrated by the fact that I can't just sit and enjoy being together as a family without talking about, or thinking about, or attempting to DO some work," Tiger explained. "But I feel like my skin is literally ITCHING to get back to the Ministry and do my bloody job!"
Sunday June 25th
So, I think I very quickly reached a state of panic. I pushed you off me and more than likely babbled incoherently as I leapt out of bed and rushed to the closet to get ready. I didn't even take a shower! I just threw on my favorite black wool trousers, a white button up, and my favorite ornate blue waistcoat, and then rushed off
To heck with it, screw humble, she's amazing! Humble is an overrated virtue in my opinion. As long as you're not being a braggart or a sore winner, take your worth and own it!
I have no idea how I got so lucky, what I did to deserve you, but I'd do it all over again for a single evening like you gave me last night.
Since I lost the chance to tell you all about what you missed at the appointment, I suppose this is the best place to do it. Rowe and I started seriously debating the safety and timing of when to transplant one of the little monsters. She still sticks to, unless there is some sort of emergent issue, she wants to wait until Morgana is twenty-eight weeks to move her. Well, she would only move a twenty-eight week womb regardless of who we move, it's just that Morgana will obviously get there first.
Harry
But now that we all officially agree to a March date I do think it's time to start planning! I think we should honestly avoid doing anything the same as our first wedding, I don't want Ollie to feel as though we're just duplicating what we already had with him added. And we have so many children, so many loved ones in our circle, that I don't think we should do a wedding party. It's just, how would we narrow it down and decide who to add? It would end up being the wedding party up front with the grandparents sitting in the audience.
Really glad we did the beach lounging before the luau. I'm already feeling self conscious and fat enough with my little baby bump, but I'm feeling quite unattractive right now. It's not going to stop me from jumping you once I've finished this email and had my stomach settle a bit, but I will probably make you keep the lights off.
My current job is to keep Ron and Blaise calm. We all know that biologically Ron is the father, but you'd think Blaise was too with how absolutely neurotic he's been since they got here.  The two of them so thoroughly annoyed Hermione that she kicked them out of the room for a while. She told them "Don't come back in here until you're calm enough to not even annoy moody Harry!" Which made me cry, so I also can't go in there until I have my "Bloody crybaby nonsense under control!"
Draco explains the face thing.
That said, I WILL buggering master this if it's the last thing I do!!! I will not FAIL! If you can do it, I can bloody well do it too!
Side note, did you get a chance to see Elena while she was here? Isn't her baby bump just GORGEOUS? She found out and told us in mid April, and was probably at least a month along when she found out, that puts her at 6 months - give or take a week or so - and so, her bump is rounded enough to be obvious, but still small enough that her overall appearance is slender and delicate.
I could have just fallen asleep to the feeling of complete love and safety. But as much as I enjoyed our time alone together, we didn't need to leave our husband home alone just so we could sleep on a blanket outside. Unless of course he had chosen to have a boys' night, get utterly pissed (which you obviously can't exactly do right now Ollie-Love), play with fire, and promise middle naming rights to an aforementioned friend.
"Er... D'accord…" I murmured, wondering who this was and if he was another of our apparently endless kids.
Sighing, I recapped things YET AGAIN! When I was done, our kids were silent for a shocking three or four seconds. Then River cleared his throat.
Love,
Holy shite! What if I didn't do it well? It took forever to make him come and you seem to think it was a denial spell, but what if I'm just not any good at giving head? I know YOU think I'm good at it, and Viper, and Tiger, and I guess Ron and Blaise have both said I do a good job, and those few times we've played with Greg, Charlie and Neville have never complained either, but what if everyone is just being nice and they secretly think I'm bad at it. They could just be humoring the sad little cock slag.
Oh, completely unrelated to our current conversation, but now I've got myself wondering. This is probably something I should have found out years ago. I can't believe I'm not even thinking of this until now, River is thirteen for crying out loud! We both know that none of our children will ever want for anything, but which of them are heirs to which lines? I know the Malfoy line requires a male and a blood child. So, is River the heir because he's the firstborn of your blood? Or was there some sort of clause of marriage, or in name? His last name was Lewis until a year ago, when he finally decided he wanted his name to match the rest of his siblings'. So would it be River or Orion? Or am I confused and there isn't a gender restriction and it's down to River or Eris since she was born first?
Draco
So, as I was saying, I know you both feel that you deserve a massive apology, and I am completely willing to give it. Tell me what you want and I'll do it...
Luckily she hasn't felt any nausea so far. Fingers crossed it stays that way and she gets through pregnancy more like you did without much in the way of sickness.
P.S. Yeah, I wasn't able to sleep yet after all, so I went and firedanced. Sorry if I smell a bit sweaty and singed when you wake up.
At least I got in a lovely morning run with no one to interrupt the golden fall light and the crisp air since everyone else was likely still sound asleep. I got first crack at all the breakfast foods in the Great Hall. And now I still have plenty of time to write up a long, lovely description of yesterday. I may wish I could sleep in but at least I had a productive morning. It could be worse, I could be forced to get up that early and have nothing to do but stare at the wall.
So I had a small amount of doubt about how the day would go since you're still a bit - or a lot - emotional in general, and your cousin is part of the family you don't like to talk about all that often. Or ever. But as it turns out, I was overworrying.
