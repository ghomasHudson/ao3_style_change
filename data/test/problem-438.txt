“Teddy, of course. Can you imagine? Seeing the two men that he loves most in the world, so at odds with one another,” Luna’s wide eyes focused on Harry once more. “The poor dear.”
Harry let out a slow breath. He could figure out what Malfoy was up to later, when Teddy was less upset. For now, he had tomatoes to pick.
Her lips parted in what would have surely been a gasp on anyone but her, amber eyes widening as she took in his appearance. Harry bit the inside of his cheek, shifting in place.
“I’m afraid not,” Malfoy grimaced, eyes flickering briefly on Harry before settling firmly on Andromeda again. “I have been called in Tuesday. However, I believe that I will be able to join you and Tedward on Wednesday for lunch.”
Jumping back, Harry’s gaze snapped to the side. Teddy stood in the doorway, a lollipop held firmly in his mouth as bright amber eyes flickered between Draco and Harry, the welcomewitch rushing out of Room 7 after him.
Teddy rambled on about everything he had done during the week that Harry had missed as they prepared their pizzas. Gary sat perched on his shoulder, tail flicking back and forth as he stared at Harry.
With that, Teddy spun on his heels and strode out of the kitchen to the back garden, slamming the door behind him.
Potter hums, low in his throat, as he circles the sitting room before sitting next to you. His knees brush against yours and he sets the tea cup upon the coffee table before resting one hand on your leg, thumb massaging your flesh.
“No!” Harry pushed his chair away from the table, standing abruptly and glaring down at his friends. “No, this is not an
Harry hesitated. He knew that he had arrived early, and it was still supposed to be Malfoy’s time with Teddy. But he had never been good at telling Teddy
as he let Draco’s words wash over him, pull him into an even deeper pleasure. Draco shifted behind him, arms wrapping around Harry and lifting him up flush against Draco’s chest, Harry’s head falling heavily until it rested against Draco’s shoulder.
Malfoy let out a soft sigh, running his fingers through his silky blonde hair as he glanced to the side, not looking at Harry. “Despite the distinct lack of finesse in his argument, Tedward is correct, Potter.”
He suddenly remembered the other week, when he had been sitting with his friends, commenting on how cute Teddy looked when he morphed—how
Harry bit his lip quickly and glanced down, attempting to hide the thrill he got, knowing that Teddy evidently did not approve of Draco’s boyfriend.
“You. This.” Malfoy gestured to the entirety of the room. “A few weeks ago you were so sure that I was in the wrong, that it was
“Er...yes. When I saw them together on Saturday I thought Jesse was flirting with her—which, to be fair, he
!” Teddy exclaimed, grinning up at Harry with bright silver eyes. “We had some at school the other day! I told Draco, and he said he could make some for me today!” Teddy beamed up at Draco, his honey colored hair darkening, fading to black.
Andromeda heaved a deep breath, letting it out on a soft sigh. “Harry...you do know how dear you are to me, don’t you?”
Squaring his shoulders, Harry pushed the door to the kitchen and made his way inside. Immediately, he was hit with the strong, comforting scent of rhubarb and apples, melted butter, cinnamon and sugar.
For a moment, they merely watched one another. Draco’s eyes were blazing, intent shining clearly within, and Harry could no longer doubt that this
“Anyway, how is Teddy doing, Harry?” Ron asked, stirring the stew before raising a spoonful to taste.
Teddy frowned, scrunching his nose as he looked up at Harry, staring at him as if Harry had completely lost the plot “No, he doesn’t.”
Harry chuckled, kneeling down to wrap his arms around Teddy in a tight hug as the boy ran into his chest.
Harry could not hear the voice as it spoke, but he watched as Draco grimaced, eyes shifting to watch Teddy before he replied. A quick conversation was held before the crow spread its wings, lifting from the ground, the
Their eyes met, and Harry felt as if he could breathe again as Draco’s lips curled in a soft, private smile, before he continued to read aloud to Teddy.
Gracefully, Malfoy stood, his lean body towering over Teddy, hand still resting gently atop his head.
“Fuck...er, yes Kreacher, I’ll be right out!” Harry stumbled, swearing beneath his breath as he finished washing quickly, roughly lathering shampoo in his hair and rinsing it before hopping out of the shower. He reached for his towel and wrapped it around his waist before stepping back into his bedroom.
“It’s alright, Draco,” Potter soothes, running this fingers through your hair. You cannot help the groan that rumbles from you at the feeling, as he grips your hair and
Malfoy slid out of the room, flicking the v at Harry as he brushed past . The kitchen was quiet for a moment, no one daring to speak as the front door closed with a soft
Andromeda could do little more than smirk before the door to the sitting room burst open and Teddy ran towards them in a whirlwind of excitement.
A soft sigh escaped from Draco’s lips, his eyes rolling in exasperation despite the telltale dimple. Fingers tangled in Harry’s curls, pulling him forward, lips meeting in a languid kiss, before Draco broke away and brushed a wild curl away from Harry’s forehead.
He cringed as he stood, pain coursing through his body with the movement. Jesse pursed his lips, clearly disapproving, but took a step back to give Harry more space.
Harry could feel his face heating as they all watched him. Clearing his throat awkwardly, he turned to watch as Teddy chased George around the yard, laughing uproariously as George stumbled, allowing for Teddy to tackle him to the ground.
“Okay...” Teddy sighed, shuffling feet as he made his way out of the kitchen, “...but Draco was going to make us toasties. Can we still have toasties, please?”
” Teddy shook his head with a snicker, arms wrapped securely around George’s neck as he squirmed around to look back at Harry, “Harry, tell him!”
Draco hummed, “Yes, I suppose it is. While you finish, Tedward and I will be off to play an exciting game called
“Hey, Teddy,” Harry grinned, placing a wet kiss upon Teddy’s cheek as he stood up, before turning towards Malfoy, who stood stiffly at the kitchen counter.
“You know, in a moment, you won’t even feel the scratches. Gary didn’t mean to hurt you, Tedward, of that I am certain,” Malfoy said, reaching for a large vial and twisting the cork from in. “And I promise, you won’t even scar. This dittany is the best that exists. You will be the most handsome boy in all of England in moments yet again.”
people!” Teddy sobbed. Andromeda laid a gentle hand on his shoulder, thumb rubbing soothing circles against his back, as he began to tremble. “He fixes people, and saves them, and he didn’t do anything wrong! Take it back!”
,” Harry snarled, “Unlike you. What, wasting your life away in a dilapidated manor like some spoiled, pureblood twat, preying on those better than you in hopes of finding some sort of scrap that will pull you out of the ruins
“Of course it would,” Harry glanced at Draco, throwing a quick wink his way, reveling in Draco’s wide-eyed surprise. “I’m sure your cousin loves it when you look like him.”
“I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Ron shrugged and turned to watch the children flying in the middle of the pitch. A few moments passed before he slyly glanced at Harry, lips twitching with a mischievous smirk. “I’m just saying, though...there are probably less painful ways for you to get the Ferret on top of you—”
Hermione had suggested that he make a list of all of the careers he would be interested in. He had already crossed out Auror, DADA professor, snake breeder, glass blower, herbologist, and barista. Next on the list was
“Oh, really?” Harry smiled indulgently, sparing a quick glance at Malfoy to see the man looking intently at Teddy as if Harry were not there. “What did you practise?”
They worked in silence for a few moments, offering quick smiles to one another, gently pushing at the other’s shoulders, as Teddy stumbled in his haste to add more topping to the second crumble.
“I believe so. He has done so well with little Teddy, and Teddy adores him,” Luna smiled serenely before letting out a soft sigh. “Oh, it must be so difficult for him.”
Harry offered a soft smile towards his godson. Just as he was about to say that they should start lunch—they didn’t need Malfoy, after all—Andromeda placed both her hands securely on Teddy’s shoulders and ushered him towards the sitting room.
“What was that?” Harry questioned hoarsely; his voice felt raw, scratching over his words. Malfoy tilted his head slightly, as if to look over his shoulder at Harry, though his eyes remained focused solely on Teddy.
Ginny blinked slowly at him, looking quite unimpressed. She sighed exasperatedly, throwing her hands up at her sides.
their brooms, surely—as his back hit the solid earth, a hard body landing on top of him and forcing the air from his lungs.
!” Teddy repeated. His bottom lip began to tremble, and Teddy quickly sucked it between his teeth in an effort to stop it. “You’re wrong! Draco isn’t bad, take it back!”
With the assurance that no one was seriously injured, the crowd began to disperse, returning to the camp and stands.
Harry inhaled sharply. A sudden flare of hope began to spread like wildfire through his body. He clenched his fists at his sides, digging his nails into his palms to steady himself.
Potter frowns, thick brows furrowing as he takes a step toward you, “Yes. And I have for many years.”
Scrambling after Malfoy and Teddy, Harry stumbled as he tripped out of the sitting room. He needed answers. He needed to know
Hermione turned on her heels and made her way into the kitchen. For a moment, Harry was alone, left stunned and more confused than ever.
“I know, ‘Mione! But he did want Gary. He was rather convincing,” Harry mumbled, shoving a piece of bread into his mouth.
was propped against Draco’s knees, inclined so that he could read it, pale fingers threading delicately through Teddy’s thick turquoise locks.
In an instant, any apparent innocence that Ginny may have been projecting disappeared. Her eyes glinted with satisfaction in the knowledge that Harry would tie himself to this wager.
Harry’s lips parted on a quiet gasp, his eyes widening slightly as he stared at Malfoy. His stomach flipped, cheeks heating at the sound of his name on Malfoy’s tongue. The tips of Malfoy’s ears and his cheeks were flushed as he quickly looked away, focusing once more on Teddy.
“No,” Malfoy shook his head, coughing lightly as he turned to gaze cooly at Harry. “But I am certain that you would prefer to spend time with Teddy without my presence.”
As Harry entered the kitchen, the movement caught Andromeda’s eye and she turned to welcome him from her spot at the kitchen table, hands clasped in her lap and a soft smile lingering on her lips, before she promptly froze in place.
“Alright, dear,” Andromeda nodded her acceptance and looked once more at Harry. Her sharp eyes narrowed, observing him quietly for a moment. “Behave.”
Harry startled at the sound of his name on Malfoy’s lips, snapping his gaze quickly to observe the man. Malfoy was focused solely on Teddy, but a light flush graced the apples of his cheeks.
“Oh,” Harry blinked. He wanted to ask Malfoy more questions. How much longer did he have to train? Why did he decide to become a Healer? What the
“Three...two...” Harry paused, smiling as Teddy began to nearly vibrate, waiting for the countdown. “
The front door creaked quietly as Harry walked inside, and he closed it as gently as he could, trying not to bring any attention to himself.
Teddy narrowed his eyes, his nose wrinkling in a small sneer. He shook his head once, firmly, emerald eyes flashing. “No. No, just you.”
listening, then. It’s a case contesting next of kin and the relevancy of a deceased werewolf’s will. She wrote a will stating that her lover should receive her assets, however, her lover isn’t a werewolf and her pack hadn’t formally recognized their relationship before she passed. Her pack is saying that because it wasn’t formalized, the will is inapplicable, and they must instead defer to the pack hierarchy.”
Malfoy blinked, grey eyes flickering across Harry’s face. “It is, yes,” he said slowly, “but it’s perfectly fine, Potter.”
Harry paused at the sight. Now that he was no longer worried about Teddy, he took a moment to appreciate how the robes hung from Draco’s lithe form. While the ghastly color certainly did not suit his pale skin, Harry noted that the man looked quite distinguished in them.
His heart jumped, and he had to quickly snuff out the flicker of hope that sparked within him. He had let Draco know that he would have access to Grimmauld when Teddy stayed with him last week, and that he was welcome to come by.
Andromeda laughed and bent to kiss the crown of Teddy’s head. “Be good for Harry, darling. I will see you in one week.”
As he carefully set Teddy on the floor, both Malfoy and Teddy looked up at Harry at the same moment. Malfoy’s cool gaze faltered, his eyes widening as they slid over Harry’s body. Meanwhile, Teddy’s bright grin trembled, quickly replaced by a quizzical look as his eyes morphed, silver irises staring curiously at his godfather.
Ginny reached out, gently clasping Harry’s elbow and leading him to the kitchen table. They took a seat, Ginny pulling a chair directly in front of Harry’s so that she could hold his hand between her own, as she took a deep breath, “Harry...I promise you, Jesse is
Teddy whimpered, inhaling shakily before nodding his head in acquiescence. Draco held a hand out and Teddy immediately grasped it, squeezing it tightly between his small fingers.
“Er...nothing, I suppose,” Harry shrugged, sucking his bottom lip into his mouth anxiously. “It’s just...well, it’s rather outdated, isn’t it?”
Harry couldn’t help but feel that part of the reason for Malfoy’s departure, despite any rounds he may be assigned that day, was due to Harry’s presence. Aside from the Saturday that he had been late—which Harry now realized must have been due to his job at St. Mungo’s—Malfoy had always stayed with Teddy through lunch.
As everyone began to leave, Ron turned his gaze on Harry and Draco, eyes slowly cataloguing where they had been bruised only minutes prior. He looked at Draco, running his eyes over him appraisingly to ensure he was no longer injured. “You okay, there, Ferret?”
Taking a deep breath, Harry squared his shoulders and made his way out of the house to join Teddy and Draco in the garden.
“Master must learn to not indulge in too much temptation with the blood traitors,” Kreacher grumbled as he placed a plate full in front of Harry.
“I just...well, we talked, is all. We’re both going to be a big part of Teddy’s life, you know?” He lifted one shoulder in a clumsy shrug before straightening and facing his friends directly. “After Teddy got upset the other weekend and yelled at me, I guess I just—we just—we should get along, is all. For Teddy.”
Draco began to lift himself from his chair. At the movement, Harry nearly fell from his own seat, scrambling frantically to stop the other man.
A breath shudders from your lungs as your lips part. You sink into the couch, legs spreading as he rolls his hips against yours, gasping at the sudden
“Well?” Malfoy folded his arms across his chest, narrowing his eyes as he glared down at Harry. “Precisely what is wrong with a waltz, Potter?”
“Oh, no it wouldn’t!” Teddy said, shrugging as his feet touched the ground. He looked up at Harry, wide eyes glimmering mischievously in the morning light.
His breath caught as Teddy stepped out from behind Andromeda’s legs. His small body had morphed, silver eyes glimmering with tears as he looked between Harry and Malfoy. Platinum blonde hair now created a halo around his head, thin strands falling across his forehead as he began to shake. His skin was still tanned, dotted with freckles from playing in the sun, but it was evident in that moment who inspired the pale hair and stormy eyes.
for the already toned length of Draco’s legs, a crisp white shirt tucked into them. The first few buttons of his shirt were undone, Teddy’s small fist clutching on one lapel and further revealing the tantalizing dip of Draco’s collarbones.
“What!? I’m not oblivious!” Harry sputtered, turning to glare at Ginny, resting his wet hands against his hips—ignoring the suds dripping onto his jeans.
“Yes, well...Yule Ball aside, that doesn’t dismiss the fact that the waltz is an outdated dance that has no place in modern society,” Harry shrugged, raising his chin in determination.
Any heat that had smoldered in Draco’s eyes was immediately snuffed out. He sat up quickly, swinging his legs over the arms of the chair so that they rested flat against the floor. In the blink of an eye, Draco looked like the perfect pureblood—sitting straight in his chair, face void of any emotion, hands resting loosely in his lap.
The room was silent in the aftermath of Teddy’s enthusiastic visit, Draco sitting stiffly with his back against the headboard, staring at the door. He blinked lazily, eyes shifting to look at Harry.
. Harry couldn’t picture the man not only helping those in need, but voluntarily agreeing to wear the ghastly green Healer’s robes.
The fact that Draco spent most nights with them at Grimmauld instead of at his own flat after his shifts at St. Mungo’s certainly contributed to his happiness, as well. He finally had what he felt like he had been missing his entire life—a family.
, Harry thought—Draco’s tongue ran along his lips, leaving them plump and glistening, firelight shimmering against the wet trail along his skin.
He was just in time to watch as Jesse shook his head, striding away from Draco and towards the center of the Quidditch Pitch, where Ginny and Angelina stood. Draco watched him walk away, fists clenched at his sides.
be a barista. And that bloody bet. But this latest failure was not something she needed to be made aware of, not any time soon. She wouldn’t find out until they met again next week, so he could think of some way to get out of their wager.
“And you’re not?” Ron mumbled into his pint, looking to the side and taking a gulp from his pint. George snickered next to Harry, tilting his own pint in a cheers to his brother.
“I’ll just go Floo Hannah, then, shall I? Make sure she knows you’ll be helping her this week, start getting your schedule ready.”
Ron cleared his throat and Harry tore his gaze away. Hesitantly, he looked at his friend, flushing with embarrassment as he met Ron’s knowing gaze.
“‘Morning, Andy.” Harry grinned sheepishly as she raised a questioning eyebrow at him. Teddy was ecstatic that Harry was here well before his regular time, but after their encounter last weekend Harry was sure that Andromeda suspected his motives. Which was ridiculous...she should be suspecting Malfoy’s.
Andromeda smirked. “I am doing well, thank you, dear.” She gracefully lifted herself from her chair. “Now, I must finish organizing my trunk for the week. I will see you before I am off.”
“Of course,” Harry nodded. He could feel his cheeks begin to heat, embarrassed, though he was unsure of why. “Teddy desperately wants you to read
“Fuck, no!” Harry jolted forward, eyes frantic as he waved his hands dismissively in front of himself. “Draco,
Harry looked around the room. Andromeda observed the three silently by the hearth as she prepared for her departure. Draco’s jaw was clenched, his porcelain skin paler than it normally was as he waited for Harry’s response. Teddy shifted anxiously on his toes, bouncing up and down, a constant plea escaping his lips, “Please, oh please, please,
Harry’s hands were suspended over Teddy, trembling as he stared at his hurt godson, unsure of how he could fix him when he wasn’t sure what was wrong.
Draco blinked slowly, gaze calculating as he watched Harry. After a moment, he smiled apologetically. “Thank you for the offer, Harry. But I have an early shift in the morning and I doubt Teddy would wake before I left.”
“No, no, no!” Teddy let go of Draco’s hands and ran behind him, placing his hands on the small of Draco’s back and beginning to
If all that he could do for Teddy right now was to bring him to Draco, then that is what he would do.
Heaving out a sigh, Harry focused on the window overlooking the gardens as Teddy’s turquoise head ran past, a peal of laughter echoing into the kitchen as his godson played.
Harry stared between the two of them. Where Teddy stood firm, sure in his proclamation, Malfoy stared down at the boy in wonder. He looked just as shocked as Harry felt.
“I fell,” Teddy interjected softly, bright green eyes staring up at Malfoy, beginning to fill with tears once again. “I couldn’t keep my grip, I turned too fast.”
Teddy reached out quickly to grasp Harry’s hand and immediately began to pull him towards the entrance to the shop. The boy waved distractedly towards George as he pushed the door open. “Bye George! See you later!”
He still had plenty of time until he had to Apparate to Andromeda’s. Tilting his head back, Harry let the water saturate his curls, rivulets streaming down the back of his neck. He blindly reached out for the soap and began to lather it between his fingers.
Harry stood back and stared for a moment. Despite using magic, Kreacher’s laundry regimen was thorough and cumbersome, and there was no way his clothes would be ready before he had to go to Andromeda’s cottage.
Turning away from the window, Harry focused on his breakfast and the steaming cup of coffee in front of him, startling when Kreacher threw the paper down in front of him.
shot out of the Burrow, the ethereal form of a goose settling between the porch and the gardens. It paused, glancing between the two groups, before its beak parted and Molly’s strong voice called out, “Brunch is ready. Come along inside, now. And make sure that you do not muddy my floors—that means you, George!”
Draco hesitated before kneeling in front of Teddy, resting his hands on tiny shoulders, “I do. I’m sorry, Tedward. But I will see you again in a couple of days. Enjoy your time with Harry.”
Leaning back in his chair, Harry twirled the quill between his fingers as he stared at the parchment and the next possibility:
Sheepishly, Harry ran a hand through his messy hair, “Er, yes. I didn’t have anything else scheduled this morning so...well, I figured I would come by. Is that okay?”
Ron hummed quietly, though he said nothing else. They watched the remainder of the camp silently from the sidelines.
As soon as the door clicked shut behind them, Draco turned icy grey eyes towards Harry. His voice was cold, devoid of any warmth he had while speaking to Teddy. “Stay here while I get Maggie.”
As they sat down to eat, Harry listened attentively as Teddy recalled all of his adventures in the gardens for the rest of the table, as he began to gush excitedly about the upcoming Quidditch Camp.
There was a tight pull to Malfoy’s smile, and Harry could not help but wonder if Malfoy really was going to St. Mungo’s early, but before he could question the other man, Teddy squealed, jumping up and down with delight, before scrambling out of the kitchen to gather his things.
“Er...well, I suppose it’s when he’s feeling really strongly about something,” Harry mumbled, suspicious of whatever Hermione was trying to imply. “You know...when he’s upset, or wants something. Sometimes when he’s just really tired. Why?”
Ginny grimaced, glancing to the side. “I really think that is something that you should ask Draco about.”
“Wait,” Harry froze in place. Teddy didn’t have many cousins. In fact, Harry could only think of one. “Which cousin?”
Harry ran a shaky hand through his hair, swallowing thickly as he stood in front of the entrance to the kitchen. He suddenly felt anxious, but was unsure why. Teddy would surely be excited that he was there early. And it did
“Hello, darling,” Andromeda pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s right cheek, then his left, before pulling away and smiling fondly at him on Saturday morning. “It’s lovely to see you. Teddy has spoken of little more than what fun he had with you while I was away.”
up to anything. But if something happens, all of you are going to feel like shite for not believing me.”
“Oh, shut it, you,” Harry grumbled. Just as he opened his mouth to defend himself—though he wasn’t precisely sure
“Mmm...are you quite sure about that, darling?” Ginny asked, her voice dipping low with a sultry smirk. “I mean...you did wear those
“I did! So Draco showed him how. After we finished my lessons, of course!” Teddy reached for Andromeda’s hand, clutching it in his own as he turned to look back at Harry and Malfoy, amber eyes sparkling with mischief.
we found six gnomes!” He gazed up at Harry excitedly, his turquoise fringe bright in the sunlight, silver eyes glimmering with pride.
Harry shook his head once more, dismissing the thought from his mind. Teddy would not be that manipulative. He couldn’t be.
While Harry certainly did not care if he had made Malfoy uncomfortable with his presence, Harry recognized now that Teddy truly adored his cousin. Malfoy leaving earlier than expected surely hurt him, and if that was due to Harry...well.
Kreacher narrowed one eye at Harry, staring at him as if Harry were a moron. “Yes. Kreacher asked if Master was needing his clothes to be washed. Master said yes, so Kreacher has started the wash.”
“Nothing,” Malfoy slowly shook his head, pursing his lips as if considering what he would say. Harry had never known Malfoy to consider
“Yes, Nana!” Teddy grinned widely at Harry and Malfoy before following Andromeda from the room as they made their way toward the dining room, leaving Harry and Malfoy standing alone in the middle of the sitting room.
Harry winced, biting at his lip as he recalled exactly what had happened. He set his cup beside him, straightening where he sat, “Er...everything was fine, of course. But Teddy might have taken a...well, a short fall.”
“And you seem much happier, too,” Hermione continued, smiling warmly and nudging Harry with her shoulder.
“Listen, I—” Harry chewed on his lip for a moment before turning his gaze back to Malfoy. “Teddy and Andromeda...they trust you. Teddy adores you. I’d be a bloody idiot not to realize that.”
“Yes, of course. Well, then...” Harry paused, glancing between Malfoy and Teddy. He focused briefly on Teddy, who was watching the two adults hopefully, before turning back to the man standing stiffly before him. “I suppose I will see you next weekend...Draco?”
“Come on, Draco...” Harry tugged at Draco’s shoulder so that he lay on his back, propping himself over Draco and leaning down to suckle at Draco’s throat. “It’s early...plenty of time until breakfast—until Teddy wakes up. I want to—”
“Of course, Harry,” Hermione took a sip from her own glass of wine, “What do you plan on trying next?”
“You could help out there. Be a barista! Y’know, make those fancy coffee drinks and hand out scones and pastries and whatnot. You’re not bad in the kitchen, I bet you’d do well,” Ron nodded to himself, a grin splitting his flushed face.
“Yes,” Harry hissed, clenching his teeth together in frustration. How many bloody Malfoy’s worked at St. Mungo’s, anyway? Just to be sure the welcomewitch understood, he clarified, “Draco Malfoy.”
“I didn’t mean it like you thought—like it sounded,” Harry started slowly, quietly. He looked down at their intertwined hands, mesmerized by bronzed skin pressed against porcelain. “I just meant that...he doesn’t like me. Jesse, I mean.” Draco tensed and began to pull away, but Harry tightened his hold. “Which is fine! I don’t mind! It only matters because
Teddy sniffed loudly, his heels hitting the cupboard as he swung his legs repeatedly, looking between Malfoy and Harry.
Malfoy’s sharp face softened as he ran a hand over Teddy’s forehead, brushing the boy’s locks from his forehead in a gesture so adoring that Harry was dumbstruck.
Harry snapped his head towards Ron, who snorted and immediately lifted his hand to his nose, beer seeping out of his nostrils. Served him right. Hermione sat quietly, hands cradling her pint as she watched Harry with a keen eye.
The doors to the sitting room closed behind them and Andromeda let go of his arm, gliding towards her customary armchair and gracefully sinking into its folds. A pot of tea sat on the center of the coffee table, steam slowly rising from its spout.
Harry thought. This evening was surely going to either proceed so well that it would exceed his wildest desires, or it would go so
“This child,” Draco laughed tightly. There was a deep blush spreading across his cheeks, and Harry noted that the tips of his ears were beginning to pink. He spoke quickly, his voice higher than it normally was. “The imagination he holds...it’s outstanding, is it not? Mm, yes, of course it is. He gets that from my late cousin—Nymphadora. Quite the imagination, she had! Something all metamorphmagi have, of course.”
“Draco...” Harry started, voice deep and hoarse, hesitantly lifting his eyes to look into Draco’s, his heart beginning to thrum in his chest. “Why
They looked as if they were floating, waltzing on air. Harry watched quietly from the doorway, curiously drinking in the scene unfolding before him, before Teddy looked his way and squealed.
Draco strode past him, fingers brushing against his own, and Harry faltered before turning to watch as Draco turned the corner, disappearing from sight.
“I should have known you would keep this in your bedside table, Potter.” Draco placed a quick kiss to Harry’s shoulders before wet fingers rubbed at his rim. The tip of one finger dipped into him and Harry gasped, pushing back against the pressure. He bit at the pillow, trying desperately to quiet his groans, fingers clutching at his bedsheets, as Draco added another finger, and then a third.
Harry stared in dismay at the contents—or lack thereof—of his wardrobe. All of his clothes were gone, save for a wrapped parcel. There was a piece of parchment folded delicately on top. Picking it up, Harry frowned as he read its contents.
“Stop,” Harry groaned, darting forward and sucking Draco’s bottom lip between his own. When he leaned back, Draco’s eyes were wide as he stared down at Harry, pupils blown so that there was but a thin ring of silver outlining black. “I just meant...
“Why, what?” Potter questions, fingers pulling at the zip of your trousers, slowly making his way down your body.
“Yeah,” Harry murmured, finally tearing his eyes away from where Jesse had reached out and rested his hand on Ginny’s forearm.
Which was nothing, Harry noted, rolling his eyes with a bemused smirk, since Malfoy had wiped the wrong side of his face.
“Mate, c’mon,” Ron started to follow Harry as he stormed to the front door. He was using his calm-investigator-Auror voice. Harry clenched his fists in frustration, knowing that neither of his friends believed him.
By 10:30 am, Harry figured he had waited long enough. With sure steps, he walked out of Grimmauld Place and Apparated to Tonks Cottage, making the familiar journey up the cobblestone path towards the front door. The cottage was quieter than previous weeks; he could not hear Teddy’s laughter resonating throughout the gardens, nor the muffled voice that he had begun to recognize as belonging to Malfoy.
Malfoy scoffed, rolling his eyes towards the ceiling as he threw his hands in the air. Teddy giggled, clasping his hands over his mouth in an effort to disguise his amusement.
?” Harry snarled, stalking into the kitchen and making sure to block Malfoy’s access to the rest of the cottage. The ferret may already be in the house, but Harry would be damned if he let him get any further and inflict any damage.
Malfoy gave a quick nod in response. He glanced towards Teddy and winked before striding out of the door to the back garden.
With a burst of speed, they both rushed towards the lilies, Teddy’s giggles echoing throughout the garden.
“Well, they’re getting more serious, aren’t they?” Ron shrugged, turning to look across the pitch at where Jesse was talking with Ginny and Angelina. “I mean, he’s being
Harry wanted to say something suave, something that would make Draco fall apart, trembling with desire. He wanted to say something that would make him seem
A deep chuckle echoed throughout the room as the shopkeeper grinned widely, “Oh, don’t you worry, son.”
George smirked, eyes sparkling with mischief, “Ah, yes, of course. Who else could it possibly be but your favorite Slytherin?”
Harry shook his head, pursing his lips as he placed his cleaned plate to the side to dry. He grabbed a handful of cutlery and dropped them into the sink, reaching in to begin scrubbing at some spoons.
. The more he thought about it, the more Harry realized Andromeda often had tedious requests for him when he first arrived;
Harry rolled his eyes, sticking his tongue out at Draco as he made his way towards them. “Merlin, yes, we can go.”
“Yes, right. Any time,” Harry mumbled. Draco gave him one last inquisitive glance. He turned to kiss Teddy and Andromeda once more on the cheek before gracefully grasping a handful of Floo powder and stepping into the flames.
Dragging his hands over his body, Harry tried to wash away the lingering aroma of coffee and pastries from his skin. He didn’t need Malfoy judging him more than normal, and he certainly would if Harry showed up for lunch smelling like a café.
. You lean back into the comforting embrace, fingers grounding you as they wrap around your forearm.
Harry inhaled sharply as he was pulled into Malfoy’s hard body. He glanced down, staring at the pale fingers that held him firmly, swallowing thickly at the heat that reverberated from the other man’s body. He had always thought that Malfoy would be cool to the touch, but as soon as they were close, the warmth that encompassed Harry made small beads of sweat begin to form, dripping slowly down his lower back. He bit his lip.
at him. With a heavy sigh, Harry swung his legs over the arm of his chair and took a deep sip of his drink. “No, ‘Mione. I haven’t. But...well, he may not be up to something. At least...not like I first thought, anyway.”
Harry rolled his head against Draco’s shoulder, hooded eyes flickering across Draco’s face until their gaze caught. Silver eyes burned as they stared back at him, warm breath panted across his lips.
“Hey!” George cried out in defense, while Ron and Ginny laughed uproariously. The group swiftly dismounted and made their way towards the home. Ginny wrapped her arm through Jesse’s, smiling brightly at her boyfriend as they walked past Harry and entered the Burrow. Ron and George shoved at each other, stumbling as they approached, before catching Hermione’s raised brow and grinning sheepishly. George snickered and rushed inside while Ron placed a chaste kiss to Hermione’s cheek. Hermione rolled her eyes, smiling fondly, before they turned to join everyone for their meal.
“Yeah!” Teddy’s voice exclaimed loudly. Harry could envision Teddy, shuffling around as he tried to contain his excitement in his small body. “Okay, let me try another.”
Not that he would have even stood a chance, of course. He had only just realized he was even interested in Draco...let alone what he might
“I finished work early, figured I would come straight here,” Harry turned his gaze back to Andromeda, offering a sheepish smile. He normally didn’t arrive at her cottage until just before she left for France.
Harry turned to look back at Teddy sitting quietly on the ground, gazing up at Harry with bright silver eyes. Gary sat primly next to him, watching Harry intently.
“Are you sure?” Harry questioned, sucking at Draco’s neck as he rolled his hips against Draco’s plump arse, half hard cock sliding between his thighs. Draco groaned, arching his back and pressing against Harry.
Teddy was sat on the counter, legs swinging and heels tapping against the cupboards. Tears were still streaming down his flushed cheeks, soft huffs of breath escaping as he tried to control his sobs. Next to him, Malfoy was laying out a variety of vials on the countertop, whispering words of reassurance as he did so.
“Er...” He hesitated, grimacing as Teddy’s eyes began to glimmer, silver irises highlighted by tears. Harry was never good at remaining calm when Teddy began to cry, often resorting to whatever necessary to make his godson happy again.
Malfoy scoffed, “Oh? And are you sure he was not just trying to manipulate you? If I recall, you were always prone to fall for a needy act. Maybe he asks you to get what he wants because he knows you’re the one who will bend?”
With Draco’s reassurance, Teddy’s eyelids fell heavily as sleep overcame him. Carefully, Draco extracted himself from Teddy’s hold. Harry approached, stopping by his side and brushing Teddy’s blond fringe from his forehead. He leaned forward, pressing a gentle kiss to the boy’s head—overlapping where Draco’s lips had only just been—before pulling back and meeting Draco’s sharp gaze. Draco stared at him, eyes bright and unwavering. After a moment, Draco turned to tuck the blankets carefully around Teddy’s body. He brushed his fingers against Teddy’s cheek, lingering as a blond lock of hair curled around his finger, then gracefully turned and made his way out of the room, gesturing quietly for Harry to follow.
“Well, his schedule is quite sporadic, and he doesn’t like to be unprepared,” Luna explained with a shrug. “And if he has plans with Teddy the following morning, he never goes out. He is very adamant about not being indisposed when he spends time with Teddy.”
“How are you feeling, Tedward?” Draco asked quietly, staring at the boy with concern written plainly across his face.
Draco rolled his eyes, snorting out a rather undignified huff of laughter. “I’m fine, Weasel. Scurry along now, why don’t you?”
Harry blinked, uncomprehending. Malfoy worked at St. Mungo’s...as a Healer? It certainly explained how readily he was able to soothe Teddy and why he had dittany so close at hand. But...it was
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, losing himself for a moment as he stared into the flames of the hearth. And maybe he
“Are you quite certain?” Draco asked. “Only I could have sworn that Ginevra’s invitation specified a 10:00 arrival. I do believe we have nearly half an hour until our presence is required.”
“Alright, Tedward. It has approximately 35 minutes to crisp. Go ahead and add the crumble to the blackcurrant now, and then we can add it to the oven as well.” Malfoy instructed, his voice soft and encouraging as he stood back up and watched as Teddy began to sprinkle the crumble over a dish to his side.
You turn your head, nuzzling into the solid warmth behind you. It helps, you think, as hands grab your hips, holding you down.
The Kneazle meowed, pink nose twitching as it scented Teddy. Hesitantly, it stepped forward, resting its front paws briefly on Teddy’s legs before lifting itself into the boy’s lap. It paused for a moment before arching up, purring loudly as it rubbed itself underneath Teddy’s chin.
A deep, violent shudder reverberated throughout Harry’s body as he moaned. His cock throbbed, sticky cum spilling over his fingers in his release. Harry panted as his body began to slump against the tile, steam caressing his heated skin as he came back to himself slowly.
The welcomewitch’s eyes widened as she watched Teddy, astonishment clear across her face at the young metamorphmagus before her.
“Excuse me?” Malfoy questioned, his voice cold as he turned to stare at Harry. “Precisely what do you mean, Potter?”
Turning his gaze back to Teddy, Harry saw his godson’s hair slowly start to morph. The tips of his messy curls began to lose their color, all pigment leeching out from tip to root until all that remained was platinum blonde. Curls lost their bounce, straightening out to a loose, barely-there wave, light from the windows reflecting from the strands.
“Okay, yes, maybe at first I...I suspected something, but—“ Harry hesitated, grimacing as his gaze flickered towards the door to the garden, where he could hear Teddy’s voice as he played. “Well, I don’t now. Alright?”
Teddy quickly swallowed a mouthful of blackcurrant crumble before grinning up at Andromeda. “Goodbye, Nana! Say hello to Aunt Cissy for me.”
Harry’s jaw dropped, lips parting in surprise, as he stared at his godson. The last he had seen, Teddy had only just begun to morph into other people that he knew. But this—morphing into a
“Well...” Teddy took a deep breath, smiling sheepishly as he shrugged one shoulder. “Actually, his name is Garfield Lasagnaface McWhiskers. But I think he’d prefer just going by Gary.”
Yet, as Harry watched Teddy rub his nose against Gary’s, pure bliss reflected in his gap-toothed grin, Harry couldn’t regret his decision.
“Yeah…” Harry took a lazy sip of his drink before gazing curiously at Ron. “Y’know, Ron...you never actually told me how you saw Malfoy on a regular basis—with his special
“You okay?” Draco asked, pressing a kiss to the hollow beneath Harry’s ear and draping himself over Harry’s body, his hard cock rubbing between Harry’s cheeks, catching on his rim and pulling a stuttered groan from him.
Malfoy began to straighten while levitating the rhubarb crumble from the oven to cool and replacing it with the blackcurrant crumble. Harry quickly snapped his gaze back, face flushing as he realized he could have been caught staring.
Harry paused, taken aback. There was no way Malfoy was telling the truth. Harry came to Andromeda’s cottage every Saturday afternoon to pick Teddy up and bring him to Grimmauld Place, where he would spend the remainder of the weekend while Andromeda visited his sister. He would have known if Malfoy was there, too. He would have seen him before this.
“Er...okay,” Harry mumbled. Draco spun around and stormed down the hallway. He was only gone for a few moments before the welcomewitch scurried down the hallway. She barely spared a glance at him before entering Teddy’s room.
“Bye, Nana!” Teddy waved, watching his grandmother as she tossed Floo powder into the hearth, calling out for Narcissa’s flat and disappearing in a burst of green flames.
’ card, since the man refused to follow the rules of the game and insisted on looking directly at the other player, throwing the card down before declaring loudly and unapologetically
am counting this time.” Harry stated, narrowing his eyes suspiciously at his godson. “No cheating. You have to win fair and square.”
But, Harry couldn’t look away from the photo. The evening light shone off of Malfoy’s platinum hair as he leaned in to the man standing next to him. The man was older, tall with chestnut brown hair and dark, sparkling eyes focused solely on Malfoy. He leaned in close to Malfoy—too close to be mere acquaintances—before the photo looped to the beginning.
“No. C’mere,” he slurred, pulling Draco towards him as soon as his fingers intertwined with Draco’s.
Painstakingly, Harry made his way inside, following the light coming from the kitchen. Teddy’s excited voice was accompanied by Andromeda’s and Malfoy’s softer tones as their conversation filled the room. He paused just outside, taking one last deep breath before crossing the threshold.
Draco lifted his hand from Harry’s chest, fingers twisting into Harry’s curls, holding him in place as he darted forward, bringing their mouths together in a wet kiss. It quickly shifted, from open-mouthed and passionate to merely breathing into each other as Draco’s thrusts began to quicken and his hand wrapped around Harry’s cock, pulling at it and swiping his thumb across the wet head every few strokes.
“Harry,” she began, frowning at Ron before turning to focus on Harry, “I don’t mean to sound...disbelieving. But why, exactly, do you think that Malfoy is up to something? He hasn’t done anything suspicious since the war. In fact, he’s been rather...decent, as far as I am aware.”
Harry cleared his throat awkwardly, “Anyway, I just mean that he seems really hurt. He won’t let me help, and he’s in such pain, I thought that maybe it was serious...you know, that he’d need multiple healers or something?”
“Yes, yes. I need Healer Malfoy. Now.” Harry dismissed any pleasantries. He did not have time for them. They needed Draco.
Malfoy huffed, shaking his head in exasperation, as he waved a hand and the music stuttered, beginning once more from the start.
“Articulate as ever, Potter,” Malfoy reached for the dessert on the counter, deftly spreading the crumble evenly throughout the tin and fixing any damage that Teddy had done to it.
Malfoy gave one last smile towards Teddy before striding out of the kitchen, nodding briefly to Harry as he passed. Only a moment later, they heard the roar of the hearth as Malfoy Floo-ed away.
Of course Ginny would have talked to Hannah already. Harry would not have been surprised if Ginny had some kind of surveillance hidden in the café, just waiting to watch for the moment Harry quit. She always had been ruthless when it came to winning.
“He is my friend,” Luna said, gazing intently at Harry. “He is quite busy. In fact, we only ever spend quiet moments together, tea and dinner. I have invited him to our group outings but he has always had other obligations and denied the invitations.”
Harry’s ankles had already tangled between Mafloy’s as he tripped, and within moments they lost their precarious balance and fell to the floor.
“You’re sure?” Harry questioned, turning his body towards Malfoy. He didn’t know why he suddenly wanted to make sure that Malfoy was not upset that he would be taking Teddy early, but he did.
“Draco...” Teddy whispered, tugging gently at Malfoy’s finger, clutched in his small fist. “Remember...Nana said to behave.”
Ginny sighed heavily beside him, “Alright, fine. Shall I tell you about my week, then?” Without waiting for Harry to respond, Ginny continued. “Well! The Quidditch Camp was such a success that we have decided to make it a regular event.”
, so surely he was wrong. Malfoy released a slow breath before nodding, “Alright then, Potter. I will stay. For Tedward.”
“Anyway, if he has these pack bonds with you, Teddy is going to want to instinctually do whatever is within his means to help strengthen those bonds—not only the bonds that he has himself, but also those between whom he considers his pack,” Hermione stated, “A pack is a family—a familial unit, as I said. You and Malfoy calling each other by your given names will only strengthen that bond for Teddy.”
Ron and Hermione stared at him across from their table littered with Auror and Wizengamot case files. They exchanged a glance, before Ron looked determinedly out of the window and took a sip of his tea. Hermione inhaled deeply and carefully setting her cup in front of her.
“But...” Teddy frowned, brows furrowed in confusion. “But you weren’t in the guest room...” Harry choked, coughing awkwardly as Draco threw a narrow-eyed
Draco’s lips began to curl in a coy smile, his left cheek dimpling handsomely. The tip of a pink tongue darted out, leaving plump lips glistening in the light, tempting, and
Harry smiled quickly towards Andromeda as Teddy’s small hand grasped his own and began to pull him towards the sitting room.
Andromeda’s lips twitched, as if she were holding back a laugh. Humming, she stood gracefully and made her way towards Harry. As she reached him, Andromeda gently grasped his hands between her own and pressed a soft kiss to one cheek and then the other.
“Why’d you yell at Malfoy?” Ron asked. His back was turned as he continued to stir the stew, eyes focused on the steaming pot in front of him.
“Teddy! Are you alright? What’s wrong? Where are you hurt?” he asked frantically, hands hovering shakily over Teddy’s body as it curled into itself.
“Are you sure that he’s healed enough for this?” he asked, keeping his eyes on Teddy, who was introducing himself to the other children.
Teddy flung his arms around Draco’s neck, tugging him close and burying his face in the man’s neck, turquoise hair darkening rapidly to an inky black. Although they were too far away for Harry to overhear anything, he could see them whispering to one another before Draco pressed a gentle kiss to Teddy’s forehead and pulled away.
“But he’d love it, wouldn’t he? He’d be so impressed!” Harry knew that voice too, high with excitement. “And if I can look like a
“I suspect that Teddy has the same pack bond that werewolves have—recognizing those who he is close to as family and pack,” Hermione began excitedly, “His strongest bonds would likely be to Andy, Harry and Malfoy. Then he may have lesser bonds to others he is close to—”
Movement behind Draco caught Harry’s attention, and he reluctantly pulled his eyes away, stiffening when he found himself staring directly at Jesse.
Malfoy’s thin, pink lips parted on an inhale as he slowly shook his head from one side to the other. “No.
,” Teddy pouted, sticking his lower lip out dramatically and letting it tremble. His hair swiftly began to lighten, bleached of all color; amber eyes morphed to hazel, seeming to waver as if unsure of which hue they should settle on. After a moment, Harry huffed out an amused breath.
Draco’s breath hitched, and Harry raised his gaze to meet Draco’s wide-eyed stare. Harry licked his lips, eyes flickering across Draco’s face, before settling on his lips, reddened from where Draco had been chewing at them.
“Oh...” Harry coughed lightly, shoving his hands into his pockets as he watched Malfoy cork the vial of dittany. “Er...how do you know that?”
“Of course not,” Malfoy frowned. His eyes flickered between Harry’s eyes and his mouth briefly before icy silver met glittering emerald—challenging. “Why don’t you explain it to me, Potter.”
He must think the cooling charms were malfunctioning as well, Harry thought as he chewed at the inside of his cheek and looked away once more.
“Yes, Potter?” Malfoy questioned, laughter clear in his smooth voice, waving a hand in a quick circle in front of him as if to indicate that Harry now had permission to continue speaking.
Draco’s eyes sparkled as he stared at Harry, left cheek dimpling, flush spreading to the tips of his ears. Harry couldn’t help but grin as Draco nodded. “Another time.”
“So I’m ‘Potter,’ now, am I?” Potter chuckles, leaning forward and nipping at your collarbone, sucking at the skin.
“So what?” He frowned, flummoxed by Ginny’s amusement. “You already know he’s a metamorphmagus.” He turned back towards Ron and Hermione for support, since they had all
Harry’s gaze flickered to his side to observe the man, raising an eyebrow suspiciously. They had come in to

charm on what was left on the crumble—certain that Teddy would request more in the morning, claiming that since it had both fruit
Teddy rushed back towards his cousin, situating himself on Malfoy’s feet as he wrapped his small hands around slender hips, gazing up expectantly, “Come
Malfoy’s eyes flickered across Harry’s face. They seemed to pause, briefly, near Harry’s lips, but snapped back up to Harry’s eyes so quickly that he could not be sure.
Malfoy turned his head slowly, platinum blonde hair glowing in the light shining through the window, before raising an eyebrow and meeting Harry’s eyes defiantly.
“It’s okay, Ferret. We understand,” Ron interrupted, his nails stabbing into Harry’s arms as he tilted his head towards the Apparition point. “Go ahead, save lives and all of that. We can handle this lot.”
! Whatever it is you’re calling him now.” Ron’s voice was high, a mixture of hysteria and exasperation.
Sunlight filtered in through the windows, highlighting Teddy’s exuberant face as he laughed, the bright turquoise strands of his hair as he twirled around on Malfoy’s graceful feet. Harry gently bit at his lip, entranced. Teddy’s pure delight drew him in, but he found that it was Malfoy’s expression that was mesmerizing.
Harry hummed, ruffling Teddy’s hair as he sprawled across the armchair. Gary meowed at him, jumping onto Teddy’s lap and purring loudly as he settled.
as he turned and fled from the sitting room. It sounded as if Andromeda laughed behind him, but it was so light that he couldn’t be sure. His cheeks were aflame as he walked towards the kitchen, though he did not know why. Surely, Andromeda knew that he would be here to see Teddy.
Her robes billowed out behind her as Andromeda swiftly made her way from the sitting room. Harry could hear her gather her trunk before a distinct
Andromeda’s Parisian nose wrinkled as she grimaced, before giving Teddy one more gentle push out of the room. “I’m afraid toasties will have to wait for Draco’s return. We will eat a proper meal, don’t you worry.”
Malfoy pursed his lips briefly before kneeling down in front of Teddy like he had in the kitchen. “You know that I would not leave if I did not have to.” His long fingers reached out, gently caressing Teddy’s round cheeks before lifting his chin so that they could look at one another. “You will have a marvelous time with Harry, and I will see you in a couple of days, alright?”
“Why wouldn’t he?” Ron asked, chuckling as Teddy made a particularly daring turn and whacked George’s head with his foot in the process.
around, speeding towards Teddy as if his godson were the snitch in a championship game—everything on the line.
“Ah, of course.” Andromeda nodded sagely, blinking thoughtfully as she stared at Harry’s jogging bottoms. “Ginerva is quite competitive. One would think you would have realized it is safer to not bet against her.”
“Oh, darling,” Andromeda placed her tea on the table beside her, slowly folding her hands in her lap, “There is no need to pretend otherwise with me. I have known for quite some time.”
“Alright,” Teddy nodded, lifting himself to wrap his arms around Malfoy and burrowing his head against the man’s neck. “I’ll miss you.”
Instead, he strode inside and leaned against the doorway, watching as Teddy fell to the floor with laughter, Gary nuzzling against his neck. It had been less than one week since the two had seen one another, yet Harry could not ignore the clear connection between his godson and the Kneazle. He smiled softly as he watched them, crossing his arms and hugging his torso as the two rolled around on the floor.
Kreacher merely hummed as he turned back toward the counter, cleaning up the residue from the morning meal.
Harry rounded a corner, two figures finally coming into view,  sitting cross-legged in front of one another. Teddy’s back was towards him, his small frame wriggling around. Atop his head was a dark brown mop of curls, the same that Harry saw every morning when he looked in the mirror.
, for Andromeda to have so thoroughly distracted Harry every time he arrived early, preventing him from encountering Malfoy at all.
“Teddy, did you know that you’re morphing?” Harry teased, resting his hands on the boys hips and lifting him from the training broom. “If you want to convince us to let you fly higher, morphing into Draco would probably work better if you used that
“Oh!” Harry grinned, relaxing as he realized that they would only be speaking about Teddy—because after all, why would Andromeda ask about anything else? He cleared his throat, straightening in his armchair as he faced Andromeda. “It was brilliant. Truly, if you would like to visit Narcissa more often, I am happy to have Teddy stay with me! We practiced flying in the gardens. And you know about his Quidditch Camp, right?”
tell you,” Ron shrugged, propping an elbow on the couch and resting his hand along Hermione’s thigh, thumbing gently at the seam of her jeans. “It’s like I said...I see Malfoy at work pretty regularly. He’s normally at St. Mungo’s whenever I’m there. Don’t get me wrong, the ferret is still a prat, to be sure. But he’s an okay bloke. Heals me up all the time and doesn’t even say anything bad about me,” he paused, shrugged with indifference as he drained the rest of his tumbler. “Most of the time, anyway.”
Tripping as he stepped across the threshold, Harry took a deep breath, eyes focused on the fry-up that Kreacher was preparing for him. He groaned loudly as he sat at the table, staring hungrily at the cure to his still queasy stomach.
had put there nearly seven years ago. His fingers began to tremble as he reached out, gingerly tracing a thin scar that cut through Draco’s left areola.
Harry frowned, narrowing his eyes suspiciously as he observed Ginny for a moment, “...I can’t tell if you’re serious or not.”
Harry snorted to himself, lips curling in distaste at the paper as he clenched his jaw. It shouldn’t matter what Malfoy was doing on his evenings. Perhaps Andromeda would see the article and finally realize what a bad influence Malfoy was on Teddy, cutting off all ties with the man.
Harry chuckled, fingers wrapping gently around Teddy’s own, “He’ll join us soon, Teddy, don’t worry.” He squeezed his godson’s hand reassuringly, smiling when silver eyes met emerald. “Are you ready?”
Despite gaining on his godson rapidly, Teddy still reached the lemon tree well before Harry, thrusting his fists in the air as he yelled out in victory.
“What?” Teddy’s gaze snapped towards Harry, the Kneazle’s tail twitching as its sharp eyes followed. “But...but he wants to be mine. He does!”
Draco sucked at his rim, tongue flicking against him before darting forward, delving into Harry and loosening him, preparing him for
Drawing the handkerchief away from Teddy’s face, which was already devoid of any scratches from Gary, Malfoy placed the cloth on the counter and reached for his wand. Gently, he touched the tip of the wand to Teddy’s face, whispering softly as he dragged the wood along his cheeks. The air seemed to vibrate subtly, shimmering in front of Teddy, before being absorbed in his tanned skin.
“Excellent,” Ginny thrust her hand out for Harry to shake, agreeing to their terms. With only a moment of hesitation, Harry wrapped his hand around hers and shook once.
Before he could decide, Teddy reached forward, gently grasping his hand around three of Harry’s fingers. He gazed up, bright silver eyes shining as he whispered, “I like that we’re a family.”
“Draco!” Teddy launched himself at his cousin, wrapping his arms tightly around the man’s neck, much as he had to Harry mere minutes before. A noise huffed from Malfoy—Harry would call it a chuckle, if it were from anyone else—as he lifted Teddy into the air.
Draco slowly turned his head to Harry, raising an eyebrow before drawling, “I am certain I have no idea what you are referring to.”
Harry furrowed his brows, “Okay...so, basically, Teddy has some magical bond with Andy, Draco and me...?”
Teddy glanced up at Andromeda, eyes wide, and whispered, “I thought we weren’t supposed to do that?”
Perhaps his friends had a point—not the correct one, of course, but there was no doubt that Teddy’s features were
With one last chuckle, Harry tossed a handful of Floo powder into the hearth and called out for Grimmauld Place. He sent Teddy’s trunk through and waited a moment for it to reach its destination before following, holding Teddy securely at his side.
Malfoy furrowed his brows. His intense silver gaze roamed Harry’s body, and Harry felt goose-pimples erupt across his skin under the onslaught. His cheeks began to heat, and Harry’s eyes flickered to look at Teddy, who was happily adding more crumble than necessary over the blackcurrant tin.
The man would probably look quite intimidating, Harry thought, if not for the flush still painting the apples of his cheeks and the tips of his ears.
“Alright,” Harry agreed slowly, eyes flickering towards Draco. His lips were parted, lower lip plump from where he must have been biting at it. “Er...whenever you’re free, Draco. I’ll adjust the wards so that you can Apparate or Floo in whenever you’re free.”
Ginny sniggered as she pulled away from Draco, throwing an amused glance at Harry before continuing on as if nothing absurd had just happened. She nodded towards where Angelina was beginning to gather all of the children together. “We’ll start soon. The team will be running everything and helping the sprogs, but you’re welcome to fly on the outskirts and watch if you’d like. Ron said he’d be here as well, but who knows when he’ll actually show up.”
Hermione pursed her lips, shaking her head as she reached for the knife once more to finish dicing the vegetables, “Alright, Harry.”
Harry began to ladle the fragrant soup into bowls, one by one, before handing them back to their recipients. As he moved to pass Malfoy his dish their gaze met and held. Malfoy hesitated before reaching forward to grasp the bowl, cool fingers brushing briefly against Harry’s own, a stark difference from the heat of the soup. Harry bit the inside of his cheek and quickly looked down, ladling soup into his own bowl and sitting down.
“Well...er, Teddy and I practiced flying earlier in the week. Before his Quidditch Camp,” Harry said slowly, hesitantly, as he reached for his own cup of tea.
Harry growled, thrusting his hips forward. Draco yelped as he was thrown off balance, as Harry darted forward, rolling them so Draco was on his back and Harry caged him into the bed.
Harry huffed, reluctantly amused by the man’s affronted tone, “You’ve got crumble—or something—on your cheek, Malfoy. That’s all.”
An obnoxious snort sounded to Harry’s side, and he turned to glare at his best friend. Ron was sitting on the floor with his back resting against Hermione’s legs, who observed the other three from her perch in her armchair.
Teddy was trying to strengthen his familial bonds...he wanted to instinctively make him happy? But what did that have anything to do with him morphing into a miniature version of Draco—or a miniature version of
“I’m sorry, Tedward. I must finish my shift in the A&E. But I will see you later in the week, once your Nana returns from her visit to France. How does that sound?”
“Er...” Harry looked down at his feet, shuffling back and forth in place. “Ginny and I made a bet. She may have won.”
Just as he was about to pull the handle of his broom up, to avoid a collision, Harry caught sight of red hair glimmering in the distance, blinding in the morning light—
“Yes. Or rather, a Healer in Training,” Malfoy lifted one shoulder in a graceful shrug, a soft flush beginning to color his pale cheeks. “You must complete two years in training before you become a certified Healer.”
, at Malfoy’s smug face as he whispered to the other man. With a wave of his hand and a swift turn on his heels, Harry walked from the room, the paper bursting into the controlled flames of a wandless
Teddy dropped his overnight bag on the floor next to Harry’s face, rushing over to Andromeda and offering a sheepish smile, “Goodbye, Nana. I hope that you enjoy your weekend with Aunt Narcissa.”
Teddy raised his arms, his fingers grasping at the air as Malfoy stood up. Malfoy huffed a quiet laugh before bending down again and lifting Teddy up, shifting so that the boy rested on his hip.
interrupted me, I might add—what Tedward meant when he said that ‘we need to go’?” Draco asked, one pale brow rising in question.
“Yes,” Harry snapped, “Or...maybe. I don’t know! He’s probably teaching Teddy to morph so he can manipulate people and get what he wants, instead of working for it. That would be just like him!”
Harry drew a deep breath of air into his lungs, wincing as he slowly stretched on the floor, testing his movements making sure that he hadn’t broken anything when they fell. Feeling nothing more than what would surely be a rather brilliant bruise come morning, he sat up, grimacing at the ache of movement.
“Oh,” Harry blushed, shrugging awkwardly as he turned back to the sink, resuming rinsing the last of the cutlery. “Well...it’s rather soothing, isn’t it? Doing things by hand, sometimes.”
“Harry!” Teddy squealed, tossing the flour that he had clutched in his hands in the air as he jumped from his stool and rushed towards Harry.
Harry gazed up into Draco’s eyes, entranced as he watched pupils dilate, surrounded by a thin ring of silver, shakily releasing a breath he didn’t realize he was holding.
. I’m trying to protect my family. And I know that Malfoy is up to something, whether you lot believe me or not.”
Hermione reached across the table to gently touch Harry’s hand, as if comforting a distraught child. “Harry, are you sure this isn’t like sixth year? You’ve been between jobs again. Are you certain this isn’t just a way for you to fill your time?”
If anything, though, Ginny’s grin sharpened even more in her obvious delight. “Wonderful. Alright, then, Harry. I’ll bet that you don’t last one week working at Hannah’s.”
“I cannot believe that you bought Teddy a training broom,” Hermione sighed, shaking her head as they watched Teddy hovering in the back garden of the Burrow the following morning, George and Ginny crouching by his side as he began to maneuver around the obstacles they had created for him.
Harry and George watched as Teddy skipped over to the display, gently reaching out to pet the small creatures. After a few quiet moments, George raised a questioning brow at Harry.
“Harry.” Andromeda spoke softly at his side. Harry glanced quickly at Andromeda, who nodded towards the two blondes in front of them, an unspoken demand.
Harry glanced at Malfoy, whose porcelain cheeks were gradually beginning to flush. Regretting it almost instantly, Harry looked away. He did not want to see the smirk that would surely be painted across Malfoy’s lips as he prepared to mercilessly tease Harry.
Malfoy gently pressed his lips against the side of Teddy’s head, one hand rubbing soothing circles on the boy’s back, as he whispered back, “I love you, too, Tedward.”
Harry turned around, observing how empty the room looked now that he was the only one in it.  All of the furniture had been pushed to the sides, leaving an empty space in the center that would allow them ample space to dance. He could still feel whispers of Malfoy’s fingers against his hips, guiding them as they gracefully navigated the room.
Draco’s lips twitched, his cheek dimpling as his eyes began to sparkle. “That was not what I was questioning, but thank you for the reassurance.”
“I saw you five days ago. How am I a stranger?” Harry asked, swatting his soapy hand against Ginny’s thigh and leaving a wet mark on her jeans.
The space where Teddy had recently lost a front tooth gaped prominently behind his wide grin, before he turned to attack the remainder of his ice cream cone. With a fond smile, Harry finished his own cone as they made their way to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.
Malfoy’s eyes widened, his pale brows lifting, before he stepped closer to Harry. His cheeks were dusted with a light flush as he reached for Harry’s hand, one hand brushing gently at Harry’s hip, drawing him closer.
written across the arse in sparkling silver script. The bottoms were obnoxious, although Ginny swore they were the most comfortable things she had ever worn.
A low rumble echoed throughout Draco’s chest. His fingers drifted down Harry’s body, lingering at his shoulders, his side, the curve of his back, fingering the waistband of his jeans before dipping beneath and clutching at the flesh of Harry’s arse.
“Alright...” Harry nodded slowly, fingers itching to reach out and hold Draco’s hand in his own again.
“Don’t you?” Harry rasped. He was so close to Malfoy now, a subtle scent of citrus wafting up to him as he leaned closer. He could feel the heat of Malfoy’s body against his chest.
you’re not.” Ginny rolled her eyes dramatically. She looked him straight in the eyes, voice monotone, as she stated, “You’re the most observant person I have ever known.”
“No!” Teddy wailed, staring up at Harry with wide eyes, wet with tears that readily fell down his flushed cheeks. He sobbed, his breath quickening as he began to panic, quick huffs of air as he choked out, “I—want—
“Excellent,” Draco smiled at Teddy, and Harry’s eyes were caught on his face, focusing in on the single dimple that appeared on the man’s left cheek. “Now, why don’t you rest here while Harry and I step outside for a moment? I will ask Maggie to come sit with you, and I am certain she will offer a lolly, if you ask her nicely.”
Harry stumbled as Malfoy brushed past him, knocking his shoulder against Harry’s, and swiftly escaping the library. He looked at the entrance numbly. He had been in the right, questioning Malfoy as he had. He knew he had. Yet suddenly he felt as if he were perhaps missing something. His gut felt heavy as he turned and followed in Malfoy’s wake.
, Draco!” Teddy whined. He grasped Draco’s hand, picking his training broom up from where it rested against the hearth, and began to tug his cousin out of the room and to the gardens, where they would all Apparate from.
Once his feet touched the floor, Teddy began shifting eagerly from one foot to the other, eyes flickering between George and Harry. “Can I go look at the Pygmy Puffs now?”
Harry hummed softly, rubbing his thumbs against the tear tracks before running his fingers through Teddy’s dirty blond curls.
Maybe Malfoy really wasn’t so bad. He obviously cared a great deal for Teddy and Andromeda, and did not allow his past with Ron to prevent him from coming to his aid. If his response to Teddy being scratched by Gary was anything to go by, he was well suited as a Healer. Patient, caring, and gentle. Almost
Teddy shifted slightly, gazing up at the man desperately. “They do? But...how do their companions know?”
Harry stood still, watching as the flames dwindled, until there was nothing more than embers glowing in the dark.
Suddenly, Harry realized how close he was standing to Malfoy, one hand resting against his face in what could have been a caress if it was anyone other than
Harry’s eyebrows rose swiftly, his mouth dropping in awe, as he watched Malfoy and Teddy waltz around the room.
Food in hand, Harry spun on his heels, eyes wide as he stared at the identical expressions of shock in Malfoy’s and Teddy’s faces. Teddy’s hair had morphed to a light blonde, his stormy eyes a near mirror of Malfoy’s own. Both of their lips were quirked in bewilderment, pale brows furrowed above silver eyes. Except for his youthful, tanned face, Teddy was the splitting image of Malfoy.
But the early mornings and angry customers and scalding burns when he fumbled with the drinks was something that Harry was glad to be rid of. He had helped at Hannah’s café the past three days, and after an angry customer—Karen, if he remembered correctly—had thrown her drink at him because he had
Hesitating as he reached the front door, Harry knocked gently before turning the knob and making his way into the home.
, as he looked over at Malfoy. The other man paused in his task to stare at Harry, brows furrowed in confusion .
Draco blinked, wide-eyed as he stared at Harry, lips parted. His eyes flickered across Harry’s face before they settled, shining brighter than he had ever seen them, on Harry’s own.
Harry could feel his lips split in a wide grin as Draco flushed and looked away. He chuckled softly and turned back to Teddy.
“I lost control of my broom. We’re okay, Teddy,” Harry said quietly, biting back a wince as he knelt down next to his godson, rubbing a hand soothingly against the boy’s back. Out of the corner of his eyes, he could see Draco step forward to hold onto Teddy’s outstretched hand.
“Of course you are, Harry,” Hermione remarked, eyes beginning to glitter like they always did whenever she had a new insight or theory developing. “Don’t you remember that case I had a few weeks ago, and the werewolves that were contesting their pack member’s will?”
Harry sighed, glancing briefly towards Hermione before once again focusing on his godson. Teddy was clutching George’s hand and talking excitedly as they made their way back to the home.
Draco snorted, crossing his arms firmly across his chest as leaned back to observe Harry, narrowed eyes glancing down Harry’s body and slowly making their way back up.
Of course, the kitchen was warmer than it normally was, with the oven cooking both lunch and dessert.
She paused, refusing to meet Harry’s eyes and instead looking around the kitchen. Harry leaned back in his own chair, sighing heavily as he crossed his arms over his chest, narrowing his eyes, “Alright...that does not answer my question.”
. “Listen, Draco...I know that you probably don’t feel the same way. And that’s alright. But I couldn’t stand you thinking that this was something else—or that I liked
The worn fabric beneath your body—a chaise lounge that must have at one point been at the height of fashion—scratches at your skin.
Draco grinned, brushing a stray curl from Teddy’s forehead. He whispered something that made Teddy giggle, his own dimple appearing on his otherwise smooth cheek. Draco lifted his eyes to meet Harry’s, and Harry’s breath caught in his throat. He forgot about any pain that he was in as he stared into molten silver irises, warm and radiant in the sunlight.
“No,” he said, pressing a finger against Draco’s lips, “You should come with, Draco. Ron and Ginny like you. I’m pretty sure George does, too—although, to be fair, he may just like the drama of it all...”
“But I thought we were all having lunch together today,” Teddy whined, shifting to his side. Gary gave a startled meow, falling from Teddy’s stomach as the boy sat up. He stared intently at Malfoy, eyes shimmering as they slowly began to morph to an emerald green.
Harry hastily began to recount what had happened that weekend. Between how suspicious it had been that Malfoy was spending time with Teddy and Andromeda at all—let alone that he had been hand-washing dishes like a
Harry nodded to himself, convinced that he was doing the right thing by continuing to observe Malfoy. It was all for Teddy’s safety, and he could not be too cautious.
, “I will not have you speaking ill of Draco. Not in my home, and never in front of Teddy. You do not know the man that he is now, and I will not have you making ill conceived judgements upon his person. Do you understand me?”
“Well, sure, but I still don’t see how this is related to your new case,” Harry shrugged, “Teddy hasn’t shown any werewolf traits yet, just his metamorphmagus abilities.”
, Potter. After all, you’re just a failed Auror. Your investigative skills are rather flawed, if I recall.”
tone he used, Harry was not sure. Before he could spare a moment to think about what he was doing, Harry stepped forward, raising his own hand to Malfoy’s left cheek.
Teddy took a deep breath, leaning forward on his broom and staring, determined, at the lemon tree in the distance. “Alright. Three...two-
“Of course,” Malfoy nodded, swallowing thickly and  clasping his hands together behind his back so tightly that his knuckles turned white. “I was just—”
Malfoy furrowed his brows, tilting his head to stare at Harry as if he thought he were an idiot. Which...yes, Malfoy often seemed to think Harry was an idiot, if their shared history said anything. But Harry didn’t understand why he looked like that
“Well, it won’t be so bad. Kneazles are amazing creatures. I’m sure you won’t mind having Gary around Grimmauld,” Hermione smiled, eyes glancing towards where Crookshanks lay sprawled on an armchair.
“I don’t know, mate,” Ron hesitated, chewing on his lip, “You know I’m not a fan of the ferret, but I don’t think you need to worry about this. His record is clean, it’d come across my desk if he did anything.”
know. After all, Malfoy had certainly seemed different yesterday when he was dancing with Teddy—relaxed, at peace, and
“What’s a prostitute?” Teddy asked curiously as he looked between the two of them, grey eyes glimmering with a mischievousness that would have made Ginny proud.
Coughing quietly, Harry leaned against the wall, focusing instead on Teddy. Gary hopped onto Teddy’s stomach, circling his belly before curling into a ball, fluffy tail covering his nose.
It is quiet and dark, save for the crackling of the fire that throws a soft light across the room. Shadows loom in the corners, a threat lingering…
Harry swallowed and smiled shakily as he knelt in front of Teddy. He lifted the hand that Teddy was not clutching and brushed Teddy’s hair behind his ear, leaning forward to press his lips against his forehead—just as Draco had earlier.
Harry furrowed his brows, tilting his head slightly in question. “Er, yes? I didn’t know what to do...clearly, I was no use,” he started, shrugging absently, “You’re a Healer. Teddy wanted you...why wouldn’t I bring him?”
t-shirt that Ginny had deemed fit to complete his current ensemble, which was constantly rising up and revealing the dark trail of hair on his abdomen. He shrugged, trying to loosen the material that stretched across his shoulders, absentmindedly scratching at his collarbone, poking out from the deep V of the neckline.
Harry grinned, “Yeah, well...he kept glaring at me, and I figured it was because he knew how I felt. About you.” He ran shaky fingers through his messy curls, glancing away as he felt his cheeks begin to flush. “So I thought, why would he like me, then? When it was obvious that I wanted you.” Draco inhaled sharply, but Harry kept forging on. He could not risk stopping at this point and
, Harry thought, breathing deeply and smiling back as he watched Draco and Teddy make their way towards him. He was happy.
“No, you’ll see that I’m right about this,” Harry reached for the front door before turning to give one more glare to Ron and Hermione, both standing in the doorway to the kitchen and watching him carefully, “And for the record, I was
Andromeda hummed, nodding her head, bright gaze set firmly upon Harry. “Ah, yes. And how did that go?”
Malfoy perched himself on the edge of his armchair, staring intently at Teddy as he cried. He didn’t say a word, made no move to console the boy, and Harry began to fume.
Harry’s gaze flickered towards Draco, who stood stiffly with his arms crossed tightly over his chest. Harry noted how the fabric of his shirt strained against his biceps, before looking into stormy grey eyes that watched him closely, one pale eyebrow raised.
scar. Reverently, Harry ran a finger along the tissue before leaning forward to place an open-mouthed kiss against the scar, his tongue darting out to lick at the flesh that bisected the areola.
“Er...Malfoy,” Harry stuttered, gesturing a hand up towards his own face. “You’ve got something...just there.”
With a sharp tug, Harry was pulled from the kitchen. The two of them stumbled into the sitting room, Teddy bouncing on his feet as Harry reached for the Floo powder. His hands were clutching his overnight bag as he vibrated with excitement.
With nothing to do the following week, and all of his friends busy with their own careers, Harry spent the next few days trying to keep himself occupied—and attempting to keep his mind off of a certain blond, but failing miserably.
Draco suckled the sensitive skin at the crook of Harry’s neck as he rocked into him, pressing deeper with each thrust. Harry breathed heavily, reaching his arms back so that he could thread his fingers through silken hair, holding Draco close.
Harry slowly made his way through the cottage. He could hear muffled voices coming from outside. Realizing that the three of them must be in the garden, Harry strode through the kitchen towards the back door. He took a slow breath, steeling himself for whatever Malfoy might be up to, before stepping out.
Malfoy frowned, cheeks flushing as he huffed upon seeing his clean fingers. “Are you just fucking with me, Potter? Or is your eyesight truly that bad?”
Hermione. With a deep inhale, Harry took one peace of torn bread and placed it in his mouth, chewing slowly as he contemplated the table.
“That’s probably because he hasn’t been caught yet! Have the Aurors even been looking at him lately?”
Before long, they had a stack of bacon and cheese toasties, ready to be devoured. There was a pot in the corner of the hob, a lid sealed tight around it, steam slowly curling around its lip.
,” Harry gasped out, throwing his hands in the air. He was always helpless when Teddy wanted something. He wanted his godson to have everything that he never had, and if that meant adopting a Kneazle...well, then so be it. “He can stay at Grimmauld.”
Instead, Harry focused on Ginny—flying quickly towards them, Teddy held tightly against her chest and Ron following close behind. Within a moment she arrived, Teddy scrambling out of her arms and rushing forward, tightly wrapping himself around Harry’s legs.
Over the past few weeks, it had become clear that Draco regularly spent Saturday mornings with Teddy, giving Andromeda time to pack for her weekend trips to France without worrying about watching her grandson. He would make lunch with Teddy, clean up, and leave all before Harry was due to arrive.
The soft evening light reflected brilliantly off of the two blond heads, a blanket of calm embracing them, and Harry thought he could stay like this forever. It felt right, the domesticity of it.
towards Teddy and Andromeda. Not only had he appeared genuinely disappointed to leave their company, Teddy and Andromeda didn’t seem to want him to depart, either.
Harry’s tongue darted out to wet his lips, which suddenly felt too dry to speak. Draco inhaled sharply at the movement, a soft rosy hue spreading across his cheeks.
He would begin apprenticing with Rosmerta at the Three Broomsticks tomorrow...and, surely, it would be better than working for either Neville or Hannah.
The shopkeeper’s eyebrows rose steadily as he hummed. “That is a fine name, for a fine Kneazle.” Slowly, he began to shuffle back towards the front counter. “Shall we gather everything you will need for little Gary, then?”
“He is busy, love,” Andromeda turned back towards her garden in dismissal, fingers beginning to gently pull fresh tomatoes from their stalks. “Nothing you need to concern yourself with.”
. Harry snickered at Gary, whose claws clutched desperately at Harry’s with the sudden shift of location, fur standing on end.
After a hectic Sunday at the Burrow and a leisurely Monday morning, Harry and Teddy found themselves alone at Grimmauld Place on Monday afternoon. Or rather, as alone as they could be with Gary stuck close to Teddy’s side.
“It was a bruise.” Draco heaved an exaggerated sigh as he rolled his eyes towards the ceiling. “Merlin’s beard, Potter. Did you even look at his injury before bringing him here?”
“What a wonderful meal. The crumble, especially, was delectable. Marvelous job, darlings,” She nodded slowly, once to Malfoy and then to Teddy, each of whom smiled back with their thanks. “I must be off now. Narcissa has a full weekend schedule planned, and I mustn’t be late.”
Harry smirked, biting his lip lower lip smugly as he stared at Malfoy. The other man’s gaze seemed to dip, just briefly, to his own mouth. But it was too quick for Harry to be sure—it was certainly just a trick of the light in the kitchen as clouds shifted over the midday sun.
“You say that he is morphing without the ability to control it, correct?” At Harry’s stiff nod, Hermione hummed. “Well, what if it was not strictly uncontrolled? What if these morphs were instinctual in some way?”
“Good,” Harry grinned up at Draco, pleased when a light flush began to bloom across the man’s cheeks. Just then, Ginny circled above their heads before gracefully landing in front of them.
he thought, recalling how he felt as he cooked in Andromeda’s cottage, the warmth of the kitchen wrapping around him with the comforting smell of a home cooked meal. Maybe this new venture would be
“I’m going to beat you!” Teddy called out, leaning closer to his broom as he put on a sudden burst of speed.
“Fuck,” he whimpered, fingers digging into Draco’s shoulders as sharp teeth grazed the delicate skin of his neck, biting into the flesh and
oats it surely could be considered a breakfast food—and packed it for the quick journey back to Grimmauld Place.
Maybe he could also ask Malfoy for some advice the following weekend. The man seemed to know his way around a kitchen, after all. Surely talking to him about it couldn’t hurt.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, “As I said, I am here to visit my aunt and my cousin. Do you have a problem with that, Potter?”
“Teddy—” Harry sighed, watching as his godson’s eyes began to fill with tears, hair bleaching of all color to a striking platinum. He squeezed his own eyes tightly, trying to block the desperate image.
Malfoy gaped at Harry, his thin lips parting as he stared. Harry’s lips twitched in an amused grin, pleased that his response had inspired such an uncharacteristic display of shock from Malfoy.
Draco turned to watch as Teddy ran around the pitch, chasing a handful of other young wixen. “Well, then. I trust that you will take my professional expertise into consideration when I say that Tedward is perfectly capable of participating in this endeavor.”
“Wait!” Harry squeezed his eyes shut, holding a hand up in an effort to prevent Ginny from continuing. “No, we aren’t talking about me. We’re talking about you and Jesse. If he...Ginny, if he is seeing
A rosy blush quickly spread across Malfoy’s cheeks and the tips of his ears as he looked back down to his own lunch. Harry smirked with his victory, pleased that he had annoyed Malfoy so much that the other man could not look at him any longer.
“Fine.” With one last huff, Teddy  glanced forlornly at Harry and made his way to the sitting room, presumably to finish his morning reading.
The Kneazle let out a soft meow, rubbing once more against Teddy’s chin and burrowing its head into his neck. Teddy’s gaze froze, stroking calmly at the creature’s back, before he lifted silver eyes to Harry.
Harry laughed, kneeling down to catch Teddy in his arms and lift him into a tight embrace. Teddy wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, legs settling on his hips, as he clung to his godfather.
“They did not!” Harry hissed. Ginny merely snorted, placing her wine glass precariously on the arm of the loveseat as she sprawled back against the cushions.
Draco’s nostrils flared on a sharp inhale, pale brows lifting in surprise, cheeks pinking slightly. “Pardon?”
“Yeah...” Harry hesitated as he narrowed his eyes at his friend. He walked over from the booze cupboard, placing two fingers of Firewhisky next to her and handing one to Ron, who sat on the floor next to his girlfriend.
Harry nodded towards the stairs that would lead to Teddy. “You should go,” he whispered, “Teddy has been waiting.”
godson.” Teddy pulled back and squinted suspiciously at Harry, as if Harry were hiding something from him.
“What?” Teddy gasped. His eyes began to water, morphing quickly as he turned to gaze beseechingly at Draco, amber shifting to a deep, forest green. “But...Draco!” Teddy’s lower lip began to quiver, a lone tear making its way down one flushed cheek. He choked back on a sob, “I-I wanted you to tuck me in! And read
“Tedward!” Malfoy choked out. His voice sounded deeper than normal, hoarse. Harry spared one last glance at Malfoy before turning to see why his godson was being scolded so suddenly.
“Well,” George chuckled, tilting his head and smirking across the table, “This isn’t exactly the first time you’ve been preoccupied with Malfoy, is it?”
Teddy’s eyes flared, morphing quickly between amber, emerald, and molten silver before settling to a stormy grey, a thin circle of green enveloping his pupils. His fists clenched together, resting on his hips as he glared up at Harry.
Andromeda turned towards Harry, smiling warmly as she summoned the cups towards them, “Harry, my darling. We have not had a chance to speak since my return. How was your time with our dear Teddy?”
“What?” Harry snapped his gaze back towards Malfoy, who continued to look over Harry’s shoulder, as if he were searching for Teddy. He doubted that Malfoy would have to head to St. Mungo’s so soon, when it was still well within his regular time with Teddy. “Why? Are you on call at St. Mungo’s?”
“Draco—“ Potter starts, reaching towards you, but you push him away, scrambling off of the couch until your back is pressesd securely against the wall, where you can look Potter directly in the eye.
Harry hadn’t been this close to Malfoy since he had pulled him from the Fiendfyre five years ago. It felt like the heat of those flames were licking at him now as he stared up at Malfoy. Harry’s eyes flickered between Malfoy’s icy silver irises, trying to find the scheme held within. Movement caught his gaze as Malfoy’s tongue wet his lips.
“Oh, er...he’s good,” Harry nodded, reaching for the fresh loaf of bread in the center of the table and grabbing a thick slice. “We stopped into Magical Menagerie this weekend and I bought him a Kneazle. He loved that feral Kneazle I got down from Andy’s tree the other month so much, I couldn’t say no when he asked for one.”
Harry frowned, throwing a brief glance towards Malfoy to see if he was paying attention. He didn’t need Malfoy knowing about his personal business, after all. “Yes, just helping Neville get everything set up before he opens. I told Teddy he could come with me soon to see it, and—“
Ron had returned his gaze to Harry, finally ignoring the activities outside of the window. Hermione bit at her lip, head tilted slightly in contemplation as she stared across the table at Harry.
“Mm,” Draco hummed, eyes slanting to look at Harry assessingly. “And why would you want to do that?”
Teddy took that moment to look over at them, his turquoise hair shining brightly in the sunlight as he waved frantically before taking a sharp turn and chasing after an auburn-haired boy, screaming, “Jamie, wait!”
Harry squared his shoulders, brushing his fingers against his wand tucked away safely in his pocket, before stepping towards the back of the house where he knew he would find Malfoy corrupting his godson.
Harry and Teddy both turned to look at Draco, who stood stiffly between them, eyes wide. Draco looked between the two of them, before his eyes settled onto Harry’s own.
The smug prat—he was washing the dishes like a muggle just to get a rise out of Harry. That had to be it.
“Oh,” Teddy breathed out, legs folding under him quickly to sit in front of the small creature. “Hello.”
The cottage was quiet, Harry and Malfoy both frozen in awkward silence, while Teddy giggled as he dragged a piece of string across the floor for Gary to chase.
The shop was surprisingly quiet for a Sunday morning, with only a few customers perusing the products and laughing delightedly at what they found.  Teddy let out an excited yell and ran forward, his hair morphing to a bright Weasley-red, when he saw George standing by a display of Wildfire Whiz-Bangs.
“Do you doubt my expertise as a Healer, Harry?” Draco asked slowly, his voice low and monotone, devoid of any emotion. It was the lack of inflection that startled Harry the most.
“Alright, Tedward. Take a deep breath for me. Ready?” Teddy nodded shakily and Malfoy pressed the cloth tenderly against his wounds. A quiet breath hissed through Teddy’s clenched teeth as the dittany touched his skin. Teddy winced, followed quickly by Malfoy’s soothing voice. “Shh, it’s alright. You’re okay.”
“Er...he was late,” Harry tore off another piece of his bread, popping it into his mouth and chewing slowly.
, Harry grudgingly unrolled it, flipping through the pages with little interest until a photo caught his eye and he paused.
Malfoy was standing in front of the kitchen sink, arms elbow-deep in soapy suds that were beginning to overflow, a pile of dirty dishes stacked neatly to his right and clean dishes drying to his left.
“Something dark and cunning?” George snickered, “That’s why you’ve got to keep an eye on him, eh? Always up to something, that deviant...
With a quick nod, Draco shot up into the air, leaving Harry staring dumbly after him. He shook his head, laughing under his breath at the sheer absurdity of Draco and Ginny being...what, friends?
Harry nearly choked on his tongue. He felt as if all of the blood drained from his face, before flooding back in so quickly that he was certain his cheeks must have been as red as his best friend’s hair.
Ginny huffed, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear, “Draco introduced us, alright? You know he has been training in Emergency Healing. Whenever we are injured, more often than not we go straight to the Accident and Emergency Department. I’ve seen him there a lot and...well, we got to know one another. He’s not such a bad bloke now that he’s actually thinking for himself. Even Ron thinks so!”
Softer, perhaps. Genuine. It seemed as if every time Harry saw him with Teddy, he saw more of this side of Draco—patience and adoration evident in everything that he did.
Malfoy startled, his head snapping to the side to stare at Harry from where he was beginning to clean the dishes. His bright eyes were wide with shock, pink lips parted in surprise. Harry determinedly did not look back at him, focusing instead on Teddy, who gazed between the two curiously.
. Surely he would not be staring at Harry’s arse with that particular expression. One of disgust for the hot pink garment, sure, but...while Harry was not sure
Turning the knob, Harry let himself into the cottage. He could hear muffled laughter down the hall. They must be in the library, going over Dark Arts artifacts and ancient manuscripts.
“I have to finish my rounds,” Draco said firmly, voice cutting through the quiet like a knife through butter.
Draco blinked once, twice, his tongue darting out to wet his lips before speaking hesitantly, “Are you certain?”
“Oh...” Teddy deflated, his shoulders slumping in his disappointment. “But, you will come by next week, right? Do you promise?”
“Good heavens, Teddy. You would think you hadn’t just spent an entire week with your godfather,” Andromeda chided, though there was amusement clear in her voice.
“Nothing,” Harry repeated, furrowing his brows and returning his gaze to the sink. “Everyone else has been busy, is all. And I’ve been doing things around here. It’s fine.”
“What do you want?” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear, suckling at the lobe. “Harry...tell me what you want...”
Malfoy’s pale cheeks were flushed once more, and he was sucking at his lower lip, hooded eyes lowered. Harry would swear that the man was looking at his jogging bottoms, but this was
Shrinking his robes, Draco placed them into his breast pocket, before turning and pausing as his eyes caught on Harry’s.
Gods, but he had needed that. He bit at his lip, lazily smiling as he luxuriated in the last shivers of pleasure wrecking through his body.
Draco gasped and Harry raised his eyes, looking up at the man through his lashes, lips pursed around a tight nipple. Harry let his hands drift further, dipping below the waistband of Draco’s trousers, thumbing at the button. He raised an eyebrow questioningly, grinning sharply around Draco’s nipple when Draco nodded his consent.
Teddy skidded to a stop as he slid back into the kitchen, grinning broadly as he looked up at them, “Alright, is it time for crumble yet?!”
Harry set his drink aside, leaned forward, eyes intent as he gazed across the room at Draco. He parted his lips to speak, and—
“What the hell do you think you’re playing at, Malfoy?” he spat. Malfoy didn’t move, standing his ground, his shoulders tight and hands clenched by his side.
“Harry!” Teddy squealed, spinning around on his stool and nearly toppling off. Malfoy’s hands quickly reached out to stabilize him, seeker reflexes evidently still in use.
He thought he could hear Draco choke in the background, spluttering in an attempt to stop the conversation from progressing, before Teddy excitedly chirped, “Oh, no! Draco likes it when I have dark curly hair and green eyes.”
“Harry!” he yelled, tripping as he pulled himself from Malfoy’s steady grasp and stumbled towards Harry.
“Yeah!” Teddy’s hair began to morph sporadically, shifting so quickly between colors that it resembled a kaleidoscope. He bit his lip between his teeth as his hair finally settled, a deep rosy hue that perfectly matched his flushed cheeks as he shyly looked up at Harry between thick lashes. “I like that only you and Draco call me that.”
“Nope!” Ginny quickly thrust her hand forward, resting her index finger against Harry’s lips to prevent him from speaking. “No, you are going to
Determined to catch Malfoy in the act, Harry didn’t bother knocking at the front door as he normally did. Andromeda liked to welcome Harry into her home every weekend, offering him tea and biscuits, before he took Teddy back to Grimmauld for the remainder of the weekend while Andromeda visited her sister in France.
Teddy squealed in excitement. He reached for Gary, still gnawing at the string, and placed the Kneazle gently in his lap. Taking a deep breath, Teddy nodded. “Okay. Here I go!”
Draco’s nostrils flared and he inhaled shakily. Harry watched as Draco’s sharp Adam’s apple bobbed when he swallowed. After a moment, he inclined his head in a subtle nod.
Warmth spread through Harry as he watched Teddy hum contentedly, burrowing his face against Draco’s chest, as Draco smiled adoringly down at the boy, fingers continuing to run gently through messy blond curls.
Harry turned to look at Malfoy, who was staring at him with astonishment. The man raised his brows, gesturing sharply towards Teddy with a quick shake of his head. Harry frowned, confused by whatever Malfoy was attempting to communicate.
“Ah, and what was the job of the day this time?” Andromeda’s lips curled with amusement, her brown eyes glimmering mischievously.
Harry whimpered as Draco pulled away, but quickly forgot about it when Draco pressed the head of his cock firmly against Harry’s entrance. The resistance lasted for a mere moment before Harry relaxed, allowing Draco to sink into him.
, not with Ginny looking at him like that. Harry spared a quick glance at Ron and Hermione, who just watched him quietly, before turning back to Ginny.
“Of course he wasn’t,” Malfoy agreed. The room was quiet save for Gary’s purrs for a moment before Malfoy lifted himself from the armchair. “Don’t disturb Gary, Tedward, but I must be off.”
He cleared his throat self-consciously, wiping his hands against his jeans, before making his way towards the sitting room.
You laugh, nearly hysterical as Potter crawls up your body, hovering on top of you—emerald green eyes boring into your own dull grey.
With a jolt, Harry stumbled forward and made his way towards the dining room, to where his godson, Andromeda, and
“No...” Harry said slowly, frowning as he stared at the other man. “I don’t know why you know. Why else would I ask?”
“I’m coming, Tedward,” Draco responded, tilting his head towards the stairs, eyes staring heatedly into Harry’s own.  Slowly—
“You’re a brilliant cook, mate. I’ll bet this is it for you,” Ron nodded encouragingly, offering a lopsided smile as he stared up at Harry from the floor.
Their eyes caught, and Harry could feel his cheeks begin to heat. He licked his lips, swallowing thickly, breathing out a quiet, “Hey.”
Malfoy stood stiffly in the center of the room as he watched Harry fidget. His thin lips pursed together before he nodded in acquiesce, agreeing that Harry could stay.
“I love you, too, Tedward,” Malfoy returned the hug and placed a quick kiss upon Teddy’s cheek before standing in one fluid movement. He turned once more to Andromeda, “I will Floo before I arrive on Tuesday. Have a safe trip.”
