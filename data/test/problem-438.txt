Harry just blinks at him, his heart beating so fast he can barely breathe.
“Indeed,” Draco says, scrunching up his nose in fake mockery.
That… sounded more sensual than should be allowed.
Harry makes a choking sound as Malfoy bursts out laughing. He pulls him into another kiss that leaves Harry completely breathless.
(See the end of the chapter for
After another moment of hesitation, he quietly opens the book. “There was once a kindly old wizard—” He stops when Potter’s head whips around. “Stop staring, Potter. I thought this was what you wanted.” Draco can tell he’s biting the inside of his cheek. He doesn’t say anything but simply nods and wriggles into a more comfortable position. Draco sighs, mentally shaking his head. “There was once a kindly old wizard who used his magic generously and wisely for the benefit of his neighbours…”
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake! Nitwit!”
So, somehow, the thought that Malfoy might understand, implants itself in Harry’s brain and pushes him to try and see the bigger picture. In a way, Voldemort is both their enemy. Malfoy might be a Death Eater, but Harry’s doubts about his loyalty to Voldemort keep growing the longer he thinks about it. But… still, as long as Malfoy keeps working for him, he poses a threat, no matter his motivation.
Draco studies him for a moment, cocking his head. “Well, look who's finally come around. And it only took you twenty-five years to realise it. A fault confessed is half redressed, you know.”
“Besides, she’s going out with Michael Corner. Again.” He doesn’t know why he added the last part. It’s not like he feels resentful. If Ginny’s happy, he’s happy. It’s a shame they can’t be happy together, with each other, but some things just aren’t meant to be, Harry supposes.
“Oh?”
“What about the pictures? You were so eager to get them before.”
“Yeah, right,” Draco grumbled. “Keep that thing away from me.” He pointed at the koala as he slowly sat up and carefully backed away.
“Yes, for fuck’s sake,” Harry nearly yelled. This was almost as bad as being interrogated by Umbridge.
Draco busies himself with making tea, trying to shove every notion of humiliation and rejection aside. As if it wasn’t bad enough that Potter stormed out of the room as though he had been bitten by an Acromantula, Draco had to suffer through the added humiliation of being giggled at by a bunch of students, only to realise much later that Potter had left love bites all over his neck. Draco healed them on the spot. He didn’t want anything on his body to remind him of Potter.
Potter studied him closely and slowly nodded. “I know what you mean.”
Harry can’t help but close his eyes and let his head fall back when Malfoy starts kissing his neck. Oh god, his stomach feels all tingly and—Fuck! Harry gasps when Malfoy suddenly moves and plops down on top of him. Shit. If there’s one thing Harry can’t handle right now, it’s Malfoy straddling him.
Draco asks himself with a dreadful shudder. Then, with an equally dreadful feeling, he thinks,
It took a second for Harry to understand the screaming was an expression of happiness, that she was trembling with excitement.
“No, let’s do this together,” Potter says before Draco can finish. The crease on his forehead deepens; they would be so much faster if they talked to students separately, but Draco suspects Potter doesn’t trust his ability to listen. Typical.
Draco tries to back away when Potter pulls off his robes so forcefully, they tear at the seam.
He knows from experience that things can get interesting when Potter drinks. Potter was actually pretty hammered when he told Draco he doesn‘t only like girls, he‘s also into blokes. Draco remembers it as if it were yesterday. He nearly had a heart attack right in the middle of the club. Potter didn’t remember the next day, but he told Draco again, dead sober, two months later.
Harry drops his voice to a whisper.
“I vote Goyle,” Ron said, snickering. Dean nudged him in approval. Pansy shot them a deathly glare. “What, he’s not playing, anyway,” Ron shrugged.
“Alright. Because Slughorn sounded serious.”
“Oh, yeah. He just left.” Harry shifts in his seat at Hermione’s scrutinising gaze. He knows that look. “What? What are you thinking?”
“Potter!”
“You really want to know?”
Draco picks up the pace, his eyes rolling to the back of his head as heat spreads through him.
“No, nothing,” Draco smiles while mentally slapping himself. He hates backing down, but how is he supposed to do this? He can’t just blurt it out like an idiot.
, Harry thinks, and his jaw clenches. His hips snap forward, pushing against Malfoy and for a second, Harry thinks they’re going to fall over. But then, he feels Malfoy colliding with something and Harry quickly stretches out his hands.
Firenze shakes his head. “It desires what makes the powerful look weak and what’s lost on those who are content.”
Well, there’s still one last thing Draco hasn’t tried. It’s what he’s been avoiding all this time. His last resort, so to say. Honesty. The thought alone makes him shudder. Being open and honest about anything, let alone his feelings, isn’t exactly something that comes naturally to him. But he’s willing to try. For Potter. Ugh, he’s getting soppy already.
“There’s nothing wrong with Harry,” Weasley insists, but Draco catches something in his voice that makes him frown. Doubt. Weasley is probably defending him out of habit, but maybe there is a part of him that agrees with Draco after all.
When Draco hears what Dumbledore says next, he stiffens. It’s almost as if Dumbledore is talking to him. As if Dumbledore has read his mind.
“And sex isn’t?” Draco suppresses the urge to laugh. Potter seems a bit more serious all of a sudden.
“I just realised… I don’t want to do that anymore. I don’t like being an Auror and I was constantly hoping for something to change in my life. I’m tired of waiting. I don’t know what I was waiting for. Life is too short to waste it on something that makes you unhappy.”
Harry jumps when someone pounds on the door with such force, it seems like the whole room is quaking. Draco presses his lips together, terror visible on his face, as he quickly gets up and darts to the door. He opens it just a crack and scowls at the person on the other side.
“Maybe I’m the problem,” Potter mutters. “Maybe there’s something wrong with me.”
“What?” Potter looked confused.
“Oh fuck,” Draco chokes. The sensation of Potter’s tongue inside of him, paired with Potter’s fingers digging into his thighs is almost enough to make him come. “Fuck, Potter! Do it now. Please, I want—I want—” Draco buries his face into Potter’s groin.
“Suspected?” Draco echoes.
“Yes,” he whispers, the roaring thunderstorm of desire inside of him threatening to burst out.
“Imagine how good my tongue would feel on you. In you.”
“You probably knew that already.”
“Oh, Merlin, I wish I could see your face right now.”
Potter blinks at him with an unreadable expression. “Won’t that be bad for your business?”
Potter’s eyes flick to his lips and Draco feels his thumb caressing the corner of his mouth. “No.”
“Hmmm. You
The sparks intensify while the smoke does something very strange; it curls around Malfoy’s waist, drawing him closer to Harry.
“Malfoy.”
“Yeah,” Ron says defiantly. “You poke and you poke and you
“I guess,” Harry murmurs. “But the castle is too loud these days.” He gasps. “Oh!”
Potter doesn’t answer.
“Says the prat with the biggest hero complex in history!”
“How?”
“What?”
Draco only realises Potter is staring at him when he pours the last of the wine into his glass. He sits back, suddenly feeling a little too exposed. He shouldn’t have told Potter. He shouldn’t have said anything at all.
Malfoy shakes his head. “You’ve always had alarmingly horrid taste.”
“Whatever we’re looking for isn’t human,” Draco points out. “The centaur said so.”
“You do realise you can leave anytime, right? I didn’t ask you to be here.”
Harry’s head whips around and he almost falls out of his seat.
“Ugh. Fine!” Harry yanks his jumper over his head and gets to work on his trousers. He’s technically only obliged to show Malfoy his backside, but he figures he’d look pretty ridiculous with his arse bare and his jumper still on. He turns around and pushes the remaining clothes down.
“No,” Malfoy insists. “We can just…” He looks around helplessly. “We can just sleep here.”
“You kiss your mother with that mouth?”
“Um…” Harry’s gaze flickers down once more, drawn-in by the curve of Malfoy’s mouth. His own lips are parted, his breath coming in short gasps. Without knowing what he’s doing, he slightly leans forward until his lips are almost touching Malfoy’s. Almost.
“You are unbelievable!”
“Yeah, I’d be nervous, too, if I had to—”
With his heart thundering in his chest, Harry wraps his arms around Malfoy, pressing one hand against the small of his back, the other between his shoulder blades, and raises his chin until he finally,
Yes, it’ll go perfectly. It’s no surprise, of course. Draco put a lot of thought into his plan. It won’t be long now until Potter finally realises there’s only one man for him.
Sighing, Draco cupped the koala’s cheek and brushed his thumb against it. No matter how pathetic it was, the koala really was one of his best friends now. His smile faltered and his eyes widened when the koala stretched out its arm and put its paw on Draco’s cheek, mirroring his gesture. Something warm bubbled up inside his chest, mingled with regret and a deep sense of sadness. He knew he couldn’t keep Baxter forever. He knew the koala had to go back to where it belonged. And no matter how much Draco wished things could be different, it didn’t belong with him.
Draco wanted to snort and point out many people didn’t like their job. But Potter was in a position where he didn’t need to do anything he didn’t like, wasn't he? Or, maybe, he had so many obligations he secretly disliked, he made sure to get rid of the things he had control over.
“I—I don’t—” Potter slowly shakes his head. Draco can see the panic on his face. “I can’t—No. I don’t—I—”
Pansy and Blaise exchanged meaningful looks before turning their attention back to Harry.
“But— I… Really?”
The mattress shifts and Harry knows Malfoy is gone before he even hears the rustle of the curtain.
“Yes,” Dumbledore says calmly. “Madam Pomfrey has told me.”
“One we should discuss over breakfast,” Draco chimed in, hoping to break the tension. “Mother, why don’t you take Teddy to the dining room and Potter and I will join you in a moment?”
“What the hell is going on with you?” Malfoy asks. He sounds angry.
Draco wants to comment on it, but finds himself unable to. He has already wrapped his arms around himself, but that doesn’t seem to stop the shivering.
“Do you really mean that?” Potter asks.
“I had no idea you were so old fashioned,” Malfoy says with a raised eyebrow.
Malfoy slowly tilts his head and Harry feels his fingertips on his jaw, making his stomach flip. Harry opens his mouth and closes it around Malfoy’s bottom lip. When Malfoy lets his fingers travel down his chest, Harry is pretty sure he is about to implode. He lets out another moan and moves his hand, intending to curl it around the other boy’s neck, only to realise it’s still tightly wrapped around Malfoy’s. He squeezes it. In response, Malfoy’s lips part against Harry’s. Tentatively, Harry traces his tongue over his bottom lip, his heart hammering violently in his chest.
“I knew it,” Draco grumbled. The prat was too good at magic for his own good. That’s probably how he had ended up as a koala in the first place; his magic had probably taken over without him noticing.
“What?”
“Why wouldn’t I be?”
“What, you enjoyed that?”
“Well, too bad, because I love—”
“Ah, there you are,” McGonagall said, a warm smile on her face.
“Pfft.” Draco fakes a laugh. Since when is Potter so observant? Draco can’t let him know how right he is. Honestly, given the choices, touching Potter doesn’t seem as bad as losing face in front of him. It’s not like he
“Um, Malfoy?” Potter clears his throat. “Aren’t you going to turn around?”
He drops one hand to Malfoy’s hip, trying to fight the dizziness that threatens to overpower him.
“I see,” Draco said, annoyance ringing loudly in his voice.
“He’s my partner, and as such, I need him to be on top of his game.”
“Sorry, Professor,” he calls over his shoulder.
“Oh!” Harry closes his eyes, gripping the edge of the sofa. “I—I thought, um—”
Potter makes a noise that sends tingles down Draco’s spine.
Malfoy is rubbing his thumb over the slit in circular motions, while Harry concentrates hard on staying vertical. He removes his hand, every nerve of his body fixated on the motion of Malfoy’s fingers. He moves them lower, taking Harry fully into his hand and starts to stroke him.
“How could it be me?” Harry says heatedly. “It can’t be me! He hates me!”
“Come again?” Draco splutters.
Harry shudders once more when Malfoy brushes his fingers against Harry’s neck. He should be embarrassed that his body is so receptive to Malfoy’s touch. He should be embarrassed that he’s panting and staring at Malfoy’s lips. But somehow, that is the least of his concerns right now. He’s far more interested in the tiny mole on the right corner of Malfoy’s mouth. He’s far too absorbed in the sensation of Malfoy’s body pressed against his.
“Miss Granger.”
“Are you close?” Draco blurted.
“What? I—”
Who did Potter think he was? That wanker! He would pay for calling Draco a coward! Draco would prove to him he was anything but! If it was the last thing he would do!
“Still, Draco.” Luna squeezed his wrist reassuringly. “He’s obviously trying. You must be very important to him.”
“M—Malfoy?” he stammers, not believing his eyes.
Potter didn’t answer. He was staring at his hands.
“How do you figure?” Potter retorts, placing his elbows on the table with an amused smile.
As he turns his head, he sees Potter’s expression go from bright and open to shocked and worried.
“Why don’t you just wait for one of those waiters to come by? You’ll miss Potter if you go to the bar now,” Blaise said, without looking at Draco.
“My what?”
Completely taken off guard, a gurgling sound escaped Draco’s throat, which turned into a cough, which, in turn, made Potter laugh.
“Cruci—”
“At first,” Draco begins slowly, “it was about proving myself.” He peeks over at Potter, who’s staying completely still. “I thought it was the best way to show the Wizarding World that I wasn’t who they thought I was. Believe me, no one was more surprised than me when I discovered I actually liked what I was doing. Well, after I completed the training.”
Weasley raises an eyebrow at him as a hint of amusement flickers over his features, while Potter covers his face with his hand.
This time, it was Draco who couldn’t hold Potter’s gaze. He stared at their joined hands in his lap, feeling like a fool.
Waiting for Potter to say something, to taunt him, is almost worse than if he had insulted him right away.
Malfoy has stopped eating again and Harry’s chest aches at the thought of how thin and weak he must be getting. He doesn’t seem to be sleeping well either. After listening to him toss and turn for a few nights, Harry concludes he must be having nightmares.
“I can’t believe—” Potter starts pacing. “What else did you do?”
Harry agrees.
“Still, I’m sure we could—”
“He asked who the treacle tart was for. And I don’t think he believed me when I said it was just for me.”
Draco hears Potter taking a deep breath. Yeah, this is a lot to take in.
Potter visibly relaxed and resumed stroking Draco’s hair. “I guess I was a koala for too long,” he said pensively.
“Call it a hunch,” Malfoy says, raising his chin. “I couldn’t care less. What I do care about is for you to stop focussing all your energy from being lovelorn on people who want nothing to do with you.”
“Actually,” he begins, “only my closest friends do.” He eyes Malfoy carefully and feels his palms getting sweaty. “Did you— Did Hermione tell you? Did you ask her?”
“Teddy! Why aren’t you with your auntie in the dining room?”
“However long it will take for you to like me,” Malfoy says casually.
“Draco.”
“Very well,” McGonagall said in her usual stern tone, but when Draco caught her eye, he noticed they were much warmer than he was used to. “You’ve done well, Malfoy,” she said. “I’m looking forward to welcoming you to the staff.”
“You sent her a letter?” Malfoy asks, turning to Harry.
“I don’t know,” Potter shrugged, “after two Firewhiskeys you might get the chance to run your hands through my
He catches his eye across the hall and pauses. Something is different. There’s no venom, no glee, no… anything. He looks deflated, resigned, as though just sitting there is too much of an effort.
Harry gulps when he hears Malfoy… do something behind him. Is he seriously taking off his clothes? Merlin!
when Potter utters another moan. Mentally cursing, he places the cloth on the Gryffindor’s head. Potter stirs in his sleep and the cloth slides down to his shoulder.
“Edward Remus Lupin,” Draco growled, to which Teddy gasped. He knew he was in trouble when Draco used his full name. “How—When—Did you steal that thing from the zoo?”
“Wait, you can’t use your fork,” Potter says and waves his hand.
“No! Please, Master!”
“Yeah, the training was a bitch, wasn’t it?”
Harry blinked. Well, that didn’t necessarily mean—
Unable to move, he watches in utter horror as Potter points his wand at his own throat.
“But—But—That’s—” —impossible, Draco wanted to say. Only, it wasn’t. Children accidentally using magic wasn’t uncommon. Draco closed his eyes and tried to stay calm. “So you’re telling me he’s been in your room this entire time?”
“Oh fuck! Fuck!”
“Blaise,” Draco fumed, storming into the living room, “what happened to the chest of drawers in my room?”
Teddy shrugged. “He went back to his friends.”
“You might be right,” Professor Sprout chuckles. “Irma loves her rules. I’ll be right back.”
“What was that all about?” Harry murmured. He gave Terry a puzzled look. The Ravenclaw just sighed.
“Careful,” he sniggers, grabbing the Niffler and tipping the bowl to give it better access to the water. “Do you think we should name it?”
Several heads turned to him, some of them, mainly the Slytherins, smirking. Oops.
“You don’t?”
“I was just about to make some tea, but it can wait.”
“Oh. Okay.”
“What do you mean, one of
“I didn’t mean— I was just— I—”
“Where will you go?”
“Oh, Harry. Now I almost feel bad. I thought—”
“I have absolutely no idea,” Potter answered, sounding ashamed.
Draco inhaled sharply, blinking at Potter as though he was seeing him for the first time. He opened and closed his mouth several times, but no sound came out.
“I wasn’t sure what it meant. And now—”
Draco’s eyes snap up when he hears Potter making a choking sound. His hands are curled around the branch that’s strangling him.
“Or I could… do other things.”
“Well, you know…” Potter hesitated, a small smile creeping onto his lips. “That we would end up liking each other.”
“Realised what?” Draco asked. His heart skipped a beat when he saw the look on Potter’s face; warm and tender.
“And what’s best for him, is being around his friends.”
Harry pauses, weighing his options, and decides to sit down beside him, rather than opposite him. He feels Malfoy’s eyes on him, but wordlessly takes out his Charms assignment along with his quill and ink bottle. He knows Malfoy is still looking at him, which he tries to ignore as best he can. To his utter surprise, Malfoy doesn’t get up and leave, there isn’t even a snarky comment; he simply gets back to his homework as though this is completely normal. Well, no, that’s not entirely true. Harry can feel the tension radiating off him, making him grip his quill a little harder in turn.
“Oh, Merlin,” he wheezes, shaking with laughter. “I wish I could see your face right now.”
“You knew?” Harry asks, sounding incredulous.
“Just go to St Mungo’s and—”
Harry’s frown deepens. Is he? Desperate and lonely? Is that why his body is unwilling to move? It’s the last thing Harry wants to admit, but this… feels kinda nice. Oh god, he must be going bonkers. But Malfoy is asleep, unaware of Harry’s crisis. So there’s actually no harm, is there?
Potter raises an eyebrow. “So… there’s nothing standing between us? Nothing awkward, or maybe something we need to discuss?”
They scowl at each other, hands balled into fists.
Harry can’t remember the last time he said that and actually meant it. Maybe he should start putting more effort into the lie because Hagrid doesn’t look like he believes him. But, to Harry’s relief, he takes a flask out of his coat pocket and turns his attention to the Flobberworms.
It’s almost amusing how Malfoy stares at him, like a startled deer, when Harry sits down beside him the next day in Potions.
The moment Draco tries to move, he lets out a whimper. Everything hurts. He tries to open his eyes, but the light is too harsh. He feels around with his hands. There’s nothing but pleasant softness. Oh, wait, there’s something else. It’s… soft as well. But different. And warm.
Draco’s jaw drops to the ground. “Are you being serious right now?”
“This all seems like a dream,” Potter whispered while his hand found its way into Draco’s hair. “I never would have thought…” He paused, his eyes searching Draco’s. “I never would have thought we would end up like this.”
“What? What’s so important?”
“Shit!”
“She kept talking about her pet turtle as though it’s her lover. I don’t think there would have been room for me in that relationship anyway.”
“You already said that,” Malfoy grins. “Twice.”
“Don’t you want to go outside… do something?” Draco said, after nearly dropping a vial.
“No, he won’t,” Malfoy says, his tone suddenly much sharper. “And if he does, I’ll hex him.”
Harry groans as Malfoy’s tongue slides against his, the warmth of his body seeping into him as though he’s soaking up the sun. Malfoy kisses like he fights, relentless and fiercely. It’s like he was made to take Harry’s breath away.
“So… how long have you been doing… what you’re doing?” he asks carefully.
“Yes. No. I don’t know,” Potter says, shaking his head. “He told me he was a virgin while we were fighting. I don’t think he would have otherwise. He said it was no big deal, but I don’t believe him.”
“None taken,” Potter grunts.
“Oh yes, the stickier the better,” Draco smirks. Potter wiggles his brows and Draco bursts out laughing. He watches as the thick, auburn syrup trickles down on his pancakes before the bottle floats back to its place on the worktop.
“As if I would let that creep anywhere near me. Well, I did a little, but he was so sloppy, I—”
“I see what you’re trying to do, Potter, and it’s not working. We’re not 15 anymore.”
“Would you… Would you ever take
That fucking twerp. Of course perfect Potter doesn’t make any mistakes.
“Draco, what do you want me to say?”
Draco was already panting, his chest heaving. It was only a matter of time before Potter— Oh no.
“Ahem.”
“Would you be okay with me being your first?”
“That’s not—”
Draco mentally cheers when irritation flickers over Potter’s face.
“You don’t have to hide anything,” Draco murmured. He waited until Potter slowly let his arms fall back to his sides. “And you thought this would scare me off?” Draco said, suppressing the urge to raise an eyebrow.
Their eyes lock and Draco cocks his head. Before Harry can say anything else, Draco buries his hands in his hair and starts kissing him as though they haven’t seen each other in days.
Malfoy shoves him and Harry almost falls backwards.
“Ugh, and why is it so itchy in here? Are you itchy?”
Harry feels a gush of air on his face, as though Malfoy just sighed, and then feels one tap on his hand.
“Take the blue,” he says. “Take the blue.”
Harry laughs in spite of himself and shakes his head. “Right, it’s only living creatures I’m supposed to take care of.”
His eyes snap open, his fingers digging into the fabric of the the other boy’s robes.
“Teddy, that’s not—Ew, he smells!”
Draco throws back his head indignantly, even though he planned on doing exactly what Potter just called him out on.
“Do you believe me when I say you’re forgiven?”
“On the circumstances. For example, if you were sick, I’d definitely want to keep cooking for you. And after you finished eating we could go upstairs and I could hold you and warm you until you stopped shivering. We could take a hot bath together. I’d make you some tea, get your favourite biscuits and I could give you a massage if you feel like it. But since you’re not sick…” Harry peered at his boyfriend from under his lashes and held back a snicker.
“What does it say?”
“That’s more like it,” Draco says, wiggling his eyebrows.
Draco wants to shout at Potter that it’s not true, but that would only put him in a more precarious situation, wouldn’t it? Because then he’d have to explain why he thinks he hasn’t been using Potter. Merlin, he can’t win.
“Thanks for taking me out, Hermione,” Ron murmurs. He sounds sleepy. “And sorry for getting us kicked out. I just can’t get used to not hearing anything. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I almost miss you bossing me around.”
Harry raises an eyebrow but nods. Before he releases Malfoy, he presses himself flush against him and looks him deeply in the eye. “I hope you’re not just all talk, Malfoy,” he says quietly. “Because I’m planning on making you come more than once tonight.” He quickly presses their lips together so Malfoy can’t see his furious blush. He turns on his heels and stalks away, unable to resist throwing a glance over his shoulder. Malfoy is flushed and staring after him. Good. Very good. In fact, it makes Harry feel lightheaded again and—
Potter is several feet off the ground, the Whomping Willow’s branches curled around him. The sight is absolutely horrifying, especially against the glow of the crimson sky; it looks like it’s about to rain blood.
“We better go,” Harry says as the tension rises to an almost unbearable level.
“Oh, is that why you haven’t been dating at all while we have been living together?” Harry thought about other signs there might have been that hadn’t seemed strange at the time. Wait, there was one thing that had seemed very strange. “Oh my God, is that why all the towels seem to magically disappear from time to time when I come out of the shower?”
It feels like he’s waiting for hours, the sound of the running water whooshing in his ears. Then, he hears something else. Malfoy is moving. But what is he doing? Is he leaving? Is he… taking off his clothes? Harry hates the fact that he just has to stand there and wait, completely vulnerable and very, very naked.
Draco is tempted to shove him.
“Yeah, sure. Is he still in your office?” Potter asks.
Malfoy didn’t even seem that surprised when Harry grabbed the collar of his pyjama and pulled him down onto the bed; in one fluid, elegant movement, Malfoy was suddenly under the covers, his arms around Harry.
“Yes?” Draco tilts his head a little more and buries one of his hands in Potter’s hair.
Resurrection Stone?”
“So… you remember the day we, err… started… dating?”
“Headmistress, are the students’ files in your office?”
Draco was so excited, he stayed silent for the rest of the night. He insisted on going to the bathroom first, so he would already be in bed when Harry came in. It still did nothing to calm his excitement. And apparently, his body was very, very excited about this. As soon as Harry slipped into bed and opened his arms for Draco, his mind went completely blank. He didn’t hesitate to press his body against Harry’s, wondering what he had done to get so lucky.
Satisfied, Harry puts his attention back on the logs. He peeks sideways every now and then, making sure Malfoy hasn’t moved and is still reading his book. Having someone this close while chopping wood isn’t ideal, but at least Malfoy is good at imitating ancient statues.
The moment Potter turns to look at him, Draco freezes. Fuck. So much for not blurting it out. But maybe it’s a good thing. Now it’s finally out and—
“Finally catching on, are you, Potter?” Malfoy wheezes. “This has got to be the best moment of my entire life.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “You call everyone by their surname, though.”
“If you’re going to call her chubby, I swear I’m going to—”
Potter’s left eye twitches. “I don’t want to talk about it.” Draco has rarely heard him sound so gruff. He stands up and walks over to his bag. “I’m taking the bed tonight.”
Penny seems to be offended by not getting a treat as well and starts squirming in Malfoy’s arms.
“You—You didn’t,” he stammers.
“What?”
“It was nothing.”
That was even worse! It made everything
“Malfoy, I said we’re doing this together.”
Getting angry at Potter and attacking him is a complete automatism at this point. He’s glad Potter is fighting back. He feels like he’s drowning in his own fury. This is the only way he knows how to deal with his feelings. But then, Potter suddenly hits the ground and it’s like Draco is slowly waking up from a dream. Seeing Potter lying there, panting, soaking wet, doesn’t make him feel better. It doesn’t give him the satisfaction it usually did. Not after having his arms around him. Now, it’s impossible to pretend his feelings aren’t real.
“I can’t— I can’t be sure.”
Harry’s pulse quickens. The horcruxes.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Can’t you just sulk somewhere else?”
Harry nods and notices the way Ginny’s hand feels on his. She has that same calluses he noticed on Malfoy’s hand. He mentally shakes his head at himself.
Harry nods glumly, and then jumps when he feels a warm hand on his.
“God, you arrogant prick,” Potter mutters. “You accuse me of having a death wish, then you go and almost get yourself killed.”
“Baxter! How the hell did you get here?”
“You know,” Draco said slowly, “you say that every time I ask you—”
“Please don’t make a scene,” Draco pleaded. “I’ll be back in a bit.”
“What? Magnolia, what—”
“I’m not,” Malfoy retorts. “I just don’t get it.” He shakes his head.
“No, mate, I’m fine, thanks.”
“Yeah, asked me a bunch of questions about Harry.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbles.
That only made Draco laugh harder. “Well, he’s right.”
Time suddenly seems to be standing still. Harry’s eyes widen and it feels like his heart is going to burst any second now. He’s pretty sure Malfoy can feel how hard it’s beating, and before he can get any more embarrassed, Harry leans forward, until their lips are almost touching.
don’t need magic to do this,” Draco said quietly. “I wanted to do something like that for him, too.”
Draco cocked his head and studied Potter’s face. How come he was so confident when it came to his animagus form, but so insecure about his true self?
“I think it’s nice he’s helping,” Luna says.
“Is that why you came here tonight? After you left and didn’t answer any of my messages? Vengeance? Really, Malfoy?”
“What was I supposed to do?”
“Ugh!” Harry stomps his foot, feeling less gratification than he hoped by having destroyed at least a few of these ominous fuckers.
“Harry Potter-Malfoy,” Draco said, as though he was correcting him.
“Sounds good.” Harry waits for Hagrid to lead the way, but instead, he casts his eyes down to the ground, looking a bit uncomfortable.
“What is this? A book?” Ron sounds sceptical. “'Why are we embarrassed by silence? What comfort do we find in all the noise?' Is this supposed to cheer me up? Great. Thanks,” Ron says sarcastically.
“Fuck, yes! Yes! Yes!” Potter’s body jerks against Draco and he lets out one last moan that sounds so filthy, Draco wonders if he should bottle up the memory of it, so he can hear it again and again and again.
“I mean, the attacks did happen after her encounter with the Whomping Willow.”
“Merlin, Harry, what did you do to him? I’ve never seen Malfoy mumble before.”
“You and Malfoy.”
“And in some Muggle cultures, certain types of trees are considered a symbol of grief. They’re even associated with the goddesses of death. And don’t even get me started on tree spirits.”
from scratch.” Potter’s tone is light, but it’s a little defensive, too.
“Wait, before I read it,” Harry says and takes the book from Malfoy’s lap. “You—you said you were glad you didn’t say it back.” He hesitates, hoping he’s not making a complete fool of himself. “But, um—”
“We made a lot of mistakes there, too.”
Malfoy blinks, still staring at the wall.
I can be.”
“Excuse me?”
“Um… I guess?”
“Oh. I see,” she finally said. “And how exactly does that correspond with you ‘letting me down’,” she said, putting emphasis on the last few words, to stress that those weren’t her words.
“Oh fuck!” Draco squeezed his eyes shut as he slowly pushed his cock inside. He paused halfway through, his head swimming. “Are you okay?” he asked, shooting Potter a worried look.
“What do you mean?” Draco said, still feeling dazed and confused.
Draco sized him up, deliberately keeping his face impassive. “Well, since you’re practically begging….”
“You’re in love with me? You’re
“You can’t kiss or touch me,” Potter whispers. “That’s what the card said.”
Apparently, Draco isn’t the only one who’s having these thoughts. The further they walk, the more uneasy Potter seems. Draco notices he’s walking slower, until he stops eventually and stares at the trees ahead.
“Forget I said anything,” Draco says with as much calmness as he can muster. “I don’t think we’ll find anything here,” he adds.
“Did you see him? Over the summer?”
He mustn’t let himself be crippled by his fear. His mother’s life is one the line; the Dark Lord made that very clear when he had told Draco what he wanted him to do, and had then tortured his mother with the Cruciatus Curse until she had crumpled to the floor, just to show Draco the potential consequences, should he fail. His mother was unconscious for days. While he sat by her bed, it had become clear to him that, with his father in Azkaban, he’s the only one who can protect her. He didn’t dare to leave her side after that. What a fun summer it had been.
, if the eager brush of his tongue and the tight grip on Harry’s hair is anything to go by.
“Malfoy, is that… yours?”
Draco couldn’t help but feel suspicious. This felt like a trap. But he couldn’t see where Potter was going with this, yet; he only felt sure the goal was to embarrass him. And post-cock-gate-Draco really wasn’t up for any more embarrassment.
By the time of his last two lessons of the day, Harry is in full panic mode. What the fuck is he supposed to do now? He enters the Potions classroom, hating his past self for partnering up with Malfoy; everyone else is already at their desks and there’s only one seat left. Of course. Of fucking course.
“Draco.” Harry walked over to him, placing his hands on Draco’s shoulders. Draco shrugged them off, only for Harry to grab his hands.
It wasn’t the first time he had dreamed about Potter. But never had it felt so real. Never had it been this devastating to wake up, to realise it had only been a dream. His cock seemed to agree. Apparently, there would be no need to take care of it.
The corner of Potter’s mouth twitched and he swiftly pulled down his trousers, along with his socks. Draco did the same, grinning as he caught sight of Potter’s pants.
“Who would have thought it would come to this?” Draco quipped, shaking his head. Potter seemed to regain his composure at Draco’s words.
“That’s not—I—Sorry, I didn’t mean it like that.” Harry slowly puts his hand on Ron’s shoulder. “And I’m sure Hermione doesn’t really think that. But I know how protective you get when it comes to Ginny and I—I—I do love her, but… it’s different now.”
Nobody has ever seen him naked before. He always makes sure to be quick in the showers after Quidditch practice, and some of his team mates might have caught a glimpse every now and then, but that’s different. He never presented himself to them, like he’s doing now, with Malfoy. He often wondered how someone would react to his body. Years and years of playing Quidditch have toned him, yes, but he’s still a little too skinny, still not that tall. He definitely doesn’t feel as confident about his body as he might seem. Speaking of confident…
Draco hates Potter for being right.
“It will be weird, won’t it?” Draco murmurs.
Potter nods. “I’ll do it now.”
“Um… I was thinking… I could turn back into a koala.”
On the way down to his cabin, he makes sure to find Hagrid and tell him to maybe stay clear of his house for the night. The last thing Harry needs are witnesses.
Harry grinds his teeth, trying to resist the urge to turn around onto his back. This position is already getting uncomfortable, but he mustn’t move. It would be very unwise. God, why did he cast that spell? Why didn’t ‘bond magic’ ring more alarms in his head? In retrospect, going to the Restricted Section was the dumbest idea he ever had. He should have known it would get him into trouble. But it wouldn’t have been as bad if Malfoy hadn’t shown up. To some extent, it’s
“Yes, oak trees for example, and elder trees.”
“Huh?”
“What is it? Did you see something?”
”No, not that one either!”
Draco shook his head while handing Harry one of the glasses.
“I— I want to be yours.”
Anything. Draco will give him anything.
“No,” Potter splutters. “It’s fine.”
He probably had been dying to join his father. With all those speeches over the years, about ‘filthy’ Mudbloods and how Pure-blood families are better than others, there really was no way around it, was there? With the way Malfoy had been raised, it was pretty much inevitable.
“I know.” It didn’t even occur to Draco to give Harry some snarky or witty retort. His mind was preoccupied with other things. Happiness, for the most part.
It reminds Draco of how thoughtful Harry is. It’s a sweet little gesture that reassures Draco.
“That’s so weird,” the keeper said. “Baxter usually doesn’t like human contact. At all.”
Not knowing what else to do, Draco snivelled into the duvet. He heard a knock on the door but ignored it. He didn’t want to talk to anybody right now.
“You gave me those socks that weren’t just socks… You… And I gave you a stupid new broom! How lame is that?”
Harry let out a sigh. That was the only thing that made him hesitate. He really didn’t miss the articles and the ridiculous headlines. The papers had gone mad when they had found out he had quit Auror training and was dating Draco Malfoy. It was almost as though it was giving them some sick, twisted bliss to publicly tear Harry apart. It was just what they had been waiting for, for him to do something ‘scandalous’ as they had called it.
“Nobody said he was.”
“Insulting my intelligence and my ‘lack of brain cells’” he raises his hands to make air quotes, “is really getting old.”
Draco huffs. “Not all teenagers are brutish Gryffindors, who get off on saving people and volunteer to sacrifice themselves and—”
, Draco thinks, his jaw dropping.
Draco gapes at him, the grim implication catching him off guard.
“Harry.” Hermione’s tone tells him the answer to that should be obvious. “You talk about him almost as much as you did in school. Ron noticed, too, you know.”
Harry sighs as he tries to remember what he told them. It was probably something vague. Because… what Ron and Hermione don’t know… Harry has been meeting him. At night. In secret. They would just sit together and talk. But, Harry supposes, not like other people would.
“What?”
“I never thought you were that naive,” Draco murmurs, shaking his head. “You really think it’s that easy? That I can just decide to turn my back on him?” His eyes find Harry’s again. They’re full of terror.
Hermione made a choking sound and her hands flew up to her throat.
“What the fuck is going on with you?”
“No, no,” Teddy said, stretching out his hands. “He’s very… soft.”
“What?” Harry exclaims. “Who doesn’t like chocolate ice cream? You’re weird. Okay, err… is it… butter pecan?” One tap.
“Thank you,” Harry murmurs, suddenly feeling extremely tired again. The fingers, softly tangling in his hair, feel soothing, and Harry lets out a little sigh. Without thinking, he reaches up, clasps Madam Pomfrey’s hand and brings it down to his chest. The hand is cold. And Harry feels so warm. Too warm.
He slowly turned around, careful to not have his cock yanked off, and captured Potter’s lips in another kiss. Potter seemed startled at first, but lost no time in reciprocating the kiss.
Malfoy shifts beside him and Harry readies himself for a punch or for Malfoy to storm off. Either will hurt. But nothing happens. Malfoy just sits there and Harry wonders if he should just shove him out of his bed and be done with it. But neither of them do anything and Harry starts questioning his resolution. He wants to stay strong and not let Malfoy know how much he’s hurting him, but he already feels the words tumbling out of his mouth.
“How could you?” he finally says, his voice breaking. “How could you do that?”
Apparently, it didn’t matter he had already seen Potter wearing that bloody Muggle suit when they had picked it out together; it knocked the breath out of him nonetheless every time he glanced over at him.
“You’ll find out. Take a card.”
“Fuck you, Potter,” Draco yells, feeling his throat close up. “Don’t act all high and mighty when you—”
“Hey, where are you going?”
Potter grunts, but he doesn’t move. Draco curls his hands around Potter’s wrists and slowly guides them down his body. He stops at his arse, pressing Potter’s palms against it.
“Are you really that pathetic?” he bellows, seething with rage. He balls his hands into fists and he can feel his fingernails digging into his flesh. “I can’t believe I was ever envious of you. You just lost my respect, Potter.”
“Do you know if there’s any news on the curse?” he asks, rubbing at his eyes. “The teachers haven’t been up here and Hermione says she’s still at a dead end.”
He felt Potter’s lips stretch into a grin. “If I remember correctly, that was your idea.”
“I do?” Harry asks, surprised.
“Seriously though,” Draco grumbled as he threw back the covers and leaned down to retrieve his clothes, “I can’t believe you were thinking about sleeping with one of our friends. Who, by the way, are all in committed relationships. It would have caused so much drama!”
“SHUT UP!”
“I think you hair looks nicer, since you stopped slicking it back.”
“I understand you perfectly,” Draco snaps and moves to step around Potter. He scowls when Potter reaches out and holds him in place.
“Um…” Potter hesitated, but Draco noticed his hand was creeping over to his. “Can I— Can I touch them?”
“Srusly?” Harry tries to wrench Malfoy’s hands away from his mouth, but he’s much stronger than Harry anticipated. “Mlfoy!” When all attempts fail, Harry lets his hands drop to his side again. He acts like he admits defeat, while his lips curl into a mischievous smile. He opens his mouth and, in one swift motion, licks his palm. Malfoy jerks and immediately withdraws his hand.
Draco winced as he felt the tip of Potter’s cock stretch him and he felt a sharp burn zing through him. It was uncomfortable, but the tingling on his skin and the longing, coiling in his belly, were stronger. He lowered his hips as slowly as possible, finally letting go of Potter’s cock when he had fully engulfed him. The burning sensation was back, about ten times more intense as it had been before.
“You realise you almost ruined this for me, right?”
“Maybe you’re too scared to admit it,” Harry sighs, “but I’m not.”
“I don’t think it’s like that anymore.”
Harry gapes at him, processing all the confusing emotions that seem to fight against each other in the pit of his stomach. It seems unfair to be blamed for this. It wasn’t his intention to humiliate Malfoy. Besides, if anyone wants this to go away, it’s Harry.
“You,” Malfoy practically shouts.
Potter sighed, leaning back in his chair. “I rarely talk about it to be honest.”
If Draco hadn’t been so overwhelmed, he would have been furious at himself for squeaking like a little child.
“That doesn’t automatically mean everything’s forgotten,” Draco murmured, curling his fingers around his cup. His skin soaked up the warmth, calming him.
“I have no idea what’s going on,” Harry murmured. What had gotten into Malfoy?
Oh. Really? And then what?
Draco frowned as Potter took it sheepishly and mumbled, “Thanks,” before walking away.
“But I like being with you more,” he whispers to no one.
Draco huffs and keeps his eyes on the fairies. This is so embarrassing.
“Yes, but—Oh! Harry!” Luna claps in excitement. “They’re so beautiful!”
They walk in silence for a while and Harry tries to savour every little detail. Birds chirping, the soft breeze caressing his face, the laughter from other students somewhere far off.
“More like firewhisky,” Parkinson groans. “And you two,” she says to Harry and Malfoy, looking over her shoulder, “please don’t finish what you started earlier. It looked very embarrassing.”
“You’re late,” Draco smiles, unable to keep himself from pointing it out. “Please, take a seat.”
“So many people died because of me.”
“What?”
“No, please don’t go,” Harry said in pleading tone. “He’s going to kill me,” he hissed under his breath.
He feels Potter shift and gasps when warm fingers grab his cock.
Strawberries. He tasted like strawberries. Well, artificial strawberries. Draco was pretty sure he’d always associate it with Potter from now on.
“You, err—You want some food?” Draco asked, feeling utterly uncomfortable. The koala just continued blinking at him. “Teddy, I don’t think this is—”
“It’s my party,” Draco snapped, pointedly ignoring the fact that Blaise was still waiting for him to clink glasses.
“Only one way to find out,” Harry mutters and pulls his wand. “Accio Galleons!”
“Yeah, well, at least now Seamus can blow up as many cauldrons as he wants without—Harry? What’s wrong?” Ron follows his gaze, up to the castle where someone with white-blond hair is heading for the entrance.
“Shut up!”
do next?
Still, something’s going on with him and he’s not very good at hiding it; unlike Draco. He hides his interest in the matter perfectly, concentrating on his paperwork. He only raises an eyebrow slightly when Potter returns from his lunch break on Wednesday, looking ruffled and annoyed.
Draco suppressed the choking noise he had been about to make, pressing his lips into a tight line. Had Potter always been this blunt?
“Because you’re a bumbling idiot.”
“You wouldn’t.”
Malfoy lifts his head and looks him dead in the eye. “I’m a tutor.”
“Harry?”
Before Harry can stop himself, he bursts out laughing.
When he opened his eyes, Potter and Blaise were still in conversation, although Blaise did most of the talking. Taking a deep breath, Draco turned around and ordered another glass of wine. Being tipsy around Potter might not be a good idea but there was no way he could endure this sober. He glanced over his shoulder, his eyes scanning the room for Pansy, when someone cleared their throat beside him. Draco already knew who it was before he turned around, mentally cursing everyone and everything.
“I don’t believe those students ran away. I think they’re being held somewhere against their will,” she says grimly. “Or they are—” She swallows. The rest of her unfinished sentence hangs between them and it feels like a Dementor just glided into the room. Draco has never seen McGonagall show much emotion. This is almost enough to make him uncomfortable.
“But what about breakfast?”
“Why did you let me eat that?” Draco barks as Potter clutches his stomach and almost doubles over from laughter.
Harry hears scratching again and a second later, Ron mutters, “Evanesco.”
Draco looks sideways and bites his lip. Hard. Does he still believe it? To a certain extent. But the alternative would have been marrying a pure-blood witch. And… Draco said those things to hurt Potter, not because he had meant it. Not all of it.
“Thank you, Headmistress,” he heard Potter murmur. “I really appreciate it. Everything.”
They all look up to find Robards standing behind Potter.
Draco’s heart stops. He keeps his finger inside of Potter, moving awkwardly as he pushes down his pyjama bottoms and his pants one-handed. Merlin, his cock is embarrassingly hard. Potter hasn’t even touched him.
As if to answer his question, the koala gave a loud squeak.
“You wanted to see me, Professor?” Potter says.
“It’s really sweet,” Harry said. He meant it, but he suspected Draco thought he was making fun of him.
“Why do you want them? What are you planning to do with them? You don’t even like Harry Potter.”
“Specialis revelio,” he murmurs. Nothing happens. Intrigued, Draco puts it in his pocket. He’ll examine it more carefully later.
Fuck, it was Malfoy? He had been holding Draco sodding Malfoy’s hand? The whole night?
Draco rolled his eyes in exasperation. “I think it would piss off people enough if we hyphenated. And,” he scrunched up his nose in mock disgust, “the world will still know who you belong with.” He tightened his grip around Harry’s waist and was obviously trying to fight down a smile.
The koala only raised its paws higher. What was even worse, its little button eyes seemed to be pleading with him.
That… could be an ‘l’... that’s definitely an ‘o’... and—Oh. No way.
Draco wrapped his arms around her, letting her warmth seep into him.
“To what happened to you? I’m not sure. But it’s the only thing I found that somewhat matches… this. I didn’t find anything about a curse that takes away three different senses from three individual people. But I think it must have been a combination of the Sectumsempra and the Evanesco. I tried looking that up as well, but there isn’t anything about the Sectumsempra-curse, obviously.”
Harry turns, slowly and full of dread, until he finds Malfoy standing right in front of him.
“Don’t you remember?” Potter smiled. He chuckled when Draco frowned, but waited patiently while Draco racked his brain. It took him a moment, but when it finally clicked, when he finally understood Potter was talking about the bond they had formed while he had been in his animagus form, he got so choked up, he wasn’t able to hide it.
“Are you telling me,” Harry squints at him, “that your magic is out of control?”
“That stupid game you made me play,” Potter growls. “Remember the last card?”
Draco can’t help but smile and slows down a bit, soaking up the warmth of Potter’s hand in his. His fingers twitch against the small of Potter’s back while his heart does its own little dance.
Harry’s heart leaps into his mouth. Before he knows what’s happening, Malfoy gets out of his seat and puts his hand on Harry’s shoulder.
Honestly, Draco didn’t share the sentiment. He was far more comfortable watching Potter from afar. He had been doing it for the last two hours, his eyes rarely leaving that poorly tamed black hair as Potter made his round through the room. It may have been a bit childish, but Draco wasn’t playing cat and mouse for his amusement. He was doing it to keep his sanity intact.
“No, you’ll owe me
“Draco, that’s not what I—”
Dumbledore gestures for Draco to sit down in one of the chairs in front of his desk, taking his own seat and conjuring two cups of tea, a little milk jug and a sugar bowl. Neither of them say anything for several minutes and Harry starts pacing the length of the room without taking his eyes off them. Dumbledore takes a sip from his cup, making an appreciative sound as he puts it back on the saucer with a soft clink. When he clears his throat, Harry stiffens.
Potter couldn’t be serious. But obviously, he was.
“First, I’d get you out of that hideous jumper.” Malfoy leans forward, crossing his arms on the table. “I bet whatever you’re hiding underneath is absolutely delectable.”
But what if he doesn’t? What if he pretends it never happened? That seems exactly like something Malfoy would do. But no, Harry won’t let him get away with that.
Tentatively, and still a little dazed, Draco moves his free hand up to Harry’s face. His eyes follow the movement of his fingers as he slowly taps the corner of Harry’s mouth twice.
“And how would you know?”
“I— I want to—” Harry doesn’t know why he’s so nervous all of a sudden. Malfoy just wanked him off, Harry is holding his cock. Why is he suddenly feeling shy? He licks his lips, astounded at himself for what he’s about to say. “I— I want to take you in my mouth.”
“Isn’t it weird, seeing your ex-girlfriend?” Draco asked in a seemingly innocent tone. He had read about Potter’s break up with the She-Weasel and had often wondered if they had gotten back together without the papers knowing about it.
“Now you’re just saying things so I won’t kill you.”
“Oh, that old thing,” Draco sniggers when Harry holds out the “Potter stinks” badge to him.
Potter presses his lips together, to which Draco rolls his eyes.
“It’s no big deal, Potter. Get over it.”
The silence stretched between them uncomfortably while Draco’s head pounded with the force of his frantic pulse.
Potter had already opened the package and was staring at it wordlessly. Could he… not see what was in it? Well, that had been the point of ordering—
Draco’s mind reeled.
Please don’t let it be ‘fight’! Please don’t let it be ‘fight’!
“Come on, let’s—”
“Malfoy,” Potter chokes, his voice low and breathy.
The whole room went “Oooooh!” when they saw the label on the vial.
“He asked mother to obliviate him,” he whispers. “She didn’t do it. So he did it himself.”
Panic washed over him. Where had it gone? Draco hadn’t seen it since… since before Potter had shown up. How could he have forgotten about Baxter? Granted, the whole situation with Potter had been quite distracting, but still! Draco couldn’t believe himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know. I’m not good with stuff like that. But… I mean, we were happy, right? We’re still happy.”
Malfoy snorts and, to Harry’s horror, steps closer. “Less talking, more kissing, Potter.”
Draco knew he was too frantic as he crossed Potter’s living room, but he couldn’t help it. He didn’t want another minute to go by with Potter being self-destructive.
“Well, I don’t have to deal with it alone anymore.” Potter reaches up and cups Draco’s cheek. “At least I’m hoping I won’t have to.”
“Would you…” His voice quivered slightly. “Would you want to kiss me again?”
“Relax,” Draco whispered, pulling Harry into his arms. “We can go slow, okay? We won’t do anything you don’t want to.”
“Where are you going?” Potter hisses.
“Relax, Draco,” Potter chuckled. “I know you didn’t touch me up intentionally.”
“Um…” She looked around, her blond curls bouncing this way and that.
“Luna, please,” Draco beseeched her. “If there’s something I should know—” He clamped his mouth shut, unable to finish the sentence. He didn’t have any right to meddle in Potter’s life anymore.
“Oh.”
“Don’t flatter yourself,” Draco said with a dismissive gesture, gulping down his too hot tea. He made a face as the liquid burnt his mouth and the embarrassment burnt his cheeks.
“Yes! Finally,” Malfoy hisses. His voice brings Harry back to reality.
“I was just taking the piss,” Potter sniggers.
“What, that you like him?” Ginny cocks her head. “He’d have to be pretty dumb not to notice.”
“You’re one to talk,” Potter murmured.
“The whole premises. And they added a Muggle-Repelling Charm.”
“Thanks,” Teddy beamed at him. A lot of people had stared at his bright turquoise hair; some even found it more interesting than the animals.
Harry debates turning on his heels and fleeing the scene, but that would be childish. Instead, his knuckles turn white as he grabs the chair in front of him as if his life depends on it.
“He’s your friend, isn’t he?”
Draco snorts. This is getting utterly ridiculous. He startles when Potter lets out a grunt and his head drops to the side. Draco unconsciously leans forward. It’s still not what he meant to say, but Potter does have a rather appealing jawline. And, he supposes, his mouth isn’t that unpleasant to look at either. And—
“So,” Harry says, just to fill the silence, “some story Dean’s got there, huh?” His mouth instantly goes dry when Malfoy looks at him with a stony expression.
Harry shifts uncomfortably in his bed. Hermione is probably going to yell at him sooner or later. She’ll probably call him all sorts of names. And she probably would be right in doing so. But aside from that, Harry is mostly relieved Hermione already knows. He’s not in the mood to recount that incident, especially while Malfoy is probably listening to every word he says. Which is why Harry motions for Hermione to come closer, and when she does, he whispers in her ear, “Can you do me a favour?”
“What are you trying to imply here?” Malfoy sneers. “Are you calling me a wimp?”
“I wasn’t thinking about sleeping with anyone!”
Hermione sighs. “Be that as it may, you can’t just go around vanishing people.” Then she adds, muttering under her breath, “And I’m pretty sure you did it incorrectly.”
“No!”
“Not in my club!”
The thought of him almost touching the Dark Mark is sickening and it reminds him of all the reasons why Malfoy isn’t his friend. He’s his enemy. And yet, there’s this one thought that’s somehow even worse than all of that, sending a stab to his chest over and over again.
all the time. Since he can’t rely on his eyes anymore, his hearing seems to have become so much sharper, picking up things he never would have noticed before. Like the way Madam Pomfrey walks. She’s constantly bustling through the room with mincing steps. At first, he thinks it’s kind of endearing. Now, he wants to throw something at her every time she passes his bed.
“You know me?” Draco asks Kreacher. Turning to Potter, he adds, “How do you know him?”
“Yeah, well.” Draco petted the koala’s head with a fond smile. It opened its mouth wide, and almost looked like it was laughing.
happen between you two?”
“Alright,” Weasley says, hesitantly. He glances over his shoulder, back at Potter, as he follows Draco out into the hallway.
“I didn’t forget,” he says through gritted teeth.
Draco gasps for air. The pain is becoming unbearable. As his body tries to fight through it, his mind wishes he were unconscious. Defeated by Potter, in a moment of weakness. His father would be disgusted by him. He would be even more disgusted if he knew Draco had been crying in a girls’ bathroom. And Potter had seen. He had seen it.
Hermione would probably say nothing at first, trying to resolve her own issues with Malfoy first. Harry thinks she might be the first one to come around. After Luna.
The mystery of the commonly occurring crashing sound beside Harry’s bed is lifted when Ron screams at Malfoy to stop smashing all the vases and glasses. If Madam Pomfrey hadn’t intervened, there probably would have been another fight. And that is about the most interesting thing that has happened over the last few days.
“Not a chance, Potter,” Draco said, pulling him into another kiss. “Whether you like it or not, we’re in this together now.”
“Thanks for not leaving me alone at the restaurant,” Potter says. “I guess it would have been a little humiliating, sitting there by myself.”
“Harry, are you okay?”
He realises he hasn’t thought about the horcruxes in a while. He and Dumbledore should be working on finding them right now. Instead, he’s sitting here, being completely useless. Has Dumbledore found anything new yet? Is he too preoccupied finding something to break the curse?
“Um, good,” Draco says, still sceptical.
Hagrid slowly nods. “Missin’ Malfoy, are yeh?”
“Why?” Potter looked genuinely puzzled.
“Hey, it’s okay, it’s okay.” Draco wrapped his arms around its body and pressed his cheek against its head. “I’ll try to be more careful, okay?” He held his breath when he felt the koala lifting its head. Baxter looked at him with its brown button eyes as though it really understood what Draco had just said.
“It feels like this,” Potter said.
“Don’t be so dramatic,” he muttered after he finished. He quickly drew his wand and cast a drying charm on the koala and his clothes. “See? Much better,” he said and picked up the koala. It refused to look at him, to which Draco rolled his eyes.
A pillow hit him in the back of his head, right before Justin groaned, “Malfoy, just SHUT UP!”
“Not the kind of date I had in mind, but alright.”
He may still be wary when it comes to Muggles and his first instincts may still tell him to preserve blood purity, but, Draco supposes, it’s not that easy to leave something behind that took residence in your core; something that’s been put there by people you loved and trusted. And even though he may still think and feel these things, he questions it, reevaluates and researches. It’s the best he can do. And he hopes it’s enough.
Ron sighs and rubs his nose as though its mere existence irritates him. “We kinda got into a fight earlier.”
Harry stares at him. “Come again?”
“Oh!”
Draco blinks, still stunned from Potter licking his hand, but also from the sight before him. Potter looks so different when he laughs. Younger. Carefree. Draco’s eyes fixate on the little crinkles on Potter’s nose and around his eyes. He shakes his head and Draco’s gaze falls on his dimples. Potter has dimples. How could he have not noticed that before?
Draco’s head whips around to find Potter lying on his back with his eyes closed.
Potter made a choking sound.
“You can have me on my knees all night, sucking your—”
“Aren’t there— Aren’t there other ways, too?”
“Maybe,” she chuckles. “But not as blind as you.”
“Err…” Potter’s head emerges from the tent and he starts rubbing his forehead. “There seems to be a slight problem.”
What had Malfoy done? Instinctively, Harry’s hands fly to his chest and start sweeping over his body. Huh. Everything is still there. As well as that bloody dizziness. And he can’t decide if he’s freezing or too hot.
“I can’t sleep if it’s too warm,” Potter said. “And I get really hot during the night.”
Potter’s eyes found his once more, all warm and soft, sending Draco’s heart into a frenzy.
Draco says nothing. The back of his neck prickles and his palms are getting sweaty.
Countless times he had taken a look at the Daily Prophet, only for Potter to stare at him from the front page. Draco always scowled back, sometimes he even stuck out his tongue at the picture. But now… It really wasn’t the same, seeing Potter in person. The most significant difference was, he always looked displeased in those pictures. Now, he looked… not shocked but… almost startled. Why, though?
“So?” Potter asks, propping his chin up on his chopsticks-free hand.
Say Hi on
Potter doesn’t answer and just keeps staring. Draco follows his gaze, wondering what prompted him to stop. There’s nothing there. Just the Forbidden Forest. To be fair, it’s one of the scariest places Draco has ever been to. Oh, but it’s more than just scary for Potter, isn’t it?
“No,” he said, slightly shaking his head. “That’s not why I kissed you.” He wrapped his arms around Draco’s midriff once more and pulled them closer together. And then, to Draco’s astonishment, he pressed his nose against Draco’s. “That’s why I kissed you.”
“He’s my house-elf,” Potter says matter-of-factly.
Sometimes, Draco wished he didn’t have to hide it, could show it openly and let the stupid git know.
“So… you’re saying…”
Harry sighs. “Nevermind. I’m really not that hungry.”
“No,” Potter barks and plops down on his chair. He starts drumming his fingers on his desk and Draco is pretty sure he’s only doing it to annoy him.
Harry had always wondered what it would be like to hold somebody like that. Or to be held. Memories of his dreams, about Malfoy holding him, pop into his head, but he has to admit, having Malfoy in his arms for real is much nicer than he imagined. He wonders if it’s the same for Malfoy. Oh. Maybe it isn’t.
“I’m not going to sit here and listen to this bollocks,” Draco barked, jumping out of his seat so fast, the chair fell over. “You don’t get to make me the bad guy anymore.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Potter!”
They stare at each other for what feels like several minutes. So many emotions rush through Draco, he can barely keep up. Shock, doubtfulness, wonder, warmth, glee, giddiness, bliss…
were when we first met,” he continues, after clearing his throat. “But it was pretty clear from the start that you were a pompous arse.”
“Why?” was the only thing he found himself capable of saying.
“I can’t believe I’m going to the library when I don’t even have to go to classes,” Ron grumbles. “But I guess it’s better than sitting around here all day. See you later, Harry. Oh. I mean—”
Harry recognises it immediately, but still, he scrambles off the floor and stumbles forward to get a better look. Draco is standing beside his bed, stroking his hair. It’s an odd sight, not only because Harry is looking at himself, pale and sick, but mainly because… Draco isn’t just stroking his hair. It’s the look on his face that makes this absolutely mesmerising. Harry has never seen Draco’s face look so soft, so vulnerable.
“Still. It’s my responsibility to make it right.”
“I’m sorry.” Somehow, it doesn’t feel right for Dumbledore to console him.
“Merlin, Potter, they didn’t die. They cancelled dinner. Is it that big of a deal?”
“No, you imbecile, we won’t reconsider the second one. My husband only deserves the best and you won’t stop looking until you find something that will make me absolutely certain he has everything he ever dreamed of!”
“What are you talking about?”
Draco only hesitated for a second before he grunted a “Yes” in return. He sat up and saw Potter slip inside and rush over to his bed. He paused in front of Draco, wringing his hands.
Ron doesn’t answer. From what Harry can see, his limbs are stretched from his body at a very strange angle, and he seems to be unconscious.
Harry closes his eyes. Nemesis. He hates that word. And he hates that Malfoy still thinks of him as one. That’s not what he—
Harry grabs Ron’s sleeve and pulls him down into a crouch next to him in his hiding place. His heart is beating wildly in his chest, too many thoughts battling inside his head.
“That sounds pretty selfish to me.”
“I’ll try,” Draco said with a weak smile. He let himself be pulled into a tight hug and briefly closed his eyes, letting Blaise’s warmth seep into him.
“Think of something unappealing,” Draco says after a while.
“We’re not talking about last night,” he said, already feeling the heat rise to his cheeks.
“But what?”
, Draco thinks, but stomps to the bathroom and back nonetheless. He steadies Potter, as the git gulps down the water, and tries not to overthink the sudden buzzing in his ears and the tingle on his palm, which is pressed against Potter’s back.
It sounds like they’re very near.
“Well.” Harry swallows. “I—” Shutting off his brain for a moment, he turns on his side and moves closer to Malfoy, until their bodies are touching. He feels Malfoy go rigid but still lays his head on his shoulder. “I mean, we wake up like this every morning anyway,” he mumbles. “Might as well.”
“I don’t know,” Potter whispered.
Indeed they had. Potter had practically forced Draco to talk to him after his trial, even though, or maybe especially because, he had refused to at first. Draco had felt too ashamed, too embarrassed, but also too angry to talk to Potter. It was just the icing on the cake that Potter, of all people, had been the one to save him. Again. And even though gratitude had been somewhere in the mix, it had mostly felt degrading.
, Harry thinks, remembering how it felt when Malfoy touched him. Just the touch of another person’s hand was so thrilling. Plus, the fact that it was Malfoy…
Weasley rolls his eyes. “Why can’t you just kiss him like any normal person would?”
“Did you have a pet as a child?” Potter asks. Draco taps his hand once.
“I’m not going to say it again,” Draco says through gritted teeth.
“But… won’t Chang be mad if you—”
“You mentioned something about trees in your letter.”
“Draco promised me we’d play after dinner,” Teddy said and continued to wolf down his peas and mashed potatoes.
The house-elf appears with a loud crack.
“So, tell me,” Potter says, “who is my secret admirer? And why isn’t he here?”
Luna looked like she was biting the inside of her cheek. “I think you should talk to Harry about that.”
“I won’t leave you again. I promise, okay?”
Without answering, Potter grabbed one of the bigger pillows and shoved it under the small of his back.
“I almost didn’t.”
“Don’t be late.”
“Uh—”
“Harry, you’re kidding, right?”
Harry snickers at that and leans back in his chair.
“What do you think you’re doing?” Potter asks.
It takes Malfoy twenty minutes to saunter into the kitchen. He sits down silently, avoiding Harry’s eyes.
“But before he’d kiss you,” Draco whispers, “he—he would have told you—”
Harry blinks, suddenly speechless. He refrains from pointing out St Mungo’s is right around the corner and they will hardly spend two more minutes together. There’s something about Malfoy’s expression that makes Harry nod while his legs get all jittery.
As Malfoy’s heartbeat increases, another memory pops into Harry’s mind. He had done the same thing to Malfoy, in an attempt to make his feelings clear.
It took Potter no time to send his answer.
“Pfft, how foolish,” Draco snorted. He took a sip of tea, not taking his eyes off the picture. He spotted Weasley in the background, clad in his ridiculous Auror robes. Automatically, Draco’s eyes scanned the picture for the person completing the formerly infamous Golden Trio, even though he knew it was pointless. Nobody had heard anything from Potter in years. He had vanished after the Battle of Hogwarts, and while there was still a special unit searching for him, many believed him to be dead. As for Draco, he didn’t know what to believe.
“O—Oh,” Harry says, wondering if Malfoy can feel his heartbeat.
“That’s different,” Potter says, trying to snatch at Draco’s finger with his mouth. “Sex isn’t the same as food.”
Draco does, clamping his mouth shut. His gaze is fixed on the ceiling again. He feels Potter settle himself between his legs.
He sinks down to the ground, hugging his knees, unable to stop the hot tears in his eyes from brimming over.
“Ooookay, you’ve made your point,” Potter practically shrieks and jumps to the other end of the sofa. “Merlin, you’re a good actor.”
“Your heart is beating really fast.”
“Potter, you—” Why is he even surprised? Of course Potter has no fucking clue. The imbecile. “Goblin wine is famous for its strong effects on humans. In small doses, it can be quite pleasant. But it’s highly addictive and people tend to overdo it, which leads to this.” He gestures down his body. “That’s why it’s illegal now.”
Potter gapes at him. “That’s… disgustingly confident.”
“Potter!”
“But why?” Malfoy adds, as though Harry already answered his previous question.
“Harry,” Ron suddenly yelps. “WHERE’S HARRY?”
“He said you were really sad, but you’ll be happy again, so I can be, too!”
“But… he’s so fluffy. And he likes to snuggle!”
Draco nearly chokes.
“Honestly, Potter, you’re the thickest person on this planet.”
“I assumed he was, um…”
“Professor,” Potter says, sounding a little impatient now. “Do you know what Firenze was talking about?”
“There’ll be a lot more evenings, Malfoy. Unless we can solve the case tomorrow, which I doubt.”
“Still better than that thing.” Potter nods at the camp bed.
Draco whirled around, almost falling out of Harry’s bed. Terry had propped himself up on his elbows and was staring at them, wide-eyed.
“Fuck! Draco!”
“About what?” Draco asks, keeping his eyes on his desk.
Judging from what his fingertips felt, the person seems to be male. Harry’s cheeks heat up at the thought that he could have accidentally molested a girl like this in the middle of the hospital wing.
“What was I supposed to do?”
“YOU ARSEHOLE!”
Harry’s mouth falls open when Malfoy buries his hands in his hair and moves his hips with even more determination. Fuck, he’s getting hard. This is… too much. But who can blame Harry? Malfoy is beautiful. The way he’s moving is beautiful.
He takes a closer look at the Niffler’s feet and spots the golden marks Hagrid told him about.
Draco’s not sure, but he thinks he got Potter on his shoulder and punched his chest, knocking the breath out of him. When Draco starts whirling around again, striking out in an uncontrolled manner, he suddenly feels arms encircling him, clutching him.
Malfoy peeks at the Niffler and slightly raises his chin. “She’s clearly a Penelope.”
“Shhhhh,” Teddy hissed, covering the koala’s ears with his hands. “He can hear you!”
Harry bites his lip. He’s stunned by the unexpected queasiness washing over him. He can’t explain it. He can’t understand it. But he can’t help it. He just can’t help feeling sympathy for Malfoy. He must be so lonely.
“Blimey, Harry, you’ll owe us for that one.”
He seems to be okay with what Harry is doing, one hand on his stomach, while the other is buried in his hair. Slowly, he lets go of the other boy’s hair and moves his hand lower. He feels a pang in his heart when he reaches his shoulder. The bones are much more prominent than they should be. He swallows as his fingers continue their way downwards, until they finally find Malfoy’s hand and Harry guides it up to his own face and presses it against his cheek.
“Minerva has kept me informed, but I’m afraid I’m as nonplussed as the rest of you.”
“I—I don’t—”
Potter’s eyes widen in horror. “What are you saying, Professor?”
“What? What?” Harry hears Ron mutter sleepily. “What happened?”
“I didn’t do anything,” Harry says, furrowing his brows. It’s the truth. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have—Oh no.
“A— Are— Are we in the showers?”
.” It took so much to say these words out loud. They were easily yelled in a fight. But now that he knew Potter was battling different demons, he was more inclined to show Potter his own insecurities.
When Potter is finally done eating—thank Merlin!—he levitates the plate back to the others and leans back, letting out a quiet sigh.
He really meant it, he didn’t regret any of his mistakes. Not anymore. It had taken him a long time to get there and a lot of help from Draco. He knew they could count on each other no matter what.
Potter made a face. “I just think it’s strange, being here without knowing who invited me.”
Harry knows what that’s like. He has Ron and Hermione, but there are certain things he doesn’t feel comfortable sharing with them. Like when he has nightmares about his parents dying, or how it feels when he has these glimpses into Voldemort’s mind or… what… what had happened at the Ministry last summer. It’s lonely, keeping these things inside. But Harry doesn’t feel like talking about it. He’d rather be lonely.
“Stop saying my name, Potter,” Draco snaps, suddenly feeling flustered.
“You’re turned on by me being covered in pumpkin?” Draco snorted. “You really are a weird one, Potter.”
“Wait, are
Draco watches as Potter lies down on his back and stretches, causing his jumper to ride up. Merlin’s fucking beard, Draco wants to touch that beautiful skin so badly. If he didn’t know any better, he’d suspect Potter’s showing off his fucking happy trail on purpose.
Draco clutches the door handle, suddenly feeling dizzy. “What—What are you doing here? How do you know where I live?”
“I don’t know,” Potter muttered. “The last thing I remember… I was at the Burrow…” He bit his lip, his forehead in creases. “I—I think I was watching TV… Yeah, I remember Arthur got one.”
Draco puts the textbook back on his bedside table, and punches his pillow in frustration.
Weasley looks down at his shoes. “Well. We all changed after the war, didn’t we?” He looks at Draco again. “Come on, Malfoy, cut him some slack, will you?”
“Who’s next? Pansy!”
“What? You want him to get away with this?”
“Memory,” Draco whispers. He knows where Harry is. At least he thinks he does.
“I’m not afraid,” Draco muttered. “But I think it might be afraid of me.”
“What?”
“You’re really ready for this?”
“Are you okay?” Ron asks. He’s standing right next to Harry. Slowly, Harry nods. “That bastard,” Ron growls. Harry immediately wants to agree, call Malfoy all sorts of names. But…
“You’re going to be a prat about this, aren’t you?”
He slows down, his eyes fixed on the wall. Nothing is happening. He stomps his foot in frustration.
“Yeah, that might be a good idea,” Harry laughs and leans in again, because now he doesn’t have to hesitate and he can just kiss that beautiful mouth and throw his arms around this beautiful boy who hiccups when he’s nervous and makes sparks dance around them because, apparently, he’s just as much a fool for Harry as Harry is for him.
Dumbledore nods.
He goes back to staring at her, his heart inexplicably beating faster. “Malfoy and I aren’t a thing, Ginny! That’s insane!”
“Let go of me.”
“What are you doing?” Malfoy asks.
“Well, obviously I didn’t tell the Daily Prophet the whole story. There’s really no need for anyone to know.”
“Are you going to open it or are you going to stare at it until your eyeballs fall out of your head?”
“Yeah, I transfigured it for Teddy.” He said it as though it was no big deal.
“You really sure about this, Malfoy?”
Potter shrugged. “I told you, I wanted to make sure you’re okay.”
“No, Harry, you might want to stop talking.”
“No, that’s not it,” Potter says, sounding a little offended.
“Err, Professor?” he murmurs. “I’m sorry, but… I don’t feel any different.”
“That’s why I was so surprised he made dinner for you,” she said with a ghost of a smile.
“Come on. Library. Now.”
Draco drinks in Potter’s scarlet face and his flared nostrils, feeling like his entire body just turned into stone. It takes a moment for him to regain his composure, to force his lips into something that hopefully resembles a grin.
“I can’t just sit there, across from you, day after day without—”
“Which proves you’re the real sop in this relationship,” Harry smirks. He presses the badge and the words “Potter stinks” dissolve into “but I love him anyway”. It had been the first time Draco had said it. Well, technically he didn't say it. Until this day, he has never said it out loud, but Harry doesn’t need to hear it to know how he feels.
“I shouldn’t have sent you on that date,” Draco sighs. “I’m sorry.”
“Oh, I know. There are pictures to prove it.” He sniggers. “How long did it take you to get the magical paint off your face?”
“Oh my God,” Harry gasped as he suddenly remembered standing on the balcony with Draco. “We kissed, didn’t we? We kissed!”
?” Draco mutters.
They stare at each other for a moment before Draco bursts out laughing.
“What did you just say to me? I dare you to repeat it.” He shivers, either from the cold or from hardly being able to contain his anger. Harry isn’t sure.
He peeks at Malfoy, who’s looking at Harry as though he just summoned a Boggart and Malfoy is forced to face his worst fear.
“You all know very well these are banned at Hogwarts. Detention! For all of you,” McGonagall barks.
“So you’re just here to enjoy my company?” Malfoy snorts.
“Have you lost your mind? What gives you the right to come into my bedroom?”
Harry startles when he hears Snape’s voice right beside him.
“Hey, I’m his best friend as well,” Zabini chimes in.
“Thank you, Professor,” Hermione says, and Harry hears her footsteps as she approaches. “Oh, Ron,” she whispers, and Harry’s heart clenches. He should have sent Ron away. He shouldn’t have let him put himself in danger like that. It had been Harry’s decision to follow Malfoy. It had been his battle, not Ron’s. He feels tears of anger form in his eyes and he stubbornly tries to hold them back.
“Okay. Great.”
“Why? Is it turning you on?”
“Yeah, I’m surprised as well,” Sirius says. “I thought he was really going to stun you.”
“I‘m not going to be blamed for the Saviour of the Wizarding World falling into some sort of depressive episode,” Malfoy says, his brows furrowed as though he’s trying to look irritated despite sounding almost worried.
Mentally congratulating and slapping himself, Draco trudges after him, wondering how he’s going to survive the night.
“Why didn’t you?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. “We bumped into each other often enough.”
Potter looks like he doesn’t know if he should laugh again or have Draco admitted to the Janus Thickey Ward.
Deliberating only for a moment, Draco strides over to her. He forces his face to stay impassive, even though he wants to scream from how sore he feels. He notices the girl’s tense shoulders and her shaking fingers. He sits down opposite her, flinging his robes over the bench in a flourish and regretting it immediately when his aching skin starts to burn even more. He folds his arms on the table wordlessly, noting how the girl flinches and how she seems to be getting more nervous as she keeps her eyes on her book.
“Here, Master Draco,” Kreacher says, handing him the expensive looking bottle. “If Master Draco is wanting more, he only need call Kreacher.”
Draco smirks at the outrage on Potter’s face. “Come on, we both know they went easy on you.”
“Potter, no,” Draco said, vigorously shaking his head. “You’re not going to run away again. I won’t let you.”
“So sorry to cut this short, but it seems I’m needed elsewhere.”
Harry and Draco just moved in together and the first thing Harry notices is that Draco didn’t bring many personal items with him. The few things he did bring with him are immediately stowed away in the attic. Draco says they don’t mean much to him anyway and refuses to set up any pictures of his family, too. One day, Harry’s curiosity gets the better of him and while Draco’s at work, he goes to the attic and finds Draco’s box. Leaning against it, there’s a painting. Harry doesn’t know anything about art, but it looks dark. And complex. It’s almost like he can feel the pain that went into it with every brushstroke. He bites his lip and slowly takes out his wand.
“You know this isn’t healthy, right?” Draco quipped, but bent down to pick up the koala nonetheless. He let out another laugh when the koala instantly snuggled up against him and rubbed its cheek against his chest.
“It was one time,” Potter groans. “I fell asleep at my desk once!”
Harry’s grip on his firewhisky tightens. This is absolute torture. He nearly chokes when Malfoy bends down and runs his fingers over his legs; that’s when their eyes finally meet. Something flickers across Malfoy’s face, but it’s gone so quickly, Harry wonders if he only imagined it. He takes a swig, knowing full well how unprofessional it is, but the burn of the firewhisky is such a welcome distraction, Harry doesn’t really care. He slams down the glass and curses under his breath. He made himself invisible again. Fantastic. Ugh. It’s no use. He’ll have to abort the mission.
“D—Draco?”
Dear Merlin.
“Do you want me to be attracted to you?” Malfoy asks quietly. He slowly lets his head fall to the back of the sofa without taking his eyes off Harry.
He sat down on the bed, facing Potter, but before he could say anything, Potter let out a dreadful gasp, his eyes fixed on Draco’s chest.
you to Madam Pomfrey.”
“He made it sound like…” Potter hesitates. “He made it sound like this is about me.”
“I—I wanted to show you that,” he swallows, “I’m the one for you.” It sounds so incredibly stupid when he says it out loud.
“Okay, now you’re overdoing it,” Draco muttered, untying the letter from the owl’s foot. He unfolded it and frowned. This wasn’t Potter’s handwriting…
Harry shivers as Malfoy’s warm breath grazes his ears.
“Make me see what?”
Harry would recognise that snore anywhere. It’s usually louder during the night. He concentrates on the sound, on the familiarity of it. It’s almost calming.
“No, I want to try the… what’s it called again?”
Jacob starts wringing his hands and his bottom lip trembles. “That—That day, Chris got a Howler from his mum. He—he didn’t open it and it exploded in our dorm.” Jacob stares at his hands. “He wouldn’t tell me what’s going on, but he looked really sad. He even screwed up in Potions, which he usually never does. I tried talking to him after Herbology, but he blew me off and stormed out of the greenhouse. I don’t know where he went. It was the last time I saw him.” Silent tears roll down his cheeks and Draco carefully puts a hand on his shoulder. “He’s my best friend,” Jacob murmurs. “I should have stopped him. I should have—” He breaks off, more tears streaming down his face.
Potter presses his lips together. Draco knows that look. He’s trying to decide if he should say what he clearly wants to, but something’s holding him back.
“That’s not fair,” Potter murmured, his face set in a stubborn scowl.
“It seems as though my time as headmaster is running out faster than I would have thought,” he ponders. He looks over his shoulder, smiling. “You see, this,” he holds up his injured hand, “is giving me more trouble than I would like. But we can talk about that another time.”
“I—I don’t think I can get up on my own,” Potter murmured with a sour expression.
“Potter,” he purrs. “
Draco wanted to roll his eyes, tell Potter to bugger off, but… he knew what Potter meant and if he was being honest, the offer was rather intriguing. But could he really risk it? There was a reason he had mostly avoided Potter all those years.
Draco lets out a shuddering breath. As much he hates to admit it, they did it to protect him. And that, Draco slowly realises, is the difference. Because he didn’t tell Potter he was a virgin to protect him; he was protecting himself. He was being selfish. But what was he supposed to do? He couldn’t tell Potter. He would have felt too exposed.
“I didn’t do it on purpose,” Malfoy snaps back.
“How so?” Harry said. “I thought we finally—”
Malfoy doesn’t answer right away. When he does, his voice is strained. “It’s strange in a way,” he says quietly. “I’ve always wanted your attention.”
Draco should have known. He should have known Potter would react like this. He’ll sacrifice himself. Again.
“Wild hippogriffs couldn’t drag me there.”
“Well,” Draco began, eyeing Potter’s burgundy T-shirt and his short trouser, which reached to his knees, “I was taught elegance is a virtue, as well as endurance. Clearly, a concept which seems to be lost on you.” He let his eyes wander over Potter’s body and gave him an appraising look when their eyes met again. Potter seemed to stifle a giggle.
“Malfoy, I don’t have time for this. I’ll bring it back tomorrow. You can have it then.”
“Of course you can’t.” This was just Draco’s luck. He stretched out his hand to Potter, who hesitated a moment before he took it. Draco felt like he was holding one of his mother’s precious vases. It was disheartening, seeing Potter like this. And while Draco knew he was under no obligation to help him, he also knew he didn’t have much of a choice. What was he supposed to do? Leave him withering in his bed?
“Endurance,” Potter snorted. “Alright then.” He flashed Draco a toothy grin. Draco had no idea what was so funny about that, but didn’t get the chance to ask. Potter’s eyes had focused on something on the other side of the street. Draco turned around, but had no idea what had caught Potter’s attention.
“Why wouldn’t I?”
“Be careful with that,” he hears a girl hiss.
“Guess you’re kind of a magnet for drama, eh?”
“Oh?”
“What else would that entail? You taking care of… me?”
“As long as you’re being polite about it,” Potter says in a teasing tone. “Suit yourself.” He bends down to grab the duvet and throws it over himself. Draco jumps off the bed and watches Potter, dumbstruck, as he turns his back to him. “Goodnight.”
“What do you mean?”
Furiously panting, Draco tries to suck Potter’s cock as best he can, which proves to be a bit difficult. Several times he has to pause, unable to keep his body from jerking.
Harry cocks his head but follows Malfoy inside, scooping up Penny on the way. She hastily stuffs the Galleon into her pouch, and Harry laughs.
No, this is Harry’s flat.
“Why aren’t you yelling at me?” he asks.
Draco snorted again.
“What?”
“For Merlin’s sake, will you guys shut up?” Justin moaned from under his covers. “Some of us are trying to sleep here!”
The following silence almost feels like an admission of guilt. Or maybe it’s indifference. Draco isn’t sure.
Draco moves instantly, burying his hands in Potter’s hair and trapping his hips with his thighs.
So here he was, lurking behind a tree as he watched Potter carefully get down on one knee and tap his wand against a little girl’s finger.
“They’re… busy,” Harry said vaguely. Malfoy snorted and Harry suspected he knew exactly what Harry had implied.
“That’s not exactly how it’s done in the Auror Department,” Potter laughs.
Draco walks back to Potter’s side, feeling foolish. How was he supposed to know Potter’s personal matters aren’t off limits to him?
“What?”
“Um…”
Harry’s eyes roll to the back of his head and he’s plunged into darkness, only to be brought back rather harshly by unimaginable pain shooting down his back.
Harry snorts. “So sorry you won’t be getting off tonight.”
“I still don’t understand what’s going on,” Potter murmurs. “Why are you the only one who’s hearing voices?”
Harry parts his lips and lets his tongue dart out to lick over the tip. Malfoy tastes exactly like he remembers. Slowly, he lowers his head, pulling Malfoy’s cock into his mouth, instinctively hollowing his cheeks. As he starts bobbing his head, he realises it’s very different without all the water pouring down on them. It’s not bad, because now he can smell Malfoy. It’s intoxicating and Harry finds himself aroused by it.
He hears Malfoy snort and something rustles… as though Malfoy is shaking his head. But he doesn’t pull his hand away.
“It’s a little weird without them here,” Harry continues, without even realising he’s still talking. “It’s not the same. But nothing’s the same anymore, so…”
Harry’s eyes snapped open, confusion washing over him. Why was Malfoy looking at him… like that? And had he really just said ‘Please’?
“I don’t believe you.” He watched as Malfoy let his head fall back and closed his eyes.
He hears Malfoy moving again, and when he places something soft in Harry’s hands just a moment later, he wishes he hadn’t come up with this foolish excuse. But it would be even stupider to not go through with it now. So before Malfoy gets a chance to go back to his bed, Harry blurts,
Potter nods and claps Weasley on the shoulder. He turns to Draco with an expectant expression. “Aren’t you going to say something?”
“Harry—”
Harry lets his head fall back against the tree trunk. It feels like the sun is almost gone. It’s much colder than when they first went outside. He takes a deep breath, taking in all the smells around him; the grass, the fresh spring air… it feels soothing. Almost. His body is still a little tense, very aware of the fact that Malfoy is right beside him.
Draco sniggers. When Potter’s lips stretch into a huge grin, he wonders who just played who. But it doesn’t matter. If this is what his future looks like, he’ll take it. Gladly.
Draco has activated it. He’s alive. And he’s asking if Harry is, too.
For a moment, Malfoy stays completely still, while Harry caresses his stomach. He knows he’s about to enter the forbidden zone of the scars, but something else has caught his attention. He can feel all the ribs through Malfoy’s skin. His heart clenches. He tentatively moves his fingers upwards, until he feels a bump. More heat rushes to his groin when he realises he’s touching Malfoy’s nipple. He slowly starts circling it, paying close attention to any reaction. He feels their stomachs pressing together, as if Malfoy is arching his back. His heart rate picks up at the thought that Malfoy might be feeling the same desire as him. He gets lost in the sensation of slick skin, rubbing against his. It feels so good.
“Like a bloody fool,” Draco groans and plops down on the sofa. “I—” He’s already hating himself for what he’s going to say next. “I didn’t think I’d have a chance if I didn’t—”
“What if he attacks you?”
Teddy smiled and leaned his head against Draco’s shoulder. Draco kissed his turquoise hair before he pressed his cheek against it. He paused when he found the koala looking straight at him.
After what feels like hours, Potter releases him but keeps his face close to Draco’s. Merlin, he fantasised about kissing Potter about a million times, and yet, now that it might happen for real, he has no fucking clue what to do.
Salazar, this better work! Draco really didn’t need any more complications in his life.
“Why were you looking at it?” Draco asks quietly. His voice is low and Harry knows he’s doing it deliberately, to hide his apprehension.
Draco heaves a sigh.
The meaning of his hand on Malfoy’s chest slowly begins to dawn on him when he realises he can feel one of his scars through the fabric.
“Wow, four years,” Potter exclaimed, enthusiastically.
“What—What does that mean?”
Harry pulls out the coin he always keeps in his pocket and activates it. He holds it for days, even sleeping with the coin in his hand, waiting for an answer.
“It doesn’t make any sense,” Draco interjected. “How does ‘Draco Potter’ and ‘Harry Malfoy’ send a message? It would only lead to more confusion. Isn’t the point to… end up with the same name? To be… I don’t know, united?”
“I don’t see that we have any other option,” Harry says drily. He watches as even more colour drains from Malfoy’s already pale face.
“Is the building under a Concealment Charm?” he asked, looking over his shoulder.
“Baxter! You nearly gave me a heart attack!” He caressed the koala’s back, unable to stop himself from chuckling when he felt its head against the crook of his neck. “Thank Merlin! Where have you been? I’ve been worried sick!”
Draco inhaled sharply, his first instinct telling him Teddy was too young to have such serious discussions. Then again, Teddy wasn’t like other children, and he deserved to know everything. Draco, his mother and Andromeda had already told him the basics, but maybe it was a good thing he was talking about it with Potter. If anything, it seemed to be helping him, too. Maybe this was just what Potter needed; maybe talking to Teddy would help him cope.
“Firenze,” Potter says. “It’s good to see you.”
“Malfoy?”
“I never thought I would say this, but it’s actually good to see your face, Malfoy,” Potter grinned.
Acting on impulse, Draco draws his wand. But before he can even begin to decide what kind of jinx to fire at Potter, he hears him yelling,
“Stop wallowing in self-pity,” Draco barks. “It’s disgusting.” He turns on his heels and marches off. He knows Potter is right behind him, he can hear his footsteps, but it only makes him walk faster. He doesn’t even know if he’s walking in the right direction, but he doesn’t care. He has to keep moving, otherwise he’ll explode.
“I did not run off,” Draco said defensively.
The sudden silence feels awkward, making Draco squirm in his seat. He wonders if Potter is thinking about the other things that happened last night. At least he had the decency not to bring it up. Yet. Then again, he doesn’t know he’s not the only one who got… slightly aroused by the whole unfortunate situation. So, really, from Potter’s point of view, this is only embarrassing for him.
“You can do this,” Sirius says. “I know you can.”
, what was Harry doing? He hadn’t been sitting this close to Draco before! Now, Draco’s thighs were on Harry’s lap and Harry was almost touching his bum.
“Only for you,” Harry murmurs back as he pulls Draco in an embrace and buries his face in the crook of his neck.
“That would defeat the purpose.”
“I have to,” Potter says. “It’s my fault.”
After his third cup of coffee, he starts feeling edgy and restless. It’s almost eleven and Malfoy still isn’t up. What the fuck is he doing? Harry contemplates knocking on his door but… what then? On the other hand, waiting for Malfoy to finally come out of his room is driving him insane. He starts pacing in front of his door, pausing several times with his fist raised, ready to knock. He stops dead when he hears a quiet cough and… some rustling. Oh boy, Malfoy must be getting up.
“Just tell me you’re loyal to Voldemort and this whole discussion will be over,” Harry offers. He swallows around the lump in his throat and tries to keep his face impassive. Draco says nothing, his gaze dropping to the floor.
“Hey, don’t be afraid of him.”
Draco’s heart almost jumps out of his chest. His hand is moving so furiously, Potter’s hips jerking in the same rhythm, it’s making the bed shake.
?” he shrieks as they’re standing in front of his cabin, bathed in the forespoken moonlight.
Draco’s eyes snapped up to his.
This time, it was Potter who rolled his eyes.
“Potter, I didn’t storm into the Ministry and demand they make you an Auror. You did it by yourself.”
“I heard Madam Pomfrey and Dumbledore talk. I can’t be sure, but… Malfoy hasn’t said a single word.”
His heart squeezes painfully as he slowly acknowledges the sheer impossibility of Draco Malfoy, crying in his arms, as reality. He wraps his arms around the other boy and presses his cheek against his forehead. He doesn’t know why Malfoy is crying, but it makes Harry tear up as well.
“It’s a maxim. ‘See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil’. There are different interpretations of it, though.”
The castle seems completely empty when Draco passes through the Entrance Hall the next morning. The teachers must have sent the students to the Hogwarts Express already. Did Potter help them? He didn’t come to the hut last night. A part of Draco didn’t expect him to. The other part was devastated.
“Can I sleep here tonight?”
Draco gritted his teeth. That cocky bastard.
“What do you mean?”
He follows Potter’s gaze, up to the blackened sky and the twinkling stars. It’s a beautiful night. It would be a shame to let it go to waste.
Potter steps closer, his expression softening. “I’ll be right back.”
“I need this as much as you do,” Potter mumbles. It takes Draco by surprise. He didn’t expect Potter to admit it. Is it really that bad?
“Hey.” Harry stroked his hair again and seated himself on the edge of the couch. “Are you hungry?”
Draco watches helplessly as Potter approaches him.
“Are we behaving tonight, or are we getting pissed?” Blaise asked in a seemingly innocent tone.
“Not smuggle him out of the zoo?”
“Not too bad,” Draco echoed in agreement.
“Not yet. But Draco said he’d help me.”
Draco wishes he could scowl at him. Instead, he trembles and is forced to stay silent.
Draco’s mouth dropped open. His eyes quickly scanned the other two.
“Did you draw the curtains of your bed as well?” Harry asks, a grin forming on his face. Malfoy taps his hand twice and Harry’s grin widens.
“Just stay quiet and come with us,” Pansy said. “If you resist, I swear, Draco, I’ll put a Body-Bind Curse on you!”
“But I think I would like to be there when you tell him,” she adds with a grin. “It’ll make for some nice additions to the family album.”
“Why? And what in Merlin’s name did you tell her?”
Draco insisted on getting the tab and after they stepped outside, he stared at Potter’s outstretched hand.
He grabs the hem of Potter’s jumper and pulls it over his head; the sensation of Potter’s bare chest pressed against his is almost too much. His hands cling to Potter’s shoulders as their mouths move together and Potter walks them over to the bed. Draco lets himself fall backwards when his calves touch something solid, pulling Potter down with him.
Draco held it out to him, scrutinising him intently.
“Is it the porridge you’re opposed to or me feeding it to you?”
“How about a quick
“Because it’s more complicated than that. And I have no idea what I want.”
“Here, Baxter,” he said softly and tried to put the koala on one of the branches. “Ugh, you’re heavy.”
This time, Draco really did choke. He recovered rather quickly, however, and grabbed Potter’s hand.
Harry stiffens.
“How would we do that?” Draco retorts, already feeling frustrated. He just wants to be alone. Well, that’s not completely true. But being around other people is just so exhausting.
He marched into his room and put the koala down on one of the branches.
“Oh.” He didn’t even remember making plans with her. He felt too exhausted to rack his brain or even have a normal conversation. He just wanted to collapse and never get up again.
He feels something ice-cold in the pit of his stomach. It spreads rapidly through his body, like poison. Breathing becomes difficult and painful.
“Fuck, I’m so close. So close! Malfoy—I—” Potter arches his back.
Draco didn’t answer but clutched the corners of the blankets tighter around him.
The koala was still staring, its paw gently pressed against Draco’s skin. Draco cocked his head, studying the koala. He knew it was impossible, but… it almost looked… sad.
“Mate, seriously, what happened?”
Wait, what?
Malfoy gives him a curious look. “Do you know what it means?”
“So,” Malfoy says and Harry almost jumps out of his skin. “You finally decided to come in.” It’s not a question. It’s a statement. Malfoy knows. Damn it!
Dumbledore smiles at him. “In that moment, your soul was whole.” His expression changes, dark lines creasing his forehead. “As I told you back then, Harry, what happened between you and Voldemort was unprecedented. When you chose to come back to the living—”
“Oh, I was eager alright. You just completely took me off guard then. I wanted to return the favour.”
“I don’t think I’ll ever get used to that,” he continues after a moment. “Seeing him, I mean. It’s so strange. It’s like, when he’s angry, I get angry. And when he tortures or kills someone…” Harry’s voice breaks, but he pushes himself to keep going. “I can feel what he feels. And in these moments, he feels… gleeful.” A shiver runs down Harry’s spine and from the way Malfoy is squeezing his hand, it didn’t go unnoticed. “I just can’t imagine how someone can feel like that while they’re— It makes me sick.”
Harry thinks about it for a moment. Yes, why does he care? He can’t really find an answer and he doesn’t exactly understand it, he just… does.
“He’s not answering,” Draco interrupts her, showing her the coin. “I tapped it half an hour ago, but he’s not answering. It’s—” He lets out a shuddering breath. “It’s cold.”
Since that conversation, Harry can’t stop thinking about the possibility that he might never play Quidditch again. A Seeker who can’t see the Snitch, who can’t see anything at all, isn’t exactly someone people are dying to have on their team. And flying! Flying alone will be impossible.
The first time it happens, Draco comes home from work with a scowl on his face. He just got some really bad news and knows the next few weeks will be hell for him. When Harry asks about his day, he doesn’t say anything. He knows, if he opens his mouth now, he will only snap at Harry and he really isn’t in the mood to fight. Not after the day he had. So he sits there, throughout their dinner, saying nothing.
“No!”
Driven by this new determination, he stomped over to Teddy’s room. The child was nowhere to be seen; he was probably downstairs for breakfast. Good. Draco didn’t want him to see this. The only person he needed for this was Potter.
Potter was hesitant as he lifted his hand. With a touch so feathery it almost tickled, he traced the longest scar on Draco’s chest.
“And what?”
“I guess I could make up the guest bedroom for you,” Potter suggests and taps a finger against his chin.
“I didn’t mean for any of this to happen,” she blubbers out.
Andromeda didn’t seem convinced.
“What is your problem?” Blaise said, although he didn’t seem as irritated as he sounded. “Everything was fine when we—Oooooh!”
Just as Draco wanted to ask what the fuck he was doing here, Potter opened his mouth. He looked like he finally wanted to say something, but before he could, his eyes rolled to the back of his head and he crumpled to the ground.
“I bet you’re dying for me to touch you,” Draco whispers into Potter’s ear.
“Who?”
Draco doubts he’ll ever be able to sleep again, at least while he’s here in the hospital wing with ‘Snory Gryffindor’ and ‘Whiny Gryffindor’. All his attempts to tune out the noises fail.
“Is that so?” Dumbledore sounds intrigued.
Draco let out a groan. “I don’t care about anything else,” he whispered. “As long as it’s you and me.”
“Great,” Potter grumbles. “We can’t even do anything today.” He starts stomping down the corridor, making much more noise than necessary. “Why did we have to hurry over here if all we’re supposed to do is to be shut up in a room? Together!” He groans at the last word, and, for once, Draco agrees. He can hardly imagine anything more torturous than being stuck in a tiny room—he’s assuming it’s going to be tiny; better to expect the worst—with Potter, at their former school.
will have to go on a blind date this time.”
“Don’t play dumb, Potter.”
“Do you really have to make those noises?” Malfoy suddenly asks.
“Oh. Was I— Was I touching your chest?” Two taps. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. It won’t happen again. I promise.”
“Draco, what— Ow!”
“Remind me to thank McGonagall for making us wear these,” Draco hisses in Potter’s direction, tugging at his robes.
“Yeah, but they taste awful, don’t they? Mum always had to force them down my throat.” Ginny laughs and Harry can’t help laughing with her. It’s nice to have an actual conversation.
Blaise sniggered and shook his head. “You need to get out more, mate,” he told Draco before he waved goodbye.
“No, wait, Draco, don’t!”
“Please don’t,” Potter says, closing his eyes. “This is hard enough as it is.”
“Let us speak again in a few days.” Dumbledore moves as if to leave the portrait. “And Harry, if you should find yourself gripped by anger again, try not to fight it. Embrace it.”
“No,” Draco choked. “No!” He wrapped his arms around him and pressed his cheek against Potter’s head. “Please, Potter.” He hugged him closer to his chest, sniffling. “Don’t let go. Don’t let go of your humanity,” he begged, even though he knew it was probably too late. “Please don’t.”
“Do I look like a girl, Potter?” he grumbles through gritted teeth. Why would Harry get him flowers? Harry doesn’t reply. Instead, Draco feels his arms wrap around his waist from behind. When Harry starts nuzzling his hair, Draco sighs and puts one of his hands on Harry’s.
Malfoy shrugs, as though everything is settled. But it isn’t. How can it be? They woke up entangled with each other, practically every inch of their bodies touching. Malfoy was holding him for crying out loud!
“Harry?”
“After I learned what Dumbledore’s plan had been all along,” Potter says quietly, “I started to reevaluate… my whole life basically. And the longer I thought about it, the more I felt like none of the decisions I made were mine. Not even becoming an Auror.”
“Everything alright, Potter?” Nick asks.
“Okay then,” he says and smiles back.
“Mister Franklin,” Harry said, barely able to hide his annoyance.
“Ha ha, you’re going to have to catch me!”
“But can we even do that? Without getting married? Will they let us?”
“Don’t insult him. You’re supposed to make him like you, remember?”
Fuck. What was going on? The few times he had bumped into Potter over the years had been nothing like this. Granted, Potter had been friendly but he had also been curt and aloof. Draco had gotten the impression Potter was doing what he thought was required of him. But this, Potter being openly nice to him, was a first. And it was horrible. It only made things worse.
“I do know. Why do you think I’m here?” Draco said, shaking his head in mock disapproval. It made Harry frown.
“Alright, I think I’d better get going now,” Potter said, already rising from his seat. “Can I use your floo?”
“Really,” Draco sighed.
“I never would have done that,” Potter says, sounding appalled.
“Malfoy?”
“What do you think I’m doing?”
“Yeah, she’s Muggle-born.”
He watches as Parkinson’s eyes widen and her jaw drops.
“I— Um—”
“Oh, maybe we could just go and… drink some pumpkin juice together?”
“Oh!” He definitely remembers that. “But then… don’t you think Ron is right? Don’t you think it’s possible he vanished his hearing and… my eyesight?”
Potter leans his forehead against the window and even though Draco can’t see his face, he can hear the dread in his voice. “He—He… um… He isn’t as experienced as I am.”
“Running away doesn’t seem like you.”
Draco stares after him, not realising that he has collapsed to his knees. The cold air ruffles his hair; it feels like he’s being flogged. How can this be happening? How could Draco let this happen? How could he let himself get close enough to Potter to care? When had that even happened? And what the fuck is he supposed to do now? Stand here and wait? Let his heart be broken into pieces as he slowly realises Potter isn’t coming back?
“God, can you imagine? Besides, you were supposed to keep an eye on me. You know what happens when I drink.”
Draco doesn’t know what to say. It’s obvious Potter was close to his godfather and the way he talks about Lupin indicates the same. The horrible realisation that Potter lost so many loved ones washes over Draco and fills him with dread.
“She thought I might want to know that my money is being put to good use.”
Everyone stared at his confused expression, before they burst out laughing.
“Oh, I see,” Draco snapped. “It’s because this is a charity gala and how in Merlin’s name could
Harry turns on his front and presses his face into the pillow. It’s going to be another long night…
“If you want to,” Potter said, panting furiously. “I think it would be easier for you, though, if you… if you were on your hands and knees.”
As he sat there, stroking Malfoy’s hair and marvelling at the fluttery feeling in his stomach, Harry thought it was lucky he and Malfoy apparently wanted the same thing.
“No,” Draco sighs, deciding not to say anything else. He’ll just have to watch Potter more closely.
“We’ve had some good times here,” he continues, clapping Harry on the shoulder while his eyes wander around the flat.
He bends his knees, slowly pulling down Malfoy’s bottoms. Even though he feels a bit more confident than he did in the showers, he’s starting to get nervous again. As his fingers curl around Malfoy’s length, he moves a little closer. Malfoy’s cock somehow feels heavier in his hand all of a sudden.
Potter only gives him trouble. He always makes him angry. So angry. And, to make matters worse, going to this school while this twerp is around, means always getting the short end of the deal. Because everybody loves Saint Potter. It’s nauseating, really, to watch all those nitwits who worship the ground the wizarding world’s Golden Boy walks on, swooning whenever they see that atrocious bird’s nest Potter calls his hair.
“What?” Malfoy blinks at him; he looks a little dazed.
“Making some extra money,” Malfoy grins. “People have told me I’m quite good at my job. Both of my jobs.” Malfoy does some sort of body roll that leaves Harry utterly breathless.
“Bring it on, Potter,” he whispers. “Oh, but no kimchi.”
“Fine. I’ll vanish them.”
Potter let out a humourless laugh and turned back to Draco. His eyes were full of sorrow and pain. “Why are you even trying to talk me out of this? Why do you care?”
When Malfoy didn’t say anything, Harry tentatively moved his hand down the railing and placed it on the other man’s.
“We should go to the Owlery, send Robards an update,” Draco says turning to Potter. He nods and produces a piece of parchment, a quill and a bottle of ink out of the tiny bag he carries around with him. He scribbles down a quick note and stows everything away in his robe pocket.
“Go on,” Potter says.
“Oh god, Draco.”
“Yeah, me neither,” Potter said, getting ready to get up.
It isn’t, though. And the moment Draco pulls his hand out of Harry’s grip and immediately storms into the storage room, it’s very clear how much more it really means and that they both know it. The rejection stings and Harry probably should leave him alone, but his feet move before his mind can stop him. With a quick glance over his shoulder, he slips into the storage room and finds Draco with his back to him. He’s gripping one of the shelves, his head bowed. Harry isn’t sure if he heard him come in, and approaches him cautiously.
“Lumos.”
“You’re wearing the socks,” Harry remarked.
Draco slowly cocks his head. He knows he shouldn’t, but the urge to go and find the owner of the mysterious voice suddenly grows so strong, his body moves of its own accord. The voice sounds familiar. He’s heard it before.
“You do realise the way you looked in school wasn’t healthy, right? Now, you finally look like a person, not like a skeleton.”
He decided to simply ignore him. There was only one problem. Malfoy didn’t ignore him.
Even when they’re fighting and they’re both in a bad mood, they briefly forget about it when it’s 3:50 on a Friday. Like right now. They had an argument last night about Harry getting a motorcycle. Draco just doesn’t get why Harry would want to spend that much money on something that will probably kill him. They both fell asleep with a scowl on their face and they didn’t talk while eating breakfast. Harry left the house while Draco was reading the paper.
“You heard me, Potter.”
“Huh?”
“What’s wrong?” Harry asks, his tone urgent.
Harry blinked.
Potter looks after him, his expression sour. “I really wish people would stop talking to me in riddles.”
“That better not be an empty promise, Potter!”
“It’s okay,” Harry says, trying to smile. He fails.
“Wait, define ‘like’,” Harry says.
“Oh!” Potter jerks again.
“Draco.”
It’s only a small consolation that Harry has seen Draco’s memories. He almost wishes the Gryffindor hadn’t saved him from the Fiendfyre. He tried to find Harry then, too, but had been intercepted by Crabbe and Goyle. Confronting Harry had been risky and even though he had known he couldn’t blow his cover in front of them just yet, he was seconds away from turning around and pointing his wand at his former friends.
“So did—did—” Potter gulps. “Did my soul kill those students?”
“Everything you just said— We’re on opposing sides. Only one of us is going to win.”
Harry tells himself.
He jumped, his head whipping up so fast he suddenly felt dizzy. And… confused. Was he… seeing things? Was he just imagining Potter standing in the doorway? Or… was he actually going crazy?
When Potter showed up at the manor, face hideous and deformed from a stinging hex, Draco knew beyond a doubt it was Potter. The string reached, and if Draco had to name it, it felt like it was begging Draco to let it attach to it's twin on Potter's dirt smudged hand. Instead, Draco pulled away and lied to his father, lied to Aunt Bella, and by doing so, lied to the Dark Lord. His gut told him to lie. Told him not to continue on doing these horrible things. He was so afraid, though. Afraid to die. Afraid to lose his family. Afraid to just
It was beautiful, the way Malfoy's body melted as his fist worked back and forth. His nose scrunched up and he bared his teeth like an animal all before hot shots of white cum hit Harry's cheek, streaking his right brow and the hair covering his scar, just barely missing his glasses.
“Good boy,” the voice whispered. Harry gasped, feeling his entire body flush at being called a good boy. He had never had that sort of reaction to those words before. It was most likely the knowledge of what was to come with those words that made Harry want to cum already.
Draco gulped and held out his right hand, trying not to glance at the string as it practically dragged his hand closer. "Potter. Sorry about that. I-..." he took a deep breath and actually said something he had wanted to say for a while. "Thank you for saving me from the Fiendfyre that night."
“A bit,” Theo said, “but it’s not like that’s
Weasley looked up. “If your broom’s having trouble, you should talk to Ginny,” he said, his normal voice ungodly loud after hours of silent studying. “She knows loads about broom care.”
thinks something’s up with you two and me, and with Macmillan too now—”
“Well,” Theo said, “in the terms of Blaise's contract—”
“It’s just,” Macmillan said, still giggling, “I didn’t even want to come here in the first place. This was all Justin’s idea, and I— I couldn’t just tell him no, so I went with it. And then he got Seamus and Dean involved, and they got Parkinson in on it, and now…” He gestured to the table. “Now it’s a whole
When the subject inevitably came up that Draco spontaneously had to visit his mother at the exact same time that Potter was needed to discuss a legal issue regarding his house— over
“Harry, I think he’s about to cry,” Draco said, in genuine surprise. “What do I do?”
“A lot of people knew,” Theo said.
At the start of the month, these urgent implorations had little to no effect on the rest of the eighth-year class. But once the sun emerged a few times and the threat of spring crested the horizon, some of them conceded that yes, perhaps time was starting to thin. Parvati Patil in particular could be found at Granger’s study table nearly every night, a stark difference from the beginning of term. She’d seemed to think her Divination exam would be easy enough to wing, and had only now realized she hadn’t finished a single assignment from their advanced fire omens unit.
Draco shrugged. “You make me fix your coffee.”
By the next morning, the boys were all thoroughly exhausted. Theo caught sight of Macmillan two tables over, and gave a halfhearted wave. Macmillan returned it, yawning into his cornflakes.
Weasley chewed his lip some more, and then he looked at Theo. “Ten galleons, was it?”
it wasn’t pleasant. “I mean, where did you buy them? They look— nice.”
Granger’s eyes lit up, and Weasley clicked his tongue. “Of course,” he said, “that would explain—”
Blaise and Pansy stared at him.
“Don’t try to tell me I’m brilliant at magic,” Finch-Fletchley said crossly. “I can barely cast
Theo held no pity; Pansy had asked for it. He turned back to his book, content to wait until tomorrow to start working on anything. He typically pushed his homework off until Sunday, not wanting to taint the beginning of his weekend with too much critical thought.
“I told you,” Thomas said, prodding Finnigan in the side. “I
to throw away his judgement?
“They really did it,” Theo said weakly, watching how the Hall’s faux-sunlight reflected in the silver threads.
“Why not?” Potter was still flushed. “It’s not so unbelievable. Some people just want to do good things, Draco.”
The common room door opened and Potter swept in. He was soaked from head to toe, clad in his flying gear, and carrying a broomstick over his shoulder. The mud on his ankles dripped in his wake, and Theo knew it would be gone from the carpets by noon. The house-elves that still worked at Hogwarts after the war were so grateful to the eighth-years that they cleaned the common room spotless every time they got the chance. It was a tad annoying, especially if Theo left something lying about between classes. He’d dash back up to grab it, discover it missing, and have to rummage in the boy’s dormitory to find it packed neatly away in the drawers beside his bed.
“Fine,” Draco said.
Right. If it was this much of a fear for the both of them, then the truth would be kinder. At least they wouldn’t have to worry about witnessing their friends’ initial reactions. Theo set his profiterole down on his lap, trying not to get too much coconut cream on his robes.
Blaise, Pansy, and the rest of the classroom sat at attention. Theo took one last sad look at his own dragonhide glove, half-covered in dirt beneath the bench, before slipping on the spare. His forefinger poked out through the tip.
Meanwhile, Theo was perfectly content to live without Blaise for a week. It was a damn blessing not to have Blaise breathing down his neck every minute. Once he’d caught Theo talking to Potter in an empty classroom, and Theo had tried to convince him they’d been discussing the last Quidditch match and that he’d been asking Potter for flying tips. The excuse had barely flown, as Theo hadn’t even come to a Quidditch match since the start of term, and Blaise knew it.
“Desperately,” Theo said, and to his immense relief both Thomas and Finnigan began to walk towards the table. Macmillan, however, lagged behind.
true, and—
“Harry,” Draco said, shoulders shaking. And Potter kissed him.
The rest of them— Potter, Draco, Blaise and Pansy included— would be staying at Hogwarts. And for the next two weeks, they wouldn’t have classes to keep them busy for the better part of the day. Theo only had to glance at Draco and catch the self-satisfied smirk on his face to know precisely what he and Potter would be doing whenever they found the chance.
“It’s enchanted, you know,” Finnigan told Macmillan. “Y’can’t move or anything, you just have to sit there and answer whatever they ask you.”
He looked out the window, at the snow-covered shops lining Hogsmeade from bottom to top. They looked like freshly frosted gingerbread houses, complete with twinkling lights and happily swinging signs. He could see a few students pass by without even looking in the window. Every Christmas a few students would come in to buy a fancy quill or a nice looking notebook for a friend they weren’t particularly close to, but that wasn’t where Scrivenshaft’s made their money. Hogwarts ordered parchment, ink, and quills on a very reliable basis, and they were near enough that delivery was easy and efficient. Justin always met Theo at the station, and they’d sign the necessary paperwork back in his office over a pot of tea, or a plate of fresh pastries if Molrey was around.
together,” Draco added. “That wouldn't kill you either.”
“Yeah!” Ernie stuffed the parchment into his pocket. Theo heard it crunch. “I got lucky, though, Hannah knows someone who knows someone who’s an editor for their sports section, and
At that thought, a bush on the opposite wall flowered.
“We might have squeezed it out of them,” Blaise said, making Weasley snort. “You know what this means, Theo,” he added, with an air of sadness that Theo didn’t believe for a second. “You broke the contract, so I’m afraid the pool goes to the bet writing team. Which consists of…” He broke off, pretending to think. “Me.”
“All right,” Percy said at last. He offered his hand to Potter and pulled him into the grate. “But if they won’t let you speak, you
Theo sensed the glare just in time. He looked down at his book and felt her gaze scrape his forehead. After a moment she decided nothing was amiss, and the weight of her stare lifted as she focused her attention back on Potter.
Theo said through gritted teeth. Potter was making a complicated gesture with his hands in an effort to convince Draco to let him sit on the chair first. Draco, who had his arms folded, didn’t look convinced.
Weasley jumped about a mile in the air, looking like a niffler caught stealing the crown jewels. “Er,” he said, “Theo. Hello. I was just...” Weasley trailed off, looking around the dorm to check who else was there. When he found no one, he nodded to himself then turned back to Theo.
“Well,” Potter said.
“Bloody bollocking
“There’s a binding contract,” Blaise said authoritatively. “We’ve all signed it. 'No participant can force, coerce, or otherwise influence the concerned parties into divulging pertinent information, through action or lack thereof.'”
“Ron’s— different.” Potter pushed his hair out of his eyes. It fell right back in his face.
He had a very bossy personality. Theo wondered what it must have been like to grow up with him as an older brother. Weasley had testified somewhere in the middle, and had nearly been found in contempt of court when he’d tried to talk to his brother. Granger had been a bit smarter about it, not even acknowledging Percy as she made her way out the door.
“Ooh, profiteroles,” Thomas said suddenly. “Mind if I grab one? You’ve got enough to feed the castle.”
Thanks again to my wonderful, wonderful beta reader
“Okay,” he said, and brushed Pansy’s crackers off Thomas’s notes and onto the floor. “So—”
“Goyle?” Finnigan said blankly. “Gregory Goyle?” He looked at Potter. “But isn’t he in Azkaban?”
Potter hadn’t batted an eye. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he told Draco now, folding his arms. Theo, who was standing between them, stayed silent.
“Again?” Thomas asked.
“Suit yourself.” Potter patted her shoulder, and Granger tried her best not to wince at the mess of rainwater, burrs, and mud that was now on her sleeve. Theo hid a silent laugh behind his book, just in case she glanced his way. She’d been
“Perfect?” Granger echoed. “What part of this is perfect?”
“Uh,” Theo said. “Finnigan, Thomas, er.” He looked at Draco. This was a mistake.
“Sorry,” Finch-Fletchley said, “I— didn’t think anyone else would be here.”
He shook his head in faint disbelief. It would have been funny if the situation wasn’t so dire.
“Cheers to that,” said Ernie Macmillan, stepping forward.
“Ron,” Granger was saying, “you didn’t answer me, why didn’t you tell me you’d changed plans? I would have met you at the station, you know.”
And thanks to everyone who followed this all the way through! It was a blast to write and even more fun to share :)
Granger ran a hand over her face. Weasley however, looked intrigued. “How many people are betting?”
Thunder boomed.
and then pressed the number
“Er— yes,” Theo said, bewildered. “That would be great. Thank you.”
Theo gave Blaise and Pansy a
“Will do,” Macmillan said. “Though, d’you think we could just explain that we’re not, you know… on a date?”
“Dean,” Potter said weakly. “Seamus, Ernie..”
Personally, Theo wholeheartedly agreed with Blaise. But of course Blaise wasn’t to know that. “What?” he said blankly.
“Just—” Macmillan, still red, looked down at the table. “I—” He clamped his mouth shut. “Never mind,” he said tightly. “You can go. I don’t know what I’m saying.”
“Oh, let him slack off if he wants to,” drawled a voice from the fireplace. Potter and Granger turned abruptly to stare at the back of the chair by the fire, behind which a pair of legs could be seen dangling off the armrest.
badges around their necks.
“No, but...” Finch-Fletchley closed his notebook and set it beside his parchment, keeping his eyes safely on the table. “You’re right that most Muggles don’t know how they really work. They’ll probably ask which Muggle devices actually use batteries. Like clocks and remote controls, and stuff.”
“No one even had this week,” Blaise said, disappointment ebbing off him in thick, depressing waves.
coming from miles away. They’d always flourished in each other’s company, even if they hadn’t realized it at first.
“Theo.”
This was an agreeable compromise. Granger nodded. “Anything you’ll need extra help with?”
She pointed at a complicated looking diagram in the corner. “I thought there were only four.”
Surreptitiously, Theo slid his second dragonhide glove off the table and kicked it under the bench. “Damn,” he said loudly, “I only grabbed one glove. Hang on, I’ve got to get a spare.”
Not five minutes later he heard the door to the kitchens open, though he couldn’t see it from where he sat. Theo sighed, held his book up over his face, and hoped that whoever it was would have enough sense to read his
you. Not like that!” he added, at Theo’s panicked expression. “He just— it’s odd, all right? I thought, out of everyone, the Gryffindors would hold off on trusting you.”
A moment later, a plump woman in a frilly apron came over and set two menus in front of them, along with a three-tiered stack of pastries. She left quickly, giving Theo an over-exaggerated wink.
“Nope,” Theo said, not bothered in the slightest by the jibe. Pansy had taken to patting him pityingly on the arm whenever she saw him. It had been irritating for the first few days, but Theo was starting to appreciate it a little. He didn’t personally know what it was like to pine after a forbidden lover, but he imagined Valentine’s day wouldn’t have been pleasant if he was. He began cutting into his sausages. “Draco,” he said, spearing one with his fork. “Get me some coffee, won’t you?”
“Granger’s been hounding me about our Arithmancy project.” Draco groaned. “I did my entire half using the Chaldean method.” When this received no response, he stabbed his knife down, cutting the stack of pancakes into neat quarters. “We were supposed to use the Agrippan,” he said, scowling down at the swirl of lemon and sugar beneath him. “And
“Wow!” Theo blurted out, “where— did you get those brooms?”
“Oh, perfect, we can just ask him,” Pansy said, and turned. The door blocked Potter and Draco from view, but only barely. If it stayed open much longer, someone was bound to notice them.
“You owe me!” Theo roared, not caring what attention he attracted. Draco would deserve it. “You’re going to buy me my own
Their view of the Gryffindor table was blocked quite suddenly as Draco sat down opposite them, his back to the rest of the hall. He looked extremely disheveled. His hair was sticking up in the back, his shirt was a wrinkled mess, and—
“But—
“No, I don’t,” he said slowly, trying not to let his frustration show. “But it’s not like he’s spent the last year cursing anyone who walks in his path,” he added quickly. “He and Granger still don’t get along, but he never so much as hexed her.” Theo wasn’t totally sure about that last point, but he tried not to let that show either.
“Out of the question,” Percy Weasley said stiffly.
Potter sighed. “It’s
not part of you all, because
is one of the Interrogators. The only version of Malfoy he’s ever known was the old one. You know, the pompous, stuck-up prat who threatened to sic his daddy on us if we didn’t lick his boots?”
“Yes, it was.” Draco raised an eyebrow. If he noticed the palpable tension that had wound itself between Theo, Blaise, and Pansy, he didn’t mention it. “I’m going to the library,” he said abruptly, standing.
He cleared his throat. “What’s going to happen to Draco?”
Finnigan, Thomas, and Macmillan all stood up together. Percy sighed.
“Right,” Draco said weakly. He bent down. Together they hefted Professor Augusta to her feet and made towards the door. “Harry,” he said, not bothering to keep his voice low in front of everyone. “I didn’t—”
“Rubbish,” Pansy said. “There’s more to it than that.”
Granger called, but it was too late. Potter had reached the door and yanked it open, plunging his free hand into his robe pocket for his wand.
. Literally none of us are surprised.”
“Except me,” Potter said, appearing behind him. “Percy—”
He cross-checked the last answer on his practice test against the answer key, and counted up his total, ignoring how the air shimmered some feet away by the fire. Potter, who had the chair to himself, absently scratched his hair and turned a page in his book.
“Don’t let Pince see you with that,” Theo said, nodding to Draco’s stack of breakfast food. “You’ll be flayed alive.”
He was standing over Goyle with his wand to Goyle’s chest, red sparks shooting out of the tip at random. His hair was sticking out in every direction, his eyes were startlingly wide, and he was breathing in quick, shallow bursts.
“Don’t worry, mate,” Weasley said, at Draco's shocked expression. “You'll make do without. Harry’s rich, he’ll take care of you.”
“Yeah,” Theo said again, shaking his head. “Just— thinking." He smiled sadly. “By the way, I didn’t get the chance to thank you for standing up yesterday.”
“‘Cor,” Finnigan said. He swept into the crowd, Fudge Flies tucked safely under his arm.
Blaise opened his mouth, but Theo was faster.
“Phenomenally,” Theo agreed. “I make him buy me a drink sometimes. He always has some cash to spare.”
Theo normally looked forward to Hogsmeade trips. He enjoyed wandering down the same cobbled road of magical shops, seeing what had changed since his last visit and what had remained the same. His espionage work was particularly easy during Hogsmeade weekends, since everyone else was too busy getting their own shopping and sight-seeing done to worry about how Draco and Potter had surreptitiously wandered off together.
“Not really,” Macmillan said, taking the crumpet. He spread on a generous layer of jam.
But now he’d announced himself to the room with no sense of self-preservation whatsoever, and everyone watched the chair with baited breath. Everyone except Blaise, who shut his book quietly and pulled out a blank piece of parchment.
“Shut up, Theo,” Weasley muttered. “Tell me you know how to break into Slughorn’s study.”
recall correctly,” Theo said hurriedly, just in case Blaise decided to wake up enough to start noticing things, “we’re supposed to be in the greenhouses before dawn tomorrow, so I suggest you stop bickering.”
Theo did, as best he could. Dolohov hadn’t explained the finer points in much detail, but it was easy enough to understand that the curse itself was incredibly lethal and inflicted deadly pain from its victims’ insides, despite the outwardly appearance of cold, purple fire.
Sensing a deeper issue, Theo took a deep breath. “Well,” he said, “maybe instead of trying to figure out what he likes, you should think of something meaningful to both of you. So it’s about the thought, instead of the actual gift.”
“Eh,” Theo said. “I don’t mind waiting for a while.” He looked around the shop again, taking in the smell of fresh parchment, quality ink, and quills. “I have nice company.” He jerked his thumb at the window, outside of which they could see the purple-and-green joke shop shining through the snow, packed to the brim with students. Ron Weasley’s brother George ran it on his own most days, but during Hogwarts weekends he outsourced a few people for extra help. Once, Ron himself had been in town, and Theo had spent an entire afternoon just watching him frantically try to keep a shelf of joke toffees stocked.
Goodwin didn’t so much as blink, and for a moment Theo wasn’t sure she had heard him. But then she spoke again. “Mr. Nott, what is your relationship with Mr. Malfoy?”
“Yes,” Percy said awkwardly. “But—”
you’re concerned about.” He sighed. “Look, you’ve got a right to be worried, but I really don’t think visiting his mother would have been that risky. Especially if it was over a holiday. Don’t you think most of the Ministry would be taking a break?”
“Right,” Draco said, standing. He grabbed Theo’s arm. “Let’s go. Now.”
“What?”
“I’m not— afraid—” Potter let out a sharp breath, staring out the window at the lake. “It’s just… There are a lot of possibilities. Too many chances for things to go wrong. I don’t like it.”
Macmillan really did smile this time.
Theo was taking the opportunity to sort through his things while the boy’s dormitory was empty. He didn’t fancy clearing out his old clothes and garbage while there was someone around to see it, even if he knew no one else would care. He was just setting aside his pile of socks that had lost their mates when someone threw open the door and burst inside.
The scarlet-and-gold tie caught a ray of light.
“Us,” Theo said at last. “The Slytherins all had to appeal to the Ministry before the start of term.”
The room slowly returned to its gentle rumble. There were a few sour faces from those who’d assumed they were about to witness a full-blown dramatic reveal, Blaise included, but the rest of them were just eager to move on with their work now that the threat of a fight was gone.
Potter grumbled. “It was— a disagreement.”
“Harry,
It was the only plan he had, and it was going to have to work.
Pansy’s eyes lit up. “Hold on,” she said, “I bet Potter’s in there.” Abandoning the crackers, she sprinted to the door and hauled it open, but emerged a minute later looking sullen. “Nope. Empty.”
“It’s none of your business,” he muttered. “But I doubt he’d be interested in me, anyway,” he added sullenly.
Theo stared at the diagram in Draco’s book, which was covered in little plus signs, minus signs, and words like
Percy’s lips thinned. His eyes flicked to the crowd of eighth-years for a microsecond before landing back on Potter. “You heard Goodwin,” was all he said.
“You want to, though,” Blaise muttered. From down the table, Granger shushed them.
“Mm, let me close up.” Theo headed around the counter and rummaged underneath for the closed sign. “I’ll meet you at Madam Puddifoot’s in fifteen?”
“Right,” Percy said importantly, surveying them all.
Theo thought. “Well,” he said, “I don’t know. But why shouldn’t it?”
Eventually the buzz of anticipation faded away. No one had come to the door by half an hour, and by forty minutes most of them had retreated to the walls to either lean or sit. Potter sat with his legs folded and his head on his knees, and like the others, Theo decided to give him some space.
Draco bit his tongue, glaring at Potter. Theo was instantly reminded of their earlier years, watching the two of them face off when their biggest problems were who had booked the Quidditch pitch for the afternoon. He supposed he should have seen their
Theo braced himself against the shelf, knee bent at a ninety-degree angle. Finnigan hopped up, grabbing the shelf for leverage. It wobbled dangerously, bottles of Shock-o-Choc clinking together.
look and followed Draco out of the hall, trying his absolute best not to laugh. Across the hall, he saw Potter look up, see them, and drop his fork.
“You can say ‘together.’ It won’t kill you,” Draco said flatly. Potter gave no response. “You can say
“You heard him, it’s in the six hundreds somewhere,” Theo snapped. “It can’t be that hard to figure out. I’m sure we’ll be fine.”
“Millicent thinks we’re wrong,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes. “Her head is so far up her own arse. She put her ten galleons on neither of them saying anything at all.”
“The fact that Harry’s shagging Malfoy, maybe?” Weasley raised an eyebrow. Granger winced, but didn’t correct him.
The room took a sudden interest. No one had noticed Draco was there, which Theo could only assume had been his plan. Despite being the most dramatic person in the castle— besides perhaps Potter himself— Draco was remarkably good at remaining unnoticed when he wanted to be.
Draco hadn’t expected anyone to hear him, let alone answer. At Theo’s words, his clouded gaze began to focus. His eyes flicked to and fro, as if he could only now see the crowd that surrounded him. His fingers, which were threaded through Potter’s, turned white at the knuckle as Weasley clapped him hard on the shoulder. Beside him, Macmillan and Thomas were already discussing which Draco-related anecdotes to add to their testimonies, while Blaise and Pansy interjected with which ones to omit.
Draco found out about this particular bet, Blaise would be tromping around in pastels for a day, writing with an Itching Quill for a week, and regretting every life choice he’d ever made for at least a month. But Blaise was obviously trying something, so Theo didn’t correct him.
And he set off down the hallway. Theo jogged after him, a pit of worry taking root in his stomach. “Why,” he panted, “do you need to break into Slughorn’s—”
just hung back when things got important, and now—” He sighed. “Now I’m just here to fail a few tests and get a slip of paper that says I’m really, really good at being a Muggle.”
“That won’t matter,” Draco said, shaking his head and looking at the floor. His eyes were unfocused, glazed. “There’s a witch in the hospital wing because of me, Harry, who do you think is going to care about my
Theo froze. Above the house-elves' rummaging and banging, a voice carried over from around a low corner. Potter’s voice. Which meant—
“You little sneak,” Pansy said, grinning. “Does this mean you didn’t fancy Potter after all?”
By Saturday, they were all exhausted. The only saving grace to be found was that, given the circumstances of last year, the eighth-year class was allowed to waive two of their N.E.W.T. exams at the end of the year, to receive a simple pass or fail grade. It was a relief for most of them, with the notable exception of Granger.
The ones written to Theo, Blaise, Pansy, Millicent, and Daphne were fifteen pages long.
Pansy prodded at her steak and kidney pie, looking at Draco. She seemed to want to say something. Theo caught her eye and shook his head, looking at Draco pointedly.
But it was now three months later, and Slughorn had finally decided to begin teaching them the proper materials for their seventh-year level education. And while they’d consistently complained to each other for the last three months just how boring it was to relearn everything they’d covered two years ago, none of them had been properly prepared for the workload that came with a proper seventh-year potions class.
“Which means he won, fair and square,” Granger said, and cocked her head. “At least, according to your rules. They really weren’t that thought-through, you know. I’d have added at least three more addendums.”
Someone sniffed.
“I’m lost,” Potter said. “Enlighten me.”
“I went for the second one,” Theo said. “I like working with roots, so I figured it’d be a safe bet.”
“I suppose Draco didn’t technically confess,” Blaise said slowly.
“But,” Finnigan started.
There was also the problem of his family name.
No one else appeared to have noticed. The reverent hush-and-then-babble that once followed Potter everywhere he stepped had faded out a few weeks ago. It was November, and two months had evidently been the limit to people’s deification of Potter’s every move. Merely walking into the Great Hall for breakfast no longer earned him applause, and from what Theo could tell, he was grateful.
He took a deep breath.
, “has told me time and again how I’m not really supposed to be a wizard. I spent all of last year living as a Muggle. Now I’m back,” he said, throwing his arms open, “and everyone’s lived through this war but me.” He jabbed a finger at his own chest.
Theo, Blaise, and Pansy all shared a look. It had never occurred to them that the rest of their classmates could simply
Gregory Goyle was standing in the middle of the room with a wand in each hand. One was Draco’s, and the other Theo didn’t recognize, but he knew in an instant that it wasn’t Goyle’s. It was thin and spindly, and looked wildly out of place in Goyle’s fist. Even after a year in Azkaban, his hands were still twice as big as Theo’s, his shoulders broad and dangerous. His hair had grown past his eyes and looked grimy and matted, and his eyes were just as small and beady as they always had been— except now they were lined and sunken, as if he’d aged a hundred years.
Draco snorted. Potter looked confused. “What?” he said, “what’s going on with Macmillan?”
This meant Theo definitely knew the poor sod. And when he imagined himself spending an hour at Madam Puddifoot’s, he couldn’t think of a single person whose company would turn it into a pleasant affair.
Lucius Malfoy, along with five other Death Eaters, had been found guilty and received a life sentence in Azkaban. The trial was both quick and heavily publicized, and Theo suspected it was because the Ministry had wanted to deliver some good news as swiftly as possible.
Blaise repeated, this time bypassing the table in favor of smacking Theo’s shoulder. The neat line of ink that had just finished spelling out
Potter pulled away, staring at Draco. “You’re not going to Azkaban,” he said. “Not if I have anything to say about it.”
“I think you’re overthinking this,” Theo said weakly. “It’s not like he’s going to dump you if you get him the wrong kind of chocolate.”
“Don’t mention it,” Draco growled.
“What,” Theo gasped, when he’d finally caught up to Weasley. They were in the foyer to the Great Hall, and on the opposite side of the hall was the dark stone entrance to the dungeons. But Weasley had stopped short behind a large stone pillar, watching the Great Hall entrance carefully. “What are we—”
“Oh,” Potter said, looking disappointed. “Well, I’m afraid I can’t stop for long. Draco wanted to see me about something.” He frowned. “It sounded serious, I hope he’s all right.”
More movement from the chair. Instead of staying put like anyone with a lick of sense would do, Draco and Potter had decided to make a stealthy escape. Theo curled his fingers into a fist inside his robe pocket to calm himself as Potter met his eye and
Theo thought this was a bit of an understatement. If—who was he kidding,
“Yeah, all right,” Finnigan said, heading for the door now. “Ernie’s right, we should get out now if we want to catch the sun.”
They hadn’t made it two steps into the hallway when someone grabbed Theo’s arm and tugged him down the hall into the empty Transfiguration classroom. Theo reached for his wand—why in Merlin’s name had he made a habit of tucking it in his
“It’s saved my life a fair few times,” Potter said reproachfully.
Theo heard a veritable army of house-elves begin to accost the newcomer, asking over and over whether they wanted a plate of eclairs, or profiteroles, or lemon-sugar pancakes. He could hear whoever it was meekly trying to dissuade them away, but as it always was when house-elves were offering something, the task was nigh-impossible.
Theo personally agreed with Potter. While Weasley and Potter would take curses for one another in a heartbeat, the closest thing to a best friend Draco had ever had was now facing at least ten years in Azkaban after testifying against him in court. The list of people who would take a curse for
Potter stood at once, took the book, and handed it to Weasley without even reading the cover. “Percy,” he said. “You’ve got to tell them I can speak.”
For one thing, the Ministry was in the process of rebuilding itself from the ground up right now, and Theo didn’t want to be caught in the crossfire of audit paperwork. Best to wait until the new management had settled in properly.
“Theo.” Blaise thumped his fist on the table, over the blank piece of parchment he’d been poised over minutes ago. “If you’re trying to hold them off until it’s your date—”
“I guessed as much,” Theo hissed back, pulling out a pair of threadbare earmuffs. “But what happened?”
“I’m not,” Theo said honestly.
“Blaise,” Pansy said, in a tone of voice that told Theo they’d been arguing about this for a while.
“Right away, sir,” Molrey said happily, and rushed back into the crowd of elves. Theo wandered to the far wall, sat on a low stool, and waited, just enjoying the atmosphere.
“Bad luck,” Theo said, and collapsed into the chair by the fire.
“That fact aside,” Draco said, and his voice had twisted into sweet, terrifying false patience, “why are you telling Theo to win?”
None of this was out of the ordinary. Potter rarely showed his face before the last ten minutes of breakfast, and always lagged behind after the rest of the school had finished. In fact, since the start of term, Theo didn’t think he’d seen Potter once leave a meal before anyone else. He’d heard rumors that Potter arrived and stayed late to avoid extra attention, but Theo personally reckoned that he just wasn’t a morning person. The only evidence against this theory was the occasional morning when Potter could be spotted soaring above the empty Quidditch pitch before dawn on the weekends before any of the house teams had booked it.
“You’re friends with Macmillan now?” Draco asked, when he saw this.
the one shagging Potter once a week.”
Theo shook his head. “No.” He pushed his left sleeve up, showing his bare arm first to Potter, then to the court.
“Draco,” Theo said, for the umpteenth time that day. Draco stiffened beside him.
Theo headed to the podium and handed Goodwin her wand, which she accepted gratefully.
“Ron,” Potter said with some surprise. “I thought you said you were giving him a chance.” He sighed. “Well, I’d better go. I’ll see you tomorrow, though,” he added over his shoulder. He gave Weasley one last look that reeked of righteous disappointment, and continued on his way.
Potter hurried to help Professor Augusta up. “Draco,” he snapped, “help me lift her. We have to take her to the hospital wing.” He was so calm that if Theo hadn’t just witnessed Professor Augusta bursting into flames a moment ago, he wouldn’t have known anything was wrong. This tracked. Potter had faced Voldemort down with a steady hand. He had more than a lifetime’s practice keeping calm under pressure.
what makes the electricity. When the chemicals have run out, then they can’t make any more, and the battery’s dead.” He shrugged. “But that’s not what they’re going to ask about.”
“There you are, Master Nott,” Molrey squeaked, and Theo’s blood ran cold. “Is there anything else I can be helping you with today, sir?”
Theo wasn’t fooled. Draco had spent the entire summer coming to grips with his familial situation, and he hadn’t shown the slightest trace of sympathy for his father’s sentence since they’d started the new year. In any other situation, it might have been a perfectly serviceable lie— if he and Potter weren’t wearing matching
“No,” he said, as he heard muffled movement and faint swearing. “No, that’s— we’re good, this is great. Thank you. I’ll just take these, and I’ll be on my way, and—”
“Draco didn’t tell us anything either,” he pointed out.
“There shouldn’t be,” Thomas argued, folding his arms. “That’s the point of a fair trial.”
Several paper airplanes zoomed over their heads and into the capacious room, inside of which sat dozens of official-looking witches and wizards in maroon robes. They were sitting against the far wall in tiered chairs, and standing in the center of the row in front of them stood a witch, who had to be the aforementioned Goodwin. If it weren’t for the fact that she wasn’t wearing spectacles, Theo might have mistaken her for McGonagall. Her blonde hair was pulled back tight enough to hurt, and her robes looked like they’d been sewn directly onto her body and she’d never so much as moved her arms to make them wrinkle.
Potter, who had lagged behind at dinner like he did for every meal, was strolling casually out of the Great Hall, humming absently to himself.
Potter cleared his throat again. “Nott was never a Death Eater.” He looked at Theo. “You weren’t, right?”
Potter led them through the Atrium, acting for all the world as if he worked there. He cut across the Ministry floor with long, important strides, nodding to a few people as he passed and ignoring the stares from the rest. And indeed several Ministry witches and wizards were staring, not just at Potter but at the whole class of eighth-years. A few of them leaned towards one another to whisper— Theo caught the words
Finnigan shrugged. “You don’t know that for sure. From what I hear, the Ministry’s gone through a total overhaul. Half the people on that board are new. The overseer, Goodwin? She’s Head of the Department for Magical Law Enforcement now, and she wasn’t even with the Ministry until this year.”
“Malfoy,” Granger said tartly, “I don’t believe Harry’s decisions are any of your business.”
Weasley had just entered the boy’s dormitory, looking extremely concerned.
Finch-Fletchley scoffed. “Sure. We’re the same like—” He searched for a proper metaphor. “Like a Common Welsh Green and a Hungarian Horntail.”
“Whoa,” Ernie said, watching the wall-to-wall crowd behind the window. “They’re doing well, aren’t they?”
Potter was looking agitatedly between Granger and the chair, clearly torn.
Potter shrugged. “I don’t remember, exactly. Something about how I thought I was the only reason he was given such a lenient parole, and how I cared about my sway at the Ministry more than—” He blinked. “Oh.”
Potter, who was either laughing or crying, hugged her. “He’s hopeless, Hermione,” he said breathlessly. Weasley gave an offended
“And now I won’t meet with Narcissa because I’m worried it’ll garner bad
was no help.” He gave Macmillan a sheepish smile. It was surprisingly nice to talk about it, even if he couldn’t exactly explain why Pansy had set him up, or why he couldn’t back out. “It’s hard to get them off my back sometimes,” he admitted.
Macmillan had been the first to suggest giving testimony, back outside the hospital wing. And now he was one of the first to stand. But faced with the reality of stepping in front of the Wizengamot and being interrogated, he now looked like he’d much rather turn tail and head home.
Draco let out a long breath through his nose. “Fine,” he said. “I will try to be less.” He paused, trying to think of the word. “Blatant.”
“Marvelously.” Draco didn’t bat an eye. It took more than a single jibe at his choice of curriculum to shake him these days. “So,” he said, “what are we betting on?”
Percy toed the door open a little further with his foot, and Draco emerged.
Granger retorted, and Weasley winced. “I want to be tested with the same expectations as anyone else. That’s the point of N.E.W.T. exams.”
Finch-Fletchley had to think about this for a while. Relating to a Slytherin was apparently a new skill that still required practice. Theo took the opportunity to fetch his porridge and down most of it before it began to run cold.
After handing the rest of Weasley’s ante to Blaise along with her own, she’d begun to make meaningful eye contact with Theo, Blaise, and Pansy with alarming frequency. Theo still hadn’t deciphered what this meant. Was she disappointed? Disapproving? Keeping an eye on them in case they tried anything, despite having demanded a copy of the bet contract for herself and therefore knowing that they were forbidden to interfere? It was probably a combination of all three. Regardless, they all despised it.
Again, Blaise made to speak, and again, Pansy got there first. “They’re saying he got attacked,” she said, not bothering to keep her voice low. It didn’t matter, as most of the class was too busy gossiping to one another to listen.
Theo folded his arms crossly. “We’re just— acquainted. Now.”
“Not really my first concern right now,” Granger said stiffly. Beside her, Weasley looked red enough that Theo wondered how hard it would be to transfigure him into another grapefruit.
The boy’s dormitory door burst open again and Finnigan emerged with two broomsticks under his arm. Potter and Draco scrambled to get on the chair where they’d be out of sight, shoving it about two inches forward with a loud
“Hm.” Blaise cast a suspicious look at the chair. “You don’t know where Draco is, do you? He was supposed to help me with this.”
“I thought this would be easier,” Potter said softly. His penchant for the dramatics clearly applied to quiet situations, too.
“Wait,” Pansy said, materializing beside Theo. “You knew about the bet?” she demanded at Potter.
“I’ve got my studies,” Theo said firmly. It was as close to the truth as he could get.
The chairs all slid back a good few inches from the courtroom door, shaking so hard that several people leapt to their feet to keep from falling. Finnigan didn’t stand in time, and landed squarely in Thomas’s lap. Macmillan helped him up as they all stared at the door.
“Anyway, Zabini,” Granger went on, “your contract only prohibits two things. One is overlapping dates and times, and I assume Theo didn’t do that, or else you’d have disqualified him ages ago. The second is…” She screwed up her face, remembering the exact wording. “Forcing, coercing, or otherwise influencing the concerned parties— Harry and Malfoy— into divulging pertinent information, through action or lack thereof,” she recited proudly.
and the two wands fell from his slack, fat hands, rolling several feet away in either direction.
“You said he was going mad in there, right?” Theo pressed. “Draco, it hasn’t even been a year yet. You said he’s probably going to die.”
“Please,” Pansy said. “Draco’s an idiot, but Potter’s bound to have said something by now. The whole hall saw him. He’s not that stupid.”
They had a week until exams began, and after nearly a month of back-breaking work and barely a minute alone with one another, Draco and Potter had resorted to desperate measures. So now Potter took a sip of his coffee, turned another page, and absently dangled his hand off the edge of the couch. A moment later, it disappeared with a shimmer.
“No,” Theo said, “he needs some time.”
Theo had no idea who this was, but he could guess enough through context.
“Granger, huh," Theo said, pressing the one and only advantage he had. "I thought you were supposed to be on a first name basis.” He picked up his profiterole and took a bite, closing his eyes as fresh coconut cream met his tongue at last.
“Oh, and Daphne said they’d hold out till May,” Theo remembered.
“You’ve been, er. Spending a lot of time with Potter lately,” Pansy continued.
Blaise looked worried. “Still bad, though.”
“You don’t know that for sure.”
“Then we’d have heard about it,” Blaise said, shaking his head. “Whoever did it would’ve been expelled.”
Right. Perfect. By Christmas, they’d be chums.
“Oh, yes,” Theo said. “Hogwarts keeps us in business well enough.” He smirked. “Why? You want a drink?”
It was over. Draco was free.
“Buttering me up, Nott?” Potter raised an eyebrow. “You know you can’t blackmail me anymore.”
“Pansy,” he said, “here, let’s do a cracker. They fell under the table, could you fetch one?”
“Voldemort,” Finnigan muttered.
“You,” Pansy said. “Honestly, Theo. It’s not healthy, if you’re really serious about him.”
“You could always tell him to mind his own fucking business,” Draco said pleasantly.
Goyle put his hands up in weak surrender, arms shaking with the effort. Theo winced when he caught sight of the blast mark Potter’s first spell had left on Goyle’s chest.
“Wait,” Potter said, pushing him off, “you— what?”
It was remarkably odd to walk into a greenhouse and feel the temperature drop twenty degrees. But Arctic plants were sleepier and much more docile than their tropical counterparts, so none of the eighth-years complained. By now most of them remembered to wear their scarves, hats, and woollen socks to Herbology, ignoring the double-takes from second and third-years as they passed.
Oh, Draco wasn’t looking for peace or quiet, and Theo so desperately wanted to say so.
But neither of them said a word about the incident, and apart from when Theo caught Finnigan and Thomas surreptitiously passing Blaise a sack of coins under the study table on Thursday night, the rest of the week was uneventful.
“Dean, I’ll go fetch the brooms,” Finnigan said, and bounded up to the dormitory rooms.
hard,” Draco said, his grin sharp. “I assure you.”
Muffled voices shouted from behind the wall, there were another few thumps, and then a door slammed firmly. The voices dimmed, and so did the banging. They heard muffled clinking, and Theo’s first impression was of iron chains being adjusted.
Theo had walked into this expecting to hurt someone’s feelings. He hadn’t expected someone else to hurt his own. Well then, he thought to himself. He’d been right all along. Macmillan, Finch-Fletchley, Bones, none of them were going to give him so much as a passing thought— unless it was
Sure, he’d started out with the fool-hearted goal of helping someone in need— Draco, namely, with Potter as a distant second. And now everything had spiraled out of control. He was trapped between Blaise, Pansy, Potter, and Draco. On top of that, if anything happened to Draco he’d have Potter to face for it, and if anything happened to Potter, he’d have the full force of Granger and Weasley after him— not to mention Draco’s wrath stacked on top for good measure.
Theo shrugged. “Who else would he tell?”
“Nothing,” Theo said honestly.
Wondering what in the hell he was signing himself up for now, Theo excused himself out after Weasley.
“It’s almost February. I’m running out of ideas,” Potter said in a rush, tugging at his hair. It was getting long enough that he could almost tie it back. “He’s got a mansion at home, obviously he doesn’t
“They’re both dragons,” Theo tried.
Theo’s father had been a Death Eater, after all. Specifically, his father had been one of the Death Eaters who’d broken into the Ministry and subsequently been imprisoned in Azkaban at the end of Theo’s fifth year. The
“Let me know if she’s coming over again,” Theo muttered. “So I have time to choke myself on a scone.”
“You hadn’t caught on yet?” Draco scowled with Weasley’s face, and Theo wondered how on earth he hadn’t seen it sooner.
Theo smiled at him. Draco didn’t so much as blink.
Weasley looked impressed. Granger looked thoughtful. “You’ve really put some thought into this, haven’t you?” she said to Blaise, who swelled with pride. Theo resisted the urge to laugh; as good as Blaise was at manipulating his peers, he always failed to realize when they did the same to him.
“Fuck,” Pansy muttered.
He glanced across the table at Macmillan’s page, which was covered with frustrated scribbles. Beside Macmillan sat Finnigan, who had his quill in his mouth. Blaise, who was on Theo’s right, couldn’t seem to figure out how to under-brew his potion properly, and Pansy had given up on the Calming Drought problem entirely and was working on the formula for a Wiggenweld Potion instead. On the far right end of the table, Granger was giving quiet instructions to Weasley, who kept getting distracted and tucking locks of her hair behind her ear as she spoke. And on the far left, Draco was drawing a careful diagram on his parchment. Theo squinted to see properly— yes, he was shading the illustrations of his ingredients.
“Uh,” Blaise said. “Theo, what would you say, half a dozen?”
Thomas took the plate without hesitation, no doubt enamored by the smell of chocolate cream, lemon curd, and powdered sugar. “Sure,” he said. “Wow, Nott, thanks.” He grinned down at the plate. “Seamus, shall we?”
“Hear, hear!” Finnigan crowed, bounding up to stand by Macmillan. “Malfoy’s had all year to show his colors, hasn’t he? I say he’s shown them.”
“—a Mudblood sympathizer, let alone a fucking
Finch-Fletchley said, eyes glowing with tears again. He wiped his sleeve over his face. “I’m rubbish, all right?” he finished, folding his arms and looking down.
Theo blinked. “What?” he said blankly, and Blaise kicked him.
“Congratulations, though,” Theo said.
“I’m sorry for turning into Weasley,” Draco said in a rush, “and for letting Granger kiss me, and not telling you—”
Goodwin showed no response to this, not even an affirmative nod. She just continued on, ignoring how Percy bounded up the stairs to join the other Interrogators.
“By the way,” he said, “I was looking for you yesterday.”
“Somewhere in the six hundreds,” Thomas said, shrugging. “I did some work ahead when Slughorn had us reviewing.”
“If I’d just what?” Potter cut in, taking a step forward. Draco was close to crossing an invisible line; he might’ve already. “If I’d
“That’s all of you, yes?” Percy Weasley said. “I’ll be back when it’s time—”
“What you were saying back there,” Potter said. “I know it wasn’t big, but still. I appreciate it. To be honest, Hermione's been getting under my skin lately. I know she means well, and she’s just stressed, and of course I love her, but…  I wish she wouldn’t take it out on me.”
“I really can’t say,” Theo said, shaking his head. “You haven’t seen them in town, though, have you? I gave my equations to Draco to look at, but it’s been three days now and—”
along with a few nervous laughs. “Good,” she said. “The witnesses are now dismissed.” At the group of Wizengamot members that were holding Goyle in place, she said, “Escort Mr. Goyle out of here, please. And do make it quick, we’ll need your votes for the verdict.”
thing he’d decided to try out.
With a disdainful sniff at the blue smoke, Draco strode to the common room door and yanked it open, hopping out with practiced flair. Theo threw him a two-fingered salute, knowing full well it would go unappreciated.
fault.”
No one had expected him to speak. Granger looked infuriated, Potter faintly relieved, and out of the corner of his eye Theo could see Blaise nearly drop his quill, astounded. From the chair, a tuft of blond hair emerged. Draco raised a sullen eyebrow at him, refusing to grace Theo’s interruption with an answer. Theo took a breath. “Draco, to be fair,” he said, “out of everyone in the room, Granger probably knows Potter better than anyone else. So if anyone can guess what he wants, it’s going to be her.”
Theo pleaded. “I’m begging you. I can’t do this all holiday.”
They’d never been close, but it was still an odd sensation to realize that someone he’d once known was no longer alive. Theo had lived with Vincent since they were eleven. He’d been a common fixture in Theo’s life at Hogwarts, and now he wasn’t.
“Ugh,” he said, spying Theo and Pansy. He cleared his throat. “It’s too hot in here. I’m waiting outside, yeah? When you’re done with that lot,” he nodded at Theo and Pansy, “grab your brooms and let’s get to the field before it gets dark.”
Potter bellowed, and the rest of them joined in. The water evaporated on the spot.
Draco severed one of his jacket potatoes in twain. “No.”
“Unbelievable.” Blaise shook his head. “A
Theo took a crumpet and split it in two. He offered one half to Macmillan. “Want to talk about it?”
“It’s going to be okay,” Potter was saying. “We’ll— we’ll appeal. They all saw what happened. They know you didn’t mean to do it. It was instinct, your father—”
Macmillan looked heartbroken. “Oh,” he said.
“I didn’t know you, and now I do,” Macmillan said. “I figured it was probably the same.”
For a moment they just stared at each other, Potter frazzled and disheveled, Draco exhausted and thin. Even Draco’s breaths were labored. He’d only been in the Ministry’s hands since this morning, and he already looked like he’d been incarcerated for a week. Potter reached for him, caught his thumb on a few strands of blond hair that had fallen from the gelled-back mass.
“And I’m also sorry, but much less so, for Confunding Weasley afterwards so he wouldn’t realize—”
“How dare you,” Draco seethed. “How dare you bring him up—”
“Right,” Draco said promptly, the moment he saw Theo. “So, how many galleons is that to me? A third, yes?”
I could put in a good word for him.”
Potter’s eyes widened. “Why?”
Draco’s wand hit the stage with a sharp clatter. “I…”
“Would you like me to come with you?”
“Hey, Theo,” Pansy said. “You’re in a good mood.” She raised an eyebrow. “Anything you want to tell us?”
“Bad enough to land him in prison?” Theo asked.
“Er,” Theo said. “It was created by a Death Eater named Antonin Dolohov.” Silence met his words, and his heart began to pound. He’d prepared himself for this, but standing in front of a prefect bathroom mirror and standing in front of forty Wizengamot members were two different things. “My father was a Death Eater,” he continued. “During the Easter holiday at my fifth year at Hogwarts, he made Dolohov teach it to me.”
Everything was different now. They didn’t need to rely on each other so closely anymore. School politics were becoming less and less important. Weasley and Granger had their own lives now, independent of Potter. And Potter had his, independent of them— as evidenced by the chair.
Finch-Fletchley hurriedly wiped his sleeve over his face. He’d clearly been crying for some time, and now that someone was watching him, he looked as if he wanted nothing more than to disapparate into the middle of the lake and drown himself. Theo empathized with him greatly.
“It’s late,” Potter said, and his smile was extremely forced. Theo tried to imagine how he’d have fared if he’d been placed in Slytherin, and couldn’t imagine him doing well. “I don’t want to bother her.”
Percy Weasley paused, then jerked his head to the door. “All right, then,” he said. “Off you go, come on.”
“Whoa.” Pansy sat down, peering over Thomas’s almost-neat scrawl. “Wait, what does he mean,
“Yeah,” he said, “of course. Sorry it didn’t matter in the end, though.”
Theo glanced, not for the first time, at the back of the chair by the fire. A pair of dramatic legs was once again hanging over the left armrest, but this time a shock of jet black hair poked out from the top, too. Apart from faint murmuring and the occasional low laugh, they weren’t disturbing the peace too much, so Theo didn’t mind having company.
“Well,” he said slowly, “I can tell you you’re wrong about one thing.”
Percy looked over his shoulder. “There’s one more,” he said. “But once Goyle’s finished, that’ll be it. Shouldn’t be more than twenty minutes.”
“And yet you’re dating one?” Theo smirked. “You have awful taste, Potter.”
“Well?” Potter said, looking desperately at the door. “What’s happened? Have they let him off?”
She snickered, but then stopped short with a little gasp and bent to scribble something down. Baise turned back to his potions work, glancing at Pansy’s parchment between every word he wrote.
“From what I’ve heard, I’m not sure I’m legally allowed to let you handle one,” Draco called, and he jogged up the stone steps and out of sight.
Theo had a sudden idea.
And sure enough, there was Potter, wandering in to breakfast fashionably late as always. Except—
By the end of May, even Potter seemed too busy to skive off. Granger had been right to chide him all those months ago, when he’d favored flying above an empty Quidditch field over doing a single homework assignment.
He kissed her forehead over her hair, which was nothing new, and gave her arm another firm pat. Her sleeves matched now, and Theo hurriedly opened his book to hide a smile.
Draco?”
“That turned into a row,” Theo said. “Come on, out with it.” Merlin, had they been arguing for a month straight? “Does this have anything to do with Christmas? Did I—”
This evening, they were all trying to calculate the ingredients needed for three separate Calming Draughts: one that would render the drinker slightly lightheaded, one to give the drinker a proper sense of calm, and one that was strong enough to put the drinker straight to sleep. Theo had figured out the first two, but was now resolutely stuck on the third.
“And I’m assuming you couldn’t just tell him you’d cocked up the potion?” Theo guessed. He got a grunt in return, which presumably meant
“We’re done!” Theo said quickly.
Potter moaned. “I’m a tosser, aren’t I?”
Out of the corner of his eye, Theo sensed movement— the legs had tucked themselves back behind the cushions. Pansy followed his line of sight, and Theo’s heart skipped.
Draco wasn’t faring much better.
Theo took one last look at the empty dormitory behind him before pushing the door open and rejoining the common room. Potter was nowhere to be seen. Hardly anyone looked up as Theo joined the table, but Draco arched an eyebrow at him before turning back down to his studies. Pansy cleared her throat when Theo sat down, and Blaise slid a folded slip of parchment in front of him.
he was shagging Draco?” Blaise’s eyes sparkled, and Theo knew he’d take it from here.
“Ron’s one of my best friends,” Potter said, “I can’t just say something like that.”
“Yes,” Draco said.
Draco kissed him, and Potter’s questions died completely. Weasley, red in the face, took a moment to process this before he sighed, shrugged, and folded his arms in resignation. “I guess we’re finally even,” he muttered to Granger, and Theo had a moment to wonder what that meant before the rest of the eighth-years descended upon them.
The common room door opened.
That earned a weak chuckle from everyone else. The lift stopped on the second floor and they unpacked from the tiny room, reuniting with the rest of the eighth-year class.
If Theo closed his eyes, he could almost believe he was sitting in the South Tower, listening to everyone study for exams. Thomas and Finnigan were the two loudest voices in the room, Longbottom hadn’t said a word, and Blaise and Pansy kept breaking off to talk to one another before inserting themselves back into the general discussion. Granger was loudly turning pages, while Weasley muttered questions over her shoulder.
Theo swallowed. “Sure,” he said, with great effort. Behind Thomas and Pansy, Potter and Draco looked at him desperately. He jerked his head towards the chair by the fire.
“No talking,” Percy Weasley snapped.
“Potter,” Blaise said, “Macmillan. You. All of this. You’ve been acting up all year.” He folded his arms and glanced around to make sure no one was listening. “Are you all right?” he asked at last.
Finnigan blinked. For a moment, Theo almost expected a punch. But then Finnigan shrugged. “Yeah, all right. Get your leg up, I’ll stand on your knee.”
But Theo couldn’t imagine what Draco was going to be like if, months from now, he was still in love but feeling the effects of having to hide it for so long. No, it wouldn’t last. It couldn’t. Draco was going to get himself thrown in prison. Or Potter was going to get himself a press storm from hell. Or both. Or worse. Whatever inevitably happened, Draco was bound to blame himself, forget to process that convenient information, and take it out on anyone and everyone around him— which really didn’t bode well for the whole
“Can, and will,” Draco said delightedly, stepping over Theo’s foot to the corridor.
was down to about one.
Theo grabbed the profiteroles. “Do you want these?” he said, holding them out. Thomas’s eyes widened. “I’ve had enough,” Theo said, heart twisting with every word. “I think you should take them.”
Theo ignored this. He adjusted the last bottle of ink on the counter so it aligned with the rest, and stepped back to admire his handiwork. His back collided with something solid, and he spun his arms to collect his balance again.
Finch-Fletchley laughed weakly. An elf appeared at his side with a plate of eggs— far too many eggs for one person to eat on their own. Finch-Fletchley thanked the elf nervously, no doubt worrying what he’d do when he inevitably couldn’t finish the whole plate.
“The trial’s being held by a witch called Goodwin,” he said, then knocked on the iron door. It swung open slowly and silently.
“Sure thing,” Thomas said, and Macmillan left. He had no idea that he’d just made Theo’s job a lot harder than it had to be, so Theo tried not to let himself get too angry. But his presence outside the common room door meant there was nowhere for Draco and Potter to go, unless they managed to sneak into the boy’s dormitory unnoticed.
Percy looked between Potter and the fireplace, weighing his options. On one hand, a last-minute defense Witness was unconventional. But he also had to know that denying Potter was a dangerous move.
Blaise, who had written the damn thing, nodded. Pansy scoffed. “Did you see his face?” she said, “did you see his hair? Come on, Theo, it’s so obvious—”
In the far corner away from the windows, he spotted a set of dark robes. Theo’s heart leapt— how was he going to do this? How was he going to explain that no, actually, he wasn’t looking for a date right now, or perhaps ever, so sorry— What if his date had gotten his hopes up?
“Some day, huh?” Macmillan said from right beside him, making Theo jump. “Hard to believe we were eating breakfast in the castle this morning.”
“You’ve had a row,” he said.
he repeated. “It was just— I—” Theo turned back to smack him, but stopped short at the pure look of shame that met him. “I left a— a mark,” Potter finally admitted, and that was apparently all he had the ability to say before embarrassment overtook him. He smashed the heel of his palm against his face.
