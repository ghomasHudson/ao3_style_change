Draco grimaced. "She's right. Don’t worry, Harry. You’ll still meet them. They were planning to stay for at least a fortnight."
“No. Those aren’t common in Wiltshire.”
Ron looked at Hermione and then back at him. He seemed like a man steeling himself for some unpleasant task.
"Harry, they already know that. Shira and I haven't decided—”
“Shhh.” Draco was behind him now, wrapping his arms around him. And, all right, the sudden warmth felt good. A tiny bit of Harry’s anger dissipated as he leaned back against his lover.
Ron snorted. “You couldn’t stop talking about interior decorating when you and Angelina moved into the new flat—”
“He’s not my favourite person." Harry swallowed. "But he is Draco’s father.”
Hermione gave him a sharp look. "Have you been part of this?"
“Of course. But I’m no longer inclined to. I’ll let you figure out the password on your own.”
Draco was amazed it had taken him this long to ask, though he supposed they had both been distracted. And he had no objection to sharing his theory with Harry; it was only Granger who needed to be unprejudiced.
He wanted to hear something about how clever muggles were, no doubt, but Draco was not about to give him that satisfaction. "I think . . . I think Bridget Jones is more gainfully employed than I am at present."
"Yeah, I would." Harry gave him a challenging look. "And you'd obey me."
Draco just stared for a moment, but finally shook himself into answering. “Yes, sort of. But Shira—look, I'm not as close to anyone as you are to Granger. And Weasley.”
“I do understand,” Benjamin insisted, squeezing his shoulder. “Come over here.” He released Draco and started away from the window.
Draco fell silent for a long moment. Weasley had a far-away look now, and small wonder. The war had certainly not been easy on him or his family.
“Always?”
Granger’s voice was amused. "While this, of course, is perfectly normal."
"Please, don't hold back."
Harry was stretched out on the ugly chesterfield at Grimmauld Place, lying on his back with his knees over one of the arms. Draco, in ferret-form, was curled up on his chest, semi-dozing as Harry stroked him with one hand and held up a book about ferrets—an ironic gift from Weasley—with the other.
Draco stared at him for a moment and then reached a decision. He stood up to announce it—more dramatic that way. “You want to know about my interactions with Dobby? Fine. I’ll show them to you. Tonight.”
She kissed his cheek. “Percy always comes around in the end. But how do you intend to handle your parents?”
Harry wanted to argue. He also wanted to chide Draco for the 'ginger paupers’ bit, but he'd save that battle for later.
“Yes, sorry.” He shook himself. “Just thinking back—well, never mind. I like that Benj and Noa are so much in the muggle world. And it makes sense, doesn’t it? He’s a muggle. And from what Noa says, most of her family actually live and work in the muggle world. They’re mostly teachers at muggle schools, aren’t they?”
He nodded. “We already talked it over. Draco agreed that I’d have the final say come September. And unless things don’t work between us, and he’s madly in love with Shira by then, I’ll never allow it.”
He shrugged again. "I might do, yeah. Someday."
"Really. Now tell me what happened with Arthur.”
"Just making sure. So why isn't he a Baumgarten, then? He married into them."
That stopped the conversation. Draco blushed furiously this time as everyone stared at him.
Harry stared at him for a moment longer, but then his eyes softened. “I do care what I put you through. And I am sorry. I thought . . . look, Hagrid will get to know you—how you are now, I mean.”
“But did that work on Voldemort?”
"So," Potter said. "I'm, uh, a bit new to this. But I think I am a little bent."
Shira turned and gave the webcam a pointed look. “I think Draco likes him too.”
“Yes. No.” Harry sighed again, this time in frustration. But he didn’t move his hands away. “He was my friend, Draco. And there’s so much I don’t know about him. And the things he said about how he was treated as a house elf at Malfoy Manor . . . the things he said about—”
Draco frowned at Harry. “I have sensitive information for him. Best send your elf straight away.”
“Idiot boy,” Lucius muttered, the moment he was gone.
Draco gave him a look of patient disbelief.
“I'm not either. You know that.”
Harry let out a strangled noise.
"Come in."
Weasley held out a hand to stop him from saying anything more. “I already said we’re okay, as long as you don’t disappoint Harry. Or Hermione.”
Harry grinned as he collapsed onto the guest-room bed. He was fairly certain that Draco’s voice—they were speaking over their mobiles—was meant to sound expectant. Perhaps even commanding. But he could hear the nervousness his boyfriend was attempting to hide.
“I am, so I’ll see if I can arrange it.” Andromeda would agree, wouldn’t she? Harry wasn’t about to keep his boyfriend away from his godson. Especially when said boyfriend and godson were related.
Suddenly Potter's—no, Harry's—hands were on Draco's shirt, unbuttoning it from the top. And that would be a welcome development, except there was no desire in his eyes right now. More like some sort of righteous indignation.
“Yeah.” Harry strained to keep his voice even. “Otherwise I would.” He braced himself for an explosion of anger from Draco, but it never came.
Draco scowled. “Don't blow my cover to Granger and Weasley.”
"No!"
"No, you gave him a decent game." He paused. "I suppose I should change the wards here so that you can accept owls from your family, yeah?"
So his 'dates' with Shira involved testing wildly experimental potions. That and the occasional trip to the Strand, a used muggle bookshop in Manhattan that was, surprisingly, a pleasure to browse. Sometimes it even offered something of use to a wizard.
Harry was unimpressed. “Come off it, Malfoy. You could have kicked me out of those memories if you’d really wanted to. You’re much better at occlumency than I am at legilimency.”
"Maybe we should reserve judgment till after our second date. Muggle cinema you said, yeah?"
He pulled off his tee-shirt. “There’s no changing Mum’s mind—not right now. She won’t have Malfoy at the Burrow. Dad has her back, of course. And Percy’s making everything worse.”
"He might be burrowed under the covers as a ferret."
But Hagrid had answered at the same time. “Ten in Azkaban would have done for him! Five, even. Don’t care how old he was at the time—he let monsters in here, Harry. Into Hogwarts. He tried to kill Dumbledore.”
“No!”
“Fuck. I suppose that’s true. Or . . . .” Draco’s voice trailed off.
But looking down at Draco, especially after this cock-up, he knew the truth. He wanted to own him, he wanted that responsibility . . . and he wasn’t sure how their relationship would work without the life-debt as part of it.
"But—"
“Sounds kinky.”
Draco’s voice surprised Harry, mostly because it had lost its customary drawl. He sounded almost tentative, as if unsure whether they were still on speaking terms.
"Bastard," Draco murmured. But he leaned over to brush their lips together.
"Stop." Granger's voice was harsh now, and her face was suddenly bright red. "I'm still not ready to talk about that. But there was nothing you could have done to stop Bellatrix."
“Here,” Draco was saying. “The fourth floor will do for Shira and Jamie. There’s a large bathroom they can have all to themselves, plus we can convert one of the bedrooms into a sitting room. Toffee, let’s give it a bohemian feel. We’ll see what Parisian artifacts we can commandeer from my parents’ attic.”
Harry seemed to deflate. “I know I'm asking a lot. I don't expect you two to become friends, but . . . he has changed, Ron. He doesn't believe in the pure-blood propaganda anymore. And he was never a killer. You know that.”
“It’s the tone, to begin with.” Somehow Draco managed to keep his face straight.
“You can apologise to my brother Bill, though,” Ron added, almost as an afterthought. “Reckon you’ll see him soon.”
“Why not?”
"Kreacher blames himself." The house elf gulped down more tea and then wiped his mouth with his hand.
Draco stared at him for a moment and then shrugged. “I’d like your advice.”
She leaned back against the couch with an odd look of triumph. “I knew this would happen. I knew you wouldn’t respect his fundamental autonomy—”
Hagrid had no notion of how a professor should deal with children or teenagers; perhaps that was the problem. Draco had watched him treat Harry like a friend rather than a student for years. Ditto with Granger and Weasley.
“No, Mrs. Malfoy. I’m just Harry.” Shit, why was he being so formal? She felt free enough to call him by his given name. And he didn’t owe the Malfoys, of all people, respect.
Draco caught it and followed the trio into the room. A picture of himself and Harry at the ministry, their clothes singed and torn from the explosion, dominated the front page. Their eyes, Draco noticed, were glued to each other as they walked into Robard’s office.
Draco watched as Harry landed softly, on his feet, in the sanctuary of the suburban and rather plain shul to which the Baumgartens belonged. He gave the man a moment to orient himself before tossing a yarmulke and hair clip at him.
“One of your Aunt Bella’s tricks?”
Harry would ignore her. He had to ignore her.
“I tried, Harry.”
It had never been a genuine interest anyway. Quidditch had always been more exciting.
Of course, Draco had been in his animagus form then. Pointless to feel shy in front of a ferret.
But for the second day in a row, he was up at an ungodly hour. Harry cracked one eye open: five o'clock.
There was a long moment of silence. Narcissa knew full well that Potter was enjoying their chagrin, but—with considerable effort—she pushed back her own annoyance. Potter was still the boy who had risked his life to save her son.
Draco opened his mouth to speak, but abruptly closed it again. In the end, he simply nodded as he took Harry's hand and shook it.
“Dunno, actually. We fixed up one floor as a guest room for them, though—that was Kreacher’s idea. It’s almost a proper flat. Draco probably wants to show them.”
Saying either of those things out loud was probably a bad idea. Well, not the second part so much; Draco already knew how much Harry enjoyed having his old rival under his thumb. Still, now wasn't the time. And, besides, those sides of him weren't the whole story.
"Yeah."
But Draco transformed before Harry could finish the sentence, and all Harry could do was laugh as a white-blond ferret scrabbled onto his chest.
“Er, thanks, but—” Shit. What were the chances that Draco had consulted Toffee about her wishes before summoning her to Grimmauld Place? “Would you rather be back at Malfoy Manor? Or somewhere else?”
"Yeah. Just when Draco wakes up—"
“Master Draco is . . . resting with Master Ron and Mistress Hermione.” Kreacher put a hand on his heart.
“Oh. No, that’s a man and a woman, actually. Married couple related to Shira. I think Noa must be a girl’s name too.”
“I have my ticket and my muggle identification,” Harry continued. “And an expertly packed suitcase.”
Shit. This was not going to go over well. “Lucius Malfoy was admitted. Ron already brought Draco home—he'd been up for forty-eight hours straight—but Narcissa is here, along with two of my house guests.”
"Ah." Harry untwisted and lowered himself again. "True. I like that, though. I mean, we should exchange numbers, obviously, but I also like the idea of you staying right at my side."
"They're behind us, so you gained a few hours. How are you meeting Shira and Jamie? They ought to be leaving for London soon."
Ron snorted as he smoothed the fur on Draco's back. "Yeah, he's half in his ferret brain. But we need to establish some boundaries."
George reached out and scratched Draco's head. Draco, after a glance at Bill—apparently to assure himself that the wolfish Weasley was keeping his distance—sniffed at George's hand and then rather elegantly butted his head into it.
Harry swallowed a smile. Draco seemed to take this all too seriously. "We've got other things to worry about. We have to talk with your parents and figure out how to transfer the manor to me."
“I wasn’t barging!”
Draco knew the voice who answered her: he’d heard the twins bellowing often enough at Hogwarts. And since only one of them had survived the war, this must be George. But which Weasley was behind him?
Jamie bit her lip in a thoughtful sort of way. “I think I'm on your side, Harry, but we should all discuss it. In person. Would you agree to that?”
But those had been positive memories. Now they would be passing into more negative ones; presumably ones dealing with grief and guilt and trauma.
But in Draco's mind, all he could see was Dumbledore struck by the killing curse, his body tumbling . . . then the wild flight through Hogwarts, Snape grabbing Draco by the collar . . . Greyback and the others flanking them . . . then the hut burning as Harry tried to stop them, tried to stop Snape . . . .
“You've got a life debt to me, remember?” he said at last. “More than one, actually. And the Malfoys, apparently, care about their debts.”
, didn't you? The original lyrics, I mean."
“He is rather devout, actually. So is Jamie; I presume she’ll convert eventually. But they both find the patriarchal slant of scripture problematic as well.”
"Oh, don't worry, Potter." Draco tightened his grip too, even as he put the Malfoy sneer back into his voice. "I mean to dedicate my life to obeying your every whim."
Draco glared at him. "A bit of discoloration on my fur isn't the same as this, Harry."
“I’d have helped you.”
Ron rolled his eyes as he turned toward Hermione. "When you're the Minister for Magic, love, I hope you tax all these posh families out of their inherited wealth and redistribute the money to poor wizards and muggles."
“Just to spite me?”
Fuck. Did Harry have any idea what that tone and that reminder did to him? When Harry was like this—commanding and concerned at the same time—he was irresistible. Draco couldn’t help but obey to the best of his abilities.
Ron's voice brought her back to the present. “All right,” he was saying, with a grin directed at Shira, “I’ll bite. What does kasher mean?”
Draco blinked. “You think—you think what? That my wand and I will be in harmony again, since we both serve the same master?”
"Harry!" Hagrid's mouth broke into an enormous and delighted grin, before straightening out with worry. "You're not sick, are you? Injured on duty? But I thought they'd sent you off to New York!"
"If I did, it wouldn't be much of a punishment. And, much as I would enjoy it in the bedroom, I'm not talking about something kinky, Harry."
But Harry didn't look away in disgust. He stared at it for a moment, without any particular expression, and then shook his head. "Draco, I see that all the time on you."
Potter glared up at him. “It’s more than an infatuation.”
“I was too fast for you, and I’m not sure you hated me enough for it to work anyway.” He paused. “But earlier that year—remember when you paralysed me on the train, stamped on my face and threw my invisibility cloak over me?”
Draco snorted. “Really?”
“Honestly, Potter, I don’t think I can. Not without vomiting.”
“Yeah?”
“Why do you think you reminded him of your father?”
On the the other hand, there was no petting and soothing afterward in a human salon. No Potter to apologise profusely, scratch behind his ears, and kiss the top of his head. No Weasley to smile down at him, utterly charmed no matter how much he tried to feign indifference.
Weasley went pale. “You didn’t—not with Voldemort!”
"Yes."
The ferret was on board with Hermione’s idea, of course, but demanded to be seen in a posh place. Harry had objected at first, because you needed reservations in advance for a restaurant like this, even just for lunch. He knew they’d make an exception for him, but he hated taking advantage of the whole saviour thing.
"You're right, I think. Sorry, Draco."
Salazar, of course she was still on about that. "Don't waste your pity on me, Granger."
“Why would you drive in Manhattan? And why is Benjamin letting you drive his car?” Draco’s tone was turning sour now. “He never let me drive it.”
“Look at Weasley! He as good as said it, didn't he? He’ll tolerate me only if I'm serving you. And I’m sure that whole family of ginger paupers will feel the same.”
"No it's not. Besides, why do you want to marry any woman? Aren't you gay?"
“I’m ready,” Harry said.
“Right. The wards at Grimmauld Place.” How could he have forgotten? “We’ll change them so you can apparate in and out freely, I promise. Meanwhile, we should have walked outside with Ron and Hermione. You could have apparated yourself.”
But there was something soothing about the way Malfoy’s breaths were changing from shallow and fluttery-fast to deep, slow, and steady. After a while, Harry's breaths started to match his, and the ringing in his ears began to fade.
Harry reached out and put a hand on his shoulder. “You've got a good heart. You know that, don't you?”
He looked up at him in shock. "That you didn't scar? God, no!"
"You're not going to win this bet, so it doesn't matter, but—"
"That's easy, Draco. Friendship."
“Dunno. Reckon we’re both more singed than burnt. Don’t think anything’s broken. Could do without the nausea from the petrol fumes, though. You?”
“I know.” Harry swallowed. “Draco—look, just tell me the truth. Robards is the one threatening you this time. Not your life, but with something, right?”
“Yeah.”
"Sorry. The massage is helping, I swear it. Please don't stop."
“Yeah. Which we both learned from.” He paused to shake his head. “I don't solve problems between us with fists or wands anymore.”
Draco let out a long-suffering sigh, but he didn’t argue. If he were to be completely honest with himself, he rather liked the idea of Harry seeing to him. “Very well. What does the letter say?”
Draco leaned toward him and kissed him again. Potter didn't object, so he moved closer. Suddenly both of them were pressing against each other and fumbling and tumbling back down onto the mattress.
She had never taken part in a debate on religion before; the subject almost never came up in wizarding Britain. Nor, to be fair, had it come up much in her parents' muggle home, which was quite secular—except when her disapproving grandmother was present.
"Wait," Ron said. "Why is it a problem to own a fortune in muggle coin?"
"Right." Ron cursed under his breath as he zipped up his jeans. "You can side along with me to the Manor, then. Once she's dressed, Hermione will wake Shira and Jamie. They can all meet us at St. Mungo's."
Harry looked straight at Draco. "Tell me exactly what you want to accomplish here."
“Back early,” Harry explained. “What happened to your arm?”
“No.” Harry gave him a wicked grin—he couldn’t help it.
“Right. But, er, even a person who doesn’t mind compartmentalising still has to learn to do it effectively. And that’s where meditation comes in, yeah? A disciplined mind is essential. In fact, my Aunt Bella said—”
“Oh, Draco’s not going through with that.”
Hell, in another era, Lucius Malfoy probably would have pulled some strings to help determine the next auror chief.
"Yes, I'm sure. I'll call in a few minutes; it's earlier there. And Kreacher and I will get you packed." Draco hesitated and then turned to the remaining Weasleys.
“He, uh, didn’t say anything about you when I first knew him. Not that I remember. But then I had him tail you in sixth year.”
The elderly elf nodded. “Kreacher knows house elves from frum families, Master Draco.” And without another word, he disapparated.
He grinned. "Yeah, I noticed. And you can call me Harry now, you know."
“No, you’d have heard.” Harry started walking toward the reception area, wondering if he could distract him. “Why come all the way to St. Mungo’s, Hagrid? Why not see Madam Pomfrey?”
Harry was dying to make some comeback about Draco thinking he could do better—but he realised how stupid that would be and stopped himself. When it came to fashion, Draco clearly could do better.
"Your new rooms are upstairs too."
"I'm not! If you want, when we marry we can both change our surnames to either Malfoy-Potter or Potter-Malfoy. Will that prove it to you?"
“I don’t think your own owl will try to devour you.” Harry was opening the window and guiding the horned menace inside. “This beauty belongs to Shacklebolt. Let’s see what’s so important that it couldn’t wait till morning.”
“Draco, that sounds perfect.” Now Harry was genuinely enthusiastic. “As long as you can make it comfortable.”
Granger sighed. “That does sound sensible.”
“Work here with you?” Suddenly Draco’s voice was dripping with sarcasm. “Think Cantor Fitzgerald will hire me too? My CV is useless here.”
“I . . . I think they are. Anyway, you can judge for yourself soon.”
“No, it didn’t. You lied to me, Draco. You told me that your father cut a deal with the Wizengamot—not that you cut a deal with Robards on your own to keep the man out of prison.”
"Fuck." Harry had suspected as much, but he hadn't wanted to face facts yet.
“Look, Ron—” He broke off and took a deep breath, as if he were about to face a dementor’s kiss instead of his best mate. “Even if Draco and I weren't together, he'd be around, you know?”
Draco looked to her and then Ron and then back again. “I don’t think I like this game of synonyms.”
Lucius scoffed. “Wrong, Harry. If this infatuation between you two stands the test of time, it’s all to our family’s advantage. But we’d as soon not have a torrid affair and subsequent break-up splashed on the front page of the Prophet.”
Lucius tightened his grip on his wine glass. “And in exchange?”
“Draco lowered his wand!” Harry was on his feet now too, finally shouting. “He wasn't going to do it. I was there!”
Draco rolled his eyes.
“No.” He rolled his eyes, but then reconsidered. “Actually, that might be interesting sometime. Hermione will think so, anyway. But for now—are you devout, Draco? Are you even religious?”
Draco bit his finger.
"Not all of them," Harry countered. "Hermione hasn't. Neither has Noa. Hell, Noa didn't even do the hyphenated thing."
They walked into a large room with lots of round tables, big enough to seat eight or ten each. The social hall, apparently. This must be where Draco had gotten into all those arguments about religion, politics and any other inflammatory topic.
"You don't have to bow and scrape to us to stay in our good graces," Granger explained kindly, as if Draco hadn't figured out Ron's meaning on his own.
“Arthur,” she said, “I believe you’ve met Draco Malfoy?”
"Both. Going to have a laugh at that?"
There were students all around, but none seemed to pose a threat. Some were standing in small groups, complaining about this or that class. Others were sitting solo by the fountain, pouring over their textbooks. And a few of the younger ones were cross-legged on the ground, snatching games of gobstones.
Muggle cash, he meant, though they were obviously keeping their vocabulary muggle-friendly and unsuspicious here.
Some treacherous part of her brain reminded herself that this could all be an act. Perhaps, as Arthur feared, Draco was only pretending to be respectful and subservient. But, again, what would he gain from that? He could have had Harry, and all of Harry's help, without the life debt.
He hesitated, but seemed to decide that he couldn't force a better deal. "Yeah, okay."
"They can't." Hermione all but stamped her foot. "Demands for reparations from Death Eater families have failed again and again—"
Shit. Harry really should wake him. And this whole situation—if it wasn't awkward yet, it would be once they were both thinking clearly.
"No! I mean . . . ” Potter blushed yet again. He was almost scarlet this time as he chose his words. “Yes, I mean. She looks nice and all. But it's a marriage your parents are choosing for you! You've already said you don't trust your father's judgment—"
“Then what will Master be doing with our bodies?”
“Yes, well, my ferret form doesn’t steal the blankets.”
Draco smiled. He loved everything about the Strand, even though he’d never been to the Strand proper. ‘His’ Strand was an annex on Fulton and Gold.
Harry wasn't sure what more to say. The Draco from back at Hogwarts would have never wanted people to know about the life debt. He'd have seen that as a humiliation.  And maybe that summed up Draco back then. Always worried about the image he projected; always terrified of embarrassing himself or failing his father's expectations. At least until sixth year, when he suddenly had more life and death issues to worry him.
He fell silent again.
“Former Death Eater.” Harry took a deep breath. “A former Death Eater who didn't identify me  when he had the chance, and who just risked his life in service to our ministry.”
"Yes, I know and no, you didn't." He swallowed again. "The dittany made the difference. Snape administered it on time."
“Yeah, Benj let me.” Harry knew he sounded overly pleased with himself, but he didn’t care. It had been cool to drive in America, on the opposite side of the road. “He was there with me. I didn’t fuck up at all, I don’t think. Not even on those narrow streets in Hoboken.”
“Toffee?”
“Well, that’s something. I suppose it’s best not to be at each other’s throats.” He paused. “Weasley, I know I’ve never properly apologised to you and Granger—”
After a moment’s consideration, Harry released him. They both shifted until they were sitting on the bed, cross-legged, facing each other.
->*<-
Ron was turning red. "Your whole family has muggle credentials and they vote and invest? After every bloody thing they said about muggles and muggle-borns?"
“You think Weasel is so forgiving?” Draco did that thing with his eyebrows again.
“And finish the job?”
“I didn’t name him after Malfoy. This is Malfoy.” Potter placed Draco back on his lap as he released his scruff.
Potter closed the door behind him; Draco caught only a glimpse of Robards at his desk.
Draco, she rather thought, had himself fed the Prophet some nasty stories about Potter. The boys really had hated one another during their years at Hogwarts.
Draco considered that. “It’s another simple one, but highly unlikely, I’m afraid.”
"Ronald, we talked about this—"
“But—but this all happened before he was an animagus,” Hagrid pointed out. “It happened even before Crouch Jr. transfigured the brat.”
"Perhaps I want to give up my name. Unless you can't bear the thought of a former Death Eater—"
Suddenly Weasley was talking, and Draco felt his brain snap back to the present. “Look, Harry,” he was saying, “I’ll walk Malfoy up to the castle, yeah?”
Malfoy gave him a look that was hard to interpret. He didn't seem to mind following Harry's lead, exactly, but maybe he was struggling with the novelty of it. Or maybe he was just amazed by Hermione's plethora of SPEW posters, each advocating for equal rights and fair pay for house elves. Knowing about Hermione's activism and seeing the posters in all their manic glory were two separate things.
Harry heard Ron climbing at least one flight of stairs. Then he heard a soft knocking and the creaking of a door.
“Wait. You always meant to offer me your services?”
Harry crept into his bedroom. It was dark, so he was pretty sure Draco was already asleep. Providing he wasn’t so pissed off that he had moved into another room for the night.
"You know I enjoyed the film. We both laughed and aww'd our way through it."
“Of course we did,” Lucius snapped. “It would have come out regardless and someone has to control the narrative—will you kindly sit down?”
"Hermione might start a new SPEW campaign to free you from oppression, you know."
“I refuse to believe that. Let me teach you?”
“To answer your first question, I keep them in this building but outside of the sanctuary. They’re locked away in various classrooms downstairs, but I’ll let you enter the room that will show you Dobby. As for the second question—fuck, I don’t know how to explain this.”
Not all the letters were angry, though. Some were delighted that Draco Malfoy was finally serving some kind of sentence. A disturbing number called on Harry to be as severe as possible.
“No. That would be overstepping. You’ve done quite enough of that for one night.”
Harry grimaced. "Don't worry. He'll know where to lay the blame."
"Oh, you're more than welcome. My parents will be counting on it." His voice was dry now. "They'll be counting on the six of us going out to dinner, I'm sure."
“As what?” Narcissa looked amused as she took a sip from her wine glass. “A closet conservative?”
Hermione furrowed her brow. Draco wasn't related to the Baumgartens, as far as she knew, so presumably that 'Uncle' and 'Aunt' were merely honorific, and a mark of the friendship between the two families.
"What's wrong, Potter? Scared you can't resist me?"
Ron had put that question out of his head just before nodding off. It ought to have been weird, he thought, falling asleep with the ferret nestled between himself and Hermione. But somehow it wasn't.
“I know. We meant no harm. You and Draco—you’re besotted with each other. That’s obvious. But we wanted to give the press something else to gossip about. We want them focusing on the fact that our son has enough honour to pay off his debt to you. We don’t want them speculating on how long your romance with an ex-Death Eater will last.”
“The purpose is to produce pure-blood heirs,” Draco added, his voice dry.
“Of course they did!” Hermione seemed impatient now. “Perhaps not physically, but they pressured him to conform to their warped prejudices, didn’t they? And to their ridiculous ideas of what it means to be a pure-blood and a Malfoy. And they bound him to Voldemort! Really, Narcissa should have run away with Draco to the continent or to America before she let him take the Dark Mark.”
“That goes without saying, but I don’t think it counts as a career either.”
Harry blanched.
“They believe they’ve penetrated much further than they have, in fact, managed.”
Ron released his hold on Malfoy’s arm, but he stuck close to him as they walked toward the castle. If Malfoy found that odd, he didn’t say so. He didn’t say anything at all.
And Draco seemed to enjoy the whole thing anyway. Not in a kinky way, though. Well, maybe in a kinky way too. It wasn’t as if Ron knew what Harry and Draco got up to in bed.
Draco swallowed. “I want you, Potter. And I reckon you’ll talk me into any label that pleases you.”
"That was not the sort of punishment I meant."
“He’s sort of Harry’s pet—”
“Um, why?”
"No, I'm being serious." Harry reached out and took hold of Draco's wrist. Of course he wanted to tease him over the ferret thing—he deserved a little revenge, didn't he?—but there was more going on, and he felt like he had to articulate it. "Because your father's right about me, you know."
“Yeah, saw that in the Prophet.” Hagrid shrugged as he set the cups on the table, his rough, enormous hands surprisingly gentle. “Sounds like he did good work, I’ll give the ferret that much. But why’d he do it? Weren’t out of the goodness of his heart.”
"Really, Kreacher?" he asked. "And why are you calling him 'Master?'"
He scoffed. "Salazar, Potter. You're so naive. I know his contempt for muggles and mudbloods—er, muggle-borns—is rubbish. And I don't have the stomach for his brand of cruelty. But we're still alike."
That was too much for Hermione to resist. "You always did want to be the centre of attention."
Harry blushed, but managed to fill her in without halting and stumbling over his words. Well, not too much.
Anyway, she and Draco were now setting aside their differences. As the only political conservatives at the table, they had to stick together to fend off the arguments that the liberals were putting together.
"What are you thinking, Potter?" Draco adjusted Harry's collar.
"How do you know I didn't sleep on the plane?"
“We’re not adding catacombs.” Harry made sure there was a note of finality to his voice.
“Ah.” Harry didn’t bother hiding the smile in his voice. Draco was adorable when he was ridiculous. “So . . . things are going well with them?”
But none of that mattered. It ought to be easy enough to be pleasant to Hagrid. Or at least scrupulously polite. Draco was a damned good occlumentist, if he did say so himself, so disguising his thoughts from the dolt should be a breeze.
“Yeah.”
He was grabbed by the arm and tugged over, and somehow the three of them ended up in something that resembled a hug. An extremely awkward but well-intentioned hug that was only interrupted by the ring of a mobile.
Harry pushed himself up too. And he tried to calm himself by silently counting to five. He made it to three. “Look, I know you. I know this would never be your first choice of a career—”
"My father. But it's entailed to me."
“Ah.” Draco looked as though it had suddenly all become clear. “Yes, of course. You told me your plan to swoop in and save the day for me and my mother. Playing the hero has always been a turn on for you, hasn’t it?”
Harry resumed his stroking. "Any objections?"
Harry wasn't sure how far he could push Draco with this particular line of teasing, but fortunately he just laughed. He stopped, though, when he noticed Harry looking more serious.
"For my pretty face, Granger, not my dick!"
"Time to hand that in to Robards, don't you think?" Weasley asked.
“Doubt that. But here goes: despite all the loud, well-reasoned arguments, this is still a place for contemplation, yeah?”
Now Harry was staring at him. “But it’s not legally or magically binding.”
The doorbell sounded just then. Stupid chimes were far too cheerful for this charged atmosphere.
“So you saved him too, in the end.” Draco was looking directly into his eyes now. “You saved my whole family. And then . . . well, like I said, you were kind when I came to you about my wand.”
“Merlin, Hermione, I know that.” He rolled his eyes. “I’m not acting like a jealous maniac, am I? No, I just meant that he really admires you. He’s not just sucking up the way he used to with our professors.”
"Are you talking about Malfoy Manor, Ferret?" Ron folded his arms across his chest. "You think Harry wants that place?"
Harry managed to grumble something derogatory in response. He had not willingly gotten out of bed at such a ridiculous time since the early months of auror training, which had been rather like boot camp.
"I would do, you know. If you asked me."
"You might grow tired of my snark." Draco resumed the massage yet again. "And you'll have to go back to work eventually, you know."
But Draco's choice was fine. Harry didn't have anything against Jane Austen—not that he'd read her either. But he'd been hoping, by some miracle, to find
“But if he does?”
So the saviour was going to be relying on raw power as he poked through Draco’s brain instead of discipline. So Draco was going to need enough discipline for the both of them.
That scratching felt surprisingly good. Perhaps it wasn’t so bad, sitting on the ugly chesterfield with Harry and Weasley, even if Weasley were the one holding and petting him. Before he could stop himself, Draco nudged his head into Weasley’s hand and started dooking.
“And you think you’ve got a say in that?” Draco tried to put his habitual sneer into the words, but they came out oddly flat.
“Really?"
Fuck, fuck, fuck. His hands were clammy. His face felt hot and sweaty. And his stomach was churning.
Harry frowned. "Er, they want Hermione and Ron to come along?"
“We aren’t boyfriends,” Harry said at last. “And if we were, I wouldn’t want to be his bit on the side while he got entangled in an arranged marriage.”
The slightest hint of guilt crept into Potter’s eyes, though his face was red with what was more likely anger. “He’s fine. I’m sorry, I should have told your house elf that. It’s not that sort of emergency.”
Draco swallowed. In his head, he could still hear her screaming as Aunt Bella tortured her. "Sorry, Granger, I didn't mean to bring up—"
He closed his eyes as he snuggled next to Draco, trying not to worry about telling those two all his news. They weren’t likely to react well.
“Well, we both need a decent night’s rest, what with Weasley and Granger arriving first thing in the morning.”
Honestly, it would be a miracle if the press didn’t claim that they were shagging each other raw every night. They kept looking at each other with a half challenging and half adoring gleam in their eyes. But Ron kept that thought to himself.
"They have one mobile they share. Not sure if it has a proper keyboard. And they definitely don't have that one with the virtual keyboard. Dunno about a pager, though. They ought to have one."
He had the grace to blush as he spoke those words; Harry had been one of the people he misled.
"No point in speculating, Ferret. Did your mother contact St. Mungo's?"
“Er, look,” Harry said, “About the marriage . . . .”
“He’s after the same thing he’s always been after.” Harry stared up at Hagrid, unblinking. “Protection for his family. And for himself.”
Draco scrambled off Harry, transforming back to his human self along the way. It wouldn’t dare attack a human wizard.
“That we have only pure-blood prejudices? No other racism mixed in?”
"You do not." Draco should know—he'd been scrupulously careful not to expose it around him. It hadn't been visible even on the night of the explosion.
They exchanged looks, but both agreed. A moment later all three had vacated the sitting room.
Harry smiled at that. “What about Benjamin?”
“Stop being modest.” He knew he was still sneering, but he couldn’t help himself. He had made his peace with Potter’s superiority, but that didn’t mean he enjoyed having it rubbed in. “According to the official histories of the war, you’re a brilliant teacher. Single-handedly teaching Dumbledore’s Army Defense Against the Dark Arts when you were just a fifth year—”
“No, I won’t bring you there again.” Harry’s voice was soothing now. “And I'm not going back there either. But, you know, you’ll see each other. And he’ll start to understand—”
He pulled the blankets up over both of them. Draco peeked out of Harry’s shirt, breathing in the scent of him, enjoying the weight of the covers and the slow, soothing feel of each breath Harry took.
“I can probably bring you as a plus one if you fancy a trip to the states,” Draco offered. “You have to survive a long synagogue service, but at least there’s a party afterward.”
Harry watched him sit down, blushing a bit. “It’s not a deal-breaker question, I promise.”
He had gone to Harry, fully conscious of what it would cost him to humble himself. It had been one thing to beg the saviour to intervene on behalf of his father. But to ask for that wand back—fuck, Draco had swallowed an ocean of pride.
Draco snorted. “You're definitely not the messiah or second coming or anything, Potter. You haven't brought about world peace or justice for all or ushered us all into some perfected world to come. Not last time I checked."
Besides, Draco deserved their protection. But she wished more fervently now that Hagrid had just allowed him to remain with them.
“It’ll be okay, Hagrid.” Harry looked tentatively relieved now. “Come on. Let’s go in.”
He fell quiet for a moment, but at length he nodded.
“No, I don’t object.” Goyle wasn't his favourite person, but at the moment he rated higher in Harry’s esteem than Blaise or Pansey.
And Draco was gay, wasn’t he? At least judging by his conversation with Ron. And the Prophet had outed him ages ago.
Harry must have voiced that question, because Draco answered.
There were no students about, so perhaps they’d managed to come between classes. Harry knocked smartly on the door, and Draco could hear enthusiastic barking in response. A moment later Hagrid answered, his enormous frame taking up most of the doorway as his dog tried helplessly to nudge his way around him.
"That's not what I mean. I'm talking about actual happiness and fulfillment and—fuck, I want to wipe that sneer off your face."
“Not sure,” Ron answered. “I don’t use it much, but it has its advantages. It’s flexible, and it allows white to get his dark-square bishop out early. I’m sure Draco will use it against you some time.”
Yeah, he did. Only this wasn’t just about Dobby any more. This was about Draco now too, and what Harry needed to understand about him in order to help their relationship survive.
They both quieted after that. But it was a good, contented sort of quiet. At least until they neared their destination.
“Yeah.” He swallowed. “Draco’s parents and Shira’s parents wanted them to marry for the sake of producing pure-blood children. They thought it would work out because both of them are gay.”
Shira cut in with a regrettably brilliant impersonation of Draco. “Saint Bleeding Potter. All right, he saved us all, I’ll give him that. And he’s fucking gorgeous—but just tell me it hasn’t gone straight to his head, what with all the crowds following him around just begging to lick those atrocious trainers of his—”
“Of course not. That might have changed now, I suppose, if they think I can provide them with access to you."
“Only under duress. Voldemort was forcing you.”
"If you marry me, Harry, would you honestly think of yourself as a Malfoy?"
“I haven’t said anything yet, but I think I’ll have to go.” He shifted to look her in the eye. “That doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten what happened to you at Malfoy Manor.”
"At St. Mungo's with Mrs. Malfoy."
Draco leaned down and grasped Harry's shoulders. "Or what?" he whispered. "Want to give me a real spanking?"
"Will you? What a splendid display of dominance."
Anyway, it was a good question; usually Ron and Draco played on the floor of the sitting room, each of them sprawled by the fireplace.
Draco snorted. "Keep dreaming. Now out with it. What do you want?"
Draco adjusted himself as their pillow talk turned to other matters—largely Ministry matters. They knew nearly everyone of importance personally.
The film was funny. Charming, even. And there was something oddly enjoyable about watching not only with Harry, but with a cinema full of strangers. Muggle strangers, presumably, though that didn't matter in this case. What mattered was the shared reactions: laughter, mostly, but some groans as well.
Harry grinned. "I can be kinky enough to leave my handprint on your arse a few times."
"Why not?" What did he have against Gringotts? Harry hoped he wasn't in for a lecture about the evils of the gold standard or the silver standard or whatever it was, because it would go straight over his head.
An awkward silence followed. Draco finally broke it. “Now what? Are you ready to go on? Do you still want to?”
“Yes.”
For a moment, Draco clung to a forlorn hope that Harry would make some kind of excuse. But the idiot was grinning in anticipation.
"Because of the way that fortune was acquired," Draco answered. "The Malfoys have spent centuries confunding and otherwise charming muggles out of their money and property. And, trust me, we're not the only pure-bloods in on that game."
"He will be."
At length, Toffee turned up with an onion bagel for Draco, just the way he liked it: lightly toasted with lox and capers, hold the schmear. He washed it down with an excellent cup of coffee, mixed with a generous amount of milk and sugar. He had just sent her to the kitchen with the dishes when he heard the front door open.
Both Harry and George stared at him.
Potter grimaced. "They must have temporarily charmed the scent out of the petrol; I didn't notice it at first. And I wasn't expecting a muggle bomb. But Draco and I got out."
Harry laughed at the snark in Draco's tone—and at the satisfied smirk in his voice. "Yes. As long as Hermione doesn't think I'm too tyrannical."
Harry shrugged. “But you know what I mean. If you could marry Shira and be happy, why can't you see us being happy together? If it's that you want kids, well, don't worry. I want some too.”
He spoke in a drawling, bored tone—but Ron wasn’t fooled. “No specific threat, Ferret, but we’re assuming there’s a target on your back.”
Harry frowned. “Skeeter got her story; it will run in the Prophet tomorrow. She knows that Robards hung you out to dry and that I disobeyed orders to fetch you back.”
"Well, Master Draco here wants to sign over his personal fortune to me. Kindly explain why he shouldn't do that."
Harry shook his head. "You've always been a selfish, spoiled git—”
“We, um, were supposed to work on it at home.” Weasley crumpled the foil and shoved it back into his pocket. “But then Harry went and rescued Malfoy and—well, we all got a bit distracted.”
“I don’t know what happened. That’s half the problem. He insisted on driving me to Heathrow to collect Shira and Jamie—but only me, so we could chat in private along the way. Get to know one another, Granger said. Not that it was her idea. Or, at least, I don’t think it was.”
"No. There's no lump. No one in the bathroom either—where'd he get off to? I told him to go upstairs."
“Idiot saviour of the wizarding world, you mean—and of our family.”
"That would be horrific press for the entire ministry. They can't sack him for saving an agent."
“Ah. So there’s a credible threat on my life?”
Draco laughed. "Or you're just turned on by having power over me."
“Why? Are his parents homophobes on top of everything else?”
Merlin, Potter was enraged again. Draco could almost smell the anger in him, all directed at Robards. If he were in ferret-form, he would be able to smell that anger. Someday he would have to explain that Robards' ruthlessness actually served the aurors well. But not tonight.
"Do they have proper mobiles? Or a pager or something?"
Shit. Hagrid could be surprisingly shrewd at times.
“Muggle?” Harry supplied.
"Should we stay in tonight?" Harry asked suddenly. "I did promise you that second date. You know, a muggle cinema?"
Now those grey eyes were actually turning soft. “No. You’re right. I can block you from the memories I really want to keep private. So stay. Eavesdrop to your heart’s content.”
So now Potter was up off the chesterfield and across the room. He looked frustrated and besotted and absolutely adorable. Despite his own frustration, Draco couldn't help but smile.
“Is this your impression of an octopus?” he finally asked. “You’re not about to confess to some tentacle kink, are you?”
“But I do intend for us to dine in here eventually, Harry.”
Harry studied his boyfriend. Spending his birthday at a muggle pub surrounded by Weasleys was possibly not a dream come true for him.
"Enough!" Harry rolled his eyes. "Did you prepare a room for, uh, Master Draco?"
"Don't you need muggle credentials?"
“Don't,” Harry warned, catching his arm.
He stopped stroking Draco and just rested his hand on top of his head. "I'm glad," Harry managed. "That's why we're doing this, isn't it?"
“I’m not! Look, I’ve seen you lash out plenty of times. But I already know the worst you’ll do.”
"We will, you prick."
“Because Draco was a Death Eater.”
"Potter?" Draco knocked on the door that linked their rooms.
Jamie gave Ron a curious look. “I’ve been on Draco’s side. Hermione has argued on both. But you’ve managed to keep out of this.”
Fuck. He’d been dreading that question. “I still despise them, especially Lucius. But . . . they’re his parents, Hermione. I have to be civil to them. And I have to spend time with them.”
“Draco is not his father, Hagrid.” Hermione attempted to keep her voice soft, devoid of any reprimand.
“Harry, why didn't you tell me? You should never have gone without backup.”
He grinned stupidly at that, the sap.
She bit her lip. “They’ll use you if you allow them to. You’ll be a boost to their reputations.”
“I am, if you'll loan it back now and then. It's my favourite wand for certain warding spells.”
Hermione opened her mouth to answer, but Harry beat her to it.
“Only if you wish to park. The girls could simply take a train, however. They’d have to change at Newark Penn, but still—”
Draco shifted a bit and placed his hands, now nicely warmed, on the middle of Harry's back. "How's that?"
“Or even a partnership,” Harry agreed. “Not yet. But we could still marry unofficially, in front of the people who matter to us.”
“Maybe? I don’t know what that means.”
A prolonged silence fell over the table. Draco was afraid to break it. He knew just how his father felt about Potter—knew how much he still despised him.
“I didn’t think it was.” Draco hesitated, trying to find the right words. “Dunno, really. I suppose I qualify as an agnostic.”
“I’m so sorry.” The words were tumbling out of Draco’s mouth before he could stop them. “I know you don’t want to hear it, but please believe that I’m sorry for the loss of your brother Fred. And sorry for the . . . for what happened to your brother Bill. Sorry for my part in it. Sorry that you were almost poisoned because of my stupidity.”
Harry shook his head, laughing a little. “Draco, I would never have refused the opportunity to put you under my thumb. Not from the day we met.”
Potter and Weasley exchanged glances.
“And you’re still stupidly easy to rile up,” Draco retorted. But he was smiling too now, and he kept smiling as he walked up to Harry and gave him another light kiss. “Resign yourself to Toffee, please. You’re a bleeding heart when it comes to house elves, aren’t you?”
"That's a bit limiting, isn't it? I'm relying on you, Harry, to . . . to give me some sort of consequence when I do something like hang up on my master in a fit of anger and hurl my mobile across the room."
Harry tried to shrug, but it hurt too much. “What can I say? I’m a romantic.”
The young elf in question piped right up. “Toffee belongs to Harry Potter now.”
“But I thought you didn’t care if anyone penetrated these memories. You’re purposely keeping them on the surface, yeah?”
But he didn't want to stop him. Potter had lost his mind, obviously, but that was fine with Draco. Especially as their lips pressed together.
"What about the music? That was a really catchy tune. Did you write that?"
The question caught Harry—and, okay, Ron too—completely off guard. What was she on about?
Harry’s brain struggled to take that in. Not because he didn’t see the logic in it; he did. But the mental effort involved in curating one’s thoughts like that must be overwhelming.
Harry shifted and put his arm around him. The warmth of him felt good, but Draco still couldn’t look him in the eye.
“Only listen, I know.” Harry paused to give the elf a contrite smile. “You’re right, of course. Go put your feet up, Kreacher.”
Harry nodded grimly. He hadn’t forgotten that Draco once used the imperious curse on the pub owner. “I know. But that’s not what you were going to say.”
Draco smirked again. "That's beautifully primal."
Draco rolled his eyes. “Well, you're the closest thing I've got to one, so go ahead and be suspicious. That's your job, I reckon.”
“Ten points to Gryffindor, Granger.”
"And that's something else I don't want: people knowing that's real. I don't want them searching for it." Harry swallowed. “You don’t really see me that way, do you? As some sort of saviour?”
Weasley snorted. “Better not turn into a ferret in his hut. Hagrid feeds them to the hippogriffs.”
Harry wasn’t impressed, although he didn’t seem to be in any pain. “No nipping. And you are a suck up.”
“Fuck.” Draco folded his hands on the table, looking as if he were about to face an interrogation. “I knew he’d come up eventually.”
There was no explosion, as Harry had half feared there would be. In fact, Hagrid didn't even look angry. He just seemed baffled.
She laughed, along with the rest of the room. But she found herself curious. She knew from Harry that Draco was somewhat familiar with Judaism, but not that he was attached to it. "Draco, have you really, er, found religion?"
“Is it?” Lucius gave him a look of polite disbelief. “And just how long have you two been seeing each other?”
Draco replied with a gentle laugh as he moved faster to match him. "More than okay, you idiot. Don't stop!"
"But I owed you one more for that stupid spell I cast during our, uh, duel in sixth year." Potter was bright red now. "I swear, I didn't know what it would do. I never meant—"
Draco did not deign to acknowledge the sarcasm. “Good.”
"They won't choose someone as young as Harry to replace him, will they?" Granger asked.
“Sorry if it was supposed to be a secret. But I know your families were trying to arrange a marriage between you two. And that you didn’t really object.”
“You knew I wouldn’t be, or you wouldn’t have stayed with them.”
His eyebrows flew up. “Cissa—”
Harry’s mouth was hanging open now.
“Fuck. Can’t you bring me straight through it?”
Harry bit back a grin. They’d both almost gotten themselves blown up right in Surrey. How would the Malfoys react to that? Had they even known about their son’s undercover work?
“And I deserved it, after everything I went through today.” Draco glanced down at his lover. “Which was all your fault, of course.”
Harry reached over and tugged Draco to him, until he could rest his head on Draco’s shoulder. “I'd best keep you there, then.”
"Oh God!" Shira sank into the armchair by the fireplace, somehow managing a dramatic pose that didn't look staged.
Ron glanced over at him after pulling on a tee shirt. "Your father's ill?"
When Harry opened his eyes again, Malfoy was still pressed alongside him. There was a pillow under Harry's head, though, and a blanket draped over them both.
“Oh, don’t worry, ‘Mione,” George was saying as he pushed past her to lead the way into the sitting room. There was a distinct laugh in his voice as he continued. “We won’t harm Malfoy; any pet of Harry’s is a pet of ours.”
Draco arched his eyebrows as the elf left the room. “Are you looking to reprimand me in private?”
"Harry." He paused to elbow him. "Again, except when we're in public, in which case 'Master' will do."
Weasley nodded. “All right. I, uh, assume you didn’t get any STDs from the bastard?”
"They might attribute you coming back to the resurrection stone."
He opened his eyes. Stone. He was sprawled on a fucking stone floor. No wonder his body was shrieking in pain.
“One might ask,” Lucius said dryly, “why Mr. Potter should feel he has the right to interfere with any part of your life.”
“What is it?” Draco asked.
“We haven’t played each other yet.”
“You’d have broken a bone. Yes, I know.” And Draco could have done; Harry was well aware of that. “But if you bite me again like that you’ll find yourself muzzled whenever you’re in ferret form. Understood?”
So where did that leave him with his father? The man would try to take advantage of Draco's relationship with Harry; he wasn't even hiding his intentions as far as that went. But even if Harry allowed that, Lucius Malfoy could not possibly be proud of the son who was now in service to their former enemy.
"Yeah, there is." Harry looked him in the eyes, trying to disguise how nervous he was. "If you're serious about all this . . . ."
"Of healing the past?"
“Yes.”
Suddenly, bizarrely, Draco was smiling. “I keep telling you: I’m not angry about that spell. I don’t blame you. And, honestly, I’m glad I didn’t know that it was unintentional. Because, Harry, you slicing me open like that—that’s when I knew that you had it in you. That you could defeat Voldemort.”
“You might be right, Draco. But I want people to know we're together anyway.”
Narcissa nodded. “There’s been more than one marriage between the Baumgartens and the American branch of the Goldstein family.” She paused to give her son a gentle look. Then, to Harry’s surprise, she spared one for him too. “Harry, you might not be aware of this, but pure-blood marriages are often based on a solid friendship rather than a romance.”
He could feel Harry’s eyes on him from his seat across the table. Not boring into him, exactly, but watching him expectantly. And a bit impatiently.
A distinct popping noise interrupted Harry’s thoughts. Kreacher was suddenly standing near the bed, and a large, multi-level, ferret cage was equally unexpectedly tucked into the corner of the room.
Draco, however, was by no means cowed. He had ordered Potter to remain at Malfoy Manor last night, and Potter had meekly agreed. If their sudden passion for one another didn’t burn itself out, they would likely end up more-or-less equal partners. Draco wouldn’t be trampled, at any event.
"Well, I learned from the best."
“Dunno.” He was still blushing, but there was an eagerness in his voice as he began to explain. “They’re all about the bond market, and I’m not sure that’s what I’d actually enjoy. And you want to stay here, don’t you? They have very few employees in the UK. And I don’t—Harry, I don’t even know all my options. But I’d like to see if it’s possible for me to study at a muggle university. It would mean faking credentials, and I don’t know how to go about getting permission for that, or what rules the Ministry has about it, but—”
Draco raised his eyebrows at him.
“Right. So sorry that this was the best I could manage while saving our lives.”
Ron sat in silence as Harry paced the room, filling him in on Draco's almost-arranged marriage into the Baumgarten family and the fact that Harry had forbidden it.
But if Harry had been acting under orders, the rescue wouldn’t have created a life debt. Or maybe it would have done, in some technical sense. But no auror would recognise a debt under those circumstances. And it wasn’t the same thing as Harry going off on his own initiative, risking not only his life for Malfoy but his career.
He paused and turned to Draco's mother. "And Draco is all right, Narcissa. And I'm going to make sure he stays that way. He'll never have to work for Robards again."
“So that Severus could do the deed and end his life as planned, thrusting him even higher in the dark lord’s favour.”
Shit. That was . . . that was fair, actually. “Me either. How bad are you hurt?”
“Can I walk out of this house? Or am I a fucking prisoner?”
Draco’s whole life was the wizarding world. Yeah, his parents taught him something of muggle politics and finances, because they considered such knowledge necessary to their own well-being. But, for all that, Draco was brought up with a severely limited world-view.
"Yes, I think we should postpone that discussion until morning." His mother stood up. "Draco, I'm sure you can guide Harry to the proper guest room? The one adjacent to yours will do quite nicely, I think."
“Right.” Harry closed his eyes for a moment, as if reaching for those memories. When he opened them again, he gave Draco a pointed look. “They were very loud and fierce well-reasoned arguments, then.”
“Home. I told him not to come with me. He’s—not happy, but he’s staying behind.”
Ron opened his mouth, presumably to snap out a response, but then abruptly shut it again. “Perhaps,” he said at last. “But my parents aren’t unreasonable, you know. And it doesn’t matter. This is Harry’s decision, not yours.”
"I know he served my great aunt. So I know how he'll feel about this, trust me."
Harry would probably be doing a lot of that in the years to come—Draco was a bit high strung. And a bit high maintenance. And completely worth it, so Harry started dialing.
Ron grunted. "I think I cursed him in advance for getting us all killed. Which, you know, didn't happen. So Harry was right: there was enough time to go back for you."
He could almost hear Draco shrugging. "Why not? I'd be exchanging a name that's hated throughout our little world for one that's adored. The advantage would be all mine."
“What did Draco do with my wardrobe?”
“He is,” George agreed. “But it’s working. Let him come over.”
“I don’t care. I’m not going back to that miserable hovel of his. I apologise for calling him an oaf, but—”
By the time he opened his eyes, Hermione and Draco—who was human again—were sitting on the bottom edge of the bed, chatting companionably. Hermione was still in her favourite makeshift pajamas: one of Ron's Chudley Cannons tee-shirts and a pair of yoga leggings. Draco was still dressed as he had been yesterday, though his shirt and trousers were rumpled now, as was his hair.
“Yeah, I know that.” Ron shook his head, partly in resignation but partly in disbelief. “But not being a killer? That’s a pretty low bar to set for a boyfriend.”
“But they did take place?”
“I was not whinging!”
->*<-
“Enough to break up with me over it?”
“You remember that I was brought up as a muggle, don’t you?”
“Er, what for?”
Harry knew he had to give her this much. It can’t have been easy for her to watch him help Lucius and Narcissa as much as he had done. A small part of Hermione had probably hoped that Lucius would rot in Azkaban—and he might have done had Harry objected to the public deal he cut with the Wizengamot.
Draco nodded again as Harry released him. "Fine. You should all see it, actually. You might appreciate its value. I just need a muggle laptop."
“Next week!” Shira looked outraged. “I have potions that are in the middle of a month long brewing cycle—”
Draco did that thing with his eyebrows. “Your skill in legilimency leaves much to be desired. You know that, don’t you?”
Draco shrugged. "It won't go back to the muggles, Granger. Someone at the ministry will end up lining their pockets. And, anyway, protecting the place for my family is part of my bargain with Potter."
Well, no. Hagrid wasn’t ignoring them. He was oblivious to them.
“You do, huh?”
"That's a broad statement, Potter. Care to be more specific?"
Hermione seemed to seriously consider that question, as if Harry’s faults were so obvious that she couldn’t be expected to listen to the specific circumstance. But, after a moment, she nodded and sat up straight, giving Harry an expectant look.
Draco scoffed. “Are you that determined to end your career?”
“Not tiresome,” Harry answered with a shrug. “I'm just not going to permit it.”
“I look worse than Harry! That ought to be impossible.”
“First answer: I want to try it once. Second answer: I asked him. Did you ever bother to?”
“What did you make of this, Granger?”
“Relax, Malfoy.” Bill tried for a smile to set him at ease. “I’m not looking to turn you into ferret stew.”
“Our relationship.”
"Draco—"
"But it seems you've placed him firmly under your own."
“Yes, a sitting room really isn’t the place for this.” Hermione pulled out her wand and furrowed her brow. “Those I suppose we could transfigure the hard edges of that table, for a start.”
“But you knew I wanted to help you. You knew at least that much.”
“Why do they suddenly need privacy for their game?” Hermione asked, glancing down at Harry from the small, two-person couch. No, chesterfield; that was the proper name, according to Draco.
Draco just shrugged. “I don’t appreciate being left behind so you can have a private chat about me with my parents.”
"You had a funny way of showing it."
“But you don’t see him finding happiness with a former Death Eater?” Draco didn’t bother to hide the bite in his tone.
“Or what, Potter?”
“And there’s another place he don’t belong.” Hagrid folded his arms across his chest. “After what he let in there, after what he did to Dumbledore—”
"Oh. Well, you know, after what happened second year—look, just hire a car, then. Draco will arrange it."
Draco had sensed that power the moment he met him, back when they were fitted for their first year robes. In their subsequent years at Hogwarts, he had both wanted him for it and despised him for it. Surely even muggles weren't oblivious to it.
“They weren’t,” Draco insisted. “They were well-reasoned arguments on religion, politics and all other verboten topics.”
No matter. Draco had something more important to think about than Potter's employment—namely how to tell his parents that he had indentured himself to the scarhead. And, worse, that they would have to find a way to legally transfer Malfoy Manor to him. Draco bit his lip, wondering exactly how to work around the entails that bound the property without technically breaking them.
He managed a smile. “Don’t worry; you’re the only one who’s earned that treatment thus far.”
“You’re not to repeat this part of the conversation to him, understood?”
“Gentlemen, please!” Narcissa took a deep breath. “There’s no need to discuss this now; September is some four months off.” She paused to squeeze Potter’s arm. “Harry, will you at least agree to keep your romantic involvement with our son quiet for the time being?”
"And that's your notion of family?"
There was a hitch in Granger's breath. "Speaking of establishing things, we—Ron, we ought to make certain that Draco knows he doesn't owe us . . . there's no life debt. We wouldn't have—"
Draco felt whatever little colour he had to his face drain away. But before he could comment, Granger piped up.
He was just drifting off, dooking softly, when a rap at Harry’s window woke the both of them. A persistent, scratchy sort of rapping.
Harry could feel Draco’s gut clenching with a mixture of shame and self-revulsion, but he followed Benjamin to a quieter spot regardless.
“What now?” Harry stroked him. “You want to go suck up to George again?”
Whereas Harry reminded him of the charged atmosphere just before a thunderstorm, Weasley’s scent was more like the calm in the wake of that storm, when the air feels lighter and less tense, and a general sense of relaxation prevails.
Jamie gave her a fond smile as she fingered the black silk choker around Shira's neck. “This isn't just for show,” she explained. “Shira's mine.”
But Hermione, who was laughing almost as much as Ron now, put her hand over his mouth. “Don’t say something you’ll regret.”
And Harry knew precisely what the password was now. And, at this moment, he hated Draco for using it.
Ron leaned back more comfortably on the bench as a gobstone squirted a losing player in the eye, letting off a foul stench. “Harry is family. Think he wouldn’t bring his boyfriend around?”
Hermione seized on those as the way forward, PR-wise. (After explaining that PR stood for public relations. Muggles used abbreviations for everything.) Harry was well known to be apolitical. He had never intended this life-debt to represent a particular side of the wizarding culture wars, nor as something that anyone else should imitate. So the key, Hermione swore, was to keep emphasising that this was just between him and Draco. It was important to Draco, on a personal level, to pay back his debt. And Harry respected his feelings on the matter.
"No, Potter." Draco gave him a speaking look. "We'll both remain here for the night."
Harry stepped back, closed his eyes, and spoke the password clearly and loudly. “Sectumsempra!”
“Maybe for special occasions. But go ahead and make this dining room as rococo as you please.”
Something in Draco’s manner shifted. “Like what, exactly?”
“Well . . .” Harry paused. How was he going to get through this conversation without insulting his lover? “It sounds a bit fussy. But that’s just me.”
“Okay.” Harry blushed, but managed a small smile as well. “That wasn't a proposal. Not yet. But you're willing to marry Shira, and you're not—um, you're only friends, right? It would be like me marrying Hermione.”
“It can’t be impossible for Draco to cast a patronus.” Harry pulled his knees in toward his chest. “Umbridge has one, and she’s a much more miserable human being than he is.”
Harry cursed his luck as he stepped through the window of the red-bricked, condemned department store that served as a gateway to St. Mungo's. He had all but crashed into the towering figure of Hagrid.
“So this is where I, er, contemplated a lot of the things I’ve done. And a lot of the things that were done to me. Mostly by other Death Eaters, I mean.”
"I tried to tell him Draco should have extra protection, but the car is first-class as far as that goes, and Draco does have a proper wand again. And my father is competent—"
"Oh, you are scared!" Malfoy's voice was annoyingly triumphant. "But I'll take pity on you. If I win, we'll just snog like a couple of young teens, all right?"
Harry sat down on the bed too, facing him. They were both freshly showered and in pajamas—well, Draco, at least, was in proper pajamas. Harry owned plenty of his own, but preferred a tee shirt and joggers.
Her eyes were watering. "But why—Draco, what possessed you to become an agent? We thought the aurors were using you as a mere consultant."
“Oh, she’d love a pretty boy for our third.”
“You what!” Draco’s eyes were wide and horrified, as if a dementor had suddenly descended on the room.
But he must have obtained a wider world view living with Shira and Jamie in New York. They might both be purebloods, but with Jamie as a squib and the pair of them into alternative cultures . . . well, that must have helped. And all that time away from the poison his parents believed must have helped.
"I want the right to stop you entering an arranged marriage."
The house elf bowed and then disapparated. Harry opened the envelope as Draco looked on over his shoulder.
"What?" Draco leaned forward, lightning quick, and nipped him on the shoulder.
“Password?”
"Look, if you want to be punished, you'll have to tell me exactly what you think is appropriate."
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Are we actually joking about this?”
"It's your birthday, Ferret?" Ron shook his head at Harry, as if reprimanding him for being a terrible boyfriend, and then turned back to Draco. "When?"
Ron bristled. “Which is it, Dad? Are you upset that we’re on friendly terms with him or upset that we’re ordering him around?”
->*<-
“I will.” There was still no judgment in his voice, but there was suddenly an odd sort of determination. “We’re not going to see those memories yet, though. I need to tell you about . . . about my link with Voldemort. And how it broke.”
"Yes." His father's voice was tight. "Kindly explain what happened last night."
Hermione risked a smile. “Then I won’t add to them. But Ron is right; we know what real evil is. You were never that—except under duress.”
“Yes.” Harry finally let go of his arm. “That’s what this is about.”
“Fine. We’ll do the maths later.” Harry paused. “For now, we ought to heal ourselves.”
“Look, Draco’s right,” Harry tried to make his voice sound soothing. “We can use all the help we can get. I just want to make sure you’re happy here, that’s all.”
Harry wanted to retch at that. “No! I mean, yes. He's here and I brought him, but—this isn't what it looks like.”
Hermione stifled a giggle at Ron’s horrified look.
Of course it wasn't. Draco had already known that, but better to be sure. He was still working out just how to, well, fit with Weasley and Granger.
Harry took it. “Thanks, Kreacher. We'll call you if we need anything else tonight.”
“You can’t use a spell on a baby to change its hair colour!” Jamie was clearly outraged.
“Yeah.” Draco allowed himself a smirk. “That was impressive charm work, if I do say so myself."
“Voldemort?”
“So you never passed the test?”
She chuckled. “You still love your brother. He's just—”
He had never adopted such a casual pose before—at least not in their company. Perhaps his American friends were bringing out this side of him.
“Would it bother you if I did?”
Harry laughed and nestled closer to him as Heathrow came into view.
“I was possibly kvetching,” Draco explained, as if he were making a concession, “but definitely not whinging.”
He elbowed Draco as they moved up again. "You hardly know him."
There was a long moment of silence. Then, without getting up, Draco reached out, took Harry by the waist and tugged him in, until Harry was standing between his legs.
“True.” Ron climbed into bed. “But our ferret had a shit upbringing, you know?”
But Draco took the words as an order. "Yes. Kreacher and Toffee are preparing a Mediterranean feast tonight; I know that much. I'll take a peek in the kitchen."
Harry nodded.
Harry sighed yet again, wondering what his former nemesis had in mind. "Go on, Malfoy. Do your worst."
"You kashered the house?" Shira stared at Draco, her eyes wide in mock horror.
Draco snorted. “Yes, and you were so very happy with your aunt and uncle.”
Draco was still trying to fix his own hair, but Ron decided not to allow that. So he tackled Draco from behind, pulling him back down onto the bed and mussing his hair at the same time.
"What? No, it's not that!" Fuck. He managed to offend people even when he didn't mean to. Well, actions would speak louder than words in this case, so he reached for her hand.
Harry nodded and told himself that everything was going well. Apart from ferret-Draco biting him, the night had gone better than he expected. He would still have to deal with the Daily Prophet and whatever its idiot article had to say about the life debt, but that was tomorrow’s problem.
And Draco must have all of a ferret's survival instincts. Bill could smell the fear on him, and he was fairly certain that he, himself, was the cause of it.
But Harry and Granger both looked upset, and Harry shook his head. “Stay,” he ordered. Then he turned back to Hagrid. “Draco’s here with us, Hagrid. Shouldn’t we all come inside?”
“Do you think you should?”
“I might.” Shira glared at Draco.
“I know. Can they can delay their flight for a week?"
"Really, Harry? You can't think of anything?"
“No, but Hermione thinks you’ve got a good eye for detail. And you do have a decent brain.” Ron kept his hand on Malfoy’s arm as he guided them both into the courtyard. “Ever thought about becoming an analyst? Someone’s got to sift through all the evidence and intelligence we collect.”
“She’s . . . I don’t know if friend is the right word. And you know how limited she is. How she’s, ah—”
"Yeah." Harry nodded with more confidence than he felt. "They're going to be my parents-in-law. I want to have a civil relationship with them."
“Yes, yes. I suppose that means you don’t care about it? Good. I think it’s salvageable, though. I’d as soon paint it if you don’t think that’s a crime . . . .”
"I thought so."
That wasn’t because Potter had beaten the Dark Lord. No, his father had been terrified of Voldemort by the end and certain that he would never regain that monster’s favour. He probably secretly wished, and maybe even prayed, for his defeat.
“Really?”
Draco wondered why he hadn't gone to a cinema whilst he was in New York; the Baumgartens, in general, weren't afraid of muggle outings.
"Presumably because I've been living in your pocket."
“Ronald! It’s harmless. He’s gay. And I would never—”
That earned him a smile. “I’ve sorted each outfit. Don’t mix and match them!”
“Never mind.” His dad looked at them both in turn and then sighed. Then he nodded toward an armchair in the corner of the room. “May I?”
He nodded. “Yes. So?”
Draco had cocooned himself in all the blankets. Of course he had. So Harry took a pillow and smacked him with it.
“Do you really need to be reminded?”
Harry wanted to groan at having his own words tossed back at him. They we're both getting good at that, actually.
“Perhaps. I’d have had to offer you my services at some point, however, for saving me from the fiendfyre. And that Death Eater just afterward. So I suppose you’d have had your chance to forbid the arranged marriage after all.”
“That’s true.” Draco knew his tone was reluctant. “But I don’t want to change the terms again. Do you?”
"Yes, I remember. You're making it painfully obvious."
Neither complaint made sense to Ron. The ferret wasn't a slave; he could walk away from this anytime. And life debts weren't just a pure-blood thing, even if pure-bloods had created specific ways to repay them. Granted, lifelong servitude did seem a bit extreme—but Harry and Malfoy's entire history together was extreme.
“You’re going to be tiresome about it too, aren’t you?" Shira winked at him. "I think you and Jamie are going to get along really well.”
Malfoy finally coughed out a response. Not that Harry could understand him; his face was wedged into the crook of Harry’s shoulder.
Harry felt his whole body relax a bit. He even smiled again.
This time the elf did apparate. Harry shook his head, and then climbed up to the suite of rooms they’d set aside for Ron and Hermione. He rushed through their sitting room, but came to an abrupt stop at their bedroom door. He couldn’t just barge in, so he knocked.
“Yeah.”
“Yeah, I know. Their public schools really are for the public.”
“That’s settled then.” Narcissa did her utmost to disguise her relief. “Now, some tea or coffee before you leave? Of course you’re welcome to stay the night in Draco’s room if you’d rather not apparate just now.”
He knew it wouldn’t be like a pensieve, and yet the initial sensation was the same: he was falling. But the similarity ended there. He wasn’t tumbling into a specific memory. It was more like plummeting through a whirlwind: colours, sounds, scents, and emotions spun around him.
Draco was suddenly smiling again, without the sneer. "Could do, yeah. Anything else?"
“But?”
Robards had wanted privacy for most of the argument, so he consigned Draco to the small waiting room outside his office. (Yes, the bastard was important enough to warrant a waiting room, as if his office were a surgery. But at least it was shielded, somewhat, from the chaotic cubicles of lower ranking aurors.)
“You want my thoughts on the patriarchal history of the Abrahamic religions?”
Malfoy read him perfectly—and suddenly his sneer was back in full force. "Ready for some quality time with my parents, Potter?"
“No,” Shira agreed. “But my father is rather proud of his pure-blood too—”
Draco, even though he couldn't vote in the states, favoured a Republican named McCain, who seemed to be a war hero of some sort. There was one other conservative at the table: a squarish, middle-aged woman who was backing Bush for the Republican party.
“I tortured people, Potter! I used an unforgivable curse—”
Ron didn’t push him. He walked them over to a bench instead, pulling Malfoy down next to him and finally releasing his arm again. It was safe enough here. Plenty of cover—fuck, when had he become as paranoid as old Moody? Since he became an auror, apparently.
"If Robards—or his successor—doesn't sack me." Harry shrugged. "But I'll probably still be on desk duty. I'll just bring the ferret cage with me so you won't be in the way—"
“But?” Draco prompted.
“But you’re not fine with me and Draco as a couple.”
"Pretty far." Draco passed the laptop to Granger. "You ought to make a copy of all this. It's not just that we can track these wanna-be Death Eaters. I think this information tells us exactly what they plan to do."
“Nothing.”
“That was before I saw how cute and fuzzy he is now,” George objected as he advanced toward Ron and the ferret.
Oh. Harry’s brain finally caught up.
They’d all lose track of each other as they browsed the seemingly endless stacks and shelves, and they rarely returned home without at least two bags of used books that they couldn’t possibly squeeze into Shira’s flat. They could easily have ‘gone to the movies’ on one of those trips, but somehow they never had.
"But I haven't even met them! Are you sure they'll—"
He rolled his eyes. “Believe me, I want to. I don't like having his mark on me either. I thought it would fade after his death, but apparently nothing short of amputation will remove it.”
And then they both stopped short at the sight of Harry sitting on the floor, holding a ferret, and looking like—well, like both him and the animal had survived an explosion.
Draco bit his lip. “I’m all for you climbing that ladder, actually.”
“Yeah. I’ve heard good things about them,” Bill ventured. “Mostly.”
He knew what Draco looked like when he was brooding. He knew what Draco looked like when he was terrified. He knew what Draco looked like when he was furious. He knew what Draco looked like when he was frustrated.
Damn. Draco could feel his sneer transforming into a genuine smile. But it quickly faltered.
Draco laughed. “No. She's a fierce atheist. She likes the customs, though. And she lives to deconstruct and critique all the ‘patriarchal idiocy,’ as she calls it, in the Torah.”
Hagrid let out a heaving sigh. “Harry, I can’t say no to you. You know that. But this—it doesn’t feel right. Not after everything.”
"Does he not like to sleep alone?" she asked as she stroked his head with one finger.
Harry treated him to a playful punch on the shoulder. “I was. I’m not anymore. In fact, I wish I were experienced enough to step into Robard’s shoes now. Assuming he is forced to resign.”
Harry studied him for a moment and, with a wary sigh, repositioned himself next to Ron, who was still holding the ferret.
“Sure about that? I don’t think I could have accessed that memory if you hadn’t, on some level, wanted me to.”
“No, you've always been about raw, undisciplined power. But it doesn't matter—we’ve already talked about that duel. I’m not even counting it.” Draco paused to roll down his sleeve again.
The ferret scrambled onto Harry, dove under the covers, and ended up in between Harry's chest and tee-shirt, sticking his small head out from under the collar. Harry laughed and decided that sharing the shirt with cute-furball-Draco wasn't all that terrible.
She let out an exaggerated sigh. “It means I can’t have a BLT here. A bacon-lettuce-and-tomato sandwich, I mean.”
“I have a UK license.”
When Harry woke up, Draco was out from under his tee-shirt, but still burrowed under the covers, curled up alongside Harry. He didn't seem to be awake yet—did most ferrets sleep so soundly?
“Is she?” Harry kissed him back. “Can’t think who that reminds me of.”
“Why do you care?”
“You were relieved!” Harry was shaking his head in disbelief as he spoke.
“Really can't? Or is it just that you don’t like to? I mean, is it can’t or won't?”
This was a bastardly thing to do, but at the moment Harry didn't care. “Don't try to follow me. We're not on the floo network here and the wards won't let you apparate out alone yet.”
“I think I agree with my father.” Ron shrugged. “He believes that old saying about religion making good people better and bad people worse.”
Ron nodded, feeling relieved to have a specific label. “I’m a bit surprised, but it’s fine.”
“Yes, I’m sure. Why wouldn’t I be?”
“Very,” Draco answered.
“Careful. You’re sounding as if you think you’re entitled to all my thoughts.”
“I’m sorry.” He finally did sit down then, but he didn’t stop about the Prophet. However he was speaking, now, not shouting. His rage had softened into something tired and despairing.
“Oh, he’d have done it, even if he had to work up the nerve! You know what he is. Look what he almost had done to Buckbeak!”
“Or what?”
“Wait!” Harry turned back to Hagrid. “The war’s over. The trials are over. Can’t we all just sit together for a few minutes?”
"Ouch!" Harry laughed as he reached behind to capture Draco's wrists and pull him even closer, so that he was trapped against Harry's back now. "Stop that. You'll  come with me whenever I tell you to and transform into a ferret whenever I say. A ferret with a fucking muzzle, that is."
Draco snorted. “Thanks ever so. Where does that leave me?”
“So the wedding would have been here?”
Draco glared at him again, probably just for good measure, and then turned back to the house elves. “Kreacher, you seem to know something about kashering. I rely on you to find out what needs to be done and who should do it.”
“Enough!” Harry was laughing too now, but was clearly trying to look stern at the same time. “George, you’re going to bash your head against something.”
It was Ron’s turn to sigh. “The three of us—me, Hermione and Harry, I mean—know Draco pretty well. He’s still a prick sometimes, believe me. But I don’t think he has any ulterior motives.”
But that wasn’t the point. “Tell him to un-banish it, please.”
“This is not a pensieve, Potter. Don’t expect these memories to be orderly or logical or objective.”
There was a smile in Draco's voice now. "You never were good at following the rules."
“Without my wand?”
Harry just walked back to the chesterfield and knelt down in front of him. He took Draco’s left arm and ran his fingers over the mark.
And Kreacher was standing on the other side of him, looking down at the pair with a weirdly eager sort of approval.
He grabbed his old wand—the one Harry had just returned to him—off the table near the bed and performed an adequate “Episkey.” That wasn’t a simple spell, and not part of the standard curriculum at Hogwarts, so Harry wondered where and when he had learned it.
Ron glanced around the room, noting all the doors and windows yet again. Then he relaxed a little and took a look at his companions.
“I’m perfectly capable of kvetching now, Granger. And whinging and whining—just ask my lord and master up there.” He nodded his head toward the staircase that led to the first floor.
Truth be told, Harry wasn't ready to find out yet either—especially not at Malfoy Manor.
“Don’t worry. I’m not angry about it.” Draco shoved his hands into the pockets of his trousers and stared down at the floor. “Not anymore. Not even then, I don’t think. It’s not as if I don’t know what the man is.”
“No, quite the opposite.”
"Sorry," he said, finally breathing again as both Hermione and Draco demanded an explanation. "It's just that I never thought I'd see Draco Malfoy with bed-head."
“No.”
“Yeah.”
“True.”
“You really ought to visit her again before autumn, dear.” Narcissa set her own fork aside. “Or invite her to come here for a holiday.”
That must have been a staggering revelation for Draco.
“Yeah.” Draco shrugged. “That’s one of the reasons I came so frequently; I had to get to know the rabbi and all. If Shira and I had agreed to marry, my plan was to move here after her brother’s bar mitzvah and start formal study for conversion.”
“That might break a few statutes, yes. But Aunt Bella said if such a muggle existed, she would would wager her inheritance that a wizarding expert in legilimency wouldn’t be able to penetrate his mind. Not without permission.”
"He's with you, yeah?"
“I dunno, Harry. Malfoy is using you—he wasn't even secretive about that. I witnessed him making all those demands before he agreed to pay off his debt, remember?”
Potter and Weasley exchanged glances, but neither demanded their own copy. Both seemed content for Granger to give these accounts the careful and meticulous reading they required. That settled one long-standing question for Draco: Granger had clearly kept the saviour and his sidekick from failing half their classes at Hogwarts. He wondered how many papers she had written for them.
"No."
Harry sighed and shook his head again. “I feel as if we’ve wasted three years. Or maybe not; you obviously found yourself in New York.”
Those green eyes of his danced. "A misguided prick, let's say."
Draco was standing over him with a scowl on his face. “What the hell was that, Potter?”
“How much time?” Ron knew he was being curt and possibly unreasonable—and why in Merlin’s name was he doing this for Draco Malfoy’s sake?—but he waited for an answer anyway.
He shrugged. “Not particularly. Now, what have I done to rile you up?”
To Ron’s surprise, Harry grinned again. “He's welcome to use me for that, but right now all the Malfoys want to keep our relationship out of the papers.”
Still, it couldn’t hurt to mollify his boyfriend, so he dressed himself in the outfit that Draco had laid out for him. Which turned out to be as perfect as yesterday’s: comfortable, casual and somehow just a little edgy. Harry couldn’t help but check himself out in the mirror—he looked good. And not as if Draco were turning him into a fashion plate or anything. No, he looked like himself, but a bit better.
Harry didn’t push him off, although he easily could have done. Something about Draco’s voice stopped him.
Draco groaned and sank back into the mattress. "You actually are going to be this proper and annoying, aren't you?"
That had to be an exaggeration.
"Nothing." Harry kept stroking him. "Just wondering what it's like for you. Being an animagus, I mean."
"Shacklebolt can do that while you're in America," Draco pointed out. "I've heard he's not afraid of muggle technology. Which airport is he sending you to?"
“Oh yeah. No one ever got under my skin the way you did. So why didn’t he try harder to delve into your thoughts?”
“Well, largely. I know a lot about the markets and investing and such. That’s what I was there to study, if you recall. The neo-Death Eaters wanted me for my financial know-how. And what else do I know about? I can hardly recommend a good gay club to Arthur Weasley.”
She looked a little astonished at this show of politeness, but took the seat regardless. "How's it going in there?"
“Draco—”
“Constantly worried about what other people must think of you, or how they’ll judge you if they do pick up an anything. You don’t have to live like that anymore, Draco.”
Draco seemed surprised—more like astonished, actually—but he didn’t resist. He just looked a bit dazed as Harry released him. But that was . . . that was fine.
“I know.” He closed his eyes. “I can feel some of your memories, I think.”
"Yes, sir." Draco kept his tone as respectful as possible. "We still need to, ah, iron out some details regarding the manor. We have to make certain that it's officially under Potter's protection so that the ministry can't seize it."
"But no one would care, would they?" Hermione asked. "I mean, no one will listen to Draco or lift a finger for his father."
"We read about it in that muggle paper, remember? It's the one based on the Jane Austen novel."
She gave herself a mental shake and tried to refocus on the conversation in the room. It had shifted; Jamie was now describing traditional Peruvian food. Which, since it featured plenty of meat and a variety of potatoes, chili, and quinoa, Ron was keen to sample.
“But Aunt Sarah is? Did she drag you three along with her? Is she especially devout or something?”
"Either get off or call Shira and let her know you're off the market."
“Right,” Potter admitted. “And I didn't even smell the petrol at first. Not that the petrol—I mean, I think there was an actual bomb too. Look, Malfoy can tell us more about the whole operation.”
Probably.
"Please tell me what's going on." Draco's stomach was twisting itself into knots.
“George!” Hermione gave him a reproving glare before crossing the room to stand at Ron's side. Harry let her pass.
And, anyway, if it was a fight, he had clearly won: Draco would let him teach him those two spells. Not that he expected Draco to be an easy student, but Harry was still counting this as a victory.
->*<-
“I was in all three, actually. New York the longest. That's where I trained to become an animagus.”
Draco and Harry both sat up. There was, Harry noticed, a deliciously outraged expression on Draco's face.
Draco looked satisfied. "Good. Now about my property. Anything I own personally is yours, if you want it. But family property that I stand to inherit or already own is different."
For some reason Ron found that hilarious. He started laughing so hard he was almost choking.
"He's promised to keep his hands off both—sort of."
“I tried it on you during our infamous duel in the boys’ toilet.”
"This is about the Fiendfyre." Ron was speaking soft and low now. "Hermione and I—we wouldn't have gone back for you and Goyle. We . . . we would have left you to die, honestly."
"Stockholm syndrome. Well, a variation. We didn't kidnap Draco."
"I know.” Thank Merlin, or God, or whoever, that Ron and Bill had already forgiven Draco. “But your father—is he willing to give Draco a chance?"
Toffee seemed excited by the prospect. “Yes!”
Harry tried to imagine Draco’s introduction to a muggle-friendly way of life and really, really wished he’d been there. “Bit of a learning curve?”
"And that's the way you want it?"
Draco’s eyes, Hermione noticed, were set resolutely on the screen. He was keen to keep the conversation focused on the flash drive.
Ron hesitated. “The thing is, Dad, Harry’s not going to go where Draco isn’t welcome. Even if that’s the Burrow.”
Harry grabbed his wrist—his left wrist. “You didn't identify me to those Death Eaters when you could have. You saved my life at that moment. And when I took your wand—and all the wands in your hand—honestly, you hardly put up a fight.”
There was a slight hesitation before Draco answered. “You’re comfortable with them? They’re not like the Weasleys . . . .”
“We’ll see, Potter.”
He even loved the journey there. He and Shira—and sometimes Shira’s girlfriend, Jamie—would squash aboard the PATH train in Hoboken, surrounded by muggles of all descriptions, on the World Trade Center line. It had always seemed exciting, especially as his parents had never let him loose in London. They had guarded him carefully there. Even at King’s Cross they would hustle him as fast as possible through the barrier at platform nine and three-quarters.
“I can't—look, Potter, what do you expect me to do?”
Potter really was doing his utmost to get himself sacked. He and Robards had been at it for more than half an hour now. Draco had only witnessed the first ten minutes of their shouting match, but he needed no great skill in divination to see just where it was headed.
Harry just grinned. "You never answered my question, you know. How'd you like this?"
"I want a chance to see where this leads us, Draco." His green eyes were fond and determined and exasperated all at once.
“I was isolated! And you helped that along. Remember the badges?”
Harry was still pale. “Look, Draco, I—”
“Don’t you dare make fun of me when I tell you why,” Harry warned. “Or tell me what an inflated ego I have.”
“Because I pulled your arse out of the fire—literally!—twice now. I didn't do that so the ministry could just throw your life away.”
That was an understatement, probably. Ron was pretty sure now that Draco considered him second-in-command to Harry—although Hermione could probably claim that spot if she tried, knocking Ron into third. Hell, Draco might even obey Hermione over Harry, if the circumstances were right.
"Yes. Turns out he can't sack me for rescuing an agent. Six months of desk duty, though."
“I know you’re fine with me being bisexual.”
They stayed like that for a while, spent and close and satiated. When Potter finally rolled off of him, Draco tugged him over so that his head was in the crook of Draco's shoulder.
“Good. Draco, I think you and Harry might work, though I don't think either of you should allow this inequality between you. But apart from that—perhaps you two coming together will help . . . I don’t know. Help heal the past, if that makes sense? Show that the past can be overcome?"
"Out with it, Potter. Still worried about Robards?"
Bill obliged, but snorted at the same time. “Poor Malfoy, is it? He had something to do with the fact that I smell of wolf, remember? And you said you had a few choice hexes in mind for him if he didn’t grovel properly—”
Draco shrugged. "Famous nineteenth century author. Never read her works, but at least this film is based on a classic."
"I didn't say it was." Harry put his hand on Draco's back again, urging him forward as the queue kept moving. "But I don't need your money. And, come on, think how much I'd offend Kreacher if he thought I was stealing from the handsome, perfect Malfoy heir. I have to live with him, remember."
Potter had, somewhat inexplicably, helped the Malfoys after the war. There was no reason he should help them again, but . . . well, Potter had come charging to the rescue, hadn't he? Perhaps he'd offer even more assistance. Draco would be a fool not to find out.
"Fine, Draco. You can share the comfy bed with me. But at least let me get changed first."
It was a surprisingly respectable scent. Different from Harry’s, of course, but complimentary.
"What's the matter, Draco?"
“Master has brought Mr. Draco Malfoy home!” The house elf’s voice was tinged with awe. “The handsome pure-blood great-nephew of my late mistress.”
Draco settled on an obvious response. “It would be unofficial. You know that, don’t you? Not even muggles recognise gay marriage.”
Draco took a deep breath. “Harry, I was already tentatively attached to the neo-Death Eaters by the time I went to New York. As far as my parents knew, I was there to get to know Shira. I, er, led others to believe that I wanted to get away after the war.”
Kind of him not to point out that his father and aunt were amongst those Death Eaters.
Draco, meanwhile, was making chittering and chuffing noises that perfectly conveyed his pride in those badges.
“Which is?”
And at that moment, it struck him. All this time, Harry had been telling himself that the life-debt was something optional between them. Something superfluous to their relationship that they could let go if Draco outgrew it.
"How did you become so comfortable as a ferret? When Moody transfigured you—sorry, I mean Crouch Jr.—shit, I never saw you so frightened and humiliated."
“You don’t understand how badly I fucked up!” That came out as a harsh whisper.
Potter stood up as well. "That won't be necessary. Draco and I can apparate back to my place."
There was a muggle painting in the room too, quietly dominating the opposite wall. It was a charming picture of two camels, of all things. Harry forced himself off the bed for a closer look.
“Any more stunning revelations?”
"You can usually open a muggle account with a broker at eighteen, Weasley."
"That's not true—"
“Bastard.” Harry elbowed him. “How long have you been awake?”
“Oh, right.” Harry managed a half-hearted attempt, though. Well, he managed to lift one arm enough to give Malfoy a pathetic little push. That didn’t work at all, so he just rested his other arm on Malfoy’s back.
"The ferret could do that much himself," Ron pointed out.
"I'll tell him you're home. But he'd better not take that out on me."
Did his father have any contacts left at the Ministry? The man was no longer an influencer, but perhaps he'd heard something . . . .
"Master Draco is a most noble wizard!" Kreacher's elderly voice quivered in admiration, causing Harry's stomach to turn.
Besides, someone ought to be around for Draco’s—fuck. "Draco, I'm going to miss your birthday."
“What?”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea,” Harry said with equal sincerity. “We’ll find a way to make it so.”
No, the Weasleys must not have done; Ron didn’t know about the rococo style. (Or if he did, he’d never explained it to Harry.) So maybe it was just the posh pure-blood parents.
But in this new and radically different world—one his parents had done nothing to prepare him for—his father would no doubt expect him to eavesdrop. If Draco cared to, he could glean all sorts of tidbits about Ministry personnel and events.
"Thanks for that." Draco's eyes softened. "But ferrets are also hunters—you know, ratters and such. And we can break bones with our bites."
“Yeah.” Harry sighed. “He would just come at me with legilimency—he didn’t explain things first. He kept telling me to clear my mind, assuming I knew how to do that—”
"Oh, there's plenty of muggle art here."
Harry had memorised all those expressions back in school. Now he had many more to add: he knew what Draco looked like when he put on an act, pretending not to care about his fate. Harry had seen that particular expression in Azkaban: he remembered the nonchalant mask Draco had worn as he tried to convince Harry that he was coping just fine before his trial, thank you very much.
“Bisexual,” Hermione supplied.
Kreacher muttered something that suggested he would like her to find out only much later, if at all. Draco grinned in sympathy and turned the subject.
His father gave him a wan smile. “It’s early days yet, Ron. Give us time.”
“Do you want some quality time in your ferret cage?”
“I expect you to make this up to me.”
All right. Draco couldn’t help but smile at that too. “And what did Dobby have to say?”
And of course Hagrid would see no daylight between Draco exaggerating an injury that almost caused a hippogriff to be put down and Draco trying to force himself to use the killing curse on Dumbledore. Harry knew that Hagrid valued the lives of magical animals almost as much as human lives.
“For revenge against Arthur Weasley.”
"Probably not. Meanwhile—well, I think Hermione's going to want to talk with you about that flash drive too." Harry paused to chew on his lip. "Want to tell me anything more about it?"
“Yes.” Draco nodded. “That’s how you knew for certain that he had remained loyal to Dumbledore; that’s how you exonerated him. Posthumously.”
"Of course I want to hear it!"
Hermione bit her lip. "So your family deserves to lose the manor."
"After what, Potter?" Draco couldn't keep a sudden smile off his face. "Did you ransack Robards office or something?"
"We'll go to a pub to celebrate, yeah?" Ron said. "You, me, Hermione, your New York friends—that all right, 'Mione?"
"From working under cover?"
Hermione found herself grinning as well. “We know what a BLT is. Ron, to kasher a house is to make it kosher.” She glanced down at Draco. “That’s right, isn’t it?”
"I'm not engaged yet, Potter."
“Hmmm,” Harry murmured, pressing his lips briefly against Draco’s bare chest.
Draco kept up the deferential look—no, better to call it what it was. His suck-up look. How many times had they seen Draco give that look to Snape? But he looked even paler now. Almost as if he were about to pass out.
Harry’s expression turned serious as he narrowed his eyes. “Really. We’re not playing here, remember? I own your arse, so you’ll do exactly as I say.”
Draco nodded, grateful for the assistance—and for the fact that Ron hadn't called him to task for not being able to apparate himself.
Draco raised his eyebrows in polite disbelief.
Bill couldn’t see George’s expression, but it must have been serious, judging by his tone. “He doesn’t need forgiveness from me, you know. He didn’t kill Fred, and he didn’t blast off my ear.” He pointed to the side of his head, where his ear was missing, for emphasis. “It’s Ron and Bill who have a right to a grudge, not me.”
“Why’d you send her away?” Draco looked suddenly apprehensive.
Somehow Draco found his voice. “Weasley’s right.” He looked straight at Harry. “I think just the three of you should go. Give Hagrid a chance to get used to this idea without me there, yeah?”
Well, perhaps not mock horror, Hermione thought. Her expression appeared quite genuine.
“I don't want to get your hopes up.”
He shrugged. "That's a complicated question."
“Sorry about that.”
Harry could tell, as they laid together on the floor of the sitting room—exhausted and bruised and bleeding—that Draco had changed even more since the war. He was still a snarky, bratty, snob. But he had largely shed his prejudices, and his cruelty, and that made all the difference.
"No." He looked as if he were trying for a smile—and failing spectacularly. "No, they only want you."
Harry chuckled—but then his expression turned serious. “It wasn’t all bad, was it?”
“I didn’t know that was an option! So I used public transportation, as all sane people do.”
Shit. What exactly was he including under services? And did Malfoy really consider this a debt to last until one of them was dead?
“Where are we?” Harry kept his own voice gentle to reassure him.
“Yeah. But it’s a trick my Aunt Bella taught me.” He paused. “When people know you have some skill in occlumency—and Voldemort knew, as did Robards—it’s best to select the thoughts and memories you’ll allow to the surface and then protect them. And you want a good mix: painful, giddy, embarrassing, shameful, content . . . you get the idea.”
“Yeah, it’s me.” He made it to the bed without further incident, sat down on it, and toed off his trainers.
“So you were never in New York, Malfoy?” Granger asked, dispensing with any niceties or any comment on his appearance. “Or Paris or Buenos Aires?”
“You still haven’t answered the question.”
“Huh?” Harry lifted his head again. “Draco, you’ll have to speak more slowly.”
Harry stared at her, not sure why she was telling him this.
The climbing stopped. "Are you saying I'm going to find him curled up in bed with Hermione?"
Draco’s lips twitched. “I’ll have you know that my Yiddish vocabulary is quite impressive.”
“No!”
Harry, meanwhile, just looked puzzled. “Why is that?”
Draco thought it unlikely that anyone would. There was an easy going vibe about Potter—and that wasn't superficial, exactly, but it wasn't the whole story either. Right underneath there was still a raw power to him. Salazar, it almost crackled at times.
“What the hell was that?” Harry demanded.
“You have no idea. I used to sneer at Arthur Weasley—well, not literally; I scarcely ever saw the man—because my father despised his fascination with muggle quackery. Then suddenly I was living with wizards who thought nothing of using muggle technology for everything. And I scarcely knew how to operate a toaster.”
“Then never mind other ideas; you both need to work on it.” Granger sounded oddly like McGonagall.
"Yeah.” Ron nodded. “Now, er, take Toffee and see to breakfast for everyone, yeah? We’ve a bit of time before you have to leave.”
"I've never given you more than a love bite."
"All right." Draco looked him up and down. "First off, this debt is just between you and me—and just for our lifetimes."
Hailing him as a deluded menace and then as a hero: that—rinse and repeat—represented Potter’s entire relationship with the press. Well, the press was not always to be controlled; it had certainly betrayed the Malfoy family.
“Draco!” Harry was rolling his eyes now. “Just tell me what she said about occlumency.”
Draco swallowed, and tried to tell her, with his eyes, to shut up.
“Um, yes.” Harry nodded, trying to seem confident and in control. “Yes, it’s an order.”
"Let's just go to a muggle place," Bill said. "Fleur is starting to like them."
“I wouldn’t dare.”
Something about the term 'enemy’ grated on him, even though that was exactly how he had regarded Draco until about a week ago. “We were all just kids.”
Harry was blushing too, actually. He could feel the tinge of heat to his face. But it wasn't embarrassment, exactly. Or if it was, it was mixed with something else.
Draco raised his eyebrows.
“So what does this mean?” Ron demanded. “Are you going to turn up at the Burrow with him in tow?”
“Hell, yeah. If everything goes well, my parents will return the invitation and allow Malfoy to come to the Burrow. And Harry never has to know that they didn’t want him there at first.”
Draco looked over his handiwork and then nodded with satisfaction. “Come on, Potter. Let’s find the other two-thirds of the Golden Trio.”
Harry laughed and then reached for Draco’s hands. “I don’t in general, but I’m right about this. You don’t have to admit it now, but I am.”
Harry couldn’t help but grin. These were obviously muggle business people, but their genial mix of chaos and productivity reminded him oddly of the aurors.
“That you were, yourself, a horcrux was always a possibility,” he said at last. “It was the only answer that adequately explained that strange connection between you and Voldemort. We all discounted it, in my family at least, because—well, to destroy said horcrux, you would have had to have died, just as Nagini had to die.”
There was another long pause. "Why are we reliving this?"
Draco sighed. "Potter has saved my life four times in total. Once from that fiendfyre, once in the Battle of Hogwarts afterward, once—"
“Stop it, Ferret,” he managed. “You look fine.”
No response to that, so Harry just climbed under the covers. "Come here."
It was just that . . . well, Draco was accustomed to starting his day early. And he was getting restless.
“All right,” Ron said. “But if you and Malfoy are really together, you're going to have to bring him to the Burrow. You’re still family, you know, so you can’t hide him from us.”
She placed a hand on his arm. Draco instinctively recoiled to spare her the grime and soot.
“Dunno.” Harry shrugged. “Haven’t found time, I suppose.”
“Tell me something, Harry.” Draco still didn’t look up. “What are you looking for? What good do you expect to come from this conversation?”
“Come back to bed,” Harry murmured into his neck.
“Oh, right.”
"Benj will be driving, not me. He really does seem decent, Draco. I think I'm going to like the whole family."
Draco shrugged, cool and nonchalant. “I pay off my life debt to him. So, you see, he does have the right to interfere in my life.”
Draco, who had been giving Harry an intense look, suddenly smiled. "Oh, I knew it was you. You were my personal stalker that year."
"I'm only half an inbred pure-blood, remember?"
->*<-
So Harry didn’t care what was stopping Draco from casting those spells, whether it was indeed a mental block or a lack of proper training or whatever. One way or another he was going to learn them—and Harry would soon make that clear to him.
"Well, you'll address me that way in public, of course."
Draco didn't answer that. Which probably meant he was concussed or something. Harry probably was too.
Harry could almost hear Draco rolling his eyes in response. “I know what one synagogue is like. And that’s not just a muggle thing. He can ask any Jew in the wizarding world about that.”
“No.” He shook his head. “Shacklebolt wants all of us—you, me, Hermione and Ron—to keep out of sight. So looks like another day, at least, of working from home.”
“I did, at least in part.”
Harry stared at her and then, despite everything, bit back a grin. Apparently Toffee liked attention and praise as much as Draco did.
Draco smirked as he made a show of glancing down at his groin. “Oh, you have no idea, Potter.”
Harry’s voice brought Draco’s mind back to the present. “How’d your chess game go?” he was asking.
“No.” He shrugged. “He hasn’t mentioned them, and I haven’t brought them up.”
“But I can’t remember a time when you didn’t have either Granger or Weasley supporting you. And mostly you had both. And sometimes you had the whole fucking school on your side.” Draco could feel a hint of affection creeping into his voice. “In any case, you were always more powerful than me.”
Arthur Weasley. Harry cringed a bit at the mention of Ron’s dad. Yeah, he must be the reason Draco was so upset.
"Shhhh." Draco wrapped his arms more tightly around him, holding him through his climax. Potter returned the favour as Draco came a moment later.
"Never mind. It suits you. And it's iconic now, along with the glasses, so there's no point putting you in lenses either." He paused to pick up Harry's hand, only to release it with a scowl. "You're in desperate need of a manicure. We should see to that today."
"How would he?"
There it was again—that look of gratitude. “Thank you.”
By the time Granger crawled into bed, Draco had squirmed his way into a comfortable position with his head resting against Ron's shoulder. Granger seemed surprised to see him.
Draco seemed to chew on each word before speaking it. “I have successfully apparated in the past. But I can't any longer.”
Granger turned three different shades of scarlet as she pulled her hand back. "So you still hate to be touched by a mudblood?"
It was still sumptuous, but not nearly so heavy. It was the sort of room that granted you a reprieve from the rest of the house.
“Consenting adults, Granger.” He paused. “But tell the truth: are you upset that he’s dating me?”
"Not friends?" Harry stared at him. "Draco, we've been getting on fine. More than fine. And we've been talking and laughing and, uh, nearly screwing—"
"Yes." He didn't quite smile back. "Just stop pushing. We're not shagging until September."
“But . . . do you think the Dalai Lama compartmentalises?”
Harry held his wand firmly, savouring the way the holly hummed to life in his hand. A zillion dirty jokes about wands leapt into his brain, but he summoned enough discipline to dismiss them all. Legilimency was a serious business; he didn’t want any harm coming to Draco as he delved into his memories.
“Never mind. The point is—”
He smiled as he kept stroking Draco's fur. "Morning."
"It's not 'if' I marry you, Draco, it's when. We're going to be married, and that will make me part of your family."
"Maybe? Dunno, Harry."
Apparently the answer was yes, because at length Draco nodded. “Very well. Come along, Toffee.”
Harry nodded, letting him have the last word as they turned and walked out of the alley together.
Granger, however, groaned in frustration. Literally.
“I didn’t mean as my romantic plus one! I meant—” he broke off again. “I don’t know what I meant.”
"No, I'm serious. But I don't have words to describe it. Human sense of smell is so poor that we've never developed the vocabulary—but it's sort of . . . almost charged. Like the air when a thunderstorm is about to strike. But somehow you smell more like protection and safety than danger—" He broke off, blushing.
Fuck. He was right, of course, but Draco had blocked those instances from his memory. And he did not appreciate having them unblocked for him.
“Yes, Ron.”
He shook himself a little. Then he pressed closer to Potter and refocused on the conversation.
But when did he start liking him?
Harry smiled at that, but only for a second. "I'm not sure I can keep your father out of Azkaban. I can expose the deal Robards forced you into. Or threaten to—"
Draco took a seat on the bed. "That's as good a word as any. And that's my piece, actually. It's a Ruvein Rubin."
“But—”
"Still tense," Draco chided. "What am I doing wrong?"
“Draco, I'm a curse-breaker,” he explained. “But I deal with plenty of magical items that are damaged as well as, or instead of, cursed. Vanishing closets are amongst the trickiest things to deal with, so I want to know exactly how you fixed that one at Hogwarts.”
“Our ferret?” Hermione let the light die out as she snuggled into Ron’s arms. “He’s not a pet, Ronald—”
“Testing boundaries again?”
“No!” Draco felt his shoulders tighten. “The debt is real and permanent, Harry. That’s what I’ve been trying to explain. There is no cancelling it.”
“It’s not Victorian; I believe it was built in 1900. But yes, ‘ramshackle’ certainly applies.”
“Quite heroic, Mr. Potter.” Skeeter's voice carried easily now; everyone else in the crowd had fallen silent. “But why would performing your duty as an auror entitle you to a life debt?”
Draco sighed. “Sorry for all this talk about someone you don’t know, Potter, but my parents are doing their utmost to arrange a marriage for me.” He stared down at his plate. “At the moment, Shira is their prime candidate.”
“No. I’ve seen some of what you guys do. We can catch you up. And you wouldn’t have to give up your, uh, special skills. Even some of the Baumgartens work regular jobs and just do that stuff on the side.”
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy. Will you be wanting a tour? Your esteemed mother—”
“Uh, not sure how Ron and Hermione would feel about that.”
"Ron's right, you know." Harry tried for a bit of sternness. "I can't believe you never went to bed."
"I don't have to love them to do the right thing by them, Draco."
Harry sat up, straining his ears, but he couldn't quite make out the words. It sounded as if Ron were issuing some sort of order and Draco was resisting it—not by scoffing or refusing to obey, but simply by pleading his case.
It was hard to think of someone who deserved to rot in Azkaban more than Lucius Malfoy. Harry had never forgotten how willing Lucius had been to see murder done in the Hall of Prophecy, and that was just the start of his wrongs. Somehow, though, Harry kept his mouth shut.
He narrowed his eyes.
“Right.”
“He’s already figured out that much.”
“Yes,” Potter answered. “Definitely a him.”
"You realise we haven't even exchanged mobile numbers?"
"Toffee answered the FRONT DOOR!" Kreacher all but pounded on the old table. “Toffee has never been trained to buttle!”
Harry blinked. “You have catacombs?”
Draco shrugged. "It's more comfortable than the guest room, so I did the polite thing and put you in here."
Draco rolled his eyes. “That is what I just said, yes.”
Harry managed a sour smile. “A sanctuary seems like a weirdly good place to do this.”
Draco sneered. “And no doubt you think that I, of all people, have no right to judge him?”
Draco turned around to face him. "You'd have done well in our house—don't pretend otherwise. Put it on."
But he couldn’t find it. He tried counting his breaths, but it wouldn’t work. Nothing worked, he kept plummeting . . . until he came crashing to a halt, landing on some kind of flooring that was hard and unforgiving.
“I’m not procrastin—fuck.” Harry let go of him and pushed up to his feet. Then he crossed his arms over his chest, enjoying, however briefly, the sensation of looking down at Draco, who was still seated on the bed.
Draco shrugged. "That's part of it, yes."
Draco didn’t pull his hands away from Harry, but he didn’t quite return their grip either. “Call it a force of habit. Or a security blanket, perhaps. I like knowing that certain memories are locked up tight.”
Harry felt himself blush. After all their history, it seemed astonishing that Draco saw him that way. And almost equally amazing that he didn't see his father in that light. He had always worshipped the man.
"Yeah. I mean it's mostly my mum. She blames all the Malfoys for the whole fucking war. And they have had it out for our family. Plus Draco almost killed me with that poison. And he is responsible for Bill's scars."
Benj shrugged. “No offense, but your society isn’t the only one in existence. It’s a real small one, in fact. There’s a much bigger world out there. So if you can’t find a way to help the one you fucked up in, find a way to help the one right in front of you.”
“Both.”
“But you’re not going to get a baby with his platinum blond hair, Shira,” Jamie pointed out. “Not with your dark hair.”
"Yes. You have my services till death do us part and all that. But I don't owe your heirs anything, and mine won't owe you or your heirs anything."
“Not necessarily.” Harry’s brain was stampeding ahead. “Your father was out of favour, Draco. And you weren’t there every second that monster was in your home.”
Draco smiled up at him. “‘Fraid not. No shellfish either, or filet mignon, and no mixing meat and dairy.”
Draco, as it turned out, hated having his nails trimmed—at least in ferret form. A proper salon for humans was an entirely different experience. There would be no ugly chesterfield in a salon, no Weasley to hold him down on it, and no Potter to show just how inept a saviour could be with a pair of clippers.
"The rest?" His father actually looked alarmed.
That didn’t stop Harry. He still managed to grab hold of Draco and force him down on the bed, until the ferret was trapped lying sideways.
“Yeah. But I told him that he could forget about the life debt. That I'd still help him and his family. He didn't want to forget it.”
Draco made a non-committal response.
Draco’s smile faltered. “What’s wrong, Harry?”
“A thick one, sometimes. If you had come to me after the trials, and told me that Robards was blackmailing you, I’d have protected all of you back then. And the manor. Your life would never have been at risk.”
Granger gasped. Draco just stood there stupidly—but he should have known. Of course Hagrid blamed him for the near-destruction of his hut. It might be a wretched hovel, but it was his. And there was no one else to blame; Rowle had done the deed, but Draco had smuggled him into Hogwarts.
Hermione lifted her hand to reveal that, for all his protests, Draco was grinning. He took hold of Hermione’s hand and, with a mischievous glance at Ron, kissed it tenderly. For which Ron tackled him again, initiating a playful, ad hoc wrestling match. Fortunately Hermione was too amused to bother stopping it.
“Master and Master Draco should know that Mrs. Weasley nee Granger has sent an urgent owl.” He held out a sealed envelope.
But Harry didn’t say any of that out loud. Instead, he simply nodded as he climbed to his feet. Then he allowed Draco to lead him out of the sanctuary.
“No, that won’t be necessary.” Harry stood up. “Thank you for, uh, receiving me so late. We’ll speak again soon.”
"Why'd you stop, Potter?"
“I told you that I love you, you dolt.”
“I won’t go if you don’t want me to.”
“And that’s not all,” Draco continued. “Bill and George have both stopped in. And so has Goyle.”
Fuck. Ron hadn’t had a chance to talk to Malfoy about that yet. “Oh, I meant to tell you when we woke up. He’s taking you to pick up Shira and Jamie. Er, just you.”
"Of course, but I have those."
Hermione giggled, but Draco's eyes shot instantly toward the mirror as he began frantically combing his hair with his fingers. That left Ron snorting and shaking his head at the same time.
“You still want me to quit?”
Kreacher all but snarled. “If Master would—”
"Don't be. I'm just amazed that you don't prefer ‘Master’ for yourself."
“Yeah.” He paused to shake his head. “Most bullies sensibly go after people they perceive as weaker. People who are isolated. But I went after you.”
Draco’s eyebrows shot up from across the table. Harry felt a twinge of guilt; he doubted Draco wanted his father to know just how much he had revealed about his family. But there was no way Harry could resist goading Lucius. Not after everything the man had done.
Draco smacked his arm again. "Bastard." Then he pushed himself up. "Enough talk. I've won our bet, remember? Time to pay up."
"Legitimate investments?" Ron looked both shocked and put out. "Merlin, Malfoy, when have you had time? You're only twenty, same as us."
Next thing Harry knew, Draco was buttoning up his shirt for him, starting at the bottom.
Now Harry was giving him a judicious look.
“—that I would grow tired of you and you’d marry Shira after all?”
“You are not sending half my clothes to Oxfam.”
"Perhaps, but there's no point. Not when I got everything else I wanted." He paused to straighten up and turn toward Malfoy. "You're no longer an agent. Robards will debrief you officially tomorrow and thank you for your service."
Soon Harry was sitting at the dining room table, connecting to Shira. Draco didn’t bother to warn Harry what to expect—he’d find out soon enough. The restrained goth style of that one photograph simply did not do her justice.
"Best put a ferret cage in there too," Harry muttered.
“They are.” Harry paused. “Er, how is Goyle?”
“It won’t—not until I convince Ron and Granger to take me as their third.” There was a savage satisfaction in his tone as Draco presumably imagined Arthur's reaction to such a, er, unlikely relationship.
“Soon, probably. So better pretend not to despise a poor wizarding family with more children than they can afford.”
"You have to win this bet first," Draco reminded him.
After a moment more of sniffing, Draco obliged him. He tumbled away from both of them, still in ferret-form, and emerged as a human sitting cross-legged at the bottom of the bed. A human in quite posh pajamas, if he did say so himself.
Draco actually chuckled at that. “He didn’t know how obsessed I was with you. The thoughts he saw were about my fear of him—which he enjoyed—or about me trying to live up to my father, or about my impure thoughts for other boys my age. Ah, excluding you, of course. I kept those fantasies locked up tight many layers deeper.”
“Why not? It’s been a few years since Malfoy and I have seen each other—you should introduce me properly to your pet.”
But it didn’t matter; apart from genuinely wanting Weasley’s advice—Circe help him—Draco wanted to remain on his good side. He was Harry’s best friend, he was married to Harry’s other best friend, and he presumably controlled access to the rest of the Weasley clan, which was the closest thing Harry had to a family. If Draco wanted his relationship with Harry to last, it was imperative that the Weasleys . . . well, if not accept him, at least not make Harry’s life miserable because of him.
Harry cringed. “Right. Okay, I’m getting up.” He suited his actions to his words as he climbed out of bed and strode toward his wardrobe; might as well pick out his clothes before he treated himself to a shower. But he froze after just two steps—his wardrobe had vanished. The entire piece of furniture was missing.
Draco, who was keeping his distance from the owl, gave him a pointed look. "Shira and Jamie are arriving Sunday morning."
“Draco . . .” Hermione let her voice trail off as she contemplated the best way to address the elephant in the room. “I’m not trying to interfere in your business. Or Harry’s. But I need you to answer one question.”
Even if Harry hadn't known Draco was gay, he would not have taken Shira for his girlfriend. The photo somehow screamed platonic friendship.
"Don't be like this." Harry’s blood started pumping hard—he could feel it rushing to his face. “Don’t you dare turn cold on me.”
“Ron and I will handle that.” Harry leaned over and brushed his lips against Draco's. “Not everyone holds what happened in the war against you. McGonagall doesn’t. You said everything went well with her—that it was a good talk.”
The whole room was perfect. Most of Malfoy Manor had a sumptuous but somber feel to it, and Harry almost fancied that he could hear echoes of Voldemort's tread. But this room—with its soothing, sage-coloured walls—was different.
Harry grinned. “I do. You’re adorable.”
“No I wasn't.” Harry couldn't help the wide grin on his face. Kreacher might secretly be writing sonnets in honour of Draco's eyebrows, but at least he still obeyed Harry over him. “It's exactly what we needed, Kreacher. Look, Draco, it has hammocks and tubes and toys—”
“Harry, you can't let people think you're dating a Death Eater!”
“Then maybe we shouldn’t discuss Dobby.” He should have risked looking up then, but he didn’t. “I’m sorry for your loss. I am. But I didn’t know him as well as you did. And my few interactions with him won’t show me in a positive light.”
He scoffed. “There won’t be an exam, so don't worry. No need to prove you’re better than me this time.”
Draco grinned. "Not really. A bit niche, I suppose. Shira's uncle introduced me to his work. I meant this one for an investment, but now I'm too attached to sell it."
“It's not sensitive now, Draco. Your cover is blown. You won't be any further use as an agent.”
“My muggle family?” Harry laughed as he shook his head. “My Uncle Vernon never showed me off at his work; he liked to pretend I didn't exist.”
Granger coughed just then, as if to remind her husband of something else.
"What?" Draco lowered his voice, even though the room had largely emptied out. "That I was an idiotic prick to look down my nose at muggles all those years?"
The ensuing pillow fight was probably more competitive than it needed to be, but it ended with both boys collapsed on the bed, laughing. It was the first time Harry could remember fighting Draco with no wands and no fists involved, and somehow that seemed to settle certain long-held grudges. For both of them, he hoped.
"Fuck." There was a hint of awe in Draco's voice. "You see? You’d have done well as a Slytherin."
Harry was tempted to order him to tell him now, but Draco was already half asleep. So he closed his eyes as well, and allowed himself to drift off . . . only to wake up an hour later, shivering.
“No. I would have known.”
“I . . . are we speaking confidentially right now?”
Harry, meanwhile, was pointing at the pew that had caught his attention. “You’ve sat there, squashed between Benjamin and . . . and a woman I don’t recognise. Mrs. Baumgarten?”
“So, I suppose we should start.” Draco sat down on the bed, cross-legged, and waited. He wasn’t keen to have Harry rifling through his memories of Dobby, but it was preferable to putting them into words.
"Trust him?"
“But maybe he's shagging you just to make himself look good. You know, maybe it will help his public image to be dating the chosen one.”
“Quite,” Draco answered. “I don’t know how many frum wizarding families there are in Britain—”
“Aw, that’s sweet of you to say.” Jamie favoured him with a wide smile before turning to Shira. “I like him.”
"Oh." Fuck.
“I imagine there’d be some custody issues to sort out too.” Harry still sounded as if he were trying to stifle a laugh.
“Probably not, but I’m sure the airport won’t really check their suitcases.”
"Here, try on this one." Draco was facing the wardrobe, mostly, but with one arm stretched toward Harry, offering a dark green shirt.
Draco nodded. "Very well. Shall we exercise your legilimency, then? I did promise to let you see my memories of Dobby tonight.”
Harry shrugged. “You know how to fix that. You tell Shira and your parents—” He broke off. “Your parents. They notified the Prophet, didn't they?”
“Stop sneering, Malfoy.” Harry clipped the yarmulke to his hair, still grinning. “It doesn’t always become you, you know.”
"You don't have designs on Harry, do you? Because I'm telling you—"
Draco huffed. "Yeah, well, that's not the worst of it. I didn't lift a finger when my aunt . . . . when Granger was—"
“But?”
“Yeah?”
Harry almost smiled at that; Draco could see it in his eyes. But then his face grew serious. "We can't shag—or, um, dry hump?—or anything else until this is sorted. So maybe we shouldn't wait until September."
She pointed to a chair. Harry folded his arms over his chest, intending to find fault with whatever outfit Draco had chosen. But although Harry would never have paired that shirt with that blazer—and wouldn’t have matched either to those trousers—he couldn’t object to the overall effect. They all worked rather well together, actually. And his robes would suit them perfectly . . . .
“I just want your opinion.”
Draco looked to Harry, trying not to let his eyes say ‘I-told-you-so.’ But Harry didn’t notice. He was frozen on the spot, staring after Hagrid. He’d been smiling broadly a few seconds ago, when he knocked, but now that smile faltered.
"Dunno," Ron replied through a yawn. "I invited him, though. Thought he might stay with the girls otherwise and, well, I didn't think Harry would appreciate that."
After all the noise and hustle of the Cantor Fitzgerald office—and even the noise of Draco’s memories upstairs—the synagogue seemed too quiet. Eerily so. Harry knew what it should be like: he could catch glimpses of Draco’s memories of these hallways. Children weaving in and out of classrooms in chatty gaggles whilst adults—some laughing good-naturedly, others looking harassed and put upon—either supervised or clustered together to discuss committee business.
Shit, Harry wished he'd known how insecure Draco was then. A lot of his bullying, cruelty and general brattiness must have stemmed from that. If Harry had known, maybe things could have been different between them at Hogwarts.
“Harry boycotting the Burrow isn’t going to help us!” Draco folded his arms over his chest. “Your parents will blame me for any estrangement.”
"No." Harry nudged him. "I've got this."
“Malfoy, wait—”
“Er, dangers of teaching Magical creatures. Misunderstanding between me and one of the—well, never mind that. Here to visit someone, are you? Not one of the Weasleys, I hope.”
“Ow!” Potter grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and lifted him up until his hind feet were scrabbling for purchase. “Behave, Draco.”
"And I'm not necessarily agreeing to the hyphenated—"
"I think that's enough protection. But Ron, what are you afraid of? That your father won't like Draco? Or that he won't approve of the life debt? Or that he won't approve of my relationship with him?"
Ron grunted. "Yeah, well, Harry didn't see it that way."
There was a delighted yip from George—Bill couldn’t come up with a better way to describe that sound—and then somehow Draco was squirming out of Ron's arms and into George's, whose whole face probably lit up.
“Oh. Has Harry become a tyrant already?” Weasley didn’t look particularly surprised. “Best speak with Hermione about that, mate.”
Harry narrowed his eyes at him. “Take that back,” he advised.
Draco took a deep breath. It sounded deep enough to fill both his lungs and then some. “Just that this is how I am. If you’re expecting me to change into some saint—”
“They helped! But they couldn’t follow you into the Room of Requirement.”
Bill bit back a smile at that as George took a step closer to Harry.
"We need to talk, Ferret."
Narcissa took a seat next to Potter and tentatively placed a hand on his arm. “Harry, when Lucius and I contacted the Prophet, we had thought it better to beg your forgiveness than ask your permission. We didn’t think you’d understand our reasoning.”
Draco didn’t fall back to sleep. Not that it wasn’t comfortable, spooned up against Harry, who kept kissing his hair as he wrapped as much of his body around Draco as was humanly possible. And not that it wasn’t a fucking miracle that Harry Potter wanted anything to do with him, much less wanted him in his bed.
Harry looked him over. Really looked him over. There was something about how intense his eyes were as he kept examining Harry’s hand, as if he was peering at a precious gem that didn’t belong to him. A gem that he would soon have to return.
That elicited another sigh from Draco—an exaggerated, long-suffering one. "Kreacher will take my side on this. He understands this sort of thing. He'll think I'm more perfect and noble than ever."
Malfoy didn’t relax, but he did manage a grim half-smile. “Thanks.”
Maybe it wasn't so astonishing, though. Draco was twenty now, not a spoiled prick of a fourth year. And he had survived both Voldemort and the war. Of course he'd grown up.
Harry was obviously fuming, but he seemed well aware of their surroundings. Ron’s eyes swept the street as well. They were coming up to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, which always seemed a world away from the Auror Department.
Ron knew exactly how to translate that. Mum hadn’t wanted anything to do with Draco, but Dad had insisted on at least talking with him. “And then what? Will he be welcome to come to dinner on Sundays with Harry?”
Snape . . . Snape had been a Death Eater. A sincere one, before Voldemort murdered Harry's mother. He had taken the mark. He had—Harry didn’t even know the extent of his crimes in those early days. He knew that Snape had recited the prophecy about Harry to Voldemort, making Harry and his parents targets. Harry didn’t know what else Snape might have done, but it could have been anything, up to and including murder.
“But you won’t reciprocate?”
“I want more than just your service and your company!” Harry tried to bite back his frustration. “We’re more than that, Draco.”
Harry knew he was at fault for prying, but he couldn’t stop a bit of anger from boiling up. “You were plotting to assassinate Dumbledore. To let those Death Eaters into Hogwarts. That was my fucking business!”
No, Malfoy didn't belong under cover. He ought to be brewing potions or repairing magical antiques or something. He was good at things like that: things that required lots of time and effort and patience.
Toffee, meanwhile, was staring up at him, tears still welling up in her eyes and a thoroughly confused look on her face.
“Harry,” he was saying as he lowered the kettle closer to the flames of the fireplace, “you’re better off without that little Malfoy git hanging about. Still his father’s son, I reckon. If he’s pretending to be your servant, it’s because he thinks there’s something in it for him.”
Bill stared at him for a moment and then let out a mirthless laugh. “No. I'm not obsessed with his memory. He didn't turn me, remember. Just gave me some wolfish traits. And I don't blame you for what happened—not entirely.”
“As your boyfriend? Not as though I have a choice.”
"Night." He scratched Draco behind the ears, closed his eyes, and drifted off to a sound sleep.
“You’re not jealous?” Now he sounded outraged. Or mock-outraged, at least. "Why aren’t you jealous?”
So he had found out already, and of course he didn’t understand why it was necessary. The boy hadn’t a shred of political sense.
Harry opened his mouth and then abruptly shut it again.
George knit his brows together. “What’s that about? And who are these two blokes Draco wants you to stay with?”
“Pardon?”
Draco didn’t quite meet his eyes. “Why not? It is new. But I’ll see to it, sir, that Harry doesn’t avoid the Burrow whilst he and I sort ourselves.”
Harry hesitated. “How do I know if it’s my calling? How do I know I shouldn’t be doing something else?”
“You wouldn’t.” He knew Draco wasn’t serious, but Harry could suddenly taste bile in his throat. “Is he even gay? Or bi?"
“He couldn’t wait!”
A small, detestable part of Draco—the part of him that still felt like an insecure, jealous fifth year—understood that and even sympathised. But for the most part he was simply grateful to Harry.
“Where is he?” Lucius demanded. He was standing right behind her, and she could hear both the irritation and apprehension in his voice.
“Mostly I think about ways to reform the aurors. I didn’t understand how things worked when I joined. I didn’t know that we use some, er, underhanded methods to make our arrests and keep order.”
Harry shook his head, dismissing that question, and focused on the hallway. The classroom doors were all closed. There were no knobs, Harry noticed, even though they were built for them. Apparently Draco had removed them in his head. Harry tried pushing and tugging at one of the doors, but it wouldn’t budge.
The clock kept ticking. It must have disturbed Draco, because he finally piped up again. “I’m planning to thank you for rescuing me. Even if you were stupid enough to risk your career for it.”
No, this wasn't an act. The satisfaction Draco took in subservience might not be healthy—Hermione found it difficult to remain open-minded on that point—but it certainly seemed genuine.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I agreed to allow you to teach me. It’s not my fault you’ve been procrastinating.”
“I’m glad. Maybe that’s why your room feels so different from the rest of the manor. Much less, um—”
At first, that’s what Harry assumed Draco had done; there was no Malfoy-shaped lump in the bed. But as his eyes adjusted further, he realised there was a ferret-shaped lump on one of the pillows.
"Change my surname to Potter, in the event of our marriage."
“Wait. What do you mean you're not going back there?”
“Yes, once. He had a right to be angry, mind, but not to make me bleed.” He shook his head ruefully. “I'm going to have to keep his ferret form muzzled around anyone else he might be upset with.”
“Stay at mine.” Harry ignored the fact that Draco’s fingers were now digging into his arms. “A week will give us enough time to make the upstairs suitable; you can have your own suite of rooms.”
"What? What's wrong?"
He felt himself inhale sharply. “Does that mean you think I owe him this? If he asks what a particular nightmare is about, I’m obliged to tell him?”
Harry felt himself blanch. “Dark arts?”
He shrugged. "If you broke things off with Shira, we wouldn't be having this discussion."
“How considerate of you.”
But then more of the memory struck him—or, rather, an emotion embedded in the memory: relief. Beyond the shame and the anger and the terror, beyond the pain and the shock, what Draco had felt more than anything was relief.
Draco hesitated. “Tell me about your meeting with Shira and Jamie first—they arrived safely, by the way. Did Shira talk your ear off about potions?”
“I’m not entirely without influence over him, Ron.”
On second thought, no. Lucius Malfoy was too cold to be that sensitive.
Harry knew Draco.
Harry laughed. “Yeah. And he always knew what buttons to press. Still does—you should hear him go on about Hagrid. He still doesn't think he should be teaching.”
