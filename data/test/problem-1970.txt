“I’m sending you a picture of another man. Found out who’s he working for, that’ll definitely lead somewhere” with that he cut the phone. Draco walked beside him. He saw how Harry was holding the side of his stomach, “you’re hurt”, he said reaching for the wound. “it’s nothing just a little cut”.
When Hermione came to through the floo with Ron, they both eloped Harry into a tight hug, “we’re really sorry for you mate” said Ron, “we’ll try to help you as best as we can” finished Hermione.
Once he apparated to London he took off his cloak and called Malfoy. “where are you right now?” he had no time to explain, first he needed to make sure Draco was safe. It won’t be long before Jace finds out that Harry lead him to a dead end.
When he reached the ministry he made his way where his team was. He knew this was risky and if he was wrong he could lose his entire career along with his team. “we found something” said Billie.
“what? No, are you crazy? Is this some kind of a joke” he said getting a little irritated, because why would Ron Weasley invite them to their compartment willingly? The door opened again.
After they came down from their another laughing fit, Harry looked at him with so much adoration in his eyes, Draco looked back at him with the same intensity. Harry looked at Draco almost like breathing him in, his hair glowed golden in the yellow dim light of the restaurant, how he missed those beautiful stormy eyes. Draco licked his lips and Harry’s eyes followed the movement, then Draco moved his eyes down with the cutest blush Harry has ever seen.
Draco looked at him with a raised eyebrow and said, “sure, and I never went to Hogwarts”. Harry’s cheeks were a little red but that was from all the running, yup definitely because of the running,
“uhh yeah, I was wondering maybe you would like to have dinner with me?”, he caressed his nape, nervousness vibrating through his body.
Billie pushed him out of the way and begin casting healing charms to help him. Harry ran towards the room, eyes filled with anger and pointed his wand at Alice, “tell me what is happening to Kingsley or swear to merlin I will forget every empathy I ever held for you”
“whoever might be controlling Kinglsley would need the blood of the Malfoy heir, squib or not, to get to the third stage. Complete change of mindset, Ideologies. One day he supports equality for all creatures, the next he could order genocide for every werewolf. Keep him where he is. Don’t tell us or anyone about it” she finished.
Harry Apparated to the nearest location from the bookstore, he arrived there 2 hours early before he had to meet with his friends so that he can have some alone time with the blonde.
. At least it was not going how it went with Cho Chang, he still has some space left to fall deeper in the pit of embarrassment.
Harry made his way to room where Malfoy was sleeping and quietly kept the tray of food beside the bed. For minute he just beside Draco watching him. He looked much younger sleeping. If he wasn’t already in love with him, he definitely is now.
“yeah, I thought I’d do the wizarding world a favor by giving their golden boy a couple of extra years to live,” he said as he watched Harry turn even redder if that was possible.
so this is officially the end of the story. but Don't worry there is still one more epilogue chapter and with SMUT. Finally ikr!
“I’m here now, with you. I’m more than fine Harry” said Draco and kissed Harry’s scar on his head. Harry laid them down on the bed and turned to his side to look at Draco. After few moments of just looking at each other, Draco asked, “why are there people after me though?”.
Draco started walking toward the restaurant when he felt a hand on his wrists, “look, it’s not like that, I can assure you. I know we have a history together, but I want us to have a new start. All I’m asking for is one gathering with you, you can decide the place if that makes you feel safer”, he looked straight into his eyes.
That night he again dreamt of Malfoy’s death, he woke up gasping for air, with his hand on his chest. For a minute he thought if Malfoy has somehow managed to curse him into dreaming about him, but that seemed far fetched when no one has seen or heard Malfoy since the war. He rubbed his hands over his eyes to wipe out the tears and the images. He had to find why this was happening and stop it, he can’t take it anymore. He thought about the records of wizards working in muggle world and maybe Malfoy took a muggle job, he needed to know.
He abruptly looked up from where his eyes were on Draco’s legs, “yes, hey Draco, you uhh you look really beautiful”
He ran up the stairs. Draco’s wand shot up to him with a wide expression. There was clear fear in his eyes. “Draco” said Harry as calmly as possible. Draco eyes shot up when he heard Harry call him by his name.
. “uhh he’s okay I guess, h-he and I aren’t together anymore, we never were”, he said the last part almost in a whisper.
Three hours later he returned to his room. it was still noon and he was already so hungry. As soon as he was about to close his eyes for a short nap someone knocked on the door. he groaned and got up.
Draco raised his hand and held Jace by the head. As soon as Draco’s hand touched Jace he started Screaming. Loud shrieks of pain were heard throughout the Chapel. It wasn’t physical pain. Harry could feel what he was doing to Jace.
“so, I guess you wanna know about everything” said Harry looking down at his hands. “seeing as my life turned upside down in one day, I think I deserve an explanation”.
“He’s got some very peculiar taste for a five-year-old", said Draco. Confused Harry asked, “what?”. Malfoy pointed towards the book and Harry saw what he was referring to and now it was his turn to turn the deepest shade of red.
From the corner of his eyes he could see Billie trying to hold on to her life. Mo tried crawling towards him but was usless as he was bound my magic. No one was. Except Harry and we couldn’t move because of the situation he was in.
“Didn’t feel right that you weren’t eating anything,” he said casually as he shrugged his shoulders. Draco smiled so brightly that it almost hurt his cheeks.
“you bastard, get away from him!” said Harry pointing his wand towards Jace. “now, Harry drop your wand, don’t make me hurt Mo” she said again pressing her wand more forcefully. “don’t do it Harry” said Mo.
Harry didn’t realize that he had used his first name because it felt natural. If they’re going to start new, they might as well at least start calling each other by their first names.
“I do, but a certain brunette almost ate my brain asking me why the hell has Draco not eaten anything since the morning?” she asked as she leaned in on her elbows and took the
The warm air inside felt extremely pleasant mixed with the smell of books. He rubbed his hands and started walking towards one of the aisles to look for Malfoy. The interior was impressive, with rows and rows of books,
He walked towards Draco and offered him his hand. He noticed the Arabic mehndi on Draco’s hand was so dark it was almost black. The fancy red bangles he wore made his hands looked so beautiful he never wanted to let them go. He kissed the knuckles and then tangled their hands together.
“Oh”, that was all Harry could come up with. Jake turned a confused eye towards Malfoy but before he could say anything Malfoy stood up from the table, “and we should be going if we to catch a table for the brunch”, he turned towards Harry with a tight smile on his face. “see you around Potter". “yeah nice meeting you Harry” said Jake still looking like he had no idea what’s going on.
“I wouldn’t take the dark mark. The return of Voldemort drove him crazy. He used that hideous thing to control his own son” he finished. Harry wrapped his arms around the blonde tightly and soothed his hand up and down on his back.
Kingsley showed them a picture of medallion, hanging from the neck of Lucius Malfoy. Harry already didn’t like where this was going. “this is a dark artifact; it holds some curse that could be used to make someone bend to your will and it is a lot stronger than imperious curse. While the imperious curse can be broken, this cannot” said Kingsley.
Kreacher acknowledged his presence, and then turned back to the tapestry, "today's master Regulus's birthday, master would order Kreacher to make lemon cakes on every birthday" he said with a heavy voice.
“Does he know what’s happening to him?” he asked and tied up Alice beside him. “We haven’t got a chance to talk to him yet.” Said Billie. “Jamie filled us in on her” she continued pointing towards Alice.
Like he was trying to make the man fear into being loyal to him, but the man just wouldn’t break no matter how much it pained, each curse was more painful than the other.
Harry knew this wasn’t a date but merlin did he wished it was. He knew he shouldn’t ask and he’ll probably regret it but his curiosity got the better of him, “so how are things with Jake, he looked a little baffled last time”.
Draco took the chocolate and took a large bite of it. He didn’t even realize how thirsty he was until Harry handed him the water bottle. Finally, he had the strength to look around.
And moving to muggle London and getting a muggle job only seemed fitting without any magic. Here he could be himself, dress however he wants, be who he wants to be, but Merlin did he missed magic sometimes so dearly. All in all, it was a peaceful simple life.
when Draco let go, harry only got a few glimpses of where he is. But it was enough to make out the surroundings. He realised the car was slowing down coming to a stop. He couldn’t see much but he saw a few passing road signs including the one that said ledbury road, launderette
“maybe you did, you just didn’t realize it, till he got in danger. I think him and the man in your other dreams are two different people. Talk to him about it will you.” she said drinking from her cup. After that they sat in silence. After Beatrice left the ministry she came to her hometown. She was rich enough to last generations but she lived for simple pleasures.
Draco felt little butterflies in his stomach, who thought after 5 years of war he’ll be texting with Harry freaking Potter… who happens to use emoticons. He laughed to himself and texted back
Files upon files of proof how Alice and Jace or Alicia and Joel were the one who killed them and make it look like a natural cause. He couldn’t believe Alice was the one who killed Narcissa and many other. By the looks of Mo’s face, he wasn’t the only one.
She looked at him and rolled her eyes and waved her wand and suddenly the book was not so small anymore.
“it’s okay, just a stupid dare, and like you said I weigh nothing. Shouldn’t be too much trouble for you Potter” he sat uncomfortably on one of Harry’s knees.
Harry’s whole aura changed. Sure, he fooled around office and have lazy days, but when it’s work, he was nothing but professionalism. The rest of the team joined soon.
Last night when he came back to his friends after asking Malfoy for dinner, he knew he had to tell them everything.
He saw him two days ago at the burrow but he's always happy to see Ron. Ron and Hermione understood that Harry needs physical contact to reassure him he’s there, after all they all went to the PTSD together Merlin knows the Dursley’s never even touched Harry.
“Just come on you, high posh git”. Draco flinched a bit when Ron reached for his trunk and took it to the compartment. “Careful with that, it costs more than your entire family’s salary weasel.” Old habits die hard. To his amazement, Ron only laughed and proceeded to carry the trunk instead of dragging it.
Ron and Hermione married 2 years after the war and they've gone out in the muggle world a lot of times but still Ron needs Harry to be there for him to feel completely comfortable around muggles. The three of them were each other’s support system.
He almost forgot that he had a date with Jake when Potter showed up. Draco met Jake only two weeks, and today was their second date and there is definitely not a third because you don’t go on a date and babble about your school enemy throughout the lunch.
They bought some souvenirs. Harry followed him like a puppy from shop to shop, taking every bag Draco purchased. Draco was enjoying it so much that he might have bought a few extra things that he absolutely didn’t need just to make Harry work a little longer.
“illegal, but I’ll take anything at this point” he said. harry turned around and saw a broken window, “There, we can get in from there”.
“I’m in your head. We accidentally created a blood bond, I’ll explain later. I need you to wake so that I can see where you are through you” he ushered.
Cedric looked at him and nodded in appreciation, Draco smiled and nodded back. The year ahead still seemed scary. But with a certain raven-haired boy, he couldn’t help but be excited about it.
The waitress came around with their orders. Harry paid for both, he drowned his coffee in large gulps and he took Malfoy’s drink and thought
Harry went down suddenly and Draco took a sudden breath in and clenched his hand in his shirt. And then Harry rose back up along with Draco. Draco was trying his hardest to keep his breath under control. The 10 rounds were over before he could even count.
After some time the laughter died down everyone went back to doing what they were. He relaxed back into Harry who was caressing his arms and hands. He was warm and comfortable. He looked around and after a very long time, he found himself at peace.
They got judging looks from other people but they didn’t care. It was like the two kids who were robbed of their young life become teenagers again. He laughed with Ron and Hermione sure but with Draco It was different, and he knew Draco felt it with how relaxed his posture looked and how his legs would hit Harry’s now and then.
Alice looked at him like he grew a second head for a minute, “what! you sent me an emergency Patronus because you couldn’t decide what to wear!?” she said with an unbelievably irritated expression.
That turned Malfoy’s stunned face into a confused expression. He squints his eyes, “you, who dreaded going to the library during Hogwarts, just happen to waltz in here looking for books”. Quick, not smart.
He missed making fun of him, that was the only normal thing about his life. he used it as a distraction from being the perfect son, the perfect Malfoy heir. He wishes he hadn’t taken the dark. He looked down to his sleeves and saw the faded scar on his hand. It still gave him nightmares.
“of course Harry, I want to be there when that ass comes back to give him a piece of my mind for letting that happen to him” she said looking towards Kingsley “and you’re getting me the most expensive bottle of gin afterwards”
Draco never laughed that much as he did when Harry told him stories about pranking his co-workers at work whenever they don’t have any cases. Harry was surprised that he actually made the blonde snort a few times, which he found was extremely cute.
“Harry, Kingsley’s up” said Cassie. He glared at Alice, “think about it, for as far as I can see. You already lost”. He walked in the room saw Kingsley demanding to be cut loose. “Harry what is going on” he pestered.
Harry cleared his throat and Draco realized he’s been staring at Harry openly right in front of everyone. Remember how his mother said they’ve already been through worse, well guess who’s wrong!
“not willingly. Look, don’t leave the house. Don’t open the doors for anyone other than me or Beatrice. If someone else comes go to the floo and get to grimmauld palace” he said, more like ordered. “I need to get to the ministry”. He walked towards Draco and kissed him quick and then apparated away.
Draco arrived at the ball at 7 pm, and as always he looked For Potter. When his eyes met him, Harry was already looking at him with wide eyes, Draco wore a red net Sari wrapped around his lithe figure so perfectly it looked breath-taking, and Harry did stop breathing until Ron kicked him in the foot lightly. The cut-sleeve deep neck blouse displayed his collarbones.
“Should’ve asked you before all that but I never did follow the rules.” Draco threw his head back and laughed so hard.
Draco clutched his hand tightly and Harry kept his hand on Draco’s waste for safety measures, yup that’s it. No other intentions. And with a loud bang silenced by a silencio Harry apparated them both to the safe house.
“it’s off record i need it for something I can’t tell and also I need you to keep it confidential." he looked at her pleadingly and she stared back weighing the options
"but please make sure it’s not a strip club". She gasped but the corners of her mouth twisted up a bit, “ONE TIME James Potter, that happened one time", they both laughed at memory of Ron's face when he saw girls dancing half naked on table tops.
Harry gestured from Mo and Cassie to take positions on the back and front door for any sign of someone other than Jace.
“Or not if you think this was just a one-time thing” Harry pulled back his hands with a little disappointment.
The air felt chilly on his face as he walked towards the bookstore. He came in front of the bookstore and took a deep breath before entering.
Harry stopped him at one of the photos Jamie was going through, “that boy” he said. He had a mark on his neck that Harry would never forget. It was the same mark he saw on Jace’s neck. “Joel Lunox, they’re twins”, said Jamie looking back at Harry.
Harry sighed as he parked the pram outside Flourish and Blotts, scooped up Remy, and made his way through the gaggle of rubbernecked shoppers.
The boys grumbled as Harry ushered them towards the door. Once there, he turned. Draco was stroking his son’s hair tenderly.
“Hardly,” Megan Jones sniffed, finally catching up and posing dramatically behind him, with her stance wide and her hands on her hips like some sort of action figured. “You just got a bit peckish and we were close by.”
He waved irritatedly at Zerk’s pocket. “I just got written up in the national bloody paper for having a nightmare and holding my boyfriend’s hand. The howlers will come pouring in, the curse-spewing letters. The suspicious students will be up in arms, he’ll be in danger all over again from vigilante fifth years, it never fucking ends. I’m desperate to play quidditch because I love it, but if I do, I know I’m accepting taking all this on all over again. If they'll even have me after this horse shit's come out. It's not just having very move I make watched and analyzed, but also that what gets published is the most ludicrous version of things. I’m tired of it, so very tired. Draco says I’m not theirs, but it still feels like I am.”
shield shimmering overhead. Harry felt a swell of relief at Draco’s quick action, but Merlin he wanted to be close to the other boy.
The chapter finished and before Draco could stop her, Lily launched herself onto Potter's lap. He lurched awake with a cry, momentary terror in his eyes. His arms jerked violently, but didn’t lash out. Draco recognised that pattern of behaviour from his own reaction to being startled awake and he felt for the man. The loss of control, no matter how momentary, could be sickening.
He wandered towards the kitchen. He arrived in the doorway only to have a bottle thrust at him by Jamie.
Hermione nodded, “Of course. I can see about getting Dean and Seamus and table as well, but you’ll have to settle up for them, Harry, they can’t afford it. We’ll keep eyes on you.”
“Well, that was cranial nerve eight out of twelve, so we have a few more to go, but so far, yes, you’re passing with flying colours.”
“What do you mean, a recording?” Draco demanded, “How does it get in here to Clark’s sitting room? Where does it go when you switch it off?” Draco bombarded them with questions and Harry swiftly realised he didn’t really know much about how televisions operated, exactly.
It seemed a reasonable thing for a potions master to do, so Harry just nodded. “Right, sure thing. A drop under the tongue every evening, straight to St. Mungo’s if something’s amiss. I’ll see to it. Oh—should I notify his mother or his grandparents? If that happens, I mean?”
Al took a step towards his friend, expression hurt and lost, but then lost his nerve, standing uselessly on the grass, looking between Scorpius and the greenhouses now visible on the horizon.
“I’d say you’re spot on with that assessment,” the healer agreed, “So, what are we going to do to keep that very reasonable fear from disrupting your days?”
“I promise you, Potter,” Malfoy said, giving his neck an affirming squeeze, “no one is bearing up as well as you’d think.”
Harry enlarged his trunk, dug out a quill, and wrote down the address for Clark and Draco to see, and then watched their startled expressions as the front of the dingy house seemed to spring up before their eyes.
Clark was crouched outside the entrance to the hall and he gasped when he saw Harry with Draco’s body.
Harry felt the ghost of a smile on his lips. He rolled his wrist over in his lap, the golden hand poised firmly on "school". He traced the line with his finger. There was no mortal peril and he should have remembered to just look it earlier, that was the express reason for the gift, after all. But it had felt so real, the certainty that Draco had been taken from him. “I’m sorry, everything’s so muddy, I can’t sort it.”
Harry stood back, feeling suddenly ridiculous for not thinking this through. He didn’t have a whip or a paddle or what have you, and using his hands felt wholly insufficient.
A stone ledge was built into one wall, upon which sat a small cauldron. She set the cauldron to boil and opened a cupboard overhead, pulling down the necessary items for tea. When it was prepared, she handed a mug to Harry and gestured for him to sit. The tea she served wasn’t what Harry was used to. It smelled of cardamom and had a bitter flavour.
“What if I can’t give you that?” Draco finally whispered, after a long moment of anticipatory silence.
“I was having a dream,” Draco repeated, and Merlin if he couldn’t quite rid himself of that snobbish drawl. Harry gritted his teeth. Malfoy certainly wasn’t doing himself any favours. “My best guess is that I cast a spell in my sleep. It brought me here.”
“It would be permissible if you’d kept these spells to yourself, but you didn’t,” Draco went on. “You shared them with Scorpius and myself, and therefore we are also at risk. What if one of us were to execute a spell accidentally, or with too much force? They’re too new, too untested. With magic there are always margins of error. You might not care for your own sake, Albus, but for Scorpius’, I should hope you would.”
Jared didn’t like the feeling in his belly when he and Harry touched the little statue on the mantle. It didn’t hurt but it tugged and made the world all spinny. The only good thing was it was over quickly and soon they were standing in Not-Gran’s kitchen. It smelled awfully nice in there.
"'Course not,” Harry agreed, forcing himself to give her a grin. “We thought you were great and that Dudley’s, er, lucky to have you."
Harry swallowed, thinking. When he entered a room it was like Draco was a gravitational force, and not just because he was Draco, but because of what he offered. That irreplaceable settling that came from just holding his hand, or sinking into him when they were side by side on the sofa, or simply the press off their legs at the breakfast table. Harry knew it was a bit much, that other couples didn't seem to crave it as he did. But Draco's skin, his presence and warmth and closeness, it was essential. “I haven’t thought about it before," Harry said slowly, unraveling this revelation with care, "but yes, definitely. Incredibly so. Like, I can hardly be around Draco without touching him. I want it all the time. It’s like I’m starved for it, it's never enough.”
“Potter,” George’s voice was cold as steel and he didn’t take his eyes off Malfoy. “Care to explain why you’re protecting the half-naked Death Eater who’s landed in our living room?”
“Hardly. Other people are a terrible inconvenience. They’re incompetent and irritating and dreadfully dull. I’ve work to do and a child to raise, and that should more than satisfy me.”
“That’s not true,” Harry insisted, but he knew no matter what he said, Teddy would always, in some ways, feel like an orphan. Harry still felt it, even before Ginny had left, when he thought he’d had everything he ever wanted: that missing piece on the periphery of his awareness. “If Molly Weasley’s my family, then she’s certainly yours. There are at least a dozen of us who would do anything in this world to protect you, love, you know that, right?”
This has come up in the comments a few times now, so I just want to give readers a heads up: I'm definitely guilty of being a Draco Malfoy apologist. While I appreciate a good redemption arc, this is definitely more of just a forgiveness arc. If that's not your bag (totally understandable!), this might not be the right story for you! Thanks for your understanding!
Harry was stalking his way up to Gryffindor tower alone, still pondering over what Cedric had told him. Was it just Harry, or had it been almost
“It doesn’t have to make sense.” Pansy leaned in closer to Granger, enjoying the way Granger’s eyes dilated as she glanced at Pansy’s lips. “I mean, I’m attracted to you even though that doesn’t make sense.”
Draco felt horribly nauseous, probably from apparating whilst under the influence and managed to knock over a quill pot whilst reaching over to pick up an orange marble which he promptly twisted open.
“Potentially,” Harry chuckled, “but I thought you might find this place interesting. I mean your mother’s family lived here right?”
Harry turned slowly round to see Malfoy grinning ruefully as the imaginary friend covered him in air kisses before turning her attention on the cupcake. “Plum?” she enquired happily.
Apart from that, Draco didn’t mind his job too much. Sure, the hours were long and the recognition was low but the paycheck was enough for Draco to live a modest but pleasant enough life in his small London apartment. He was also able to splash out occasionally on feel good treats such as enchanted bath bombs and sealed, ready to drink glasses of Goblin wine.
Harry had watched patiently for an hour, the fast forward spell forgotten, as Malfoy charmed a needle and set to work repairing the rip in his waistcoat. Harry had also discovered that the variety of odd potions ingredients that Malfoy purchased were so the other man could brew his own skin and haircare remedies at home. Whilst there were more convenient ready bottled options available, it was clear that Malfoy had grown up accustomed to a certain level of quality that he could no longer afford.
“Draco was saying something about using their silver for curses,” Harry continued cheerfully, unaware of the desperate remorse and unwarranted forgiveness that had just passed between the two men.
“Yes I know,” Draco panted, searching frantically for his wand before giving up and summoning his hair tonic wandlessly. “But I need someone to talk some sense into me.”
“Fine, thank you,” Winshaw replied through gritted teeth as Marlene wrapped her arm around his and jerked him to stand closer to her, evidently having forgiven his indiscretions.
A small, golden speck whizzed across the field before coming into focus, revealing it to be a heart shaped snitch. The heart hovered above the two names,
Every single humiliating detail of an entire month began trickling through Draco’s mind. The time he had sat down to practice stitching charms so as to fix up old underwear, allowing him enough budget left over to buy his birthday book, oh
“Fine,” Draco replied as they exited out onto the back garden which had been extended into a fully decked out pool area complete with its own bar. It was also already swarming with people, all laughing and talking. A big cheer went up when then spotted Harry along with a rousing rendition of happy birthday, that Hermione assured him Neville had also had to tolerate when he had arrived.
Draco laughed and turned to walk back over to the burgers as Harry did the same thing. It suddenly became apparent quite how close they were standing. Not to mention the fact that Harry was still only wearing his swim shorts, his chest bare and radiating heat.
“Plus, there’s a rumour they’re going to make Patricia’s baby not even his,” Draco continued as he added chopped onion to the pot. In the excitement he had forgotten to cast a no tears spell and was now looking suitably devastated at Francis Featherhorn’s potential onscreen exit.
“Talking of dubious morals,” Harry muttered as Ron grunted in agreement. Barely anyone in the DMLE was a fan of the new memory laws that allowed aurors to sift through memories for clues or alibis. For one, memories could be altered, which is why they had always been discounted before in major trials. Secondly, it was a horribly invasive process and the long hours required during memory stake outs made even the most iron stomached of aurors prone to bouts of disorientation and nausea.
“The Department are processing the memory vials now, ready for viewing,” Pewterfoot stated, “you’ll begin tomorrow, first thing.”
“Oh, are we talking about our imaginary friends?” Luna interrupted with a beaming smile. “Mine’s a Horned Gobblefish called Ethelred.”
Harry followed Ron into the man in question’s office. Pewterfoot was indeed hunched over his fish tank which was a completely clouded black.
to pass through. If Harry had suggested meeting somewhere else it might give the other man even less incentive to show up.
“What does ordinary masturbation look like?!” Draco half shouted frantically as Odette came to sit back down carrying two rocky roads.
Malfoy cleared his throat and Harry’s eyes were drawn to where he was pulling down his left sleeve like a nervous tic. The cufflinks already ensured the sleeve would never roll up, not that it would have even without them and Harry wondered if Malfoy even noticed he was doing it?
Harry had only come fully back to his senses when he realised the memory had progressed to back in the bathroom and the other man was unbuttoning his fly.
Harry let out a sigh of relief as Draco’s wards allowed him to reach the front door of his flat. He couldn’t help but feel happy that the other man must have recently amended them. Harry rang the doorbell, waiting until Draco opened the door in his pajamas with a shocked expression.
Before Draco could argue that a door knocker shouldn’t be so openly hostile to anyone in the first place, regardless of their lineage, the door itself swung open.
“I’d rather go starkers than associate myself with that gaggle of incompetents on brooms,” Draco sniffed.
“Merlin,” Draco muttered, of course the ‘saviour’ would be blessed in every way. Harry smiled before reaching down to wrap his fingers around Draco’s own cock, causing the blond to let out a surprised shout. Harry’s grip was just on the right side of tight as he slid his hand down Draco’s throbbing prick, pulling his foreskin over the sensitive glans before swiping the purpled head with the pad of this thumb.
“You say you’re fine, but you are clearly cooking shepherd’s pie,” Magalie replied, narrowing her honey amber eyes at the other man. “You always say that is ‘comfort food’.”
The perpetrator had been marched off by security towards some office but Draco knew it was all for show. Behind closed doors, the security guards would probably give them a firm handshake for their troubles. Being an ex Death Eater meant that Draco was used to the seething looks, the suspicious frowns, the jeers, the taunts, the insults, and on particularly bad days – the bodily fluid projectiles.
The next day would be Sunday, the last one of the month which would normally mean a big roast at the Weasley’s. However, Molly and Arthur had decided to go away for a long weekend to a cottage in Cornwall before the schools broke up and it all got too crowded.
The potions shop was dark and damp, off one of the side streets of Diagon Alley. Harry had never been down this area before. He watched as Malfoy perused the tall glass jars stacked on woodwormed shelves. Occasionally Malfoy would pop the lid off a jar and select a few dried ingredients with tongs before depositing them in bag.
“Don’t be ridiculous mate, this is our job,” Ron responded. “Even Malfoy will have to recognize that, especially if his memories clear him. Plus, Pensieve Probes aren’t yet acknowledged in French courts and that’s where he’d be heading.”
“It wasn’t exactly your finest moment,” Harry told him. “I remember you as being quite graceful on a broom.”
The garden had been completely trimmed back and although there was still some construction work going on down half of it, the other half had been completely landscaped. There was a beautiful kitchen garden with raised flower beds and an orchard area with apple and pear trees, even a haggard old cherry tree that they had discovered after cutting back the brambles. Everything was looking a little brown at the moment, however, with it being nearly December but come the spring, Neville had assured him it would be a riot of colour.
“Ah,” Luna nodded as if that explained everything. “Ron mentioned you were doing a Pensieve Probe at the moment. Is it Draco’s memories you’re exploring?”
“This is daylight robbery,” Malfoy snapped. The other customers’ tittering had grown louder and Harry half wished he could hex them to shut up.
“Once a week, because we all do,” Hermione huffed, “and going to the pub is not a ‘hobby’ Harry, or at least it shouldn’t be.”
“I don’t believe it!” Harry cried with a horrified expression. “You’ve made a deal with a sea witch haven’t you?”
“Try now,” Draco whispered as Harry moved, achingly slowly, drawing himself a little bit out before burying himself again in Draco’s tight heat.
“Fuck off,” Harry exclaimed as the other man exploded into howls of laughter, they were disturbing the other customers now. “God, you’re such a git.”
Draco eyed the large fireplace enviously, there was an open bag of floo powder on the mantelpiece. Draco had looked into trying to find somewhere that would allow him to regularly firecall his mother and commute from home but availability had been scarce and out of his price range. He sighed, turning back to Harry before squawking in alarm.
Harry’s arms released him as Draco turned onto his back and Harry moved to be on top of him, deepening the kiss but slowing it down. Draco moaned under the intensity of it, surging up to chase Harry’s lips as the other man drew back with a smile.
“Right, yeah, that’s probably for the best. Git’s right prickly at the best of times, reckon he’ll be a veritable hedgehog after this ordeal.”
“Maybe you’re not the only one to dive in headfirst sometimes,” Draco sniffed, but he was wearing a small smile as Harry sent him back a glorious grin. “There’s lube in the drawer, just…you’ll go very slowly won’t you?”
Harry made an indignant noise as Draco ignored him and continued talking. “We also still need to go to Diagon Alley to get swimming trunks.”
Hermione thankfully relented with a pointed look at Harry before the conversation redirected itself to the latest Quidditch draft. Harry knew that Ron would have told his wife who it was they were investigating. Sure enough, an hour later, after a few of the couple had left and the pub had quietened down, Hermione lent into Harry with a questioning expression.
“Some family I am. Fucking hell, how am I supposed to face George? Might as well just slap him in the face directly.”
Harry leaned in and kissed the bright red hand-print, “It’s quite alright, love. You’ll learn. Now. What else?”
Draco’s lip curled, “Don’t be gauche, Potter. No, I want…” He paused, dramatically, as if still thinking, tapping a finger against his bottom lip. “I want you to attend me.”
"Pansy is fine. Unfortunately, earlier today she found Greg wandering the hallways and he was rather beside himself. He said there was a woman in his head trying to convince him to leap off some the spectator stands at the quidditch pitch.”
“Sorry, sweetheart. Sorry." He resumed stroking Draco's hair, voice tender, "Are you hurt? Can you tell me that?”
The girls’ heads then swiveled towards Draco. He realised in horror they were awaiting praise from him, as well.
“Well, perhaps you could have stood to be a little more attentive, then. Although I imagine you are rather distracted right now," Malfoy remarked.
“You’re acting weird,” Scorpius blurted out, then covered his mouth in horror. That was something Al would say, not him! He knew far better than to be so rude.
Thanks so much to everyone for their patience. Midterms are coming so might be a couple of weeks before I get to the next update, sadly. Really appreciate your kind comments and thoughts!!
Fife cursed a blue streak but Al started humming tunelessly, pretending he couldn’t hear a word of the other boy’s outburst. Bernard yelled at them both to shut up again, and so finally, Fife blew out his candle and went to bed. Shortly after, Al did the same.
“Raw talent, extraordinary effort, and sheer excellence,” Draco informed him, “so far you’re zero for three.”
Harry eased his head down, kissing the back of Draco’s shoulder in a way that sent a spray of gooseflesh down his arm.
"Scorpius showed up in the library alone. What was I supposed to do? Pretend I didn’t spend half the summer with him? He looked lost, Al. You could have invited him with you.”
“Narcissa,” he said warmly, taking her hand and leaning in to kiss her icy cheek, “Such a pleasure to see you.”
Harry wasn’t lying when he said Clark was doing well. Over the past weeks, he'd been able to expand that void to mostly block out his thoughts, provided Harry didn’t try very hard. Nevertheless, Harry had still borne witness to more than a few deeply personal memories.
Clark sat up, his mouth twisting. “I’m sorry, Harry,” he said solemnly, “I shouldn’t have shown you these.”
“Very well,” Draco agreed. Harry suspected he appreciated her gumption. Draco signed the parchment with a practiced flourish, and passed it over for Harry to do the same. Well, Harry's signature was more of a scrawl, in comparison, he noticed, but of course it was.
“Hey,” James said gruffly, smoothing a bit of his dark hair over a spot forming on his forehead. Merlin, Draco was glad those days were behind him.
“How come?” Lily again. Harry’s should have known this would be how things went. His children were relentless on a good day.
“I was just down in the kitchens,” Harry explained, taking a step back so their posture might be less compromising if someone were to walk by, but he was loathe to take his hands off Malfoy entirely, “I asked the house elves if they could keep their eyes out for any students short a sheet.”
“Oh!” Hermione seemed surprised, but gave him a pleased look. “Okay, lovely. Nevermind my interfering, then,” Hermione assured him. “I just wanted to say something because...well, you just can be more than a bit oblivious when it comes to these things. I don’t want you to misinterpret his actions as friendship when he might be expecting or hoping for something more. And of course, I would never assume that simply because he’s a gay man, but I can’t ignore his demonstrably possessive actions, let alone the way looks at you.”
Harry felt the fury storming inside of him, but he bottled it, instead quirking an unimpressed eyebrow at the auror.
“I should like to offer an apology, Madam Malkin, for my and my mother’s behaviour two years ago. I’ve no intention of repeating such egregious sentiments. I understand, however, if you do not wish for my patronage.”
"Why Harry, you sound just like Dean." Seamus laughed, winking at Draco, "Only kidding, Malfoy, no need for jealousy."
Next question is from TessBarrow006: “What’s your favorite color in the new Scarlet Nights eyeshadow palette and why?” Oh, and we have the palette right here so you can point it out to us.
“That’s- I’m-” As Granger stumbled over her words, Pansy smirked and grabbed a random book of the shelf, not bothering to even see what it was.
Now that we’ve covered your to-die-for new products, we have a game we want to play with you, if that’s alright.
Well, I beat Harry Potter for the first time ever, so that’s pretty fucking spectacular. He can’t hold his winning streak over my head anymore.
“Only on my birthday,” Harry grinned. “Plus, I had a plant based burger for lunch so I reckon I can afford to be a little unhealthy.”
The rest of the office was empty as he shoved the offending papers under his arm and stormed out the door. It was three flights of stairs, four corridors and one lift that admittedly might have been a dumbwaiter before Draco reached the Ministry’s legal department. It was stifling hot and Draco swore under his breath as he pawed open the top few buttons of his shirt before undoing his waistcoat completely and just letting it hang open.
,” Harry insisted as the doors dinged open and they followed the other Ministry workers towards the floo ports.
“Right then,” the witch shrugged, gesturing with a gnarled old hand that was weighed down by rings. “Second floor on the right and straight on ‘til Mourning.”
“Draco?” a pretty woman in her early thirties was sat beside him. Her skin was dark and her hair was a mane of glossy curls, she was wearing a large cream cashmere sweater and her eyebrows were knitted together.
“Oh Lord,” Ron groaned as Boot sent them a look of commiseration. “What have we done now? Did you file that statement for the Lewisham - Milano case?”
Ron cleared his throat before folding up the map and plonking himself down on his lumbar support swivel chair that had been a present from Hermione. “You submitted Malfoy’s release forms?”
All of the fight seemed to leave Malfoy at once, seeping out of him in a draining wave. The other man slumped further down the wall.
“Yes, no, maybe, I don’t know!” Draco huffed. “Is it mad Mags? I mean why would I ever turn up there? Why would he ever invite me?”
Harry stumbled down the stairs, pulling his grey hoodie over his head. He skidded on the polished floorboards which had been stripped down to their original glory and fitted with luxurious green Persian rugs. He hurried past the kitchen where a large fire was crackling and autumn light was shining in through a stained glass window of a dragon.
As soon as he arrived home, the first thing Harry did was check his mailbox and there, sure enough, was an ornate looking card in the shape of a broom. Where the maker’s logo would normally be engraved were the words, ‘
“Fig, actually,” Malfoy replied, pulling out one of the wooden chairs as Harry and Magalie sat down either side of him. The two of them watched as Malfoy took a deep breath before blowing out his candle, Magalie eagerly nudging him to reveal his wish.
“You know I’ve never – “ Malfoy tutted before reaching for his wand, flicking it around with his wrist and muttering something under his breath that Harry couldn’t catch. A moment later Magalie seemed to fizzle transparent before reappearing in a slightly different pose.
“Probably got a lot to hide,” Ron huffed, folding his arms over his chest and sitting back in the chair.
“Friends with Potter? Good lord no, I don’t even speak to –“ Draco trailed off, “well, I mean he brought me a cinnamon swirl this morning but that was quite out of the ordinary.”
and do his job? A petite boy with sandy hair wandered out from a side office, half a pepperoni stick stuck in his mouth.
“Isn’t that department under Xander Picklemarsh?” Odette pulled a face as Malfoy nodded. Odette shuffled closer to Malfoy before lowering her voice to stage whisper. “Bit of a tosser isn’t he?”
“Couldn’t you just mix black sand in with any snallygaster marrow?” Potter frowned as Draco and Hermione both rolled their eyes.
“I wish I’d seen his face,” Harry grinned as Malfoy dabbed at his eyes with a nearby tea towel. Malfoy kept chatting to Lisette about other holidays he had been on, exciting places he had seen. It half made Harry want to go home and start booking a vacation for himself. He couldn’t remember the last time he had gone exploring somewhere new, even Ron and Hermione liked to go to France for a bit in the summer and Rose had insisted they visited Salzburg for the Christmas markets a couple of years back. Harry sometimes joined them so as to nap by the pool, but he never ventured far from the villa.
“Hello Ed,” Harry greeted. Winshaw was wearing a thoroughly miserable expression, weighed down by two bags. “How’s your leave going?” Harry asked brightly, leaving the word ‘enforced’ unsaid.
“This is ridiculous,” Draco huffed, he shifted on his seat looking embarrassed, “I’m just going to end the charm.”
Harry cleared his throat, urging himself not to immediately leg it to the nearest reflective surface to check the supposed stupidity of his nose.
Draco couldn’t think what to say so he opted to remain silent, observing Potter carefully as the man’s expression went from enthusiastic to frustrated to resigned and then back to hopeful again.
“Bakery and then home I think,” Malfoy sighed, staring up at the clear blue sky with cheerful tufts of white cotton clouds.
“So who says I’m charming?” Harry grinned slyly, swimming back towards Draco in a predatory fashion. It half made Draco want to employ his quickest backstroke and get the hell out of there but he stood his ground firmly, albeit suspended in the deep end of the pool.
“No,” Draco gasped, the last thing he needed was more suspicion that he was up to his old tricks. He wished he had never brought the bloody occamy eggs up in the first place, he had only been trying to impress Granger.
“I like your hair,” Harry snapped, looking fierce. “And I’d say that a whole sodding lot has changed in thirteen years, and for the better.”
“You have got to be joking,” Malfoy snapped. “The going rate for Dried Fluxweed is ten sickles to the pound. Plus, those griffin feathers are so aged I’m surprised they haven’t turned to dust!”
“Definitely don’t want that,” Harry pulled a face. “I had to help fish a gnome out of the fish pond last summer, only we’d all been away in Burgundy so it had been in there a while.” Harry shuddered before rising up to bid Draco goodbye.
“Black sand would stabilize the potion!” Draco retorted at the same time Hermione said, “That would balance it out!”
book shop. They had already spent forty five minutes in Pearl’s Parchments and another twenty in the literature section of the Mungo’s charity shop. Harry crossed the entrance to Banbury Cheese, which seemed a rather odd name for a book store and was immediately greeted by a number of wizened, old, long haired cats, perched upon teetering piles of books.
“Oh goodness no,” Hermione shook her head, “truly Harry, it’s only me and Ron that have noticed as we spend so much time with you. We just thought you’d maybe been feeling a little lonely recently.”
Draco kept watching contentedly for a few minutes before he moved into the bathroom. He pulled off his wet swim trunks before aiming a couple of drying charms at them and himself. Draco then changed into his shorts, which were a pale green grey.
“Bill Weasley, he’s one of the senior curse breakers at Gringotts – I had drinks with him this evening and at the end of it he told me if I was bored of the Ministry he’d be willing to take me on as an apprentice – I’d initially be hired as an external consultant but could do curse breaking training on the job and eventually qualify as one!”
“Did they do it on purpose?” Harry asked. “The aurors,” he explained at Hermione’s quizzical look. “Only,” Harry cleared his throat, “I’ve seen quite a bit of stuff like that in Malfoy’s memories, I reckon he still gets stick over his role in the war.”
“I think there might be a thunderstorm,” Luna stated, noting Harry’s eyeline. “Look, there’s a mass exodus of fetterswamplings seeking shelter inside.”
“That’s too many beans,” Draco frowned critically at his ingredient prep, it wasn’t going to be a proper cassoulet, just a quick approximation of the stew that he could make in a few hours. However, he had been so immersed in conversation with Magalie that he hadn’t even noticed himself accidentally opening the second can of beans.
Harry stood frozen on the utility room doorstep of Hermione and Ron’s house, looking out onto their back garden.
“Eat too many of those and you’ll get a spare tyre,” Marlene huffed, gesturing to Draco’s waist which admittedly had been growing a little soft over the last month. Draco had put it down to going out on so many lunch dates with Odette and friends along with his usual cooking. Plus, it was true, Potter had been sending an inordinate amount of baked treats.
“You can side along with me,” Harry told him. “Just meet me back here tomorrow at around ten and then we can go together.”
“Oh,” Harry paused, turning round to regard her with curiosity. “You guys managed to nail the people behind that?” The case had been taken up by a number of aurors as the illegal troll fights had also played host to a variety of dodgy gambling activities. Actually finding those accountable, however, had proven a little tricky due to the patronage of some rather influential wizards.
“Actually, I think it might just be a me thing,” Harry shrugged. “Ron waited seven years to propose to Hermione and they’d already had a kid together.”
“Mourning, it’s the section on how to handle grief and loss of loved ones,” the witch nodded, “we stocked it up after the War.”
you juvenile dimwits!” Draco shrieked to be heard over the ruckus, he could feel his cheeks heating up.
“Hah!” Harry laughed, looking out through the window. “George must have brought a box of his tongue lengthening lollies.”
“As if you’d dare manhandle me,” Draco sniffed, delicately dipping his toes in the water and finding it to be adequately warm. A second later, however, a swarm of screaming youngsters sprinted past in pursuit of an oddly shaped squat creature that Draco would later discover had been an irate garden gnome. One of the teenagers knocked into the back of Draco, sending him toppling forwards into the pool.
“We need to interview that Parisian dealer again,” Harry stated, “that was a solid lead, plus he had links to the Bianchi smuggling ring.”
“Christ,” Ron gasped as Pewterfoot nodded in affirmation, “not the bloody ferret! Since when does he work for the Ministry?”
Harry pulled out his wand to cast the fast forwarding spell, the sooner he got through these memories, the sooner he could get Malfoy acquitted.
“Oh bugger,” Malfoy snapped, his grey eyes narrowing down at the board, he looked eagerly up at Philippe, “rematch?”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, “three times over actually. I became Teddy Lupin’s godfather when I was eighteen.”
“Abdominal muscles?” Malfoy turned to her looking confused. “Magalie I thought we had established that there is little I can do about my lithe physique as evidenced by the infamous protein shake fiasco of last year.”
“Draco! Hey – over here,” Draco turned to see Bill Weasley beckoning him over. “Glad you’re here,” Bill smiled, “I was just trying to explain to Alexandre about what we’re doing for those frogs at work, only I reckon you’ll explain it better. Oh, Alexandre’s my brother in law by the way,” Bill gestured to the tall blond man stood beside them, “He works as a curse breaker for the Ministère des Affaires Magiques de la France believe it or not.” Bill pulled a sheepish expression, “I’m finding a bit tricky to explain the stratified layers theory in my rudimentary French but Fleur and Gabby have disappeared somewhere.”
Pansy smiled warmly at Draco. “Oh, Drakey-kins, of course you’re good enough for him. Don’t ever think that you’re not, okay?” Pansy paused in the middle of her pep talk to cup Draco’s face in her hands and make him look her in the eye. “Hey, I mean it. You’re amazing. Harry Potter may be the Wizarding World’s Golden Boy, but if he passes up an opportunity to be with you, then all he really is is a damn fool.”
“I’m not trying to get with you or anything, Potter,” Malfoy said, his voice panicky and words rushed now. “I only told you so that you’d understand my perspective a little better. It’s not like I’m pining for you. I’m not. I’m really not.”
That’s a crazy theory, isn’t it? I’ve heard that before, and the fans seem to be genuinely invested in it.
“No, Potter, wait,” Malfoy said. He looked like a mess. There was the disheveled hair and the rumpled robes, altogether making him look nothing like the Malfoy Harry was used to seeing. “You can’t tell anyone about this,” Malfoy said insistently. “My father would kill me, I swear. And it’s not like there’s anything to tell, really. Blaise is just a friend, and he doesn’t even know if he likes boys anyway, and this is never going to happen again. At least not in an unprotected alcove. But that’s beside the point. Just don’t tell, Potter, please. I’m begging you.” Malfoy was rambling, and it was hard for Harry’s brain to catch up.
You’d pretty much be a terrible team captain, you know that? Most important? We’re all equally important here, Malfoy.
Harry was taken aback, literally stunned into silence. Malfoy was saying that all these years of being the most horrid, filthy scum of the earth was just a ploy to get Harry’s attention. Because, apparently, Malfoy had had a
Yeah, it’s like my whole life, so it’s kind of weird, but honestly I love Scarlet for it and I wouldn’t want her to change.
“Okay then. Thank you, Malfoy. That’s very, er, noble of you, I suppose,” Harry said. With Malfoy’s anger diffused and his purpose for being pulled aside fulfilled, Harry didn’t know what to do now. He just stood there, looking at Malfoy, who was looking back at him without any more malice, and once again Harry felt unsettlingly drawn to the other boy. He was, actually, kind of—well, kind of pretty, once you got past the haughtiness and general annoyance.
“I’m, um-” Harry paused to clear his throat in an effort to sound less hoarse. “I just needed to work on my Potions essay.” As if trying to prove that he was telling the truth, Harry pulled a quill and parchment out of his book bag. Harry slid his fingers across the parchment, trying to smooth it down, and Draco watched his hands move.
“Be quiet,” Draco stressed. Pansy bit him to make him pull his hand back. “Ouch,” Draco said, but Pansy couldn’t care less about his pain.
I think what’s most important is that we’ve raised money for so many charities today. That’s the takeaway from this match.
“I know you don’t have much respect for Slytherins, but did you honestly believe that we’re daft enough to not notice the bright white trainers suddenly floating in the air?” Draco gave a pointed look to Harry’s feet.
Welcome. So, you’re all playing in the upcoming “Quidditch for a Cause” match, organized by Mr. Harry Potter here. Now I think we all know what “Quidditch for a Cause” is by this point, but maybe you could all go around and say what position you’re playing and what charity you’re supporting.
I’m really glad I’m on this team, even though I’m pretty sure Harry just put me on it so I could keep an eye on Draco. We all get along really well, especially us Chasers. I even dated Dean back in the day at Hogwarts- we’re friends now, of course, I’m just trying to say that we’re all very close. I knew Alicia at Hogwarts too. I used to think she was cool back then, but now I think she’s simply amazing.
Draco gasped as Harry pushed his hand full inside Draco’s pajama bottoms, massaging the globes of Draco’s arse whilst his index finger ran slowly up the gap between them, not yet going any further.
“Merlin, that’s it, I’m going inside and changing,” Draco muttered, summoning his dry pair of shorts.
“With a herd of Gryffindors,” Draco continued, wondering at what point Potter would realise he needed to check himself into Mungo’s for a suspected brain transplant.
“I –“ Malfoy paused, his mouth so thin it was as if his lips had disappeared, Harry could see his hands were shaking.
“Y-you,” Harry panted, pushing Draco gently away and fumbling with his buttons. “Want to do the same to you
He stared balefully at the contents of his cupboards.  Normally, Saturday morning would mean Crêpes Suzette but he just couldn’t face any form of cooking right now. Instead, Draco poured cereal into a bowl with almond milk and headed for the living room.
Draco grinned as he settled down in the armchair and summoned a notepad, he was already bursting with possible ideas they could try.
“You don’t have to go,” Draco blurted out, turning a peculiar shade of pink. “I mean, don’t get the wrong idea. I’m not suddenly in the mood for hanky panky or anything.”
“Sir,” Harry leaned forwards, he didn’t really care anymore to be honest if the French wanted to take over the case. Besides, it sounded like it was going to lead them to Italy and the last time that had happened Harry and Ron had spent five weeks with little to no sleep in a grotty safe house without even a glimpse of the coliseum or a freshly cooked pizza. “What about Draco Malfoy? He’s clearly got nothing to do with this and should be released.”
Draco noticed that the aurors had all shed their heavy red robes and were now resembling harlequin romance protagonists with tight grey trousers, knee high boots and white shirts with the sleeves rolled up. In Potter’s case, the insufferable prick was also donning a thick leather shoulder holster that framed his pectorals and was clearly designed to drive Draco to the brink of insanity.
“Terrible pun mate,” Ron shook his head as Hermione sealed up the gouge before vanishing the blood and muck from Harry’s torso.
“We’re all a bit exhausted what with the Mudchute Troll Fights finally being closed down,” Penny smiled as she walked with Harry towards a gingham cloth covered table upon which sat bottles of beer and bowls of crisps.
“To be honest,” Ron hiccoughed, “as much as I don’t like Malfoy, he really doesn’t seem to be involved in an international potions smuggling ring.”
Malfoy was sweating and breathing heavily as he through his forearm over his eyes and exhaled deeply.
“That’s right,” Bill piped up, the tension falling away as his posture changed and Draco could hear the rest of the beer garden again. “You can melt it down to use as ink on curse tablets or as edging on objects where you want the curse to be bolstered.” He turned back to Draco, “You interested in curse theory then?”
“Ron, do I have a thick arse?” Harry questioned urgently as his friend dropped the sugar quill he’d been gnawing on and pulled a funny face.
“Yes, I’ve been saving –“ Malfoy’s eyes widened and he closed his mouth with a painful sounding snap. “I’ve been saving reading it for a rainy day,” he concluded as Harry and the witch both turned to see the bright sunshine filtering in from outside.
by Lysistrata Nell,” Malfoy whispered the names of the books as his long, pale finger trailed across their spines. “
wand!” he snapped his fingers. Magic, especially wandless magic, was more often than not, suppressed by being in a pensieve. The fast forwarding and pause charms had taken the Ministry years to actually develop. Despite wands in the memories not actually being the real physical things, they were designed as mental props in order to direct and focus the mind’s magical core. Harry knew his real wand was back in some Ministry office with Ron, for all and intents and purposes he shouldn’t
“Just things I see normally, like I’ll look around the bathroom and try to incorporate stuff into a rhythm.” Harry took a deep breath, aware of how much honesty it might take to finally get Draco to feel at less of a disadvantage. “I eat a lot of spicy food so sometimes I spend…quite a while in there.”
Hermione sighed but her expression was fond. “No, Harry, I think Draco was probably just a little embarrassed. But you had to go and jump straight in didn’t you? I mean he only agreed to forgive you and be your friend
“Hilarious, you wanker,” Harry pulled a face, “if you must know it’s more of a Nimbus 3000 sort of deal.”
“Yeah, well apparently last Friday Terry Boot caught Winshaw and his auror partner snogging in a cleaning cupboard!”
“Couple of minutes,” Harry grinned, “although that’ll be enough time for Hermione to rip him a new one.”
After a particularly nasty incident with an antique letter opener, Hermione had forbidden her husband to attempt to heal cursed wounds himself and whilst the bull’s horns hadn’t exactly been cursed, he had evidently been keen to show his wife how well he had listened.
“You are shiny and impressive,” Odette nudged his side, passing him the larger slice of marshmallow covered brownie, “doesn’t matter whether you’re toiling away in that rotten basement or jerking yourself into mind numbing orgasm whilst dressed as a niffler –“
Harry stared at the wall of his and Ron’s shared office, it was an odd shade of painted yellow which clashed with the darkness of the flagstone floor.
Harry snorted, his shoulders shaking as he ducked behind Draco’s shoulder to avoid Ron’s wrathful glare. Draco grinned unabashed as he felt the heat from Harry’s body through his shirt.
“Ginger?” Ron asked, holding out a tin of hard boiled sweets. “Hermione got them for me, apparently they help with the nausea.” Harry knew that Ron struggled a little with pensieve trips, much like muggles would get carsick.
“I hoped the beard might even it out,” Harry chuckled, “although Ginny’s threatened that she wants it shaved for the wedding.”
Malfoy was wearing a pale green waistcoat that Harry hadn’t seen before, it was silk brocade with a very light lavender shirt underneath and dark grey trousers. Malfoy fiddled with his cufflinks, which were silver M’s, before eyeing himself appraisingly in the mirror.
“People like you shouldn’t be allowed in the Ministry,” Winshaw huffed, shoving the book back in the bag with enough force to tear the sides, making both Malfoy and Harry wince.
“Well,” Ron cleared his throat after a few moments of awkward silence. “Turns out Ed’s a bit of a tosser eh?”
“If I could have everybody’s attention?” an older witch was standing on a chair in the middle of the beer garden, a pile of clipboards levitating beside her. “It is time for the monthly quiz.”
Harry raised his eyebrows in interest, Dexter had been four years below them in Hogwarts and a Slytherin.
“Everyone always tried to avoid staring at them,” Bill continued, “to the point that they practically do acrobatics with their eyes whilst trying to have a conversation with me.”
“What if Hermione’s wrong?” Harry huffed. “I don’t want him to think I’m ignoring him now, that he was some kind of failed project.”
Draco’s eyes took the other man’s brief distraction as invitation to rake down Harry’s bare torso. Brown skin dipped in between chiseled abdominal muscles and thick, wiry hair covered a good portion of his chest, leading tantalizingly to the hem of his joggers.
The other man was in the process of pulling his shirt over his head, his glasses falling off onto the rug and his hair sticking up even more than usual.
“Better keep me inside all to yourself then,” Harry agreed readily, his tongue darting out to lave small kitten licks against the notches of the top of Draco’s spine.
“Stunning,” Draco nodded, looking pleased with the information he had acquired. “Now tell me an embarrassing habit you have, something you do when you think no one’s watching.”
“Fig rolls today,” Ron stated miserably eyeing the platter of biscuits, “is this someone’s idea of sick joke?”
Draco sighed, feeling more on familiar ground now. Leave it to Potter to never let an injustice go by without remedy.
“And now for the music round,” the witch announced. “What Weird Sister’s single was the first to reach number one in the wizarding charts?”
“I think I may have to reconsider my initial favourable impression of you,” Draco announced as Odette started giggling again and Matthew shook his head ruefully.
“I suppose one does that when normally no one would possibly reject an invitation from the savior of the wizarding world?”Draco suggested wryly as Potter pulled a face. The other man led Draco over to the table .
“I think that might be pretty cool,” Harry grinned, pleased to see Draco was smiling again, “definitely more interesting that some of the weddings I’ve been to.”
Harry wondered how offended Molly would be if he formally emancipated himself from the Weasley family?
“Oh, we all know that,” Marlene smiled coolly, “Ed told me where you were. But I thought it would be more civil if we just pretended.”
summer line. He had told Harry that it had actually done very well with middle aged witches and he didn’t understand why Neville refused to put in a bulk order for the Hogwarts Greenhouses.
Malfoy was busy scribbling a note with his accioed quill when the owl started tapping on the window to announce its arrival.
“Alright lads,” Auror Philips strode into the office without knocking, her coppery curls bouncing just above shoulder length. “There’s a briefing in ten, the boss wasn’t sure you guys would have got the memo as apparently you were gallivanting across the Clifton suspension bridge or something.”
Harry watched a pinpricks of rain speckled onto the window outside, he supposed the sunny weather had held out long enough.
“So,” Magalie leaned forwards eagerly, “is this the point where I give you a stern talking to about your intentions for my wonderful Draco?”
Draco turned around to see an outraged looking teenager with green hair and pierced ears, headphones hung around his neck, blasting some sort of loud music, the genre of which Draco wouldn’t be able to identify if you paid him.
“Like the world’s most unappetizing Pick and Mix,” Harry commented dully as Malfoy finally seemed satisfied with his selection and went up the till.
They had somewhat of an awkward friendship. Passing each other soft smiles as they walked past each other in Ministry. Looking for each other at ministry balls, even though they don’t talk much but still keeping an eye on each other from afar.
“Any plans for tonight’s ball?” she nudged his elbow as he stood beside him. “no, and don’t you have a certain redhead to bother?” he asked he checked the list of guests arriving.
Beatrice took a close look at the man, “the only place he could possible be at is this abandoned chapel, after the first war”.
They sat on the empty slot. Hermione offered her hand to the man and he started to fill her hand with a beautiful design. The man in front of Draco looked at him warily, apparently not used to a man wanting to apply henna before.
“I’d hate to break up this reunion but I really want to play this muggle game.” Said Ginny clapping her hands together. She handed Draco a plastic glass of some cheap beer. “muggle game, muggle drinks”
He then realized that the picture showed his whole neck and the collarbone from where the shirt had come down and his shirt was so big it looked like he wasn’t wearing anything underneath and showed his crossed legs, he was smiling in the pic.
“why are you doing this?” he asked Alice as she was cuffing him to the poll. “you’re too naïve Harry. I joined the task force to get justice. Instead all I got is a team of gutless aurors, who instead of throwing death-eaters in jail, was giving them a second chance!” she said with hatred evident on her face. Harry cursed himself for not seeing it earlier. He knew Alice struggled with her emotions. Maybe he could have helped her.
It took Hermione three hours to find everything about the blood bond she can. “how did you even create a blood bond with Malfoy?” she asked setting down few books and vials.
“I’ll call you back Alice, I gotta go”. He said. He put the phone in his pocket and turned towards Draco who was looking paler than usual. “well, care to explain, what is going on?”
“you can’t do shit! You were the one who found Malfoy for us Harry” she said laughing at his face. “we were lost. Kingsley did a good job at hiding him. Hell, when he first got the wind of what we want from Malfoy that shit erased every evidence. But then you and you spilled the beans about your little crush on Malfoy. And all I had to do was play a dress-up with you” she said mockingly. Harry was on the verge of performing a cruciatus on her, luckily Cassie came in.
“Malfoy” he regarded back. Draco leaned towards the door. they also had an unusual friendship, not much close but he admired Ron. Especially his ability to play wizard chess.
. He saw how Draco cheeks turned red, “thank you, you clean up nice as well”. Harry looked down at himself hiding his own blush, “yeah uh a friend helped, you ready to go?”.
“so you, are you one of those unlucky souls that got put on a lead that probably doesn’t exist or the devoted “I’ll do anything for the wizarding world type” he asked in a friendly manner, trying to know the intentions of the man.
“Sorry to keep you waiting your highness,” he said as they all walked towards the main town. It was hot and if it wasn’t for Hermione holding his hand he’d have already fainted.
The ministry seized anything his family-owned and he donated all his inheritance anonymously to help rebuild Hogwarts and to the orphanage of the children whose parents died in the war. He knew no amount of good he ever did will ever measure up to the bad he committed during the war.
Harry descended downstairs quiestly, the candles provided little light it could. It was like a tunnel with dimly lit lantern. Billie came down the ladder, “this doesn’t look like a basement”
With a choked sob he dared his hand steady. Draco was nodding at him with a little smile, “it’s okay Harry, you can do it. I love you” he said.
Draco groaned loudly that Harry had to put his fingers in his mouth to shut him up, “you’re loud, I’d love to hear you, but we got to keep it down a little for the time being yeah baby”
He saw the moon was out in all its glory. He took Harry’s hand and they both slipped away from the part. He brought them to the balcony where Draco conjured the things, he needed to break the fast.
The ministry took away the wand of every wizard who was on the side of the dark lord and those with the mark were sent to The Azkaban. Thanks to Harry Potter he didn’t meet the same fate as the other.
"I was hoping you we can discuss the American-British donation treaties after the party.," he asked taking a sip of his champagne.
“we can’t just let the minister roam free and wait for him to reach the last few stages”, everybody turned towards Jamie.
“she said she got a lead about that guy who attacked you earlier today” said Jamie. “alright, we need to get Kingsley here. I think he’s under the curse of the medallion” he said look around the room. Everyone looked at each other.
he reminded himself. “Draco I.. I would like to take you on a date”. Harry caressed his nape out of nervousness, and then added “this felt like a date as well but I didn’t want to say anything because of the Jake thing and I really wanted to ask you out earlier as well but I didn’t want to come out as an asshole-“.
Ron and Hermione found him before he made it to the dormitory. Hermione linked her arm through his, giving it a comforting squeeze.
Never mind. Draco didn’t wish to speak about his father this evening. Or ever, really. His childhood was a sea of bleak memories and suffocating shame. It served no purpose to dwell.
Harry answered Ron's question this time.  “That’s not what she said. But, like, think about it, mate. Dumbledore would never have fallen for something so obvious or so, I don’t know, juvenile. Those first efforts, I'd be willing to bet they were nothing but stalling tactics. It doesn’t erase what happened to Katie and what happened to you, and I’m not saying it was right, but it doesn’t make him a killer.” Harry contested, giving voice to debates he'd had with himself over these last few weeks, when so much of his ruminations had involved analysing Draco's past and present. “Besides when it came down to it, he couldn’t do it. I was there that night, when Snape—anyway. I was there and Draco didn't do it. He couldn't, that’s not who he is, I believe that.”
from within his mind. He felt Lavender’s presence ejected brutally and suddenly, leaving him gasping.
discussion of cannon compliant child abuse and violence (and also the c word which is definitely not cannon compliant)
“Well, if you ask him to be part of your team, he’s hardly going to turn you down, now, is he?” Draco had said when Harry had mentioned his disappointment.
“Surely there is a middle ground,” Draco pointed out. “One in which you acknowledge the mistake, sort out why it happened, apologise if you absolutely must, and determine how best to keep from repeating the same offense again, and
The potions classroom still had a slight smoky smell from the recent fire, and was filling with a mix of first year Slytherins and, Harry assumed, fourth year Ravenclaws and Gryffindors. Once again, he was guiltily impressed at all the girls’ thoughtfulness and planning, of which he had been completely unaware. Claire Gibbens charged past him, her nose up, and a pert, high-pitched, “Hmph!”
“Enough,” Harry barked, stepping back, Merlin, he was going to make the other boy pay, “Clothes off. Now.”
At least that was true. After a practice, Harry would often consume the entire pantry, just to make up for the energy deficit that came with training with the Falcons.
“It...certainly seems effective,” Draco conceded, still flabbergasted by the potency. “And it doesn’t come back? Not even traces of it?”
“I’ll tell you some of the adventures another time,” Harry promised. “Like how we broke into Gringotts and escaped on the back of a dragon.”
Harry gave him a rueful smile. “You’re terribly good at it, is it the thing. If I wasn’t so damn stressed about it all, I might have taken a moment to appreciate it. The whole bloody pantomime with Remy? You got under Ron’s skin like you did it for a living.”
Harry kept kissing him, and for a moment Draco wondered if he needed to repeat himself, but then Harry rolled reluctantly away, kicking off the covers and sitting up. Draco followed suit, feeling uncomfortably raw. He’d become unaccustomed to asking for things. If he couldn’t do something himself, then he’d learn the necessary skills. If that wasn’t possible, whatever it was likely wouldn’t get done at all. He slung his arms around his knees, only barely resisting curling into a tight ball, as though that would somehow bring him back together.
“Babe?” Harry asked tentatively, trying to stave off the panic threatening to occupy his chest, “What’s happened?”
nature. For Mr. Tiering it was just incessant, whereas for Ms. Lum, it seemed to play more to her desires. It convinced her that injuring Mr. Malfoy would win her friends and admirers.”
There was a bright red X across it, indicating that someone had followed it, and deemed it another dead end, but Harry felt compelled. He walked on, past the X, and Draco followed silent and diligent, his pale face drawn. Harry knew the constant thrum of concern was wearing both of them down, like candles left burning and forgotten. They’d have to sleep eventually, he knew, although he couldn’t bear it. So for now, he pushed on.
Pansy didn’t close the door, because she’d chucked out all sense of decency with the divorce. Draco was very nearly used to it, but he still flinched at the telltale sound of water on water.
“Very generous of you,” Jamie chuckled, but he really was grateful for the assistance. He doubted he could get anywhere on his own—he didn’t know the first thing about curses!
“I take it this means it escaped your notice that I'm bent as well?” Malfoy’s voice was curious, and Harry felt confused. Was he supposed to know that? And if he was, how? Did everyone else know that?
An hour passed. Draco had pulled down a volume on medieval healing practices and Clark was lying on the carpet by the hearth, one arm under his head and his little mp3 player resting on his stomach, the ear buds tucked inside his ears.
For a moment they stayed like that, frozen. Finally, Harry released the death grip he had on Draco’s hair, and stroked gently through it instead. Draco maneuvered himself off of Harry’s cock, and pressed his forehead against one of Harry’s thighs, breath coming quick and harsh.
“Or, sorry,” Harry cut in, swallowing too quickly. The food was a thick lump as he tried to get it down. “That’s personal, you don’t have to tell me.”
“Oh, definitely,” Zerk assured him, “there are much milder ones, if that’s a route you want to pursue.”
“Yes, there is only one Smith family in all of wizarding Britain,” Draco said, dryly, “well spotted, Weasley.”
“Potter,” Draco declared, extending an arm for Harry to grasp hold of, “every so often, you are blessed with a truly excellent idea.”
Harry bit his lip and nodded. He wondered if he wouldn’t rather be facing Voldemort all over again than this. At least he didn’t give a fuck about disappointing Voldemort.
Harry felt a thrill of injustice spike through him, “Not cool, mate,” he managed to restrain himself, “we’ll talk later.”
Draco chuckled at the anecdote and Potter rewarded him with a little grin, which faded suddenly as a thought seemed to cross his mind. He swallowed and Draco watched the stubbled curve of his Adam’s apple bob in his throat. Merlin, but he liked looking at the man.
“I presume you mean me?” Draco asked from where he was seated beside Harry. He was clearly amused in a way Harry couldn’t quite share. Claire simply sniffed and refused to answer. Malfoy looked like he had more to say on the matter, but Harry put a hand on his forearm to warn him off.
Shout out to my miracle-worker of a beta, Mimbelwimbel for all her help and grammatical insights! All remaining mistakes are entirely my own!
Draco pursed his lips, folding his arms across his body once again, “I...I didn’t react well to seeing you hurt.”
.” Draco’s lip curled so violently on the word that it nearly reached his eye. “Now, I’m not entirely certain.”
“Are you alright?” Jamie asked as Scorpius took the seat beside him. Boone eyed him with shrewd interest, but Scorpius couldn’t think why. Surely Jamie hadn’t told anyone that Scorpius was a Vates. Scorpius banished the thought. No matter what Al said, Jamie wasn’t a bad sort.
“Goodnight,” he muttered with as much politeness as he could manage (it wasn’t much), and headed towards the door.
“Oh,” Potter considered, scraping his thumbnail across the stubble on his chin. “Are you going to see her?”
“I don’t date," Draco said at once, blotting out the hopeful nonsense Potter was spouting. "I don’t take serious lovers. I’ll not upset the equilibrium of my life. I spend entirely too much time thinking about you as it is.”
“Oh, it’s catered, darling, of course,” his mother assured him, as though Draco had been worried about her putting in too much labour instead of too much...everything. “And besides, Harry is always ravenous. I wanted to make sure there would be plenty leftover for him.”
Harry shrugged, Mr. Weasley’s hands were still on his shoulders. “He knows I’d keep him safe,” he replied, his voice low.
Before Draco could wrap those pretty lips around his cock again, Harry gripped Draco’s wrists and wrenched him upwards.
Scorpius pulled away, looking up at him, brows knitting together seriously. “But you said when you got home from Brazil, I could maybe ask him here for a visit.”
“Sweetheart,” Harry said gently and Draco glanced up. He looked small and lost and so unlike himself. Harry stepped in close, one hand curling around Draco’s cheek. Draco seemed torn between leaning into the touch and pulling away, opting instead for utter stillness. “It was an honest mistake. We’ll set a reminder going forward, it won’t happen again. And no one found anything out, not really. Main and Mulligan aren’t going to extrapolate that he’s a Vates with so little information, not when they are so rare. I’d never even heard of them before you told me about Scorpius. It’s going to be alright. Please don’t torture yourself.”
Jamie blushed, but his teacher didn’t sound angry, so he reckoned it was alright to keep going. “My mum did, that’s for certain. She always said she grew up poorer than a church mouse and nothing made her feel more crumby than when people would draw attention to it. But we weren’t ever rich, so I don’t know what it’s like, and how will I know if I don’t ask?”
“No, it’s not a no!” Harry remarked. “Babe, of course I want to! I’ve been thinking about it for weeks now, I just...I’ve not done that, have I? And you like things a bit rough, and I’ve got to make sure I don’t hurt you, and we’ve not had a lot of time for it, and like, what if I do it wrong? So it’s been easier not to, but Merlin, please don’t read that as rejection. Hell, I’m off my head when it comes to you; I want everything you’ll give me.”
“I don't think you would. Because It isn’t fair, and it isn’t right,” Clark said. And with that, he ripped off his Aversion Amulet and tossed it into Moaning Myrtle’s toilet. Then, before anyone could stop him, he cast
“We all wanted to see Jared,” Harry corrects, firmly. “We invited her here and she wanted to come. We’ve had a nice time together, the last couple of days. This was one lapse in judgment, sweetheart. Let’s not jump to the worst possible conclusion. Your mother is resilient. She's pulled herself up from far worse than this. And now, she has support. That can go a long way for a person.”
“A little discipline goes a long way,” Draco said, appearing in the stands, and seating himself beside Harry. “It only took the better part of a year, but the Occammies are now very nearly something with which I’m not ashamed to associate myself.”
“And we can’t wait to leap about like Coozits for the rest of the day,” Malfoy replied, brown-nosing grin still intact, “Potter, gather our supplies, would you?” He opened the potions textbook to the appropriate page and slid it across the table.
“Well, so long as word doesn’t get out, I suppose it doesn’t hurt,” Professor McGonagall said with a sigh.
They did keep looking, as did other groups of eighth years, covering and recovering corridors and classrooms, broom closets and supply sheds.
“Remy seemed perfectly well when they left,” he asserted instead. “It was just a precaution, so let’s assume the best until we have reason to do otherwise.”
“What if it’s not enough?” Clark whispers. “What if I go back to school and I’m not there and she goes to bed and stays there, not bothering to buy groceries or pick Jared up from school.  What if she gets into her paranoia and gets lost there, and I can’t do anything about it?”
He unfurled the parchment to find a letter to the editor in Hermione’s neat script. Draco read along over his shoulder.
“You can maybe see why I said you shoulder an impossible burden, Harry,” the healer said quietly, “You’re allowed to just be you, as well. No matter how hard you try, there is no pleasing everyone. I know you can’t escape the public eye, and I’m sorry for that, because I know you didn’t ask for it, but I think there are ways of letting all that pressure go. You can speak out as needed, but you can also rest.”
“Now who's got too many damn sensibilities?” Harry grumbled, stuffing the soiled silk into his pocket and getting to his feet. He ran a hand through the permanent disaster that was his hair, feeling self-conscious, “Thanks,” he muttered, “I’m sorry about all that.” He gestured vaguely at the floor as if a hand wave and a veiled reference could stand in for a semi-delusional meltdown.
“Shut your mouth,” Weasley hissed. “You don’t know a thing about him. You weren’t there, during the war. Too busy doing what? Being a little poof for the Death Eaters? Bet that really stoked morale, eh?”
“Stop,” Harry commanded, curious. Draco pulled his hand away with an ardent, pained lament, chest heaving, “Beautiful,” Harry told him.
“Good man. You were right to come here tonight, I hope you know that. I’d like you to spend the night here, we’ll get you a private room—I know you’re in the public eye much more than anyone would like. I’d also like to give you a Potion for Dreamless Sleep, just for tonight. Poor sleep, stress, and being overtired can make nightmares worse, and I think it would be good for you to be able to rest without worrying about that. We’ll talk again tomorrow, but I suspect I can just keep seeing you as an outpatient. I’ll speak with your headmistress about your coming here every week or two and we’ll see how things go. How does that all sound to you?”
Another roar of approval from the crowd, and the stage lights went dark. On cue, the booths and vendors bustled to life, melodies floating on the wind, chimes and whistles sounding and voices calling out: “Caramel apples!”, “Fresh Faeire Floss!”, and, “Come, put your keen minds to the test!”. Soon the specific criers were drowned out by the hubbub of the masses, funnelling their way towards the promised festivities.
“Professor!” said the man. Draco recognised the voice as belonging to Edward Lupin. It stood to reason he had not recognised the young Metamorphmagus, as his look was certainly more bohemian than it had been when Draco had known him at school. His chosen features today included a sharp, diamond jawline and a Roman nose. Gone were the apple cheeks, squared chin, and brown mop he commonly adopted at Hogwarts.
“Does that usually happen, then?” Malfoy inquired suspiciously, arms crossed. “Your magic trussing up your partner?”
I'm SO sorry for the long wait. I'm definitely not abandoning this story! I've just got a pinched nerve in my neck and so screen time is hard and sleep is difficult, so creativity is not exactly flowing. Hoping it will resolve soon-ish, but until then, updates will unfortunately be less frequent.
Harry explained his improbable exchanges with Malfoy: from looking after Scorpius to the day’s shopping. He left out the bit in his study; he was still trying to parse that interaction himself.
“Professor Stump, your predecessor, will have no doubt left you hers. She’s a practical woman, and clever. You’re familiar enough with the curriculum and I’ve no doubt you can improvise the rest.”
After showering, they went down the great hall. It was maybe a quarter-full of mostly bleary-eyed students in various combinations of pajamas and school attire. The breakfast spread was rather decadent, Belgium waffles and whipped cream with fruit preserves. Draco eyed them with interest. Harry’s eyes, however, went to the far end of the Slytherin table. Clark wasn’t there.
“Oh, please, you weren’t exactly subtle.” She passed one of the servings of crumble across the tablecloth. Draco wasn’t sure he could stomach sweets just now, not with his head still swimming like it was. “Tea?”
