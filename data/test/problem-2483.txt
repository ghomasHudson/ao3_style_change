“That your coat?” he asked, grabbing one from the hook by the door.
The reply was mumbled into the pillows and was the only reaction Draco got. He hesitated for a moment his hand hovering over Harry’s shoulder, as if afraid that he was only a figment of his imagination and would vanish if he touched him. The warmth radiating from Harry’s clad shoulder finally convinced Draco that he was indeed real. Draco shook him gently, but Harry only mumbled something else and burrowed deeper into the pillows while moving closer to Draco at the same time.
He splashed cold water into his face, trying to calm his shaking hands. Watching his reflection in the mirror and following the rivulets of water slowly trickling down his face with his eyes, Harry realized that he was scared. Scared of what the future held, scared for Draco’s life and most of all scared of how far this obsession would take him.
“What is that?”
When Harry watched Draco talk about what he enjoyed, the man seemed to change completely. It was an eye-opener. Harry had only ever seen Draco in situations that were about status, about fear or fury, he had never seen him take such innocent pleasure in anything and it transformed him.
Harry stood by the sink, staring forlornly into the filthy dishwater. He knew plenty of spells that would do the job for him, but most days he found doing chores had something calming and helped him to clear his mind. As ridiculous as this sounded to even himself, tonight it only made him sad, perhaps because he knew, that no amount of scrubbing would wash the filth of his lies away.
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair and Draco felt guilty, because he hadn’t even once thought about what Sophia’s prolonged stay would do to Harry.
Her voice calmed him. Harry nodded.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“I just do. Aren’t you happy they pardoned you?” Potter asked, confusion evident in his voice.
“The shooting star of course! Come on, I’ll fetch my broom.”
“It doesn’t matter Harry. Some scars are merely more visible than others.”
Getting up to pick up a journal, Draco glanced across the paintings on the wall that were supposed to make the room cheerful but only managed to somehow underline the feeling of boredom as well as anticipation and the impression of fluctuation at the constant to and fro of patients being asked to wait and called to the examination rooms. He settled back into his uncomfortable chair and hid behind his copy of
Draco can deny himself no longer; he reaches for the man and pulls him up from his kneeling position, pulling him onto the sofa with him. Draco digs his hand into the dark hair and lets the hood fall back.
“Alright, before we talk about how fucked up you are, and we
treasure, would he actually come across any of the houses or had they all been swallowed up or replaced by the ever-growing Muggle London?
“No, Harry, I’m working with a lot of trauma survivors and most of them are former Death Eaters or affiliated with Slytherin House.”
The library was incredibly dark, every corridor, even the one leading to the front desk was lined with shelves laden down with scrolls. The shelves reached from the floor to a ceiling that was much higher than it should have been considering the basement of the ministry wasn’t built like a cathedral. A warm yellow glow chased away the darkness in one corner and reflected warmly on the white blond hair of a man currently entirely engrossed in his work.
“What have you even?”
Silence greeted these words. Draco straightened and reached out for Harry’s hand.
“You’re so blind to everything. I didn’t want to say anything at first, because you were one of the few who treated me like I was only eccentric and not crazy, when I warned you about the wrackspurts, I know that. I thought that meant you’d be more observant than others. I see I was wrong.”
The memory of what had happened the last time Draco had tried to speak to Harry about a shared future kept him from bringing up the topic himself or even taking their shared intimacy one step further.
“Not much?” Harry is furious now. “How about doing anything! I can’t believe them, they swore to heal those who came to them.”
Now however, there is no way around it, he has to face her and what she might tell him.
Draco began looking haggard and exhausted from lack of sleep. Not even dreamless sleep potion seemed to be able to keep the nightmares at bay anymore. He spent the nights twisting and turning, waking up screaming and shaking, tangled in his bed sheets and unable to go back to sleep.
“They were acceptable, I suppose.”
Draco perused the map Harry had unrolled in his lap. The structure on the page was circular and seemed to wind and twist upwards, like the inside of a conch. It looked a bit like the rune that Draco had manipulated the previous day, when he had revealed the staircase.
“Takes one to know one.”
“But there is no pond on the grounds.”
“I am sorry!”
The smile vanished from Draco’s pale features as quickly as it had appeared.
“What’s going on?”
Draco’s took a firm hold of Harry’s erection and started pulling him off in time with his thrusts. Harry could feel his orgasm approaching. It started in the balls of his feet and rushed through him like lightening, his muscles tightened and warmth pooled in his belly before his release burst out of him, coating his abdomen in thick strings of pearly white liquid.
“They always do, Darling. It’s not like it bothered you before.”
“So, Potter—“
Draco took the folded piece of parchment and read it carefully.
“You mean, if and when it suits them,” Harry teased.
“So you don’t forget to whom you belong,” He whispered against Draco’s lips, before releasing him and helping to drape the cloak over him, making sure nothing showed.
Harry’s face fell, making Draco immediately regret his harsh words. If there was one thing he couldn’t deal with right now, it was Potter’s disappointment in him. Not after what had happened in the court room.
To test his theory, he broke the kiss and pulled away, or rather, he tried to and Harry followed him so quickly in his desperate attempt to continue the kiss that the experiment failed, proving his theory correct.
“That’s it, just like that.”
“No, not a singled moment. I only wish I had been able to remember before today.”
“Sweetie, are you alright?” Her voice was closer now and he felt something akin to relief as he realised that she would spot him and help him soon.
“Are you sure Mr. Malfoy?” The mediwizard asked dubiously.
Draco indicated Potter’s wand and then his wrists and repeated what he’d said before.
“Malfoy, I should’ve expected to find you here,” Granger said.
"Don't worry, we're almost there," Harry shouted from the front and Draco squeezed him in thanks. And that right there was why Draco couldn’t say no. Harry cared and was willing to put up with almost anything from and for the people he loved and inspired the same in them. While Ron and Draco would probably never be friends, both of them always put in an effort to at least politely discuss the weather and if they couldn’t agree on that, Molly’s fabulous cooking was usually the safest topic that they could agree on. All the same, Draco was glad that it had been Hermione and not Ron who had been witness to his plight. The mocking he would receive otherwise would commence soon enough and considering Ron’s incredible stamina for such things would probably be regaled every family Christmas until Draco’s hair disappeared due to natural reasons. He wasn’t really looking forward to it. Better to keep a low profile, if necessary, forever.
The man’s hands were rather large and looked too callused to always have been the hands of a watchmaker. Although, who knew, maybe watch-making was more like manual labour than Draco had anticipated. His eyes wandered slowly upwards, following the curve of the mans jaw, coming to rest on a shock of messy black hair that was held back by one of the weirdest contraptions Draco had ever seen. It was something that looked like a pair of miniature telescopes attached to a headband of some description, most likely it contained layer upon layer of magnifying lenses.
“Oh seriously, Potter, can’t you even eat properly?” Draco asked and before he knew what he was doing, Draco was brushing a drop of chocolate from the corner of Harry’s mouth and licking it off his own finger. Harry stared at him in shock or something else that Draco couldn’t quite put a name to.
The Ministry was deserted this early in the morning but for over-eager secretaries and assistants hoping for a promotion or to replace their superiors. Draco was neither of those. Avoiding yet another wizard balancing a tray of take-away coffee cups and a pile of what probably was top secret correspondence, he ducked into a corridor leading to the dark shelf-lined corridors of the ministry’s Magical Blueprint and Building Planning Library.
“Whatever it is, it’ll be okay, I promise.” Potter whispered and then spoke no more.
“Sorry it took me so long, things have been very busy.” Harry felt uncomfortable and when Mrs. Malfoy only nodded in response, he felt compelled to ask. “May I ask why you wanted to see me?”
Harry swallowed and looked away, his body speaking clearly of his wish to be anywhere but here. That more than anything convinced Draco to take the one step forward that brought him close enough to touch. He reached up embracing Harry’s neck with his hand. Draco’s thumb traced gentle lines across Harry’s cheek while he spoke.
His hands were in Harry’s hair, tilting his head this way and that, so he could easily control their kiss and explore Harry’s mouth at will. Draco enjoyed the feeling of Harry’s hands on his buttocks, where they’d slid into his trousers and pants, kneading and pinching and pulling their crotches even closer together. Their shared breath left their bodies in ragged gasps and Draco could tell that Harry was close. Reaching behind him he removed Harry’s hands from his pants and stood up, smiling wickedly at the disappointment he saw on Harry’s face.
Whatever that thing was between them, it wasn’t friendship that much had become painfully obvious. It was much too awkward for that and much too laden with hidden meanings and glances. Maybe it was a remainder of their school years and their rivalry, he couldn’t know for sure, but somehow that assumption felt wrong. There was something else, something that had stood between them for too long and neither of them seemed to be able to identify or talk about it. The proverbial elephant in the room that was what it was, but Draco had no idea how to fix it.
Draco’s wand pointed at the centre of the fountain and caused most of the map to vanish, now there was only one large blue orb hovering just above the pillar. The planet was mostly covered in water with very small landmasses.
“Maybe the pages are just enchanted so only Malfoys can read them.” Draco added, not quite believing his own words. Why hadn’t the diary been available to his mother then, when she had searched his room? I didn’t make any sense.
Draco blushed furiously.
Mrs. Malfoy sent several requests for progress reports apparently expecting results over night. Harry had felt increasingly uncomfortable with the arrangement Mrs. Malfoy had forced him into. While he had mostly got over the way that Draco had been returned to his life and had ceased to worry about something like that happening again, since Draco barely left the house anymore, spying on him and lying to him became more and more difficult with every passing day. It was especially trying since Harry had so far been unable to discover any evidence on what the dark object that Draco’s mother insisted existed could possibly be.
Draco’s first impulse which he barely managed to resist, was to reach out and wake Harry. Instead he lay down on the bed, facing Harry and gently brushing an errant strand of dark hair out of his face. As if triggered by the motion, Harry suddenly moved closer, his hands still clutching the jumper and buried his face in Draco’s chest. This time Draco couldn’t resist reaching out an arm and pulling him closer. He pressed a soft kiss to the crown of Harry’s head and then just held him close, not wanting to disturb his sleep.
“Do you truly think that you do not deserve to be saved?”
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“I’m afraid this is not a curse I’ve ever encountered before. I’ve dealt with partial hair loss or even hair replacements before. And believe me, Draco, be glad you didn’t get hit with the Medusa Curse, genital hair snakes are not as fun as they sound. Anyway, I’m afraid we’ll have to do more tests. I’d ask for a sample of your hair, but as that is impossible, I took several samples of your magical aura and will look for anomalies there.”
“Malfoy, stop it!” he hissed. Harry felt angry and aroused at the same time. Looking at Malfoy his lips red and plump from their earlier snogging and his eyes blown wide by lust and what most likely was the drug still coursing through his system didn’t make the feelings abate in the slightest. Malfoy was leaning forward as far as Harry’s hold on his wrists would allow and tried to kiss Harry only succeeding in brushing Harry’s nose with his own as Harry pulled away.
“I have no idea, I only just woke up myself. It’s still dark outside though.”
“Hold him down, would you?”
Harry didn’t know and by the time the sun rose behind a thick cover of grey cloud that turned the sky into something akin to the stony lid of a tomb threatening to crush him, Harry hadn’t found a solution. All he knew was that it was already too late for him. He craved Draco and his company, had done so ever since he found out how perfectly they fit together and he realised that whatever torture his mind could come up with to stop him, Harry still wouldn’t be able to stay away.
At first Harry had thought he followed him to make sure that Draco wouldn’t harm himself, now he knew better. He simply wanted to see the blond. At dusk in the park, Harry would gaze at Draco from underneath his cloak, watch the troubled expression on his face and long to reach out to touch him and tell him that things would be okay someday soon, to have more patience and hope.
“Merlin, Harry, he was a scared boy, just like you! You can’t make him pay penance for the rest of his life. He has a right to life away from all that horror, just like everyone else. No matter on which side or however misguided they were. He’s a victim as much as you and I. For someone who has received so much compassion from everyone in the wizarding world, you sure as hell can’t seem to show any.”
The thought of just how much Draco meant to him was what finally drove him out of the bed they’d shared for what had been left of the night. He was terrified of the strength of the emotion running through him. He wasn’t ready to name it yet, let alone come to terms with it.
“Are you sure?” Draco’s voice was shaking as he spoke.
Sitting in his living room, Harry tried to come up with a plan of what to do next. The dream hadn’t been a dream, but a memory. The voice had sounded familiar, even though Harry didn’t remember the face belonging to it. Even now trying to remember the voice made it difficult to place, because as he did, Harry was losing pieces of himself, feeling his memories drift away, like wisps of smoke.
“Do you normally… no wait, how much of that Firewhiskey have you had?”
“Not ‘were’ Draco, am, if you would only let me. Actually…”
He listened for Draco’s gentle breathing as he walked past his room. Filled with a sudden panic when he realised that Draco wasn’t there, he began searching the entire house, checking every floor and every room and when he couldn’t find him, he made his way out onto the patio. Maybe they had woken Draco and he decided to take an early morning stroll through the garden.
“The Sorting Hat must have made a mistake.”
Ginny was due to arrive at Grimmauld Place any day now. She’d completed her training and was currently taking some well deserved time off with one of her team mates. Things would go back to normal soon, he was sure of it. Once Ginny moved back in with him, he would get over his infatuation and live the life he was meant to. He would set Draco free, no matter how much it hurt him. It was better for them both.
Hermione and Luna had both been right. He was an idiot and he acted impulsively and without concern of what his actions meant for everyone else.
“Let me see that,” Draco said and reached for the diary. He breathed more freely when Pyxis’ familiar hand covered every single page in front of him. For a moment he had been worried. Draco suddenly became aware of a hand on his shoulder, shaking him.
Will the man make a move tonight, Draco wonders. Will tonight be the night that he ceases to be a silent watcher? Will this finally be the time that he comes to collect what’s rightfully his? Draco has no answer to these questions, so he just stands there in silence, blocking out the murmured words in the background.
“Oliver is back from his stint in Germany and Percy is bringing him along.”
Parkinson opens up then and tells Harry about situations where only the fact that she’d had protective charms woven into her clothing had stopped assaults from taking place. How men felt entitled to her and her body, because she was a Slytherin bitch, whore, cunt. Tells him how she had stopped leaving the house altogether for anything but the weekly grocery run before she met Hermione. Not like she had been able to find a job, even if she’d wanted to. On one of those runs she’d met Hermione who had stepped in when a witch had spat at Parkinson, telling her she wished Parkinson killed herself for her sins. Yelling that she should take responsibility for what Voldemort and his followers had done.
“Malfoy and Potter? I believe so.”
“Are you ready?”
“Nothing,” Draco lied.
Draco sat propped up against the headrest of his bed, sipping the tea he had had Holly deliver and chewing on one of his favourite ginger biscuits. Crumbs be damned. The diary lay on his crossed legs and it wasn’t long before the tea grew cold and the biscuit lay forgotten on the dusty wooden box that Draco had place on his nightstand.
“Easy there, Potter, I thought we weren’t going to fight? Whatever has that poor kitchen table done to you?”
“So you see, I don’t even know how you got here. I just made sure nothing happened to you.”
“You know very well you aren’t, because unlike you, my
With his mind made up, Harry straightens up, moves just outside the wards protecting Malfoy Manor and apparates back to his flat. He has work to do.
“Yes, absolutely. Harry, are you coming?”
“Listen, Harry, I’m sorry. I think we got off on the wrong foot today. I really appreciate that you took me out, even though I stood you up a second time. You’re right, if you’d stood me up, I might not have bothered to seek you out and I’m grateful that you did. Why don’t we go and find a café for now and then come back here a bit later and then maybe you can show me what you love about this place so much, alright?”
“Mr. Potter, I know my son, there is something wrong with him. Don’t you sense it too?”
The night air was cold, the first signs of frost showing under the starlit sky. For a while he flew aimlessly and when he couldn’t bear the leisurely pace any longer, he flew faster and faster, not even caring where he was headed, the feeling of the cold wind biting into his cheeks and the rush of air by his ears as he chased through the night the only thing that mattered. He couldn’t let himself feel the loss. He knew he would fall apart if he did. The race was the only thing that had any meaning because it was taking him further and further away from his sorrow.
“Fuck you.”
“Right, former Death Eaters,” Harry barely resists making air quotes but only because he knows it would get in the way of getting the information he needs out of Luna. “Don’t you think it’s odd that Malfoy’s is the only report? Basic statistics should reveal more crimes involving Death Eaters or former Death Eaters, but there is nothing after the war except for what relates to the war crime trials after Voldemort’s death. Considering that we have a database of Death Eaters, their connections as well as of Voldemort sympathisers and their social circles, more of them should show up. Even if only as bystanders or witnesses in cases, but there is nothing.”
“Can’t say I do, however your behaviour does hint at some level of withdrawal, it’s only been what four hours since you last had your hands all over me?” Draco said, trying for nonchalance but panting so hard he completely ruined his delivery.
Draco’s parents had left a while ago and still there was no sign of the Saviour’s return. It amused Draco that Harry had managed to defeat the Dark Lord almost single-handedly, but was terrified of his parents.
“Explain yourself right now, before I hex you into tomorrow.”
The diary wasn’t under the bed or hidden between his sheets, it wasn’t stuck between the bed and the mattress or the bed and the wall either. It was in fact nowhere to be found. He grew frantic in his search, but even taking his entire room apart, much less gentle than whoever had been there first didn’t yield any results.
They were both grinning by now. Potter, no Harry, Draco corrected himself, gave his hand one last squeeze before releasing it.
Something must have happened to make his family remove Pyxis so completely from their lives that only this diary which Pyxis himself had hidden away as well as the other belongings in his room remained behind. Where history was concerned, Pyxis had never existed. Draco had his suspicions as to why his ancestors had refused to acknowledge their son and had removed him as punishment.
“What do you want Potter?”
“Harry, I am real.” Draco said, reaching out and caressing Harry’s cheek. A small smile stole across his features as Harry pressed his cheek back into the palm of his hand.
Draco tried to keep his voice neutral as he put his quill down and addressed Harry Potter.
Feeling suddenly shy he started to get up and mumbled: “I’ll clean them up right away, let me just go fetch a broom.”
Draco thrust into him a few more times, while Harry clung to him, as if he was scared he might fall apart if he ever let go, before he came with a shout of his own that was almost entirely swallowed by Harry’s mouth.
“Hoping to catch me wanking, weren’t you.”
Sudden fear punched through him. Harry couldn't breathe. Something else had happened, something terrible, something he couldn’t remember, all he knew was that he had to get away. Harry was half out of his armchair, when his therapist’s words finally managed to penetrate the fog of panic.
“Harry!” Draco tried to interrupt, but the other man just went on hopelessness evident in his voice.
This was getting stranger by the minute. Draco must have somehow fallen asleep on the shell and broken it. Which in itself didn’t make any sense whatsoever, because the shell was so hard that the odds of him getting bruises and possibly breaking a rib while lying on it seemed much higher than the shell breaking under his weight. Though none of that explained where the arm around his waist came from. Draco was a bit scared of what he would find if he turned around.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
Making sure Potter had left before returning to his desk, Draco was too agitated by what had happened to be able to concentrate on work. His hand repeatedly snuck into his pocket, making sure the phial was still there, as if its mere existence somehow anchored him to this world. He would have called it a day and gone home early if his fear of the other wizards didn’t keep him in his office every day till long after everyone else had gone home, just to make sure he would get back safely.
“Sleepy now. Take me to bed, Harry,” Malfoy demanded.
“Always remember Ferret, while Harry is gone, I supervise you, if I tell him you disobeyed one of his direct orders, it won’t be me who’s going to Azkaban will it? Now say ‘I apologise for my insolence Auror Weasley’ and go do your work.”
“Mother, let me return the question, are you sure
He magnified the planet again, this time on the northern hemisphere and right there at the coast where they were a bright blue light was flickering on and off.
“Draco, I…” Harry began, wanting to say he was sorry, sorry for messing everything up, for his cowardice and for not standing up for Draco when it’d mattered.
He covered his ears with his hands, trying to block out the sounds. Knowing that there were strangers in his home, invading it without a sense of propriety or thought for the people whose home they were destroying brought Draco back to an even darker time in his life. Perhaps he did deserve it all.
Draco remembered eating it and then trying to leave the house. Last night had really been full of ups and downs.
Harry carefully reached up, taking a hold of the shoulder he had squeezed so hard the night before. He shook him gently.
“Draco?”
“Let me get my wand,” Draco said and got up.
Draco shook his head.
”Oh but you are,
Somehow everything had gone wrong far quicker than anyone, least of all him, could have anticipated. He’d known that it had been a bad idea to give in to his attraction to the Saviour of the Wizarding World, but he just couldn’t help himself – Not when he had been allowed to see the desperation and the need that was driving Harry every waking moment. He’d been allowed a peek at the inner vulnerability and loneliness lurking just under the cover of the cool detachment he presented to the world at large. Who could have resisted being part of something so important? Draco hadn’t been able to and was now paying the price.
“Mistress, is wanting to know why Master Draco aren’t attending tea like he promised,” she asked, pulling her ears and obviously uncomfortable.
Instead of a reply, Harry pulled him into another passionate kiss.
“What’s impossible?” he asked smiling.
“Don’t get your frilly pink knickers in a twist Weaselby! I’ll be right over.”
“I came to speak to Draco and give him this,” Harry said, indicating the parcel in his hand.
Draco relented, something in the quiet despair of Potter’s voice getting under his skin.
Ginny had fallen up the three tiny innocent looking front steps of their home. This had happened many times in the past, when they were still moving in and usually ended with either of them cursing the ‘stupid stairs’ and vowing to get them fixed soon. They had never got around to it.
Draco was speechless for a moment. He hadn’t expected this. “The voice inside my head, it was you, wasn’t it?” He asked.
“I bet I could make you come…hmmmm… just from watching me fuck myself on my…ah… fingers!” Draco was so very close himself, he had to force himself to slow down.
“What do you want from him Potter? Are you bored? Is that it? Haven’t you fucked with his head enough already? I can’t even get him to leave the fucking house.” Her tone was accusatory.
“Harry,” Ginny says and reaches through the flames but stops before she can touch his forearm. “You know very well that it doesn’t make mistakes.”
Harry zipped up when he was done and washed his hands. He had to tell Ron, tell him something important, something about some poor fucker who was going to regret having come out of the war unscathed.
“I am sorry. Look, I just… I don’t know what to feel. I know I should dance with joy and be grateful fate spared me, but I’d be lying if I said I felt anything even remotely like that.”
Draco could see Potter’s back shake with suppressed laughter as he made to follow him. He was surprised to find that they didn’t head for the wing he knew all the examination rooms and the waiting area were located in, but rather went into the opposite direction into what he imagined your average Muggle optician shop looked like.  Potter led him into a large booth situated near the back of the shop.
Harry let himself sink into the plush armchair and closed his eyes. He felt his limbs getting heavier and heavier with every breath he took.
Over the next several weeks Harry forgot about the letter. Spending time with Draco was both exhilarating and exhausting. Harry had convinced himself that if things worked out the way he hoped he would never have to tell Draco how close of a call it had been that night. The guilt was eating away at Harry but he reasoned that he had to find the right moment to tell Draco and if that moment never came, Harry wasn’t to blame for it.
When he turned around with scroll in hand, Potter was right in front of him, a look of longing on his face. Draco hadn’t noticed how close Potter had stood, while he himself reached for the scroll. Before Draco could move away, Potter crowded him into the shelves, pressing his body flush against him and inhaling his scent.
Malfoy is leaning against the window frame, the light of the sun casting his face into shadow and making it hard for Harry to read his expression.
“On the topic of awkward, Potter. Do you suppose we could go and find my clothes before long? As comfortable as your bathrobe is, I’d rather not go home wearing only that.”
He started to reach for his prick, but Draco slapped his hand away. There was a strange glint in his eyes that scared Harry for a moment, but then Draco was kissing him, tracing the seam of his lips with his tongue and then demanding entrance. Harry could only moan helplessly as his mouth was plundered. Draco was taking charge and he was able to let himself go just a little bit more. Even though he was familiar with most of the steps he had someone to guide him through this uncharted territory, someone who wouldn’t hurt him.
Nothing happens for more than a week, the report they had filed stays put, it’s read by several different Aurors and personal. Harry has planted a bug designed by Hermione to monitor who accesses their report and what is being said in its vicinity. He’d tested it with the help of Ron and Seamus who ostensibly had looked at the report in connection with a mugging but had then disregarded the witness statement made by Millicent as unreliable and returned the report. Another two Aurors read the report but discarded it as the case not being high profile enough to advance their career. Quote: Nobody cares about what happened to some Death Eater bird. Then there was Dennis Creevey who while he didn’t say anything spent quite a while with the document but left it where it was.
“And why would you trust my judgement, Potter? You’ve made it fairly clear, what you think of my presence here, that night at the pub.”
“I… may I come in Harry?” Stay calm and stick with the plan he told himself, trying to not to show just how much Harry’s coldness was affecting him.
It was hunger that drove Draco to leave his room and go downstairs in search of food. The table in the dining room was set for three two of which were already seated. Draco was about to turn around again and leave, when he saw whom his mother had chosen for company.
Several weeks had passed and Draco was running out of excuses to refuse to go and see Harry. Draco was avoiding him, because it still hurt to know that none of what Harry had shown him, had been real. Whatever was between him and Harry was some construct his mother and Harry had thought up for whatever reason. It didn’t matter how much he loved and trusted his mother, he couldn’t trust her in this.
“Apparently. What’s it to you?”
He stopped in front of Draco’s flat and thought about what he was about to do. If his gut instinct was wrong, he’d be breaking and entering. His Auror career would be over because Draco would never agree to keep this quiet. Worry gnawed at him because no noise came from within the flat. Before he could change his mind, he started to dismantle the wards. The feat done, he unlocked the door and slipped inside the unfamiliar flat.
Harry tried not to think about why Draco’s mother had written to him. It seemed out of character for her to invite him over, even though she must know by now that Harry and Draco had become friends. Still, he was slightly wary about her intentions seeing how he still owed her a life debt and she didn’t seem like the kind of person that would simply forget about something like that.
Harry awakes to an agitatedly whispered conversation. The noise makes him sit up abruptly and the stabbing pain punching through his head makes him fall back into the chair just as fast.
He ran his hands along Draco’s bare chest and sighed at the feeling of the warm smooth skin all there for him to touch. Draco smoothed back Harry’s bed hair and smiled when Harry in turn ran his fingers through Draco’s hair.
“Hello Granger, long time no see. I read life has been treating you well, head of your own research department and everything,” Draco said, completely ignoring Potter, who only grinned harder at that.
Draco was impressed despite himself. He found himself leaning over, studying his watch with interest and leaning quite close to Potter. He reached out and touched the lid where Potter had indicated, his heart racing and his hand shaking as he accidentally brushed against Potter’s warm skin. Potter grabbed Draco’s hand and the watch and cast a quick spell on them, making Draco’s skin tingled and feel like he had been burned where Potter touched him, even after his hand had been released.
“Potter, what the hell do you think you’re doing?”
“I’ve sent him a couple of letters, but he just sent them back unopened. Oh God Pansy, I don’t know what to do anymore…” His voice broke.
When his sleep wasn’t plagued by nightmares he lay awake thinking about who could have attacked him and why. Who would leave him so much less than human, so lonely, when even before he had already been isolated? Sure, he had never needed to work for a living before, but maybe he would have liked to have the opportunity to make his own fortune, to give a new meaning to his family name, one that was removed from its dark past. That chance like so many others had been snatched from him. The curse had left him less than wizard kind, less than human, unable to cast or even be near magic without suffering constant pain. But maybe he deserved it, maybe it was some kind of karmic retribution for what he had done during the war, or maybe he and his family had caused so much pain that this was the price he finally had to pay for allowing himself to be blinded and mislead by a genocidal madman.
“I went for a walk, it was too warm in my room and I figured a bit of fresh air would do me some good and as I cannot leave the premises without you…”
Draco gasped out loud as it all came back to him. The dark presence pursuing him and a pale light calling him forwards, he recalled almost drowning. And then he recalled the memories of a night he had forgotten.
Draco is still steadily moving backwards on hands and arse along the rim of the pond, trying desperately to get more distance between himself and that thing.
Malfoy was looking at his folder and using his wand to point at different boulders that were mostly hidden behind the dancing stalks. He seemed to follow a path that only he could see, stopping for no apparent reasons sometimes only to suddenly continue in a completely different direction.
Another nod.
Draco huffed and tried to disentangle himself from Harry’s embrace, not getting far as Harry’s arms immediately tightened around him. And if he was honest with himself, he hadn’t really been trying all that hard.
“It’s alright, Granger, I’ll send him back to you in a day or two. In one piece even, but no promises, mind,” Draco said nonchalantly sauntering from the room with Harry at his side. Or as close to sauntering as was possible with a giggling maniac clinging to him with his vicelike arms.
Maybe the book was charmed in some way, unplottable, like some wizarding homes only in this case it was an object that simply couldn’t be found by magic or unless the person looking for it already knew where it was. But Draco didn’t know. He had hidden the book under his pillow right after he had stormed into his room to change and it should have been there when he returned. He thought about searching his mother’s rooms, but thinking about what would happen if she ever found out terrified him too much to go for that option just yet.
Their dinner conversation returned to every day matters, they spent time talking about Quidditch and Merlin help him the weather. It felt like they were both trying too hard to
No reaction.
“You’re enjoying this far too much. I’m starting to think all there is to you is an overdose of snark and attitude.”
Draco twisted the beanie in his hands and refused to look at her.
. My outing, my rules,” Harry drawled imitating a much younger Draco. “Unless…”
“Genetic predisposition?”
“Pardon, Holly, what did you say?”
The person who opens the door and beckons him inside is none other than Millicent Bulstrode. What exactly is going on here?
Harry is surprised to see tears spring up in Malfoy’s eyes. Surely that is impossible.
“Are you comfortable?”
Harry ends up face down on the chaise lounge, his clothes in tatters and moaning into the cushions when Draco pushes into him from behind. Their coupling is anything but gentle or loving, it’s frantic and forceful but to Harry it feels perfect. It’s something he didn’t know he wanted but exactly what he needed. Draco’s hands are in his hair, are caressing his shoulders and back. They reach around, one hand spreading possessively across his abdomen while the other holds onto his throat.
Draco was surprised when strong arms wrapped themselves around him from behind preventing him from leaving the bed. Warm lips pressed against his neck and then followed its line until they reached the shell of his ear.
But Draco can’t seem to stop, he turns the key and the lock springs open with a loud crack. The key and the lock come apart in his hands, as if the rust from the door had infected them. The door itself begins to melt away and as Draco looks over his shoulder he can see that in the meantime the puddle has grown to the size of an ocean and he can barely make out the small lone dark clad figure on its distant shore.
“Alright, but give me a moment to turn off the lights and fetch my things. I’ll be right back.”
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“I’m not sure that’s necessarily a bad thing. If they decide your rehabilitation was a success you might actually end up with a job offer and financial support until you are settled in wherever it is you choose to go after this. Have you given any thought to that yet?”
“You are hurting me Potter. I sure hope you treat your prisoners better than your charges…” Draco could feel his lips curl into a sneer.
“I have even asked your mother for permission and I’ve bought a ring.”
Harry felt gobsmacked. Adding this to his mounting guilt of still not having come clean to Draco made their becoming friends or whatever it was that they were headed toward even harder. Harry knew that he was already lying to himself where Draco was concerned. The little time he had spent with the man and most of all the still vivid memories of that night told him that the last thing he wanted from Draco was friendship.
Draco manipulated another part of the fountain. The blue globe disappeared, where it had been was now something Harry had seen many times before. He pointed upward.
He’d stood in front of the mirror for the last hour, choosing and discarding more than a dozen outfits and getting increasingly frustrated with his inability to decide on any one set of robes. Finally he decided on a set of dark robes with a silver and green trim that would go well with Harry’s eyes and that were loose around his crotch, in case he had another inappropriate reaction and needed to hide it. He refused to admit to himself that he was both hoping for and dreading said reaction.
“Get up you lazy bugger! Time to leave! Your legs are perfectly okay, you are just hammered beyond reason.”
“Not really, if Molly knows, my mother knows and I know that woman, Harry, if she thinks you didn’t do this right, she might just withdraw her permission and while we don’t necessarily need it, I’d rather not suffer another curse on top of this one, or have you get a matching one.”
Draco’s voice was oddly gentle as he spoke.
Time passed and the dripping sound of the water mocked his parched lips and throat from afar. Originally, he had tried to count to find out how long he was here, only guessing at the periods he had spent unconscious. Harry had been hungry at some point, but even that feeling had long since passed.
“But, Harry…” Draco tried beseechingly.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
In contrast to the waiting area the examination room was furnished with taste, it was rather larger than expected and half of it was lined with white cupboards and counters that reminded Draco of a kitchen. The charmed windows created the impression of filtering in sunlight despite the rain that could be heard spattering against them from the outside. Everything seemed bright, crisp and pristine; there was a sectioned-off area to the side which was most likely where the test results would be discussed in a more comfortable surrounding.
But if it had been the right thing, why did it hurt so much? He’d let Draco go – had set him free, like he deserved. It was all for the best! Soon his life would be busy with wedding plans, with work and children, and he’d forget about his sins. He would repent for them – with every single day, every single deed he would repent, make it up to Ginny and to his friends and everyone who would let him.
Harry however shakes his head and quickly writes something into the thick coat of dust at their feet.
“So, Draco, how are you getting on with this?”
He lit a candle to see by and began examining the shell closely, driven by a kind of morbid fascination. How could something so innocent looking have made him feel so much pain? Draco checked the shell for curses but couldn’t find anything wrong with it. Every spell he tried came up empty; for all intents and purposes this was a completely ordinary conch shell, robbed of its inhabitant but otherwise whole. He sighed. Draco was in no mood to go into the library and read up on what had just happened, so he left the shell were he was, righted the chaos in his room with a flick of his wand and began to slowly change into his pyjama bottoms.
Harry bit Malfoy’s shoulder to hide his whimper and his sharp gasping breaths as Malfoy began to roughly pull him off. By some miracle Harry managed to stay completely quiet as his orgasm barrelled through him. Malfoy looked smug as he pulled his hand out of Harry’s pants and licked Harry’s come off his fingers. Harry couldn’t stay still any longer. He pulled Malfoy into a desperate kiss, barely managing to contain his moans as he tasted himself on Malfoy’s tongue.
“Harry, where have you been? I’ve been looking all over for you. I was worried something had happened.”
Being called an idiot is something Harry is familiar with, how his being an idiot relates to Malfoy escapes him though. Luna goes on as if his input isn’t a necessary part of this scolding.
“Potter, what the fuck did you do?” Malfoy hissed, waking Harry faster than a bucket of ice water to the face would have done.
So he had been right. Harry nodded.
The restaurant was small with only a dozen low tables situated in a cosy room. It was nothing like Draco had expected and far more welcoming than he could have anticipated. At the door they were greeted by the owner who shook first Harry’s and then Draco’s hand and showed them to their table. Harry took Draco’s coat and hung it on a series of small hooks that served as the restaurant’s cloak room. By the time he had returned, the owner had lit the candle in the centre of the table and placed a bottle of water and two glasses in front of their places. Before long a basket of home-made bread and an assortment of oils and vinegars appeared before them. Looking for a menu turned out to be futile. At Draco’s confused look Harry smiled and then gestured for him to follow.
His sleep that night was uneasy, he was plagued by dreams about the deep sea. In his dreams, the lighthouse was underwater and upside down. Strangers hovered outside the windows and pressed their faces against the window, staring at him as if he was an interesting exhibit. Their face were flat and reptilian looking, their noses two shallow slits while their eyes were huge and black. Slowly they began to knock against the windows, like a child would against the glass of a fish tank. The noise grew louder and louder, the pace ever increasing. Harry’s heart was keeping time with the knocking, almost beating out of his chest in fear. It wasn’t long before the first cracks appeared in the glass. The faces began to grin, their tiny teeth grey and sharp. Harry was frozen in his bed, unable to move or scream. A dark shape was bending over him, while the creatures kept looking in. It reached for him, its dark eyes glittering with malice and greed. Its fingers were long and thin with long yellowed nails at the end. It caressed Harry’s face almost gently and somehow he knew that it was pleased it had found him, pleased it had something new to feed on.
“I was thinking, maybe we could go flat-hunting together, you know, to make sure we both like it…”
Harry laughed at that.
“Nothing to concern yourself with Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter was just leaving!” A poignant silence followed these words, as if whoever had uttered them now expected “Mr. Potter” to comply with his wishes. Draco knew better though, this was never going to happen.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
He caught a glance of a sliver of pale paper under his writing desk. Draco had to kneel down on the floor in his expensive designer trousers and cursed his bad luck while he fished for the missive. When he finally freed it, he saw that it was only a couple of scrawled lines.
“Protego Maxima,” they said in unison and Draco let his magic go, feeling it guided by Potter’s. It was as if Potter had got under his skin, was warming him from the inside. It was too close, too intimate and intimidating as hell and yet it wasn’t enough. Part of Draco longed to turn around and capture Potter’s lips in a kiss, finally releasing the pent up tension. When he focused on his wand again, he could see the spell had begun.
“Close enough I guess. I’m glad there is still something of the old Draco Malfoy left.” She winked at him.
When Draco woke up the next morning, he was alone in the room. He looked for Harry inside the lighthouse but hadn’t found him. Draco had assumed Harry went down to the village to go to the shop, but when he took Harry’s Firebolt to follow him, the village had been deserted. And not just deserted. The houses looked as if they had been uninhabited for centuries.  They were nothing more than decaying ruins.
“But the point is that you didn’t.”
Patience wasn’t one of his stronger suits. Harry tended to barge into situations before he knew exactly what was going on. He had got more than his fair share of serious talking-tos, when he had still worked for the Ministry, some even threatening suspension but it hadn’t changed a thing. He could still hear Hermione in her sing-song voice when she was doing something that wasn’t happening fast enough for him, as she went “patience is a virtue”. “Virtue my arse,” he had mumbled, to him it seemed more like a super power.
“Destroyed any interesting curses lately?”
Drifting off back into sleep, Harry knew Draco had asked him something but couldn’t quite remember his answers. When he woke next, Draco was still fast asleep but their sleeping positions had been reversed. Now it was Draco who was cradling him protectively as if, even in his sleep, Draco had known what Harry needed.
Draco immediately recognised Harry’s voice.  But what did he mean, he was helping? Draco didn’t even know that Harry had met his mother after the war and here they were talking about promises and helping and. Oh God, they were talking about him, weren’t they? Why else would Harry be friends with him, would insist that Draco go out and spend time with him. He was nothing but a charity case to Harry and his mother had bullied him into it, was bullying him into it at this very moment on the other side of that very door. Draco took a step back, eyes staring into nothingness as the reality of his situation hit home. He had never been this humiliated in his entire life.
“Of course,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hand and felt that he meant it, completely and utterly.
“I went to the library trying to find you, but you’d already gone to bed. I wanted to apologise for Ron’s behaviour, he’s having a harder time moving on than others…”
“Can you ever forgive me?”
Draco quickly extinguished the light and hid in the shadow behind the door, his face pressed firmly against the small gap between door and frame to try and see what was happening outside in the hall.
“Here drink this,” Draco said after vanishing the sick, pressing a glass of water in Harry’s shaking hands and helping him to take a few sips, before setting it down on the table. He conjured a warm wet cloth and carefully cleaned Harry up. He pulled him close again, rocking him gently back and forth.
He’d grown rather thin, and if not for Pansy’s regular visits, his appearance would have become unkempt and ragged. She forced him to shave, she called in a hairdresser once a month and she made him get dressed properly. She’d once said that as much as she enjoyed looking at his bare chest, she wasn’t going to endure another meal with him anything but impeccably dressed.
Draco straightened up began to walk down the beach in fast strides, beckoning Harry to follow him.
Harry pushed the soaked through sheets off the bed and grabbed his favourite jumper, pulling it over his head and hugged himself tight. It still smelled faintly of Draco’s cologne and it only made Harry miss him more.
Draco’s smile could have lit up the room and Harry was suddenly glad that he had taken the risk and given in to his desires the day before.
She slammed her mug onto the table, as she got up and pointed an accusing finger at him, spilling what was obviously cold tea everywhere in the process, even on the pages of her open book, which Harry now realised actually was the novel he was currently reading.
“The glamour, I mean.”
“Draco, hurry up! Let me through, this is fucking uncomfortable!”
“Scorpius.”
“Don’t think you that you should let him decide whether he wants to speak with you?”
“Whose journal is that supposed to be anyway?”
A shout of terror wakes Draco much later. (What the fuck are you doing in my bed, Malfoy?) But Draco just points out that it is in fact Harry who is in Draco’s bedroom, and that he can stop playing games, the cat is out of the bag, so to speak. When Harry still tries to object, Draco silences him with a kiss and then several, because the saviour of the wizarding world can be a bit thick sometimes. Soon hands find and seek what they are looking for, there are moans of pleasure and almost inaudible promises of future bliss. The duvet is discarded. God is called for several times, so are Merlin and other famous wizards of their time. The entire beautiful thing goes the way it usually does. When the two of them lie sated beside each other, happy and ready to drift back off to sleep, their peace is abruptly shattered by a different horrified scream. But that’s another story.
Harry stared into Draco’s eyes for what seemed like an eternity before taking another unconscious step forward and crowding him into the shelf finally close enough to inhale the glorious scent of Draco’s skin. Cutting off Draco’s protest with his lips, Harry poured everything he’d wanted to express in words, but couldn’t into the kiss. He was desperately trying to recreate all the moments from their shared past in this single kiss. Draco was tense and unresponsive under his onslaught but this only caused Harry to try harder, he had to get through to Draco that he still mattered, that
“You don’t sound all that happy about it to be honest.”
This Christmas Eve is supposed to be like all the others before it, reassuring, warm and reaffirming the feeling of belonging that had become so difficult to find in recent times. Draco knows it is not meant to be. The tree sparkles cheerfully in front of them, mountains of colourful but tastefully wrapped gifts are piled beneath it, but something is missing. His father sits in the large armchair opposite them by the fire, hunched low as if by old age. Draco knows that what is bearing his father down is worry. Worry for Draco and his mother, worry for what might still happen. The trials lie in the past, so does his father’s sentence, but some people still think the Malfoy’s got off too easily. Draco knows his father fears there will be retribution for his sins. His father is still scared that his family will have to pay the price for his own misguided beliefs.
Now and then people walked past the house, but he knew they wouldn’t see him. Misery supposedly loved company, but more often than not, people chose not to see other people’s misery.
As it happened nobody had anything bad to say about their ceremony or wedding picture and if they did, neither Draco nor Harry found out, because nobody they knew subscribed to the Daily Prophet anymore and the article in the Quibbler was as expected bizarre but also strangely uplifting.
And they are back on known terrain. Harry finds himself almost picking up the fight. But he’s so tired, tired of everything, of fighting, of having to live up to expectations, of loneliness.
“What? No! I didn’t hear anything.” Pansy looked scandalised. They both listened intently, but no further sound was forthcoming.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
Draco climbed out from under the covers and swung his legs out of the bed. He couldn’t help but smile when his feet encountered the yet again heated floorboards. Harry really did look out for him.
“Loo,” Harry called in reply and stumbled towards his destination. The floor seemed to be ridiculously uneven and Harry had a hard time not stumbling, let alone walking in a straight line.
Like last time in examination room 6 Potter swished his wand and a series of letters appeared out of thin air. Sighing inwardly, Draco could feel his insides knot in anticipation of what was to come next.
“Yeah…”
He had sat at his desk for over an hour now, starting and discarding letters to Draco that included anything from outright accusations of stalking to desperate pleas for him to forgive Harry and come back to him so they could make love.
Before he can make up his mind, he feels water trickling by his feet. It is invisible. In the distance ahead of him where the glow had vanished to, he can hear a roaring sound, like something large and powerful is headed his way. The trickle of water keeps increasing and even though he can’t see it, Draco can still feel it wash over his feet.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“It’s alright, I’ve got nothing but time, I’m still on forced leave, if Hermione is to be believed.”
“I understand your anger Mr. Potter, but you should respect that she is too unwell to receive you at this point. If you come back tomorrow I am sure she’ll be willing to see you then.”
He placed a gentle kiss on Harry’s lips and Harry felt himself melt against Draco, growing ever calmer and more confident with every following kiss. When they had to pause for breath, Harry’s eyes fell on a bundle of rolled up papers in the corner, and he suddenly had an idea.
I am so sorry, please come back
“Yes.”
For now he decided to just keep going as if nothing had changed. He would pay more attention to what Draco said and did and try to do a bit of reconnaissance on the side and if that helped Draco to stay safe, that was just an added bonus.
He woke to a soft warm breeze coming in through the window, caressing his cheek and playing with his hair like Harry used to. The wind carried the scent of elderflowers with it. Another year had gone by unnoticed, because time had ceased to matter. The bittersweet memory of their shared touches still made him sad. But for all that, he couldn’t bring himself to get up and close the window.
“Don’t lie to me!” Harry screamed, waving his wand around agitatedly. It was the opening Malfoy had been looking for, because he disarmed Harry and pushed him against the wall.
“Potter, what…” but Draco’s words were cut off by Potter’s lips on his. Potter’s tongue demanding entrance as Draco tried to break free. He pushed Potter away more harshly than he had intended, making him crash into the shelves on the other side of the small corridor, causing an avalanche of scrolls to tumble down on top of him. Wiping his mouth with the back of his hand as if disgusted, while the other hand was still clutching the scroll, Draco took a deep breath before he spoke.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“Please Harry, please I want you! Please, will you fuck me?” It wasn’t even a request anymore, it was a need, like the need to breathe.
“Oh you are so going down!”
“Before, when I was” he paused, “when I was asleep, I had some strange dreams.”
Harry tasted of coffee and rain and something uniquely Harry. Parting with his reserve, Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth with abandon. He never wanted this moment to end. The kisses went on for a long time and Draco was ready to shed the last shreds of his dignity and ask Harry to shag him right then and there in the rain against the convenient wall of an alleyway, when something changed.
“No, depending on their power, touch is painful too, especially when I’m wearing the glamour.”
Before he knew it the arms around him had disappeared and there was no sign of Harry. For a moment Draco wondered whether he had hallucinated the entire episode. His fingers reached for his lips which still tingled slightly and were still wet from Harry’s.
Harry sees Luna’s fists clenched at her side; not punching him again appears to be a conscious effort on her part.
Seeing the two of them together makes him long for Draco, but without having solved who is behind everything he feels like he doesn’t deserve to attempt and righten things between them just yet. He needs something concrete, something that’ll not only make Draco listen to his apologies but will make him forgive Harry.
“Seriously, you can’t expect me to leave the house without at least my shoes on.”
“Well, finally. What took you so long?” Malfoy broke off, giving him a once over. “You look like shit, Potter. What happened?”
Forcing his erratic thoughts under control, he took a step forward, in an attempt to bridge the chasm he felt opening up between them. As Draco reached out for Harry, he took a step back, colliding with a bookshelf. Draco told himself that Harry shying away from his touch didn’t sting. Unable to let it go, he stepped closer yet again, not touching yet, but crowding Harry’s personal space nonetheless.
The grounds around him were covered in snow and he jumped from one foot to the other to keep warm, rubbing his hands and attempting to blow life back into them. He really should have brought gloves but had had other things on his mind than the cold when it was time to leave.
“Not really, I don’t know why he was there yet, he wouldn’t tell me. But I think there was something else going on. I think we should continue.”
Before they could go back to what they had been doing, Harry became aware of something else.
“Do what?”
Harry pulled himself together and looked at where Draco was pointing. Harry could feel his eyebrows climb up into his fringe at the sight in front of him. Draco had tipped his wand against different parts of the rune and it had actually begun to swirl. The centre of it became larger and darker and eventually resolved itself into a tunnel mouth with a set of stairs leading downward.
“Have a seat Mr Potter.”
“With the measurements I’ve taken and the other data I’ve collected it should only take us a little over a week to come up with viable lenses for your condition. Why don’t you drink your tea and then make an appointment at the reception desk, while I finish up here?” Potter suggested.
When he took the potion that night, he didn’t even check what colour the hair in his hand was before swallowing down potion and hair in one smooth gulp.
“Can I come in?” he asks, despite the evidence to the contrary, especially when there’s a noise behind the half closed door. Luna is obviously waving her hand in a frantic manner at whoever made it. Hot jealousy shoots through Harry when he realises it could be Draco, who made her look freshly fucked. He has no claim on Draco whatsoever, he knows this, but it still bothers him so much that he wants to push the door open and see for himself.
Draco had ordered the house elves to take care of the rose garden he had planted, because nothing in the world would make him enter it again. The one time he had tried, such intense emotions and memories had flooded his mind as he smelt the roses and lavender, that he had fallen to pieces. He had fled inside, locking himself in his room and drawing the curtains to shut out light and scent, vowing to never set foot into the garden again.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“No, seriously, don’t you have anything better to do, like make babies and conform to everyone’s expectations of what our Hero-Boy should be like?” Draco tried again, something inside him wanting to pick a fight.
Draco brought up the planet in front of them. Earth was easily recognisable now with its continents and large oceans.
“Do you really think Weasley would have let that happen?”
“I don’t know, Potter,” Draco drawled stretching out the “Potter” nervous and trying for playfulness but probably failing utterly. “I could grovel a bit and then we could reschedule?”
Malfoy still hadn’t moved by the time Harry was only a few feet away. He looked almost frozen. In the dim light Harry could barely make out that Malfoy’s eyes were open, his open coat flapping in the wind. Wasn’t he cold?
“Oh, but I am.”
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
Harry grinned and Draco only shrugged in a “what can you do” sort of way.
“You’re pulling my leg,” Harry said, staring at a suspiciously straight-faced Draco.
“No, but whatever happened to you last night, the diary is part of it. I just had to shake you for a full two minutes before you even knew I was here.”
“My scans indicate that that is not entirely accurate Mr Potter. Can you please specify? This is important, this part of your memories shows an especially strong emotional reaction.”
Harry lets go and Draco hisses, before immediately reaching for Harry’s hand again, but nothing seems to change, he touches Harry’s forearm, his neck and cheek and nothing seems to help. Draco’s breaths are coming in small painful huffs and his unoccupied hand is clutching the armrest as if his life depends on it. Harry decides he has seen enough and reaches for Draco again. The tense lines in Draco’s forehead immediately lessen.
“Why do you want to know?” Draco had almost given up on an answer to his question by the time Harry finally spoke.
“Where’s your wand?”
“Harry, you are sitting down!”
Apparently accepting that Draco wasn’t going to answer his question any time soon, Draco expected Potter to get up and move back to his chair. He was completely unprepared for what came next. The mattress gave way even more as Potter climbed into bed with him again, wrapping his arms around Draco and nuzzling his neck gently from behind. The feeling of being protectively cradled against Potter’s warm chest was incredible and overwhelming at the same time.
The first time Draco had become aware of someone standing by the gate and watching him was after getting ready for bed and taking one last look out before closing the curtains. The thick fabric had felt wonderful in his hands as he drew them close, letting his gaze wander across the snow covered gardens. Draco remembered how this view used to excite him when he was little. He would try to force himself to fall asleep as quickly as possible so it would be morning soon. Before his minds eye he could see the frozen pond, see his father’s laughing face as he taught Draco to ice skate, wand drawn for a quick cushioning charm, should Draco lose his balance. He couldn’t help but smile at the memory, but the smile grew bitter too quickly. Those days were gone. His father hadn’t smiled even once since the Dark Lord had moved into his home and hadn’t smiled at his son for even longer.
“Potter, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone freak out over a hangover potion as much as you did just now...” a sardonic voice says. Harry turns towards the sound, he knows that voice.
“Draco.” Harry whispered as if surprised by the fact that he was really here with him.
Harry talked for what felt like hours. He talked about the time when Ginny lost the baby and of his guilt, he talked of what happened between him and Draco and the aftermath and how he still couldn’t let go. He talked about the darkness inside of him and of the two people inhabiting his body who both wanted completely different things out of love and how much it hurt to be so divided down to his very core.
Hot coffee with a splash of milk and two spoons of sugar in hand, he made his way back. Placing the mug on his desk almost reverently, he stared at the trail of steam rising from the mug as if the coffee was trying to reach a higher level of consciousness by ascending to the heavens or in this case the office room ceiling.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“May I sit with you?”
Harry opened his eyes, but he still didn’t look at him, almost as if he didn’t dare. As if looking at him would make him fade away like a wisp of smoke in the light of day.
“Potter, you’re pissed! The floor is perfectly still.”
When he turned the corner of a large set of shelves, he found Pansy lying on the floor in a pool of what looked like blood. Draco knelt beside her, quickly feeling for her pulse. Relief flooded through him, when he felt it thready but surely under his fingers. The blood he saw came from a head wound that had knocked her out. He carefully examined her skull, but it seemed like she had been lucky, the wound still bleeding sluggishly seemed to be responsible for the blood on the floor, but was not life-threatening. After he made sure that Pansy was ok, he got up again. He had to find his son. Only when he stood, did he see the footprints leading from the pool of blood around Pansy’s head and shoulders further into the warehouse. They were not human. Draco could feel his own blood run cold, when he realised what they meant.
He couldn’t have said how much later it was, when he woke up. He didn’t know where he was, all he knew as that he was warm, finally and that he wasn’t alone. He tried to open his eyes and managed to at the second attempt.
~.o.O.0.O.o.~
“Is that so?”
This was going to be so awkward, he thought, as he squeezed between Malfoy and the back of the sofa. He pulled up the duvet to cover them both, wrapping his arms around Malfoy from behind, running them up and down his torso and arms. Warmth from the fire caressed Harry’s face, where he lay behind Malfoy, feeling his cold frame shake against Harry’s chest. Slowly but surely the shivers subsided and Malfoy’s breathing began to even out. Harry raised himself up to look at Malfoy’s face and was glad to finally see his features relaxed in sleep.
Draco was about to examine the shell closer once more, when Holly appeared in his room with a quiet “pop”.
so much was because they did a complete photo spread on famous Quidditch players every week. This week featured Puddlemere United’s star seeker Harold Maxwell. Draco flipped through the pages, ignoring the interview and only glancing at the pictures. There was the regular stretch of photos with his family, his dog, him in the air above the Quidditch pitch chasing the snitch and then there was a picture that made Draco’s mouth water.
“Here are your instructions convict.”
They were having their afternoon tea in the same drawing room Draco had told her about his feelings for Harry all those years ago. His back was to the window, because he couldn’t bear to look at the oppressive sky for more than a minute. Poxy materialised beside Pansy and tugged on her sleeve to whisper something into her ear which sounded suspiciously like “…Master…visitor that broke in…wards…can’t make him go away. Poxy is sorry Madam!”
“Dobby, for the last time, you promised not to try and save my life ever again, remember?”
The bench was cold and solid beneath him. It was always the same bench around the same time, every single day. The phial was out in the open again and Draco traced its shape with his fingers. Seeing Potter again after such a long time tempted him all the more to just give in. Round and round the distorted image of his own face went as he twisted and turned the small glass object in his fingers. Whispering to him about what lay beneath, drawing him in more than on most days.
“Please look at me.”
Harry stood still staring at Draco, his wand extended towards the boulder and smiling like there was no tomorrow, while the wind blew the strands of his hair around his head. It was like a punch to the gut when Harry realised he had never seen anyone more beautiful. The intensity of his own reaction surprised him. He tried to downplay the effect Draco was having on him by pretending to adjust his scarf, hoping Draco hadn’t noticed what could only have a smitten expression on Harry’s own face.
“I’m warning you, Potter,” he said hoarsely, aiming his wand at Potter.
Draco cleaned himself up, finally properly healing the cut on his thumb. The skin itched for a moment and probably would for the rest of the day, but it would have to do. Another charm took care of the hair that his mirror had just revealed to be atrocious – his mother hopefully having attributed it to be bed-hair. He hovered in the doorway for a moment, casting a longing glance towards where he had hidden the diary and then firmly closed the door behind him.
The general consensus seemed to be that the exhibition was outstanding and that most of the art had already been sold before its opening night had properly begun. Draco would know, he himself had lain claim to a small pixie-esque figure that was no larger than the span of his hand. As the stasis charm degraded, her delicate wings became skeletal until they completely melted away, the substance eating away at her chest, leaving ugly gashes until the spell reset. As the process started again, her filigreed frozen movement turned into a twist of agony as her wings melted away and her torso was destroyed. Draco had been fascinated by the sculpture from the first moment he had lain eyes on it. How the figure changed over time had rung true with something inside of him and he had made Pansy promise that she would sell it only to him.
“Did you hear that?”
He steps into the darkened hallway. Why is everything so dark in this damn house all of a sudden, he wonders. Draco calls after him, but he doesn’t stop walking.
Draco remembered intending to throw the small scroll away but never quite managing to. He’d folded it neatly and tucked it into his wallet at the time. Unbeknownst to Harry, it was still there, still treasured even though it was only the first of many such notes Harry had sent him over the years. No matter what happened, even if it would only serve as a painful reminder of what they’d had and what he’d foolishly thrown away, Draco knew that it would stay with him till the day he died.
Dobby snapped his fingers petulantly before disappearing into thin air.
“Try me.”
Draco was sitting propped up against several pillows, his eyes closed, listening to the sound of Potter’s voice as he was reading to him from one of the books Granger had brought over a few days previously. He didn’t even pay attention to the particular words, just enjoyed the sound and flow of them coming out of Potter’s mouth. He was content, but something nagging at the back of his mind still bothered him.
Draco had been too confused to pick up the diary or do anything but stare out of the window of his room and try to make up his mind on what to do about Harry on whether he was in earnest or whether giving Draco what he wanted was in some way a desperate last attempt to keep his promise to Draco’s mother. Draco didn’t have an answer to these questions. The diary felt tempting and heavy in his hands, but it didn’t feel right to read in it with Draco’s own mind so clouded in worry.
“Where to?” he asked, sounding less than pleased. Draco could have sworn he saw Harry’s face fall at the tone of his voice, but he must have imagined it, it wasn’t like Harry was doing this for the fun of it.
Draco cursed his own helplessness, if he only had a wand. If only his destiny wasn’t tied to that of Potter’s good opinion of him, he’d already have torn the Weaselboy a new one. As it was, all he could do was try not to flinch at the feeling of the hard wood of Weasley’s wand pressing against his Adam’s apple and continue his work. He wasn’t even halfway done and the way things stood, he’d be here all night. Resigned to his fate he sighed once and reached for the next pair of boots when Weasley shoved him to the floor.
Draco made is way over to the small figure and smiled when he saw the red dot next to the plaque listing, date of completion, material and provenance. As he leaned closer to inspect the figure once more someone bumped into him and almost made him drop his drink. Draco felt himself fall forward into the sculpture and could already see it smash in front of his inner eye, when someone grabbed his robe and yanked him backwards into a warm and hard chest. When Draco turned around, the first thing he saw was a big frizzy head of hair and it took a moment for him to realise that it was because Hermione Granger was standing beside Potter who was still holding onto him.
“I don’t know.”
Harry was already halfway across the room, when Draco finally came out of his stupor.
Draco wants to cry, wants to get away from this. What little trust and faith he had in Harry is slowly worn away like the sand on the shore during the high tide. A humming sound to his right finally draws his attention. He looks for it while still caught in the fluid motion and after a moment he finally sees where the noise is coming from. One of the small dragonflies has flown up to him and is hovering just out of reach. A tiny figure sits astride it brandishing a rapier and wearing a black cape looking entirely ridiculous in its seriousness.
“For what? For supporting a megalomaniac madman? For getting half my family killed? For breaking my nose? For making my life hell? For what Malfoy?” Potter was screaming now. “Do you even think I’d want an apology from someone like you? How can you even think you could do anything that would make up for the pain you’ve caused?”
Suddenly there was a light in the dark. He closed his eyes at its brightness, but he could hear voices, Ron and Hermione were here, they had come to save him from the darkness. Harry forced his eyes open again, but there was only darkness around him. He could still hear their voices, wavering in and out of hearing range, like a radio that didn’t quite manage to catch the right frequency.
Draco seemed to spend most of his time reading a leather bound note book or gazing thoughtfully at the large shell Draco’s mother had described to Harry. None of those items seemed particularly dangerous. If only Harry could come up with a solution to his problem. He knew he was grasping at straws when he went to the library and read up on the kind of shell Draco kept staring at. Hours spent in a dusty room full of old tomes brought him no closer to discovering what was going on.
“Is that some kind of beacon?”
“Look, Gin, I’m not going to argue with you about this. I’ll call him whatever I like and frankly I don’t care whether you are happy with that or not. Now, let’s just enjoy the day, the way we agreed we would and stop fighting, alright?”
Harry can’t show up at Malfoy Manor without hard proof of the conspiracy he knows is going on inside the Ministry and it’s tearing him up inside. Weeks pass and still there is nothing going on and still no word from Draco either. Millicent comes by his office several times but they don’t really do anything but talk about how fucked up everything is, them included. Eventually Millicent brings a bottle of Firewhiskey and despite his better judgement Harry helps her empty the whole bottle. He’s never been drunk at work and rather than getting caught he decides to apparate home. Splicing be damned. It’d probably hurt less than his heart does even thinking about Draco.
“Alright.”
When he felt Draco’s prick nudge against his hole, he shivered in anticipation. This was it. This was the moment he’d been waiting for. Draco pushed slowly inside, his prick feeling huge and stretching Harry so far it hurt. All breath left his lungs in a hiss and Draco stopped moving with only the head of his cock buried. The burn subsided faster than Harry would have thought possible.
“I think so too. I am really happy for her.”
Potter looked almost hurt at Draco’s refusal to accept or even acknowledge his apology. Draco himself was not entirely sure why he did not want it, only knowing that right now it hit entirely too close to home. He pasted on a fake smile and knocked his shoulder into Potter’s.
Draco straightened and turned to Granger, offering his hand to shake, which she took after hesitating shortly.
“Potter, what in Merlin’s name are you doing here in the middle of the night?” Draco’s voice sounded annoyed and Harry supposed he had every right to.
In the end Harry’s gaze found Draco’s. Draco’s arms were wrapped tightly around Harry’s waist and Harry’s were wrapped around Draco’s neck. They were both smiling like lunatics. Harry leant forward and ran his nose along Draco’s cheek before placing a chaste kiss on Draco’s lips.
Harry blushed to the roots of his hair, unable to shake the sense of how unreal this felt. Malfoy wasn’t supposed to be nice to him, wasn’t supposed to try to put him at ease and most of all he wasn’t supposed to be flirting with Harry.
“Sorry for what?”
Potter’s whole attitude seemed to change. He straightened up, took several steps back and unlocked the door before replying.
He went back to the diary, Pyxis’ own words seemingly the only proof of his existence. The books Draco had brought down weren’t any help, he had learnt a lot about navigation about what precautions to take and about the ridiculous amount of prejudices and superiority complexes present among 19th century explorers, but hadn’t been able to make heads or tails of the random seeming notes written in the margins on some pages. Maybe the diary would be able to shed some light onto them.
Luna looks at him for a moment before resignedly putting her mug down.
“Are you willing to sacrifice yourself to me?”
He quickly looks behind himself as he runs and there just out of arms reach is a dark-masked rider on a horse reaching for him and shouting for Draco to come with him. But Draco only runs faster. He casts another look over his shoulder and suddenly the rider is held in place by fast-growing vines that shoot out of the ground faster than he can cut them down. Draco doesn’t look back a third time.
Draco was crowded even further into the door and he didn’t mind at all. A thigh was insinuated between his and began rubbing against his erection. Apparently four hours had been too long for him as well.
“It’s mine to take and mine to break!” the man said, before he crushed it in the palm of his hand.
“I am not sure this is what’s usually meant when somebody asks to sit with somebody, Harry.” Draco said, unable to hide the smile that was stealing across his face.
“Won’t the she-weasel mind?”
“Just up front, I will not discuss you and your dealings with Draco any longer. You won’t listen to me anyway and while I don’t think you are good for each other, he told me he would take care of it himself. Now, I’m assuming you found some correlation between accidents and the involvement of Slytherins or former Death Eaters and their affiliations, is that correct?”
Ginny had cleaned all of his clothes, but she’d also washed his dressing gown, which had still smelled of Draco, even almost a month after he’d last worn it. Harry had hidden it at the bottom of his wardrobe under a stasis charm and sometimes, when he couldn’t bear it any longer and he was sure that Ginny wasn’t at home, he would take it out, press the soft fabric to his face inhale deeply and let the memories come. In those moments he could pretend that Draco had been with him of his own free will.
“What do you mean Al got sorted into Slytherin together with Margy Dursley and Scorpius Malfoy? You cannot be serious.”
“Yes, I did.”
Draco wouldn’t admit it, but he was both turned on and scared. Had he done something wrong? Was Harry here to call off the wedding?
He sipped his tea and suppressed the memories that tried to crawl to the forefront of his mind with an effortlessness that came from years of practise. The sound of raised voices drifted from the entrance hall and part of him was curious how somebody had even managed to approach the main door. After all he’d made sure the wards were stronger than ever before.
It had taken Harry too long to realise how wrong things were going. It had taken a single incident to open his eyes to the challenges his former rival had to face every day. When Ron, in a moment of utter insanity, had not only physically abused a man under his care, but had also come up with one of the most degrading tasks imaginable, he’d been utterly ashamed and been overcome with a sense of pity for Draco. Nobody was there to protect him, Harry, the one person who was supposed to make sure of that, had turned a blind eye.
“Yes.”
“No, you know what, I don’t accept that. Dobby, undo what you did!”
It was supposed to be Draco’s turn to send a note to schedule their next meeting. He really needed to get unstuck from this wall and try to find the letter he had dropped. If Harry was writing to him and already breaking the rules of their fragile friendship he had better find out what it was about. Draco had had an idea of where they should go, but wasn’t sure whether the venue would be considered strange. Going ice-skating on an enchanted pond could definitely not be described as toeing the line, as the association was decidedly romantic.
“Do you know what I do for a living, Harry?”
“Harry then, I have it from reliable sources that you have no plans for Christmas Eve, is that true?”
After a cup of coffee and a scone with clotted cream, Harry decided that it was time to have a proper look around the inside, now that he wasn’t tired from hours of flying. For some reason the lighthouse was in what the Ministry called a “no Apparition Zone” and despite being an Unspeakable, Harry didn’t know why some regions that weren’t under any kind of protective spells, like Hogwarts, were still impossible destinations.
Pyxis was staring down at him through serious dark eyes and for the first time in a long time, Draco felt like an intruder and not someone who had been allowed to seek refuge in this sanctuary. Pyxis had probably never wanted for someone to read the words he had written down to lighten his burden. Draco found that despite the guilt of reading something not intended for his eyes he couldn’t seem to stay away.
They ended up on a jetty jutting into the river Thames. Potter was about to take his shoes and socks off to stick his feet into the water, but Draco stopped him.
He stalked out into the dark, his wand raised with a Lumos as the wind beat his parka around his slim frame.
“Yes,” Draco sounded proud, “and look, if I do this,” he touched his hand to one of the bright stars between himself and Harry and it expanded until they could make out an entire solar system.
Another knock sounded and Harry began to shake with terror. They were here to claim him, to take him away. The knocking continued and grew louder, more urgent.
“Doesn’t make it any less true!”
When he opened the door and found Draco, soaked and windswept, Harry had to fight his impulse to bring him inside and take care of him. He looked confused and scared. Remembering his resolution from earlier, Harry schooled his face into a neutral mask and asked him what he wanted, when Draco, no, Malfoy, didn’t speak.
Ten minutes later, after he’d cleaned himself up in the Gents as best as he could without magic and wrapped his hand with a makeshift bandage, he went to work in the Auror recruits’ locker room. It was just his luck that the recruits had been out training for a field assignment, apparently spending the entire day running up and down a muddy road. It reeked of petty revenge, but by this stage Draco was used to it and began the job in a state of numb despair.
By February Draco had returned to his potions degree and life had returned to its regular routine. Pansy came over once or twice a week to cheer him up and tell him about yet another ‘gorgeous bloke’ she’d met who would be ‘just perfect’ for him, and every week he would humour her and then turn down her offer to introduce him. He’d gone along with her wishes the first three or four times but had declined every time after that because those meetings never seemed to work out and only brought home to him just how much he still missed Harry.
“Are you missing hair in any other areas?”
It took him three tries to get up on shaky feet and step over to the desk. To his disappointment, it was entirely empty but for a thick layer of dusk. All the drawers were locked and without his wand there was no chance to get a look inside. The shelves on the left and right carried several ancient tomes, the gold lettering on their sleeves also caked in the thick residue that seemed to cover everything in this place, making their titles illegible.
“Draco.” Harry’s voice sounded scared and broken even to his own ears.
Draco squeezed Potter’s hand at that.
“Please, please don’t make me leave. I don’t want to be alone. I just can’t bear it… I just can’t…”
“Alright” He managed to croak out, clinging to his cuppa like a life-line.
“Potter, as much as I enjoy your company, I have work to do,
“Are you about finished, you hag?” he asked.
“Thank you,” Luna says, smiling at Millicent. Both of them only have eyes for each other, so Harry excuses himself and leaves, but not before getting Millicent to agree to come to his office the next morning to file a report.
“You’ll never catch me Potter, Malfoys are superior runners,” he yelled. Suddenly stopped short by Harry who’d appeared right in front of him. The bastard must have apparated when he’d realised he wouldn’t catch up with Draco through conventional means.
“You know what’s the upside of pretentious shit like this vernissage?”
“What do you mean? Wasn’t that your diary?”
It wasn’t easy for Draco to change his opinion of Potter, but at least he could admit to himself that there was more to him than met the ever so public eye. Maybe that was why Potter had been at the Ministry on Christmas Eve instead of at home. When everyone was gone, maybe if only for a moment he could stop pretending. Could be who he wants to be, who he was inside and not who responsibility to everyone else dictated him to be. Maybe that’s why the present he had received had been so tempting.
“And berate you I shall.” Draco winked and then blushed. He wanted to slap himself for his antics.
And finally it was time, it wasn’t just the phial calling out to him, it was the right time, he had waited, had suffered through all those months, but most importantly, he hadn’t broken his promise. Nothing had got better it had only got worse, he still felt hollow and broken and unworthy. He’d felt trapped and desperate when he’d purchased the phial. It was supposed to be his last resort. If things got so bad that he couldn’t stand it anymore, he would drink the contents of the phial and drift into beautiful oblivion forever. Free from pain and sorrow, from worry and fear.
Draco flipped through the pages of the tome, trying to find the year Pyxis claimed to have been born in and found several heavily charred and blackened pages starting in 1815 and leading up to 1846, over thirty years of family history simply missing. He doubted that it was a coincidence.
“Yes, Master Draco.”
“Excuse me, when I grow old, I will age with dignity, have you seen the portraits of my ancestors?”
For a moment Draco couldn’t believe what he was hearing. That fucking cunt! She knew about them, she had to. She’d done this on purpose to fuck with his mind. The all-consuming hatred that boiled up inside of him at the thought of her putting Harry to bed and then going on to fake intimacy with him for the benefit of an audience, was not something that was easy to hide. He tried to calm himself and carefully set the mug down, before he squeezed it any harder, making it burst. Draco tried to focus on what was important – the fact that Harry hadn’t slept with that bint, the fact that the first thing he’d done, after seeing her out of the door had been to crawl into bed with Draco, the fact that… wait, how had he even ended up in his own bed?
“Okay Malfoy, here’s how we’re going to play this and you’d better pay attention!”
“It’s obvious these instructions aren’t from Potter, he’s the only one who’s allowed to delegate tasks to me. I want to speak to him.”
He let his stance relax in so far as that was possible in Potter’s tight grip, cast his eyes down submissively and hunched his shoulders to appear smaller and more helpless than he was. Everything about him seemed to scream ‘I am scared, protect me.’ Behaviour like that wasn’t befitting a Malfoy, but it did have the desired effect. Potter backed off. Survival, it was all about survival – for the next twelve months at least. Repeating this like a mantra inside his head, Draco finally looked up quickly before lowering his gaze again.
“I see they were all out of manners when they threw you together,” Malfoy said and slumped down at the table. However the prat managed to make even that motion look graceful was beyond Harry.
The change of surroundings was quite sudden. He was back in the armchair, his therapist at his side, her wand still attached to his forehead.
Everything felt surreal in this dark and silent room and Draco allowed himself the luxury of admitting that he’d always loved watching Harry sleep. His Harry was beautiful in his sleep with no worry lines marring his features. If he’d been able to, Draco would have stretched out his hand and caressed the soft skin of Harry’s face.
“Is there anything specific you can tell me about him?”
“Can you lie down in the middle of the bed?”
“Yes, because you are just as sick as I am, of always doing the responsible thing.”
