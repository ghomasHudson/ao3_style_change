Thing was, he didn’t look like he was trying to behave.
He gave Amelia, who stood rigid with horror, a smile. “
Harry nodded swiftly. “I know. I’ve seen it. I still don’t understand why he thought I needed my room to be so… extravagant,” he said carefully, deliberately avoiding Mrs Malfoy’s look of disappointment. “But it was a kind thing to do.” He cleared his throat. “I think I’ve given the wrong impression, Mrs Malfoy.”
It was Harry Potter, because of course it was Harry Potter.
Hermione nodded dumbly. She didn’t move until long after she had heard the roar of the Floo.
“Mostly true.”
“He’s behind, of course,” Hermione admitted. “But he loves to go to Romania and spend time with Charlie Weasley, and the dragons. There’s always so much to do. And he enjoys it,” she almost shouted, afterwards.
, who had done such an extraordinary job, he pushed open the door to his bedroom.
“She doesn’t need anything. She has everything she could ever want.” It was a test; would Harry back down and show up empty-handed? If he did, Narcissa might stop meddling and declare him a lost cause. “I cannot believe you accepted that invitation, Potter.”
“You two,” he said, retuning to his bowl of porridge. “And you call me and Luna mental.”
“I can’t think of…”
She had accepted it, delighted, and declared herself a free elf. And then she’d gone back to work, refused to leave the house, the silly thing. She still wore it today, kept it clean and pressed and carefully covered it with a smock while she worked in the kitchen. And she had been very solicitous of Draco’s favour since.
“No,” Harry said, smiling, but his skin felt like it might just fly away and leave the rest of him behind. “We have plenty of food in the kitchen.”
“What time does Hermione get home?”
like — someone who mattered to Draco, in a very individual and personal way.
There were a thousand things she might have intended to say, but she said none of them, and Harry heard her regardless.
. His consciousness seemed to flit between
“Another book? Well, I suppose they all sell, don’t they. But this is private. Like, you won’t use my name, right?” She looked anxious, and a little sly.
But it was nice to think about. He let a smile play over his lips, but was careful not to look up.
us, you know. During the war. When we were hunting the Horcruxes. He left.”
“And there has to be limits. Nothing that will hurt them.”
“Like you wouldn’t believe,” he said. “Let me get my warm robes.”
“Maybe twice a year,” Neville replied with a sigh. “Or he used to. Being an Auror kept him busy, but he’d invite the old gang around…”
“You know we’ll need to go to Dumbledore,” Harry said. His voice echoed unpleasantly around the bathroom, like some portent of doom. The acoustics in here were frankly terrifying; Draco had always thought so. He might have chosen somewhere slightly less dreadful to have a nervous breakdown and prostrate himself at Harry Potter’s feet.
“Of course,” Harry said. “And we’re not at war, Draco. This needs to be challenging, and fun, not frightening.” He sat quietly for a few long, drawn out moments. “You care about them, don’t you. The children.”
Over dinner at the Leaky the weekend after Harry had settled Andromeda and Teddy into their new home, he and Ron and Hermione had talked about how strange things were.
“God, no, Draco. You’re so much better.” Earnest and raw the way few could ever be.
. And something of an expert in the dark arts and defence thereof. If you think I can’t sniff out a love potion under a couple of layers of tissue paper and cellophane…”
“We agreed I could come back. He’s sending my files to St. Mungo’s.” He smiled, but Hermione knew Harry well enough to know when he was lying.
Harry spent one night at number 12, Grimmauld Place before he headed for Hogwarts.
The days went by. Luna replied that dinner at the Leaky would have to wait until she was back from a trip to Iceland to look for ice bats (Harry wasn’t sure they existed, but Luna was frequently right about things like that and Harry had learned not to assume
“I am a Mind Healer,” Draco said drily. “As you might recall.”
Determined not to let anyone see him looking quite this frazzled (or turned on) Draco took a long shower, wanked himself to a spectacular conclusion and then spent a good long time doing yoga in his bedroom. He cleared his mind with practised ease, focusing on only the shape of his body, the length of his muscles, the delicious stretch as he moved from position to position.
He glanced at Draco as he said it, and immediately wished he hadn’t. Draco had so many regrets. He offered up a weak smile, and Draco adjusted his stance. Harry waved in the direction of the chalkboard.
By the time Harry was back in his rooms he was in physical discomfort, he was so hard. He barely made it through the door before he was tossing his robes aside, unzipping his jeans and throwing himself onto his back on the bed with one hand wrapped around his cock, jerking furiously. He sucked the fingers of his other hand into his mouth and wet them just enough to make them slick against his nipples, the various other erogenous zones that he’d found over the years.
He cast a locking spell on the door to his rooms, and brought out a new phial of his potion. A little of his own hair, a little of Potter’s — he hoped that he might be allowed to skip the whole ‘dropping through a nightmare realm’ part of the experience, but there was no such luck.
Watching Harry trying to relax enough to sit down was rather like watching someone break all their limbs in order to fit inside a teacup, but Harry managed in the end, and accepted the glass of wine without a great deal of protest. He still looked rather like he had itching powder in his knickers, but one thing at a time.
personal questions. Which will need to be answered.”
Black said you needed…”
“There are a thousand years of Wandmakers in my family, Mr Potter,” the old man said, examining the tiny wand. “The skill usually passes down from generation to generation. But my son, bless his good heart — he was a Healer, until he retired, and so are all of his children. And my daughter, light of my life, was a rather famous Quidditch player, until she settled down to raise her own family, and took a coaching job instead. Of course, she’s retired too, and her children are so clever — they do all sorts of things. One of them is friends with your Charlie Weasley, works with dragons in Romania.” He pointed at a photograph on the wall, of a woman who looked rather a lot like Ollivander himself, dressed in Quidditch leathers and clutching a quaffle, sitting up on her broom occasionally to wave at the camera. There were dozens of photographs on the wall. Healers, and gardeners, and everything under the sun.
“Why did you let me in?”
Draco supposed it probably was. Humiliating, and hard. And he knew it would be insulting to offer Harry a chance to bow out. So. “You got this far, though. You might as well finish.”
“I suppose.” Hermione felt ill, suddenly. But Harry didn’t reply. His lack of experience in relationships wasn’t a sore spot.
“Honestly?” Draco said. “Five years of therapy, along with another fifteen of providing therapy. Not one single person in this generation can ever hope to spend a day unaffected by the war. Not your fault, and not mine. Our choices play such a small part in it.”
“Come on. You haven’t seen around the manor. Let’s leave the old people to their politics.”
“He’s helping to train Seekers,” Draco said, trying to hide his disappointment. What he was disappointed about, he couldn’t have said. He’d never been asked to help train Quidditch. He wanted to see Harry’s spluttering red face when his mother opened that chest and took out whatever those finishing touches were to be. He wanted to see Harry flushed with pleasure and pink with the cool air, his hair damp with sweat and his smile natural instead of forced.
“Potter,” Draco said, frowning. “You’ve always been rubbish at potions.” He gestured for the note.
Draco made a disgusted noise, but didn’t reply, just ordered two glasses of limoncello and a carafe of the house red wine. Dreadful combination but as he was quite certain that Harry would soon disappear from his life, and with him both Blaise and Granger —
“He’s never liked feeling like he got anything he didn’t earn.” She fiddled with a quill on her desk. “We thought he’d want to get his NEWTs.”
“I,” said Harry.
He felt ill.
Harry quietly began planning Draco Malfoy’s horrifying and humiliating death. The plan was sketchy, but it definitely involved everyone Draco had ever met seeing his underpants.
Harry tried to pull away. “No, it’s fine.”
Draco blinked at him repeatedly. “I agree,” he said. Not condoning, but he hoped his expression was supportive.
It wasn’t a simple question to ask. Madam Shacklebolt had been the head of the Auror Office when Harry had arrived as a first-year apprentice, at nineteen, after belatedly completing his N.E.W.Ts as an eighth-year student at Hogwarts. Two years later he’d been a Junior Auror; and now…
“If you want a sausage, I’ve got one for you,” Harry said. “There’s nothing in the larder. Not for years. That door won’t open. You know that.”
“I understand there are some photograph albums,” Topher said.
“It’s that time of the year, you know,” he said, looking out the window into the stormy streets. “Summer storms, and then… children from all over Europe will come to our store looking for their very first wands. I’ll finally be able to teach you.”
“Don’t worry. I’m still as ambitious, sneaky and self-serving as ever,” Draco had, his voice velvety and mellifluous. Hermione didn’t call him on it. “I think that’s enough for now. You look as if you might need some sleep. Rubino will take you to your quarters. Is Blaise with you?”
Harry woke up feeling as though a centaur had shat in his head. He lay in bed, utterly morose, until he remembered the little bottle. He had, conveniently enough, fallen asleep in his robes, so he shifted around until he found exactly which pocket was poking him in the hip, and he downed the potion in one go.
“I’m an Auror, Draco,” he said, with a sigh. “Trying to sneak up on me is rather like trying to teach a fire crab to sing. It won’t work, and you’ll annoy the fire crab.”
Draco steeled himself. “In this world, we appear to be involved in a relationship. Both romantic and sexual in nature. It appears to have begun in Sixth Year at Hogwarts. He doesn’t speak of the war. He believes that his Godfather is on some kind of holiday. He has said on numerous occasions that we can’t have you and Ron to the house because you have two small children to care for. The reality inside his mind bears little similarity to the real world.”
Potter looked relieved for the change of subject, and he reached for his glass. “If we’re going to sit here and talk about clothes all night, then sod the Dreamless Sleep. You
“I do have a life, here, you know. I have friends. I have…” Draco gesticulated. “
The Hogwarts elves kept everyone fed and worked hard themselves — too hard, by Hermione’s reckoning — and every single day felt full of joyful purpose.
“Madam Shacklebolt,” Harry said, slowly, cautiously.
“Blimey,” Blaise said. “Alright. That might not be my cup of tea.” He poured himself a glass of wine instead. “You forget, those of us in Slytherin did know you better than most. We saw you at your best as well as your worst. You were funny, and clever, and you kept an eye on the little ones, even when you called them names. You cared about people. You had a funny way of showing it, but you did.”
“Please don’t go,” Draco murmured. “After all of this — I keep imagining what it might be like if you wake up. If you wake up with me. What it might be like. Fuck, Harry, you complete tosser. I know you don’t like having anything nice for yourself but perhaps you could see this as a gift to me. Not a gift. Something I need like Neville Longbottom needs plants. Don’t forget. Please, don’t forget, what it was like. What we were like. What we
“I’d heard the opposite.”
He felt an answering smile against his throat. “You’re an appalling sap. You sound like a second-year Hufflepuff. No arguing, then.”
Draco hesitated, and then lifted his right arm to show Harry. “I designed them to hide the Dark Mark. I tried to get rid of it. It scarred, and I still… I
Hermione rested her face in her hands. What had he said?
“Harry,” he said, a final time. “Are you here?”
Draco wrinkled his nose. “You might have a point.” He looked down at the points of his shoes. “Beautiful job, Kreacher. I’d ask you to do something about Harry’s hair, but I know how you feel about abject failure.”
“Think about me now,” Harry said. “Think about me always.”
“You need to know, Harry. We’re in Last Gasp territory.”
And, there was a knock on the door of his classroom. Harry glanced at his clock, panicking for a moment that he might have slept through to Monday, but no. He crossed the room, and opened the door, and froze.
Harry almost said ‘triple distilled’, but instead he answered “Plain, please. No milk or sugar.”
“Hermione Granger had inflicted a stinging hex which made my face swell up, so my identity might be hidden,” he was saying, very calmly, his voice more adult than any Draco had ever managed to achieve. “Mr Malfoy was brought to identify me. He did; we’d known each other for several years, and he knew it was me. He lied to Bellatrix Lestrange and said he didn’t know if it was me or not. He risked his own life, and those of his parents, to save my life.”
“I never sneezed at them,” Harry agreed. “My Aunt Petunia was very enthusiastic about Christmas as well, though in her case, I was always the house-elf.”
“Yes, but she knows to stay away until I say she can come.”
Harry frowned. This was not what he had been expecting. Malfoy looked for a moment as if he had something else he wanted to say to Ron but was rapidly running out of steam. In fact, his hands had begun to shake.
“You may be right,” he agreed, at last. “But that doesn’t make it any more practical. And now I can’t talk about it any more, or think about it, alright? And I need to talk to you about another patient, a little girl.”
“Oh, you are as tiresome as a First Year Hufflepuff. I am trying to tell you that I am not sure there is anyone in the world quite so well suited to you. I believe the two of you could achieve extraordinary things together. Harry Potter, loathsome creature than he is, is a singular wizard, as are you. If anything so mundane as happiness appeals to you then you should know that I believe you could find it with him.” Snape raised his chain. “And if you tell anyone I said so, I will never grace this frame with my presence again.”
that it makes me want to tear tongues from heads. But it happened, Harry. It happened, twenty-five years ao, and you survived. And hiding it behind a curtain or a door, or tossing it in the cellar or the attic, none of those things can stop it from ever having happened. Do you hear me?”
And then, days later, pacing in the corridor and waiting until his mother emerged, almost unable to stand, she was so relieved. She wrapped her arms around Draco and neither of them cried, but only because Malfoys didn’t cry.
“Oh, Harry,” she said, with a very wide smile. “Thank you. And thank you for coming.”
“I know what headlights are, ‘Mione,” Ron said, with more confidence than he probably should have. “Muggles wear them to go exploring caves. Just can’t think why a deer would need one. They see well in the dark, and they don’t live in caves — do they?”
Hermione nodded again. The smell of the books was comforting. She kept staring at them, letting them anchor her in the room.
Harry’s face was a mask, when she looked up.
. They never fail to end. It’s the way of the world.”
There were wards.
For the next several days, he and Malfoy were appallingly polite with one another. Harry hated it. He’d come to enjoy the camaraderie, the playful barbs. But he felt sick and angry every time he thought about the way Malfoy had insulted his living conditions and he wasn’t ready for anything more than a ‘good morning, Professor Malfoy’.
Draco had been there, and seen it, and worse, he’d played along with it. Used Harry’s feelings for him to coax him out of his head. Which was probably entirely reasonable from a therapeutic point of view, but that didn’t make Harry’s stomach hurt any less.
“Feels true. Things happened. I’m done with things happening, I think. I sacrificed myself. They shouldn’t have made me take that back.”
“Breathe, Minister Granger,” he said, sounding bored. “I do try to be punctual, but I’ll remind you if I must that I have
Hermione poured herself a glass of dandelion wine (Harry knew she didn’t generally enjoy it much but this particular wine was flavoured with raspberries, and she seemed to like it) and fretted around the kitchen counter. Harry, on the other hand, felt supremely calm.
“Romantic tosh,” Draco agreed, with what he hoped was a look of smug indifference, but knew was probably more like the look on Harry’s face when Dora did something cute. “Side-along? I don’t want you to get ash on those robes.”
“What was the best thing?” Blaise asked. Not in that way he had sometimes where he was asking a question to hide the fact that he was making a point. No, this was pure Zabinian curiosity.
Hermione pulled him towards the door, and the wards warmed to welcome him, far friendlier than he could remember them. The door opened, and Harry stepped inside, pulled by Hermione and otherwise utterly stunned.
“You do understand, don’t you?” Harry said, hopefully.
“Cock and a half, sometimes. I’m astoundingly good at paperwork, too, always ahead on that.”
“Well, a bit,” Ron admitted, uncomfortably. He’d hated the way the house looked before. Hadn’t realised how bad it was, outside of Harry’s bedroom… not that the bedroom was much better.
Draco stared at the tray for a few more moments. “Maybe you could refresh the warming charms,” he said, quietly. Seemed very strange for him not to do it himself, but Harry wasn’t going to poke at him about it. He just did it.
“I hope Aunt Bella heard you say that from the afterlife,” Draco replied, finally getting his breath back, and casting a quick cleaning charm on his shirt.
Draco smiled warmly, standing up from his desk. “Hullo,” he replied. “Are you hungry?”
He enjoyed the way Malfoy flushed, and envied the way Malfoy seemed able to dismiss the criticism moments later.
Hermione gaped, but Harry could hear the cogs in her mind working overtime. “But he…”
The moon was out and bright, the gentle cloud cover distributing the light. It was a frightening place nonetheless. The graves were overgrown, the statues damaged and inhuman looking. Draco refused to look at a statue of an angel with its nose broken off, for fear it would turn into the ghost of Lord—
“And I got into law school,” Hermione said. “You watch if I’m not running the Ministry by the time I’m thirty.”
. You utter
And Draco couldn’t watch for another moment.
“I’m leaving,” Malfoy said. “There’s no place for me here. Not after everything I’ve done. You’re right to hate me. You all are.”
“Did you tell a policeman?” Ron asked, his eyebrows high on his forehead. “I don’t expect they’re as clever as Aurors, but I still think it’s best to tell them. D’you think he’d go to jail?”
“War give you a spot of brain damage, Potter? I asked if you’ve been following me around again.”
Get us out of here,” he said. “Show me how you tear those wards into pieces. This time, because you want to be with me. Show me.”
“I’m so glad,” she murmured. “I’m so glad. I couldn’t be happier.”
That night, he sat on the bed with a mug of tea and looked at the envelope Malfoy had handed him. He hadn’t decided yet if he was going to open it. His door opened, and Ron and Hermione slipped inside, already in their pyjamas and clutching their own mugs of tea.
“I did. Auror Patil will show you Harry’s office, and then —”
And just like that, he realised the truth.
No. That was a lie.
On a Wednesday that was only remarkable in that it was
“Fantastic,” Ron said again, grinning. “You’re like a proper Muggle sometimes, Harry. You’ll have to tell dad all about it.”
Ron,” Harry said, gently, topping off his glass. “It’s up to you whether you stay or not. But I can’t. I don’t want to. I did what I did because I had to, and it never occurred to me for a moment that I could ever be any good at anything else. I don’t want to ever have to Hex someone again…”
Hermione drew her wand, and Harry clenched his teeth — Episkey was as painful as the nose breaking in the first place, but afterwards, Hermione cooled his overheated face with a quick charm and he felt a little bit better. Ron looked delighted, hanging over the back of the couch.
“We’d probably best get some sleep,” he said, sitting up abruptly. He dusted off his robes, and pointedly refused to look at the expression on Draco’s face.
He smiled, and examined his bread, which had proved for a second time and was ready to slip into the oven. “I’m not ready. I’m nearly ready, but I’m not ready. I know what comes next, and I’m — I’m looking forward to it. I’m nearly there. There are things I need to do, first.”
Harry snorted. “Yeah. First time I went to the Burrow, the summer after first year, I felt the same. Everyone happy and shouting… I didn’t know families could be like that.”
Draco frowned. “Furious? Worried. I was hardly the first Healer summoned.”
“Just so’s you know, I haven’t told anyone you’re here. Not even Blaise or Pansy. It’s up to you, really. But you should probably know now that they are friends of mine, and they tend to show up unannounced.”
“Hence the day off.”
“Yes,” he said. “I told you that the stasis spells can only do so much. It’s getting harder to stay on top of the dehydration, and I am concerned about the potential for atrophy. Of his muscles and his magic. It seems too soon for any of that, but… Harry is an exceptionally strong Wizard, as you know all too well. I hadn’t considered the potential impact of being cut off from his magic for so long. I assumed that with his great strength that we’d have more time, but I think it means we may have less.”
“Bet you I’ll drop the soap!” Draco called down the stairs. “Here I go! Whoops, there go my pyjama pants.”
“No,” Ron said. “You’re just — busy, is all. You’re a busy bloke. An Auror all those years and now you’re a professor, and you don’t have time for fun, I bet. But you know how,” he said again, eyes wide.
Pansy raised an eyebrow. She’d never been big on being polite for the sake of being polite. “I’m sure it is,” she said. “I heard you were an Auror. Or the Minister for Magic, or the Headmaster of Europe, or something equally ridiculous. You’re a shop-boy?”
“Psychiatry is very difficult with people who talk. It’s a damn sight harder when they won’t even wake up. I think I understand some of this, you know. You’ve constructed this life, and this house, hidden everything away in it that you don’t want to think about. We have to open every last one of those doors, Potter, or I’m never going to be able to wake you up.”
“They don’t open, Draco. Stop it.” He tried to pull away.
“Why did he do it, Blaise? It was a house, a… I know it was alive. How could he kill it? All those Pureblood things…”
He had a rather odd certainty that Draco would be just the same.
The days and nights ran together. Ollivander had never quite recovered his stock levels after the shop had been destroyed in the war, and Harry worked long hours trying to build their supplies up again. While the shop was open, Harry taught Ellie how to ring up the purchases and package up the wands while he focused in helping the children connect with one. He listened to the children quietly telling him their fears about not knowing anyone at Hogwarts, not making friends, not being in Ravenclaw like their mum had been or Hufflepuff like their dad. Some of them came back again a couple of times before the school year started just to have the same soothing conversations with Harry a second time, and a third.
“I’m a disaster. You’re a disaster. We duel like maniacs and what I lack in your raw power I more than make up for in hard-earned skill. We both survived the fucking war.
“I think I should probably start making arrangements to head back to London,” Harry said, on a sigh. “I know you’ve said — but I’ve been intruding here for months. I can get back to light duties.”
“I’d hoped you might get there on your own,” his mentor said, gently. “But sometimes there is a gap. Between what is ethical — and what is right.”
Ron flushed. “Long time ago now, mate. We’re still friends, and all. Just didn’t work out.”
“Alright, Ronald?”
legs if anyone so much as breathed on him wrong, or let slip to any of the much younger and stupider staff around the hospital that the famous Harry Potter was under their roof. He gave Rubino a long list of instructions, so long in fact that Rubino had gazed at Draco with hearts in his eyes for a full five seconds before he disappeared into the fireplace looking as much vindicated as cheered. Perhaps he had been bored.
Skittish he was, just then.
“Why me?” Draco asked, at last. “You could ask Neville.”
Instead, he sighed, and reached across the table to close his fingers around Hermione’s wrist.
“Then you’ll do that,” Hermione said.
“May I be blunt?” he asked.
When Harry left that night, he felt the wards acknowledge him, and then, only then, did he feel a tear trickle down his cheek.
“He doesn’t need any bloody potatoes, Petunia, he needs to learn a lesson. And people learn lessons when there are
Draco pulled away from the two men and glared.
“And then I thought perhaps you just didn’t like me that way.” He stepped closer, and let his gaze run over Harry’s body, slowly. Too slowly. “But unless you had a sausage stuffed in your knickers I don’t think that was the problem.”
“Oh, I’d say you were a solid Wesley,” Draco replied airily. “No… a little higher than that. I assume he still eats with his fingers.”
“Now, pay attention,” Harry said, to the twenty or so students collected in the room. He wondered if the group would shrink or grow over time. “There are rules to duelling. You are not here to defend yourselves against the forces of evil. We are not at war.”
He was almost back and Hermione’s house when he found himself in front of a Tesco. Abruptly, he realised that he hadn’t cooked in a very long time; in fact he rarely bothered to make himself anything more complicated than a sandwich. He stood gawking at the produce for about ten minutes. And then, in a flurry of inspiration, he bought the ingredients for a risotto dish that he knew Hermione and Ron had both loved, back in the days when he often cooked at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, when they were trying to find their feet again as friends.
Harry met his eyes for a moment, and nodded.
“And for how many of those years have you been entirely miserable, Harry?”
“Oh, good. You blame yourself, Harry doubtless blames himself, I’m sure even Ron has found a way to make it all his fault. A little self-centred, I think.”
And despite all of that, Harry Potter was buried a thousand kilometres underground in the only reality he could manage.
Hermione smiled. “Well, I do. But you shouldn’t be hasty.” She tapped her wand against the watch on her wrist, bringing up the following day’s schedule. “I have a deal for you. Tomorrow I’ll come home early. And we’ll go and visit Number Twelve together. And then… then you can make a decision.”
“I’d always imagined you were raised a proper little prince. That your messy clothes were an affectation.” Harry didn’t reply. “There’s never been a word about anything like that in the
“Mother doesn’t believe that this is a lost cause. I’m giving us one last chance to find out if she’s right or not.”
“Say it. Say it happened, Harry.”
“Here we go.”
“You’re still very, very odd, Potter,” Draco said, and Harry snorted a laugh.
They were quiet for a while and Harry decided to give his pie another go. He had barely shovelled a forkful into his mouth when Hermione let out a defeated sigh and dropped her shoulders.
“Not often enough,” Harry said, turning away. “Come on!”
“Fuck off.”
“I hope no one saw that. This isn’t exactly my crowd. Did she — you
“Hello, Kreacher,” Hermione said.
“You’re a much better actor than you were in school,” Blaise answered, lifting his hood. “More tea?”
“But I mean,” he said, “if he can turn the underside of this table into his bed in Gryffindor Tower, then the sky’s the limit, innit?” He shook his head. “Maybe Kreacher could help. Are you really getting Harry more elves?”
Harry frowned. “Dumbledore wouldn’t —”
“Just Harry, please,” Harry replied, blithely. He stepped inside and looked around, but if he was wondering if anything had changed, it had not; the door to his hospital room was long gone, though, the private ward now only accessible from the main part of the hospital once more.
“I’m sorry?”
Hermione didn’t want to bring Parvati this time. She wanted no secrets, and that meant only Blaise and herself. But Parvati wouldn’t be swayed and Blaise was even more immovable on the subject. Hermione couldn’t deny that she had been running herself ragged, and as much as she found it difficult to believe that anything would happen to her at a tiny Wizard hospital in Naples she wasn’t prepared to spend any more time arguing with either one of them. She had waited two whole days to receive word from Draco that she could come and visit; she wasn’t waiting any longer.
“Er, no thanks. Not something I intend to collect on.” He looked like he had something else to say, but he left off. As Draco was beginning to enjoy Potter being too exhausted to behave like a right git, he elected to leave it for another day. No Malfoy would walk around with a life debt uncollected upon, but he did feel every so slightly sorry for the prat, just then.
The following Saturday, Draco met his mother outside the school gates, where she had apparated with a chest full of Merlin knew what and this time, just two of her minions. Though it was still only early Autumn, the day was cool, and she was wearing one of her better fur-lined coats. Draco kissed her cheek, and took her arm, and led her into the castle.
There was a quiet knock on the door, and Harry looked up, surprised. “Come in,” he said.
“It’s not safe in there!” Harry shouted, but his voice was as thick and slow and useless as his feet. He heard the click of the door opening, the terrible hiss of the basilisk, and then Draco’s screams. “Draco! No!”
He wished he could offer a reassuring touch of some kind. Brush Harry’s hair away from his face the way his mother would have done it, once. Held him, perhaps, until he fell asleep.
“It’s amazing,” she said. “Knowing she’s in there. She has brown skin, like me, a little lighter. And red hair, but it’s darker than the Weasleys’. She likes music. And I love her, and I’d lay my life down for her, and I think every mother says that, but I know I can and will if I have to because I have stepped in front of hexes and curses and even
Harry swallowed hard, and his gaze shifted to Draco’s mouth, and away again.
“That’s about the worst thing I’ve ever heard. Goodness, Harry. You need a hobby.” But he was smiling, with one eyebrow raised crookedly. “Or perhaps you need to get laid? I don’t want to cast aspersions.” He crossed his arms. “Bonsai. Have you heard of that? Strange hobby, but the little trees are interesting, and if you took it up, Neville would probably follow you around making heart eyes at you.”
“Oh, Harry,” she replied. “Hermione and I are thick as thieves, you do know that, don’t you?”
Two days later, dressed in mourning robes, they apparated to a cemetery which Harry had never heard of before. Judging by the unearthly and faintly dangerous-looking gravestones and mausoleums, this was a pureblood cemetery. Ron held Hermione’s hand, and Harry carried Teddy (who was looking decidedly drab) on his hip, Andromeda crying stoically as she wiped her nose.
“We work so hard,” Draco said, and Harry felt uncomfortable. This was his first day off in so long. He didn’t want to think about work.
“Can you take this to Luna Lovegood in the morning, please?” he asked, offering up a peanut butter cracker, Scamp’s favourite. Scamp gave him an affectionate nip at the base of his thumb, and as soon as the letter was tied to her foot, she was gone. She would fly to Luna’s home, do some hunting along the way and then sleep a couple of hours, delivering the note as soon as Luna woke up.
“Harry Potter, cursed as he was with a conscience, a destiny, and far too much responsibility for any one person to bear, had less choice than any of us.”
Ron didn’t know how to respond to that, so he just followed Topher to the kitchen, where he was opening all the cupboards and drawers.
“Slick prat,” Harry replied.
It started.
He stood for a moment, torn. Harry didn’t seem to have noticed him.
Hermione was probably appalled, but Harry just hugged the tiny, wizened old elf back. He hadn’t realised quite how much he missed him.
“He broke my nose. I think we’d have to call that status quo.”
Hermione frowned, trying to parse that. “Do you really believe that?”
Ron stood up, blushing. “They’re great, they are,” he said. “Floo me if you need me.”
He didn’t have a lot of bloody choice in the matter.
And just like that, school was over.
Whatever wandless, non-verbal spell Harry was using to cool the blistered skin was working beautifully. The careful gestures would have been spellbinding even without Harry’s determined expression, but Draco watched him carefully, eyes flickering between his hands and his face, and wondered when he’d become ‘Harry’ again.
“Nah, mate. Spending it with Pans. Mum’s having a summer Christmas in Australia with her new paramour. He’s about a hundred and fifty years old, probably won’t survive the trip, but she knows how to put a smile on an old man’s face.” Blaise stood by Harry, leaning against the cold window. “Blimey. I really
"Oh I could heat it if I really wanted to, I just don't bother."
Harry looked at Draco, and Draco's walls came tumbling down. He cared for Harry very much. He had fancied him for a long time, and now he was closer than ever to them becoming a reality. This was the chance he had been waiting for most of his life, his only chance. If he went back to being a complete ass to Harry, Harry would never want to be his friend, or anything more, any more.
"I'm sorry you had to find out that way." Harry said. Albus thought his dad would be very angry with him when he found out he had told his siblings, but when he looked up, Harry just looked sad. "I didn't know how to tell you."
of your friends about this. Your father, our whole family has been through enough. We don't need this is the news too."
"Bill! Fleur!" Ron called out.
The stone, Harry never used again. Years later, he was finally able to destroy it, ensuring no one could ever become the Master Of Death again.
When he finally went back to work 2 days after the article, his own employees started asking if he was leaving or getting fired. Most of the people in his department didn't want to see him go, but just the fact that they were asking was starting to worry Harry. Would he really be fired over this? He had defended Draco Malfoy at his trial, but it had nothing to do with them being in love. But was the public questioning enough to have him fired, or forced into 'retirement' like Rita?
Harry didn't remember anything between that and feeling like he came out of some sort of trance in hospital wing. Hermione and Ron, were sitting on the bed, trying to talk to him. Their voices slowly became clearer,
"Harry, I know why you want to talk." Dean's started right away. Harry had written him a letter asking to speak, and later that evening Dean's head appeared in his fireplace. "I'm sorry. I should have stopped it right away. I didn't want to leave her there though. I was worried she might stitch herself if she tried to apparate home. Nothing really happened, but everything that did is all on me."
"Sure am, Potter!" They both laughed. Then they were quiet.
"Oh, thank goodness. I was worried you wouldn't like it. No hard feelings, right Harry?" This is why Neville must have been acting weird when he visited Hogwarts, Harry realized.
"Hasn't been too much to do lately, right? Well that's a good thing for your office."
"You're so stupid, Ronald. He
"Hello, dear." said Mrs. Weasley walking towards Harry. She smiled, but didn't give Harry his usually hug greeting. Mrs. Weasley was very conflicted inside. She loved Harry like her own son, but Harry had hurt her real daughter, her only daughter.
"Dumbledore was
"I believe you Harry." she said, turning back to her husband. Harry breathed a little sigh of relief. He thought for sure she would yell at him, but she just looked defeated. "And I don't blame you... for all of it. I wish you would have told me sooner, but I understand why you didn't. You didn't want to give up on our family. I did that."
"You're right." Harry said and paused to think before saying, "I think I have an idea."
"Finally!" Someone shouted. It was George.
"I did! I did!" Ginny cried over and over. She didn't understand why she was crying, she was mad at herself, she felt guilty even though Harry wasn't upset; he forgave her. She deserved worse for what she did. She blamed herself because she was the one who got herself drunk that night, without anyone there to help. She sniffled and continued on...
"So," Draco finally asked, "that's why you divorced huh? Little Weaslett couldn't deal with you anymore?"
"I could ask you the same thing, Potter.
Hermione didn't know what to say. Ron was her husband and Harry was her best friend; she hated when they fought. She knew Ron was being a little irrational when he didn't even know what happened yet, but she also understood how he felt. She didn't say anything for the time being, knowing Ron needed to just get it all out.
Albus pulled back to look at his father and wiped his tears away, "I'm sorry, dad. I shouldn't have gotten so mad. I love you no matter what."
"You are?!" said Ron quite surprised. Draco noticed Harry looked like he hadn't known either but it didn't bother him in the slightest.
There is silence before Albus finally finds his voice, "You're ok though dad. Right? You're not gonna... you'd never...?
Harry chuckled too, "Ya... well. You know..." everyone chatted happily but Draco didn't join in, he just sat there listening. Then the door opened a second time. In walked Percy and his wife Audrey.
To this, Draco had no words. He never thought about how saving Harry ended up with the defeat of Voldemort, which he was grateful for, his life was much better now. Most of his youth was something Draco wished he could redo, but there was no changing what's happened.
The kids were absolutely shocked, they had had a million different thoughts running through their head of what could be wrong but not a single one of them had thought of this. They all thought their parents were in love; they never fought and they seemed to be happy.
All of this was very confusing to Harry. Were they not mad at him? They had to be though. Harry was a father now, and if someone broke his daughter's heart he was be very upset. But it was also different with him and the Weasleys; they were like his family since he was 11, and he really didn't want to lose them. He was preying to himself that they were all going to forgive him once they knew the whole truth of what Harry put Ginny through.
Hermione, Ron and Ginny left a few seconds before Harry stepped out into the atrium full of reporters yelling over each other  and cameras flashing and people crowded everywhere anxiously waiting to hear what Harry Potter had to say.
Harry only heard snippets  "Harry" "ring" "just proposed" "Draco" as Draco grabbed the ring and put it on his own finger. He kissed Harry and then started showing everyone around him, talking about it was the most beautiful ring he had ever seen. Harry smiled to himself, watching the man he loved. Everything seemed to be quiet and all he heard or saw was Draco. He loved him so much. Then he was shaken from his trance as Ron and Hermione tapped him to get his attention.
Harry and Draco each had their own offices, but they shared a bedroom, which was quite spacious. Harry had always wondered where the teachers lived in Hogwarts. Their room was hidden behind a portrait and required a password to enter just like the Gryffindor common room. They had a king size bed and a large onsite bathroom and a little kicthenette. It was no-where near what Draco was used to living in, but it was about the size of Harry's apartment. Draco, surprisingly, didn't complain. They were both very happy to called Hogwarts their home once more.
James anger fueled again, "So you're hiding important stuff from us too?!"
"How did that come about?"
TRIGGER WARNING: talk of depression, PTSD, suicide
"It was never relevant." Portrait Dumbledore said, "And I was quite ashamed that my feelings for Grindelwald clouded my judgement; I let things get too far before facing him. After him, I never found myself in love again."
Harry and his two kids hugged and talked for a while. James and Lily told Harry that they had written to their mom as well. James felt a lot better now that both of his parents forgave him, and now that he had forgiven both of them.
Harry pulled Draco into the door on his right. As they entered, neither of them recognized the room. It had a couch and chairs in a living room like area, and a canopy bed towards the right wall.
Neville shook off the shock and then said with a smile, "I'd love to." so he, the Potters and the Malfoys headed back through the wall.
A few days after the kids went back to school, Ginny and Harry sat in a small office at the Ministry of Magic. There wasn't much to do since it was an amicable split and they each had their own incomes. After just a few short hours, a parchment, quill, and ink was laid in front of them. Ginny signed first, followed by Harry, marking the end of their marriage.
"Harry, we need to talk." It was late September and the all Potter children were at Hogwarts. Ginny walked into the bedroom she shared with her husband to find him sitting at the foot of the bed. She sat down next to him and let her eyes glaze downwards.
Harry didn't really like to talk about the battle of Hogwarts. I was a dark day, he lost a lot of friends, family even. He still blamed himself for not acting quicker. Maybe he could have prevented some deaths if he figured out he was supposed to die sooner.
"She asked me if you were alive, I told her you were."
"Harry!" Hermione.
"I'm doing ok mum, you?"
"Oh, I'm sorry Minvera, we could have-"
"Dumbledore's brother? I never knew Dumbledore had a brother."
The two roll onto the bed, fully naked, kissing and touching. Harry had never felt so good in his life. He never knew that this is what it was supposed to feel like. He felt more alive than he did on a broom.
Harry couldn't help but smile, everyone at the table seemed pleased as well, "Yes, I think it will be the right thing for me. After a year off, I'll being starting the following school year."
The next few days Harry barley spoke to anyone. He kept getting letters from everyone who vaguely knew him asking if it was true. Was he really gay? Was he dating Draco Malfoy? And people kept asking him if he was leaving his job. This was the second time in 6 months that Harry's ability to do his job was brought into question. Harry couldn't believe the ridiculousness of it all, and he was really getting sick of being questioned all the time.
Draco took them to his door. He could see the lights of a town not too far away. "Come on." Harry said pulling Draco towards the town.
Draco looked stunned, "But why?"
"Hey, Harry?" Neville said grabbing his arm and leaning in, "Can I speak to you for a moment?"
That struck a nerve with Ginny. "No! No he would never!" she said defensively.
After the kids went back to Hogwarts that fall, Harry and Draco spent the year traveling. They went all around the world, starting in Europe. Harry had barley traveled in his life, only going to the beaches in France for his honeymoon with Ginny and a few other places for work, but never for pleasure. Draco enjoyed showing him the sights.
The two adults sat in the seats across from the kids. Neither Harry nor Ginny knew how to begin, but Harry knew it was his turn to start. Albus had his arms crossed and refused to look at his father, so Harry turned to his youngest and eldest and started, "James, Lily, I have to tell you something."
"How did you know? About Malfoy and me, I mean?"
"Hello, Minvera."
But Harry answered simply, "It's time for me to lead a quieter life." turning to Draco and smiling. Although the reporters continued shouting, Harry didn't answer anymore questions on this. Still hand in hand with Draco, Harry walked off the stage.
Harry looked at Draco and Draco back at him. Then Harry leaned over and kissed him, long and hard. The men wrapped their arms around each other: Harry's hands on Draco's neck, Draco's fingers running through Harry's messy hair.
Harry looked up to his two friends. They seemed surprised but understanding. It was comforting to Harry to know they always had his back.
"I wish we had got to enjoy this together when we were in school." Draco said looking around at the cute, busy town.
"Then why did you marry my sister?" Ron said finding his voice. He wasn't yelling but he was still angry. How could Harry pretend to love and marry and have kids with his sister for all this time? But his question was soon answered.
"What do you mean 'problems', Dad?" James asked.
Harry took a deep breath, he knew he had to tell them the whole truth. They were family, they deserved it. "Actually... about that... there is something I have to tell you." He looked first at Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then George's confused face, then at Hermione and Ron who knew exactly what was coming.
"Ya." Harry smiled at him, "I love you."
Hearing the voices as they walked through the door, Aberforth raised his head from behind the bar.
"Ya, quite the stories I've been seeing in there. But I don't believe them, I know how much of what that woman writes is nonsense, used to feed her half of it." Draco and Harry both laugh.
"Hey, Neville!"
He thought back to everything that lead to this moment. From his childhood at the Dursleys, to his time at Hogwarts to walking into the forbidden forest to die (twice), he never could have imagined how happy he could be. He knew his parents must be smiling down. Harry hoped they would have accepted his sexuality, although he never really knew them, he couldn't imagine them not wanting him to be happy like this.
"I know! I just wish things had gone differently sometimes." Draco admitted. He couldn't help but think that was his fault.
The look on Draco's face, Harry wasn't sure if it was surprised? Happy? Confused? Disgusted? Draco got closer to Harry; Harry wasn't sure what he was about to do. But then Draco kissed him.
"So," Draco said now that they could talk, "We're alright then?" He thought so but he felt like he had to ask after how distant Harry had been before.
"Jeez, let the man breath, love. Tea, Harry?" Ron asks, gesturing for Harry to sit.
"What about Scorpius?"
"What are you doing here?!" Albus yells angrily. All he can think is: His dad. In Hogsmeade. With Mr. Malfoy. Kissing.
When he had finished, he felt as though a weight he had been carrying for so long, that had been getting heavier all the time, was finally lifted. Harry started to cry. He wasn't even sure why. Was he happy about finally being honest with himself and his family? Was he upset about hurting Ginny and the rest of them? Harry just buried his face in his hands and sobbed.
"Thanks." They both laughed again.
"It's been a bit hard with the kids, but Ginny and I hadn't been good for a long while. It was time."
"Just don't expect me to start using
Harry looked down into his tea. He couldn't imagine Hagrid of all people not accepting him. Hagrid had been looked down on his whole life for being different, surely he would accept Harry for his differences?
After Harry left Hogwarts from telling the kids, he headed to Hermione and Ron's. He wanted to go to Draco; Harry loves him but now he's worried he might have to leave Draco to make his kids happy. They had to come first. Why should he be happy if the price is making his kids miserable? Harry needed to talk to his best friends.
Charlie headed into the living room where Ron, Bill, George, Harry and Draco still were, "Sorry I didn't catch the broadcast, Harry. How did it go?"
His siblings followed him out the door and a bit down the hallway, "Albus? What's wrong?" Lily asked, seeming concerned.
It had been a few weeks since Harry and Ginny had their talk and they both didn't see any point in putting off the divorce or telling the kids any longer. Ginny had told her parents the same day Harry had talked to Ron and Hermione.
"Of course, dear boy." Despite both being adults for quite some time, sometimes they both reverted back to acting as if Harry was still a student.
They all felt beat, they didn't know what to do, but they all knew deep down there was nothing they could do.
"Potter?" he heard from the top of the stairs, "What are you doing in my house?" Harry saw Draco's head come over the railing. Draco said it in an entitled way, but his face looked happy to see Harry. He came down the stairs to greet Harry.
"How you doing?"
"You don't need to explain anything! You're with Mr. Malfoy!" Albus yelled angrily, then quieter he said, "You're.... gay."
"That makes a lot of sense." George said staring off into space for a second. Apparently this is the first anyone had heard of it, except Bill looked completely unsurprised.
Neither had Draco. The sex blew Harry's mind everytime. It was like discovering a new branch of magic he never knew existed. And they did a lot of it. But they also spent quiet nights in, and occasionally went out but were careful not to show any PDA.
"A bit shabby, isn't it?" says Draco, looking around.
Everyone was silent for what seemed like forever. When it was clear that Author, Molly and even George were at a complete lost for words, Harry launched into the explanation and apologizes about Ginny.
Harry sighed, he guessed it was time to really face the consequences.
He didn't want to believe it. Draco seemed so trustworthy. They were friends and after yesterday... Harry didn't know what they were.
"Your father and I are just fine." Molly said with a smile, trying to keep Ginny as ease. Arthur was working late tonight. "Come sit with me, love."
"They don't hate you, Harry." Hermione said trying to comfort him. "You're they're dad, they love you very much."
"Neville, we're good." Harry patted Neville on the shoulder. Just as Harry was going to turn back to Draco, he saw a Hogwarts student come through the door.
James was having a really hard time believing it. He always felt like he was very close to his father. How could his dad hide something this big from him? Why did he marry his mother if he was gay?
"Do you think they are getting back together?" Lily asked excitingly.
"Well I'm pretty happy how it worked out in the end." Harry said smiling at Draco, which cheered him up. "Plus I very much enjoyed tricking you from under my invisibility cloak."
Everything is quiet again. "Harry...?" Draco's voice broke the silence then trailed off.
Draco started to realize was Harry was saying. His eyes widen in shock. He wasn't prepared for this now, here. But he would have it no other way. Surprisingly, he didn't feel the need for some crazy big proposal. He loved Harry and hearing from him talk about how he feels about him on a beautiful day with their beautiful family, was the most prefect way Draco could imagine this to happen.
Harry silently looked to his feet. The Weasleys, along with most of his friends, still didn't care for Draco that much. Not only had he been so mean to all of them at school, but he was also a Deatheater, they had not forgotten that. But maybe Ginny would be ok with it, she never seemed to have a problem with Albus being friends with Scorpius. Either way, Harry had to tell her.
When they got home, they all sat down in the living room for a talk.
, but had used the other two. He does have depression, PTSD, and he did try to kill himself all those years ago. It was something Harry still didn't like to think or talk about, and now the whole wizarding world knew.
He wasn't sure if he was going to get it out if he didn't say it first. He took another deep breath and said, "I'm... I'm gay."
Albus finally stopped walking away but still didn't turn to face them.
Luna was the first to speak. "That's not your fault. You could've have worked that out. Harry is a nice guy, he would understand."
Minerva abruptly stopped talking. She looked from Harry, to Draco and back to Harry. She had a look like she knew exactly what had just happened, but she didn't look at all surprised by it.
Harry sat frozen, open vial in his hand in front of him. Before he could have a thought, he was hit hard in the back. The vial flew from his hand, and it's contents spilled out onto the forest ground with an acid-like 'hiss.'
"NEITHER DO I DAD!" James finally burst too, "I CARE THAT YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF A COWARD TO TELL US! TOO MUCH OF A COWARD TO TO GO MARRY SOMEONE YOU ACTUALLY LOVE IN THE FIRST PLACE INSTEAD OF MARRYING MOM!" James had forgotten everyone else in the room, that it wasn't just him and his dad. He looked to his mom now, she looked sad, and he felt bad for saying all that. He was still breathing very heavy, his heart racing.
"Perks of being the boss." Harry says with a silly smile, "I can take lunch whenever I like."
"Tea?"
"Alright kids, I'm gonna head back to my apartment. Ginny you're good getting the kids home right?"
The three kids went up the stairs on their own. When they entered then circular office, only Professor McGonagall stood before them. She wipped up five chairs, two in front of three, and told them to sit. They sat next to each other in a row, James, Lily, then Albus, and stared at the two empty seats before them. Then there was a crackle from the fire and it turned green. Out stepped their mother and next their father.
But if Draco wasn't playing with Harry then did that mean he fancied Harry back? Could 'the chosen one' and 'the boy who had no choice' ever really be... a couple? That thought was still foreign to Harry.
Harry couldn't even process what he just read, his mind still not fully in the present. He had been slandered more times than he could count at this point, but this... this was true. Most of it at least. Harry, of course, had never used
"I won't. I was wrong to. May I come in?" Harry hoped Draco would let him in. What if he didn't want to hear it?
Harry snapped back to reality. Draco. He had told Draco. He is the only person it could be. Harry had told him less than a week ago. And he had used those same words in the article when telling him.
Albus didn't want to talk to them. He knew the letter was likely from their father and he didn't want to talk about it with James and Lily. He got up to leave but his siblings still came towards him, they caught up to him before he reached the door.
"It's been... a struggle." Ginny said, unsure of how to go on, looking to Harry.
"About the other night–" Draco started.
"Same. Here," Draco patted the seat next to him, "Sit."
Harry was hit with a hug and his youngest son buried his face in Harry's shirt. "Al..." he started, but then he was surprised again when he realized Albus was starting to cry. Harry hugged his son back, "I'm so sorry, Albus."
Harry feels so guilty for keeping this from his son. He should have told him earlier, he should have told all of his kids earlier. He shouldn't have stayed in Hogsmeade when he knew his kids were here. He shouldn't have kissed Draco in public.
"So how are the kids? Hear from Albus lately?" Draco asked.
"Then why did you divorce?" She asked.
"But it is. Harry... I cheated on you." Harry was shocked by this, he knew his wife had started to realize something was wrong. He thought maybe she thought he was cheating. He never would imagined that she would cheat on him.
"Hogsmeade?"Harry asks, gesturing towards the village below them.
"Your mother," Harry continued, putting a hand on Ginny's knee, "deserves someone who can be there for her. Who loves her in a way that I can't."
"What is this place?" snickered Draco, hiding how much Harry meant to him was brining back his old bitchiness.
They kissed deeply, then their hands moved to their robes as they threw them off and then made their way to the buttons on their shirts. Harry moved his lips to Draco's neck as Draco titled his head back in pleasure. They made their way to the bedroom.
"I'm not sure how to say this, Harry... something just isn't right. Between us. And it's not because of your issues." She looks him in the eye, "Do you love me?"
"Ya, it belonged to my father, the only thing of his I own. Dumbledore gave it to me for Christmas first year." Harry told Draco as they walked through the town. They acted like children that trip: buying all the sweets in Honeydukes, checking out all the new prank stuff at Zonkos. Harry even bought a few things at Zonkos using the excuse that it was to show Ron and George what their competition was up to.
"You're on the school board?" Harry asked, he hadn't known that.
"Oh, its not bad... it's just... I'm gay."
Ginny didn't say anything, still just a bit surprised. "What about you and Neville?" Harry asked.
Draco jumped up and rushed to his fireplace, "Ministry of Magic" he said clearly, throwing the floo powder into the ashes.
When Harry got to his office, an owl was sitting there with a letter tied to it's leg. Harry took it off and read, Harry, Mum wants you to come have dinner at me and Hermione's with her and dad tonight. She won't tell me why but she's not going to take no for an answer so I guess I'll see you later. –Ron  P.S. Ginny won't be there.
"Well," Harry said as he reached into his robe pocket and pulled out a ring box, "I was going to do this today, but then Neville asked so I figured I would just wait–"
"I didn't realised until after we were married. As I explained to Ginny-"
"She never told you? Always thought she brag about it one day, 'if it wasn't for me Harry Potter would be dead.'"
"No, no, no, Ginny. It's not your fault in any way." Harry said trying to comfort his wife.
my hand." Everyone laughed and it actually brought some color to Draco's cheeks. Harry then turned back to the rest of his family, "But I have something else to tell you all about my future. As you all know, I have stepped down from the Auror's Department, but I'm not actually going into retirement. I am accepting the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts." Some people already knew: Draco, Ginny, Neville, the kids, and Minvera of course. But Harry had been keeping it a surprise from everyone else, even his two best friends.
"I would never do that to you... I..." Draco wanted to tell Harry how he felt about him, he just couldn't.
Ginny looked to Harry and shrugged, "I don't see anything wrong with you staying with your dad and the Malfoys." She said looking from Harry back down to her son.
and I became very close friends. Everyone thought we were dating, even my parents. Then we started to. It was a way to hide it from my parents, even though they didn't like her it was better than the truth. When Astoria started to bring up the topic of marriage, I finally told her, but it didn't persuade her from the idea. See, she knew she didn't have much time with her blood curse. She loved me, and I deeply cared for her, and that was enough for her. I made her happy and she liked the security. She wanted to start a family before she got too sick and I was willing to give her that. When Scorpius was very young, we both had other lovers, but as she got sicker and Scorpius got older, it was only I who was still bringing men home. There wasn't going to be secrets or lies in our house, I had had enough of that growing up. So we told him I was gay when he was older enough to understand. He took it well, but it probably still pushed Scorpius away from me a bit."
"Well, we hated each other, remember?" Harry said jokingly.
"Harry! You didn't tell us - well - congrats, mate." Ron said giving his best friend a big hug.
"Uh..." Harry didn't know whether to try to lie or not. What had Albus seen? Had he seen them kiss? "Draco and I were just getting a drink–"
"Ya... sorry about that." Harry said awkwardly. Harry had been a leader in the team at the Ministry that rounded up all the Deatheaters and locked them away and he actually wasn't really sorry about it at all. He thought they all got what they deserved.
"Scorpius?" said Draco.
Then more voices,
"I didn't feel like he loved me anymore. I couldn't take it anymore, I felt so alone. I just wanted to forget about it for a while. I meant it, we really did get divorced because we just don't love each other anymore."
Harry was surprised how well the Weasleys had taken it. Not just him being gay, but forgiving him for everything that happened with Ginny. Harry could tell they still weren't happy about the divorce, especially with the kids, but they didn't seem to blame him anymore. Harry felt like they should blame him though, after keeping it from Ginny all those years. Even though he didn't have it completely figured out, he should have been honest with Ginny how he was feeling.
"WHAT'S GOING ON IS THAT DAD IS GAY! AND HE'S DATING MR. MALFOY!" Albus just blurted out before he could stop himself, "Mom and dad both lied to us, that's why they got divorced!!"
The kids absentmindedly nodded, their minds elsewhere:
"So?" Albus said angrily. He was very bad at hiding his emotions.
Harry, James, Albus, Lily, and Neville all returned to the party shortly after; just in time for dinner. Everyone was talking and laughing, even Draco had slowly learned to relax around the Weasleys and was smiling as he chatted with George - the two seemed to have a budding kinship. When everyone was done eating and the table had been cleared, Neville stood up and quieted the table.
"No, actually," Harry said, standing to grab the dishes, "That wasn't even why." Harry grabbed Draco's plate as well and put them both in the sink.
Harry didn't realized how long it had been. He came out of his trance,"Ya?"
Together they answer questions about how long they had been together, and clarifying they were not at all involved during the Second Wizarding War or anytime prior to Harry's divorce. Harry answered questions about his sexuality explaining how he didn't realize he was gay until relatively recently. He answered questions on his mental health talking about his years of therapy and how the Minister was always aware. Harry ignored any questions about more of what happened in the forest during the Battle of Hogwarts or details on his suicide attempt: those felt far too private and difficult to talk about. But Harry had Draco by his side for all of it, and that gave him more strength.
"Oh!" Hagrid said. Then he looked like he was taking some time to process. In his head, Hagrid was trying to think of how he had missed this. But to Harry, it was just a long silence.
"I didn't want to tell you guys until you came back because I wanted you to have a nice honeymoon. I didn't think the press would get it this soon. I'm sorry I didn't tell you."
"Harry, what are you doing here?" Neville seems a bit off-put.
"Oh, Harry, I'm so sorry this happened!"
"She knows?" Hermione asked.
There was a quiet moment between them before Ron said, "I'm sorry it went this way, mate. Now, what can I make ya for breakfast?"
"No. You deserve to be happy too. I don't think we really have a choice." They both understood when Ginny meant. They needed to divorce.
Harry looked to Ginny and Ginny looked at him. They knew that the kids were probably going to ask at some point, but they hadn't really planned an answer. They both agreed that there was no reason to tell them about Ginny's night with Dean. Harry hadn't made up his mind if he was going to come out to his kids yet, but seeing all their faces staring up at him, he knew he owed them the truth and it was time. He looked to Ginny and gave her a small nod, she understood.
Molly Weasley put down yesterday's Daily Prophet on the table. She looked over at the clock on the wall and saw her daughter arriving at the house. Ginny walked in the door. She seemed to be holding up ok. Molly decided today she was going to get the whole story of why they divorced because her daughter had been so vague with her before. Ginny looked fine, but Molly was going to be careful, she didn't want to hurt her daughter at a time like this.
Albus felt bad saying in front of his mother that he preferred to stay with his dad, so he kept quiet. He hadn't really processed the rest of what this would mean for the family.
"Shut up, Malfoy." he cuts Draco off, and in two strides Harry crosses to him and kisses him deeply.
"Your wife knew? You knew you were gay when you were with her?"
George chimed in, "Gryffindors for life, right?" Just then the door opened and in walked Bill and Fleur.
"Oh. So... how are you?" Harry asked awkwardly.
"Thanks." Harry said and left the office.
"Oh none of that dear, you are officially family. Call me mum."
"Ok. Thank you." she said. Draco bowed his head a bit and then turned and headed back to Harry. Everyone was saying goodbye and starting to leave.
"Bloody hell, I'm right." Ron said, a bit out of breath.
George just shrugged and laughed. Harry smiled.
Torches were lit and everyone sat back down at the table to eat cake. As the cake was placed in front of Harry to cut, he stood with his glass; he hit a spoon against the side. "Everyone, before we eat this wonderful looking cake - thank you, Molly - I have an announcement."
Harry was in shock, he was just frozen for a second, but once he processed what was happening, he started to kiss back, but Draco suddenly pulled away.
"Well, thanks."Harry said.
"Dad's gay..." said James finally said aloud, trying to make himself understand what he had just heard. James looked to Lily, who wore the same blank shocked expression, to his brother Albus who was just looking sadly at him.
"That's what I wanted to tell you. I found out how Rita Seeker found out. When the article came out, I went straight to her office. Told her to tell me how she knew or I would tell the minister she's still an unregistered animagus. At first she tried to lied, but I eventually got her to tell me, and I know its true because I used Veritaserum," Harry didn't even bother to ask how Hermione got that. Smart Hermione probably kept some brewed for special occasions. None of them had really stopped being vigil after the war ended; they were always prepared for the worse. "She told me she used her old tricks again, using her beetle form, to spy on you. She was trying to get dirt on the divorce still. I assumed she must have been listening in on you and Ginny telling the kids."
"So, what did you have to come to the Ministry today for?"
"I think he's coming out of it, Hermione."
"It's Albus. He knows I'm gay. "
! I wasn't happy about you being with her in the first place but you're DIVORCING her after 20 YEARS of being married to her! You guys have kids together! What the BLOODY HELL did you do?" Ron yelled at Harry.
"No! No, Ron!" Harry said defensively. "I could never think of you that way. You're my best mate. Just because I'm attracted to men doesn't mean I like all guys!"
He heads down the hallways, this turn and that turn towards the shortcut to the dungeons. Harry thinks he's going the right way, it had been a while since he had all the passageways in the castle memorized. He turns a corner, and there, walking towards him, is Draco Malfoy.
"Ok," Draco said, "I'll see you later?"
Albus never wrote back.
"We love you guys so much, and we're so sorry we're doing this to you three." Ginny said, "But me and your father just don't belong together... anymore. None of you were a mistake, we both love you all dearly. You are the best things in our lives."
"Is that... alright?" Harry asked cautiously.
When the kids finally let go, Harry looked at them and asked, "Al?"
"You are? Who? And how did Al find out?"
"Are you sure? They are finding out I'm gay and dating Draco Malfoy. Do they really need to hear that you're dating their teacher?"
"Come in." Harry said without looking up; he was used to other Ministry members coming to him for things.
"I would like to say a few things," he seemed nervous but he was holding himself together better than he was in the bedroom, Harry thought. "Firstly, happy birthday Harry! Thank you for being one of my best friends in life, and thank you for letting me use this time to say something that has nothing to do with you."
The next afternoon, the day Albus told James and Lily that their father was gay, the two Gryffindors were sitting in the corner of their common room quietly talking about it. In fact, they had been talking about it since Albus told them that morning. They had tried to get more out of him after his outburst, but he ran down to the dungeons and locked himself in the Slytherin common room the rest of the day so they couldn't get to him.
Albus snapped back at his friend, "My father isn't getting remarried!" He was starting to realize that he never really accepted the fact that his parents were really divorced. In his mind, it seemed like they would just get back together one day. But he could see now that that was never happening.
"We need to talk, Potter." Draco said seriously, strongly masking how painful this was for him from his voice. He was very good at that.
"Ya, I knew." Scorpius said.
After Jame's quidditch career he went on to be a Auror, as did Lily. Albus, however, went on to become a healer, as did Scorpius who ended up marrying Rose. All the kids married and had their own kids, and lived happy lives.
"Take care of the kids." Harry says as he's leaving.
Molly then grabbed the sides of Harry's face with her hands, making him look at her standing over him. Harry looked into Molly's eyes for the first time since the conversation started, and in them he saw love and acceptance. Having Mrs. Weasley accept him was as if his own mother was.
But Harry happy agreed, "Ya, for sure."
He slowed down a bit and turned to Scorpius, "I can't believe them!" he said angrily, then quieter he said, "Our dads are gay."
Draco looked to Hermione standing with Ron, and knew that was where he had to start. Draco felt quite nervous, and hoped he would be able to get it out before she punched him again or Ron tried to make him eat slugs again - this time he was quite sure Ron would be able to do it. But just then Molly pulled Hermione into the kitchen with her to help prepare dinner.
"She never told me," Draco said looking down at his own drink, "She doesn't talk about the Dark Lord at all anymore. She'll speak of dad and where he is, but never why he's there."
He apparated back to what was now Ginny's home, gathered his stuff, and then headed back to London the muggle way. Harry had gotten a muggle apartment in London, a short walk away from the visitors entrance for the Ministry. His fireplace was connected to the floo network, but sometimes he preferred the walk through muggle London. Harry liked being in the muggle world now sometimes; there he was no one, just a regular guy. He wasn't the chosen one, not the boy who lived, not  the wizard who defeated Voldemort, and not a man who cheated on his wife.
When he looked at Draco, he was staring down at his plate, "Thought about doing that too back then, back when we were still in school."
After Ron yelled for a good 15 minutes, he seemed to be finally calming down. "You're right, Ron, you're right." Harry started, sitting down in the chair in Ron and Hermione's living room.
"So... Draco," Luna was the first to directly speak to him as everyone was wrapping up, "Why don't you tell us all how you and Harry came to be?" She asked with a smile. Suddenly everyone else at the table quieted their own conversations and turned to Draco; they all seemed to be interested in the same thing. Hermione and Ron were the only ones Harry had explained it to.
"But dad I thought we could come stay with you at the apartment." James said.
"So. How ya been 'Arry?"
"Are you alright?"
"Uh... Draco and I were just getting a drink–"
This shocked both of his siblings into silence. Albus felt bad he had blurted it out, but it had been bottling up inside him for the last day, and he couldn't contain it anymore.
When he opens the door, Professor McGonagall is sitting at the desk writing something. "Hagrid told me you were coming today, when I saw you head up to the castle, I told the gargoyle to let you up when you came by." She says, putting her quill down and looking up at Harry with a big smile.
"Percy and Bill and Charlie and their wives are all coming home for a big family dinner tomorrow, just us Weasleys." George said to Ginny trying to lighten the mood a bit.
"An old friend's place. The kids shouldn't find us here."
Ginny's face broke back into that huge smile as she giggled to herself and turned back to Neville. "I thought you'd never ask." She said sarcastically before grabbing his face and pulling him into a kiss. The whole table cheered.
Harry apperated to Ron and Hermione's house after work. Inside was Mrs. and Mrs. Weasley, Ron, Hermione and surpirsingly George. George, Harry had already spoken too, and while he wasn't happy about the whole situation, he didn't seem to be taking it out on Harry. Bill, Percy, and Charlie - has had heard through Ron - were very protective of their little sister, and not knowing at all what happened, were completely blaming Harry. Harry was thankful they weren't here right now. He was thinking he was probably going to have to come out to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, and he wasn't sure if he could have done that with the whole family here.
"It hasn't. We met up a while ago by chance. We were just friends. We'd grab lunch occasionally." Harry felt weird telling them about the near-daily letters they wrote, looking back it seemed more than just friendly. "Then the day the kids went back, he came for dinner. We were talking about the conversation Ginny and I had with the kids at the beginning of the holiday." Ron and Hermione already knew about what Harry and Ginny had told the kids about (supposedly) why they divorced.
He and Ginny were married that winter over the Christmas holidays. Neville wanted to do a big wedding, Mrs Weasley was more than happy to. Although Ginny wasn't too fond of the idea as she had done it once before, she obliged understanding it was Neville's first time getting married. They had it in the beautiful, large space decorated with the most beautiful plants. After their marriage, Ginny sold the house in which she had raised her kids with Harry. Ginny and Neville wanted to have a space that was their own, so they got a cute cottage not far from the Burrow with a huge garden. Neville now came home to Ginny every evening through the fire in his room at Hogwarts instead of sleeping at Hogwarts.
"Oh, well. We met up in Diagon Alley one day too. He was there buying some fertilizer for his plants. We had lunch together and caught up. He was a great friend to me and helped me through our divorce. It wasn't long until our feelings for each other became obvious." She paused and then looked at Harry, "We should probably tell the kids about Neville and I too."
Nearly everyone Harry loved was standing around him in the Weasleys' backyard: Draco, the kids (including Rose, Hugo, and Scorpius), Ginny and Neville, George and (a now pregnant) Luna, Arthur and Molly, Minerva, Hagrid, Teddy, and Ron and Hermione. Everyone was talking, laughing, drinking, smiling: it was Harry's birthday. Harry looked around at the family he had gained over the years since coming into the wizarding world and smiled. He only wished he hadn't lost so many people on the journey here.
It wasn't until over a year later that Harry told anyone else. He told Ginny, Mr. and Mrs. Wealsey before he proposed. He thought Molly and Author should know before they gave their blessing to marry their daughter, and Ginny of course deserved to know who she was marrying. But they all told Harry it was ok. They already knew he had been really struggling, so it alarmed them, but it wasn't unbelievable.
Harry could see Draco's normally icy grey eyes were a warm grey. He just knew, even though he had been so worried that Draco didn't mean it or it was a trick, he knew in that moment it was all real. And Harry felt the same way about him.
Harry just laid in the dirt, even after Ron had gotten off of him to go stomp on the vial, crushing it to make sure every drop was gone. Hermione and McGonagall rushed to his side. Harry felt nothing. His mind completely blank. His body completely numb. Voices sounded like they were coming through a bad radio signal. His eyes stared into the darkness of the trees. Everything went silent, and there, at the edge of the clearing, he stood in his dark robes. His white face and his piercing red eyes. He raised his wand, pointed at Harry.
"We both love you so much. And I'm sorry we're doing this to you guys, but you have to trust us that it's for the best." Harry said.
A few minutes later, Charlie walked in. "Hey mom!" he called out. Again, Molly rushed in to hug and kiss her son, this time taking a bit longer because she doesn't see Charlie as often as the others. "Well I had to come see Harry!" he said once his mom let go. His mom looked angry, "And I wanted to see you too, mum!" Mrs. Weasley stopped pouting.
"No. Lets go, Scorpius." and Albus turned to leave.
Then he looked up again, this time at his other two kids who were by their mother, "I love you all so much." he said and James and Lily joined him in a group hug. He kissed the top of their heads, even though James was nearly his height now.
"What are you talking about, Potter?"
Harry and Draco taught them both. Draco, in addition to teaching Charms, took up teaching the Alchemy class at Hogwarts the years when there was even students to fill it. When the previous Head of Slytherin house retired, Draco took his position as well. He even helped Harry teach Occlumency to the NEWT students since it was the one thing in Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry never mastered. Harry was finally able to teach Draco to produce a patronus, his happy memory being his and Harry's wedding day. It took the shape of a doe, matching Harry's stag, just has Harry's parents' patronuses. When Professor McGonagall retired, Neville become Headmaster. Harry took his spot as the Head of Gryffindor house and Deputy Headmaster.
"Delicious as always... Molly." Harry said awkwardly. Sometimes Harry would call Molly "mum" but that didn't feel appropriate right now. Mrs. Weasley didn't seem to take notice what Harry had called her.
From not far away, Scorpius pipes up, "Aren't you come back to our place?" he asked. Harry was frozen for a second and looked to Draco who was blushing hard but said nothing as his son continued, "You were staying there weren't you?"
Harry knew he just had to say it. She deserved to know the real reason and know that it wasn't her fault at all. "I think... I think I might be gay." he said, glazing at the ground.
"Our teacher mom! Really?! What is with you two?!" Albus yelled to his parents.
Harry sighed, he wasn't even surprised anymore. He wasn't mad at Albus, he blamed himself, "I would say I'm a worse parent still."
The two men sat down to eat the meal Harry had prepared. It actually wasn't bad, and Draco didn't make any complaints.
Harry turned back to Minvera, "Professor, could I ask you something?"
Ginny looked nervous. She wasn't ready to tell anyone what Harry had told her, that was for him to share. However, she didn't feel like telling her mum about that drunken night either. She had no good reason, and she didn't think her mom would understand that they just didn't work together after over 20 years of marriage.
It was starting to get dark, so it was prefect when Molly brought out the cake with candles. Everyone sang and Harry blew out the candles. Just as he did, Ron and George set off fireworks that printed "Harry Birthday Harry" across the sky.
"I guess I kind of knew for a while–"
"You know, I'm still not sure. Maybe I fancied you, Potter." he laughed at his own joke.
Draco continued to listen. He didn't push the subject, but it felt good for Harry to talk about it with someone besides Ron and Hermione. After spending time with Draco these few months, he  really felt like he could trust him, so Harry went on.
"No, see that's the thing, one of my father's old friends in the Ministry told me someone - someone important - vouched for us. Couldn't tell me who it was though."
"I'm going to have to talk to them. They'll understand eventually." Then Harry pulled Draco close and kissed him for the first time in days.
"Of course not! I would have told you." Scorpius says.
"It's time for everyone to hear the truth from you." Hermione said putting a supportive hand on his shoulder.
"But dad- can't you just get better? Can't you just go see someone and fix the problem?" James said angrily.
Everyone was quiet for a second and then Lily spoke up, "Dad, did you really cheat on mom?"
Harry looked up and saw Hermione. She gave him a 'I told you so' look, Harry looked back down at his son, "I love you so much, Al. And you had every right to be mad. I should have told you. "
"That alright?" Harry asked,
Hagrid seemed to snap back into it, "Alright? 'Course it's alright! I love ya just the same 'Arry. Makes no difference to me." He said with a large smile.
now, as he said, "And I didn't quite plan to propose tonight after that, but someone kind of
"Well what about having my own office at Hogwarts?" Harry asked.
It wasn't until after dinner that the divorce was brought up. Mrs. Weasley said, "So, dear, what happened with you and Ginny? You always seemed so happy." Molly, of course had already heard a bit from Ginny, but she was anxious to hear Harry's side.
Ginny sat down at the table next to her mother. She noticed the newspaper, "Ugh! I can't believe the papers got it already. Someone in the Ministry must have leaked it. Don't read the crap that woman writes, mum."
"Come on," Draco said when they had both eaten their full, "leave the mess for tomorrow."
All day Thursday, Harry was excited that Draco was coming, but he had gotten wrapped up in his work when he heard a knock on his office door.
They met Hermione, Ron, Ginny, George, Luna, Molly and Arthur back in the room Harry had started in before the press conference started.
"No, no. It doesn't have to do with that." Harry said, his eyes to the ground.
Ginny's eyes widened in shock. She knew something wasn't right, she knew he didn't really love her, but she had guessed there was another woman, not a man.
Then Harry and Albus went back to their old home and spent some time with Ginny, James, and Lily; Neville was also there. This is when Harry told them all about taking the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. Neville was very excited to have his friend teaching at Hogwarts with him. The kids however, as predicted, were a little apprehensive. Professor Longbottom was becoming apart of their family, and now their dad was going to be a professor too. James, however, was upset that he would never get to be in one of his dad's lessons since he was going into his seventh year and Harry wasn't going to be taking up the position until the next year. Lily and Albus we're upset, but rightfully cautious about having their dad around school. Albus got excited though when he realized that he dad would be there just in time for his owl year, and surely he would prepare him well. Lily was going to have to have him for the longest, but she was also the least troublemaker in the family, so she didn't have as much to fear.
James, Lily and Albus learned to ignore all the stuff around their father. They knew he was perfectly fine, or so they had thought. What their father had told them had surprised them all. Harry really had done a great job hiding it from his kids. James was the only one who could remember his father showing any sign of his troubles. When James was young, he used to like to sneak into his parents bed at night. His father would mumble in his sleep and sometimes wake screaming into the night. After Harry had woken up from a nightmare to see little James looking up at him for the second time, he told James he couldn't sleep in Mommy and Daddy's bed anymore.
he thought.
"I know you don't really think that." Ginny said in a lighthearted way.
Harry went right home to what was now Ginny's house. He hadn't even told Ginny he was seeing anyone and now he was going to have to tell her everything. At least he knew now that she had moved on too, that made it a lot easier. Harry cared more about Ginny being happy than himself. He still blamed himself for all the years she lost with him when she could have been with someone who really loved her.
"We know." James said without looking his father in the eyes. He couldn't bare to. He didn't mind throwing Albus under the bus because he was pissed about how he told him and his sister. How he didn't tell them right away. How he yelled it to them in the hallway. But James was even more pissed at his father for the lies and secrets that how seemed to be never-ending with him. James thought he knew his father, he was slowly realizing how wrong he was.
Albus was in shock, "You knew your dad was gay?!" he said in a loud whisper, there was no one around them but still, "What about your mother?"
"WHY WON'T YOU TELL US?!!?" James yelled now into the empty hallway at his brother. "WHAT'S GOING ON?!?"
Harry blushed and felt the warmth run through him and down into his pants, but he didn't acknowledge it. "And you're a dragon,
Arthur got up to give his son a hug too, and then followed Molly into the kitchen saying, "I'd better go help now before I get yelled at."
"I do believed he's changed, I just never expected..." she trailed off still in utter surprise.
"I'm sorry, Harry. Neither did I."
By the time Harry kissed his children goodbye back on platform 9 & 3/4, things felt at least semi-back-to-normal with James, Lily and Albus. With all the commotion, however, he didn't see Draco on the platform that day.
Harry put on a cup of coffee and soon Draco emerged from the bedroom with his usual bedhead. Harry was quite surprised when he had first seen it, since he was so used to Draco's slicked-back hair. The spiky, messy hair had reminded him of his own, and as he saw it now, it made him smile. As he watched Draco rub his eyes and yawn, he knew that he was one of very few people, if not the only person, that got to ever see Draco this way.
"We told them it was because of my PTSD and depression." This is one of the few times Harry had said those words aloud, and with Draco is was surprisingly easy.
Ron was still staring blankly at Harry.
He knocked on the door and Ginny answered; good thing she was home from work. "Ginny... I really have to talk to you."
"Debatable."
"Harry, Ginny didn't really want me to tell you quite yet, but I need to." He took a deep breath, and continued. Harry couldn't help thinking about how much braver Neville had become over the years. "Ginny and I have been seeing each other. And I want you to know, and I want it to be alright with you, because you're my friend, Harry."
"Well I don't have many friends." said Harry, opening up, trying to level with Draco. "Besides Hermione and Ron of course, but they're married so it's different now, you know? And not being married to Ginny anymore, I go home to an empty house too."
How could Harry have forgotten to tell Hagrid! Harry wrote back at once:
"Heard about the divorce." said Draco.
"No. Lets go, Scorpius." and Albus turned to leave.
But Draco wordlessly stepped aside and let Harry in. They sat across from each other in the living you.
"So, here's how it's going to work. James," Harry said turning to his eldest son, "You are going to stay in Albus's room."
As Harry exited the Room of Requirement, his hair was a mess and he was still buttoning his shirt with his tie hanging over his shoulders, when from around the corner came Professor McGonagall.
"Thanks, Mum."
"What? Go somewhere there? I meant real privacy, Potter." Draco said with disgust in his voice.
They both leaned in and kissed each other, and just as they did, the bell above the door rang and it opened. Harry and Draco looked up to see Albus and Scorpius staring at them.
"Dad," she said as calmly as she could, but there was still the hint of anger in her voice, "I don't care that you're gay, but I can't believe you didn't tell us. Did mom know?"
Ginny gasped, "Really?!"
"Just when it seemed like everything was perfect, you always have to mess it up." Ron said sarcastically. They all giggled as the mood lightened.
"Good morning, my ferret." Harry had taken to calling Draco that.
It had been a few days since Draco had come for dinner and Harry hadn't heard from him. He wanted to write him a letter but he didn't know what to say. Draco had
"Great." Albus said sarcastically and turned to leave.
"You can't blame yourself for this, Harry. You had your reasons for not telling the kids. Hell, I don't know how I would if it were me." Ron said putting a supportive hand on his friend's shoulder.
"Yes, our marriage was more of a partnership. After the war, Astoria
In Brazil, they found a snake that spoke to Harry, asking him about his scar. The young boa constrictor said his father told him a story about how a young boy with a lighting-shaped scar could speak to him and freed him from the zoo in which he was born. The snake knew from the moment that Harry spoke back, he had found that boy. The snake grew quite found of Harry and Draco and decided to stay with them, becoming their pet. The snake was named Slytherin of his own choosing after hearing it in stories about Hogwarts.
"What did happen with you two?" Draco asked, "Don't worry I won't go running off to tell Seeker!" he said with a smile.
Harry woke up to a tapping sound. At first he got distracted by the beautiful man still sleeping peacefully next to him, but the tapping continued up he looked up to the window to his his eldest son's owl. He got up and opened the window and let the owl in. He untied the note from it's leg and read:
, and Harry
"Albus!" Lily called out. Albus had to stop now, it would be weird if he didn't. She was holding the letter in her hand and James was right beside her. "It's a letter from dad."
"Ya, I was never too happy about that. I didn't go home from Hogwarts because I didn't have a good home to go to. I actually found it a bit insulting at first when Albus told us he was staying. But, in the end I get it. Hogwarts is fun over the holidays. Plus I don't think those boys want to be apart."
Meanwhile, Ginny ended up becoming Head of Magical Games. She had moved to the department following Harry's retirement from the ministry since she was so fed up with The Prophet after everything it published about her ex-husband.
"He was there. When I wasn't. It's not your fault; it's mine. You just wanted to be loved, and you deserve to be loved."
"Partly, I think it was that and I think it was a lot of denial." Draco felt like he could really open up to Harry now. The only other person he ever felt this way with was his late wife, but that had been so different. "I didn't want to like you, I didn't want to be gay, I didn't want anyone to find out that I was gay or that I liked you, and to be quite frank, I was always a bit jealous of you."
"Blimey Harry! And ya didn't tell anyone?" Bill didn't seen mad, in fact he was laughing to himself a bit.
When Draco is right at the edge of the platform, he smiles up at Harry and then climbs up onto the stage. He plants himself right next to Harry, who was just frozen. All the reporters were waiting anxiously, Draco performs
"Because I want this to work. I want you." Draco finally admits. He felt like he should be honest with Harry. Draco was never really open with anyone in his life, but he knew he would have to be  if he wanted the golden boy. "I've always wanted you. And I'm not used to not getting what I want."
At first all Harry could think of was the Aberforth could tell that they were
"You cooked?" Draco said looking around the kitchenette.
"I just came to see Hagrid. How are you?"
For a moment Harry thought about lying, but he didn't see the point. "Ya." he said.
"Unless he has done something terrible to you Ginny? Like maybe... cheat?" Molly asked looking at her daughter.
Lily was wondering the same thing. She was worried about mom, did she know? She and James had been asking each other these questions all day, but neither of them knew the answers. Then their prefect came up to them and they fell silent.
"Yes, oh Harry, I'm so happy for you guys!" Hermione said before almost knocking Harry over with a very big hug.
When Harry leaned back he saw the surprised look on Neville's face. "Really, Harry?" Neville asked. Harry nodded. "So... you don't still, or I mean... have feelings for Ginny? I mean, thanks for telling me–"
"Eh, haven't been doing much. With my wife gone and Scorpius at school I'm all alone in the house. I see mother sometimes."
"No, it's ok. It's for the best, really."
Hermione pushed Ron down to sit down on the couch. "Let him speak, Ronald."
Eventually the topic changed to the kids, and so on to other things, how their lives have been since those old days. Both men had much more fun chatting and laughing about things from Hogwarts than they ever thought they would.
"Well I guess it's a good thing you got me as a friend now, Potter."
"The kids wrote back," Ginny said, "They understand why you're doing this, but they still seem upset." she said sadly. The kids had not written to Harry since his last visit to Hogwarts. Ginny had heard from them, and they all are ok with her and Neville. However it seemed like Harry being gay was harder to swallow. "At least we could give them the heads up this time." Ginny said.
"Enough!" Said Ginny and the kids all quieted. "James you are staying in Albus's room and your father will be staying in your room. End of story." Ginny sounded more and more like her mother as she got older.
There wasn't much more conversation before kids all headed back to their dormitories. They didn't say anything to each other as they walked down the hallways, but there was an unspoken bond between them all now that was stronger than it had ever been.
"YOU THOUGHT!" Ron yelled now that he had air again.
"That sounds really lonely. " said Harry. He actually felt quite bad for Draco. "You don't have any friends?"
"I think it has to be." Harry agreed, "I'll stay, if you want, for the kids. You can see someone else–"
Lily wanted to cry, but she also wanted to be strong like her brothers. She loved her parents so much and now they wouldn't be together anymore. She couldn't stand the idea; she wished she was having a nightmare, but she knew it was real.
"Ya, well. It was unexpected for me too."
"Neville," Harry leaned in to his ear and whispered, "I'm gay." It was getting easier to say it all the time. At this point, Harry had told most of the people he trusted, so he was fine sharing it with Neville.
Harry heard Draco mumble something under his breath that sounded like "muggle-lover." Same old Draco.
Harry looked wide-eyed at Draco. Draco also looked amazed. They looked at each other and then broke into laughter.
Harry eyed him suspiciously but didn't comment.
"I saw you dad!" Well that answered that question. Scorpius stood silently behind Albus looking to his father.
"Yes, his class should be over by now."
"Harry!" Hagrid said excited as he opened the door to see Harry standing on his step. "Cum in, cum in!" He eagerly ushered Harry inside.
Harry was very tempted to reply 'I didn't know you could read' but then he remembered that Draco didn't know that Harry knew about that time he said it to 'Goyle.'
"Why didn't you identify me at the manor?" He didn't even have to say anything more about that day. They both knew he was talking about the time that snatchers had brought Harry, Hermione, and Ron to Malfoy manor while they had been on the run destroying horcruxes. Harry had a disfigured face and Draco was asked to identify him so he could be given to the Dark Lord, but Draco didn't.
"But you've eaten the whole thing!"
from the kitchen, Ron must have been just as stunned as Hermione and dropped the tea cup.
"'Ello Harry!" said Mr. Weasley with a wide grin. Harry awkwardly smiled back.
After they were done cleaning up, Draco found Hermione talking to Ron off to the side. He took a deep breath and walked up to her, "Could I speak to you for a moment alone, Granger?"
"You have to do something, Harry. You can't go on like this." Ginny said concernedly, "It's not good for you. You've been doing so well with your depression lately, I don't want to see this send you into a tailspin."
Draco wrote to him, asking him to come over, but Harry wrote back saying he was too busy with work. It pained Harry to lie to him; he still loved Draco. Just a few days ago he had told him that and everything seemed prefect, and now it all had come crashing down.
Harry remembered these tooth-breaking treats from his youth, "I'm good, thanks."
When he reaches the large gargoyle, it immediately jumps out of his way, which Harry thinks is odd. He's used to it remaining frozen until it was given the proper password. Harry heads up the staircase and knocks on the door, "Come in," he hears from inside.
"Ya, ok." Harry said, looking back at Draco but stepping up to follow Neville to a different table. "What's up, Neville?"
They both ran to him and gave him a big hug. It felt so good to Harry after this past week, well really this whole year, of tension with the kids. Harry looked up and saw Minerva smile at him and then she left them.
to do. Whatever I fancy that day. Taking long strolls in the garden. Visiting mother. Reading, sometimes."
"Hiding from our kids." Harry says without thinking.
. There had always been something about Draco, but Harry, maybe because he was so much in denial about his sexuality, or maybe because he couldn't bring himself to believe that he actually fancied his enemy, had always refused to let himself think about Draco in that way.
Harry laughed to himself thinking about Draco writing this letter himself– how much effort it would have taken him to write "Hope you are well." He couldn't believe this was the same boy he knew in school. Seeing or hearing from Draco used to make him miserable, now it was making him smile.
"It's no ones fault but that bloody Seeker woman's!" Ron said angrily.
"Is it bad?" Lily asked, still seeming more worried about her father than annoyed with her brother like James was.
After his visit with Hagrid, Harry decides to take a walk around the grounds. He hadn't been here much since the Battle of Hogwarts. All the good memories of this place were clouded by the deaths. That's why he couldn't bring himself to finish his 7th year after the war was done.
He stepped up onto the podium,"Sonorus!" Harry said pointing his wand at his throat and his voice spoke above all others, "Thank you all for being here. I've gathered you here today to clarify some things about me that were recently in the press." Harry took a deep breath, "It is true that I have in the past, and in lesser ways continue to, struggle with my mental health. And I have done so since the day I defeated Voldemort." The whole room winced but people knew that Harry Potter always used the name.
Harry felt like it owed it to Ginny to explain everything to her. "I've never cheated, Ginny. And I didn't always know. I never really paid attention who I liked during school; I didn't have much time to. I thought I liked Cho for a bit, but looking back I think it was just a mix of her liking me, me thinking I was straight, and her understanding my grief about Cedric."
Hermione mumbled, "Kind of?" under her breath. She still hadn't fully forgiven Draco for everything he had done to her and his part in helping Voldemort. She was never fond of the idea of Harry's son being friends with Draco's.
When Harry got a return letter from Hagrid saying that that worked and that he was looking forward to seeing him, Harry wrote to his kids to tell them he's be at Hogwarts, just so he didn't catch any of them by surprise. The next day he apparated right to the gates of Hogwarts, then made his way up to Hagrid's hut.
"Dad?" Albus and Scorpius both say in surprise in unison.
Harry took a deep breath and continued, "I knew you always had feelings for me, and after the war, we just made sense together. I loved you like family, and I thought what I was feeling for you was what love was supposed to be. Our lives were so hectic, and by the time things started to settle down, we were married and already had James and thinking about having Al. I couldn't think about not loving you. But the more time that went by, the less I could deny it. For a while I thought I might be bisexual, but recently I've realized I don't think I am. I don't know what else to say. None of this is an excuse for what I did to you, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Ginny. I never meant to trick you."
"Did you know... I mean did you ever guess that I might be..."
"Albus?" said Harry.
Their arms wrap around each other, holding each other close. The men's lips don't part when Draco pushes Harry into the couch. It isn't long before Draco reaches for the tie and buttons on Harry's shirt. As they make their way to the bed, clothes are thrown in all directions.
These thoughts distracted Harry so much that he hadn't gotten much done at work. He was sitting at his desk, lost in thought, when an owl swooped in.
"Hey, Potter!" someone from down the Slytherin table called, "Have you seen– your dad's in the paper again!" he snickered holding up the morning's edition of the Daily Prophet.
"Not here Malfoy!" Harry said in an urgent whisper, "What if the kids are around, or anyone else for that matter!"
Harry just nodded, he was trying to process, Dumbledore had been gay, he had been in love with his enemy, who was once a friend. Harry looked at Draco and couldn't help but see the parallels, only the other way around. They were enemies, then friends, and now... he looked at Draco who was looking into his drink, also lost in thought, and Harry knew he loved him.
"On in five." a Ministry worker said peaking his head through the door. Harry was in a small room off the atrium in the Ministry of Magic with Ron, Hermoine, and Ginny.
"I've made so many mistakes" Harry said burying his head in his hands. "This," Harry said shaking the paper, "is my fault. If I had just told them all sooner, Albus wouldn't have been yelling it in the hallways."
"I know, I know. I should have lost hope when you two got married. And if she's not married to you and still doesn't want to be with me, then it's definitely time." Hearing that from Harry, that Ginny really didn't have any feelings for him left, helped him cut the last string of hope.
"Thank you." Harry said and the man left.
Harry was reasonably sure he’d heard something similar before, but he was feeling peaceful and calm and he didn’t particularly want to try to remember where. “I’m sure you’re right.”
Late that night, Harry found himself sitting at the desk in his bedroom alone. Ron and Hermione were attempting a date night at a Muggle Gastropub, apparently. He was enjoying the quiet, the music on his record player, and debating asking Arthur Weasley if he knew a trick to make a television work without electricity. And he was turning a beautiful twig around and around in his hand. There was something very powerful about the thing. Powerful, and pretty. It was only about six inches long, too short to be a wand, really, but…
“No,” Harry said. “I’m no bloody good at it. And I’m a disaster, you know that. Not right in the head, and that was even before the war. Now I’m even more rubbish at things. And I — and he — I’ve mastered the art of a dirty weekend, but he’s really not the sort, and anyway, I don’t want that.”
. I need to bring you to my mother for etiquette lessons.”
. He liked his hair longer. The bit that always stood up was heavy enough now to stay down, and though he wouldn’t have admitted it out loud, he thought it made him look rather rakish.
“Fuck off,” he replied, without looking up.
This was the sort of rivalry they should have enjoyed at school. This was a better sort of feud. They shouted at each other across the sky, daring each other to dizzying heights of sheer idiocy; bragging and taunting and hurling vicious insults, almost skimming the top of the lake and making hair-pin turns of the sort Draco hadn’t even attempted since he was a seeker, about a thousand years (and one war) ago.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said, rushing across the room to wrap her arms around him. He felt smaller, having lost a little weight and perhaps some muscle tone, but he held her tight.
is old,” Harry was explaining. “She’s a Muggle castle, but very fit for purpose and the charms are coming along well; much bigger on the inside than on the outside, now, and we’ve disillusioned her. And do you know, I think she’s starting to wake up. I didn’t think it could happen that quickly. Another year of work and we’ll be able to start taking students. Just the senior years, at first.”
Harry ran a slick finger around Draco’s hole, and Draco made a keening sound.
was put to bed.
— that if he reached behind him, he’d find the door handle. And he did.
Harry laughed uncomfortably. “See, I don’t even know how to —”
“Oh, I turn all kinds of wise when I drink. Really, I’m like Yoda, or some shit.”
Granger let out a sigh of relief, and immediately made as if to leave. “Thank you. I shouldn’t stay, I need to make arrangements.”
“Meet you at the Grey Goose in an hour. Try to dress like you don’t have a broomstick up your arse, Malfoy? You might get lucky. Look like you could use it.”
He heard a whooping, and thought for a moment that it had come from his own chest.
“Potter,” Draco said. “Please try to avoid tossing any of your petty, vengeful hexes my way for making the observation, but you look absolutely dreadful.” Before Potter could react, Draco had snatched the list from his hand and pushed the door closed behind them both. He looked over the list, gesturing for Potter to follow. Halfway to the supply closet, he faltered a step.
It was barely satisfying, lasting only a couple of minutes, and afterwards, despite the relief — Harry felt sad.
“Did you manage to eat anything?”
Luc. Luc, dressed like… that. Feeling neglected, perhaps.
“You’re hardly the only one,” Harry promised.
“Oh, shut up,” she said, reaching for the Floo powder with a smile on her face. Real and warm, if not as wide as his own. “Let’s just get this over with.”
It wouldn’t have been accurate to say that Harry had hoped he wouldn’t wake up. But that didn’t change the fact that now he was awake he had no idea what to do with himself. He had sat in the armchair in the bedroom for at least an hour when he woke again, wondering what he should do; every time he heard Draco move around in the rooms beyond his own he felt a rush of anxiety. Back in the world, but not ready to be back in the world. He was in limbo. Staring out of the window at the spring afternoon and wondering if he could actually put himself back into that safe, comfortable place in his mind, all alone with his thoughts.
He was sure. He was still sure. No matter what Professor McGonagall said.
Not fair, not fair. Harry didn't know Draco. Not the real Draco. Only the one... well only the one who had taken up residence in his head a long time back and never really left, fuelled by... but Harry wasn't ready to think about that. “Beautiful. Really. Are you sure…?”
felt when he focused all of that attention on them. But I didn’t think he could ever trust me. Not as
If his hand ever
He was pacing, scrubbing his hand through his hair. More agitated than she had ever seen him.
“I have to get back,” Harry said. He looked younger, by firelight, the grey in his hair lost to the highlights that flickered with the flames. “I have work to do. It’s important.”
“It’s not clothes, that Mistress is hiding in here?” he asked, suspiciously. Hermione opened the envelope instead and passed him the letter.
“Once I was at Hogwarts, I found a new family. I didn’t need you to know about the old one. You knew I didn’t like being there; that was enough.”
. It’s fine;
With short, spiky blond hair and very pale skin. With dark makeup smudged all around his eyes, and tattoos questing up from the neck of his t-shirt. Harry dropped to his knees.
“Merlin’s liver-spotted arse,” Ginny said suddenly, her eyes lighting up. “Harry has a bloke here. Is it anyone we know, Harry?”
Harry looked to have been hypnotised by the flames again, but Hermione knew what it meant when those tiny lines bracketed the corners of his mouth. He was sad, and not just sad; he was, once again, accepting the loss of something he’d never been sure he could really keep anyway. Like when he’d lost Sirius, and then Remus. Even Hedwig. Whenever someone shoved a photograph of his parents under his knows. Like when things hadn’t worked out with Ginny.
He never did get around to changing into pyjamas before he fell asleep.
“Did he say why?”
Harry was not expecting
of that.” Harry laughed, but the laugh was hollow and humourless. And then, nothing. Harry stood leaning against the beautiful old chest of drawers and Draco’s expression hardened into a mask of professionalism.
“Harry,” Mrs Malfoy said, and Harry shook himself alert.
“Draco,” he murmured, under his breath. He immediately regretted it; what if Draco heard him, and looked up? But the place was much too loud, and Draco was much too absorbed, testing his tuning in the four seconds he had before the singer started shouting incomprehensible lyrics into the microphone, and then he was off again.
“I haven’t asked you yet,” Harry answered, drily. “I’ll get the curry. You can eat or not, it’s up to you. I thought you might need a wand.” He gestured at the boxes with his free hand. “I remember the resonance of your —”
The first week or so, Harry felt he was managing quite admirably. Pepper-up potion and coffee seemed to keep him going in the absence of good quality sleep.
Draco gave her a half-smile, and even with that unfamiliar face pasted over his own it was a distinctly Malfoy half-smile.
“You must know Peregrine Derrick is the most indiscreet man in the whole of Britain. I cannot believe you shagged a

to do terrible things. And it was a long time ago. No one has forgotten. But most have forgiven. They’ve found a way to, because it helps them to feel better.” She shook her head sadly. “Harry — I feel like it’s been a hundred years since you’ve been really happy, and I don’t remember you doing anything for yourself since you gave up Quidditch. If you have a chance to be happy now, and you don’t take it — I’ll…”
“You can be free elves,” Hermione said. “You can earn money.”
It seemed to take a very long time for the cauldron to fall, which did give Draco enough time to Summon it slightly so it didn’t splash Amelia. That did, unfortunately, mean that it splashed all over his hands and over his trousers as well, some drops hitting his face.
. Despite the tiredness and the shaking hands.” Harry wanted to say something sharp in response but Draco’s expression suggested that this was familiar territory for him — a Healer, who would ever have imagined that — and that he wasn’t being scolded like a mortal enemy but jostled along like any other pig-headed patient.
No one was interested in letting eleven-year-olds duel.
“Then why didn’t you ask for lemon, Harry?”
No, he did.
“Did you sleep well, Professor Potter?” Draco asked, reaching for some fruit toast and marmalade. Harry almost choked, which was gratifying.
This was not a conversation he thought he should be having. Not with her. But since he couldn’t have it with Draco, there really wasn’t much of a choice.
Harry and Draco stood awkwardly on the landing for a few long moments, after the green flames disappeared. They returned to the kitchen, where Harry packed up leftovers and Draco ran the sink full of water. Harry said nothing about that; he was rubbish as those domestic charms, and besides, he’d never minded doing the dishes. Silently, Draco washed them. Just as silently, Harry dried them. When they were done, and the kitchen was tidy once more, Draco gave Harry a weak smile. It didn’t meet his eyes, but it was a smile.
, Draco.
“No need to be too precious about those,” he’d say. “Roughly chopped is fine; they’ll disintegrate in the heat very quickly. Press the side of the blade down hard against the seeds and it will be easier to slice them up. No, you’re not julienning those for a coleslaw salad, Harry, you’re shredding them. It needs to be rough to get the oil out.”
“A gift from a fan.” Malfoy sounded like he was trying to make a joke, but he was obviously in terrible pain, and Harry realised at once that he had a fever. The object in his pocket looked, for a moment, like a simple crystal ball, quite lovely at a glance. But the oiliness of the dark magic writhing inside it was very far from lovely. Even through the dragon hide gloves, Harry felt it reaching, reaching —
“She’s been through hell and back,” Draco said, in the end. “I’m going to bed.” He sat up, and rubbed his eyes, and forced himself to his feet. What he really wanted to do was lie with his head in Harry’s lap and talk to him the way they’d talked in Harry’s head, but he couldn’t. He had just reached the stairs when Harry called out again.
“I’m sorry I missed Christmas. Mum might never speak to me again, but I just —”
“I know where to find you if I need more of that sort of colour commentary, Zabini. Much appreciated, et cetera. I don’t particularly care how good an Auror Potter is. My job is to figure out why he’s playing possum in the middle of his own psyche. But thank you for your pearls of wisdom. Who do I have to shag to get a decent cup of tea around here?”
Harry cringed, and explained, as he wandlessly levitated the pot and the cups to the table, searching for a plate for a couple of biscuits. “So I need a new wand, and it needs to be… I don’t know. Better suited to me, I suppose. I don’t know why it’s been so difficult. Since my first one broke…”
Standing at the Floo, well after midnight, Ron stuck his hands in his pockets.
“Merlin’s bollocks, Potter — have you been
“Certainly, Professor Malfoy.” Harry chewed on his lip. “We must be mental. Can you really picture me at a pub with Pansy and Greg?”
her roll her eyes. “Are you going to tell me why Draco Malfoy is your house-guest?”
She turned when she heard the door open, and felt a rush of gratefulness when Draco stepped through, dropping his Glamour when he saw who it was.
“Ask him back, and tell him to bring a couple of friends. Make him the boss. That elf might be a thousand years old and quite possible demented but he knows this house better than any Witch or Wizard that has ever lived here could hope to. I can’t imagine he’s been happy being sent away.”
“He’s gay?”
they’d say, faces impassive, bored
. Harry’s line in these situations was that he was an artist, that he explored wood and how it might be juxtaposed with other sorts of tissue. Also, part of his process was no one could see any work in progress.
“Well, do we start with sex, or breakfast? Are you hungry?”
“You know what I hate about you?” he said to Emrys, as they sat at a beautiful and very tiny table overlooking the cliffs where Draco’s home lay.
There was something so appealing about Draco’s mouth when he swore.
“Well,” she said, taking off her heavy coat and hanging it on the rack. “Ron and I will start lunch, then. I hope you’re hungry, Draco.”
“I love you,” he promised. “And in here, I think you love me, too. That’s why I can let go. I don’t need anything else. After all of this… I got
The hourglass trilled too soon. Harry looked up, seeming as startled as Draco was, and with some reluctance stood up to add the final ingredient. He didn’t even wait until Draco was watching. Perhaps he wasn’t rubbish at potions anymore. Perhaps Draco had unnecessarily helped the first time. Perhaps —
Draco tried not to blush, and a few minutes later, a cup of tea appeared on the table. Thank fuck for small mercies.
“Perhaps for the same reason you showed up on my doorstep in the rain,” Harry murmured, and the subject was dropped.
“Very well, thank you,” Harry lied automatically.
you reading?”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said, and she sounded so sad Harry couldn’t look at her.
“And then?”
Draco disenchanted his window and looked out not into the fake starlit sky, but the lake. Glowing an eerie green, seahorses galloping their way across nothing at all, manes and tails flying out behind them. He heard the low sound of the giant squid somewhere in the distance — when it displaced enough water, there was a sound almost like a trumpet in the lake. Draco sat on the windowsill and looked out into the murky depths for a long time, trying not to think about it.
“The Portrait of my great-grandmother Lyra Malfoy moves faster than that,” Draco shouted, across the water.
“I am? I mean,” he corrected hastily, “I am. What am I right about?”
“I’m not going to be able to brew your dreamless sleep tonight. Not like this. So I need you to come back here and let me talk you through it. You can go, now, Harry. I’ll rest a while; I don’t have classes this afternoon and I’d like to sleep a little. Thank you for your assistance. Goodbye.”
“Narcissa, please.”
“I thought you were rich!”
She nodded, but seemed disinclined to elaborate, so he returned to his study.
“We’re the Burnt Lips,” he said, and the drummer started.
“Because,” Harry replied, thinking of Ron, of Hermione. “Because I think it will be fun.”
Draco looked like he was searching for something cutting to say and then his shoulders dropped minutely. “Better,” he admitted.
Harry shook his head, and took a centring breath. “No, please. I need you to be Healer Black, just for a little while.” His hand flexed, and Draco found himself hoping that Harry was struggling not to reach out just as surely as he was. “And then — later — I’ll want to see Draco. If he wants to see me.”
Draco poured himself a glass of Firewhiskey. He wasn’t in any sort of state to slip into Harry’s dreams tonight anyway. He spent a long time rubbing the potion into Harry’s skin, and speaking soothing nonsense. This weekend. This weekend, Harry would wake up. Draco would draw him out of his self-imposed prison and he would at last have the chance to start to rebuild himself.
“And you didn’t tell me because…?”
“I didn’t have much of a demand on my time other than work. It was a way to pass the time. I don’t know. The focus was good practice. I don’t have accidents anymore. You know — accidental magic. Except if a nightmare is especially… anyway. Or at least… not as often.”
“I wouldn’t bet against you,” he said at last, with a laugh.
. I saw it every time. So I hid it, instead. It was all I could really do. It’s all I’ve ever really been able to. Hide who I am.”
“Fuck, yes,” Harry said, stepping closer and reaching out.
There was a long moment of silence, and then Harry and Hermione burst into riotous laughter.
“You really shouldn’t apparate in this state,” Harry said, chuckling. “Come in and use the Floo.”
pleased with himself.
When he finally did, his last thought was that if Draco Malfoy had indeed changed, Harry would have liked the chance to get to know him. But it was too late. Malfoy was gone, and Harry sincerely doubted that he would ever see him again.
“Worse. I’m planning to rat you out to
Draco stepped closer. Harry didn’t seem to respond. Not with anger, not even with the tell-tale tension that usually seized his shoulders when he was distressed. Draco sat tentatively on the edge of the bed and reached for Harry’s hand, but Harry drew into himself and Draco stopped trying.
Hermione waited, and then poked him in the ribs with a very stern finger. “Go on. You’ve been in your head all night, Harry. And don’t try to tell me you didn’t love our gift. You do know how rare a foe-glass is, don’t you?”
“I wear robes all day.”
Potter turned away, and Draco followed him across the classroom to the door. The lock on it was a secret one that Draco had invented himself, knowing how students liked to pilfer ingredients. He slipped the lock with a non-verbal incantation and a jab of his wand, and opened the door.
The guests began to leave, alone or in pairs, returning to children who would be waiting to set biscuits and butterbeer out for Father Christmas, and by nine o’clock, only a small number of guests remained in the parlour, enjoying Narcissa’s less divided attention, and evidently hoping for a chance to ask about Draco’s ‘new friend’. Music played and the hearth was warm, and the overindulgence of wine had the remaining guests looking rather soporific.
She didn’t look deterred.
, Potter!”
Hermione moved her chair closer to the bed, thoroughly chastised. She took Harry’s hand in her own and watched his chest rise and fall.
Hermione felt bitter tears blur her eyes.
the wrong way; but I’m struggling to think of any reason why I should trust you. Do I actually need to remind you that you hate me?”
Draco smiled widely. “You were?”
Harry snickered. “I can’t imagine being bored, but as I have no idea where you’re going with this, I’ll just pretend I’m sat here waiting for you to say something a humble Auror can understand.”
Draco help out his pinky. “Promise.”
It felt inhumane to leave him like that, even if he did seem to want to be alone, so Harry transfigured a small armchair into a much bigger one that could be stretched out almost flat. He reasoned that Draco had, after all, asked for help.
’? Or ‘
“I think I’m still off my rocker,” Harry said drolly. “But I’m not sure that was new. I’m — I shouldn’t be here. Malfoy wants me to stay. A few months, he says, or a few weeks, at the very least. Hermione, I can’t. I —”
“But there was this… I mean, at school. I told you he had an enemy, right? Only they were sort of obsessed with each other. Sometimes it seemed like…”
“What I don’t understand is why you think I could possibly do any better.”
“A little.”
“I will,” she promised.
“I am simply quivering with anticipation,” Draco said, leaning against the door jamb as Potter slipped his robes over his ridiculous Muggle nonsense.
“Nice to see you again.”
“It’s real,” she replied, quietly. “Hullo, Kreacher.”
“I know the type,” Draco said, with a conspiratorial roll of the eyes. “So, no partner.”
“I’m not interested in… courting,” Harry said, spluttering, humiliated. What he meant was he wasn’t interested in a bride. “I get a dozen marriage proposals a week from witches I haven’t even met. I certainly don’t… what are you doing?”
One evening Harry apparated to Diagon Alley and walked to Weasleys’ Wizarding Wheezes, stopping from time to time to share a very awkward minute or two with stranger after stranger, all of whom had opinions about his health, his decisions, and him in general, and many of whom wanted to take a photograph with him. But he found himself at the shop, in the end. Summer holidays, and the place was full of children dragging exhausted-looking parents around. Ron looked up from the counter, and his whole face lit up.
“We hurt each other,” Harry said, holding Draco’s eyes. “I’m not sure I’ve ever found way to express how sorry I am about that.”
“It’s beautiful,” Draco said, awed. He gave a little wave, and sparks filled the air. “It feels so different.”
“Is Master Potter being back from his mission? Can Kreacher fetch tea?”
Draco waited.
closer, actually.
The band appeared as the lights went out, to be replaced by the typical strobing, flashing, colourful mess, and the lead singer (who had to be the focus of Lucas’s lusty gaze — well, fuck it, plenty of fit bodies in here tonight) grabbed the microphone, bringing it close to his face.
“Did I startle you?” she asked.
“I don’t have one of my own,” he said, trying the note to the leg of a school owl. The little boy had an owl of his own, and Harry was surprised to notice it was an Australian Boobook owl.
“I would like to accept the position, if you will accept my resignation.”
“Where do you think Malfoy is right now?” Harry asked, idly. Neither of his friends answered. He hadn’t really expected they might.
“There’s only one way to make me stop,” Draco snarled. “Fucking… Gryffindor idiot. You’re so fucking brave — show me. Show me how brave you are. One more time, Harry, and then you can stop, and you never have to be brave again.”
It was easier to give in to tears from time to time knowing that every single other person did the same thing, and just as often. Harry didn’t think he would ever quite believe the day that he’d find Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode comforting each other in front of the fireplace, and sharing painful memories. And Blaise Zabini continued to be a git, but it turned out that he was a kind, funny git, quick to laugh or notice when someone needed something.
The bottle topped up both of their glasses, and Draco turned the potion in the cauldron seven times, with a silver knife, watching as it turned a shimmering silver.
“Flattery will get you approximately six inches.”
. When all of this was done, that was something he would hold tight to his chest and think about.
“Happy birthday, Harry,” she said.
Draco was struggling to avoid feeling…
“Limoncello,” he said. “It’ll curl the hair on your balls, see if it doesn’t.”
“I know what you did, Malfoy,” Harry said. “You hexed her, didn’t you.”
“No war.”
Hermione closed her hand over Ron’s, and smiled proudly at him.
Draco moved lower, biting gently at Harry’s clavicle, and soothing it with his tongue; landing teasing kisses on his hard nipples until Harry started making some sort of demanding noise, low in his throat.
“Come in,” she said, holding the door open. And then, to the guards, “Healer Black is to be treated as a valued guest at all times. Ensure that message is received across the entire division. Now, as you were.”
“Alright.” He ate the strawberry. Procrastinating, if only for a few seconds. “Do you think that there is any chance that this — this home that Harry has built in his head for the two of us is there because he has feelings for me? Or once did?”
,” he murmured, waving his wand over the page, anxious and frustrated at once.
“Not the sort?”
Dinner was exactly the raucous affair that Hermione had anticipated. She hadn’t yet told Ron that she was engaged to Blaise, and as nervous as Ron still seemed to be around him, he managed a very enthusiastic handshake, an equally enthusiastic hug (to Blaise’s horror and Hermione’s delight) and an assurance that he was well up to the task of arranging a Bachelor’s party. And then a long, awkward moment where Ron apparently remembered that it was generally the job of the best man, and that he didn’t have a clue who Blaise’s friends were; and then, thank goodness, Gabrielle being her usual delightful self, easing everyone into a slightly turned-on stupor for just long enough so that they were abe to gather their wits again.
Harry crouched by the bed, examining Draco’s face more closely. He didn’t seem to be injured, but Draco had always been better at low-power, high-focus spells such as those needed for healing than Harry ever would be. Maybe he had been injured. Maybe he had healed himself and then come here, though Harry realised he hadn’t seen Draco’s wand.
Mrs Malfoy closed her eyes for a long moment, and then opened them again.
last time that Harry had laid eyes on Hogwarts was the day that he sat the last of his N.E.W.Ts. That year had been painful, and exhausting, and the castle had not been what it was. The number of students was half what it had been at its prime and there was mourning on all sides. Some animosities had grown and others had vanished. Harry had struggled with nightmares and flashbacks and the lingering maladies sometimes suffered by those who had experienced the effects of hundreds of curses and hexes and that annoying little death he’d experienced.
“I have no moral code anymore,” Harry agreed earnestly, his eyes wide. “If that doesn’t work, I have a list of ideas in the pocket of my robes.”
It was a stupid question.
of May, 1999, the first anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts. It wasn’t a good night, and no more needs to be said about it here.
Perhaps he’d sneaked down the street to buy pastries, but Harry didn’t think it likely. Perhaps he’d gone to visit Pansy or Blaise? No. It was that time of the morning when Diagon Alley was just starting to get busy, people lining up at apparition points, calling hello to their neighbours. Smaller children were being herded off to nursery school. Draco wouldn’t have left while the streets were that busy.
. This was the influence of Malfoys).
“Please trust me.” Draco turned his wrist, and held Harry’s hand tightly. “I’ll do an unbreakable vow, if you want.”
“I think my bollocks have crawled back up, I’m so cold,” Draco said. He was glad he’d remembered gloves, but his fingers still felt as if they might be frozen to the broom.
Malfoy showing up at the home of his sworn enemy and asking for help isn’t the weirdest thing that has ever happened, and I’ll be eternally grateful.”
Draco wanted to say;
Harry sat up, and frowned, and looked at the envelope. “What does it say?”
Professor McGonagall murmured “
Blaise nodded. “I’ll come by in a few days with some booze. The honey liqueur I started last year is bloody fantastic.” He hesitated at the Floo as if he had something to say, and for a second, Harry remembered what he’d said to Hermione, so long ago;
Draco closed his hand around Harry’s cock, and his own, rubbing slowly and torturously — no way in the seven hells was he going to hasten this.
. And anyway, I didn’t say it was Draco.”
“Of course not. It’s been over for all of two days, and I’m too stupid to remember anything from that long ago.”
When Harry was suitably attired, he carefully pulled the object from Malfoy’s robe pocket, and stared at it. “Where on earth did this come from?”
— and staring in abject terror at the dragon in front of him. Pain shot through his skull. No, worse than pain — a rush of memories, each more hideous than the last, running backwards until the moment when Harry Potter’s named had appeared from the Goblet of Fire.
“Just for a few weeks. But I don’t think he’s ever forgiven himself for that. I don’t even know if I have ever forgiven him, quite. But Harry wasn’t even angry. All he remembers is that Ron came back.”
“I’m exploring my sexuality,” Harry replied, innocently. “Remember how it’s all my Mind Healer’s idea? Well, there you go. It’s therapeutic.”
In late August Harry stepped out into the courtyard to hand Draco a mug of coffee. Draco flashed a smile at him, teasing the purring cat with her sardines.
Draco felt that now-familiar wave of anger threaten to peak again. He ignored it. He had a job to do, and if he had more than one set of interests to deal with then he would deal with them. “You want him back. In the professional sense.”
“Do you really think I don’t know you, darling?”
“Yes,” Draco replied. “Just one thing more. And then you can wake up. You don’t need this place. You don’t ned to pretend. You’re so fucking strong. You know you are.”
“I don’t know why you’d do that,” Harry said. His voice sounded very, very distant, and very tired. “I thought we were having a good day.”
The bright spot was watching Neville and Luna. Harry tried not to do it for too long, but Neville shot him a delighted glance from time to time. Luna was wearing the most colourful dress at the whole party, unsurprisingly, and didn’t seem to give a whit that the other girls were looking down their noses at her for it.
“You’re shagging Harry Potter in his dreams?” Blaise said, at long last.
“Potter,” came the voice, strangled and ill. “Help!”
“Or the… Four-wizard Tournament,” Draco said, feigning disinterest.
“Listen, before I forget. Part of my process is a little mind-reading. No, not… well, it’s like that, but really, I take a dip into someone’s dream. And last week a strange thing happened with Auror… with
under his breath. “The green is the things he’s talked about that never happened, or that happened differently.” Draco tapped his finger. “You and Ron getting married and having children. Cedric winning the cup. Graduation.”
Ollivander shuffled into the workshop from the kitchen.
“No,” Harry said. “Bacon’s better anyway.”
“I’m tired,” Harry said, and he rested his forehead on Draco’s shoulder. “That’s why I sleep so much. Isn’t that okay? You told me. You said I needed to take better care of myself.”
“Every door in this house, every window, and a few… extra spots — they contain something that Harry doesn’t want to think about anymore. He’s locked them up, and now he’s pretending that they’re just not there. His life is precisely as he wishes it, so long as he doesn’t have to think about the things that he’s hidden away.”
“Satisfied?”
“No,” Harry said, firmly. “No, I…”
“He woke me at six o’clock this morning. Said he didn’t want to leave again without saying goodbye. I thought we were friends, Potter.”
Harry blinked several times. “Because it’s all I’ve ever wanted to be. I want to help people.”
“I’ve tried to free him. If I offer him clothes he runs away and sulks for weeks. I’m barely here — he keeps it clean, mutters about his Mistress… I’ll ask him if he wants to come with me, but I expect he’ll just insist on staying here. He’s over three hundred years old, Hermione, he’s not about to change his ways. But... every year he takes flowers to Dobby’s grave. I expect that’s the most character growth I’ll ever see. And honestly — that seems like a lot.”
This time, though.
that Draco could seek out? Harry’s life, so far as Draco could figure, was one fucking nightmare after another with very little rest in between, unless one chose to count his rapidly approaching demise. There had to be something else.
Harry seemed to take a long few moments to reply.
“Before I begin, I want to ask a question of
“Nonsense.”
to hear this, every word of it. She needed to hear it all and then examine it in a pensieve until she could figure out how it fit in with everything she knew, or thought she knew, about Draco Malfoy, the littlest Death Eater.
“Thank you, Madam Shacklebolt.”
Draco made an appalled noise, but poured himself a cup anyway, and took a sip. Harry was right; it was nice, and also, it tasted like grass. Would wonders never cease.
“Yes,” Harry said, holding his hand over the wand, feeling the magical signature.
“This is Lissie,” Draco said. “Lissie, this is my friend Harry. He’s a Professor at Hogwarts, same as me.”
After they had eaten, in near-silence, Harry crossed his arms over his lap.
“Look, it says here he freed all the elves, and wants Hogwarts to consider taking them on as employees.” Ron was shaking his head. “He’s
“Thank you,” Hermione said again, and if she thought Draco’s breath might have hitched for a moment, she was too considerate to mention it.
Harry sighed in relief. “Fine.” He stood slowly, as if he was still exhausted, and Hermione thought he probably was. “Can I invite Ron around for dinner? I just want him to know I’m alright, and apologise for worrying him.”
Hermione’s expression was unlike any that he’d ever seen on her face. Honoured, and tired, and grateful, and in pain. The glorious tapestry of being human. He didn’t regret that he’d said things that hurt her to hear and that seemed like an incredible breakthrough all on its own.
In the first week of March, Harry helped Andromeda and Teddy to move into Grimmauld Place. She’d said
“Do you remember the Tri-Wizard Tournament?” Draco asked.
After dinner, as Ron pressed a hand to his stomach and told Hermione that he was thinking about marrying Harry instead of her, Harry poured them each a second glass of wine.
He felt something prickle the back of his neck.
Harry leapt to his feet, tea and toast forgotten, helping her into the chair next to Ron’s.
Harry spun on his foot, hand ready to wandlessly disarm his opponent, but it was Draco.
he been Draco, and not Malfoy?
“Potter,” he spat. “What in fuck’s name are you doing here. Back to following me around?”
He carefully cast the diagnostic spells. On waking, Harry had thrown off the last of the stasis spells, and everything else was returning to normal. His heart rate wasn’t what Draco would have liked. A little thready. But some food, plenty of fluids, and getting up on his feet soon would all help with that. There was damnably little research on the recovery process for people who had managed to wish themselves into a magical coma, though Draco was already planning to write Harry’s case up for publication — with his permission, of course, and carefully distorted so that no one would ever gasp into their freshly delivered
“Malfoy — what the bloody hell are you doing here?” Harry asked, annoyed now.
“Oh,” Hermione said. “Headlights are —”
He cast a light Glamour.
More friends than Harry could count. More than he wanted to count. Counting those present meant counting those who had died. One of the many reasons Harry never liked to celebrate his birthday. Somehow, celebrating it several days late made the hurt less.
“I’m going to go to the funeral,” Harry said. “I don’t expect you to come with me —”
A familiar hand settled on Draco’s shoulder and gave a gentle squeeze. He didn’t look up, but he tore his gaze from Potter’s.
And he could feel it — the way Harry wanted that too. The pull of his magic, the way his skin sang. The frustrated little murmur when he chased the kiss a second time and found Malfoy had stepped away. The set of his jaw, the quickening of his breath. But he didn’t step closer. He didn’t reach out, or smile, or tease. He looked, in fact… quite miserable.
“I want you,” Harry said, evenly, but there was something vaguely threatening about his tone which made Draco’s cock twitch, and the hair stand up on the back of his neck. He stepped in front of Harry, hands on the balustrade on either side of his hips.
“And you were upset. You’d been crying. I can’t remember for the life of me why it was, can you?” He chewed on his lip; it really didn’t matter. Funny thing to forget, though. “You told me to fuck off, but I didn’t. We talked a while, and you said something unconscionably rude about me staring at your mouth — maybe you asked me if there was something between your teeth. So I kissed you. The end,” he said, tightening his arm across Draco’s back.
“Draco. I haven’t seen you in a month. What’s happening?”
“Then can you picture meeting me and Ron at a pub?” Harry laughed, but there wasn’t a lot of mirth in it.
“You called me Draco,” Malfoy said, and Harry felt his face flush. Malfoy opened his eyes. “What time is it?”
He made his way to the Great Hall, watching as it filled up with children. They seemed to be younger every year; it was impossible for Draco to imagine he had ever been so small. Even so, he felt a warm surge of protectiveness.
“He brought Kreacher to the Ministry — did you not know that?”
“I don’t know how you ever forgave me for leaving,” Ron said. “I don’t think I ever will. I don’t think Hermione ever could.”
“I just mean — do you think, when someone’s survived what we’ve survived, that there’s any chance they can be normal one day? That there will ever be a choice that isn’t influenced by the war? Because I’ve tried. And I don’t think so. I don’t think I can be.”
Harry threw his arms around Draco’s neck.
“Sometimes I wish I didn’t have feelings at all. I remember when I was young, wishing I could be as poised as Father, as cold. I practised, you know. Looking in the mirror and trying to keep my expressions off my face. I thought I could do it, if I practised enough. Keep myself secret, the way Father did. And then the slightest thing would happen, and I’d lose my temper, or I’d get frightened, or I’d laugh until my sides ached…”
Draco laughed, quietly. “I’m in love with a patient. An ex-patient.”
Harry nodded dutifully, his hand still wrapped around Draco’s mother’s hand, his green eyes still so wide. The large bed, with its soft coverings and thick blankets, curtains around it — was that not a bit juvenile, Draco had thought at first, but now he saw that Harry liked the idea of being able to close them around him to sleep, as if he was back in —
“I learned the bat-bogey hex from Ginny, and I’m not afraid to use it,” Hermione said flatly. And unnecessarily; they
Upstairs, he summoned the teapot and the tea, wandlessly, thoughtlessly, and when he looked up again Draco was looking at him with hunger in his eyes. Very poorly disguised.
“It’s Sunday,” Harry said, a few minutes later, settling himself on the windowsill beside Draco. Draco didn’t respond. “I’ll be heading for lunch at the Burrow. I thought — I thought you might want to come with me.”
The advantages Harry had over Draco were significantly reduced by the fact that they had agreed that there would be no wandless or non-verbal magic; after all, it
Draco hated to admit it, but there were good things about his father being dead.
“Is she trying to get away from your endless complaining? I can relate.”
“It was.”
There wasn’t a potion or drug in this world or the other one that he hadn’t drunk or snorted or smoked. Not a single taste he refused himself. He told himself that he had done one thing and that was enough. Never mind the way he started struggling to look at himself in the mirror. His own fucking reflection staring back at him like he was a profound disappointment, if not great surprise. He numbed himself with sex and sleep and food.
Harry
“Yes. I — what?”
When Potter was gone, Draco sat watching the fire for a few minutes longer, letting himself think, and remember. And then he went to bed.
“There’s one idea,” he said. “It’s mental, but… remember the Chamber of Secrets? When we went down there. There were passages in the back. Where the Basilisk hid. You remember?”
Draco stared at his glass. He didn’t want to have this conversation. He’d very carefully skirted it for several hours with Neville fucking Longbottom only days before, though Neville had read him as easily as if Draco had written the truth all over his face.
“I need an elf,” Harry said, at breakfast one morning. With a crack, an elf wearing a woollen hat and socks appeared, chattering away happily at Harry. Harry beamed at her and handed her a package that had just been delivered by a huge tawny owl. An enormous heart-shaped box, wrapped in bright red paper and decorated with pink and white ribbons.
“Kreacher,” Draco repeated, frowning. “Oh, Kreacher? He’s still there, in Grimmauld Place? He’s about three hundred years old, Harry, he’ll think you’re trying to force him into retirement. Don’t torture the poor thing.”
Draco didn’t need to hear any more. He stepped through the wall again. Harry had carefully arranged himself so he was lying down without putting too much pressure on his shoulder. Light seeped through the slats and patterned his face.
“Sucking up,” Harry said, shrugging. “I guess. I can’t believe I fell for it all. If he’d come in all cocky and hit on me I’d have tossed him out on his arse. So I’m the idiot here, I guess.”
Draco thought about the cupboard under the stairs. He remembered the bruised shoulder, the tiny boy dragging a stepping stool to the kitchen sink, his eyes glazed, ignoring his pain. Basilisk venom and dying in the Forbidden Forest. All of those rooms in the house with no windows; no, Harry hadn’t had the easiest life.
Harry just stirred and stirred, tossing in a few extra cherries when Molly was pretending not to watch him.
Harry had decided that Sirius’s room was the one he wanted for himself and now that it was clean and repaired and the carpet had been replaced, he was glad. Sometimes he felt — or
“What did you have in mind?”
“Go ahead,” she said. Draco turned to Blaise.
He didn’t like the way they looked; he never had, really, and he didn’t know why. He wore jeans and t-shirts beneath his practical Auror robes as often as he could, and he always had. Sometimes he wore a suit, if the occasion or job required. He hated formal robes, but for this particular occasion, they did seem appropriate.
“So we’re talking about your comatose patient.” Draco nodded, focusing on the moody water over the cliffs. “I had wondered. You did cancel a few of our sessions.”
,” Draco said, simply. “And I want a lifetime of them.”
She closed the door behind her, and turned to Draco.
time right now,” Hermione answered. “Give me five minutes.”
November was colder than usual. Colder than anticipated. No snow — there was almost never snow this early — but there was cold rain, and sleet, and hail. Harry closed the shop. It wasn’t the time of the year to buy wands, and anyone in need of a replacement sent an owl to arrange an appointment. Harry was happy about it. It had been some time since he’d been able to truly bury himself in work; the workshop was a riot of wands in various states of unfinished, and Harry was working on a new wand of his own, as well. Holly, slightly springy, 13-1/2” long, core of Hippogriff feather.
“Ah, look at that. Japanese Sencha. Lovely. Perhaps I’ll put on a pot.”
“Then I think it’s you,” she said, climbing to her feet, a little flushed. “It must be you. You’ll keep me updated,
“Well. It was too late. And by then Draco wore the Mark as well, and I believed we would all die. If we’d left, I am sure he would have killed Draco and Lucius. If we stayed, we knew we had only the slimmest chance of surviving. It
Draco looked sad, and there was no sad in this house. No thinking about work. Just love, every kind.
Hermione came very close to giving a very snippy — and highly revealing — retort, but she bit her tongue.
“You know,” Harry replied.
“Harry,” Ginny said. “I think I’m hallucinating Draco Malfoy on your couch.”
“We should call Madam Pomfrey,” Harry said, as he hurried across the small space and reached for a curse-box sitting on his shelf.
“Thank you,” he mumbled. Harry passed him a beer, and clinked the bottle against his own. There. That was a friendly gesture. Right?
“Nothing of any consequence. I would be a friendly stranger, sit with him in a bar and ask about his day. Or a gardener trimming hedges at hospital, offering potions ingredients I had gathered along the way. I don’t know what I was looking for. Maybe at first I told myself I wanted to know if it was an act. But I already knew it wasn’t, I’d seen enough for that. After a while, I went just because… because I wanted to
Draco turned his body until he was facing Harry properly. He reached out to trace the curve of his jaw.
Draco sighed, and closed his eyes, trying to feel his way to an answer that might make some kind of sense, but seven bloody hells, was that hard to do — he thought that on balance he might have fucked with Harry’s worldview quiet enough for one day. He also wondered if it was enough to blow these memories apart, or if Harry had to keep poking in them until he’d had enough of it. He wondered, too, whether Harry had much hope of living for long enough to do whatever it was he needed to do.
“Only if you don’t have anything stronger.”
Harry seemed to take a long time considering it. “No. I trust you. About this, at least.” But he didn’t pull his hand away, and somehow that simple point of contact became the centre of the universe, for a little while. It seemed like an excellent moment for a very distasteful joke, or to tell Harry he was an idiot for trusting a Slytherin. But instead, Draco nodded serenely, unwilling to break the spell.
“I don’t,” came another, shivering fearfully.
“A wandmaker’s apprentice earns a pittance,” he promised.
“Are you sodding — we
Harry’s jaw set fast. Was anyone Hermione knew not stubborn beyond all reason?
He looked suddenly sad.
“That does sound important,” Draco said, setting his quill down and widening his eyes. “And Auror Potter?”
“Well,” Hermione said. “Yes, I suppose I do. I haven’t seen you so much as look at a girl since Ginny. Not that I’ve seen you look at too many bye, either, and… But I’m still glad you decided to say it outright.”
He didn’t wait for a reply. He just found his way to bed.
But Harry Potter was her best friend, too. And it was impossible sometimes to know if she was the Minister for Magic, or Hermione Granger, Muggle-born Witch. And it was also hard to know if Harry was… the sum of all of his accolades, or Harry Potter.
“Of course,” He promised Gabrielle, kissing her cheek.
He’d been so many things, in his life. A nuisance. The terrible nephew who attended St Brutus’s School for Incurably Criminal Boys. The Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, a liar, an attention-seeker, the Saviour of the Wizarding World. Something wonderful or something terrible and never anything in between.
“I perfected my… Muggles call it ‘gaydar’ but I don’t really know why. But I perfected that the year after my father died, when I was busy being famously terrible in the papers. So I don’t think I got that wrong.”
Draco felt a smile curl the edges of his lip. The Zoo.
“One day,” he said, knowing that there was nothing he could do to help a memory, but needing to speak nonetheless, “you’ll be loved, Harry. You’ll be so loved.”
“You don’t need a shower,” Harry said, shaking his head. “I’m just going to get you all sweaty again.”
He found a friendly little cafe a while after that, and ordered a pot of tea and a slice of lemon meringue pie, which was delicious. There was a shelf of battered paperback books on the back wall. Harry chose one at random and read aimlessly for a while, knowing he would never finish the book, and not minding in the slightest. He’d read enough by the time he finished his tea to know that it was a simple story about people who were looking to be happy. That was more than enough.
But he wasn’t, of course. He held his arm to his chest, bright bruises already blooming on his shoulder. I was no longer dislocated; Draco knew well enough that the joint had been pulled out and then slipped back in moments. But it obviously still hurt, and badly. Harry was breathing strangely, and tears poured from his green eyes, but he was determined not to make a sound. Draco imagined himself, at this age; whatever age it was. Harry looked like he might be small for his age. He’d have screamed until the paint started peeling off the walls.
He stood as straight as he could manage and headed for the kitchen. Harry could see the sharp shoulder blades through his clothes. With another, hopefully final sigh, he followed.
Draco was sitting up in the bed, white as a ghost —… well, whiter than usual, despite the smudged eyeliner. Or maybe that made it look worse, Harry wasn’t really sure. He had the mug of tea in his hands.
“Harry!”
That was as honest as he had ever been to anyone outside of his closest friends — and inadvertently, Draco Malfoy. He didn’t miss the sharp intake of breath across the room.
“I have ideas,” he corrected. “I might have the very beginnings of plans.” He smiled to himself. “I’m not ready to share them. I hope that’s okay.”
“I don’t —”
“Do you know,” Hermione said, running a finger around the rim of her glass, making it sing. “There are days when I think I’m healthy.”
Harry pulled away. “Stop.”
“In the dream. Does he call you Malfoy? Or Draco?”
“I see. And?”
Draco felt ill. “Maybe he thought you were special.”
Harry snorted again. “It’s not my best feature.”
Harry squawked, and so did Molly, and Ginny smiled unrepentantly. Ron’s face drained of all colour, and Hermione jabbed him in the ribs.
weren’t broken. Didn’t mean
“I mean it, Hermione.”
“It’s my day off,” Harry said, and looked away again.
Harry offered Luna his elbow, and they headed towards the stream in the fading light.
All four of them laughed as a family of bright pink, yellow and green birds took off from the trees. It looked like fireworks. Luna climbed onto Grayson’s lap and watched while the rest of the ice cream melted, their cooling charms forgotten in the beauty of the spectacle.
Harry frowned puckishly. “‘
“This was the most fun I’ve had in years,” he blurted, instead of offering either.
“I say, Potter. No one is going to try to take your food away before you finish it.” Potter flushed, and turned as if he intended to say something snotty, but decided against it. He moved his arm a good inch and a half and chewed what was in his mouth. “No one has ever gone hungry at Hogwarts. The kitchen elves would die of mortification.” He noticed the way Potter tensed, and of course, he was immediately struck with a great urge to poke until Potter snapped at him. But he didn’t. They were, after all, teachers now. Adults.
