“Oh, you just remind me of your dad, is all,” Harry assured him. “Which reminds me, I have a present for you.”
Harry was surprised. It was a simple flat, a one bedroom on the second floor of a converted town house. The living room was immaculately clean and minimalist, all shades of grey and green. There was a kitchenette separated from the living room by a long counter that served as a breakfast bar. Harry guessed he was expecting something much more lavish, but this looked… empty.
“It’s good to be here, Mrs. Weasley,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow at Harry who finally looked up and gave him an awkward smile. “Is this where you’ve been hiding this whole time?” he asked Harry pointedly. Harry shrugged. Draco shook his head in exasperation. Molly, watching the two of them, rolled her eyes and busied herself with bringing out another round of canapes into the living room, leaving Draco with a blushing Harry.
“So, how’d it go?” Ron asked. Harry fell into the chair at the kitchen table across from Ron, still dazed. Ron sipped his tea. He could tell
The knock came again, louder this time. Draco let out a huff and set his book down. He got up, tying his bathrobe tighter around himself as he made his way to the front door of his townhouse. “I’m coming,” he called grumpily when whoever was disturbing his peace knocked for the third time. “Galloping gargoyles, calm your tits, I’m co- Harry.”
For the first time in his life, he dreaded going to the Weasley farmstead for Christmas. He knew, logically, that just because he would be back in the village didn’t mean he had to go to the manor, that it was so far away from the farm, that he didn’t need to go. Once he was there, Ron picked him up from the rail station, and almost immediately was swept up into the Christmas preparations. Between helping out around the farm, picking out and decorating the tree, making mince pies with Mrs. Weasley and all the rest, it was Christmas before he knew it, then the New Year, and suddenly he had to get back to London and his classes and his life. But even as he stepped back onto the train, there was that pull in his gut, like a string tied taut around his bones, demanding.
Draco frowned, turning to look at his friend. “What do you mean?” he asked. “What else could it possibly be?”
“Maybe having a sibling would have knocked you off your high horse sooner,” Harry pointed out with a teasing grin.
“You know I’m right, Harry! And what? George goes to Azkaban for doing something that during the war would have made him a hero? What’s right about that? Where’s the
“I like you,” was all Teddy said before taking Draco’s hand and all but tug-boating the man out of the living room. Draco let himself be led, turning to stage-whisper dramatically over his shoulder, “He likes me!”
“I care about you, too,” Draco whispered as his hand cradled Harry’s jaw. Harry’s heart leapt. It must have shown, because Draco smiled tenderly at him, his thumb brushing his cheek. The smile faltered, though, as Draco added, “But once the Cabinet is finished and the plan is carried out, we may never see each other again.”
At one point, the priest looked up, his gaze finding Draco’s for a heartbeat. The priest did not falter, but surprise arched his brow and tilted his head to one side as he considered the boy. Then he smiled and continued on, as if Draco was simply a passing thought that amused him. Draco snuck out the moment the priest’s gaze released him, vowing as he strode back towards familiar fields and hedgerows that he would never go back, never. What would his parents think?
Madam Pince, who had been re-shelving books a couple shelves away, poked her head around a bookcase to shush them. They both sheepishly bent their heads over their work. Harry glanced over at Hermione, only to find her scribbling on a piece of spare parchment. He frowned. A couple minutes later, she shoved the parchment across the table to him. He took it, his frown deepening as he read.
He slipped out of the bed and pulled on his bathrobe before tiptoeing out of the room. He made his way down to the kitchen as quietly as he could. Sound travelled in the old house. So when he got into the kitchen and closed the door, he cast a small ‘
“That’s the idea,” Harry said in a daze. Draco laughed. Harry grinned back and flicked his wrist. Draco yelped as his pants vanished.
Potter made him turn back around to face him, made him look him in the eye. “I was there, Draco,” he said. Draco’s stomach clenched. “I was there, that night. Underneath the Cloak.”
Draco blinked, then laughed to himself. “I forgot you saw that memory, too,” he said, half-under his breath. He sighed, his bruised chest rising and falling painfully. “He was a good man, and for his part, I think he loved me. I was just happy to find someone who cared for me that I fooled myself into thinking I loved him, too. I think that’s why it lasted as long as it did. I so desperately wanted to prove that I was lovable, to get you out of my head, to be someone else besides my father’s son.” He raised their joined hands to brush his knuckles along Harry’s cheek, his jaw. “But even, in the end, I had to admit it was a lost cause,” he murmured. “Alec knew it too. He told me so, the day he gave me Amelia. He said there had always been a third person in our relationship, and he hoped I found them again one day.”
Someone was standing at the wrought iron fence between numbers eleven and thirteen, staring at the brick fronting as if it had personally offended them. There was a Glamour charm on them so that Harry’s gaze kept wanting to slide off them, like oil on water. When he was a couple feet away, the figure turned, and Harry froze, mouth agape, as the Glamour charm fell away.
Harry sighed and massaged his temples. He heard the click of the door as Draco left the room. He looked back up at Ron and Hermione. Ron had not picked his jaw off the floor yet, and Hermione was giving him a look that was both withering and pitying, like he was a muddy dog that had brought them someone else’s toy.
“You said the bond gets stronger. What do you mean?” he asked, trying his best to keep his voice from cracking. Hermione, who had been watching Harry with her own tears in her eyes, shook herself and rolled her shoulders back, grounding back into the academics.
Harry nodded. Draco pulled away to press both hands over his mouth. Tears sparkled in his eyes. Harry wasn’t sure if he could smile or not. Finally, Draco lowered his hands slightly.
Silence fell. Even Teddy was still as he leaned his head against his godfather’s shoulder. Then the boy pulled back and asked, “Does that make him Uncle Draco, then?”
Teddy wouldn’t look at either of them, staring instead at his clenched hands on the countertop. “It’s…complicated,” he said, his voice just barely audible.
“Harry?” said Draco. He raised his hands, palms facing Harry, reassuring him that there was nothing to fear. Once more, Harry’s eyes found the Dark Mark on Draco’s left arm. Draco, frowning, followed his gaze. His shoulders slumped when he realised. “Oh,” he breathed. “Shit.” He lowered his hands and looked back up at Harry, fighting to keep the hurt out of his expression. “Harry, can you tell me your full name?” he asked as calmly as he could.
“Why on earth did you two break up?” he asked, surprising them both. He couldn’t stop the blush this time, and he looked away, out the window. The train had begun to move out of the station and was picking up speed. “It just… It was your fairy tale ending, wasn’t it? Getting together with your best friend’s sister. The perfect bow-tie ending to your heroic story.”
Draco rolled his eyes with a chuckle. “Harry, I’m not going to let you go that easily,” he drawled. He booped Harry’s nose and grinned when Harry wrinkled it with a playful smile. “There’s more to a relationship than just sex, you know.”
Hermione blinked at him. “I have so many questions,” she said, half to herself. “But I guess now’s not the time… Right, well, I guess I can’t hold your parents’ decision to continue enslaving house elves against you. Erm, right, so. That just leaves my last grievance then.” Her head shifted amongst the flames, and Draco could imagine her rolling her shoulders back, the young lawyer in training. “Over the years, I have known you to be a coward. I have known you to be arrogant, rude, and mean, not caring about anyone but yourself. So how can I expect you to treat Harry well?”
Malfoy rubbed at his brow, his eyes distant and unfocused. After a moment, he shook his head. “No, there were always other curses,” he said, his voice muffled as he leaned his chin in his hand. “As far as I know, it’s only been used twice before now.” He raised his eyes, his gaze meeting Harry’s. He didn’t need to say anything more. Harry pursed his lips and nodded.
This made Harry chuckle and dry his tears. To his surprise, Sirius and Remus did not turn him out or tell him to hide his gift. Instead, they spoke to the teachers and to the Head Librarian who safe-guarded the castle’s enormous collection of grimoires and histories, and together they trained him in the necromantic arts. Harry learned that it was not simply a way of knowing when someone will die or communicating with restless spirits. Necromancy was a double-edged sword – with one side, he could lay the dead to rest, and with another, he could make them rise again.
“Could be worse,” he said finally, as deadpan as he could. Harry barked out a laugh. He shook his head at Draco, who smiled back. Harry let out a small sigh and, leaving his whiskey behind, came around the breakfast bar, one hand trailing on the countertop. Draco felt his breath catch in his chest as his heart fluttered somewhere deep in his stomach. Harry walked right up to where Draco perched on his stool, standing between Draco’s legs and looking up at him through thick black lashes. Draco swallowed hard. There were flecks of gold and hazel in Harry’s emerald green eyes, and this close Draco could see a hint of another small scar, a nick just below his left eye from some forgotten fight.
When the room finally quieted down, only then did Draco look away, back towards the judge, who again asked him to refrain from addressing the defendant.
He did his best not to keep sneaking glances at his date – a handsome man, Harry gave Hermione that much, named Joseph. He was just not entirely his type. He couldn’t pinpoint why, exactly. There was just no spark, no attraction. He sighed as he inched forward in the queue. Half an hour, he promised himself – then, if the date was still a bust, he’d go and spend his rare free day knowing he’d given it his best.
Harry clenched his jaw, waiting for the jibe, the sneer, the dirty joke. But it never came. Something flashed across Malfoy’s face, but Harry couldn’t decipher it in time.
“Should we take him to St. Mungo’s?” he asked, holding Draco’s hand now in both of his. Draco shook his head, waving the hand still clutching the handkerchief.
“Er, forgot we have an essay due in, er, Charms!” Harry said as he and Draco rushed up to their dorm. Neville frowned after them.
Harry pulled him along, grinning like a fool, practically tripping up the stairs as they giggled and chased each other, grabbing at shirts, waists, hands. They came to the first landing, and Draco slowed and stopped. His laughter fell quiet as he stared at the hulking monstrosity of a frame that loomed out at an angle from the wall, as if the curtained portrait was standing over all those that stood before it. It was such a contrast to the tastefully painted walls, the abstract art covering the nail holes where stuffed elf heads were once displayed. Draco frowned. He reached out towards the curtains, just as Harry turned on the stair to look back at him.
“Let’s do this again,” Harry said, his voice coming out a little rougher than he’d meant. Malfoy’s blush spread to the tips of his ears. “Get a drink with me next weekend?”
For a long while, they sat there in silence, watching the fire die. An uncomfortable suspicion crawled up Draco’s spine. Without looking at Blaise, he asked, “Why are you telling me this?”
Hermione, who had just come in through the portrait hole, leaned around the stack of books she was carrying and noticed Harry and Draco standing there, holding hands and looking sheepish. “Oh! Well done, you two!” she said with a weary smile. “Took you long enough.” When Dean called her name again, she swivelled towards him, nearly sending the top few books flying.
Malfoy, still clutching the towel and dripping rainwater on the hearthrug, met Harry’s gaze. A trickle of ice slipped down Harry’s spine. The last time he’d seen that look on Malfoy’s face, he had just been released from Azkaban.
“Myrtle, please,” Harry pleaded with her. “I promise, I’m not going to hurt him. You know me, Myrtle. I can help.”
Harry giggled, making Draco smile stupidly. He brushed the remnants of tears off Harry’s cheeks with his thumbs, straightened his glasses for him, then stepped back, his hands resting on Harry’s hips, loathe to say goodbye just yet. Harry gave him a small, shaky smile. He tapped Draco’s shirt with his wand, leaving the fabric spotless.
– and the way his deep voice began to roll and dance when he spoke of Italy. He pulled one knee into his chest, his foot resting on the couch, his chin on his knee as he listened to Blaise’s story unfold.
Ron hesitated. “Oh,” he said. He seemed to shrink back to a normal size, his bearded face switching from menacing to suspicious as he looked Draco over. “Right, then.” He stepped back and went back to his wife, who was struggling to get up from the couch with her pregnant belly. He lifted her up, and she braced herself against him, like a ship coming in to port. Ron wrapped his arm around her shoulders and she smiled up at her husband for a moment before turning to Draco with an only slightly murderous look. As she allowed herself to be guided away, she revealed Harry sitting on the far-end of the couch, his eyes glued to the beat-up pine coffee table in front of him.
Draco shrugged. He did not. Or, rather, he had an idea, but it was not one he wanted to consider. “I could leave,” he suggested, not looking Harry in the eye. “If we’re not together, they’ll leave you alone.”
“I don’t know where to go from here,” he murmured. “I don’t know if I can ever give you what you want. With Ginny, we did everything but sex, and it was the same for me with her, I just…went through the motions. It’s just… it’s stupid.” He pulled up the collar of his shirt to wipe at his nose. Draco grimaced, but didn’t reprimand Harry for his gross habits, just schooled his expression back into one of patient attention as Harry continued. “I want to be with you,” he insisted as he looked up at Draco earnestly. “You – God, you make me so happy. And I – I want to show you how much I care for you, I want to make you feel good, I-I really do, but… I don’t know
Draco smirked at the dawning realisation on Hermione’s face. He shifted and drew his knees up in front of him, settling in for what he knew was going to be a long conversation.
From this angle, Harry could see a pretty little flush creep up the back of Malfoy’s neck. “Of course,” Malfoy said slowly – not patronisingly, but rather as if he was resisting the urge to throttle Harry. “I am going to go get… presentable. Please excuse me.” Without waiting for their response, Malfoy pivoted on his heel and strode off, stomping up the stairs.
The months passed in a disoriented blur. The war was over, his father sent to Azkaban, and he was tried and acquitted, but not forgiven. So he shut himself away, let himself be forgotten.
He was raised by his aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon, a merchant living on the edges of a bustling city. They were wealthy enough to have a small cottage and to send their son to the prestigious grammar school in the city – but Harry, their nephew and kin, lived in the cramped cellar and learned his letters from their neighbour, a spinster who everyone said was half-mad. Mistress Figg was a kind woman, but she only knew so much. Being the daughter of a merchant herself, she was literate enough to keep the books and manage the accounts when her father passed twenty years ago, but she couldn’t answer Harry’s questions about the books she lent him that he kept hidden under his bed roll. If his uncle saw him reading, he would whip him for ‘idleness’ and ‘sloth’ and order him instead to scrub the floors or set him any one of the numerous servantly tasks the family assigned him.
“Although, if you ever want to go dress shopping,” Harry said, “I don’t know how much I can help, I’m absolutely shite at that. Hermione wanted me to help her shop for a wedding dress back in the day, and it was a complete disaster.”
“Well,” said Harry, considering, “I think you’d probably end up hexing the first, and the second….” He trailed off with a shrug and took a bite of curry. Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
“What do you think?” he asked instead of answering. Draco shrugged, not looking away, his eyes boring straight through Harry. If he didn’t know better, Harry would think he was reading his mind – but there was no sensation of strange magic probing his defences, leaving that oily, grimy feeling in its wake. He frowned. His own magic reached out curiously. Just like he would know Draco anywhere, he would know Draco’s magic from a mile away, which is what surprised him when he saw him in that Muggle café. How had he not felt it? Perhaps he was too absorbed in his own worries over that doomed date, or, more likely, Draco had learned to dampen his magic around Muggles. But now, now –
“Where did you hear that?” he asked, aiming for nonchalance. Pansy played along, tossing her hair to one side as she traced the rim of her glass with one finger.
Draco lowered his hand from his mouth, his lip trembling. “I love you, too,” he said, his voice thick with tears and years of longing.
“What the hell were you all betting on, anyway?” Harry demanded even as he began to laugh. Dean shrugged, hopping down from his chair to collect the Galleons from a disgruntled Neville and the two Ravenclaw boys.
Sometimes, Draco would show him around the house, tell him stories about the people in the portraits. There were secret passageways that connected to rooms and staircases – most likely service passages for maids and servants back in the day, but Harry liked to think of them as secret passageways. Other times, he and Draco would lounge in Draco’s bedroom, talking about their childhoods, old stories, new stories, whatever came to mind. Harry knew he could trust Draco with anything, because who else was the man going to tell? He was a ghost trapped in a manor that not even the homeless or drug addicts would touch.
“It’s the Invisibility Cloak,” Remus explained. He got up from his seat beside his partner and came over to where Harry stood on the hearth rug. “See?” He pulled the fabric away, revealing a sliver of Harry’s tunic beneath. “Anyone who wears it cannot be seen – not by eye, not by magic, not even, it is said, by Death herself. Your father left it with us when he first heard of Voldemort’s plan to track down the Hallowed Trinity, just before he fled with your mother to Ængla. It is time you had it.” He placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders then, his guess of where Harry’s shoulders would be proving eerily accurate, and looked him in the eye, his expression serious. There were lines at the corners of Remus’s mouth, silver at his temples. Harry was struck, suddenly, with the knowledge that these two men were getting older. Death did not call for them yet, but one day, she would. And Harry would not be able to save them.
“Christ on a cracker, Draco!” Harry threw his hands into the air with a harsh laugh. “Just believe me, won’t you? I love you. Not Ginny. I’m bisexual, and I love you. And I’m not just saying that because I’m taking the piss. I.” He came up, one hand running up Draco’s neck. “Love.” He pressed two fingers under Draco’s chin, made him look him in the eye. “You.”
Harry snorted, an ugly sound so endearing to Draco that he couldn’t help his smile at it now. Harry licked his dry lips, his gaze still trained on the paper in his hands. “No, that’s not – it means I don’t experience sexual attraction,” he said quickly. “I… I try, and it doesn’t… it doesn’t work for me like that. There’s nothing wrong with me,” he added, as if trying to persuade himself more than Draco, “I just don’t experience attraction the same as most people do.”
“Come out with me and Blaise tonight,” she said. Draco frowned and paused. The idea of being a third wheel to Pansy and Blaise did not sound particularly fun.
you, Draco. If you don’t want to be with me, fine, I can live with that. But if the reason you’re not giving this a chance is because you don’t think it can happen, or because of what everyone will say, then let me prove to you why they’re wrong.”
“I think he really likes you,” Harry said. He got settled into bed and set his glasses on the bedside table. Draco chuckled to himself as he got in beside Harry, tucking himself into the other man’s side.
“Having quite the argument over there,” said Draco nonchalantly. Harry almost dropped his phone. Draco looked over his shoulder at him. “You know you can turn the keyboard sound off, right?”
“I swear, Jamie would give Fred and George a run for their money,” he muttered. He sat down in the chair on Teddy’s other side with an exhausted sigh. “They were trying to ‘surf’ on the brooms, so I sent them back outside, sans brooms. Hopefully they can get all their energy out before tea without breaking anything important.”
“Anyone but you?” Harry finished for him. Draco’s eyes filled with tears, but he nodded, his jaw set as he pulled his knees into his chest, like he was willing himself to disappear. Harry sighed and rubbed his face with his hands, momentarily dislodging his glasses. He readjusted his glasses, let his hands drop into his lap, Luna’s words echoing in his ears. “You felt pretty real just then,” he said under his breath.
Harry shook his head slowly, glancing from Draco to Ginny and back again. “No,” he said. “No, that can’t – how do you even prove any of that? Anyone could just say they were soulmates, it doesn’t mean….”
Later, as Harry lay awake in the sumptuous bed that was likely worth more than he had ever owned and then some, he pulled out the Remembrance Stone from the pouch around his neck. He closed his eyes and turned it over in his hands three times one way, then three times another, calling Narcissa’s name in his mind.
“Galloping gargoyles, Draco,” Harry muttered. He pulled Draco against him nonetheless and pressed a kiss to the top of his head. “Be glad I like you so much, or I’d hex you.”
“We can go slow,” Harry said. He smiled hopefully. “I can visit during the school holidays, you can visit on your days off, we can make it work.”
They ate their dinner together, their conversation easy and natural. Harry teasingly asked how Amelia was settling in and Malfoy said, very seriously, that she was adjusting quite well.
It had always been difficult to look in the mirror. He never quite understood why he couldn’t stop looking, though. Every chance he got, he’d check – was his hair okay, how was his shirt fitting, his trousers, is that really what he looked like? As a child, it was a simple fascination. That’s me, he’d think, right there. But as he got older, his body stopped fitting right. All gangly limbs and spots, he had bruises and scars from knocking into things, from scratching at pimples, from haphazard attempts to shave. Those were normal teenage boy badges of honour. But Draco wasn’t a normal teenager.
“Be sure to write down every detail, Potter,” Malfoy said. He tapped a long finger on the file. “Don’t want to miss anything important, now do we?”
“Let me look into it, okay? I’m sure there’s an answer somewhere. I’ll go to the library and – ” Her smile broadened as Harry let out a wet chuckle because of course she was going to the library, where else would she go? “I’ll let you know what I find as soon as I can, okay? You’re lucky you got me on my day off, and it’s still early, I can spend the rest of the day there. Oooo, this is exciting! I haven’t been to the library for fun in ages! Or, not fun, but you know what I mean.” She squeezed Harry’s hands, her face lit up with the prospect her entire day off deep in the stacks of the local library. Harry forced a smile.
“­ – Alec Hallberg, and he’s part of Healer’s United. He’s a good man, Father. Why can’t you just be happy that I’ve found someone who loves me?”
“Yeah,” he said, the word rough on his exhale. “Over Christmas. We were visiting her family in France, and they kept asking about… well, about Father, mainly, but they wanted to know how I was… handling things, I guess. When I bought that book, they all assumed I had a girlfriend.” Harry chuckled. Draco smirked and went back to playing with Harry’s hair. “In any case, Mother knew I was not exactly able to have a girlfriend, being here and all. We had dinner one night, just the two of us. We hadn’t had dinner together, just us, since Father’s trial. It was nice. But then she asked if I had something to tell her.”
“You would have done something,” Malfoy snapped, lowering his hands to glare at Harry. “If you had been in my shoes, you would have done something, wouldn’t you? You never ran away from someone who’s trying to kill you.”
Harry smirked in triumph. But then his eyes fell to Draco’s chest, and his smirk fell away. He reached out and traced the scars that slashed across the pale skin. His fingers shook as he passed over a particularly long one, the tissue raised and silvery, catching in the light.
“Now, my cousin, being a Zabini and all, was always at the top of the social order – always had the nicest robes, the best books, had his shoes shined daily. But David…” Blaise puffed out his cheeks, exhaling sharply through pursed lips. “Everyone loved David. Who can blame them, the bloke is objectively gorgeous. I’ve only seen him once but hell, I get it. And maybe that’s how the whole thing started, you know? Maybe my cousin was just jealous of all the attention David got, of how effortlessly David seemed to win people over with his easy charm. They competed over everything, him and my cousin – grades, Quidditch, who was better in a duel, all of it. They were relentless. Every holiday, all my aunt would hear about was how my cousin was going to finally destroy David, his ultimate rival. Drove her nuts.
Malfoy scoffed. “Of course you don’t.” Still, he didn’t look at Harry. Harry let out a huff. When Malfoy didn’t turn back to him, his gaze slipped from studying Malfoy’s profile to where his trouser had ridden up slightly, revealing the white skin of his ankle and the inky design of a serpentine tail. Harry frowned.
Draco shook his head violently. His eyes were wide with fear when he finally looked at Harry. He made to pull his hands from Harry’s grip. “No, I can’t,” he protested. But Harry held on tight, set his jaw firmly as he levelled his gaze on Draco.
“It’s fine,” Draco murmured, “it’s fine, just, please….” He didn’t know what he wanted from Harry, just knew that if Harry asked about them in that moment, it would be over. Harry seemed to understand. He rested his forehead against Draco’s chest, the only acknowledgement Draco needed, that later, later they would talk, but not now, please not now.
“What do you know about the Malfoys, Junior Auror Jenkins?” Harry asked in a cool, neutral tone, like a teacher asking a student to show his work.
The dark tile all around them gleamed as they passed down the corridors to their assigned court room. The murmur of conversation rose and fell around them as they passed little clusters of people milling about outside other court rooms. Draco kept asking Harry if they were late, why wasn’t anyone else outside their court room, oh my god Harry are we late?
“Want to take this to the bedroom?” Harry asked, pulling away just enough to look him in the eye. Draco froze. This, Harry realised. This was why he’d lashed out at Ron, twice now. That despite what he’d said, despite the occasional blowjob or hand down the trousers, they had never actually slept together. Draco refused to take off his shirt, or even his trousers. And Harry never pushed it, never wanted to pressure him into anything. Even now, he rocked back on his heels, ready to concede again. Except this time, Draco was pulling him back. He bit his lip and ducked his head nervously, but when he did manage to meet Harry’s confused gaze, he smiled.
Harry just had enough brain power left to set the book on the bedside table before Draco crawled on top of him, straddling his hips. Harry, pulling away to gasp for air as he grabbed the other boy’s thin waist, protested weakly, “Draco, the door’s still open.”
Harry looked up then, all bright green eyes and sun-kissed skin like summer in the dead of winter. “I asked,” he said, “because I really want to kiss you.”
“I don’t need help,” Malfoy replied automatically. Without another word, he slipped past Harry and stalked off down the corridor towards the exit. Harry and Tonks watched him go.
“Let me put it this way – the mouse had been properly decapitated and disembowelled, which I guess was why the other shoe was filled with cat vomit.”
Harry caught Draco’s eye for the briefest of moments. He knew Draco had heard by the slight exasperated eye roll he gave Harry before focusing back on Hermione’s discussion on unstable potion ingredients. Harry passed his hand over his face with a sigh. “You forget that he’s been basically shunned out of wizarding society,” he pointed out, slouching in his seat as he crossed his ankle over his knee. “Tonight’s less like opening night and more like dropping him in a pot of boiling water.”
Draco bit his lip. He looked away, down at a cracked tile near one of the drains set into the floor. Finally, he nodded, his fingers playing with his left cuff as if debating whether or not to show Harry. Harry’s gut twisted. Some part of him had wanted it not to be true.
Not for the first time, Harry thought of his parents. How he would like to see them, one last time. To hear their voices, feel their arms around him, know what they smelled like – did his mother wear scented oils, did his father smell of woodsmoke and leather like Sirius or of parchment and sugar like Remus? He closed his eyes. Even Death, it seemed, waited for him to speak.
The laugh that startled out of Harry was a bubbling delight, so clear and bright that Malfoy smiled, confused but with a look that could only be described as awe. Harry shook his head, still chuckling to himself. “Oh, you sweet summer child.” He wiped away a tear as he sobered up. “Don’t worry about it. So,” he took a deep breath, all business, “Ivanovich. How did you get involved with him?”
Draco pulled her in for a tight hug. She hugged him back. She smelled like Chanel perfume and Floo powder. For a moment, he was back at his father’s funeral, holding her just like this as he tried to stay upright, even as his knees shook and all he wanted to do was crumple to the ground. She smelled the same as she had that day. She had been there for him through all these years, held his hand as flowers bloomed over his Dark Mark, eaten take-away on the floor of her flat after long shifts at the hospital, had even gone to a Muggle pharmacy with her to get a pregnancy test when she had a scare a few years back. He knew she was right. He was miserable.
“Bittersweet.” Draco’s expression softened, disbelief mingling with awe in the slant of his lips. Harry nodded, his own smile growing.
“Maybe,” he replied, his voice low and soft. Draco hated what that voice did to him. Potter looked him up and down, biting his lower lip. Draco crossed his legs to hide how flustered this made him. Potter’s look was practically predatory. Finally, he continued, “Depends on how this case goes. I think we’re close to cracking it. Now, yesterday you said that whoever was selling these potions wasn’t making them in house, that they had to be getting them shipped in from somewhere. Remind me why that is?”
“What happened? To Malfoy Manor, that is.” Harry rolled over in bed to face Draco, who lay stretched out on his back with one arm tucked behind his head.
“Two drinks?” Malfoy cast his eyes around the small café, as if expecting to find Ron or Hermione nearby. Harry knew he didn’t have to explain himself, but the words were out of his mouth before he could stop.
But Draco only laughed and pulled back further, tipping his head back to grin at the heavens above them. Harry’s scowl deepened, but there was a playful light in his green eyes, curling at the corners of his mouth. Draco stepped back, grinning and grabbing hold of Harry’s hands to tug him along as he walked backwards towards one of the benches set out for classes. He sat down and pulled Harry onto his lap, beaming up at him. He plucked Harry’s glasses from his head and set them down on the bench next to them with careful and delicate movements. Harry’s blooming heart grew, pushing itself against his sternum, his throat, threatening to spill out of his mouth. Instead, he cradled Draco’s head in his hands and pulled him in for another kiss.
“Ron’s with him,” he explained. “And it just so happens that eight o’clock is his bedtime, so it all works out.”
The war was over. He had a career. He had run into Potter at the Ministry and all those years of replacing attraction with hatred had tumbled back into his life. The two of them had a tense cup of coffee together, then another, then a pint, maybe a bottle of Firewhiskey. It had started as an attempt at healing old wounds. It became furtive looks, secret smiles, and sweet longing. So when Harry kissed him outside of his flat, Draco couldn’t understand why his body betrayed him. Didn’t he want to kiss him back? Didn’t he want this? Hadn’t he spent years denying himself this? Why couldn’t he respond in kind?
“You saved him. Downstairs, in the drawing room.” Draco froze, his mouth agape. Harry pressed on. “You could have turned him over to Voldemort, but you didn’t, you pretended you didn’t know him.”
Harry squeezed his hand. “Yeah,” he admitted, “I’m going to Hogwarts. They need a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and I thought I’d give it a go. But I don’t leave until the last week of August, and I still need to sell my place, and Hermione and Ron are going to start trying to have kids soon – it’s not like I’m leaving forever. Hey.” He lifted Draco’s chin with two fingers, making him look him in the eye. “Tell me. What’s going on in that head of yours?”
“Harry,” Draco said, getting the other man’s attention and gesturing at the priest. “I would like you to meet Father Nicola. Father, this is Harry Potter.”
Harry made his way with one hand on the wall for guidance to the kitchen, where he had stashed some water bottles a while ago. He drank one, then opened another, sipping at it more cautiously. Luna’s words rolled through his head, connecting then falling apart only to connect again. How could she know all that, just from looking at his hand?
– living room. He wanted all the world to know. He loved Draco Malfoy, and Draco loved him back. If the whole world came for them, it wouldn’t matter – they had fought off worse and won. Who’s to say they couldn’t do it again?
Harry forced himself to smile back. A part of him wanted to tell Draco to never stop touching him. “What about you?” he asked instead. Draco raised an eyebrow.
That had been three hours ago. He had properly sobered up, drank a cup of tea, and was curled up on his sofa wrapped up in his silk bathrobe and a cosy blanket, doing everything Pansy had said qualified for ‘self-care’. Because he didn’t need a man in his life, and he definitely didn’t need to be pining after Harry ‘Golden Boy’ Potter. He was fine. He was great. He was –
When Draco got home that night, decidedly tipsier than he had been in a while, he didn’t even make it to the bed. Instead, he sank to the floor, back against the bed frame as he propped his arms on his knees. Scorpius raised his head from where he lay curled up in the middle of the bed.
He felt himself relax as his magic met Draco’s, almost as familiar as his own. It tasted like petrichor and metal on his tongue, was soft as silk but cold as dragon scales. Draco’s eyes closed. For a moment, it seemed that he let Harry’s magic relearn his, let it linger over where Harry knew the Mark to be, let it travel up his arm and brush the column of his throat. Then his eyes opened. Harry’s magic was slammed back at him in a tidal wave. Harry only had a moment to ground himself before it hit him, pushing his chair back an inch and snatching the air out of his lungs. Draco raised an eyebrow.
Weeks passed before Harry saw Ron again. He had asked after him when Hermione showed up alone to his birthday party, but she had only shook her head with a sad smile. “Give him time,” she said. But now August was almost over, and Harry was starting to wonder if he was ever going to see his friend again.
, that Draco wanted to look away, afraid of going blind by looking at something so bright. But Harry held him there.
, would you? Or better yet, tell my boss. Robards fully expects me to make Senior Auror in a year’s time, have my own team in two, and take over the department by the time I’m thirty. I just….” He dug his nails into his arms to try to hide how much he was shaking. “I don’t know,” he managed, his voice thick. “All I know is that I don’t want that.”
Andromeda let out a wet laugh and dabbed at her eyes with the cuff of her black robes. “I doubt that,” she said, “but still, I would like to get to know you too, nephew.”
“Oh, you didn’t know? He and Seamus have been dating since the Battle. Keep up, lads,” he added with a teasing grin. Harry shook his head. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist as he rested his chin on Harry’s shoulder. Harry leaned back into the embrace instinctively, his hands resting on top of Draco’s.
“It was expected of me, I thought… He was going to kill my mother if I didn’t… I thought I wanted it at the time, but now….”
By that evening, they had brought the potion seller in for questioning and were close to pinning down the manufacturer, but the case was nowhere near done. The two of them stood in front of the evidence board – a corkboard on Potter’s office wall covered in their notes and photos of the suspects and the counterfeit potions – going over the leads on the manufacturer again and again. Potter fiddled with a ballpoint pen in his hand. Draco sipped at his fourth coffee of the day, his body jittery from the caffeine. Potter let out a small gasp, and Draco turned just in time to see him pull off the pen cap with his teeth and lunge forward to scribble a note on one of the pages pinned on the board.
Again, the priest was quiet. “The people of this parish know me as Father Nicola,” he said casually. “But my family name is old and carries the weight of years of prestige and excellence. When they disowned me, it was almost a relief. I thought it would be easier to be my own person, not having to worry about meeting the lofty expectations set by my ancestors. I stopped believing in the power of fate and heritage in favour of the power of love, forgiveness and piety. I put my faith in myself, and in God, or the version I believe in, in any case. I think you need to find something, or someone, to put your faith in, to believe in. In time, I hope that that something or someone will be yourself. But for now, you need something to look up to, not just someone to follow. Do you understand?”
The wood of the closet was blackened with age and smoke, soft and smooth to the touch. He sat upon the bench beside the latticed grate and, as the priest instructed, closed the curtain, shutting him away. He heard the grate slide open with a soft ‘click’, and the groan of the seat as the priest took his place on the other side.
“Never before has someone dared to speak to a member of the royal family in such a manner,” said King Draco, his voice as sharp and cold as a dagger. “If you were anyone else and we were in any other situation, I would have you executed for treason.”
“I’m not the one I’m worried about, you dunce,” Harry pointed out. His jaw was set and there was a determined look in his eyes. “And I’m not breaking up with you just because other people don’t like us together. I just got you, I’m not letting you go that easily.”
“I just… want to hear your side of it,” he said at last. “I want to understand. You’ve been Marked, haven’t you?”
“Yeah, of course, spectacular,” he said sarcastically, a wry smile on his trembling lips. He grew serious under Draco’s narrowed eyes. “I’ll be fine,” he assured him. He pushed the hair off Draco’s forehead, tucked a stray loose curl behind his ear. “He’s my best friend. Hermione and I will talk some sense into him. I’m just sorry you had to deal with that.”
Draco turned into Harry’s arms, resting his head on Harry’s warm chest. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, holding him close, pressing a kiss on top of his head as he murmured, “I got you, you’re okay.” Draco let out a shaky sigh. Each time he closed his eyes, he could see the stricken faces, the blood thick on the tile floors, could feel Nagini crushing his ribcage. He took a deep, steadying breath, breathing in the smell of Harry, sweat and coffee and whiskey. Slowly, the dream slipped away, and his waking world grew solid and real. Harry smoothed back Draco’s hair from his forehead, pressing another kiss there, rocking him slightly as he held him. Draco realised, then, that if there was anyone who understood his nightmares, it was Harry.
“You looked like you were talking to someone you loved,” Luna said, as if that explained everything. “By the way, you didn’t hang up.”
“What are you doing here?” he demanded. When Harry pulled out a piece of paper out of his jacket pocket, Draco’s eyebrows disappeared into his fringe. “The fuck is that?”
charm.” He waved a hand through the doorway as if dusting away a cobweb, and the charm fell away. He was only wearing his trousers, barefoot and bare-chested as he leaned against the doorframe. He pushed his glasses up his nose, his green eyes warm behind the lenses. “Still have trouble sleeping, then?”
Draco reached up and gave the owl a gentle scratch on the back of its head. “How about we call you Scorpius?” he asked it with a half-smile. The owl, now realising that it was not going to get a decent rest with the two of them fawning over it, blinked at Draco with a satisfied hoot.
“Dear God, no.” He pinched the bridge of his nose, bumping into his glasses as he did so. “No, God, we’ve just gotten to be friendly with each other, no. That would just mess things up again.”
Harry frowned. “But why?” He reached out and, grabbing Draco’s elbow, pulled him to a stop. Draco exhaled sharply, jaw clenched as he refused to meet Harry’s gaze. Harry didn’t let go. “I don’t understand.”
Once Andromeda had gone in a flash of green flames, Harry made his way towards the kitchen. He paused just outside in the hallway when he heard Teddy and Draco’s chattering voices.
“Good to know your cleaning charms aren’t like your vanishing charms, I definitely couldn’t go back to work shirtless and you still owe me a pair of pants. I would rather not add this shirt to the list,” Draco teased. Harry rolled his eyes. He pecked Draco on the corner of the mouth, making a pale pink blush spread across Draco’s high cheekbones.
“Because,” Harry said as slow and clear as possible, “he’s my boyfriend and if I’m going to bring a date to an official event, I’m going to bring him. Also, this is bigger than both of us. People need to see that it’s okay for us to be out in the open, rather than trying to hide who we are.”
Shock flashed across Draco’s face – had he not realised what he had said? Then he clenched his haw, his hands curling into fists at his sides to hide how badly they were trembling. “I think you know why,” he said, quiet and sure.
Harry and Draco blinked at him. Hermione went over to her husband and gave him a kiss on the cheek. “There’s the Ronald I married,” she murmured. “Now come on, let’s all sit down, I think the dinner is going to be served soon.”
Draco looked up and met Dumbledore’s gaze. Dumbledore nodded once. Draco sighed. He reached out and caught Harry’s wrist as he passed him in his pacing, pulling him to a halt with a soft, “Harry.”
Draco blinked. Tears began to slip down his cheeks. He sniffled and tried to look away, but Harry held firm. Again, he found his gaze flickering between Draco’s eyes and his trembling lips, but this time, he let them linger there. He brushed the pad of his thumb against Draco’s lower lip. Draco inhaled sharply. Harry’s hand dropped away. He had misread the situation, forgotten who he was talking to. He made to step back, but before he could, Draco’s hands were in his hair and his lips were crashing into Harry’s in a clumsy kiss.
“What good comes from you staying in this house forever, sitting in your own self-pity?” Harry replied before he was aware of what he was saying.
Malfoy gave him a tight nod. He fiddled with his wand, as if still unsure if he would need it. Harry sighed.
He let go of Draco’s hand to ghost up Draco’s thigh, to waver dangerously close to the bulge in his trousers. Draco’s breath hitched in his throat. He felt his heart stutter. But he also realised this was all anticipation – desire was strangely, quietly absent. Draco bit his lip. He wanted to want it, to want Harry’s hand to move closer, to want that friction, but all he felt was silence.
“No,” he said, “but I imagine Ginny would love those. She hates that Hermione can’t drink now that she’s pregnant, and she could use a girls’ night that doesn’t end in a drunken Quidditch match with her teammates.” He shuddered. “Last time I had to set one broken arm, one broken nose, and a twisted ankle from them falling off their brooms and getting hit in the face with the Quaffle. Then I got Ginny home and she threw up on me.”
“I’m pretty sure it was just because I accidently mixed up my potions ingredients with my cooking ingredients,” he explained casually as he turned back to check on his rice and lentils. “Thankfully, you keep your potions stuff separate.”
“I see you brought Mr. Malfoy with you,” Robards said coolly. Harry raised his chin and stuck his hands in his pockets.
“So, essentially, you’ve got a good head on your shoulders, Harry Potter,” she said, smiling up at him. Then she poked at the line near the top of his palm. “Your heart line tells me you love or will love someone, deeply, and that they will be with you for the rest of your life. They’ll be your soulmate, your partner for as long as you live.”
Draco blinked at Harry. “Er, yes,” he said. “I’ve run out of my favourite ink and need to get more. Why?”
“No,” he assured her too quickly. She smirked but didn’t press the matter. “I’m fine, really. But you’re right, we should get up to the castle. Malfoy.” He nodded at Malfoy before pushing past Tonks into the corridor.
Harry and Humphries shared a look. Malfoy drew in a sharp breath. “It was, wasn’t it?” he said in a hushed voice.
“Oh, I’m already having a laugh,” she pointed out. “Ha ha ha, see? No, this is for science. Or, rather, the bet I’ve had with Blaise for the better part of twelve years. Don’t tell him I told you.”
He knew Malfoy was behind Katie Bell getting cursed. He knew he was a Death Eater, that he was up to something, he had to be. Hermione and Ron from the beginning thought he was nuts for even considering it, as if recruiting child soldiers in this war was unheard of, as if the last couple of years hadn’t happened. But he
“Isn’t this a conflict of interest?” Harry had protested when Robards assigned him as the case supervisor. Robards, a big burly man with a silver stripe in his thick black hair, shrugged.
Harry sighed, his breath puffing against Draco’s pebbled nipple, making him squirm even more. “I got a letter from Ginny last weekend,” he murmured. He pulled away, the shadow returning to his lust-wide eyes. Draco frowned, thoroughly disapproving of this intruder into their…whatever this was. Harry’s hands skimmed up Draco’s back as he bit his kiss-bruised lips. “She wants to get back together.”
Harry frowned. He looked down at Draco’s hand on his knee, covered it with one of his own. His thumb rubbed the back of Draco’s hand gently as he mulled over Draco’s words. “Okay,” he said at last. “I… I don’t know what that means…but okay.” He looked back up at Draco. “What does… what does that mean?”
Harry sighed. He looked down at his knees where his jeans had torn open when he fell. “It’s nothing,” he said, “Just my cousin and his friends.”
“Er, Draco,” Harry began. Draco blinked, not used to Harry using his first name. “Would you – I know it’s late, and you probably just want to go home – ”
“That’s a lot for one person to apologise for,” Harry said. Malfoy looked up. Something flashed in his silver-grey eyes, but it was gone before Harry could register it – was it hope? He shook his head, took another sip of beer. “Besides,” he added, dabbing his mouth with the back of his hand, “I forgave you a long time ago. We both did terrible things back then.” His gaze slipped down Malfoy’s chest, tracing scars he could not see but could never forget. “I’m sorry,” he meant to say, but could only shape the words, his voice failing. When he did manage to drag his eyes back up to Malfoy’s face, there was a new kind of tension in the air, both confusing and incredibly familiar. Malfoy raised an eyebrow. Harry looked away.
“Didn’t you hear him? There isn’t any other way!” Draco snapped. He pulled his hand from Harry’s grip. Harry frowned, stubborn.
Harry’s laughter caught in his throat, and he coughed, trying to clear it. “Oh, I am, trust me,” he managed to say. He took a deep a deep breath, but it came out ragged and unsteady. One of Draco’s hands slid up to his neck, his thumb brushing the sensitive skin below the angle of his jaw. Harry knew Draco was trying to reassure him, but his touch had the opposite effect. His heart thrummed in his chest as he dug his nails into his palms, trying desperately to resist the urge, no, the need to hold Draco, to be held by him, to lose himself in warm skin and the smell of cedar and pine.
“I want you,” Draco babbled, pushing Harry’s jacket off and attacking the buttons on his shirt with shaking fingers. “I want you, I want you, I want you.”
“That’s great, Harry!” Hermione exclaimed. Her eyes sparkled at just the mention of books. “What are you reading?”
Harry raised his eyebrows and pressed his lips together to supress a disbelieving grin. “Awfully sure of yourself. What makes you think I want to hang out with you?”
“God, today has been such a shit show,” he grumbled. Draco hummed and, disentangling his hand from Harry’s, moved to lie on his side next to him, propped up on one elbow as he looked down at Harry. He reached over and splayed his hand on Harry’s warm stomach, watching it rise and fall with each breath. Harry’s expression softened. “I’m sorry for all that,” he said, his voice just above a whisper. “That was a lot to deal with.”
“Gods, I don’t know if that was incredibly stupid, or incredibly brave,” Draco said, still trying to get his giggles under control.
Back at Hogwarts, Harry collapsed onto his bed with a dramatic sigh. Draco gave a weak chuckle, standing at the bedside with his hands in his pockets. Harry, his feet dangling off the end of the bed, looked up at him with a lopsided smile.
“Oh, that reminds me.” Dean wove his way through the common room and, grabbing a pinch of Floo powder, tossed it into the flames. “Seamus!” he called. “You owe me, babe!”
“That went well,” Draco said sarcastically as Harry came into the office. Draco was sitting in Harry’s usual seat, his feet up on the desk as an origami bird fluttered above him. Harry shook his head.
“Who?” Harry still looked like he was waiting for one of them to admit they were joking, as if this wasn’t already awful enough.
“Uncle Draco,” he asked, his voice timid as he shifted in his seat. Draco raised an eyebrow, letting him know he was listening. “How did you know you were gay?”
As he stepped out of his flat and was about to lock the door behind him, he heard a commotion down the hall. He finished locking up and followed the sound of some incredibly colourful cursing that Harry could have sworn was half in French. It appeared that he wasn’t the only one moving in today. Someone had tripped on their way up the stairs while carrying a box, which had split open and spilled what seemed like several hundred books all over the stairwell. Harry immediately began picking them up, stacking them in his arms, already asking if the man was alright, if he had hurt anything.
Teddy lowered his hands, but remained slumped in his chair, all arms and legs and too much torso. He looked more and more like Lupin every day. “I don’t want to break up over this,” he whispered. “I do like her, I just…”
Draco had to admit, it was very in character. He stood, shaking his head. “Why?” he demanded. “Why do any of it in the first place?”
Draco huffed. He straightened his hair with a pout, checking his reflection again. “Does this look okay?” he asked the mirror.
Draco sighed, but stood up with a small smile. “Fine. But you have to explain to my mother why I’m not spending Christmas dinner with her.”
They talked for hours, just like that first night Draco had shown up at Harry’s doorstep all those years ago, asking for forgiveness. Harry said he should talk to the Weasleys on his own. When Draco asked what he would tell them, Harry stared at his hands and said that he’d tell them the truth.
Harry closed the sliding glass door behind him as he considered Malfoy. “Right,” he said. “Sorry, I just… I was surprised, is all.” Why did Malfoy have to be there, why couldn’t the balcony have been empty when all he wanted was to be alone for a moment’s peace? The balcony in question was not large, maybe about a square metre, just enough space for a small round table in one corner and two men to stand next to each other. Harry leaned over the railing, his arms crossed and shoulders hunched, trying to ignore Malfoy’s heavy gaze on him. He closed his eyes and tried to breathe.
He was surprised, honestly, that he hadn’t seen it earlier. The boy had been curiously drawn to David Bowie at an incredibly young age, and would often blush when either Draco or Harry asked if there was anyone he fancied. They assumed it was normal teenage nerves. And when Teddy had started to date Victoire earlier that year, they thought that was the answer. But now… “I really hate to say this,” Draco said, looking up at his godson-in-law, “but you should talk to Harry. He would know more about this than me.”
Relieved, Draco pulled him in for another kiss, this one slower, sweeter. He pulled away to bite at Harry’s earlobe, turned to nuzzle at the skin just behind it, and whispered, “Can I blow you?” Harry shivered.
“Oh gods! Oh my eyes!” he yelled, covering his eyes with his hands. “Merlin’s saggy tits, is there nothing sacred in this world anymore?”
“You haven’t touched it,” Harry argued. He leaned forward on his crossed arms, his eyes glinting behind his glasses. Draco gestured to the rest of his plate, the breakfast half-eaten.
Draco hated himself for it, but he said it anyway. “Did you say the same thing to Ginevra when you fought?”
“Please,” said Harry, still holding Malfoy’s arm, his grip sliding down to his bony wrist. “I told you last night. We need this. And it’s just the one memory, nothing more.”
“I know,” he said, ducking and giving Draco a quick peck on the cheek just to see him smile. He turned his head to whisper in Draco’s ear, “I just want them to know you’re mine,
“Oh. That.” Malfoy turned his attention back to his textbook – a thick biology textbook with type so small and dense Harry was surprised Malfoy didn’t go blind trying to read it. “Of course. Contrary to what you may think, I have more going on in my life than just being your archnemesis, Potter.”
“No, a Squib, I’m afraid. My family wasn’t pleased. They disowned me and, finding myself on the street, I took to the church instead. You could say it was the rebel in me, wanting to join the very institution that had condemned many of my ancestors to be burned alive, but, in a way, divinity is a bit like magic, just not a kind we can practice.”
Harry shrugged. “It also sounds like him to put the two gay kids in the school in the same room,” he pointed out. Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
“Oh yes,” he said. “I’ve been studying you for weeks now and I could only come to one conclusion – you are hopelessly in love with me.” He laughed as Harry slapped him – gently – on the shoulder, but when he turned his head back to Harry, his expression was no longer indecipherable. Soft and sweet, he looked at Harry as if he was offering him the world with both hands. “I only knew because I know the symptoms,” Draco said, his voice quiet in the still summer air. “Because I’ve been in love with you for years, since the day I met you.”
Stinging Hex aside, he looked nothing like the scrawny teenager kneeling on the Manor’s drawing room floor almost a year ago. No longer on the run, his cheeks had gone from gaunt and hollow to full and ruddy from the sharp wind outside. His stubble was a dark shadow outlining his strong jaw and full lips. His glasses were still dirty and smudged, his black hair still wild and curly, and the lightning shaped scar still stood out silver against his coffee-coloured skin. But this was no boy across from him anymore.
Pansy shrugged, already bored of the topic. “Don’t know, don’t care,” she said. “Can’t imagine he’ll stay in London, seeing as there’s nothing for him here anymore.”
The platform was quiet when Draco arrived. Not many families wanted to send their children back to Hogwarts, and some families had no children to send anymore. Those who were there parted for him like the tide. Some stared, some looked away. He understood. He was a leper, the Mark on his arm the ulcerous lesion. Still, he gritted his teeth and set his jaw as he passed. He was still a Malfoy after all.
They took it slow. Draco learned what Harry liked, found small scars and secret freckles as he explored Harry’s body, felt the waves of Harry’s pleasure as his own. At one point, Harry reached back and grabbed hold of Draco’s hip, pulling him in closer, deeper, even as he pushed back against him, as if trying to pull Draco into his body entirely. Draco pressed himself along the curve of Harry’s back, one arm wrapped around his waist, skin to skin to skin, melting into the man he had loved for so long. Harry came, crying out Draco’s name. Draco followed soon after, the sound of his name pulled from Harry’s mouth like a prayer ringing in his ears.
Draco stared at the wand for a moment, blinking. When he took it, he was surprised his hand didn’t shake. The wand tingled against his skin, electric, but there was something different there too, like an open flame licking up around the core, warm and eager. He frowned.
“I knew you would say that, which was why I wasn’t going to tell you. But come on, Draco, it’ll be fun, I promise.”
“Harry, you can’t go back there,” Draco said firmly. “That is literally child abuse. And neglect. And fuck knows how many other charges.”
Harry scowled at him. “Same here,” he said in a monotone. He squinted at Malfoy’s face, backlit by the window, trying to make out the other boy’s expression. Malfoy remained inscrutable. Harry looked away with a sigh and ran his hand through his wild black curls as he took in the rest of the room. It was the standard room they had been living in since the first year – two single beds, two closets, two pine wood desks and desk chairs, two bookcases, two nightstands. The only luxury was the ensuite toilet, something only students in their last year were given.
Then, there were the times that Harry would show up with a black eye and broken nose, or covered in bruises and scrapes. The first time was on the spring equinox when Harry was twelve – he hadn’t been able to outrun his cousin and his gang that day after school. He showed up to the manor, blood drying on the scratch on his cheek, limping on a sprained ankle. Draco had heard him come in, it seemed, and met him as he was making his way through the drawing room. In a flash, he went from standing in the doorway to right in front of Harry. He knelt down, hands fluttering as he tried but couldn’t touch.
“You still could have at least told them I was here,” Draco hissed. Harry let out another deep sigh.
When he opened his eyes, he let out a sharp bark of laughter and immediately covered his mouth to muffle the sound. He had done it. Almost shaking with giddiness, he reached out a hand towards his star-lit Patronus.
As they made their way out of the entrance hall and into the atrium proper, filing in amongst the other well-dressed Ministry members, they tried to ignore the looks and whispers behind their backs. Instead, Harry pointed out how they had set up a spell to make the ceiling look like the night sky, just like at Hogwarts, and Draco in turn pointed out the moving ice sculptures of reindeer on high pedestals that cocked their heads and pawed at the marble beneath their feet.
“That’s an impressive bit of magic,” said Draco, handing the map back. Harry placed it on top of a folded cloak on the bench behind them. Draco suspected that it wasn’t his school cloak, not the way it shimmered in the silver light.
Harry couldn’t believe it at first. It didn’t look like the Malfoy he knew. He sat apart from the rest of the Slytherins, his once proud head hung low as he picked at the food on his plate. His hair was no longer slicked back and was instead loose and un-styled around his pale and pointed face. He seemed to fold into himself, as if he could make himself invisible simply by taking up the least amount of space possible. Harry kept finding his gaze drift over to where Malfoy sat, wary at first but with growing curiosity and sympathy, until Hermione raised an eyebrow at him and he forced himself to focus on the conversation around him.
would like it if my baby spoke French in bed.” Draco blushed crimson, but nodded eagerly all the same.
. It definitely wasn’t an opportunity for Potter to, oh, he didn’t know, drop by his instead, maybe share some take away and watch those wonderful Muggle moving pictures Potter had introduced him to years ago. He wouldn’t, though. Potter only came over when he needed something. Draco frowned and flicked his wand at the fire under the cauldron, which flickered once before disappearing without a trace. “You were saying about the Greek case?”
“Come on, Teddy,” he mumbled, wrapping an arm around his godson’s shoulders, “let’s get out of the line of fire.”
“I….” Harry caught himself. It wasn’t his truth to tell, he told himself. As always, though, he needn’t have bothered.
Half an hour later, Joseph gave him a tight-lipped smile. He tapped a finger against his empty espresso cup as he leaned back in his chair. Harry sighed and crossed his arms low across his waist.
Harry, startled by Malfoy’s blatant honesty, let out a chuckle. “So you just fancied a cup of tea with your old school rival?” he asked.
Harry sped up so he was a few paces ahead, probably so Draco couldn’t see him turn a whole new shade of scarlet. “Nope!” he said. “That’s not what I said!”
“I think I love you too, Draco,” he said. He sat up to lean his forehead against Draco’s, their noses brushing. “I love you so much,” he murmured. Draco’s heart sped at the words, and he grinned stupidly, even as Harry pulled him into another, deeper kiss.
That weekend was a Hogsmeade weekend. The night before, the first snow of the season fell, covering the grounds in a bright white frost. It wouldn’t stick around for long, and it wouldn’t properly snow for another week or two, but it was enough to get everyone excited that Friday night. The eighth years huddled around the common room window, watching the fluffy snowflakes fall with a wondering light in their eyes. It was like the war had never happened and they were all eleven again, experiencing their first snow at Hogwarts. Even Draco stood at the back of the group, a small smile on his thin lips as he watched the snowflakes float past outside.
“Did you know,” he said in a low voice, “that the Sorting Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin?” He glanced over at Draco. Draco’s brow furrowed, an endearing little crease forming at the edge of his mouth as he frowned. “But I refused, so it put me in Gryffindor. Can you imagine if I had let it sort me into Slytherin? If we had been friends this whole time, instead of enemies?”
“Okay, that’s it,” said Harry as he attempted to shove Draco out of the way. “If you can’t behave, you can go wait in the office.”
Draco’s shoulders slumped as he sidestepped away from Harry, his head spinning. Harry turned away from him, but Draco could have sworn he was holding back a laugh.
“Yes, Father,” Malfoy was saying into the phone, his voice unusually subdued and contrite. “I understand, Father. Of course, Father. Best behaviour. Of course.” He let out a long breath he had been holding, and Harry saw his shoulders drop a little – not that he was slouching, Malfoy’s posture was always perfect. When Malfoy spoke next, Harry forgot his book entirely.
“Harry? Draco? How’s it – oh.” Hermione put a hand over her mouth to stifle the gasp at the sight of her best friend in a passionate embrace with Draco Malfoy. Ron came up behind her, and regretted it immediately.
He had only wanted his wand back. In the middle of the Battle was perhaps not the best time to confront Potter about it, but he had been desperate, and maybe what he really wanted was to see him again, to make sure he was safe. Instead, he put him in danger, and Potter had to save him from all-consuming flames.
Draco rolled his eyes with a chuckle. “Good lord, you’re hopeless,” he said, grinning. “But yes, I think I’m on to something, we’re starting trials tomor-”
“Not funny,” he warned him before going off to get a washcloth and some healing salves from the bathroom. When he came back, Draco’s eyes were closed and his breathing shallow. Harry sat beside him, careful not to jostle him too much. He began to dab gently at the drying blood on his mouth and chin. Draco winced then relaxed as Harry rubbed the salves into his bruises. Every so often, Harry would get distracted by one of the silvery scars that crisscrossed Draco’s chest. He’d seen them all by now, but even so, he leaned down to kiss them, small acts of repentance on Draco’s skin. Draco’s hand came up to brush lightly up Harry’s arm, his shoulder, fingers finally curling into the hair at the nape of his neck.
Harry said nothing. He didn’t lower his hands, so he missed the thoughtful look Draco gave him. He did, however, feel the cushions shift and move, and felt cool hands tugging at his own.
“He must feel very out of place here. I heard that he’s been working in a Muggle restaurant for the past two years. Shame he hasn’t been able to find any proper work,” Robards added, a knowing gleam in his eye. Harry tried to keep his lip from curling. His magic, on the other hand, had no problem showing its displeasure. He felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end as the electrical charge began to build in his fingertips, and he clenched his fists, trying to hold himself together.
“Are you just going to stand there watching me this whole time?” he snapped, but there was no malice behind it. Harry tried to stifle his smile. He turned so that he leaned his back against the counter, giving Draco just enough space to work with.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. His eyes were cool but Harry could see him twisting a family signet ring around his right index finger nervously. “I see your intelligence hasn’t improved since we were in school,” he said with a hint of his old drawl. “I’m gay, Potter.”
Andromeda wagged a finger at him, her eyes sparkling with mirth and tears. “I will hold you to that, Harry James Potter, don’t think I won’t!”
“Hey,” he murmured, putting one hand on Teddy’s knee. “You know that we love you no matter what, right? You could kill someone and we would hide the body.”
He turned, pressing his shoulder into the wall as he furrowed his brow at Malfoy. “How did you find Ivanovich, then? Craigslist?”
“Yeah! I went into work, had a panic attack, and after a cup of tea I walked right into Robards’ office and quit! So now I’m celebrating!”
Draco shook his bowed head. “No, no, I understand that,” he said. “I accepted that the minute you started talking about applying to university. No, it’s just…” He looked up at Harry then, a strained set to his jaw. “I think it’s time I told you the whole story.”
Lucius raised a hand to silence him, his face turning away in disgust. “No, no, I won’t hear of it,” he snapped. “Once you’re married and settled, and you have produced an heir, you may do what you want, so long as it is discreet and does not come back to this family. You can never make any of that public, you understand? Our name has already been tarnished enough.”
It was Hermione. Her bushy hair flickered in the flames as she leaned forward and called, “I know you’re there, I can see your shoes.”
They soon fell into a pattern. Draco would wait in the common room in front of the fire until Potter – “Harry, Jesus,” he corrected Draco, “we don’t need to keep calling each other by our family names” – Harry would inevitably come down, wearing his jogger and jumper and filthy sneakers.
“Someone was trying to frame Malfoy and take out Ivanovich at the same time,” Harry finished with a nod. “Yes, sir, I think that’s exactly what’s happening here.”
Most of the teachers left with the students over the winter holiday. Harry, who loved Hogwarts at Christmas time, planned on staying and spending Christmas evening at the Burrow with the Weasleys. Draco, on the other hand…
Always the Gryffindor. Or maybe, Draco wondered as he narrowed his eyes at the other boy, he was hiding a truth. Either way, Hannah didn’t seem to care.
“Sweet God in Heaven,” he said, leaning his head back, “I think my life just flashed before my eyes.”
Draco awoke with a start. He sat up in the bed, gasping and looking frantically around, trying to make sense of his surroundings. It was only when his gaze fell on the man next to him that he began to remember.
Harry raised an eyebrow but didn’t say anything. He pulled the shirt away from his nose. The bleeding had stopped.
Harry shook his head, grinning. “No, Humphries here is an Animagus. He just prefers being in cat form. And since he’s here mainly for guard duty, I gave him leave to make himself, well, comfortable.”
Molly spun around. One of the pots that had been cleaning itself in the sink clattered into the basin with a splash. Charlie squeezed a pea pod too tightly and a pea shot across the room, hitting the window across from them. Harry shrunk down into his seat with a sheepish smile. Molly opened and closed her mouth in shock. Charlie pursed his lips to stifle his laughter.
They both collapsed on top of each other, sticky and sweaty and out of breath. Harry just had enough in him to pull off his trousers and pants and put his glasses on the bedside table before casting a quick cleaning spell and settling back against Draco. He cuddled against Draco’s chest, their legs tangled together and Draco’s arms around him. They lay there in the soft silence, listening to their breaths slow and deepen as they drifted off to sleep.
, citrus and mint. Draco’s fingers curled into Harry’s hair as he closed his eyes, giving in to the breathy moan rising in his chest. After almost two months of being together, Harry had proved a quick study, learning exactly what made Draco fall apart under him. And after today, all he wanted was to prove – to who? Hermione? Ron? Himself? – that he knew Draco, this Draco, inside and out.
“Not just any girl, Harry,” Ron insisted. “She’s amazing. She’s super smart, she’s trying to get into Oxford, or Cambridge, and she has all these ideas for political reform…”
“There is nothing else, Draco. I promise, it’ll be okay. I’ll come with you. I’ll be there the whole time. But we have to tell him.”
. A boy with bright green eyes and sun-kissed skin, grimy from a year on the run. In that moment, as they were forced nose to nose, as his aunt, his mother, his father demanded to know – “Is it him? Draco, is it him?” – he understood.
“– are you doing here? I haven’t seen you in years!” The reflected light from the fountain sparkled in Harry’s glasses as he pushed them up his slightly crooked nose. He looked Draco up and down slowly, a hungry gleam in his eye, as if he had been starving before he saw Draco. Draco chastised himself. He was being dramatic, ridiculous. Harry must have noticed something. His smile fell, and he put his hand on Draco’s arm in concern. His touch burned straight through Draco’s skin like an open flame. “Draco?” he asked, the name like honey on his lips. “Is everything alright?”
Harry leaned back, biting his lip as he looked away. His gaze landed on the Sorting Hat, sitting silently on its perch, and he let out a quiet laugh.
Draco sat back in his chair. Harry seemed to still be processing this new information. Draco rubbed his jaw with one hand. “Okay,” he said. “That’s a new one.”
Harry rolled his eyes, shoving his hands into his trouser pockets. “And why would I do that?” he asked. “Have something to hide, do you?”
“Better?” he asked. Draco’s smile faded as his gaze lingered on Harry’s smiling mouth. He shook his head, a few white-blonde hairs falling into his eyes. He pushed them back and turned away.
It was not how Harry thought a normal privy council meeting would start. Neither, it seemed, did the king’s councillors, who barely had time to hide their shock behind polite expressions. Harry watched them carefully with narrowed eyes. The councillors had not been pleased to see him enter the council chamber – a relatively small room just off the throne room that still maintained the vaulted ceilings and elegant stonework of the rest of the castle. The older elves had muttered under their breaths with disapproving glances as Harry, uncertain if there were rules about where to sit, simply grabbed a chair at random and dragged it, none too quietly, up against the wall and away from the great oak table. Many of them had not only supported King Lucius’s anti-human campaigns, but actively carried out their own ‘purifications’ of their lands.
Harry’s mouth twitched. “Yeah, but from what I understand, sex is a big part of it,” he pointed out. Draco shrugged.
“Why are you telling me this?” he asked. Malfoy shrugged. His smile was crooked when he finally met Harry’s gaze.
“Draco.” Harry stepped forward, his hands cradling Draco’s face as he pulled him in, pressed his lips to his, hard and insistent. “I want this,” he whispered against Draco’s mouth. “I want
“Ron,” Harry warned, trying to keep his voice calm and level. “Your fight isn’t with him, it’s with me, alright?”
“So you admit this is a dangerous situation?” Harry countered, staying firmly on the path. Draco huffed.
Ron’s hand holding his wand shook. He readjusted his grip and took a broken, trembling breath. Harry turned fully to Draco. “I didn’t know that about Lucius,” he said quietly. Draco blinked, wiped away the tears with the heel of his palm.
“I guess I am,” he replied. He cocked his head and looked Harry up and down. Harry couldn’t quite make out his face, but he saw something flash in those storm grey eyes that made his stomach clench. “What’s your name?” the man asked curiously.
Harry laughed and shook his head. Draco had been getting ready for the better part of two hours. The last time he had checked in on him, Draco was yelling at his reflection while only wearing a towel – that had been an hour ago. He leaned against the wall, one foot braced against the base board, and shoved his hands into his pockets. It had been a long two months.
Potter nodded. He set his cup down. “I can understand that,” he said. He reached out then and took the hand Draco still had in his lap. Draco jumped at the contact, almost spilling tea on himself. Potter’s hand was warm and dry, his palm and fingertips rough and calloused against Draco’s skin. Potter held his hand and gave it a small squeeze. Draco stared at it, disbelieving. He glanced up at Potter, leaning forward in his chair and looking at Draco with his earnest green eyes, and felt like Potter had struck him with lightning. “Try it,” Potter was saying. Draco struggled to listen to him as electricity burned through his veins under the other man’s gaze. “Come back to Hogwarts this next term. If it’s too much, you don’t have to stay. Just… try.”
Draco snuck into the quiet bedroom, holding his shoes in one hand. He could just make out the tangle of black hair poking out from under the covers. He set the shoes down by the door and began undressing as quickly and stealthily as he could. He slipped into the bed, wearing nothing but his pants, settling in behind the sleeping man. Harry whined.
“No,” Harry spluttered, leaning forward in his chair, “no, I don’t understand! Professor, we can’t let him go back! It’s too dangerous! We have to protect him!”
Draco let out a slightly hysterical laugh. “I thought you didn’t like me!” he said with a shaky grin. “I thought the kiss was just an, I don’t know, an experiment, that it didn’t mean anything, and if it did – I thought I’d ruined everything!”
“It better not. Now, since you’ve not done anything wrong, I want you to think of this as a friendly warning, nothing more, do you understand?” Harry nodded. “Good. As for the, er, subject of Weasley’s caterwauling….”
“You punched me in the face in third year,” Draco said, pointing his finger at her. “I’m not saying I didn’t deserve it, but still.”
“If you ever wanted,” Draco whispered, as if he couldn’t believe he was saying the words out loud, “you could kiss me. You know, to see if you like it.”
“What, because it’s two men having sex?” Draco shot back. Hermione blushed and flapped her hands at him.
“You don’t have to just teach at Hogwarts, you know,” Draco pointed out. “You could go anywhere. Go to America and teach at Ilvermorny. I hear Americans love a British accent. Or Beauxbatons, although you might break my heart and run off with a French person.”
The gravel crunched under their feet as the three kids made their way past the rusted iron gates up the drive. One was a girl, with thick curls, dark skin and buckteeth, wearing a maroon T-shirt and baggy shorts belted around her waist. The other two were young boys, a red-head covered in freckles whose hand-me-down jeans had massive holes in the knees, and a boy with wild black hair and round, wire-rimmed glasses taped together at the bridge. The black-haired boy had a scar like a bolt of lightning on his forehead that nicked his left eyebrow. The air smelled of sun-baked earth, dusty and heavy with pollen. Ron, the red-head, sneezed.
Harry shrugged. His eyes were so big behind his glasses, he looked ten years younger, just like he had back in Madame Malkin’s shop, trying so hard to not look scared shitless. But this time, Draco didn’t sneer at him. He nodded again, and let the ghost of a smile cross his lips.
“Then,” Draco continued, clearing his throat, “I saw the news when I went back into town for more supplies, and I saw that – that…” He swallowed and broke off, looking down at his hands. The kettle whistled, startling them both. Harry got up and got the tea things together along with a plate of biscuits. Once Malfoy had his cup of tea and had practically inhaled all the custard creams, he picked up his story.
Draco, who like Harry had turned at Ron’s voice, stiffened beside him. Harry once again had to resist the urge to hold his hand, this time to restrain him from saying anything stupid. But Draco just inclined his head, first to Ron, then to Hermione, his expression a polite mask. Harry let out a small breath of relief.
Kellen had managed to prop Draco up and was helping him press a linen handkerchief to his bleeding nose. As Harry fell to his knees beside him, he heard her murmur, “This is going to hurt”, then a quick “
Andromeda smiled wearily at Harry as Teddy bounded up to his godfather. He hugged Harry tight, his head up to Harry’s waist now. As always when he was around Harry, his hair matched Harry’s black curls, unruly and wild. He couldn’t help but notice that Teddy was wearing Sirius’s old leather jacket Harry had given him last Christmas, even though it was a warm early July afternoon. When Andromeda finally drew level with him, she reached over and squeezed his arm. There were a few more liver spots on her bony hands, more laugh lines around her warm brown eyes, more grey in her mousy hair. Harry smiled back, his heart in a vice.
“So, tell me,” said Narcissa, taking a sip of her tea – black, with sugar, just like Draco. “How was your first term of teaching, Draco?”
“No, no, dear, you just sit and have a chat with me,” she said. “Ron tells me you have a new boyfriend. What’s his name?”
Draco winced and muttered under his breath, “Can we please stop using his name?” Harry couldn’t hear him over the blood roaring in his ears.
“If that were true, any case involving ex-Death Eaters or dark magic would be a conflict of interest for you, Potter,” he pointed out, handing Harry the file. “Besides, Kellen can’t take point on this, she’s still a Junior Auror and needs a Senior to oversee things.”
“Fine,” he said. His hands folded in his lap, prim and proper. “I’ve been keeping busy, as you can see. You should feel honoured that I’m spending my precious lunch break with you. My free time is sacred now, I’m sure you understand.”
Harry looked over at Ron, who was struggling not to scowl at Draco next to his wife. “Please stop trying to curse my boyfriend with your mind,” Harry said wearily. “Tonight is hard enough as it is.”
Harry shrugged. “Nothing important,” he mumbled. Draco turned his head to look at him, one thin eyebrow raised.
Harry blinked. He had expected Malfoy to fight it, to whinge about being stuck with the Gryffindors, maybe even demand that he get his own room. But Hermione was right – Malfoy had changed, and that more than anything worried Harry.
Then, there was a soft clap from the shadows. Harry’s head shot up. As if materialising from the stone wall, a woman suddenly appeared, still clapping slowly as she approached him. Her white-gold hair was pulled into a low bun, and her high-collared black dress lent a solemn severity to her fine-boned features. Her blue eyes were like the summer sky – infinite and warm.
“What do you think?” he spat. “Father never approved of who I am, but it wasn’t like I was waiting around for him to die to start dating Harry!”
Down the hall, Harry thought he could hear Ron and Hermione calling his name. He turned his head to look. There they were again, and this time he could make out his name clearly as his friends called for him.
Harry’s smile grew small as he considered Draco. Draco shifted under the weight of his gaze, rubbing the tears from his cheeks as he glanced out the window at the countryside rolling away beside them.
Ron looked ready to kill him when Draco stepped into their living room, ash still on his shoulders from the fireplace.
Draco looked up at him, his eyes red-rimmed and puffy from crying. “I kissed you.” It wasn’t a question, just a simple barely audible affirmation. Harry gave him a small smile.
“Draco. Draco Malfoy.” He paused. Then he smiled at Harry, small and incredulous, as he whispered, “Gods, you look just like him.”
“Oh yeah. I heard about that. No wonder he’s keeping his head low I guess. Still, wouldn’t be surprised if he follows in Daddy’s footsteps, if you know what I mean.”
“You’ve heard everything. You know. So just get down here. Fight me. Stop me. Whatever you’re here to do, just do it. Or I’ll Stun you and leave you here. Your choice.” Malfoy crossed his arms, tapping his foot as he waited. Harry bit his lip, then sighed.
“Is that what you think?” Draco’s lip curled. “You think I want to be working in a Muggle café? You think I want to be making coffee for a living? You think that if any wizarding establishment would have me, which they won’t because of the damn Mark on my arm, that I would still be working for minimum wage at a fucking café?”
and often kept them updated on the latest scoop. “In any case,” she continued, “according to all the gossip, turns out they were both in love with someone else. Ginny’s off with that Luna Lovegood of all people – I know right?” she exclaimed when Draco almost spat out his wine in shock. “I mean, it makes sense and all. But still. Apparently they make quite the power couple.”
Harry swore under his breath. He pushed his hands under Draco’s navy blue jumper, calloused palms rubbing up Draco’s stomach and sides. “Bed,” he growled against Draco’s bruised and bitten lips. “Now.”
“Of course.” Harry gave him a lop-sided smile. “But only if you come to the Burrow for Christmas dinner.”
Draco, not quite knowing what to say, stayed quiet. He turned so that he could face Potter, leaning one arm on the railing of the balustrade. He considered the smaller man. Potter was only about a head shorter than Draco, and though his frame was narrow there was muscle there, a solidness and strength. He was only wearing grey joggers and a green jumper that was slightly too big for him. His sneakers were filthy. Draco found himself oddly self-conscious in the face of such blatant comfort. He was still wearing his uniform, not having changed for bed as he had left the common room for his evening walk. He wished he had filled out like Potter had, so easily fitting into adulthood. But when Potter looked at him like that, he felt a little less uncomfortable in his skin, a little more at home.
“Nothing,” he murmured. Harry pursed his lips. But before he could say anything, they had reached Dumbledore’s office door. Harry knocked.
Parkinson sneered at him, his thin lips curling like a hyena’s. “I bet you’re gay,” he said, his voice low.
He had to admit, there was something about the way Draco could silence a room that sent a thrill down Harry’s spine. In that same beat, though, he also admitted that this was not the time, place, nor person.
Draco took his hand, and Harry pulled him to his feet. Draco knew he was blushing, could feel his cheeks and ears burning, but he didn’t care. He could hear the others whispering and giggling, could hear Astoria calling his name, but it didn’t matter. Harry’s hand was warm in his, and Harry was pulling him towards the stairs up to the dorms, and all he could see was Harry, Harry, Harry. Someone wolf-whistled behind them – Draco had a sneaking suspicion it was Luna.
“See here,” she said in her usual dreamy voice, “You have a faint head line that begins below the life line. That means intellect or reasoning not being fully used, a traumatic childhood, shyness or defensiveness due to hidden insecurity.”
“Oh,” she said. Harry looked sheepishly at her, half-turning into Draco as if to hide from her surprise. “
“Christ, Harry,” Hermione gasped. Ron turned beet red. Harry’s eyes gleamed wickedly behind his glasses, taking a twisted pleasure in getting a rise out of his best friend, just this once.
Harry let out a disbelieving bark of laughter. “I thought you had moved on,” he admitted. “I heard from friends that you were with someone. Ted or someone.”
Harry showed Draco all the secret passageways, all of his favourite nooks and corners, and Draco did the same. They explored the castle together, rediscovered their home together. Some nights Harry would drag him down to the kitchens, insisting that Draco wasn’t eating enough. They would get sandwiches and treats from the always obliging house elves before setting off on their nightly exploration, having themselves a little picnic in abandoned classrooms or forgotten towers. Then there were nights like tonight, when Harry suddenly turned to him under the Cloak and asked, “Have you seen the greenhouses at night?”
“Dumbledore… he and I were trying to find one of Voldemort’s Horcruxes, but we had failed, and he was weak… When he heard you coming, he made me put on the Cloak and cast a Full Body Bind on me. I saw everything, and I could do nothing to stop it.” Tears were slipping down Potter’s cheeks as he took in a shaking breath. “I’m sorry, Draco. I’m sorry for everything.”
As their lips met, Draco was pretty sure he could hear murmurs from the balcony above. For once, Draco didn’t care. It had been ten years since he’d known Harry’s touch, tasted him sweet on his tongue. Their kiss deepened, Harry’s hands at his hips, running up his back, pulling him closer, ever closer. Draco buried his hand in Harry’s curls, pulling just a little, just to hear that quiet moan. His other arm wrapped around Harry’s waist, holding him there, there.
“No, no,” he said. “I am an enchanter, a warlock of some renown… in my own kingdom at least. The last Elven necromancer was killed a few decades ago, shortly after my coronation, otherwise I would not deign to bring one of your ilk into my lands.”
This continued for years. During the summers, almost always on Sundays, Draco would slip away from the Manor and make his way to the church in time for the matins. He would stand in the back or in an empty pew, away from the rest of the congregation, then leave before the service was over. The first time he sat in on a Mass, he watched in confusion as the parishioners queued for the communion. He did it once, but found he disliked the tasteless wafer and the bitter wine. The priest had chuckled when he made a face at the wine, and only smiled when Draco scowled at him.
Harry shook his head, forcing himself to focus on the man in the silver throne on the raised dais. Behind the dais were tall glass windows, outside of which he could just make out the shadowy forms of tentacled creatures swimming through the cloudy water. But when he did lay eyes on the man, all thought of his surroundings was silenced. He knew elves were meant to be beautiful, but the word no longer held any meaning.
“I had to spend a couple of years on my own,” he corrected him. “One night stands to forget Alec in, months alone to remember what it was like to just be me. I told myself that you would never be an option, given our history – and in my defence,” he added, raising an eyebrow, “I thought you were straight.”
“Slow down, Potter,” he murmured, his hand brushing against Harry’s neck, fingers threading into his curls. “Just enjoy it.”
Pansy threw up her hands in exasperation. “Because you are fucking miserable, you prick!” she exclaimed. “When you’re not working, you’re home, by yourself, and when you’re not doing that, you’re getting drunk off your tits and having lousy one night stands that make you even more miserable than before! You’re not happy, Draco. You haven’t been in a really long time. So I’m sorry for trying, alright? But don’t you dare come crawling to me for help when you realise the best thing for you is about to go back to fucking Scotland thinking that the love of his life is better off without him.”
The balcony was screened off from the rest of the flat by a filmy curtain. Harry was so set on getting outside that he hadn’t stopped to think if there would be anyone else out there. He wrenched open the sliding glass door and froze. He’d know that white blond hair anywhere.
love with each other.” He shrugged, nestling his chin against his knees. “She’s off training with the Kestrels now, so, you know, she’s doing well.”
“You had said you wanted to know more about your family,” he said, fidgeting with the hem of his grey jumper. “I had Mother send this to me and had it rebound – it was falling apart, I don’t think anyone’s looked at in ages, but I thought, maybe…”
They all exchanged anticipatory looks with each other. The girls seemed to all be debating who would say Potter’s name first, while the boys were doing the mental calculations of how they could go the rest of the night without saying his name, because of course, no homo. Draco saw Potter’s eyes flick over to him and away again so quickly, he might have been mistaken. His heart stuttered in his chest, and his stomach rolled so violently he thought in a moment of panic that he might vomit. Like hell was he going to see any of these fawning fan girls kiss Potter. He made to stand up, to make his excuses, to escape to the quiet of their dorm, when Potter caught his eye and, for the first time in a week, held it.
George eventually confessed to all of it. The officers on the scene had found the mask and cloak in his closet along with the Skeleton Key, a small bronze token suspended on a leather string. By that evening, he was arrested and his hearing set. Kellen broke the news to Harry and Draco as they sat at the kitchen table. She looked exhausted, her scarlet Auror robes dirty and torn from where she fallen during the chase. When she finished, she examined the bruise blooming on the skin of her upper arm where it showed through her torn robe, and tutted. “My wife’s going to be so upset,” she murmured, “she cried last time I sprang my ankle while on duty.”
