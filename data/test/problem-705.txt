Harry shrugged, "He didn't throw up if you mean that. Then again, I'm pretty sure, Malfoys have a way of puking that no one else notices."
Harry was apparating home from the office. He was looking forward to seeing Draco at home. Recently he had been very clingy and was looking for cuddles and hugs all the time, it was quite atypical for Draco, but he always claimed to be freezing and his need for body contact not coming from attachment.
"Yeah, he prefers dragons over people and sex now, but back then he once researched it. I only remember that coldness is a symptom. Like, they get really cold all the time and need to be cuddled and curled up in a bunch of blankets. Don't ask me why I think it was something about the body using all its energy to accommodate to the baby and so on."
"Draco", Harry whispered, he sat on the ground next to him and softly ran his fingers over his cheek, "It was just a bogart, love", he promised him.
"Mrs Malfoy he really didn't know", Hermione said calmly, "Just let them talk, I'm sure everything will be fine then. Draco will be happy to hear that Harry came all the way just to beg him for forgiveness."
Draco didn't want to open them, so instead, he went through all the dressers and old wooden furniture where Kreacher could have hidden the record, he also looked under and between them. He was coughing from the dust and wiped his hands on his trousers disgusted.
"That's why one house-elf just isn't enough", Narcissa muttered and then went back to the room on the left that she had come from, Ron and Hermione followed her.
"You're not anymore and I know that. Ron and Hermione are here with me, I told the Weasley's about us. Molly insists that you come with me for Christmas. They accept you, and Molly will treat our baby like her own Grandchild. It will be wonderful."
"He did apologise to me for it when we were at Hogwarts after the war", Hermione said, "He seemed genuine."
Harry smiled, "You just couldn't say that like a normal person, could you?", he stood up, cupped his cheeks and kissed him.
Scorpius was looked at him with his big, green eyes in his pale face. He really was a spotting image of Draco short for the eyes.
The rest of the Weasleys slowly came to the platform, to see the kids off, many hugs and kisses were going around.
Harry pursed his lips, "How about you get to decide the name of our son and I'm keeping my mouth shut about it?"
Hermione patted his shoulder, "Okay, so maybe we can accept you and him, still, why didn't you tell us about him and you sooner?"
He also tried to make up past mistakes and spent a lot of time with Harry's friend Hermoine, asking her to tell him about Muggle stuff. It was her who had brought him to a Muggle tattoo artist, who hadn't been able to cover his dark mark but had tattooed a bunch of flowers around it, to hide it and make it look more peaceful - many daffodils and lilies. Harry loved it.
Draco smiled, “Don’t feel pressured by your dad’s family”, he said, “No one’s gonna love you less when you don’t get into Gryffindor.”
Harry carefully put his hand on Draco’s baby bump, smiling lovingly at the thought that his baby was in there.
The train started driving off and Draco and Harry waved to their son, Lilly waved too while shouting “Bye Scorpi”
When Harry just shrugged, Malfoy continued, "As for this couch though, the colour isn't bad", then he leaned down to him to whisper: "Do you think I'd look good against it, naked, under you?"
Tall and pale, in dark robes, his eyes were shining red in the dim light and he had an evil grin on his face.
"No. It was... it was a weird situation. I'm honestly still not quite sure what the big deal was... He made a stupid joke, I didn't fall for it and then laughed at him about it until he hexed me and left. Okay, I shouldn't have laughed at him. But I apologised for that in a letter. That's no reason to just stop seeing me altogether, is it?"
"Six months? Bloody hell, Harry, why didn't you tell us about it? Any of it? Any reason you keep it secret from us when you have a boyfriend?", Ron asked, "I'm not gonna be mad because of Ginny if you're worried about that."
Harry had noticed this and bought a record player for him and loud rock music to scare the silence away.
Malfoy shrugged, asked "Shower?" And when Harry pointed to the door leading to the attached bathroom, Malfoy stood up completely shameless, not bothering to cover himself with anything, while walking to the door, "I would enjoy some tea before I leave, if you don't mind, that is", he said before disappearing in the shower.
“And what if I don’t make Gryffindor or Slytherin?”, Scorpius asked annoyed, “There are four houses, and the hat is supposed to sort me based on me and not by analysing my family tree. And what if I don’t want to be a seeker either?”
Ron finally decided for shock and stared at Harry out of wide eyes, who quickly cast a cleaning spell over the table.
It was Draco’s first Christmas at the burrow. Since Scorpius' birth both Molly and Narcissa were constantly at Grimmauld Place, so he wasn't nervous about seeing Molly, but he was pretty nervous about spending the Christmas days all the way to the new year with Harry's entire adopted family.
The Rest of the Weasleys wasn't necessarily thrilled when they first heard about Harry (sort of) dating Draco, but they gladly listened to Harry's reasons and to him gushing over his time with him. When Harry told them, Draco was apparently expecting a child from him on a final note, it sealed the deal even for Molly.
"It's okay", Harry said softly, "It's over. Don't you want to get up from the ground? It's dirty as a dragon cave."
"Yes, I had a... let's say 'business meeting' in a pub not far from here and when I walked past this house, I figured I could very well see if you're home."
But there was the possibility that the Weasleys felt differently about this. And he also wanted to keep this a secret from the press for different reasons.
He had to get out of this cousin-incest ridden house. The dark walls and hallways, the weird noises in black corners. It made him nervous, he kept hearing the voices of his family members whenever it was too quiet in this house, which it always seemed to be.
But despite all that, it didn't feel like a relationship the way it had felt with Ginny. Not because of the lack of feelings, Harry had plenty of feelings for Draco that were beyond horny. But it was the fact that no one knew. He could guess that Draco told Pansy, but he didn't even tell Hermione and Ron, let alone the rest of the Weasleys.
Also, what would a child coming from the two of them even be like? Probably have a pointy face like Malfoy and Harry's dark mess of hair - Draco would have that. They would be sorted into Slytherin for sure, how the press would love that one!
The third time was intentional. It was around 9 in the evening, when someone knocked on the door. Harry didn't expect anyone, so he told Kreacher to open and if it were "certain people" he should tell him he wasn't home.
Harry apologized again and kissed him softly, "I'll make it up to you", he promised and winked suggestively.
He could still remember the hate in his eyes, when Draco had told him in his 5th year he didn't want to be a death eater - soon afterwards Lucius was put into Azkaban and Draco had felt obliged to help the death eaters get into Hogwarts.
"Without him, I would be dead.", Harry stated, "When we were at Malfoy Manor, he knew it was me. He didn't tell them. Then, at the Battle of Hogwarts, he threw me his wand so I could fight against Voldemort. I go so far to say, without him, we would have lost."
Harry swallowed hard and licked over his lips, "I think you look good against everything when you're naked", he mumbled and then kissed Malfoy. Malfoy put his hands-on Harry's shoulders and straddled his thighs. He was sitting on him, making out passionately while slowly pushing his thin, white fingers into his black hair, slightly pulling on it. Harry hastily opened the tiny buttons on Draco’s shirt until he was able to push it off his shoulders and roam his hands over his perfect pale skin, while Malfoy dropped his hands to Harry's trousers.
So, most days Harry took the liberty to not think about the status of their relationship or when and if and how he should tell people about it.
He was glad, that Harry was a half-blood and wouldn't let him get away with his pureblood bullshit when it happened to find its way back into his speech.
He had spent some time couch surfing at Pansy's or Blaise' place until Harry found him and asked him to move in with him.
"I shouldn't have", Harry agreed, "I'm so sorry. Please forgive me, love. I just want you to come back home, so I can be there for you and our baby."
"They can have children. Like conceive, carry, give birth - birth apparition spells come in handy with that one I'm sure."
After rolling around in the bed that seemed too big and too empty now for months, he came to a fighting conclusion: He fucking loved the bastard.
Almost the entire Weasley family lay on the ground or crashed into each other when they tried to walk away, all of their shoelaces were tied to each other. In the middle of the mess of red hair stood Sirius, doubling over in laughter.
Harry figured he should write another letter to Draco and then just give him time. Draco's pride and ego were probably hurt, he would come around once he calmed down.
"Harry Potter is dead", and he let out a hideous, evil laugh that burned itself into Dracos nightmares.
Before Christmas Draco had been constantly wearing Harry's Christmas Sweaters at home because they were big and warm and hid his body that he tried to get back in shape.
"You want to go all the way to France just to be hexed by Narcissa Malfoy?", she rolled her eyes, "Gryffindor’s got strange hobbies."
“Then half of your uncles will lose a lot of money and I will laugh about that until Christmas”, Draco said.
Draco stumbled backwards until he fell over one of the Sirius boxes and fell to the ground, Voldemort walked, no Draco would say slithered, over to him.
Hermione shook her head, "I believe you he changed, but still, he bullied us and was a death eater. You can forgive him all you want, but falling in love with him?"
Ron seemed to hope it would trigger something in Hermione. But she only smiled at him and shook her head.
"No", Harry rolled his eyes, "We're both blokes, how am I supposed to knock him up? It's not possible."
"What?!", Narcissa's voice was heard from the room down the corridor and then the woman appeared, she came storming down to them with her wand out.
"Fuck, Draco", Harry whispered, it was probably the first time he addressed Draco as Draco and he liked how it sounded, he liked even more how eagerly Draco kissed him when he said it.
"Wish I was, man. I had an uncle of some sort, who carried all of his children himself. It adds that many pureblood families have some kind of creature in their family trees that also enable them to have this kind of pregnancy. I always thought he looks like he's got some Veela in him."
"What was the joke?", Hermione asked thoughtfully, "Maybe he was serious, and you just made fun of it. That would upset anyone."
Draco closed the book and sat up straight, "Do you have any idea how scared I was to tell you about it? And then you just laughed at me."
Harry was finally satisfied with the Potter house and they were in the middle of preparations to move.
Harry frowned. He tilted his head to the side. Why would Draco say something like that? Was it his idea of humour? Did he think it was funny? Should Harry laugh just to satisfy him?
"Bloody git", Harry mumbled but he leaned down and kissed his temple, "You still made those bloody badges and handed them around everywhere?"
"We can’t go back to England right away. My healer and everything I need is here, my mother prepared everything, I will give birth here. Then we can go back."
After Molly had heard about the birth and Harry and Draco being back together, she sent Harry a letter, asking if she should make Draco a sweater too.  But she was nervous because she couldn't imagine rich Draco Malfoy liking such a self-made Christmas present.
Harry stayed in bed perplexed. Not sure what he was supposed to do. Should he leave? It was his bedroom!
"Come on Dray, of course, it is. Don't be mad because I didn't fall for it. Pregnant, I'm not stupid", Harry imagined what Draco would look like if he was pregnant and started laughing, "You'd look ridiculous and get fat. Shit, what would the people say - big bad Draco Malfoy got pregnant by Harry Potter fucking him up the ass - ridiculous!"
Scorpius was born in the sign of Scorpio which everyone had to constantly point out. The Daily Prophet wrote an entire article about it. Draco would hate it if it hadn't at least taken away the attention from Harry and him being a couple for a week.
George had started making bets already that Scorpius would be a hell of a Seeker growing up, "He better gets into Gryffindor, we need a decent seeker again."
"Would you rather tell me that you have no say in naming our child because you weren’t there for the last 6 months? I cried; you know. Because of the hormones, but I did. How are you gonna make up for that?"
Draco was looking at his hand that Harry was holding, he was stroking over the Malfoy ring he was wearing.
The rest of the Weasleys all agreed that Harry knew what he was doing. If he could fall in love with Draco Malfoy, then he couldn't be that bad.
This could have been done very easily with some flicks of their wands, but Harry wanted to pack his things into boxes himself, with his hands. He, who never had a lot of things he could call his own in his life, wanted to acknowledge every piece he would take with him to his own home. He wanted to go through Sirius' and Regulus' things, find hidden secrets and memories of Sirius' life.
Ron sat next to Harry on the couch. He was holding the baby at the moment and looked from him to Harry and Draco. Then he held Scorpius up and looked at him a grin and said in a deep, serious voice:
"Yes, you were. Or why else did you never tell anyone about us? I told Pansy and mother immediately when we started seeing each other regularly. But you? 8 months and not even Weasel and his wife knew - and usually, you tell them everything. It's a miracle you can eat your breakfast without owling them about it afterwards."
"Yeah, uh, he doesn’t really like me but decided to stay though. He likes the house.", he shrugged, "What are you doing here?"
He apparated to Malfoys flat that he shared with Pansy. He didn't have the faintest idea what time it was but just started slamming his fist against the door relentlessly until a very annoyed and angry Pansy opened the door.
"Tss, bullshit, Harry", Ron said, "We wouldn't judge you for your choice in boyfriends, except if it's like, I don’t know, Malfoy or someone like that."
Draco felt like he was trapped in the past. He could feel the cold winds of Scottland on his face, the dust of the broken walls of his school on his skin.
"This is a stupid joke anyway, where did you get it from, I knew it was a mistake to show you the internet."
"I'm not ashamed of you, Draco", Harry kissed the back of his hand, "I was worried what they might say, yes. But not out of shame."
Draco had seriously underestimated just how close Harry was to this family. He was treated exactly like a son (even better sometimes)
Harry never thought he would be able to miss someone so much. He hadn't heard from Draco in 6 months. By now, the letters came back unopened. Pansy sent him away when he came to the apartment, she only said something along the lines of "It's over. But we've all seen that coming, didn't we? I told him it was a stupid idea to get it on with Mr Saviour, but he wouldn't listen to me, typical. “
"Did you criticise his hair?", Ron asked, because it was about the only thing that he could think of that could upset Draco a lot.
He sent an owl with an apology letter to him, but he received no answer either. He wasn't sure what had upset Draco so terribly - okay, he shouldn't have laughed about him, but it really was a stupid joke.
“So, are you having any plans for the rest of the day?”, Hermione asked, “Maybe we could stay together and have the kids play with each other.”
Sirius jumped from the luggage and hugged Scorpius around his waist, “Can I have your room while you’re at school?”
Scorpius was bouncing on his feet next to them, not sure whether he did it out of excitement or nervousness.
"Well... I didn't tell you who it is because I thought you might react... well that you won't like him and won't like me being with him."
Harry nodded, “The other houses are great too and it doesn’t matter for which team you play and on what position.”
Hermione was always kind to him when she visited them at Grimmauld place, Ron recently started to warm up to him. He didn’t have a problem with him and Harry being together and all that, but he "kept an eye on him" for how he treated Hermione.
Then it made click, of course! A few weeks ago, Harry had told Draco about a few popular Muggle holidays that wizards didn't have. In particular, he was joking about how much Fred and George would enjoy April Fool’s Day.
He knew he was having romantic feelings for Draco; he knew he wanted to be in a relationship with him and he knew he was the happiest when he could look forward to coming home to Draco after work.
When Draco finally told his parents that to top it all off he was in love with Harry and in a relationship with him, Lucius had thrown him out of the manor.
“Well, he does. I just can’t believe how grown up he Is already. Our smart little baby is going to Hogwarts. Just yesterday he was the size of a baby owl.”
Draco ended up riding Harry on the couch and then stayed overnight. They had a proper breakfast in the morning and then another round of breath-taking sex.
Harry looked around with a frown. He hadn't renovated the place as he once planned to when he intended to marry Ginny and spend a life with her here. It still looked like a cruel, cold pureblood woman had designed it. But he would have expected Malfoy to like that.
Harry smiled softly, "He's free to go and stay wherever he wants to, I think he doesn't ever want to leave this house, so your music should be fine."
Harry was sitting in a pub with Ron and Hermione. He had rested his head and compared the grey of the metal candlestick in the middle of the table to Draco’s eyes.
Now all that was 8 months ago. Harry and Draco met regularly, most of the time at Harry's place. Harry was going crazy when he didn’t see Draco at least once a week - preferably twice.
"Throwing up isn't as common as in normal pregnancies", Ron said, "Charlie once researched this when he had a gay-phase."
"You're not a bad thing to happen to anyone. Okay, you were an asshole in school. But do you know how glad I am now, to have you in my life? You're the best thing I have. You're the only one who keeps me sane most days."
Draco sighed and leaned his head back, "Yes, I do", he whispered and looked at him again, "But I'm still angry with you. I had to ask my mother for help of all people."
"You knocked up Malfoy?", Ron muttered and looked around nervously, checking if someone was listening.
Ron pulled a face, "No thanks. Harry can have all the baby fun for now. But mate, maybe we can babysit. Mom is gonna be so happy when he hears about this."
Harry didn't really know what Malfoy was doing. After the war, he had helped to rebuild Hogwarts. He had apologised a lot, wrote essays about how purebloods were raised to think of themselves as higher and better than anyone and anything else - which he fully condemned now. In contrast to Harry, Malfoy had gone back to Hogwarts to complete his studies. The last thing he had heard was that his mother went to France and he went to apprentice with some potions master somewhere in central Europe.
But since Draco was gone and refused to talk to him, Harry realised just how much he got used to having him around. How much he loved sleeping next to him and waking up to him. He missed noticing how the furniture was different each week. He missed Draco criticising his tea and hair and Muggle Clothes. He missed his smell, he missed his concentrated face when he was reading something, he missed how he rolled his eyes in a very pureblood way when Harry showed him a new "funny muggle invention" (Draco’s first interaction with a toaster was about the funniest thing he had ever seen)
Draco startled, then smoothed out his expression as he accepted his drink from the same house-elf. “Potter? A shopkeeper? I’d love to see that.”
“Harry, have you seen the sign that’s gone up this morning at the bottom of Diagon?” She but her lip in worry.
Not finished yet but thought I’d post what I’d written previously. Get back to writing this one too since I’ve been getting back into it during my time off.
“Quiet? Sure I can see that.” Draco jibed sarcastically, placing a teasing smirk upon his face as he observed the melee of the shop. It was clear that business was booming, a hum of customers made their way steadily through the merchandise, aided by the helpful (and mostly Gryffindor) staff members.
Shocked, Harry replied. “What do you mean? The war has been over years and it’s hardly like Malfoy and I are school rivals anymore.”
“Oh, it’s a guy. Yes I’d forgotten about your whole coming out party a few years ago..” He smirked knowingly.
Just yesterday, there had been the return of the lobster people for the fifth time! Their intent of world domination had inevitably been thwart by the miraculous appearance of Tom Cruise and the church of Scientology that apparently had a beef with the crustacean army.. or something. In all honesty it didn’t make sense. At all. And Kyle struggled to keep on top of it, and was long past done.
“I have no idea why you’re here, so no. I don’t think so.” Harry snapped beginning to turn so he could close the door in the smug face. Sadly, he heard the blonde’s protests before he could shut it fully.
“Oh lighten up Draco, people were bound to find out you owned the stores eventually, Rita would have scooped it at some point.” Astoria tried to placate her boyfriend.
“Did you say Quidditch Direct uncle Harry? Cousin Draco..” Teddy began, eager to join in the adult conversation.
“I’m kind of intrigued. How are you planning on making yourself irresistible?” Blaise laughed as he straightened up the few stray strands from his hair.
It was only a few short weeks after Christmas had been and gone that Harry had reluctantly made the decision to close the store for good. The notice sign was put up, to the dismay of his loyal customers and a final farewell sale was scheduled to clear the rest of his stock. Upon hearing the news, Lucius had smugly summoned his son to celebrate. Draco’s heart hadn’t been in it though. He now knew how much the store meant to Potter and he felt it impossible to gloat in triumph at the other’s misfortune.
“No polyjuice?” Blaise asked in greeting after watching his friend with an arched brow stroll elegantly towards him. Draco was clearly, though not visibly to the untrained observer, nervous about the meeting. He’d obviously spent ages on his outfit, before settling on the dove grey pants with a white shirt that suited him perfectly. It was smart enough without trying too hard.
The boys nodded to each other and set off in search of a friend to tell them, or at least a reliable source.
“You guess you love Astoria? That’s red hot passion, if I’ve ever heard it my friend.” Blaise chuckled to himself, “So if there’s no imminent wedding bells, what’s got you in such a good mood?”
Harry felt a strange urge to comfort his former nemesis and offered up his hand to be shook. “We’re friends now though.”
“It’s a trap, obviously.” Blaise responded with confidence. “Any Slytherin worth their salt could see that.”
Draco sighed, “Yes Astoria, you were saying that Daphne and stolen your idea for the charity brunch and passed it off as her own.” He aimed to look more engaged as his animated partner conversed with him avidly.
“Yes, you wouldn’t want her telling too many tales of Wrackspurt infestation.” Draco drawled before clasping the hands of the sticky fingered boy. “Come on Teddy, let’s get back home, we’ve disrupted Potter here for far too long.”
Kingsley sighed. “Look. I don’t really want to send you myself. But MACUSA requested we send Harry Potter. He’s kind of got a reputation of getting things done. Even of there.”
“Plus I’ve got a clean bill of health.” Kenny produced medical paperwork from his parka pocket, proclaiming all his negative test results from sexually transmitted diseases.
Draco rolled his eyes. “How Hufflepuff of you. Are you saying you would still date him if he had warts on his face?”
“Gin, you know that place is like my home. I couldn’t imagine working anywhere else.” Frustration coloured his words as he tried to explain the deeper connection the role held for him.
When they finally pulled up, on the other side of the city, Draco jumped from the car like he’d seen a swarm of inferi.
“Hmph so you say. I bet Granger confounded the examiner so you got your licence.” It was easy to see that the unimpressed scepticism written on Draco’s face, he had his arms crossed and everything.
Kenny sighed. He wanted to help Butters, but he didn’t want to make it worse for him. He knew how shitty South Park’s social services were from first hand experience. He supposed they only had a year and a bit left and then they could both move away. He would take any job he could find if it meant he could earn enough money to look after both him and Leo.
“That’s true.” Draco nodded before lapsing into a thoughtful silence. Deliberating, he decided to confide the worries of his mind that had been bugging him.
“You ready to meet Mr Wonderful?” Draco smirked when Harry opened the door. He’d asked for him to come around the morning of the date so that he wouldn’t have to stew with his nerves alone.
“-It’s fine Potter. I wouldn’t deserve you anyway. Let’s talk about less maudlin things.” Draco flashed a brief smile to reassure Harry.
Ding. The doorbell to the café chirped again. Harry’s eyes shot upwards, only to be drag down by the lead feeling in his stomach. It was just two girls coming for their caffeine fix; no mystery man with a blue handkerchief in sight.
“I’m not.” Blaise smirked before continuing knowledgeable. “People may not like the Malfoy name but they like the prices. Potter’s stuff might be much better quality but it’s not cheap.”
“What?!” Outraged, Draco stormed past the man and glared into the window. Potter? Of all the low, underhanded schemes, the saviour had tried to humiliate him with this? Pretending to be an interesting funny guy? Loathsome! Well Draco would no longer be his fool.
Another twenty minutes had passed and Harry couldn’t help regretting his decision to not use polyjuice. Perhaps SN7 had come and seen him, and simply had walked away when he’d seen ‘the boy who lived’? Not a lot of people would want to handle that pressure, Harry surmised. But he had wanted to start this off honestly, he couldn’t imagine the uproar that would have surely occurred if he’d revealed it later on. No he didn’t need that.
“Boys? If I could just interrupt your squabbling.” Kingsley tried not to look amused as he watched their back and forth. “To answer, Malfoy’s question. There have been a lot of strange reports and sightings by the muggles of that area.”
“For the millionth time Malfoy. You know that we can’t do that. 1) We’ve never been to South Park so we’d probably splinch and you know MACUSA doesn’t pay for medical expenses. 2) They’ve had to put an anti-apparition ward around the entire vicinity until they know exactly what’s going on. 3) You know they don’t have floo travel here. 4) We need to be seen travelling to not appear suspicious. 5) Get in the goddamn car!”
The sarcastic tone amused Harry more than it should and he felt thankful once more that he met the mysterious man in the Wizards with Web chatroom that he’d happened upon a few days after purchasing the W-book for himself. The Wizarding World was small and so to keep it fun and light-hearted they agreed to keep it anonymous for now, Harry for obvious reasons was not eager to reveal his identity for a while. Too many tedious prophet related scandals had deterred him from opening up more to strangers.
Harry was startled. He’d not seen the blonde properly in years, and now here he was accompanying his beloved godson. The lithe figure of grace sauntered its way over towards him and Harry had to swallow the dryness of his throat.
The palaver with Potter and the press had caused Draco’s headache to re-emerge. It was now thrumming with vengeance as he and Blaise made their way to his father’s study. The overstuffed office only caused his head to hurt more; too many swirly patterns and bejewelled ornaments were perhaps the cause.
Around one hundred metres from where Harry gnawed on his lip concerned with his unfortunately news, Draco Malfoy apparated into the recently renovated super store with a sharp click of his heels. He briefly shook hands with his friend and long term business associate Blaise Zabini, and they meandered around their new and vast warehouse style store.
“Shut up Blaise.” Draco smiled before a frown settled over his features. “I really hope we click in person too.”
“I just can’t believe that the two men I had fallen for had both been you.” Harry remarked a short while later, ice cream sticky in their hands.
Still not sure whether to write this... but I do have some ideas plot wise? So I’ll write it but it may be slow going as this is a fusion that is quite tricky for me.
His father strolled from his spot at the fireplace and elegantly took a seat on the sofa. It was clear he enjoyed the suspense by the small smirk that graced his lips. “No. The Greengrass family whilst wealthy are not part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.” He took a large sip of his drink before continuing. “I’d recommend finding a suitable bride soon though Draco. Your mother wants a grandchild and I need a heir.”
Still, Harry had not survived a war and defeated the darkest wizard of all time by being a quitter. With his plucky attitude restored, Harry set out on his daily excursion to his beloved shop, a determined spring to his step. He was anxious to get in and ensure his stock were in order, this Saturday was usually the busiest of the year. Parents of students at Hogwarts were sure to have received notice of their child making the school team and so would be eager to reward their offspring with the latest models. Harry loved this, reminiscing over the joy he’d felt when he’d received his own Nimbus2000, he couldn’t help the warm feeling he got by being a part of that.
“Shut it Malfoy. I drove just fine. We’re here after all.” Harry gestured to the embossed MACUSA sign that adorned the non-descript building in front of them.
“Hmmm yeah, probably be back around 7, if you want to cook for then?” She answered absently as she stood up.
True to his word, Draco had begun the process of making amends with Potter and hopefully gaining his affection, when a few days later he sent a letter with a small parcel attached to a more than imperious owl.
“I brought you these.” Malfoy thrust an exorbitant bouquet of white lilies into Harry’s hands in greeting as soon as the door opened.
“Don’t be silly dear, it’s been years, I’m sure everyone is over that.” She said glibly. “Now, what shall I wear? I need to make a good impression.”
“Because, I don’t love you. I’m not sure I ever will.” Draco felt a huge weight had been lifted from his soul as he admitted this.
The atmosphere felt charged as Draco’s silver met the emerald green of Harry’s eyes. It seemed to Harry that Draco yearned to say something else, but then thought better of it.
Humming to himself, he got to work with arranging his newest stock. Though he’d never been artistic, he couldn’t help but be proud of his displays, he’d tried to bring magic to the presentation of his goods. In the middle of the store was a golden chandelier of snitches fluttering in an orbital motion; a shelf to the left advertised the latest quidditch leathers upon wax models of upcoming sport-stars. It was chaotic, beautiful and full of life.
Teddy, whilst adorable, was often far too excitable. His hair would flit rapidly through the colours of the rainbow, eager to hold the attention of the older blonde. He beamed emphatically when it was decided that Draco would take Teddy to Diagon Alley for light shopping and some ice cream. It was, unbeknownst to the youngster, a ploy to get him out of the house so that the women could have their tête-à-tête undisturbed.
When he’d spoken to Ginny in the hope of alleviating his anxiety, she’d been too busy to offer much support but had assured him that the store would be fine, after all it was as popular as ever. This didn’t assuage all his concerns however and he’d taken to the WWWW to find out information on the company. Though he’d spent a good few hours on his W-book, the only thing he could see was that the owners were the elusive GoodFaith Corporation, the names of individual employees could not be found no matter how hard he tried.
“Lame.” Cartman huffed as he finally took a seat, squishing Kenny into the window. A cheerful hello from a fellow passenger made both boys turn around.
Draco stood nervously on the step. He’d explained to his aunt, who’d given him Potter’s address, that he wished to make amends. Her eyes had seemed to sparkle as she’d wished him luck and Draco had taken the address slip and fled before he could change his mind.
He watched with guarded amusement as Potter pathetically attempted to conceal himself. It had been an arduous decision to return, he’d riled against himself every step of the way, but at the same time he just couldn’t help himself. He was curious. How could Potter be the perpetually engaging Quidditchboy? The blasted boy-who-lived was barely coherent, not like his charming PenPal. So he’d returned, sans blue handkerchief of course, against his better judgement.
In a Wizarding house a fair distance away from Diagon Alley, Draco mustered as much enthusiasm as he possibly could for the imminent outing. It was not that he didn’t care about his cousin Teddy, he did, it was more that he didn’t know how to interact with children.
“Potter? Who cares about him? Potter is nothing to me.” Draco rolled his eyes, too happy with his success to care too much about irksome matters.
The tea Draco was offered when Potter returned from his open kitchen was perfect and he sipped gratefully in the silence that threatened to turn awkward.
Using his wand as a stylus, Harry scrolled over to his Inbox, the Owl symbol had a little number one next to it. Clicking on it embarrassingly fast, Harry was more than relieved to see that it was from SN7 at Owl-Mail and not a junk message. Heart beating suspiciously fast, Harry found himself grinning from the very offset of his PenPal’s missive.
“What are you doing here?” Potter answered, without overt hostility, but not what most would consider polite.
“Well, if you don’t care about Potter, I can tell you right now that you won’t care for this guy.” At Draco’s look, he continued. “Because this guy is Potter.”
Satisfied with his wrinkled nose and an eyebrow arch, she continued her monologue. “I know, I’m all for muggle stuff when it’s avant-garde but there’s nothing tackier than alcohol served in something other than Elvin-made glass. I said to Daphne that if they were scared of damage, then they could always charm the glass unbreakable. Honestly, it’s like they forget we have magic!”
He trailed off, feeling like an absolute idiot. Malfoy had played him, coming in to his store, being all friendly and charming, trying to sabotage him! Harry fumed. Anger that had not dwelt within him since school rose up valiantly and he marched towards where the git stood surveying the party.
“Wow Potter, he sounds perfect but what’s if he’s, you know, ugly?” Draco jibed with a wink that made Harry flush.
“So, you been seeing anyone since the Weaselette?” Draco asked with faux casualness on one of the occasions, causing Harry to cough in surprise.
It was only sensible after all, who knew what this messenger would be like? He could be a crazed neo-deatheater embarking on a serial killing rampage, Draco as his first victim. No, it was best to have back up. Though the blonde would never admit that the real reason he’d pressured his friend to escort him was that he was too chicken to meet the man he had grown to desire.
Harry’s heart was hammering so fast he could barely breathe as he read his latest correspondence. It was time. He replied swiftly with glee, only to be startled by an imperious knock at his door. One that he’d become all too accustomed to. He fought the frisson of excitement that ran through him as he grinned at his expected visitor.
In the passing weeks, Christmas loomed imminently and the whole non meet-up had been brushed aside. His work colleagues had been curious how his ‘date’ had gone, outraged on his behalf that he’d been stood up by the cad. Harry had rushed to reassure them, stating that his long distance friend must have had his reasons and that he’d made peace with the fact that his relationship would only be virtual.
“Thanks.” Kyle drily intoned before adding. “You know what isn’t awesome? The fact that you have to find a parking spot and I’ve got a chemistry lab in like twenty minutes.”
Harry had puzzled over his reply for a good hour and half before eventually accepting the invitation out of curiosity. Whilst undeniably true that he didn’t have a clue where to start when making the tea, Harry also didn’t fully trust Malfoy with this overture and would feel infinitely more comfortable if he knew that the tea wasn’t laced with poison or something.
“I’m pretty sure they wear chequered shirts and jeans in North America.” Harry added with unconcealed smugness. He couldn’t wait to see Draco’s face when he took him to a Walmart.
“I don’t know Draco, it could be a set up. Where she’s secretly wanting us to not go and if I accept she’ll use it against me. You know what Slytherin girls are like.” Blaise sighed dramatically. “Speaking of; how did the break up go between you and Astoria?”
? Merlin, what kind of name is that?” Draco just had to add incredulously. It was pretty much a direction and a destination.
“What do you douches want?” Came Craig’s surly voice when they ambled up to him in the corridor. They had noticed that despite all the cars parked outside the school, the hallways were bereft of people. Other than the perpetually pissed off Craig who was carrying a travel cup filled with coffee, presumably for his boyfriend Tweek.
“Hi! We are Aurors Potter and Malfoy from the British Division.” Harry nervously introduced them both as the man in front of them stared impassively.
Understanding what Malfoy was indicating, Harry ruffled his own hair with a self-deprecating smile. “Oh yeah it’s one of our busiest days today and we have a lot of loyal customers. Still, there’s that Quidditch Direct store coming soon that might give us some competition.”
Harry eagerly tapped his reply, happy to have no interruptions for once as he spoke inanely about his day to day life with the man who already felt like a friend.
“It’s so unlike you. Still I’m glad all this Potter nonsense is over. We can focus more on other things; like me. And you. Your mother says we can use your villa in Tuscany for the honeymoon..”
Kenny tried to surpress the icy anger that burned from within at all his friend had told him, and what he knew must have been omitted from the account. It wasn’t fair. He knew realistically that Butters wasn’t an angel, but he was pretty damn close. And Kenny would stop at nothing to protect him.
Draco masked any hurt he felt at the throwback to their meeting on the train and simply sniffed disdainful. “It’s just not very original is all I’m saying.”
If that wasn’t bad enough, Astoria seemed to have become fixated on the idea of their impending engagement. It appeared that a number of women on her committee had recently gotten married or at least engaged, and she wanted in on the action. Their shared home was now littered with bridal magazines stacked on their coffee table, a completely unsubtle approach for a Slytherin, Draco shook his head in disapproval. It wasn’t that he was against marriage, or even his relationship with Astoria; he just wasn’t sure if he wanted them combined.
He ruminated on her words a little longer before nodding. “I suppose you’re right. He’s only done this as he’s scared for his shop. If only this doesn’t hurt sales, otherwise father will be on his way to Azkaban for doing what the dark lord couldn’t -killing the chosen git.”
In the days leading up to Christmas, Draco had had enough of the hints from both his mother and Astoria about a proposal. Visiting his mother for his weekly standing invitation for afternoon tea had always been a pleasant enough affair, now all his mother seemed to say and ask was; when are you and Astoria going to get married? Why don’t I have any grandchildren? Do you want me to get your grandmother’s engagement ring out of the vaults?
“Oh not the newer ones, they fixed the formula after WitchWeekly ran an OpEd on the products.” Astoria replied knowledgeably; “I’m Astoria Greengrass by the way. And of course you’re Ginevra Weasley and Harry Potter.”
A dark shadow fell across his table. Harry’s eyes were drawn upwards, reluctantly, till they met the startling silver grey of his once arch nemesis. The blonde git smirked before raising an eyebrow in greeting.
“I can’t do it Harry. It refuses every known law of physics: muggle and magical.” She scowled at his offending scalp before shrugging and resuming the styling on her own hair. Harry surveyed himself in the mirror, he didn’t think he looked half bad really; he’d given up a long time ago on his hair, much to Ginny’s dismay. The forest green plaid shirt with his latest grey jeans suited him perfectly, Harry thought his appearance could be worse.
Harry closed his eyes and rubbed tiredly at his forehead. So, he had to fight dirty? He could do that. Especially if it meant saving his store. Besides, he already had his first idea.
“You’re right.” Astoria’s face lit up temporarily before falling as he continued. “But I think there’s someone that I could fall for.”
“Gentlemen, we’ve been expecting you. I’m the lead on the case. Detective Parker.” He nodded, extending his hand in a respectful handshake to both aurors as he led them to the double doors of the entrance. He stopped, scrutinising them.“Before we go in though, I’ll need to see some identification.”
“Dude. There’s no need to be an ass. We were just wondering what was going on.” Stan tried to appease his lookalike and long time rival.
Draco took an admittedly large swig from his glass of wine before answering. “Of course I’m not ashamed of you. I just don’t want to spend an evening being scowled at by distant family members from the ‘light side’ of the war.”
“That would be lovely, thank you.” Draco smiled disarmingly remembering his best manners. “I’m sorry to hear that. Astoria and I broke up recently too.”
Harry sat snugly in his cotton striped pyjamas under the weight of a particularly fluffy duvet, content in the knowledge that he had no work to go to today. Not that he didn’t love his job, he did in fact, but facing the crisp autumn air was not as appealing as his warm cocoon and the chance to use the WWWW, World-Wide-Wizarding-Web, undisturbed.
with a protective caress. Kyle didn’t know whether Stan’s tendency to call his vehicles names was adorable or infuriating. It was a little of both.
Astoria continued to waffle on about outfits and colour coordination; Draco no longer had the strength to argue with her, not when he’d inevitably give in. Astoria was a force to be reckoned with and she somehow always got her own way. The Hat had placed her well in Slytherin he mused.
“That’s good, isn’t it Draco? I mean you like this guy. Though what will you say to Astoria?” Blaise spoke reasonably.
“Oh so I’m Potter now?” Harry joked, amused despite the cacophony of noise that reigned in their room.
“Oh… um. Yeah. I’ll bring it.” Harry fled to the other side of the open kitchen where he could compose himself amongst the cupboards. He brought the collection he’d been gifted and placed it beside the blonde.
“Erm… will our wands be okay?” Harry ventured in confusion. Kingsley hadn’t briefed that in the protocols, but it made sense with how easily polyjuice could be used. The problem was, while Harry had his driving licence, Draco probably didn’t even have a birth certificate to his name.
“Of course you will, you’ve the Malfoy charm to use too. Now how are you going to know which ones him?” Blaise looked pointedly at the café door, their arrival at their destination apparent.
“I wouldn’t worry guys, we are known for our quality supplies not that cheap knockoff stuff, and there’s enough business for both of us I’m sure.” The staff did not look completely convinced and with good reason, Quidditch Direct had driven other independent stores across the UK to ruin with their chain store discounts that couldn’t be competed with.
“Oh that. It’s going swimmingly. All I need to do is make Potter find me irresistible as both identities. That way I’ll win whichever one he picks.”
“Draco? Of course it’s you.” Harry whispered in disbelief as he took in the man that stood up and offered him a blueberry muffin ice cream.
Though his professional life had been nothing but a success, his personal was starting to give him a headache. Astoria had found his invitation to his Aunt Andromeda’s annual Harvest lunch, which he’d been planning on ignoring, and insisted that they both attend. She felt that it would be the perfect way to cement their relationship with the introduction to the extended family. Draco disagreed and the argument was still ongoing.
“The plan to woo Potter, so that he doesn’t care that you’ve hidden your identity for so long.” Blaise sipped his drink before getting up to check himself out in the large monochrome mirror above Draco’s fireplace.
Harry had eagerly clicked on the message from his PenPal, expecting all sorts of excuses and reasons why he’d not shown. Instead, the man had surprised him an uncharacteristic openness filled with raw honesty. Though still hurt, Harry had decided to accept the apology, even if he was wary of suggesting or arranging a meeting anytime soon. Perhaps they would forever only communicate online.
“I don’t really know, Headmistress McGonagall only told us that all the eighth years’ returning had to seat here and that we had to stay after the feast because she wanted to talk to us. I suppose that she will explain it all then. Now seat, the sorting is about to start, you arrived right on time.”
I won't lie and say that I'll try to have the next chapter for next week, because knowing myself it won't be done. However I will promise to have the next one as soon as I can, and I will try for it to not be another half a year. The possitive part is that in two months I will be done with Uni, so if I haven't been able to post a chapter before that, I'll absolutely will as soon as Uni is done, so I suppose that you'll only have to wait two months tops.
It had been a peaceful afternoon at the Weasley household, he had been able to see his whole family again, including Charlie, and also Andy and Teddy, whom he had missed dearly. They had given Harry his present for his birthday and, afterwards, they had had a quiet dinner with a mouth-watering cake by the end. It was now almost time to leave and Harry was by no means ready to tell them about his and Hermione’s decision to testify in Malfoy’s behalf. He and Hermione had decided to tell them about it at the end of the day, because they wanted to have a peaceful celebration without making it more difficult than it would already be. After all, it was the first real celebration after the war. But now it was time, and he was so not prepared. He looked at Hermione begging with his eyes for her to start, and when he saw an imperceptible nod he almost sighed in relief.
had been. She was so scared, scared for her brother, scared of losing him. As she kept running, she was going through different scenarios as to why Harry would be up there, each one being worse than the last. She could not get out of her mind the fact that the last time that Harry had been there, she had almost lost him. She kept running faster and faster, taking every shortcut she could think about, trying to get to the Astronomy Tower as fast as possible, because she could not take the loss of another person, and much less the loss of her brother. She could only think about the fact that Harry was alone up there, while the image of him in the Infirmary Wing, as well that morning with all the blood pooling at his feet kept repeating, not having realised that there was another name up there, a name that could be either a blessing or a curse. The name of Harry's "ex"-nemesis.
“Thank you, Minister” – he said – “I too, would like to start taking on behalf of Mrs Malfoy. I would like to make emphasis on Hermione’s statement about Mrs Malfoy acting on behalf of her family, only to protect her. Just like Hermione, I know what it's like to act out of love and for the protection of our loved ones. We all know that we would do anything to save those that we love, nothing is too much and safe is never safe enough. However, I believe that Hermione has explained it all perfectly, so I won’t delve in that. Nevertheless, I would like to make a statement regarding Mrs Malfoy, that not many know of. Mrs Malfoy saved my life, and I do not say that lightly. She might have done it for her son but, nonetheless, she saved my life. As those who were in the battle of Hogwarts, and many more may know, while Voldemort gave us time to gather our dead ones and our injured, I went into the Forbidden Forest to meet with him. When Severus Snape died, he gave me his last memories for me to view. In them I saw Albus Dumbledore telling Severus Snape that, for reasons which I cannot say due to confidentiality, I had to die before Voldemort did, or else he could not be killed and all that time while in the run completing Dumbledore’s mission would have been for nothing. Therefore, I went into the forest. Not to negotiate a truce with Voldemort, but to die. Once I arrived where He was located, He did not wait a moment before he had cast the Killing Curse to me. For unknown reasons, though, I survived once again. I was lying still hoping that they thought me dead when I heard Voldemort telling someone to check if I was dead, he did not want to commit his mistake once again, after all. Obviously, I thought that it was my end, whoever it was would tell Voldemort that I was alive, and He would kill me with some other curse making sure that I didn’t survive this time. However, it was Mrs Malfoy who approached me, she saw that I was alive, and instead of telling so to Voldemort, she asked me whether Draco was alive or not. At that point I had two options, I could either ignore her because maybe it was just a trick to see if I truly was alive, or answer her. I chose the second one, and in a murmur, I told her that his son was alive and in the castle. Then, the impossible happened, Mrs Malfoy stood up and told Voldemort that I was dead. No one else came to verify, no one doubted her word. The reason why I had gone to the forest was fulfilled, and therefore I could finally kill Voldemort. Mrs Malfoy saved my life, and assuredly the life of many others, and for that reason, I ask for you to spare her, if not a full pardon, at least house arrest, but she does not deserve Azkaban, not after saving all of us in an act of love. Continuing onto Draco Malfoy, once more Hermione has explained how he saved our lives back in Malfoy Manor, I will not delve onto that, as all that was said before is true. However, I would like to talk about our sixth year. His father had just been imprisoned in Azkaban due to the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Voldemort decided as punishment for his father’s failures to make him, a sixteen-year-old boy and therefore a minor, a Death Eater. He gave him am impossible mission. A mission that not even Voldemort dared to do and threatened to kill her mother and him if he failed. As you now that mission was no other than to kill the great Albus Dumbledore. Voldemort’s hopes were that Draco would fail his mission and that he would be able to punish further the Malfoy Family. Yes, it is true, Draco almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley, but it was just in an attempt to safe his family. I saw the misery he lived in through all our sixth year, I would not wish it to anyone. Furthermore, even though it may surprise you, Dumbledore knew of Draco’s plans, he knew all along. Before starting the school year, while in a mission Dumbledore run into a curse by Lord Voldemort, he ended with a blackened hand, which was slowly killing him. He did not die instantly because Severus Snape managed to slow the spreading, giving him a few more months of life. Mrs Malfoy asked Severus Snape, a long-time family friend, to help his son in his mission to end Dumbledore’s life and made him take an unbreakable vow to do anything in his power to assure Draco’s success, after all, Mrs Malfoy did not want to lose his son. Severus Snape gave all this information to his mentor, one Albus Dumbledore, who told him to help Draco and to, in the final moments of his life, to kill him himself; as we all know, Severus did. The day Dumbledore died, we had just returned from a mission who left him very weak, barely alive. When we arrived at the Astronomy Tower Dumbledore told me to go fetch Severus Snape, but while I was leaving, Draco arrived, and Dumbledore froze me under my father’s invisibility cloak unable to move. I saw everything that happened that night up in the tower. Draco disarmed Dumbledore but was not able to do anything more.  He was trembling out of fear, and he told Dumbledore that he had to kill him, or Voldemort would kill his family. But he was not able to. Dumbledore offered him a way out, a way to save himself and his family, and Draco was about to accept when the Death Eaters burst in. We all know what happened next, Dumbledore died at the hands of Severus Snape. What I’m trying to say with this though, is that Draco Malfoy is not a criminal, he did not want to commit any of the crimes you accused him fore, he was just trying to fulfil the role given to him, just like I did. We were just children, children forced to take part in an adult war, we are not at fault about what we did, none of us are. No sixteen-year-old should be forced to do what we have been through. No sixteen-year-old should be forced to make the decision to kill or be killed. Thank you very much for your attention esteemed Members of the Wizengamot, I hope my statement helps you make a fair decision for everyone.”
They quietly prepared themselves for bed, and after talking a little bit about their aspirations for the coming year, they went to sleep. After all, tomorrow school started anew, and they could not afford to be asleep.
He was about to respond that he did not want to live, that he was tired of it when suddenly Madam Pomfrey was back.
Harry saw in the faces of his schoolmates, that even though they did not know what they were talking about, that it was a sore topic for them, so they did not pry on. After all, they all had their secrets and their past traumas. Seamus was the one to open the door, and what they saw inside was not what any of them expected. – “Wow, just wow, I was certainly not expecting that” – a girl, Lisa Turpin, or something like that Harry thought, said. It was indeed a magnificent room.
“See, we told you it was here. It must have a glamour in it for those who are not allowed entrance.”
Apart from this slight misstep, the rest of the dinner went smoothly without any other incident. It was true, there were people missing, but what a better way of honouring them than living? So that was what they would do. After dinner, they went into the living room for a little bit more of light talking, and after a long time, they decided that it was time to go back home, but not before promising to come back the day of Harry’s birthday, which was in two days’ time, in which Molly intended to at least give Harry his presents even if he did not feel up to a full celebration, which he did not. Harry and Hermione walked those hundred meters towards the apparition point in silence, but both feeling lighter than they had felt when they had arrived at the Burrow mere hours before.
“Not really, I mean yes, I want to apologise, but not for the reason you are thinking. I mean it wasn’t even a fight is just that we realised something and everything escalated from there, and then he was storming out of the room, but I did not realize it ‘cause I was kind of in shock, and now I don’t know where he is, and I’m really scared, because I’m afraid that something will happen, and I don’t want to lose him, I can’t, he’s family, and I can’t lose any more family…” Hermione began getting more stress as she rambled, breathing harder and harder.
“Hey, I’m a Slytherin not stupid! Besides, it was not the first panic attack that I have seen… after all, I was here last year, and it wasn’t an easy one”
After a few minutes of just staring, finally, someone mentioned the tabloid which McGonagall had mentioned, and they decided to start making the pairs for the dorms. For Harry, it was pretty easy to decide with whom he was going. After all, he had been living with Hermione for more than a year, he was not going to stop doing so now. In the end, it seemed that everyone knew fairly quickly whom they wanted to go with, and under ten minutes, they had all the dorms organized.
“Harry, come on! Hurry up or we’ll be late!” – He heard Hermione yelling downstairs. He had been ready for more than an hour, but he was not mentally prepared. However, he did not want to face an angry Hermione again, so he adjusted his dress shirt once again, got out of their room and started descending the stairs.
“Right, yes, I can imagine that it had to be tough being here with the Carrow’s… Anyways, I should keep looking for Harry… Maybe we won’t be a total slack and will go to class, or so I hope…”
They all decided to retire for the day, as it was quite late. They went up the stair to where they supposed the dorms were located and were met with a long corridor, with four doors on either side. They were surprised to see that every door already had a plate with the names of the pairs. It resulted that the paper they had filled was charmed, and the dorms had already been sorted. Harry and Hermione entered their dorm, and they saw that it was almost as big as their room back home. It had two poster beds, with a big table for them to study, and at the far end, there were two different doors. It resulted that they did not only have an en-suite bathroom, which they had never had before in the old rooms but also, they had a walk-in dresser to put all their belongings. To say that Harry was surprised was putting it mildly.
Professor McGonagall talked about how Draco Malfoy had always been an exemplary student, the top of his house, and one of the best of his year. She made emphasis in stating that Draco had just been a child, just like Harry had said, and she also said that during Draco’s last year, he had participated as little as he could in the tortures implemented by the Carrow Brothers. Instead, he tried to help the students every time he could. Finally, which highly surprised Harry, as well as Hermione for what he could see, was that Professor McGonagall said that she had decided to implement an eight-year for all those who had not been able to do properly their last year due to the war, in order for them to finish their studies and do their news, and she told in front of the whole Wizengamot, that she was willing to admit Draco Malfoy into Hogwarts, and that she was also willing to make sure that he followed all the rules and did not commit any more crimes, as well as follow everything implemented by the Wizengamot if they decided to give him the conditional.
"E-everyone? W-w-what do you mean e-everyone?"- He managed to choke out through all the pain he felt.
I am so, so, so sorry. OMG, it has almost been a month since I last posted, and I promised to post within a week...
The school had been going for the last month, and Hermione had never been more concentrated on her workload. True, she had always been a top student, but she had always had a little bit of time for her friends and their “adventures”. Now however, she could not afford the spare time. If she even stopped for a minute, memories started assaulting her, and not of the pleasant type; bodies scattered on the floor, spells ricocheting around her, the last breath of her friends and family, the last laugh of a person, the last scream of terror, memories of battles and loses. When she came here for the begining of the term, she had believed that she would be able to do it, separate Hogwarts from the battlefield that it had been, but it was all too recent, the wounds were still fresh, and even with all the restorations, she could still see all around her the damage done to her beloved school.
He sat down on the floor next to Hermione, and the two of them started going through the different floors of the castle looking for the name
Silently, Hermione walked down the steps of the atrium and walked up to the stand to the designed place for witnesses. After she had seat, an Auror came to the stand to take her oath.
He left the living room, went up the stairs and entered their room. He got ready for bed, and then he tried to sleep. He tossed and turned, but he couldn’t settle his mind. He couldn’t stop thinking about Mrs Malfoy’s letter, and about what Hermione had said. It was true, without Malfoy’s and his mother’s help, they wouldn’t have been able to survive this war. The fights with Malfoy throughout the years had only been a childish rivalry, without really meaning any harm. They were not children anymore, it was not time for childish rivalries to guide his decisions. His testimony could save Malfoy’s life, who, though not innocent, had also helped the Light side win this war, and therefore deserved to, at least, not be sent to prison. With his mindset, he tried to sleep once more. Mere minutes later, he heard Hermione enter their room and wander towards her bed, and decided that now was an as good time as any to tell her his decision and give her, too, some peace of mind.
I know I keep saying this every time, but I'm sorry for taking so long to post this chapter. However, even though I know how I want my story to go, I felt as if I was not in the point in my story to make it go that way, I needed something more, but my muse didn't want to come to me. So, as I didn't want to leave a hole in my story it took me a little bit of time to write it.
“Thank you, Minister Shacklebolt. First of all, I would like to start with Lucius Malfoy. Lucius Malfoy, you have been found guilty of all your crimes and therefore are sentenced to Twenty-Five years in Azkaban, with a possibility of parole after twenty years. Narcissa Malfoy, you have been found guilty of all your crimes, however, due to the testimonies given during this trial, the Wizengamot has decided to sentence you to five years of house arrest with a controlled used of your magic; if any dark spell was to be used you would be sent directly to Azkaban to serve for the rest of your sentence. And to finish with our verdicts, Draco Malfoy, you have been found guilty of all your crimes, but, ought to the testimonies and the proposition of Minerva McGonagall, we sentence you to a year of controlled use of magic, in which you will have to go to Hogwarts under de vigilance of Headmistress McGonagall. If at any point you used any Dark Spell, or cause harm to your classmates, you would be sent directly to Azkaban for the remaining of the year.  After the school year and depending on your behaviour it will be determined whether you will be given further years of house arrest or not. Any behaviour like the ones you have had in your past years will not be permitted. We have been lenient because you were just a child, but we will not give you another chance.”
By the time he finished responding to Neville, Harry saw that all the school had gone silent and that the sorting had stopped. It seemed as if everyone had been listening to him, and he lowered his head in shame. He did not want everyone to start seeing him as more of a role model as he, unfortunately, already was. He just wanted a peaceful year, and the first thing he had managed just as he had arrived at school had been to attract attention. Even though he was ashamed of all the attention bestowed upon him, he hoped that at least it served for something. As the sorting started once again, he looked up into the professors' table and he saw Headmistress McGonagall giving him a curt nod of approval.
He tried to nod his head to Madam Pomfrey, Hogwarts Matron, but he found that the movement was to much a struggle, so he decided to just stay put. Even though he tried, his head could not stop wondering about who could have saved him and, most importantly, why. Why, when all he wanted in the whole world was to die, had someone decided to stop him, why had someone decided to save someone so unworthy, someone who had brought nothing but pain to everyone. He could not get his head around the reason why anyone would want him alive. Suddenly, all became clear as he heard the shriek of his sister, in all but blood, the one who had been with him every step of the way.
“Perfect! Then, if you are not against it, there are some people who would like to see you, as they have been worried since you woke up the last time.”
“I don’t know Hermione, I’ve just caused so much pain to them since they met me that I could not fathom why they would like to keep in contact with me. I know that they care for me” – he said before Hermione could respond – “but sometimes is still hard for me to believe why anyone would care, even you… For Gryffindor, everyone knows that if you had not been friends with me you would not have been through that much!”
“I understand you, Harry, believe me, I do, I feel that way too, but we can only do justice to their sacrifices by carrying on. And being with the Weasleys and letting yourself be a part of their family is not, in any way, replacing your parents. Is a way to honour them. You are honouring them by keeping on with your live, by being able to find happiness despite their absence. They would not want you to be lonely, Harry, they would want you to be with your friends, and to find your own family in which to feel safe and loved.”
“Lucius Malfoy, you are accused of being a Death Eater and of housing He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. You are also accused of acts of torture, attacking innocent muggles, as well as murder. You are also being accused of blackmail of teenagers in Ministry grounds and attacking said teenagers. You are accused of giving a cursed object to a twelve-year-old, almost causing her death. Furthermore, you are being accused of corruption, property theft, and also form forcing your view while managing the board of governors from Hogwarts through blackmail and threats. How do you plead yourself as?”
He was left speechless with what he had heard. How could have Andromeda known everything he had been thinking? And what impressed him the most was that she was not blaming him, quite the contrary, she was giving him a second chance to be a part of Teddy’s life, and he would do nothing less but cherish it with all of his heart. Without any words to say, he decided to do the next best thing, he disentangled himself from Hermione, and went towards Andromeda to hug her, and express all his feelings of gratitude thought the hug.
A few minutes had passed when he, once again, heard the sound of the door opening. He looked up and saw not only Hermione, but also the entirety of the Weasley Family. He was surprised to see so many people who cared for him, but once again, Hermione had already told him so, so why was it so hard to believe that he was cared for?
They sat at their table and immediately heard the doors of the Great Hall opening. In they came a line of nervous first years guided by Deputy Headmaster Flitwick. When they arrived at the front Professor Flitwick started calling them all for them to be sorted. The first to be sorted went into Gryffindor, and Harry applauded with all he had for the little boy. When the next boy was sorted into Slytherin, Harry applauded with as much might. Everyone in the Great Hall started staring at him, and when Neville asked him why he was applauding a Slytherin, he responded confidently.
“You are all crazy! How can you want to help Malfoy after everything he has done! Ginny almost got killed because of him, for Merlin’s sake! I cannot just let that pass, and I don’t know how you can! They deserve Azkaban for everything they have done and more!”
“Oh, Merlin! Why hadn’t I thought about that before! I’m so stupid, it’s the first thing I should’ve done, I can’t believe I forgot about it”. – she stood while she kept on rambling, and headed straight into their dorm room, Blaise following hot on her heels, not understanding why she was going towards her dorm room.
"HARRY!! Oh, Harry, you are finally awake, I was so worried! Don't you ever try to do something like that again. You cannot imagine the heart attack that you gave me and Ron when we saw you falling off the Astronomy Tower. I don't know how we managed to stop you, but thankfully we did. Harry, don't you pull a stunt like that ever again! Everyone has been so worried!"
I will try to write as many chapters as possible during these days in order to compensate for all the lost ones.
“You’d throw away our fortunate match for tripe fed to non pure blood children? Be sensible, you’ve never even been in love.”
“Draco, Draco? Are you listening to me?” The attractive brunette attempted to regain the blonde’s attention impatiently by clicking her fingers in his direction.
When they had gone, Draco fixed his steely gaze back in Harry’s direction before idly commenting; “So, where is this friend? Are they imaginary?”
Surveying his store with pride, he couldn’t help but be pleased at the enormous change it had gone through in the aftermath of the war and in his hands. Initially, Harry had begun Auror training after the final battle had concluded, but his heart was no longer in it. Still plodding along through his training, he’d taken a stroll through Diagon during one of his lunch breaks. His eyes had been drawn to the still boarded up windows and the sign on the door that had announced it was for sale due to the owner moving abroad. Money and paperwork had exchanged hands shortly thereafter (much to Hermione’s disapproval at his reckless spontaneity) and Harry had quickly built it up to the success that stood before him today.
“I know a lot of things Potter. I’m surprisingly multi-talented.” He joked with a heart stopping grin. “So you talk to a person online. What’s complicated about that?”
Thinking about seeing his PenPal in person left Harry with an unsettling case of butterflies in his abdomen. He hadn’t replied to the man yet, too scared to accept but also not wanting to decline. For now, Harry put it out of his mind. He was glad Hermione didn’t know about it, too busy with the brutal combination of motherhood and ministry work to pay him too much mind, otherwise she’d never had let him hear the end of it. Hermione had made her feelings of procrastination quite clear when he’d avoided the golden egg challenge in fourth year, and he was in no mood for more scolding.
Both boys nodded in confirmation. South Park must be an interesting place if they were needed with this much urgency. Throughout the run down of details, Draco still gave him a look that suggested that this was all Harry’s fault. Somehow, Harry couldn’t help but think that maybe it was.
“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Draco winked, nearly causing an aneurysm in Harry’s brain. He cleared his throat nonchalantly as though he’d not noticed the other’s reaction. “So, are you going to bring the tea Potter? Or do I have to do all the work?”
“You’re so sweet Ken.” Butters smiled, genuinely happy for the first time that day. He had been feeling out of sorts till his friend arrived. He didn’t deserve someone as lovely as Kenny looking out for him, but he wasn’t about to complain.
Draco stared blankly at his W-book. When he’d first seen Potter’s message, he’d almost deleted it out of spite. He’d returned home the evening before in a mood so foul, even Astoria hadn’t attempted to coax him out of it. The first time he’d read it, he’d snorted in contempt, the ever righteous Potter apologising for a conversation he had not instigated. The second and third time though, Draco began to feel guilt for his own part and absolution for Potter’s. Perhaps he’d judged Quidditchboy too rashly, perhaps they could have been friends? That’s if he’d not mucked it all up by leaving him hanging. But what to put? What lie could he conceive to explain his actions? Dragonpox outbreak? Wand gone faulty? Dementor uprising? No, Draco did the only thing he could, he told the truth (an abridged version at least).
Later that night, Draco laid restlessly in bed waiting. Finally, after checking that his bedmate’s breathing was heavy with sleep, he inched his way tentatively across their bedroom and to the dresser that was littered with various cosmetic concoctions that belonged to Astoria. Careful to not disturb her slumber, he retrieved his W-book and brought it into his cold study. Anxious to start it up, he waited til he could see the formation of the WOL script before he cast a few localised heating charms. The breath he’d not realised he’d been holding was released roughly when he saw that he’d received another message from Quidditchboy.
“Ah yes, I thought that had closed down a few years ago? Didn’t the owner decamp to the continent after the war?” Lucius asked with little care to the answer.
“Merlin Potter! Who gave you your licence? A dimmer than average troll?” The blonde was back to sneering now he was on safe ground.
“Yes well, sorry to disappoint, but I best be getting back to my date. I have been tasked with bringing her some water and I cannot fail my gentlemanly duty.” Draco smirked, unwilling to consider any deeper on why Potter’s appearance had discomforted him so much. He had just felt the urge to retreat back to Astoria where it was safe, rather than linger near those magnificently bright eyes.
“Seems you irked Potter, my son.” Lucius mused as he placed down a fresh copy of the Daily Prophet, complete with new scathing headlines about him and his store.
“Erm Malfoy? Why did you get me flowers?” He finally managed as the blonde had already swept by him and was reclining elegantly on his sofa as though he belonged there.
Draco stepped into the cosy abode, seeing the warm grey cushions and fluffy white blanket spread upon the cream sofa and he smiled. The place oozed comfort and was quintessentially Potter.
“Well, well. It would seem that despite how scandalous our image is, people still want to buy the cheaper alternative when it comes to goods.” Lucius smirked, pleased with the news.
“MACUSA are expecting you tomorrow evening, an international portkey has already been set up for then.”
“He’s nothing to me.” Draco shrugged, leaving Blaise to follow him in awkward silence as they strode steadily away from the shop.
“She has… but never on pockets. What else you got stashed in there?” Harry couldn’t help but ask as his eyes were fixed on the tight fabric where the pocket lay flat.
Kingsley just shook his head in reprimand. “Contrary to what you might think Auror Potter, you aren’t invincible. You need a partner and this could be the opportunity needed for you and Auror Malfoy to get along.”
Which was why when Stan, the loveable goofball that he was, greeted him with a cheerful, “Some day we had yesterday!” All Kyle could do was scowl and get into Stan’s pick up truck with a slam.
“Oh, I’ve heard about those.” Ginny piped up, having left her entourage of sport fanatics and reaching possessively for Harry’s hand. “Aren’t they supposed to limit your metabolism though?”
He saw Blaise’s eyes widen in shock. “Wow. That’s practically a proposal coming from you. Poor Astoria’s been waiting years to hear that from you. So when’s the meet up with the lucky guy?”
“..You can’t seriously tell me that your punishment from McGonogall was to take a biscuit?” Malfoy had spluttered in disbelief when Harry found himself regaling tales of his own exploits.
A waiter cut off any response that Harry might have made snidely by coming over to their now shared table and taking Draco’s order. He proceeded to order himself a pot of tea, ignoring Harry’s vehement protests that he was not sitting there.
“Yes.. The Committee for Restoration And Peace were all for serving the breakfast mojitos in glasses made from this muggle material ‘plastic’ as it’s supposedly unbreakable.” Astoria grimaced while she waited for Draco to act suitably horrified.
“No Weasellette- I mean Ginevra?” Draco stifled his habitual sneer, bad habits did always die hard. He’d noticed the lack of ginger and her belongings, and couldn’t help the frisson of hope that sparkled in his chest.
It seemed to be an almost daily occurrence that Draco dropped by to Harry’s abode and it was becoming increasingly addictive. He would waltz in to the living room, often with a new delight to share with Harry, and make himself at home on the sofa.
“You going to be gone all day?” He asked the redhead’s back as she bent down in front of him to tie her trainers.
Harry sighed, knowing that she could not (or would not) understand his plight and instead feigned interest in her latest complaint about the bias in sporting media. It was a usual topic for her, and Harry had no way of preventing it once it had begun. Unbeknownst to him, he wasn’t the only one with relationship woes as the holidays drew near.
Harry grinned at the antics of his godson. Teddy had woken Draco and himself up very early in his excitement to open his Christmas presents. Bouncing on their bed, he’d raced around the master bedroom whooping with joy as he sang “God rest ye merry hypogriff,” at the top of his lungs.
In just a short few days later, Draco had the beginnings of a migraine. The opening of the store had been a roaring success; he had witnessed the event under the guise of polyjuice. It would hardly help the company if their customers realised that the Malfoys were the owners. It was far better for Draco and his father to take a step back and enjoy the success from the anonymity of their GoodFaith Corporation.
“Harry. I’m so glad you came. I wasn’t sure if Ginny would be able to make you. You should visit Teddy before you leave, he’s in his room with Narcissa.”
His father’s study was as forebodingly decadent as ever when the two were shown in by one of their legions of house-elves. Draco had grown out of his childhood taste of ostentatious opulence, preferring his spacious and minimalistic home to the gaudy gold fixtures that plagued the study.
“Hmm, speaking of. You still speaking to that PenPal AKA Potter?” Blaise smirked with a knowing eyebrow arch. The blonde had always been obsessed with the Gryffindor from the second they had met.
“They sound pretty good.” Harry tried his best to be appeasing, but he could already tell this guy was pretty pompous. He kind of wondered why Draco wasn’t speaking up yet. When he turned to the blonde, he saw that the man was just standing in sullen silence, taking it all in. Must be a Slytherin trait, Harry surmised.
The aristocratic blonde soon regretted the decision to go to Diagon on such a crowded Saturday afternoon. Battling through teeming swarms of people; pushy mothers and imposing fathers, was made much more difficult with a young child in tow. Still, he had made it through worse, and how adventurous could a shopping trip be?
Draco was unsure how to combine the duality of Quidditchboy and Potter. One was a dear friend that he’d grown to respect and admire, Potter was well, Potter. It was hard to understand how the two could be one and the same. Though looking back through their previous history, it seemed obvious to him. Wading through a water fountain to rescue kids was such a Potter thing to do. The connection had been there all along, and Draco just didn’t know how to feel about it. He resolved to carry on as things were, talking to Quidditchboy in the same way as before, delusion had always been one of his favourite vices after all.
“I just don’t understand Draco, are you ashamed of me?” Astoria pouted as they spoke over their evening dinner.
Harry laughed humourlessly at that, still fuming from their earlier revelation. “Well, this has been pleasant but I think we should go.”
“So, I told you about that guy I’ve been talking to, right?” He began cautiously as Blaise perked up in interest. He’d not heard Draco speak about anything personal since Hogwarts, so he urged him on. Taking the cue. “Well, I’ve suggested meeting up with him, and he’s agreed.”
“Not that Harry, I thought you knew..” She wasn’t sure whether she should continue if he were truly ignorant.
“You sound like one of those fuddy duddy people that moan about the Weird Sisters being too edgy or something.” He sniffed, glaring at his companion.
Harry watched her as she strode across their carpeted bedroom purposefully. Her athletic body displayed alluringly in a mid thigh black dress. Long and slim legs showcased by her towering heels that made it so she reached near to his height. Grabbing her purse, she indicated to Harry that it was time for them to go, looping her arm through his as they stepped into the fireplace.
Loading, as always, took a while before the WOL server materialised and he saw that he had Owl-Mail as the icon indicated. He held his breath as he tapped his wand to determine whether it was from his PenPal. Exhilaration sprung through him when he realised it was indeed from SN7.
“What? Have you not seen an undetectable extension charm before? I’d have thought Granger would have used one.”
Harry thought but didn’t voice. He was just thankful Malfoy had got in the car and they could hopefully make it to the scheduled meeting on time. Instead he just said, “Buckle up Malfoy.”
“I know.” Draco hung his head. Then, in a moment of courage and humility, he stuck out his hand once more for Potter to shake. “But I do want to try.”
Mercifully they made it in one piece, with only one instance of Draco shouting in alarm at Harry about pedestrians on the other side of the road. It was fortunate that he had nerves of steel, and had half expected it from similar excursions with Ron, otherwise he might have swerved into oncoming traffic with the blonde shrieking in fear.
Pushing down any feelings of guilt, Harry tapped his wand to the nondescript parchment and waited in anticipation for the familiar looping script of WOL to appear. It was similar in look to his Marauder’s Map, running on the same runic Harry imagined. Except, this had the latest WAPPs, Wizarding Apps, and Harry was amazed at the innovation behind the fusion of magic and muggle technology.
“Don’t be rude Malfoy.” Harry hushed his partner, he’d noticed the official that had come out to greet them and worried that Malfoy would offend their hosts if he carried on. “Besides, they probably don’t want to attract Muggles.”
“Wait! Have a look for me! Tell me if he’s good looking?” Draco pleaded. Blaise rolled his eyes but dutifully peered through the window, searching for the blue handkerchief.
The ice cream had started to droop with the spring warmth as Draco sat with practiced elegance. Harry was bound to be bursting through the door at any second and Draco needed to at least appear poised.
“A guy? How scandalous! I didn’t know you had it in you.” Blaise looked positively delighted and Draco flushed.
The blonde cleared his throat. “Speaking of terrifying head of houses; got to admit Snape had that competition won fair and square.”
“Not that it’s any business of yours Malfoy, but I’m waiting for a friend I’m not sure if you’ve heard of those.” Harry replied tartly, horrified when Malfoy took this as an invitation to sit down.
Andy’s place had quickly warmed up with the sheer amount of body heat it contained and Harry yearned to switch the button up for one of his comfy T-shirts. Still, it had not been too bad thus far, and Ginny was clearly having a great time as she spoke exuberantly with her old Gryffindor chums. Feeling a bit out of his comfort zone, Harry excused himself to the bathroom, if only to gather a little bit of peace.
The pure blood woman showed her good manners with a handshake to both, startling the two Gryffindors. Ginny recovered first with a brusque handshake; “Call me Ginny. I think you were in my year? And of course we all know Malfoy.”
“What’s with all these people?” Kyle wondered aloud. Usually the school parking lot wasn’t this rammed, most students still opted to get the faithful yellow bus.
Harry kept his eyes on the road, the landscape was becoming much more hilly and snow covered as they drove further up in altitude, as he muttered under his breath.
Stan swore when he noticed that his friend had a point. The parking lot was rammed, some jerk had taken his usual place, and it was 8:37am according to the dashboard clock. Great.
The teen got up with a grunt, cracking his newly reformed bones. It was unfortunate that having just arisen from the dead didn’t excuse you from school, and so the blonde would have to get a move on if he was going to make it on time.
“Nothing better to do? No friends of your own to annoy?” Harry fumed, temper rising. “Oh yes, they’re all in askaban aren’t they?”
Draco couldn’t help but smile at his PenPal’s latest missive. The new store on Diagon was opening the day after tomorrow and the hectic schedule had impeded him from checking his WOL account. He could one hundred percent understand the plight of the other man; he too had experienced the heart-wrenching nausea that came from an insurmountable threat to one’s way of life. Sometimes he wished that they could reveal themselves to one another, but he was afraid that his friend would hold his defamed identity in contempt.
“How’s the plan going?” Blaise asked as he swept into the room with a languid gait. Draco looked up from his W-book and tried to hide the happiness he felt bubbling from him.
Harry accepted her hug and quick peck on the cheek in farewell, the lingering perfume making him sneeze. A few minutes after the front door had shut, Harry cautiously inched his way to the window. Upon seeing her sporty ponytail bounce with her spirited gait at the far side of the street, Harry bounded over to where he’d placed his W-Book the night before.
“Sorry for the intrusion Potter, Teddy here was adamant about seeing his ‘Uncle Harry’” Draco began as he ruffled the blonde hair of his smaller counterpart.
“I’m not sure you can ever make up for ruining my store.” Harry spoke softly with a tinge of melancholy.
“Trust me. I’m not.” Harry muttered darkly thinking about W.A.P amongst other songs. A part of him wanted to put it on, see the pureblood’s reaction to the lyrics, but he mostly didn’t want to listen to it himself, so he refrained.
“I don’t know. You Slytherins seemed pretty chill with him.” Harry laughed, happy for the resumption of the conversation.
“Aren’t you going to invite me in?” The blonde smirked and Harry’s face felt mysteriously hot as he saw the once over he was given. Realising his lack of modesty, he blushed further.
“That’s awfully kind of you Ken.” Butters gave him a megawatt smile, grateful to have his friend. “But to be honest, that’ll just make my dad more angry. It’s best to just leave him and he’ll forgive me for whatever bad thing I’ve done now.”
“South Park.” Craig replied in his nasally tone, wrapping an arm around the pissed off boy’s shoulders.
Harry woke up refreshed and eager to be back at work. Though he enjoyed having his Monday’s off, it certainly gave him time to finish digesting Molly’s extraordinary Sunday lunch, he adored his shop and the customers that frequented it.
“Oh.. erm.. Eric. Kenny and I aren’t.. you know.. doing that sort of stuff.” Butters blushed adorably as he spluttered about the sexual stuff. Kenny was just his friend, unfortunately.
If Malfoys were able to sweat, Draco would be dripping profusely. He was nervous. What’s if Potter hated him for lying to him? What’s if he didn’t want Draco at all and was expecting a wholesome do-gooder to be his PenPal?
“I think they like me Draco.” Astoria spoke spiritedly to him after one of his distant cousins had excused themselves to the bathroom. Draco nodded appeasingly at his date, who had carried on in her rambling monologue regardless. “…Everyone has been super nice, and the food’s been great. It’s hard to imagine your aunt doesn’t have a house-elf.”
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. “Really? I’d have killed you if it had meant saving my family. If I'd had had the chance.”
It was to Harry’s dismay that he realized he was growing used to Malfoy’s midnight screaming. This time, however, Harry didn’t go to stop it. It felt like a knife to his stomach to lie there in the dark, listening to Malfoy cry out two floors below. Harry wanted to get up, he did, but the part of him that was humiliated overpowered the part of him that was worried. It felt like torture to lay there doing nothing but listening until Malfoy’s nightmare finally ended.
Malfoy sat quietly at the table, his phone in hand. He was wearing what looked like a terribly old maroon jumper, and Harry stared at it for a long time before he realized it was most certainly
So when Harry brought himself downstairs and found Malfoy waiting beside the stairs yet again, he felt his face flush with embarrassment, before he’d even said good morning.
“Will you be doing it at the Burrow, then?” Harry wondered aloud, it was weird to think of his two best friends getting married.
Harry did as he was told, and watched as Malfoy ruffled through his things. He brought out a little pencil and a compact and made his way back toward Harry. Harry pulled his glasses off, placing them on the coffee table.
for this, Potter. I was forced.” His voice was like venom in the silence of the room. Harry wanted to reach over and strangle him.
Harry didn’t say anything. He met Malfoys dark eyes. They reminded him of the rain outside, a storm.
“Wow, ten years since we started school. Weird.” Harry mumbled. Malfoy nodded in agreement. Harry thought that the last ten years both felt more like one hundred years and two years at the same time. So much had happened since Harry first stepped foot on the Hogwarts express that he felt as though he’d lived an entire lifetime since then, but somehow he remembered that day like it was yesterday.
Harry cast a muffling charm on his door, just in case it happened again, and willed himself to sleep. His will alone proved faulty, and Harry lay staring up at the ceiling until his alarm clock began blaring beside him.
There was a large sofa to Harry’s right, it was dark brown leather, and in front sat a coffee table that was also made of glass. Harry looked around in wonder. A book sat open on the coffee table and Harry noticed a shelf full of books against the wall behind the sofa. Harry made his way around the flat, which was much larger than he had anticipated. He came across muggle photographs of Malfoy and other people Harry didn’t recognize, as well as one celebrity he did. The kitchen was made up in marble and dark wood. Malfoy’s cooking appliances looked barely used, and he had half a pot of cold coffee still sitting out on the counter beside the sink. When Harry made his way down the hallway of the flat, he found a guest bedroom that looked like it had come straight out of a shopping catalogue. The bathroom in the hallway was also very neat and shiny. Harry could tell Malfoy prefered his place to be spotless.
Harry approached the closet wearily, there were so many items to choose from. He was drawn to the darker items in the closet, as in Harry’s mind Malfoy was typically dressed in black. Or green.
“You spent all those summers with muggles, yet you still dress in jeans and sweatshirts. You’re mad.” Malfoy was teasing, Harry knew that, but still, he felt defensive.
“You would have been brilliant no matter which house you were placed in. You’re Harry bloody Potter, it wouldn’t have mattered in the end.”
“So have you and Hermione set a date yet?” Harry asked as he sat down. He pulled the lid off his salad, grabbing the packet of dressing and ripping it open.
since then. What did the rest of my family do?” Ron’s ears were turning red and Harry found himself shifting uncomfortably in his seat.
Harry shrugged and they reached the foyer. Harry dropped Malfoys hands and handed him his crutches. “Not particularly.” said Harry, turning away from Malfoy to head toward the kitchen.
“What?” He seemed earnest, as though he was genuinely interested. Harry wasn’t quite fooled, Malfoy would only be luring Harry in to take the piss out of him.
“You don’t even have a television in this awful place.” He complained. “And all your books are about magic.”
“I think I got it the first time, Malfoy.” Harry sighed. He stood up to face Malfoy, who looked very relaxed for someone who was sending their childhood rival into their apartment unattended.
“I know, none of us lived it through your eyes. That doesn’t change the fact that we needed you Harry, and we still do. The war was hard but none of us will ever move on if
“You’re not wearing your glasses.” Was how Ron greeted him when he stepped out of the lift. Harry huffed and folded his arms across his chest.
Malfoy was staring at Harry intently, and Harry was staring dramatically into his cup of black coffee. As an awkward silence began to stretch between Harry and Malfoy once again, Kreacher appeared with plates full of eggs and toast.
Thank you for reading the first chapter, I'm not sure how long this fic will be but I'm really excited to write it! Kudos and comments are greatly appreciated!
been shouted out in Malfoy’s live video the day before. He opened instagram to a plethora of comments and likes, even though he’d only ever posted one photo.
Malfoy shook his head, “Boots.” He sighed, crossing his arms over his chest. “You’re shit at this, I hope you know.”
“You never said you didn’t.” Harry argued fiercely. He didn’t know why he was so angry all of a sudden, but he knew he wanted Malfoy to feel it too.
“I can’t believe you!” Harry snarled as he gripped the blonde’s arm forcefully and pulled him to a secluded corner.
They sat, comfortably sharing their usual tea when Harry felt that he couldn’t contain his excitement any longer.
Harry sat strangely nervous as the hour drew closer to when Draco would arrive. He’d changed out of his outfit a good few times before selecting his first outfit again. Shaking his head, he chided himself, it was only Malfoy after all.
“Well, she also looked very, very disappointed with me too?” Harry protested with vehement laughter.
This did make Draco smile as he was reminded about the story his hapless PenPal had told him, about how he had tried to stop his godchildren from wreaking havoc and had ended up being soaked from the waist down after wading through a wishing fountain to rescue/coral the imps. He’d apparently had a meeting with a client shortly thereafter and had seemingly forgotten the existence of drying charms as he wrote about anxiously trying to dry off with paper towels and napkins.
Draco cut him off before the damage could truly be done. “ … I’ve been to one. But Teddy, I don’t think Potter is interested in that, he’s got customers to see I’m sure.”
Draco paused as he pretended to be intently surveying a trophy snitch on the shelf in front of him. “I don’t know Blaise. Can you like someone you’ve never met?”
Feeling obligated to speak and carry the conversation onwards, Draco searched for a new conversation starter., “I didn’t realise you owned this place Potter till the other day.
The enthusiasm with which Harry consumed the letter surprised him; he felt a shocking resonance with his PenPal’s predicament. More and more lately, Harry had been feeling like his relationship with Ginny was just not working out, but he was terrified of the Weasleys’ reactions, particularly Molly’s. He knew she’d been planning their wedding for a very long time, even though he’d yet to show any sign of proposal. In the very deepest corners of his mind he knew, he knew that their breakup was inevitable. He’d just not even had the chance to see her in a good long while. It was not the sort of thing that you’d do over floo or w-mail after all.
Draco was crying and sobbing, "Harry!", he screamed and he sounded pathetic in his own ears, "No, Harry!"
Some of Harry's favourite evenings were those when Draco was already at the house when he came from work, he waited for him with dinner and Harry showed him Muggle telly shows, until they fell asleep on the couch together. (The last part was often preceded and followed by hot, dirty sex on random objects in the house.)
He didn't only love it because it was comfy, but because it was a sign of getting accepted into this family. A perspective that would have filled him with dread a few years ago, but now filled him with joy and love for this new life he and Harry had started to build.
Pregnant. Right. They were both men, born as such, too. Harry was very well acquainted with Draco’s cock and his ass, no way he was hiding a pussy and a uterus somewhere down there too.
Trixie nodded, closed the door and turned to Harry, "The Master will not receive you, he is terribly sorry, maybe to another time, but you should try to make an appointment first."
"I'm sorry", Harry muttered, "I swear I didn't know he was being serious. Just- just let me talk to him, please."
Harry crossed his arms in front of his chest, "See this exactly why I didn't want to tell you! I knew you wouldn't understand. He has changed a lot since then, okay? He's a good person."
"I got fat", he complained and wrapped his arms around him, resting his head on his shoulder with a sob.
Harry could make out the outline of Draco's baby bump from here already. He bit his bottom lip and then quickly crossed the room until he stood in front of him. He went down on both knees and took Draco's hand, "I'm sorry.", he said sincerely, "I'm so sorry, I swear I had no idea it was possible. I would have never said what I said if I thought there was a chance it might be true."
Harry was reminded of that stupid saying "You only know what you had once you lost it" or something like that.
"It made me wonder...", Harry said after a moment of silence, "If you already had feelings for me then."
Sometimes he just sat in front of the family tree tapestry, looking in horror from one family member's face to the other.
They treated Scorpius not with less or more love and adoration than the other post-war Weasleys (namely the two daughters (so far) of Bill and Fleur, and Percy's first daughter, George's wife was currently pregnant)
"Wait, wait", Harry said, "Are you telling me that I legitimately knocked up my boyfriend, made fun of him when he told me and said he was gonna be fat?"
"Oi, Scorpius, Scorpius Potter-Malfoy has anyone ever told you, you look exactly like your father. Except for the eyes. You got your other father’s eyes.”
Narcissa came to the burrow as well for one evening, Molly had invited her for dinner. The two women found a common ground and friendship in being Scorpius' grandmothers.
"You dare to come here? At first, you disgrace my son, then you toss him to the street and now you dare to come here? I should have revealed you to the Dark Lord, after all, maybe I will do what he bloody couldn't!"
In the evening Harry and Draco lay on the couch in the drawing-room in front of the fireplace, Draco's head rested in Harry's lap.
He wasn't calling for Harry to come, he wasn't sure if the man was even home yet, he just called out his name in pain, like he had in his head back at the Battle of Hogwarts.
Harry chuckled, "Yes, but you still look beautiful. Our child will be beautiful too, and we will be a great little family and I'll marry you in a big, amazing ceremony."
Harry wasn't quite sure what happened after that, but the next morning he woke up in Grimmauld Place with Malfoy in his bed. Naked. Malfoys pale neck displayed a red, big hickey.
"Are you gonna tell me what you want to tell me, or do you want to wait until tomorrow?", he joked, "Do you want me to guess?"
Harry couldn’t help the grin on his face while watching Sirius laughing and quickly running back to his fathers, “I’m so bloody proud of him. We should have another child.”
"Certain people" was a long list of names, that grew continuously over the years, of people Harry was very rarely in the mood to see - like the entire staff of the Daily Prophet. Draco Malfoy wasn't on it.
It had been a month since the trials, and during this month nothing much in their routines had changed. They had kept on going to the Weasley’s every Sunday for dinner, and even though Ron was still mad at them for testifying for the Malfoy family, he had mellowed a little. Harry had also gone a few times to Andromeda’s house to spend time getting to know his godson, and he couldn’t be prouder of the little man he was growing to be. During this month they had received their Hogwarts letter for their eighth year, and as much as Harry had wanted to refuse at first, Hermione had insisted in the fact that they needed their education, and therefore they had to attend for their final year and take their NEWTs. However, they had not managed to convince Ron, as he had decided that he would help George in managing Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. They had also received a very heartfelt letter from Mrs Malfoy thanking them for their help during the trials and for saving his son from a life in prison. During their last week of summer, they had gone to Diagon Alley to get their supplies for the year, and it had been as chaotic as it could get; once they had arrived at the Alley people had started bothering them and thanking them for defeating the Dark Lord, and it had only gotten worse once the reporters had arrived. Finally, they had opted to change their appearance with some charms, and they had managed to do their shopping with tranquillity.
“What! Have you two gone bonkers?! It’s Malfoy we are talking about! The git who called you mudblood, who also tried to kill me in sixth year and tried to cast the Cruciatus on Harry!”
When they descended the carriages, he could immediately feel a hand gripping his. He looked around expecting to see destruction everywhere but instead, he found Hogwarts just as it had ever been. Clearly a lot of effort had been put into the repairs during the summer, in order for Hogwarts to be the same for all the students coming back. At seeing everyone starting to go up into the castle Harry started to walk to, but he realised that Hermione was not moving; she was rooted in place gripping Harry’s hand for dear life. Harry saw that she had her eyes fixed into something, and when she followed her gaze, he saw that she was staring at the Astronomy Tower. He realised that she was clearly remembering the day that he had jumped and seemed lost in time. He quickly told his friends to keep going and he turned facing Hermione. With his free hand, she took gently Hermione’s face and made her look at him in the eyes.
kidding me because as far as I can see, I’m am not the only one fucked up in here, and not the only one who has been hiding this from the other one. So don’t start mothering me Hermione because you are not my mum!”.
"But w-why would t-t-they worry? Why would a-a-anyone worry? No one c-c-cares about m-me, I've b-brought nothing but p-pain."
“Harry darling, don’t you worry. I know you are blaming yourself for not being there for Teddy, maybe for not even having thought about him. But believe me that I’m not blaming you. You are just a child, you should not be caring for another being, please don’t put that pressure on yourself. You have gone through a lot; it’s understandable that in this time of grieve you have not been with Teddy, but don’t you worry, he is just a baby, he still has a long life ahead of him. A life in which I don’t have any doubt in knowing that you will be a part of. Making a lot of memories with him, making him laugh, helping him through the hard times, as well as telling him stories about his parents, because Merlin knows that you are the more adequate one to keep their legacy alive. So, don’t worry because you have missed a few months of his life. From now on I know that you will be there for him, but by no means will I force you to see him, only if you are prepared. I also know that you are worried about me, I can see it in your face, and yes I have lost my family, but I have been given a new one and I intend to cherish it with all of my heart, I can only hope that you will do the same.”
“Oh, yes, of course, I mean McGonagall already knows, and she told me to tell her if we hadn’t found him by curfew to help us look for him, I suppose I forgot to tell you about it, sorry. But nevertheless, you could always take Harry’s map to help you avoid everyone else, it’s how he’s managed all these years to break the rules and not get caught for it”.
Harry could see in the faces of his classmates, that they still did not understand anything, however, and he and Hermione seemed to know where they were going, they decided to follow them. Soon enough, they were all standing in front of Fluffy’s door.
Harry could not believe what he had heard. They had managed to avoid Draco and Narcissa being sent to Azkaban. Although it had been their intention when they testified, Harry had not truly believed that they would be able to do it, because the Malfoy’s had committed many crimes. Even though he was not ecstatic about them being out, he understood why it had to be done, and deep down, he was grateful for it. They did not deserve to go to Azkaban. The Members of the Wizengamot left the courtroom, and after them, the Malfoy’s were taken away. Finally, Minister Shacklebolt spoke again, dismissing everyone from the courtroom.
She and Blaise were seated in the common room trying to think of what to do next. Hermione was thinking of going to the Girl’s Bathroom on the second floor and sitting in front of the Chamber’s entrance to see whether Harry came out of it or not, while Blaise was to keep on patrolling the castle to see if he found Harry somewhere else.
Hermione, as always the voice of reason, had already deciphered where it was – “Well, it’s quite obvious don’t you think Harry” – at seeing the look of incredulity that he gave her, she decided to give him another little clue – “She has said that our dorms are in the third floor, Harry. Does that ring any bells?” – again, he just gave her a look of incredulity, but she was having fun leading them on, so she continued without telling where it was, and decided to give him a final clue – “Come on, Harry, it is not that hard. Now think quickly, because we managed not to get killed, so I would not like to get expelled, because we broke our curfew the first day, it would be so much worse”.
At hearing those words Harry started sobbing. Hearing the acceptance in Mrs Weasley – Molly – and hear her call him part of her family broke his heart. He truly belonged, even if he was not able to believe it before, he could see it now, he truly belonged with this family, his family.
He started thinking through about what Hermione had said, and he saw that Hermione might be right. They were not trying to kick him out of their lives, even though it might be hard to understand why they would want him in their lives, they were asking them both to come back into them, to be a part of their family. He did not want to bring them more pain, so if this was what they wanted, he would try it and go to dinner.
With that last word, he turned around and storm out of their dorm, not once caring that he was only wearing his pyjamas and had blood all over his arm. Hermione was left stunned and heartbroken. She knew that she was not his mum, nor did she intend to be, however, she did consider him family, and even though she knew that he had said those hurtful words as a defence mechanism, that did not mean that they hurt any less.
“Yes, I know what you mean, I thought so too. But I realized that we did not have that chemistry anymore, he wanted to give a shot to our relationship, but I couldn’t. Those months that we were in the forest without him, it changed me, and that change is something that cannot be undone, it is too late…”
“There, there, darling. Let it all out, everything will be alright. Now come on go and say hi, dinner will be ready in five minutes.”
“Ok Hermione, I’ll try it. We’ll go to dinner this Sunday, but I don’t think that I’m up to any kind of celebration, not yet”
He suddenly lifted his head and realised that he had arrived at the Astronomy Tower. He did not know how he had arrived there, but he did not find the will to care anymore. Being in this tower always brought to his mind memories of the day that Dumbledore had died, how he had fallen down the Tower into his death, and once again he was brought to his remorseful thoughts. Dumbledore's death had been so simple, so sad. A quick Avada Kedavra and a quick fall and everything had stopped for him. What a simple death for such a powerful man. It filled him with impotency to think of his death because it was another one that he could have avoided, another place where he had failed; if he had not been trapped under his cloak he could have done something, been better, and Dumbledore might still be alive.
Every comment is welcome, even if it is to tell me you enjoyed this chapter, which I hope, or to give me some recommendations.
. They had been searching the map for about twenty minutes, and had almost looked through it all when suddenly Hermione let a loud shriek, and as fast as lighting stood up from the floor and started running towards the entrance of the dorms, with Blaise once again hot on her heels.
Harry stood, as did Hermione. Surprisingly for him, he saw Professor McGonagall also stand up from the crowd assembled in the atrium, as well as Andromeda Tonks, who he had not seen in the crowd. He was surprised to see her because the day before she had not mentioned going to the trial, however, taking into account that Narcissa was her sister, he should not have been that surprised. No one else, apart from them four stood up. Harry silently tanked Merlin, that no one else stood, because he firmly believed that the four of them were there to defend rather than accuse, and he did not want anyone presenting more crimes if they wished to free both Narcissa and Draco.
She had been all morning looking, for Harry, but by lunchtime, she was no closer to finding him. That is why she asked for Blaise help, while he had no class. They spend the whole lunch hour as well as a great part of the afternoon searching the whole castle and the grounds, however, they had not been able to find him.
They spent a few hours more together, just in the company of one another. There was no need for words, not anymore. It was another perk of having lived together for so long. You just knew when the other just needed the company, without anything to be said.
“That’s all I’m asking Harry, for you to try, nothing more. I will write our response to Molly right now and send it”
“It has to be in here somewhere, it has to…” – she kept murmuring on and on – “Found it! I knew it had to be here.”
There stood Andromeda with little Teddy in her arms. How could he have forgotten of his Godson? He had not for one moment wondered how he was, and though he knew that he was living with Andromeda, he had not once made a move to see how he was, as well as Andromeda, who had not only lost her husband in this war but also her daughter and son-in-law. He once again started sobbing in despair and felt his legs go weak. Just as he was about to fall to the ground, he felt someone’s arms embracing him and supporting him, and he immediately knew that it was Hermione. He leaned against her and started sobbing in earnest on her shoulder. She did not speak, there was no need to, she just kept rubbing his back until he was able to calm himself. Everyone knew why he had broken down, so they kept quiet, waiting for the right moment to speak. Obviously, the first one who did so was Andromeda, who said something which Harry did not anticipate.
I'm so sorry for taking so long to write this chapter, but first I didn't have inspiration, and then I had to present a school project, and I did not have time to write.
Through the ups and downs, they managed to carry on. May became June, and June July, and without really realizing it, they were a few days away from Harry’s birthday. Harry and Hermione were having a light breakfast in the backyard when suddenly he saw a little owl coming from the distance. He immediately knew that it was a letter from the Weasleys, Pig couldn’t be mistaken. He wondered what they wanted, after all, they had not maintained contact since Fred’s funeral, because they had felt like it was better to leave the Weasley Family time to grieve in peace. When Pig arrived, Harry took his letter and gave him some of his ham so he could recover from the long journey. He opened the letter and started to read it out loud for Hermione to hear, as he saw it was addressed to them both.
Hermione stared at Harry’s eyes while he said those dreaded words. She could not believe that Harry had seen her without the Glamour on, without the last piece of armour that she had to keep herself going. She looked down to the floor, too ashamed to look into Harry’s eyes, and it was then that she saw the blood pooling onto the floor. She let out a shriek, causing her out of her shock of being discovered, and forgetting about it, while also making Harry realise that he had blood flowing freely down his arm.
“First of all, welcome back. Now, I know that you are all asking yourselves why you are seated separated to your houses, and why I have asked you to stay behind. Hogwarts is equipped to have seven different years, not eight, but as you could not finish your schooling last year, we have given you the opportunity to return. As you can see only sixteen of you have decided to do so. However, even if you are only sixteen, we do not have extra dorms for you in your Houses. Furthermore, if it had not been for last year, you wouldn’t be here, and you would be able to do as you please, meaning that you wouldn’t have curfews nor limits. Therefore, it has been decided that from Friday night, until Sunday night, you will be able to do as you please. You can visit your families, you can go wherever you want and do whatever you want, with only one condition, to be back on Sunday before 11 p.m. Your curfew on weekdays has also been extended. You will be able to go to Hogsmeade for the whole week, but you all have to be at your dorms before midnight. Do not believe that having these liberties exempts you of your duties as students, we will not tolerate tardiness in any homework presentation, and neither for you to be asleep at class. As I’ve said before, we do not have room for you, and as you have more liberties than your fellow schoolmates, you will not be living with your housemates. We have prepared new sleeping quarters for you all. There are eight different rooms, and as you are only sixteen, you will be roomed in pairs. You can room in however you want, you are all adults, and I don’t care how you organise yourselves; this also means that it can be mixed rooms. You will find a tabloid with a grid for you to organise your different pairs. Lastly, I would like to tell you that I expect a lot from you all, youngsters. As I’ve said before, I won’t tolerate prejudices and less of all from you. You have fought to be where you are now, and I won’t accept pass grudges to continue. I expect you all to be an example of unity for the whole school. Do not disappoint me. Now, do you have any questions for me? If not, you will be able to go to your rooms, after all, I’m sure that it has been a long day.”
Draco couldn’t hold in the laugh he felt rising at his friend’s paranoia. “Blaise. For salazar’s sake, how could it be a trap? She suggested it as she knows it was our tradition and she knows Theo and I will keep you out of trouble.”
He had finally managed to distract himself when he heard his bird tap gently on the window with a dainty claw. Heart beating nervously, time seemed to stand still as he clutched at the letter. Ignoring Archimedes’ squawk of dismay, he ripped open the ribbon that bound the scroll of parchment and read.
In amidst the pandemonium that was the business with his store, it would have been easy to forget his PenPal’s proposal to meet in person. But Harry didn’t. Harry couldn’t, the anticipation to meet this man consumed him. He couldn’t help but wonder what he would be like; Harry suspected he’d be coolly attractive, perhaps elegant? He certainly wrote that way.
“Gah. Then why is South Park High trending Craig?” The blonde asked demandingly. He was even more done with this town than Kyle.
Taking Harry’s silence as a rejection, Draco laughed self-deprecatingly. “I guess there’s my answer.”
“He uses one of those diluted dreamless sleep if he’s particularly stressed.” Astoria chipped in as she joined Draco’s side, slightly more worse for wear.
Four days later and Draco had accomplished many things. The first being, of course, not succumbing to the sickness brought on by his depravity filled night of alcohol abuse. A handy hangover potion, whilst unpleasant, allowed Draco to at least somewhat function as Vice-President of their company. The second success though had required far more tactical negotiation, wheedling and pleading, to get Blaise to acquiesce to coming to the night’s big meeting with his PenPal.
The tinkling of the bell chimed the arrival of her another entry into his store. This customer did not wait for Harry to greet them, instead he began running towards the hapless hero with a high pitched squeal.
Potter would Draco thought to himself, remembering how it felt to be clung to the saviour, arms wrapped tightly around muscles as they flew high above searing flames. He shuddered at the memory as it licked warmth to his present and he knew without a doubt that he had his answer. Potter, or at least Quidditchboy, understood him, Potter had always managed to get under his skin, inciting a whirlpool of feelings that he’d struggled to suppress while at Hogwarts. Draco knew that he’d been more than attached to Quidditchboy and therefore Potter by default. The trouble was, how was he to get Potter to give him a chance?
Before Kyle could call him out on his rudeness, there was a crash of noise as Tweek burst in through the school’s main entranceway, looking harried as he scrambled over to them.
Meanwhile I have ideas for my usual cute South Park stuff that’s my typical fic style that I might just write.
“I best be going Potter, you’ve things to do after all.” Harry watched sadly as Draco left the room. He shook himself, he did have a date to prepare for after all.
He felt the air in his face, accompanying him one last time through his travel, like so many times before. He felt nothing but happiness as he fell, nothing but a deep sense of peacefulness. He was going to meet his parents. He was going to live with them. He would be home, with Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Fred, Dumbledore, and all those who had perished at the hands of the Dark Lord, and he could not feel more relieved.
“Oh, thank Merlin, you are finally home! I have missed you both so much. Come in, come in, everyone is in the leaving room, come and say hi.”
Harry woke up with a start from another nightmare, sweating and hyperventilating and also with swollen eyes from crying so much. Since coming to Hogwarts, they had been much more frequent, there was not a night when he didn’t suffer from a nightmare. However, today's had been more extreme than ever. He had always had the punctual nightmare where everyone blamed him, but never to that degree. He had tried to cope. He had tried, however every day it was getting harder and harder, there was only one thing that alleviated him. He had promised Hermione not to do it, and it broke his heart to break a promise to his sister, but he could not handle that hurt anymore, it was too much, too tough. To see the suffering in everyone eyes, the distaste, the hate that they held, it made him anguished.
From now on I'll try to be more constant and try to post every four days or so, though I cannot promise anything.
The Aurors took Malfoy and his parent to a seat located in the centre of the room, and once they were seated, chain sprung out from them and bound them to the chair. Once they were bound, Minister Shacklebolt started to state the crimes for which they were being judged for.
“You’ve been sleeping for five days. That’s why we were so worried, but I suppose that it was your body’s way of healing.”
“But I thought that you wanted to be with him, you were so devastated when he left… and then when he destroyed the Horcrux it showed us together and it made him so jealous that I thought…”
He felt Hermione starting to tug him to make him move, but he felt rooted in the spot. Against his will, he started to move and to walk towards the Burrow. When they were mere meters away from the front door he saw it opening and saw Mrs Weasleys come through. His heart gave a lump and he once again felt as if he could not move. Hermione kept urging him to keep going on, so slowly he arrived where Mrs Weasley was waiting for them. And then, the unexpected happened. He engulfed them both in a breath-taking hug and started crying.
“I don’t care whether they are a Slytherin, a Gryffindor, a Ravenclaw or a Hufflepuff. They are Hogwarts students and they should be welcome to our school as so. We should welcome them to their new home, not just to their new house. It is a place unknown to all of them, they have just arrived here. They barely know anyone, and the first thing we do when they arrive here is distributed them in different houses, and instead of being extra support, we turn it into the only support they have. We discriminate anyone who is not in our house, and for those who their only friend goes to another house, they are left with no one once again. We should be a school, not four houses. We should unite not divide. Everyone has been able to see what happens when we divide, and we cannot let that happen again. Let the past be a lesson to everyone toward a better future. So yes, I am applauding to a young boy who has been sorted into Slytherin, because no matter the house he is in, he is also a new student to our school, and we should welcome them all to it.”
When they left, Ron was still huffing, but at least he said no more about the trials. They arrived at Grimmauld Place in a solemn mood and headed directly to bed. It was late, and the following day would be a long one indeed.
“Well for what it is worth, I’m glad you decided to put your rivalry apart and help them, Harry. Though I hate to be the one to break it to you, we will have to tell the Weasleys, and they won’t be happy about it.”
“Hey, Hermione. It’s okay, I’m okay. I’m here Hermione, and I don’t intend on going anywhere” – he said quietly to her. He saw that she started to blink as if trying to rid herself of a memory and to root herself in the present, so he continued talking to her – “I know that it’s difficult Hermione, and I don’t know if it will get easier, I can only hope that it does. But what I do know is that I’m going to be by your side through every step of the way. It is going to be hard, but I’m going to be there for you, just like I know that you are going to be there for me. You’re my sister Hermione, and I love you with all that I have”.
“Thank you, Mr Potter, for your statement. You may leave the stand and retake your seat. Mrs Tonks if you could come forward, and take the stand, please.” – said Minister Shacklebolt once he had finished with his statement.
Everywhere he looked there was nothing but wreckage, endless hallways full of runes. His first home, destroyed. His only family, gone. There was no more hope for him. Yes, Voldemort had been destroyed, the war had ended, but what was the meaning of carrying on if there was nothing else for him, if he once again had no parents. Sirius, dead, and all because of him. Remus, dead. And Severus, the man who he had always despised but had found to be the bravest man to have ever walked on earth, was dead too. Everything, every death was because of him, because he had not been fast enough, smart enough, he had not been able to find the Horcruxes earlier nor been faster to destroy them. He had hidden in a tent while everyone else braved this war without him and, in the end, it had all been for nothing.
When the sorting started, Headmistress McGonagall raised from her seat and went into the stand to give her welcoming speech before the Feast started.
“The accused have pleaded themselves guilty of their charges. Now, as is normal procedure in wizarding trials, before the Wizengamot leaves to make a resolution, witnesses may take the stand in order to attest to their crime or to defend the accused. Those who wish to act as witnesses please stand.”
He spent a whole hour talking to the Weasley Family. They berated him for doing what he did, although they said that they understood and, strangely, Harry believed them. These were hard times for everyone and grieve was no stranger to anyone. Throughout the talk Harry started to remember what it was like to have a family; after all, the Weasley’s were the first family that had accepted him. He also started to remember what it was like to be cared for. But it was still hard to see a future for himself, he did not fit. Even though the Weasleys were there for him, he still could not feel that he truly belonged, they were not his true family, he felt like he was just a stray they had picked. When they finally left, he was left alone with Hermione. She was the only person who could see as his true family, his sister, a person who he could trust with his whole heart and without any doubt. He loved her, and she was a little bright spark in his dark existence, the only important reason to keep going and to keep trying. After a few minutes of comfortable silence, Hermione suddenly broke it and said something which Harry did most certainly not expect.
“Thank you, Draco.” Harry whispered. Malfoy’s eyes faltered, his gaze dropping down to Harry’s lips, and jumping back up as quickly as they had gone.
to do all the horrible things I did. To say all the horrible things I said. To you, to Wealsey, to Granger." He paused. His voice sounded sad. "It was only in the end when I realized that none of this could save me or my family at all.”
Malfoy tasted like nothing. Harry distinctly remembered kissing Ginny and tasting something sweet, and kissing Cho and tasting salty tears, he had never kissed anyone and not been able to identify it. It made Harry irrationally angry that he wouldn’t be able to remember a taste to Malfoy’s mouth. He was so furious that he barely registered Malfoy kissing him back. Malfoy’s lips didn’t fit right, and Harry let out a half-growl in frustration. Harry’s hands fell away from Malfoy’s collar, and he reached up to cup Malfoy’s cheeks in his hands before he’d even realized what he was doing.
They ate in silence, Malfoy scrolled through his phone while Harry sipped on his coffee quietly. It occurred to Harry that he was stuck with Malfoy for more than a few days. The two of them hadn’t been stuck in anything together since their school years, and Harry thoughtfully realized he wasn’t sure he and Malfoy had a single thing in common.
“I sure am.” He joked, his face breaking into a smile. “What is this sweater? Oh I found it here.” Malfoy was still wearing the awful Weasley sweater. “Maroon isn’t my colour.” Malfoy said and Harry grinned. The chat was going so fast that Harry only caught a few single words. His name popped up a number of times, as did a few words that made Harry fight off the urge to blush.
“So have I, Potter.” Malfoy said pointedly. He looked toward Harry, and Harry felt as if he was being forced to look away from Malfoy’s piercing eyes.
Harry couldn’t explain what came over him, but in a second he had pulled Malfoy across the gap between them, and Malfoy didn’t fight it.
The wall to his left was almost entirely made of glass. It looked out over muggle London and Harry could see as far as the River Thames. Sunlight was shining into the room through gloomy clouds, making everything bright and washed out compared to number Twelve Grimmauld Place.
It worked, as Harry had never heard the word come out of Malfoy’s mouth. “Okay, fine. Since you asked so nicely.”
Harry felt his eyes widen, and he loosened his grip on Malfoy’s collar. “Saving me?” He asked, his voice suddenly falling weak.
some people. When Harry would finish one case, the follow-up was a copious amount of paperwork that had to be completed before he could step into a new one.
Harry magicked himself a plate of the food that Kreacher had prepared, and he ate quietly. Harry pulled his cellphone out of his pocket, turning it on for the first time that day. He was taken by surprise at the amount of notifications displayed on his screen, but he
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. “The famous Harry Potter can save the world, but he can’t dress himself properly? What a shame.” He snatched the boots from his side and placed them with the joggers and turtleneck. “I need a chain for this one.” He muttered, mostly to himself.
shoes, which he had only two, and they were currently on each of his feet. As Harry sat in the door to Malfoy’s closet, he noticed a few boxes sitting behind the array of shoes. Letting curiosity get the best of him, Harry reached back and pulled two of the boxes out.
“You’re more than that, Draco. You’re someone who survived a war. Someone who was raised on the wrong side and managed to work a mind of his own. You’re a brilliant wizard, Draco. Don’t think so low of yourself. People can change, you know.”
“I think I left them by the door. Perhaps you’re off the hook.” Malfoy smiled smugly. He reached forward to move one of the turtlenecks away from the pile and beside his army green joggers. “What do you think, the joggers with the boots,” He pointed toward the single pair of black combat boots sitting to his left, “Or the vans.” He pointed to a pair of flat, black and white checkered shoes to his right.
“I fucked up! Is that what you want me to say? I did what I had to do!” Malfoy shouted, his chest heaved with the effort, Harry’s hands were bunched in the collar of Ron’s forgotten jumper.
Harry stared at him expectantly, “What is it?” Harry thought of eighteen embarrassing and awful things he could be asked in the few seconds that it took for Malfoy to respond.
“Harry’s house.” Malfoy offered. Harry caught himself a split second before correcting Malfoy. He had been overcome with the need to say ‘
By lunch Harry had fallen asleep on his desk twice, and thank Merlin for Ron, because it was him who woke Harry.
Harry hummed in acknowledgement, and made his way toward Draco. He took a seat on the opposite end of the couch.
Harry heard a few typical crashes and clanks, and he cringed as he hoped that his glasses hadn’t taken any of the damage. A moment later they zoomed into his hand, and he placed them on his face. Feeling as though he had been squinting all day, he felt his eyes relax.
loved Ginny. Malfoy had just pissed Harry off. They had been fighting, it was a heated moment, they were already close, Malfoy looked down at Harry’s lips…
Malfoy continued attempting to read the chat as it flew up the screen. Harry leaned closer to take a look, and saw that there were over one million people watching them right at that moment, and Harry felt oddly embarrassed.
Harry placed the papers back on his desk and stood up from his chair. He recast the charm on his eyes, bringing the world back into proper focus before him.
to be like my parents, I did what I did because I wanted to save them. I’d do it again if it meant saving them, and you.”
me, you twat!” Malfoy grabbed the coffee table to pull himself back into a standing position. His cheeks were so red that Harry thought he looked sunburnt.
His eyes were encased with black, and Harry hardly recognized himself. The green in his eyes stood out proudly amongst the darkness that surrounded them, and his cheeks and nose were a soft peach colour. Harry was so blown away he thought perhaps Malfoy had replaced this mirror with a charmed one in the time Harry had his eyes closed. He turned to look at Malfoy behind him.
Malfoy continued answering questions, mainly about Harry and their time in school. Malfoy worked hard to avoid mentioning much about Hogwarts or the nature of the school and Harry sat down in the chair beside Malfoy, leaning toward Malfoy until their shoulders were touching. Harry read off a couple questions himself and Malfoy shot him a look full of amusement.
Harry. Harry felt so confused, Malfoy had reappeared in his life out of nowhere, and was immediately wreaking havoc on Harry’s brain. “Yeah, OK.” Harry replied, his mind stuck elsewhere. He shuffled the paperwork around, looking through.
Harry found himself chuckling as he placed it back into the box. The rest of the first box was made up of various old magical objects that seemed to be from the time Harry and Malfoy had spent at Hogwarts. Harry pushed the first box back toward the closet and he pulled the second closer toward himself. As Harry popped the lid off he found a thick stack of moving pictures. Many of them were of Malfoy at Hogwarts. Malfoy playing quidditch, Malfoy with an
A rage Harry had never felt before surged through him, and Harry wanted to hurt Malfoy as bad as Harry had ever hurt. He held Malfoy’s collar so tightly that his hands began to ache, and his lips met Malfoy’s, hard. Harry had gone mad, that much was obvious to him.
The bathroom had marble counter tops and dark cupboards, similar to the kitchen in colour scheme. Malfoy’s shower was massive. It had a waterfall showerhead and the walls looked like stone, giving the appearance of the outdoors. The things Malfoy asked Harry to get were on the countertop. His toothbrush, hairbrush, hair product, and a toiletry bag half full of eyeliner, concealer, and blush. Harry also grabbed Malfoys razor and shampoo from the shower, and then set off to find a bag.
Harry chuckled, piercing a leaf of lettuce with his plastic fork. “That will be nice. I haven’t been there since-”
“I’m sorry I-” Harry began. Malfoy looked at him pointedly. “I didn’t mean to-” He huffed. “I wasn’t going to- Agh!” Harry cried, turning away from Malfoy. He practically ran for the stairs, passing Kreacher on the landing, who was carrying a tray full of chicken, and potatoes, and corn to the drawing room.
“No need to look so worried, Potter. I only just got up.” Malfoy drawled, leaning his body casually against the railing. The railing gave an awful groan against the weight and Malfoy propped himself up by his crutches at lightning speed, looking alarmed.
