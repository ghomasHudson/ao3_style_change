"So I suppose you don't mind that Miss Fields keeps asking you out as well?" Harry shot back, referring to the eighteen year old witch who had started working at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes seven months ago, together with the twins and Ron.
"Hm? Just that I'm liking my chances with you more and more if you're already thinking about our second date," the blond man smirked; his eyes gleaming.
"I don't need her sticking up for me," Malfoy muttered darkly. "I can handle myself just fine."
"Again, not much that he can do about it," the blond wizard replied lightly. "On top of that I'm an adult as well, so he can hardly ground me for courting his former enemy."
"You're really going to ask me that?" Malfoy asked sceptically. "Are you serious? We're going for small talk?"
"I need to stretch my wings sometimes and a week ago I happened to spot them when flying above the forest," Draco answered; his wings not making any sound even though they were still flapping forcefully, keeping them suspended in the air. "I thought you might like having a look at them without risking scaring them off."
sincere when he tells you you're his mate."
worse than outright rejecting him. If you want to try, you have to try because you want to, not because you feel forced."
AN2: I swear I'm going to try to update quicker next time *winces* I hope I still have readers for this.
Malfoy hovered next to him, his face a mixture of frustration and amusement. His blond hair was no longer neatly combed back, instead mussed and in disarray from the wind playing with it and Harry had the ridiculous thought that he looked far more handsome like this than with his hair slicked back.
"Yes, the mate bond between you two allows '
Harry rolled his shoulders and sighed. "Yes well, I might not like the man, but he's still your father."
Instead of spitting at the accusations, Malfoy grew oddly pensive, sitting so motionlessly on his broom that for a moment Harry wondered whether he'd somehow become frozen. He looked around him just to be certain, but there was nobody else but them here, so that ruled out a hex being cast.
"That
Again my apologies for taking so long with this chapter! I will do my best to have the next one out sooner!
"I … wouldn't be opposed to trying it out," Malfoy said slowly. "I'm still in control of the Veela; it can't let me choose anyone I don't want. It could have chosen someone way worse than you as my mate."
"I don't think it can be anything dangerous," she said hesitatingly, worrying her lip between her teeth. "I would assume the headmistress would have noticed something wrong by now if he was some kind of dangerous creature."
While that thought was amusing on its own, he knew he would get tired pretty quickly if Malfoy just gave in and did whatever Harry wanted him to do. That wasn't how they worked. They pushed and pulled and needled just enough to get underneath each other's skin without ever crossing the line to the point of no return. They had come close several times to crossing that particular line, that was true, but they had always steered away from it just in time.
So honestly, Ron had had it coming. It wasn't like he would be in that much trouble, anyway, given that Hermione knew about Fields' persistence.
us away from our mate."
One moment they stood next to each other, some space between them as they let their bodies cool down. The next Harry found himself pressing Draco against the wall and their mouths connected for the first time. The touch, innocent at first before it deepened in pressure, sent shivers down his spine, made his lips tingle and his hands clutched into Draco's robes, kissing him again and again until all the air had left their lungs and they were forced to part or faint.
It said a lot about his life, Harry figured when he hugged her, that his friend didn't say something like that in jest.
"So you're sparing me for now?" Harry questioned amused.
Melissa
"I'm not worried about me, but you," Harry corrected him and stood up. "Do you think he's going to give you trouble because you chose me?"
Harry quirked an eyebrow and couldn't help but sceptically ask, "You can cook?"
She was still dressed in her official Ministry robes, meaning she had arrived home fairly recently and had probably been on her way to change into more comfortable clothes.
"Well, it's either that or I delight you with the tales of my six year old godson who recently has decided that he wants to become a Quidditch player. Or with the tales about Ron working at his brothers' joke shop," Harry droned. "It's up to you, really, but I figured you would rather talk about yourself."
"There's nothing depressing about green or silver," Draco insisted. "It's better than bright red and golden."
"Well … She knows I'm courting someone," Draco admitted begrudgingly. "Just not who yet."
"Don't know why you're bothered about that when you know full well you'll be able to break through it anyway," Malfoy sighed.

Warnings: Honestly, just fluff. Dates; some bantering
Feigning a dive to throw off Malfoy of the Snitch's course, hearing him curse violently. Slapping a hand away, just to be the one to catch the Snitch first …
"So you don't know a lot about them," Malfoy surmised and nodded almost absently, as if he had been expecting that.
"I'm not the one who hasn't touched a broom in years, Potter," Malfoy smirked. "Maybe I should give you a head start of half an hour, just so you can get used to a broom again. To even out the playing field."
"Someone of the Gryffindor Quidditch team asked me whether I couldn't join their training tonight, to show their Seeker some moves," he started.
as you called it," Draco replied amused. "I thought you'd like this kind of setting more."
"You don't know until you try," she insisted. "I thought you said he'd become more civil to you?"
"Maybe that's not so much your odd luck, as your stubbornness," Malfoy remarked dryly.
"Yes, I figured you'd appreciate a picnic more than a
"Does your mother know about us?" Harry asked curiously, realising that this was the first time they were actually discussing Draco's parents. He hadn't thought about Narcissa and Lucius in years, but with Draco courting him there would come a day when he would meet those two again. Wouldn't that be an interesting experience?
"Do you think you could ever meet him? In a more official manner, that is."
In that case the presence of the two daffodils made everything only more intriguing, because why sent two of those but only one of the other two?
A carnation, a daffodil and now a chrysanthemum. The third flower had him becoming even more intrigued, because there had to be some kind of pattern or meaning behind these flowers, but what was it? What was the link between all three of them?
"Yes, keyword being
AN2: Dinner with the inlaws next chapter, guys, who's excited for that? (Only Narcissa probably LMAO)
Thanks to Draco, Harry was one of these lucky few now.
Draco sighed and rolled his shoulders, staring contemplatively at the empty tea cup Mrs. Malfoy had left behind on the table. His wings twitched faintly, catching the light of the flames in the hearth whenever they moved.
The dragon paused, appeared to eye him carefully before he slithered out of his frame, vanishing from view.
"I'm still amazed that the Slytherins aren't giving you more trouble," Draco remarked, sipping from his wine. "Especially because you have them together with the Gryffindors, right?"
He paused and considered it. "Not at the moment, I think."
His, what he thought to be, rather alarming comment was met by decidedly unimpressed brown eyes.
"But we don't know each other that well – or at least not in a positive way," he quickly amended, because years of rivalry had taught him a fair bit about Draco as a person. "Does that mean that he won't be able to, well, sense my feelings at the start?"
Harry wrinkled his nose, chugging down some of his own Butterbeer. "That sounds so juvenile when you say it," he muttered, scowling. "I knew I shouldn't have told you about the dinner."
good. If you '
What was he supposed to say? If Draco hadn't told his parents yet that he was dating Harry, then there was probably a reason for that, no? Well, he could think of one reason already: Lucius. The older man would probably not be that excited to hear that his only son had started dating his former enemy. Even worse: that the former enemy turned out to be his son's mate.
Harry couldn't blame Hermione for sounding so sceptical. The last thing he had expected was to see his old school rival show up in Hogwarts again to teach Potions of all things.
"I'm not going to lie and say he's going to be overjoyed," he finally said. "But it's been years since the war and he knows how serious a mate is for a Veela. He won't make things difficult for us, if only because that would get him on mother's bad side."
"Erm, if you're looking for your son, his quarters are in the dungeons," was the only thing Harry could think of to say.
Shaking his head, he flipped through the pages until he found the part about the chrysanthemum. This list of colours was a tad more extensive, considering how many difficult colours the flower could have.
"Call me Draco," Malfoy said abruptly.
It was a stupid thing to say because obviously she would know that she wouldn't be able to find Draco on his floor, but the sight of her stumped him so much that his brain had a hard time functioning decently. What was she doing here? Why had she tracked him down? Because clearly she hadn't just knocked on a random portrait; she knew these were his quarters. He just couldn't fantom why she was here, though. He hadn't talked to her since the trials had ended and Draco hadn't mentioned her stopping by for a visit.
He rushed to the bed, eager to get inside of it as quickly as possible. Not that he was particularly excited about going to sleep, but going to bed meant that grandmother would tell him a story and she'd promised to tell him his favourite if he finished his plate tonight, which he did!
"It's not garnish, it's a warm colour. Just because Slytherin decided to deck out his dormitories in depressing dark colours," Harry scoffed and rolled his eyes.
Draco kissed him before Harry could even think of a reply to that. As wings descended around them, curling around him and pulling him closer to the Veela, hands coming up to frame his face so they could keep kissing each other, Harry decided that he was more than okay with taking advantage of their private time.
"Don't mind Ron, he's being an idiot," Hermione soothed, ignoring Ron's noise of offense. Curling up a leg underneath her on the couch, she went on concerned, "You think you're going to be fine next Saturday? With Lucius being there as well, I mean."
"Not a problem, Harry, students always have priority," McGonagall said briskly and waved at him to come closer.
"Malfoy is now teaching Potions?"
He hadn't expected the Veela to do anything with regards to his family at all, given that they were all dead by now, but the gesture was sweet even while wholly unexpected.
"Draco?" he said surprised when the portrait opened to reveal a harried looking Veela.
He would figure out what this collection of flowers meant, even if he had to channel Hermione and stay at the library for hours.
He'd protested about that at first, because he didn't know the Greengrass' at all and he was frankly not looking forward to being bombarded with questions of several Pureblood wizards and witches, but Draco had been quick to assuage his worries. It was a masked ball, he'd explained, showing off two masks, so nobody would have to know that the both of them were attending the party.
The second Harry arrived back in his quarters, he went straight to his desk to write a letter to Fleur. It wasn't a long one, merely a request to speak to him because he had some questions about the Veela heritage, but it would be enough. He wasn't that close to her, but he thought she would be willing to answer his questions to the best of her abilities.
"And let him think he won? Yeah, right," he snorted and shook his head.
"You want to fly against me," Harry repeated sceptically. "That eager to get your arse kicked again, Malfoy?"
At exactly nine o'clock, though, footsteps echoed in the corridor and Malfoy appeared in the doorway, resting his hand against the doorjamb. He smiled wryly upon seeing Harry at the desk and took a couple of steps forwards.
(See the end of the chapter for
"There's no way a spell to give you wings would last so short," Harry instantly denied.
It could be that Malfoy was simply lying about Fleur having wings too, but why bother lying about that when it would be so easy to find out the truth? He had nothing to gain with it, knowing how close Harry was to the Weasley family and in turn to Fleur.
"The only reason I could think of why he is so reluctant to confess would be if he assumed we wouldn't be happy with this choice. Let's say because we have not such a good history with this person," she said meaningfully.
Warily, Harry cast several spells over it, even some which leaned closely to being dark, but none of them revealed any hidden traps or curses attached to the stone. Suspicion not exactly decreased yet, he cautiously picked it up and rested it in the middle of his palm. The stone felt smooth but cold and he traced the ridges resembling the wing cut into it. He could only think of one person who might have given him this stone, but that didn't answer his questions about how the stone had got through his wards in the first place.
Black eyes narrowed suspiciously. "Why, what's there?"
"Potter, you'll be thankful for that reprieve once you meet her, I promise."
The sun was on its way down, casting orange and red and purple rays across the forest and Hagrid's home. It wasn't raining but there was a bit of a chilly breeze and Harry was glad he had remembered to take his cloak with him. Sure, Warming spells existed, but they were somewhat of a pain because they only lasted for so long.
"Yes, just like a bird's wing, that's true," Harry agreed and the six year old boy grinned, dropping the stone in his godfather's hand before hurrying back to the couch where he had been drawing a picture.
Well, as long as Draco wouldn't literally be able to sense his feelings … He supposed it would be more like couples knowing each other so well that they could guess how the other one was feeling.
"I'm surprised you actually showed up," Malfoy remarked almost casually; his sharp grey eyes flitting briefly to the stands, where the students were almost leaning over the railing to catch a better look at them.
"My mother taught me," Draco explained to his surprise. "She always said that cooking is a great way to empty one's mind, because it doesn't require the strict focus that comes with preparing potions. I spent a lot of time with her when I was younger and sometimes she would teach me how to prepare certain dishes." He cleared his throat then and glanced away; his cheeks becoming suspiciously pinkish.
She crossed her left leg over her right, clasping her hands across her knee. "He would only be this reluctant if he thought we would disapprove of his choice. Coupled with the fact that he hasn't talked about you at all … It doesn't take much to put two and two together, Mister Potter."
"No, he sounded very genuine," Harry said thoughtfully and took a sip from his coffee.
Warnings: A mother who knows; one does not simply try to fool Narcissa Malfoy
It really didn't matter.
"So are you a kiss on the first date type of bloke?" Draco asked teasingly; his bravado back now that Harry wasn't rejecting the idea of more dates.
"Oh? Maybe you should ask him to confirm your suspicion then? I don't see how I can be of help here, Mrs. Malfoy."
They both turned around to face her, watching intently how she procured the box with the golden ball in it. She fiddled with the lock and flicked the lid open, revealing the Snitch. Its golden colour gleamed in the setting sunlight and its wings fluttered weakly for a couple of seconds before it realised it was free and it shot out of the box, high into the air.
"Sure," Harry said noncommittally and decided to change the subject then. "So, how are you settling in?"
Instead of getting irritated at the rebuttal as he had expected, she smiled. "If you're not the one he's courting, why did you call him by his first name then? Why do you have the strange assortment of flowers in that vase? That aventurine stone shaped in the form of a wing does look rather out of place next to those pictures, don't you think?" She nodded at the picture frames displayed above the fireplace. The stone in question was placed in front of his parents' wedding photo.
I hope to see you all back in the next chapter! Please stay safe and take care of yourselves!
"But you can't go wrong with a sweater and trousers, right?" he muttered, furrowing his eyebrows.
Author's note: Many, many apologies for again leaving you all hanging for so long *winces* That wasn't my intention at all! I kicked my butt into gear finally to finish this chapter; I hope it won't disappoint *grimaces*
Well, he thought so at least. He would need to do some research on that, maybe even Owl Fleur and see if she was willing to tell him about Veela and their ways of choosing mates. Would that be considered too private? Whatever, if it was, she would just refuse to answer and that would be it.
"How was he even going to try to flood the place?" Harry asked mystified. There weren't any toilets except for the dorm area, so what had been his plan?
And that was all he said before he flew down, dismounted his broom and disappeared into the castle again.
"Rest assured, Harry, I wasn't about to enter these woods without my wand," Draco said dryly and spun said wand a couple of times between his fingers.
AN2: I took some liberties with flowers for the birth months of Narcissa and Lucius, seeing as I couldn't find their actual birthday. I hope it wasn't too awful! I'm now off to bed because it's already nearly three in the morning here and I'm so going to regret this when I wake up. (Do not follow my example, you will regret it)
"Or what? You're going to talk to them?" Malfoy sneered.
"What is this, Uncle Harry?" Teddy's high voice inquired and when Harry looked away from the chocolate milk he was preparing, he saw that his godson had somehow managed to get his hands on the aventurine stone.
true, yes," she confirmed and her hand briefly appeared to stroke some strands of hair out of her face. "Only our mate
It had always been more than that between them, Harry reflected, even when they still had been rivals and more likely to punch each other than to have a conversation. They might have hated each other when they were kids, but at the same time they had always been aware of each other.
"You can see them?" Malfoy asked oddly, right when Harry was about to ask if he was okay.
Concealing a sigh and ignoring some of the flirty smiles thrown his way, Harry made his way to the big table and promptly sat down next to Malfoy, who startled visibly.
Malfoy in the meantime didn't look at them even once, and merely sat there, stiffly eating his food. Somehow Harry had the feeling this particular seating arrangement had quickly become a common occurrence during mealtimes.
He swallowed a hysterical chuckle back just in time.
Harry nodded thoughtfully. "Would you be able to find another mate?"
"If you drop me I will hex you," Harry promised, but stood up; a spark of excitement growing in the pit of his belly even if he was still feeling a tad apprehensive.
She ignored him and went on, "I started thinking about reasons why my son wouldn't want to confide in us yet who his mate is. After all, with how important a mate is, he's just delaying the inevitable at this point."
Andromeda was meeting up with some old friends and had asked Harry whether he would mind looking after Teddy for the day. It being Saturday, Harry didn't mind and he had agreed immediately. It had been a while since he had been able to spend some time with his godson after all.
All the same, he knew he would have only two hours at most before she would kick him out, because professor or not, the library's closing hour was a closing hour for everyone and she adhered to that strictly.
"Any time, Harry," she said softly and hugged him back. "We'll figure it out, like we always do."
"But true, no?"
He pushed himself off the ground immediately after that, grinning when Malfoy shouted in protest. He halted several feet in the air and looked down at the blond, his grin widening.
"She enjoys it a lot actually," Draco said and turned to look at him again. "She said it was a better alternative to hexing her sisters when they annoyed her."
"Thanks for bringing me here," Harry said softly, looking at the fountain still clattering cheerfully even with winter approaching.
I hope you'll like it!
"Yeah, we will," he agreed, letting her familiar scent soothe him. He'd been tense the entire day after that weird encounter with Malfoy and only here, at his friends' place could he feel himself relax completely.
. I cannot promise a '
So if Malfoy was potentially doing something evil, it didn't involve the students, which was good of course. Any evil doings didn't occur at Hogwarts either, because after the less than stellar professors they had had in the past, McGonagall had installed new wards; ones that would alarm her immediately if any form of dark magic was used on the premises. It was the reason why Harry made sure to warn her each time he was planning on showing dark spells to his students so that she wouldn't grow alarmed and order the castle to encase his feet in stone.
"Ah, but who says you'll call me by my first name if I do answer your question? You're just as sneaky as a Slytherin,
Thank you for the comments and the kudos!
They were quiet then, listening to the muffled noise of the music playing inside.
"And not because you're trying to avoid some of the more enthusiastic students?" She raised an eyebrow.
"There isn't," she agreed, curling her hands around her mug. "Even so, why does it bother you so much? So Malfoy apparently had wings for a couple of seconds; that doesn't seem so dangerous to me."
"Eh, I had some help," Harry said dismissively and waved his hand haphazardly through the air. "Either way there's a clear distinction between knowing how to make potions and knowing how to cook edible food. I know the Malfoys have house elves, so where did you learn to cook?"
"I'm flattered to hear that you're still keeping track of my birthdays," Harry smirked.
"I seem to recall he did invite Death Eaters into the school that one time," Ron reminded him finely, scowling at him.
Pushing the door open, he stepped inside, saying, "You called me? I came as fast as I could, but I had a student who - "
, and as such I won't tolerate any arguing between the two of you, understood?"
If they remained together, of course.
"Never thought I would see you willingly in red," he added cheekily.
The dark haired man had to stave off the urge to turn his head and do something as ridiculous as lick or bite the finger. That might lead to things they shouldn't do.
As soon as he opened the window, she hopped off her wooden stand, spread her wings and flew into the night sky, rising higher and higher until she was nothing but a dark speck against the half full moon. He watched her until he no longer could see her and only then closed the window.
"Not if it potentially leads to something bad happening," Harry retorted clipped. "You're deflecting now. Start talking."
Hopefully he would be a bit more forthcoming with replies than he had been yesterday.
"My dear, there will always be some daring individuals, but truthfully, in my personal experience they're getting along much better nowadays," Flitwick said cheerfully.
"I know. I was just wondering … He told me that only mates can see a Veela's wings. Is that true?" He still had a bit of a hard time believing that nobody could see those giant wings, but then again if they could, why had nobody else remarked on it during that time on the Quidditch Pitch?
"Come off it." Harry rolled his eyes, but couldn't help but smile. "So, what do they mean?"
Knocking on his portrait sent him stumbling out of his bed two days later, on Sunday morning, and as he rubbed his eyes, still tired, he called out, "Yes, yes, I'm coming!"
Warnings: Hm, nothing in particular I think? Maybe some mystery
"I don't know, big, I guess. Silver whitish, I think? I only saw them for a couple of seconds just like last week," he answered cautiously.
"No, didn't pay much attention to that because directly afterwards the Snitch slammed into my chest."
It wasn't signed, but it didn't take a genius to know that this note had been sent by Draco. Harry thought it was safe to assume that there wouldn't be any other flowers forthcoming – for now at least – because why else sent a note now? The Veela hadn't done so with the previous three, so him sending a note now had to mean that Harry wouldn't have to expect duplicates of the others, right?
really hard to explain, because it
"You want something in return for not being a controlling prick?" Harry asked sceptically.
"How come you decided to teach instead of becoming an Auror? I remember the newspapers were full with speculations about when you would start your training."
"No, you tell it the best," he said stubbornly.
"Good afternoon, '
"I've had worse surprises," Harry smiled wryly. "You think it's going to be okay? With your father, I mean."

"Which story do you want to hear, my prince?" she asked, settling down next to his legs on the bed. Her wand was put on the nightstand after she used it to tie her long blonde hair together in a braid.
," he said mockingly and walked away, ignoring the curious looks several students favoured him with.
"You haven't, no. But ask her husband and you'll get a different answer," Malfoy replied. "He'll have seen them before. Often even."
Stretching his arms, he debated for a short moment whether he should pick up a book before shaking his head and going straight to his bedroom. It might not be that late yet, but he needed to be fully rested for the conversation with his friends tomorrow.
Melissa
Was he missing something still? He didn't really think so. The meanings sort of added up, one more than the other, and he wanted to get up and tell Draco he had solved the mystery, but something held him back.
"Interesting, very interesting," Malfoy murmured and this time he flew so close, their knees bumped against each other. The corners of his mouth unfurled slowly in a smirk and when he spoke next, his voice acquired a strange breathy tone. "Things just got a hell of a lot more interesting, Potter."
"You're on," Harry grinned and flew up, aiming for the last place he'd spotted the Snitch.
"What are you – Merlin!" Harry jumped, slamming his ankle into one of the legs of his desk. Pain instantly shot up through his leg, but he ignored it, his eyes fixed on the pure white wings which had suddenly appeared behind Malfoy.
If the only recommendation was not to dress up too formal, then this was what Draco was going to get. There were only so many times he could keep changing outfits before he would get too worked up.
The other man inclined his head. "Maybe you should have gone for an Auror career after all; you definitely have a knack for sniffing out mysteries."
"I think we both know very well I never back down, Harry."
"Yeah, I guess so," Ron sighed explosively and twisted his hand around to clasp their hands together, running his other one through his hair. "And Harry did turn out to be right about Malfoy in our sixth year, so if you say you trust him enough to try out …
"My brother watched every match of yours when he attended here and he said not even professional Quidditch players are as good as you," Wright said excitedly. "So please, professor? You don't have to stay for long, just show us some moves that Elisa can use to win!"
"Speak for yourself," Sprout groused, hiding her grimace behind a large cup of coffee. "I've got a double dosage of Slytherins and Gryffindors together this morning; not even the best of sleeps can conquer that!"
Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling owns it.
"Oh, I don't need half an hour to wipe the floor with you, Malfoy," Harry shot back. "You, on the other hand, might need the warming up."
"Probably curse because she didn't think of that herself," Harry chuckled, emptying his own glass.
"I don't know, regular ones?" He shrugged helplessly. "Like I said, they were gone in a flash, but I'm pretty sure I wasn't imagining them. For some reason he had wings for a moment."
She lifted an eyebrow. "If you can survive Voldemort, it would be quite embarrassing if you let yourself be done in by Malfoy of all people, don't you think so?"
Her head was floating in the fireplace and she watched with hawk like eyes how he pulled on his gloves before fishing out his Firebolt out of the closet.
I hope to see you all back in the next chapter! Please stay safe and take care of yourselves!
"So far the 'they're not so bad anymore' shtick," Harry muttered, rubbing a hand over his face.
Harry bristled, even though the comment hadn't necessary been meant as an insult. "Yeah, well, forgive me for not looking up the lore of every magical being in existence," he said sourly and crossed his arms. "If this is going to be some kind of weird Magical Creature exam, I'm going back to my quarters."
Harry shrugged lightly. "I'm tired of looking at assignments and while it pains me to admit, you're the only one who can give me a proper challenge. So what do you say? Fancy another round?"
"Don't be such a baby." Hermione clucked her tongue, before winking at Harry. "Feel free to divulge everything you want, Harry. Especially the courting part! I'd really like to know what he is planning!" Her eyes started to glitter with excitement; her studious part taking over once more.
"He can be creative somewhere else then," the blond said dismissively.
"Harry, seriously, you called me down for this? I'm sure you're just imaging things," she said, rubbing over her eyes.

knowing each other so well that you can read each other immediately."
Figuring the least he could do was prepare tea now that he was bugging his friend again, Harry moved to the kitchen and set about preparing the first tea he found, which turned out to be Earl Grey. Not exactly his favourite, but it would have to do. He didn't think he would be drinking much tea anyways.
Author's note: Many apologies for the late update. I had wanted to finish it sooner, but I had problems with finishing a chapter of another story and I had to get in the right mindset for this one (as this is fairly light-hearted compared to the other projects I'm working on). Again, many apologies for the delay, I didn't mean to have you waiting so long *winces*
"She seems nice," Harry said cautiously.
"What the fuck did you do, Malfoy?" Harry growled, seriously growing pissed now. What the hell was going on here? Why was Malfoy refusing to answer his questions and just what the fuck had he been doing with his eyes?
He tensed up when Malfoy leant forwards and a strange metallic sheen seemed to slid right across his eyes, intensifying the grey colour of them. At once all sound became muted as if Harry was dunked into water. "And what if that's the case, hm?" Malfoy murmured; a strange lilt in his voice, almost like a croon.
"After a series of interviews, I have decided that Mister Malfoy is the perfect candidate to take up the position of Potions Professor," she announced, linking her hands together on top of some parchment.
"Okay, yes, but we all did horrible things during the war," Harry said and furrowed his eyebrows. "Look, I'm not saying you have to start liking him now. Hell, for all I know, this might not even work out between us anyways. But I'm still going to try and make it work and I would appreciate it if you supported me at least."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm not immediately a fan of Malfoy, but I know we can trust Harry to know what he's doing," she said quietly and rested her hand on top of Ron's on the table. "If he wants to try this, we should support him. He's always been a good judge of character, no?"
The third flower appeared on his desk during a break between two classes. It was a pink chrysanthemum; the colour delicate and perfect, not a single blemish in sight. One minute he had been going over his notes for the next class, the next sparkles in the corner of his eye had attracted his attention and the flower had shown up seemingly out of thin air.
Madam Pince barely looked up when he strode past her desk. While she might watch students like a hawk whenever they dared to touch one of her precious books, she was more lenient towards professors, most likely assuming that adults would know better than to defile a book.
"Eugh, no, thanks," Ron shuddered. "The less I know about him and you, the better off I will be!"
When Harry went to bed later that evening, a single larkspur was awaiting him on his pillow. He grinned and added it to the vase with the others.
"Wouldn't be the first time that happened to me," Harry told him, but followed him regardless, because even with all the experience he had, he still didn't enjoy being the subject of gossip.
He didn't even understand why they had to meet at his classroom specifically until he came across Sprout doing her rounds and he realised that the hallway where his classroom was, was the one not listed in the rounds tonight. With how big the castle was, there was no way to cover all the corridors and hallways and hidden passages with two professors, so depending on the night, certain hallways weren't patrolled. The schedule was changed every week so that the students wouldn't manage to sneak around.
Master classes will start for me next week, but I will do my best to keep the delays to an absolute minimum! No matter what this story will get updated - if I didn't lose all my readers at least ^^;
The door to Malfoy's quarters bore a simple but elegant dragon, who stood on his hindlegs the second Harry appeared in sight. Malfoy's private rooms were deeper in the dungeons than Snape's had been, but the dark haired man assumed it was a matter of privacy. Most students would probably think twice before making the long trek to complain to their professor about something inane.
As Harry stood there, quite perplexed, the house elf bowed and lowered the tray on the table. "Plinky is bringing Master Harry Potter and Master Harry Potter's godson some sweets."
"I need you to take this letter to Fleur and wait for her reply," he told her and she hooted again in confirmation, holding out her leg so that he could tie the letter around it.
"Oh, haven't you heard? Hagrid managed to tame them. Now they only react violently when they're startled – like most animals," Harry remarked innocently.
Harry offered him a grin full of teeth. "A casual reminder that I fought worse people than them helps keeping them in line."
quite a surprise, I'm not going to lie," she admitted. "I didn't expect Mister Malfoy to be a Veela too."
"Don't think that means I'll be dancing every week with you," Harry warned him, but he couldn't help but grin, still feeling incredibly exhilarated from the dancing they had been doing. "This party is a lot more fun than I thought it would be."
He took a deep breath and started explaining, "Malfoy agreed to another Quidditch game with me last night and there I saw again that he had wings. This time they weren't visible for long either, but they were there, and he didn't deny them when I called him out on them."
Green eyes blinked slowly. "You can actually fly with those wings?" he asked dumbly.
Harry heard him, though, and he obeyed, looking beneath him. His mouth parted in shock when he realised he was looking at a herd of unicorns meandering around a large open field. Some were already lying down on the ground, preparing to go to sleep, but there were also a couple of young unicorns running about, chasing after each other and neighing happily. Their pure white coat shone so brightly, it seemed to chase away the darkness around them.
, I mean."
He was going to have to be more careful around the boy if he didn't want him hurting himself accidentally by summoning the wrong thing.
"Wooing isn't restricted to genders, you git." Malfoy rolled his eyes again. "Fine, if that word offends your sensibilities, then we can call it dating. We're going to date and I'm going to show you that I'm the best choice you'll ever get."
"We're supposed to be courting each other, which means knowing what kind of situations make the other one uncomfortable," Draco said and shrugged. "There's no point in having our first date at a place where you wouldn't be able to relax fully."
okay, I don't mind!" she exclaimed. "It
"And why am I supposed to know anything about it?" Malfoy smirked. "I appreciate that you think I'm all knowing, but - "
The book was rather blunt in its descriptions, which Harry appreciated even when it left him with his cheeks slightly burning as he read the section underneath
"Yeah well, he can try. I can make his life a living hell as well if he thinks he can try to pull shit," Harry said dismissively. He would be civil to Lucius because he was Draco's father, but he also wouldn't be a doormat and let the older man walk all over him.
Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling owns it.
"Yes, I will. The reason why I called you here is because I'm very much aware of the past you two share," she said and raised an eyebrow. "With that in mind, I want the both of you to remember that you're adults now,
"Like I would do that." Draco rolled his eyes and rose up as well.
I also apologise for the rather short length, but I really wanted to give you guys something after so many weeks of not updating ... I hope you can forgive me. If I don't have any readers for this one left, I'd understand :/ I feel awful for leaving you guys hanging for so long, especially after having received so many reviews for the previous chapter.
I hope you'll like this third part!
noise had Harry frowning and when he walked into the living room, he saw a house elf hovering near the table, carrying a tray with two pieces of treacle tart and some slices of chocolate cake of all things.
his wings, if you can
? They had disliked each other for years, had even fought on opposing sides in the war! How could he possibly be his mate then? Wouldn't it make more sense for Malfoy's mate to be someone of his own House or even just someone who belonged to the same circle? Surely, a mate should be someone the Veela had a lot in common with?
"Wings, you say," she said slowly and handed him a mug when she was finished. "What kind of wings?"
"Erm, thanks, but I didn't ask for anything," Harry said tentatively.
"I don't know," he said slowly and licked his lips. "I didn't see him pulling his wand and those changes … they looked almost natural, like he's used to doing them. Like … I know it's going to sound stupid, but it looked like it's just part of him, not the result of a spell or so."
"Knowing your foul luck, you'd end up at Saint Mungos on the first day," Draco drawled.
Mrs. Malfoy quirked an eyebrow. "If a certain son of mine acts petulant about telling me who his mate is, it falls on me to search out the mate in question. Really, Draco, you could have avoided this if you'd been honest from the start."
The other two students had been brought to Flitwick as they belonged to his House and judging by the look of his face, the usually jolly man was going to have some severe words with his students.
He opened the door, wondering just who the hell wanted to visit him this bloody early in the morning, and then froze when his brain registered who was in front of him.
"You don't look bad yourself, you know," Harry mentioned, eyeing him.
"Well, I suppose that's something," Harry muttered. Still, he wasn't quite looking forward to the dinner, he could already imagine how utterly awkward that was going to be.
Now it did, though, and he bit down on his finger to keep himself from laughing aloud. He guessed he could never claim that Draco couldn't be original. He now knew what to do.
"What the hell is the matter with you, Potter?" he snapped irritated, as the red ball they had enchanted to act like a Snitch flitted away, disappearing somewhere beneath the stands.
"Some of the time then?" Harry guessed, though that still didn't sound that appealing.
"Those poor students," Ron sighed and shook his head. "What was McGonagall thinking when she hired him?"
"Oh? What kind of question?"
"I saw it and I want to hold it, so I got it," Teddy answered rather blasé, which must mean that he had accidentally used his magic again to get his hand on the stone.
"You're a damn tease, Potter, and you will be sorry for that soon," Draco promised darkly, making Harry cackle.
He had tried to catch Malfoy unaware at random moments throughout the day, wanting to prove to himself that he hadn't gone mad and he had really seen those wings appear. Whenever he saw him, though, whether that was in the hallways, in the Great Hall, on his way to the dungeons, Malfoy appeared like a normal bloke, no mysterious addition of wings to be seen.
"I have no idea," Harry told her honestly and scratched his cheek, smiling sheepishly. "I haven't eaten in the Great Hall for the past week, because I was busy preparing my classes."
"Yes, we will. I know who it is, there's no reason for you to keep hiding him like he's your dirty secret," she admonished him sternly, making him flush slightly. "I will even do you the favour of informing your father so you won't have to do it. Next week, however, I will be seeing the
It was on the tip of his tongue to inform the blond that he hadn't had a partner since he'd broken up with Ginny, but Harry decided that that wasn't necessarily information that Mal-Draco needed to know.
"Brilliant, I'll see you there then," Harry said and turned around; fingers tightening around his broom, hyper aware of how slowly the door closed behind him.
Please leave your thoughts behind in a review; should you spot any mistakes, please point them out to me.
"How daddy and papa fell in love!" he instantly demanded, wriggling under the covers until he found a comfortable position to lie in.
"Hold up, what do you mean, the Veela can sense their mate's feelings?" he asked, a tad alarmed. "You mean he's going to constantly know how I feel?" He wasn't sure whether he really liked that idea, of Draco constantly knowing how he felt, what he felt.
"So, you're a kissing on the third date kind of bloke, huh?" Draco murmured breathlessly; his pupils considerably wider as his fingers dug into Harry's spine.
He raised an eyebrow at her. "No offense, 'Mione, but she's not infallible. Dumbledore also hired some really questionable people, like Lockhart. Remember him? Guy was that much of an idiot that he managed to curse himself with my broken wand!"
Harry's stomach swooped when Draco shot up in the air, his wings creating powerful blasts of wind which sent them straight up. In just a couple of seconds they were above the tree line, hovering above the leaf roof and Harry's mouth dropped open as he looked at the dark mass of the forest stretched out in front of them. Dozens of stars shone gently above them, surrounding a nearly full moon. When he turned his head, he could spot the many illuminated windows of Hogwarts, casting their warm yellow orange light over walls and roofs and the ground.
Malfoy was persistent, as he had shown in their sixth year. If anyone could figure out how to kill someone with wings that only appeared for a couple of seconds, it would be Malfoy.
"So, you did come," he remarked, halting a few feet away from Harry.
Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling owns it.
Resolutely ignoring the way his cheeks started to feel too warm, Harry cleared his throat. "So, where are you taking me for our first date?"
And a new mystery to solve.
Draco paused and turned to look at him with a faint smile. "Yes, it is. Unless you'd rather go somewhat else?"
When he woke up the next morning, he was greeted by a single, green aventurine stone on his pillow, cut into the shape of a wing.
"I'm a bit surprised you managed to deduce that, considering we never talked about restaurants before," Harry commented and sat down, crossing his legs.
Malfoy pursed his lips, but if he was offended by Harry's brusque tone, he didn't remark on it. Instead he asked, "Have you tried to figure out what's happening?"
What did Veela have to do with whatever was going on with Malfoy, though? Had he pissed off a Veela and now they had hexed him perhaps? That seemed unlikely, however, and where would be the sense in hexing someone to occasionally show wings? Malfoy hadn't been surprised either time when Harry had mentioned the wings or his eyes, so they couldn't be a result of a hex.
"I'm not the coach," Harry reminded him as he put the last stack of assignments in his bag.
They stretched out to the sides, spanning nearly three metres, and fanned out before they retreated slightly behind Malfoy; the tips of it looming over his head slightly. The eyes which looked at Harry were no longer a simple grey, but instead had a silvery sheen over them, which made them glitter oddly in the light.
"You thought right," Harry murmured, smiling.
"It's called being a good observer," Draco replied lightly, but it was more than that.
"Selene, you mind making a trip for me, girl?" he asked his owl.
"How are the other professors reacting to him? During mealtimes, I mean?" Hermione inquired curiously.
It was as Hermione had said: even if Malfoy had had those wings for a moment, it wasn't like it had done him any good, considering Harry had won three of the five matches. So it shouldn't matter at all. Let Malfoy cast all the weird spells he wanted, as long as he wasn't harming anyone with them.
"Well then, in that case," she gave in as she always did. Settling herself better on the bed, she started to tell the story. "The story starts when your daddy was working at Hogwarts and got called to the Headmistress' office …"
His thoughts must have been visible on his face because Draco smirked, his eyes turning hooded when he bent lower to Harry, murmuring, "So I'm more than okay with her knowing about us. Guess I should take advantage of any private time we'll get from now on, don't you think?"
He had almost forgotten just how
Ten minutes later saw the both of them curled up on the couch, two steaming mugs placed on the table in front of them.
"I take your word for it," Harry choked out, a tad overwhelmed at how close Draco suddenly stood. He could practically feel his body heat radiating through his clothes and he fought the insane desire to touch his chest and feel whether he really was that warm or whether he was just imagining things.
"And you didn't do that," she concluded, pulling her right leg up.
She smiled, definitely amused now. "But haven't you heard that story enough times by now? I'm sure you can remember everything of it. Don't you want to hear another story?"
It had been a detail he had overlooked time and time again when he had been browsing through the books. As it turned out, it was that small detail that created the link between the four flowers finally. Carnation was the flower of the month January – when his mother was born. Daffodil was March's flower – the same month in which his dad and Remus shared a birthday. Chrysanthemum was the flower of November; the same month his godfather had had his birthday in.
"Oh, that." Harry shrugged and started eating. "I've thought about becoming an Auror, that's true, but when the war ended, I found I was no longer interested in spending the rest of my life chasing dark wizards. One of them has been quite enough to last a lifetime, really. McGonagall mentioned that she was looking for someone to fill in the Defence Against the Dark Arts position and I figured I might as well give it a try. It hasn't been that bad, to be honest. At least here nobody tries to kill me on purpose," he added humorously.
Considering that Draco didn't have the best of experiences in the forest – not that Harry's were any better truthfully – it confused him as to why the blond would choose to make the woods their first date. He had expected to be brought to some kind of fancy restaurant or so, even if that sort of establishment had never been his kind of thing.
"Well, they look great on you," the blond countered immediately.
Author's note: My apologies for the delay; I didn't mean to have a delay of nearly three weeks, but it was a bit difficult finding myself in the right frame of mind for this particular story. Still not entire there, but I didn't want to make you wait any longer, so I did my best to finish this part today!
"They're probably going to have a collective fit about this," he mumbled, recalling how even now still, some of the professors weren't at ease around the Veela.
More than once Ron had complained to Harry that Fields wouldn't stop flirting with him, even when he'd clearly shown off his wedding ring and even after he'd kissed Hermione in front of her.
"I had some house elves prepare it," Draco replied, putting some of the meat on his plate. "They were all too happy to help out once I told him who they would be preparing it for." He smirked; the smirk widening when Harry clucked his tongue and slapped his knee lightly.
He hadn't flown on anything besides a broom, Buckbeak or those Thestrals, so he was pretty curious how it would be like to fly with a Veela.
. What were they, a bunch of animals?
She sighed gustily and leant back in her chair. "Look, Harry, you said it was gone in a flash; maybe something reflected in a window cast a shadow on his back and made it look like he had wings. Even if it's not a shadow, there's no reason to get bothered about this. It's not like he'll be able to kill anyone with wings that only appear for a couple of seconds."
"Of course they don't - " Harry sighed and cut himself off when the fire abruptly turned a golden red colour again, signalling she had closed down the Floo connection.
"You saw them last week as well?" There was definitely interest growing in those grey eyes, but for the life of him, Harry couldn't understand why.
"I've got a good memory, Malfoy," Harry said and swung his leg over his broom. "But it's good to see you grew up in that regard at least."
Harry raised an eyebrow. "You expected me not to come?"
While the match itself was quite amazing with both teams rather evenly matched, Harry found himself enjoying Draco's cutting commentary a hell of a lot more. His snarky comments had Harry in a laughing fit more than once and it was only by looking at the scoreboard that he could keep track of who was winning at which moment.
"I appreciate the vote of confidence," Malfoy drawled.
. It was the first flower he had received, so he thought it fitting if he looked up the meaning behind that one first.
Now he was even more confused. Leaning back, he stared at the page, studying the drawing of the chrysanthemum. So he had two flowers representing romance with colours similar to each other and one either presenting a new beginning or something like purity. Two had a link with each other, the third not so much. And why gift him two daffodils, but only one carnation and one chrysanthemum? Considering their meanings, he would have expected Draco to give him two carnations or two chrysanthemums instead.
partly because of our protective nature, you
"Crystal. I do want something in return, though."
It had been a while since he last had to solve a good mystery. Fortunately this time, it was a mystery he would enjoy solving as opposed to the previous ones, which usually had ended with him landing into trouble.
," Fleur greeted in her heavy French accent. She had forgone any makeup today, but it didn't make her any less beautiful, even when her face was slightly distorted by the flames.
"I'm going to woo you," Malfoy said and it was anyone's guess how he managed to say that with such a straight face.
"Don't word it like that," Malfoy said lightly. "Sometimes my eyes automatically change, depending on how I feel. That doesn't mean I'll be trying to enchant you again, just that my Veela is trying to impress you."
"So what, you just thought that it would be a good idea to put me under an enchantment? What if I wasn't your mate at all?" Harry asked outraged, realising that Malfoy had been testing him ever since he'd commented on the wings.
For just a brief moment, no longer than three seconds at most, Harry couldn't move as if he was stuck to the floor. Then his entire body started to rebel, every cell screaming in protest, and he lurched backwards, catching his footing just in time before he could trip.
"Me what?" Harry asked confused, because it wasn't as if he had only recently become a professor.

"Yes, well, after Hermione helped me show off some of my skills, they tend to reconsider pulling stupid shit in my classroom," Harry snorted, leaning back on his hands. When he looked up, he could see splashes of the night sky through the gaps in the leaf roof. Small glowing balls of white light floated around them, illuminating the blanket and them both.
"It's going to be fine," Hermione smiled reassuringly and squeezed his knee. "And if not, we're just one Patronus away from coming to your aid."
"I find most restaurants to be rather stiff," Harry admitted, watching how Draco lifted the charm so that they could sit down. "Though if you want to go to a restaurant, I wouldn't mind."
"Noted." Harry quirked an eyebrow. "Now, you didn't answer my question. Would you be able to find another mate if I rejected you or not?"

AN2: Yes, this story is getting more chapters, because clearly I like to screw myself over. What else is new, what else is new.
"And you?" Malfoy asked abruptly.
"I know," Harry said soothingly. "And besides, what can he really try to do to me at school?"
"That'd be nice, thank you," she agreed, looking around with interest.
"What do you have in mind?" Harry asked curiously and straightened up.
God damn it.
Please leave your thoughts behind in a review; should you spot any mistakes, please point them out to me.
Moving two books to the side for now, he opened the first one on the index page and traced the list down until he found
It was the same something nagging at him that he was missing something majorly, something that would actually tie all four flowers together and even explain why Draco had chosen two daffodils of all flowers to present twice. But what? What could he still be missing?
He loved hearing grandmother tell the story of how daddy and papa fell in love with each other, because it was one of the best stories he'd heard, even better than all the other fairy tales she often told him. He adored hearing how daddy started to like papa after years of disliking him and grandmother was so good at telling it! It was the best bedtime story he could hope for!
"Here's your tea," he announced, placing the cup in front of her on the table. He cradled his own and sat down on the armchair. "So, what kind of questions do you have? I'm not sure if I'll be able to answer them, though."
Harry never thought he would say this, but he actually enjoyed himself a lot at the party. It wasn't as stiff as he had feared it would be and everyone wore masks as Draco had said, ensuring that he could be just as anonymous as the blonde haired witch next to him. There was an abundance of delicious food and various types of alcoholic drinks, but Harry was too busy dancing with Draco to pay the tables against the walls any mind.
It was quiet for a while; Hermione's eyes flitting back and forth between the two men as she gnawed on her lower lip. She was the one to break the silence first.
"No, I just want you to myself for at least a little while before she hooks her claws into you," Draco answered dryly. "She can be a bit … overwhelming at times."
Grey eyes squinted slightly. "I seem to recall you basically excelling in it in our sixth year," Draco said suspiciously.
"Beautiful, aren't they?" Draco said; his lips barely moving.
"Okay." Harry took a bit to order his thoughts, curling his fingers around the edge of the desk. "Do
He might not be a spell expert like Flitwick, but he was pretty sure that any spells designed to give you animal attributes would last longer than the couple of seconds those wings had been attached to Malfoy's back. And even if he had used a spell – why not have done so earlier to avoid having to break a tie?
He didn't want anyone – aside from his friends, that was – to know that he and Draco had started dating each other, but most importantly: he wanted to be the one to solve the mystery. It was perhaps stupid, inane even, to insist on solving the mystery himself instead of keeping things easy, but this was something between him and Draco. The Veela was not telling the message behind these flowers on purpose, precisely because he knew how obsessed Harry could get with supposed mysteries. This was like a game between them and Harry didn't intend on losing it.
Grey eyes rolled. "Give me some credit, I'm not an idiot. I've seen the pictures of you in the newspaper when the Ministry threw those celebratory parties. Your photographic version was constantly trying to hide behind either a wall or a table."
Right as he was about to leave his quarters, a glistening in the corner of his eye caught his attention and he uttered a noise of surprise when a bright white daffodil of all flowers appeared on the table. Mystified he picked it up and stared at it for a bit. A carnation and a daffodil? Talk about a curious combination. Now he was becoming intrigued about the meanings behind them.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "It's literally a sweater and trousers; I'm sure you've seen nicer outfits," he snorted.
He nodded. "Yeah, it got straight through my wards. They didn't even raise any alarms."
"Crystal," Malfoy drawled, opening his mouth for the first time.
"Why don't you just go up to him and ask him about them?" Hermione asked exasperatedly.
"Yeah, you would like that, wouldn't you?" Harry grinned and stood close to Draco, wrapping his arms around his neck. This close he could pick up his scent and while he couldn't figure out what kind of scent it was, it was definitely not a foul smell and he found himself inhaling deeper before he realised it.
Harry nodded. "More than clear."
Silence descended over them after he'd finished. They stared at each other until the kettle whistled sharply, prompting his friend to get up and prepare some tea for the both of us.
And who would have thought he would one day enjoying dancing with somebody? Clearly dating Draco was opening him up to a lot of firsts in his life.
Well, he could hardly be worse than Treeling, really. At least Malfoy had always been good at Potions, something Harry had honestly doubted of Treeling.
Warily Harry accepted the letter and the house elf disappeared again, no longer remaining now that he had finished his task. When Harry opened the note – because calling it a letter was a bit too much – he could only stare at the content while Teddy softly whined to have a slice of the chocolate cake.
"I think so," Harry sighed and ran his fingers through his hair. "I mean, what is he going to do, curse me? Draco's not going to be happy with that and according to him, neither would his mum, so there isn't much Lucius can do."
"I don't think Minerva would like hearing you threaten me, Harry." Grey eyes – the metallic sheen completely gone now which just confirmed that the arsehole was in complete control over whatever shit he was pulling – narrowed slightly.
That was what Harry was banking on at least. He and Lucius were probably never going to be friends; too much had happened in the past between them for that. Lucius might as well even still hate him for fucking up his plans during Voldemort's reign. For all his faults, however, Lucius was also a man who cared deeply about his family. Harry couldn't see him doing something that had the potential of turning his own family against him.
"He might still be lying," Ron said, sounding a tad hopeful, ignoring Hermione's reproachful look.
"If it's out of pity, yes," Malfoy said curtly. "Otherwise, do whatever you want, Potter. When have you ever not done that?"
Even if they had looked rather large during the brief moment Harry had spotted them …
Draco rose up, having finished his breakfast, and winked. "Why don't you try to find out?" he smirked and his hand brushing over Harry's shoulder was fleeting, almost not tangible at all.
full autonomy over ourselves. But that does not mean that being rejected by our mate won't hurt us. It will hurt a lot, but we will survive."
"Come in!" McGonagall's – she would forever be McGonagall to him even when she insisted he could call her Minerva – rang out when he knocked on the door.
"Not living during a war will normally do that to you," McGonagall said dryly.
The dark haired man raised an eyebrow. "Depends. Is he still likely to curse me?"
"What else was I supposed to do, just leave her outside? That wouldn't have made for a good impression," Harry remarked amused. "And do I need to remind you that I can use all the good impression that I can get with your parents?"
"Arguing will be pretty hard to avoid, though," Harry couldn't help but point out. "Flitwick had an argument with Sprout just two days ago, remember?"
That earnt him a scornful scoff. "Of course I can. What, you thought they were only there for decoration?"
"You're quite annoying," Malfoy informed him after a short pause. "But yes, I've settled in as best as I can. Had to ward my private rooms to avoid Peeves from wreaking havoc in it."
"Better luck next time, Peeves," Harry said pleasantly, using his wand to clean up the mud from the wall.
The familiar
I hope to see you all back in the next chapter! Please stay safe and take care of yourselves!
Briefly he wondered whether he and Draco were obligated to inform McGonagall about this already, but well, they were only just starting to date, so was there any point to informing her about it already? For all they knew, they both would get on each other's nerves so much despite being mates, that they decided to call it quits. Best to wait until things between them were actually official before they informed the rest of the professors.
Well, that was completely different. He frowned, reading the passage again. Maybe the daffodil in this case was meant to represent the whole new beginning aspect? Peace seemed like an odd choice after Draco had selected a flower meaning love. But why sent two daffodils in the same colour even?
. We cannot joke about this. If you can
It didn't matter. There was no longer a war pitting them against each other, no longer a Dark Lord that Malfoy could be trying to please. They were colleagues and Malfoy was at least doing his best to be civil enough during the times they saw each other.
The thirty-first of October had the annual Halloween festivities taking place in the Great Hall as tradition stated. Instead of joining them again this year, however, Harry found himself whisked away to a ball being organised by the Greengrass' of all people.
"Another match?" Grey eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Where's this coming from? A week ago you were ready to refuse my challenge."
It was good to hear, however, that Draco really wouldn't die if Harry ended up rejecting him. The last thing he wanted, was for someone to die because of something he had said or done.
"He is your mate," she stated and rose up. "Your father will be reasonable about this."
"Well, I can't really help you with that," he smiled apologetically. "I wouldn't know why Draco doesn't want to tell you who it is. Maybe you should ask his friends? They might have an idea? It could be one of them; perhaps Parkinson? They were rather close during school from what I can remember."
"Like who?" Draco shrugged. "I think she's had a suspicion for a while now. Mother has always been rather sharp. She had probably prepared herself a while ago for the fact that you might be my mate."
"So you're okay with her knowing about us now?" Harry questioned and bit down on his lip. He could feel himself blush slightly when Draco pulled his lip free; grey eyes darkening a tad.
"I'll remind you of this conversation if he does end up doing something evil!" he called out to her retreating back.
"Some digging in old records," Harry retorted teasingly and Draco's smile widened just a tad.
Considering how many people lusted after Veela because of their beauty, it was logical that nature had come up with a fail-safe to ensure that nobody could try to trick a Veela into thinking they were their mate.
"He was trying to break one of the walls in the hopes of hitting a pipe."
Harry narrowed his eyes. "Considering you've been deflecting my questions since I first mentioned your wings, I think I have the right to be impatient when you're still avoiding answering me."
, very seriously. We do not joke about something as serious as
His comment was so unexpected that Harry physically reared back and stared at him incredulously. "I'm sorry, what?" he demanded once he found his voice back.
"Do you want some tea?" he offered awkwardly, hovering next to the small table while she sat down on the couch.
They might never be best friends, but they could be civil if Malfoy didn't decide to start acting like an arrogant prick again.
"I'm glad you think that highly of me," he grinned and winked. "I'm off, talk to you soon."
“Yeah... I cleared it at the office. I have the authority to take you out on my own now, being officially an Auror and all!” Harry gives Draco a friendly punch on the shoulder. “We're going out at 5pm. But before then, we need to go to the Wizengamot for the appeal hearing.”
Draco reaches across the table and squeezes Harry's hand, “Thank you for the compliment. I appreciate it.”
He isn't ready to put it out there yet. Subtlety has always been one of the distinctive traits of a Slytherin but he feels like he is out of practice at the moment. He doesn't mind it that much because his life cannot include deception in order to prove he has changed, and he doesn't feel so weak or helpless any more without it.
Draco puts on a show of patting his pockets and says in his most charming tone, “I'm very sorry, mate, but I seem to have forgotten my wallet at home tonight.”
Malfoy was finally alone in the bathroom. He took off his ragged clothes which he had been wearing for months now and got into the shower. Cleaning himself without magic was not new to him. He had learnt this while imprisoned. He still disliked it and would much rather use cleansing spells and potions but it would have been silly to provoke Potter and steal his wand just to clean himself up.
Draco is trying to fall asleep but he keeps replaying in his mind what just happened. Harry's arm was warm on his back. He would have liked to just lean on Harry's shoulder and give into a hug.
“Well, actually...” Harry says tentatively, “I wanted to go out and celebrate with some friends at the Hog's Head, for old time's sake...”
And they are still laughing and chatting loudly now thanks to the alcohol. Midnight is approaching and Hermione starts shuffling on her chair showing she's eager to go back home. And since she's in charge of Apparating everybody safely at their respective places, she'll be the last one to leave.
THANK YOU for reading! :)
I want to assure you that I will not inflict physical pain on you but we might go through situations where emotional and psychological pain might present. I apologise in advance for that, but please know it is necessary for your redemption or, at least, to prove to them that you're worth more than your Mark shows.” Harry's gaze drifted to Malfoy's left arm for a moment before continuing.
Draco's face lights up again “Am I allowed to go out??”
“No...” Draco replies cautiously.
“What are you saying, Mr Potter?”
“I'll just be a moment. I'm going downstairs to grab something for you to drink” Harry announces hoping to be paid attention to.
“Yes, there's a pot over there” Draco points to his left, where Harry is standing.
A moment later they're in the back alley near Harry's house and they walk silently up to his front door. Harry unlocks the door magically without using his wand and they get in.
“No, thanks. We've just popped in on our way to the Hog's Head. We're celebrating tonight and I'd like you to join us. Hagrid, Ron and Hermione will be there too.”
Harry was lost in his thoughts when Malfoy cleared his throat to remind him of his presence there.
And, hopefully, the rest of his life would be very short. He definitely could not endure it and he decided he was going to let himself wither away.
Draco finally exhales and tries to recompose himself.
Harry's moans are muffled but more intense and he can't help it but grab Draco's arse.
“Will they believe you?” Draco's voice now clearly shows how worried he is of what the consequences might be.
Luna realises her friend is tired so she tugs Harry's elbow to catch his attention. “I think Hermione wants to put the Moon frogs to bed.”
“I'm not going to tell them how much I know you now, don't worry.” Harry quickly clarifies, referencing to their newfound intimacy. “I just mean I know you thought I was distant lately, so you felt like you needed to catch my attention somehow and that's what you did.”
“You are dismissed.”
Malfoy raised his head quickly causing himself a jolt of pain in his neck. He could not believe his eyes—Harry Potter, the Saviour, was standing a few feet away from him in the well of the room.
He knows they're not going to fit as well as a tailor-made robe. But s
Harry and Draco's relationship is starting to shift. Please let me know what you think of it? :)
Harry feels weird about the way he has reacted to Draco dressed in stylish clothes. He looked like one of those Muggle models on advertisement. Thin neck, broad shoulders, lean arms and legs, round arse.
Harry is shocked at the woman's bluntness and fumbles to grab some change. “Here” Harry passes the money to Hannah quickly.
“I know, I'm ready” Draco responds trying to hide the fact that he's quite tense about it.
“What? I told you I would look stupid in Muggle clothes!” Draco stomps back angrily into the fitting room, misinterpreting Harry's reaction.
They're the only people out in the street and they walk silently for a couple of minutes and Draco falls behind. Harry asks him to keep up to no avail so he turns around, grabs Draco's arm and drags him under the light of a street lamp. “Look at me in the eyes” Harry commands standing one feet away from the other man.
Draco panics moving his hand away. He has been trying not to think about his own cock hardening in the process of undressing the object of his desire.
know. I'm not sure if
“No way, mate!” Draco slaps Harry's finger off his face.
He was brought there at some point in the day. It was hard for him to tell the hours since his cell had no windows, just like every other space in the underground level of the Ministry of Magic. Despite this, he thought it was nearing dusk.
Maybe what makes him upset the most isn't the fact that Draco went out on his own without permission, money, wand or common sense. Maybe he is angry with himself for not being there for Draco when he was in trouble. He says to himself that he cares about Draco as a friend, that's why he was so panicked and then cross and then worried.
“How do you mean?” Draco raises a brow and pretends not to pick up on her flirting.
“I don't remember much of last night... Did something happen on our way back here?” Harry is not letting this go.
Harry turns around and finds a hot coffee pot on the counter.
Harry parts his mouth from Draco's to take a breath and think about the consequences of the situation. Was he the one who said you should always think clearly before making a decision? But Harry doesn't have time to keep reasoning because Draco's hand holds his neck to close the short distance between their faces and they're kissing again.
Draco spends his days mostly reading or cooking some Muggle recipes. He has also started listening to the Muggle radio. He doesn't quite enjoy the music but the voices keep him company.
From the corner of his eye, Draco sees a hand sliding some paper money on the bar. “Here you go. All settled” a female voice speaks.
, Harry thinks willing the fluttering in his stomach to go away. He replies with a shy smile and a squeeze.
“I'm glad we did not take the Tube then” Draco comments in a worried tone. “Where are we going?”
Draco takes care of his shoes and cloak, then he makes Harry turn to face him and unbuttons his shirt struggling to get it off.
The Minister raised his hand to make everybody quiet down and said in a vexed tone, “Make you case... briefly.”
” Harry points up and down to his body before getting up and walking upstairs.
He could not hear much noise coming from upstairs when he walked the dimly lit corridor from the holding cells to the Wizengamot court room. As usual none of the Aurors spoke to him while they walked but he felt some kind of tension running among them, and concluded that it was time for his sentence.
Draco has been well aware of his developing feelings for the Boy Who Lived for a while now. At the beginning he wouldn't admit them but his mind would slowly bring him to day-dreaming about something more than just companionship and so he has come to accept them.
The following few days Harry goes to work to Aurors' Headquarters early in the morning and he comes back late in the evening, so he and Draco don't have much of a chance to spend some time together.
“Check mate. Aaand that's how you win a chess game! You didn't even see it coming.” Draco says with a grin.
“Thank you” Draco says trying to keep his voice steady and to hide the twirl of emotions inside him.
Still nothing.
A moment later they are back at home.
“I'm sorry too” Draco walks into the room to continue his apology in a low voice. “I thought you were laughing at me and I became angry but I couldn't curse you or leave you behind. I acted like an arse.”
Harry is taken aback. “How do you mean? I though you wanted to go down the path of recovery and reform with me...”
“I'm sorry for reacting that way. I appreciate the effort. Please make some kind of warning noise in the future... You can't be all stealthy on me like this. Shuffle your chair when you get up, for example. I know you were educated differently. But this is all about re-education, isn't it?” Harry explains trying to show that what he says is totally reasonable and strictly connected to the task at hand, not at all with the fact that he's been trying to avoid reading the signs that have been presenting to him in the past few weeks.
“C'mon Harry... a little help here. I can't take your shirt and your trousers off if you don't cooperate...” Draco complains out loud even if he isn't expecting any response from Harry.
As they walk down the main street he notices that many shops are open. The Three Broomsticks still looks warm and welcoming. Madam Malkin's still looks posh. Honeydukes is still bright and shiny. Nothing compares to Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, though. Harry goes into the shop following Harry and they take their cloaks off.
Harry stands up. “Thank you. It's very nice of you to apologise for being an arse but I know you can't help it.”
“So why won't you even look at me?” Harry insists.
As a result of his conflicting thoughts, Draco stirs on the bed and that wakes Harry up.
Draco stands up and opens his bedroom door to find Harry have a chat with him. He almost trips on the shopping bag on the floor. He thinks maybe his own apology will sound more sincere if he's wearing what Harry bought him. So he walks back into his room and gets changed into his new clothes.
He's laying face down on his bed and he's replaying in his head the look of shock on Harry's face in the shop. He felt so ashamed when Harry looked at him.
Harry smirks noticing how he sucked the energy out of him. “It's fine, you can just help me with this” and stops moving his hand to grab Draco's. He pulls the blonde's hand to his cock and starts pumping.
So that's that.
It's very likely that someone at the pub spiked Draco's drink. He wonders whether the woman is involved somehow or if it was just a coincidence that she paid for the beer. He doesn't understand why something like this would happen to Draco. Nobody had seen him before in the neighbourhood, he made sure of that. And nobody could know that Draco would decide to go out on his own tonight of all nights. He dismisses the thought that someone is watching them, because he has taken precautions against it since the first day of house-arrest.
“Ah... yes... Sorry, I was just taking a moment to collect my thoughts on how to go about with this.” Harry said in a resigned tone. Then he took a breath, looked at Malfoy straight in they eyes and started talking in a steadier voice. “Well, here it is:
“Harry...” Draco's head pops into the living room.
There's a possibility that he's going mental from trying to live like a Muggle. He made the choice to actually give it a try after a couple of months of relentless efforts on Harry's part at the beginning of his house-arrest. He noticed how Harry was actually interested in making him healthy again, both physically and mentally.
In the meantime, Draco is mostly resigned to living like a Muggle. He gets a little personal payback out of it by annoying Harry at times, pretending he doesn't know how to do the washing-up, for example, so that he won't actually have to do menial chores.
Harry searches for Draco's hand next to him and holds it tight making Draco unable to breathe for way too many seconds. At some point Harry's grip relaxes—he's falling asleep.
“That way” Harry points at a shop on the other side of the road, with muscular male mannequins in the window displays.
He still looked improper but at least he felt clean. He decided he was going to ask Potter to give him a pair of those scissors that had been given to him to cut his hair and beard by the Aurors over the course of his stay in the Wizengamot prison. He would have to become accustomed at doing things the Muggle way.
Draco stands up and resists the urge to fidget with the hem of his cuffs. He's wearing a neat white shirt and black trousers. His hair is parted in the middle and combed to the sides instead of back, since he's stopped using Sleekeazy potions. He has made himself presentable without trying to show off his class, quite the difference from what he used to do as a teenager. He wants to show the Wizengamot that he's grown into a new trustworthy man.
“I'll let that slide given that you seem to agree already. I thought I'd have to beg you, really.” Harry is amused by the look of dislike appearing on Draco's face.
“Why do you think that you're going to let me down?” Harry voice is calm but his eyes betray his worry.
Minutes, which seemed hours, passed before representatives from each group stood and declared their vote.
Harry looks at Draco intensely, not buying his reply.
got me in trouble.” Draco relates calmly what happened with the bartender. He's successfully feigning detachment.
Draco can't help but look away and Harry knows he's getting closer to finding out what's gotten into his friend.
Now it's Harry turn to admire the other man's body for a moment.
Harry was in his kitchen, standing next to the window sill and looking out. His new 'house-mate' was sitting at the table stiffly. Malfoy was definitely not at ease. He had completely lost his charm and pompous attitude in the course of his trial. Or maybe it had always been just a façade and Malfoy had always been weak inside. Harry could not decide.
“Draco” Harry says shaking him. Having managed to make his friend focus, he repeats “Can you walk upstairs on your own?”
“The way you speak... isn't from around here. You're funny!” Hannah giggles. “I thought it was just an act with Mickey to get out of paying for your beer but now I'm thinking this is actually the way you are.” Hannah says. She's intrigued and taps her mouth with the tip of her finger, scrutinising the blonde.
“And what does a tube do?” Draco is confused.
Harry's legs and stomach feel cold so he looks down and at last he realises he's almost naked. He quickly decides it's best to hide his embarrassment by acting nonchalantly. “I had a great time last night, I hope you did too.”
made it!”
Draco starts kissing Harry softly, then he forces his tongue into Harry's mouth and explores it. He can taste himself and this new sensation adds to the lust he's feeling. A naughty thought forms in Draco's head and he starts moving his tongue in and out of Harry's mouth at the same pace he's moving his other hand up and down Harry's shaft.
This idea makes Harry reach his climax and he screams “Fuuuck yooouu...”
Harry falls on his bed face first.
There's a moment of awkward silence. Since the beginning of Draco's house arrest, two years ago, life has changed a lot for Harry as much as it has for Draco.
He was sitting on the wooden chair, tight shackles bonding his wrists and ankles to it, his head was hanging low over his chest. Remissive was the best attitude when interrogated by the Wizengamot. He found that some of the members would take pity on him if he acted weaker, and they would go easy on him.
Draco waits a few minutes longer before getting up from the bed, careful not to wake him up. With one last look at the dark-haired boy, he walks out of the bedroom silently.
As soon as Harry is able to control his breathing again, Draco says sultry “About what you just said... that's exactly what I meant a minute ago...”
“So. I was thinking about clothes...” Harry starts talking light-heartedly. “...and noticed how you have one good pair of trousers and one good robe and the rest is just joggers I don't use any more. I thought maybe we could go out to a pub every now and then, now, and that's definitely not how you should be dressed if we get into Muggle London for a pint.”
Draco mewls softly and finally goes to sleep. Harry sits there for a few more minutes.
The last word was up to the Minister.
With another sigh Malfoy got out of the bathroom deciding he was going to be ready for whatever came his way. Nothing could be worse than what he'd faced so far.
Draco is still looking down and his cheeks and neck are bright red now. So Harry finally understands Draco is embarrassed about something.
Scrimgeour enters the court a while after Draco and Harry have been seated into two wooden chairs.
“I'm Hannah, by the way” she calls at his back to make him turn around and face her. “And you're most welcome. Are you new to the neighbourhood?”
Harry comes out of the shop at last, holding a bag.
Draco decides that he's finally calm enough to go to sleep. He too wants to be up early and be ready for the news Harry will bring back from Auror's Headquarters tomorrow morning.
The bartender fires up instantly, “You fucking with me?”
Draco has grown warmer. It's more than cooperation. A great deal different than his initial loathing or consequent distrust. Harry appreciates Draco's progress for real, but he's starting to perceive something more personal coming from his 'house-mate'.
, Draco reflects.
He looks at himself in the mirror and still finds everything too closely fit on his figure. Especially the crotch of the trousers.
He's quite engrossed in it so he takes a few seconds to realise that Harry's peering from his shoulder and that their cheeks are few inches away.
Because this account is mainly one where I write my main ship from another fandom, I've decided to make a new account strictly for hp works. I have two that are in my wips folder alongside the Little Lord. This work will be a slow transition into my other account. I will be doing that by adding my new account as a co-author. I will continue to post this work under this user for the next few updates or perhaps until this is finished and then I will be removing Alia_Lee as an author from the work.
Harry definitely looks away from his book to glance at Blaise on that one. It wasn’t so much that he didn’t trust their head of house and potions master. It was simply that he was wary of him. He always had been. He’d learned early on that Severus Snape was a man of many secrets and that a majority of his actions were based on self-service. He did things for his own agenda and if they coincided with your own then great; if not, tough luck. The only soft spot Snape had was for his Godson, Draco, and lucky that because he did not particularly like Harry. “We can’t be hasty. I’m sure Snape already knows or has an inkling of what is going on. We’ll let him come to the conclusion himself, no?” Draco is smiling indulgently at Harry who had finally decided to add to their conversation while sitting on the floor around the fireplace. Their homework was getting finished slowly, what little they had to finish, and they were beginning to deter to more interesting subjects than a history of magic.
“Elspeth left me. My journals, the last of them I had written and stowed away for Lillian, said that she left me or rather that I had sent her away in a fit of insanity. My journals, Lillian said, repeatedly went back and forth between finding her and begging her forgiveness and leaving her to her own safety. Lillian never found her as far as I’m aware.” Marvolo tilts his head back obviously unsettled by the living half of his soul becoming so insane as to send his own love away. “I wish beyond hope to see her alive and well someday but, I am but a mere portion of a soul housed in a bloody book. What can I hope to give her when I supposedly attacked my own grandson? I don’t even know where what little of my soul is at? I fear I’ll never see her face again.”
“If I can find that one as well, would you be able to return to a true form?”
It was surprisingly easy to find the shockingly blonde hair of his closest friend since the age of five. Dray is standing in front of his father with his mother leaning down to fix his collar and tuck a stray piece of his hair back into place. The action was not unlike what his own mother had done to him just a few moments before.
“What of Sirius, sister? He’s in Azkaban still.”
Bellatrix hums softly under her breath and tilts her head softly. Her inky curls titter slightly atop her head before a few tumble down out of her loose bun catching the light of the fire. “Harion is...quite like you.” She offers him a pointed look which may cause his neck to heat up. It has been many years since someone had been able to know something about Severus without him being aware of their knowledge. The way she was looking at him implied that she knew far more than she let on. “Perhaps hindsight truly is 20/20. Harion is quite like you when you were younger. Harion is still scarred by those wretched muggles in ways that even I cannot fully heal. I will never know his life until the moment he was placed into my arms...not fully.”
“You know we could always have Snape figure out what’s going on?”
It had been nearly a month since returning from Samhain. Harry felt entirely uncertain of himself for the first time in his life since living with his mother. Most of the other Slytherin students had given him a wide birth sensing his tremulous emotions. There was a heartache inside of him despite the velocity of the thoughts in his head. Distracted as he was, his grades never slipped so no professor had stopped him to ask if he was okay.
“I was not worried about my own soul foolish child!” Marvolo wraps his arms tightly around Harion surprising the little boy. “You could have died! A living horcrux should not be magically possible! I doubt very much even in my most insane moment I intended to create a living horcrux out of a magical child. Nor would my magic have allowed me to kill you or my Lillian. Slytherin familial magic does not allow the killing of family. I did not kill you or Lillian that night, this I can swear to you.”
He dives into his mother’s chest and hugs her as tightly as he possibly could. He knew that he was going to miss their quiet little home in the country side. He’d miss laying in the library reading over books while his mother went about her Sunday morning cleaning the house.
“I was in a soul bonding contract…” Bellatrix stares down at the table once more thinking of the pain that still felt far too fresh for being ten years ago. “When he died the curse broke because my magic surged.”
Those that were not paying attention turned their gazes toward the pair as a delighted cackle flutters out of the once crazed Black sister. A delightful praise leaves her lips and the little boy giggles softly in her arms making the sparks appear once more. “Oh how wonderful. Good job!” The little boy claps excitedly and surprises himself when a fuller and more bright set of sparks is released from his fingertips. A few lights flicker in the room before returning to the dull glow they had been set at.
“We’re not sure.” Narcissa tests the words out. They had not really thought about Severus in all of this. It would certainly make sense why he hated Harry so much if he thought that the boy was a product of Lily potentially cheating on him with James Potter. They had never thought to ask Severus if he knew or even if he thought something was amiss. He was certainly powerful enough at mind magics to know if someone tampers with his memories or not. “To be frank we only just learned of Harion’s true parentage. We spoke with Sirius recently and he steered us toward you, so our initial reaction was to seek you out.”
“There was one in me, I think.” Marvolo whirls around to stare sharply at him. “Mother believes when you died that what was left of your soul latched onto me or a part of it did. We removed it from me when I was very small and transferred it to a Black family heirloom. So, don’t worry, it wasn’t destroyed.”
“So, you know everything is not as it was made out to seem?”
A quiet murmur goes down the table in agreement as many of the old pureblood families suffered tremendous losses in the last war. Some families even died out following the war. It was sad to see entire families, who had once been so abundant and strong, reduced to so few members.
“You must be a horcrux then or at least powered by the magic of one left here by your other half in your youth.” The man looks stunned for a long moment. He could not have been any older than perhaps twenty. His age had likely progressed thanks to the influx of familial magic housed in the chambers. “You’ve been aged by the familial magic no doubt, so you were likely sixteen or seventeen when you split your soul. Based on my limited knowledge, you must be my grandfather Marvolo.”
Flint conjures a table behind where they are all sitting against the wall and begins the process of placing food and drink onto the table as a sign of respect. Draco and their friends have already taken a walk around the lake earlier this morning to reflect on nature. Harry was nervous but also excited because tomorrow being Saturday meant that his mother would be able to take him from school to go to his parents’ graves. He’d asked when he was about nine if his mother would be angry with him paying his respects to his late parents and the woman had happily agreed.
Harry had not noticed that everyone had long put away their letters and begun eating their breakfast. Draco seemed worried for a moment before raising a silent silver brow in question. Harry knew that it would be difficult knowing who he was initially born as and how the professors must have expected him to be here this year. He knew that he also had several looks on his back already with being an unexpected arrival. “Mother is fairing I suppose. She says the house is quiet, frighteningly so she says.” The thought alone brings a small smile to his lips. To others it may seem as it the phrase was oddly out of place but to him it meant she was faring well.
“Were you not afraid I would take him from you?”
Bellatrix watches as Narcissa’s eye twitched in annoyance at the man. “Yes, cousin Sirius was always quite stubborn. Don’t worry he’ll come around.” The guard raises an eyebrow as if to question whether Narcissa truly knew who she was referring to and the answer was yes, yes, she did. Sirius would certainly not come around because she was sure somewhere in his mind that he got a kick out of irritating them. “We were told you would have the documents that the ministry sent over for Sirius to sign?”
The platform is crowded with people saying their goodbyes and last minute warnings of children of all ages. Some had moist eyes and some looked relieve to be free of their children for one more year and resigned to the quiet of an empty home. Almost instantly the little boy could tell which few were pureblood brought up and which were not because they stood quietly with their parents in a startlingly appropriate way. Younger ones gave quick hugs goodbye and older ones offered a few parting words before leaving quickly to the train to board.
Harion had hissed the words before he even realized it, repeating after the silken voice whispering in his ear. The tendril of magic wrapped around the whisper sent shivers down his spine like a bolt of electricity.
“I’m Hermione Granger, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Yes well, we should keep that word to a minimum of the dungeons only Miss Parkinson lest we lose precious house points.” The first years freeze at the calm drawl from behind them. Snape was an intimidating man in his own right; even to the kids of his own house. He was tall, foreboding, and frightfully blunt. Harry almost admired him for that. Of course most students rarely saw him outside of school where he had to brew potions so constantly his hair became a greased over mess. Outside of the school year his hair became more manageable, better. “Now, here are your time tables. The prefects will lead you to your classes today but pay attentions they will only do so today and tomorrow.”
Harry stands up and voices thanks to the assembly and to the Minister, then he pats a shocked Draco on the shoulder as congratulations. Draco snaps out of his bewilderment at Harry's touch and follows him out of the room, into the corridor, then into the lift and up to the Ministry Hall and into one of the fireplaces connected to the Floo network.
Draco goes into the bathroom to find Harry sitting on the floor with his face in the toilet. Draco sits next to Harry and holds his head up, while gently stroking his back.
“Lay next to me” Harry demands in a slurry voice and shuffles to the other side of the bed to free his legs from under Draco. It seems Harry hasn't noticed Draco accidentally felt him up.
would have believed you. I
“Well, I did you a favour, how about you do one for me? I find you very attractive.” Hannah brings her hand on his chest and she cocks her head. “Would you like to walk me home?”
“Well, as Auror-in-training, sir, we are required to keep guard on house-arrest criminals. I wish to be the Auror appointed to Malfoy's house-arrest. Which is my proposition to the assembly.”
Harry's plan to turn the sentence into life-long house-arrest seems feasible now. The only thing which would make life bearable this way would be having a wand again. But Draco knows he isn't trusted by the Wizengamot yet. Harry's help is vital to improve quickly enough so that the Ministry will see the good in him and let him live like a wizard again.
“I am. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.” Draco shows off his aristocratic manners. For a moment he thinks of walking away but then he changes his mind and lingers. “If you would be so kind as to give me your contact information, I'll pay you back tomorrow.”
The two men reach the house a few minutes later but Draco is already disconnected from the situation so he doesn't hear Harry's questions at first.
He comes out of the fitting room to complain about the clothes to Harry. “These jeans are so tight there's not enough space for my...” and stops unsure about how to describe the constriction he's feeling around his crotch and bottom. Wizard robes are much more flowy and the trousers he has been wearing so far aren't as tight either.
Strengthened by this small success, he walks confidently around the neighbourhood until he finds a pub. He goes in and sits at the bar on his own, keeping a safe distance from the other patrons. He orders a beer and he looks around while sipping.
“There are some other minor things, but I will illustrate them as we carry on this arrangement. If, at any point, you are in doubt as to what your limitations are, please do ask me so we can avoid unpleasant consequences and we can move on with your recovery without incidents.”
would discuss and write up.
The first few days had definitely been harder, coming from the Manor were he had access to every comfort just with a swish of his wand or with a click of his fingers. But soon enough he found that being a convict in the aftermath of the Second Wizarding War, and having
have happened. So you should also take some of the credit.” His tone is affectionate.
“I guess we'll have more than one reason to celebrate later at the Hog's Head, then!” Harry says cheerfully.
“Is that a friend of yours,
Harry notices how uncomfortable Draco really is so he gives in. They walk to an alleyway and Disapparate.
“Did you like it?” Harry asks with a grin.
Harry wants to console him. “Their expectations of you were awful. And they did not take into account what you wanted.”
, a part of him thought while dressing up. He suppressed the part where he felt some hope deeper inside him.
“The clothes you tried on. I just bought them for you” Harry says stating the obvious.
Harry feels the urge to suck Draco's cock so he does. He licks the tip while still moving his hand up and down. Draco's arms start shaking and Harry isn't sure if that's good or not so he stops to ask “Is everything alright? Should I stop?”
Soon it's Harry turn to moan in pleasure. Draco is putting a lot of effort into the movement but he can see it isn't affecting his lover as much as he was affected by him. He quickly decides this won't do so he moves to a more comfortable position, on top of Harry.
“You were just about to add to your comments on how great of a chef I am. And about the fact that I've learnt to cook without the aid of magic just like any Mud—ggle would.” Draco catches himself just in time. Old habits die hard. But he's making progress, or so Harry says.
Anyway, I would love to hear what you think about the whole thing.
“WHAT THE FUCK!” Draco jumps in surprise blushing and Harry sniggers. Ignoring the provocation, Draco recomposes himself and demands “What was that for?”
But in that same moment he could hear the guards outside fussing to block someone from entering the room.
There are lots of stains in the shape of a circle on the wooden table; they might be on the fourth or fifth round of drinks, except for Hermione who's their sober-Apparator for tonight. Neville, George and Hagrid have already left.
“Are you sure? Have I done something wrong last night? Did I say something bad about you?” Harry asks, now worried.
“You don't need to worry about your eyes. I'd like you to stop reading for a moment and expand on what you said” Harry tries to use his most encouraging tone.
Draco swears under his breath. He forgot he doesn't have any Muggle money on him, or at all. If only he had his wand, he could Obliviate the bartender and leave. But he doesn't have his wand because he's a bloody reject of society.
“Yes, especially since you ran away last night.” Harry says warily. “I think they're expecting a valid explanation if they found out what happened and I'm not sure what to tell them”.
trying to catch you attention!” Draco denies, offended. “I just wanted to live one night as a free Muggle person.”
“What did I say?” Draco retreats.
“Why so?” Harry puts his hand on Draco's to encourage him to continue.
“You do look great, you know” Harry says while shaking hands and he makes Draco blush. “How about we play chess now?” moving the board from the coffee table to the couch.
“Is there any coffee for me too?” continues Harry.
Taking advantage of the moment when Harry's busy pouring himself some coffee, Draco glances over. The first thing to catch his eyes is Harry's arse, then he looks up and checks out Harry's back and shoulders.
Harry knew something like this was going to happen during their night out and he though it best to let it play out in a place where he could have some back-up from George in case something happened.
He's growing bored of reading and cooking and listening to the radio so he decides that he's going to try and go out on his own. After all, if he is trusted enough to go out with Harry and to stay at home alone and behave, he can also be trusted to go out on his own and behave.
Harry laughs and Draco does too.
“I thought I could go out for a pint, like you said a few days ago. Only I didn't think I have no money on me. And that
“OK, go on, then. Tell me! What's wrong?” Harry is starting to become annoyed. It's too much prodding.
Scrimgeour, the Minister of Magic, entered the room and silence fell all-round among the members of the Wizengamot, who had quietly been whispering under their breaths. Malfoy kept his head down.
fought from within the Dark Lord's closest circle, meant that treatment was harsher on him in every aspect of his trial and conviction. His will, never strong on the matter of the War, started to waver quite soon after the older generation of Death Eaters had been shipped off to Azkaban as a result of hasty trials.
“Did YOU do something?” Harry asks with wide eyes.
“We are here today, in the presence of the Ministry of Magic to give sentence to Draco Malfoy, on various accounts of murder, torture, performance of Dark magic while acting under the lead of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
“Who's Michelin?”
“Nothing happened. Stop worrying.” Draco is starting to drag his feet to slow down from the frantic pace Harry is keeping up.
“Stand up, Mr Malfoy” orders one of the High Court members.
They vanish with a pop from the Hog's Head to Apparate in the same alley where the two men left in the afternoon. She then walks them to their front door. An intoxicated Harry whips out his wand and unlocks the door, and he's finding it hard to stand up on his own. The Apparition is making him nauseous too.
You must follow my orders at all times.
Hannah stares at the two men for a moment. Harry blurts out a good-bye and grabs Draco by the arm to drag him away.
“Why is it that you never said this during interrogations? It would have helped you a lot with your case” Harry says gently.
He's used to giving his back to Draco now. At the beginning of his house-arrest Harry had been very cautious, but he now knows up to what point he can trust Draco.
He was met with rising whispers by the whole court.
He's startled to find Draco sipping coffee in the kitchen and he doesn't understand the look of utter disbelief his house-mate gives him for a moment.
“Yeah, I did” Draco replies in a flat tone, still looking at his mug as if it's the most interesting thing in the whole wide world.
Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy's attitude, “I guess it's time for a short house-tour. Go on, follow me.”
You must not communicate with anybody but me, unless you are instructed otherwise by me, by one of the Aurors or by a Member of the Wizengamot High Jury or the Minister of Magic himself. There's a fireplace, as I'm sure you saw, but it is only connected to the Aurors headquarters so I guess it would be pointless for you to try and escape via Floo only to be caught by a bunch of vengeful Aurors.
“Go on, then...” Draco says stabbing a bite of herbs-roasted salmon with his fork and holding it out for Harry.
He can go to bed at last.
Draco opens his eyes and stares him down with a mix of lust ad fury. Seeing as Harry cannot read what's going on in the blonde's head, Draco takes matters into his own hands.
Draco speaks in an accusing tone, “You also have expectations which do not take into account what I want.” He's challenging him again, looking into Harry's emerald eyes.
“I wish to appeal the case on behalf of Draco Malfoy” said Potter in a steady voice and squaring his shoulder to project confidence.
The three of them walk to the back of the shop, where there's a staff area. “Would you like some tea?” George offers.
“You know I didn't run away” Draco tenses.
, he thinks.
“Will you open the door, please?” he pleads.
“I thought you said we had to go through some ground rules...” he said with an indignant tone—it was beneath him to remind his prison-guard of his job but he also wanted to trick him into thinking that he was really willing to 'give it a try' as Harry had put it on their way to his house.
Draco realises they are now standing in the living room of Harry's house. “Of course I can, I'm not useless.” Draco's response comes out so slurry that Harry decides to help him up the stairs, then into the blonde's bedroom and onto his bed.
Draco finally releases the hug and leans on the fireplace lost in his thoughts for a moment.
Draco rolls his eyes, “It's tasty, then... you could just say that, you know...”
Harry and Draco make their way out of the shop while putting on their cloaks.
The old wooden clock on the wall chimes 11 o'clock and then there's the usual bustling which comes from using the Floo network.
“Yeah, thanks—Hold on a moment.” Draco is trying to think more clearly and sits up. “What do you mean 'the potion you gave me last night'?”
He literally grabs Harry's nape and forces his head down on his cock again. Taking the hint, Harry starts licking the tip again, then musters up enough courage to open his mouth enough to let Draco's dick slide in.
Harry isn't sure why every time he gets close enough to make Draco open up a bit, he mucks it up. That has been happening all the more frequently in the recent attempts he has made. He cannot wrap his head around it and he drifts off to sleep while thinking about the warm feeling of closeness he felt when hugging Draco's shoulders.
“It's just a high-end guide for restaurants that Muggles have. You used to like high-end places before--” Harry lets the sentence drop there. It's difficult to dodge the fact that Draco had been part of a rich influential pure-blood family before Voldemort's second rise in power. At times when this would come up, it would often bring a dark cloud over their conversations.
“Hey, that's great!” George gives Harry a hard smack on the back. “Sure I'll come by later, after I close up shop!”
Draco sits on his bed then gives in to the sensation of being powerless and sinks into the covers, curling up like a cat.
Harry is in his underwear at last and Draco checks him out. Given the enthusiasm shown to him, Harry feels quite bold so he grabs Draco's towel and throws it away, revealing his throbbing, erected cock.
he reflects.
Draco has indeed made huge progress in two years but it isn't enough time to judge whether he will be able to stand on his own feet. He still has moments were his first instinct is to fight Harry or his new Muggle life. Harry knows the process is much longer than what they've accomplished so far and he secretly fears that the Wizengamot will take it all away from him because that would cause Draco to spiral again. But Harry will not allow this to happen.
“Great! We'll get going now. See you later!”
“Calm down! I bought them because you looked handsome in them.” Harry replies defensively. He was just trying to make up for his previous misinterpreted reaction. “I mean it!” He says holding the bag out to Draco.
“Yes,
He punches himself in the head.
? You have an unusual name too...” Hannah grins grabbing his wrist.
“Right... if you say so. I'm going to bed now. Good night” Draco says stiffly and walks away quickly.
Draco is shocked and he's not sure how to handle the information. His mind is still a bit foggy and he cannot stop pacing.
Harry has just put the vial on Draco's bedside table, when he turns around and sees a partly naked Draco standing on the doorway. The blonde is only wearing a towel wrapped around his waist and his hair is wet and dripping. Draco's tired expression still shows the effects of last night's events.
(See the end of the chapter for
With one final loudest “Fuck... Harry!” Harry feels a jet of liquid shooting down his throat. He gags but resists the urge move away. He wants to swallow every drop of Draco's come.
Five minutes later, when the washing-up is done, they're still completely silent.
“Do I take that as your go-ahead?” Harry whispers into Draco's ear softly, making the blonde shiver.
“Thank you” Draco says politely while the bartender yells at him “Get the fuck out of my pub!”
“We have considered the progress you have made in the past two years and agreed to Mr Potter's appeal. You are no longer sentenced to life in Azkaban and your house-arrest stands. You may present a request to reduce the terms of your house-arrest in two year's time, if Mr Potter will be able to vouch for you at that time and if you will have shown that you are able to live peacefully within our society” the High Court member stops for a moment to let the verdict sink in.
Harry sighs, still sitting on the couch.
Draco doesn't notice his friend is worried. He is not fully aware of himself at this stage but he does realise that he's alone for a bit. He isn't sure how long Harry takes before stepping into the room again. It seems like an eternity but also a few seconds, at the same time.
“I'm going to have to repeat myself again, then. It isn't about making you feel 'less than', it's about teaching you how your life as a wizard makes you privileged but not superior. When magic is taken away from you, you learn that Muggles have their own ways of conducting life and this doesn't mean they're useless. Just different.” Harry concludes while starting to do the washing-up without his wand, to prove his point.
“My life was like hell, then... I heard you had found a way to defeat the Dark Lord...” Draco's voice lowers as he speaks, “and I guess I wanted to... give you a chance to carry on with your task. I wanted to see how it went and if that could be my way out.”
The wards around the house have decreased since his new sentence was passed. He felt it when he passed through the threshold when they went to London. So he puts on his new Muggle clothes and simply walks out of the door without encountering any issues.
“...morning...” Draco replies with his gaze fixed into his mug.
Draco widens his eyes in stupor, “What does it look like? Are you daft?”
“No, I mean the underground train system. It's faster but smellier and more crowded than the bus.”
From Harry's smirk, Draco can tell he's joking. He holds out his hand for Harry to shake, formally implying that they've made up.
“Yes” Draco says with anticipation and moves both his hands to Harry's lower back.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco shuffles on his feet while Hannah is waiting for an answer expectantly. The awkwardness is broken when someone shouts his name from a few yards away. He turns around to see Harry running towards them.
Harry leans over the table and feeds off it, he leans back while chewing and then makes a face. “Oh, NO! You've poisoned me!” he shouts in a theatrical way, bringing his hands to his throat.
“Yes, whatever... I'm in prison, still.” Malfoys said sitting back on his chair. “But can I use the bathroom in private?”
Draco runs upstairs and locks himself in his room.
Draco Malfoy——you have been found guilty on all accounts and have been sentenced to life in Azkaban. You will be transferred tonight.”
“Like the fact that you look at me like you're pleased even though I know I will disappoint you sometime in the future.” Draco stares directly into Harry's eyes challenging him to prove him wrong.
“Well, Minister, I made statements to show how Malfoy was an unwilling participant from the early stages of the War. I hoped this would give you reason to lessen his sentence. As it is not the case, I wish to make a proposition for Malfoy's conviction. That is, while I make my case to prove that it is within reason to lessen it.”
“I'd like to take you to a shop to buy some new clothes. Mostly Muggle ones. Like mine.” Harry explains.
“Not worth the bother. Let's go back home.” Draco shrugs. He doesn't want to fall into the trap.
At the same time, Harry's jaw falls open at the sight of the handsome blond man. The jeans are skinny tight and chisel the shape of Draco's bottom precisely. The sweater looks like a good fit too. Only a couple of seconds pass before Harry catches himself staring, but it's too late already.
Draco walks away and goes upstairs to his room saying “I'm not ready yet.”
“I can assure you that my manners are of the highest standards.” Draco raises his chin as to prove that his superior decorum isn't an act.
“Did Hermione Apparate us here as promised?” Harry's thinking maybe he tried to Apparate them and got them splinched and Draco had to fix them with his wand, breaking one of the most fundamental rules of his house-arrest. So perhaps he's giving him the silent treatment as punishment.
“I was
Harry opens various cupboards until he finds his hang-over cure and he downs it in a gulp. He turns around, eyes closed, leaning onto the kitchen counter. The potion takes effect in a minute and he's sober again.
Harry walks to the front door. “Go on, then. Let's go.” he encourages Draco to follow him.
Draco swears silently while sitting on the couch and grabbing the book he started the other day. He opens the book where he left a bookmark, which is a rectangular piece of paper used by Muggles in place of a spell. He tries to focus on reading but his ears are alert to any sound Harry makes in the kitchen and his mind is stuck on the image of Harry's fit body.
“I'm glad about their decision too. You don't need to thank me. You've accomplished so much in the past two years. You should take credit for this” Harry says convincingly.
“And how are you so calm about all this?” Harry's voice sounds angry but he really is just worried. “Didn't you think I'd notice the wards being disrupted? We just spoke recently about thinking actions through!” Truth is, he thought Draco had escaped and he was panicking, going through possible reasons and excuses to make to buy time while he tried to find him. He was so relieved a couple of minutes ago when he spotted the blond on the pavement outside the pub.
“Nothing” Draco is still trying to brush this whole thing off.
“OK. Now that we've established we're both great, how about some lunch? We need to be prepared to get hammered tonight!” Harry jokes excitedly and walks to the kitchen, Draco in tow.
Harry and Draco didn't talk much during the ride and now that they got off the bus, Draco finally comments on it, as Harry had been expecting since they got on.
“No, I didn't” Harry admits and continues treading carefully. “Your strategy is very good, as usual. I hope you would put as much thought into how you act around people.”
“Why, then?” Harry remains calm. He really wants to understand.
Half an hour later Draco is crushing Harry at the game.
He cannot and will not relate to that so he puts down the second book. He remains with one book in his hands, which is supposed to tell the story of the bloke who lost the war, from the time before he lost it. This is something Draco can relate to, even if he won't ever admit it aloud. So he sits down on the sofa and starts reading.
Harry puts the bag on the floor in the corridor upstairs and knocks at Draco's bedroom door. “Draco? I'm sorry for pushing you too far. I though it would be fun to do some Muggle shopping with you. Clearly I should have prepared you better for the experience and what to expect. I'm sorry!”
“I'm officially an Auror as of this morning, mate! So bring your ledger out, I wanna see if your books are all in order” Harry jokes.
When they reach a safe distance where they can talk without being overheard, Harry questions Draco. “What the fuck where you doing?”
“You what? How dare you? Have you not made enough fun of me?” Draco spits at him.
Harry's mouth moves from Draco's lips to his jaw and then to his neck and earlobe, tasting his skin. Draco's erection is quite hard now and Harry smiles. His hands are now stroking Draco's back while he's licking his neck. Draco lets out a moan.
Harry gets down on his knees in front of Draco and he starts exploring the pale skin with his hands. First Draco's thighs, then up his hips and his torso and then down to the dark blond patch of hair.
Harry cautiously looks Draco in the eyes while taking his cock in his hand. Draco moans in pleasure.
“More!” Draco cries out, giving Harry more stamina.
What did you think of the jump foward in time from the Prologue? Any feedback on the storyline is appreciated. :)
“Yes, but not quite. I don't know why that woman was coming on to you so hard and... I think someone drugged your beer. I'm sorry” Harry says lowering his eyes. He should have been there for Draco, instead of giving him space.
“3.50£” Hannah says reluctantly. “But I told your friend he could repay me in a different way,” she shoots a lewd look at the blonde.
Draco is turned on by the way Harry's taking control of the situation, so he complies.
Harry laughs. “I thought it would be less worrisome than taking the Tube.”
Harry takes a short step forward and their bodies are now touching. Harry feels Draco's dick stiffening under the towel and he likes the idea. So he decides this is the moment to take a risk.
Calmly, Harry responds “Well, it was just to show you how unpleasant it might be when people sneak up on you...”
Draco hates to depend so much on another person but on the other hand, he's finding that living without so much scheming is much less exhausting. Also, honesty has been repaying him. In the past few hearings which Harry and Draco attended at the Wizengamot Draco was questioned by the High Court, and Harry strongly felt that they're convincing the assembly to let him continue with his house-arrest longer than two years, which was the initial agreement. Harry is positive that Draco will not be brought to Azkaban to serve the rest of his life-long sentence.
“Morning. How are you feeling?” Harry retracts his arm to stretch. He smiles sideways to Draco.
“Draco” his friend's smile is welcoming. “I'm sorry about earlier.”
But he could not forget the fear in Malfoy's eyes during Sixth year at Hogwarts; he then found out that Voldemort had made him a Death Eater with the immense task of killing Dumbledore and of finding a way to get the Death Eaters into the school.
“I'm sorry... I know I tend to have my moments of, uh... thoughtfulness. What was I saying?” Harry says trying to perk up.
Around 4pm they're ready to go out so they walk to a nearby back alley and Disapparate.
Harry smiles still caressing his arm. “I care about you too.”
“Nothing... I was just trying to watch and learn what you were doing” Draco responds defensively retreating.
"You were never a secret to start with," Draco declared; his thumb still resting on the corner of Harry's mouth.
After losing Hedwig, it had taken a couple of years before he had felt comfortable buying another owl, having resorted to using one of the school owls until then. The ease of having a personal owl eventually overrode his apprehension and had him going to Diagon Alley to buy a new one. Selene was a jet black owl with pure golden eyes, the complete opposite of Hedwig and that was exactly why Harry had chosen her. No owl would ever be able to fully replace his first friend, but he also didn't want to be constantly reminded of what he had lost if he chose another snow white owl. So Selene had been his choice then.
"Now that's rather cliché," Draco told him amused.
Harry grinned, amused in spite of himself. "As long as you don't get a breakdown about a cauldron melting, I think you'll do just fine."
Easier said than done.
"That is actually kind of amazing, not going to lie," he said impressed. Not that he still encountered a lot of enemies when he spent most of his time at Hogwarts nowadays, but it was still interesting to know that in the event that he somehow did get abducted Draco would be able to find him.
She groaned and flicked her wand at the tea kettle to make the water start boiling. "Yes, yes, I know. Fine, why don't you start at the beginning?"
wards present at this school?" he stressed.
you and Mister Malfoy can make things work."
Cuddles
They ended up walking for around fifteen minutes, Harry guessed, when they came out onto a small clearing. In the middle of it was a large, light purple blanket on which a variety of dishes were stalled out to his amazement. A shimmery shield above them kept the food from being stolen by animals, but Harry could spot a plate with small triangular sandwiches; one with steamed white fish and asperges; a bowl with salad; some kind of meat smothered in sauce; some empty plates to put the food on. There was also a large plate with cut up fruit like apples, oranges, strawberries and bananas waiting next to a bowl of liquid chocolate. A bottle of Elven wine and two glasses were set up on a separate plate.
Grey eyes narrowed. "I don't know what your deal is, Potter, but people are starting to stare. You might want to think twice about associating with me unless you want to tarnish your precious reputation," Malfoy said sarcastically.
Cuddles
Harry paused for a few seconds, wondering how he had even come to equate the flicking in and out of view of the wings with the fact that it must mean Draco was upset. He dismissed the thought for now, walking around Draco to sit in his chair again.
, you can always talk to me, I do not mind."
Malfoy's silence forced him to glance at him and he raised an eyebrow at the strange look the blond wizard favoured him with. "What?"
Earlier today Draco had told him he would be taking him out for dinner and that he didn't have to dress up too formally for it. What was too formal, though? As a Pureblood and being part of the Malfoy family, Draco probably had frequented quite some high end establishments already, so he was most likely used to dressing up nicely. He hadn't wanted to tell Harry where he would be taking him, however, so he had no clue what to expect. He doubted it would be anything too casual, because this was still Draco, but that didn't help him in deciding what to wear.
"Yes, it makes the Veela and their mate more …" she trailed off, floundering a bit as she tried to find the appropriate word. "Attuned to each other. Veela can sense their mate's feelings, so in return the mate can - "
Shit, he thought he'd put that thing out of sight. "That's a gemstone, Teddy. Pretty colour, hm?" he smiled patiently and held out his hand. "Where did you find it?"
"By all means, just barge inside like you live here," Harry muttered and closed the portrait, rubbing his forehead.
Perhaps even more aware than they had been of other people.
He rolled his eyes. "Yes, like that would go splendidly. 'Hey, Malfoy, do you happen to get the occasional extra appendages on your back when you fly or was I just imagining things?'. Yeah, like he's going to answer that."
"Yet since he started working here, he hasn't mentioned you once. One would also think that he would be overjoyed to tell us who his mate is now that he finally found them, yet he's been oddly reluctant to share more than the most basic information – and with that I mean we only know that he's courting someone."
"Not particularly, I'm just surprised you chose for the forest and not some kind of fancy restaurant," Harry answered and shrugged. "What are we going to do in the forest? Fair warning, I don't know where the giant spiders are right now; Hagrid hasn't told me."
"Because it's thrown by Purebloods?" Draco asked knowingly, tilting his head slightly to the left.
"Well, how the hell should I have known you could fly with them?" Harry protested, waving at the wings which were slowly materialising behind Draco. "It's not like I know a lot of Veela and I never saw Fleur with wings, let alone saw her flying with them!"
She snorted and stood up, lifting her mug. "Sure, keep telling yourself that. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going back to bed and you need to go to sleep as well. Don't let Malfoy bother you so much; I'm sure it was nothing."
Hanging upside down with only his legs clamped around the broomstick because there hadn't been any time to correct his course and he'd wanted to grab the Snitch before Malfoy could get to it. Using moves he hadn't performed in years, but which his body still remembered as clear as day as if he had been flying every day …
"Big talk, Draco," Harry murmured and allowed their fingers to briefly clasp together before he pulled away from the desk and started walking to the door. "Now let's see whether your actions can back it up."
"Now that's a big compliment coming from you," the blond said dryly before sobering up and tilting his head slightly to the right. "As for what will happen next – that's up to you."

"All right,

– that's far from answering any personal questions like this one," he retorted and checked his watch one last time.
one of the ways that makes it easier for us."
the same, '
"If I was a real git, I would just leave you floundering about, while you and your friends tried to figure out what was wrong," Malfoy pointed out with a snort. "Instead I'm here telling you the truth."
Please leave your thoughts behind in a review; should you spot any mistakes, please point them out to me.
"So instead of catching it with your mouth, you decided to catch it with your chest this time?" Malfoy questioned, sounding a bit out of breath.
"He served under You-Know-Who; I think some doubt about his intelligence isn't strange here," Ron remarked.
"You'll see," was Draco's mysterious answer and he pushed open one of the doors. "Let's go before the students arrive and start gossiping."
Without preamble, Harry took the stone out of his pocket and showed it to the blond man, who didn't even twitch nor look surprised. "You got any idea how this got through my wards, Malfoy? You know, one of the
They were adults now, no longer teenagers trying to see how far they could push each other before the other one would break.
"Maybe it's still too new for him?" he offered.
Harry laughed, pressing himself even closer against the Veela. "Shut up and kiss me again," he ordered and this time Draco had no trouble complying to his demand.
Draco allowed him a moment longer to look around before he started flying straight forwards, keeping his arms securely around Harry's waist. This high up in the air the wind was definitely colder, but Harry could barely feel it, too aware as he was of Draco's body pressed against him. His body heat seemed to seep straight through their cloaks, warming up Harry more than any Warming spell would.
"Yeah," Harry muttered and took another sip of his coffee. "So am I."
"That's quite the endorsement," Harry snorted. "Thanks. So all right, what's going to happen now, with us deciding to try it out?"
Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling owns it.
"Excuse me, I have to go see who it is." If it was a student – some overeager ones seemed to think that professors never slept in during the weekends – he would tell them to come back at a later moment. The last thing he needed was for rumours to spread if someone found out that Mrs. Malfoy was here.
"Hm? Well, I did sleep well last night," he said lightly. "That makes even the worst of Mondays slightly more bearable, don't you think?"
"Yeah, I didn't expect it either," he said ruefully. "I just want to confirm a couple of things he told me about yesterday, if you don't mind."
Back then he and his friends had agreed on a sign he would give when he really couldn't handle all that political bullshit anymore and one of them would come rescue him then, using some kind of excuse to pull him away from the politician in question.
Thank you for the comments and the kudos! I really appreciate it and I'm happy to see that this story has already surpassed 300 kudos!
"Thanks, Ron," Harry smiled gratefully and dared to joke, "Don't worry, I won't tell you everything about what we get up to."
He would need to visit the library after classes for sure. Considering how herbology was one of the main classes taught at Hogwarts, there had to be books available depicting the meaning of flowers. He could go directly to Sprout, seeing as she knew everything there was to know about plants, but it was an idea he discarded as soon as it rose up in his mind.
The dragon snorted when Harry halted in front of it, opening his jaw as if to breathe fire.
"I don't think it, I know for sure," he corrected her. "I confronted him with it right before classes and while he tried to be an evasive git about it, I saw that he recognised it."
"I want to show you something. How much do you trust me?" Draco questioned out of the blue. His eyes were intense as he leant slightly forwards.
Malfoy stared at him for a little while longer, his mouth pressed into a thin line before all the tension suddenly left him and he nodded. "Fine, meet you at the Pitch in ten minutes."
"Don't do anything stupid," she warned him.
"That never does," Draco sighed and rubbed his forehead. "Once she's got her mind made up, it's impossible to change it. I'm sorry; I didn't think she would actually seek you out."
Cuddles
"I don't know
"I'm surprised you're still here," Malfoy commented offhandedly. At Harry's bemused look he elaborated, "You know, considering the other professors usually only lasted a year."
"Why not? You think she'll react badly?" Lucius probably would, given their history together.
Harry took a deep breath and released it slowly. "Yeah, we'll try dating," he agreed and then poked his finger into Malfoy's chest, making the other wizard blink. "But if you ever try that enchantment crap on me again, you'll regret it for the rest of your life, am I clear?"
He would have liked to take the boy down to Hagrid's hut and let him hang out with Fang, but it was raining quite hard to the point where Harry could barely make out the towers across his quarters whenever he looked outside. Not exactly the type of weather to walk through even if Hagrid's hut wasn't that far from the castle.
"No, not constantly!" she immediately denied, her eyes widening a notch. "I'm not explaining myself well," she said chagrined and was silent for a moment.
. Do not give him false hope, because that
When he raised his hand, he blinked bemused at the golden ball fluttering furiously in his hand, trying to escape before it gave up; its wings folding up.
While he looked apprehensive at least at being held at wand point, he appeared satisfied as well, as if he had something confirmed for him. "That basically confirmed what I suspected for a little while now," he said, which did absolutely nothing to solve Harry's confusion.
So how had this stone managed to get through his wards without setting off any sort of alarm?
I hope you'll like this chapter!

AN2: Some of you were wondering whether Narcissa would show up soon, well, here she is ;) I'm particularly fond of this last scene, just saying.
Excitement bubbling up inside him as they started their last round; this one being the one that would break the tie between them – he'd missed it, the excitement, the adrenaline, the rush of diving and swooping through the air, hearing cheering from the stands, nothing but the Snitch in his mind.
He opened his mouth, confusion making him momentarily forget about their competition, when something hard smacked right into his chest and he grabbed it instinctively even as he gasped for breath; the impact leaving him winded.
"No, apparently they have a hard time forgetting I allowed Death Eaters into the school, imagine that," Malfoy drawled, stabbing his fork through his fish.
"I'll cook for you when you come with me to visit home," Draco retorted, grabbing the two glasses to fill them with wine.
"Hm." Draco drew closer, twirling the two flowers between his fingers. "Not to offend you, but I hadn't expected you to be able to figure it out this quickly."
Author's note: Many, many, many apologies for taking so damn long with this chapter *winces* All I can offer as an explanation is that the past months have been either exhausting or shitty or both, which makes working on a light-hearted story as this one fairly difficult to accomplish. I had a hard time getting into the right mindset for this one, but that's no excuse for leaving you hanging for so long. That definitely was not my intention.
"Good morning, Mister Potter," Narcissa Malfoy smiled affably. "You mind if I come in?"
Except it did and it was driving Harry
He supposed the wings could have disappeared too quickly for anyone else to notice, but …
"Expecting those two to get along would be like expecting those Blast-Ended Skrewts to be less violent," Snape sneered, crossing his arms.
"Hush, you," he smiled before he sobered up again. "Malfoy overheard that and basically challenged me to a Quidditch match."
"When have I ever done that?" he questioned rhetorically and left before she could decide to rattle off an entire list she no doubt had memorised throughout their years of friendship.
"Thanks, Fleur, you really helped me out here," he smiled gratefully and wrinkled his nose then. "And sorry for taking up your time. I'm sure you and Bill had better things planned than discussing Veela with me."
"How would you know when you've never seen me play?" Harry huffed amused. "Tales can be exaggerated, you know."
I can help you. I
not the only one who can do it. You will be able to do it too, sense '
"Professor, can you please come join us during practice tonight?" Thomas Wright asked, his eyes glittering with excitement.
Treeling had definitely not been suitable to teach children, that was for sure. One accidentally melted down cauldron had caused her to throw a fit and resign three months before the ending of the school year. While she might have been a lot friendlier than Snape had been when he taught Potions, clearly she hadn't been cut out to teach people who might make mistakes.
Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling owns it.
A short demonstration had thrown that assumption out of the window and had gained him the respect of the Slytherins.
"So me receiving a stone cut in the shape of a wing not even a full day after I questioned your wings is merely a coincidence?" This time, Harry quirked an eyebrow. "I might have elected not to become an Auror, but that doesn't mean I can't connect dots anymore. What the hell is your game here, Malfoy?"
"Too fast for you already, Malfoy? That doesn't bode well for your chances, you know?" he taunted and laughed when Malfoy casually flipped him the finger before getting on his broom as well.
"Not unless he wants to face both me and mother," Draco smiled thinly. "Trust me, he knows better than to want that."
"Well, rest assured, when I take you out to a nice restaurant, it'll be one where our privacy will be guaranteed," Draco smirked and waved at the dishes. "Take whatever you want. I can have more brought if you want to."
Author's note: Many, many apologies for taking so damn long with this chapter *winces* It was never my intention to have you all wait so long, but for some reason my writing schedule is even more of a mess this summer break. I'm hoping to finally get a better updating schedule, however, and I hope you can forgive me for having you wait so long for this chapter! If you can't, I fully understand, because these delays have been ridiculous :/ I don't know if I even have readers for this left ...
He couldn't wait for Saturday to arrive.
to bypass any wards," she said. "That
He found the flower on the table just like this morning and it felt like a déjà vu because again it was a white daffodil. The sight of it left him a bit stumped, to be honest, because even though he hadn't expected a fourth flower, he thought it would have been something different again. Did this mean that he could expect a second carnation and a second chrysanthemum?
"Really? That's great for him," Harry smiled blandly, drinking from his own tea. It burnt his tongue but he didn't care about that; too busy trying to figure out just how he was supposed to react.
"I don't think Fleur has wings," was all that Harry could think of to say, still fixated on the pure white colour of the wings. He had only seen them in very brief flashes before; flashes which hadn't shown him just how big they were exactly.
"Not even the Slytherins?"
He had experienced a lot of strange things. One could even say that he had experienced nothing but strangeness the second Hagrid had set foot in the dilapidated cabin on Harry's eleventh birthday.
"You don't sound like you believe me," he said accusingly, narrowing his eyes.
Yes, Harry knew that quite well. He discovered that he couldn't wait to find out what exactly that meant for
They might get along better now, but Harry wouldn't say they shared a lot in common.
"So what made you land on the right explanation then?" Draco halted less than two feet away from him. His robes were pristine even after a full day spent behind cauldrons and Harry idly wondered whether he had changed his robes before coming to find him.
The dark haired man refused to let it bother him and simply looked to the front again, saying, "Well, I guess I should welcome you to Hogwarts again."
"Why would the Snitch – no, never mind, doesn't matter now," she decided and shook her head, sitting down at the table again. "Let's assume what you saw, were indeed wings."
He had felt magic rising in the air, but it hadn't been the same kind that he felt when curses or spells were being cast. Whatever Malfoy had done to his eyes, it was something he could do without using a spell. A potion perhaps? But what would be the point in that when he was the one taking the potion and not Harry? As far as he was aware, potions only affected the person taking them, not any outsiders unless they got hit with the liquid. He was sure he would have noticed it if Malfoy had tried to dump a potion on him.
"What kind of questions?" he asked blankly. Why would she even go to him when Draco was more likely to be able to answer whatever questions she had? He was missing something here, right?
"I don't have anything against red." Draco rolled his eyes. "Just against that garnish colour that Gryffindor insisted on decorating the tower with."
Currently he was wearing a dark blue sweater and black trousers, which weren't too stiff. A soft grey cloak was laid out across the bed, ready to be put on and brave the weather outside. Cocking his head to the left, he wondered whether he was dressed too casual now.
Considering the amount of sensitive information stored there, you had to get a special permit in order to enter the room and even then you couldn't remain as long as you wanted.
"My son has never been in the habit of keeping things a secret from us. At least not from me," Mrs. Malfoy added finely. "While he and his father might have had their differences occasionally, he knew he could always come to me and confide in me without fearing judgement. That is why I cannot help but be highly curious why he would not tell us who his mate is."
"How did he react exactly?" she inquired, furrowing her eyebrows.
"Aw yes! Wait until the rest of the team hears this!" Wright exclaimed and rushed away before Harry could say anything.
"Put your money where your mouth is, Potter. You and I, tonight at the Quidditch Pitch. Try not to cry too hard when you lose," Malfoy told him arrogantly before striding away.
Please leave your thoughts behind in a review; should you spot any mistakes (aside from my fucked up time management) please point them out to me.
"Why would you assume that?" He hastily took another sip of his tea, finding his mouth uncomfortably dry all of a sudden.
to know them. After all, the
There was something mesmerizing about the innocent creatures wandering around the field, playing with each other or cuddling closely together in order to catch some sleep. Very few were ever lucky enough to witness such a beautiful sight.
"Call me Draco and I tell you what my game is here," the git smirked, crossing his arms. "Shouldn't be too difficult, no?"
"That's an aventurine," she recognised immediately, which didn't surprise him. "In the shape of a wing?"
Well … He stirred finally and placed the stone on his nightstand before getting out of bed. He wouldn't get any answers if he just kept staring at the aventurine stone. Guess he had another reason to seek the other man out.
When they parted in front of the staircase in Hogwarts later on, Draco grasped his hand and kissed him on the back of it, winking when Harry gaped at him. Oh, Harry saw where this was going and frankly he couldn't wait to find out where it would end.
. We're not a slave to our Veela, we
," Harry smiled, amused when the use of his first name made the Veela still visibly. "Let's try dating each other."
So now she had to tell him his favourite bedtime story and he couldn't wait to hear it again!
"Nope," Harry replied cheerfully and lifted his broom slightly. "Came here to ask whether you're interested in another match."
"What's your sudden obsession with getting me to call you by your first name? You're getting off on it, or something?" Harry asked irritated.
Kissing Draco was definitely a lot more fun than dancing was.
"I know this might be a very confusing time for you, '
He wrinkled his nose. "Of course not. He did something strange then, though. When he looked at me sometime during our conversation, I swear his eyes turned this metallic silver and all sounds just became … muted, sort off," he fumbled to explain. "Like I was dumped into water or something, or had something covering my ears. Whatever he was doing, I managed to shake it off, but that only led to him saying that he had something confirmed now."
"So, was this demonstration good enough for you?" he questioned, hovering a few feet away from the stands.
"My, we are confident," Harry hummed and couldn't help but be amused a bit. It was good to know that Malfoy being a Veela didn't mean he would turn into some simpering idiot, ready to do Harry's every bidding.
"So what did he tell you?"
"It's not Miss Parkinson," Mrs. Malfoy said amused. "That I'm certain about. I do have a suspicion, however."
The non-sequitur question had Harry staring at him bemused. "Not much, I guess?" he answered after a pause and shrugged. "Bill's married to one. They're magical creatures with enhanced beauty that they can use to influence non-Veela. And that's about all that I know."
So no, he wasn't a stranger to odd things. Basically came with the territory of being Harry Potter, really. He'd grown used to it by now.
"Something's off with Malfoy."
"I know, but we've been kind of hoping that you would show us some tricks," Wright grinned crookedly. "You're still the youngest Seeker Hogwarts ever had and you led Gryffindor to victory in your last year! We want to win the trophy again this year, so could you show us some of your moves? Elisa is a great Seeker, but you're still better."
"Look, I'm the one who sees him every day," Harry cut in before it could blow up to an actual argument. "And while he still can be a git at times, he has changed. If he does try something, I'm pretty sure I can handle him, though. I doubt he can be any worse than Voldemort."
"Hold on to my shoulders or around my neck," Draco instructed him, beckoning him closer. "If you want to be really sure, you can always wrap your legs around my waist too." His eyes were definitely shining now; a hint of silver around the edges.
He had managed to figure out that Malfoy had been up to no good during their sixth year, so how difficult could it be to discover what he was up to now?
"Erm, it's not that bad anymore," Ron laughed nervously, before scowling at Harry. "Really, mate?"
"Erm, sure, no problem," Harry agreed awkwardly, because honestly, what could he say? Clearly Mrs. Malfoy wasn't about to take no for an answer now that she knew for certain who her son's mate was.
"You think they'll allow you to go into the Records Room?"
"Screw this," he decided aloud and turned away from the mirror, striding to the bed.
Some Slytherin students eyed him bemused when he strode through the dungeons, aiming straight for Malfoy's private quarters. They eyed his broom with interest, but seemed to think better of questioning him. There was no doubt they were wondering just what the hell he was doing in the dungeons at his late hour, though, carrying a broom of all things.
, but he wouldn't lie about this," she stated, staring at him. "We Veela take our courtship,
"I mean, it's not like you and mother started off wrongly," Draco protested. "Pretty sure it was only father who considered you to be a pain in the butt."
"Well, they'll have to get over it eventually," Harry said, deciding to go for the carrots instead of the corn.
"I'm not avoiding answering you," Malfoy insisted and rolled his eyes. "This is called leading someone into a conversation; I'm sure you've heard of that."
"You have captivated my son's attention from the moment he met you," she replied smoothly and leant back again. "For years you were a constant mention in his letters to us."
The butterflies in his stomach were because of the wine, Harry stubbornly told himself, and not because of the sultry tone in Draco's voice. Because that would be absolutely ridiculous, especially after just one date.
"I'm releasing the Snitch now!" Elisa Ponder called out, attracting both men's attention.
, then I'll support you, mate."
I hope to see you all back in the next chapter! Please stay safe and take care of yourselves!
The blond stood right next to the armchair Harry had been occupying, his hands on his hips, and his wings flickering in and out of view, showing his agitation.
He waved his hand impatiently. "That doesn't matter, focus, 'Mione. So near the end of our game, I noticed something really weird. I didn't see it for long and it was gone in a flash, but I swear to Merlin, for a second he looked like he had
It was when he was diving sharply, his hand already outstretched, ready to close around the Snitch, Malfoy gaining on him rapidly, that he noticed it.
And it was clear he wasn't – harming anyone that was. While most professors still were quite wary around him, none of them could deny he was a good professor. Students talked after all and only very few were subtle. Bar the occasional bemoaning about the homework or the harsh grades some were unfortunate enough to receive, none of them had any particular complaints.
, it might be a lot harder than how it was between Bill and I. I cannot tell you what to do, but I do ask that you take this seriously, '
Please leave your thoughts behind in a review; should you spot any mistakes, please point them out to me.
"Sure," Harry said innocently and right as grey eyes widened, turning silver, he darted forwards and pressed a kiss on Draco's cheek. "Good night, Draco."
"We're colleagues and the war was finished years ago; why not call each other by our first name? We're no longer children with a silly school rivalry." He shrugged, acting more blasé than he was. "Why assume that he gave me those flowers? As you mentioned, it's a strange assortment – the kind you would more expect a kid to give you, no? I'm sure you're aware that I have a godson. As for the stone," he shrugged again, "I like the colour of it."
Harry decided this to be an opportune moment to leave; when Flitwick and Sprout started arguing they could go on for hours, a fact which had surprised him immensely at first considering the two of them were considered to be two of the most mild mannered professors at Hogwarts. He supposed even a rivalry between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff existed, though.
No doubt he would need all his energy for that.
I hope to see you all back in the next chapter! Please stay safe and take care of yourselves!
If he wanted to avoid being dragged in the argument, however – and they would drag him into it soon, no doubt, as it had happened before – he would have to leave now. He ignored McGonagall's knowing look as he stood up, cramming the last bite of his toast in his mouth. There was no reason to look like that at him; he had a class to run in less than ten minutes after all.
"Okay," she said slowly and pursed her lips. "Is it an urgent matter of life and death?"
"Only with you," Draco shot back quickly and winked.
"I'm glad to hear that," Draco said; the corners of his mouth pulled up in a small smile. "You think you want to do this again?"
He supposed he should feel at least a bit guilty for throwing Ron to the wolves like that, but really, he had started it. He knew very well that it made Harry uncomfortable when students as young as fourteen years tried to flirt with him. The seventeen year old girls even went as far as reminding him that at the end of the school year a relationship wouldn't be illegal anymore. No matter how many times he rejected them – as politely and gently as he could – they kept trying to flirt with him.
While he and Fleur often chattered when the Weasleys happened to organise a gathering for the whole family, she never talked about her Veela heritage. He didn't think it was really taboo to talk about it, but there had never been any reason to discuss it and so it never came up.
They had been idiots to boot, holding the fight right in front of his classroom when they knew very well he was still in the room at that hour. At least he and Draco had tended to have their fights out of the teachers' range most of the time.
Malfoy's head slumped a bit more when the person who read the sentence sat down on their chair. In that moment he gave up hope completely.
This last chapter is a bit longer than the others. Hopefully you won't be bored and you'll get to the juicy end. ;)
Followed closely by Draco, Harry makes his way to the back, where George was showing a customer a set of Chinese dragon fireworks.
Draco's arm is a bit tired from holding the weight of his upper body, and so he thinks it's time to move things along, so he whispers into Harry's ear “Since you seem to like my arse, how about next time, you take it?”
“Then how about you exchange the favour?” Harry asks while grabbing his own erections and starting to move his hand up and down.
On the other side, those are golden opportunities to be close to Harry pretending he's watching and learning. He can smell Harry's soap scent, which reminds him of his first shower in a real bathroom in this house... He can feel Harry's body warmth and it's endearing.
After an hour or so, Draco realises he's squinting to see the lines on the book. It's dusk and he wishes he could just light the fire and get cosy next to it. But, oh no, he needs to actually get up and turn the freaking lights on with a switch.
The Aurors who had escorted Malfoy to the trial room, escorted him back to his cell at wand-point as if they were worried he would rebel. Malfoy still could not process what had just happened and walked limply to his cell.
He read the whole situation wrong. He thought Harry found him ridiculous but his apology seemed sincere. Maybe Harry did not take him out shopping just to have a laugh. Harry was just being a good friend, trying to help him fit in the Muggle world. Buying him clothes so they could go out for a pint because he is allowed to get out of the house now. Why did he waste this opportunity?
“Sit on your bed” Harry says in a commanding voice.
Given the fact that he isn't allowed out of the house, Draco's expression darkens “I see...”
“Good, let's go then” Harry says getting into the fireplace first.
Draco huffs in response, still not convinced.
“I have a headache” states Draco flatly.
You must not go outside the walls of this house. There are, of course, wards in place to prevent you from doing that.
Draco looks away before being honest once more. “Because I'm like that. I can't live up to the expectations people have of me.” It isn't easy but being honest is the only way he'll become closer to Harry and stand a chance.
When Neville and Luna arrived, she sat next to Draco and started chatting him up with one of her extravagant theories. That really helped making the night begin smoothly with a laugh.
Harry decides he'll spend the night in Draco's bed in the end. To care for him.
, he tells himself.
Still, it was weird to discuss the fact that the few people who remained in his life were still awkward in Draco's presence and viceversa.
Draco's eyes are now full with lust. The confusion clouding his head is gone. He doesn't want to wait before going further or he'll find a reason to dissuade himself from going through with it. So he tears open Harry's trousers and yanks them down while the black-haired man is taking his shirt off.
“I am NOT afraid of looking at you!” Draco says indignantly and looking at Harry at last.
Draco's bitter admission comes after a few moments. “I guess I never had faith in the fact that we'd win...”
Harry sniggers and retreats his hand then resumes eating his sandwich. “Well, how was I to know that you would pick up Muggle cooking so easily and become an excellent chef!? I wanna try your food... it isn't like I'm taking it away and starving you, for Merlin's sake!” he responds.
“Well, that was unpleasant.” Draco is disgusted. “Muggles do not understand the need for personal space, do they? And they most certainly do not shower as much as what's considered appropriate.”
Draco's expressions shifts to a worried one.
Harry is fazed out for a moment and he doesn't realise that he's walking towards Draco until his lips meet the other man's and they're kissing.
Draco is not trying to get into trouble the first time he goes out on his own, so he swallows his pride and walks out of the door, followed shortly after by the woman.
“I think I'd like to take my clothes off now, if that's OK with you. I feel kind of weird to be the only one who's dressed.” Harry whispers to explain why he going to taking a step back momentarily.
Draco decides it's best to run away now before giving himself another hard-on. So he mutters something about reading a book and gets out of the kitchen, leaving Harry to sit alone at the table.
“So what are you going to say?” Draco sits up and looks away, ready to escape the difficult situation.
“Okay, maybe I was trying to catch you attention.” Draco concedes. “But I certainly did not mean it to unfold like that.” He moves away as reality is sinking in.
Harry thought there was something there to build on.
“I can't read like this, my eyes will hurt.” Draco protests.
The High Court said to be open to the possibility but only under strict conditions, which
Draco does the washing-up while Harry goes to the study to write a letter to Hagrid and ask him to join them at the Hog's Head. He pretends he doesn't notice Draco acting as a perfect housekeeper but he is secretly happy that many aspects of their living arrangement are fitting like pieces of a puzzle.
Resigned to be having this conversation for the umpteenth time, Harry sighs, stands up and starts collecting empty dishes and cutlery from the table.
, says another small voice in the back of his head.
He thinks of touching Harry's cock and he shivers in his release.
Malfoy forced his head down again, to avoid showing the disbelieving look stuck on his face. Why on the bloody Earth would Saint Potter ever defend him? He must surely be hallucinating under the influence of some kind of poison... just one of the perks of being interrogated by the Wizengamot. Being a former Death Eater, Scrimgeour closed both his eyes more than once at the unorthodox methods used by the Aurors to extract information and confessions from him.
The hug lasts a few moments longer than Harry expects and he realises how tense Draco had been while waiting for new judgement.
Harry Potter was going to be Draco Malfoy's appointed Auror during his house-arrest and that meant bringing his arch-enemy from school into his home. The Manor had obviously been confiscated by the Ministry, being the scene of multiple crimes and the source of much dark magic, so they couldn't very well just walk in there and move in.
Draco is quite annoyed. Mostly at himself for having let his guard down, but partly at Harry because he doesn't understand what he does to him when he's so close.
“Mr Scrimgeour, I would like to make a statement before the trial is over” the voice was coming closer, as the person managed to get past the guards and get in.
“So what's up?” Harry places his index finger on Draco's chin and makes him turn his face to look at him.
“It's a side effect of the potion I gave you last night. I have some pain reliever downstairs, if you want” offers Harry.
When Draco hears Harry walking downstairs, he finally relaxes.
“What's that?” Draco asks angrily pointing at it.
“Fine. I can watch from here” says Draco standing five feet away from the sink, to Harry's right.
“Yeah she did” Draco confirms in a flat tone.
While thinking about this, Draco misses most of Harry's complimenting. Harry isn't very good at spotting Draco's 'moments of thoughtfulness' when making an effort to perk him up at the same time so he hasn't realised Draco wasn't even listening.
It's a whole new sensation for both of them. One of Draco's arms gives in and he falls back on the mattress. He's moaning louder. Harry tastes Draco's skin and finds it salty from the spilling juice.
Harry smiles. “I see that now. Sorry.”
The two men both turn to look at the woman who has just paid for Draco's beer.
“...and I thought maybe you would like to come too...”
“Whatever... it's too late for one of your lessons now. I'll pass.” Draco says covering himself properly again. “Aren't you supposed to be having your beauty sleep? Why are you up?” Draco asks distractedly, pretending to be more interested in the book open on his legs than on having a conversation with Harry.
In a fraction of a second everything stills. George, his clerk and a couple of customers take notice of Draco immediately and the air becomes dense.
Harry broke up with Ginny, who did not support his choice regarding the former Death Eater. She could not bring herself to visit him as a consequence and they slowly grew apart.
Draco sighs and turns to his side. He tries to get up but his legs don't cooperate.
Once alone, he laid down on his bed and stared at the ceiling. Could this be his lucky break?
But Harry actually responds by sitting up and shrugging his shirt off. He then tries to unbutton his trousers but his fingers are not working properly.
On the other hand, he was satisfied with the fact that Potter had not bothered him for the entire time he stayed under the shower jet. Taking his own time was something which had been impossible for months now. Aurors were always escorting him from his cell to the interrogation room and back, or from his cell to the court room and back. The only time he had for himself was when he was left in his cell alone. And that wasn't pleasant.
Harry asks worried, “Are you sure you are alright? I can take the day off if you want me to stay at home with you. I'll keep you company. We haven't seen much of each other recently...”
I am not sure whether this story is actually complete. It seems like there's room for more but I've been sitting on it for a year without making any progress so I thought it was about time to publish it and have some feedback. Maybe someone's comment can give me inspiration to write more? Who knows.
Draco immediately retreats, while Harry spins and asks “What were you going to do?” while reaching for his wand in his pocket.
“I needed to go to the toilet and I noticed the light was on downstairs and I wanted to check what was going on.” Then he adds in a mock-cheerful way, “Pleased to find you so interested in Hitler and his evil ways...”
, Draco thought.
The Aurors were against.
made the difference in that situation. You did something good!” he reaches for Draco's hand but mid-way he changes his mind and puts his arm around Draco's shoulder in a sign of encouragement.
“Given your stance in our society since the War, Mr Potter, and given how you have been fighting for this criminal since the very beginning of his trial, I believe there might be a possibility of reintroducing this criminal into our society in the future. The Ministry will show that it is possible to be redeemed and reformed, if one is willing and if one demonstrates the change. We need, after all, to mend what has damaged our society in the past decades... and showing mercy to those who had a lesser impact on the War is one of the possible ways of doing that. Thus, Mr Potter, the Wizengamot grants a house-arrest sentence to Draco Malfoy, and its conditions will be read to him during the next and final hearing of this trial.” The Minister paused to let the turn of events sink in. “All interested parties will be summoned when we are ready. For now, you are dismissed.”
“I just mean that you are intelligent enough to consider the consequences of your actions and I do not understand why sometimes you make a choice without considering what could happen next.” Harry explains.
“But I won't do the dishes. Not even our house-elves at Malfoy Manor would do this kind of labour without magic! It's too demeaning.” Draco says pointedly.
“I thought we put that past us...” Draco's glee is darkened by Harry's comments.
“Look at my Father. Look at what happened with the Dark Lord” Draco says removing his hand from Harry's to scratch his forearm where his Dark Mark is. “Look at Mother”
Harry starts moving his head up and down, while keeping his hand at the base of Draco's cock. Draco continues moaning and that makes Harry even more aroused. He wants to suck Draco dry. Harry hollows his cheeks and starts pumping with his hand as well.
“That I forgot to lower the wards even if I promised I would let you go out on your own so we could meet at that pub and see how it went.” Harry makes up as he speaks.
Draco's pupil are dilated. Harry moves the tip of his wand from right to left to see whether Draco manages to follow it with his eyes. He doesn't. The blonde seems unable to focus. Harry is worried that his friend was somehow drugged. “Let's go. Our house is just a few yards away” he says softly while grabbing Draco by the waist to support him. Draco leans in and lets Harry carry some on his own weight.
Draco's resolution to patch things up with Harry is stronger than the uneasiness he feels, so he goes downstairs.
The bartender taps him on the shoulder and says “That's 3,50£”
Draco feels like Harry's face is too close now. Harry's touch is too warm on his shoulders. He's trying to look away from those honest green eyes, but he's finding it difficult. So he decides to run from his emotions and to stand up. If anything, it has to happen on his own terms when he isn't feeling weak and when he has all his wits about him.
“If you must, Mr Potter...” responded the Minister unwilling to hear what Potter had to say.
“Yes, he's a friend of mine.” Draco replies stiffly. He feels a scratch on his wrist while freeing his arm from her.
“Good morning” he says with a raspy voice.
“Earth to Potter... Hello??” Draco says clicking his fingers in front of Harry's face to snap him out of his thoughts.
know how he's doing? He is basically living like a Muggle, with no access to the outside world. His only source of information is Harry or the Aurors and they stand on very different points of view on what has been going on since his sentencing.
“I said I'm sorry. I'll come back tomorrow and pay for this beer, alright?” Draco doesn't understand why the man is so on edge for just a beer.
Draco stomps out of the fitting room throwing the clothes in Harry's face. “We're getting out of here. Now!” He feels like a fool for even agreeing to this. He knew he would look ridiculous in Muggle trendy clothes and kicks himself in the shins while waiting for Harry outside the shop. He doesn't know which way to go and, besides that, he isn't supposed to run away.
Someone from the right-side group of the judicial assembly rose, cleared their throat and started reading:
Harry collects himself, smiles and says “It actually is. If Hermione walked in and found left-overs, she would never guess
Taking the bus into Oxford Street felt horrendous to Draco: lots of people crammed up next to each other, some talking into devices which Harry told him are called mobile phones.
While Harry is lost in his thoughts, Draco gets up from the bed and his head spins for a moment. He takes a deep breath and starts pacing.“I went to the pub down the road. I had no money.” Draco relates the events. “Some Muggle woman paid for me so I avoided getting into a fight with the bartender. Then you arrived and paid her back. We got home and we fell asleep.”
, Draco thinks. He's trying to avoid inner turmoil, not go through it again, so he puts down the last of the three titles he has just read.
They prepare some sandwiches and a salad to eat. They chat about how to break Harry's news to Ron and Hermione tonight. Draco wants Harry to prank his friends saying they kicked him out of Auror's training because he wants to continue helping with his sentence. But Harry is way too excited to be able to hide his happiness.
, he thought. He wasn't sure how to feel about that.
“I said nothing's wrong! Stop. Asking.” Now Draco is annoyed too. This is about to unfold and not on his own terms.
Harry could not forget when Malfoy lied at the presence of his Mother, his Aunt Bellatrix and the Snatchers when he had been in search of the Horcruxes with Hermione. Harry felt that Malfoy had recognised him despite the Stinging Charm Hermione had cast on him before being captured. Still, Malfoy denied his identity.
A moment later they are in Hogsmeade. Draco hasn't been there for the longest time so he isn't surprised when he sees how different it has become. But it still feels familiar somehow.
“I'll leave you to it, then. If you need anything, I'll be downstairs” Harry sighs.
“Don't walk away from this conversation” Harry pleads. “I've been making you feel uncomfortable for a whole day now. I want to fix that and I need your help to understand how to do it.”
But Harry has been catching up to him recently. Harry has noticed something is going on and he has started teasing Draco furtively about it. Sometimes he does it in such a sweet way, like tonight, that Draco finds it hard to hide his feelings and he needs to escape. Even if that means making Harry think he's taking steps back in his recovery.
At the same time Hermione stands up and taps Ron's shoulder to make him realise it's time to go.
Harry holds out a glass full of a clear-coloured potion. “Drink this up, you'll feel better in the morning.” Draco sits on his bed for a moment, gulps down the potion and lies down again.
Draco feels safe when Harry is around.
Yes, there was something good inside Malfoy and Harry decided it was worth trying to save it, and nurture it and possibly he would make him a better man in the future. It was a risky move on his part; it might earn him disfavours from some of the older Aurors who held grudges against the Malfoys since the first Voldemort-resistance era, and it might make his Auror training harder and his graduation farther in time. But Harry was never the one to step away from a risky road and, besides, Dumbledore had always relied on his ability to love others and on his compassion. So that was that.
Then, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry could not forget Malfoy's pleading look in the Room of Requirement when fleeing from the Fiendfyre, nor his look of terror when Crabbe vanished in flames.
Draco feels tense. He's been pacing up and down the living room for an hour now. He was expecting Harry to come back sooner that this.
“I'm not one to be begged to do trivial things. I will do them when they are necessary” Draco says pompously.
Draco hugs him without thinking, just following his instincts. His chin rests on Harry's shoulder and his arms wrap Harry's waist tightly.
Everybody starts saying their good-byes, then Hermione grabs Harry and Draco. While she takes Harry's hand and Draco's elbow, Draco slides his hand in hers. Hermione thinks the alcohol is really doing the trick to make an uptight Slytherin loosen up.
“Of that I'm sure” Harry jokes giving Draco a once over.
Harry knows Draco is trying to wind him up. This is going to be his excuse for sulking all night and cursing the moment he made the choice to put his past... well, in the past, and try to make a change.
