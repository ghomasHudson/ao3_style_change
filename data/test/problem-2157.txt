Draco thought amazed; his own scars, some of which Hari gave him, were nothing compared to the many that painted a gruesome story all over his body.
"I get the items you need and you teach me how to live out here? No..no funny business?" Harry asked.
Hauling the startled boy out the door and down the hall to the broom cupboard, she opened the door, pulled the string on the light above, and placed the boy on the carpeted floor next to the old broom and mop. She then closed the door. Only then did Harry begin to cry.
He could tell that Sheryl really planned ahead in Hari's costume choice. Like Sheryl's gown, Hari's costume looked expensive. Hari was dressed as ancient Egyptian Pharaoh, that could put the last pharaoh of Egypt to shame. He wore an Egyptian style
"Ollivander told me that my wand core came from the same Dragon as my mother's. Our wand cores are brothers."
"He was an abusive monster, who used me for his own selfish means, his heir, his perfect clone to show off to everyone, to brag about, and when I didn't do anything worthwhile about, he beat me, called me a failure for not beating you. It didn't matter that you didn't know I was competing against you. It didn't matter that I got better grades, more house points, you stole the spotlight in his little obsessed game." Draco growled. The loud rumbling actually had Draco pausing.
Hari was just opening his mouth to blurt out, “I don’t need service from bigoted wenches like you,” when a familiar hoarse voice spoke from the shadows of towering wand boxes.
Queen Beryl stepped forward in a long mermaid style purple dress and violent red hair just as the musical arrangement began to play. The sound of a Saxophone, trumpets, guitar, and a rhythmic drum beat could be heard before the keys of a piano and Queen Beryl began singing about demanding respect from her man when he got home. It was lively and everyone went wild.
Nik rubbed his hands over his stubble with a sigh.
Thought Andromeda.
“No say sorry to Kreacher, Master Harry. Kreacher does not deserve Masters apologies. Kreacher was a bad house-elf and deserves punishment, he does. Gracious Master Harry Potter didn’t leave me dead.”
Kreacher rolled his big brown eyes, and took Harry’s arm and disapperated. Harry’s world spun away, the ground disappeared from beneath his feet, his lungs compressed painfully, then expanded as if suddenly sucked through a narrow straw and spat back out again at the end destination, the air echoed with a loud CRACK!
“My marriage certificate and wedding invitations.” Narcissa says.
. He wanted to stop surviving and live not just in the moment, but in the future, he wanted to
“One needs to consider a good match.” Narcissa was saying.
02 September 1991
I do not know what I did, but father was not pleased with me for some reason. Did he somehow know, suspect? I thought at first that Crabbe or Goyle squealed on me for some reason, or I let my mask slip during the game, but no.
his aunt had joked. But Draco was relieved nonetheless. He wanted Hari as a mate, damn it, not a brother.
“Like you had your mother, I had one family member who I loved. I had Sirius, but he was taken from me. Then I had Teddy, and I nearly gave him up. If I hadn’t gone to visit Andromeda when I did, who knows what would have happened to them.”
elato. I’ll see that one of the house-elves has it in cold storage or stasis until you are ready.” And so saying, Hari left the once forgotten withdrawing room and went up the stairs.
Draco didn't expect to comforting a weeping Hari. Not knowing what to do he looked around in haste, before scooping Hari in a more comfortable position against his chest and just let him cry. His heart was racing a mile a minute, as he just held Hari for the longest time, waiting for the tears o subside.
Before him was a dragon, or at first what he thought was a dragon was in fact humanoid. White scales glistened as the sun broke the horizon. Nearly blinded, Hari sat loosely on the broomstick with his mouth gaping wide.
“Here you are, Master.” Draco carefully took the Black family portraits from the house-elf. The first portrait was that of his deranged lunatic of an aunt, Bellatrix and he had an urge to throw it against the wall and break it into pieces, but he restrained himself. He shifted through the portraits until he came across one in particular, a male with curly black locks to his shoulders, grey eyes and a roguish smile.
He could just imagine what their reactions would be if—he meant when—he broke the news to them.
Draco flushed embarrassed. He had very distinct misgivings about why hosting a party would be a bad idea. For Hari and him.
When Hari laughingly did, Draco huffed. “My nose is not pointy.”
The Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt, stood up from the stands above and made his lumbering way down to the crying mother and shell-shocked son. He mentally shook his head at the boy, for that was what he was, a boy not yet eighteen. ‘He convinced himself he was guilty and did not deserve forgiveness.’ Kingsley thought as he finally made it down to the chamber below. The two had not yet realized they could leave the chambers.
Also, Peculiar Harry Potter (He Calls it magic)
Harry gulped, but carefully making his way down the rungs. "Thanks for saving me, mister." Harry said in gratitude. He wanted to sneak away, to find a safe place to go, but for once found himself not wanting to leave his rescuer.
Carefully moving his eyes about the room without moving his head too much, Harry took notice of the two doorways; both door frames were made of cherry wood, the polish glowed red against the faint morning light coming in from the east. The east facing double glass doors was carved into four half circles; two of which mirrored each other, coming together at the doors center divide to create one whole circle, while the other two half circles were inverted to face the hinges. With one horizontal carved wood created the impression of a cross at the center of the doors. The fogged glass added privacy from anyone looking in or out of the study. The second set of doors, nearly took up the whole west wall of the study, rectangular with two large windows that bookended the double glass doors, optimizing the most out of any natural light that may come in from the west. Harry could just make out an iron fence, brick and green tree branches swaying in a summer breeze outside.
Hari had a lot of emotional baggage, but he didn’t know to bring anything. “I haven’t anything…” He began, before Draco presented the rubbish bag. Hari then noticed what it was. He laughed heartily with his head thrown back.  Unexpecting, it was the bag he forgot in the corner of the room, he thought to burn anyway. The bag of clothes that were not even fit for rags. Clothes he kept that used to be Dudley’s hand-me-downs.
Please social distance yourself from others, go into volunteer quarantine if you are able.
“Me and Hari.” Draco said with a sudden radiant smile. His smile slipped into a worried frown. “You don’t mind that I intend to peruse…this with Hari rather than be with a witch?” Draco asked his mother, tentatively.
"Why?" Draco cleared his throat, but didn't continue his question.
Draco turned his head slowly towards the sound, seemingly unhindered by the intrusion on his private space. "Hari..." He breathed out, eyes slightly unfocused before snapping to attention. His whole posture changed as he uncurled from his perch on the windowsill. "What are you doing here?" Draco's voice sounded harsh, even to his own ears.
"That oaf..." Hari elbowed Draco sharply in the ribs.
"Perhaps I like strays?" Trout said tossing a hunk of something for Harry to catch unexpectedly. It was a mason jar with meat floating in liquid. "It's trout, or at least whatever catch of the day I scavenged last week. If I don't have a fire, I just pickle 'em. Doesn't take much."
No words were spoken once the crypt was sealed on the Lord's and Lady's Mausoleum. The hand holding Hari's gave a sharp tug as Draco suddenly pulled Hari around and along the wide sweep of grass to the nearest apparition point.
10 May 1992
At the blonde’s nod, Hari pulled out his new wand.
they need some nurturing assistance.” Hari snipped off a few wilted leaves at the same time.
In that one brief moment Hari’s entire awareness was drawn to Draco. Even with mud slanted in hair and on neck and cheek; Draco Malfoy was stunning.  For some inexplicable reason, Hari felt a sudden fluttering sensation in his stomach, his heart was racing, and his hands were cold and sweaty around his wand. He felt tightness in his chest and realized that he was holding his breath. He let it out in a silent whoosh that blew across Draco’s wet throat. And suddenly, Hari was looking into captivating stormy gray eyes only inches away. Hari’s own eyes widened when he realized he was sitting on Draco’s lap, on the ground, in the mud. He scrambled up with an undignified yelp, cheeks scarlet, and heart racing. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he cleared his throat trying to come up with a distraction.
Hari’s earlier apprehension from eavesdropping fled his mind. Narcissa actually approved of him after all and would support their relationship; even going so far as to break a betrothal with Astoria Greengrass. Wasn’t she years younger than he anyway?
His aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon, were very sensible, non-nonsense type of people. And in the nearly ten years that Harry Potter lived with his relatives he learned some fundamental lessons.
~~~~~~
She loved the fire. I then took an iron bristle brush to scrub off the residue between her scales. Honestly. I'll have to do this every other day.
Draco looked into his laughing green eyes, stunned, too shocked to be offended by Potter's words. He didn't know where to place his arms let alone his eyes as he kept glancing back and forth between his second cousin and Potter. He was so close, just inches away. His alpha was rolling around in giddy delight at hearing his name being spoken softy by Potter's soft lips. And Draco

09 May 1992
Currently, Blaise was flirting with two Muggle girls who seemed to swoon under his attention. His teeth flashed white against dark skin, coyly as he flirted.  Suddenly, Blaise peered over his shoulder as if sensing Draco's eyes upon him.
Hari’s food quickly disappeared from his plate as he ate his breakfast as fast as possible. He ate all his meals with quick, small bites making it easier to digest and less likely to choke.  Living with the Dursley’s taught Hari this valuable lesson: Eat fast, because meals are far between and can be taken away at any moment. Old habits were hard to break. If Hari ate too slow his cousin Dudley would finish his much larger meal, then swipe Hari’s food right off his plate, and there was nothing he could do about it. The Dursley’s would often send him away from the table before he finished his meager meal. Withholding food had always been one of the Dursley’s worse punishments.
“Err…yeah.” Hari was getting a sinking sensation in his stomach that coming to Draco for help was a bad idea.  Draco sat up.
“How ever did you find this place Hari?” Draco said, still not taking his eyes off the statue. He was half convinced that it was made by their kind. He was waiting for the sculpture to become animated and prove his own point.
“Which is why I suppose you like them so much.” Draco tossed back.
She spoke in a clear voice: “When breath becomes air, I beseech you. Grant us clarity, happiness, and love we share. Each breath thine is mine, with each inhale I breath in you a fresh memory and with each breath I exhale the bad. For the dawn of tomorrow.”
“The anssswer isss in Massstersss magic, can you find it?” Asclepius hissed quietly. “Can you feel the magic inssside? Clossse your eyesss and open your mind to the feeling. Feel how wild your magic isss, erratic and out of control. Grasssp the magic threadsss and braid and weave them into a coil. Reach and hold tight, and bring it to the sssurfassse. Wrap your magic around thisss Kreacher.”
Her poor Dudders was in distraught over having another babe in the house. His face was scrunched up and red as he wailed for having his crib taken over by this scrawny upstart. Her nephew, Harry on the other hand? Not a peep. He just stared at her solemnly with Lily's eyes. His face a perfect blend of his parents genetics. Lily's eyes with James darker and wilder hair. Suddenly, Harry smiled and Petunia was again reminded of her dead sister in the shape of the lips and forming of a goofy grin.
------
Sheryl was also watching Hari, Draco, and how they interacted with each other. She found it very interesting. Draco was clearly infatuated with the boy. His body language screamed it. The way his legs angled towards Hari when they talked, the way he casually brushed his fingers against Hari’s when reaching for food, the way he sought his attention, and even the way he mirrored Hari’s movement from the tilt of his head, or the way he held his fork, or running his hands through his hair. It was endearing.
But there was still one more loose end to be tied up, and that was one member, Severus Snape, murderer of Albus Dumbledore and double crosser of the Light.
The blood slowly draining from his face as he realized that Justin-Fucking-Finch-Fletchley had just taken a picture of them, snogging in a Muggle gay club, dressed in drag. They were about to be outed.
However, in my heart of hearts, I secretly hope he wins. He has the better broom, a Nimbus 2000. The fastest broom on the market. I am glad McGonigal chose to bend that rule about first years not being allowed their own brooms.
Slipping on the silver studded wedge boots with matching bracelets, he stepped from behind the curtain and stood paralyzed as the air froze in his lungs.
“Half-blood loophole, I’d imagine. Many orphans got left behind after the war. It was custom for well-off wizarding families to take in orphans if they had no living relatives. Most of them are pure-bloods and back then it was nearly impossible to know who was a Death Eater or Dark Lord sympathizer’s. He probably felt it was safer to stay behind the blood wards with a willing family to take you in, Muggle or no.” Andromeda rushed to justify.
I'm gonna go, go, go
“You didn’t die, Hari.” Draco said.
Hari let out a shaky breath then continued. “Then we need to stop blaming ourselves. We need to move on from the war, somehow. Clean slate. We have forgiven each other, and the world will just have to deal.”
Just a week prior Draco and Narcissa left the Manor to take a jaunt into town for the first time since the trial, only to be nearly mobbed in the street. They needed to go to Gringotts and settle their financials, withdraw gold, and sort items needed to be moved, sold, or destroyed. The two Auror details assigned to them were negligent in their duties and stood aside and watched as the crowd of vicious accusations grew along with the mob. When Draco shouted at the nearest scarlet clad Auror, “Why aren’t you doing anything? HELP US!” The Auror said impassive, “No one has drawn their wands and until then we are not obligated to step in.” That excursion was unsuccessful and the Malfoy’s were forced to return home without completing the tasks they set out to do. Narcissa never left the Manor again since that incident.
Harry Potter can’t be ordinary can he? He defeated the Dark Lord when he was an infant, was it all a fluke?  Maybe not, Mister Harry I-can-take-on-a-troll-and-live –to-tell-the-tell-Potter, did it again.
In the kitchen located in the basement of Grimmauld Place, Harry stood in front of the fireplace connected to the Floo network. The fire was blazing an angry green, and bars of green fire barred the entrance from letting Kingsley into the townhouse.
Just like that Hari’s frustration was over. Malfoy was still Malfoy; he wasn’t lost to deeply in his guilt as Hari was not too long ago. The world seemed to straighten itself out. Hari laughed light heartened.

Love,
------
"Oh well. Then I suppose you do not remember confessing your everlasting love to me. Quoting Shakespeare, and telling me to make all your decisions for you?"
Whip it to me
"Eighteen--of age--I'm nineteen--only for underage witches and wizards." Draco, Blaise, Cho, and Hari tried to explain over each other. There was a pause and then the three wizards and one witch began to laugh.
Draco lowered it in a dejected manner. "Just...why? I don't understand these feelings, it's so confusing and mixed up inside me. And then at the funeral...no one came. Mother sent out clear invitations. There was a bloody hell damned obituary in the paper. All father's boasting about power and prestige, of knowing the right people and all the ins of the Ministry and business, and... no one came to his funeral."
"You mean, Mrs. Weasley. Mrs. Weasley is an omega?" Hari asked in wonder.
Deliberate changes made by author include, including a statue that wasn't built until 2003, years after the Harry Potter canon timeline.  And the use of 21st century 'American' slang. I'm from the U.S.A, sue me! ...please don't, I have no money.
"Thieves." Hari frowned, not understanding. "Hari, there was a reason why the Dark Lords Regime in the Ministry were targeting Muggle-born. Father says...father said, that Muggle-borns steal the magic from the wizarding world. They get introduced to our world, go to school to learn all that can be taught to them, and then they leave. Many never assimilate and just...leave. Many of them leave and any contribution is always changing our ways, our traditions, our culture. Like, like..." Draco paused, hesitated. "Granger."
“Welcome to Hennes & Mauritz!  My name is Candice, how can I be of some assistance?” She said with a simper and a giggle for the dark haired cutie.  She pushed out her chest in a tight, revealing blouse trying to draw his attention. She fluttered her eyes for good measure.
with each advance you make towards him, or he you. He is not aware of the fact, and you have not told him.” Narcissa said with eyebrow raised as if implying that Hari’s ignorance of wizarding ways was somehow his fault.
"A diary. You wrote in your diary about me." Hari said.
Draco gulped, but stepping forward. “You said, Sirius taught you before fifth-year?” He inquired.
Hari’s adam apple bobbed as he spoke, “She was killed, last year. Just leave it, please.” Hari begged.
It could just be his pre-rut hormones on overdrive, making up hallucinations about having a baby,
As Draco continued on, Hari hurried between traffic. The bell above the door jingled when he entered. The tanned man over the counter said welcome and Hari nodded in greeting before perusing the aisles for something he thought Draco would like. Had Draco ever had Muggle snacks before?
"No, that's alright...hey, can you show me again?" Hari's face reflected his curiosity.
This all happened by the time her husband made his blimp of a self down the stairs. He saw the vase, his wife and son, the green eyes just barely peering out from the vent beneath the stairs. He could assess the situation for himself.
“Dra...Draco!!!” Hari stammered out flushing even more. “You can’t just say things like that.” He hissed.
1 April 1992
“Strength of the earth, I beseech you.” She called. There was a gentle tremble in the ground, the soil turned over and the roots of the plants in the garden shiften then settled. Hari notes that Andromeda is actually barefoot, her soft green robe reveals one pale calf.
"Awe, if it isn't famous Harry Potter," a voice that sounded like dried twigs and leaves, spoke from a desk stacked high with books as tall as his shoulders. Peeking around the corner carefully, not wanting to walk head first into an attack, but something compelled him to move forward and face his consequences.
"To the point of committing incest rather than marry outside the family if no other suitable spouse could be found. Great Aunt Walburga and her husband share the same last name before marriage, and in fact, are second cousins." Draco interjected.
“You miss him, huh?” Hari asked.
It never bothered him how he looked before; why should it matter now? But as Harry held up a wrinkled, stretched out, and faded
------
They moved onto shirts; t-shirts, oxfords, polo, Hensley; long sleeve, and short sleeve. Hari was dizzy with the amount of work it took in overhauling his wardrobe. Draco was having a blast.
Slipping his head beneath the surface of the frothed water, he held his breath just letting his mind empty of thoughts, before surfacing again. Taking a deep breath, he tensed. While he was beneath the surface of the water, Hari had entered the bathroom unannounced. Draco's back was facing the direction of the toilet so he couldn't see Hari, but he heard the clear sound of a stream of liquid hit the inside of a porcelain bowl, and smelt the faint pungent smell of ammonia. Hari Potter was taking a piss right behind him. The sound of trickling water diminished, he heard the sound of nails scratching against bare skin, and a loud yawn, before the sound from the toilet flushing and then the rushing water from the faucet in the direction of the sink.
Disgusted with himself, nearly sick in the aftermath of such unprovoked violence, Draco turned away from Potter, whom he believed was passed out or at least unable to get dressed, and he began to sort out his soggy, and limp clothes somehow still on him. He needed to get dressed quickly and get help for Potter. Once his shirt was on him once more and finished buttoning up his trousers, he heard a splashing sound behind him. He wheeled around to find, Potter had managed to roll himself over towards the sink, clamber for his wand and shout, “Sectumsempra!”
Hari was handed a pocket sized, leather bound, brown book.
When the warmth that was Draco wrapped around him from the step above, only then did Hari realize the chill on his skin. He leaned his head sideways against Draco’s arm, content to sit out the night and greet the morning.
So I keep secrets in here, and some I will share with Mon Mère, like the secret of Harry Potter. Mon Mère got me books, lots of them, and when I am alone I read them to my house-elf. I think Harry Potter must be the strongest wizard in the world, to survive the Killing Curse and he doesn’t even have a wand yet. I don’t have a real wand, just Papa’s old one that he doesn’t use anymore. So, truly Harry Potter must be the greatest, Dobby agrees with me. Papa was really angry when I said this. He says, the Dark Lord is the greatest wizard of our time. I don’t know, there are lots and lots of books on Harry Potter, and none on this Dark Lord Papa brags about. I like
“Ah, sorry.” Hari whispered as he withdrew his finger in embarrassment. For a moment Hari had forgotten that he himself permanently silenced the last voice of Walburga Black.
Andromeda reached out her hand to Hari’s own with the blood tear drops dripping to the grass. Together they unfurrowed Teddy’s fingers as he clenched them upon the unwelcome prick to his palm. His palm was painted bloody. Hari winced. He knew Teddy wasn’t in any pain, but he hoped to never see Teddy bleed again. They then placed their own bloody fingertips to Teddy’s palm. Their blood mixed.
Hari was pushed down next to him and Draco grinned pleased at this arrangement.
Harry broke down crying, tiny Teddy in his arms. He clutched the tiny life to his chest as if his own heart would stop beating if Teddy was taken from him. Teddy began to whimper but didn't cry.
"I uh...er...Yes," Snapping out of his stupor, "you are correct. If Andromeda wasn't disowned when she married a muggle-born, she would have been entitled to her inheritance. I would like to give what is due to her back, as the grandmother of my godson, she must be taken care of financially. I'd like to assume her debts and pay them off in full, if I am able to...Chieftess." He tacked on at the end, not wanting to sound insufferable. "And awe..Teddy Bear here, I would like to make my heir, if that is possible. I mean Sirius was able to do so with me, and Teddy is my godson, can't I do the same?"
a Death Eater…
ore commonly referred to as accidental magic, as it was usually only seen in small children before they were given a wand and taught to control it.
Hari's vibrant green eyes snapped to focus on Draco. He gave a nod, probably directed at him but the band took the cue to start playing. Hari opened his mouth, and finally-finally Draco could hear the notes in Hari's voice that he only caught fleetingly that night in the garden. The night he confessed his love to Hari on a drunker heap on the floor in Hari's study.
Pulling off the tarp, dust shooting up into the air from the year of sitting idle, Hari hoped it was running alright. He really wanted to see Draco’s face when he got on and jump started it. He got rid of the sidecar and Draco would have to ride behind him on the seat. Rolling it out of the shed, Draco was just walking up to the shed, having taken his sweet time walking the path.
Peering around the room, he noticed once again the layout mirroring his own room, but frowned. Although the room was fully furnished, it seemed Hari had very few worldly possessions. Taking another pass around the room, he spied an old framed photograph on his nightstand, Hari’s school trunk near the foot of the bed, and his broomkit near the wardrobe. His Firebolt, envied of all Quidditch teams, was not in sight. The bookcases on either side of the fireplace shelved a number of school books mixed in with older books from the library. The majority of his clothes destined for the rubbish bin or a ceremonial bonfire, sat in a heap by the writing desk. On top of a small side table near the wardrobe, piles of re-enlarged shopping bags. A genuine smile graced Draco’s lips.
Potter was standing over him, only in his dreams, grimly looking down at him as he bled to death. He knew this wasn't in his memory. In his memory Moaning Myrtle had yelled MURDERER at the top of her ghostly lungs, and Harry had scrambled towards him on hands and knees panicked and remorseful for what he had done. Not this cold version standing over him, looking down upon him as he bled out. This Potter wasn't the kind, caring, "Saint Potter", the Wizarding World's Savior.
They wheeled into an empty alley just a block away. Dismounting and unbuckling their helmets, Hari snickered at Draco’s attempt to fix his hair in the tiny mirror on the bike. “Would do you loads better, Potter, if you carried more about your appearance. You look like you just rolled out of bed with that pigeons nest for hair.” Draco chided.
Draco giggled again, “Oops.” Not even looking Draco reached back felt for the prick on the top right of the spiny journal and a drop of his blood opened the journal. "Wait," he said as he took back the journal, and writes something in hastily in shorthand with a quick-fill pen so he wouldn’t forget. It read:
your randy, possessive, alpha dragon wouldn’t possibly want to make a claim on his mate!” She said sarcastically. “I too was young and in love once, Draco.”   Narcissa look became far off and voice dreamy as if lost in a dream. “I loved your father, once. Passionately, deeply, and believed he felt the same way at one point. He was quite affectionate with me before my inheritance. Courted me properly, wooing me with high praises and gifts. Your father, when he put the effort into it, could be charming. And since we were not yet eighteen, we did not have
I thought for sure he would be expelled from school or get a detention with Filch at least. But instead he got appointed Seeker on the Gryffindor’s Quidditch team.  I, instead, am left looking like a fool and the villain. I have to resolve this rivalry fast.
Blinking hard trying to get the vision out of his head. '
Andromeda was speechless. Here she was in financial distress, home literally about to be taken away from her, and with no living family capable of taking her and Teddy in, and this man, really a boy, sneaks into her home and her life with an Invisibility Cloak, and offers her sanctuary like the hero and savior he is.
and the same piano in the empty portrait.
"DJ's about to kick him off stage." Alice says.
"Lets make a bet of it." Draco tried. "I bet you get first place."
"What?! When did we go on a second date." Hari exclaimed followed by a yelp and someone hissing, 'stay still you'll ruin the lines.'
"Hari Potter." Draco said smugly.
"A dragon?" His voice lilted at the end, turning the statement into a question. He was more focussed on Hari kneeling before him, hands now gently cupping Draco's white bandaged hand.
“You mean together?” At Draco’s pensive nod, he stood up and hesitantly mounted Draco’s broom, the Nimbus 2001 polished to gleaming perfection. Draco gripped the handle in front of Hari’s hands and swung up behind him, effortlessly securing Hari in place. The broom hovered for just a moment, before Draco pushed off and the broom obeyed his body's gentle command to climb higher.
A bit of Magic mixed with Muggle. Draco realized, Alleycat must be a wizard like him.
"No!" Hari shouted. "er...I mean. No, this isn't our first date. We went shopping together and Draco introduced me to gelato." Hari amended.
Andromeda caught on immediately. "Un alpha,
"Well if you ever have an inch, I'll hook you up with some private Draco time toys."
"Don't call the police, or social services, and don't come looking for me. I'll do far worse to you and yours if you do." Harry didn't like violence, but he didn't know what his magic would do when angry. Making his aunt believe he could hurt them, might keep them from following. Putting the purse back where he got it from, he ran straight out the door. In his mind he echoed Kass's goodbye.
"The only gaggle of geese I know who squawks too much, would be you Arlys after two glasses of Chardonnay." C'iemone replied to the eruption of laughter from the room.
watched his mother smiled serenely at him. “I know that you love him…I’ve always known. I wanted to tell you to be cautious, my son.”
His ears pricked up at that. The Dudley's never elected to take him anywhere, let alone to the zoo on Dudley's birthday.
Hari scratched his head, bashefull. “Well yeah. It wasn’t my gold to begin with. I talked to the chieftess in person weeks ago. Theft is not tolerated in any way at Gringotts. We agreed that the gold would be returned to its rightful owner, it was only the matter of the Ministry's red tape. Quite a few of your vault’s revenue is under investigation by the Ministry, but my gold isn’t and therefore, the gold I just returned to you, you have full access. You’ll find that even without most of your family's gold you’re still quite the spoiled rich prat I first met at Madam Malkins.”
It was early, he strained his ears listening. He didn't hear any movement from the room next to his. Good, Hari was still asleep and he could take a much needed bath. Leaving the windows open, he gathering his bathing supplies; shampoo and conditioner, bath oils, and soaps. He stepped out of his room trying to be quiet as possible, as he didn't want to alert his floormate he was up. It wouldn't be good to confront his long time crush, crusty and smelling like stale cum and sweat.
Suddenly, Draco’s hair was yanked out of its long tail and it fell like silk strands along his face. His eye’s widened in shock at the rough treatment.
Lucius Malfoy once more had the Voice Muting Jinx removed. His head was thrown back and his voice echoed in the chamber, “DEATH!” The jinx was immediately put back on him, with only that one word testimony, clearly it was going to spill into another rant.
Now that the information was dwindling, Narcissa could feel herself becoming more and more aggravated; the confined space pressing in on her enhanced senses. Narcissa was always proud of her inheritance; confident in her creatures’ blood, but now her instincts were working against her. She didn’t do well in confine spaces. A rustling sound of fabric drew her attention away from her mounting discomforts.
As the queue grew shorter and their destination nearer, Draco began having doubts. Not about entering Diagon Alley, but his other nefarious plans to sneak away from his mother and visit Muggle London. If his father had been with him, he’d never have the chance, and since he knew he’d get caught eventually, never again.
Draco now stood in in the shadows of the door eavesdropping.
“Are you daft, Potter? So, where are we going on our date?” Hari’s smile was infectious.
So, he ran away. But he wasn't a coward. No, his matra was 'live to fight another day'. He would use his new found magic, and cunning, and resourcefulness to survive. Because Harry Potter had ambition, alright. He was going to be something other than
Harry’s godfathers name drumming in his ears, Mrs. Black screaming, Kreacher’s wailing. Its too much. The sounds echo off the walls of Grimmauld Place, inside Harry’s skull.
I am not satisficed with this chapter, but if I have it on a saved draft another day it might as well be another week.
I will continue with these journal entries slowly.
Hari couldn't keep the teasing lilt to his voice. "And how would you know the difference between fresh parsley and coriander, Dudders?"
Hari stepped back, only to find that the door was gone.
Hari had the wildest idea that Dudley, his cousin and Cho Chang, a witch, were somehow dating. An introduction was best in order. But Hari and Cho stumbled over each other in their introductions.
Draco had fond memories of him when he was younger. Dobby was his constant companion. He was sad to hear his father let him go, just before the end of second year. He didn’t have much companionship that summer. Draco was pleased to find him employed of all things at Hogwarts.
"We had a picnic, it was lovely." Draco was handed a beverage with a straw.
Draco halted and took Hari's shoulders in hand, looking steadily into his boyfriend's eyes. "Blaise is my friend, Hari. He is not going to hurt me."
Taking that as the end of the argument, she jotted down the order and lumbered away gracefully on stiletto heels. Draco wasn’t disturbed by the patrons; he was simply baffled by how open these people were about their sexuality. The wizarding world was far too conservative and he would never have dared frequent this type of establishment on his own, homosexual or not. Draco heard whispers, of course, from some of the Dark Lord’s followers, of private Halls deep within Knockturn Alley, where the affluent could sate their darker sexual desires in relevant secrecy. It was a darker secret that even Draco didn’t want to know or seek ‘pleasure’ from.
It was a Ministry’s owl. The barn owl swooped down to present its letter to Narcissa, who accepted the letter and opened it with only a slight trembling of the hand only noticeable by her sister, Andromeda. Narcissa’s face blanched of any colour as her distress scent flooded the room.
He flipped a page, and paused. One hand trembled as he brought it to his own lips. “Hari, you released my gold back to me, already.” Draco said in wonderment as he looked at the notarized and signed statement by one Hari J. Potter.
“oh Merlin, Teddy!” Harry shouted, barely able to hear himself over the screaming of Mrs. Black’s portrait, admittedly who has been making a ruckus since he stepped in the door. But Harry could care less, he was too lost in his grief. How could he forget that he was named godfather? Teddy is little more than a month old and now he was orphaned, growing up to never now his birth parents. Teddy is just like Harry. “Just like me…”
Before Hari could let out another complaint, they were escorted out through the kitchen and back alley, which it shared with a neighboring Salon.
With rushed, good-byes and promises to meet again soon, they made their hastily retreat.
Slytherin won the House cup and Harry Potter was finally able to join us. Could this day have gotten any better?
When I told him what I heard, he told me to go back to bed, and that he would handle things.
"Yes?" Draco hummed out, breath caressing over Hari's face as he waited for a response. Pale fingers reached up to rest gently against one tanned cheekbone. His fingers were like ice.
"Wait...tsk...Draco, your family?!" Hari protested as he was lead away, looking back Draco's mother, aunt, and baby cousin. Narcissa was down on her knees, weeping into her hands and Andromeda kept a soothing hand on her shoulder.
“We went to the Manor. The Aurors took and categorized every dark artifact they could find; I helped break some curses on them. I found Father’s hidden ledgers. Mother… Father is involvement in the war even more extensively than we could have imagined. I found some discrepancies and went to Gringotts to try to resolve them. ”
Once up, Dudley halted Cho easily, to stick out his hand to Hari. "Well cousin, It was good seeing you. I'd tell mum and da, but I want the evening to be about me and Cho, so we are out of here."
Stay awesome!
“No problem.” She giggled. “I’ll be around to assist you when you need. Be sure to tell the sales associate at the front; that Candice assisted you and I’ll check you out.” She winked suggestively at Hari, and Draco fought to suppress the immediate wave of revulsion—carefully schooling his features blank.
Why is he sitting with a Weasley of all people? Father says they are a disgrace to the wizarding world; blood-traitors, poor, with no class. Obviously that Weasley, Rob was it, has no class. Ghastly red hair and he was rolling around in the dirt, and he ate like a starved man. Maybe he was. His parents being so poor, couldn’t possibly feed ten children, was it?  Father and Mon Mère was right, Molly Prewett, a pure-blood rare omega no right being a broodmare for a blood-traitor like Weasley. Mon Mère says it’s a disgrace to the Black name having all those children. It’s a good thing her line was disinherited.
“Well, shite!” He exclaimed loudly. “Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”
“You could go serve the Malfoy’s. You wanted to do that before the end of the war, right? The war is over, no need to worry about you revealing secret information to them now” Harry was nearly bipolar in his excited drunkenness, poor Kreacher could barely keep up with his sudden mood swings. One moment he is moody and depressed, then clingy and whiny, and the next he is a happy drunk.
At least; Hufflepuff won't do anything.
Draco said before switching back to English for Hari’s benefit. “Hari, may I have a word with my mother in private.”
------
Harry stayed as far away from the whispering duo as much as possible.
p.p.s. If you are able to floo in the future, here is my current location: Evoric’s Rising Sun Tavern. The innkeeper will ask for my room number; it’s 7. You’ll need a Galeon to pass through. Please try to say the correct address. We do not want what happened in Knockturn Alley to happen again.
I am stupid, stupid, STUPID!!!  The boy I was talking to in Madam Malkin’s was Harry Potter.  Severus always warned me that it is never a good idea to meet your idols, and that they would only disappoint you in the end. He was right!!! Harry Potter is nothing like how he is portrayed in the books and news articles from the Prophet and Witch Weekly. First off he is littler than I am. And Mon Mère says I have a fragile frame, but compared to me, Harry looks like a strong breeze could blow him over. His clothes are shabby and his black hair is a mess. Maybe he was raised by Giants and that is why he looks like that. The bruises, surely they are from being with the Giants. He didn’t get them the same way I got mine, right?  His bruises are easy to see, mine can be easily hidden.
"WAIT!" Kreacher shouted as he ran after his wayward master. Where are you going, your filthy and needs a bath." Harry looked down at himself.
We found what attacked the Unicorn. It was a tall black hooded creature, drinking the blood of the dead unicorn.
“Merlin’s balls Potter! You’re too tight, bare down, push back.” If Draco could just get Potter to relax some, Draco could continue without hurting any of them more than he had to. Potter wasn’t listening, tears poured down his face as he sobbed, his body twisting, trying to get away from the intrusion. Draco was able to drag Potter back by his leg, one time, before nearly getting kicked in the face by the other.
Hari coughed as dust made it into his airway and Draco could only stand astounded with jaw dropped. Hari felt the unexpected chuckle burst forth. Hearing the masculin laugh, Narcissa turned around to see her son and Hari back from their date.
impression of the room was still there. Three windows framed to nothing hung mid air, facing the east. The room's fireplace blazed hot in its usual corner, and yet all the furniture was still there.
Please contact our department at the earliest convenience for instructions on times for delivery of the precious remains and temporary access to the Estate Cemetery and Mausoleum.
When Draco remained silent, Hari got the engine going again, proclaiming. “Come on, I’ll have to shrink the bike. There is no good parking.”
"Awe...er...Andromeda, I have something to say that I forgot to mention before. I...uh...kinda broke into your sister's vault and stole an important Dark Artifact that needed to be destroyed in order to defeat Voldemort, and I can't say anything more about it right now...but see that giant hole in the roof, yeah...that was my escape route." Harry said in a rushed whisper.
Draco could definitely get behind this song. Muggle music, what he's heard of it so far was interesting, upbeat, and yes, fun.
As Kreacher made himself busy with the tea tray and scones, Harry fought his pounding headache as every scrape of the silverware and tink of the china felt like a team muggle construction workers drilling holes in his brain with jackhammers. The only consolation was he know longer felt ill just at the smell of the too buttery scones.
Harry stood at the door now fully open, he had his hip cocked, and chin raised high, he didn't have much height on himself, but he managed to give the impression of looking down at the men intruding on them.
Queen Boudicca flounced on stage. She had a wild tawny wig that contrast with her hard eyebrows and Goatee. Regardless, she rocked it with a colorful blouse that was partially obscured by cloak fastened with a heavy topaz broch. The only jewelry was a golden torc that weaved around her throat.
but he is so ignorant of so many of our ways, mother…I don’t want to keep secrets from him, but I am worried that if I tell him, he’ll back off, and then where will that leave me.” Narcissa smiled amused at her hormonal teenager.
Alleycat sat down with a plomp on a couch-esk cushion pile, dust dispersed into cloud around him. He flicked his bangs off his hot forehead momentarily, before they settled down, hiding from view the briefly revealed scar on his left side forehead over his brow.
"I'm trying to change, to be better." He looked at Hari. "When that demented thing came, or whatever Mum called it. It showed me the ugliest parts of myself...and that scared me more than death, to be honest. So switching schools, stopped smoking, changing the way I ate...it actually paid off for me, I'm healthier, I feel great, more energetic and less angry all the time. I stopped picking fights all the time. I'm co-captain of the Junior Heavyweight Boxing Team." Dudley looked at Cho once more. "And because of it, I got a chance to meet Cho-cho here. She's wonderful."
"Where indeed?" Minerva said with a huff as she exited the main offices of the Headmaster.
Arthur Weasley’s mother Cedrella Black married Septimus Weasley and had their lines blasted off the family tree. Molly Weasley née Prewitt’s mother Lucretia Black married Ignatius Prewitt and had their family lines blasted off the family tree. Draco Malfoy’s aunt Andromeda Black married a muggle-born Ted Tonks and had their family lines blasted off the family tree. Harry’s own ancestor whom he’s never known, appeared on the tapestry; Dorea Black married Harry’s Great-Great Uncle Charlus Potter, his Great Grandfather Henry's (Harry) brother, and for some reason their lines were blasted off the family tree.
Charm could fix.
Cho reached into a side pocket on her jumper and pulled out her wand. Laid it on the table.
“Connor,” Oliver shouted back. “We’re over here! We’ll cross when it’s clear!” Oliver said as he picked up his eleven year old daughter and dashed to his husband’s side once a clear path was made in the road.
Hari went pale. “I don’t know.” He remembered Gilderroy Lockheart in Saint Mungos, three years after his own memory charm backfired. “All she said was she altered their memories to forget her existence.”
“If you have to ask, then we have a lot of work to do.”
Hari looked at Draco in consideration, then out at the garden, one hand wrapped around his elbow in a hug, the other letting go of the handlebar to dangle at his side.
"If the headmaster is of need of my potion skills, I'm afraid I am needed elsewhere, urgently."
“That will be seven Galleons. Let’s con-tin-ue! Your old wand Mr. Malfoy, I do believe Mr. Potter is in possession of it. Is that right?” Mr. Ollivander turned his eyes on Hari once more. “This wand, not your wand defeated the Dark Lord.” Hari gulped while the other three occupants sucked in their breaths audibly. Hari handed over the wand in question. “Unicorn hair…yes, yes, no not suitable for the both of you at all. Unicorn hair is too
Potter snarled between clenched teeth, “Malfoy, what the feck do you think you are doing?” Potter struggled with his bindings, twisting to and fro only succeeding in adding delicious friction to a dick already painfully hard. Red blossomed in Draco’s cheeks and his eyes glazed over in passion. Potter stilled in his struggles, eyes going wide. “You…” He trailed off glancing down at the hardness pressed against his own flaccid penis. Draco watched Potter’s Adam’s apple bob, his slim throat constrict then loosen as he gulped.
Draco was in a rush to return to Hari’s side, but he had to stop and reapply scent blockers after he changed his clothes. The soaps used during his bath and the lotions he applied directly to his wet skin are from a high end scent blocker brand, ‘
The stranger featured softened even more, eyes turning sympathetic.
"Oh I can't watch him get the hook." Arlys says between her fingers.
The source of Alice's aggravation became apparent as they neared in the shape of a someone inside bussing the table and wiping up any spills. When he stepped out, he tweaked Alice's nose with an indulgent smile on his lips. He was tall with dark short cropped hair and amber eyes. Draco could see the family resemblance immediately.
Draco laughed, shoving Hari over, before standing up; effectively breaking the muffling charm. “You’re one to talk, Potter. Your face is the shade of a beet.” Draco laughed. “Let’s go, already.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Quickly swallowing so called cure, a foul tasting gray gunk, that reminded him of PolyJuice Potion, and the tiny mint flavored Pepper-Up potion. Holding his hand over his mouth and sayin, "Urk!" He felt like he was most likely going to throw up, rather than be cured. "Urk, Kreacher..now that I had that delightful wakeup call, what's a big day today?" Harry burped again.
Once more Harry panned his eyes around the room barely stopping over lamps, side tables, a couch, loveseat, and armchair, before stopping on the 88-key baby grand on the other side of the door. That was the same piano that Hermione was trying and failing to teach Ron Beethoven’s
Hari was examining the wand, familiarizing himself with its magic and his own. Examining the hilt he found an unusual symbol carved into it; a snake appearing to eat its own tail. Mr. Ollivander saw him examining the carving and spoke up, “Ouroboros symbolism of the serpent; snake or dragon, devouring its own tail symbolizes the cycle of the nature of the universe; matter can neither be created nor destroyed, creation comes out of destruction, life out of death, the Ouroboros eats its own tail to sustain its now life, in an eternal cycle of renewal.” Draco whom actually took Alchemy at Hogwarts understood the concept quite well, and was studiously happy to discover that he too shared a connection with Hari Potter’s wand, even if it was a design choice.
Hari watched transfixed as Draco swallowed him deeper and hollowed his cheeks providing suction. When Draco’s hand moved lower to fondle his balls, supernovas exploded beneath his lids.
“Yes, how can this unworthy of house-elves be assisting the Mistress and Master, this fine evening?” Squeaked the mousy doe eyed House-elf with a hemp sack for a dress pulled over her head.
"Alrighty, so four PC's coming up, one Sex n' D and a BGT." Emmet summarized. "Anything to eat to chase this alcohol consumption?"
"Well well well." Justin was saying past the ringing in Draco's ears. "Isn't this a surprise! Here I was dared by a couple friends to sneak into the gay club, when I happened to hear, you Malfoy call out Potter's name." Justin raised the camera in his hands. fiddling with the strap. "Now what would say...the prophet pay for a picture of the famous Harry Potter, our Savior snogging his enemy, the Death Eater Scum, in those get ups." Justin sneered.
“Oh, this is like a boyfriend’s shirt,” Hari said, jumping to conclusions.
Gotta start again
Justin's eyes went vacant as the spell took effect. He never stood a chance.

“You may be the Boy Who Lived, and have people constantly fawning over you. I can get past that. What I will not let pass is the Boy on a Date With Me allowing some bint to flirt with him whilst I’m standing right beside him.”  Draco said bluntly.
“I’ll pick out your outfit for now, and I will assist when we go shopping, too.” When Draco said ‘assist’, he actually meant ‘picking out a whole new wardrobe with very little input on Hari’s part.’ “You, Potter, really have no fashion sense. I’ve never seen anyone with such a lack of style in my life…” Draco paused, “Besides that weasel you hang out with, of course. It takes an expert eye to match with orange hair.” He shuddered, “The Chudley Cannons is a mediocre Quidditch team, and not even he should be so devoted to wearing the color orange as he is. In addition, someone should tell the Weaslette pink isn’t flattering with her hair.”  Hari clenched his teeth as he listened to Draco take jabs at Ron’s taste in Quidditch paraphernalia and Ginny’s preference for the color pink.
"Clicked off the bat?" Draco said confused. "I do no-oh. Oh no, we were sorted into rival houses."
Draco and Narcissa spoke in unison, “Sanctuary.”
My parents have told me that Slytherin is where I will meet my true friends.  I hope so. Despite protesting to my father, I share  dormitory with four other people. Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, ugg!!!! Why can't I get rid of them already. And Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott are also in my house.
Draco in his dragon form, preened under the praise with his seven foot tail whipping around him, and fourteen foot wings keeping him airborne.
Petunia didn't know what to do with another babe to take care of. She had her own son, and now she had Lily's son to take care of as well. She paced in her kitchen with lace curtains and clean countertops, thumbnail chewed down to the quick.
Wiping the wound with a no doubt unsanitary garment, he revealed the Dark Mark and a series of crisscrossing scars, some older than others. Most worrisome was the most recent and deepest cut located right next to the tendons of his wrist.
As for Hari, Draco knew that Hari came here to get away from everyone. To escape all that attention. He wanted a sanctuary, just like mother and he did.  Draco believed fiercely that Hari wasn’t ready for any of it, not even his friends.
"No need," Draco interjected. "He is worried about any letters sent to him or his mum being intercepted by the ministry. He told me the location and said he'll be there until 6."
Clearing his throat, disturbed by Draco's intense stare, Hari continued the tour, "This is the parlor, I don't know much in terms of entertainment so I imagine it'll be our common room of sorts. I don't mind food anywhere, so if need be you could eat in here, the kitchen, dining room, outside, hell even your rooms. Although I would like to set a good example for Teddy Bear and eat as a family as much as possible, breakfast and dinner, preferably."
The snake peered at Harry intensely, before opening its mouth, in what Harry thought was going to be a hiss.
I'm not much into health food
Kreacher appeared in front of them with a startling crack of a whip. "Master Harry, Master Harry. It's the new Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt. He's angry for not being allowed in sir, demands to speaks with you." Kreacher spoke up in a high pitched voice.
Hari wanted to protest, to rebroke, to pull his arm away before his arm socket was dislocated, but the sight of Draco's mask finally cracking and deep tear tracks lined his cheeks, had the words halting before they left his lips.
.  Hari either didn’t see the eye-roll or chose to ignore it. “They need sunlight, and water, and nurturing care to survive. You see, in order for them to thrive and produce more buds, the old dried up ones have to be cut away.”
"Don't master remember, sir...you go see your godson today!" Kreacher squeaked excitedly. "We discussed it all last night. Don't you remember, sir Kreacher is already preparing a nice room on the second floor, Mistresses old rooms, nice little area for a baby to stay with Mistress Andromeda."
By the time they were shoe shopping Hari was exhausted and begged for a break. His feet really did hurt and he was ready to drop. They were lucky to have shrunk down multiple shopping bags into one large one. They certainly couldn’t have ridden home on a motorbike, otherwise.
“Hari, I love you.” Draco breathed into his ear.. “You know that, right?”
"Death Eater scum, you called me." Draco said pseudo calmly. "Do you have any idea what I could do to you now?"
The man gave Draco a hard stare. "Sorry," Draco said raising his hands in surrender "didn't see you there." The man's eyes widened in what Draco recognized as recognition.
"Do you...I mean will you come with me?" Draco asked suddenly uncertain. "You don't have to like, speak to him, if you don't want. But I don't want to go alone..."
“You want me to use the baby voice.” Draco said, voice coming out as scared mouse. At Hari’s
Lifting Potter’s ass in the air and bent down to meet him half way. Rolling his tongue, Draco let saliva pool at the tip before leaning down to lick a stripe once across Potter’s asshole, swirled it around a few times, before gradually adding pressure to the entrance of his too tight passage and slowly slipping inside with his tongue. Tonguing Potter’s asshole open, he rolled his tongue and jabbed in as far in as he could, spearing him, jabbing in, before thickening his tongue, wiggling it in a wave motion, then flattening it out. Then repeating this processes a few time, Once satisfied that the entrance was adequately lubricated, Draco leaned back to peer at his handy work. Potter’s hole was rosy pink, twitching, and glistened nicely.
"No!" Draco said insistently. "It won't be anything deviant. I promise." Draco said raising his hand like a boy scout that Hari knew he wasn't. "I'm not, I promise."
What could have possibly possessed Madam Pomfrey to keep Harry Potter in the hospital wing for eighteen days. I didn't dare visit while he was conscious. The feast is ten days away and I want know why he gets to be excused from pointless classes that won't really have anything to do with this years grades. Our grades for the exams were posted today.
The first door they came across was the bathroom and next to the bathroom was a door with a sign, marked simply Draco.
"Dorea and Charlus Potter, yes I am aware of their names, but they were burned off the tapestry, disinherited as I was for marrying someone my parents didn't approve of."
Narcissa Malfoy née Black stood tall and willowy by her son's side, her attire all in black save a white and yellow gold broach at the hollow of her throat, a flower in the shape of her namesake. She stood stiffly and on guard. As her son, her complexion was pale like white porcelain, hair like fine silver, and eyes a pale and glacial blue.
“Lucius Abraxas Malfoy.” Draco couldn’t help it and held his breath, you are accused of High Treason, murder, being a Death Eater, supporting the Death Eater Regime, Imperiusing members of the Wizengamot and other Ministry officials, blackmailing said members, aiding and abetting He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, using the Malfoy Manor as headquarters for the Death Eaters Regime, funding the Death Eater Regime, torture, kidnapping…” The Prosecutor paused in his reading as if amused, “fraud, tax evasion, and embezzlement.” He tacked on at the end. Draco smirked at the listing of his father's crimes, knowing that he helped bring evidence for many of those charges against him and many other Death Eaters.
Harry opened his eyes to see the door of his cupboard slowly creak open on its own. Hope shined in his bright emerald green eyes, and a megawatt grin burst across his cheeks.
“Did you just make a joke,” Harry asked incredulously with a bark of laughter.
"No, Sirius...his FEELINGS". Hari shouted to be heard.
Draco kept his thoughts to himself, but his facial expression expressed it all.
The air whistled past their ears, and Hari closed his eyes, not in fear, no never in fear of flying, but in exhilaration.

Potter looked between their two bodies to see Draco’s large cock seated at the entrance to his anus. He paled, breath halting in his chest, body still as a statue, as if that would stop his progression. “Malfoy,” he spat, “don’t do this. I won’t tell if you cease what you are doing right now. No, stop.” Draco wasn’t listening to a word Potter was saying, the end destination to irresistible to cut the journey short just yet. He spat into his hands, rubbing them over his cock, pumping his cock a few times adding delicious friction, before his cock was maneuvered at the entrance once more.
had flooded the lawn in areas, causing puddles of standing muddy water, and it was no good for the grass or the roots of the plants. Some planters were tipped over, and soil spilt out in areas, and the grass was pulled up in some areas from the tussle. Magic garden or no, Hari had a bit of manual labor to add to the garden to make it right again. He didn’t mind, the mess, the extra work, nor getting dirty.
They went back up to their booth for drinks and to cool off, but Hari was soon jumping up and dragging Draco back down to the mesh of flesh. There was a pleasant blush to his cheeks.
Once more nearly knocked out by his words, and desperately trying to stop himself from gobbling him up. He covered up how flustered he was by joking. "Wow, Potter! If I didn't know any better, that almost sounded to me like a marriage proposal." And in Draco's mind his alpha was begging it to be so.
"Listen here, you..." He was slammed up against the brick wall and his mouth smothered a tanned hand. Draco glared and contemplated biting the boys hand. Then he remembered his father's tales and rethought his actions.
His uncle just rustled his hair, proud of his son pulling a tantrum. "Little tyke, wants his money's worth. Just like his old man." He boasted with a pleased grin on his face. Dudley ignored the praise in lieu of opening his presents. A racing bike...a new computer...six computer games...a video camera...a VCR, ah-nd a gold watch.
"So, what?" Draco decided to go on the offensive. "So I said I love you, it's not like I expect anything to come of it.”
""Oh Lordie, this is your first date and I just dragged you all in here. I’m sorry.” Alice interrupted abruptly from her position hovering over his nails with a mask over her nose and mouth. With a gentle touch, she applied black polish to his nails.
Hari squeezed Draco’s hand hoping he’d play along for the moment and blow his insecurities out of the water.
was a spell placed on all underaged witches and wizards that prevented pedifolia, succesfully preventing underage marriages and adults in authority preying on children, like educators or medical professionals. It also protected minors from juvenile alphas like himself, who couldn't yet control their alpha gene from preying on minors during rut season. Harry Potter would be safe from his unwanted advances, at least until he turned eighteen.
"I could just stay here." Harry hopefully chimed in. If he was left alone he could practice magic without fear of discovery. He could probably get away with it at Mrs. Figgs without her noticing. But to have the house to himself would be great.
If these predictions weren't enough- wards against Apparating and Disapparating are also in place: like most private residences, and public businesses.
"Awe then I guess you don't want to put up any of the Black portraits I took from the Manor and vaults, do you?" Draco asked, running his hand through his hair in an uncommon gesture of nerves.
Narcissa threw back her head and laughed outright. “
Draco gritted his teeth. "Watch it. You nearly pulled my hair out of its bleeding scalp!"
"The third, actually...I do!" Draco exclaimed a bit surprised.
Draco side-eyed the homeless Muggle and worried about catching fleas and mange.
"ABSOLUTELY NOT!" Both relatives answered at once.
The crowd roared their approval around Draco.
"Draco!" Hari panted out as he looked up into Draco's blown out eyes. Hari was raising onto his tiptoes when, a flash of light blinded them. Their arms raised to shield their faces from the on slot. Draco heard the tell tell clicking of a camera shutter. He growled in irritation.
And mother was the one who ran across the grass to throw herself at you, kissing you all over. I had to as well, of course." Draco said adjusting the lapels of his black dress robes with two quick tugs.
Jolting up, Hari scrambled out from beneath Draco, letting the blonde head bounce against the carpet.
Hari looked briefly around himself, remembering the parlour as Hermione had last seen it with the three of them sleeping on the couches and cushions in this very room only months ago. Hari really couldn’t blame her for not trusting his cleaning skills, having never shown her his skills acquired living at the Dursleys. He’d never liked being forced to do things he didn’t like and so one of his small rebellions had been a messy room. And of course, Hari hadn't had the chance to tell his friends how to properly spell his name. Ruefully he looked back down at the letter dated two weeks ago and read on.
"Wait, let's go back to the beginning..."
Draco took careful stock of the man, a Dryad inheritance, by the woodsy smell, as most Wand Makers were. His nieces Natalia and Sasha, he still didn’t know who was who, were both betas. Draco couldn’t smell woods on them. He was satisfied to know that they wouldn’t make it far in wand making.
Andromeda smiled mischievously. “If Draco can gather the correct HERBS!” Andromeda called out loudly, “then we can set them on the altar and cast the circle. After that it is a matter for ceremony, giving thanks, presenting our gifts as an offering to grant our manifestation. We’ll then burn the candles and keep them lit all day until the next ritual at noon, then dusk, and finally to the zenith moon. It is during the final ritual, the zenith moon, that the Black family will formally acknowledge you as master and head of the House of Black.”
Narcissa stepped forward with Teddy and settled him in Hari’s arms. Taking him, Hari’s Adam's apple bobbed as he gulped nervously. He felt the memory of the cold steal and the hot burn as a blade was drawn across his forearm. Shaking the memory he kissed the top of Teddy’s hair a neon green color now.
“Narcissa Malfoy née Black,” The Prosecutor began, “You are accused of aiding and abetting He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and Death Eaters, hosting Death Eater meetings in your home, and being married to a Death Eater.” Draco didn’t even think that last one was a crime, and looking at his mother, he thinks she thought the same thing. ‘What is that it?’ Draco might be able to get his mother off after all.
“Yes.” Draco was saying.
“Draco, I followed the road signs.” Hari said, confused that Draco didn’t know that. They did have road signs in Diagon Alley. Draco felt his face flush in embarrassment. Now that Hari mentioned it, he did see the signs at the corner.
Once in he discovered the skirt rode high on his waist and covered his navel, and it was quite short.
Draco dismounted removing his helmet and let his hair escape its tie and fly loose around his face in the late evening sun. Draco wanted to confess, but it was a very real possibility that Hari would reject him. Draco was scared of that possibility, because if he confessed and was rejected he would be forced to leave. His alpha roared in his mind,
Harry thought fleetingly  before guilt chased it away. It wasn't as if the crazy old coot deserved to break her leg while tripping over one of her numerous cats.
Uncle Vernon whipped his whole body around, not able to turn just his neck. His watery bitty eyes narrowed and teeth barred. "What are you planning, boi-ey!" He snarled lowly.
Harry's stomach grumbled and cramped with hunger pains. Holding his demanding stomach, Harry wished he could eat something so he could focus more. Harry knew that as punishment, he was going to go without meals for who knows how long. At least while in school, he was allowed a lunch. Sometimes during the school term that was the only meal Harry ate, if his cousin didn't steal his food. Harry considered himself lucky if he was fed on the weekends at all. But with his headmistress deciding to suspend him from St. Gorgory's Primary School for allegedly climbing school property, and it being so close to summer break, Harry knew he was going to stave unless he found a way to feed himself.
As the cold began to set in his bones, Draco recalled his mother’s words of advice. Although this kiss was not unwelcome in the least, magic worked in mysterious ways and the only way to get around
April 2020 Update: Chapter 13 will be updated on April 20th. I hope to also have chapter 14 up at the same time. Subscribe to receive notifications about when that will be.
"You can't use magic in front of Muggles, you'll have Ministry officials all over this club. You don't want that." Justin accused haughtily.
Then something scary happened. Harry's Nimbus started bucking out of control. Someone had bewitched his broom. It shouldn't have been possible, it had anti-jinx charms on it. It was in the brochures and the latest edition of Quidditch Through the Ages. But someone clearly had done it. A Slytherin? No it couldn't possibly have been a student. I searched the stands. My father perhaps. It had to be an adult witch or wizard. I looked for my father, but no he wasn't even staring at Harry, he had a steely eyed stare on me. I looked away as fast as possible. Back to the Quidditch pitch, to see Harry get bucked off his broom.
Hari looked at Draco with wide eyes, before bursting into wild laughter. "I don't know. Let's find out. This ought to be fun, am I right?" Draco blinked wide-eyed, before flashing a side ways smirk of his own, nodding his agreement.
I don't have time to be thinking about Harry Potter when I should be focussing on my studies. But just recently I've heard the trio making plans about the off limits wing on the third floor, and something about a fluffy creature.
Narcissa was well aware of her son’s infatuation with Potter. She maybe even encouraged it at times in Draco’s pre-Hogwarts days, purchasing him books about the mysterious savior who survived the Killing Curse, vanquished the Dark Lord, then mysteriously disappeared from Wizarding society. She would often walk by her son’s rooms and hear him talking passionately to his house-elf Dobby, who was assigned to take care of him, when he wasn’t with his tutors, learning French and Latin, accounting and business, mathematics, dark magic and potions, and Quidditch. Narcissa suspects it was Draco who had Dobby trying to protect Harry Potter during his second year. It was also Draco who instructed Dobby to rescue the prisoners in the makeshift cells in the cellar.
As each passed the altar, they took a long candle. Hari grabbed a blue candle with a faint glowing rune he couldn’t decipher. Draco chose red, Andromada green, and Narcissa yellow. When they stopped they each returned to their original trio of rings. Hari faced west, Draco faced north, Andromeda with Teddy faced south, and Narcissa, east.
Dear Journal,
That was until he spotted Hari and Draco. A look of almost fear past over his face. "How old are you?"
Trout grinned. "Yeah, so we got a deal, Alleycat?"
Just as he was contemplating getting up, a platinum blonde head appeared beneath a canopy of
“Okay, I guess we are doing this after all.” It wasn’t twenty minutes ago that Hari thought he had tried to commit suicide, after all. Draco’s already frail self-esteem couldn’t take it. He had to ask. “Is it the mark or the cutting that you flinch away from?”
Quick poll for the readers: will end on December 11, 2018
Hari looked over at Draco, “This was your father’s fourth and most consequential mistake. Voldemort didn’t want the public knowing that he has returned. He was using spies and subterfuge in the Ministry to slowly take over. But when your father failed once more, the prophecy being destroyed and I escaped capture, Voldemort was forced to make an appearance, and it was made public. Your father ruined Voldemort’s important war strategies, and you and your mother were made to suffer for it, as your father was currently out of his reach.” Hari had stepped closer to Draco, momentarily forgetting Bill was carefully analyzing the situation, as Hari stopped in front of Draco he raised his hand to cup Draco’s cheek. Bill’s eyes narrowed flashing golden yellow as he scented the air. “Voldemort took your freedom, your fortune, your home, your dignity, and was going to take your life. When you survived the war and the Wizengamot was surely going to send you to Azkaban, I had to do it; I had to save your life.” Hari’s eyes were impossibly big and sparking behind his black round rimmed glasses. Draco shuddered and flinched away from the icy burn on his cheek, his dragon roaring in protest at losing Hari’s touch. Bill noticed the movement and knew what it meant.
"It was coriander, sweet-um. "A Cho reminded Dudley before turning to Hari. "I don't have the same predigest as others. My mother is Muggle. And besides. Dudley looked so shy offering me suggestions, shuffling his feet..." Cho laid big starry eyes on Dudley and thought, overgrown puppy.
Hari had his arms secure around Draco’s neck and Draco in turn pressed Hari tight between he and the door; his hands vice-like on his waist.They traded kiss for kiss, and breath for breath until their lungs screamed for air.
No matter how he felt about the wizard, this was still Draco's father. This was the last goodbye.
"Narcissa is not her husband, if you had known her outside the families sphere of influence you would have seen her in a different light." Andromeda defended her sister faithfully.
“I owe so much to you, Hari.” Andromeda was saying. “I’ve never been that magically strong. I couldn’t have possibly finished three floors in such a short time without your aid.”
“Narcissa Malfoy, how do you plead?” The Prosecutor sounded almost kind. ‘What is going on?’
“Order up, my dears!” Sheryl startled the two who were immersed so much in their conversation that they didn’t notice the slow passing of time when the food arrived. Sheryl laid plater after plater on the tiny table until it was threatened to burst.
------
Deciding the coast was clear, Harry streaked out of the tiny space as quietly as possible and made it to the kitchen. He groaned when he reached the fridge. It had a padlock on it. So did the panty.
Dudley leaned forward angrily, "I am sorry for how my parents treated you! And I'm sorry for how I treated you! It was wrong and should have never happened. I've been seeing a therapist and discussed many ways about how to make amends with you, if I could ever find you."
“Here-here” Rang out among the patrons.
It was burgundy colored and the fabric was soft. But…it was still long sleeved.
"Dead." Harry replied. Nik saw the sadness flash briefly in the kids eyes, before it disappeared.
But how to control it. He didn't even know exactly what it was. I should be impossible. It was almost like magic, if magic existed. All the times these particular phenomena has occurred was when he was afraid. Could it be his emotions, were they only triggered by fear, or some other emotions. He was mortified by the sweater and hair cut, and scared for his life when he found himself on the roof, and was in mortal danger or at the very least in severe pain when he healed himself. And the vase? He didn't break it, but he deeply wished it was fixed.
Bill Weasley froze upon seeing Draco Malfoy seated with Hari Potter eating breakfast. Forcing a stiff smile he greeted the room, “Morning. Ah, Hari what is
Hari scrambled up, and Draco reached up to stop him afraid he had taken his teasing too far. Hari only swatted his hand away and proceeded to strip his nightshirt from his body. He only wobbling slightly, inhibited by alcohol. He didn't fall and Draco's breath froze in his chest.
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
"Corbeau
Hiya all,
which might have upset his poor godson.
“I presume you said you wouldn’t be caught dead walking next to him, or the like. Those are words you say to your affluent, Slytherin friends who would appreciate your keen eye, not our sweet Hari.” Narcissa advised.
“Grant us wisdom of your ancient self. Allow us to borrow the bounty of your womb, and ground us in the strength of your stones, for the dawn of tomorrow.” She actually finishes on a whisper as her candle flickers gently to life.” Sighing gently, she gingerly placed the candle in the southernmost position. She carefully rolled a salt crystal through her fingers, patiently until it crumbled like sand to the cauldron.
That statement clicked with another revealed by Ollivander. 'I've wondered if it would be the same.'
"Well that's all going to change soon. I wrote that letter to Kingsley. I hope he owls soon. I was never very good at speeches or letters before, will you read over my draft I prepared for testimony? I don't think I can make it in person."
Draco quirked an eyebrow. “whatcha got, good?” He said as he sudley hid his now white bandaged hand from view.
"I'm ringing this table out. You can stay of course, but tonight the bar is closed on this table. I can't lose my liquor license and if anything happens to a minor while under my care, I could lose my Visa, not to mention, my daughter."
Hari snorted at the absurd response. He thought about calling him out on his bullshit. Hari knows what scars from a dragon attack looks like, bearing some of those scars himself.
"Trout?" Harry asked a little uncertain.
Draco followed Hari hungrily with his eyes until his mother kicked him with the sharp point of her toes. “Owe.” He exclaimed as he rubbed his abused shin, glaring at his mother and aunt who both mocked him joyously with their mery titters.
"Don't worry he's not going to eat you. He doesn't eat things bigger than him right now."
The first time was after the end of Sixth term, my mind linked once more with Voldemort; he was torturing Charity Burbage the Muggle Studies Professor at Hogwarts. This was a test of loyalty for Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape as they both knew the professor and colleague at Hogwarts. He tortured Professor Burbage in front of the two, killed her, and then fed her remains to Voldemort's Familiar, Nagini. The Malfoy was reunited as promised by Voldemort, but the youngest did not look happy, he looked terrified. The death of Dumbledore did not have desired effects; they found themselves the lowest rank viewed as weaklings and failures. Voldemort went as far as to completely degrade Lucius Malfoy by relieving him of his wand. The once proud pure-blood was now wandless and magicless in his own home.
"We haven't spoken in person in over twenty years. We use to send secret letters back and forth, once or twice a year. I was disinherited. I lost my inheritance, my dowarey, my family. But when the Dark Lord rose to power again, they stopped. I haven't written to my sister in about three years. It's too late to resume contact anyway." Harry looked up questionly at the last part. "The whole Malfoy family was arrested for being Death Eaters."
And so only stuttering a few times in the beginning, not expecting he would have to speak with the Minister of Magic in person instead of by owl, Harry launched into an impromptu speech on how Narcissa Malfoy and her son Draco Malfoy should have all charges dropped against them. When he was done, apprehensive about his success, and out of breath and painting; Harry waited expectantly for Kingsley response.
The announcement was met with gasps around the room. Hari rushed over to encircle Draco’s neck with a hug from behind. “I’m sorry.” Hari spoke softly into the nape of Draco’s neck.
Hari wanted to protest violently,
The front door opened soundlessly, revealing the
"Well, say something." Hari demanded of Dudley, "She's like me. Are you alright with your girlfriend being what she is, a witch?" Hari practically snarled. "Or would you have her locked away, hidden in a broom cupboard, maybe?"
“Don’t say nonsense, boy!”  Hari winced. He knew that the tall black man in drag didn’t mean anything by calling him boy. It’s simply the fact that men in his life have the habit as using it derogatory or dismissive manor, as if his age meant adults had the right to keep vital information from him. Albus Dumbledore used it, and it made Hari feel the Headmaster was using fake compassion and empathy to manipulate him, and of course his Uncle Vernon used it to express his authority over Hari. Nonetheless, Hari shuddered at being addressed as boy. “Not knowing how to address a fine specimen like myself can be forgiven, turning down free food, now that’s an insult to my cooking and me. My name is Sheryl, you can call me that or Mama, on the account I protect this area like a mama bear defending her cub.”
All he wanted to do was lock himself away from the rest of the world so he could spend the remainder of his pre-rut in peace. Or as his alpha kept suggesting not so gently in the back of his mind, drag Hari into his room and ravish him.
"Your horrible, why are we even dating." Hari bemoaned.
"Who was that, you mean. And that was Mad Dog. He's..."
Draco was still there. He was still ticked off at Hari, but for now that emotion was slowly being washed away by fascination. The invisibility cloak fit his frame perfect; he didn’t need to stoop or anything. It didn’t hinder any of his senses, either. He could see around him perfectly, he could hear every word Hari said, and annoyingly enough he could smell Muggle London. He clenched the cloak tight to his body, wishing that he could make out Hari’s scent. He imagined it would be just like Hari were scenting him, the invisibility cloak like a tight embrace, engulfing him in his scent. He took a deep wistful breath, smelling only laundered cloth and the faint smell of snow.
Bill stood there taken every verbal blow Hari threw at him. Hari’s message was slowly sinking in and deflating his ego. Draco stood in the background both stunned and proud that Hari was standing up for him. He smirked gloatingly at Bill, whose shoulders tensed up once more at the sight.
When she made it to her destination, she was puffing in air. She knocked impatiently on the door. Then did it again when there was no answer. With another huff of breath she shoved the door open.
The day wasn't even over yet, and Harry was already exhausted. Harry swears the goblin running his cart went on an extra long roller coaster ride, that at age eleven he thought was exhilarating but seven years later, thought it was some kind of sick revenge for what happened a few months past. They stopped first at vault 689, his trust vault with Bill's instruction took multiple bags of gold galleons to be exchanged for muggle pounds. Before he left he hunted the vault for what the Chieftess had told him to find; his birth certificate. He found it packed away in a small trunk with dragonhide bound journals, his fathers, and muggle composition notebooks, his mother's. He took the whole trunk with him and didn't open it again before Andromeda and Teddy were settled in their new rooms.
"Themed night?" Draco asked.
Before the Winter holidays, Malfoy purchased a dark artifact, and used the Imperius Curse on Katie Bell to compel her to deliver a cursed necklace to Dumbledore. In doing so, Katie Bell accidently grazed the dark artifact with her bare hand, and went into a coma. She almost died and was not able resume classes for the rest of the term. Before Valentines Day, he then poisoned spiced mead that was meant as a gift for Dumbledore, but he put his trust in the delivery of the poisoned mead in the hands of Professor Horace Slughorn, whom either by design or absent mindedness forgot to deliver the gift. Instead, he allowed a very good friend of mine, Ronald Weasley to sample the mead and was subsequently poisoned. If we were not in the Professor's office at the time, and I had not remembered that Professor Snape had once told the class that a Bezoar would cure most poisons, he would likely be dead.
"You were taking too long, and I have Bill Weasley, you know the Curse-Breaker that works at Gringotts coming over later in the morning to get rid of the spectre on the ground floor entrance hall, that Mad-Eye put up as a defense during the war. Sorry, I couldn't wait any longer. I still have to cook breakfast, and we are going into Diagon Alley later." Hari gave his one breath explanation in a rush.
"You two have I.D. showing you are both 18, Laddie's." The bouncer said with suspicion.
Hari went to slide his new wand into his back pocket, when Ollivander cleared his throat. "Perhaps I can suggest an arm or thigh sheath for your wand?"
All Andromeda could do was take Teddy and place him in a bassinet, hold Harry tight and rock him in her arms; shushing and whispering her forgiveness, and trying to explain that it wasn't his fault, or that there was nothing he could do. Tears fell from her own eyes, finally accepting the death of her husband and daughter, and no longer wondering what happened to them. Andromeda's emotions were like that of a bone with a clean break, that could now mend with time. Emotions still raw with the loss of so many people she held dear, she had some idea of how Harry felt.  Harry didn't have a clean break, and it would take longer for his mental and emotional injuries to heal.  Andromeda vowed to help this broken boy heal.
"Anyway, rival houses," Draco continued. "We didn’t get on at all. Not in classes, sports. Hell, we even duel--got into fist fights a few times. Left a few black and blue, and bloody. I’m surprised I wasn’t expelled a few times over."
(See the end of the chapter for
His excursion took longer than thought, but he finally made it outside and over to the trio of tables with perfect view of Draco's corner. Settling down, he dug into the bags and began to open them eagerly.
“What’s it to you, the Manor is ours, we are not prisoners in our own home as before. Are we?” Narcissa shot back with a hard glint in her eyes from diamond shaped pupils. A silent threat, she didn’t need to hide from anyone now that her son had presented. She'd need to teach her son control. These two Aurors are betas and weak; Narcissa and Draco may not have any wands, but they still had talons and fire.
The lights flashed all as one, in quick succession and the music muted. Draco's ears rang in the silence. The second set was about to begin. Hari and Draco exchanged looks. Draco excited, Hari mildly nauseated.

Holding tighter, praying Hari wouldn’t object, Draco trailed his nose down Hari’s neck and breathed into it. Would Hari allow it? Was he even able to with
Draco eyes popped open wide in incredulous before narrowing. His thick eyelashes shaded over grey. “You do with me.” Draco knew he sounded like a hypocrite for all the times he’s asked, begged, and demanded kisses of his own from Hari over the past several days.
He left a bruising lovebite at his pulsepoint, before soothing it with a lavish of his tongue.
Hari snickered as he listened to Draco's breathing finally settle into a sleepy rhythm.
He moved more hangers around and then pulled out an item. “Look at me…” When Hari did as asked, Draco held a garment up to him, and then put it back.  He did this a few more times. “Your skin tone is completely different from mine, but I must have something to…ah-ha!”
Opening his eyes he gazed blurrily outside the clouded glass. Somewhere beyond the glass was the lion clawed bathtub that Draco lazed about in for upwards to an hour each day. He remembered the time he inadvertently walked in on his bath to piss then again to take his own shower.
She paused as if to interject with her finger raised in the air, and then shrugged it aside, choosing instead to go back to her own warm bed instead. They were already on their landing, anyway.
The house was decorated with multicolored lights and red poinsettias. The house smelled like cinnamon and spiced wine. Gentle crooning Christmas music was playing throughout the house. Everything was perfect.
"Now, let me hear it for, Queen Boudicca singing from the Queen of Pop, Madonna, '
You wouldn't even know that there was a fourth occupant of number 4 Privet drive outside school records and dusty social workers files, of course. Not most neighbours, nor work colleagues.  In the house that he didn't call home, he lived like a dirty secret hidden in the broom cupboard beneath the stairs.
He stood up and gnawed on his thumbnail as he paced in tight circles, the limited space on the floor preventing him from going far.
Her papa strokes her hair fondly, recognizing that far off glazed look in his daughters eyes.
“Well...that is an...unusual dream you had, Hari.” Narcissa said, sharing a meaningful look with her sister and son. Draco scowled as he traced the woodgrane on the wooden table.
You are all so amazing and supportive. I am nearly to 1K subscribers.
Gasping, body shuddering from the aftereffects of the intense orgasm, Potter couldn’t move even if he wanted to. Breathing heavy, cock heavy and curled up to touch above his navel, Draco smiled manically down at Potter. Grasping Potter’s ass, dragging him closer to Draco’s desired destination, he lifted his legs over his own shoulders, bending Potter nearly in half.
"What" Sirius asked confused.
Dudley's shoulder's squared. "After we left Surrey, I had to transfer schools. The dietitian on staff, suggested it might be good for me to take up the Culinary Arts. If I was actually cooking the food it might encourage me to eat healthier. A change in diet as well as the natural exorcise I got in the ring, I lost over 54 kilos if you haven't noticed."
Hari was very pissed at the audacity of these two witches. It wouldn’t do to blow up the shop in his anger, so he tried to grin but it may have fallen short to just a grimace. He really wanted to send a stinging jinx at the two witches. “No, no…I won’t need your services. I only require service from Mr. Ollivander. If he isn’t available now, I’ll have to come back another day.”
They are now in the lead for the Inner-house Quidditch Cup.
Narcissa says wisely
Hey all,
that added edge to the overall look. He imagined that if he were to allow his dragon to manifest to the surface and grinned with a sharp toothed grin.
Now I just have to see her off.
“I don’t think I’d take such abuse. Why didn’t Sirius take her down, or Dumbledore. Or any of the Order members, for that matter?” Draco asked.
Sheryl didn’t bat a fake and heavily mascaraed eyelash at the unique seating arrangement and just accepted it, although there were about five empty tables between him and the nearest patron. She went on explaining the rules of the challenge that she just made it up on the spot. “The rules are simple; order two large entrees,“ Sheryl winked suggested at the now blushing boy, “three large side dishes, and a large beverage. Non-alcoholic for you. Finish the entire meal in one sitting, the meal is free and your name is placed on the Hall of Fame. Don’t finish the meal, you pay, or in this case you work off your meal in the kitchen, and get to take the leftovers home. Deal?” Sheryl asked, holding out her dark, golden bangle clad hand to Hari to shake. Hari took the offered hand.
When I left, I did take one of his books. What luck, it had that note in it.
“He only got off because you testified for him!” He needed to drill that into Hari’s thick skull. “He still did horrible things, criminal things. He took the Mark, for one, and fought on You-Know-Whose side of the war. ” Bill tried to reason with the very angry green eyed boy in front of him. He just couldn’t see how Hari could defend Malfoy after how he was treated in school by him.
“I’d say from the state of this room, a pig was living in this sty. What happened here?”
"I will be fine, once you tell me what you are doing waking up my grandson at this early hour," the hour only being ten in the morning and not so early, but Andromeda was up all night, so the hour really didn't matter, "then you assault me with a workman's tool! Now WHAT DO YOU WANT!" Andromeda really didn't mean to scream the last part, but her shoulder was throbbing, her eardrums ached, and Teddy just wouldn't-stop-crying!!!

“Pure-blood upbringing has a more extensive education than yours. My earliest education before Hogwarts included Greek and Latin roots, to help with spellwork. Ellios is the God of the Sun, so Eliana would mean, daughter of the sun. My own Owl is named after the Greek Goddess of the hunt-Artemis. She is a Great Horned Owl.” Draco says puffing out his chest, clearly proud of his owl.
"As I said before the Malfoy's are a mute point. If they all go to Azkaban, you keep the remainder of the fortune in your vault. If they somehow are found not guilty, then they can fight for the gold that is rightfully theirs."
"What? Kreacher...what happened to you...you look..you..." Speechless, Andromada trailed off.
Sweeter than honey
"Was that really necessary?" Cho snapped before she rubbed her hand up and down Dudley's arm, giving soothing words of comfort to Dudley who had blood
"Rule number seven, have fun!" three of the six chorused with Sheryl leaving Hari and Draco out.
They both stood there a moment, each holding onto the basin with the delicate flower floating on water. Narcissa came closer with Teddy who starred with fixation on the pink flower. If he were a few months older, Hari was sure those stubby hands would be reaching to grab the delicate flower. As it were, Narcissa swirled away with a tinkling laugh, the movement causing Teddy to let out a surprised happy squeal.
"Thanks mother. For those very encouraging words of advice." Draco drawled out sarcastically.
Draco thought. Then he saw the giant wooden shepherds hook. "Potter, you want me to win that bet? Potter. Get your arse moving already. I want another drink in this next centaury."
Sirius just stared for a moment, before bursting out in wild gales of laughter and tears streaming down his face. He was holding his belly, "Good one Prongslet. You really had me there for a moment." He said wiping a stray tear from his eye.
Uncertain now Hari licked his lips, “I was told this already…”
After Hari gave the Malfoy's a tour of their new home, they sat down to eat breakfast as a family. For some reason he was more nervous, sitting down trying to come up with small talk than he was giving the tour. And so he sat tense at one end of dining room table with Teddy gurgling happily in his arms. Teddy was done being fed, burped and changed, and he didn't apparently want to go down for a nap, so Hari was currently using him as a shield so he didn't have to interact that much with Draco who was beginning to unnerve Hari some with his intense staring.
Harry rubbed his eyes tiredly his brow furrowed in thought as he tried to hold onto the dream he had while asleep. He had been riding on a motorbike one cold evening through the sky over London.
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
. He wouldn’t know the first thing about Muggle entertainment.
Draco's eyebrow twitched but otherwise gave nothing away. "I'll do it."
There it was again; that heart racing, stomach jumping feeling just from remembering the words spoken by a very drunk Draco. Would Draco even remember the drunken confession when he woke up? Hari strained his eyes trying to see the clock hanging on the wall behind the door. It was pass four in the morning, and there were only a few more hours before the sun rose and Hari would have to make good on his promise to return the journal by breakfast.
His mother's and aunts secret conversation spoken in French is what drew Draco out of his panic. "
"I haven't any money," Harry lied. He had some money, but he was saving it for emergencies. like customer restrooms in which he had to buy at least one item to use.
To Draco’s surprise, Hari didn’t immediately explode. “Huh, that makes sense. “ Hari instead paused with consideration. “The twins were a handful, always pranking people. Who knows what they could have done if allowed magic. They did more goofing off than helping when they did turn of age. I don’t really know about Charlie or Bill, seeing as they moved out by the time I met the family.” Hari said, not unreasonably.
"He'd want to. He's sentimental like that. I had him pick up Harry after the Potter Cottage was destroyed in Godric's Hollow all those years ago." Dumbledore tried reasoning.
Then again, how much suffering could he take before he lashed out anyway and left? He could just chop it up to them having too much bad blood between them to live healthily together. Draco wasn’t worried about his mother being forced to leave in that case. Hari said that they were there because Teddy needed family, that wouldn’t change with him gone.
on the desk the Bogart hid in. It was too much for Harry. Wand slipping from fingers gone blue and numb, Harry collapsed in a heap on the floor.
Draco’s dragon crooned.
"Is it because I am drunk that I find Malfoy attractive, or witty, and caring?"
Hari J. Potter
If the Eighth Years are allowed to return, certain accommodations will have to be met for those with manifest creatures’ blood and navigating with the alpha-omega dynamics. Mandatory ABO Sex education classes for the Eight Years would have to happen the first week of school, a task usually set aside for the parents and guardians. Now Hogwarts would have to include unisex dormitories, individual rooms for mated pairs, and heat and rut rooms for the Eight Years. Not to mention alphas and omegas would have to be excused from classes and homework for the three to seven day heat and rut cycles. And some other school rules would have to be relaxed; like curfew, and allowing students off school grounds outside Hogsmeade Village weekends to visit Heathouses.
Gryffindor, fucking took the House cup right from beneath our noses. Stupid Headmaster! Always wanting to manipulate the whole system.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Harry began.
"You left...left a...a window open. hahaha!" Draco began to laugh and fell back against the couch cushion. For the average wizard, the item summoned had to be within sight of the summoner for the charm to work. Hari Potter was not an average wizard after all. Only Hari Potter would shrug off his accomplishments so easily. Salazar, Draco loved this extraordinary boy. Hari sniffed and didn't bother dignifying that with a response as he heard a clicking sound as the phial of dittany zipped into his hands.
