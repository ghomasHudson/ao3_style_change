In answer she slithers forward, and with a look of concentration opens a small, snake-sized green portal, reappearing behind me.

I coo internally. He gets even cuter when he stutters.
Griphook takes a deep breath after answering all of my questions in almost one breath, then adds, almost as an afterthought,
” she replies, striking. The green stone cracks, letting out an unearthly shriek, and everyone flinches.
“Nope,” I say, popping the ‘p’ slightly.
He smiles sadly at me. One of the others calls out in Gobbledygook and the goblin I was speaking to motions me to follow. I wipe the blood from my eyes and follow.
panic attack?”
“We think he probably made more than one, knowing his obsession with immortality. Tom Riddle is the name that the Dark Lord was born with.”
and groans
“Are you dating anyone?”
“ ‘M fine,'” I reply groggily.
I shrug. “I didn't want to break your concentration by screaming.”

I tell Hermione that I’m Draco’s Mate right after I get to class, but I ask her not to tell Ron because I don't want him to blow up in class. She agrees, knowing how Ron can be sometimes.
A houself pops in and he instructs her to get breakfast ready, then after lots of cajoling and a kiss on the nose he finally gets Draco up. They all head down to the dining room, where Missy laid out pancakes, and settle down to eat.
“Albus...” I let my voice fade away, we’re at the top of the Astronomy tower.
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
“Y-you’re my M-mate, Potter,” I whisper meekly, bracing for rejection and ridicule. After all, Like Father always says, Malfoys are not Subs, they are supposed to be Doms. Who would want a pathetic Malfoy Sub?
I give him a blank look. “If that is all, Headmaster, may I return to class?”
If you want to hear it, here’s the lullaby Draco sings. It’s called Au clair de la lune.
She gasps. “He-”
I sit up, careful not to wake my sleeping Mate.
I smile softly. “Hey Baby, we gotta get up now.”
I’m called up to the Headmaster’s office three days later. I didn't have time to tell Harry, so I’m alone, and I’m scared. Harry cannot protect me if he’s not here. I push open the door reluctantly. My Father is standing stiffly beside one of the chairs and Dumbledore is sitting behind his desk.
“Isn’t Professor McGonangall the Headmistress now?” I ask, wondering why she wouldn't change the password.
I take a deep breath. “He’s r-really powerful, and I’m just so scared. Even Mother couldn't do anything.”
“Of course, Master Potter”
When we leave the Hall I reach out and graze his ear with my fingertips without thinking. He shivers and turns around, but I blend back into the crowd. We spend the rest of the day thinking about Draco Malfoy. Hermione keeps on telling us how rare Nekos are. Ron keeps on insulting him. I can't stop thinking about him. His ears and tail. The tingly feeling that went through me when we locked eyes.
“They got together as well.”
With that out of the way I get the goblin who brought me here to take us to Stoneye. I lift Draco up again, making him yelp in surprise, but he lets me carry him.
I concentrate on not growling. “I did my research. I know what to look for.”
I am doing homework in the library when Harry comes in. I try to ignore him and do my work as quickly as possible. I leave as soon as I am done, heading to the dungeons. I feel someone tap my shoulder and whip around to tell them off. It’s Harry. I close my mouth and look away.
“Come in!”
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
When I wake up everyone is crowded around my bed, looking worried. Draco is holding my hand again.
but I don't say it. I can practically feel the Hufflepuffs confusion. Why wouldn't my Mother trust the Headmaster?
“Little”
“Could I see Mr. Malfoy out in the hall for a moment please?” he inquires, as if he hadn't been warned by both my Mother and Mate that he wasn't to speak to me alone.
“Why can’t you speak to Harry, Professor?” I ask blandly.
After classes are over I stand up and grab Ron’s wrist, pulling him out of the closet. We head down to the common room and I ask around, finding out that Pansy and the others are in the Potions room. Almost as soon as we come in Pansy announces that we are dating.
“Well you're mine now, he can't do anything much,” he says protectively.
“There’s more to it, Darling. Press the snake’s eye and it’ll enlarge into a bracelet in the same style, then if you press it again you get a emerald silk choker with a snake hanging from it. Another time and you get a necklace with a snake pendant wrapped around the chain like it’s a branch, and once more turns it back to a ring,” I explain. “I hope you like it.”
I raise my eyebrow and he sighs.
” she hisses expectantly, and I close my mouth. She seems trustworthy enough, she killed Voldie after all.
“Brother,” the twins say, sitting across from us where Ron was.
Theo and Hermione head off to the library to study, and when Theo returns Pansy grins.
“Can you give the test to Draco and Cleanse him if there are any harmful Potions or Spells? You can take it out of the Potter Vaults.”
Maybe Draco had only seen that too - Ginny’s fearful face reminded him how attached the two were even in school. A floating chair, some blinking lights and some structural damage shouldn’t scare off Ginerva (he’d seen the woman angry and fierce and not backing down). Yet she’d fled. It wasn’t as if Draco was on terms with Potter even these days. Cordial chatter only about their sons. Anything else started bickering back and forth and near-duels that destroyed something nearby. At times, Draco avoided speaking to Hermione knowing her schedule enough to know Potter would be somewhere nearby. It was difficult to redeem himself, in anyone’s eyes, if he was picking a fight with Potter every second.
“I thought he might have lied and you--”
And there sat a message from Harry, from a few months ago.
“Bloody hell, do we have mice?”
This Healer seemed much more obliged to deal with Scorpius’ worry, Harry’s hovering and Draco’s scowl. Perhaps it was the experience he had? Either way he spoke very calm, and in turn the news didn’t sound too bad. Not even has he was fitted with a strange brace – upon fitting, it hurt and once the pain settled, the relief was immeasurable. He hadn’t even noticed the way his muscles were cramping and tensing to keep the scar at bay.
“Crups are wizard companions, Potter. Purebloods are their favourites by nature. Although, if I were to say I wanted one of them then they’d be quite happy to walk outside and tear anyone apart who tried to stop it.”
“I haven’t proposed marriage, have I?” Harry spluttered his first sip of tea and Draco laughed at the coughing fit and the flailing. So, it was nothing legally binding in the Muggle world. He only knew of the oaths and whatnot of older Wizards and Witches that liked to make sure loyalty was followed through on. But really, had Potter never shared anything with Ron or Hermione? Blaise practically stole his pumpkin juice at Hogwarts every dinner.
Draco went back to the Manor and immediately left it when he arrived. There wasn’t anything here for him and ever since taking Scorpius away, the Manor lay quiet. He was curious on one aspect of Harry’s life. Was his Home Away From Home not warded at all?
Oh. Right. The Real Reason. Draco was slow to open up, going so far as to introduce the Rings of Celius first, noting they were destroyed as the first fact about them. And draco would pepper his answers, jumping back and forward in time of his life - from Hogwarts, back to going to the Quidditch match and feeling unsafe - then back to Blaise and Theo.
Hiding away and licking their wounds, slipping to and from the Muggle World might’ve been okay before but not now? For the Wizarding World, they never mattered to the other. Maybe it would be smarter, wiser to move through this slower than before. When they were found out, a shitstorm would be plastered on every rag in the country.
“Scars?” Her eyes were wide and wild.
Maybe they made a few decent inventions every few centuries. He never had much time to watch Muggles. They seemed… like funny looking wizards and witches, he supposed. Minus the horrid fashion sense; why was everything so tightly fit?
“Hello, again.” He spoke to the grave, adorned and decorated with several smiling and laughing pictures of Astoria, her favourite flower in purple sat fresh against the stone too. Draco was happy to see the Château still looked after the grave even after all the years of his parents being here, not caring for it. (‘Malfoys belong in the Mausoleum, not out back,’; ‘She was hardly a Malfoy’). It was her favourite place in the world and Draco had buried her there and couldn’t care less about his parents complaints to it.
A stiff and unpleasant clap of the head later, Draco hooted. It would seem this might be easier than he first thought.
“I can’t, I can’t tell anyone.” Harry lulled away to sleep again, closing his eyes as Draco’s hands disarmed him once again. “I’m supposed to be the good guy.” He tried to make a joke. Like this wasn’t serious. Like this wasn’t a big deal. Like he’d get out of it. Like he’d done this before.
“You try anything here it’ll be in the Prophet by tomorrow.” Draco wasn’t even sure himself if he was goading Potter or reminding him. Harry tutted at him.
“No. Grasping at straws.”
Ouch. Draco scoffed, he was certain she would have made a wonderful Slytherin.
“Don’t suppose you know runes as well as everything else?
“I have no idea. That depends on you.” Draco knew he sounded tired then and Potter noticed - and he offered a sympathetic smile that Draco ignored, “You don’t need your wand. Just put your hand on the soil and don’t move away or resist the draw.” Draco started pushing the rest of the earth back and once it was filled, he motioned Potter over.
“I’m sorry.” Draco blinked at Harry’s imploring words. This wasn’t fair. Why was Harry, looking at him as if he was the bad guy, as if Draco had done the harm?
“Get out,” he said and Lotty whimpered an apology and fled to Potter. He hadn’t left his room since leaving Draco on the floor. The childish thing was that he wasn’t even angry, not at them; this sickening weight that made it difficult to swallow and breathe. Like Katie Bell, the guilt was thick and slimy, sticking in his insides and making them squirm.
“Beaters and Chasers first, then Keepers then Scorpius’ll be up.”
It was switched on and Draco flinched at the sound. Was Potter trying to deafen him? And-- was that warm air? Not just temperate like a tepid British summer but so hot it was a might uncomfortable against his skin. Muggles were a strange, innovate lot. This wasn’t too bad.
“Why do you keep staring at me?”
“Small. Snappy.” As if to illustrate the point, Decimus yawned, squeaking as if its jaw needed oiled, showing off its fine teeth. “I don’t think it likes me much.”
In part he was glad, so glad and relieved the idiot was even trying to undo the damage for the sake of himself. Draco sighed. Harry leaned against him like he needed him to keep standing.
“You argued for me not to.”
Yet he got another – less acrobatic and more through his bullheaded approach to Quidditch. Him and the Seeker from before, the short redhead, kept elbowing each other. It was only the extra few inches which gave it to Scorpius.
Thwump.
Covering his face with the crook of his elbow, Draco sighed. “--do what you want. Just be careful.”
“Down here.”
“Potter, you might have early retirement but I have places to be,” he said as he tried to slip out of bed again. “I am not a pillow. Or a toga you can wear, off. Get.” He prodded at Harry’s sides again with a finger.
“You’re such an arse.” Shaking his head, Harry tried his best. “How long before my magic listens to me again?”
It wasn’t around very often, this Fornax owl.
“I find you terribly inconvenient right now. Enough.” Draco said to the house, wishing commanding generations of magics and protective charms was not so much like parenting. It slammed the doors shut again and Draco decided an early night would be helpful.
“Lucky you,” he said. He should've ordered a decent suit instead of this old thing. Why couldn’t Ginny’ve texted Neville sooner?
Maybe it was the FireWhiskey, maybe it was the disappointment and the trepidation mixed up with the adrenaline, maybe it was how ridiculous such a response was but Draco laughed till his face and stomach cramped.
Dumbass.
He unrolled the bandage carefully, he wouldn’t be able to try this one again. Get over it. Just stop staring, Draco wanted to say but instead said, “What?”
Harry could not compete with his dead wife and in the same vein, Draco would not compete with Ginny. Draco was sure Potter also still adored Ginny in some way, why else would he look heartbroken at her rushing away, abandoning him? Harry needed a reminder on why Ginny was his wife for so long. Whether it was the crude manner beforehand, Harry never returned with a tray or invited himself to sit down. What he did do was appear and disappear with the aforementioned scones and tea, occasionally, provoking him to eat a bit more and leaving soon after. An apology would set the clock back, Harry would sit and chat if Draco only said sorry. Draco for that reason did not.
“You could end up dead. Or a squib.” He’d still be off from work, avoiding the press about his affliction. But it might stop his mind from breaking under the aggressive instinct of a dragon. Draco tried to show confidence, it would work. But it might kill him. But it could work. “You’ll need a Healer or someone that knows how they work. I can’t - I don’t have the skillset to deal with this. I can’t do this for you. A potion is fine but this isn't my area.” An apology almost made it into the air. Draco wished he'd learned more about mythical creatures than their innards. All he'd cared about was what use they might hold in relation to brewing. If he knew more maybe, maybe he really could've saved Potter on his own.
“Lotty was investigating! Lotty heard a noise outside so Lotty was trying to find it...” She slumped, started to cry again with apologises in the air.
“If his magic was uncontrollable even then – before the dragonblood became too toxic...” How long had Harry claimed to have the potions? Six years? Without the dragonblood to cause havoc then it was Harry’s Will completely and utterly at fault. He’d simply did what he’d done all those years: kept up the illusion he was fine. If not the potions, then what else could damage a wizard’s Will?
“Decimus behave, this is Lotty. Do as she asks, she’s very dear to me.”
“He’s so adorable.” She cooed over him, and stood arms out. “Come on, hand him over. I’ll take him to his bed.” Without answering, without waiting for that answer, Astoria tried to slip her hands underneath the sleeping toddler, but Draco shooed her away.
Now, the study looked much different from how he had left it. The study itself was no longer on fire. But the wall fashioned into bookcases were emptied and their contents strewn about the room. Journals of potions and benign ingredients were ruined and thrown around. His desk once the very centrepiece, a mere shadow of itself with burnt handles and a mass of ash being its other half. They’d certainly tried to look for Draco’s now-destroyed notes.
“I’m going to say goodbye to the stragglers. Maybe you can talk some sense into him.”
“Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t hex you to pieces.”
That had Draco laugh. “Your healing is crap, I’m aware.” And then Blaise turned his wand on him.
“Of course, I never take Scorpius to those things. Really dull affairs. Blaise and I would drink and end up teasing Pansy for--” He cleared his throat, saliva too thick to breathe. “For having to marry and shag Theo.”
“I have dealt with this--” Draco didn’t want to hear himself, it was showing too much - too much of everything. Frustration at being told he should just amp up the wards and maybe, not go outside for a time regaled in his head. Maybe this was his penance for being a Death Eater, he had no one to blame but himself. And after so many years, he was still angry. Could he understand why people hated him? Astoria? They were under the Dark Lord’s influence--
Glass started to burrow its way into the marble, scratching and clawing and Draco hadn’t seen anything like it.
“Don’t know,” Ron said as he shrugged, went back to watching the Muggles. “Wasn’t in the Aurors back then, well I’d left it but--”
Days went by and every time Harry arrived, Draco made a point to touch him, platonic at most. A fix of the collar of his terribly pressed Auror robes, a squeezing hug which did not result in a snogging session no matter how Harry looked at him after. A double-check on if Harry was okay after his newly made batch of potions. All of it showed the same confusion on Harry’s face when Draco left after.
Success. He was an owl worthy of the Malfoy name again.
“No. No, of course not.”
Sipping at the water was a cool ointment to his sore throat. “You’ve been reading your mother’s books again, haven’t you?” One year, Draco had Hermione herself ask if he could check Scorpius’ behaviour as he’d acted too much over Rose and had caused quite the drama within the Weasley-Granger household. Apparently, in those Muggle books Astoria liked to read, acting like a complete tosspot was seemingly encouraged. Draco enchanted them to close if his son ever considered something within those pages a good idea.
He sat on his post and then the box came to life.
Draco glanced over to Siobhan, then to the unconscious Harry. He could lie. It wouldn’t be found out until much later. This might backfire. A good liar wasn’t one who lied always or one who told tall tales in the illusion of covering up more. A good liar told the truth just as much. Reasoning Hermione would shut herself off and give Draco nothing at the hint of a lie was more than enough reason to stay truthful.
“Mister Potter is refusing treatment from the Healer and from Lotty.” She must have overheard, her tone different in regards to Harry. “He said, he would like to speak with Draco Malfoy before anything proceeds. Lotty told Harry Potter, Master Malfoy was resting, Lotty told him.”
Meeting with Hermione again and having no real answers was less frustrating and more embarrassing. The conniving purebloods hadn’t shown their fangs and Nott had gone silent. From what Draco could gather, him hosting Hermione’s little party had given them pause. Either they didn’t consider Hermione to show her loyalty in return or Malfoy was still influential enough to cause some inner conflict.
She looked at it and then to him. As if he was somehow interfering with her work.
Don’t tell, don’t say--Draco’s gut twisted. “Scorpius was there too?” Draco’s jaw set in place and now, he wished Potter was still on the floor.
“Hey, stop. He did good.” Ollie tried to placate him and Draco would’ve snorted at the idiocy if not for keeping his humanity to himself.
“Didn’t really notice.” Harry shifted and Draco was glad to have blood supplied to his hand again. “She wasn’t nervous or scared or anything. Impatient with people, that’s about it.” Draco hummed an affirmation. Harry tended to speak to more people in passing than most, add in Ginny, anyone a fan of the Harpies, and they’d have had a hard time being left alone. Harry hadn’t helped shed any light on who or when Siobhan had been threatened. At the party was looking mighty probable.
If Harry had managed to connect Moran to Siobhan then he was obviously still proficient at his job – whenever he decided to focus. One clue Draco had over Harry was the memory of the note and Draco wondered if an outside perspective would highlight the lying cherub’s identity.
Four-hundred and twenty-six. A tickling sensation wormed itself through the nape of his neck to his forehead. Blinking, trying to force his eyes to stay open – just stay awake – four-hundred and twenty-seven – he wasn’t sure when the ground had changed colour. No longer was it dark but bright, too bright near blinding and Astoria and himself stood together.
“You’re not messing him about, right? For some twisted joke?”
Blaise grabbed onto him, ready to apparate and Draco yanked his arm back. “I need to get the laboratory.”
When he did, it was usually on point.
Harry’s grimace from earlier resurfaced in his mind.
“How many potions has he brewed since he’s under your tutelage?” Draco asked in Potter’s stead.
For a moment, Draco was sure - positive and fully thinking Harry would agree. That this could resolve itself and all Potter had to do was say the truth (and for a Gryffindor that shouldn’t be so difficult). But whatever thought fired in that same little window of opportunity killed whatever good faith Draco had - if any. He saw it, in slow motion the near-scowl on Harry’s face. Trusting Draco was akin to pain or disgust.
Setting down her cup of tea on the saucer, his mother snapped, “Draco, sign it or you’ll no doubt be like you were on your fifth birthday.”
There was only one way Potter knew about his lessons. He rotated his wrist along with his wand, if only to calm the adrenaline making them shake. Neville would be dealt with. The familiar crackle of air and Neville appeared as he normally did. Horrid clothing and all. And Draco greeted him with a Stinging Hex to the face. He fell in slow-motion, stunned to the now muddy path. A distant cry of peacocks covering up the sizzle of skin.
Draco tried not to laugh, but with half the stand uproarious, both he and Harry were laughing so hard his face hurt and Harry had doubled over.
“You’re not a punishment.” Prod, prod, prod at his side and Draco squirmed but couldn’t move away far enough.
“She didn’t say: I’m not interested in what you do--”
For once Harry was patient and Draco could only hear the grandfather clock from outside.
“Where’s--” Harry croaked, voice nearly gone. Launching into who was where and why, Draco was glad to see even if Potter did look like utter crap, he was awake.
It was shut with a click and Draco slouched against the wall, exhausted and confused. He was gone in his thoughts, the memories of demanding to wear that cursed ring and proclaiming to Mrs Greengrass it wouldn’t so much as nip him. She hadn’t believed him for a second he was marrying Astoria because he loved her.
“You couldn’t make Ravenclaw, never mind Slytherin.”
No. No.
He told Blaise to stay at the top of the stairs, to alert him if anyone else was close by. Slipping down the steps and tearing out the plant, he dug with his fingers in the dirt, frantic and panicked when he didn’t find it immediately.
“I’ve only been with Astoria,” he mentioned in hopes to move passed however many people - forget it, men - Harry had actually slept with as quickly as possible. If Draco was in a long, long list he wasn’t sure how he would take it. Harry propped himself up on an elbow and Draco sneered at the lack of pyjamas - not that Harry was naked. No Harry Potter was one of those people, people who went to sleep in clothing fit for outside and didn’t seem to have any inkling as to why that was weird.
Today, he kept himself in his room. Unable to face Harry just in case he decided to pull a proper confession out of thin air. Draco couldn’t deal with that right now. Lotty had her orders, a buffet and the list of available foods had already been delivered. Hermione must have a reason to serve some old toffee as an option. All Draco could guess is it was someone’s favourite. Someone Hermione needed to be in a good mood.
‘Present Ministry of Magic, hides conniving Malfoy’s animagus form. Favouritism in plain sight. Whatever shall Minister Hermione Weasley-Granger do next?’
Draco would see one or two which intrigued him enough to browse, flicking through a few pages only to realise it was simply a collection or rewritten from another work. Although, speaking of brewing, Draco picked up the only edition which went further into Sleeping Draughts; unlikely to have any breakthrough inside it but Scorpius had started suggesting books for him to buy and Draco couldn’t think of anything he needed right now.
Harry was waiting for him, watching the owls outside the Emporium but never daring to take a step towards them or offer a word.
Neville returned sombre the following week and Draco already knew why. Came under the guise of checking on one of the browning hedgerows.
“I don't care," was Harry's immediate reply.
“--Never thought about it. Haven’t thought about it.” That wasn’t entirely true, but Harry didn’t need to know that. Draco rested his back against the door, ignoring Harry completely, looking off to one side. All while Harry returned, standing a little too close, a little too much in Draco’s personal bubble. Trying to bluff his way out of the looming conversation, Draco picked at lint which wasn't there, “Yes well, you have my attention now. I should say--”
“Blaise did it.”
Another bump into his shoulder, this one deliberate and wholly too rough to play it off as anything different. “Can I ask you something?”
“Draco, you about?”
“Who says I’m not ambitious?”
‘Draco Malfoy is firmly in the Mudblood’s camp. Try Zabini. Idiot could use some money. Probably could sway his vote.’
Draco made it to his bedroom before he fell against the door and slid down it as his legs gave out. What the fuck just happened? His hands trembled and Draco couldn’t tell if it was from shock of the fact a bloody All-Mother tree was now implanted in his sitting room or because that magic in the air was gone. He checked on his arms, blood stained over where his Death Mark once sat. He laughed, bitter. Great.
Ooh, no. No. That wasn’t becoming a thing. That wasn’t going to be the new gossip in the Prophet or the rumour mill. Him and Blaise? The heat on his face was more than enough to burn that idea out.
“Sure. Thanks,” Harry said as she reached over for a hug. One that Draco looked away from, unable to remove the idea he was intruding upon their friendship again. Hermione and Ron should be the ones helping. Why Ron wasn't helping Harry even when he knew how dangerous his magic had really become spoke louder than anything.
Hopping over to Harry, whose arms seemed to be all that was keeping his head upright, Draco tried to coo - he was not going to continue - whatever secret lay in this room was still just that, hidden and Harry’s alone.
“Seen Harry I take it?”
Flinching back he awoke panting, cold sweat upon his back. It wasn’t Blaise or even Theo. Harry was sitting up, magic in the air along with a few lumos orbs planted to the ceiling and playing up the shadows of them against the walls. Oh. This was his house.
“I see Luna and Neville every week. In fact I'm pretty sure Longbottom might be planning on rescuing all the weeds and saplings that are dug up.”
“Well, fuck.” He returned to the pensive, letting them have room to wriggle around. Wait till Harry left before dousing his head under.
A squib with free will would always win over a Malfoy that did someone else’s bidding. Startled, Scorpius shook his head, “I won’t. I won’t.” It was then, Scorpius gathered the power of what he held in his hands and he was eager to rid himself of them.
“I really hate this place,” he muttered, leaning against the door frame and letting it sink in. He should care for this place a great deal, Scorpius was born upstairs and his own childhood had many pleasant memories.
Draco expected Harry to launch to Charlie’s defence, to hear how he was making it sound wrong and that Charlie would never do such a thing (not deliberately, Draco would argue back and maybe Harry would say--)
“I can stop if I’m no good. I’ve not really done it much either.”
“You graduated from Hogwarts but at the years Healing wasn’t considered worthwhile so making this practise close to forty years old means you come from money, or you know someone with money to have set it up back then. I imagine you’re one of those cut-offs from an extant pureblood line, someone with money but little privilege of family.”
His pleasant mood faltered. Until he saw Luna’s worry. Then he shook out of it. “It's fine, don't worry about it,” Draco whispered back and moving away, he added, “Best for us all to return, can’t have anyone think we were away too long. Gossip likes to wake in absence.”
Well, that was true.
Ron hadn’t lied or exaggerated. Malfoy Manor was broken. Even from the outside it was a mess.
How odd it was to fly on a broom instead of on wing. How easy it was to turn and twist in the air as an owl versus this. This inflexible piece of wood. It took some time to – not remember – but to become comfortable again, that this was the first way he learned to fly, to be in the air.
Us. Normally he’d only include Scorpius with him.
Draco was awoken again, though he couldn’t be sure how much time had passed or when exactly he’d fallen asleep. A knock at the door and Ron – why was he here – wandered in.
“The Mudblood? I don’t think so. She’s had enough fun playing Minister,” Theo sneered back, and the intimidation tactic fell away leaving Draco to sigh as Nott tried to crowd into his space. Blaise could work a room, Nott couldn’t handle chit-chat over tea.
Draco hooted. It wasn’t the worst. It also wasn’t very good but Draco really needed to move this conversation on.
Draco was going to die. Die right now and be perfectly happy. Because the amount of tail wags he received, so many curious snouts coming over to sniff at check if he was pureblooded - they didn’t seem to bother much with Harry for once in Draco’s life - and Draco took on the responsibility to give them all at least one pat on the head, a head scratch. Whatever the bloody things wanted, really, and Draco hated it.
Draco steeled himself for whatever might await him and entered the study.
“Draco? What time is it?” Harry yawned.
Macie was a hard-ass but Draco soon learned that was just her way of showing she cared. She rode all of them hard but also made sure to check in with them constantly. Draco had nothing but the utmost respect for her. She was also the best player on the team, and Draco learned she had received offers from the Harpies and the Arrows. She chose the Falcons because they were her and her brother’s favourite team growing up. She was muggle-born and her brother didn’t have her same aptitude for magic but they were still extremely close. Apparently, he was born with some kind of muggle disorder that affected his motor skills, though Draco had met him and thoroughly enjoyed his sense of humour.
“Well,” she said after a moment, “aren’t you going to introduce me to your friends?”
“I will bloody well clean if I feel like it.”
“Oh yes! Well, Ibrahim had a private chef but around day four we were all getting tired of the same cooking. I had a real craving for seafood specifically this one restaurant in Noirmoutier,
At those words, Draco couldn't contain himself any longer. He bent down and pulled Harry into a kiss as the chaos of celebration rang around them.
“Hey Draco! Cool costume,” said one boy who was dressed as a medieval knight himself.
Harison looked confused. “Oh! You mean Phillip? Phillip’s Mr Moore’s son. He bought the team from his dad last month when the old geezer expressed the desire for some warmer weather. Phillip pretty much grew up around here. Isn’t that right, Justin?”
Draco turned and stormed off, not leaving Potter enough time for a response. In a few steps he reached the designated apparition point, and as he disapparated he was left with a single thought. It didn’t matter if he ever made it to number one, all that mattered now was beating Potter by any means necessary.
“I wouldn’t. I’m sure you are an expert at hiding it, but I trust you.” Harry paused for a moment before moving on. “Second rule, have fun.”
When he got home he quickly started nursing a bottle of wine. He pulled out a record player that sat in the corner of the living room and chose one of the records at random.
“I thought you said no sex?”
hear yourself right?”
“Uh, no, thanks. I’m still on my first,” Potter said.
“Come by my house tomorrow at nine, I’ll owl you the floo address.” Potter got up to leave. “Oh, and about sex…”
“There are plenty of rumours out there about us and he wanted to make sure I was ok with it. I didn’t want me being here to keep you from taking the job so I told him not to tell you that I was going to be a coach. But that first day, when you saw me… the way all the colour drained from your face, I knew I had made a mistake. So I tried to give you your space.”
“Come on Malfoy.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Out of all the players here we both know you’re the best.”
“You know you don’t have to stay,” Harry bite. “I can clean up. It’s no problem.”
, Draco thought as he swallowed the capsule. He waited a few seconds but nothing happened. Maybe it took a while to kick in?
After graduation, Draco received several offers from teams across the EU and even a few in the Americas. He considered staying in France and playing for the Quiberon Quafflepunchers, but in the end he decided upon the Tutshill Tornados. They were on the rise in recent years and with Draco as their starting seeker they had a good chance at the cup. Plus they were willing to pay.
“Actually, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that.”
Draco stopped reading. His father was dead. He froze for a moment staring into space before calling down to the front desk and ordering a bottle of Calvados.
“Ow,” he rasped, his throat aching. “Stop that.”
“I have no idea.”
Draco raised an eyebrow at that.
In the bathroom, Draco surveyed the damage. He was shocked at his own reflection in the mirror. Draco had been at l'Internat for less than one day, yet he could hardly recognize himself. The skin around his right eye was red and already swollen. He would be sporting a bruise for days to come. With any luck, his dormant magic would speed up the healing process a bit. He tried to fix his new fridge into something a bit more sophisticated but soon gave up. Without his usual potions and creams it was useless.
Draco froze. “Are you sure? You’re only what? Ten? You still have time.”
“I can imagine that quidditch must have been a nice distraction from such a tragic childhood. I mean, you must have been very lonely growing up - a wizard stuck among muggles.”
The only time Draco wasn’t working on classwork was during his work-study. As a first-year he was assigned a few menial tasks outside of class hours, reorganizing books in the library, dusting classrooms, running small errands for professors. There were five other work-study students, though they didn’t interact much with one another, preferring to complete their tasks and go back to their friends.
Flying around that dinky backyard with Potter and his friends was the most fun Draco had had in ages. Wood seemed to be the only one taking things seriously while the rest of them laughed and joked as they played. Draco could tell they were all excellent players, but for the first time he didn’t feel any pressure to win.
“Please…” There were tears in Harry’s brilliant green eyes.
Potter gave him a strange look.
After the funeral rites were performed Draco tried to sneak away without notice. He wished he could see Tibby and the others but he knew it was probably for the best that he didn’t linger. However, before he could leave Lucius’ widow stopped him.
“But keep your eyes on the score. If they get a lead of one fifty or more, I want you to switch to interference and start running screens.”

He knew the Malfoy name might raise a few eyebrows but the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters were old news. The war had ended almost two decades ago and You-Know-Who was dead. Draco remembered hearing something about the last Death Eater being caught years ago (well last confirmed Death Eater at least). The man had been hiding as a literal rat for over a decade, but he was eventually caught, tried, and sent to Azkaban. There was a rumour that somehow Harry Potter had been involved but he would have been twelve, maybe thirteen, at the time and Draco didn’t put much stock into what the tabloids had to say.
“And here I thought you were calling me crazy.”
He sat at the back of the hotel restaurant snacking on a sandwich and reading about the adventures of a magical chocolatier in a small French village when he heard his name. Looking around the restaurant he caught sight of Krum seated with his coach and manager. They were all facing away from Draco and speaking in rapid Russian.
Blaise sat back. “No need to get defensive. He’s not going to hear it from me. But if he can’t see it for himself then he’s an idiot. He’s an idiot for letting you go.”
The team scrambled into action, putting on the rest of their gear.
This was ridiculous. Draco’s life was ridiculous. But come Monday, Draco stood in the corridor outside of the conference room pacing. Why the fuck was he so nervous? It was simple. Apologize for being such a dick, offer to make amends, Draco squeezed his hands into fists, but what if Harry didn’t forgive him? And that was the crux of it, wasn’t it? Harry was so kind and generous and full of forgiveness. Draco didn’t deserve Harry’s forgiveness, but at the same time if Harry rejected him now he wasn’t sure what he would do.
It was a hasty clash of teeth and tongues and spit. That ended with Draco pinned against the wall and Xavier sliding his thigh between Draco’s legs.
“This should help with the physical symptoms, but you might still find it hard to focus for a few days and the mood swings will continue.” She calmed the flame and began bottling the potion. “It may be a while before you can sleep through the night, but it is not a good idea to combine this with any sort of sleeping draught.”
Draco waved him off then took a minute to get his breathing under control before apparating back to his flat. Even though he had lost every single match, flying with Potter had been amazing. For the first time in a long time Draco had fun, and he found himself actually looking forward to tomorrow. Draco didn’t fully understand what had changed but he was beginning to think he had misjudged Potter completely. As soon as Draco made it to his room, he collapsed onto his bed and went straight to sleep. He slept through the night and didn’t wake up until his alarm went off.
It didn’t take him long to reach Croix-Rousse, the heart of the wizarding world in Lyon. Croix-Rousse was full of hidden passages and tunnels, many of which had been part of the city’s silk trade, but they had a second use. If you knew what you were doing the passages could be used to access the magical community in Lyon.
“Yes well, I’m sure you know, it can be lonely at the top.”
As the school year got underway, Draco developed a new routine. He spent the school day with the other boys, helping out with homework and teasing them at lunch. After classes, he would stick around for a while and socialize. He used the skills he had built up over the summer, doing whatever he needed to do to hold onto his new spot in the social hierarchy. Often the boys would gather by the lake after school and hang out, but Draco wasn’t interested in devoting any more energy than necessary on his so-called friends. He was always the first to head back inside, using his work-study with Professor Dubois as an excuse.
“Well, you could have lost your advantage.”
Draco glanced down at the textbook in his hand. “Yes, I need to get ahead so I can be top of the class.”
Krum was a great technical flyer and Draco had to give it his all the keep up. They were both closing in on the snitch. Draco ran through the plays in his head. He had a chance. He angled his body to prepare for the manoeuvre when suddenly he heard the tell-tale sound of a goal. Russia had scored. If Draco caught the snitch now he would beat Krum but his team would lose. There was no question in his mind. Draco shifted into a new position and recklessly threw himself between Krum and the snitch.
Draco flew across the empty quidditch pitch climbing higher and higher. A weight Draco hadn’t even realized he had been holding was lifted off his shoulders and he was suddenly struck with the notion that on a broom he could go anywhere, do anything. A whole world of possibilities stretched before him, and Draco felt free.
“You wish.” Draco knew Potter was just edging him on but honestly a seekers game sounded perfect at the moment and with any luck it would wear him out enough that he would be able to sleep through the night. “Ok,” he nodded, “one game.”
“You’re nineteen!”
Draco took in his reflection once more. His skin was flawless and his lips looked extra soft with a naturally rosy tint.
“Of course Pansy. I’m not a child. Go. I’ll be fine.”
“Draco, tell me what you want,” Harry whispered into his ear.
Harry smiled and Draco couldn’t help but mirror him.
“Sorry, it’s just that half the girls in our year have a crush on you. I don’t think they realize that you are not interested.”
Great Britain had the advantage and Draco knew this was his chance to end the match. He flew low and caught sight of it immediately. Krum was barreling for the ball and Draco chased after them both.
Draco dismounted quickly and immediately headed for the lockers. The noise of the crowd was deafening around him. His eyes flicked up to the screen as it showed Potter holding up the snitch triumphantly, that stupid fucking grin across his face.
“Not yet.”
“Please don’t tell me we’re running a marathon,” Draco said dryly.
“What, to get drunk?”
The summer flew by and before Draco knew it, it was time to say goodbye. Thomas’ mother had completed her research so he would not be returning for another summer, and he was never going to be a student. This time when Thomas left both boys cried.
“Monday I will ask him to go over some of my plays with me in the conference room after practice. Then I’ll have some kind of emergency and send you in to reschedule for me. You’ll have the room to yourselves.”
Draco took a deep breath. Potter wasn’t going to let this go. “Ok, fine. I’ll train with you.”
“Are you sure you don’t want me to drop you off at the train station?” He asked.
Once the sun got low on the horizon Draco would go inside and clean himself off before reporting to his father. Somedays his father would dismiss him without a glance, but Draco found that if he kept his father up to date on his studies he drew less attention overall.
As the night went on Draco caught the eye of one of the beaters from Estruga, the Spanish school. He had wavy, brown hair and an accent that was definitely doing things for Draco.
Draco and Pansy left without paying, he assumed Pansy had already made the necessary arrangements. That night was another restless night and in the morning Draco took a dose of the potion. It wasn’t as bad tasting as Polyjuice, but it was certainly up there. The healer had been right when she said Draco might experience some fatigue. He spent the entire day in bed. The fever and tremors and other physical aliments faded but Draco’s mind was racing. His brain fluttered from thought to thought unable to pin anything down. And he was bored so fucking bored. He wanted nothing more than a drink. A cool glass of scotch.
It took the entire day to make the place presentable. Draco cast his entire repertoire of cleaning charms and even resorted to some manual labour. He stopped every once in a while to sip from a half-empty glass or opened bottle, but a few hours after the sunset the place was clean enough for guests and Draco was exhausted.
“You don’t have to do it alone.”
“Are you sure you’re feeling alright?” Another teammate asked.
“It counts.”
“That’s it. I’ve had enough of this moping. You are Draco fucking Malfoy and one broken heart is not going to destroy you. You are going to clean yourself up and show Asim just what the fuck he is missing out on.”
“I am sure you can get Professor Hérisson and Professor Duchamp to give you an extension on the assignments. They like you--”
“The pleasure is mine,” Blaise said as he shook Draco’s hand.
“What does it look like I’m doing? I’m dusting off these bookshelves. Have you even touched any of these books since moving in?”
The rest of the day was spent cleaning Draco’s dorm and coming up with a plan to catch up on all the work he had missed. Draco still wasn’t convinced it was possible but he was willing to try.
Even after the rejection of first year, Draco had thought he would find friends eventually. He figured after he had proven himself a worthy equal he would find a companion with whom he could share adventures, confide secrets, and conquer the world. But he had done it, he had reached the top, or very near to it, and still he was alone. He was probably going to be alone forever. He drank some more of the wine to distract him from those thoughts. He could still hear the sounds of laughter and merriment in the distance. Draco thought he might cry but he only felt hollow and numb, so he sat there alone in the woods drinking from his stolen bottle and contemplating the nature of his existence.
Scowling, Draco walked away and headed to the back where they did their weight training.
Draco kept his eye out for Theban script carved into the stonework, which was used to mark the passages to the Place Confiné. His letter had provided detailed instructions and he was able to locate the entrance to Rue Roscelin without much difficulty.
“Of course,” Blaise nodded. “Though, a glass of bourbon could help with that.”
“I see. Well, thank you. I am sure he would have appreciated it.”
The next couple of weeks were miserable. Draco continued to attend classes but that was pretty much it. Half the time he was hungover the other half he was drunk. Draco spent most of the day in bed but somehow he was getting less sleep than ever before. He wasn’t sure if he was still being counted for his work-study but no one had brought it up so he figured it was fine.
“You have great instincts, you just have to learn how to follow through. If you did that you would have no problem beating Krum. I could help you if you want. We could train together, a few seekers matches.”
“I can’t. I have to study.”
“You’re one to talk.”
Draco wasn’t much of a sci-fi fan, but the boy’s excitement brought a smile to his face.
“I said I’m coming!” Draco snapped as he tripped again. “Merlin.”
“In case you hadn’t noticed Draco, I’m my own person. My life does not revolve exclusively around you. I have my own desires and ambitions, and I shouldn’t have to babysit my boyfriend all day just because he is feeling lonely. It’s not healthy Draco, your need to be around someone all the time. I think-- I think we should take a break.”
“The students reside at the school all year, so you will not be returning to Château de Sancerre.”
Draco took a deep breath and sat down next to Harry. “This morning I received a letter from the National Quidditch Team inviting me to play at the World Cup.”
“You aren’t going to need that today. Flying isn’t your problem right now, you are as fast as you’ve ever been. But you’ve lost your endurance and your reaction time is shit. We need to build up your core strength.”
“Yes, you may.”
will be hell.”
“Well try harder.”
“Please Harry, let me get this out.” Their eyes met for a brief second before Draco lowered his head. “I was terrible to you. Since the moment we met, you’ve been nothing but kind. I was petty and jealous and an asshole but still you treated me like a friend. And then I took that friendship and I ruined it just like I ruin everything else--” Draco shook his head. “I can’t even blame the drugs or alcohol for that one. You opened up to me and somehow I made it all about myself. I’m sorry. And I’m sorry for everything I said to you that day. I know I said some horrible things. I didn’t want to get better and I knew you would try and help me so I said what I had to to keep you away. I am a terrible person but I’m trying to be better. I don’t expect you to believe me, but I hope that you’ll be able to see for yourself someday. Until then, do you think we can work together? Because the Falcons are kind of my last chance.”
Four miles later Draco was wheezing. Pot-- Harry handed him a bottle of water and Draco gulped it down.
Now that
They both stood up and Draco grabbed onto Pansy’s arm. A wave of nausea overtook him as they appeared in the healer’s house. Pansy conjured him a large bowl and Draco gladly took it as he threw up the contents of his stomach.
“Enough Potter,” he got out between laboured breaths. “It’s late, besides if we keep going and you are going to clean out my Gringotts account.”
“No,” Harry said in a way that clearly meant yes.
“I’m taking a sabbatical,” Harry replied as if his words made any sense.
“Anything else? It is very important I get the correct proportions right.”
“You can’t save me Harry.” Draco looked at him then. Nothing could have prepared him for the anguish on Harry’s face. “I’m beyond saving.”
Draco sat up. “Yeah, I’ll be fine.”
The morning of Draco’s departure he met his father in his study. It was a quick goodbye followed by a curt dismissal. He used the extra time to take one last walk through the gardens.
Cole was the same way. As a big black man, Cole had struggled a lot to get where he was. Draco was humbled by him and it warmed his heart to see how much Cole loved his wife and their newborn baby, Angela. Draco had even met Angela, though he drew the line at holding her. Justin also had kids although his were already at Hogwarts so Draco didn’t get the chance to make their acquaintance. However, he did see plenty of pictures of the three boys and was getting pretty close to getting the names right. Luis was the oldest, then came Ben and Leo. No - that was wrong - Ben was the youngest, Draco was pretty sure.
The next morning, Draco woke up to a sharp, steady knocking at the door. “Monsieur?”
“If you are not going to get in the shower, I
Draco didn’t know whether to be upset or relieved when he saw the tournament matchups. Tutshill and Puddlemere were in separate brackets but Tutshill would be matched up against
He needed a drink.
Flying around with Potter was just as fun as it had been last night. They got into a couple chases early on in the match but the snitch got away both times. The third time Draco caught sight of the snitch it was hovering just over Potter’s shoulder.
As the months went by, Draco’s situation did not improve. He clearly didn’t belong here and the other boys knew it. They teased him about his name, his accent, the way he walked, how he sat. They said he spent too much time in front of the mirror and that his handwriting was too girly. Frankly, Draco was surprised they didn’t find something to criticize about the way he breathed. Not that Draco cared, of course. What did the opinions of a few muggles matter?
As the first-years settled into a routine and the social hierarchy solidified, it became clear that the largest determining factors in terms of popularity were magical ability and grades. Draco knew that if he wanted a place at the top he would have to work at it, and work at it, and work at it again. And so Draco did just that. As the months went by, he threw himself into his studies. He did all the extra readings, attended office hours, and practised his wand work for hours.
“You have work. A boyfriend. I couldn’t do that to you. It will be hell.
“They found them in the main hall with all the furniture pushed up against the walls and wardruna runes drawn on the floor with hot sauce,” Harry interrupted.
“Well, the rumour was that the two of you absolutely hated each other, but from the way he’s been staring at you all day I would be inclined to guess the opposite.”
“Pleasure to meet you boys.” Pansy smiled as the other boys said their hellos and introduced themselves, then she took over the conversation from there. Draco hadn’t known her for more than a day, but he knew her well enough to just go along with it.
“You princesses about done fixing your hair?” A voice yelled from the corridor. “You’re going to make a terrible first impression on the new assistant coach if you’re all late. Let’s go!”
“You were the keeper for the other team.”
As a second-year Draco had Latin, Herbology, and Astronomy added to his schedule. Among his new classes, Draco was most excited about Herbology. He had enjoyed the time he spent in the gardens both alone and with Thomas, but he was eager to do some gardening of his own once more. He had helped his mother cultivate a few magical plant varieties back at Château de Sancerre, though he had been too young to do much more than dig some holes and drag around a miniature watering can. He hoped that herbology would help him feel connected to her in some way.
After lunch Harry’s friends showed up. Harry had introduced them all as they arrived but Draco couldn’t really remember their names. The redheads were all Weasleys, Draco recognized the name as one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. There was also Oliver Wood, who was Puddlemere’s keeper. The rest were mysteries to him. Draco got Wood, one of the Weasley twins, and the girl Weasley on his team, along with Angelina (or was it Angelica) and a pair of blondes.
and the school is located in Galicia.
“I have my sources.”
“I wasn’t talking about the tournament. The European Cup is next year.”
It wasn’t a no, so Draco took a seat. “Draco Malfoy.” He introduced himself keeping the frustration out of his tone.
It took Mr Barker a while longer to meet Draco in the entry hall. He took a moment to review all the paperwork once more and check that Draco had everything he needed.
He braced himself for Birch’s tirade but Birch managed to restrain himself until the locker room.
Harry looked at him. “Don’t say it.”
That year, Draco didn’t pass Emilie Baumé in the rankings. He figured number two wasn’t so bad. Merlin, what would his father think of that? Draco decided that studying was all well and good, but at a certain point it became too much. As long as his reputation remained intact and he was still near the top, it was fine. It wasn’t worth the countless hours of studying each week that it would take to get him a shot at number one.
The whole day he could think of nothing else except for the piece of parchment waiting for him. As soon as class let out, Draco rushed out to the yard. He climbed up his tree and settled into his favourite spot.
“I can’t. I told my friends we would leave ten minutes ago. But think about it, I’m sure you can work it out. Your problem is you are always reacting to things, if you want to improve you need to be more proactive.”
If I had known all it took was some shattah on the floor and a summoner’s circle I would have done it ages ago.”
. So Draco kept himself out of sight as much as possible. His favourite spots to read were the linen closet on the third floor, behind the shed at the back of the property, and between the crook of two large branches of an oak tree that overlooked the yard. He spent all his free time reading alone and that was just how he liked it.
Dorian spoke up, “That was a risky move, but Draco just saved our asses. We’re still in this so let’s not waste this opportunity that we have. We are going to full offence. Ryan, Natasha, Tyler - push as far forward as you can. Jeneen and I will keep Kozlov off your back. Draco, I want you running interference plays as long as we’re in the red. Micah,” Dorian turned to their keeper, “keep doing what you’re doing.”
“Whatcha got there
Everyone on the team had come from such different backgrounds but Harrison had been right when he said they were all rejects in one way or another. Because of this they were able to relate to each other on a much deeper level than some superficial commonalities would have allowed.
He went over to investigate and was surprised to find a kid who didn’t look more than nine years old. He had wavy brown hair and a light complexion. The kid was making strange noises and swinging a branch around. Draco watched for a moment reminded of his own games of make-believe as a child.
Draco glanced up at him with a small smirk. “I didn’t think so either.”
At first, he thought that there had been a mistake and he was about to say as much, but then he caught sight of his name written plainly across the front and the return address in the corner,
“You didn’t seem very-- Well, you didn’t seem very approachable. Draco, I’m worried about you.”
. The third floor should be empty, he could shut himself in the linen closet and cry until classes started. Draco got up from the table ready to make a quick retreat but he pulled himself short when he encountered a figure directly in his path. He was able to keep the cake from smashing into the other person, but only just.
Draco held out his hand. “A pleasure.”
Draco felt a kick of defiance. “Sometimes I drink more.” He took a large sip to punctuate his point.
“They say you’re the real deal. A prodigy on a broom. Can you tell the readers of the Prophet how it feels?”
Draco set his things down on his assigned bed and followed Mr Barker back downstairs to receive his uniforms and regulation haircut.
Fridays quickly became Draco’s favourite day of the week. Professor Dubois’ classes were always interesting and engaging, and Draco was the best in the class. He got particularly excited when, a few weeks into the semester, Dubois scheduled a three-hour hike through the woods that bordered the campus. They were going to hunt for Amanita muscaria, and Draco wanted to be the first one to find it.
Draco heard the toilet flush and the girl emerged settling at the sink next to him. She seemed to be completely unperturbed by the situation. She had pale skin and her dark hair was cut in a sharp bob. She was pretty in that kind of off-putting way.
“Well, I’ll drink them both.”
Draco stopped and took a breath. No matter how Harry reacted, he had to do this. He pushed open the door and stepped inside.
It was a while before Draco got another chance at the snitch. He was hovering near the goalposts when he saw it. Unfortunately, two beaters zeroed in on him at the exact same time. They slammed into Draco from both sides pushing him towards the stands. He managed to stay on course bringing them closer and closer to the snitch but suddenly Draco’s broom went into a tailspin. He fought for control as the ground grew closer though he kept his eyes on the glint of gold. He could see the path to victory in his head, all he had to do was execute it. He willed himself to move but he couldn’t do it, his body wasn’t strong enough. Instead, he ended up tumbling to the ground in an inelegant heap. At the last second, he managed to tuck into a roll to keep himself from getting a mouthful of dirt. Draco popped back up immediately. He heard the sound of a whistle and the call of “Play on!”
“He wants to,” April insisted.
He must have slept at some point though he couldn’t remember it. The days following the funeral were just a series of snapshots. He woke up in bed, or draped across the couch, or on the floor, or once in the yard, and just started drinking again.
Draco tried to take Finwick’s advice and put Potter out of his head, or at least quit keeping tabs on him which was unfortunate because not half an hour later Draco found himself running into the Boy-Who-Lived at the bar.
Draco sucked in a breath. “You’re quite attractive yourself, you know.”
“What were you playing?” Draco asked, curious.
“He has a fever,” Pansy spoke up.
Draco frowned, something was definitely wrong. “It wouldn’t feel right to leave you alone with all this mess. Besides, I’m not even tired.”
Draco scoffed. “Even if that is true, grades are the system that society has agreed upon and I have to be the best, otherwise what is the point?”
Blaise was still in the bed sound asleep. The pulled back sheets revealed his muscular chest, rising and falling in steady rhythm.
“Hmm it’s true, but that doesn’t mean you weren’t impressive.” The man was looking right into Draco’s eyes. “I’m Xavier.”
“I just thought you wanted more time to study.”
Draco finally looked up at Harry then, but Harry’s expression was entirely unreadable.
Draco said nothing.
“You want me to write your paper for you? In case you didn’t notice I’m more than a bit busy. I’ll be lucky if I catch up before exams start. Besides, why would you want a fifth-year writing your paper?”
Asim looked confused for a moment before grinning. “Well I don’t know about you, but I was hoping more of this,” he pressed a kiss to Draco’s neck, “and this,” another to his check, “and this,” he pressed the final kiss against Draco’s lips.
“You’re beautiful when you laugh, well you’re beautiful all the time, but especially when you laugh.”
They kept walking.
Fuck, Harry was right. His wand was probably sitting under the couch in the living room. Draco would retrieve it in the morning; there were much more important matters at hand. “I can manage a simple wandless vanishing charm, I assure you. Especially when I am feeling particularly motivated.”
Krum mostly listened adding a comment here or there but there was one word he said that stood out to Draco, решительным (reshitel'nym). He called Draco strong, determined.
“The Dark Lord is dead,” Lucius spoke. “I don’t know how, but the mark-- I felt it. It won’t be long before the Ministry begins rounding us up. We have to leave. Tonight.”
A couple of hours passed this way before Draco excused himself. He swiped a bottle of wine from among the drinks table and ventured off into the woods by himself. He settled on a large rock, the paper dragon resting beside him. Using a spell he had seen the older kids do, he unstoppered the wine bottle and took a drink. The wine was sweet going down but left a bitter aftertaste in his mouth, he took another large sip.
Coach Pharo started talking while Draco was still trying to process how this was his life. “Glad to see everyone made it to the new season in one piece. As you all know we have a couple new faces around here. I want you guys to give a warm welcome to your new seeker, Draco Malfoy, and my new assistant coach, Harry Potter.”
They were neck and neck now and Draco had the snitch in his sight. He clenched his jaw, willing his broom to go faster, but he knew he wasn’t going to make it. Draco veered to the side throwing his weight into the other player and knocking them both off course.
“Well, who knows where I’ll be so far into the future. But I wish you luck in your match.” Blaise turned back to the bar.
Draco spent the rest of the night thinking about the game against Montrose. He kept playing it over and over in his mind and sure enough the bastard was right. Draco had been too focused on the seekers game and on Clarkson. It should have cost him the match.
Pansy sat next to him on the couch. “Fuck, you have a fever. Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Not all of us sleep in our kits you big dolt!” Harrison screamed back into the corridor. “That’s just Macie, the captain,” he said turning back to Draco. “She’s a bit rough on the edges but really she’s a big softie. Don’t tell her I said that.”
The witch looked over at Draco and nodded.
“Look Potter, I can see this is difficult for you to wrap your brain around so I’ll spell it out for you.” Draco used every ounce of self-control he had left to steel his face as he looked Harry in the eye. “Leave me the fuck alone.”
, the school’s qualifying exam, which meant that he had less and less time to spend with Draco.
Draco flinched in surprise as a boy pulled out the seat next to him and sat down. Mentally, Draco chastised himself for such a display of weakness.
Draco thought he would have that chance when he received an invite to the Halloween after-party. The Beauxbâtons’ Halloween after-party was legendary. It took place in a clearing in the forest where some of the students liked to hang out and drink. Students from both Collège and Lycée, boys and girls, attended and
“Krum.”
but you have been here all of two hours and you have no idea what you’re talking about. It has been over four years since the last time you saw me and suddenly ‘you are concerned’ and ‘I need help’. The truth is,
The other boy looked him over, assessing. “I am waiting for my friends to come down,” he said in a flat tone.
There was a knock on the door and Draco jumped, he’d been on edge all day.
In those last few seconds, Draco could see the play in his head. He knew exactly what he had to do to win. He also knew that it was impossible. Potter had more talent than him and though Draco knew how to win he didn’t have the skill to pull it off. Up against Potter, he wasn’t strong enough, fast enough, or reckless enough to come out on top.
After the mess of the party was straightened out, Draco kept going - wiping down the counters, fluffing the pillows… There was still an awkward tension in the air but Draco wasn’t quite ready to go home so he kept finding little things to do. He still wasn’t sure what had upset Harry so much in the first place, but Draco noticed that his mood was slowly improving.
“You do know this is the boy’s bathroom?”
Assured that his wife had things well in hand, Lucius made his way to his study and began to pack.
After Portugal, Great Britain played Turkey. The game ended quite quickly with Draco capturing the snitch within the first thirty minutes. All that was left now was the final against Bulgaria.
“But learning how to fly is a wizarding right of passage."
Draco didn’t say anything as he processed the words. Close to the entry hall a woman with dark curly hair waved Potter over and he turned to leave.
Draco felt his heart drop. “What are you talking about?”
As they got up to leave Krum’s eyes locked on to Draco. For a split second, he looked surprised but quickly his features hardened once more. He gave Draco a nod of acknowledgement before following his colleges out the door.
Harry stood over him blocking out the sun.
“Alright,” Blaise tried again. “What about this then, have you ever been in love?”
As Draco stood and dusted the dirt off his pants, a witch came over to greet them, “Welcome to l’Académie de Magie Beauxbâtons.”
“Something like that. Just make sure to drink plenty of water. Oh, and don’t skip any meals even if you’re not hungry.”
Beauxbâtons. I read
implies there is an order to it to begin with.”
“But school is so boring,” he whined. “You should play with me instead.”
Draco kept pace with Harry, biding his time for the right moment. The ground grew closer and closer but Draco kept his eyes on the snitch. Almost there, they were so close now. And there it was. Just a small twitch as the ball veered right a few feet above the ground. Harry pulled up to avoid impact but Draco leaned into it turning the movement into a spiral as he reached for the ball. And that was game. The snitch was his.
Not one to be outdone, Draco sped up pushing his broom to its limit.
Thomas shook his head. “Dad took me to see a specialist last month and they did a bunch of weird spells. They said I didn’t have any dormant magic at all so I’ll never get to come to Beauxbâtons for real.”
“I wish I could be more like you,” Draco confessed. “You have an effortless charm. Everybody loves you. There is no place that you wouldn’t fit in.”
“Mr Malfoy, what do you have to say to those in the Union of European Quidditch Associations who claim you are only here because Harry Potter took a step back this season?”
“What about Krum?” Draco couldn’t help himself.
The man who spoke was younger than any of the other professors Draco had met. Draco had a hard time judging adults’ ages, but he figured the man couldn’t be older than thirty. He had short kinky curls, dark brown skin, and a crooked smile. He was carrying a large cardboard box, that from the sound of it was filled with glass bottles of some sort, and a brown leather briefcase.

girls. He just didn’t seem to understand them. The only girls he had ever really interacted with, besides his mother, were teachers and house-elves.
“Right.” Dubois stood and headed for the door. “Draco, I just want you to know that I care for you and if you ever need anything I am just an owl away.”
Draco sighed. “Assuming that I’m Great Britain's seeker you mean.”
“It means that I have to beat her.”
It was a motley crew to be sure. Draco knew that sometimes the other kids got together to play games or listen to music together. One of the older kids had tried to invite him early in the summer, but Draco had declined. He did not receive another invite, which suited him just fine.
THE GOLDEN AGE OF QUIDDITCH
“Looks like you can outdrink me too.” He gestured towards Draco’s empty bottle.
Draco yanked open the door. “Je descends tout de suite,” he said shutting the door again before the hôtelier could respond.
Draco made a humph-ing noise and turned away in embarrassment. How did this girl, Pansy, know he wasn’t interested? Was he that transparent? He looked at her again and she smiled knowingly. She didn’t seem to think he was weird. Then again she was the one in the boy’s bathroom.
“It’s the final. I should probably sleep.”
Draco wasn’t sure what to make of his new teammates quite yet. But as he changed into his kit he thought maybe, just maybe, he might possibly entertain the idea of making some new friends.
The next day Draco was surprised to find an owl waiting for him, and even more surprised at the letter’s content. He had been invited to play on the national team for the World Cup in June. He flooed Harry immediately.
He looked fierce even if he felt completely wrecked. Taking one last look in the mirror, he slid his mask into place and stepped out into the dark. Draco spent the night partying with strangers before passing out in the early light of morning before waking up and doing it all over again.
After dinner they took a walk. For the first time since she had arrived, Pansy was quiet. Draco knew she was waiting for him to talk. He knew from personal experience that she could wait as long as it took for Draco to break. He wasn’t in the mood for a battle of wills.
, that’s a fancy looking cake. I can see why you might turn your nose down at this stuff if this is the kind of food you’re used to.” He reached a finger in and swiped it across the pastry. A small pop left his lips as he sucked off the frosting. Draco was frozen in place, afraid that if he moved even an inch the emotions would come pouring out of him. The feelings that had come with the gift were still there but they were slowly being overtaken by a rising anger.
Draco had only travelled by portkey once, when his family had left England, and he had been so young he didn’t remember it at all. He knew though that portkey travel was particularly rough especially on one’s stomach, which is why he had skipped breakfast that morning. He would not allow his first moments at Beauxbâtons to be soiled by a bout of portkey-sickness. What a terrible first impression that would make.
Draco stood up from where he had been crouching and nodded. “I just need to say goodbye to Tibby and Melrose first.”
“I know you can.”
“Bullshit.” Draco moved to the other side of the couch. “I didn’t come here to fight.”

“Tibby, take Draco and gather his things. We will be leaving the manor for an indefinite period of time. Melrose and Raynham, you two can help me with the rest.”
Blaise smiled. “We fuck on occasion, though neither of us is exclusive. We hardly see enough of each other for that and this arrangement suits us well.” He paused. “Are you sure I can’t tempt you for one drink?”
After eating, Draco would retire to the drawing room to play the piano while the house-elves cleaned. He always ended the day with a good book before falling asleep and repeating it all again.
“You’re Draco Malfoy.”
Draco gripped the paper tightly, wrinkling it in his hands. Skeeter had everything completely backwards and Draco wondered if she had listened to him at all. She hadn’t even stuck around to see him fly. She heard what she came in wanting to hear and probably had written most of the article before even speaking to Draco. What a joke. Still, Draco couldn’t help but internalize a few of her words.
“What the hell, Potter. Give it back.” Draco moved towards Harry.
Pansy gave Draco another squeeze before letting him go and they made their way back to the flat.
“You seem cheery today,” Pansy commented suspiciously.
Pansy had stopped worrying about him so much now that his grades had improved and he was no longer moping around. They still hung out all the time but Pansy was an independent kind of person and she liked her space, which meant that Draco often found himself with nothing to do and no one to entertain him. Pansy suggested he join a club or find a hobby.
Draco could beat Wimbourne hungover and with a kneazle balanced on his head. He wasn’t worried. And so he let himself get lost in the bottom of a bottle so that he could forget about lightning-shaped scars and round-framed glasses.
“I’m not trying to start a fight. I’ve wanted to bring it up for a while now. I’m worried about you, Draco.”
“Look Draco, I told you when I took you in that you could stay as long as you needed and I meant it.”
“If you trust her, then so do I.”
“You may go now.”
Draco looked down at his shaking hands. The tea smelled like old socks but Draco forced himself to take a sip. It wasn’t as bad as it smelled and had some earthy undertones. Draco finished the rest of it and set the cup down.
Draco rolled over and gave Pansy a tired look.
The next few days were a bit of a blur for Draco. After the Puddlemere match, he grabbed the half-empty bottle of vodka he had stashed under his bed and began to drink. Unfortunately, his alcohol stores were running a bit low, and Draco needed to get good and properly drunk. He tore apart his wardrobe, looking for the perfect outfit before settling on an expensive black turtleneck, a set of sleeveless black robes, and his favourite pair of trousers. He completed the look with a few sharp strokes of eyeliner.
Draco found himself embraced in a warm hug and
“I’ll see you around Potter.” Draco made to leave.
“Your humility is astounding, Potter, but that was just a stupid charity match it doesn’t even count.”
“Realy, Pansy?”
“Here,” she said handing Draco the cup, “drink this.” She moved on to check on whatever was simmering in the cauldron. “It’s valerian tea. It should help with the nerves and those tremors.”
With his signing bonus, Draco had all his moving expenses covered along with first month's rent on a nice apartment plus enough to furnish it and even then there was enough left over for an entirely new wardrobe.
Pansy nodded and closed the door.
He couldn’t perform any kind of magic that might get him in trouble with the ministry. It had to be something that a young wizard might do accidentally. Something that would not alert any muggles. So he focused on erasing errors in his penmanship, adding a little extra flavour to his food, or healing small cuts and bruises.
He had always believed that magic is what gave a person their worth. At only twelve years old, Draco could do things a muggle could only dream of, but what if that was a flawed way of thinking. Draco’s head hurt. He couldn’t think about this anymore today. He stuck all the books on the restock shelf and headed back to his dorm. His world view had completely shattered that day, and he owed Thomas a huge apology. Hopefully, he would forgive him.
And Xavier was eager to comply. Draco quickly lost whatever composure he had summoned and fell to putty under Xavier’s ministrations. He watched as Xavier took his own length in hand getting them both off at the same time.
Everything came to a stop as Draco’s fingers closed around the glittering orb. The crowd erupted.
Blaise switched topics, “You know those witches across the bar have been staring at you this whole time?”
“You’re crazy Potter.”
A few months into Draco’s rookie season he finally met the famed Harry Potter. He had actually seen Potter at the opening gala at the beginning of the season, but they had not interacted. Potter was constantly surrounded by his own personal fanclub. The Tornados weren’t scheduled to play Puddlemere until December but most of the league was in attendance for the equinox dinner, a charitable event hosted by the British and Irish Quidditch League every year.
Draco had purchased a set of bespoke robes for the occasion. They were coloured a brilliant burgundy that complemented his complexion perfectly.
Draco, of course, had already done the reading and so he had no problem picking out some healthy-looking cuttings of rosemary, mint, and basil from among the conservatory’s herbs. They were all easy to identify and had proven to do well in a terrarium environment. As Draco was arranging them in the planter, he felt the composition was missing something. He wandered through the rows of plants until he came across a flowering Boswellia tree. He picked off a few of the blossoms and placed them under a status charm before adding them to his terrarium.
He still remained quiet and a bit distant compared to the others, but he found that they actually cared about what he had to say now and even wanted his opinions on different things. For the first time in his life, Draco had friends, or at least acquaintances - but he figured it was only a matter of time before a true friend came his way, a friend like in the muggle stories he used to read at l'Internat.
The gears in his head began ticking away. There was a lot of work to do, but Draco was excited. Magic was going to be a part of his life once more, and he was going to fix everything no matter what it took.
“It’s just Astronomy, and it’s mostly review. I would do it myself but it is just so boring, not worth my time. Here.” Vanessa handed Draco a small tin. “It’s muggle but it might as well be magic. One of those every morning and you’ll be done with everything by the end of the week. Add my paper to the end of your to-do list and if you don’t get to it, then you don’t get to it.”
One of the chasers, Ryan, asked, “Are you ok? That was quite the fall.”
and have some fun. Surely there was
“I just- I didn’t want you to find out that I’m a squib.”
Draco frowned at the serious tone and set down the shears.
Draco spent the rest of the morning and early afternoon organizing his things and practising small spells with his wand. He couldn’t get all of them to work on the first try but he continued to practice. Eventually, he grew bored and made his way down to the common room to socialize with his new classmates. He spotted a tallish boy with mousy brown hair and a strong jaw who was seated by himself.
match left.
A few days later Draco had finished a new book and gained a new friend. As soon as he had finished the novel he had gone to find Asim and they had stayed up into the night talking about their favourite parts and the characters.
“So how are you feeling about your match with Amélia Mata?”
Draco quickly lost track of time and the number of times his glass had been replaced.
“I told you after
surprise Draco. Even if his father wanted nothing to do with him, he was still a Malfoy. He had pure wizarding blood running through his veins and yet his father was suggesting that he leave all that behind. Beauxbâtons was still three years away. That meant three years of living as a muggle. It was ridiculous, maddening, and completely unfair.
Draco relented, at least the bed applied some sort of pressure to his swollen cock though it wasn’t nearly enough. Draco heard Harry uncork the glass vile and almost groaned in anticipation.
After the game, more people showed up to the house. Draco wasn’t sure but he suspected there were more Weasleys, if that was even possible, there were definitely more Gryffindors. A couple of people brought along food and alcohol and soon enough it was a full-on party.
Draco continued his rigorous study schedule, but every afternoon Thomas tracked him down and dragged him out to the gardens to play. Thomas’ favourite games to play were always sci-fi adventures but Draco taught him about the old expeditions he enjoyed as well. They reached a sort of compromise by pretending to explore distant planets in other galaxies, and Draco found himself actually looking forward to the games of make-believe as much as Thomas himself.
. Let’s get started.”
Sometimes Draco was too clever for his own good. He turned around slowly and walked back over to where Thomas stood.
As a seeker he had reign of the entire pitch, looking out over the chaos below him. That was when he saw it, just a flicker in the air. He would have dismissed it as nothing more than a trick of the light if he hadn’t been looking for it, but as it was there was no mistaking it. Draco shot off like a bolt of lightning. He kept his eyes on his target and didn’t let it out of his sight. The other seeker was still hovering on the pitch, and didn’t notice Draco until it was too late.
“They are - at least on the intramural teams, but the L'Équipe du Feu plays other schools across Europe. It is kind of like our best of the best. It is kind of a big deal, though our team hasn’t been very competitive for a couple of years now. I think that next year we might have a shot at the championship especially if we can get you on board.”
Draco was confused. He had no idea what Dubois could be referring to.
“Why are you still at school during holiday?”
Well, that wouldn’t be an issue with Pansy’s mothering. Draco still wasn’t convinced but he had nothing to lose so he agreed and pocketed the tin.
“No.” Harry looked apologetic but did not say anything more. Didn’t move.
“Can’t he just take both?” Seemed a little tightfisted to only offer one. Draco scowled at her and couldn’t think of why this ever sounded like a plausible idea.
How many Dark Wizard had escaped because of this bullshit?
Such fierce loyalty. Draco returned to the desk, peering out into the open plan of small cubicles and desks.
There was a–another corpse in the Manor, how long until the journalists swooped in?
Harry thudded his head against the bookshelf and Draco chanced a look over his shoulder. Best not have a rumour start he’d tried to murder Harry in the archives with the very archives themselves.
Ginny, the youngest out of such a large family probably was used to small portions out of necessity rather than fancy. Meanwhile Draco wasn’t even sure if he understood the neglect Harry suffered entirely. How did someone ever forget to feed a child? To have such resentment to starve one under their own house? Muggles were strange. But that was so long ago.
“Consider it handled.” The Prophet wasn’t a wand ready to aim and cast at his head. The Greengrasses were aware of the letter, aware it would be spread around. Daphne had given him reasonable time to think over the eventuality this would happen.
This was the best time to leave. Just before the silence returned. Draco did have a busy schedule today and to lower suspicions, he left again on his wings. He needed to Floo to Theo’s. Apparation might point that he was not in the Manor to use that Floo line which would raise the question: where was he?
What to do, what did Draco want to do? The thought of leaving was too much. Nothing outside this room held much of his attention. What would he buy at the Apothecary? Nothing. No Quidditch matches were playing today. Even if he could go to the Muggle world, watch another movie and eat those-- Draco frowned, what were they called again? They wouldn’t go amiss, they were buttery and addictive and Draco wanted some. He wanted some now.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just don’t bite anyone.”
“Harry?”
Harry kept mumbling, potion not as fast acting but certainly potent enough to make Harry stay asleep - but considering the other recipes and their timings, this shouldn't be too much of a stretch.  “Don't worry,” he mumbled and Draco hushed him again and again. “Present, promise. S'fine. ” What Harry was even trying to say didn't manage to come through after that.
Had anyone seen them? Could anyone tell by the look on his face what they'd done?
Taking the balked silence, Draco stood. Harry didn’t shift as Draco led him, hand around trembling wrist, to the closest pensive in the Manor. If Harry had fought him on this point, had pulled his hand away and fled Draco could at least argue back and set aside this panic welling up in himself too. They walked in silence, the occasional scuff of Harry’s trainers reminding Draco this could be it.
Draco blinked as the boy’s mouth moved and nothing came out. Harry didn’t remember, didn’t want to remember, didn’t want Draco to know. They spoke more and Draco tried to push further, go closer and hope to hear what was being said. The boy seemed to recognise he was being rescued and smiled, let Harry scoop him up and wrap him in his Auror robes.
“Can I—” Harry gulped down a breath.
“You thought I wanted Pansy’s sloppy seconds and now I’m going to seduce Luna?” Draco raged, only to quieten himself as some people began to take notice of who was arguing in Diagon Alley, “It’s not my fault Blaise just needs to say a few words and you believe everything he says.” Draco scowled, “Luna is a friend. Why don’t I accuse you of shagging Hermione?”
“Bloody hell, I am trying to help find out who tried to kill you!” Harry wasn’t angry per se, not in a way that would spill magic. This self-righteous twaddle was once thought of as an act. It was however, a terrible trait Draco wished Potter had outgrown in the last years. “Would it hurt you so much to answer my questions?”
“Albus said that?” It wasn’t fair to say Albus betrayed him - he held no loyalty - but it hurt, leaving Draco cold and hollow.
“That means your excused, Blaise.” Draco stood up slow, rubbing his fingers against knotted muscle. How long had he slept hunched over? Bloody Blaise, didn’t know a thing about posture.
“Hey, hey, I’m not going to touch you, okay?” Harry said and his magic on Draco’s feathers wasn’t too bad. Draco wanted to restart the day. The bell above the door rang and another potential customer arrived. Draco knew that one too and with as much force as he could achieve despite his injuries, bit into Mary’s arm and flapped, trying desperately to fly away. The man walked with a swagger, held a cocky expression that said to Draco.
“I didn’t have to learn this before.”
“Having you and Potter in the same room as the potion I’m trying to brew is asking the Fates to ruin it.” Returning to chop up the rest of the rose thorns, Draco pretended everything was perfectly fine. Potter was taking up too much room and Blaise wouldn’t sniff out Draco’s lie: that this was a comfortable position to stand in while caring for three boiling cauldrons and that Potter wasn’t in the way.
“We could try again. To make sure you’re sure.”
“Potter, here again I see.” Blaise didn’t sound too friendly. “Came to see how you were doing, considering the Prophet.”
“Is he? From Blaise I take it,” Draco trailed off, knew he still couldn’t say a thing about magic. Lie it was. “He’s got the impression there’s more Dark Wizards around. He’s quite adamant I know them.”
“Siobhan.” Draco grit his own teeth, “What potion did you hand him?” She froze and Charlie looked as angry as Draco felt.
They arrived at the door, another entrance from the hallway instead of going through the bedroom. “Most of the memories I had stored of Astoria are in here.” He glanced to the door, clear of any damage. “I haven’t been in to check how much was lost.”
Launching into how these phones worked in more detail was an interesting distraction. Absorbing not so much, between the moments of silence he wondered if he was going to suffer consequences for the destruction of a Greengrass family heirloom. Daphne would notice, without a doubt. Scorpius would notice. Blaise would too, he was an observant sort. Nott wouldn’t and not many others who really conversed with Draco under the guise of purebloods sticking together would either.
That probably sounded a tad more romantic than ‘I was too busy undoing the unending guilt that was ruining my life’.
. His peace offering, gone. Refuse his help? Have magic ruin everything then, Potter.
His day was ruined.
“No, plan whatever you can for the next meal. I don’t think I can take any more lukewarm pizza.”
“In a bit of a mess, yes. Could you make something, an early dinner, if you could. I’m going to shower and then this one needs a bath too.”
Oh. Don’t dare fucking smile. Remember how mad, he made him. Don’t smile. Don’t encourage him, don’t encourage this. Don’t think about how uplifted the bloody sight of him was.
He had one shoe on before he remembered the key item, “
“So, we’re just going to keep this to ourselves,” Harry said and nodded. For a second he raised his cup to his mouth, only to realise what he was doing before lowering it again without taking a drink. Draco was offended. He wouldn’t poison tea.
“Stop it. It was Blaise, he did it. He said ‘sorry’ before he hexed me in the face.” For once, Draco didn’t try and keep the welling dam hidden.
Oh, no. A litter of tiny little crups? Newborn crups? Urgh, that would be adorable. Maybe it best Draco didn’t see  - he wasn’t sure he could keep his expression cool and neutral. Cool and neutral, right. Draco sighed out a steady breath, he was just standing there, Harry was talking and still he hadn’t felt like a kid letting the adults talk even when he was a kid. So why now?
“Everything’s fine, stop fussing.”
It wouldn’t be closed with just this, but the blood would slow and that’s all Draco could ask for being without knowing too much on how one even went about curing an Unseamed. He yelped every time a new one was added, a thin covering Draco wasn’t sure would last more than ten minutes, give or take. But time was what he needed. Now, now he just had to stop being such a – what was the phrase again? A sitting duck. Right. He just had to deal with these stairs.
“Unless he attacked because you were there?” Harry didn’t seem to enjoy that line of thought and Hermione backpedalled, “Not you, specifically but the Aurors.”
Crinkling the stacks Harry spelled them smaller and smaller until they dropped into a bag no longer taking up the entire floor. “Nott and then to the office to return what we don’t need.”
“Well, shall we?” He offered his arm and Siobhan took it without Draco worrying over rejection. Unlike the real world, where Draco would and could be rejected with ease it was not so simple in the world of yule balls and political functions. It would call the other person crude, petty and it was smarter for everyone to pretend all were friends.
Perhaps that was when Harry remembered he was a wizard capable of magic. “
“I’m really sorry.” The smile was painful to even look at.
Swallowing the lump in his throat he couldn’t allow this to happen, “No one will know? Not even that husband of yours?” He was spiteful, he was stuck.
Scorpius took his mother’s hand and marched off to the garden in the inner sanctum. The mud-cake, decorated with dying leaves and small stones was presented with so much gusto and enthusiasm, Draco ended up sitting down on the bench to laugh while Astoria tried desperately to compliment it (and also give an excuse to not have a bite).
“Exactly. Good. We can go tomorrow.” He wiped his hands on his trousers before stretching up to the banister and hauling himself up to his feet. Despite the effort needed, the way veins raised under his skin Draco didn’t help, didn’t offer a hand because he was certain Harry didn’t actually want help. He’d sulked and bickered and hated how he hadn’t walked up those stairs to the lab before.
Another ghost of a touch over the mark. Funny really, how everyone fawned over Harry and his scars until the War. Until it wasn’t just a bedtime story about a baby defeating evil. Remnants of wars were always scars, one way or another.
“Research everything you can before going in to speak with him. He doesn’t suffer fools and one refusal from him and most will close their doors. The others will take you on purely because he refused. And you’ll be lucky if you ever get your name attributed to your work.”
“How long does that take?” Harry snapped and wouldn’t appreciate it but Draco needed to settle this with Potter as quickly as possible. He still needed to message Hermione about sending the form back, concealed. Harry couldn’t complain too much if Draco was walking off to help him. So, Harry was abandoned in the ruined sitting room, and he headed for his laboratory.
Well, he and Harry wouldn’t be doing that any time soon.
Harry didn’t stop Scorpius from coming over and hovering close to the post. Draco was well accustomed to the expression of Scorpius wanting to coo and pet over an animal. The day Draco refused to buy a crup was a war in itself. Tears, snot, screaming - Draco wanted that day to end then because he had considered he was being an awful father, worse than his own. The first few months of Astoria’s death was rough on both of them.
He chirped, but nipped at the air as Hary returned to sit down. His agreement wasn’t an absolute forever. Just today, since Hermione had said so.
And then he felt Harry’s fingers without the layer of clothing as an intermediary when he started on his neck.
No one could claim it outright, too many families married in and out, too much demand and too little evidence to keep it contained within one family. So, for once, they might’ve shared it. Sharing in Pureblood terms. They all had to attend else they skip out on the chance to call it their own. Half-Bloods were exceptional gossip and brought to shove their nose in it as a plus-one.
“Destroy them and I won’t kill you on sight.”
Draco was silent. So silent he wished his presence would disappear between these tacky seats and devour his very memory of this. Whatever this was and why he was here. Thinking his questions might be answered was not wise; he had more questions especially to what Harry was carrying in a bucket. Food. In a bucket. What were Muggles?
“Are you mad because I mentioned your magic?”
“A bar fight?” Harry sounded different on the phone. Draco muttered to Luna what to say.
Scorpius had been in danger and he hadn’t even known about it. Danger like the damage to the sitting room and those adjacent. He hadn’t seen it from behind glass or read it in a book: he’d been in the same position, a vortex of magic out of control.
They were having dinner, no doubt no different from the other food they’d eaten before. The only difference was how Draco felt about it. Bloody Merlin – what was he supposed to do now? They’d eaten together last time.
“Apparently not.” Draco paused, took note of how Harry was scowling at the floor as if it didn’t fit his tastes. Draco relented the newspaper and set it aside, “Oh, just spit it out. I’m not dying am I?”
“Talk to Ginny. Then, then I will look for someone, okay?” Before Draco could question him on why this was the key point in finding help, an ultimatum in itself. “Whatever will be, will be.”
seed pouch.” It whizzed out of a drawer, landed in Draco’s hand as he tried to pocket it and deal with the weary old man looking back at him in the mirror. Draco rubbed his hand over his jaw, he could take time to rid himself of the stubble but his skull couldn’t take much more. Greeting Potter, appearing unshaven was another intolerable option. Scowling, newly woken and with another cramp from his stomach, Draco marched downstairs.
Scorpius ate his slow, the rising red on his jaw and in his eyes told Draco enough. Anger was always secondary, not many seemed to realise it. Anger was a response towards a threat or harm potential or already done. Albus had fucked up, to put it lightly. Draco remembered how utterly (and mildly disturbing at the time) he talked about being brothers with one Albus Potter. The boy was his only friend for years, isolated and ever grateful for the chance to show he wasn’t like all the papers said.
