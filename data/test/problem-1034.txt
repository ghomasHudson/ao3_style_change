With that, he set the flowers gently on the step at Draco’s feet and turned to mount his horse. He was gone as quickly as he’d come.
Three horses were making their way through the throngs. Atop the lead mare sat a tall woman, her glossy red hair falling down her back in a loose tail and her rich satin robes rippling with the movement of her horse. A thin gold crown twisted over her brow, the leaves and designs rivaling Narcissa’s. Queen Lily.
“Yeah, fine, thanks,” Harry calls over his shoulder as he shoves everything away in one bag and manages to stand. “You know how—”  and oh
It’s not a date, though. He’s pretty sure. He’d like it to be— love it to be, wishes it to be, would readily agree for it to be— but Harry’s hot and his age and lives across the hall, and the odds of him being single and remotely interested on top of that are depressingly low. Draco doesn’t have that kind of luck. He’s aware that he’s not unattractive, but he’s been told he has too much of a resting bitch face. In a bout of insecurity he’d once asked Theo whether he’d ever hit on Draco if they didn’t know one another. Theo’s answer was along the lines of “I’d notice you but you’d scare the shit out of me, so no.”
“The pleasure was all mine, and it’s only ten minutes at a gallop,” Riven tilted his head. “I enjoy the wind and the sky. It’s better than seeing the inside of a castle all day.”
“How may I help you today?” His smile was strained. “Is there something else we can make you?” An awful thought occurred to him. “Was the necklace unsatisfactory?” His mother would have his neck.
Harry’s not going to wake him. He’s not, really. It’s a petty thing to disturb Draco over, and he has terrible trouble falling asleep after he’s been woken. Harry can be patient and focus on something pleasant, like the feeling of Draco’s silky cheek against his as he turns his head to—
He felt peaceful, wonderfully, boringly domestic, for the first time in what felt like months until—
“Of course, Your Majesty.” Draco congratulated himself when his voice didn’t falter. Pansy and Blaise had moved back to the other side of the stall to give him some room to work his charm, and he set about digging through small boxes immediately. “Almost all our crafts are inherently magical and therefore naturally regenerative and repellent.” He paused. “May I ask what you’re hoping to shield against?”
“You just need to be a bit more subtle,” Hermione said. “Draco is a Slytherin. He appreciates the things left unsaid, the meaningful gestures. And crass flirting will get you nowhere—Dennis tries it every time Draco comes to our floor.”
“Oh my fucking Merlin, he’s asking you out!” Cho shouts over the cubicle wall. Harry and Malfoy both jump.
The choice was made for him when Draco shrugged stiffly and reached for the hem of his clothes. Harry braced himself, leaning forward unconsciously. Draco didn’t make a fuss out of it, pulling his shirt up and pushing his joggers down a bit with the sort of indifference Harry had long since learned to be wary or.
“Er, thank you,” he said. “Really. I know I’ve been… a lot, lately, and I know it’s annoying. But… thanks, Ron.”
He stared at the words after he was finished—the hints of ink he’d vanished to reform a phrase or two, the curve of the lettering. It was truthful, but it felt like it was lacking something. A sentence, a certain life, Harry didn’t know. But he wanted to give it to Draco—he wanted an answer, he wanted to be clear.
, of all people. He consoled himself with the knowledge that Draco wouldn’t date someone like Smith even if Voldemort’s rebirth was on the horizon and their union was the only way to stop armageddon.
“Now he listens,” Ron snorted. “Put your eyes back in your head before you get a harassment claim filed against you.”
He didn’t have to actually ask him out, Harry told himself as he walked. Just some light flirting would do. Surely he was capable of that—he’d gotten five pairs of knickers in the mail last Valentine’s Day. Clearly, he must have some general public appeal. Hopefully.
He set a plate of jems aside to reach a carved wooden box and lifted it up to the queen, popping off the lid. Riven chose that moment to step closer and as he shifted Draco unintentionally breathed in the rich scent of his perfumed clothes. He hesitated before dipping gloved fingers in to lift a necklace from the box. As he twisted it, the chain caught the light and flashed blue-black.
But the air was cool, the Soho lights were glowing red and pink and blue from down the street, and their little bus stop was empty save for a soggy newspaper and what looked to be a dry and happy rat. Harry hadn’t gone over to investigate—there was plenty of room for him and Malfoy at their end of the awning, thanks very much.
Silence descends over their cubicle. Malfoy eyes Ron’s chair, but wisely chooses to remain standing. Harry notices belatedly that his robes are trimmed in silver, the same shade at his eyes.
“Yeah, I suppose.” Harry snorted, even though he was sure Draco didn’t intend for it to be funny. “But on the other hand, think about all the places they could take you now. You’ve knocked some of the worst ones out of the park, wouldn’t you say?”
He wondered not for the first time what it was that gave him such rotten luck when it came to love. From his first kiss he’d felt like a disaster, lost and uncertain, entirely unsure of what he really wanted and how to go about getting it.
Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron, the petty bastard, threw up a quick privacy charm around his section of the desk. He would have dismantled the wards, but when he raised his wand, his inkpot started hovering threateningly, tilting to aim for his head. Harry sighed and stood. There was nothing for it. He could do this.
“Yeah, and I’m going to be hearing about ‘nothing’ every five minutes in annoying little fractions for the next hour.”
Draco looks at him so quickly his neck twinges. Potter’s staring down at the water, glasses reflecting the lights. There’s no way for Potter to have found out about the bond, not unless he’s had a magical core exam. As far as Draco knows the symptoms shouldn’t have manifested in him—he’s not the one with Creature blood, after all. And the list of people who know about Draco’s Veela heritage is slim.
The weather had been holding at a pleasant warmth, the blue sky filled with the clouds that were so crisply cut they reminded Draco of cream on a pastry. There was a light breeze in the air and the smell of sweet spices wafting through town. Draco loved fall.
“I see.” Draco spun the ring between his fingers mindlessly. His cheeks were burning as he stared at the ground. He felt utterly humiliated, and couldn’t shake the sick feeling that he’d done something irreparable.
Slowly, by feeble increments, he tried to let go. It wasn’t really letting go at all, but rather accepting the truth the way it stood. Draco’s fantasies wouldn’t return Harry to him. He was dead to Draco now, a figment of memory that Draco had crafted into a sculpture of love. Never something to hope for. Draco felt sick as he forced himself to say the words, whisper them louder and louder until he was almost shouting. Harry was gone.
spend all night doing just that, alongside trying not to murder his boyfriend in his sleep. It’s not so bad at first— indeed, Harry was just thinking about how soothing Draco’s voice is— but that’s before the thirtieth repetition. Then the sixtieth. It begins to pound away in Harry’s ears, but it it’s a matter of pride now. He refuses to be beaten by a ditty. The currants go on, and on, and
Draco was not going to risk anything, least of all his stomach. Weasleys in general were one thing. He did not need to see them in the sheets, thanks very much.
to Draco— which is mortifying and hits far too close to dangerous topics. But by the time Harry’s decided to burn the message and never think that sentence again, his shin is already smacking into the coffee table. His thumb misses delete and hits send with stomach-dropping finality.
People were parting down the center of the street, but there was no procession like those held when the king came through. They were only making room and showing respect.
“What does that even mean?” Harry mutters petulantly. Draco rolls his eyes and sets the cookies down on the coffee table, but the corner of his mouth is turned up in just a hint of a smile, so Harry takes it as a win. Pea is placed in Harry’s usual spot on the couch, but Harry hardly even notices. The cat is too cute for argument and Draco’s arse as he bends over is simply—
“Malfoy,” Harry acknowledges with a polite nod. The stillness around them is most certainly plummeting towards awkward.
In truth, Draco had the sinking suspicion that he was the only person in town who Harry spoke to at any length. They would often run into each other in one shop or another, and it was almost tradition for them to pause and have a merry old row before huffing off in opposite directions once more. Draco would have been convinced Harry hated him if it wasn’t for the alarming frequency with which their paths kept intersecting.
Draco sputters, but Harry just grins and kisses him again, so he doesn’t dwell on the embarrassment for long. There are more important things to worry about.
“I’d really rather we were both sober for this conversation. It’s pretty clear I cocked it up last time.” He grins sheepishly at Draco, his smile all crooked.
“Not with that attitude I don’t.” Harry laughed and earned himself a pinch for his troubles. “Don’t act like you did something grand, you clearly want to date me too.”
“What chivalry,” Harry heard him mutter, but his cheeks were pink again, and he lifted his hands to tuck them under the dangling ends of the scarf. Harry’s heart sped up at the sight.
“You’re always on him,” Seamus cut in. “There’s no way you haven’t. You’re attached at the bleeding hip.”
They’re in the gardens at the Manor, somewhere back past the lily ponds but before the rose bushes and the fields. He can’t even see the house from this far away, and it makes Draco feel a bit fae, a bit enchanted— the only thing around is flowers. Harry bumps into the low hanging wisteria and they both snort as petals come drifting down around them.
and that’s not something unique to Harry’s observations. There’s not a witch or wizard alive who wouldn’t notice that head of bubblegum bobbing between the Auror cubicles.
“Hello,” he nods back before bending down to get it in as dignified a manner as possible. As he does, however, he forgets the open door behind him and a lump of tufted fur flies between his legs and out into the hall. Draco drops all his envelopes (again) and promptly dives after his demon of a cat, but Pea is already out of his reach. His gut swoops in panic right as Harry leans down and scoops the monster up before it manages to dodge past him and towards the stairwell.
He finally produced a thin wooden box tied with a silver ribbon. Draco didn’t recognize it, but neither did he question it when Harry handed it to him. With gentle fingers he untied the silk and pried back the lid to reveal—
,” Ron practically whooped, “and then you told him your dick was big? Fuck, Harry, how are you even standing? That’s brutal!”
“I’m fine, never better,” Harry said, in what he hoped was a casual tone. Ron snorted beside him, so to emphasize the casualness of how fine he really was, Harry slipped his arms into his pockets and leaned back against the wall.
“Er,” Harry’s just taken a bite and he stops with half the cookie in his mouth. He swallows and looks around. “...no? I’m a neat person.”
He stepped closer, intending to hand Draco the cup across the counter separating them. But to his utter dismay, the wet plastic chose that exact moment to slip from his fingers.
“I’d love to hear you call me that, if it’s what you wish.” Harry reached out to run his fingers over Draco’s cheek, reminding him of the tears still clinging to his skin. This time he didn’t pull away.
“That’s not it!” Draco hissed for the third time. He didn’t mean to be so caustic, but Riven was digging into an unhealed wound. “You don’t understand, that’s not what I— I can’t talk to you about this.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened, but he didn’t protest when Harry wrapped the knitted wool around his neck, bundling him up to the nose.
It’s Draco, of course, but a startled laugh bubbles out of Harry before he can stop it. In one hand he’s clutching a plate with a monstrous amount of sugar cookies piled on it and with the other he’s struggling to hold onto an equally massive and complaining calico.
The bus stopped at a light, throwing them forward a bit, but it was as good an excuse as any for Harry to wrap his arms tighter around his grumbling parcel.
“I’ve been baking,” Draco says without thinking. Harry looks intrigued, however, so he plows on. “I made 48 cookies yesterday, actually.” Harry laughs. “No, really. I mean, I’ve been watching quite a bit of Netflix too.”
He still poked Draco in the side for good measure, just to feel him squirm. He settled back down with a huff and Harry found his spot on the page again. Draco’s soft shirt was riding up over his stomach, and Harry unconsciously let his fingers linger over the warm skin, tracing gently. With the heat from the fire on his other side he could just feel the beginnings of sleep tugging at his muscles.
At first, Harry doesn’t mind. It's the same two words, repeated in a tired loop, and he finds his mind humming along, riding the waves of Draco’s little pattern. He has a high, clear voice, the sort Harry would want a lullaby sung in. It’s not particularly refined or in tune, but it’s heartfelt and amusing. Harry thinks he’d like to spend all night listening to Draco sing about currants.
“Haven’t a clue, just asking. Most everyone suspects he’s making a bit of a move on you, that’s all. I don’t see the appeal; he’s rather awkward, and he might make bedroom eyes at you but he always hides under that vile hood so you can’t see them anyway. And you’re— well, you’re you, darling.” Blaise sent him a truly shit-eating grin.
“Apologies,” Riven sounded like he was smiling. “But you remind me of my mother.” Draco could pinpoint the moment Narcissa melted. How gloriously predictable. His mother approved of the prince.
“Here!” he says quickly. “Here’re your currants, Draco. I’m terribly sorry, it was entirely my mistake.”
“I can share my login with you.” He doesn’t mind at all, really, even though he barely knows Harry and that just goes to show how weak Draco is for that mussed up hair.
“Merlin, that’s really good, because I’ve been driving myself mental thinking about you,” Potter admits.
“Pea,” Draco blurts from his position on the floor. He quickly gathers the papers around him and shoves them out of sight into his apartment before standing.
“Please don’t be angry,” Harry said quickly, managing to catch Draco’s hand before he pulled away. “Draco, just listen.” When Draco just sat frozen, Harry took it as his cue to continue. “I’m James and Lily’s son, but I am also who you know me as. I’ve never lied to you. I have... difficulty, socializing with the court. I hate being confined to this castle. A year ago, it became too much for me. I went away for awhile— took torn clothing, spare change, just the bare things. I found Charlie, and he offered me a place to stay. It was easy to pass as a traveler settling down in Godric's Hollow. I didn’t expect to get close to anyone. I certainly didn’t expect to meet you.”
Harry’s stomach clenched unpleasantly. Did he really want to see this? The proof that Draco could never—
“Truth,” Draco finally said. He was wrapped in a blanket on the floor between Hermione and Blaise, his hair mussed up at the nape of his neck.
Perhaps he should have expected fireworks—he had bought Draco roses, after all. And while his chest certainly felt particularly fluttery, what overwhelmed Harry more was the bone-deep joy and relief.
“Don’t give me halfhearted falsities. You look ill. You haven’t been eating, or sleeping from what I hear. Please talk to me, I only want to help. I hate to see you upset.”
“So you’re trying to instigate? Rip the bandage off?” She nodded sagely. “Good on you, Weasley. He needs someone to talk to about it. Merlin knows it’s not going to be one of us.”
“Draco, I like you,” Harry says. Draco’s cheeks are absolutely burning. He thinks he could dance. He’s terrible at dancing. “Like,
Draco barely had time to take in muddy shoes and torn trousers before his shoulders straightened unconsciously and his stomach flipped.
Draco’s still chanting. It’s a simple little two note tune, and he wiggles as he hums it, his speech slurred with sleep.
“—as friends. Because my intended date ran out the door before I could even get his address.” Harry’s still smiling, and then he reaches out and takes both of Draco’s hands in his, and Draco can’t even think. “I know it’s a little far-fetched to assume you’d be interested in me, Potty Potter and all that, but are you? A little?”
With a satisfying splash, it landed in the center of Draco’s simmering potion. They both stared as the straw sank slowly below the surface.
Draco’s soft laugh was muffled as he pressed closer to Harry’s side. That’s one thing he hadn’t been prepared for when he finally extended a new offer of friendship to Draco— how tactile he was. In the hallways and classrooms Draco rarely even shook hands with his classmates, but in the privacy of the common room he might as well have used Harry and Pansy instead of chairs or a couch. Even Ron had gotten the startling treatment of having Draco fall asleep on his shoulder— he stayed so tense the entire time he’d ended up having to go to Pomfrey for soreness, and no one had let him live it down.
“Do you think…” Hermione bit her lip as she extracted herself from Pansy’s arms. “Malfoy, could we— could we see it?”
Or would he? Had Harry even liked him that much from the beginning? Courtings never lasted long, usually skipping to marriage fairly fast, and that’s what everyone insisted Harry had been doing— building up to ask Draco to court, at the very least. Even Draco had somewhat believed it. Had hoped.
Draco’s not sure where this is going, but that certainly isn’t what he expected. After their drunken night together, he’d imagined Potter doing many things—denying it, pretending it didn’t happen, perhaps even threatening Draco into silence. Certainly not bringing it up calmly, if a bit insecurely.
Unlike his lab, Draco’s office was entirely impersonal. He was as meticulous about cleaning up as he was about making a mess every time he worked. Most evenings not even a paperweight decorated his bare desk. Tonight, however, a teetering stack of case files and potions books stared back at Harry. Papers were spread across the dark wood, tumbling out of the wastepaper basket and peaking out of a few drawers.
“Fancy seeing you here, Malfoy,” he said. Harry straightened and spun around, running a quick hand through his hair and over his beard. In the brief moments they’d been talking to Savage, he’d lost sight of Draco amongst the milling Aurors. He’d somehow managed to migrate over to their corner of the room, and was nodding stiffly to Ron.
,” Blaise was clearly annoyed, but in the heat it didn’t take much. “Get down and help me or I’ll flip this stall into the candlemaker’s.”
Discouraged by his apparently un-threatening aura, Harry glances away in time to see Malfoy get a hearty pat on the shoulder (he doesn’t like that, either) and turn towards— towards
“Oh, so sorry,” she gasped as she tried to hold on to the stack of books in her arms. Draco quickly cast a lightening charm. “Thanks.”
But when Harry pulled himself together and finally made his way into the office, the sight that greeted him was—ordinary.
Harry picked at a spot on the table, pulling at a splinter of wood. “We left the letter in his front pocket, yeah? The one he uses for his wand?”
“Not that it's any business of yours,” he finally said, "but I don't have one." There were murmurs of sympathy from around the circle. It was rare, but some marks never came. Harry tried to push down the disappointment in his chest. He ran a hand over the curved white teardrop on his hip. It was half of a Muggle symbol, Hermione had explained to him. Somewhere there was a person with a matching white mark, and it wasn't Draco.
Harry really has no idea why he’s arguing. This is Malfoy— pink-haired, blushing Malfoy— handing himself over on a silver-trimmed platter, and he mentally slaps himself for putting up any sort of resistance.
“I’m really sorry, Harry,” he said. “Malfoy’s… he’s going with Smith tonight, yeah. I only found out this morning from Ernie.”
“My given name is Riven,” Harry answered instantly. “Harry is a nickname. My mother wanted to name me Harold. It’s what people close to me call me. Harry Potter is an alias.”
When a knock finally did sound at the door and Draco flung it open, however, Riven did not step inside. He looked tense, his hands clutched tight at the edges of his fur cloak, his head down.
“We can call it off,” Riven’s voice, for once, was chillingly emotionless. It was painful to hear. “There’s still time to step back, if we’re doing something we’ll regret later—“
“Your explanation had better start improving,” Draco forced out. “Before I rip that look off your face.”
“Irresponsible! Reckless endangerment! A violation of laboratory rules! If I hadn’t seen you fly myself I’d assume you catch snitches with magnets, you sausage-fingered muppet!” Robards paused for breath, mustache quivering and what looked to be several droplets of spittle stuck in his beard. “You’ll be cleaning that lab up by hand, and if Malfoy’s gracious enough to kick you in the arse while you do it, call me so I can watch!”
“That’s great,” Harry grins. “I mean, that’s a great idea. Quarantine slumber party?” Draco can’t help the laugh that snorts out of him. “Come over around six?”
, Ronald?” Hermione hissed. A splotch of ink was spreading across her half-finished essay and she looked perfectly livid.
“I won’t claim it didn’t affect me,” he murmured. “I’m a coward at heart, and I chose to give up. I thought I’d have more of a chance if I was my true self, and impromptu marriage proposals are much more of a commonality in my world than in yours. So Harry left the town for good and Riven came instead. Though now I understand that I may have been mistaken. I’m sorry, a thousand times over. I should have told you the truth from the start. I should have just spoken to you, I know. Forgive me.”
“Well, you did ask me to,” Draco says smartly, but he bites his lip all the same. “I mean, I can put him back—"
Wedding plans for Riven’s birthday were arranged at frightening speed. When Draco hinted at a wish for more time, Queen Lily brushed him off with a smile and a mention of tradition. His world was a whirlwind of anticipation and arrangement. Draco felt hollowed out every moment of it.
“Right, yeah,” Harry’s flushing suddenly, running a hand through his hair. He pats over his shirt and then runs his palms down his thighs, and Draco just gives him a bemused smile. He’s similarly relieved not to be holed up in the parlour with his parents for the entire afternoon.
It took him longer than he would have liked to get to the lounge. It was across the castle in the East Wing, a large room filled with couches and armchairs and tables, with lovely windows and a large fireplace. Draco rarely got to make use of it— glares and constant muttering didn’t a good studying environment make.
Harry shrugged, picking up his book and hefting it a little higher above his face. The position wasn’t exactly comfortable, but the story was just picking up and he didn’t feel like moving.
“You both better shut up if you want to actually see the rumors,” Blaise commented nonchalantly. Pansy froze before whipping around. She grabbed Draco’s arm tightly and he sucked in a breath at her unpleasantly pointed nails.
Hurt flashed in Malfoy’s grey eyes. He looked down at his hands, pale fingers thin and stark in the dim light. “If you hadn’t thought I’d changed, why did you invite me out for drinks?” he asked in a quiet voice.
“And we are most grateful to you in turn.” Riven bowed his head. “In truth, I’d love to hear more about your craft.”
Harry looked up sharply at that. Draco had shifted his books to one arm, and reached out to brush his fingers over the petals of a nearby rose. There was a look of near-awe on his face, his lips barely slack and his cheeks kissed with pink. The moment grew still around them. Harry felt as if he were on the brink of something, the longing in his chest growing to an unbearable ache as he watched Draco take in the room. As he himself finally took in the fact that Draco was here, with him, on a night that he was supposed to be attending the most elegant party of the winter.
Harry isn’t sure what Pea has done to warrant the icy tone, but he’s distracted from figuring it out by the show Draco’s pulled up on the TV.
Draco, for all his currant-related madness, smiles a happy little smirk and snuggles into his pillow again. Harry eyes him in resigned defeat. Bested by berries at last.
“It was his office we were in,” Ron explained. “I didn’t notice, and I guess you didn’t either. The parchment, it was personalized.”
“Why do they make these things so bloody uncomfortable?” he muttered. “I’m five seconds away from just sitting in your lap.”
The bus grew quiet, or as quiet as a moving bus could be. Rain was streaking down the front window, distorting the traffic lights. Somewhere ahead of them a horn blared in the night.
“Thought I’d—wait forever for you to do that,” Draco breathed in between kisses. Harry didn’t have the presence of mind at the moment to reply to the unspoken insecurity, nor the patience to explain just how often he’d tried. But he backed Draco against the wall and grasped blindly for his hands, already spellbound by the feeling of him and determined to show his dedication in every gesture.
“I didn’t want it to be a choice,” Draco finally said hoarsely. “Because if it was, then there was a chance I'd make the wrong one. I just wanted this one thing to be— not to be an ‘if’.”
hair,” Malfoy admits. He seems to regret saying it, and tries to make up for his embarrassment by adopting a suave position leaning against Harry’s desk. He misses and stumbles slightly before righting himself.
“You flatter me, Your Highness,” she said swiftly. “Please, do pass on our greatest thanks to her. Anything we can do for her or for you, it shall be done.”
Draco’s such a perfect sleeper: he curls into a tight ball, hands clasped against his chest and knees pulled up towards his chin. He’s never stolen a blanket, never snored, never kicked— he stays still as a statue, sleep-soft and warm under the covers. With the way he tucks his head, he even fits perfectly in the cradle of Harry’s body on cold nights. There’s nothing Harry doesn’t love about it.
The problem wasn’t Harry’s growing physical attraction to his roommate, however. As far as he was concerned, there was no shame in finding him fit. The issue was how much he genuinely enjoyed Draco's company. Once they’d worked past their differences, they’d gotten along swimmingly. Draco was witty and smart, and unlike the rest of the school he treated Harry much the same as he had before the War. This time around, however, the insults were traded jokingly and the cynical remarks put a smile on Harry’s face. Draco wouldn’t be Draco without bitching about anything and everything and verbally picking apart every teacher at breakfast.
Draco kissed him quietly, softly. When he pulled back Harry had just enough time to see the sparkle of magic across his lips before he pulled Draco back down.
“Fuck, Potter,” Draco cried out, a hand coming up to cup his face. At least Harry thought that’s what he was doing. He couldn't really tell, because his glasses had tumbled in two sad pieces to the floor, and everything was suddenly rather blurry.
The line inside the cafe was short, only a tall businessman in a pinstriped suit and an elderly woman waiting in front of him. By the time he walked up to the register the second cashier was taking care of the woman’s order. The girl behind the till gave him a teasing wink as she looked him up and down. His eyes were drawn to her dark lipstick when she smirked. Her name tag said Pansy, with a swirling, loopy 'Y'.
, Blaise mouthed at him when he turned. Pansy’s eyes were darting between the money and a distant point that Draco was sure was Riven’s retreating arse. He just shook his head to show Blaise he was equally shocked. Good for business, indeed.
Draco chose that moment to laugh at something Cho said, and Harry’s heart flipped in his chest. No, a rejection certainly would not have been better.
“Hold the door!” Harry called out, and Draco turned in surprise. But he did press a hand to the closing doors, leaving a gap wide enough to walk through. Harry jogged the final few steps, intending to do just that, when he stepped on the loose lace of his shoe.
Harry stepped between Draco’s legs and bent to press their lips together. His hands ran over Draco’s chest and down his arms before coming to cradle his face. Harry kissed like he’d never seen Draco before, never touched him, and perhaps he never truly had. Not without some chasm of uncrossable restraint. And God, Draco couldn’t get enough of Harry’s skin.
“Please be at ease,” the prince said, the voice once again echoing in Draco’s ears. He shook it off.
“You left before I woke up the other night—that morning,” Potter continues with a cough. “I wasn’t sure if I’d done something wrong.”
It’s as good as Draco remembers, and a thousand times better, because the way Harry holds him is because it’s
Harry stood quietly for a few moments, trying to think of what to say. The doubt that he was wrong still hung tightly in his mind. He’d never seen a mark that remotely resembled his own until now, and evidently neither had Draco. Yet the possibility of having him for a moment only to realize he’d been mistaken still loomed bitter and cutting.
Blaise rolled his eyes none too subtly at his friend’s antics. “Rather than continue making a tit of yourself, you could help me get these necklaces untangled.”
Draco doesn’t watch her go, just listens to the crunch of gravel under her shoes, and when the sound fades he stands. He doesn’t know these grounds—the mansion the Ministry rented is originally Muggle—but he can hear running water, and he decides to just follow the path for now.
“I did, actually.” And here he was, doing it, having a conversation with Draco Malfoy in a lift, even after his disastrous start. He only had to find something else to say, something concerning shoes, something a bit flirtatious. Something like— “I was a size bigger than I thought. And you know what they say about shoe size.”
Harry stands still hoping for the floor to swallow him up already. He’s ruined it, he knows he has, and he’s not even surprised about that— he’s surprised he got this far, to be honest. Draco is witty and fit and seems to have a good job and excellent taste. He’s eye-catchingly beautiful and honestly far out of Harry’s league. He even likes Star Wars, for Christ’s sake.
Harry ground his teeth. He knew he wasn’t the smoothest flirt, perhaps not even a passable one, but level-headed Hermione thrived on fixing problems, and he felt problematic enough at the moment to warrant
In Harry’s opinion, that was the best part. It made Draco look soft and huggable—two words no one had ever used to describe a Malfoy. Harry wanted to wrap him in blankets, sit him on his couch, and watch him open presents. Presents Harry had gotten him, preferably.
“You’re beautiful in moonlight,” Draco whispered. “I wanted to tell you on that night in the snow. You glow.”
Somewhere a hopeful little bird was chirping at his morning song. During those seconds Riven’s shoulders rose hopefully. Then Draco’s mind caught up to him.
The room erupted into catcalls and cheers. Ron looked worryingly green, but Draco was smirking and Hermione’s cheeks were flushed.
“If it makes you feel better, I haven’t been anywhere but the store and a few runs for three weeks.”
Draco doesn’t have any opinion on the matter, but that’s mostly because he’s never been able to believe it would actually happen. When they started seeing one another he never thought they would last— Harry would get bored, Harry would get to know him and realize he didn’t like what he saw, Harry would grow frustrated, Harry wouldn’t be able to deal with his idiosyncrasies, Harry, Harry Harry. There were so many insecurities, so many predictions. Draco remembers lying awake at night agonizing over them for weeks before he came to the final conclusion that it was all too much. Not Harry— never Harry— but the pointless worrying over where they were going, where they’d end up, how they figured into one another’s future— that was completely unnecessary and overall a pile of rubbish. There were too many possibilities. The only thing Draco could do was let them all go, the bad
A cab drove by, wet wheels pulling up from the pavement with a fine spray of water, and Harry sucked in a slow breath, savoring the crip scent of gasoline and smoke and soaked pavement. His hands and face were cold and his feet ached in his boots, but the cocktails Malfoy made him taste were still warm and sweet in his stomach, on his tongue. He smiled.
, and now he knows just what it feels like to have that mouth pressed against his own. He’s sure it will all turn sad and painful and embarrassing when one of them finally pulls away, but for now he’s just
Certainly not when he’d come so close—one misunderstanding away. Draco was worth more to him than that.
The man’s lips shift around into something resembling amusement, but Harry’s having trouble not staring at them, which in turn makes reading his expression difficult. “Are you going out to brave the masses?” He repeats.
“Fuck, yeah, ok.” Harry grinned. This felt like a moment from their school days, spontaneous and most likely disastrous. But he felt high on enthusiasm and hope, giddy with his feelings and more than ready to do something about them.
Draco didn’t let himself imagine the worst. Harry had left for long periods of time during his stay at the town (Draco refused to acknowledge the thoughts that whispered it had never been this long). Harry was a traveler, but this had become a makeshift home for him. Surely he would return. Even if he were leaving the town for good, he would say something. He’d have come to Draco, bid him goodbye, if only to argue one last bittersweet time.
Everything he wanted was hanging before his eyes. The threads were about to snap, or weave into something beautiful.
Harry wrinkled his nose at the obvious whiff of firewhiskey. He opened his mouth to beg Ron to show some self-control, to spare his dignity if nothing else, when Ron’s face split into a wicked grin.
“What?!” Draco finally yelped. “You— what in the forsaken name of mighty kings and stinking river trolls— you’ve come to do what exactly?!”
Well, perhaps if he did a good enough job of this, he might have some hope of redeeming himself in Draco’s eyes. An act of penance and all that.
“Goodbye” Draco managed before he turned away. He got a jerky wave as Harry walked off, his long cloak snapping quickly behind him. As he left, Draco couldn’t help feeling lonelier than he had before.
“Him.” It slips out without Draco’s permission, an instinctual request from deep in his heart. He presses his lips together, eyes fixed on the bushes in front of him. Pansy doesn’t reply. She knows he can’t take it back. It’s true.
She shook her head. “Oh, I wouldn’t. Peeves is wrecking havoc in there. If it’s just studying you’re doing, you could try the Eighth Year lounge? I know it’s empty this time of day.”
Harry grins at him sheepishly. He’s starting to feel giddy, which is a staggering turn from his previous irritation. Malfoy looks like he’s trying not to smile back. The lines of his lipstick give him away, and Harry again finds himself wanting to muss him up a little.
“Potter, you can’t be that thick,” Blaise said after a beat. When Harry just stared in confusion, he made a shooing motion at him. “Go after him!”
Harry really couldn’t, so he finally bent down and retrieved the pieces of his glasses, knitting them together with a quick
“I’m afraid I’ll mess it up,” Harry confessed. “I can’t even talk around him, Ron. I’d do it, but it’s hard enough worrying he’ll—that he doesn’t feel the same. Trying to manage myself while I’m at it—”
“I think you’re beautiful,” Riven looked awfully perplexed for a lunatic. It was a shame he really was quite handsome. “And I’m asking you to marry me. Have I been unintentionally unclear? I thought I was rather blunt.”
“I—no, not really.” Malfoy frowned, picking at a thread on Harry’s scarf. “There’s a lot of that around Soho lately. That’s all well and good for Pansy, but I’d rather men didn’t buy me drinks just to fuck me.” He hesitated just long enough for Harry to feel bad about buying Malfoy drinks while thinking something just along those thoughts. “Sometimes I’d rather they lend me clothes when it’s cold out.”
Harry’s fully intent on edging a bit closer, sliding his arm behind Draco, the whole deal, but then the show starts and his dignity goes out the window. Because he’s unfortunately just as much a dork as Draco, it would seem. So much for being suave.
“I hope I’m not asking too much, but would you be able to grab cat food if they have it? I just hate to keep going out to check but I’m running really low.”
They sat quietly for a moment, munching on their stolen goods. Ron finally swallowed his bite and brushed his hands off.
“Er, Hermione picked them.” Harry rubbed the back of his head awkwardly. He knew as much about shoes as he did about wines.
“No, that’s not necessary...” Lily said. “Perhaps you could help us find a magical piece? We’re looking for protection and healing charms.”
“Don’t you dare.” Harry’s grinning, he knows he is. He snatches a cookie from the top of the tower before becoming Draco in. “Make yourself at home.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. Pushed his glasses up his nose, then cleared his throat. Cleared it again for good measure, because something seemed to be lodged in it—it felt unnaturally tight.
Harry sunk into the slow discovery of the feeling of Draco against him: the weight of his body, the heat of him, the scent of his hair. It was light and almost floral, the sort of smell Harry would spend hours chasing in a drugstore shampoo aisle, and nothing like Ron’s obnoxious six-in-one. He unconsciously dipped his chin to touch his nose to the soft strands. Draco laughed against him.
That’s not entirely correct when one gets down to the facts. Draco Malfoy has blond hair— a light, airy blond, the color of sunlight on snow. Harry Potter knows this because he’s spent many an adolescent winter watching Malfoy walk the grounds of a frozen Hogwarts and noticing it. The fact that he’s observed Malfoy that carefully is neither here nor there, although Ron would say it’s
Harry almost choked on his laugh. “I think it’s so homeless people don’t sleep under the awning,” he said seriously after a moment. He watched the way Malfoy’s brows furrowed and his lips puckered into a frown.
Harry snorted. Draco huffed out a short laugh, then Harry chuckled, and in the way laughter often does, it soon overtook them both.
“I’ve only— I was just asking, just curious,” Harry tugged at a fraying string on the edge of his hood a bit, a nervous habit Draco had noticed some weeks before.
“Alright, I’d say yes!” Draco hid his face in his hands. “But I’m certainly not smitten and he’s not going to and daydreaming is fine because it’s not going anywhere!”
“Not one for one-night stands?” Harry wasn’t sure what made him say it. Maybe memories of how Seamus used to shove him unwillingly onto the dancefloor, claiming he needed to get laid.
“I...” He didn’t want to lie to his friend. “Not entirely, I didn’t.” There was silence. Draco pulled his knees up to his chest on the window seat, facing Riven but still unable to look at him.
Harry spent a little longer that morning fiddling with his hair, and trimmed his beard up tighter around his face. He wondered for the first time if Draco preferred clean-shaven partners. But Harry liked himself this way—he thought he looked older, and a little less like the photos the Prophet liked to circulate of him in his school years.
Draco watched bemused as the noble swung down from his horse with a practiced grace. He frowned as Riven came to stand at the foot of the steps to their door. Then he did something Draco would swear for several days he had dreamt up. He pulled a small bunch of yellow flowers from his cloak and held them up to the shocked blond.
That’s a no, then. Harry pushes himself up on one elbow so he can see Draco’s face. There’s a furrow between his fine brows, his cheek smushed against the pillow. It muffles his voice.
Unfortunately, Draco wasn’t wearing the apron today, but he did have goggles strapped on—large, glass things that mussed up his hair and made his eyes look owlish. Harry had to pause in the doorway to watch him work, too entranced by the way his cheeks flushed in the heat of his cauldron.
“So what, you decided I was a game to play?” Draco spat, pulling his hand back quickly. “The poor, neglected prince on his desperate quest for amusement?”
And they are, they’re so dazzlingly in love. So in love that Harry picks Draco’s dirty socks out of the laundry so they stay white and Draco lets him pee with the door open when their favorite shows are on (Ron may never understand the value of small things, but Draco does).
But Riven wasn’t. Riven who would bring him wildflowers and stop by for dinner. Riven was real, and Riven wanted him. Harder yet was to admit that he certainly wasn’t indifferent to Riven. Even if Harry were to be conjured up on his doorstep with uncharacteristic words of adoration, Draco felt dirt at the thought of that love, a love that was tainted by feelings for someone else.
There’s that reality Draco’s been waiting for. But it’s not exactly what he’d been expecting, because this rather sounds like Harry
They made it to the empty top in one piece, where Malfoy forced them to sit at the front— “to watch the lights, Potter.” Harry let Malfoy steal the window seat, even though the top shutter was open and the wind was wet, and collapsed happily into his own spot. The bus lurched forward again.
“Better.” Harry’s eyes narrowed as he leaned against the table. Draco suddenly wished he were standing.
There was no use bickering over it; they both knew it was true. While Blaise’s family owned the nearest bakery, Draco’s father was born a miner. At times Lucius Malfoy could be away for months, seeking out fire-caves and woods where crystals grew like lichen beneath gnarled trees. He would always return will packs full of gems, some simple ornaments and prisms, but most imbued with veins of raw magic. Draco’s mother crafted the rocks into fine jewelry. Her skills were unmatched in the region, or so Lucius liked to claim. The pieces she produced were coveted among wanderers and noblemen alike, and she guarded her craft with a vicious determination that Draco was appropriately wary of.
“I can’t expect you to,” Riven sighed. “I made a grave mistake, and we’re both a bit heartbroken for it. It’s only fair I explain to you.”
“There you are, darling,” Narcissa greeted him from the stove when he arrived in the kitchen. “You have a guest.” He caught her wink just as he took notice of the velvet-clad figure seated at their table.
He choked on his words at Harry took a step towards him. They’d already been standing close, but that last stride brought Harry’s face dangerously near his own. The warmth of his chest seeped into Draco despite the wind. Dying sunlight glinted off Harry’s glasses as he swallowed.
Ron poked him when he went a couple moments without replying. “Yes, of course!” Harry blurted. “Yeah, that’d be—that’d be fine, obviously. I’m free. The party’s great, right?”
The pain passes in waves, each lessening slightly until the relief stays and Draco can straighten up.
Although neither of them were artists in the slightest, an office was an excellent place to go about crafting a ball invitation. Together, they riffled through the desk drawers, pulling out stacks of stationary. Ron managed to unearth green ink, while Harry got lucky with a set of embellished cards, presumably blank thank-you notes.
They sit together for long minutes, listening to the music waft into the night. Pansy begins to fidget at some point, no doubt anxious to use the bathroom or to find a more cheerful dance partner. It makes Draco smile a little, even if his eyes are damp.
Riven visited again two days later, and once more a week after that. Soon, his presence became a familiar and regular occurrence in the Malfoy household. Draco would come home for dinner to find him at the table with Lucius— who was delighted and quite taken with the prince— or bump into him at the market. He’d even met Riven in the meadows on a memorable day where they had talked well into the night. The moments were colored bitter for Draco, however, who remembered all too well the one time he’d brought Harry here to prove a long-forgotten point.
Draco himself tried to forget the incident. He was busy for once the next couple of days so it was easy enough. He also had darker worries on his mind— worries that had disappeared, and therein lay his problem.
They both enjoyed the town but preferred the open air of the forests and meadows. They had a secret sweet tooth Narcissa was very familiar with, and a common disgust for the color pink (Riven was unfairly fond of red, however, the heathen). Draco’s favorite was green, which he went on to describe in embarrassing detail using phrases like “forest streams glimmering with sunlight” and “emerald moulded by ocean spray”. Riven had rolled his eyes to the monologue and simply said his favorite was silver-blue, like storm clouds.
, it’s his neighbor, the hot one across the hall whose name he’s never gotten because Harry’s mouth turns to cotton every time he sees him “—it goes. Yeah, er, just clumsy.”
Malfoy hums and runs a finger down the collar of Harry’s uniform. He wraps Harry’s tie around his fist.
“Lounge is no good today, mate.” Longbottom was covered in a suspicious brown sludge. “Ernie let off one of those portable swamps. I’m headed down to the greenhouses myself.”
They both speak at the same time. Malfoy blinks, startled. When he doesn’t finish his sentence, Harry tries again.
Draco blushes, dammit. He can’t help it. Harry tells him often enough, but he always says it with weight, like he means it, and Merlin if it doesn’t take Draco’s breath away.
“Yes. It should slow most common illnesses while also healing their damage and working to purge them. It’s been known to work against curse-based maladies.”
“For real?” Harry’s grinning. Why’s he grinning? “I played six hours of Animal Crossing yesterday! Have you got that?”
“And you are lovely for doing that,” Narcissa turned with two mugs, which she set on the table before pouring hot water. “So much more polite than our Draco.”
Not just glowing— lighting up. Faintly, like a soft pearlescent shimmer across the milky white, but still stark against the darkness of the carpet. Little whorls of light followed the path Harry’s hand had taken, spiraling in spotted patterns over Draco’s side, looping once around his navel and dipping teasingly under the edge of his shirt.
“Making out is putting it lightly,” Thomas held up a shockingly lacy champagne bra. “Hit me in the head as I ran. Risk it if you want.”
Draco was not replying. Harry couldn't blame him. When he sneaked a glance, the other Wizard’s cheeks were as flushed as his own.
Suddenly the game didn't seem quite so dull. Harry tucked his feet under himself where he sat on the couch.
“There’s coffee in the cafeteria!” Ron frowned. Harry and Hermione shared a look. The canteen coffee was notorious for containing every spent ground the world over. Ginny insisted it could peel paint.
,” Robards thundered from the safety of his chair, “I’d have you out on the street faster than you can say ‘larceny’!”
“I absolutely mind. It’s terrible. Cease immediately.” But Potter just stared for a second before snorting. Surprised, but feeling lighter than he had in months, Draco hesitantly cracked his own smile.
This way may be more permanent, though. Draco bites his cheek and breathes through his nose. He meets his own eyes in the still water and frowns at himself. Then smiles. He looks both beautiful and sad. It occurs to him that he’d make a lovely classical painting, something from the Italian Renaissance, perhaps. Draco revels in that narcissism because it’s all he has. If Potter can’t love him, he’ll certainly love himself.
Ron knocked his elbow out from under him, and before he could catch himself, Harry smacked his chin soundly on his desk.
It didn’t help that Harry liked to wander around dusk or sunset, the opportune moment for a romantic rendezvous and hidden kisses down dark alleys. He hadn’t seen Harry in almost a week, however, and it made him a bit anxious.
, and Harry wants him. The way he kisses Draco, the way he delves into Draco’s mouth, that’s for him. It’s on that edge between too much and far, far too little, and Draco’s overwhelmed and wanting, unable to get close enough.
At the moment, however, Narcissa was bedridden with fever, and Draco had been put in charge of their stall while Lucius took care of her. Even now she insisted she was fine, but one sneeze and her overzealous husband had her in his arms and promptly in bed. It was entertaining to watch, though painfully sappy in Draco’s opinion.
Draco stayed silent, his face turned away into his pillow, his hair glowing in the soft candlelight of their room, and Harry still couldn’t find the words he wanted. Quietly, as if the silence itself were preserving the moment, he slipped off his shoes and pulled back the covers. Draco stiffened as Harry slid in behind him and wrapped an arm around his waist, pulling them flush together. They’d lain like this countless times after nightmares, but now Harry’s heart was racing for an entirely different reason.
“Harry,” he said, “I’ve got to tell you something. It should probably wait until after work, but you’ll hear about it any minute anyway.”
Harry doesn’t seem to agree with the scary part, though. He smiles at Draco’s comments often enough that Draco’s actually starting to believe he’s somewhat funny. There’s not a lot of room for conversation with the TV on, but where Draco usually watches expressionlessly, Harry’s face is completely uncontrolled and the only way he can describe it is beautiful. Cliché, but what can one do? Draco’s hooked, watching every reaction, clinging to the way Harry bites his lip and his forehead crinkles in concern every time someone on screen is in danger. Draco has completely stopped watching for the last ten minutes, so he wouldn’t know who’s fighting now.
Harry conjured a ribbon to tie up the last few, setting them gently in a free space amidst the chaos of Draco’s desk. Unwilling to take any chances, he spelled his own name on the silk.
“Granger, that’s fascinating,” Draco sneered. Harry winced. “Really bloody genius, in fact. I’m ever so grateful you shared that tidbit information with us. Now if you’d be so kind, leave my soulmark to me.” He spat the last part out as he untangled himself from his blanket and stood. “I’m going to bed. This game is childish.”
Perhaps he’d grown a bit in that regard—he did know what he wanted now. But getting it remained a mystery.
“I want to forgive you,” Draco said slowly. “But I couldn’t even say what I’m angry about. I have more questions than you’re probably able to answer.”
. You don’t— forgive me, Highness, but you don’t even know me, much less love me. We’ve met only once. You can’t just ask me to marry you.”
“It wouldn’t— it doesn’t have to be just for that,” Draco mumbled quietly. “I want— even if you weren’t sick, I would want to... I’d want you.” He swallowed and looked up to meet Harry’s widened eyes. “I want you.”
That’s certainly out of the question. Potter would suspect something, if he hasn’t already noticed Draco leave. “No.”
“Oh, no need.” She winked again. Harry wondered vaguely if she had something in her eye. “I have just the thing.”
“Let’s get that posted, then, before something else goes wrong. I think I saw Malfoy’s cloak in the break room.”
“He’s consulting,” Ron explains slowly, “for the Finley case?” Then, when Harry only stares back blankly— “Harry. Can you even read?”
Draco’s office was at the other end of Auror Headquarters in the Consultancy Department. There was a neat little lab attached to it, expanded and sustained with charms so as to hold a host of rare ingredients. It reminded Harry of a kitchen—wood counters and painted cabinets, with jars upon jars of herbs stacked on every surface. If he weren’t so sure of Draco’s skill as a potioneer, he’d be worried about cross-contamination.
“Ask. I’ll answer anything.” That warmed Draco's heart— the dedication in Harry's voice was unfaltering.
“Good, that’s good.” Potter drums his fingers on the railing. Draco thinks he imagines the way he leans closer. “I wanted to talk to you, actually. I’m really glad I found you out here. It’s quite the maze.”
“Potter?” Draco said. He had a set of books clutched against his chest, but his arms grew slack as he took in the state of the room, and a thinner volume slipped out. “What—what is–what have you…”
Draco chose that moment to walk through the cubicles on his way to his lab. He had his overly fancy coffee clutched in one hand, and his hair was falling in his eyes the way it always did when it was damp out. He looked pointedly at his shoes as he walked past them.
“The necklace was for you?” Draco sat up straight. “What do you mean, it limits your life?! Harry, there’s a cure right? There must be a cure, it’s only magic—“
“Are you going to tell me what’s in that fancy file or do I have to read it?” Harry finally asks, jerking his chin towards the papers tucked under Malfoy’s arm. He sincerely hopes Malfoy will volunteer to summarize for him. It’s because Harry’s glasses are giving him a headache and not at all because he likes the sound of Malfoy’s voice.
“Yes, of course!” Draco flings himself half on top of him as Harry’s arms come up around him. They’re squeezing each other tight enough that Draco can hardly breathe, but he only pulls Harry closer. Draco kisses his hair, his temple, his wet cheek, and eventually finds his mouth. He presses his lips to Harry’s more desperately than he thinks he’s ever kissed him before. They don’t even taste one another, kissing close mouthed as they kneel together on the pathway, too happy and overwhelmed for anything else. Yet it burns Draco down to his core, leaves him breathless and laughing.
“Hello.” Draco sent him a weak smile from where he was sitting on the window seat. “Isn’t it bad luck for the grooms to see one another before the wedding?”
Draco watched helplessly as Potter drew his wand, and with a practised wave conjured up a cupcake. On top was a single burning candle, flickering in the breeze.
“Well,” Ron said, “I might not be George, but I’m definitely familiar with the benefits of a nice, empty elevator. And Malfoy’s headed out right now.”
Ron, the bastard, shrugs. Shrugs! Like a pink-haired Malfoy is not only a normal occurrence, but is even expected.
“Malfoy,” Harry repeats to himself quietly, just to feel the familiar shape in his mouth. It’s lacking the venom and suspicion it should have on principle.
Most people would think the Astronomy Tower anything but calming, and their idea of a bad day had never included Unforgivables. Draco, however, found an unsettling peace sitting in the same spot where he’d stood two years prior. It was cathartic. There was a sense of forgiveness to it— a wild and vulgar rejection of peoples’ expectations. He would come up here sometimes when the skies were clear and just lay beneath the stars, breathing cold air until his head felt clear again and his ears hurt. Today it would work well enough for studying.
He does take some childish pleasure in flipping two fingers towards the bed. Draco sneezes again for his troubles. With a final muttered oath, Harry snatches up the duvet and goes to spend the night on the couch.
The gardens are lit by floating fairies. It makes a pretty picture, the flowers and trees glowing with spots of pink and green and blue. They laugh at him from the shrubbery, and Draco partially agrees with them. He certainly is a spectacle—in love with his ex-nemesis, bonded to a wizard who’s probably snogging another woman right about now. The thought itself doesn’t anger the bond-magic, but that barely makes a difference, the pain in his chest is so strong.
“And you’re taking them remarkably well,” Draco said. He shifted a bit and Harry felt the cold point of his nose on his neck just above his collar. “I suppose dinner would be an acceptable place to start.”
And there it was. Harry. At the center of his dreams, his heart, his mind. Harry was gone, but in leaving he’d taken more of Draco with him and left more of himself behind than should have been possible. But he was gone now. Draco had every right to— needed to, in fact— move on. He wanted this. He wanted to move on. More and more often Riven was the first thought on his mind and not the second.
“Harry doesn’t want in his pants,” Hermione said. Harry felt the table shift as she placed the serving bowl in the center, and then her hand ruffled his hair lightly.
But Harry looks absolutely thrilled. He’s grinning and bouncing on the tips of his toes now. “Is that the new Star Wars one? I haven’t seen it yet, is it any good? Where can you watch it?”
Draco was left floundering over the fact that he’d just been called mate by none other than Longbottom. That is, until the words sank in and he gritted his teeth in irritation. Was nothing sacred?
The potion was still simmering, only there was something angry about the bubbles now. Something smoky. Something—
“Oh, hey Malfoy!” Potter called out. Draco was still tempted to run, but quickly gave up on the idea as Potter stood up and dusted his trousers off. “You took your time.”
He makes it four blocks before he realizes he hasn’t locked his door, there’s no bus needed, and the turn to Sainsbury’s was two blocks back.
It was only when Draco got home and looked in the mirror that it occurred to him Riven had described the grey of his own eyes, and it was only when Draco felt the first tear hit his cheek that he realized he had been describing Harry’s.
But then Harry sucks in a short breath, and his lips part, and he’s kissing Draco back. Warm hands come up to cup Draco’s cheeks and
Draco practically melted against him as he was pulled into another kiss, this one gentle and slow. Harry barely moved, the both of them just reveling in the sensation.
“Jesus fucking Christ, Potter!” And Harry’s too surprised at Malfoy’s use of Muggle jargon to dodge the magazine he smacks him over the head with. “I’m asking you out, you daft wanker!”
Riven stood and crossed the room to the armoire, flipping the doors open and pulling a fur cloak out. He swept it around his shoulders and pulled up the hood before coming to stand in front of Draco again. Draco watched with growing confusion as Riven lifted some of the fur to cover his face, the dark hair taking the place of a short beard and the shadows of the hood warping his eyes into familiar shapes. The green flashed at him even in the relative dark.
They pause at episode four to order Indian, then promptly remember that everything is closed and have to settle for instant ramen. The wine is gone by then so Harry pours them both pineapple juice. Draco’s pretty sure that if this were a date—
Harry wondered if perhaps Draco was coming in tomorrow as well, and didn’t want to lose his place in whatever investigation he was heading.
“What?” Ron said quickly. “No! Fuck, no, Harry, this one’s on me, honest it is. Look, I promise, it’s not you—here! Read this.”
. I feel like I’m living in your wet dream.” Ron shivered in apparent disgust. “That’s not funny, Harry. It’s a fucking unpleasant place to be! You wrote with the wrong end of a quill for
“It’s the definition of my business!” Harry says vehemently. “You— you printed magishopped photos of us sucking face!” That’s really the only way to put it— there absolutely was tongue (Harry’s still not sure whose).
“Of course he does. Draco’s a dramatic prat, and you know it,” Pansy said firmly. “He’s probably as much of a nervous ninny about this as you are right now. No, Potter, your hands are shaking— don't hide them under the cushions, I can bloody well see them. Now get up.”
It wasn’t unheard of for King James and his wife to ride through the Hollow. Their castle was only a few miles to the east and their frequent presence in the city had absolved them of most of their infamy. Their son Riven, however, was more myth than celebrity. The prince was said to never leave the castle during the day, and was rarely seen by servants outside of his rooms.
“We’re going to be so sappy,” he finally declared after pulling back. “I’m going to cuddle you in the common room, and hold your hand in the halls, and take you out and snog you wherever and whenever we choose and if anyone—”
When Draco rounded the top of the stairs, however, his lungs burning lightly from the climb, he almost turned right around and left the way he’d come. Sitting on the open edge of the tower, legs hanging over the drop and tangled hair blowing in the breeze, was—
“You look a tad chilled,” she said. Harry would have argued that that was the understatement of the century, but he was too freezing to be arsed. “What can I get you?”
Draco’s been ready to kill to get oranges. Harry’s so close, the warmth of him seeping into Draco’s side, his lips smooth and full and talking about oranges. No one wants to talk to him about Animal Crossing, no one, and Harry’s sitting there with dimples and glasses and
“Your half birthday,” Potter repeated. “I figured you didn’t get much of a real birthday this year, so I thought maybe this would do. I’m sorry it’s six months late, but Hermione got wind of our hunt for Time Turners so this was the next best option.”
“Making out,” he repeated dumbly at Dean Thomas. “You’re not letting me in because the Weaslette is making out with Lovegood.”
“I’d feel bad,” Harry shakes his head. “It’d be weird if you weren’t watching it too, you know? I’d hate to mooch off you like that.”
“Oh, no problem,” Harry says quickly before he can even consider where he’s supposed to get cat food. “Is there a particular brand or anything…?”
The rush of his successful sale lasted Draco through that day and over into the next. He was still unpleasantly shaken, not to mention overwhelmed by the money. His parents had been so excited— Lucius— and proud— Narcissa— that his father had picked his mother up and swung her a full turn before pulling them both into a hug. However, even with the new earnings, Draco felt the stirrings of curiosity. What good was a healing gem to a queen with access to the most sophisticated medicines in the land?
Harry’s cheeks grew hot. He bit his lip to curb his smile, too caught in Malfoy’s implications to think of a witty reply.
The Eighth Years were gathered in the Common Room for their weekly round of Muggles party games— renamed from the Peace-building Inter-house Socializing Socials. The event was organized mostly by Hermione (ergo the acronym) and a surprisingly willing Neville, but the other students had quickly caught on to the idea.
“I’m not familiar with your standards, Potter,” Draco sniffed. “The floors don’t matter much, but I’d rather my workspace be clean. Obviously now I won’t have to worry.”
“I’m Draco. Would you like to continue your order, Harry? Because I’m afraid there’s a slight problem with your request.”
Indeed they were, the pinstriped denim growing dark near the hems, but Harry barely glanced at them, too focused on Malfoy’s face.
Harry still doubted Ron would really risk their partnership over something so petty, but he’d seen him do some truly questionable things in their three years on the Auror force, and he had no interest in having to work with a rookie for the foreseeable future.
. Still, Draco hadn’t given him any outright rejections. Every screwup seemed to stem from circumstances and Harry’s own inability to think with Draco in the room—there was no indication that Draco was averse to (or even aware of) his efforts.
Harry hugged him tighter, wondering at the great ‘if’ that his own life had become since the war. “It doesn’t really work like that, you know.”
“Five minutes,” he pleaded. Harry coughed guiltily. “Five bloody minutes of peace. I’m begging you, mate.”
“I can think of a few items on our menu,” Draco murmured against his lips. “Maybe some Darjeeling? Or that abominable chocolate you're so fond of?”
“Alright,” Draco said hesitantly. Granger gave him a toothy smile and continued on her way, the tower of books swaying precariously.
At that moment Harry wonders if he’s been hit by a particularly strong Confundus. He frowns and leans on the desk to leaf through the magazine, but— no, the article is definitely still there in all of its sleazy glory. He looks up at Malfoy. Looks down at the article. Shoves it across the desk.
“You’re lucky I came,” she said, already starting to help Blaise with the display cases of rings. “I got held up at home, and the crowds were hectic, that’s all. You should go check on your mother.”
, judging by the smell. Every shelf, hinge, and tile was coated in the drying blue potion. It stuck in clumps to the ceiling and had pooled across the floor. Harry couldn’t even recognize the color of the walls.
His arms were full of assorted materials to make the next circlet he was planning, and he’d just stepped out the door of their house when the sound of clicking hooves had his eyes darting up. A grey horse was pawing the cobblestones of the street, its rider dressed in equally dark colors. The breeze chose that moment to play with the cape at his back, betraying the fine make of the fabric.
Draco had gotten a wand, his mother, and his life for his birthday that year. He hadn’t dared to bring it up. His father’s trial had been the next day. He’d whispered happy birthday to himself at midnight and that had been that.
“I found him quite pleasing,” he sneered. “Certainly more so than a vagabond like you. In fact, now that I think back on it I’d say he was quite easily the most handsome man for fifty miles.”
The night before their wedding, there was a heavy knock on Draco's door. Riven stepped in after a moment of silence.
“He seems to like me,” Harry comments. Draco almost asks who before he looks down and sees that Pea has his claws stuck in Harry’s shirt. Draco moves to peel his paws off with a sigh and a muttered apology that dies quite quickly. He can feel the heat of Harry’s damp skin through his shirt this way, feel the hard plains of his chest against his knuckles. Their arms brush and press as Harry finally hands the cat back to him, and at that point Draco knows his face is flaming.
He’s acting entirely serious, and Harry has to take a deep breath to keep from ripping something—namely, the paper staring up at him.
the Slytherins, perish the thought. The two nights Draco was sick in the infirmary during November had been the longest since camping with Hermione and Ron. He ended up sneaking out under his cloak to visit him, and the solid tongue lashing Draco gave him for risking getting in trouble had been worth it when he saw the delight in his eyes.
Draco felt his cheeks heating up, and he glanced away. There was a beat of silence during which neither moved.
“I think,” Draco muttered as he pushed himself quickly off of Harry’s chest, face flaming, “that we’d better just organize a meeting on Monday, Potter.”
The ingredients were kept isolated and meticulously sorted, however, and Draco himself kept clean by way of a self-scourgifying apron, glimpses of which sustained Harry for months at a time. He had dreams about pulling Draco in by the pockets on the front, tucking his steam-damp hair behind his ears and kissing his nose.
“Happy Holidays, Weasley, Savage,” he said. “And Po—Harry.” The slightest hint of color appeared on Draco’s cheeks. Harry wondered if he might have been drinking too.
Nobody tried to stop him as he swept up the stairs to the dormitories, but knowing eyes all turned on Harry once a door slammed shut above them.
When they broke apart, Draco’s knees were weak. Harry’s eyes were blown wide, only a thin sliver of that deep green ringing his dark pupils. His lips were wet and his cheeks flushed, and Draco barely had time to feel embarrassed by his own appearance.
“Oh, that’s a nasty one.” She grinned at them both. “What are we making fun of Draco for this time, then?”
“Well, ah, excuse me, Potter,” Draco muttered a bit awkwardly. “This is me. I’ll just—” he sidestepped out of the lift, and Harry didn’t even have the shameful pleasure of watching him walk away, because the doors clanged decidedly shut after him.
“That’s sweet and a completely appropriate hobby, I’ll have you know,” Draco says. Harry just snorts and takes Pea back. “I’ve been playing games, but that’s not much to talk about.” He’s never mentioning his Switch in public again. Theo already figuratively crucified him for calling Zelda ‘peak gaming.’ Granted, he should have been more careful with the praise.
, Harry thinks. He lunges towards the door as if that will somehow delete the message, then he stops to stare at it on his phone for a moment. He’s overreacting.
At the moment, Draco is opening his door after getting his mail downstairs, so he doesn’t think to glance behind him until a cheerful voice calls—
Harry thought then that he may very well have preferred to be eaten by the lift. He didn’t dare touch his cheeks, but he knew they were flaming. He only hoped his beard covered the worst of his embarrassment.
“Hello,” Draco answered, earning a pointed look from Narcissa. “Your Highness.” His mother tisked at his tone, as if she wasn’t the one to invite the crown prince into their kitchen.
“Don’t stop what?” Draco had just popped through the portrait hole, and he came over to flop down on the carpet next to Harry.
Riven didn’t kiss him, just leaned their foreheads together and murmured sweet nothings and ardent promises. Draco tried to return them.
He didn’t see Harry the next week either. Or the day following that. Draco distracted himself with household tasks, and when that proved ineffective he took to denial like a fish to water.
He couldn't recall the walk up the stairs and down the corridor. All too fast his hand was on the smooth wood of the door to his and Draco’s room, and then he was pushing it shut behind him as he stepped quietly up to Draco’s bed. The drapes were closed tight and Harry knew he’d find Draco pretending to be asleep before he even pulled them open.
He stared at the swirling knots on the floor, tracing their patterns until they merged into an otherworldly picture of something wrongly familiar. His fingers were skimming the edge of his blanket, back and forth over and over. They stopped at a frayed thread and tugged. Draco snapped it off viciously and turned to face the wall.
“Will do, sir,” Harry said. He’d long since learned that Robards rarely meant half the things he said, including favorites like ‘you’re fired’ and ‘pray a Death Eater finds you before I do’. When there were no more insults forthcoming, he quickly made for the door, shutting it just in time to hear the thud of a paperweight against the wood.
He can at least say that the chances of seeing Harry have upped his personal hygiene considerably. Contrary to what he’s led Pansy to believe, he has indeed been wearing his pajamas almost exclusively for two weeks. Definitely not the elegant apocalyptic outfit he’d always planned, but needs must.
Harry sputtered. “Well, don’t you have anything to say about it? A book to follow? Some brilliant explanation for why I keep cocking up the simplest shite on earth?”
Harry shivered as he stepped into the familiar cafe, shaking out his wet umbrella and leaning it by the door. It was raining again. He wondered vaguely how there was any moisture left in the clouds circling London. Surely there was a desert somewhere in need of their endless deluge.
“Wish Harry hadn’t broken the curse on the position,” Ron grumbled. “Now we’ve got to kick the old fart out ourselves.”
Come Monday morning, however, Harry was a mess of nerves. He could hardly eat breakfast, unable to focus on anything but the thought of the letter he’d foolishly left in Draco’s cloak pocket. What if it had fallen out? Worse, what if he had
“Yes,” Draco hummed. “You wanted the hottest thing in here, and I can’t very well give you yourself.”
“—as consort king, yes. And as my lover. I’m certain you could grow to share my passion if only you allowed me to prove myself to you.”
“No,” Draco replies. He’s trying not to look at Potter, but looking up at the chandeliers hurts his tired eyes, looking down at the floor makes him feel small, and looking away is impossible. He’s stuck watching Potter’s hands on Weasley’s waist. She’s wearing a garish pink number, and the poor cut of the skirt means she steps on it more often than the floor. Draco takes a certain pleasure in hating everything about her, from her name down to her very shoes. He’s not allowed to hate
Harry kissed him. They were supposed to be past this by now, but every time he touched Draco he felt as untethered as the first time they kissed. Harry threaded his hands through Draco’s hair, and even the familiar sigh that slipped out between them felt new and exciting, his breath coming faster as the kiss deepened.
Harry considered it for a moment, slowly nodding his head. “I—actually, that’s a pretty great idea.” He started to grin. “Ron, that’s brilliant, really.” Draco did love that sort of thing—the dress robes, the gold-leaf invitations. Which raised another worry.
A month passed again. By now it had been almost four months since that first autumn festival. Winter covered Godric's Hollow in thick snow. Mistletoe and holly were strung along the streets and stalls of hot wine had popped up. The atmosphere was warm even though the weather was icy.
“Have you thought at all about what I said last time I saw you?” Riven said softly. “The offer stands, if you’ll have me.”
know by now?” Harry asked, resigned. He supposed that’s what he got for approaching Draco so often these past few weeks, but he’d hoped things were still in the vague rumor stage.
The turmoil distracted him until Riven’s next visit, which unfortunately happened while his mother was home. He’d been moping in bed when he heard her call him down, and diligently stood with a groan before throwing on a knitted jumper and stomping down the stairs.
“Alright, well, I’ve read a bit about it, and soulmarks having to match is a myth. There are several documented cases of non-matching soulmarks where the magical cores of the people involved were still joined in a clear bond.”
His eyes blinked open. The smoke twisted in pale ribbons for a few moments before the glowing ember at the tip of the wick snuffed out and they were left with wax making sneaky headway towards the icing.
“You’d think I was your pet pig, not your son.” He’d meant to mutter it, but by the amused twitch of Riven’s lips perhaps he hadn’t been quite subtle enough,
He’d known Potter would be here. It’s one of the reasons Draco hasn’t left his house since that night: Potter is everywhere, inside and out. Draco knows Pansy feels bad for making him come tonight, but he wouldn’t have let her go alone anyway, not with how heavy she’s getting. That’s his only spark of joy at the moment—he can’t imagine a child more lovely than Blaise and Pansy’s.
Well. That certainly puts Malfoy’s precious little table in danger. Harry’s enjoyed several delightfully press-free years, courtesy of his acquaintanceship with both Parkinson and several esteemed attorneys. Malfoy having the sheer gall to ruin his hard-won peace makes him public enemy number one in Harry’s opinion.
“Dagnabbit, he’s taken my currants, the filthy cur! May he be cursed until his dyin’… breath,” Draco sighs the last word like it takes a monumental effort, and it would sound a lot more threatening if he didn’t spit it in an American Southern drawl. As it is, Harry nearly bites through his lip trying not to laugh.
“Alright that’s enough!” Draco cut them both off with a venomous glare. “I don’t sound like that. And you’re late, Pans.”
,” Harry continued over him with a wide grin, “says shite about it they can shove it straight up their arse, because I did not defeat the Darkest wizard of the age just to have Hogwarts’ finest tell me ‘no’.”
Pansy lit up at the mention of nobility. “Oh, Queenie saw her the day before last! Her guards were dreamy. Though they must get terribly lonely standing about all day.”
Down the table, Pansy was chattering to Theo— and subsequently the rest of the Hall— about the perfume her parents had sent her for her birthday last week, and how it wasn’t the one she’d
“Ask and you shall receive,” Pansy said. “The most public would have been Slughorn’s desk during lunch.”
That was not a passing fancy. Not an innocent sort of infatuation. Harry didn’t dare entertain the thought of grand things like love, but neither was he going to give up something so overwhelming, so all-consuming.
“Right.” Harry’s not going to ask where Draco got the accent from. He looks around the room, but he’s not wearing his glasses and it’s still woefully dark. Draco sounds like he’s getting impatient however, mumbling quiet currant-related death threats, and Harry’d rather his lover not dream about making him into a pie.
It’s far too early for a Monday morning (nearing noon), and while their coworkers have been diligently ridding the Wizarding World of crime, Harry and Ron are tossing Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans into each other's mouths and gossiping over Lavender Brown’s pregnancy cravings. They were, that is, until Harry caught sight of Malfoy's pink hair.
“They’re lovely,” Draco said, and Harry thought he might have turned redder. “Did you have them fitted? Most Wizarding stores insist.”
“Is that what we’re calling it?” Ron leaned back and crossed his arms, entirely unimpressed. “Oh, Merlin, seems I’ve caught a horrid chill. Wish Hermione would come strap me down and eat my—”
“Oh, well, I suppose we’ll have to brave your lunatic of a father and come visit here instead.” Draco laughs. Lucius has been a nightmare, swinging on a weekly basis between trying to hex or poison Harry and trying to befriend him (of all things). Draco isn’t sure which phase is more amusing. Seeing his father force a cigar on Harry while wearing a muggle nightdress under the impression it was a highly fashionable robe is a memory he will forever cherish.
“Thank you,” he managed. He couldn’t even offer them the box before they had turned away, the necklace still hanging from Riven’s hand.
Ron found him sulking this way half an hour later. He stopped at the edge of their desk, eyed Harry’s forlorn gaze (and its unsuspecting target), and sat on the edge of his chair very hesitantly. Harry thought he looked a bit like a hare about to bolt.
. He felt like a focal point, nearly imaginary, unfit to be standing in such a mundane place. And the fact that he looked this way to Harry, despite his every imperfection, for once made him begin to worry about his feelings. Nothing felt casual about wanting to give someone the world.
The tinsel (for that was what it was) came away from the wall, showering them all with charmed baubles. Harry fell squarely into the tree, Draco landing on top of him, and Ron fell to his knees, shaking with near-silent laughter. Savage was cackling as she leaned against the proper wall beside them. Harry cursed her for her good aim.
Malfoy jumps to his feet, and Harry congratulates himself on finally getting a reaction out of him. “I’ll thank you not to call my business a rag,” he snaps. “And I shan’t take anything out. It’s none of your business what I print anyways.”
Harry hesitated. “You think so?” he said carefully. An owl seemed almost too easy—cheating, in a sense. The thought of avoiding Draco like that rubbed him the wrong way.
“It’s not that,” Draco answered too quickly. He could see Riven’s hands twitch. He hadn’t outright denied it.
And Harry would have retorted, would have asked them both what exactly was so catastrophic about that particular section of Draco’s shirt, but just then he looked down. Down to where his fingers had been drawing idle patterns on Draco’s stomach, and Draco’s skin was glowing.
Draco didn’t seem surprised by the question, just disappointed it had finally been asked. His brows tilted up and his mouth pressed tight, and Harry had never wanted to hold him close more than in that moment.
Harry didn’t know what to say. Draco’s eyes were wide as he himself struggled to put together a sentence, no doubt as shocked as Harry, if for slightly different reasons.
The singing stops abruptly. “Harry Potter!” Draco announces. Harry winces, thinking he’s finally woken him, but no— “A thief!”
“Here,” Harry said on instinct, unwinding his own scarf from around his neck. “A real above-average act for you. Some knight-in-shining-armor stuff right here.”
They rode together for several quiet moments, before Draco spared a glance for his offending footwear.
The string on Harry’s hood snapped with a sharp pop. Draco desperately waited for the customary retort but one wasn’t forthcoming.
“Oh,” Hot Neighbor says helpfully. It’s the first time Harry’s heard him speak, and his accent is just as refined and gorgeous as the rest of him. From the way he’s leaning out of his door, Harry can only see his top half, but he’s wearing the softest looking sky-blue jumper and his eyes are absolutely striking in it. Hot Neighbor’s mouth is quirked in a confused sort of twist. It’s only then Harry realizes he’s said something else.
Unfortunately, the area behind him happened to be one of those places just large enough for a Christmas tree. Harry felt its needles prickle his back a second before he lost his balance and sank into its branches with a panicked cry.
Queen Lily had other ideas. “You’re too kind. But we cannot accept this. Will one hundred silvers be enough?”
“To be fair,” Ron started, and Harry could practically hear the look Hermione threw him. “Just to be fair, if he’s aiming to get into Malfoy’s pants, that might not have been the worst thing he could have said.”
“Harry,” Draco’s return smile was as blinding as it was the first day they met. He twisted up to brush his lips against Harry’s in a brief hello. “How is it out there?”
“Is there another prince squandered away that I don’t know about?” Draco said. He was feeling thrown in the familiar way he always did around Harry. His hands were sweating enough to dampen his polishing cloth.
“I’ll wait,” Harry said quickly. Draco smiled again. He seemed to deliberate for a moment before leaning over the counter and pressing a quick kiss to Harry’s cold cheek. It was over so fast he barely had time to process the feeling of warm lips on his frozen skin, but the spot burned long after Draco retreated.
. Certainly not the casual indifference Draco greeted every coworker with each morning. Even a rejection would have been better.
Riven hadn’t visited for a week, but he was meant to come by that night, and Draco couldn’t wait. His friend had been uncharacteristically quiet recently, and he’d acted strangely on their last meeting, avoiding many of Draco’s questions and trailing off mid-sentence. Draco had caught him stumbling after getting off his horse, and he refused long walks out across the meadows now. Something was amiss and Draco was worried, but for now he wasn’t sure how his nagging might be received.
“Look, I’ll get some from my flat, give me two seconds,” Draco offers. “And I promise you’ll like it.”
“I didn’t notice it at first, to be honest,” he says, and Harry throws him a look of such vicious resentment that the potted Dragon Snap in the corner stops smoking and curls its leaves over its head. Ron just gives him a shit-eating grin in return.
“But... I do care for you.” Now Riven sounded confused. “I can see you are honest, passionate, hardworking, and talented. Why can’t I ask you to join me in rulership?”
And therein lay the only problem— Draco Malfoy, as usual. Harry had enough on his mind without the unavoidable realization of his bisexuality. Or perhaps his homosexuality. His Malfoy-sexuality, Seamus even once offered. He’d liked Ginny, loved her even, but the warmth he’d felt snogging her didn’t compare to the heat that pooled in his groin every time Draco stepped out of the shower with his hair damp and clinging to his forehead and a towel slung low around his hips. Ron had once grudgingly admitted that Draco was fit. Ron was wrong. Draco was bloody gorgeous.
Harry didn’t bother reminding him that he was, in fact, twenty-four, and several inches taller than Robards himself. He just stared at the far wall and tried to think of lovely things, like what Draco’s jumpers might feel like and whether or not he liked watching the stars at night.
Riven spoke so quietly that Draco barely heard him over his own ragged breathing. “I thought you didn’t care.”
Harry startles. Draco’s brought glasses and a wine opener for them, and he sets both on the table before sitting primly on the couch.
“Harry’s hot for your hair,” Ron says. Harry chokes. “He’s also not read the case file, so I’ll leave you two to it. Don’t come looking for me, I’ll be taking an extended lunch. Looking forward to working with you.”
Harry’s too shocked to say much of anything then, and Malfoy takes the opportunity to hit him again.
“Just in terms of the general idea. Surely someone must have caught your eye at some point. Have you ever considered it?”
The royals glanced around briefly, ignoring the stares of interested townspeople, before walking towards their stall with a purpose. Draco remembered his manners when Pansy elbowed him, and quickly followed her in bowing. He didn’t dare look up, but he could see silk skirts and polished black boots moving closer. They stopped.
“That’s phoenix sapphire,” he answered. “The gems are inlayed into the chain to always touch the skin. It’s named for the traits of a phoenix— healing, rejuvenation, protection from harm, purity, so on and so forth.”
They wisely decide to shut up. There’s a used staple on the corner of Harry’s desk, and he reaches over to fiddle with it just for something to do.
“Be that as it may, I won't see it hurt you in the meantime.” Riven studied him carefully. Something in Draco's expression must have been too telling, because he blanched momentarily, before his face closed off. “Is this... if this is about the wedding, if you are having second thoughts—“
“Who’re we talking about? Malfoy?” Savage asked as she wandered up behind them. Harry tried not to jump. She was small, but quiet and built like a brick shithouse. She also had the unpleasant habit of slapping coworkers on the back hard enough to crack a rib. He unconsciously shifted to face her.
Draco spent two of the three days locked in his room. He let no one but his mother in, and that was rare enough. She hadn’t pried, but he called her in anyway and quietly told her what had happened, and finally, finally let the weight that Harry had become slip off his chest and onto some else’s. He’d cried a fair bit, most of it on her shoulder or into his pillow. Afterwards he still hurt but not as sharply. It helped when she shushed him and held him close, whispered encouraging words and explained that the first love was always the hardest. The first love, because that’s what Harry was.
If Draco had at least recognized Harry’s feelings, perhaps he wouldn’t be so hung up on his failure. This limbo between rejection and resolution, however, was unbearable. Harry cursed himself for his carelessness. The bitter despair at having unknowingly driven Draco into someone else’s arms was heavy in his mouth.
When he made it to his desk, however, the first thing he noticed was the look on Ron’s face. Harry had never seen him express more than one emphatic emotion at a time. But today his frown was dejected, guilty, and sympathetic all at once.
She sits beside him wordlessly, still holding his hand, and Draco holds on, riding the ache that grows in his chest until his breath comes short. It’s only partly physical. He knows the magic  and the damage are real, but somehow it’s the bone-deep sadness that’s worse. Pansy rubs a hand over his back and grips his fingers tighter, and Draco is so grateful for her that he can hardly speak.
“I thought you’d appreciate the effort. The public reaction is over and done with.” There’s a bit of smugness mixed in with everything else on his face, but there’s always a bit of smugness when it comes to Draco Malfoy. “See? I was
“Then there was the festival, and my mother contacted me and dragged me out to find that stupid necklace, and I met you again under a new name. I knew I had to return home soon; you weren’t showing any signs of interest in me that I could see, and you’d already met me as the prince.” He paused as if to center himself.
“The only thing that would hurt me is seeing you in pain,” Riven said quietly. “Tell me what’s wrong.”
“That’s why they call it overtime,” Draco said slowly. His voice had gone a bit hoarse, both of them pointedly avoiding the elephant—or roses, as it were—in the room.
A new gust of wind blew in through the open window, and Draco wrapped his hands in Harry’s scarf again.
“Harry,” Ron said seriously. He shifted his chair so he was breaking Harry’s line of sight, and clasped his hands in a businesslike manner. “I’m going to say this once, as your friend and your partner. Ask him out, or, by Godric, I’ll file for a reassignment.”
“Um,” Draco hefts Pea up a little higher as he thinks. “There’s the Mandalorian? You’ve probably seen it though.” Christ, Draco, way to go. From the looks of Harry he’d probably never even seen Star Wars. Not to mention everyone on the planet has already seen the Mandalorian.
