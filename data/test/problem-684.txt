Hadrian and the others had finished training for the day. After what happened with his mother, they resumed for a little while and ended it early. He decided to go see him and make sure he was ok after today’s incident. Hadrian went into his mother’s room and saw that he wasn’t the happiest. “I wonder what happened here?” he thought. Hadrian walked towards the bed, trying to see if his mother was willing to talk. When he turned toward his son, it startled him. “Hadrian? What are you doing here?” Hadrian smiled at his mother and gave him a hug. “I wanted to check on you. When you fainted, it worried me so much. I am glad to see that you are ok now.” Severus smiled at his son, grateful that he was a thoughtful and caring young man. “Are you feeling better?” Hadrian asked as he sat on the edge of the bed. “A little. Narcissa came and gave me a check-up. It was annoying. She started to act all high and mighty, like she was above me and everyone else,” he fumed. Hadrian put his arm around his mother and comforted him. “Mother, you need to calm down. Mrs. Malfoy was just trying to help you.” He crawled over to where his mother was laying down and sat down crossed-legged. “You don’t understand, Hadrian. No one mocks the Riddle family. We are supposed to be strong and proud. And everyone who thinks otherwise should be put back in their place.” Hadrian just raised an eyebrow at his mother’s outburst. “Mother. Please.” Severus looked at his son and decided to listen for once. “Moving on from that. What happened to you Hades?” Hadrian was confused. “What do you mean?” he asked. “We never really got the chance to catch up. Everything in the past week was so overwhelming and I didn’t get the chance to talk to you alone. I have so much to ask you. I wanted to ask you about your past.” Hadrian gave him a weird look. Back when he was Harry Potter, his mother constantly berated him for his “past”. Now, he wanted him to tell him everything. “I don’t get it,” he questioned. “When I was Harry Potter, you constantly mocked me for my past. How I was raised by Muggles. How I was the ‘boy who lived’. How I was ‘the son of Lily and James Potter’.” You should know more than enough about my past. I even remember one of the first things you told me when I entered your class.” Severus did remember what he said to his son. “I said: “Potter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?” Hadrian nodded, glad that his mother actually remembered. “That’s correct. I didn’t know anything at the time. Now I do.” Severus looked at his son with sorrow. For the past three years, he unknowingly tormented his own son. He always thought there was something off with the boy, but he should have figured it out sooner. “Hadrian,” he said. “I’m so sorry. I did not mean to hurt you in any way. Those three years at school must have been painful for you. If you don’t forgive me, that’s fine. But, please allow me to fix my mistakes. Let me be the mother I should have been.” Hadrian hugged his mother. “I forgive you. It’s just… when I was little, I thought no one could love me. Now, I see that I was wrong.” The two hugged for a while, letting their sorrows drift away in the moment. After that, Hadrian told his mother the little details of his past. “Mother, I know what you're thinking. Let Father take care of them, ok?” Severus relaxed, knowing that his son is ok with the idea of killing the ones who hurt him. “Mother?” “Yes, Hades?” “What are we going to do when we go back to Hogwarts?” Severus thought about the question that his son had brought up. “We won’t do anything to your name. You’ll just say that you were homeschooled when they ask for any transferred students.” “Ok, but what about you? Will you be ok?” “I can manage. As long as your father stays with you, I’ll be fine.” “Alright, Mother. I’ll let you rest.” Hadrian smiled at his mother before leaving the room and closed the door behind him. Hadrian walked down the hall to the stairs. When Hadrian got downstairs, he was met with the others from the training yard. “What do you guys want?” Hadrian wasn’t in any mood to deal with any more questions. Draco walked over, looking upset with himself. He should have listened to his mate. Draco hugged Hadrian close, trying to calm him down. Once Hadrian was in his mate’s arms, he started to calm down and snuggled into his chest. “I’m sorry that I didn’t listen to you.” Hadrian looked at his mate. “It’s fine. Just listen next time, ok?” “Yes, Hades.”
Hadrian woke up to a beautiful morning and his father in his snake form staring at him again. “I see you made it out alive. I’m glad to see that you are ok Father, but what are you doing?” His father shook his body and slithered closer to his son. “Just here to make sure you are not worrying about me. I killed Moody and it was amazing,” he hissed. “You could’ve said that later. It’s early in the morning. What are you even doing up?” Tom the snake tilted his head, wondering if his son had forgotten all about the day before. “It’s time for school. You better get ready, or you are going to be late. If you are, your mother will have your head.” When Hadrian heard his father say the word ‘school’, he perked up immediately. He got himself ready for his first day back, supplies slipping out of his grip. Most of the Slytherins were already prepared for the day, some rushing out for breakfast and some talking away in no rush. Hadrian saw Draco talking with Pansy and Blaise. He walked over to the small group and hugged his mate. “Good morning, Draco. How are you?” Draco hopped off the arm of the chair and picked up his mate. He twirled Hadrian around, the two happy in each other’s company. “Good. Just telling Pansy and Blaise here about the summer.” Pansy, with her hands folded, gave the two a sly smile. “I heard how you two got together. It’s nice to see Draco here with a special someone. I was getting tired of having to deal with him all the time.” She winked at Draco, letting him know that she was just kidding. “I’ll leave you two lovebirds alone.” The Slytherin girl skipped away and out of the common room. Hadrian and Draco watched her skip away, with Blaise running after her. After a minute, Valorie and Remy walked out of their bedroom. Remy was tugging Valorie along, who was half-asleep and with a rumpled robe. “Do we really have to wake up this early in the morning?” Valorie whined. “How come we can’t go to class around, I don’t know, nine-ish?” Hadrian shook his head. His sister may be very free-spirited, but she sure is lazy. “Sis, we are not heading to class right now. We are heading to the Great Hall for breakfast. Do you really want to miss breakfast?” When he said they might miss breakfast, Valorie’s eyes shot open. Even though she doesn’t really like the food here, the thought of missing a meal made her angry. “Fine, I guess we can head out for breakfast.” Valorie twirled her wand, threw it in the air, and caught it in a fighting stance. “The food here is just to energize me before we can kick Dumb-as-a-Door’s butt.” The four followed Severus, who was holding Amelia, to the Great Hall. The other three houses and the visiting schools were already filing in. The shock from yesterday’s news wore off a little, but a lot of the students were sad to hear of Harry and Hermione’s ‘death’. Hadrian and Remy caught some of their whispers amongst the giant crowd. “I can’t believe they’re gone,” a Hufflepuff sobbed. “Those two were one of the strongest people here. To be taken down by the Dark Lord, it’s awful.” a boy from Ravenclaw whispered to his friends. “We lost people from our own house. Harry, Hermione, and Ron would always be the ones to stop the evil threatening Hogwarts. Without the other two, we won’t stand a chance against You-Know-Who. How are you feeling about this, Ron?” Hadrian recognized the voice who was talking: Neville Longbottom from Gryffindor. Ron walked next to him, his face cast down to the ground and not responding to Neville’s question. Seamus Finnigan, the other person next to Neville, gave Ron a hug. “Don’t worry, Ron. They’re in a better place now. If anything, they might be honored up there as heroes for standing up to You-Know-Who. I’m as sad as you are, but try to be hopeful in knowing they are ok.” Ron didn’t respond to Seamus either. He looked away from his friends, trying to focus on something else. When he did, his eyes fell on Hadrian. The former friends stared at each other for a moment, one filled with hate, while the other filled with fear. Ron could feel the raw power emanating from Hadrian. Now that he knew the truth, he did not want to cross paths with him. They tore their gaze and returned looking away. Ron and Hadrian left for their respective tables. Once they sat down, the others noticed he was mad. “What’s wrong, Hades?” Remy asked him. Hadrian looked away from her, putting up an emotional wall around him. “Nothing,” Hadrian said quickly. He didn’t want to trouble Remy with his thoughts, especially with ones that are crucial to taking down Dumbledore. Many students were already helping themselves to the food, while the four of them took the bare minimum. Draco, Valorie, and Remy were slowly eating their food and Hadrian barely touched his at all. Thoughts spun around his head. Ron was just Dumbledore’s pawn in the game of chess that is war. He had been manipulated into aiding the headmaster. Someone that close to Dumbledore and who knew Hadrian as Harry had to be taken out. A plan was formulating in Hadrian’s mind, trying to find the most fool-proof plan to take Ron out of the game. “Stab his chest. Break his neck. Smash his head. I wonder which one I should do. Maybe I’ll let that traitor choose…” The doors flew open, interrupting his thoughts. Professor McGonagall rushed into the room, out of breath and terrified. “Alastor is dead! I just found his body. Alastor is dead!” Everyone’s heads swiveled around in shock. Dumbledore got up from his seat and came to McGonagall’s side. “What happened, Minerva?” McGonagall's lips trembled as she recounted the horrific sight. “Alastor...he was...murdered. Someone must have snuck in...and killed him!” Dumbledore appeared pretty calm on the outside, but he was paralyzed with fear on the inside. He turned to the professors sitting at the table. “Professors, keep the students here. No one goes in or out. I will have the ghosts searching for any possible invaders. After last year’s incident, there is no telling what’s out there.” His voice then boomed to everyone. “Students, stay here. If anyone were to sneak out, they would be getting a long detention. I have both your professors and the ghosts keeping a watchful eye. Do not disobey.” Dumbledore followed McGonagall out of the room. Both teachers and students were left in shock. They were not saddened by Moody’s death, for they knew little about him and figured he was not one to be missed by many. They were in shock because attacks have been occurring before their arrival at Hogwarts. Everyone but the Riddles, Malfoy, and Remy had the same thought running through their minds: Who is after them this time? Hadrian caught his mother’s eye, signaling him that they needed to talk. They gathered in the corner of the room and away from the large crowd who was gossiping about the recent deaths occurring. “I saw that you looked troubled when you walked in. Are you ok?” his mother questioned. Hadrian knew he could trust him with his plans. He was the most trustworthy person in his entire life. “It’s Ron...he came to us on the train.” Severus’s eyes widened. He was surprised his son didn’t say anything before. “Why didn’t you tell me?” he scolded. “I thought it wasn’t the right time. Besides, you would  have already been overwhelmed with everything.” Hadrian’s mother gave him a weird look. “You think I'm going to be overwhelmed. It’s already overwhelming for me, being a teacher and all the ‘deaths’,” Hadrian waited for him to calm down before speaking. “I actually have a plan to take Ronald Weasley out. Please don’t tell anyone. I need to do this alone.” Severus contemplated his son’s thoughts. As much as he would like to tell him that it would be better if he had help, he decided to respect his son’s wishes and not tell anyone. “All right. No one will know. Just promise me that you will be careful. That you won’t be reckless.” Hadrian nodded his head. “I promise.” The two were about to hug, but realized they had to keep up their covers. They returned to their seats, their spirits lifted a little. Valorie noticed that Hadrian seemed happier than before. “So, what did Mother say?” Hadrian didn’t like lying to his family, but he had to keep them safe. “He said not to worry about Father. That Dumbledore’s patrol will not be able to find him and that they will be too dumb to see that Moody died from a snake bite.” Valorie smirked at the thought of the professors being too dumb to find out the real reason Moody died. “I would love to grab some popcorn and secretly watch them stumble around, trying to find out how Moody died.” Minutes passed. The Great Hall was still in a tizzy. No one tried to sneak out because they did not want to be killed by the murderous striker. Dumbledore came back, his face pallid and eyes wide. The students were shocked. During the attacks the last three years, Dumbledore was surprisingly calm. They have never seen him look so terrified. Whatever had attacked must have been powerful. “Students…”he boomed. “To our dismay, Professor Moody was murdered. With him gone, there will be no Defense Against the Dark Arts this year. No one was viable to take a position, so we have no other teachers to take over.” Hagrid stood up from his seat, the table bumping from his immense strength. “Professor Dumbledore, sir? How ‘bout Professor Lupin? He has taught teh class before. An’ teh students love ‘im. I know he resigned after las’ year, but I think he’s perfect for teh job.” Hagrid shifted uncomfortably, wondering if he should be suggesting something this bold. Dumbledore thought about this. Remus was a great fit for the position. Everyone thought he was great. He might be part werewolf, but was the most successful in teaching the students. “Very well, Hagrid. I’ll send word to Lupin that he has been offered his position again. Professors, please escort your students to their classes. This will be mandatory until the threat has been subdued.” Severus led his fourth-years down to the dungeons, the temperature getting colder when they walked down a flight of stairs. “Pssst. I said, pssst. Guys.” Remy tried to get the other’s attention. “I heard your pssst, Remy. What is so important now?” Draco asked. “Before we left for Hogwarts, my mother said that he will meet us here soon. I didn’t know what he meant, but now I do. He was expecting Dumbledore to offer him his position as the DADA professor after Moody died. Now that he is coming, he will be able to assist us more easily.” Her mother had plans that were subtle, not easily detected. Even last year, her mother had secretly planned to help her father from getting captured. Remy didn’t figure it out until she saw the both of them helping each other out. The plan was just subtle enough to not seem suspicious. “I still cannot believe that oaf Hagrid had formed that plan. I thought he was all brawn, no brains.”  Hadrian got mad when Draco referred to Hagrid like that. “Don’t talk about him like that. He may work for Dumbledore, but he is very sweet and helpful.” Draco rolled his eyes. As much as he did not like Hagrid, he would not talk about him like that for his boyfriend’s sake. “Fine...but only for you.” Hadrian smiled and snuggled next to Draco as they walked. The fourth-year’s went further down, until they reached his mother’s classroom. Hadrian walked in, looking at the same old classroom that seemed different. As Harry Potter, he dreaded going down here. That was his least favorite class. Now that he has changed, it did not seem as dreary anymore. “Please, take your seats.” Severus told the class. The Slytherins started to separate into their tables, sitting next to their friends. Hadrian, Draco, Valorie, and Remy sat at the table closest to Severus so they could converse whenever they could.
Tom was looking for Severus when he heard the creak of a rocking chair. Tom followed the sound to the nursery that he had made for his unborn twins. Once he opened the door, he found Severus sitting in the rocking chair that was placed in the corner of the room. Severus’s eyes were closed, his hands on his nine month pregnant stomach. “My dark angel, what are you doing up this late?” Severus opened his eyes, looking at Tom. “I couldn’t sleep.” he said. “So, I decided to stay here in the nursery, thinking about how we will raise our children.” Tom walked over to his husband, kneeling in front of the chair. “I’ll stay with you. When you get tired, I will help you to bed,” Tom said. He placed his head on Severus’s stomach, hugging his husband and their unborn children. The two relaxed there for hours, talking about the littlest of things and Tom kept feeling his unborn children’s kicks. They smiled in each other’s company, excited to start their own family together.
Feeling more refreshed than she had in the past couple of days, Narcissa greeted the new day. Lucius was already awake before her, getting his responsibilities taken care of. He let her sleep in that night. Making the bed and getting ready, she felt sharp enough to tackle today. Heading downstairs, she met up with the others who welcomed her. Lucius got up from his spot and gave Narcissa a good morning kiss. “Did you sleep well last night?” he asked. She nodded with much vigor. “Yes. I slept quite well. I wasn’t kept up worrying last night, thanks to you and Elaina.” When Narcissa said that, Elaina bounded up and gave her a bear hug. “You’re welcome! Anything for my friends!” Narcissa smiled and returned Elaina’s hug with a softer one. From where she stood, she saw the potion table filled with the ingredients her husband and Elaina brought home. That pile was what she was going to be tackling for most of the day: making potions from those ingredients. “I can’t thank you enough for these. Our supplies have been worrying me for the past couple of days. I almost considered going to Diagon Alley to restock, even though Tom and Severus said not to head there,” Narcissa said. Sirius got up from his spot on the couch. “Going there and any other densely populated areas are dangerous. You and your family were prime suspects during the First Wizarding War, Narcissa. People are quick to judge you for your past. The deaths that Tom and the others are causing at Hogwarts will cause others to point fingers at people like us. Remember last year? My face was plastered everywhere! I was wanted for murders that I didn’t cause. You’d think people would know my calling signs whenever that happens by now. Stupid Peter Pettigrew! That’s why I left the Marauders when I did. His kind causes trouble.” Naricissa drummed her fingers on the table and looked up at the ceiling. Closing her eyes for a brief moment, she felt the energy of the protective shield surge through the area. The barrier kept them safe inside the manor. Going beyond the sea of trees and into the outside world beyond made her wonder what terrible fate would await them there if they were to leave. Rubbing out the after-images her eyes became speckled with, Narcissa slowly headed to the potions table and got to work. “I’ll be over here if anyone needs me,” she said to them while thumbing through a potion book. Deciding to make a Wiggenweld potion first, she gathered up the remaining ingredients from the cabinet and the bundles of dittany, mint, and tree bark that was laid near Lucius’s bag. Following the directions to the letter from her book, she brewed the potion. It took her nearly twenty minutes to finish. Although her measurements were deadly accurate, Narcissa checked three times to make sure that her ingredients were administered correctly. As she cleared off the table to start her next potion, she found a daisy that had fallen from the rest of the bundle. She placed it in her hair, straightening it in her braid. Daisies made her feel cheerful. Narcissa got back to work. For the next few hours, she made vats of Blood Replenishing Potion, Pepperup Potion, Wound-cleaning Potion, Sleeping Draught, and Murtlap Essence. Narcissa ladled the freshly-brewed potion into an empty vat, its bitter smoke wafting through the air. She spotted Lucius and Elaina talking in a hushed tone near one of the staircases. They kept glancing in her direction constantly, hiding their smiles and laughs throughout their secretive conversation. “I hope you’re not thinking of going on a midnight date with Elaina, Lucius,” Narcissa joked in a jealous tone. Lucius looked at Narcissa. Deciding to play along with her joke, he hugged Elaina as a couple would. “Maybe I am. Elaina is such a gem. Not that you would know,” he mocked and began laughing. Narcissa and Elaina joined in and they laughed together. “I’m heading outside. Do you need any more ingredients for the potions, Narcissa? I can go run and get some.” The potion-maker shook her head, concentrating on carefully ladling the rest of the potion into the vat. “I have more than enough. Thank you though.” Before Elaina could head out, Lucius grabbed her shoulder and whispered something in her ear. A high-pitched squeal followed with her rapidly whispering a response back. That raised suspicion for Narcissa. She wondered how close those two were the other night. “What did she tell you?” Narcissa inquired. “She told me that...I left a few things upstairs and I need to go get it. I’m going to get it, right now.” She watched him hurry up the stairs. Narcissa knew he was lying, but decided to let it go and refocus on the potions. Flipping to a different page, she heard a tap, tap, tap, on the window. Expecting to see Elaina giving her usual positive motivation, she was caught off guard when she saw an owl. “That’s odd. I don’t remember us expecting any mail.” Letting the bird in, she untied the parchment from its leg. It hopped around, perching on top of a chair and nestling into a feathery ball of fluff. With the mail in hand, she opened it up. A hand flew to her mouth when she gasped. The letter contained the familiar handwriting of her big sister: Bellatrix. Narcissa hadn’t heard from her sister in a long time. Ever since Bellatrix lost her sons, her life spiraled downward. Her husband was unjustly imprisoned in Azkaban by Dumbledore and she lost the luxurious life she had. Throughout the years, Narcissa heard less and less from her sister. The letters between them became infrequent and they rarely visited each other anymore. Narcissa partly blamed herself for them growing apart. She and Lucius were still recovering from their own problems that she wasn’t able to help her own sister. Narcissa slowly tore the top of the letter, nervous to read its contents. She sank down onto the same chair the owl perched on and read the letter:
“Wake up.” Ron did as he was told. He got up from his bed and stood there, a blank expression across his face. “Now, head to the Chamber of Secrets to help your sister,” a mysterious voice commanded. The Gryffindor did what he was told and started making his way down to the Chamber. Ron thought it was a dream, nothing more than a particularly vivid dream. He dreamt that he was walking down the stairs to the Gryffidor common room and heading out the door. It was one of those dreams that were perfect in every detail. It didn’t seem like it was that scary right now. It was just...odd. The paintings on the wall were urging him to go back to bed before Filch caught him. He didn’t care. As long as he could save Ginny from the Chamber of Secrets again, getting caught was the least of his problems. “No. Avoid getting seen by the ghosts and Filch, or you will never see your sister again,” the voice warned him. Ron did not want that to happen, so he crept carefully whenever the patrol was within his vicinity. He reached the girl’s bathroom and swung the door wide open. He looked around. The bathroom was empty, the smell of the sewer reached his nose. “Ron Weasley,” a familiar voice called out. Ron looked around and spotted Moaning Myrtle perched on her windowsill. “How wonderful to see you again.” Ron looked at the ghostly girl and a sense of obedience washed over him. “Hi, Myrtle. What are you doing up there?” Myrtle smiled a big cat-like grin and giggled. “Oh, you know, floating here and there and everywhere, thinking about death. I’m actually glad that you came. I saw your sister head into the Chamber of Secrets again. Brought up so many memories from two years ago.” A prickel went up Ron’s spine, jolting him to focus. “What is Ginny doing down there?” Ron asked Myrtle. “She said that something important was down in the Chamber and needed to go get it. I tried to warn her to not go there, but she didn’t listen. I always tell the living a little motto of mine: never head back to the place you nearly died, or you might not be so lucky the next time.” The mysterious voice in Ron’s head started to speak to him again. “Ask her what happened to Ginny.” Ron complied with the voice. “What happened to Ginny?” Myrtle faked a look of concern, trying to get Ron to comply. “I don’t know. After a few minutes, I heard a terrible screaming coming from down below. It sounded like she was in horrible pain. Tortured! It’s a good thing that you came. You can rescue her.” Ron was determined to get his sister back, so he walked over the sinks, the sealed entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. When Harry had opened the door, he spoke in Parseltongue. Even though Ron didn’t know how to speak the language, he remembered bits and pieces that Harry whispered in his sleep “Open up,” Ron hissed. The sinks began to open the door and revealed the large hole that led down into the Chamber. Ron looked back at Myrtle, who nodded at him to press on. Ron stared at the hole for a moment and then jumped down into its dark, slimy depths. The boy looked around the darkness that was all around him, the tunnels stretching out like a snake. “Go ahead. You know the way.” Ron trekked through the tunnels, his feet crunching on rat skulls and rotting snake skin. He made his way to the center of the Chamber, the same place where he saw Ginny being tortured in his dream. It looked just like it did two years ago, except for a decaying basilisk corpse splayed out on the floor. “Ginny?! Are you here?” Ron looked around for his sister, but found nothing. In the shadows, Hadrian watched Ron and slowly walked out as Ron turned his back. Hadrian picked up a basilisk bone from the floor and creeped his way toward Ron. Hadrian hit Ron over the head; the Gryffindor collapsed on the floor and blacked out.
Hadrian was still trying to wrap his head around the information his father told him. “My Father was never the true dark lord and Mother never truly hated me. They were forced by the pain they felt when they lost me and my sister. Dumbledore is the real evil, and he wants my entire family dead.” That thought spun around in his mind many times, popping up whenever he tried to think of something else. Valorie, Remy, and the others looked just as shocked as he felt. They were rubbing their heads anxiously, processing the truth. No one spoke for a couple minutes, the silence deafening. Valorie started to pace frivolously in circles. When she did stop, she turned and punched a wall. “Are you ok over there?” Draco said sarcastically. “You could have broken your hand, Valorie.” Valorie walked up to him, glaring daggers from his comment. “Val,” Hadrian called over to her. She looked up at her brother and saw him shaking his head. The look in his eyes made her back away. Valorie now knew the power he possessed was strong and did not want to provoke him more. She sat back down, collecting herself. Hadrian looked to his father, who pretended to read more of his tome. No one was going to ask the first question, so Hadrian decided to step up. “Father, what’s going to happen now? How are we going to defend ourselves against Dumbledore if he attacks?” His father looked at him with alarm in his eyes. “I never wanted to teach you such skills under these circumstances, but you and your family need to be prepared for the coming battle. I’ll teach you spells that are not taught at the school,” he told his son. Elaina chimed in, eager to help her nephew. “And I’ll teach you your vampire skills with your mother.” Hadrian turned to Remy, Valorie, and Draco, worried about their wellbeing too. “What about you?” he asked them. “I’ll teach them everything they need to know,” Remus stepped in. “After all, I was a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. With proper training, they will be able to stand against even the most powerful wizards.” Hadrian looked at everyone, surprised that they were willing to stand up against a powerful wizard who manipulated most of the magic community. He smiled confidently, certain that they were going to succeed. “So, when do we start?” Hadrian asked his father. “Tomorrow, at dawn. You will be assigned your tasks for the day and have to follow exactly what we tell you. There is no room for error during a fight. For, now all of you should get some sleep. All of us had an exhausting day.” Severus appeared next to Tom, waiting in the shadow he warped from. Tom noticed his husband in the corner of his eye and turned to him, smiling slyly. “Sneaking up on me, Dark Angel? You know you cannot startle me.” Severus grinned weakly at Tom. He swayed in his few steps toward him and fainted in his arms. “Severus!” his husband screamed. Tom cradled him in his arms, holding him close. The twins rushed to their mother’s side, concerned about his fainting spell. Their father told them to back up and give them both some space. Tom looked at Severus with love and fear in his eyes. He put his head down on Severus’s chest, waiting to hear the two sounds that made sure he was ok. Tom heard his soft breaths that were indicated by the rise and fall of his chest; he also heard his heartbeat, rhythmically thumping against his ribcage. Tears streaked down Tom’s face, saddened that his husband was unwell. “Oh, Angel. You shouldn’t be shadow traveling in your current condition. You could hurt yourself and our baby,” he whispered. Tom scooped Severus into his arms and tried to regain his balance on his feet. “I have to take Severus back to bed. The rest of you should go to sleep. You’ll have a long day tomorrow. I will see you all in the morning. Good night,” he said to the others. Tom trailed to his room and the others followed suit. The road ahead was going to be long and tedious for all of them, so they prepared for their last peaceful night before the coming storm.
Tom was trying to sleep when he heard Hadrian yelling. He groaned and he carefully moved a sleeping Severus off of his chest, but accidentally woke the pregnant male up. “T-tom what are you doing?” Tom looked at the other and smiled softly at his husband. “Don’t worry. I’m just going to check on the others. Please, go back to sleep, love.” Severus placed his head on the pillow before closing his eyes and falling back asleep. Tom got up and walked to the door before turning to look at the other male. He slipped out of the room and made his way to the stairs, where he saw Hadrian standing in front of Draco, shielding him from a girl. “What the….?” was all Tom thought as he walked down the stairs. “Hadrian? What’s with all the yelling? Your mother needs to sleep, but can’t with all the yelling, and who is this girl?” Tom scolded the teen.  “Sorry Father, and this is Remy. Sirius and Remus’s daughter. “Hello to you too, Father.” Tom turned his head to see his little girl standing there with his sister-in-law. “Valorie, is that you?”  “Yes Father, it’s me.” Tom ran over to his daughter and hugged her. “Where’s Mother?” “He’s asleep right now. Elaina gave Tom a look. “What is it Elaina?” “Me. You. Talk. Now. Privately.” “Alright, Elaina. I’ll be right back. And please try not to yell.” “Yes, Father.’’ the twins said together as Tom led Elaina to an empty room. “What do you want to talk about, Elaina?”  “What’s really wrong with my brother, Tom?” Elaina glared at him.  Tom just sighed and looked straight into the girl’s eyes. “Severus is pregnant again, Elaina. We just found out a week before we learned Hadrian was alive.” Tom watched as Elaina’s eyes widened with shock. “And no one else knows?” Tom nodded. “That's correct. Why?” Elaina sighed exasperatedly at her brother-in-law. He was dense sometimes. “Well, don’t you think that little tidbit of information would have been useful to tell HIS SISTER?!” she screamed. “Well, I told you now did I not? Dumbledore could have found out and killed both of them, or even Hadrian and Valorie!” Elaina thought about what he said. Tom may have had his unorthodox ways of telling people important things, but he always had his reasons why. “Ok, fair point. Dumbledore has been known to the few he hunts to torture information out of them. He nearly did that to me when he caught me. Luckily, I gave him false information and escaped in the process,” she complimented herself. “Elaina, I know you have been a shadow to all you hide from, but our family here is not like you,” Tom warned. “You have had that experience for fourteen years. The others do not know what it is like to be on the run from Dumbledore. He’s relentless. He will not stop until he has what he wants. And he wants to kill us and our family.” Elaina frowned, contemplating his words. Everything they did was to protect their family and friends. She wasn’t going to let Dumbledore win and she wasn’t going down without a fight. “Fine, I’ll let you keep your little secrets, even from me. There’s no telling what’s going to happen to the others when they are out of our reach. Although, I do ask of you to tell the others of the situation. They have the right to know, now that they are on our side,” she implored him. “Ok, I’ll tell them.” Elaina was happy that Tom cooperated with her. “Thank you, Tom. Come on.”
“It’s ok, mother. You’re going to be ok.” Severus heard this over and over as his son, Draco, and the rest of his family helped him. Although he wanted to press his hands over his hurting stomach, Hadrian and Draco linked arms with him to make sure he wouldn’t fall. Severus watched the ground as he walked. Step by step, he balanced himself. He felt Tom’s scaly face rub against his shoulder. Tom softly hissed in his ear. Severus could only translate bits and pieces of what he said. “...you’ll...fine. Our baby...causing...pain. When...get back...tell Narcissa….want...hear this.” Severus groaned in his mind. Once he’d tell Narcissa, she’d be all over his case, nitpicking everything he is doing wrong. He could hear her voice now. “You're too this! Stop doing that! Take things slow from now on!” It gave him even more of a headache just thinking about it. Hadrian opened the door. Madam Pomferey was cleaning up after a long day’s work. When her eyes fell on Severus, she rushed to help him to a bed. She got him situated, making sure he was comfortable. Before doing anything further, she closed the doors and locked them. “What happened?” she asked worriedly. Tom transformed back into his human form after Hadrian had placed him down on the floor. “Severus began to feel pain in his stomach. I fear that something horrible is happening. Also, it’s good to see you again, Poppy.” “Likewise. Is there anything that I need to know of? Severus is not a regular here unless it is to use some of my supplies.” Tom told her of Severus’s pregnancy. Poppy was able to be trusted. She helped Severus a lot when he was a student all those years ago. “I see. Congratulations on your child. From what you told me last time, the twins birth was difficult. This time is no exception.” Taking out her wand, she began to cast diagnostic spells. The sparkles that flew out of her wand fluttered down and were absorbed by Severus’s skin. It felt quite warm and comforting, like a blanket. Severus closed his eyes from bright sparkles and tried to calm himself as much as could. After a couple of minutes, Madam Pomferey finished casting. “Is my mother going to be ok?” Hadrian asked her. Madam Pomferey hesitated for a second. She didn’t want to worry Tom and his family, but they had to know what was going on. “Severus...well, he is being affected by the baby. That glamour spell that is being cast not only hides his bump. It shrinks it for a full effect. The spell is what is preventing the baby from growing properly. Added with stress and a number of other problems, it can cause, well, this.” Poppy placed the tip of her wand on his stomach and broke the glamour spell, revealing how large the vampire’s stomach had gotten. Tom walked over and placed his hand on Severus’s stomach. “Better?” Severus could only give a weak nod. Tom was somewhat relieved. His husband still looked pale. The spell really did take a toll on him. “I’m going to keep him overnight for observation,” Poppy told them. “I have plenty of potions that can make him feel better, but I want to make sure that there isn’t anything else I’m missing. There aren’t going to be anymore people coming at this hour. You’re welcome to visit him.” The twins smiled when she said that. Severus looked like he was going to fall asleep, so Hadrian, Valorie, and Tom each gave him a kiss on the forehead and left him to rest.

Hadrian heard the door open. He saw Remy and Remus walk out of the upstairs office. He noticed that Remy looked a little different. More cheerful and uplifted. “Hey, you ok Rem?” he asked. “Yeah. Mother and I were just catching up.” As they headed downstairs, the sunlight shone like a spotlight. It caught Remy's eyes and briefly turned them into an amber gold. Hadrian spotted that brief change of color and knew that the little reunion also had something to do with Remy being part wolf. Remus fell into their circle. “I had some plans for you, but I see that it has been compromised,” he grimaced. “What were the plans and how did they become compromised?” Draco asked him. Remus gave Hadrian a prolonged glance before explaining. “Well, I was going to tell you that you could use my classroom as a place to train in secret. However, after what Hadrian pulled today, I do not think that is possible. Hadrian, do not think I am scolding you. You did right by removing Ms. Weasley from Dumbledore’s grasp.” Remy jumped in the conversation. “Now that the Gryffindors are suspicious that mother did nothing to intervene in the fight, the students and possibly the teachers will become more nosy. It’s becoming highly probable that they will snoop and that will ruin our mission. What mother is trying to say is that we need to find a new place to train.” Valorie groaned. “Great. We gained a cool training place and lost it in a matter of hours. Where are we going to find another one?” “There are some spare classrooms around the castle. Usually, no one uses them. Try to see if any of them are empty. I’m sure at least one would be open.” Remus said. Hadrian led the others out of the classroom. “Bye, Mother. Thank you!” Remy called out to him. Hadrian started their search from the ground up. They checked to see if any part of the dungeons were vacant. Peeking their heads through the doors, they found empty rooms, but it was dirty, infested with rats, and overall were terrible training rooms. Since the dungeons were crossed out of the list, they walked upwards through the castle. So far, the rooms they thought were empty were either cramped storage rooms or filled with students doing club activities. Getting closer to the towers, they knew there were smaller numbers of vacant rooms, but it was likely that the teachers would visit there often. The group trudged up three more staircases before Valorie dramatically slumped to the floor. “We are never going to find a training room. I was thinking that we could take our chances in the woods, but even that seems risky. Our spot in Professor Lupin’s classroom and the likelihood of getting caught there is starting to look better and better.” Hadrian sat down next to his sister and pulled his legs to his chest. “We need somewhere to practice fighting. There must be some place we can train. Somewhere Dumbledore can’t reach. I just wish we could find it,” he thought. After staring at the ground for a minute, he looked up and saw something weird. What he thought was an empty wall in front of him now suddenly had a door. Making sure that he wasn’t hallucinating, he got the other’s attention. “Hey, guys? Was that door always there?” Valorie, Remy, and Draco looked up and saw the door that wasn’t there before. It was a much bigger door than the other ones down the hall. It was gilded with gold designs and the doorknobs bore the Hogwarts crest. “Um, do the hallways change like the stairs, brother?” Valorie asked. Hadrian shook his head. “No. Neither the hallways nor the doors change. We are still in the same place. So, that door got there by magic. Somehow.” He got up and traced a finger over the doorknob. For some reason, Hadrian had a good feeling about this room. He slowly opened the door and walked in. He motioned for the others to enter and they all stepped into a dark room. He couldn’t see much at first, but once his eyes adjusted, he was able to see around the room. Boxes and bookshelves lined the edges of the room. Cushions were piled up in the left corner. It looked like an unused storage room, but there was one thing that made it look like it was being used. A wooden mannequin stood near the far wall, splintered in a few areas and had arrows sticking out of its head. As Hadrian started to approach it, he heard noises. He heard soft footfalls and the sound of someone breathing heavily. Surveying the room, he found nothing, but he knew that they were not alone. He drew his wand in defense. Valorie saw this and started to make her way to his side. “Brother, are you…” Valorie screamed before she could finish her sentence. She was thrown backwards into a wall by a spear that lodged itself into her sleeve. She tried to use her free hand to remove the weapon, but another spear hurled towards her out of the darkness and pinned her other arm by the sleeve. “Valorie! Are you all right?!” Hadrian yelled. “I’m fine, although I’m stuck to a wall right now. Don’t worry about me. I’ll free myself somehow. Just stop whoever is attacking us.” Hadrian had Remy and Draco form back-to-back in a circle, having eyes and ears on every side of the room. Remy took the chance to transform into her wolf. She concentrated on needing the wolf to protect her friends. Immediately, she felt her bones shifting in and out of place, her teeth growing sharper, and her skin morphing into fur that covered her body. Staying close to Draco and Hadrian, she surveyed the room with her heightened senses. She was able to see the room much better; every detail became enlarged and enhanced. Her enhanced hearing made her hear everything, from Valorie struggling to free herself to Hadrian and Draco breathing. Remy picked up on another sound that wasn’t coming from her friends: the fluttering of wings. She looked to where the sound was being produced and saw a small, pink butterfly flapping around. The butterfly disappeared behind a few stacked crates. After a few seconds, Remy heard soft footfalls where the butterfly was moments ago. She realized that the attacker was able to transform into an animagus and was trying to be invisible to their senses. Remy stalked toward the crates, snarling and growling to scare the attacker. She suddenly heard the attacker moving quickly. Remy ran towards the crates, barking with her fangs bared. As she was about to leap over the crates, she saw a sharp and gleaming piece of metal peeking out of the top of a crate. She tried to stop herself, but it was too late. The attacker released an arrow that pierced her chest, knocking her unconscious. Valorie watched in horror as she saw her mate get hurt. “REMY!” she screamed. Valorie looked to Draco and Hadrian. Draco took a defensive stance in front of Hadrian. “Stay close to me. I’ll protect you,” he ordered. In those few moments, everything was silent. Nothing moved, not even Valorie who was struggling seconds ago. They knew the attacker wasn’t done yet. Draco sensed the air was changing. Looking around, he saw fog curling and flowing in the air. When the fog wrapped around the entire room, the smoky ribbons thickened until their sight was reduced to a few feet. “Our attacker must be pretty strong if they are able to control the primal magic of air. Be careful, Dray,” Hadrian warned Draco in a hushed voice. “Stupefy!” a voice yelled. A blast of magic hurled towards Draco and Hadrian. They were able to dodge it successfully. Taking Hadrian’s hand, Draco kept his mate from harm’s grasp. The attacker used the fog to their advantage and blasted stun spells sporadically from every angle. Draco used shielding spells to protect the both of them. Minutes passed, and the attacker showed no sign of letting up. Suddenly, the spells stopped coming. Was their attacker finally worn out from using too much of their magic? Just as they barely let their guard down, the attacker produced a giant whirlwind. It swirled towards them, showing no relent. It shocked them still. Draco snapped out of his trance and realized that Hadrian hadn’t moved from behind him. Using his veela strength, Draco pushed Hadrian out of the tornado’s path and took his place. The whirlwind swept him off the ground and it was starting to become smaller yet stronger, becoming like a cage of winds. Draco tried to use his wings to fly out, but that made it worse and the current violently tossed him around. Hadrian landed on a soft cushion that broke his fall. Looking up, he saw his mate trying to break free of the winds. Hadrian was the only one left standing. Valorie was pinned to the wall, Remy was injured from the arrow, and Draco was stuck in a whirlwind. The rest of them were rendered useless, leaving the attacker to pick Hadrian off. He got up and gathered himself. He summoned his scythe to his side and took out his wand with his other hand. Out of nowhere, the attacker snatched his scythe from his grasp and ran into the fog. It was starting to dissipate and Hadrian was able to see his attacker more clearly. It was a small figure, smaller than him. A black cloak was wrapped around the figure and covered its face. And in its hand was Hadrian’s scythe. “That’s mine!” he bellowed. “Then come and take it,” the attacker taunted. “Oh…so THAT’S how you want to play.” Raising his hand high above his head, he called his scythe to him. The attacker tried to grip it tight to keep the weapon from leaving, but Hadrian’s pull was stronger and it flew out of the attacker’s hand and into his. It seemed that the attacker forgot that he was able to summon his weapon to wherever he stood. Hadrian flourished the scythe for a few swipes and entered a fighting stance. Letting a fierce battle cry, he charged at the attacker. The attacker stood in place, helpless and out of ideas. Yet to Hadrian’s shock, this attacker was full of surprises. It whipped out its wand and pointed to the left side of the room. “Accio sword!” A beautiful and ornate blade soared into its hand. It was a double-edged sword with a white hilt, embedded with a pink stone into the shape of a butterfly; its crossguard braided and curved into the shape of a heart. In the center of the hilt, a pink flower charm sat in the center. The blade itself was incredibly sharp. Hadrian thought he was hallucinating again, but as he charged, he thought he saw the blade glow with a white light, like a snowy fire that lit the sword ablaze. He thought that was impossible, since there was absolutely no record of magic swords. Hadrian swung the sword to try and cleave the attacker of its head, but the attacker managed an upper block just in time to parry his attack. The attacker swiped at him a few times, unsuccessfully swinging too late. They clashed blades over and over, Hadrian parrying the swing after swing. He used his veela strength to try and overpower the attacker, but it was surprisingly strong for such a small person. Getting nowhere, Hadrian quickly whipped out his wand and pointed it straight at the attacker. “Stupefy!” he screamed. The attacker did not flinch, did not scream, it did not even try to move. As the spell flashed towards it, it raised its sword and swung at the stun spell. Immediately, the spell shattered into nothingness. The Riddle boy recoiled in surprise. “That’s not possible. There are not any swords that can affect magic. How?” he thought to himself. The attacker took that moment to turn the tables and lunged towards Hadrian. That lunge knocked him off balance and snagged a piece of his robe. Regaining his balance, he blocked another oncoming attack to his chest, but he left his face unprotected. The attacker slashed at his face and cut his forehead, drawing blood. Hadrian winced in pain, his hand fumbling his scythe. He held a hand over his wound, feeling the blood drip onto his palm. Adrenaline coursed through his veins and his eyes burned a bright red. Hadrian and the attacker clashed once again. Metal upon metal rang throughout the room. Valorie watched them fight from afar. She could tell that something was off about their attacker, something that made it different from the rest of their enemies. She could tell from the way the attacker fought back. When she saw Dumbledore’s goons attack, they attacked with no purpose other than for their own personal gain. However, she could tell that the attacker was fighting with honor and valor. Fighting for a greater purpose than itself, or what it thinks is a ‘greater purpose’. Something that Dumb-as-a-Door and his chickens did not have. Valorie did not know why she had the feeling since the attacker was hurting her friends, but it was something she could not shake. Once again, sword met scythe and their weapons locked together. Hadrian intentionally let the attacker push him, which led him to counterattack. Using his opponent's weight against itself, he led the attacker off balance and slashed at its arm. Taking the small opportunity, he kicked the attacker in the stomach with his veela strength. Even though he knocked it to the ground, it tried to force its way back onto its feet. Hadrian had enough, so he sent a massive wave of dark magic. He knew the attacker could not block that with a tiny sword, and he was right. The attacker was knocked unconscious, its sword landing a few inches away from its hand. With the attacker unable to sustain its power while it was unconscious, the cage of winds dispelled and Draco was set free. Breathing heavily, he ran to Draco’s aid. Draco was frazzled when he fell from the winds. His hair was an utter mess and stray feathers fell from his wings. “Are you ok?” Hadrian asked him. “Well, other than being tossed around in a cramped and freezing cage of air, I’m fine. Although, I think I should be asking you that,” Draco said gesturing at Hadrian’s cut. Hadrian touched the spot where the attacker struck him and it burned. It was not deep, but it was enough where it was bleeding more than an average cut. “It’s nothing. Barely even felt it. I’ll deal with it later. Right now, I think we should see the identity of who attacked us.” Valorie finally freed herself from the spears that pinned her to the wall. The spears fell to the floor with a loud clatter. “Wish that would have happened a few minutes ago.” With Valorie free, the three walked approached the attacker. Their attacker lay folded on the ground, unconscious from Hadrian’s use of magic. As they got closer, Hadrian noticed something. “Wait a moment, I recognize that cloak from earlier,” he mumbled. “Really? From where?” Draco asked him. “Do you remember that one student who tried to climb on the platform during my duel with Ginny? That student wore this exact same cloak. I can tell from its design. This must be the same person from earlier.” Hadrian kneeled next to the figure. “Who are you?” he muttered to himself. Grasping the attacker’s cloak in hand, Hadrian moved it to uncover who was underneath: a girl. She was small and slender, her skin a soft honey brown and her dark, wavy hair pulled back into a ponytail. She wore a Hogwarts uniform with the Gryffindor crest glimmering.    The unconscious girl woke up and looked up in fear as Hadrian approached her again and grabbed his scythe. “Let’s see here. What should we do with you? Oh, I know. Let's bring you to our father where you will be interrogated properly. Now, on your feet!” Hadrian laughed as he forced her to stand. Using her might, she fought the spell. She kicked her fallen blade into her hands, pointing the blade at his throat. “If you think that I am going to go with you without a fight, you are sorely mistaken,” she shouted. She swung her sword at him, but he caught the blade in the palm of his hand, causing blood to drip down his wrist (Ghirahim, anyone?). He was able to flip the blade into his hand and point it at her chest. “Huh. Predictable. You really are stupid. You should never threaten a veela.” He raised her own blade against her, ready to strike her down. However, Valorie stepped forward and stopped him. “Hadrian! Stop! Don’t hurt her. I can tell that she is different from the rest of the Gryffindors.” He still put in his strength to hit the Gryffindor, but Valorie kept defending her from Hadrian’s attack. Valorie did not know why she was defending the girl that attacked her friends, but she felt like she had to. Hadrian stopped, resting the sword at his side. The shaking girl looked at Valorie, confused. “But, why? Why did you save me?” Hadrian wasn’t himself. He was in full veela mode, eyes glowing red. Wing fully extended, flapping as he turned his anger towards his own sister. “Don’t test me, sister. Her punishment must be carried out.” “No, brother. You are not going to harm her. If you want to even lay a finger on her, you’ll have to go through me!” Draco walked next to Hadrian. “What is with you Valorie?! I thought that you were on our side Valorie.” Valorie slowly backed away from Draco and Hadrian realizing that she had screwed up as her brother started to giggle. The giggles, then turned into full blown laughter. “YOU THINK I’LL NOT ATTACK YOU? WELL YOU’RE WRONG!” Hadrian looked like their mother, when he killed his first ever victim, almost psychotic. “Hades! What are you acting like this?!” Even Draco was startled by his mate's behavior. “Remember what our mother is, dear Draco? A vampire! NOW EVERYONE SEES WHAT MYSELF AND MOTHER TRY TO HIDE: THE MONSTER WITHIN!! Hadrian dropped to his knees tears of blood running down his face as he started ripping at his own flesh on his arms. His two sides clashing and fighting for control. “Remy! Get our mother! NOW!” Valorie yelled as she tried to help her brother, only to get slashed at by the distress hybrid. Remy nodded her head and ran to Severus’s classroom, hugging her chest in pain. Draco tried to calm him down by holding his hand, but Hadrian backhanded his help and snarled in anger and pain. He held his face in his hands, gripping his hair into clumps. Tears streamed nonstop. He tried to make it stop, make the pain stop, but his mind did not listen. “I HATE THIS CONSTANT BATTLE OF BOTH SIDES TRYING TO TAKE OVER!” The Gryffindor girl looked at Hadrian with a sad look. She surprisingly felt bad that he had to be at war with parts of himself. She really, really did not want to help a Slytherin, much less a member of the Riddle family, but no one deserved to be in pain. Taking out her wand, she slowly approached Hadrian. “Hey. I am going to cast a spell that will relieve you of this pain. It might not fully take away all of it, but it will make you feel better.” He snarled at her, his pupils now thin slits. “I WANT NOTHING FROM YOU!” Hadrian snapped, remembering what the house of lions did to him when he was Harry Potter: forced him to fight his father, hate his mother and his mate and forcing him to be a hero he never wanted to be. “I’m still going to help you whether you want me to or not. Unlike you, I have honor for those in need.” She knelt to his side and pointed her wand directly over his heart. “Nakhgor Kaz’prin,” she chanted. A soft, white light began to emanate from her wand and arrowed into him. The unbearable pain quieted to a muted hum, almost as if he could ignore it if he tried. The spell began to take effect. As the white light began to palliate his pain, a dark cloud began to swirl out. The negative emotions he experienced manifested into an ominous shadow that casted itself upon Hadrian. The girl looked up at the cloud, surprised to see it slowly grow and grow. “I have never seen so much negative energy produced in one person…” she thought. Hadrian looked up at the girl with surprise. She, a Gryffindor no less, was helping him. They were fighting a few minutes ago, ready to tear each other apart, but she decided then and there to help him when he was at his lowest. Severus burst through the doors, his eyes frantic. “What’s going on?!” Remy led him to Hadrian, but they stopped halfway. They gawked at the scene: Hadrian allowing the Gryffindor attacker to help him. Severus shook his head as if that could erase the scene in front of him. “What are you doing to him?! Get away from my son!!” The Gryffindor girl’s magic wavered as she heard her professor say that. She connected the dots earlier, but she didn’t think that it would actually be true. “This is really Professor Snape’s son. Which means that they are family to the Dark Lord,” she said in her mind. Her magic began to dissipate, the white light fading away. When the last bit of it was snuffed out, Hadrian’s pain crashed into him, doubling over as it stole his breath. “Out of my way, little girl,” Severus said as he shoved her. Severus sat down with his legs out and laid Hadrian’s head on his chest. He began to smooth his son’s wings, knowing that usually comforts any veela. “It’s ok, Hadrian. It’s ok. I’m here,” Severus whispered. Hadrian began to calm down and purred, knowing that he was safe and loved in his mother’s arms. A few minutes passed by; everything was silent. Everyone looked at Severus and Hadrian, including the Gryffindor. Minutes passed. After Hadrian was no longer feeling the punishing pain, he got up and returned his attention to the girl. “You could have let me tear myself to pieces and taken me down then and there. Why didn’t you?” The girl hoisted herself up to her feet. She looked into his eyes with unwavering determination. “It’s because I am not like you. You are evil, vicious, and cruel. I helped you out of goodness. Good people help and forgive, but I don’t think your twisted soul can comprehend that. I saw what you did to Ginny. You attacked her, just like what you are going to do to the entire school. Punish those who won’t follow you, and turn the rest of them into your servants. I may not be strong enough to stop you, but I won’t let you harm anyone else.” Severus intervened. “No. Slytherins are not like that. Everything you know about us, well it’s nothing but lies you foolish girl.” She stepped back, but remained defensive. “Are you sure? From the looks of it, Slytherins are the liars. You are just violent instigators who crave for power. You take what you cannot have and destroy what you cannot control. The only reason Dumbledore still accepts you vile Slytherins in his school is to reform you to good. If it wasn’t for keeping up tradition and trying to change Slytherins for the better, he would be eliminating them. That would be the way to make things better. More orderly.” Hadrian couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Dumbledore brainwashed this girl into thinking that. If that’s what he told Gryffindor students, who knows what he told everyone else? “Oh, yeah?” he retorted. “Ever since Dumbledore came into power, he’s been poisoning people’s minds, burning homes to the ground, destroying families, including ours, and everything else he hates in his path! And you’re a part of it! How’s that for orderly?! Now tell me, is that what’s best for the world?!” The girl stepped back in disbelief. Dumbledore wouldn’t destroy the magical community like that, would he? “That can’t be right. That can’t be true; it doesn’t even make any sense. He would never do that. Dumbledore took me into this school when no one else did. He gave me a chance here, even though my beliefs are different than most people’s. He knew I had potential and gave me a chance for that, rather than what I believe in. He’s been nothing but supportive and kind. You-you don’t know him like I do.” Valorie came forward and laid a comforting hand on her shoulder. “Maybe you don’t know him like you think you do,” she told her. The Gryffindor hung her head, contemplating what Valorie said. She knew Dumbledore as the kind headmaster who accepted her into Hogwarts for her natural talent in magic. She could not see him as mean, much less than having an evil bone in his body. “Why would Dumbledore do something like that?” Valorie elaborated. “It’s because he is the evil one. He had everyone fooled that he was helping them, when in reality, he’s the one that’s hurting them. We want to stop him from hurting anyone else.” “If you can prove to me that Dumbledore really is who you say he is, I might be inclined to help you,” the Gryffindor said. “Great!” Valorie smiled. Hadrian stared at his sister. “Valorie! Are you kidding me?! Why are you so trusting towards her? Out of everyone here, I’d have thought that you would be the most suspicious.” “Hadrian, she wants to help us. Isn’t that enough proof that she is good?” Hadrian seethed with anger. His own sister was blind to what the Gryffindors really are. From his own experience, they were malicious manipulators. “I am not going to work with a Gryffindor. Gryffindors are monsters!” “Monsters?! You’re the monster! You attack people when they did nothing to you, just like what you did to Ginny.” “Try attempted seduction. She forced herself onto me and abandoned her own daughter in the woods, which my mother found. She and her family are traitors to wizard kind.” Valorie tried to stop them from arguing. “Whoa, whoa, Hades, she’s just curious. Can’t you at least say something without looking like you are going to murder her? Like I said, she might be willing to help.” Hadrian shied away from his sister. “I don’t care! We can’t trust her, Val! Or have you forgotten what she and the Gryffindors did to us and our family? Our family we lost...was because of them!” Hadrian wiped away the tears that were starting to form around the edges of his eyes. “If you don’t want me to do as I will with her, fine. We are taking her to the dungeons right now. Mother and father will know what to do with her.” Severus walked up to his son and firmly placed his hands upon his shoulders. “Don’t worry, Hades. Your father and I will deliver the proper judgement towards this girl.” Hadrian softly smiled at his mother, and turned that smile into a sadistic one towards the Gryffindor girl. “Thank you, mother. Let’s deliver our prisoner wrapped up like a gift. Some discomfort ought to be good for her.” He turned to the far corner in the room and spotted a giant pile of rope. He knew that was sufficient enough to tie his prisoner up. “Incarcerous!” he yelled, commanding the rope with his wand. He quickly tied the rope with his magic before the girl had the chance to object and struggle away. “You just enjoy making Gryffindors suffer, don’t you?” the tied-up girl sarcastically asked. “Yep.” Hadrian responded. He scooped up her magic sword from the ground and ushered the others out the door. Hadrian pointed his wand at the girl’s back and prodded her to keep moving, lest she wanted to be on the zapped end of the wand. Hadrian, his family, and his newfound prisoner walked out of the mysterious room and towards the dungeons, where the prisoner will be judged for her actions.
