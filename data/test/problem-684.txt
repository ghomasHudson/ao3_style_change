“Probably, but at least they will be gone.”
“Right here is fine,” Draco says, tapping on the glass divider.
Harry reaches underneath the duvet until he finds Draco’s hand and laces their fingers together. “I haven’t ruined it. I just need to say something important.”
“Your boyfriend is

“It’s the Greek alphabet. Seriously, Potter, have you been living under a rock?”
“Are you
Draco would have loved to agree.
He had to come clean and then wait for Potter to cut him off. Staying away would be so much easier if Potter didn’t surprise him at home all the time or invite him to parties.
“Yeah. Remember how he had it out for me then? They hate me.”
Tabitha looked over at Draco as the door closed with a snap. “Not exactly how I pictured my Saturday night.”
“Don’t forget we’ve got practice first thing tomorrow,” She-Weasley yelled after him. “We kick off at seven.”
And then it was over. The Minister let go of his hand and then Blaise was at his side not a second later, followed by most of the Weasley clan.
“Four
“Gavel,” Theo said, flipping through Blaise’s notebook like a magazine.
Draco breathed out heavily. “That was definitely one of the three main points she was mad about.”
“No,” Potter said as he took off the locket he had stuffed under his plaid shirt. He changed right back into his normal self.

It seemed that they were already getting started on that. There were no less than five owls perched outside his living room window and Draco spotted at least two Howlers.

that, for fuck’s sake?” Draco couldn’t take it any longer – he grabbed Harry’s wrist and pulled it away.
The Prophet opened in mid-air as he riffled through it. Some of the pages sailed to the floor, but Harry didn’t seem to care.
True to his character, Harry just ignored him and continued to completely spoil the dog.

She looked him up and down. “That’s what I want to know. It was hard enough to believe that Blaise is involved with Weasley now, but I

Draco pointed his wand at the lift and said “

“Preferably,” Draco said. “I would rather not be the one to break the news to your family. I have a feeling I’ll see
The wind was still howling around them, whipping cold, hard rain across their faces, but Draco didn't feel it. The only thing he felt was Potter's cold, lifeless wrist. And then there was something tapping against his fingers, barely palpable. Draco cast a stasis spell on Potter to prevent the possible damages their imminent jump could cause.
“Yes, Sir,” she said stiffly, dropping her towel into the bowl and walking out without looking at him.
mean? You already know I want to snog your stupid face off. And I thought maybe you do want the same thing after all. Just tell me no again so I can finally get over it.”
Blaise crossed the room in an instant and wrenched the door open, yelling, “They’re in the girls’ dormitory!” before walking straight into the invisible wall that went up every time a male tried to enter.
“I’m short a guinea pig,” Draco sighed, rubbing at his burning eyes.
Potter shook his head and got to his feet with some unwitting support from the hedge. “This stupid hedge stabbed me when I fell into it.”
When his vision finally cleared somewhat an eternity later, he was lying on the landing, looking up at that bastard. The snakes overhead glistened in the moonlight and something squirmed at Draco’s neck.
“What about my robes? I
The whole front page consisted of various photographs of Potter, mostly taken during Quidditch games and all of them showing him getting injured. The largest one was a loop of Dayal and Draco Disapparating with Potter. Draco took the newspaper from him and dropped it into the rubbish bin unceremoniously.
Potter gritted his teeth. “No,” he said irritably, “I don’t.”
“Yeah, you do. To be honest, it’s giving me really mixed signals. It’ll probably drive me mental any day now.”
Hogwarts – the only reason he had known her name at all had been her status as Gryffindor Chaser. And now he was at her birthday party, at her and George’s house. It was weird.

“Then think of it this way,” Draco said smoothly. “People will be so busy gawking at what’s going on here,” he gestured at Potter’s body, “they’ll completely forget to stare at what’s going on there.” He pointed at Potter’s scar. “Which is a lot.”

Draco was very proud of the enormous willpower he displayed by slipping under the covers and turning his back on the shiny box. He was equally disappointed when he sat up not five minutes later and snatched it up.
“Enough talk!” Harry said.
Odysseus was waiting outside Draco’s kitchen window and he didn’t look pleased when Draco rearranged the warding spells around him before opening the window and letting him in – not that Draco had expected him to. He guessed that Odysseus liked being at Draco’s house just as much as Draco liked having him there.

Harry squeezed him, as if that were a punishment. It definitely wasn’t.
“I’m pretty sure I said I wasn’t dating any of the girls.”
“It will only take a few minutes, half an hour at most,” said Draco calmly. “Just like last year, remember? When that Harpies’ Beater smashed your head in?”
Draco placed the cutlery on his plate and held it out to her. “I’m afraid you’ll have to go alone. I am incredibly sick.”
Harry was trembling under Draco’s hands, opening and closing his fists and effectively flexing his biceps at the same time. Merlin, how was it possible for Draco to get so hot and bothered again so soon?
when the Snitch was right in front of Harrington’s bloody face and he just let it go. Didn’t want to get hit in the face with one of those stupid wigs, I bet. So we got to freeze to death for two more hours!”

Harry grinned at him while Draco applied the paste to his chest. “Why would I go

Blaise pointed out a pretty blond guy and a rather muscular man with very broad shoulders. Yeah, Draco wouldn’t have turned down those two either.

.” Draco leaned back into his pillows and draped an arm over his eyes to keep out the light. “So, I guess I can read all about it in the Prophet tomorrow?”
“Can’t help it!” Harry handed Draco his cloak and then threw on his own jacket while adding, “I’ve got bridges to burn.”
One foot already on the first step, Draco turned around to see if Potter would be able to handle the stairs alone, and found him missing. Frowning, he turned around and went back into the kitchen. Potter was doing the dishes. By hand, for a lack of options.
, that was not what any of this situation was about!
“You can land now,” Draco said feebly, glad that they wouldn’t be able to hear him down below. Nivaria acted like she hadn’t heard him either.
Draco shook his head and turned a page, even though he hadn’t really checked it. It wasn’t like
Which is why all my ideas for other fics sit and wait while this fic is now actually 35,000 words longer than it was when I thought it was finished and started posting.

Draco tickled Aurelius between the ears, making his tail thump against the wood.

Although Draco’s eyes were firmly fixed on Potter, he barely saw him land in a half-run, his broom trailing behind him and the Snitch raised above his head. He thought he saw Potter shake the brawny girl’s hand, and how the other girl slunk away before he could turn to her next. Draco

Draco leaned over and snapped the box shut. Unfortunately, Harry managed to withdraw his fingers in time.

danced like he’d never done it before.
Draco was looking forward to meeting up with Harry and the others at the pub tonight. Even if they insisted on everybody wearing a costume. He was prepared. Well, almost.
“That one opens the door,” he yelled.
. No glamour and we meet him somewhere else.”
Potter was lying on his bed in Gryffindor Tower, staring at a parchment obsessively while Weasley was shooting him worried glances. How much time had he spent in front of that map?
At least his wand was still where it had been, tucked safely into his pocket. He took it out and summoned the Cloak.

Harry made an aborted noise that Felicity commented with a smug grin as she passed between them and strutted down the corridor and out into the night.

“You think people hate you – which is stupid – and that I do stupid things because of it. But I’ve always done stupid things, right?”

after all.
“You’re eighteen; you’re not going to grow anymore. That train left the station a long time ago.”
Harry grimaced. “Can’t. They’ve increased security. There’s no use trying Polyjuice, glamours, Disillusionment charms, Invisibility Cloaks or simple transfiguration. Even Animagi are forced to detransform when they cross the threshold.”
instead of Felicity.
It was dark when Draco woke up almost five hours later. He felt even more tired than before, and also very hot. He turned over to Harry’s side and found it empty. The only reward was the blinding headache that picked up at once. Draco groaned and closed his eyes again. They were burning as well.
“He’s a professional … er … footballer,” Draco said shortly, remembering Potter’s cover story. “I really need to ...”

“Not very talkative, is he?” As if Slughorn had even

eyes are grey,” Draco said, pointing from the vast grey area of the sweater to his own eyes and back again. “Also, the snake is Slytherin’s sigil.”
She was pointing at the picture on the very first page, which was the group shot they had taken the year before. Draco was wearing one of Harry’s Christmas sweaters (he hoped that the picture wouldn’t remind Harry to demand it back) and Harry had put an arm around Draco. They looked rather awkward.
Harry cleared his throat. Draco poked his side in warning.
The front legs of Potter’s chair made sudden contact with the ground again. The surprise that showed on Potter’s face made Draco seriously question whether he
At first, he didn’t know what he was seeing or where to look.
“I’m your whole PR team, Harry!” she said as soon as they stepped a foot into the kitchen. “It’s my job to know everything about you! How am I supposed to issue a statement in your name if I don’t know how you want to play this? Because you kept me in the dark?! I thought we had an agreement after the last time!”
According to his stopwatch, his doorbell rang exactly twenty-nine minutes later. Draco threw his book onto the table and went to open the door when he heard something unexpected – people talking at his front door.
on that thing, have you?” Potter said. “You’ll be sick before you even manage to sit down. Besides, people would definitely recognise us.”
Aurelius didn’t waste any time to join Draco in his armchair, effectively burying him. Draco didn’t mind. It felt like being covered with a heavy blanket, warm and comfortable. He closed his eyes and listened to the crackling of the fire Harry had lit.
hours of uninterrupted sleep. “Your body is getting used to the potion. How often did you take it unauthorised?”
“I am sorry, Tabitha,” Draco sighed. “I seem to have some more work to do today. Maybe another time?”
So, this is one of my favourite chapters :)
“Yeah, yeah, it shows every single person living here at Hogwarts.” Potter waved a hand in dismissal and then added, “And every single person
He would probably also roam the corridors from time to time, listen to the newest gossip, maybe spread some of his own. And if he ever came across Potter, he’d just turn invisible and see where he was headed… so he could flee in the opposite direction, and nothing else!
“I have an emergency!” Draco barked at the Welcome Witch, throwing his chart on her desk. “Get Nash to cover for me!”
“Malfoy –” Potter said tentatively, brushing away a dripping lock of hair that was sticking to his cheek. “Could you … leave the lights on? Just … just in case I wake up and want to … read …”
“Yes,” said Draco, snapping it shut demonstratively and placing an empty parchment on top of it. “But I’d like to hear it from you. Let’s just pretend I’m the first one to examine you.”
“Nineteen,” Ginny said. “And don’t act so surprised, you’ve got plenty of

“The cooling cabinet, of course. That’s what it does.”
“So, I’m assuming this is why you kept throwing chocolate at me?”
Cuffe trembled and dropped his wand to shield his nether region, which was just plain dumb. Harry summoned it immediately and put it into his back pocket.
Potter’s head followed Draco’s progression around the table. “Well, I’m glad I could entertain you with my inaptitude, at least.”
“Oh shit,” Weasley said, and there was a splashing sound, like he had dropped the cooking spoon into the pot.
“Muggle

Draco clung to the person blindly. They were stroking his back now and there was something soft tickling his face, smelling comfortingly of grass and earth and rain, like something that was

Spirits were low in their stands, which was why Blaise and Draco didn’t linger. They had just reached the exit when somebody called after them.
melody like he couldn’t care less about Charms.
hot, but you know me – I like a good fight.”
The boy next to her gave Draco a pitying look and unearthed a pair of headphones from his pocket, which the girl acknowledged with an envious look.
And then he was gone, leaving Draco to turn off the lights and lock the library.
Draco decided not to leave it to chance. Directly after showering, he gathered some of his homework and made himself comfortable on one of the leather couches. He even made some progress the first two hours, but he grew slightly nervous when half past ten rolled around and Blaise had still not returned. Also, Candace and her girls were still giggling over at the fireplace.
Potter grinned. “Guess you’re right. So, how about it?”
Harry took the newspaper and folded it neatly, eyes on Draco the whole time. “Edith
” Potter was on his feet in an instant. “We've got a match in three weeks! I can't miss that much practice!”
. What the hell was
In hindsight, Draco should have chosen a piece of Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum to hide his burning face. Instead, he let out an embarrassing squeak that made him blush even more, and then started to shiver violently for a whole five seconds during which Potter fanned his own face with the disembodied board of his current book. Draco wasn’t actually sure if it had been loose beforehand. He should probably avoid the library (and Madam Pince) for the weekend. Just to be safe. He’d definitely avoid Potter as well. Again.
Harry’s breath against his ear was shallow and ragged. “Alright?”
.” Draco could see Potter was going to disagree with him again, so he held up a hand to stop him. “You ripped that Snitch to pieces, it hit you in the head, you took a really nasty fall, broke your back and then you poodled around in St. Mungo’s for three weeks,” Draco summarised. “Oh, and also, you
“I just really
That was when he finally noticed Draco, and he announced it by breathing in noisily and slamming a hand against his chest. This time, he grimaced when the girl shushed him again.
The Snitch was almost within his reach and he stretched out a hand.
“Yes, you are. Now give me your Cloak, quickly.”
“Relax, Leo,” said Keeper Florence Mills. “They’d never let him play already if Stavros hadn’t cracked his skull on Friday.”
“Draco!”
“What’s that?” Draco asked, looking around.
Draco broke. He started crying, the pain travelling up from somewhere deep down inside his gut. It felt like his insides were trying to exit his body all at once, leaving him completely hollowed out. He couldn’t breathe.
The image of Olivia inside the wreck, unconscious and jammed in, made its way into Draco’s mind quite uninvited. He didn’t want to think about it – how he had just left her there in favour of Harry.
“You don’t say,” Draco said drily. “Well, you are wasting time I could use to help people who really need it. You are being unreasonable and
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco repeated. He took another bite, this one big enough to give him some time to think.
At the very last second, the Chaser veered off and nearly crashed into Robinson, who was dropping in from further up. She and Haynes were now flying in V-formation on either side of Harry, ready to beat off anybody who could be trying to stop him.
For one long, gut-wrenching second, Draco didn’t know where to start.
“Fix your clothes and let’s go.”
“Nothing. What does it look like?” Potter grumbled.
Armstrong pretended to gag.
It was awkward pretending not to know Harry as well as he did. They couldn’t exactly talk about their plans for the evening. Not that Draco was dumb enough to make plans on a match day – who knew if Harry would even be conscious at the end of it? But the potential was there.
When he came back down, feeling like a whole new wizard, Potter was in the middle of a complicated choreography that involved much wand waving. Draco sat down just as a plate landed in front of him. Spaghetti rose out of the pot like a snake and arranged itself on Draco’s plate, forming a perfect mound. Potter floated the sauce pot onto the table and then sat down as well.
tomorrow. Some seemed to have no use for their merchandise anymore and began throwing it at the Seeker.
“You mean your reputation as an unsociable hermit?”
Harry sighed and ruffled his hair absentmindedly. “Then where else are we supposed to go?”
“I tried to tell people for six years, remember? Didn’t work.”
. More like an awkward wobbly-legged shuffle.
“And ...?” Draco prompted.
If you’re going to re-read, I’d like to ask you not to point out foreshadowing for later events in earlier chapters. 😊 It would be nice if new readers could enjoy all of this without danger of getting spoiled in the comment section. You’re of course more than welcome to comment on foreshadowed events when they finally happen. 😉 I’m really curious to see what you guys pick up on!
Harry groaned. Draco knew not to take it seriously, because then Harry took his hand again and led him down the hallway to the staircase. “Come on, you can help me peel the potatoes.”
“Oh, yes you bloody well do. There you go arguing again.”
Harry took the scroll and read it, wand still pointed at the potatoes so they would scrub themselves in the sink. He cast a fleeting glance at Odysseus and grabbed a pen from the drawer to scribble his answer. He then handed the parchment back to Odysseus, but the owl lingered. Of course. Probably did it on purpose to show Draco who was boss.
He didn’t apologise, and Draco was glad. All of that was in the past, where it belonged, and Draco’s future was looking bright and
“What are you doing?” asked Harry suspiciously, his eyes never letting Draco’s wand out of sight.

Draco nodded and closed the door on them again. The rest was in Harry’s hands now.

just go away. I’m not in the mood today.”
Draco just nodded and went in. And this was why, once again, Draco was keeping vigil by Potter’s bedside, though he had to leave his wand outside this time.
“What do you think?” the Welcome Witch drawled. Then she added, without any real compassion, “Good luck.”
Hermione sighed. “But then you started investigating on your own. We’re not sure if he was aware before that night –”

remembered was talking about Potter’s Muggle ex-girlfriend – the one the Prophet had written about last year, earning their editor-in-chief a shrunken head courtesy of Potter – and then some stuff about old Italian women in yoga pants.
“Do you have any idea how much this memory would go for if Potter hadn’t been polyjuiced? Provided you weren’t such a prude and would actually share the whole experience,” Draco said gleefully.
Draco followed his gaze. His mugs were, indeed, on the floor in front of the couch. He had been so absorbed in his reading that he hadn’t even noticed.
“I trust
“Where’s that other song? The weird one from last time?”
“Won’t be long until Harry earns himself a Bat-Bogey,” Weasley said with a chuckle. “Good thing I brought my Omnioculars.”
“Potter!” said Draco firmly.
Alright, enough about me, let’s get back to better things. 😊 I hope you’re happy with the ending our boys got!
“Or I could just find her and threaten her,” said Harry hotly.
There was silence for a second.
“Yep,” Lauren said, sliding some money over the counter just as Harry did the same.
And suddenly, Harry was speeding up, zigzagging through a crowd of Chasers, eyes fixed on the Snitch. He was only a few feet away when a Bludger appeared to his left, shooting right at him. Harry’s head whipped around, but instead of swerving to his right or even up or down, he made a left, barrelling directly into it.
Draco staggered to his feet, fuelled by extreme hatred, and hissed, “Don’t you

Draco could tell by their approaching footsteps, interrupted whenever they reached another door that needed to be charmed open.
Draco snapped his book shut and placed it on top of his reject pile. Let Pince deal with some of his rubbish.
“I’ve got something for you,” said Draco hesitantly. “For emotional support.”

Granger sighed heavily. “If only he cared about his N.E.W.T.s half as much.”
. Like a robot,” Potter complained, sitting down at the kitchen island.
Harry shook his head and actually pushed Draco away by the shoulder. “I don’t want you to do something you’ll regret.”
“Stop,” Draco panted, but his voice was faint and at the same time the singer proclaimed,

“I’ve thought about it, and I definitely
” he muttered to himself, scrambling across the bed to gather up his clothes. Heart hammering in his chest, Draco watched as Harry’s shadowy form wriggled into his pants and trousers and then struggled so much with the buttons of his shirt that Draco had to lean over and slap his hands away so he could do it for him.
“Are you humming?”
“Well,” said Draco with half a grin. “I’d say
Now Draco was yelling, and that definitely wasn’t helping either. “It’s been six years! You fucking killed him! You-Know-Who’s
“You can ask me something, I suppose.”
Fresh air hit Draco’s lungs like a shock wave when all the weight was lifted at once. They let go of each other immediately and pushed themselves off the tilted bookshelf and through the mass of floating books until they reached the entrance to their little private section. At least all the shelves in the regular section were still standing.
“You want me to describe a move that I did ten years ago?” Truth was, Draco’s hand had slipped. Not that he would
Draco snatched it out of his hands and stuffed it under his mattress, which he then spelled to be glued to the bed frame. “Don’t flatter yourself,” he said coolly. “I only put that there this morning, and only because I couldn’t leave it on my bedside table, or Pansy would’ve set fire to it. I like my furniture. It’s antique.”
When Draco looked back up, Abrams had turned the Prophet around so Draco could see the article he had been reading, and Draco’s stomach fell through the floor.

“She was there with me,” said Harry in an unhappy voice. “She was erased from all pictures when we Obliviated her.”
“Aah,” said Bagman in a voice that suggested this was only a slight nuisance. “Yeah well, that can happen when you set off too many of these fireworks at the same time. Well, it certainly helps with visibility.”
“Was it the snake?” Potter asked carefully. Draco busied his trembling hands with stroking Aurelius' fur.
Draco shivered violently, nodded, and then, just in case Harry’s brain was just as fogged up as Draco’s, whispered, “Seems like it.”
Draco piled roast potatoes onto his plate without sparing Blaise a single look. If Blaise was waiting for praise or gratitude, he would still be here around dinner time. Draco had never asked him for

“I’ll have to take your word for it. So, you might have been a little distracted while you were flying home?”
There was a second of silence during which Draco tried to understand how Harry and Hermione could possibly be having a baby. Then she took Ron’s hand, who beamed at her and kissed the top of her head, and Draco was glad he’d held his tongue.
“So, he’s
Draco’s heart was beating rapidly by now. He certainly hadn’t expected her to come on to Harry after nearly having been murdered for that very thing, but Harry’s answer had come as an even bigger surprise.
Draco closed his eyes in resignation. “Tell me that’s not –”
Lauren shrugged and said with a straight face, “I like the straight ones.”
And here’s the second one for today. Wouldn’t be a celebration otherwise, would it? 😊 Also, we’ve officially crossed the halfway mark!

. “Just come back in an hour to check they haven’t kidnapped me.”
“Damn,” muttered Potter, even louder now, and then he slammed his palm against the book so hard that he completely drowned out the shushing of several people.
Then she pointed at Draco with her non-dominant hand. “Your wand please, Mr. Malfoy.”
Pansy looked after him as he strode away. She dropped down on the bench, a gleeful look on her face, and everybody in the vicinity immediately leaned in.
“I’ve got a snake!”
people to the best of his abilities. Draco never would’ve thought that any of his colleagues would be capable of doing this.
“It’s true. He pretended to like us when you were around, and we believed it too, at first. I guess he couldn’t keep it up forever.”

Harry groped at the coffee table for his wand. “That’s not even your eye, you moron. I thought you were supposed to know a thing or two about anatomy?”
Harry hid his grin behind his Cloak and grabbed his arm. “You’re almost as clueless as Arthur. It’s adorable. This is going to be
When Harry’s heart started beating again, it was almost imperceptible, but Draco didn’t wait to see if it would pick up. Harry had lost so much blood already and Draco wasn’t sure how the Muggles supplied him with more and if that system was still working now.
Draco wished that Harry had already left.
Even so, Draco was running low again, so he got right to that when he had picked up Aurelius after his morning shift and got to Grimmauld Place. He didn’t exactly know when they had started sleeping at each other’s place every single night or waiting there for each other, but Draco already felt out of place when he didn’t do it. He just needed to remember to touch his necklace when he came in, so Harry would know it was him and not some home invader.
“Malfoy, hey.” Potter lifted one hand in greeting and then immediately latched back on.
It didn’t take a genius to figure out that she was there to further investigate Draco’s part in the library set-up. He would have liked to tell her to take one of the countless empty seats surrounding them like a blast zone, but that would surely have been suspicious.
,” Draco said placidly, barely moving his wand.
Draco frowned down at his clipboard. “He’s not on here.”
Draco raised one eyebrow, which was sort of his go-to move if he wanted to mock someone. “
When Draco had been at his most desperate, she had been the only person there for him – not Pansy, not Blaise, not Theo, not any Slytherin at all – a Ravenclaw, a Muggle-born girl, somebody who had been killed over fifty years prior, and by the same monster Draco had pledged himself to, no less.
She hesitated for a second, taking stock of his furniture, and then smiled politely. “I’d rather not.”
“Sorry I’m such an insensitive arse,” Draco groaned. He tried to wriggle his wand arm free from where it was sandwiched between their bodies, but Harry seized it roughly.
Draco couldn’t understand what was said up in the air, but he could read the angry glare Harry gave Ashdown.
“And my research is on
“How could I possibly forget?” Potter sounded entirely too amused. “Bubble gum?”
Draco tried to ignore it as best he could. There were more important things right now.
. Not in public, of course – Draco only ever ballroom danced in public, and this was definitely not that kind of music – but still! There was a definite spring in his step. Merlin help him.
“Meaning,
be too careful and he wasn’t going to risk anything because of a malfunction.
Draco hurriedly changed into his navy-blue healing scrubs and then entered surgery. A mediwitch had already vanished Potter's clothes, applied the disinfecting spells and put him in a hospital gown.
It took Draco a second to orient himself.
Potter shrugged and swallowed after chewing an unsatisfactory total of three times. “One summer, I practically only ate cake for every meal. Grew a good two inches.”
Ginny Weasley was sitting between Draco and Blaise, entertaining all of them with her account of the match, when somebody put a hand on Draco’s and her shoulder. Draco looked up at Potter, who was now trying to squeeze between them.
All the candles had gone out, but the enraged look on McGonagall’s face was clearly visible in the light of the full moon. Draco half wished the books had crushed him instead. With a flick of her wand, the books floated to the ground, gently this time. Another flick, and all the lamps came on at one.
Pansy patted Draco where his wrist was just poking out of his pocket, and said sweetly, “I’ve got fifteen Galleons riding on you two fighting it out before Christmas and an extra five on both of you ending up with Pomfrey.”
is wearing sheets. I’d say that’s weird.”
Draco just shook his head, forcing her to let go.
” somebody yelled. “Open up! I know you’re in there!”
He pulled the man away from the desk by his arm. She just glared at him and muttered something about rewarding rude behaviour under her breath. Draco led the man into the next empty examination room and closed the door behind them.
Draco flipped the magazine open and rifled through it until he found the same photo again. The caption read
. Who brings a briefcase to a
Potter was sitting on his bed, his back leaning against a post at the foot of it. The lower half of his body was still invisible, but he had loosened his tie. “Took you long enough.”
It was like she was suddenly a completely different person. She straightened her shoulders, which put her chest on display quite effectively, and gave him a confident smile.
Potter wasn’t deterred by this. “I’m First Seeker. That means he wants me to seek first, right?” he said confidently.
“Yeah, well, you speak Muggle.”
“It seems that Potter is suspended for the next three matches.” Bagman sounded numb, like this personally affected him.
” Harry agreed. “I’ll tell her you called her that.”
Draco watched as she examined Harry thoroughly and diagnosed a small fissure of the left clavicle in addition to the obligatory concussion.
Potter glared at him and said, “Would you
Potter looked rather distracted, a laborious expression on his face.
“Since
If Potter thought Draco would just heal him and let him be on his way, he was wrong. Draco wanted an explanation, even if it was sure to make him wish he hadn’t asked.
The levitating spell slipped from Draco’s mental grasp and the book fell open with a sickening squelch as it hit the table. All three edges of the book were dyed a rusty brown and the blood had even soaked onto the pages, leaving only a tiny untouched area in the middle. Draco wasn’t going to check if all the pages were as damaged as these two.
It really was incredible how she could retain her upbeat attitude through all of it, though Draco guessed that it helped that she didn’t remember anything about the accident and the official cause was now a burst tire and not a wrong split-second decision on her end.
– Yeah, that was more like it. Whatever that meant. He’d take more of these nonsense ones. Better than the heart-touching stuff.

“Draco!” Hermione sounded scandalised. “Don’t call them
“Why did you ask me to come here? I hadn’t pegged you as a fan of Muggles.”
It was incredibly loud. People were singing and screaming and using their stupid fanfares. They weren’t setting off fireworks anymore, but the damage was already done. The storm obviously wasn’t about to die down anytime soon.
“The Book!” Harry sounded very excited and pulled him onto the bench with a little too much force, so that Luna fell off at the other end of it. “Every year, Olivia and Lauren put together an album of photos.”
He didn’t even hear Potter hum in agreement.
Pansy was sitting on the edge of her seat. “What does that mean?”
Draco sighed and stroked the bit of Harry’s hair that he could reach. It was completely wet, but Draco didn’t even care. He was used to much worse.
Then there was one of Potter, still years younger than he was now, with a small boy in his arms. The child had fair skin but Potter's messy hair and bright green eyes. Draco supposed he would have heard if Potter had a son, but maybe not? Maybe they had kept it a secret to protect it? But then again, he didn't think Weasley would display a picture like this if that were true.
. Then the door swung open on Harry’s side and he was out in an instant. Draco didn’t linger either.
Nash’s face reappeared and Draco sank back onto his back slowly. She was examining his face closely, so he raised an eyebrow.
“It’s not all of them, just the backwards ones. And we don’t

Draco took a step back and crossed his arms, glad that he had had the forethought to get dressed before facing Harry. Doing this in pyjamas or even half-naked would have been impossible.
“I know,” Harry whispered against his ear. “Just come back to me, please.”
He needn’t have worried about that. Potter squinted at him sleepily and then grabbed him and pulled Draco into bed next to him, hooking both arms and legs around his body like he was the Giant Squid. Draco tried to get away, but this only made Potter latch onto him even more.
But what if this son of a witch decided to ambush Harry in Draco’s stead? What if he managed to get rid of all the evidence, vanish into obscurity again? Draco couldn’t leave Harry while this bastard was still on the loose.
“Nice of you to notice,” Potter said, and then he leaned over and stole the last of Draco’s cake.
The whole house shook violently as a wave of raw power crashed over them and the doppelganger was smashed against the ceiling.
, Draco couldn’t take this, standing sideways on one single step with both feet at once, and his knees all weak like that.

Draco nearly gave himself whiplash with the speed his head shot up. “What are you talking about?”
“So … your advice would be to not do that?”
Harry turned to look at him, eyes wide with horror. His still bare shoulder was heavily bruised already, and Draco seemed to have failed to fully shield his face, because his lip was split open. Draco looked himself down, registered his dishevelled and ripped clothes and the series of paper cuts all over his hands, and felt like reclaiming his place underneath the wreckage of books.
“That’s oddly specific,” Harry said, sounding a little more awake.
Tessa clapped her hands and dragged Marc into a weird side-hug that took place all over the table and nearly knocked over Draco’s cup. Draco rescued his mobile and leaned back to watch them.
There was a second during which several people yelled and then Draco cut every single tube and wire that Harry was hooked up to with a

starting a few inches above the knees. He could have gone a lifetime without knowing that there was a long scar on his right thigh. There was a second one on his left forearm, and unlike Draco, Harry hadn’t even bothered to hide it with a spell.
“Do you honestly think your kissing skills made me sick?”
Greyson had written to tell him off, of course. Signing Mills off for two weeks because of a cracked skull was apparently ‘excessive’.
Also, Draco
Though Draco was by no means an expert on house-elves, he still knew that Potter was a moron, who had no idea how regular house-elves worked. Next he would offer Kreacher a change of new clothes or something equally barmy. As it was, Kreacher’s lower lip was trembling dangerously.

He had not seen Potter play since their time at Hogwarts and he had to admit that he was more than just a little curious. Having seen Potter’s health record, he almost couldn’t imagine Potter had gotten any better. Strictly speaking, all of the Falcons had abnormally large files, which, in his opinion, was not exactly a testament to their flying abilities.

The assembled Slytherins didn’t look much better than him. Some of the younger ones, who were sitting on the floor, kept nodding off against each other. Pansy was using the down time to apply her make up with the help of a small mirror, which was floating in front of her.
“I’ve got it,” Nash appeared at his side, clearly just starting her shift. Her hands were still busy gathering all her hair on top of her head. “I just overheard two of the mediwitches talking about a

any more. He definitely knew and Draco didn’t need to say it again.
But just as they approached the back door, it opened. Both of them stopped to watch Potter, who was leaning against the door frame with his eyes closed, taking shallow breaths. He was unnaturally pale and his hair was sticking to his forehead.
“Alright, wish me luck,” Potter said, getting up. He pointed his quill at the map and said “Mischief managed,” which wiped it clean.
Draco looked up sharply, right at Potter’s stupid lopsided grin. That son of a witch!
The box landed on top of Draco’s book, and he frowned first down at it and then up at Potter, who merely shrugged, both hands now buried in his pockets.

would have been determined enough to go through with it.
Her eyes lingered on the neglected hair on his head, the tattered trainers on his feet. Draco wouldn’t be surprised to hear they were the very same Harry had worn all throughout his run from the Dark Lord.
He was weak and all he could think about was how Harry squirmed underneath him as Draco trailed kisses down his neck, and the way his skin tasted. Harry was panting already, stroking his back and hair. His hands weren’t cold anymore, which meant that he was definitely turned on.

. Maybe we can make them pay her some money as well, to help with accessible housing and the sort.”
Draco’s eyes stayed on her aura as he answered, quite indifferently. “I know who he is, if that’s what you mean.”
She filled him in on the way downstairs. “He’s not exactly cooperating, so we don’t really know. A Bludger hit his head and they healed his skull on location, but he woke up when he got here and since they took off his gear it’s been a real mess.”
“Coach,
All of them turned to look at him. Weasley seemed dumbfounded. Pansy looked slightly betrayed. Draco leaned forward so he wouldn’t have to see it anymore. The fourth group was in the air already, and three of them were actually not all that bad. In the end, nobody commented on the fact that Draco had just talked to Granger, and they were silent for several minutes.
Harry threw his hands up in mock despair, nearly flinging Draco’s hand in his own face. “Will you
“You’re insane.”
He only got a short glimpse at Harry, who stood pressed against the wall, shield shimmering around his body and one hand outstretched in Draco’s direction, as if to push the water as far away as possible. Which he had apparently just done. Then the shower curtain, still attached to the rod, came back down from behind Draco, enveloping him in a very wet embrace.
“The whole school heard about that.”

pleased to hear that their tinkering would continue into the new year.
Why wasn’t Harry at the hospital?
Draco looked at Aurelius fondly, who was now splayed across Potter’s lap. “He was training to be a service dog for the neighbours’ daughter, but failed miserably. He knows all the tricks, but he just does them whenever he feels like it,” Draco explained. “So, I took the loser in.”

Samantha groaned, elbowing him in the ribs. “Thanks for reminding me. You are a

“I don’t
“Because I’m not wearing my glasses! You can’t hold that against me.”
Draco Disapparated as soon as he reached the corner of the street outside Mungo’s, reappearing in front of the arena. He’d been thirteen years old the last time he had been here, but he still remembered where the entrance for important (and in the Malfoys’ case: rich) witches and wizards was. He made a dash for the stairs and was immediately thrown back by an invisible shield.
Draco took out the insulated food container and spelled it back to its original size. Granger and Weasley exchanged a significant look that Draco couldn’t read.
The final kick in the teeth came when Draco returned, wearing his most proper pyjamas (just in case), and found a Chocolate Frog waiting for him on his bedside table. Potter must have put that there while Draco had still been hiding behind his curtains.
“Please, as if that’s a challenge.” Potter scoffed, walking over to Draco’s kitchen area. “You gave Blaise unrestricted access. All I had to do was use his Floo.”
“Wait, so you
Harry laughed and looked himself down. “Well, this is actually a
Draco snorted. “You earned yourself at
And they left it at that.
“Enough chit-chat.” He finally pulled the paper from his pocket and held it out with a flourish. “This is the reason I had to wait an extra one and a half hours for Potter to leave the library last night.”
“What the hell is your problem?!” Harry’s teeth were clenched tightly, and even though Draco was fairly certain that Harry would never draw his wand on Muggles, he was kind of relieved that he didn’t have it there with him. “I wasn’t planning on fucking off until you came along.”
Granger’s voice was several octaves higher now. “Some of our best friends are Muggles. My
“What are you
“What?”
Harry moved the chair as close to the bed as possible and dropped down heavily.
“There’s a twig in your hair,” Draco muttered finally, pulling it out. “Really completes the look. You were going for ‘bird’s nest’, right?”
Samantha shot him a look that said she thought he was mental. “Never in a million years. Once the game starts, you can’t exchange any of the players. Matt won’t just dismiss their Seeker; they could just as well give up.”
Yes, Potter was at fault, just as Draco blamed him for the bruise on his back, where he’d slammed into the tunnel wall due to Potter’s less than stellar Apparating the day before. (It hadn’t been
Draco flinched. Harry fixed the briefcase with a determined look. Nothing happened.
She shook her head and smiled again. “You know, Harry ... everything that’s happened has got me thinking. I –” She took another very deep breath. “I’d like to try again.”
, of course).
gave me?”
, Prof.”
“She ... what? I thought she wanted nothing more to do with you?”
Draco knocked over his ink bottle, which spilled half of its content all over Theo’s Defence essay before Harry righted the bottle. Swearing under his breath (and earning himself an appalled look by Pince), Draco used his wand to siphon the parchment clean, but a blueish tinge remained.
“Draco, be sensible. Don’t you see what’s happening?” Her voice was silent but captivating. “Somebody just tried to murder you a second time. It’s all because of
The Snitch slapped against Potter’s outstretched hand and bounced off as he failed to grab it.
“Somebody catch him!” Bagman boomed.
Harry grinned at him. “That’s cute. You think I have a license.”
“Yeah, so?”
“Well, we
“He fell of his broom,” Draco took over. “He was approximately thirty feet up when he first fell and probably already unconscious then. He was halted circa twenty feet from the ground and then fell the rest unchecked. No vital signs on first contact, unresponsive to first revival, faint pulse after second joint resuscitation. Head lac and multiple fractures of the legs, arms and ribs.”
“I thought you said the wings were evidence?”
The three men exchanged wary glances and nobody stepped forward.
, you know? I’m just saying, I wouldn’t mind.”
Harry looked up at him with a frown. His fingers twitched slightly and Draco could feel the tip of his wand, hidden inside his sleeve, pressing against Draco’s ankle. Draco nodded just the tiniest bit and Harry smiled back way too enthusiastically for someone who was supposed to be
“Unless, of course, you’d rather punish Healer Malfoy for saving my life. That’s up to you, really.” Potter crossed his arms as Draco shot him a confused glance.
“You can’t be serious!” Ginny’s voice was as cold as ice. “He saved Harry’s life.
“No other team will be able to sign you for the rest of the season.”
“Oh no – don’t worry, he’s alright!” Draco quickly elaborated. “He’ll pull through …”
And now she was grinning broadly, giving Harry a very smug look as she dropped down to one knee in front of Teddy.
“New Year’s Eve. Was that
“I'm never getting up again,” he groaned, leaning the back of his head against the seat.
Draco didn’t wait around to find out. Once again, he found himself at a dead end, and as soon as those guys were level with him, he’d lose his chance to Disapparate. He concentrated hard on his memory of Harry’s room (it had been so messy that it had practically burned itself into his retinas) and twisted.
He turned around and, his stomach dropping, saw the silver stag galloping towards him.
Draco nearly dropped his wand, which he had been using to polish the chandelier that cast the upstairs sitting room at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place into flickering light.
Harry took him by the hand and pulled him into the adjoining shower room. Draco only noticed how cold he was when the usually tepid water hit his skin. Harry started at the top, washing the blood out of his hair carefully. Draco closed his eyes and let it happen.
Draco leaned back and spread his arms. “Just get it over with. Hit me.”

“My condolences,” Draco said. “But that doesn’t change the fact that you’re
“That didn’t count. We both know Granger made you do it.”
Potter scoffed. “Why would a
, Draco would’ve contemplated Obliviating any witnesses right then and there, but Potter just laughed and brushed the sand off his hands and trousers, like he didn’t even care that his childhood nemesis had watched him do that.
Draco’s first instinct was to shake Potter until he woke up, but that would certainly result in a broken nose at the very least. So he held himself back and instead cast a Calming Charm over Potter. His whole body relaxed visibly and only a strained frown remained on his face.
Harry joined him in the kitchen a few minutes later and started on their late lunch. They were silent for a few minutes, Harry concentrating on his cooking spells and Draco pretending to be able to read his notes.
Well, Draco definitely wasn’t cold anymore.

“I’ve got to go with them. It’s the sensible thing to do.”
Harry took a few deep, hasty breaths and then started coughing heavily. Draco groaned and pushed himself off the floor with both arms.
“I’ve got a feeling that Dayal guy doesn’t like you very much,” said Blaise casually. “He wouldn’t allow more than one person in here at a time.”
“Nobody is

to do it. He embraced Potter, squeezing him tightly. He told himself it was to convey a sense of security, but part of it was definitely to ensure that Potter had no room to punch Draco in the face. Potter tensed up for a moment, taken by surprise, and then hugged him back just as fiercely.
Draco shook his head automatically (because honestly, he hadn’t done anything that would warrant such a reaction) and put the kettle on for something to do.
Harry, who was sitting cross-legged at Draco’s feet, gritted his teeth.
“Did you tell Hermione about this?” Potter asked suspiciously, as if that was the only explanation for Weasley to advise against this whacky endeavour.
“Well, Oliver Wood was just the same. Quidditch always came first; that’s how it is. And Matt played professionally himself. He was a really good Chaser before the war. So it’s no wonder he’s a

A crooked grin spread across Harry’s face. “So, you wouldn’t have worn the colour I like on you if you’d known I’d

away.”
Draco cast the aura spell and then raised his eyebrows at Harry.
And then she raised her hand in a flash. Draco thought she was going to slap him, so he brought up both arms to cover his face like Lauren had shown him.
“Charms!” Potter said exasperatedly, rummaging through the top drawer of his bedside table. “I can’t find my wand either. Or my glasses! Why didn’t you wake me earlier, Ron?”
One thing was certain: he would never accept one of Harry’s bets again.
, had they really planned the attack on the Order just last year? That couldn’t be right, could it? It felt like a lifetime ago.
They spent the afternoon in the sitting room again. Draco was reviewing his notes, searching for a revelation, but there did not seem to be one. Maybe he would have to find another Healer to partner with? Then Draco could act as the test subject and his colleague could do the spells.
Harry gave him a fleeting glance and turned sideways in the armchair, letting his legs dangle over one armrest and leaning his head against the other.
Draco tried to remember what he’d felt when Harry had Apparated him to the Burrow and everybody had been waiting for him.
He hadn’t cried in years, not even when his parents had disowned him. He thought he
“You know exactly who we’re talking about.” Even with his back turned, Draco could hear Tessa point a finger at him. “We warned you about him.”
“Maybe I was a little drunk.”
Potter sighed, and closed his book, and looked at Draco with his forehead creased and his eyebrows drawn together. It reminded Draco of the look his mother gave him on the rare occasion she had to deny him something – the pet dragon he’d wanted for his seventh birthday, for example, or for her to make everything alright again shortly before his seventeenth. Sorrow, and a plea for him to understand.
But Harry just looked at him over his shoulder and clicked his tongue. Then he laughed, jerked his head at a building and promptly entered the pizza place.
Draco soon realised the Falcons knew
Harry ruffled his hair and leaned back before Draco could retaliate. “Now you’re just making up words, Malfoy.”
did Draco have to go for somebody that was so impulsive? His life had been a lot less crazy before Harry had decided to squeeze his way into it.
The answer came almost immediately. “We'll meet some friends and do a pub crawl. It's a Muggle tradition. It’ll be fun.”
He wasn’t as pale anymore and his hair had turned a darker blond. His face looked slightly familiar and completely different at the same time.
“I’ll probably behave exactly like that again,” Harry said. “Full disclosure.”
Potter was focused on his backpack, but his feet seemed to be able to find their way on their own. They entered another street with even more picket fences when Potter finally withdrew his arm and offered Draco the music string and a Chocolate Frog.
Draco forced himself to hold on tighter instead. If he let go now, it would be entirely because of his upbringing. Agreeing to take Harry home wasn’t the same as agreeing to everything else, and he could still decide about that when they were there.
night, miles apart.”
Potter pressed his back into the seat, trying to create some distance. “He just needs to face his fear for once, then he’ll see how stupid it really is.”
Draco
Draco sat very still, trying not to alert Harry to the fact that he was still stroking his arm. Pathetic as it was, he was willing to prolong this for as long as he could.
Draco rolled his eyes as blatantly as he could and placed the thing in his ear with utmost care. Potter hit another button.
“I’ll just …,” muttered Draco in between kisses, searching his toga’s magic pocket. “Just making sure …”
He swore and begged and cried and when that didn’t help, he sat down on the floor next to the door and kept watch.
“They’ll live,” Draco added.
Potter shrugged. “What can I say? I am an optimistic person.” When Draco raised an eyebrow, he quickly added, “I am determined to
“You’re lying,” Potter said, narrowing his eyes. “Stop pulling my leg.”
“We’ll be waiting outside,” said Hermione carefully.
Draco got up slowly and almost tripped over the three pairs of shoes that stood in front of his bed. Maybe it was only the Patronus, but Draco wasn’t really cold, so he left them standing and opened the door.
Aurelius shot past him and took the lead downstairs. Then followed Draco at a much slower pace, and Harry’s Patronus brought up the rear. It was reassuring to know there was somebody close by, even though – logically speaking – the Patronus wouldn’t be able to catch him if he fell and he would probably flatten Aurelius.
as big as that stupid scar, but you need to listen when the professionals tell you not to do something as whacky as Apparating a wounded person while under the influence of Confunding Concoction!”

Draco picked up the pace automatically – because the alternatives were to either have his arm ripped out of its socket or do an epic faceplant, and he wasn’t partial to either – and stumbled along after the stranger. Who was

know.”
“I was in Gryffindor with Potter.”
“Shame,” whispered Potter. He seemed to be holding his breath. “That could’ve been you.”
Potter was wearing his black, close-fitting Quidditch gear, sans the grey-and-white robe. His trackies had grass stains all over them and his hair was just ridiculous – like he had just fallen from his broom and tumbled all over the pitch. He was still wearing his arm guards and the left one had two very odd holes in it, like the leather had been etched away.
The security trolls grunted menacingly and stomped over to them, dragging their clubs across the cobblestones. Whether that was to elicit fear or because they were just lazy, Draco couldn’t say. What he knew was that they added to the already considerable level of noise, creating the perfect cover for Harry.
They were at the exit now. Draco reached for the door.
fancy wasn't here. Blaise was right – Draco was in desperate need of getting laid.
“I changed my mind,” said Draco. “It’s better if you talk to somebody.” His badge grew hot all of a sudden and Draco instinctively plucked it from his scrubs so he could read the message.
“You mean the one you died at?” Draco said pointedly.
Draco sighed contently. “See? I get along just fine even without a Patronus. Also, it’s
“Naturally, how could I forget that there is a superstar amongst us on a regular basis?” Olivia commented, barely supressing laughter. She gestured at the sweater Draco was wearing, crimson with a golden lion. “Do they sell those sweaters too?”
Draco turned back to Harry, who seemed blissfully oblivious of what had just happened. “Alright, what do you want to tell me?”
Yawning deeply, Draco pulled the hood of his cloak over his head and went down the street until he finally reached the spot from where he could Apparate home. For a second, he felt way too tired to do it, but then a few drops of rain dripped from his hair and down his back, and Draco shivered violently. He pulled his hood down low over his face, took a deep breath to gather his strength and twisted.

“Traitor!”
It was because Potter was still an idiot, no matter how bearable he had become.
normal than Potter. “And she believed that?”
Well, that certainly explained why she had insisted on the distance between their beds.
Ron flinched slightly and pressed the button again.
, obviously. But that doesn’t mean we didn’t deserve to win!”
“Did Malfoy say anything?” Granger and Weasley said in unison. Draco had a feeling that Granger was genuinely asking. Weasley, on the other hand, seemed to be teasing her, if the chastising look sent his way was any indication.
wearing his pants?”
“Pretty sure you already did that, when you told me that this was not a date,” Harry replied, raising an eyebrow. “Don’t worry, I’d like to think you’re not that person anymore. I wouldn’t have let you into my home if there was any doubt about that.”
Harry frowned. “I wanted to be, but you didn’t exactly pick the best memory to fall into. Seems like punishment enough.”
He took out his wand and pointed it at his ears. It was the hardest healing Draco ever had to do – he could barely keep his wand steady, and he felt the strength leave his body as his eardrums mended at an alarmingly slow rate.
Even from behind him could Draco see that Harry felt incredibly guilty. His shoulders were drawn all the way up and he replaced the glasses hastily, holding up both hands as if to show her he was unarmed.

Olivia laughed and then handed him the gift-wrapped package that was sitting in her lap. Lauren embraced him next and then followed after Olivia, who was already making her way over to the sitting room.
“Because it's pathetic,” Blaise said, gesturing at him with his glass. “So which shifts did you get?”
“Is that so?” Draco flicked his wand, clearing the floor of broken glass. “Let's see it then.” He gestured at the window. “It's rather stuffy in here, isn't it? You should probably let in some air.”
“Pretty much,” Ron said.
“This isn’t a ploy to steal my wand, is it, Potter?” Draco said quietly, desperate for anything to say, struggling to keep his head above water.
Left? What did that mean …? They couldn’t mean … they

relationship certainly wasn’t a secret. Draco had heard them going at it in the on-call room often enough.
“I’m not stupid, Potter. Last time you just pressed a button and we could listen to it again.”
He placed his briefcase on his lap, took out a thick folder and opened it in the middle of the table. On top was a handwritten list consisting of dates and then a few keywords.
“Well, I wouldn’t mind Easton Haynes,” she said, sighing deeply like she was already imagining herself with the Beater. “But of course I’d have to choose someone from a different team, so maybe Ethan Sherwood?”
Potter put out a hand, as if to feel for his magic. His brows furrowed as he whispered under his breath – nothing happened. His frown increased. “I can’t feel it.”
” It definitely sounded more like a question.
As soon as the two Slytherins were on their feet, Granger and Weasley shot up as well. They rounded the table hastily and dragged Harry to his feet, who was still clasping his neck. His friends got on either side of him and escorted him out of the Great Hall, apparently trying to shield him from views.
“Tessa and Marc.” Draco shook his head at him. He vaguely registered that Marc let go of his shoulders. “Honestly, Potter, how do you even function?”
Draco didn’t know how long it took until he was breathing right again. Harry didn’t make him talk about it but kept stroking his hair and back for a while. Then he got to his feet and helped him up. He tugged at Draco’s scrubs just so. They weren’t wet anymore, but sticking to his body.
Odysseus was still in the kitchen when Draco came back, glaring at him as usual. Draco took the pantry quill and wrote an answer, assuring Matthew Greyson that Potter would be up and about in approximately three weeks and therefore not be able to play against Puddlemere on the sixteenth.
“Psht,” made Potter, grabbing both his forearms without his approval and pulling him up.
“Well, you know my brother’s Seeker for the Tornados. Let’s just say, when people start talking about
“My leg went to sleep. Maybe because you’ve been
“That’s his jacket right there,” she said, pointing at it hanging on a hook at the wall.
She then did the corresponding hand gesture and turned with a flourish that would have looked magnificent if she had been wearing a robe. The front door snapped shut a few seconds later, leaving them in total silence.
is entirely my point, Potter. You can’t just go around assaulting people because they looked at you funny. This is not healthy behaviour. You are out of control.”
“No need, we can manage.” Olivia gave Harry a very pointed look.
But when Draco stepped out onto the backstreet a minute later, his doppelganger was long gone. Only a faint trail of blood indicated the spot from which he had Disapparated and Draco screamed in frustration.
Potter looked at him for a second, searching for …
“Where’s Aurelius?” Blaise said, probably to change the subject.

“Eh,” said Harry.
“That’s fair. So why did you tell Ginny that you weren’t upset because of Slughorn?”
no fan of him either, are you?”
He went over to where Ginny was playing a game of butterbeer pong with some of Bill's former classmates.
“The Prophet is going to hate that,” said Draco with grin. “That you are choosing the

“I bet on the 18
“Potter, you can’t keep a deadly serpent as your
“Erm … so …,” she said, glancing at Harry only briefly and then avoiding to look at him again. “How did you like your first match?”
“To accompany you to the Wizengamot.” Ron handed him a bag. “I went to your house and got you some of your clothes, so you’d better get dressed. You can use the showers first.”
“Excuse me,” said Ginny, and then she followed after Harry.
Potter, on the other hand, was completely calm. “What’s your suggestion? Are we supposed to just show up on the street where everybody can see?”
He gestured down at the photograph of Harry and him on the air mattress, fully clothed but with their faces just inches apart and their legs entangled.
He opened his eyes just in time to catch Harry looking over his shoulder at Blaise and Ginny, who were exchanging confused glances with each other.
“Think I’ll pass,” Harry replied with a shrug. It was one thing to have a few sweaty nights with various attractive betas but another to start entertaining an omega who simply wanted to get their claws in before anyone else did.
made that our rule.”
“Maybe Greece,” Katie hummed thoughtfully, “Nick’s got an aunt in Thessaloniki. Then again, I quite like the U.K. during the summer, it’s the winters I can’t stand, so perhaps we should postpone it for when we can both get time off work.”
“Would it help if I told you what I would like to do to you?” Harry asked before Draco nodded. “Well, first I’d like to scent you, I think it might help you feel more comfortable. Then I would love to hold your cock in my hand, just like I did with your breasts. I want to massage you and get you nice and swollen, maybe take you in my mouth –“
“Pregnant or not though,” Ron began through a spray of crumbs, “he’s still an unmated omega and the only one living in the annexe at that.”
“You’re doing really well Draco,” Harry said earnestly, “So good.”
“I see,” Professor McGonagall visibly relaxed. “I was worried how you might react, given some of the incidents that have happened over the years.”
“Have you told Sirius and Remus?” Ron asked as Harry pulled a face. He had already sent a letter to his godfathers that morning via owl. He vaguely remembered they were Indonesia right about now and wasn’t sure what time the post would arrive.
!” one of the women with a long plait and lip gloss exclaimed. “You mean, Harry’s…”
“Oh…” Harry made a small punched out noise as he stared across at Draco. “I um, is that from Olive’s? I haven’t seen that on you before.”
“You’ll be a part of the Weasley family soon I reckon,” Felicity snickered as Hermione coloured and rolled her eyes.
Plus, having the bond bite had finally made the more vocally critical students leave Draco alone, although Harry’s fierce displays of protectiveness had certainly done the trick as well.  Draco knew that most of his peers had believed Harry would never bother to bite him and were now desperately trying to figure out how Draco had achieved it.
“Right,” Severus snapped loudly a moment later, clearly back to his old self. “I’m about to mix hydra bile and giant’s toe so unless you want to turn up to your wedding ceremony bald, I suggest you leave me to work in peace.”
“Yes,” Draco hissed, arching his long neck and exposing the pale column of his throat as Harry felt a particularly tight knot start to loosen and dissipate.
“Right then,” Harry said, “How about a tree?” He focussed on an empty patch before suddenly a large dark spruce appeared, towering over them.
“You do?” Draco looked up, his eyebrows knitted together in surprise.
“It’s kicking!” Draco gasped, his hand splayed across his belly. Harry looked down and stared at Draco’s bump for a moment as he stabilised himself.
I do then you are sorely mistaken. I would blame it on the fact that you are still a teenager but then again, I’ve never seen Draco act like this.”
Draco had been guiltily relieved when Ginny had announced she wouldn’t be returning for the rest of the diploma course at Hogwarts. Having signed with the Harpies, she apparently didn’t want to wait too long to make her start in professional quidditch.
Harry grinned apologetically, “It doesn’t hurt does it? It should go down in a few minutes now.”
“Ah – sweetheart, careful with your teeth,” Harry hissed, quickly squeezing the back of Draco’s neck as the other boy blanched and jerked back.
“Oh fuck,” Harry stated bluntly as it became horribly apparent what was happening. Even though Harry didn’t have a clear picture, given that Draco’s bump was in the way, he could clearly guess that Draco was pleasuring himself. The omega’s breath was coming in small, damp starts, punctuated by stuttered whines and his arm was jerking erratically. “Oh fuck, sweetheart, wait. I’ll leave,” Harry said urgently, trying to move as Draco tipped to one side and let out an upset noise.
“You’d know all about cults,” Sirius spat, puffing himself up.
“Oh I can’t buy this dress now,” Draco looked surprised.
“I know,” Katie laughed, “but honestly, we want about five.”
“Quite frankly, I don’t give a rat’s arse what people think,” Harry snapped. “It’s my own bloody business.”
In the picture, Lucius and Narcissa were holding hands, smiling at the camera and looking oddly more formal than Draco had ever seen his mother.
“I was,” Harry shrugged, “but Hermione sent me a patronus to say you were sick.”
“No, I was just wondering if you might take a look at these?” Draco nervously held out the forms before Severus gestured for him to take a seat.
“What did you do to my sister now?” Ron sighed wearily. “Honestly if I have to sit through another Sunday roast as painful as the last one…”
“The guests right?” Harry nodded sagely as if he was thinking it over. “Perhaps you’re right, maybe we could get the guests to sit on the bikes instead of chairs?”
“You w-weren’t disappointed then?” Draco narrowed his eyes suspiciously as Harry’s heart fell. He should have known Draco’s omega might take his failure to bite as some sort of rejection.
Draco shifted happily on the bed, looking down at his knees with a small smile. No one else had ever been interested in the omega’s runic studies.
“Sorry mate,” Seamus winced. “I didn’t know.”
“Why?” Colum grinned. “Wanna warm me up?”
“Ronald, I’m starting to think we should only wheel you out at parties when we want all the guests to leave and go home for the night,” Hermione muttered darkly as Ron shifted sheepishly on the rocking chair.
Snape took a sharp inhale of breath and Harry could see his shoulders had risen up with tension.
Her, Ron and Harry were sat around a small corner table in the Hogshead, it was a quiet Monday afternoon and Draco was safely in his double Potions class back at school.
“You won’t tell anybody will you?” Draco asked, pulling a face.
“Too right,” Thomas snorted, “I gotta say Malfoy, I never knew you were hiding
“Awfully young though isn’t he,” Muriel pulled a face, “I never agreed with that Higher Education programme at Hogwarts you know, embarrassments like this were bound to happen. Makes you wonder how many of these ‘indiscretions’ that McGonagall woman sweeps under the carpet.”
“Did you see Caulderwell’s new ruthenium line?” Draco asked Katie, tugging gently on her sleeve. Harry zoned out somewhat as the two of them began excitedly discussing metallic properties. He hadn’t even realised there
day baking a birthday cake for you that has no fewer than four tiers and yet he won’t allow any of us a single sniff until you’ve arrived?”
Draco smiled guiltily as Hermione laughed in the background.
“I’m serious,” Harry insisted, “the woman’s clearly stuck in the 1800s, why should you listen to anything she says? I think you’d look great in these outfits.”
“Good,” Harry cleared his throat, “Did you, um, did you bring the contract I asked for?”
“Why couldn’t you just keep your legs shut?” the man shot back harshly. “I swear if this gets out, we’re done with you. Let Severus deal with your wanton ways.”
“More than!” Olive laughed before her eyes fell questioningly on Draco. “And who’s this lovely young thing?”
Harry’s eyes seemed to glaze out of focus for a moment before the alpha cleared his throat and picked up a napkin. “Here, you’ve got some on your chin,” Harry said, dabbing the cloth against Draco’s face and inadvertently swiping Draco’s sticky lips with the pad of his thumb.
“You even brought a change for me?” Harry asked curiously as Draco went even more red.
“I was wondering if you’d let me stay overnight in here,” Harry murmured, taking his hand away from his face and looking hesitantly at Draco. “It’s just I wanted to start giving you and the baby more physical touch and ever since you got hurt, my alpha’s been going a little crazy.”
The letter didn’t bear any recognizable seals so Draco knew it wasn’t another of his aunt’s diatribes. He unfurled the parchment and began to read,
“Thanks for that,” Harry muttered, pulling up his jeans and absently noticing a rip at the knee.
“No,” the woman hissed a second later, “I’m not surprised, but I am disappointed. You
“You still hungry?” Harry asked, gesturing to Draco’s now empty plate.
By the time they got back to Gaedere House, Hermione had sent a Patronus telling Katie that the crisis was averted as she had managed to cast a cooling stasis over the food, which apparently had calmed Harry down considerably. Draco felt guilty as he hadn’t realised the older man was anxious for him to arrive.
“Oh yes,” Hermione called back, “Are you taking Runes for Newts then?”
“I’ll let you get washed up and changed then,” Harry said, smiling at Draco before leaving the room. Taking a moment to lean against the door from the outside and gather himself back together.
“Do you cook?” Draco asked, remembering that one of Harry’s godfathers had mentioned cooking in his letter.
Harry finally made contact, his hand spreading out across Draco’s right breast, the entire mound fit perfectly in Harry’s palm and Draco’s skin felt like cool china beneath him.
Harry was lying on the hospital bed with Draco carefully tucked into his chest. Harry regretted that his first intimate contact with the younger boy was not whilst they were both awake as they had planned. However, this was necessary in order to calm Draco’s omega and try to mitigate any stress the baby might have endured.
“Okay,” Draco nodded, suddenly looking very sleepy. Harry felt a little guilty, it was probably the middle of the night and the poor omega was still very pregnant.
“You stink,” Bella pulled a disgusted face, “how can I even think about choosing food when you’re oozing eau de brothel?”
“It’s um, there’s lacy bits,” Harry cleared his throat and attempted to stick his hands in his pockets before realising his pyjamas didn’t have any. “It really suits you Draco.”
“Draco, I’m really fucking sorry,” Harry murmured, reaching out to stroke a finger cautiously down the younger boy’s cold cheek. “Are you okay? I didn’t mean to trigger…” Harry trailed off as Draco let out an embarrassed whimper. What the hell was Harry going to think of him now? There was a running joke about slutty omegas slicking up at the drop of a hat for any alpha who so much as looked at them.
“Like the great Harry Potter hasn’t got a seventeen year old omega up the duff?” Harry asked wryly, lifting an eyebrow.
“This is Draco,” Harry said, giving the omega’s shoulder a small squeeze. “He’s quite into fashion.”
Draco let out a surprised moan before writhing on the sheets, his feet slipping in their attempt to find purchase. Harry loved how he could wrap his entire hand around it, completely enveloping Draco’s cock in the heat of his palm, even Draco’s dick felt slightly cool to the touch.
The walk started out alright, winding around various flowerbeds and bits of shrubbery and eventually into the castle when the wind picked up. However, for some reason Harry found his feet carrying him to the west staircases and then past the Arithmancy Department and then up the spiral turret and finally to the doors of the Hospital Wing.
“That half-blood will never bite you,” Bella declared, as if delivering some sort of divination prophecy. Perhaps she thought she was, her eyes were wild enough and parts of her black hair had come loose in a tufted mane. Maybe her failed resurrection ritual from the previous summer had finally sent her stark raving mad. “How many times has he mounted you now? What exactly is he waiting for?!”
“He’s not her,” Snape hissed, “It’s not the part of her I wanted to keep!”
“Okay,” Draco replied, knowing that Harry would never have taken advantage of him like that. He certainly couldn’t say the same for other alphas though. If Draco had been in some sort of heat-like daze it was amazing that Harry’s alpha had been able to resist. A small, silly part of Draco wondered if Harry found his scent disgusting? He supposed he must have looked ridiculous, splashing around in the bath like some sort of horny hippopotamus.
Draco’s mouth fell open as he gaped at Harry. “I don’t throw strops!”
much of an asocial blighter. So long as Remus is happy that the lunch will stretch?”
“Quite,” Snape muttered before adding something that sounded like ‘incompetence’ under his breath.
“What’s up?” Harry asked, peering over at the piles of components that Draco had spent the last twenty minutes methodically organising.
“Oh?” Harry asked, raising an eyebrow in amusement.
After his only friends had left, Hogwarts had seemed all the more horribly empty for Draco. He had ended up spending most of his free time down in the Potions dungeons with Severus. Draco’s beta godfather had been temporarily looking after the omega. This was due to Draco’s aunt Bellatrix having been injured that year during a dangerous ritual that Draco suspected had been intended to bring back the Dark Lord.
Draco gasped as his body started to respond to having an alpha on top of him, an alpha to whom he was oh so very attracted.
Harry’s eyes immediately latched onto a small wet spot on Draco’s nightgown. The damp was particularly visible on the thin white cotton. For one horrifying moment, Harry thought he might have had some sort of wet dream without realising it and ended up getting part of his release on Draco. The innocent omega would probably never agree to bed share with Harry again if that had happened.
Harry tilted Draco so he was cradled to the side in Harry’s arms, lying him down on the bed so Harry could enjoy the sight of his body in entirety. Draco breathed hard as Harry continued to massage his small prick, his large grey eyes staring at Harry’s face.
He convinced himself that it would be okay. Once the baby came, Draco wouldn’t have any time to think about such things, devoting all of his energy to his child that he already loved with his whole heart. He was pretty sure by now that Harry wasn’t going to take custody away from Draco or something equally horrible.
“Thank you,” Draco smiled happily as he stuck a finger in a pile of vinegary looking sherbet and sucked it hungrily into his mouth.
“Um, thank you,” Harry replied, a little taken aback.
“Your…pyjamas?” Harry questioned, wondering if there was something he was missing here. He knew that omegas weren’t usually around alphas unchaperoned but he figured theirs was a unique situation.
^*^*^*^*^
Draco tugged at several folded blankets, causing the tower of bedding to collapse around him. He tutted and started picking it all up, brushing off any dust from the floor before piling everything onto the bed. Next, he found himself dragging down Harry’s shirts from their hangers, even rummaging through the older man’s underwear drawer for a handful of clean, folded boxers and briefs.
have but I figured the great Harry Potter might show a little class.”
“Why would I send you away?” Harry frowned down at him.
have promising news.”
Harry woke up the next morning to a moving weight on his lap. He groggily cracked open his eyes to see a flash of long red hair.
“Exactly,” Katie nodded, “Lots of new formulae have been introduced since Hermione sat the NEWTS.”
Ginny said the omega’s name like it was a particularly ridiculous word.
“Oh, I’ve been wrapping some of the t-tights I got from Olive’s around my chest,” Draco explained.
“Do I l-look like I could be in my twenties?” Draco asked.
“It’s perfect,” Harry said firmly, before gazing curiously at Draco, “may I see?”
Draco jerked his head up, nearly knocking into Harry’s chin, his eyes were wide and searching.
“Nick says we should go somewhere nice this summer,” Katie sighed, rolling up the sleeves of her cardigan so they didn’t hang into her plate full of gravy. Harry realised that Katie must have bought herself a new one as this cardigan was almost identical to the one she had given Draco for Christmas, only it was bright blue. She looked like some sort of Sesame Street character and with Draco beside her in a smaller but no less fluffy version; the overall effect was quite humorous.
“Are you overcompensating for something, Harry?” Draco teases, his eyes full of mirth. However, he sits up and holds out his hands out as Harry deposits the egg, now the size of a dragon’s egg, in them.
Draco gave in and kissed Harry, who obviously had not been expecting it. Even a chaste kiss such as this was better than a heated kiss inside a nightclub. It filled Draco with a warmth that he expected he would never find anywhere else on this cold winter’s day.
“Fine. If it makes you feel better, I’ll wear your tie, too,” Harry says, knotting the Slytherin tie. He makes it a point to turn it around to show Draco the silver stitching on the back. He grins at Draco and says, “Draco Malfoy. Have you heard of him? Supposedly he’s a gorgeous bloke wearing a Gryffindor tie?”
“I’m sure you can,” Draco agrees. “However, I have an early Portkey to Paris tomorrow and the Weasleys are expecting you at the Burrow if they haven’t already figured out that you’ve returned.”
“Yes, Harry, the wedding has been lovely so far, but if I know you, you wouldn’t want to cause any distractions. Seeing as you already have, you should probably apologise to Charlie and Luna as soon as you can.”
Harry sits at the table, stunned as he watches Luna leave the room. If Luna, one of the people who knows Malfoy better than he does, thinks that Malfoy is interested in him, then perhaps Harry still has a chance.
“So leave,” Malfoy says. He lowers his wand and begins to open the gate so that he can step inside.
They spent the afternoon decorating Grimmauld Place, arranging the baubles and figurines in strategic positions that only Harry could make sense of. The place soon buzzed with Celestina Warbeck singing and the two of them sipping hot cocoa with far too many marshmallows.
Draco shakes his head. “Not yet. Let me properly assess it.” Normally, Draco would have worn latex gloves and examined the creature on the table, casting diagnostic spells with his wand if Muggles weren’t around. Instead, his long fingers traces the thing. He doesn’t know what else to call it, but it’s about two and half inches long, furry, and with slight claws protruding on the end.
Draco sighs. “You may keep the sentimental items, Potter, but everything else goes. Your clothes are too frayed and if you must wear jeans and t-shirts, then you will buy new ones.”
Draco nodded. “You’ll be interested to know that I finished cataloging and restoring the books in the library.” He sent his cup over to the sink and flicked his wand so that it washed itself. “I fulfilled my end of the contract so, logically, it’s time for me to leave.”
“Well, that’s sickeningly sweet. I’ve always wondered how you charmed Draco,” Pansy says, “Now let’s go find him.”
Harry taps his wand on the crown of Draco’s head. “You don’t seem to have that many. We could try to Summon the lice out,” Harry says, but stops at the look of horror on Draco’s face.
This is the reason Draco had been complaining about his headache for the past few days -- one that came with an itchy side-effect. It’s not, as they had previously thought, the result of a new shampoo from Paris, the one Harry had bought for Draco after one of his Auror missions.
Pansy looks up from her newspaper to greet him as he sits down, but then her jaw drops.
“This ornament is for you to decorate. Tomorrow, my godson Teddy is coming over to bake some biscuits and make hot cocoa and I was wondering if you would join us. I’ve been telling Teddy about you and he’s excited to meet you. Only if you want to, of course.”
“Yes,” Teddy responds, his hair turning turquoise.
With one last desperate grab at the jumper, Draco comes up empty handed and with a new scratch across his knuckles. Before he can grab his wand to heal it, Draco hears a loud
“Oh,” Neville says, biting his lips. “That’s a shame. Roses would be easier to use on such short notice. I can put together a bouquet that tells a story, but if I can’t use roses, I’ll take that as a challenge. Tell me a little bit about him, if you don’t mind.”
Draco gently strokes Teddy’s hair, the colour changing to brown as it does when he’s upset. “Teddy, sweetheart, I’m sorry you had to find out this way, but Mr Finny is dead,” Draco begins.
“I’m sorry, Vernon,” Tim from Accounting says when Vernon exits the lift, “the lift has been giving us trouble all day. At least you didn’t have to climb all those stairs.”
“No!” Draco says immediately. The shocked look on Amy’s face leads him to hastily add, “Believe me, children and pets don’t seem to like me. They prefer Harry, actually.”
wand.” It’s one of the few wandless spells Harry has taught him how to use. Draco points his wand at the paper and murmurs a spell Hermione taught him when he had complained about accidentally spilling ink on his parchment.
?” Draco asks, putting the paper down.
Draco wags a finger at him. “Well, it wouldn’t be a surprise if I told you, wouldn’t it?”
Draco hits Harry’s shoulder. “Do not mock me, Harry!”
Three mannequins are displayed underneath a neon green sign advertising
Hidden just behind the door, Harry struggles to hold back and not to barge in as Draco lets out a noise of distress.
“Are you still a git?” Ron asks.
Harry’s laughter trailed behind him as he hurried to his room. He opened his suitcase and threw all his belongings into it, not even bothering to sort them out properly. At the last moment he decided that he needed to change clothes. It wouldn’t hurt to make a good impression.
Draco nods and drops the jumper in his shopping basket.
Malfoy’s face has turned bright red by the time he finally manages to
“Now that my own father has contributed to their suspicions, I don’t know if I can keep pretending that everything is all right for the rest of my life. It’s exhausting and wouldn’t be fair to both of us.” Draco is panting by the time he’s finished everything he wants to say and his face has lost what little colouring it has. Draco takes deep breaths and counts them slowly, trying to ground himself, a technique Harry’s own therapist taught him.
“My family does not have any association with Harry Potter. He’s a freak. Our lives were almost ruined because of him!”
The article is an in-depth interview with Lucius Malfoy who discusses every little thing about his son, from Draco’s involvement during the war to how he, Lucius, considers it a blessing in disguise that the Malfoy name would end with his son due to Draco’s deteriorating mental state. The line that sticks out to Harry the most is
They look the same since their Hogwarts days, especially their red hair, but now their clothes are no longer second-hand and they have an air of confidence that only comes with being successful and having the world in their hands.
Harry’s here because he’s curious. He never thought that any magic would be passed through Vernon Dudley’s blood, as bigoted as the man was.
“Hi Dudley,” Harry says at last.
Harry laughs. “That’s because I spilled some catnip onto the jumper as I was kitting it. I guess I didn’t get all of it out.”
Pansy bursts out laughing. “Draco, your poor imaginary child. How could you do this to him?”
Harry doesn’t respond; instead he trails his fingers through the blond strands, much like he did with Teddy earlier that morning. Poor Draco. Now that he’s close enough to see, there are red bumps and scratches everywhere on his scalp. Draco winces a bit and Harry stops combing the hair.
“If you don’t like it, we do have other options,” Amy offers.
A sharp sound of breaking glass catches Amy’s attention and she says, “Let me know if you need any more help,” before walking away.
Everything changed the night Draco had saved Harry’s life. Harry, Granger, and Weasley had left on a mission in the middle of the night during a rain storm. Hours later, Weasley had carried Harry into Grimmauld Place and set him down on a bed. Harry’s shirt had been slashed and red blood spilled onto the bedsheets below.
Pansy unfolds a garish pink jumper with multiple rainbows on the front and the collar trimmed in green tinsel. Her look of disgust turns to delight as she reads out the words. “Draco, look at this.
“Harry,” Hermione said, leading him away from the window and into the living room. She sat down and placed another cup of coffee into his hands. “Draco’s not the same person, right? After all, you’re living together and you would know best out of all of us. I know he’s been making you happy. So tell me about him.”
Draco smiles, holding Harry against him, brushing away a smudge of spice of his cheeks. “I am. The assignment was far easier than I thought. How was your day?”
s the cat treats, but they pay no attention to him as they purr louder and roll around on the jumper. He shakes the tin and the cats stop, but don’t move out of his way. Draco waits patiently, with a treat in his hand, and it’s not long before Noel sticks her head out from underneath the tree.
When Harry had rung Dudley the next day after he had received the letter, the conversation had been stilted. They had exchanged pleasantries, and Dudley had talked about his job and his family. He really opened up when speaking about his daughter Daisy, who wanted to be the first singer-astronaut in the world. Apparently, she still hasn’t decided on which one she liked best.
“Harry, my boyfriend He’s the reason I’m here. I ruined his Christmas surprise yesterday.”
Draco couldn’t help himself. He unwrapped more and more ornaments, looking at all the pieces and snapshots of Harry’s life, until he had them all spread out on the table. He was saddened at the thought that while they were on friendlier terms, Draco really didn’t know Harry as well as he thought he did.
Draco had met Nick several times in passing, but had only ever really talked about Quidditch scores with him. Draco agreed that he was nothing special, but he did treat Harry right. As far as Draco knew, he could find no major fault with him. Harry never said anything negative about Nick. He did with Draco, when they had reminisced about the Hogwarts and what utter prats they both had been. But Draco deserved that.
Harry looks away from where Luna and her new husband, Rolf Scamander, are posing for the photographer while slicing their wedding cake. They look happy and carefree, vastly different from what Harry is feeling now that Ron is finally ready to discuss what he, Harry, considers the big Erumpent in the room.
Draco shakes his head. “Is it? I read every word of the article on the train ride over here and not one word is false. I can’t sue for libel, which is a miracle in and of itself considering it’s written by Skeeter. I cannot escape my past nor should I be able to and this article will ensure that I’m even more ostracized.”
George adds, “Plus your old potions teacher had a lot of praise for you.”
Harry smiled as he watched Ron throw a stick far into the distance. The dog, who was named Lucky, barked once before chasing after the stick. Ron said that they had adopted him soon after arriving in Australia. Back then, he and Hermione hadn’t known anyone and had felt incredibly lonely while they searched for her parents.
Harry loves being an Auror, but it has its drawbacks. His memories of Draco had to suffice during the last ten years of lonely nights he had spent in dingy safe houses, of terrible meals where even the scraps the Dursleys had fed him were marginally better, and trying to survive as he chased criminals whilst being hexed within an inch of his life.
“Dudley’s probably never mentioned that I’m a wizard to his family, if I’m mentioned at all. So if she has bursts of accidental magic, especially around other people who become scared, there would be no one around to tell her that it’s normal. Wouldn’t you be frightened if strange things happened to you, things you couldn’t explain? I think it’s better to know the truth than to be kept in the dark, don’t you agree?”
“No!” Draco yells, now uncaring of the effects of
He still can’t believe that he has been secretly dating Harry for almost two years, ever since he defected from Voldemort’s side after failing to kill Professor Dumbledore. Draco had left his parents behind that night in favour of helping the Order and hasn’t regretted it once.
“For good reason,” Draco said. His shoulders sagged as if a great deal of weight had slipped off and he knew that all the missed sleep was starting to catch up to him. “Perhaps the Healers should have done a more thorough head examination. They must have missed something if you are saying those things right now.”
“Yes,” Draco interrupts. “I would love to spend Christmas with your family.”
Draco thinks.
Hermione’s voice was gentle when she spoke. “Oh, Harry. No. What gave you that impression?”
“Don’t lie, Charlie. I saw your face after what I said this morning.”
Harry’s Muggle relative, Daisy Dursley, is staying in their home while her parents are on holiday in Japan celebrating their twentieth wedding anniversary. Draco has no problems with Daisy; she’s been pleasant all week, helping out with chores and generally keeping out of trouble. At sixteen, she’s funny and smart, especially in mathematics. If Harry is to be believed, Daisy is nothing like her father when he was that age.
“Harry, tell Draco that you can’t put pineapple on a pizza!”
They sit in the silence watching the sun set as red, orange and purple streaks paint the sky.
“Don’t be a prude, Ron,” Ginny says, winking at them. “They’re big boys now.”
Draco smiles at Harry’s words. He does have a near perfect record for saving his patients. “All right, Harry. I’ll owl my mother to let her know I am joining you at the Burrow. That means we’ll have to have dinner with my parents. Are you ready for that?”
George shakes his head. “Harry did that, fortunately.”
will be displeased to find out that they need to print a retraction when they voted you as the best boyfriend one could possibly hope for. Your fans will be so disappointed,” Draco says. His hands are slowly making their way down Harry’s chest, touching every inch of skin that he can reach.
“I’m allergic to an ingredient. The spider eyes will make me break out in hives.”
Draco smoothed out the creases on the newspaper. The entire top half featured a grainy photograph of Draco, recognised by his white-blond hair, coming out of a pub and following someone into a dark alley. From the way he was stumbling and clutching brick building, he had had more than enough to drink. Draco didn’t even need to view the remainder of the loop to know that it had resulted in him getting a blow job.
“Sure,” Harry says. He’s never seen Draco eat anything with his bare hands, so this will be interesting to watch.
“Thank you,” Harry says, kissing Draco as he enters. He toes off his shoes as he walks towards the kitchen, setting the bags down on the table. A quick swish of his wand has the groceries sorting themselves in the fridge and pantry. “What do you want for dinner? We could try the chicken -- Draco? What’s wrong?”
A loud
“What?” Draco frowns and looks down at the outfit in his hands. “This isn’t for a baby?” Upon closer inspection, he reads the tag attached out loud. “Christmas pet costume, one size fits most.”
Vernon’s eyes bulge out. “Harry? You’re here for the boy?”
“No—“
“I’m assuming that’s favoritism and illegal since I am your boyfriend. There is no way the
Harry tries, and fails, to suppress a smile. “Then one dose should do the trick. Draco, you’re practically hairless.” Harry stops his teasing when he finally notices Draco frowning at him.
“Everything,” Harry repeats. “Then you should know
“Fair enough,” he says. “No.”
“Are those cinnamon rolls?” Ron interrupts, sitting down and setting the briefcase on the floor.
Harry Potter was also a lot more confident and it showed in the way he talked to Draco, no fumbling words, or quick outbursts whenever he was irritated. He kept his emotions in check and when he spoke, he commanded the attention of everyone around him.
Cradling an arm around Draco’s neck and placing the other arm underneath his knees, Harry lifts Draco’s warm body against his and makes the journey back to their bedroom. Draco’s hair tickles Harry’s nose and instead of Draco’s usual citrus and vanilla shampoo, Harry smells the woodsy shampoo he himself favours. He falters in his steps, which causes Draco’s head to roll away from his chest.
Draco pauses, a feeling of dread filling his stomach. Harry wouldn’t dare, not with Teddy around, but Draco has to ask.
“Non-magic people,” Harry says. “He’s a pureblood wizard, which means there’s not a single person in Draco’s family who wasn’t born with magic.”
With that bit of encouragement, Harry feels a great weight lift off his shoulders and he finds the courage to say what he really thinks about his date. “He’s really brilliant! He brews potions and has his own business and occasionally consults with the Aurors. He’s snarky and unafraid to take me off the pedestal that everyone else has put me on. He’s very sarcastic, but that’s only because it’s his default defense mechanism, but once he lets his guard down, he’s loyal to a fault.”
“Harry, you should go to him and tell him how you feel.”
“What are you doing?” Harry cries out, already pulling out the several Weasley jumpers that he loves. “You can’t throw those away. Those are my clothes. What am I going to wear?”
Draco feels his cheeks turn pink. “Potions is very different from calculus.”
Draco smirks. “Always. I see you’re still a Gryffindor, asking questions you don’t have any clue about.”
“Harry!” Pansy exclaims, stepping out from the fireplace and making her way over. A few people in the crowd gaze appreciatively at her, and there’s even a flash from a camera, but Pansy ignores them.
Harry had been charmed by Daisy and as soon as Harry had finished the phone call, he and Draco had made a plan. Harry would talk to Dudley and Draco would observe Daisy to see if she actually displayed any accidental magic. Harry had even talked to Hermione about what information to share with Dudley and his wife, even though at the end of her Floo call she had asked if Harry was going to be okay.
had finally left Privet Drive for good. For an entire year, his family had been placed in protective custody and cut off from the entire world. Even after the Dursleys had been released, there had been several times that Vernon couldn’t shake off the thought that any single oddity was the result of
So even if Daisy had been a witch, Draco would have had the same problem. Harry’s the one who’s charismatic and outgoing and could talk to anyone, even if he had just met them. Draco, on the other hand, appears standoffish to everyone except his closest friends. He’s only comfortable when he’s with Harry or working on his lycanthropy research in his potions lab.
“No,” Harry says quickly. “At this point, I don’t even know if I have a chance. It seems that I’ve fucked up all the relationships I’ve ever had.”
“I tried to help Daisy with her calculus homework and I didn’t understand anything, so I did the best I could and used magic.”
When Draco finally looks away from the pile of ash on the floor, his eyes are brimmed with tears. He looks at the box in Harry’s hand for a second before gazing into Harry’s eyes. Harry’s heart beats rapidly as the seconds go by.
“Draco Malfoy! Why are you wearing a Gryffindor tie?”
“Ron, I’m fine!” Harry said, exasperated. “I can do this by myself, you know.”
Harry tightens his hold on Draco and kisses the top of his head. “I promise. Now got to sleep, Draco. I love you.”
Draco listlessly shrugs his shoulders. “I don’t feel brave. I thought that it would be all right if I wasn’t brave as long as the people around me loved me. Harry always talks about his found family being warm and welcoming, but I never feel more alone than when I’m at the Burrow. After five years they still don’t trust me and think that I’m just dating Harry to restore my reputation. I’ve tried to show them how much my beliefs have changed and that I truly love Harry, but have been met with polite indifference, at least when Harry is around. I know Weasley checks if I’ve dosed Harry with some sort of potion every time we’re invited over for brunch.”
and thus the entire Wizarding world will soon know.
No matter what he felt, he still had to go check up on Harry.  Draco reluctantly changed into a thick jumper, one that Mrs Weasley had knitted for Harry, and walked to Harry’s room. The door was ajar but there was no one when he peered inside. On the nightstand were several different coloured potions, all sealed. Draco scowled. Trust Harry to ignore his Healer’s orders.
“I don’t care if she’s a witch! She’s my child and I love her. I’m not going to treat her like my father treated you when we learned you were a wizard. I just want her to be safe.”
want to marry him?”
Luna grins at him. “I think it’s incredibly wonderful and lucky to find love at a wedding.”
“Pity.”
Harry shrugs his shoulders and Draco sighs. He taps his wand against the egg like the children had done earlier in the day to reveal their prizes. As the shell breaks away, Draco’s breath catches. There’s a transparent glass sphere with a single golden line going all around and a clasp in the shape of feather. Inside is a golden tree with a peacock nestled in the branches.
For a moment, it looks like Harry is disappointed, but Draco can’t be sure as Harry quickly hides it with a small smile.
Teddy doesn’t look convinced, but he allows his grandmother to help him with his jacket and shoes. Harry follows them to the front door and then kneels down so that he is eye level with Teddy. “Bye, Teddy. I’ll see you next weekend, okay?”
“Ideally, yes. Ron only said that the mission you were on was not even a dangerous one, but that  you were distracted and you broke your arm.” Draco sighed. “I know that’s rubbish because you take your job too seriously to ever be distracted by anything.”
Draco smiles. “It does too. It’s a shame that not even a single Gryffindor thought of that first. Besides, Rose looked so happy with all of the eggs. You can’t blame me.”
“Just a misunderstanding,” Draco says, watching as the scratch heals within seconds. “To be honest, I’m surprised that it’s not worse. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that Holly and Noel are starting to like me.”
, Draco thinks briefly before smiling. “Harry, you’re home!” Draco says, rushing over to greet him. He quickly kisses the bemused expression on Harry’s face, trying to give him a proper hug despite the bags that Harry is carrying. Harry tastes like peppermint from the Muggle gum he always chews. Draco steps back to properly look at him. Harry’s wearing his normal clothes, no Auror uniform in sight and he breathes a sigh of relief that there are no visible injuries. “Thank Merlin! You will not believe the day I just had. Never leave me again!”
“I know that, but I’ve already lost my mother. And even though my father has done terrible things, it still stung when he disowned me when I wouldn’t agree to marry the woman he chose for me.”
on the cold logs in the fireplace.
“Pansy, what are you doing?” Harry says, but she only pulls out a rolled up newspaper from her purse. She hesitates, then asks, “You haven’t talked to Draco all day?”
Harry was tracing the words on the page, but he did look up in order to say, “Thank you, Draco. This is possibly one of the best presents I’ve ever received.” Even in the dim light, Draco could see the tears threatening to fall down his cheeks.
“Not now, Sir Cadogan,” Draco says, rolling his eyes “I’m late! When Harry wakes up, tell him I’m eating breakfast with Pansy,” Draco calls out over his shoulder.
“Well, I don’t really look the same as when I left.” Harry gestured to his body, which was fuller and much broader than when he had first arrived in Australia. “I mean, I am fine with the way I look, but—I don’t know, Hermione. What if Draco still looks the same, but he finds me entirely different?”
“I told him it was either this or he would find himself with a Howler within the hour. So will you help him?”
Noel emerges slowly, her tail swishing back and forth, her eyes never looking away from the cat treat. Draco lowers his hand and Noel snatches the treat in her mouth before scurrying off. As Draco looks back to the tree, he sees Holly’s amber eyes staring at him from between the stacked presents. She yawns wide, before sinking her claws into the jumper and tearing it.
They are ushered in the living room where the walls are covered in film posters and there’s an entire bookcase filled with DVDs and Blu-Rays. Daisy runs over to a woman on the couch, who’s busy typing on a laptop. When she sees them, she shuts it closed and stands to greet them.
“It will still work for you. Andromeda said it worked for Teddy just fine.”
“They haven’t destroyed any of my clothes yet,” Draco says. “And they let me feed them so they won’t starve.”
Draco points to the window shop. “I’d like to see the jumper from the window. The Christmas stocking one that I can add a bottle of wine to.”
Hermione doesn’t immediately answer, too busy trying to hold her infant daughter without waking her. Rose Weasley is only ten months old and had spent most of Luna’s wedding being passed around to their family and friends. By the end of the evening, just as couples were starting to dance, she had fallen fast asleep.
“Do you want to help?” Draco asks. His face does not show any emotion, something Draco does on purpose when he doesn’t want to influence Harry’s decision.
“Fine, but you have to Vanish any sick up I might have,” she says, her face turning slightly green. Draco nods, hoping she doesn’t get sick.
“Well, was it fantastic?” Hermione asked, but immediately put her hand over her mouth. “Sorry, that was rude of me to ask. But I don’t see what’s wrong.”
Vernon Dursley is a creature of habit and he cannot function without a proper cup of tea.
“Hermione wrote me a letter?” Draco reaches out to grab the scroll, but Ron pulls it out of his reach.
“It’s snowing and it’s the first day of December. It’s time to decorate for Christmas so I had to get a tree,” Harry said, as if the argument last night had not happened.
“Did you say
“Are you all right, Teddy?” Draco asks, as he casts basic diagnostic charms on him. “Did you hurt yourself?” he continues, relieved when the charms reveal nothing.
“Where did you find this?” Harry asks. He spreads the jumper over his lap. Noel and Holly immediately bat their paws at the loose yarn, but Harry shoos them away.
This isn’t the first time Harry has found Draco sleeping this way. Harry hates the stress the undercover missions causes his husband and he aches to smooth out the lines on Draco’s forehead. If he were awake, Draco would never state that he is unhappy with Harry’s job, because he knows how much Harry enjoys being an Auror. At least he isn’t crying in his sleep this time.
“Oh, Harry. You do like this person. Is it anyone we know? I did notice that you were sending a lot of post via international owl this summer, but Ron and I never wanted to ask because we wanted you to be able to talk to us. We didn’t want to pry.”
Harry had been excited about the Christmas season, and, whenever Ron and Hermione were over, would start planning out the dinners and food he wanted to bake when he hosted this year’s Christmas dinner. That was all Harry had talked about for weeks, not even dismayed by the lack of enthusiasm his friends had shown.
Harry opens a book and flips through the pages. “We’ll start off easy. How can you tell if a cat is pregnant?”
-ing them into your basket does not count.”
people returning to ruin his life once again.
“Draco, you practically live together as you haven’t been to your flat in months. I’m sure you’ve seen every inch of Harry’s body by now,” she says, rolling her eyes. She adds it to the growing pile in the shopping basket before picking up a bright orange jumper. After reading it, she tries to hold in her laughter as she asks, “Draco, does Harry still have that house-elf?”
Harry Potter already had a boyfriend and Draco was not going to destroy that happy relationship.
He lights his wand with a soft
Draco knocks the crystal ball out of Harry’s hand and pushes him down on the grass, kissing him over and over again, his hands tangling in Harry’s hair. When they break away, Draco’s cheeks are flushed, but he’s smiling so wide, showing off the wrinkles around his eyes and lips, wrinkles that Harry will never dare mention. But it makes him happy, knowing that Draco is happy with him.
“Harry knows the truth; he can see beyond the lies,” Pansy says, voice trembling. She rubs circles on his back to calm him down. “He loves you.”
Teddy slowly nods. “I tried so hard to take care of him. I fed him every morning and sang to him and told him all of my favourite stories.”
“Harrods?” Pansy repeats, stepping inside the taxi as Draco opens the door for her. “Isn’t that where Mrs Zabini’s fourth husband was a silent partner?”
“I don’t know what you are talking about,” Harry said, adding more milk and sugar to his tea. Draco shuddered. He didn’t know how Harry could take his tea like that. However, he would not be distracted by Harry’s ridiculous eating habits.
It’s on the tip of Harry’s tongue to say that Malfoy is definitely single. With Malfoy in charge of the wedding planning and having Harry as his assistant, they had found out they actually enjoyed each other’s company. Harry liked working with Malfoy; his sharp wit and constant commentary had been refreshing to Harry’s ears. With Luna and Rolf, Malfoy was attentive, always listened to their suggestions, and even found ways to incorporate their simplest requests in the wedding, such as having the white peacocks as their ring bearers.
“I always knew he was a freak,” Vernon says, voice trembling with rage. “His magic made him unnatural and now this!”
as he runs to the tree and reaches underneath. His only racing thought is that he must save the jumper before it’s ruined.
“If you knew that you were going to hire me, then what was the point of all this,” Draco says at last, pointing at the ferrets who are now running around their ankles chasing each other.
“What’s wrong?” Draco had asked, rushing over to see if he could help.
“Right,” Dudley says, pausing as if he has many questions to ask Harry and doesn’t know where to start. “Let’s go to Julia’s office,” Dudley says instead. “I don’t want Daisy to interrupt us.”
ing the pot and putting the dishes to wash.
Instead of answering, Harry taps the crystal ball and says, “
Just as he’s about to faint, Vernon hears the barista call out “Tea for Vernon!” and Draco finally looks away. Vernon grabs his tea and avoids Draco’s gaze, too afraid that whatever just occurred will happen again. Vernon flees the shop as fast as he can.
“Harry, you haven’t hurt me,” Charlie says. When Harry makes a noise of protest, Charlie holds up his hand. “Or angered me, or even upset me, or anything that’s going around in your mind at the moment.”
Immediately Draco’s arms and legs start flailing, trying to escape the confines of Harry’s arms. “Stop! Let me go!” Draco cries out, twisting like a wild animal. “
“All right, but you can’t tell Harry,” he says. “
“I’m not mocking. Just stating the truth, Draco. Besides, I missed you, too.”
“So, Harry,” Ron says casually, “I heard you finally broke up with Charlie.”
He was almost out of his room when he remembered the events of last night.
Ron and George are laughing hysterically and even Harry can’t hide a smile. After a few long seconds, a baby ferret comes out of the briefcase and brings forth an envelope for Draco.
Harry says something just as a lorry blasts their horn.
Even though it’s early in the morning, the small shop is in absolute chaos. About twenty people, most likely tourists, move around as they search for last minute gifts, wearing stressed looks on their faces. Small children touch everything in sight with sticky hands, yelling at one another. Even louder are the babies that cry when jostled awake and can’t be soothed.
By the end of it, Harry is grinning. “It sounds perfect!”
When he hears the crack of Apparition, Harry runs up the stairs and into their bedroom, trying to catch his breath as he leans against the door frame, rubbing a stitch in his side. The air smells of strong disinfectant, the bed is stripped bare, the curtains are taken down, and there is a house elf trying to catch all of the clothes that are being thrown out of the closet.
Vernon twists the knob furiously, only to find that it will not turn. He starts pounding on the door, but hears Draco sigh behind him. When he turns around, Draco is staring lazily at him, a stick grasped in his hand.
’s the yellow smiley face balloon and holds it out for Draco to take. “This is for you.”
“I don’t see any reason why I should stay,” Draco replied. He glanced back to see that Harry had a worried expression on his face and he frowned when Draco added, “Especially when I know that I’m no longer wanted here.”
Pansy is waiting inside the shop by the time Draco has ordered two cherry scones and two takeaway cups of coffee. Her eyes light up as she grabs a cup, taking a large gulp. “This is probably the best thing Muggles have invented.”
“Draco is going to kill me,” Harry mutters. “He’s just left for St Mungo’s to have his head examined.”
Draco stills. “Harry?” he whispers. His names sounds like a sob on Draco’s lips. “Is it really you?” He blinks his eyes open slowly, trying to clear the sleep from his eyes and failing. It doesn’t stop him from trying to kiss Harry, missing his lips entirely and catching the edge of his jaw.
Draco shrugs. “I don’t think it’s a wise choice for you. I know where you live. If you try to run, I'll find you. Remember the last time you tried to escape magic by traveling all over England so Harry couldn't get his Hogwarts letter? You never succeeded.”
“I really do like you, Draco,” Harry repeats. “Why don’t you believe me?”
“Yes. You won’t be at peace until you do.” As soon as she said those words, Harry knew that she was right. He needed to go home before it drove him crazy thinking about it.
He nodded and Ron breathed a sigh of relief. “Thanks. Hermione and I will come over this evening.” He threw the powder in the fireplace, called out his destination, and disappeared.
Harry’s hand tightened. “How could I have said something when I knew you frequently went out to pull? A different person every night? I didn’t want to become another person that you ticked off a list.”
Neville laughs. “What kind of herbologist would I be if I didn’t know that? Besides, it’s one of the things Grandmother insisted I learn when she saw how serious I was about Herbology. I never thought you would ask about floriography. Isn’t that a bit out of fashion?”
“What was that?”
“Then I don’t want it.”
“Yes, more than your cats did,” Draco replies.
Charlie exhales loudly. “I wish there was a Pensieve around so I could show you properly. I was surprised, that’s all. You took me by surprise. Or perhaps I wanted to not believe what I had been suspecting for a while.”
“I thought it was broken and I was trying to fix it. Your clock hand has been in the same place for far too long, never moving,” Draco says. He yawns, the warm air tickling Harry’s skin. “It’s okay. As long as you aren’t in
“Sorry,” Harry says. “I don’t know how many times I’ll keep apologising and I still don’t think it will be enough.”
He was curious to find out what Harry’s ornament would be like this year. Would it include something about Draco?
“Dudley wants my help,” Harry says.
“Shit,” Harry says, and fires
Harry feels his heart breaking. “What makes you say that?”
“Just a spell that causes your heart to stop beating for a few seconds every time you even think about Harry. Considering the state of your heart, I think it’s a fair price to pay for all the things you’ve done to him.”
Daisy lets out a surprised gasp when the ink disappears.
Harry shrugs his shoulders. “It wasn’t so bad. Malfoy’s not as big of a prick nowadays. He’s the reason why this wedding was a success. If it were just me, today would have been a disaster.”
“Teddy broke an egg on my head when I wasn’t looking.” Draco is grateful that it’s only confetti. Whatever spells George used on the Easter eggs ranged from harmless to full on embarrassment. “At least it didn’t turn my hair green like Ron’s did. Rumour is that
Draco flops down on the couch, breathing heavily as he thinks of what to do next. There is no way he’s reaching under the tree to grab the jumper. Once Harry sees his hair a different colour, he’ll want to know why he was disturbing the presents. An
Harry tries for humour, saying, “Well, he’s very pale, wears no clothing at all just like you prefer, and he’s cold to the touch, just like you are right now.”
So he had to settle by going every now and then to nightclubs, trying not to rationalise why he always seemed to pull someone who had dark hair and bright eyes. Even when he had moved into Grimmauld Place so that he could work on the books in that library, Draco hadn’t let himself hope that something could start.
“Oh, Draco, what’s wrong?” Pansy asks, going to sit next to him. She wastes no time in pulling him into a hug. “Why are you hiding here instead of at the opening of Blaise’s new restaurant?”
Pansy takes the jumper from Draco and grimaces. “You wouldn’t last an hour wearing this, Draco.”
Harry rolls his eyes. “You’re just upset because it’s so hot outside and we went shopping the Muggle way. If you’re in that much of a hurry, just put down some bags and reach into my back pocket for the keys.”
“No, I want to know why he wrote,” Harry says.
“There’s an article about Draco in today’s paper. It’s not good news, Harry,” she says quietly as she hands it over.
The funny thing was that were he not infamous, this would not have made the newspaper, much less the front page. It was tabloid fodder and must have been the result of a desperate reporter on a slow news day. This particular photo had been taken three days ago when he was still in Montreal.
“Are you certain?” Draco asks, his voice shaking.
“Not likely,” Draco says, but before he has a chance to open his eyes, a handkerchief is already wrapping around head, courtesy of Harry’s wandless magic.
. Rita Skeeter hasn’t printed anything newsworthy recently and no one believes her. You are the best person for this job.” Harry points to the books and journals on the table. “I’ve seen some of your ideas and think you’ll be a great asset to the shop.”
Draco watches as Harry walks over and places the bouquet on the table, before crouching down next to him. A few flicks of Harry’s wand sends a localised numbing charm on the back of Draco’s knee and he feels no pain when he extends it.
Draco’s voice faltered under Harry’s gaze. He didn’t recall the last time someone had looked at him like he was worth something. He was used to being glared at, spit upon, and sometimes just ignored, but Harry didn’t do any of those things. He had treated Draco as an equal and someone who cared a great deal about him.
“I love you too,” Draco says, right before ending the call. He knows he’s got a wide smile on his face, but he doesn’t care. He’s so happy because Harry’s coming home.
“As fascinating as this conversation is, it seems that Potter’s presence is now required for the bouquet toss.”
Harry’s heart warms at hearing those words and because he can’t help it, he pulls Draco up into a kiss. They break away when they hear Ron’s groan.
“Keep it,” Draco replies, helping Pansy out of the car, closing the door as the driver wishes them a happy Christmas.
Vernon chokes on air, spilling the remainder of his tea on his hands. He yells and curses loudly, waving his hands to try to cool them faster. “Who are you? How did you get in here?”
so I think I’m allowed to do whatever I want,” Draco says, leaning against Harry with one hand pressed possessively against his chest.
Harry doesn’t realise that his voice has become so loud until there’s silence and that everyone within five feet of their table is staring at them. Rose also whimpers in her sleep, but thankfully remains sleeping in Ron’s arms.
“Come on!” Vernon mutters under his breath, but the blond man is still asking the barista many questions about the different types of coffee beans. The barista smiles at the blond man, talking in low tones, and glancing at him from under her eyelashes as a red blush appears on her cheeks.
“Sorry,” Hermione sighed, slumping down into a nearby rocking chair. “You’re right Harry, I know you’ve done nothing wrong. It’s just, I suppose I don’t understand why he would want to keep the baby. I mean, it will ruin his reputation and marriage prospects.”
“I thought you’d have more clothes,” Harry frowned, peering into the closet and seeing only a few hangers occupied. A moment later he could scent that he had embarrassed Draco again and internally cursed himself. “Are you not really into things like that?” Harry ventured.
“How?” came back the whispered question.
Draco stiffened, that had also been his expectation at the start of all this.
The truth was though, having been raised by Sirius, Harry just didn’t see the point in doing anything that wasn’t fun. Staying at Hogwarts had meant more nights like this with his friends, more quidditch and pissing about in Hogsmeade. Even joining the aurors was going to be exciting. Harry knew his magic was powerful and he always itched for opportunities to use it, feel the thrill racing through his veins.
The omega had started shaking, small pink lips open in a silent gasp as he stared at Harry. He wasn’t an obviously stunning omega, in fact Harry didn’t think he had even necessarily clocked the boy’s sex status before. Draco’s skin was white to the point of almost being translucent in places. He had a slightly pointed face and bony looking body. Draco could probably even pass as a very small, somewhat delicate beta. Then again, Harry could never scent betas' emotions, as evidenced by his many blowout arguments with Ginny over miscommunication.
“In a good way?” Harry asked, quirking his eyebrow as he looked up at Draco.
Draco tried to roll his eyes like he had seen Harry’s friends do but secretly his omega was absolutely preening at the praise and attention from his alpha.
“I see Professor Sprout has planted more fairywand this year,” a low and slippery voice came from behind Harry as he sighed. Severus Snape and Harry had been meeting with more begrudging regularity as Draco’s due date approached. Snape had taken it upon himself to research in great detail the best potions to support and aid in labour. Male omegas often found the process quite traumatic and Harry wanted more than anything to avoid any unnecessary pain or discomfort for his mate. Today, however, they were further meeting regarding the matter of Draco’s inheritance and legal affairs. Harry glanced across the lawn to see that Remus had also arrived and was giving his godson a small wave as he approached.
Draco had been revising in the common room the other day, Harry intently watching as the younger boy nibbled on the end of his quill, small pink tongue sticking out in concentration. Harry hadn’t even noticed that he had been emitting alpha pheromones until Luna had politely opened a window. Harry had guiltily looked back to Draco who had smiled shyly from under his lashes.
“I knew she loved Potter,” Snape stated coldly after a few moments silence, “I knew I couldn’t change that. But I just wanted something, I wanted
“I’m supposing you’ve enjoyed your wedding then,” Hermione remarked dryly, pinching her nose with one hand as Harry carefully extracted Lyra from her.
Harry had been paranoid that one of his friends would catch a whiff, feeling incredibly possessive and protective of the forbidden scent. Of course Ginny had cottoned on immediately, sending Harry knowing smirks and waggled eyebrows the entire afternoon. It had irked him but Harry knew that Ginny would be the last person to take an interest in Draco. He had been more worried about her unintentionally embarrassing the younger boy. Harry was already aware that Draco sometimes felt self conscious around the alpha’s friends and he wanted to protect Draco from any teasing.
“You’re not disgusted?” Draco asked, frowning down at the ground.
“Of course,” Harry nodded, wondering why Draco hadn’t yet opened the door fully to him. “I just didn’t want you having to walk through the annexe on your own but I guess everybody’s out tonight anyway.”
“Right,” Colum said, looking unconvinced. “Well I guess I’ll see you back inside then.” With that, the beta walked past Harry and back into the thrumming noise of the club. Harry groaned and leant against the nearest wall, hoping to Merlin no one had pissed on it recently, though in Camden that seemed unlikely.
The boy looked back up at him before breaking into a wide smile, “Congratulations!”
“Cranberry!” he shouted happily to his waiting friends who had their own icicle drinks of blue and green.
“Oh, don’t worry,” Hermione scoffed, “I don’t plan on procreating until I’m at least thirty.”
“Fuck,” Harry muttered, clearly leaving the room a moment later as the door clicked shut, Hermione following him not a minute later, looking very cross.
“You up for it?” Harry asked. “We can apparate from Hogsmeade after breakfast if you’d like?”
When Draco imagined Harry, the insistent press of the alpha’s full lips, the tickling scratch of his stubble, he would find himself growing sticky between his thighs. At these times, Draco would quickly cast several cleaning spells in quick succession, looking furtively around the Slytherin omega dorm and praying that no one had smelled him.
“No,” Draco frowned, “I d-don’t want you to. You look handsome like this.”
“An unmated, pregnant omega?” the woman questioned, her voice cold, “that’s not going to happen Draco. You forget your place, Healer Schmidt will be here tomorrow and that’s final.”
Draco blushed a little at the idea of Harry finding him clutching the alpha’s underwear, so he quickly tucked the pile underneath the pillow on the bed. They were out of sight but the placement still allowed their comforting scent to saturate the area. Draco moved the bedding and clothes around a few times but nothing quite satisfied him. He stood impatiently with his hands on his hips staring at it before diving back in with a plan.
“I’ll do anything,” Draco rasped, his voice hoarse from crying. “I’ll do anything you want Aunt Bella. But I d-don’t want to marry Atherol Sourboll and I – I want my baby.”
“Katie…” Draco fidgeted with the strap of his dungarees, “Could you help me with my clothes?”
“No,” Professor McGonagall agreed. “Being at Hogwarts hasn’t always been easy for the young Mr. Malfoy, I believe he has struggled to make friends here. I fret I should have done more to help him feel secure after presenting as an omega.”
“She could t-take you?” Draco asked, cocking his head and looking almost teasing.
,” Draco said again, “just send me away. I don’t even have the same s-surname as you. No one would know. Please.”
“Didn’t you have a meeting with Professor Tung?” Snape snapped, standing up and brushing himself down, two alarmed and chittering beetles falling out from the folds of his robes.
“Did you dance?” Draco asked, he had never been to a club and had no idea what sort of things happened there.
“So!” Harry said loudly as Snape snapped his mouth shut on whatever blistering retort he’d had ready. “You said there was good news?”
Draco snorted a laugh, “No, Harry is going on to the advanced auror programme. He says we can both work and it will be okay, besides I told you – my role would only be part time.”
On the fifth of August, Harry dressed in an inky black suit and crisp white shirt. He managed to tame his hair into something formal and allowed Luna to pin a sprig of white bouvardia flowers to his button hole. The wedding had been set up at the old stone wizarding house that Harry and Sirius had found in their venue search. The house itself was rather bare, having not been lived in for several years, but the gardens were lush and expansive. It had been constructed in a pale grey stone with large light windows and crawling ivy across the sills.
“What a game,” Seamus announced for about the fifth time that night. Harry grinned in agreement, Gaedere House had absolutely swept the floor with the visiting team from Durmstrang. Three years ago, Harry had felt a little odd donning the house’s purple sporting strip after seven years of Gryffindor red. However, he had quickly grown used to his new allegiance whilst still cheering for the younger years in inter-house games.
“You may rue the day,” Snape smiled dryly, “when he spends it all on ruffles and lace.”
“Just as a p-part time assistant,” Draco explained, “they’re offering apprenticeships to those with the right grades, the owner is big on inventing new elixirs and I thought…” Draco trailed off, biting his lip.
After a minute, he carefully fingered the hem of his gown, slipping his hand underneath and gently cupping himself. Draco remembered how different Harry’s touch had been, warmer and rougher skin. He flushed as he recalled the way Harry had massaged his prick, making it stiff and aching. Draco pressed feather light touches to his balls, the scent of alpha was permeating throughout the nest, saturating all the sheets. Draco closed his eyes tightly as he moved a finger back further and found he was already wet and sticky.
Draco knew that even though it was his first time it shouldn’t hurt due to his omega nature, unless of course the alpha was careless or overly rough. Harry however, was clearly taking his time to worship Draco’s body, seemingly more preoccupied with the omega’s pleasure than his own. It also always helped if the omega had already accepted the alpha’s scent and Draco knew he had fallen in love with Harry’s many months ago.
“Like, I’m sure Gabby or Colum or anyone else at club you think is a bit of alright won’t mind,” Ron stated.
“Yes,” Harry answered forcefully, nuzzling into Draco’s neck and scenting him with calming pheromones. “Let’s go have our baby.”
“You want me to tell you what I thought about?” Harry asked, his voice sounding like he was grinning wickedly and Draco flushed as he tipped forwards with another whine.
“I know,” Harry said firmly. “But the truth is Draco, you’re pregnant with my child.” Harry regretted the way Draco stiffened. “I feel responsible for you even if it was due to a spell. Our lives are going to be connected now whether we planned for it or not and I’d like to get to know you properly.”
Draco smiled as Harry took his hand and led them down to the waters edge, keeping their fingers tightly linked as they posed for the clicks of the camera.
Harry had claimed Draco as his in every possible way, even going so far as to buy him a delicate white gold engagement ring. The alpha had then imbued the band with a host of protection spells, passed down through the Black and Potter families.
Harry narrowed his eyes in realisation. He was a fucking idiot, Damien was clearly flirting with him. The only reason Harry hadn’t noticed was because he had been so distracted worrying about Draco. Harry had also learned over the last couple of weeks that his alpha had really mellowed in certain areas since being around Draco.
Draco looked pleased as he tucked an errant strand of silver blond hair behind his ear.
are you doing?!” Hermione shrieked.
“You’ve finally found a flea spray that works?” Severus asked with a curious, raised eyebrow.
“Ready?” Harry asked, lifting his and Draco’s bags down from the overhead rack.
“Please Mr. Potter, take a seat,” she instructed. Harry positioned himself on a sturdy mahogany chair that was slightly higher than Snape’s. Harry already had a fair few inches on the man and it made him smirk to see Snape having to tilt his head to glare up at him.
“Careful,” Harry murmured softly as he propped Draco back up in the tub so as to stop him slipping under the water. The omega was undressed, apart from cotton grey briefs and a plain bralette. Harry gently laid a wet flannel on his forehead. Draco whimpered at the touch and as the cold drips of water rolled down his red cheeks.
“I c-can’t reach!” Draco let out a frustrated whine, his jerking arm stuttering and slipping. “My bump!”
Draco held his breath as a family of tourists came barrelling towards him with their noses in a large map. A moment later, however, he found himself gently but firmly steered out of their way by Harry. Draco felt his inner omega going embarrassingly giddy as Harry held his arm protectively around Draco’s shoulders and manoeuvred them both through the morning shoppers.
“Bugger you both, I think it’s this way,” Seamus exclaimed, hurrying forwards through a new clearing that had just opened up before it quickly sealed shut behind him.
“Thank you,” Harry shot her a grateful look.
“In the cutlery draw,” Remus nodded.
Draco couldn’t understand why these women were all being so nice to him. He had thought that everybody in Gaedere House would see him as some sort of gold digging little slut.
“No!” Draco repeated more urgently, “People already say I’m…” the omega trailed off as his scent turned embarrassed and he shrunk in on himself.
“You will need to sign here in order to give your permission for the Healer from St. Mungo’s to terminate the pregnancy,” she informed him.
Draco yelped as he found himself thrown backwards, his bottom skidding painfully across the stone slabs as his wand was yanked from his grip. The world started to grow dark as Draco let out hiccoughing sobs of fear, his bump felt bruised, as if something had hit it.
“Merlin yes, Draco,” Harry gasped as the omega moved away from Harry’s own ministrations and instead wriggled across the bed so that his face was inches from Harry’s prick. Harry looked down as Draco cautiously ran his index finger up the shaft, tracing the thickened vein. He glanced nervously up as if expecting Harry to tell him what to do but the older man smiled back, cupping his hand round Draco’s head and stroking his hair. Harry was more than happy to give Draco time to explore and figure it out at his own pace.
In a somewhat startling turn of events, Harry had insisted they buy nearly every outfit Draco had tried on in Olive’s boutique. This meant that over the last month Draco had very much enjoyed locking himself away in the Morgana Suite and trying on all of the delicate items of clothing, marvelling at himself in the mirror.
“I guess you’re right,” Harry replied, “maybe we’ll be good influences on each other then?”
“Not sure,” Harry shrugged, “I was thinking of finding somewhere big enough so Draco and the baby could live with me for a while.”
Draco closed his eyes, he tried to picture himself in a bright sunny room, the sound of the ocean outside. He imagined being sat on a comfortable chair with a warm weight in his arms, grounding him.
“Daddy’s got you,” Harry told him as Draco’s fingers scrabbled on the blankets, his hips were being lifted up with the thrusts. Draco’s own turgid prick slapped wetly against the underside of his belly. Draco looked down between his arms, his bump concealing most of what was happening from view but his breasts were bouncing wildly up and down as Harry fucked into him.
Harry guessed this was the type of person everybody expected him to end up dating. Judging by Ron’s suggestive looks it was at least the type of person they figured he might go home with for the night.
“Only if you wanted,” Harry frowned, “sex shouldn’t be about what you think you
“I’m already getting bonded!” Draco snapped back angrily. His aunt visibly recoiled, he had never raised his voice like that at her before.
Harry got into the tub and looked over at where Draco was watching a lantern rise with glittering eyes.
“Merry Christmas,” Nadia beamed, nodding goodbye as she continued down the corridor with the trolley. The compartment door slid open a moment later as Draco poked his head out.
going to Harry’s godfathers’ for Christmas. Draco couldn’t pretend he wasn’t horribly apprehensive about the whole thing. He had learned that whilst Remus was a beta, he was also a werewolf which really put him in a class of his own. Not to mention that Sirius was an alpha. Draco hadn’t wanted to enquire as to whether Remus and Sirius were bonded to each other, all he knew was that they lived together and had done since Harry had been orphaned.
“Nah,” Ron swallowed a large gulp of his drink, “you know Mione hates clubs. She trusts me though,” he added hurriedly. Harry smiled, his friends seemed to have been doing better recently with Hermione having decided to apply for the one year internship in the States rather than the five year.
“I feel stupid,” Draco said miserably as Harry took a tentative step towards him.
“Yes,” Harry answered decisively. “How have you been managing during the last month of school though?” For some reason the idea of Draco’s peers seeing his current state made Harry’s hackles rise.
About five minutes later, Olive joined them again, rolling her eyes and muttering about Mothers of the Bride wanting last minute alterations.
Harry smirked as Snape seemed to catch himself arguing about something so ridiculous from seven years ago.
“I wouldn’t h-have minded,” Draco said, “only this dress…”
“I didn’t –“Draco began before snapping his mouth shut. He couldn’t let Bellatrix goad him into revealing anything that could harm Harry or be used against them. Thankfully, she seemed to have forgotten about Draco’s explanations of the spell back in October.
“And they are
Draco could barely hide his contempt, Atherol Sourboll was a solid fifteen years older than Bellatrix herself.
^*^*^*^*^
“Molly says they make me look distinguished,” Harry gave his friend a shit eating grin. “What do you think Draco?”
“After the baby’s born,” Harry cleared his throat, “I don’t know what Draco will do. I assume he’ll stay with Snape or something.”
Draco blushed, feeling pleased. He had never been allowed to indulge in his love of clothing before. Aunt Bella always considered anything with extra decoration or, god forbid, lace, as nouveau riche and frivolous.
“Go back to your husband,” Hermione smiled, “I’ll see you in a bit.”
“Sirius did,” Harry cleared his throat, “here, let me show you the rest of it.”
“But did you ever have to get hosed down?” Draco smirked as Harry let out a bright laugh.
The students laughed and a few more offered their congratulations before Harry was finally shooed away by Madam Pomfrey. He wandered back over to Draco’s cubicle and took a seat by the curtains.
“And what was the purpose?” Remus asked thoughtfully.
“Yes, he’s lonely, so you said. But Harry, buy him a sodding cat or something!” Hermione’s voice had gone up an octave and she so rarely swore that even Ron flinched. “You can’t let some seventeen year old omega give birth to your child because you feel sorry for him!”
“Funny you should say that. He grew up with a shit father and Draco thinks he’ll repeat his father’s mistakes. But I disagree,” Harry says as Draco begins laughing as the rocket soars over them in the bright blue sky. Harry turns to look at Dudley. “People change and he is living proof of that.”
“Good morning, Pansy,” Draco replies. “And please lower your voice. Harry finally came home last night and he’s still asleep.”
“I don’t care. I got what I wanted in the end. Now, what did you bring me back from Italy?”
Draco holds his chin stiffly. “I am not. I have refined tastes and I am not a picky eater no matter what Harry claims.”
“I’m glad. I was a bit worried,” Harry says, and Draco frowns. “Don’t look at me like that. I know you can take care of yourself, but that doesn’t mean I don’t worry.”
Draco traces the ivy’s thin stem, remembering how, as a young child, he would walk with his mother around her garden as she pointed out the different flowers and their meanings. If he remembers correctly, ivy symbolises friendship, affection, wedded love, and fidelity.
He had not walked more than a few steps from the kitchen before he heard the scratching of the kitchen chair against the floor. His arm was grabbed from behind, not forcibly to hurt him, but Draco stopped just the same.
Harry takes it as a good sign that Draco’s arm drops by his side, so he continues talking, trying to put all the frantic thoughts in his head into coherent sentences. “Draco, I don’t care about what Skeeter wrote or whatever your father thinks of you,” Harry says. He
“It’s too big without you next to me,” Draco mumbles against Harry’s neck, the rest of his body trembling in his embrace. “I didn’t want to be alone. You were gone for so long I thought you were going to miss my birthday this year.”
“Of course. You took very good care of Mr Finny. After all, five years is a very long time for betta fish to live. I think he had a very happy life with you as his owner.”
Despite his nerves, a smile spreads across Draco’s face. “That’s only because the art of potion brewing is very similar to baking.”
“Lighten up, Malfoy. You can’t be serious all the time now that you work at a joke shop. You have to have a bit of humour if you want to work with us,” George says. “So do you accept?”
“Oh,” Hermione said, her brown eyes gazing at Harry’s. “I thought you liked it here. There are so many opportunities here. You could enter the Auror training programme—I know that you think you wouldn’t be given a fair chance in London, that they would just give you the position when you return.”
