He was therefore completely taken aback when Severus Snape apologized to him. The image of the man looked truly cowed when he was offering sincere apologies. He started apologizing for getting too caught up in his role as a spy, for letting a grudge against his father grow into such a blind prejudice that be missed signs of Harry's abuse, for not doing more.
Draco snorted, "Aunt Andromeda. Harry here has done the impossible once again and is not only Lord Potter-Black. But also Lord Peverell-Slytherin-Gaunt-Selwyn-Prince. A Lord 7 times over."
“Evening Headmistress. Just wanted to thank you again for letting us floo for our errands. We wanted to let you know we returned safely. Aunt Andromeda and Teddy send their regards.” Draco politely said, directing everyone’s attention towards himself.
For the second time that night the entire table just looked at Harry shocked. The purebloods look particularly taken aback. Even Ron looked surprised.
In following years he survived a basilisk, 3 times the length all of the books said it should be controlled by Tom, he survived a werewolf, and fended off 100 dementors. He competed with students already past their magical majority in a death competition where he escaped Voldemort for the 3rd time. He led an uprising through a student army, who he taught better than most DADA teachers until they chased out the toad from hell. He hunted down horcruxes, he was making waves and winning them the war in the shadows. Then in the most absurd situation of all, Harry Potter the Boy-Who-Lived-Despite-All-Odds survived death again.
Harry grabbed Draco's hand and apparated them out front. Watching #12 coming out from hiding brought back some warm memories. "Let's go in. Be quiet in the entryway or Walburga's portrait might wake up."
"Hello Harry. Hello nephew. I was surprised when Kreacher came and informed me that you'd be visiting. He said you'd picked up your rings. Why get them now?" Andromeda smiles at how Teddy is beaming, his gummy smile that only Harry could bring out.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Potter. What's with the face. There's no annoying smile there. What's wrong?" Draco had the strangest way of interacting with Harry. If you didn't know the two better you might assume they still hated each other. But it worked for them, and it made Harry give his first genuine smile since that afternoon.
Grading 4th and 5th grade work is painful some days and really destroys my desire to be creative. Writing has been a fun change from just reading all the time.
"Harry?" Pansy Parkinson said tentatively, she knew Harry forgave her for trying to serve him on a silver platter to give to the Dark Lord. But she still felt quite awful about it now that the stress of dying wasn't there. She sometimes can't believe that Harry said he understood and didn't hold it against her. If he didn't do that, Morgana knows what her life would be like right now.
"Come on Draco. Girls are not going to just up and faint. I'm no Lockhart. Goodbye Sir, Goodbye Professor. We'll come by and see you again I'm sure!" Harry waved cheerfully before walking down the staircase with his companion.
"Yea Pans?" Harry said once he looked up from his sculpture.
Draco must have some sort of seer blood somewhere in his family because the git was right. At first when they walked through the hall it was just silent. All eyes on the pair as they were trying to figure out who the man with Draco could possibly be. They did made a very striking pair. The whispers started quiet and only got louder as they approached the head table to check back in with the Headmistress. Girls were giggling and trying to get glances of Harry as he was now in a more clear line of sight for them.
Poor Severus here has been in that position since he heard. Being told he was your godfather was hard on the lad. He was shocked. So I'm glad you believed him. I truly don't think he knew at all."
"Stop right there Scarhead. What do you mean you're not good at anything else?"
(See the end of the chapter for
He was right there. So close. He could have gone on to the afterlife to see all of his loved ones - all of the family his little heart has desired for years. He was so close to finally get to feel what his mom's hugs felt like. He was so close to getting to know his dad. Really meet the real James Potter and not the version he created in his head trying to balance out Snape vs Sirius' versions of James. He could have seen Sirius again to apologize for causing his dogfather’s death. He wanted it all so much he ached with it. But, Harry knew the war wasn't over and hoped his family wouldn't be too mad at him for not joining them just yet.
Harry straightened. He could do this. Weirder things have happened to him. "Can we go talk to Headmistress McGonagall about when we can go to Gringotts? It sounds like we need to get everything done so we can start lessons as soon as we can, right?" After getting nods from his friends he stood up. Draco followed after Harry.
The walk to the shop on Horizont Alley wasn't too far. They walked into the shop and started looking around for what a 6 month old would like. Mostly sticking with the plush toys, the two got to searching for a gift. Draco plucked out a color changing Dragon from the shelves. "Do you think he'd like this one?"
"Of course! Master Harry must come see little master Edward! Kreacher will tell Mistress Andromeda to be expecting you and young Master Malfoy for lunch."
As the trio sat down and started to make their plates Harry noticed Draco observing him clinically. Blonde eyebrows furrowed with deep thought. Silver eyes narrowed looking him up and down.
"Harry. What do you want to do? That's all you have to write about. Just 10 inches of parchment," Hermione reminds him gently while patting the arm wrapped around her.
"Hello Kreacher." Harry said fondly, he'd not seen the elf so excited. "Yes, we've just gotten my rings and ordered new robes. We thought that while we have the day free still if we could buy some gifts for Teddy before coming to visit. Would that be okay?"
"Come come Scarhead. It's much comfier. They don't bunch up. They're quite traditional as well. Your elves would approve."
Raising an eyebrow, "Want to bet one of your elves will make a comment? Kreacher is a Black elf, he probably will approve of you finally dressing more Pureblood. And you have Father's old elf Dobby. Dobby would be ecstatic that you're dressing the part as well, if only because you look healthier. I've never met Winky. But I'm sure your old pairs offended her sensibilities as well."
Harry found a nice wolf plush that reminded him of Remus. He decided on the toy and then they found a few books and clothes that would fit him as well. Once they paid they were all set to go to Grimmauld.
“....MR. POTTER!?” Minerva shouted in an uncharacteristic display of emotion. Jaws dropped all around the great hall when they realized the handsome stranger was indeed Harry Potter.
"Are you planning to have a baby Scarhead?" Draco asked incredulously.
Harry shook his head, "I'm not that good compared to professionals but I'd make any team I tried out probably because of my name... I don't want to take away a position from someone who's better than me and deserves it."
Harry Potter enchanted all who heard, weaving the story about how a young boy who loved his father did what he thought was right. He took the mark as the only way he knew to protect his parents who he loved deeply. And even when he had the chance to improve his standing for Voldemort, he didn't take it. Draco Malfoy did not kill Albus Dumbledore, he did not give Harry away at Malfoy Manor despite knowing it was him, and having Draco's wand helped Harry win the war.
Harry looked so overwhelmed, Draco softened. Well, maybe he had something to offer Harry right now after all. "Well. Though not ideal to have less than a year to catch you up on a lifetime of Pureblood lessons. You won't be completely lost. After all. You have the whole lot of us." Draco gestured to all of his friends who had received parts or all of those lessons growing up.
Andromeda smiled warmly at the boys in front of her. Harry was such a good soul. She was so happy to have him in her life. Losing Dora, Remus, and Ted were hard for her. But Harry and Teddy were what kept her going. And with the way her nephew was staring at Harry, Draco would more than likely become a more permanent fixture in her home.
"Potter! You are hopeless! Give me those!" The blonde rushed to grab them with a scowl and walked away to go pick out more suitable pairs.
"Are there any other shops we need to go to? Anything else that you need Harry?" Draco asks as he shrinks Harry’s bags for him.
"Well Draco. I'm having a crisis, I never thought I'd make it this far with old Noseless being obsessed with me and I have no idea what to do with my life. I’m not really that good at anything. Whatever job I apply for will hire me for my name alone. I’ve already gotten offers to go straight to the DMLE, but the idea of being an auror gives me nightmares..... So. You see. There lies my problem. My only life experience is fighting megalomaniacs and surviving out of dumb luck. The one job I’m sort of good at is the one I don’t want. I’m trying to figure out what to do with my life without any real skills." At some point Harry started to ramble off but no one could hear any of the words.
Completely focused on his sculpture that was starting to quite resemble his favorite house elf, he didn't notice everyone at the table looking at one another. They were all at a loss for what to do.
She smiled at him and wrapped the package beautifully. Happy to see the 2 boys getting along better this time around.
"Ah. That would be from myself, Hadrian." Phineas Nigellus Black's portrait said while waving at them. "I had felt a burst of family magic and went to the ancestral home to seek the cause when I overheard you telling Andromeda of your inheritance results. I came back and properly yelled at Albus on your behalf after hearing that the old goat didn't tell you about your Lordships.
"Hi Andi. It's good to see you too. I didn't actually know about my titles until yesterday at dinner. We went to Gringotts first thing this morning." Harry tells her while still playing with Teddy.
“Oh, ‘Potter’ is it again?”
“If you don’t like it, don’t drink it.”
“You’re the one that spoke at his trial.”
He was gone from the frame before either Draco or Potter could say goodbye. Or thank you.
Harry gave her a weak smile, and tried not to think about how he’d given the go ahead for Ron to be on the stakeout team for the Hampshire case over the weekend. He tried to focus. Draco. She wanted to know about Draco. That was, after all, why he had come to see her.
“And that year was hard, Harry. Hogwarts wasn't a nice place to be. And then... Lavender—” she shuddered, and bit down on thin lips, as she remembered, “—and Fred.” She gave the sad little smile she always did when she thought of her brother. “You came back, and this time you were everyone's hero. I know how much you've been through, I do, and how much you still carry with you. How much we needed this, us, at first.”
It had been a surprise then, two weeks into term, to see her walk in at breakfast to join the eighth-year table. Parallel pink scars dragged down one side of her face, and she held the right side of her body tightly. When she turned and the scars were hidden, the other side of her face seemed the same as before - almost the same: her softness had changed into something leaner, hollower.
“Harry, what are you, five? You can survive one year without decorating the tree yourself. And I might do a good job. You never know.”
“I am capable of being nice, too, you know.”
Malfoy broke into a grin. All of a sudden he looked nothing like his father, but reminded Harry instead of Sirius. He supposed they were cousins of some sort, after all. “It isn’t, but I enjoy winding you up. You go a little beetroot-y about the ears.”
Harry glared at Ron. “Yes, I know all the reasons your sister decided to dump me, thanks, Ron.” He knew how sharp and angry he sounded, but he couldn’t help it: Ron’s words had managed to release all the feelings of resentment he’d been trying so hard to ignore. “She was quite clear about them. I don’t really want to go through them all again, if you don’t mind.”
“No.” Draco spoke before he had time to think what he was saying. “No, nothing.” He didn’t want the Ministry poking around in his mind. And there was no way he wanted to talk about the fact that it was
“No. I’ve heard my brother and Harry talking about you.”
“They’re for you. We never have enough time for each other, and I wanted to show you…” Draco broke off and ran a hand through his hair. “I don’t think I can find the words for this. Would you…?”
Harry looked up. George was walking down the street, a bag tucked under his arm.
“Where was I?” Malfoy said, running his hand down his list.
“I know that,” said Harry quietly. He tried to put some of his sadness, guilt, anger, and regret into his words; he wanted her to hear him. “I carried that with me every day, I promise you. I still do.”
“Ha! That’s one way to put it. Another would be that some of that stuff had crests and the like on them. No big names or anything, but a lot of them didn’t say ‘Snettisham’ at all.”
"Yes I can, and please don't interrupt, Potter. Not only is it terribly rude, some of this is quite complex and I'd rather you didn't disrupt the flow of my explanation." Harry clamped his mouth shut, exaggerating the gesture, and Malfoy rolled his eyes before continuing. "As I was saying, I will show you the wards, as I am fairly sure that you're not actually that familiar with them," he paused. "Correct?"
"I don't want to mess it up. I– I think I'd quite like to be friends." Malfoy's words filled Harry with a swell of warmth.
“Don’t look so serious! You’re going to sell all my pots and we’re going to drink more beer. It’ll be fine.”
Harry had plenty of ideas about how he could distract Draco - he often thought of them, late at night in his bed with the curtains drawn and his hand wrapped around himself. He shifted, and Draco raised a knowing eyebrow at him but said nothing.
He found himself in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, shying away for a second from the din of all the school eating breakfast, mountains of eggs and bacon and toast on each table. The hall looked strange for some reason, and then Harry realised that it was because he was standing next to the Slytherin table. And there was Draco, sitting, quiet and unhappy-looking, amongst the bustle of his friends.
“I… I don’t understand,” Harry said. “I don’t understand about why you’d have those cards.” It was one of the questions that had kept him up all night. No matter what he thought, he couldn't quite escape it.
"You know the one that I mean," said Harry. "The first one you do. Before the Blue one." Malfoy sighed.
you a part of itself?" Draco asked, utterly shocked.
Harry kept the pace fast: he knew he wanted to tell them everything, but he couldn’t find the words, not yet. Soon he began to feel warm, and realised how fast he was going. He slowed a bit.
Draco ran through his options. He could look through some popular curses. He was sure he had a book somewhere, with curses to make your bits fall off; a gift from his father in all likelihood. The curse might not have manifested itself yet, but at least he knew that it cast a blue light. Draco collected what he could find on his bookshelves, then read until he could barely keep his eyes open. As sleep began to pull him down, Draco could barely hear the small voice in the back of his mind, whispering about terrible possibilities. His last thought as he drifted off was that he had already had the misfortune to live through one nightmare. He could deal with a curse, no matter what it did.
Potter held his lips clamped tight, but Draco could see the laughter working its way up. He sighed as it bubbled up, Potter laughing until there were tears in his eyes.
“Not really, but at the same time it’s green, it’s growing. I loved Herbology at school. All that life, teeming and pushing through in the most surprising of ways.”
“But your visions—”
Together, they joined Ron and Hermione.
"Relax," hissed Malfoy as they walked in. "No one will know you here." Harry was surprised that Malfoy knew how much he hated being spotted, but then he saw just how stiffly Malfoy was holding up his head; and it occurred to him that Malfoy thought that Harry didn't want to be seen with
shrieked Mrs Black,
Harry felt a flood of relief at having finally spoken the words aloud, and at the same time deep anxiety at how they would be received. The contradiction between the two left his stomach in knots.
“It’s hard!”
"I don’t care about making you feel better. I care about having my space – my own space, with no one else in it—"
“Ponds?” Draco imagined a muddy pond complete with toddlers feeding the ducks. “Sounds... lovely.”
Malfoy’s mouth curled up in a small smile, although Harry could still see strain around his eyes.
“Those two are frightening,” Draco said. “I think between them they are going to end up taking on the Wizengamot - no; the whole Ministry.”
“Why can I hear shouting?” Snape called out. “And you better have some clothes on now.” He walked back into his painting, his hands over his eyes. When he peered out from between his fingers, he groaned. He looked at Potter accusingly. “You said you hadn’t brought him here for a sordid tryst!”
Potter paused mid-bread-saw, and shrugged. "It’s hard not to wake up, when I’m already outside."
“I would have had to have kept going until I had a son.”
"Maybe… the first time you asked me to talk to them. When you were here doing the curse-breaking. I just… even then…" said Harry, a little lamely. Draco looked as if he were wavering between wanting to roll his eyes and wanting to kiss Harry. He seemed to make his mind up as he reached for Harry and pulled him close.
Draco realised that Potter was standing with Sarah, and they were both looking at him. He cleared his throat. “Ask me what, exactly?”
He’d definitely found the bathing pool, then.
“I hadn’t,” said Potter. He gave Draco a sly look. “Well, not that time.”
Betrayal crossed Potter’s face. "Are you even apprenticed to him?"
“Sorry.” Harry felt his cheeks heat as he hid behind the magazine, but when he dared another look, Malfoy had stopped frowning and was smiling to himself.
The press had run daily stories about the disappearance of their golden boy, but after a few months, it was only weekly, and once a few years with no news of Potter had passed, it was only the occasional piece wondering where’d he’d gone. Draco had bought every edition at the beginning, scouring the lines for some clue about what had happened to Potter. And every time he’d seen one of Potter’s friends, he’d wondered what they knew. Once he had even tried to ask Granger but she had looked blankly at him and said she was sorry. The acrid burn of bile rose in his throat, and Draco swallowed.
“Karen.” She didn’t look annoyed, luckily, more amused, than anything else.
"I’m not hugging a tree," Draco said. Potter had looked ridiculous.
"Both," said Draco, nuzzling at the fabric.
The next day, Draco’s third patient of the morning left a copy of
“Did it work?”
As the door closed behind them a flurry of heavy flakes began falling through the still night air; the world became darkness interspersed with yellow cones of light and whirling snowflakes under a row of streetlights, before everything settled into a blanket of calm.
"Of course, when you ran off."
Harry woke early - his body was still confused as to what time it was after their trip away - and heard George rise around six.
Neville didn’t talk much about his last year at school, but when he did it had sounded pretty grim. And now he was all friendly with Malfoy? Harry didn’t understand. Rather than reply, he turned round and tried to cast the spell again, the words coming out more forcefully than strictly necessary. Sometime after his fourth or fifth attempt he realised that Ron had left the room.
why they were so worried when you left!" It made sense now, of the way it had been splashed so much across the headlines. It had felt like too much, even for the Chosen One. If the Ministry had known Potter had left his wand behind, they would have assumed the worst.
Sometimes Draco liked to imagine that a particularly stubborn baked-on section was someone or something that had pissed him off. To be frank, working in this kitchen it could be anyone, or anything. He scrubbed harder, and was rewarded with a clean and shiny pan. Until he turned it, and saw a corresponding brown patch on the other side.
“Everyone says that,” Snape said. “You’re the first Slytherin that Potter here has brought home though.” His face fell and his eyes darted over to Potter. “He hasn’t brought you home for some sordid tryst, has he? You two aren’t—”
"You make it sounds as though you’re wearing long johns," Potter said with a laugh. "Unbutton yourself! You could do with relaxing a bit."
It was fascinating, watching Malfoy at work. Harry wasn't bored anymore, his fidgeting frustrations of the day before almost forgotten. Malfoy would make a neat record of whatever he was looking at, and then set the parchment aside and perform what Harry decided to call the Pink spell, which enveloped it in a pink bubble, then the Blue spell, in which a small ball of blue light entered the head, or chair, or portrait, rattling it around before exiting with a pop and disappearing.
It was impossible to buy a cup of coffee without the risk of getting bonded to a complete stranger – a Muggle, at that – so Harry had to forego his Monday coffee. He Flooed directly to the Atrium, and made his way through the still-empty Ministry. When he’d woken up that morning, the sky outside had been low and grey, and it looked like it would be one of those days filled with endless drizzle that did little to lift the spirits. Harry wanted to go out into the field; he’d finished all his paperwork, and wasn’t quite sure what work was left. Something horrible and boring, he was sure.
“Did you mix borage and ginger?” Hermione asked. “Or was it essence of asphodel? That would turn your hair green, if you stepped into the fumes.”
Harry nodded.
"Hey!" Harry said, and elbowed Draco in the side. Draco glared at him.
“So with Muggles, they have similar scarring issues. When I was growing up, I saw all kinds of scars. It was only when I went to Beauxbatons that I learned that things like limb amputation didn’t have to be permanent.” Celeste flexed the fingers of her right hand. “I once fell off my broom and had to have the bones of this hand regrown. If it had been not an accident, but a curse though, I would have lost the hand. Like a Muggle.”
“You get to bring in Mrs Snettisham!” Potter said, dragging his eyes away from Draco, who missed them immediately. “Don’t pretend that won’t be good for your career.”
“You better not be sick on me.”
“I’m supposed to feel sorry for you? Please. You’re on the winning side, I’m not going to pity you.”
"Brown."
“The best thing to do is not to stand, but to swim,” said Harry, and he pushed away, launching into a confident front crawl.
And then there was Harry. He knew now that it was simple: where Harry was, that could, would, be home.
“All?” Henry looked lost. “Broke?”
It wasn’t a problem to work with Malfoy. The opposite: Harry hoped his happiness wasn’t too transparently written on his own face. He was accustomed to working with Malfoy, and had a good feel for his magic.
"Good, good," muttered Malfoy, but his eyes were already scanning the walls, for what, Harry didn't know. "This will be easier without house-elf magic complicating things," he added. Harry felt pretty redundant as Malfoy began casting a range of spells. He recognised the first one or two — they detected traces of different kinds of magic, and the Aurors used them sometimes — but then they grew more complex. Harry swore lightly under his breath as a cascade of purple stars fell down the wall.
"How did you find all the names?" asked Harry. "I'm guessing that there aren't many references to them left in the house."
“It’ll be easy,” Draco said.
“I—” Draco stopped. Henry had a point. “I’m a quick learner. And look at these hands,” he flexed his fingers in front of him, “these are the hands of an artist! I should be fine.”
“Sorry.” Draco curled his fingers over Harry’s for a second, and Harry squeezed back. “I’m just… I can’t do this with words.” He sounded miserable, but Harry still pulled away his hand, unsure about how he felt about everything and needing a moment to try to figure it out.
"Okay, just don't—" Harry stopped as Malfoy took a Galleon, and immediately pointed his wand at it.
“Are there specialist Bludger and Quaffle makers, too, then?”
Once Draco had eaten, though, he began to feel much better. He sat back and looked around at the ivy-covered walls and group of middle-aged wizards with pints in the corner. “I don’t recognise this place: I thought I knew all the wizarding places in Britain.”
“So why are you two joined at the hip now?” said Pansy. “That is, if you’re not shagging, what
“He said his name,” Ron said, in a lull in their talking.
“Mother’s family.”
“It’s beautiful,” Harry said. “And I don’t think I need to tell you to make yourself at home.” He smiled. “You’ve already done it.”
Now it was Draco’s turn to squirm. "I…"
“It connects a group of objects, Charms them to change for a purpose. And it’s the act of making identical objects that means we are learning this part in your class, Professor. Changing the objects after this is more Charms-based.”
“We’ve got sole use of the bathroom on this floor,” Harry said. “Although having said that, sometimes one of the others will come down here if the one upstairs is busy—”
“And acted like a total idiot,” Draco said. He looked Harry up and down, seeming to linger on his hair and, rather bizarrely, his legs. “I’ll guess you’ll do if your dress robes are decent enough.”
Malfoy’s eyes were wide when they met Harry’s. “It is?”
“It’s good to see you, too,” Draco said. “You look”—his mouth parted a little as he took a little breath in—“rather tanned.”
“Well, go then,” she said. “You go be with your love. And yes, thank you very much, Harry Potter. I think I will live here, with Teddy.”
“The family appear to have been rather eclectic in their purchases in the past,” said Potter. Draco stared: since when did Potter use words like ‘eclectic’?
As the final notes died and the crackle of the fire filled the room once more, Draco opened his eyes. Potter was still standing with the violin under his chin, his face still tender from the playing. Draco cleared his throat, feeling he needed to say something to break the spell. It would do no good for Potter to know just how much his music-making affected Draco.
Hermione was patient with his Firecall asking if she knew any spells to sex an owl. It might have had something to do with the fact that Hermione was staying at the Burrow, and Molly was insisting that she and Ron had separate rooms. Hermione’s face went a strange shade of red whenever Harry said the word ‘sex’, so he tried to fit it into the conversation as many times as he could. He wasn’t sure he wanted to see what colour Ron would turn.
“Uncle Harry!”
Harry thought to his old longing for Ginny, and how different and yet the same this felt. “I… I think you’re a lemon sherbet, and all of this is just the wrapping,” he said, touching Draco’s arm.
“I know, I can feel it worked.”
“Thank you,” he said quietly.
“I’m not good at this.” Pansy smoothed her hands over her lap. “Look, I was scared. I did something stupid, very publicly. I’m sorry. And I’m glad you defeated He-who-shat-on-all-our-lives.” She gave him the knife-edge look again. “That’s it. I’m not grovelling, and I’m not having this conversation again.”
“You have an answer for everything, but it isn’t as simple as that.”
It wasn’t
“You can’t expect everything to come easily.”
Eventually though, they ran out of things to say, because there was one thing that they weren’t talking about at all.
“I don’t really want to talk to anyone about this.” Draco saw again the slide of limbs and fingers dipping into creases and hollows. He crossed his legs beneath the table. “Er, you know, ex-Death Eater. Hero of the Wizarding World. You didn’t see how those Aurors were with me. The older one practically sneered at my arm before they’d asked me a single question. No one’s going to listen, and no one’s going to help me.”
Draco dropped his spoon. He turned, and frowned. “As are you.” They stared at each other, neither speaking, as the whistle of the self-boiling kettle filled the room.
“Is it just tonight,” Harry said, “that you’re awake in the middle of the night?”
"Malfoy."
Draco nodded.
”, and a white cloud of mist erupted from the tip of his wand. It almost had a shape now, a roundness that puffed out then floated up before disappearing.
"How much do you know about wards?" Malfoy asked.
It took some effort to maintain the spell, and Harry quickly tired, the Doppelganger fading from sight. When he looked back at Draco, there was still a small smile on his face.
“I’ll forgive you the smugness as you’ve bought me pie.” Ron sprayed a bit of pie crust onto the table, and he wiped his mouth before continuing. “You win; buying my lunch was a masterstroke. Now tell me why you’re in such a good mood.”
“Yes?” Draco remembered again the echoes of the hall on the long walk to his trial; he could almost smell the dank air of Azkaban.
. Harry had met too many Scrimgeours, Fudges and Umbridges to trust someone just because they out-ranked him.
The sun was behind Malfoy - or whoever it was - making his pale hair glow. It twisted, like a knife in the gut. How Harry had hated Malfoy over the years. He’d always stood out amongst all the other students, in the Great Hall, in classrooms, in the air. Even now Harry felt the old pull, the familiar need to know, and wondered what Malfoy could be doing leaning out over a railing in the middle of London.
“Ye-es,” Harry said, looking between the two of them. Hermione was picking at a worn patch on the sofa’s arm.
“I bet any clay left will wash off within five minutes of sticking your hands in those giant sinks at work.”
"Sorry," he said. "I didn't mean that. I can honestly see that you two are happy. And any home that has this many books
Potter stopped walking, jostling Draco with his umbrella-holding hand. Someone swore behind them, then walked around still muttering to themselves about idiots on the pavement. Potter did seem sometimes to find it difficult to walk and talk. “You’re very highly respected, you know.”
“Oh yes. David Inkledrum, who also—”
The attic felt smaller and smellier than it had before, now that they'd had a walk outside. Harry was glad that they'd had a break though, because it was easier for him to cast a new Fenestra Charm than to have to maintain the first one all day.
Malfoy gave him a flat look. "I'm only trying to help," he said, in his blandest voice. But then his face shifted into something more...
Potter led him to the door at the back of the room, beside the fire, which led to a bedroom, containing a bed at the centre of the back wall, a green and purple curtained-off wall to the left, and a small desk and chair by the single window to the right. The entire room was leaf-shaded and cool.
Draco led Potter through the maze of Alfies Antique Market until he reached a dark corner. Silver goblets, cups and tureens shone dimly on the shelves. A thin man stepped out from the shadows.
Kreacher quivered and his face transformed into the grimace that was his smile. “It was an honour after you stood for the house-elves.”
This made Harry laugh. "Not yet. No. But I do have a godson. Teddy Lupin. He's living with his grandma, your Aunt Andromeda, since his parents passed. I want to get him some gifts."
When the 8th years walked into the Great Hall a united front, they sent a message. Standing amongst the Slytherins was the Golden trio making sure they gave disapproving looks before anyone could even think to boo. The 8th years had their own table where they sat completely intermingled. All 8th years, no matter which house, sat together with warm smiles and an air of genuine civility.
"They're at 12 Grimmauld Place in Sirius's old house. I figured they could stay there where Kreacher could help them out. The house looks much better than it used to. Your mom probably remembers the house growing up."
Watching Harry feed Teddy warmed Draco's heart. Harry would be a wonderful parent. He never thought about being the one to carry the babies, but the idea was becoming rapidly more appealing. Being the bearer for his and Harry's children. Children that would look like a perfect combination of both of them.
Slowly Harry adapted how he could. He tuned out the drivel of being "Undesirable No.1" where he was called a liar. He tuned out the criticism as much as he could for not doing enough, because he felt like that too. But he also tuned out all of the praise - even those that were well deserved.
The two men walked into the flat quietly and made their way in through to the kitchen where they assumed they'd meet Andromeda and Teddy. Teddy saw Harry before Andromeda did. Making some baby noises, shouting in happiness at seeing a familiar face. Harry was relieved that Teddy could still recognize him even after his odd growth spurt.
"Mate. What about quidditch? You're a bloody good seeker!" Ron offered brightly.
"Uh huh..." Harry was trying to take this all in. Yet another thing Dumbledore decided to keep from him because he probably thought Harry wouldn't live long enough for it to matter. Morgana help him because he had a headache. ‘Deep breaths Harry,’ he thought to himself. "Dumbledore was my magical guardian but this is the first time I'm hearing about any of this. I didn't even think about my dad being a Lord... Wait. Sirius was Lord Black... Draco. What does it mean if Sirius left me everything in his will?!”
Harry reached out at Teddy who was making grabby hands at his godfather. "Hello Teddy Bear! How's my favorite little godson?" Harry cooed while tickling the baby in his arms.
"Harry. We've all done the lessons. We know what you need to know. We can help tutor you! And even though not all of us prepared to take over our family's lordships Draco, Theo, and I definitely have. We could do it together." Neville said. Both Theo and Draco nod in agreement.
"Of course lad. You've already redeemed House Black as it is. The studies will come naturally. It's in your blood after all. You'll do all of your bloodlines proud." Severus nodded his approval as Headmaster Black assured Harry.
Draco seemed to perk up as he was ordering clothes for Harry. They got him the basic school robes. Some formal robes that Draco swore he'd need for some of his Lordship duties. A few casual pieces of daywear for when he wasn't wearing his uniform. New shoes. A new winter cloak. And embarrassingly enough, new underwear as well.
The boy, who despite being the universe's outlet for misfortune, still thought of others first. Albus Dumbledore may have fought for his "greater good", but Harry Potter truly fought for good. The good of all, especially those who are less fortunate were sacred to the dark haired teen. He would apparently even sacrifice himself if it meant the safety of those he loved.
Draco turns his head to look at him. They are lying so close their faces are nearly touching. "I... I know what it is to fear sleep," he says. There is a silence, punctuated only by their breathing.
“Whatever you say, Malfee.” He chanced a side-glance at Draco. Pink spots marked his cheeks.
“It turns out that her father-in-law was the thief. When she married into the family, I think he recognised a kindred spirit. Ron said that she confessed to having been selling off the contents of the house for years, but that she hadn’t stolen any of the pieces herself.”
He’d never admit it, but starting his Monday with tea was a relief. It wasn’t that he didn’t like coffee, but more that each sip of tea was hugely comforting. It made him think of Hagrid and Hogwarts, of stolen moments when the Dursleys were out, and of the familiar warmth of Grimmauld Place. He loved that he had somewhere to call home, somewhere that was his. And tea was part of it: a hot pot of tea in the kitchen on a day like this was a wonderful thing.
“Harry here wants a second opinion,” Sarah said.
They walked back the way they came, and this time, Draco noticed
"I missed you," Harry said. "Do you have an idea what a mind fuck that was? I have spent years accepting and being proud of how I live here alone, and then I’ve spent every day since you left pining after you, wishing I wasn’t alone. Poor Ron and Hermione, I think it was a bit of dampener on their holiday."
At this point the kettle decided to interrupt with its piercing whistle, and Potter jumped. “Sorry,” Draco said. “I got the loudest kettle I could find. Sometimes I put it on and run downstairs to check on something, and I’ve been known to forget all about tea.” This time it was Draco’s turn to feel his cheeks heat, thinking about the time he’d nearly burnt the place down. Of course, that had been while Ramsbottom had lived in the flat, and he’d merely been the lowly apprentice. Very lowly, that day.
“Who did?” Harry said, but Hermione was quicker than him.
“I didn’t know this place existed,” said Potter.
They turned to see what he was looking at. Millicent was in the doorway leading to the girls’ rooms, her shoulder-length brown hair now close-cropped: she did indeed look completely different.
"Oh." Draco felt his hopes sink, ready to crash out of sight.
“Miaow,” said the Greg-cat.
“Not much.” Draco would have loved to, but he’d have needed someone to play against. “How about you?”
Not knowing what else to say, Harry popped his own sweet in his mouth. The sharp sour-sweet of the sherbet lemon caught Harry by surprise, as it always did. He touched the sweet with the tip of his own tongue, thinking that this was what the inside of Draco’s mouth tasted like right now.
Harry was left with a horrible knot in his stomach as he walked back to the empty eighth-year rooms. That wasn’t what he’d wanted at all. But then he didn’t really know what he’d been wanting or expecting. Whatever it was, it certainly hadn’t included Malfoy feeling humiliated. He’d have to find some way to fix this.
"I have yet to see anything to disprove one of my theories," she said.
A broom,” Harry said flatly. “I think Muggles know a thing or two about having to clean with their tools alone. I bet this one works better than yours.”
“I’m not tense. Just...” Draco couldn’t meet Harry’s knowing eyes. “I’m always like this: I’m a finely tuned individual. I’m in a constant state of alertness.”
Draco stubbed his cigarette out on the windowsill and Vanished it. His room was cold now, so he cast a warming charm before getting into bed. He fell asleep more quickly than he had in years, and dreamed of lips on the edge of a wineglass, rough fingers on the slender neck of a violin, and music to lift his soul.
“I am still here, you know.”
"Look," said Malfoy, performing the Blue spell again, "see the pattern it makes as it flickers? I've learnt the key patterns for all the common curses." Harry hadn't noticed any difference between this series of blinks and any of the others. "Anyway, my issue is that I can remove the curse, but unfortunately it will probably destroy the statuette. If you prefer it can be stored, but the curse will remain."
“I thought that it would be a good idea for you to see Harry,” she said.
With aching legs and tired smile, Harry walked to the Apparition point tucked down one of the side streets, ducking behind some scaffolding, and Disapparated. There were always advantages to magic, and he’d never want to be without it.
“Not here!” Draco called out in alarm. He moved in front of the table, and steered the man in the direction of the public toilets at the edge of the square. Thank Merlin they were there, although to be honest at the moment he didn’t care if the man pissed against a wall somewhere; just as long as it wasn’t on Henry’s pottery.
“Can we have the biscuits now?” Teddy asked, a naked look of possible-joy on his face.
A spark and a crackle drew Draco’s attention to his side, where a small fire was burning. Sparks flew up into the night sky, and the heat was welcome in the dark night. As Draco scrambled to pull the blanket over himself – the fire only heated one side of him – he saw the man sitting on the other side of the fire. Dancing flames were reflected in round lenses, and there again was that mop of hair. A messy bird’s nest of hair that Draco hadn’t seen in years.
“I better do some shopping,” Harry muttered while rooting around in the bottom of Molly’s basket. He tried not to linger on the thought that it had only taken him three days to start talking to himself.
Harry had left the Room without any of the soot and grime of the previous term, but a part of him wished he hadn’t. There was no denying that splashing around in the Prefects’ bathroom had been… exciting.
“That doesn’t matter now. I… what I’m trying to say is that I make just enough to get by – I sing, and I make and sell pots locally.”
The Floo flaring to life broke his train of thought, and Draco tensed. With effort, he forced himself to relax, pushing his shoulders down and attempting to order his face along calm lines.
. The words were unsaid, but hung between them anyway.
Malfoy had reached out his hand, as though to grab Harry’s wand hand. “You missed out a syllable, and your grip… you look like you’re about to drop your wand.”
“Well, there must be a charm to reveal if someone’s real or not. Otherwise it would be banned, I reckon.”
“See?” Blaise said. “Silly. He thinks what we do is silly. He is ashamed.”
Harry blushed. He was not going to be talking to Hermione about what he wanted to do to Draco.
Draco stared at her. “Who is?” He looked at the patient list for the day. “James Perkins?”
“What you don’t know about Draco,” Blaise said in a conspiratorial whisper that could be heard by everyone, “is that he is terribly competitive. He’s banned from watching Mastermind or University Challenge.” He shuddered. “Believe me, you don’t want to see what happens when he does. Poor Dudley.”
“If you think that was showing off, those visions of yours were way off the mark.”
Draco handed over his cup and watched as Potter threw the used coffee grounds under the trees, then set up a fresh filter over his cup. It was only once they both had cups of coffee in their hands and Potter was sat beside Draco that he continued.
She looked between the two of them, sighed and nodded.
Draco rubbed his fingers across his palm, the skin rasping and catching it was so dry and cracked. He had always prided himself on having good hands: clean nails, well-trimmed, and soft hands. He opened his eyes and looked at the rough red, blistered in places. Henry was off at market, and Draco was free to do as he wanted. Well, free apart from the fact that he had no money and couldn’t return to Malfoy Manor.
“I am, sometimes. Other times I’m sad. And I guess whatever looks like serious to you,” he added. “Will you think about what I said?”
People’s names were important, Harry realised. He remembered how it had felt when Malfoy had called him Harry. When Draco had. It was still new thinking of Malfoy as Draco, and Harry had to make an effort to do so. But each time he did, it got a little easier.
He knows that he is sharing with Potter because McGonagall thinks that Potter's probably the only one who won't try to kill him in his sleep. Bizarrely, he can see the truth in this belief. He remembers the firm grasp of a hand and being pulled from the flames, and this outweighs everything that came before. Between them though, lies this absence of words, this silence.
“You’re a special case. And besides, I might call you scruffy but I haven’t tried to kill you recently, have I?”
“And that is the gift of a good lead,” Draco said. He looked calm, but his chest was rising and falling quicker than normal. “All you have to learn is how to do that by next week.”
“I’ll take that resoundingly enthusiastic response as the best you can do. Perhaps it’s just the thought of having to tame some of your scruffiness,” Malfoy said.
The relief as he peed cleared Harry’s head a little. Draco, stood beside him, staring ahead and still pale. Without thinking about it, Harry glanced down, at Draco holding himself, shaking off the last few drops of liquid. Immediately, Harry closed his eyes: he had a rule. No looking at work. No looking at colleagues. It was the drink, and he should just focus on what he was doing. Not look at Draco’s penis, or the way his fingers—
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “When you linked them, the walls, those lines… they
“I need to ask you a favour, Harry.” Kingsley stopped pacing. “We’ve currently got a young man sitting in a room not too far from here. He’s helped us a tremendous amount, but we’re finding it hard to guarantee his safety.”
Light reflected from the water moved in ever-changing lines on the rocks by the water. It seemed right that Harry went by this childish name, as he really didn’t care how he was seen.
Vanishing their piles of debris was definitely more satisfying than sweeping. They walked around the room Vanishing all the larger pieces of rubble.
"Feel them?" asked Harry.
He saw again pink skin and bubbles, and closed his eyes as though that would help shut out the sight. Maybe it wasn’t him
“In poverty.”
“Thanks.” Harry shook himself and stood up. “I’ll make some more tea.” He left his friends whispering on the sofa, but he didn’t care, because he knew that after this he was going to see Draco, and that made everything all right.
“Er, yes. I do. Drink, er, tea.” Potter’s face pinked up.
When Draco still didn’t move, Potter swam up close.
“But he works as a wine merchant! What does it matter?” Draco was shaking now. Why was the world full of such vindictive idiots? Why did his past always have to ruin everything? He answered Goosander’s next few questions without really paying much attention. He had been stupid to hope for anything: with Harry, with anyone. He could never escape the consequences of his past.
“Kreacher, meet Draco Malfoy. Malfoy, this is Kreacher.”
“Near enough: the hills and that lake are his, too. And the woods.”
Weasley looked up, and there was a sharpness to his gaze that Draco hadn’t been expecting.
Felix walked into the room, padding around the coffee table, his back slightly arched as he studiously ignored each person he walked past. He settled against Hermione, who gave him a soft smile, rolling into a comfortable shape as the room began to rattle.
“I’d rather not.” Harry yawned again. “Do you mind if I turn off the light?”
“Pansy.” He nodded. “So who are we meeting?”
“Draco,” Hermione said, not taking her eyes off him. “How
“So, what? You just wanted an excuse to mock—”
“You look more relaxed,” Draco said.
Ginny and Luna had met them on the main staircase, and it was still painful enough to be near Ginny for Harry to prefer walking ahead with Ron and Neville. Once they got caught up on the topic of Muggle telly - it didn’t hold the same interest for him - Harry dropped out of the conversation and upped his pace. Soon he’d left the slow-moving group of eighth and seventh years, and walked the rest of the way alone.
Draco nodded, then watched Potter limp off to the end of the street before he turned to walk the rest of the way home himself.
Despite being disowned she was still raised Pureblood. So she maintained the neutral expression she was taught to uphold, but inside she was absolutely taken aback. The boy turned man, the godfather of her grandson, and the man who defeated the Dark Lord, was a Lord of 7 houses. "Well. I revise my previous offer. But I'd still be more than willing to help guide you Harry. There are differences between houses, but overall Pureblood tradition runs through each one."
Harry looked at the portrait of Severus as he smiled, "I know sir. I believe you would have as well. So you aren't upset that I'm your heir? …Wait. How did you find out already anyway?"
"Ah yes. Because my elves care what I wear." Harry replied sarcastically.
After dinner when the plates all got cleared away back to the kitchens the elves were in a tizzy. Dobby was absolutely ecstatic and was willing to bet his favorite sock that kind master Harry Potter had made it. Dobby decided he must save the creation and put a preservation spell on it so he could show it off. Winky and Kreacher must see how talented their master was.
I apologize to anyone who's reading this about how short this one is and my lack of updates, the first burst happened during fall break. I'll add a few more chapters during the last few days of winter break.
"Mione.... I don't know what to do for my career essay. I'm trying! But I don't know what to write!...." Harry mumbled into Hermione's shoulder getting a faceful of hair. Harry's been wracking his brain for hours trying to figure something out.
Harry didn’t know what to say, because it was true, he had been avoiding Malfoy. Nothing but the barest of civilities in class, and then avoiding anywhere public where they might meet.
Now though, Draco felt more of a… connection to Potter. Why, already that morning he’d seen – or rather
“I don’t understand.”
As he walked back to his desk, Harry shook off the feeling that he was being watched; sometimes the ‘constant vigilance’ of being an Auror rubbed off in entirely the wrong way. No one would be stalking him on Level 2; it would be madness doing that in the heart of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. The slight movement he thought he saw in the open doorway he passed was probably nothing, just someone getting on with his or her job.
The sound of birdsong woke Draco. Or rather, he drifted into consciousness and the first sound he heard, before even he opened his eyes, were the birds tweeting and twittering in the woods behind the cottage. He smiled, his body still lax and replete with rest. His eyelids were heavy as he opened them to the bright morning, and he appreciated the simple white walls of Henry’s home. Sometimes at the Manor he would open his eyes and have to close them again, assaulted by colours and shape he wasn’t ready to deal with yet.
A very grumpy wizard answered Draco’s Floo call, but assured him that someone would be with him soon. Draco decided to make some tea, and the kettle had just come to a boil when two Aurors – a grizzled older wizard with his hair tied back, and a diminutive black-haired witch – came through Draco’s fireplace.
to follow.”
And then they sat there, the two of them, alone, with their futures lying blank ahead of them. The lake was inky black, and yet still reflected the silver white of the sky.
Ginny's silence was answer enough for Harry. He had made his way back down the hill alone, and nothing had really got any better since that day.
“Thanks. And I’d love to have you both here with me. I mean… this place is a bit big for me. I… like having other people around. I like having you around.” Harry wasn’t sure whether he was saying the words solely to reassure his friends, or not. He had enjoyed having some peace and quiet, but somehow, his days felt… empty. No matter how many rooms he redecorated.
Molly took a bite “Whatever you did, it worked,” Molly said through crumbs. As she chewed and hummed in appreciation, her resemblance to Ron was quite startling.
While washing his hands, Draco saw a glimpse of strong hands linked with his, and felt a warm squeeze and the ghost of a kiss below his ear.
“No.” Harry shook his head. But then his smile faded. “Well, maybe. But not anymore.” Sloping sunlight caught Harry’s eyes. Without his glasses it was clear just how green they were. “You– you’re something else.”
Harry didn’t want to stop.
"No?"
“On me?” asked Draco, alarmed.
“Draco got a bit annoyed about that,” Hermione said, nodding up at the ceiling. “He went for a walk to calm down. Or so he said. Personally I think he went to clean some of the dough out of his hair; he looked quite comical.”
“Like you have a stick up your bum?”
“That looks OK,” Malfoy said. “Let me see the second bit.”
Narcissa unwrapped the tissue paper to reveal a wide bowl, dappled with blue glaze. She set it down on the table, where it dwarfed the bone-china cups.
“The sorting hat thought so,” Harry said, with a grin. He had, he realised, been waiting years for a chance to say this. “But I was very stubborn and Gryffindor about it and insisted on something else.”
“Well, they’re a much smaller business than the Wasps. But it was fairly similar. And the balls were switched before the match.”
“Oh look, mother: isn’t that Madame Featherstone?” Draco grasped his mother’s elbow, and steered her away. “You must excuse us!” he called over his shoulder.
,” he whispered, and another Ron appeared next to him, flickering for a second before stabilising so that there were two identical figures standing with a look of concentration on their faces. Ron – the real one – frowned, and flicked his wand to the side, and his doppelganger walked across the room. The effort of casting the spell was obvious as Ron let out a long huff of breath as the spell ended.
The old elf appeared with a pop, "Master Harry called for Kreacher? And is wearing the Black Lord ring!"
Harry and Draco floo back from Grimmauld to the Headmistress' office. Dumbledore's painting was suspiciously vacant, but Severus Snape was in his painting looking a bit worse for wear.
Draco being completely oblivious about his own feelings is definitely one of my favorite things xD I am all for fic recs about this.
Headmistress McGonagall had Hogwarts create an entirely new common room for these repeating years. There were a handful of student's from every house who chose to return to try and have one more year of childhood before going back out into the world. This gave them the finishing touches on their education that had suffered, time to heal, and time to decide on their future.
"How you have the oddest trio of elves I'll never understand. Let's hope the rest of your elves aren't all so quirky."
"You were a shooting star amongst ordinary stars. Have you ever seen a shooting star. It's wonderful. It passes quickly, but while it's here it just lights up the whole sky - it's the most beautiful thing you'd ever want to see. So beautiful that the other stars stop and watch." Jack 1996
"Why don't you just focus on your Lordship and then you can always do some hobbies on the side? I'm sure Lord Potter has quite a few holdings to keep track of."
"Ronald. Honestly. You look like a fish. Close your mouth." Hermione said as she nudged her boyfriend with her foot when she realized he was just gawping. "Harry. It's about time for dinner. Let's go downstairs and take a break okay?"
Yes yes. A cliche upon cliche of Harry having a boat load of Lordships - but I love this trope!!
Harry just gaped. "You know... I won't be taking that bet. You're probably right. Oi. Those 3 probably all will make comments about something. Kreacher probably will be even nicer to me now that I have the Black ring on." Which would be interesting because Kreacher and Harry were already getting along quite well.
Draco was distracted by that image for the rest of the afternoon until it was time to head back. He remembers Teddy opening his dragon and being absolutely delighted by it. He remembers being caught looking at Harry by a smug Andromeda. And a conversation with his Aunt about mother coming to visit. But mostly he was focused on the mental image of having his own family with Harry.
Harry Potter spoke out for more people than he could probably count reminding the Wizengamot that these children were simply that, children. Their only crime if they were to be charged with one at all, was that they did what their parents had them do to survive. It's never easy to tell a parent who loves you no. Especially when you've spent your entire life hearing their ideals, and internalizing those beliefs as well. They were children of death eaters who never truly realized what their parents were fighting for until they were forced to live it.
By the time the war was at its zenith and they were truly in the thick of it; a large majority realized they did not agree. Many of his old classmates had no other choice besides obey and hope they could survive the madman as long as they could. Harry stood strong through his defence, he wasn’t going to let kids suffer again for just trying to stay alive. He spoke strongest in protection of Draco Malfoy. He stood his ground and told the world that Draco may have been blindly obeying his father, but when it counted he showed his true colors.
Fuck. I'm screwed. Draco thought.
Before Draco could be outraged Harry said, "Please don't say it. With my luck you'll be right and I don't think I can even handle the two I supposedly have now."
Giving Teddy a big kiss on the cheek Harry took him to the table. He's still a baby so Teddy mostly had milk, but he'd been transitioning to solid foods since the summer. He can have small amounts of soft pureed fruits and veggies. And Harry was always happy to feed Teddy, even if it was a mess where they would somehow be wearing more food than Teddy ate.
"Thanks Nev" Harry said instinctively but was shrugging it off as just a nice thing to cheer him up. He went back to his plate and started pushing his food around, half heartedly invested in turning his mash into a sculpture. Ha. If only he could cook, that would open up some possible careers for him because despite everything, he rather enjoyed cooking. But the Dursley's always complained about his food tasting horrible. So that wasn't something to really spend too much time wishing for.
"No. It appears even in my death I will not be able to avoid surprises. Potter, I want you to know that I had no idea that I was your godfather or I would have taken you from your vile aunt immediately." Severus said with conviction, eyes almost begging for Harry to believe him.
Harry James Potter has accomplished a ridiculous amount of feats in his relatively short life. He's been the hero of the wizarding world since before he could even walk. He survived being abused as a little boy, being treated like a house elf by a family that should have loved him. He survived a troll after less than 2 months of education and fended off a man hosting Voldy himself after less than a year.
After breathing in deeply, Harry says in a soft voice, "I don't know. I'm not good at anything else but fighting. But I'm so tired... I don't want to be an auror..." Harry tucks his legs up onto the couch and puts his chin on top of his knees.
In the great hall you could hear laughter and conversations that could make even the most cynical war veteran crack a smile. The school followed Harry's example whether Harry himself realized or not. When they saw the boy wonder speak out at trials all summer they realized it was time to move forward.
Ron jumped up and helped up both his girlfriend and his best mate. The mood lightened a little as the other 2/3 of the trio teased the redhead about his appetite.
"Masters and Mistress. Lunch is ready." Kreacher said interrupting them from their conversation.
"Potter. Your father was a pureblood. He was Lord Potter. As his only son, you were heir Lord Potter, you should have learned wizarding law and traditions during summers to prepare to take over. Because your father is no longer with us, you became eligible at 17 to become Lord Potter. You have a seat on the Wizengamot, you probably have an entire portfolio of properties and businesses under your name, and a lot of sway to make some changes in the Wizarding world. Did your magical guardian never tell you any of this?" Blaise Zabini asked.
In the 8th year common room you could see students of every house sitting around.
When Draco returned with the socks they were ready to pay. Harry handed over his new card and paid for everything. He spent more on clothes today than he had on clothes his entire life until now combined. He knew it didn't even make a dent in his vaults. But it was still a jarring amount for a boy whose only new clothes for years had been school robes.
Forgiving Professor Snape wasn't a hard decision in the end. Even without the mind healer he had been seeing, he knew that carrying around that hatred would do no one any good. But also, Snape spent his adult life suffering because of a mistake that he made in his youth. A mistake that he paid for, for years even dying to carry it through. Certainly no one would be mistaking the former bat of the dungeons as a saint, but he deserved to have his contributions to their victory recognized.
Quickly clearing his throat, Draco turns to Harry. "Come along Potter. I'm looking forward to seeing people's reactions to your new look. I'm predicting at least 3 swooning maidens."
She spots Ron walking into the common room and he smiles noticing them. Ronald Weasley has finally grown up and realized he has nothing to be insecure over. He knows his girlfriend and his best mate were more like siblings than anything. Ron walks across the common room and sits on the chair across from them.
"Come on Harry. I'm starving! Let's go." Practically dragging his best friend to their table where their strange friend collection was sitting. All of their faces turn up in amusement at the familiar sight of a hungry Ron leading the trio to their table.
That's when it clicked. Fuck. Harry's serious.
Harry looked over. "That would be perfect Draco. He could probably practice changing his hair color to match the Dragon and everything."
Everyone who heard was a bit shocked. If anyone else had said those words Draco might have scoffed at their pathetic attempt at fishing for compliments. Merlin knows he was the expert on doing that. But he couldn't react the way he normally would. Something felt wrong; it prickled at his skin telling him to pay attention.
Harry just looks so lost when he looks back to meet Ron's eyes that the redhead stops. "Mate?”
As Draco was handling the order of some more items and getting Harry's measurements for later, Harry noticed a rather nice, cashmere scarf. It wouldn't suit him, but the light blue coloring would suit Draco perfectly. If he manages to sneak this up to Madam Malkin he could get it wrapped up as a thank you gift for the shopping help. He would need to get Draco's attention elsewhere.
This became abundantly clear when he was doing career planning.
"Harry -" someone said, causing him to turn to the rest of the table to see mirrored faces. All looking a combination of shocked, sad, and confused. "You're good at a lot of things!" Neville said.
As Harry wandered over to find the headmistress the rest of the table just sat there thinking over what just happened. Something only a few people noticed though is the very intricate bust of the Malfoy's former house elf sitting on Harry's plate made from potatoes.
"Weasel. You're going to rip boy wonder's arm right off his body if you keep it up," Draco teased playfully. Though there was something in his eyes that made Ron stop and let go of Harry before he decided to tease back to Harry's relief.
By the time Harry finished his defense of his blonde former school rival, there wasn't a solicitor in the world who would be able to convict that boy. Draco Malfoy was free, his mother was free, and his father received harsh penalties but avoided Azkaban. Lucius Malfoy would no longer be Lord Malfoy and they would pay a large sum of their fortune for war reparations, but Lucius was surprisingly okay with that decision. The Malfoy family all silently agreed, they owed Harry Potter their lives and would do everything to make sure the boy felt their gratitude.
The elf left before Harry could even reply. "Well that settles it. Let's go buy some toys."
Harry absolutely beamed. "Really? That would be great. I haven't seen Teddy since school started. I miss him."
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry blinked at her. "....My what? .... Lord Potter? Who? Me?! I have a Lordship?!" He was practically squeaking by the last word.
To the same degree that this lovable idiot was amazing and powerful he was equally oblivious to it all. Anyone, anyone with eyes at all, could see how incredible the now Man-Who-Conquered was. Except Harry himself. The damage of being with the Dursley's and then the rollercoaster of public sentiment in the Prophet numbed Harry to insults and completely warped his sense of worth. Being told you're a waste of space and unwanted can really mess a child up. Huh, imagine that.  But so does being praised for something you don't believe you're responsible for over and over.
"No. I don’t think so.... WAIT! Can we find a baby shop?" Harry asks suddenly, shocking Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Harry. We will have to go to Gringotts though. I was only partially joking. You may have even more titles because of beating the Dark Lord. There are titles that pass after winning battles with other purebloods called a "Right by Conquest". Plus we have to go there to get your rings and get your portfolio." Draco tried to say as gently as possible.
*In the books they meet at the robe shop, in the movies they meet for the first time on the train!
They had a long heart to heart over the summer when Harry was getting Snape honored for his actions posthumously. The younger man came by to Hogwarts to help in repairs and to chat with Severus's new portrait that he had petitioned for. Harry thanked the broody potions master for everything he did to keep him safe, for everything Severus did to ensure that they could win the war that he was not recognized for properly in life. He also apologized for being a giant thorn in his side for years, causing the professor undue stress. Harry wasn't expecting anything, he just wanted to let the professor know how grateful he was.
