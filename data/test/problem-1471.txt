Then they had ventured to implement Greengrass' earlier suggestion and had ended up having a highly amusing late lunch in the St. Mungo's cafeteria during which they all turned up their noses at the hospital food and exchanged news.
Great. Another pesterer. “Save it, Potter, I know it's the same thing back from when it nearly killed me. Not that I care anymore.”
“Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast,” Alice piped in cheerfully.
Harry had convinced Draco to make an exception for the twin: The former huntsman had told Draco how the late Fred at The Hunt called himself 'Half' because of the feeling of not being completely whole.
Of course she was right and Seeker himself felt unsure about his next words, but he also thought that he should explain himself: “It's kind of the same thing as with The Beginning. You said it's not The End. Don't get me wrong, I don't want her dead or anything. I just want
saw that,” Malfoy laughed silently, his shoulders brushing Harry's as he shook. “Wait till it's in the
“Don't you swallow, Potter!” Draco growled, but he couldn't move away to escape the handover, since he was by now tightly surrounded by the villagers.
Got it. Very well done.” He lazily clapped his hands twice. Damn them if they tricked him one more time today. This was obviously a prank. “I can't believe you are in on this, though, Snowdrop. I thought you'd stick by me.”
of all people. Malfoy, who had truly been more than insufferable since he’d been given the Inquisitorial Squad power by that pink toad Umbridge after Dumbledore’s flight last month. That slimy git’s grin at catching sight of Harry had told him all the detention he would have to do – if he got caught that was.
“But Hogwarts has its own rules. You won't find any heads in the castle. What you will find though is an ominous, barricaded well-opening in a lumber room in the dungeons, near the Slytherin common room. That's why people have started whispering about a secret place where old house-elves are sent to. Do you know, Potter? When house-elves reach a certain age, they start losing their minds. No, really, it's true. They just... are no longer right in the head. First slowly and then rapidly. Sometimes they get violent. Another reason we deliver them from their misery before it gets too bad. Anyhow, legend is that there is a well where the mental house-elves get put in: the Mental Well. But sometime along the centuries, the name got mixed up a bit, so it's the Wental Mell nowadays and any house-elf down there is
“We're almost in Méala, our village. I should warn you, people will probably look at you funny. We normally chase humans away when they come too close – alive or dead, but I'm making an exception for you, Harry.” She glanced over her shoulder, the light of her 'heart' reflected in her eyes. “You really impressed us when you were here last year. Saving everyone – regardless of their affiliation – that was very big of you.” She turned her face back forward. “Even the little part-Veela girl...”
Surprisingly, it had been Weasley who had come up with the idea to leave a standing message at the reception desks of those institutions, so that anyone also inquiring about details of The Wild Hunt should be asked to contact Draco.
to kill Dumbledore. This was a test,” Draco laughed bitterly. Of course, how could he have imagined people would just forgive him so easily? He felt feeble.
Malfoy threw his hands in the air in frustration. “Is everyone on this table one sandwich short of a picnic?”
As much as Draco appreciated the gesture, he was too upset to be appeased just yet. “Yeah, but there is shit and then there is...” An idea struck, his voice smoothed to neutrality. “Well, never mind. How about I bring this to the post office? I learnt how to do that. Did you write the address?” He would show them what's what, those bloody blood relatives. Draco imagined an evil laugh in his head, harharhar.
“Ah, well, I changed my mind. Turns out she was right in the end, wasn't she? After all, your best friend Pillar was abducted by The Wild Hunt which Grims are connected to and she saw one in your cup, so I can admit that I misjudged her. I will send her a card when we get back.” She whipped her head around and stared at her boyfriend defiantly as if daring him to continue the argument. He however was cleverer than Draco would have given him credit and shut his mouth.
“Took your time, did you?” Greengrass gave Draco the stink eye. Okay, this was getting simply weird, considering the witch and he had never interacted much in school. She'd been a bit of a loner.
The fire was already lit, with Scoffer curled around Dreamer to one side of BraveHeart who was sedulously working on painting onto four masks of different shapes.
and he yelped as the force of Queen Harry's magic tried to pry him from Malfoy's closed fist. It was like being torn in half. Literally.
He still wanted to go back home, to his alive life – whatever that entailed. But with each passing day, he found he was a little less motivated to try. It was fun to be free like this, bare of all responsibilities, always surrounded by mirth and laughter. Yes, sure, he would leave the moment they got back to Britain, but until then, why not enjoy this?
Draco's eyes flew open. Bloody hell, what if he forgot about Potter again in the morning? What if, come the next day, he would no longer remember why there was a mountain of books in his new library? And what if the memories wouldn't come back this time? What if...
“Good game, Em. Sorry for... you know. No hard feelings?” Seeker held out his hand, but Ember was still seething and stomped away with 'bad loser' written all over his broad, retreating back.
At one point Lovegood in a crazy dress appeared and, after silently scrutinising Draco for a full minute making him very nervous, she asked him to dance.
Wiping tears from his face, Harry straightened up. “Draco, I know how to find the baby. I know how to find The Hunt.”
Anguis shot forward with the apparent idea of wrapping himself around the blond boy's leg, all while hissing a battle cry.
Malfoy, still seated to the left of Harry, with his right upper arm pressing into Harry's shoulder, struggled, pulling at the cup and Harry. “I can't!”
The Hunt. More often than not they are little reminders from your old life that's why we call glowing stuff – alive or dead –" (Wolfe started sniggering on that pun.) “Somewhen Things. Things you 'met' sometime in your life but don't remember. Like Snowdrop, she glows for me, I've met her before.” A chorus of 'me too' sounded.
“In the middle of summer, you shall draw back the curtain,” philosophised Alice. Then she gestured friendly at the teapot halfway between them. “Take some more tea.”
Squinting at the ground, Seeker gave a surprised squeak and quickly backed away. There, in front of him, was a barred grass snake unfurling from what seemed to have been an afternoon nap.
Sitting in their library, Draco's answer from that day echoed in his head while his fingertips brushed over a picture of Harry and Theodore competing in a round of pumpkin juice pong: “I am happy.”
“Zat actually sounds reasonable. We know zat tale in France, too. La Chasse Aérienne, c'est ça, non? If you spy at ze riders you will be punished.” Beauxbatons nodded in agreement with her words. “It's possible.
“It's Perchta's house, Seeker!” BraveHeart elucidated happily, while feeding fistfuls of reed to the horses (Lightning was keenest, of course). “She lives under this stone, or in it really. It's so wicked! I wish I had a magical stone house.”
?” she shrieked at the end, so that Cassius had to calm her down once more. They weren’t super-close actually, but his calm demeanour always had a soothing effect on her. Maybe it had been a good thing to have this half-Hufflepuff come along after all.
“Perchta of course. Though today she's Frigg. Now get up or you're really going to miss it.” Half pulled him up.
Harry stepped back and winked at Draco. This would be good. “Cool and since I'm at upsetting the way of the world: I hereby resign as master of Death, effective immediately.”
As they walked, nearly ran, down the hallway, Draco couldn't help but notice that the Grounds had lost lots of their former glamour. Many antique pieces Draco was used to seeing on the walls or on commodes were gone. Probably for reparation payments. After all, Mr. Goyle had been sentenced to a lifetime in Azkaban.
The snowy owl gave him a critical stare and made for his shoulder, where she perched in a dignified manner and started picking at her new friend's jumper which was peeking out from beneath his winter robes. He squinted at his front. There, in golden embroidery on scarlet background was one word: Harry.
,” Granger found herself chuckling in delight until she realised that neither of the boys had joined into the laughter. “Gone with the wind! Like the movie?”
Huh, how did the conversation suddenly turn so dark? Seeker suppressed a shudder. Talking about the underworld was one thing, somewhat adventurous, but this?
The Ministry? Draco wrinkled his nose. Going to the Aurors with a missing person's case would be the normal thing to do. Although in Draco's case, there was a fair chance they'd rather lock
! I'm getting a divorce!” Her red face screwed up. “Draco...” Very unlike her usual self, she held out her arms like a small child waiting to be picked up.
With one last look at the lovey-dovey couple (ugh), Draco made for the barn once more. One final circumnavigation would do.
"No, it's just, normally you jump in here and correct us. What's that guy's name again?" the Ronald-Weasel asked.
he had to speak to him... and maybe hold onto him and never let him go? Seeker shooed the notion away. Weird thoughts like that kept popping up now. That's why he needed to meet Barn Boy, to settle this, yeah.
“Oh, shut up and let's go already. Mr. Withane? Hold on to Harry's other shoulder, will you? Yes, like that. Okay, we're ready.”
To his horror, both his travel companions laughed at that (he did not let himself think 'at him'). They just didn't know what was what, those savages. Hmpf.
Even when, under normal circumstances, he would have jumped at the opportunity to see Potter fighting over him, it was too embarrassing to voice that thought, ever.
“Or,” the red-haired weasel proposed, a twinkle in his eye, “we could ask advice from a Curse-Breaker.”
“Everyone but Draco. He could still remember you because you once were the owner of his wand for a short time and that made up the most powerful connection.”
He had also found something meaningful to occupy his time with: helping with the reconstruction of Hogwarts Castle.
That was why Draco actually didn't use the nickname often to call Potter to his face – in Draco's own warped interpretation, 'Scarhead' was an endearment of sorts and he didn't want anyone to notice. A secret he would take to the grave.
“That's because they are more like... liaisons. For the future. Draco is too smart to actually consider the likes of them his
“Argh!” Draco threw his hands in the air and turned on his heels to leave the cosy living chambers. This was no use.
“Headmistress!” Draco all but yelled. “I saw them with my own two eyes! But that's beside the point. Have you not heard what I just said?
“No, that was awful of me,” Potter shook his head vehemently, “and I truly don't think of you like that, you know?” His blood-shot eyes were pleading now. “I really, really don't think you're a Death Eater anymore. I just,” he swallowed, “I was just looking for a way to rile you up.”
That was the most Harry had ever heard him say. What was more, it had deflated Harry's anger somehow and left him with a complicated feeling of wanting to go into two different directions at once, staying here with them and leaving, back to his life.
“I'm sorry, Malfoy.” Granger faced him now, eyes serious. “I wasn't sure, alright? You've pulled elaborate pranks on us before. Though, to be honest, I think you're speaking the truth this time. It's only that you keep evading when we ask you about... Palmer. See, I just don't understand your motivation.”
Draco felt tears burning in his throat. He needed to get out, get home to his gatehouse and clear his head. But he should be so lucky as to escape quietly.
Yes, they still had the same six-course menu, colossal tree and exuberant presents they'd always had – but that was exactly the problem.
“My brothers dragged me home that day, but I couldn't forget about her. So I came back, again and again, just to see her, just to listen to her laughter. I called her
His mother's normally so dignified voice was high pitched like a little girl's as she dug her detention-imposed un-manicured nails deep into Draco's upper arm.
chambers on Christmas Day at,” she glanced at the old grandfather clock in the corner, “almost midnight.”
“My father's tribe drowned whoever tried to flee to the sea. In the end, only a handful of us escaped.”
“We had forgotten about him again, hadn't we?” Granger tapped her finger to her chin. “He is eradicated from our memory over and over, isn't he? That... Potty?” Close. Also, hilarious.
“Interesting idea, but why didn't she blind Ferret here then?” The Weasel was already stuffing his face. Draco's stomach growled. They had foregone dinner, so maybe just a tiny piece...
Potter shot him a sharp look. “Don't call them that! But since you're asking: Ron helps out at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and Hermione is taking care of her parents.” There was something left unsaid between the lines and that something was dangerous, too closely connected to Draco's flight angst, so better not to touch on it.
Draco bashfully extricated himself from her arms. It still felt so weird for him to even be allowed in her presence, let alone being welcomed with such warmth.
He slumped down. Staring disbelieving at the non-writing where he now remembered with crystal clarity to have penned essays and essays of Potter anecdotes the night before.
Alice cocked her head to the other side and repeated the question: “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”
For the first time, Draco registered that the merchieftainess was not bathed in the soft backlace glow like the other merpeople.
Mabel brushed a few stray tears off her face. “They are! My mothers' tale is the biggest love story of our tribe.”
Draco instinctively ducked away as the Bat-Bogey Hex barely missed him by a hair. His hand flew to his wand and he was halfway done producing a counter-hex when he remembered the reason for his being here. So instead he hastily took cover behind a bearded scarecrow, which was dressed in red velvet the way Muggles liked to clothe during Yuletide, standing askew in the middle of the yard. It wouldn't do to duel the family he was hoping to get help from.
Draco blinked unseeing out of the window, his heart racing at the wording. “I didn't know it was yours. When I moved in here I had forgotten you used to live here.”
First Voice looked at the approaching Slytherin with dark eyes. “It is not to attack us. It will get its dolly back, but it is not to attack us.”
He sighed resignedly and went to stand next to the shop owner. “Hullo, Weasley... Weasleys,” he quickly added as he noticed Stuck-up Weasley loitering behind his brother and nodding at Draco. “Where's Ronald?”
“Alright,” conceded Lacie at last and handed Harry to Malfoy who quickly pressed him against his chest, his heart beating fast against Harry's eardrum, and took two steps back.
“Ah, no, those are Draco's.” Weasel put his foot in his mouth and didn't even notice. His wife next to whom he had just slumped down, rolled her eyes. She of course had caught on  to the precarious situation they were in.
“No problem.” Draco startled.  “Wait, you didn't even tell your parents yet?” His eyes went big and warmth bloomed in his chest.
“It was hard for me, too, to get back onto a broom, after the fire. But it's not going to get easier if you wait longer to try again. If anything, it gets harder.”
“The walls indeed,” Malfoy whispered into Harry's ear. Yet the tone with which he said it, made Harry follow the other's gaze to the opposite side of the vertical tunnel.
use a word it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less. 'Voldemort' is only an epithet of a man-slaughtering bigot and I'd be damned if I'll let him have power over me with just that stupid  nickname. Someone who would have killed Mabel and Ada for being born of a merperson and a human or Seamus for having a Muggle father and a witch mother. Do you really want to give
Mabel drew up her eyebrows, but replied nevertheless. “No, we can choose, mostly. Not unlike you, up in your school. But everyone takes the classics: Laughing and,” she hesitated briefly, “Grief.”
“Ada,” Merchieftainess Murcus greeted her daughter with a nod, “your sister had a good reason to leave her post. We have students here,” she gestured at Draco, “and they need to be brought back into the school. Tonight. Could you send them off, please? We'll take care of the squid.”
How many more would have had to die if not for Potter? Draco felt determination bubbling up inside him.
“Hey! Don't pull on my hair, you imp!” Draco shook his head a bit and drew a satisfying squeak from puny Potter. Yet his glee only lasted for a second when next he felt a sharp pain against his scalp. “Stop it!”
“But you don't give a damn about others, do you? Not even the ones living under your own roof. You treated,” Potter choked, “
?” He started back the way they had come, but halted once he realised, Harry wasn't following. “What is it?”
Silent relief washed over Draco. He'd only offered out of politeness and shame, but he really liked his new lifestyle. Also, it would be weird-ass embarrassing to have Nott see all the Potter-stuff strewn around Draco's place. Yeah, better not.
Harry slid down a handrail. After all, he could make some use of it since there were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Tuesday; some with a vanishing step halfway up.
“To places, yeah, but never straight back along its own track,” Wolfe nodded. “It's impossible, actually.”
“Right, but it's not like that for her. She is not like Puffel. For a lack of better categories – she is not the same 'ghost type', so Hunt magic works differently on her.”
Finally, the coughing subsided, leaving an utterly wrecked-looking Malfoy in Harry's arms. “There, all better now.”
Returning home late that night, in bed, Harry had looked at Draco so long until the latter had sighed, rolled his eyes and inquired: “Yes?”
Malfoy stilled, a moment of horror on his face before he schooled his features into neutrality and hissed: “Shut up, you idiot. Don't provoke them!”
Meanwhile Holle, no Frigg today, had climbed into the chariot, taking the reins. The wagon was just big enough for one person to stand in, but had quaint things dangling on its sides: an empty basket and boxes tied with string, as well as what looked like a spear and a sceptre.
“In theory, yes,” Death agreed, “but it also works the other way round: Should The Hunt ever catch The Beginning, which is sort of an incarnation of Life, she would be freed and I with her. Theoretically.”
wasn't a give-away, he didn't know one. He could admit it now: His heart had been set on Draco, even when he hadn't been consciously
Harry kissed the corner of Draco's mouth. It was hard to concentrate on anything other than that. “Scarhead is...” Draco shuddered.
Other people in the line pushed forward and Draco was released, feeling happy and somehow freed from a burden. He did not regret his decision.
“I think,” said Queen Harry calculatingly, “that you forgot you made me smart, love.” He cocked his head. “You just want me to let you loose so you can elope with Himbo Harry.” His eyes narrowed. “But I won't let you go. You belong to me – as I belong to you.”
“Malfoy,” Harry shrugged his left shoulder to unhinge the Slytherin currently leaning onto him to better hiss directions into his ear, “shove over and give me some room.”
Why though? Not completely sure himself, Seeker turned to rest his cheek on Lightning's soft hair. Just something about the blond boy had shaken him so thoroughly that Seeker simply
“There you are.” Harry brought in the smell of rain and mud. He came over and leant in to kiss Draco's temple, dripping on the papers in the process.
“Look who's back, Snowdrop!” Half called when they approached the horse group with the sleeping snow owl. Leaning towards Harry he added: “She was just as worried about you as we were, I swear.”
Warm March sun was sprinkling the tiles this Monday morning, it was going to be a nice spring day; if only that damn animal would come out already!
“There are many ways, but this one is the best for you. This pipe leads to a big underground tunnel from which I'm sure you'll find your way back into your beds. Now, little one, – not you, the tiny champion – swim inside and open the grate. There's a lug over there that you have to unhook, can you see it?”
Draco picked up his line of thought as he started down the barely visible path that led off the grounds.
Hermione shot her husband a dark look. “Ronald. Did you not promise me you told Draco last month about the traditional Weasley lunch on Boxing Day?”
“The Headless Hunt.” Longbottom eyed him curiously. “The ghost hunting party for the beheaded? I thought it was common knowledge.” He shrugged. “But maybe just among Gryffindors as Nick's our– Hey, where are you going?”
“It's none of your business whether or not I visit my parents! And as for 'going home' there isn't any 'home' I could go to at the moment,” Draco hissed. “Although... I mean... I've been thinking...”
If The Beginning showed his deepest desire then Seeker had to keep going... because Draco was the reason.
After hours and hours of research and worry, these outbursts of hilarity were needed to balance them all out.
Time had really flown by and now, with ninety, Harry could look back on a turbulent life that had, in the end, left him with laughter lines and treasured memories.
“Yes, very. Haven't you learnt anything in school?” Draco gave up and turned around to face the source of his annoyance.
He looked up, but it was all dark overhead, except for the tiny twinkling stars of the rhinestones. There was not the faintest glimmer of the trick stair they'd fallen through. Getting up back there would be so fun... not.
“Yeah, well, he's already ruined the mood,” grumbled the Weasel. “Aren't you glad now that you decided not to go with your parents to visit their Australian friends? Who wants Christmas on the beach when they can have Malfoy on a nonsense-spouting spree?”
The resident ghost of Gryffindor tower gave him a curious look at that. “With me? What for, pray tell?”
Harry shook his head, what did it even matter if Mr. Silver Spoon attended? Harry would barely have time to talk to him and next to Malfoy with his refined posture and his elegant features Harry would look even more like a country rube.
rang a familiar yet unfamiliar voice in his head and for a split-second he remembered blond hair and storm grey eyes and an ache so sweet, so old clawed its way to his heart, making him gasp.
Ember, after reluctantly leaving Dreamer in Scoffer's care, had, to everyone's displeasure, decided to join the opposing team.
On December 24th, The Wild Hunt packed up camp and made ready to leave the summer residence at Windsor Forest and Great Park. It was a bone-chillingly cold day. So gelid that the trees, covered in ice crystals, looked as if their branches were afire with white flames and the gold offerings from baby-wishers, at the bank of Holle's Pond, were completely frozen over.
Malfoy's eyes were unfocussed, staring into the distance. “...sometimes. Potter, I'm not a good person, no one knows that better than you. But
“You mean no taste at all – and it's bloody midnight, you nuisance. Get yourself a watch!” Malfoy growled, turning his back at Harry, who went to stand next to him.
“Malfoy! Jeez. You nearly gave me a heart attack!” Harry put down his wand. “You could have said something.”
“Er, I – oh, okay, thanks, er, Ember,” Harry stuttered as the hulk lifted him onto Lightning without further ado. Harry felt severely unsafe and grabbed the reins tighter than explicitly necessary. Sweat was rolling down his back. But if he ever wanted a chance to get out of The Hunt, he had to leave this valley first. And horseback seemed to be the only way out.
The other boy looked up and Draco had to inhale sharply at the sight: red-rimmed, sunken eyes in a pasty face crowned an entirely uncharacteristic bag of bones. Gregory's broad shoulders were sticking out through his flimsy shirt and Draco could see how much weight his friend had lost. Dammit, Draco, why haven't you come earlier?
Draco had told them about hunting The Wild Hunt and pried permissions from all of them to enter their private libraries (he'd sent them letters regarding this topic before, but they had been too pissed at him to answer back then).
“Scarhead is what I call you in my heart of hearts.” Draco swallowed, his body hyper-aware of every one of Harry's touches that had somehow turned off his brain-to-mouth filter. “For me it's a term of affection.”
Half caught that and exchanged furtive looks with the others before sneering. “Seeker, when I met you down at Holle's Pond, did you, I don't know,
This flashback chapter is a very special one as it was the 'birthplace' of all the intermezzi in the story - or rather the idea for all of them was inspired by this scene mentioned in the first chapter.
He had come alone since Aunt Andromeda had considerately written in advance, stating that Teddy was too young for longer travels yet; which was all well, since the Malfoys never had had the intention to invite the extended family in the first place.
The house-elf shook his bat-like ears. “Kreacher doesn't know about the books, but the M– girl is not to touch them! Oh, if my Mistress knew, she would cry.”
“You know I would though. I'd do almost anything for you,” said Draco quietly. In that moment, there only existed the two of them in a vast universe.
Draco pulled at his bottom lip. Although the chances were slim, the nursery rhyme about The Wild Hunt
Except that he didn't. Not completely. Sure, he had Harry's face and Harry's glasses and even Harry's scar, but his hair was smoothly combed to the side and his well-pressed shirt under his cloak was (contrary to Harry's own white one) dark red and accented by a green-and-silver Slytherin tie.
Harry's heart skipped a beat. What was that just now? He furrowed his brows. “Heal? I'm not sure what you mean.”
Draco looked a bit disappointed, but Harry nodded. He was used to this secretiveness and these half-truths. “I suppose that makes sense. Jumping in, I also have a question: What about the fairy tale Mother Holle? I mean, that's not really about her is it?”
An eerie hush blanketed the little grange, only interrupted by the screams: one faint wail from inside the house was echoed by a quiet honk of the hellhound pack, each subsequent one feebler than the preceding, until there was nothing but silence.
“Before that though there's something else.” Thomas glanced at Draco. Uh oh. “I heard... that is, Hermione said you are looking for a missing person?”
, can you believe it? Winky. But you're not so far off yourself now are you?” He winked conspicuously at Draco, who felt himself pinking and wished he could hurl hexes at this dimwit. At least it was reassuring that the 'boyfriend' running gag still seemed amusing to the redhead, even after remembering everything.
Draco raised a brow at that. He could hardly imagine dull Mrs. Goyle to attract any suitors, but then again Mrs. Zabini was a femme fatale par excellence, so maybe...
“Enjoying your first flight, Seeker?” The redheaded Half was soaring through the air on Harry's right, while Wolfe in her lavender toga glided left of him. BraveHeart's Grapes was neighing just in front, letting Harry see that there was a picture of a camera on the back of the tiny boy's shirt.
“No...” the farmer said and furrowed his brows. “This isn't a joke somehow, is it? Because I swear, if you–”
“Un-bloody-believable! Draco! You save them all!” BraveHeart announced and shook Draco enthusiastically.
An unnerving thought. Draco wanted to say 'never' but images of a worn-out, grey-faced Potter during Hogwarts patches came to mind and as much as he tried to laugh at the idea that the Saviour didn't enjoy life, he knew better. “I'm not sure, but... it's not entirely impossible. I think he feels guilty a lot.”
“You're an asshole.” Okay. Not exactly the answer Draco had expected. “You always think you are right and that you are better than anyone else. You're a bully and petty and weepy. You have no backbone whatsoever and–”
Kreacher's eyes sparkled. “Say 'toujours pur'!” There was an awkward pause. “Ah, that is... say 'cheese'!”
Between the stems were what Harry was pointing at though: a number of odd-shaped doors all around, some small, some huge.
"I'm going to Godric's Hollow to pay my respects to some war heroes." Draco shot Potter a look filled with mirth. "Maybe you want to tag along?"
Finally, Harry stepped tentatively next to the blond boy and, following the latter's gaze, looked down to the cross in front; Crabbe's cross.
would be too much. So he only put them on in the wee hours of the day, when the fire was burning low and his back hurt from sitting too long in the same position. They were his secret.
Still looking decidedly unwell, Malfoy reached out to fist Harry's cloak, drawing them closer until they collided. He securely wrapped one arm around Harry's middle which earnt him a raised eyebrow from the Gryffindor. “For safety,” Malfoy explained defensively. “Just in case.” He peeked down. “How can we even see anything at all in this pitch?”
“...sure.” Draco looked helplessly at Granger, half awaiting to hear a 'Gotcha' from either of them, but the girl simply kept on radiating happiness.
When Draco had come out of the room, trying his best to steady a dangerously staggering Greg, the former Slytherins had (with united forces) managed to get the patient to the hospital, signing him in and making sure that all of them had visitor privileges.
So, he was sweaty (a fact that he loathed) and somewhat moody when he arrived at the Entrance Hall where Madam Hooch was coordinating assignments by sending groups of Patchers this way and that, crossing off jobs on a big chalkboard that was hovering near the stairs.
The old wandmaker had sat down on the lone chair in the shop and listened closely. Now, he was tilting his head. “Wand-wizard-connections are complex. I've never heard of anything like it, but it's not impossible. Wandlore is a mysterious branch of magic. Now, give me your wand.”
“Yes, but in case all our notes disappear overnight,” (A howl from the ginger.) “Malfoy needs to be able to recall everything we've found out today. Besides, you and I keep forgetting things, so repetition is key in this case, wouldn't you agree?” She gave her boyfriend a stern look.
Harry frowned. “On... That's what Dumbledore said to me when I talked to him in the in-between; when I was technically dead.” Draco twitched. “But... I didn't talk to Dumbledore, did I? That was you.”
“Surprised? Yeah, it's the boy we nearly ran over in front of the barn during The Last Ride back in January. His name is Draco and he is looking for me and once he finds me, he will call me by my alive name and free me. So, I'm not worried. But it would have been nice to know my own name.”
Harry's chagrin deflated as he sighed and nodded. “Yeah, I'll tell her.” Then he grinned. “But then you have to come visit her soon, otherwise she'll hunt you down. That woman has determination and once she set her sights on you, you better not run.” Malfoy lifted an eyebrow at him. “She pretty much forced me to renovate my house after she came by once. For my own good, of course.”
Their trip to the Owlery was surprisingly pleasant now that they'd come to a basic understanding. While the two Gryffindors still had to hide under their Invisibility Cloak, the boys were idly chatting away about Quidditch and Pansy and Granger had fallen into a whispered conversation about the pros and cons of magical versus Muggle skin care.
“Sorry for asking all these silly questions and thank you for taking me in. I don't want to see you sad, so – bye bye Harry, call me Seeker!” An elegant movement and the wonderful piece of clothing went into the fire, making little sparks dance in the wintry air.
the pond is a bottomless pit! Oh, what else? Just the entrance to the realm of the dead, no biggie. Seeker, really, do you never pay attention when the riders talk?”
“Gross! Potter, at least have a semblance of culture, will you? Use my handkerchief.” Draco passed the other boy a monogrammed piece of white brocade in exchange for the water bottle Potter had offered him.
A movement near a shaded park bench caught his attention. There on the earth, a barred grass snake was winding. The image stirred something inside him and made him come closer.
He shuffled his way through the crowd and patiently endured an account of very boring Ministry business by Stuck-Up Weasley while they waited in line. Suppose Draco should consider himself lucky to be worth talking to at all. Though he began to suspect that the Golden Couple had instructed their friends and families to treat Draco politely or at least with decency.
In between all these things to do and people to meet, Draco stuffed in as much Hunt research as possible, yet it felt never enough.
“You got it backwards, Seeker. She is The Beginning, not The End,” Wolfe cackled, wiping tears of amusement from her face.
He scrunched up his nose. Wow, yeah, that actually made a lot of sense. Hadn't BraveHeart/Colin said something about this? Seemed like Harry owed him an apology. The story hadn't been all that made-up in the end.
But most of all, this story is for you! Readers out there, living in quarantine, lockdown or just a stressful life.
Potter pulled out a wand which made Draco flinch back violently. Was this payback all along? Eyes wide, Draco stood frozen. As did Potter whose brows knitted together.
“Other house-elves, Potter,” Malfoy provided and rocked gently back and forth, his mouth a thin line.
I'm very sorry it took so long. I was on spontaneous vacation and things got a little busy. I will try to be more on time from now on.
“Mhm, not much to go on here,” said Wolfe with an unsatisfied look. “But at least they remembered the grass sacrifice for the horses. Binky, dig in!”
“Wrong! Especially to those!” Draco felt warm blush creeping up his neck and he wiggled to get into the perfect position, sleeping in the arms of his Chosen One – the one he'd chosen and who'd chosen him. “Good night, Scarhead.”
than what they appeared to be at first glance. “That explains the power of the wand then. After all, it has part of Holle's magic and part of yours.”
“You are such an ass, Draco!” she greeted him and made a threatening step in his direction. “I should just hex you or punch you in the face!”
At that, Draco raised an eyebrow at her. That girl really had some guts to challenge him so blatantly. Alright, have it her way, but he wouldn't play. “We don't get along,” he said dryly, examining his nails. “He is all that I am not: kind, forgiving, brave – also, easily flustered, oblivious and way too much of a bleeding heart type. In conclusion, he drives me up the walls. And don't talk about him in past tense.”
“Thanks for the talk. You're not a bad listener.” Draco got up. Uh oh. It had all been fun and games so far, running into
Seeker's heart contracted. “I'm right here and... I think about you too. All the time. At least when I remember... it's complicated, but still – I do, okay? So,” he tentatively put a hand on Draco's thigh knowing fully well the other boy wouldn't feel it, “could you just do it? Call my name.”
Brushing through his strands, a quiet voice in Harry's head told him that Malfoy knew what Harry liked to eat the same way Harry knew what Malfoy's favourite season was (spring): They were always looking at each other. Looking and
won't make it through the Inquisitorial monitoring without being noticed. You do know that the headmistress delegated the checking of all in-and-out correspondence to the Inquisitorial Squad, right? So lest we want to be discovered, it would be better to take my owl. Pepper, come here girl!”
Seeker, glasses askew, tried fruitlessly to yank the reins around, but the animal stayed stoically on track, each second carrying them further away from the barn and the boy with the storm-grey eyes.
Instead, a feathered cannonball shot through the open kitchen window and fell into Draco's half-eaten breakfast.
He looked so vulnerable that Harry had the sudden impulse to wrap his arm around Malfoy's shoulder or take his hand again, like that one morning by the lake. Harry'd never allowed himself to think about it too much, but retrospectively, that had been odd. Holding hands with his old school bully as if it were nothing, as if it were perfectly normal.

“Reading,” Harry shrugged. “I was curious and I did find some interesting stuff about The Hunt.” His expression grew soft. “You really put so bloody much work into finding me, I'm amazed.”
And Hedwig... well, Hunt magic works differently on animals (and creatures). I think she remembered everything and she made her own journey to The Hunt (maybe with a bit of guidance by Life and Death) in the hopes to see Harry again. Because she was a smart owl.
Nothing happened though, other than Potter turning to Draco with a flabbergasted expression. “You live here now?”
He couldn't even keep a record of Potter? Draco had barely managed to remember the Scarhead this morning. How could he make sure not to forget him tomorrow or the day after?
It was funny though, if Seeker was truthful. He tried to hide a grin, but failed. “You guys are the worst,” he chuckled. “Just wait till I get back at you.” He picked more feathers out of his hair and never-withering flower crown.
“Excellent.” Granger clapped her hands and looked all at once very enthusiastic. “You go there first then. Ron, you'll check if there's a library at Grimmauld Place, I'll take Hogwarts and then we all meet back here in, let's say–
“You know,” Harry ventured carefully and tried the next doorknob over, only to find that that one wasn't real either, “
She was very excited and hummed happily as she started the planning. Ah, it would be such a wonderful place for students and teachers alike.
“No, they haven't and no, we're not hexing Malfoy (right away).” Hermione shook her head, a plan already forming in the back of her mind. “We better try to get Harry under the Cloak with us when Malfoy's distracted. If he can't present the culprit to Umbridge, he has no evidence that Harry was out after hours.”
“It's not– I'm not– Don't you dare think that I would–” But the reptile didn't seem to care much about his stammering, eyeing a point right of Draco's shoulder. Of course, why would
“Maybe firstly take your hand out of my pants?” Potter's fingertips had indeed transcended Draco's waistband. “And then we need to talk.”
“Thank you. I appreciate it. You lot coming here has given me hope when I had almost lost it all. I will hold on – and of course I'll let you know should I find out anything else.”
However, on the day itself, early in the morning, before any festivities had started, the couple had gone out. They had Apparated to Windsor Great Park and with a bit of searching they'd tracked down Anguis. The snake (who on the first glance had seemed like he couldn't care less) had only stopped being arrogant when Harry indulgently had presented the brought along snacks. Their talk, with Harry as the translator, had been rather entertaining and Draco had found he liked the reptile quite a bit.
He grinned, blushing. “You mean I will bring you. Oh and just so you know, I'm chasing a storm, too.
“Just thinking.” She tugged at her lip. “By the way, you were wrong, Ron. We wouldn't have forgotten her.”
Harry tried hastily to climb back up, but with the bundle in his arms, he couldn't quite manage. He made a decision. “Here, take the baby!” Harry shoved the infant at Ember and leapt onto Lightning. “Hold tight!” And off they went, the transformed dog stuck to their heels. Just in time to catch the last tails of The Hunt.
Ronald, balancing a small tray with biscuits and a teapot on one hand, whooshed his wand to float cups to every one of them.
Draco felt his stomach lurch. He had known Gregory was in a bad place, but so were they all after the war and frankly, with most of his friends still holding on to their pure-blood prejudices, Draco had needed to take a break from them; to re-evaluate who he himself wanted to be from now on.
Christmas time at The Burrow was separated into two big events: family Christmas dinner on the 25th and friends Christmas lunch on the 26th. Last year, Draco had been invited to the latter. This year, as partner of Harry who was practically family, the two of them would attend the former.
the only one who remembers Potter because I was with him when it happened. That is the only logical explanation.”
“They said she was crazy, that the devil had possessed her. They said, if she loved the sea so much, the sea should save her. And they put her in a tiny boat with no oars and set it out on the water in a brewing storm. They laughed at her and told her, if she made it through the night, she would have come to her senses and would marry whomever they told her to.”
Harry snapped abruptly out of the nightmarish thoughts that had clouded his mind. He blinked, snowflakes brushing his face in flight.
“Ah, someone must have removed the Trip-Wire Entry Spell. Good thing, too, since it was designed to affect Dumbledore's killer and, er..." She glanced at Draco as they entered the dimly lit hallway.
Carefully smoothing her skirt over her ass, Pansy lowered down. It pinched. Why did she have to wear her tightest panties today? Well, they always made her feel sexy and lately she had needed that reassurance more and more frequently. Also, because Draco never really looked at her the way that he should and– Not the time for insecurities.
“Nice try, Granger, but you don't really think, I'll believe you when you say breaking this 'vow' will make me regret it, do you?” Parkinson flicked her hair back. “Because I don't.”
Weirdly, Draco stiffened for a moment and when he spoke, he looked down at the notebook. “Yeah, about that... Ahem, so we thought that, you know, because you were temporarily the owner of my wand and we therefore somehow 'shared' a wand, that that made up the 'most powerful connection'. The lore says only the most powerful connection can make it so that people remember kidnapped witnesses. And since wandlore is complex, especially regarding ownership and allegiance, it made sense.”
connecting). Slowly but surely, over months after the incident, he had found himself falling in love with the words, the mimic and the Draconess of the boy from the bench and secretly Harry had started imagining a life with him.
Draco stayed silent for a moment. When he finally spoke, there was an edge to his voice: “Is it true what they said about you in the Forest? About how you felt before joining The Hunt?”
“Shush! Quiet now. This way!” Seeker nodded his head to the right and the group of two dozen people followed him unquestioningly through the undergrowth.
Harry blinked. The man? No, the dog. The red-eared white dog of hell, that now leant out of the window, paws on the sill.
Draco choked on his tea and coughed. With watering eyes he stared at Hermione, who in turn still looked at Potter as if saying 'or else'. That, Draco had not expected: that the Golden Couple would be on his side, even with Potter back in their midst.
Holle huffed in annoyance. “Sure, I could do that, but I don't have all day to babysit, lad. We decided you'll be a rider, so you need a horse. Figure the rest out yourself!” With that she thrust the reins into Harry's unprepared hands, her fingers cold as ice, and turned to leave. She had barely taken a step though, when she suddenly spun around as with an afterthought and for the bat of an eye Harry could've sworn her face was young and beautiful. “Harry, you say... Here, I think this belongs to you, Master Harry,” she mocked. Next she plucked the floral wreath from her head and shoved in onto Harry's and before the newly crowned boy could utter more than a surprised stutter, she had spread her wings and flown away.
“Tillie, no!” Finally, the owner of the first voice had appeared: It was a house-elf, spindly arms outstretched, reaching for Harry. The shine of the fairy lights that the creature wore as a dress was hundredfold reflected in the huge eyes.
“Watch it, Potter! Don't you fall down now,” Draco scolded and tipped his head back a bit. The hands disappeared back behind his hairline.
Later... or next year or in ten years. That didn't matter anymore. They would be together. Something warm and pleasant enveloped him as he watched tiny specks of gold dance in his lover's hair. This was home. After all the hardship they had had to endure, they had finally arrived.
“Then I better be quick!” With that, Potter catapulted himself from Draco's head and into the water.
Not that the tosser would appreciate the save. “Let go of me, Potter! Right this instance!” Malfoy tried to push Harry's arm off and elbowed him hard in the stomach while doing so.
Potter had been there that day, alongside Granger and Weasley. Draco frowned. Why had they been together? Must have been a coincidence...
Much to Harry's astonishment, Ember had been the one to not say a word about the child. He had been keeping it since Harry had shoved it into his arms; without complaining.
“It's not like that,” Draco growled, wishing himself very far away. Why, oh why, did he think of coming here?
Today, the lead had been promising: A Muggle in Switzerland had told a local newspaper (that Granger had somehow unearthed, she really was a clever girl, Draco had to give her credit) that in most years, the
“Cat got your tongue?” the Irishman joked before suddenly turning stormy-faced. “You're not still thinking you're better than us?!” He thumbed Draco hard in the upper arm. Ouch.
The real Harry glanced at the to-do-list for Patchers, that now, with the school running, had been put into a corner at the stairs. There weren't that many jobs left, but Harry already knew where he would go anyway, so he dismissed the written tasks in favour of strolling over to the plaques.
Malfoy only hesitated for a split-second, then he performed a Bubble-Head Charm (a new fashion for students these days, since after the departure of Fred and George, people had taken to imitate them and throw Dungbombs and Stink Pellets to undermine Umbridge's reign) and put Harry onto his head (“Hold tight, Potter!”).
right. Anne here knew who Scoffer was in her heart and she called him by his right name: the name she thought was right for him. Only she alone could do it really. After all, everyone else had forgotten about Scoffer. She was the only one who remembered him in both worlds.”
If Draco allowed the thought at all (which he rarely did), seeing Potter in the Triwizard Tournament had been the turning point that had made Draco realise that he didn't quite hate the other boy as much as he liked to proclaim.
should have listened to the Slytherin, he was not about to admit it. Also, somehow, hearing his own voice say things like that about Malfoy bothered him immensely...
“It's okay now.” A warm female arm wrapped itself around Draco softly. “I'm okay. You're okay. We're okay. It's all good.”
Just a few strokes and he had slipped between the bars and busied himself with the opening mechanism.
“Well, I could do with a bit of dancing... Milady?” Ron bowed exaggeratedly and held a hand out to Hermione who giggled and took it. They followed George, leaving Harry alone with Ginny.
been doing it wrong (he'd done counterclockwise loops, no wonder it hadn't worked properly), he took in his companion's appearance. Potter looked tired. He always looked tired these days, but today even more so than normally. His skin had an unnaturally dull pallor to it and there were dark circles under his eyes.
Malfoy moved to look at his 'arm-chair', digging his shoulder into Harry's. “Are you actually daft, Potter? Prefects can
Draco blushed hard and reached for the incriminating evidence. “Show that to me! Impossible – these notes had disappeared! Hunt magic would erase everything I wrote about you.” He thumbed through the pages, his face incredulous.
Ever since that morning when Granger had wished the boys 'a happy Three Kings' Day' (as it was the sixth of January), her redheaded wastrel of a boyfriend had had nothing better to do than to refer to the three of them as kings and mock Draco, calling him 'Your Majesty' in that particular tone that meant 'You Git'. Draco had stayed stoic (for Potter!), but inwardly it gnawed at him that he had to put up with something as childish as this. Well, Weasley
“Well, as you obviously took me here to verify something and seeing that that didn't work, can I go now? I
“See?” Malfoy's voice was calmer now and by way of experiment he titled the cup and their hands first to the left then to the right. “My fingers are stuck to the handle. You try it.”
“Everyone remember the rules?” Half took over, eyeing them all sharply. “We hide our flag here; the other team hides its. Whichever team finds the rival contenders' flag first, wins. If you yourself get 'captured', you have to return to Holle's Pond and wait till the end of the game.” He was pacing between them. “That is unless you can find or create a permitted hiding spot – which can be what, Wolfe?”
On Boxing Day they would juggle a short (!) visit to Draco's parents in France for a Christmas brunch (Draco very much shuddered at the thought already), several charity events (for Manor Library, H.E.D.W.I.G., S.P.E.W. and the Ministry) during the day ('duty hopping' was what Harry had dubbed this), a late tea with Aunt Andromeda and Teddy, a dinner party with Harry's Quidditch team and a Patchers' party at Hogwarts in the evening before a Slytherin get-together at night.
“Fine, have it your way. See if I care.” Harry crossed his arms in front of his chest. He should have listened to himself. He generally gave himself very good advice (though he very seldom followed it).
Well, so was Draco: “What the hell, Potter, that was ages ago and I apologized for that, didn't I? Ask Hagrid, shit, ask Hippo. 'I'm sorry', how many times do I have to say it?”
Harry swept Draco up, peppering his face with kisses so enthusiastically that Draco had to hold the ring box high in the air for it to not be knocked out of his hand. Typical. He was trying to be thoroughly romantic and Harry just– cupped his face with both hands and kissed him. Kissed him like he'd never kissed him before, like Draco was the world. They should've tasted like Christmas dinner and Butterbeer, but to Draco their kiss had the taste of love and incredible joy.
“That's nice,” retorted Malfoy, eyes becoming slits. Then he turned to Harry. “Quick, think of a way out.”
They stared at each other for a long second, both marvelling about the miracle that brought them back together.
By the time the birds came swooping in, the four teenagers had resigned to a break and were mid-game into a round of Exploding Snap.
“Well, since you're here, how about some help? I tried these spells,” Malfoy pushed a list of crossed-out words at Harry, “but they didn't stick, so I was thinking maybe...” And he went into a long-winded explanation about the balance of spells and their characteristics of which Harry didn't understand half.
Well, that would definitely be an explanation. Though Harry wasn't so sure about that. “I don't think this is a dream, Malfoy.”
“Whatever.” Harry rubbed his right hand which still tingled from Malfoy's glued-to grip earlier. He faced his mirror version. “So, how should we do this?”
“It's New Year's, you prig,” the other boy returned tenderly, wiping gently a tear from Draco's cheek.
Draco dipped his head at him thankfully. “Alright, again from the top: His name is Harry Potter. He’s 18 years old. He was snatched from the Hogwarts grounds, near the southern walls tonight close to midnight. As to why I can only guess: Because he looked illicitly at The Wild Hunt. It is they who have taken him.”
Merchieftainess Murcus pondered on this for a moment, before she said: “Very well.” She swam to the archway and settled under it by balancing on her tail. “Sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.”
He led them upstairs into a small nursery with pastel-coloured walls and a sleeping baby in a cradle by the window.
Draco shivered and continued to leaf through the book. "Oh look, Teddy! This cat here looks like Howard." He offered the picture for the baby to examine, but the little one had fallen asleep while Draco had been reading.
Malfoy, cheeks pink, had sat up straight and now looked at Harry down his nose. “Obviously, Potter. It would have been beneficial if you were a bit more... dignified. If you were, you wouldn't hang out with Weasley and that Mudblood Granger,” while Harry swelled to explode at these words, Malfoy perked up, a leer on his lips, “and you might have even been co-captain of the Inquisitorial Squad.”
While they were whispering and prodding at the thread, Harry detected that each of them were similarly wearing a string-bracelet around their left wrists. All of theirs were red though, while Harry's was – “White! It's white! Do you see that? It's really white!” BraveHeart nearly pressed his nose into the cotton with agitation.
had to change – and that included avoiding listening to plain old bigoted comments. He would not leave those ideas unexamined back into his life.
“If I did,” Malfoy replied between gritted teeth and rolled his trouser legs down again, “I need not have waited for
That was also evident in the way they moved through the nightly castle now: Knowing every shortcut, every hidden corridor, Ron and Hermione dashed almost inaudibly through the deserted hallways, changing course only when the Harry- and Malfoy-dots on the map did.
As Snowdrop looped around the gang, Harry followed her with his eyes, taking in the bizarre picture: riders of every shape and form on all sides. There were also many people on foot, seemingly running in the open air. The sight was quite something, especially with the various animals in the crowd.
, as in, it belongs to Perchta” the redhead grumbled and dropped the same strand of hair for the third time.
Apparently encouraged by this, Warrington plucked the writing tool and offensive scroll from Ron and proceeded in reading out loud what Hermione had composed:
“There. Can I have my, er, I mean, Potter, can I have Potter back, please?” Malfoy held out one hand in demand.
He had been too lazy to use the long way round to the Patchers' entrance and had entered the castle through the front portal instead.
“I don't,” said the little person and swept some dried leaves off their moss. “But I do appreciate the help earlier.”
Potter stewed on this for a moment, then added in an even smaller voice: “I think the tea had other side effects besides shrinking me. I'm seeing things. Like, right now. Over there, I see a very old frog and a fish, dressed in bright yellow livery, with enormous boots and wigs that look like powdered hair that curls all over their heads. They're holding lanterns.”
Tuesdays were Manor Library planning days and Hermione would show up around noon to discuss details (although he'd never acquiesced to be involved in that project in the first place), as well as her husband in the afternoon with questions on some potions Draco had agreed to help with for the shop (big mistake).
, no other reason). The only problem was that every morning, Draco had forgotten what he had dubbed his new pet, so that he had finally given in and chosen a congeneric name: Howard; nasty, common name.
“Right, sorry. The thing is, we all recognised you as a Somewhen Thing, as someone we had met before. You were one of us from the moment you stepped into our group and therefore we wanted to spare you heartache. Hunt magic is very peculiar, there are many mysteries about it. One of which is the fact that newbies sometimes arrive with remnants of memories, but they will without a doubt eventually lose them all over time. We just helped to hurry that process along in order to make you forget about wanting to leave, so you wouldn't be disappointed.”
“So was I. And I saw Potter beat him. Just as I saw Potter being spirited away by The Hunt tonight. If you don't believe me, look it up.”
! Don't even joke about that!” Harry proclaimed hotly and subconsciously tightened his grip around Malfoy's mid-section while firmly pushing all thoughts about the late Cedric deep into a corner of his mind. “I'd rather have you in Durmstrang and not getting on my nerves, but certainly not dead. Geez, Malfoy, stop being such a drama queen.”
'This bloke's crazy', was what was going through Draco's mind, swiftly followed by, ' I better get out of here'.
hot topic) and was therefore forced to visit Diagon Alley, a place that was still a minefield for him as an ex-Death Eater. There had been uncomfortable encounters before.
Draco swallowed. If Potter hadn't come for him, back in the Room of Requirement, he would have burnt. Like Vincent.
“Nope. You're the first to know, mate.” Weasley slapped Draco playfully on the shoulder. Mate. Huh, that was new. “You're coming, right?”
Harry's smile however felt wavering. He couldn't decide whether The Hunt was good or bad. Did it rage and harm so violently that people offered things to thwart it? Was it really responsible for wars? Or did people only
Finally, he stopped in front of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and took a deep breath. Through the shop's windows he could clearly see that the inside was packed with more people than should be allowed. But he still needed an uplifting gift for Greg as he was to stay in St. Mungo's during the holidays, although he was already much better. There was the chance that he could be released soon after New Year's.
He glanced over at Potter, who took this very moment to groan in frustration. “I need a break. Malfoy?”
“How about the fact that you would without a fail come to save him?” Half cut in, taking pity on a Harry who quickly turned into a tomato. “And you did.”
“Weren't we all?” had Hermione said and had patted the house-elf's head. “I'm not angry. We're friends after all, aren't we? Friends fight sometimes.”
Involuntarily Draco's gaze followed a single drop of water trickling down Potter's muscular abdomen. Upon realizing, where exactly he was looking, Draco blushed and bashfully turned away, when Potter got ready to drop the towel.
They had travelled to Sweden, woken up a crumpled-looking farmer (“Good morning, Mr. Withane, this is my paramour Harry. Harry, Mr. Withane. We've found The Hunt. Let's go.”) and dragged him and his ever-sleeping baby out to the farm road crossroads they were all currently standing on.
“Wales. The book mentions that the sightings of The Hunt are often limited to one night of the year. Say it's tonight, then we have to get there before the sun comes up. Now, will you hurry? We have to leave!” With that she ripped the outfit out of Weasley's hands and pushed it onto Draco. “Get dressed. We wait outside.”
“I guess not,” he groaned. “What did we do last night? Hell, what did we do all of yesterday? My memories are hazy...”
The Alice books are open source, so if you feel like reading them and finding all the little points of contact,
Why had he not taken his Invisibility Cloak? What had made him think for once everything would work out for him? Really though, just his luck to run into
Harry ran a hand through his hair, subconsciously mirroring the movement made earlier by his counterfeit. “I wouldn't know where to start. Hell, I don't even know if there's anything to talk
Harry followed him down, carefully sliding between threadbare bolsters. “Let me guess: You have weak ankles.”
Harry blushed at the implication. 'Other half' sounded so... married? He glanced at Draco, who glanced back. Yet, developing this thought further, did that mean Berchthold and Holle...? The image was too weird, Harry pushed it far away.
The Wild Hunt was disappearing in the distance, but one lone figure came careering back to the cliffs.
“And who was it that just ran us into... what is that anyway?” Potter sounded more curious than agitated. Of course he would, bloody Gryffindor nosiness.
entering since... He shuddered and was ever so grateful that Draco had insisted on accompanying him. Harry could have done it alone. It would have been wiser to do it alone, not to put Draco in danger who knew so much and yet so little. But it was too late now, they were already walking. Walking through the pitch-black Forest.
When Draco had told them he had to go, a few minutes later, the merry bunch had tried to convince him to stay “Just a bit longer!”, but Draco had waved them goodbye.
Ada nodded. “Yes, this is where all your dirt is pushed into our lake. But not to worry, little boy,” (“I'm fifteen!”) “your clever magic doers have put a spell on the pipes so that they filter and clean all sewage before it enters here. So it should be clean.” She smirked. “At least the lower part.”
“Er, we, that is, the thankful wizarding community would also like to, er, unveil something if that is alright with you, Headmistress?” A plumb woman had stepped forward and shrank visibly under McGonagall's stern appraisal that said wordlessly that she was
“Yeah, but you have lived here longer now than I had before that." With that Potter turned to leave.
He quickly shook off the thought and turned his gaze away. It was almost unbearable to observe those two so close together anyway. It hurt his eyes like looking directly into flickering lights.
Harry felt guilty although he'd really only been gone for twenty minutes tops. Seeing Draco scared like that was unnerving, but also very heart-warming, in a twisted way: When Harry had been a child, there had been times when he'd been gone for hours and no one had asked after him at all. It was nice to have someone who cared. Of course, his friends cared for him, too, but somehow this felt different, safer, warmer.
? And three: I know for a fact, that was a joke. But since he understands you so well and how nosy you can be, he planted your real gift here and I'm sure he would have told you that if you had asked him,” Draco chided sternly, “which you didn't, did you?”
“Well, there's a moving flight of stairs near the Hufflepuff common room that apparently glitches a lot. I was thinking of having a look at it.”
It had been odd, like some sort of thinly-veiled presence: Ever since they'd rounded the corner and entered this particular corridor, the clock had tucked at Hermione's attention. Even with her mind focused on Harry's sudden disappearance, she had noticed the little rabbit statue on top of the clock-face.
Thankfully that didn't happen all too often, as real life had a lot of plans for professional athletes and free-lancing people-finders alike.
He'd tried to distract himself by watching Malfoy climb out of the pipe through which they'd swum back into the castle. The new size gave a new perspective and Harry had found it very entertaining to see Malfoy go “ugh” and “blech”, shaking first his hands and then his whole body like a dog after the rain.
He couldn't catch the fleeting thought, so he slumped down next to the fire, still breathless. The others joined him, even Snowdrop decided to make an appearance after having fled the scene before, presumably in fear of being hit by a stray snowball. She hooted contentedly as Harry started petting her and nibbled his ear.
“I will. And I will fix us, too. If you let me.” Draco looked at his friends one by one: the ones he was close enough to call them by first name and the ones he still referred to by last name after old pure-blood etiquette. He had missed them. So much. “I'm sorry I just disappeared on you. I... was dealing with stuff.”
“Hermione!” Ron came slithering into the common room, the Marauder's Map in one hand and Harry's Invisibility Cloak in the other. “Hurry! We need to go, save Harry! Come on!”
Now, with mixed feelings, he watched Granger and the Weasel who were hand-in-hand eyeing farming equipment in the distance. It was helpful to have them around, especially the witch, but it was also still strained at times, particularly between the two wizards.
“It's okay, just some joke card,” he told the bird. Mhm, Hedwig would surely have liked the company. Now that he knew she was happy at The Hunt, Harry thought he would finally be able to accept a new owly companion in his life. He would treat Draco’s owl, this new owl, well.
It was around noon when the heat of the sun finally triggered him to get up. After a good sulk, he felt better now and was ready to at least try to find someone to communicate with.
Kreacher's snout-like nose wobbled when he stared at Draco with as much indignation as he could muster. He didn't talk back though.
Getting out a message to his friends during all that chaos earlier (and without Malfoy noticing) hadn't been easy, but he had managed and been so relieved to get any reply at all. Though, furrowing his brows, he wondered once again what
And with the unspoken acknowledgement that they were both screwed up and were both trying to move past that, they had settled into a quiet truce that saw them often working together these days.
Portrait-Harry looked down his nose. “Really? Because I could swear you've been checking the Marauder's Map to see if Malfoy's around before coming here tonight.” Harry choked. “That's what I would have done anyway. And for your information, he's probably at the Slytherin common room.”
Ada lacked the chipper behaviour of her twin, that much was obvious. Her gaze was hard on Draco. “Let's go then. Take a horse.” She snapped her fingers and one of the riders unmounted. “Typically Mabel. She's always been a bit dim.”
Something very complicated happened on the blond boy's face and Harry wondered just how hard it must be for the other to put aside the ideological indoctrination of his upbringing.
“We're here. Just, please don't speak. I'm not in any danger, I think, but you could be, so stay hidden.”
Harry had the suspicion that the house-elf  had somehow put a spell on the bed which told him whenever his master awoke from a bad dream in the middle of the night.
“Look, look, Seeker! It's starting!” BraveHeart nodded excitedly at Holle – no, Dormarth – who was quickly surrounded by a pack of red-eared white dogs with goose voices.
, The Beginning, is also her. Or at least a version of her. I never really understood it myself. But basically, it's something like Perchta's reincarnation or maybe a part of her?”
Draco looked up excitedly. “Sound familiar? It's a bloody forgotten stanza to The Hunt's Lullaby! Yes!”
Especially since he had the nauseating feeling that time was running out: There were days it took until after breakfast till he remembered
The other boy seemed to have a similar reaction as he went bright pink and started stuttering:  “It's not– I'm not– Don't you dare think that I would–”
“Food?” he asked again. “Dish? What are you all talking about?” Harry was puzzled, but his new friends (and really all of The Hunt) had started migrating towards a corner of the field and didn't grace him with an answer. So he followed, more out of curiosity than peer pressure.
“...neither did you, I guess. Probably wasn't great to be back down in the lake.” It was barely a whisper and hadn't Malfoy pointedly cleared his throat, Harry might have believed himself imagining things.
The announcer clapped once more. “When you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way,” (Draco peeked up and saw a few merpeople shooing the glowing mini-jelly-fish to the sides, so that a wide circle overhead was empty.) “advance twice, set to partners, change lobsters, and retire in same order. Then you throw the lobsters as far out as you can, swim after them, turn a somersault, return and recommence. Everyone clear?”
“He's so uppish,” sighed Queen Harry and put his chin in his hand while making heart eyes at the blond boy. Bleh. “Don't you just love it?”
When Seeker turned to look, he found that what he had thought to be a tree he had been sleeping under, was indeed a disproportional, green-tinged statue of a man pointing ahead,  riding on a horse. Seeker's gaze followed the outstretched hand and he became aware of a long straight trail framed by tree lines on both sides that was populated by a steady stream of strolling people. There were real, human people – amazing!
“Oh gosh, look at the time!” Hermione suddenly squeaked. “Merry Christmas, Draco! See you tomorrow!”
Harry tried about a dozen times with an increasingly annoyed Malfoy giving increasingly erratic instructions.
“All done, dear.” Madam Malkin smiled and waved her wand to disappear left-over fabric  from the floor.
'So are you right now,' thought Draco, but he didn't voice it. It was his own fault for being so forthcoming with a nosy Gryffindor. He exhaled slowly. It had felt good though to say these things for once. Keeping his feelings inside all the time was tiring. Maybe having a forgetful outlet for Potter stuff wasn't the worst side-effect of this disaster.
Potter's brows furrowed. “Why, you think you're too old to fly now just because you're out of school? Or what?”
That made sense and Hermione felt her cheeks warm at being classified as the leader with no one disagreeing.
Draco flushed scarlet and let go of Potter's robes as if they were burning, taking two steps back. Glancing this way and that but unable to meet the other's eyes, he reached for the powerful piece of wood, then hesitated. “Are you sure? I mean, you won it fair and square and... you defeated the Dark Lord with it.”
“Ah, right, look at this,” Draco quickly diverted, crossing the room to stand next to the shirt thief and ignoring the hot lump in his stomach that had formed when Potter had called him by his given name. “This Invisibility Cloak is yours, isn't it? I've been wondering about that.”
She made to pass the Slytherins, Ron at her heels, when Parkinson grabbed her arm, hard. “Hold on. You said Draco's in big trouble?”
“Okay~” Malfoy drew the word out and gave Harry a 'Geez!' look. “Bit young for Hogwarts, aren't you? But never mind that now. Do you know how to get out of here?”
Draco wiped discretely a tear from his cheek (which was futile, since he left a streak of lake water on it instead). Everyone in the circle had silently started weeping and for a moment, the water felt boiling hot for the pain of the merpeople.
It had been annoying. At least until Draco had recognised the signs. How Potter showed up just as late in the night as Draco to fix a corridor after a bad nightmare. How he relaxed doing simple, repetitive work during which he could turn off his thoughts. How he was always only ever hungry
They had been that age once... Thoughtfully her index finger wandered along the rim of a bright yellow cloche. Lately, the four friends had been fighting a lot. Mostly about Salazar's exclusive ideas on the picking of students. Really, what
Malfoy gave an inarticulate burble which he quickly turned into a cough, and refused to look at either Harry.
Suddenly, there was something to do with the endless hours of the endless days. Helping with patching up the castle seemed like a useful thing, like if he repaired the school he could somehow repair a piece of his messed up past.
“That's old Mr. Frog and his mate Mr. Fish. They are going to meet their bingo group down at the east end of the lake,” Mabel said matter-of-factly and waved to the two passersby who promptly returned the gesture. She nudged Draco none too gently. “You are not very nice, are you?”
Next up were photographs taken at Draco's birthday in early June – a full room stacked with people who'd never dreamt of partying together, mostly former Slytherins and Gryffindors. It had been a blast.
He had wanted to re-connect at some point, but only after he would have found sure footing in his new beliefs.
Draco had shuddered at the unwelcome reminder of the dead schoolmate and had been about to throw the thing out as an idea had occurred to him. He then had taken to wearing the badge daily as a memento, another ritual.
The pursuer collided with Harry's back in full swing, catapulting them both forward onto the dangerously creaking construct. All Harry could do was to grab the handrail with one hand and Malfoy, who was en route to smash his head on the stairs, with the other; yanking him close around his middle.
The private library next to his bedroom was full to the brim with dozens of dictionaries in different languages, allowing Draco to use the full potential of his brain and learn bits and pieces of several new tongues simultaneously. He often sat in there, comparing this version and that, until late into the night, with Howard curled up in Draco's lap, purring. At least that darn cat was good for
Draco had stayed at home, for he hadn't wanted to intrude in the twins' moment. It had been terrible hours, waiting and worrying.
During one of these sessions, they had discussed why Potter hadn't left The Hunt back then and just went home with them.
That night, before reciting his mantra, he reflected on what Pansy had mentioned about his heart being with someone else. His thoughts at least were always with Potter whether back in school or now. But obviously that was only because they were rivals and all.
He rounded at the girl. “Did you know?” She winced and Seeker stared at her and then at the others, disbelievingly. “Did you
Harry smiled. “Yeah, I know my friends are alright now. That was the biggest burden. Also seeing my life from the outside, so to speak, with The Hunt as a buffer, I came to terms with a lot of things. I think I'm more chill?” He laughed quietly. “And I have you now, don't I?”
while feeling like utter opposites. Black and white, tall and small, male and female, flames and snow. They were one and the same and yet different entities.
Mabel's hand landed on his shoulder. “Trust us, Malfoy, it'll help. We may not have magic like you do, but we
of ours.” Potter's index finger wandered distractingly over Draco's palm, causing goosebumps. “I like it when you call me Harry. I like you.” His tone was casual as if he hadn't just unhinged the world.
“I'm confused,” Draco cut in before Granger could dive into explaining all about this Odin. That could take hours. “Did your daughter get stolen or not? Because it sounded like she was still here with you, but now you say they've taken her?”
“What was that?!” Potter's voice had a sharp edge to it that made Draco pause. That hadn't been such a terrible jab, so why was Potter getting so worked up? “If
Draco studied his fingernails. “If you ask nicely, I might do it for you. You know, for that whole queen debacle.”
I think that this might explain what happened to Peacock,” (Draco looked up, he was surprised she still remembered enough to use a false Potter name.) “which is probably that, because he got taken alive, memories of him went away with him. Whereas the memories of the dead stay behind because they went on their own free will. Does that make sense?” She looked at Draco. “What about the affinity to death  bit though? Do you think... he had a death wish?”
July had brought new reasons to celebrate and Harry had gotten two birthday parties, so make up for the year he had been with The Hunt. (Although he'd assured everyone that it wasn't necessary because the Fallen Four had thrown him a party last time. Draco had just rolled his eyes at him then and had waved him out of the kitchen. As if Draco would let Harry cheat him out of his right to dot on the birthday boy twice. Huh!)
Of course they would fight a lot and compete and yell and whatnot, but they would also laugh and kiss and complete each other; because for a long time they'd been parallel-running lines and now that they had eventually collided, it turned out that their differences worked as each other's strengths, one's shortcomings evened out by the other.
Gregory sat in the middle of the chaos cross-legged on the floor, clutching a bottle of Firewhisky, three empty predecessors already piled up.
Draco felt irritation bubbling up, but he pushed it down and concentrated on the saplings instead, back turned at Potter. “I'll have you know that I am decent with the kitchen elves these days; they sometimes bring me food while I'm patching. So, not
Professor Flitwick seemed to have had some ‘nightcaps’ on his own already, since his overly cheerful face spotted ruddy cheeks and slightly unfocused eyes.
Even though the other witch didn't look like she ever used any, she had quite the knowledge about make-up and such. Well, probably because she was a know-it-all.
They were all but back to normal, however Seeker wasn't ready to let go of the conversation just yet. “What about Dreamer then?” he almost yelled over the carefree commotion.
“A long time ago, when I was still young, my tribe lived off the shore of Islay. We were a proud people. In a way, we considered ourselves Scots; even though we loathed the humans, with their fishing and their polluting.”
She blinked. “Ah, yeah, we... sort of lived there for a while? Last year when we were on the run from Voldemort.”
“Well,” Draco chimed in, “if there's something you excel at, it's surely making a sacrifice for the greater good. I'm glad people finally appreciate that.”
Harry gave him an awkward look at that, but it wasn't the right moment to question that comment. Or think about the fact that Malfoy apparently cared – at least enough to not leave him here.
It was that very night when, unbeknownst to Seeker, a certain blond boy of nineteen and a half years went to bed after a long day of last minute Christmas shopping.
Alright, if he wanted to play it this way. “Nah, I can't let you be the only one looking like shit.”
“She used to joke that we should just run away together, live in a place that was only for us. She called it Yonder Hill.”
It had started in the morning with Wolfe serving candy apples for breakfast... Seeker had only found out after the first hearty bite that they were indeed candy
The red queen chess piece ran across the board and drew a dagger. Harry could only duck by a hair's breadth. He had no time to go for his wand as his opponent was viciously aiming to kill. He stumbled and only slender fingers curling around him and lifting him up saved him from being run through by the deadly weapon.
Eyeing Draco from the side, Harry hesitated for a moment. This was a lot to drop on someone. But Draco was strong. He could take the truth. “Because I left it there, the night I died.” Draco inhaled sharply and Harry felt his heart go out to him. “Tell you while we walk? But you put this on, okay?” Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak around Draco's shoulders and stepped back to look at him. Of course, there  was nothing to look at as Draco had vanished from sight.
“Now!” Elsie giggled and climbed down. With prods, she steered a begrudging Malfoy into a corner where an easel was propped onto an old chair with only three legs. Pointing at a dilapidated rocking horse, Elsie happily got to work digging through a clutter of paint and brushes.
He staggered to his feet, bit his lip to stop it from trembling, forced his features back under his Malfoy-mask and said with the haughtiest voice he could manage: “I'm alright, just a tiny scare. Not to worry. Now, I think, I can handle the rest of the research by myself.”
Not very encouraging, but Harry still ventured on: “You can play tough all you want, but you won't be able to hold this position much longer and as I see it there are only three ways this can end: Either you lose your grip and land face-first on the stairs while probably breaking both your shins in the progress or you can try standing upright again and sink in deeper, maybe wholly.
, let's call them that – they don't really have left-over business, but still feel an attachment to the living, mostly because they died at a young age. They are offered a position amongst the riders and once they have accepted it, The Hunt's own magic makes them corporeal so they can for example grab people, like Palfrey. They take on the purpose of The Hunt. Both of these types are usually just referred to as 'ghosts' by wizards and Muggles alike.”
Harry bent down and picked up the glowing item. He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand, three times. Then, deliberately, he dropped the stone back onto the ground. He would not need it again.
“Till the argument is over – or in our case until after the game,” elaborated Queen Harry and gave Malfoy a winning smile. “But we could just leave him like that and–”
“Do you know what date it is? Right, how could you: It's July 31st, his birthday. He's nineteen years old today. Imagine that. Next year I'll know him almost half my life...”
Halting in front of the entrance to the common room, Harry finally pushed the thought away. He knew the hidden door to be behind a bare stretch of stone wall in the dungeons, although it had been years since he'd been in this particular corner of Hogwarts. He grinned; back then he had also come here because of Malfoy, even though at that time Harry had been wearing a Goyle-costume.
“Food?” Harry had also been stiffly attempting to climb off Lightning, only to be unasked aided by Ember. The cinder boy was still not easy for Harry to be around, even after sharing a ride for the better part of the day. He looked at him askew. “Thanks, Ember.”
“Yeah, that's right,” BraveHeart repeated, trying to sound wise, “love is the most powerful connection.”
,” Half took over, pointing at Holle's Pond, “is the entry. They say if you get real close to the edge, inside you can see a silver castle surrounded by a garden full of flowers, fruit and vegetables. Fun fact, one part of that actually belongs to Berchthold. He has his herbs garden down there. But aside from him and Holle, no one can enter the pond. That is, if you want to come out again: Anyone falling into the water will travel to the underworld immediately. So, I wouldn't recommend taking a swim.”
O-D-E-N-S-J-A-K-T,” dictated Granger, but her eyes were on their host. “Does that come from Odin, the god of thunder and lightning?”
“All went well,” Harry had confirmed. “Really well. They bragged about their girlfriends and were like they'd always been. George behaved most of the time, too. Didn't cause too much turmoil at The Hunt.”
Truly, a troop of kangaroos jump-swam past, their tails coordinating their up-and-down motions and a red glow emitting from their tribal paint pattern on their fur.
“And with good reason. You have to stop drinking, Greg.” Draco had never used the abbreviation before, but now it felt right, more intimate. He lowered himself next to his friend. “It's killing you.”
To Harry this was all weirdness, but everyone else seemed totally fine, so he watched them eat, his eyes gliding over to settle on the leaders of their cortège.
Malfoy gave a scandalised snort, but Queen Harry cut in: “I don't mind being the queen in this relationship, Draco darling,” he fluttered his lashes, "as you are
friend? This is all bullshit,” (“George, language!”) “and I don't believe a word coming out of your mouth,
“I'm fifteen!” spat Draco, seriously getting miffed now. “And we're leaving. Good day! ...I mean, night.”
Draco watched as Potter skilfully caught the handle of his mug in flight. His silhouette was soused in warm colours from the firelight. He looked good, hell, he looked great. Much better than the last time Draco had seen him. Gone were the dull pallor and the dark circles. Potter had filled out as well, not resembling a starving teenager all that much anymore. Healthy, he looked healthy, Draco concluded. 'And attractive', added an unbidden voice in his head that he pointedly ignored.
The answer came like a shot: “Window side, left-ish, three rows down from the second big walkway intersection, more to the front you'll find all substantial writing on class work, chest height.” Triumphantly, Weasley raised an eyebrow at her.
Curious. They must have hit him with a spell while walking. Weird how he hadn't felt anything. But with hallucinations like this, a head injury was certain.
Draco snorted. Yes, of course he'd heard of The Wild Hunt – in lullabies and old wives' tales. That's all it was though, a story for children. “The Wild Hunt? Are you kidding? That's a made-up fairy tale.”
Harry blinked and tinted. Oops, that had been unintentional. “I mean, you have a fun nickname for me, so?” he tried to bluff it out. “But if you don't like–”
Harry felt warmth bubbling up inside him. This side of Malfoy was so rare. How was it suddenly so cute that Malfoy was looking out for his younger housemates? Harry frowned. Wait, what?
The snickering girl sobered and turned to look at her black horse. “I'm not completely sure, actually. But I have a feeling that, yeah, it feels like in life I might have owned a pet named Binky? I can't really explain it, but when I first met her, the name popped into my head as if it had been waiting for her.” She shrugged helplessly.
“Belt up, Potter,” was the answer, but it didn't have any heat. Maybe there was still hope for the bigot git after all.
Uh oh. Seeker peered around the tree he'd taken cover behind: One of his team mates, a moss person, was on the verge of being captured by– Ember, of all people, bloody hell.
. We just ran into each other. But that's not what matters. What matters is that he needs rescuing.” He felt faint all of sudden. “Please,” he added almost inaudible.
In any case, Harry tried to subtly wriggle himself free, at least his wand arm, but the old house-elf's grip was vice-like.
“You stop it! I'm falling, so I have to hold on!” Potter snapped back and pulled some more, for good measure. Ah, fuck it.
Ice cold fear trickled down Seeker's back. He had been feeling increasingly faint since this morning, but he had thought that that had been because of his tries to get attention.
Okay, so this song? It does not represent any sexist/gender/political/racist/whatever opinions of mine, so please don't interpret anything. It's just for the LOLs, really.
“Nope, definitely the lake,” responded Potter in a tone that alerted Draco. That was Potter sounding serious.
So Draco was about to destroy everything that was good and wonderful in his world. He closed his eyes for a moment. It had to be done.
“I'm not ready!” Malfoy's tense voice was way too loud in the stadium. He had whipped around. “I can't, alright? Not yet. I...” His features softened. “Can you tell her though? To wait? Just a bit longer.”
Draco would not lose them all though. He had promised himself that he wouldn't. His rituals would carry him through till Yuletide when he would finally get Potter and all the missing memories back.
“HALF! You bloody bastard!” Seeker didn't wait for the addressee to react,  but lunged forward and threw himself at the redhead, starting to pummel him.
“Shit!” Seeker yanked Lightning around at the very last moment, his legs brushing the young man's upper arm as he shot past.
“No need to sound so offended. It's not like any of you lot took good care of that dust-hole in ages,” Weasley scoffed and folded his arms across his chest. “Besides, you couldn't get in now even if you wanted to. The house is under a Fidelius Charm and you're not in on it.” Suddenly his eyes went small. “Or are you? Did your Death Eater pal Yaxley tell you the secret?”
Harry had to hold on for dear life at the sudden movement and he gave Malfoy's scalp a hefty smack. “Careful! You nearly threw me off!”
Pansy rolled her eyes. The dramatics of those Gryffindorks, really. “Chill, Granger. Anyone who would happen to come across us would think he was talking to me – or run off for being spotted after curfew.”
), a shimmering, silver Jack Russell terrier appeared out of nowhere and, after hesitating for a second, dived nose-first into the ground – which was rather useless as they'd taken the long way round through the dungeons to avoid colliding with Peeves. There was literally only earth beneath the floor here.
don't have such a hideously goofy face. Why do I?” He frustratedly pulled at a lock of his disarrayed hair. “Still, I'm you, okay? I can keep my mouth shut if need be. I remember all our life up until being painted; I feel like you feel, so could you please stop being a dick to me. I didn't ask to be made!”
The barn Half had chosen as the goal, had clearly been built on top of an old road, the blurred outlines only just visible still.
“Good morning, sleepyhead! Fallen asleep at the fire, have we?” BraveHeart chirped into Seeker's ear and handed him a piece of dried meat. “Here. Breakfast's on the go.”
Draco found himself greeted by a dressed up Mother Weasley who hastily excused herself to look after various foods in the kitchen. That however implied under no circumstances that Draco was left alone – quite the contrary. Within seconds he found himself in the middle of a redheaded bundle, all talking across each other in the generously decorated living room.
“You will. You found me three times, you can find her, too. Besides, I know she is in good hands. She's with my friends.” Potter's voice was calm and saved Draco from spiralling. If she was with the dead Hogwarts students, she was indeed not in danger, but still...
Nothing happened. Cursing wildly, Malfoy pocketed his broken possession and flashed his eyes at both Harrys. “This is all your fault. You're gonna pay for that. Queen to H-3!”
The cry was answered immediately by the dog next to the group, with a blood-curdling goose noise of its own.
That however had been the wrong thing to say, because Parkinson's face screwed up into a mask of panic. “Spring him?
“Woah!" Potter sobered. “I'm very sorry for your loss.” Mabel inclined her head. “But...” he continued thoughtfully, “if your grandfather was such a terrible person and chased your mothers away and even attacked them later, why is there a statue of him in your village square?”
Luna was there in the most bizarre and most Luna-esque dress that Harry had ever seen. Neville had come with his grandmother. Dean had come and Seamus and Parvati and Padma and all of them. There were Oliver Wood and Colin's little brother Dennis Creevey, Katie Bell, Justin Finch-Fletchley and the lot. Harry saw George flirting with Angelina Johnson. He saw Professor Slackhorn laughing jovially with Cho, Professor Grubbly-Plank clinking glasses with Hagrid. Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat at the excitement of meeting Harry again. Kingsley shook Harry's hand. Andromeda told a story about little Teddy's sleeping five hours straight the other night.
. He was Portkeying all over the world hunting The Hunt in libraries, museums and old people's tales.
Draco waited a moment, but nothing else followed. So, he ploughed ahead. “I know you have no reason to help me, but,” he hesitated, “you might be the only one who can answer my question about wandlore.”
“Ah, yeah, Harry tried that once,” Weasley scratched his nose. “Didn't go so well. He nearly got caught by Snape.”
“Almost time to go,” whispered BraveHeart and Harry's funny friends all turned solemn. The horses were made to stand up, the fire was extinguished. All around them, people did those same things.
The crone held up a hand and the murmuring of the crowd stopped. “Hunters! I'm off to bless the harvest on the fields and in the orchards. I'll be back. Don't do anything too stupid while I'm gone.” Seeker had the sudden weird feeling that she was looking directly at him. “Bless you all!”
“Er, yeah. Thanks I guess? That is, I mean, it was the normal thing to do, or not?” Potter stammered.
“Guess not,” Longbottom agreed. His expression turned thoughtful. “Do you ever think it's wrong to have fun at Hogwarts when so many of our friends died here?”
A tiny dot of light, not brighter than a lit match, threw an eerie flickering into the bubble, reflected by the round walls.
He sauntered over to the buffet, his gaze wandering between the dishes until he picked a piece of treacle tart.
the way to get rid of you? Had I only known that before. The trouble I could have saved me! Well, in that case: May I have this dance?" With a flourishing movement he got to his feet and offered a hand to Harry.
Harry hurried to continue with the story of the Deathly Hallows and the Horcruxes, how he had come into the possession of the former and destroyed the latter.
Not that he had nothing else to do with his time. When he wasn't playing detective, Draco was occupied with helping out with new potions recipes at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes or serving as the Manor library's contact man to all the libraries he had visited during his hunt for The Hunt. Also, there was always something to do for S.P.E.W. or the newly founded H.E.D.W.I.G. programme. Oh and sometimes, he liked to have a private life as well.
There was a pause and Draco could feel Potter gripping his hair tighter, whispering: “What happened next?”
Harry tiptoed into the Entrance Hall, although he could have saved himself the trouble as there was barely anyone living in the school now due to the fact that the whole building continued to be heavily under construction. Still, better safe than sorry. Waking up a few portraits had earnt him quite the scolding last time.
Harry had never seen Malfoy play, but it was quickly obvious that the blond boy knew what he was doing.
“Here you go.” A young merwoman floated next to them and thrust something hard and slimy into Draco's free hand. She had a tortoise in her arm that wore a collar inscribed with 'Mock Turtle'. She followed his gaze and then whispered in a conspiratorial way: “He thinks he's a turtle.”
His aunt was so different from other pure-bloods that Draco often found himself wondering how she had become like this in the household she had grown up in. But he hadn't dared ask her yet.
Over his shoulder, Harry gave him an odd look. “No? Of course not. But think about it: If they got married Hagrid would move to
When Harry had dropped the Resurrection Stone, back during The Battle of Hogwarts, he had thought that he would never find it again. And maybe he wouldn't have, but now that his brain had made the connection, the stone and The Hunt were linked and, as Harry had hoped, there was still some tiny bit of Hunt left in him. If one'd come so close to being a permanent part of The Hunt, something stayed behind, somehow... He had felt (and ignored) it ever since unmounting Lightning at the cliffs. Earlier, when they had entered the Forest, Harry had reached inside himself, found the piece of Hunt magic and followed it to this place. Just like back at Windsor Great Park when he had had to retrace his steps back to The Hunt encampment.
Draco soothingly carded his aged hand through Harry's grey hair. “Didn't really plan it like this, love.” He kissed the tip of Harry's outer ear. “Did you settle all our affairs?”
Turning the next page of the scrapbook, Draco had reached the festivities for the second anniversary of The Battle of Hogwarts which had been held on May second.
Peeling the gang members off, Harry smiled at the warm welcome: “Calm down, will you? I'm fine. Better than fine, actually. I'll tell you everything if you let me breathe. But, just, don't call me Seeker anymore, okay? I'm Harry again. Call me that. Oh and this is–”
Coming back from their trip, they had made good on their promise to Myrtle and had had, during ever-falling October rain outside, a surprisingly fun tea party at Hogwarts.
In his anger, Malfoy had drawn up too close to Harry's face and when the Gryffindor turned his head to look at the other boy, they suddenly found each other nose to nose. An embarrassing silence followed, until Malfoy pulled back with a huff, blushing just as hard as Harry.
“Oh, er, these are my back-ups.” BraveHeart held one out for the other boy to inspect. “What do you think about this one for you?”
“I made the Hallows hoping that someday a worthy person would come into their possession, making them the master of Death and, when they once would die – not by another's hand but of their own volition – they should shoulder the burden and become the leader of The Hunt. Until the next master would come along.” Her hair floated in the breeze as she turned to look at the masked man behind her. “I just wanted to end your curse. You've served long enough.”
Draco bit his lip hard and blinked away the upcoming mocking reply that tried to climb out of his mouth. He succeeded in turning the spiteful comment into a tame snort which was echoed by one of Granger's.
tell you though is this: The cloak has been an heirloom in your father's side's family for a long time. So long indeed that he had forgotten about it and I... let's say I made him aware that it was in his possession.”
“Nevermind. It's fine.” Draco coughed, extracting himself from the embrace. He looked as if he was highly embarrassed at being caught being so emotional. Harry found it terribly endearing. “So, what have you been doing in there?” Draco jabbed his chin towards the open library.
They picked up the pace then, not speaking until they'd reached the corridor adjacent to the no-longer-displayed staircase.
“One day I was late. I had not got away from my duties early and it was already sunset when I reached the coast.”
Potter gave him a taxing glower. “If you are thinking about complaining that I inherited your precious pure-blood heritage, don't. I had enough of that from your great aunt's portrait and let me tell you this,
“It's a loop. Somehow. I'm not sure how it works. I think though that this is where the staircase used to be – the one I saw Harry and Malfoy on – and that that staircase is gone now? Or at least the entry is blocked, and whoever tries to enter, even partly, is immediately spit out on this side of the door again.”
Certainly were there smarter things to do than to anger a teeth-armed wild animal, but the exhilaration of being seen and heard was enough to have Seeker throw all caution in the wind and crouch down.
“Yes, hello, Dobby. Sorry to disturb you so late at night.” Granger smiled. Pansy thought she was weird for talking to a servant so... politely.
As always (but this time especially) I would like to thank my nonpareil beta umbrellaless22 for making time in their busy schedule to reassure me and lift me up. 'Thank you' is not nearly adequate.
The startled hush that followed only lasted for a short reprieve. “Okay, but – I made Alice, thinking that she should give us an idea how to get out, and she did. And you made him, thinking what? That I... should like you?”
“Okay. He's got black hair, green eyes, terrible glasses, yae high. He went to school here. You've known him since he was eleven. Ring a bell?” It was only his frustration that made him talk to a higher-up in such a mannerless manner.
