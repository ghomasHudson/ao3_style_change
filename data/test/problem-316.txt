The Three Quays was a small, modern-appearing district with three arched, metal piers jutting into the Thames. Too-bright lights glinted off frigid beams in the early evening light.

Draco looked at him like he’d forgotten he was there, but obeyed.
“Yes, of course,” Scorpius said quickly, because the last thing he wanted was Jamie to be worrying about him, too. That was all anyone did, from his father to Harry and all his other professors, as well. They’d all been warned that Scorpius was sickly, that they were to bring him to Father’s office immediately should Scorpius suggest it. He knew it was a safeguard, to protect him, but Scorpius could only assume the whole school thought he was the most pitiable of invalids.
Harry was so bloody tired and wrung out he couldn’t even make sense of what Draco was alluding to.
“Yes. Well. Are you...having feelings about the split?” Ri ventured.
Stuff it, he might just risk it.
Footsteps sounded and Harry forced himself to look, relieved to see just the entrance hall, Professor McGonagall, Madam Pomfrey, and Ron standing over him, where he sat guarded by Hermione and Draco.
“S’alright,” Jamie replied, yawning. “Think I’ll just have toast.”
“Of course not,” Harry exclaims, but Clark doesn’t quite believe it. Harry will say anything to make someone feel better. He waits for Draco’s response instead.
“Right,” Harry agreed, “Well, er, thanks for the tea, delicious crumpets, truly,” Merlin, what was wrong with him, “‘Til tomorrow then.”
—that means like extra famous—gargler. That’s a juggler who specialises in garlic juggling.” She spoke with the confidence of someone who had just now read something in a book. It reminded Scorpius of Al.
“I’ve been thinking,” Lily said, her blue eyes serious. Merlin, she looked so much like Ginny that Harry almost wanted to look away. “I’m ten now, and I'll be headed to Hogwarts next year.”
“Why won’t you just leave me alone?” Scorpius whispered to that unseen presence. “I can’t tell you what you want, Father’s seen to that. And I won’t go with you, either. I’ll scream, I will.” The boy looked sick with terror and Harry had a terrible feeling that all this wasn’t just stemming from an overactive imagination.
, but in retrospect, maybe his admiration had been tinged with something else.
Weasley looked like he was trying his best to fabricate a reason to prevent the excursion, but wasn’t able to come up with an excuse in time.
“It is not, you conniving little—”
Clark sat sullenly across from McGonagall, who was taking the matter very seriously indeed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Granger used
“Yeah, whatever,” the boy muttered, staring at his hands.
“Hey, you,” Harry said, running his fingers through Draco’s lovely hair.
“Here’s the plan,” Seamus proclaimed. “Ron and Hermione, you take the left, Dean and me will take the right. We’ll cut a path with Protegoes, if necessary. Polite but firm, all smiles with Harry and Malfoy in the middle. If it gets to be too much, we’ll apparate to outside Hogwarts grounds and meet there, how’s that?”
“You really think she would dance with me? I thought she fancied Harry.” What. She couldn’t possibly still fancy Potter. That had been two years ago.
I think I’m in love with you. I know I’ve said that before but I didn’t actually mean it. I don’t really think I knew what love meant. But after tonight I realized. I realized because I would give anything for you to be happy again. It was as if I could feel everything you were. It hurts me to see you that way Harry. I don’t want you to feel pain. I want to give you the whole world. And fuck, I know that sounds stupid and cheesy and I’m a kid so what do I know about love. I don’t know many things about our insane world. But I do know that Draco Malfoy is hopelessly in love with Harry Potter. And he really hopes that Harry feels the same way.
“Nothing. Nothing, just-” And for a second Draco thought Potter was going to take a swing at his face but instead he pulled him closer and kissed him.  Harry. Potter. Kissed. Draco. Malfoy. And Draco’s heart absolutely melted. A small part of Draco’s brain was screaming that this was a terrible idea, but the rest of him was too busy kissing Potter back to care. His mouth was warm and his lips were so soft and perfect. This was perfect. Draco’s brain had gone fuzzy with joy. It seemed perfectly natural for their mouths to open and for them to sweep their tongues inside each other's mouths. Draco felt like he might fall over, his knees were shaking and the rest of him was practically vibrating with excitement. As their tongues touched Draco couldn’t stop the little sound he made at the back of his throat.
“Yeah so you can dump on my family!” Weasley took out his wand. This was ridiculous.
“Okay, show me. I’ll get my wand.” Luna hurried back into the room and came out with her wand, an angry Ginny trailing behind her.
Dear Potter,
Your worst enemy
“I don’t believe you. I’m going to find out what you’re doing.” Weasley spat.
He shook his head. “No, my father never wanted me to.”
Draco did his best not to think of Harry Potter for a while. Or as long as he could go. Which was only about 15 minutes. Though that was still worth something in his mind. He kept himself busy with Quidditch practice, he helped Luna find her shoes and find nargles hiding in the castle, and he...well the rest of the time he was thinking about Potter. Every time the mention of his name came up warmth would pool in the pit of his tummy and a pleasant feeling would spread throughout his whole body. He couldn’t help the way thinking of him made him feel. Soon the school year was coming to a rapid close and Draco had to spend more time on his school work instead of what Potter was doing at all times. The Buckbeak incident had been long behind Draco and he hadn’t really thought much about it since he’d received a letter from his mother making sure he was okay. Until Luna ran up to him after Potions with tears in her eyes.
“I’m merely being truthful.” she replied, crossing her arms.
Sincerely,
“Wow I’m starving! I think I need food because I definitely did not just eat before coming up here, see you later Sev!” Draco said in a rush, calling him Sev because he knew Severus hated that. He leapt off the chair and flew out of the common room, thinking he would go write a letter to Luna and complain about everything that was going wrong. He was on his way to the owlery when he hit something solid with an “Umph!”
“Don’t do that!” Luna said in exasperation. “I know it seems hopeless right now, okay? I’m not oblivious. I know it seems completely impossible from your point of view. But if there’s even the smallest chance in the whole world that you two might end up together you can cling to that. If you really do love him-Don’t look at me like that, you’ve always known I’m a sap.” Draco held his breath.
“Where have you been?” Luna asked, running up to him.
“Where have you been? I sent the signal to you like-”
Sincerely,
“Hey guys, what’s going on?” Potter came over, blushing furiously. As soon as he saw Potter’s bright red face he could feel his own face begin to flush.
One day while Draco was lying on the floor of the library when Luna came up to him with Theo and Pansy.
“Get in here.” Snape motioned quickly and Draco did his best to ignore his instincts to run in the other direction. They had already had this conversation. Was there really a need to have it again? Cautiously he entered the office and glanced around. He let out a small sound. Harry was here too, arms crossed and staring at the ceiling. When he saw Draco he stood, chair nearly falling over in the process.
Harry opened then closed his mouth. Draco clamped his lips together to keep them from trembling. He felt naked. Those were only meant for him. Those letters were his most secret possessions, he had never meant for anyone to see them. All of a sudden anger bubbled inside of him and he was finally able to speak.
“Er, do you think we could just do this in secret?” Potter asked hesitantly. Draco felt his heart drop a little but he knew it was a good thing Harry had asked that. (He was going to call Potter Harry now and no one could stop him) After all who knew what the dark lord would do if he got word of his death eater and Harry Potter kissing in the middle of the great hall.
Draco Malfoy
“Draco! Draco get your ass over here we’ve been worried sick!” Pansy called from where she was standing with Theo. Some of Draco’s excitement started to fade away at that. He had hardly spoken to Theo since he had kissed him under the mistletoe. Draco shook himself, these were his friends and he owed them some sort of explanation.
Draco felt his stomach tighten. He wanted to go back to a few minutes ago when he had been about to kiss Potter. He did not want to go inside the castle where there would be responsibilities and consequences and dark lord shite.
“...10 points from Gryffindor!” Snape was saying. Draco snapped his gaze upward. Class was nearly over, Snape had just taken his customary points from Gryffindor. Weasley was shaking and red with fury, and Draco expected Potter to look the same but when he turned his gaze back to him, he realized that Potter wasn’t looking at Snape. He was looking at Draco.
“I think everything is going to work out.” She said after they had calmed down a little.
Umbridge snapped her head in her direction, her eyes wide. “Why would you need to defend yourselves?”
“Draco!” Luna scrambled up from a bed and flung herself into his arms. “I was going to tell you where we were going but Harry wanted to leave right away and he was so worried, and I’m sure you were so worried too.” She sobbed into his neck. More quietly she said, “He’s really back, I-I, saw him. We all did.”
That night he sat in the common room, moping. He had to go on patrol in a couple minutes but he couldn’t bring himself to get ready. He wanted to stay here and think about how one of his closest friends had traded him for Potter. Luna hadn’t even ridden in the carriage with him.
Fuck. So he had nothing. Except an imposing death sentence that was ever approaching as the days continued mournly.
“Right!” She had gotten to her feet and started pacing the room. “So think about it! Something from ravenclaw most definitely, and then his stupid snake I guess.” She shrugged, eyes glinting with pleasure.
“It’s scary. Having blanks in your memory.” Ginny said softly, after a long stretch of silence. His conversation with Luna from a couple weeks ago poked at his memory. She was only 11, she didn’t know what was happening.
“Draco what the bloody hell are you doing in there?” Blaise called.
“No, I’ll stay. I have to go out and find potions soon though.” He pressed a hand to his eyes before glancing back at her. “We don’t have any here, and you’re going to need them soon.”
“That’s very true.” he said, glancing at the ceiling.
Draco opened his mouth to reply but before he could Narcissa said,
October 31st: A Translucent Crime (I'm going to write as much as I can before then and then release chapters like once a week as I continue to write.)
“I did! I knew before both of you. Honestly the two of you are so bloody thick sometimes.”
“And I was going to throw it away, because we can just make new ones now. But then I noticed that this one had a message on it.” She showed them the coin, even though he couldn’t read the message from here.
The few seconds he had been gone Harry had disappeared and Draco realized where he had gone. Severus said there was nothing they could do now unless they wanted to be dead as well. Following this Draco started screaming and Severus dragged him off back towards the castle, muttering something under his breath. Draco pretended to believe that Harry would come back to him fully alive and well. He explained to Severus that they still needed to kill the snake, as Ginny and Luna had figured out the whole diadem ordeal. Severus nodded seriously and said after the dark lord was dead it would be easy to finish the snake off. At first Draco hadn’t understood what he meant. When the dark lord is dead. It was something completely unimaginable. How exactly was the dark lord going to die? If Harry was going to his death, how was he going to finish the dark lord off in the process?
Oh. Now Draco felt a little less alone. Someone else he knew liked guys too. He tapped his quill to his lips and then wrote a reply. After finishing he sent the letter off with Theo’s owl, who had returned moments earlier, as if sensing they had another letter that needed to be delivered.
Dear Harry,
“Why do you want it?” Potter asked. Draco found no words. Potter was talking to him.
“Unbelievably excellent.”
“Bloody nothing! I wasn’t even bothering you tonight!”
“Draco.” Luckily it was only Severus. Draco knew he should fear him, yet something in him told him to wait.
“Oh, hi. I was just...sleeping.” he sighed and sat up, nearly falling over in the process.
“What is it?” he asked softly.
“Oh, hello there.” Cedric grinned at them. The other guy blushed and smiled sheepishly.
Harry’s eyes snapped to Draco’s, his face immediately softening. Draco nodded hastily, struggling to get up. Harry rushed over and took his hand gently. Draco knew it was entirely the wrong time but he pressed a kiss to Harry’s cheek.
“Ginny!” Luna said, with a groan.
“Are you alright Draco?” came Luna’s breathy voice. Draco paused. He was in the middle of the corridor and there was no one in sight.
“Luna, I really am fine,” he insisted. “Just didn’t sleep well last night.” She opened her mouth to reply when Harry walked by with the Weasel.
Dear Potter,
Draco apparated in front of Grimmauld place and fell to his knees panting. A dawning realization hit him. Hermione and Luna were still in the Ministry. All of a sudden a weight was being pressed down on his chest, and tears leaked from the corner of his eyes. They were still in there, they had left them there. Without meaning to, he began rocking back and forth, trying to get a grip on himself. He was fine. He should be getting inside and discussing a plan. Not vibrating on the front steps. He wasn’t helping anyone, he was a fucking failure.
Dear Potter,
“Suppose you’re right.”
“Okay…” He waited for his father to explain, growing a little more terrified by the second.
“He was trying to send us a message wasn’t he!”
“There’s food and water downstairs.” he said softly, looking back and forth between the two letters. One was from Luna, and the other was from Theo. He and Theo were good friends, but they didn’t really write to each other much over the summer. He decided to open the one from Luna first.
“Is something wrong?” Severus asked, he looked sort of pained Draco noticed. He had never been very good with the feelings.
“She’s not here! We checked she’s not in her room, not anywhere in the house and she didn’t leave a note!” Ginny was shaking her head in disbelief, Draco noticed her clench her trembling hands together.
Sincerely,
“Er, hey. I was just getting something.” Draco stammered, looking above her head.
Neville held up a palm to stem Harry’s enthusiasm. “We found out the hard way that it’s not terribly useful at Hogwarts,” he admitted, “but it is better than nothing. I’ll need something of his, preferably something magical.”
“It’s not a bad thing,” Hermione reassured him quickly, sensing his distress, “It’s nice thing, really, to want to take care of your...partner.”
“Oh, fuck off. I’m actually more of a minimalist. I like simple, clean lines, no clutter.”
“Mm,” Draco considered, fingers sifting through the hair at the base of Harry’s neck, “No, that’s just a convenient side benefit of my primary agenda.”
“What?” Potter asked dumbly. There was a pause while the Knut dropped. “Oh.”
After lunch, Draco spent some time steeping in the oversized clawfoot tub of the formerly grand ensuite off the master bedroom. His eyes were closed and he sipped hot tea. Harry wished he had some oils or something Draco would like for the bathwater, but he’d not planned for this contingency and had nothing on hand. He supposed he could charm something, but he’d rather not risk putting in something daft. Draco, for his part, didn’t seem fussed, so Harry put the thought to rest for the time being. He transfigured a little stool and perched at the head of the tub. He pulled off the tie that held Draco’s hair back, watching the smooth silver strands fall away, the tips floating atop the water.
Harry shrugged, “No, but I did everything I did to protect the people I love, and so did he. All while trying to keep me alive in what little ways he could, when it would have been easier for him not to. Honestly, I sometimes wonder if I was just lucky that things I had to do to protect those people were for the common good. I'm not sure what I would have done in the reverse situation." Harry glanced down the street, golden leaved trees neatly dotting the sidewalk. He exhaled, still trying to configure his thoughts, "So maybe he hasn't completely changed, but I think he wants to. I think he's trying to reconcile what he cares about with what he did. He wants a future for himself, who doesn't, that's not a fault. And he's definitely buried any pure-blood ideology nonsense, of that I'm certain. It's been a lot, this damned war, for all of us. I am so tired, Hermione. I want things to be easier.”
“With a bit more of this,” Harry replied easily. He tugged at Draco again, manoeuvring him downward until Draco’s head was pressed against Harry’s shoulder. “Relax, would you?”
“Yes, but that is only because you have the social skills of a solitary swamp dweller.” Draco had informed him, “You need to
“Mm?”
“I know,” Potter promised. “Not a syllable, to anyone, you have my word.”
Malfoy shot Harry a panicked look.
Bingham was clearly waiting for a reaction, so Al grinned at him. “That’s wicked! What sorts of things will be there, do you know?”
Draco considered, chewing thoughtfully on a bit of bacon Harry had served him. Most mornings he still filled Draco’s plate, mostly because he looked so quietly pleased when he did. “To what end?” he said finally. Malfoy’s voice was curious, not confrontational.
“Not much,” Harry admitted, “we only caught what I assume was the tail end.  A man saying something about destruction and not being able to bring her back? And about not standing by and watching her drown. Was it the Browns?”
Molly shook her head. “Not a day goes by that my heart doesn’t break for you and those children a little more.”
“The house elves falling over themselves to do your bidding, no doubt,” Malfoy rolled his eyes, “I bet when you go to the Forbidden Forest, all the woodland creatures gather about you like some princess in a storybook. Tell me, Potter, what is it like to have everyone just fawn over you at every turn?”
“Love you, too. Though I might not if your team beats mine at quidditch tomorrow. I know I’ve made great personal strides in the last months, but chances of me being a sore loser for life are high. Just so you’re warned.”
“Excellent,” Draco stated. “Finish your fruit, boys, then teeth, please, and get to bed. And Scorpius, you’ll need your medicine, so let’s do that shortly? It’s late.”
Some moments that could bring up some covid-related feelings. Sorry about that, definitely not making light of it! To avoid, please skip the scene in the Herbology greenhouse (it is the last section of the chapter).
Draco snorted at that. “Oh yes, that is what all the headlines say: ‘Harry Potter, dull as dishwater’.”
, it began in a scribble Harry was familiar with since childhood,
Tonight hadn’t helped, Al reckoned. Scor would be upset; he’d been miserable after his prophesying had been set off at the Leaky Cauldron that summer and he’d be extra exhausted tomorrow. Even Al had found it disconcerting, seeing Scor unconscious like that, and relying on Jamie to fill in the details. And then once he’d heard the facts, Al didn’t like them. If Main and Mulligan figured something out, would Scorpius be safe at the castle? Al didn’t trust Main and his lackey one bit. Would Professor Malfoy pull Scor from Hogwarts altogether and tutor him at home? Scorpius would hate that, being on his own, and Al had to admit he would hate it just as much.

“And my brain checks out?”
“I’ve got some muggle money for emergencies,” Harry said, “we'll go with you, make sure you get in alright."
Draco is seated in his favourite chair, but he’s clearly on alert, waiting to see what is needed.
Dudders. Harry had to keep from wincing, memories of Aunt Petunia fawning over the boy, while glaring daggers at Harry like he was some corrupting force. Well, Dudley was part of the LMU now, so perhaps he was.
Claire set her jaw and yanked a couple of girls—the ones Harry’d seen in Scrivenshaft’s in the autumn, and trailing Claire ever since—forward. Another trio of students followed them.

After a long time, he earned his reward. The cat came close and began to purr, bumping its squashed face against Jared’s in a powerful sort of way. Jared thought maybe the cat was part lion.
“Never?” Said Clark, sounding genuinely shocked.
“What do you think?” Harry asked. “Can you take a little more, or should I let you down?”
“Doesn’t matter, though,” Draco reminded him, “I’m not a Legilimens.”
“Did the job, didn’t it?” Harry retorted, not fussed. He tilted his head to indicate that Ron and Hermione were on their way over. They drew up chairs.
primary school?"
“Manners, Al,” Harry sighed.
“Bloody hell,” Draco managed to spit out. “Potter, be careful or…”
“Oh, Weasley,” Draco replied, voice low and smooth, his mouth a predatory smirk, “I’m positively counting on it.”
Draco felt the moment Granger-Weasley’s eyes fell on him.
“I’ll defend you from anything, Lily, my love. That I can promise.”
” Came the voices of everyone still standing at the front of the classroom, and a solitary figure in the crowd dropped to the dungeon, unconscious.
“I thought I had, too!” Harry cried out, “I got a postbox in Hogsmeade with explicit instructions that all my post must be routed there! It must be overfull or something!”
“I’ll be back to collect you boys in forty minutes,” Draco determined. “If that isn’t too long to have them underfoot, Weasley?”
“There,” he announced, standing. For a brief moment, Malfoy’s expression was stricken but almost at once, it converted into a show of annoyance.
Bill and Percy had matching crossed arms, and were staring at him expectantly. Mrs. Weasley was crying, maybe harder than Harry himself had been. The Grangers continued to look completely bewildered.
Potter shot Draco a contrite glance, which Draco waved off. “I’ve never sat on a giant squid pouffe before,” he acknowledged. “It will be a novel experience, I’m sure.”
“What was all that about?” Ron asked.
“Will you let us know what you find?” Harry inquired of McGonagall. Her omniscient eyes diverted towards him.
“No regrets, then?” Malfoy murmured.
Clark Tiering stood at the doorway of the classroom, chewing on his lip.
“Okay, well, I sort of fiddled with that spell. Teddy left one of his Magical Theory books here over break and I’ve been studying it. It said that making a new spell was tricky, but changing a known spell wasn’t quite so complex. And before you lecture me, I know we’re not supposed to be doing magic over the holidays but no one ever says anything if it’s in a wizarding home. Jamie summons his broom all the time, and you’ve never said anything.”
Potter seemed caught off guard, again, half unwilling to follow through on this line of questioning.
The words settled heavily in Harry’s stomach. He wasn’t confident he’d chosen the most helpful path, lately. “But then what do you do when you bollocks things up? Ruminate on what you did wrong, or just forgive yourself instantly and refuse to dwell on it? But if you do the latter, how do you keep from doing the same stupid thing all over again?” he urged, feeling suddenly very unworldly.
“I’m delighted to hear it,” Draco replied dryly, and shut the door firmly in their faces. Then, with mounting fascination, he returned to Albus’ notebooks.
, Harry, please!”
too late,” Clark hurried to get in, giving Harry a panicked look that killed him a little.
“Dad!” Jamie shouted. “Everyone’s waiting, come

“You won’t hear me complaining!” Penelope pronounced. “The Board will be elated!”
“Yes, and we’ve got to get in, but I haven’t got a bloody password, fuck.”
Harry had only just gotten Remy down when Lily snuck out of bed, padding into the drawing room with a pout.
“You had no problem with me,” Harry commented, using his thumbs to resolve the tension between Draco’s shoulder blade and spine.
Draco could almost picture Harry, brow furrowed and hand clamped to the back of his neck, not angry but frustrated and concerned. It shouldn’t be such an endearing image.
Clark doesn’t think he can talk just now, so he crowds himself closer to Harry, turning his face into the scratchy jumper and letting Harry rub his back and whisper kind, reassuring things.
“Yeah. I...I think I can do that,” Harry nodded, somehow feeling better having a bit of a plan, even if it was not concrete. “Can I go? I hate being away from Draco right now, it must be awful for him.”
, and it is
Malfoy looked up at him, and Harry eyed that long expanse of neck, wanting to get his teeth into it again.
Oof I was anxious to not mess this one up! Felt like high stakes for some reason.
Draco narrowly managed to keep from wincing. The words were a bitter reminder of how badly Draco was bollocksing things up. He’d not told Harry about the letter that still weighed heavily in his pocket to prevent this very thing: Harry waiting on him hand and foot. That was the problem with Harry. He would do anything anyone asked if he thought it was the decent thing to do, but Draco didn’t want to be just another obligation. No, Draco was independent, he was capable. That was what he offered Harry—competence and company and a little fun in the bedroom. There, Harry indulged Draco’s interests, but in return Draco made Harry’s life easier. That was his role and that was what he would keep doing, because if he stopped being useful…
“I am sure, I’ve been sure, I’m prepped and I’m absolutely fucking gagging for it, Potter, so for Merlin’s sake, please turn off your lovely, considerate brain and turn on your devastating brutish one.”
“When it suits me,” Draco sniffed demurely. He found he liked making Harry laugh, how the other man would shake his head at Draco’s audacity. “But I’ve not connected the dots. What does your hand have to do with that great pink bullfrog?”
Harry grinned. “Got it.”
“I...I can see how that would have been strange for you,” Harry considered.
of sugar. Scor doesn’t get many of sweets at home, and you know how Uncle George is—it’s like he has half of Honeydukes in the back of his shop—well, after we stuffed our faces there, we went to Leaky Cauldron and Professor Malfoy let us each have a butterbeer and I think that just sort of pushed Scor over the edge.”
“Oh, I’m not too sure,” Scorpius replied. “It was in the south of France, somewhere.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, “but I should have run asking Malfoy to DA by the two of you first. It was just an impulse. I worry about...leaving him alone. If he got attacked again, I’d feel responsible.”
“Merlin, so I don’t have any redeeming qualities at all, now?” Jamie growled, the corner of his mouth twitching up.
“Having a good time, are you, love?” Potter asked the baby. “Was hoping you might kip off in the pram.” Potter lifted his gaze. “Sorry, Malfoy,” he began, “We’ve got to be going. If I push Remy’s nap any later, I’ll pay for it for a week. There’s too much excitement around here for him, I think.”
“They’re watching you,” Clark whispered, “Harry, the goblins, there’s got to be half a dozen watching you.”
“Your turn, Potter,” she informed him, “Draco’s a miserable, pathetic drunk and he’s your problem, now. Take good care of our boy.” And with that, she sauntered off to the girls’ dormitory.
“Sorry. I shouldn’t have regurgitated all that up on you.”
“It was lovely, Harry, honest. A bit of noise and fury , you know, absolute chaos, but it’s family, right? And Molly needed the help. She’s getting older after all.”
“Then may I suggest,” Malfoy breathed between scorching kisses, “self-control.”
“Sorry about earlier,” Harry muttered, nuzzling into Draco’s shoulder.  “I get a little gloomy when I’m overtired.”
Draco fished some parchment and a quill out of his satchel, and penned a brief reply.
Harry laughed while Malfoy stabbed his bacon pointedly, “Go!” he insisted, “Go over to the Slytherin table, ask Tiering if he fancies playing Quidditch on your team, and mark the reaction of every single other student within earshot and report back. Now, Potter.”
Clark’s hands are in the pockets of his black trousers but he takes them out to tear off his lumpy sweater because suddenly he’s far too hot. Harry is standing beside Clark, expression pained and awkward and consoling.
“What?” Harry answered, not understanding the request.
“It’s no bother,” Harry attested. “Are you alright now?”
“I see,” the headmistress replied, “and someone stunned her, then, I presume?”
“Is that what it’s like with Malfoy? You both have your own thing?” She asked.
“Malfoy,” he said. It was very nearly a snarl.
“Now who's got too many damn sensibilities?” Harry grumbled, stuffing the soiled silk into his pocket and getting to his feet. He ran a hand through the permanent disaster that was his hair, feeling self-conscious, “Thanks,” he muttered, “I’m sorry about all that.” He gestured vaguely at the floor as if a hand wave and a veiled reference could stand in for a semi-delusional meltdown.
“That would be my assumption,” Draco concurred. “Well, what do you think, are you up for it?”
“Harry’s name makes it shockingly easy to get reservations,” Hermione admitted, “Although I don’t feel particularly great about resorting to that.”
The stag was still stamping and tossing its head beside them, as if looking to shore up anyone who dared a repeat offense.
Harry squinted uselessly at the drink menu. He could read about one line at a time before having to shift the placard up so the next option would fall in the small circle of light given off by the candle.
Malfoy wasn’t just shaking, Harry's booze-soaked brain taking a moment to catch up, Malfoy was
Ron clapped Malfoy on the back with a chuckle, “Good man. Least I know the world hasn’t spun off its axis entirely.”
Draco didn’t want to examine too closely how Potter had already become something of a fixture in his days, even if it was just to share a glance and a nod across a corridor. He likewise ignored the bubbly sensation that was far too akin to yearning and which had only mounted as he had taken advantage of the lovely weather to fly into Hogsmeade.
“Mmhm,” Draco confirmed, but there was a niggling bit of worry sprouting where lazy contentment had been only a moment before. Perhaps he had admitted too much. “Does that…” he started, then licked his lips, and his mouth still tasted like Harry’s come, “does that make you uncomfortable?”
The vowels felt unusual and awkward on Harry’s tongue. “That’s not Latin, is it?” He asked, surprised.
As such, Scorpius had just missed the beginning of class when they arrived at the castle. Harry gave Scorpius’ shoulder a squeeze and shot Father a smile which now seemed very significant where it wouldn’t have before, and hurried away to drop Remy off in the nursery. Father’s eyes watched Harry’s departure for just a moment too long.
“During the war,” Draco started. “I was under the near constant threat of torture or death, which has a way of  stripping one of their agency and clarifying one’s priorities. Frankly, I never want to feel that powerless again. I agree with your assessment: to me, money is security. I like to have it. I like to know I can furnish you and Harry and Jared and my Mum and yours with stability and ease and, yes, frivolous excesses, too. That is important to me. It fulfills me and comforts me. I comprehend entirely how you might view this as selfish. I’ve never claimed to be otherwise. Nevertheless, if something were to happen to me, I couldn’t bear knowing I’d not done everything in my power to provide for you.”
It wasn’t until a few minutes later that he realised Malfoy was shaking.
“Keep going.”

“Send your owl if you need anything,” he instructed, “and we’ll see you in the new year.”
“Mum thinks I hid secrets from her,” Ron admitted. “She thinks I should have told her what was really going on. And I’m afraid she’s right. Did I really botch it, Harry? Should we have done a better job of looking out for you? You sometimes made it sound like your aunt and uncle were more of a nuisance than anything—not saying it was your fault for keeping stuff to yourself, Merlin knows that—I just can’t help but feeling we failed you. You were always so skinny after you'd been with them, but you'd sort of brush us off if we asked too much about it. And you never really talked about what it was like there before we even knew you. I didn't want to pry, but should I have?"
Draco shrugged, “Something like that.”
“I’ll take it under advisement,” Draco replied. He kissed Harry’s head. “Why don’t you shower. I’ll have Kreacher make you up some tea and breakfast. I think he’s a bit pleased we’re here, don’t you? I'm quite sure I heard him
“It was our pleasure, Clark,” Fischel smiled. “You’ll have to come for a week or two this summer. If your mum wouldn’t mind. Or,” he looked a bit uncertainly at Harry, “Harry and, ah, Mr. Malfoy.”
“What?!” Ron demanded. “Didn’t know you were all chummy with Malfoy, is all!”
Crookshanks flicked his tail at the astronomy tower again.
By Friday, the entire student population was buzzing like the day before the Quidditch Cup match. The carnival was coming that night and no one could talk about anything else. The professors ran the gamut from indulgent (Dad) to unrelenting (Professor Malfoy), and all were verging on (or well past) impatient by the end of the school day.
“Yes, but that was
“Merlin,” Harry murmured. “Draco, you’re bloody gorgeous.”
Harry studied his boyfriend’s face. Raised blond eyebrows, that straight, aristocratic nose, those unearthly cheekbones. One side of Draco’s mouth was quirked upwards. If anything, the boy was amused.
“I’ll check in on Hiram,” Harry promised.
“Don’t you need it?” Harry inquired.
“I want to hear war stories!” Lily urged, impatient by the lack of response.
“That’s lovely, thank you,” Harry said and the young woman flushed happily. She ducked her head obligingly and hurried off.
“I’m sure you’ll understand that until this has been sorted, I’ll have to disband practical DA meetings. If you want to continue on a social level, I won’t stop you.”
, so he kept laughing because he was discussing virginity status with Draco fucking Malfoy and he because he was alive and no one was actively trying to kill him and the autumn air was invigorating the evening was all out fun and he felt, well, he felt
“I’m well aware,” Draco answered. “But I am someone who cares for you and wants the best for you. It’s up to you if you want to go along with all that.”
“Alright there?”
“Then keep saying it. Well,” Hermione stretched and surveyed the now orderly drawing room. “That’s a bit better, isn’t it?”
“Only student with more pride than you, Harry, and it’s Draco Malfoy,” Hermione reminded him, handing him a mug of tea as they sat down, "Just give him a little bit of time."
before she could. She frowned when her hand couldn’t breach the protective bubble.
“Yeah,” Harry said, blushing stupidly. “You know. He’s a good-looking bloke. Kind of, I don't know, pretty and flowery and things.”
,” Jamie interrupted from where he crouched, with Scorpius’ limp body slumped against him. James threw Harry and Draco a desperate, meaningful look. “About how his tongue swells up sometimes? And how you have to clamp down on it so he doesn’t choke?”
Harry blushed at being found out. He didn’t know if he just liked the warm solidity of Draco’s hand in his—that they’d faced down all that betrayal business and were still standing—or if he was being more demonstrative for the sake of more dubious onlookers. “Is it too much?” he asked.
“I suppose,” Harry relented. “I just don’t want to hurt him, you know?”
"I'm sorry," he murmured when he did.
“Nice to meet you, Clark,” the witch repeated, “What can I do for you two?”
“Like what?” Asked Ron.
Harry let the curse slide, this time. Jamie’s temper seemed to be somewhat in check, which was a rarity in itself. It gave Harry a touch of pride.
“Well, that’s quite nice,” Harry admired, “Well done, Hops. Will be easy to spot out there. Now, remember, play fair, take risks, enjoy yourselves.”
“I have an idea,” the other boy replied, his breath hot and frantic as it skated over his abdominals. He looked up at Harry and met his eyes for the first time that evening. They were shrouded with something dark, despairing and half frenzied. It unnerved Harry. He didn’t know what to say, so for a moment, he didn’t speak. Draco filled in the silence. “I want you to hurt me, Potter. You’ll like it, I know you will. I’ll be good for you, I’ll take whatever you give me. Just make it hurt, okay? Go as hard as you want. Hurt me, wreck me, ruin me for good.” His busy mouth and hands returned to Harry’s crotch and Harry froze, conflicted. For a guilty moment, he thought about Draco bared before him, tied down and marked with stripes Harry gave him. Draco writhing and crying out and taking every swift blow. His cock jerked and Draco uncovered it, swallowing it hungrily in a single, fevered gesture. Harry dug his fingers into Draco's hair with a groan, then forced the image from his head.
“You’re the only person alive to call me that,” the young man replied with a smile, shaking his head.
“I’m aware. Still, I would have tried. I reckoned that he’d been trying to kill you for sixteen years and he’d failed again and again. If anywhere was safe, it was wherever you were.”
“Professor?” Harry said from the doorway, trying his best to sound abashed.
“Clark alright?”
Harry shot him a smile, “I think someone promised you an owl.”
"Shit," Harry remarked, "That's not what I meant. I meant you still have no problem getting what you want. But that doesn't matter. Fuck, babe. I'm sorry. He's your dad and he shouldn't have said that to you," Harry didn't know exactly how to respond. Being gay was just not something he grew up really considering. Oh, there’d been the occasional slur but that was just a thing people said, not a thing people
The young woman laughed, “Oh that’s just what we call her on account of her being so timid, but always enthusiastic about tea time. Loves her nibbles, this one.”
Draco steepled his fingers, finding this tug between his desire to surrender and his need to maintain composure very tiresome. Potter was flustered again, underneath this burst of determination, though, and that was appealing in its own right.
“So much for our being Aurors together.”
“Want to try that again?”
“Right,” Harry sighed.
“Well, you didn’t tell my secrets so I’m not about to tell yours,” Clark announced.
“I suppose I’ll take this option over watching Malfoy sling hexes at my girlfriend.” Ron agreed, begrudgingly.
“What happened to her?” asked Clark, “Shit, actually, probably don’t answer that.”
He walked down the hallway, trying very hard to not feel like he was plodding along to his own execution. He went past the still vacant frame from where Walburga used to scowl and rage. Memories of Draco scaring her off in the most indomitable way made him bite back a pained smile. Merlin, he loved him, there was nothing else to it.
“If anyone knew what they did...it wouldn’t be a trial I’d get, it would be a full-on parade.”
“Neville?” Harry said, and the other boy jumped.
They took to the dungeons, since Harry felt like he could always get lost in those labyrinthine passages, and maybe getting unlost would distract the both of them from their heartache. So far, it was ineffective.
“Would she have more biscuits, do you think?” Jared asked, weighing the options.
“Hmm,” Harry wondered. “A beet? No, no, I’ve got it, a turnip!”
“I should hope you would give my powers of observation a bit more credit than that. Drink it, Potter. Assuming you don’t have an allergy to any potion components, it should help.”
“And did you give him one?” Zerk asked, still casual, still measured.
“Yes, that.” Harry spat, “It was my dad’s; I want it back.”
Harry’s touch was purposefully too light, too slow. He liked how the pulse along Draco’s temple flared with forced self control.
“What's the matter?” Draco grumbled, stirred awake by the movement.
“I mean, just the war stuff and all that,” Harry muttered, never liking when conversations went this route.
“I don’t know,” Harry replied, honestly. “Like I said, it was...disorienting. I was kind of out of it, like oustide of myself, and I wasn't making sense. It scared my friends. I’d rather not do that to them again, if I can help it.”
James cleared his throat uncomfortably and jerked his chin towards a bend in the corridor. “The washing machine’s just there.”
Ron, my
A couple of days later, Harry found himself in Headmistress Clearwater’s office. The room was refreshed: the large wooden desk was polished and displayed framed photos of the Headmistress smiling with whom Harry assumed to be her family, denoting a life outside work. The portraits of the previous Headmasters and -mistresses which lined the entrance were mysteriously vacant. Fawkes’ perch was gone and the many cluttered tables were, too, replaced with several neat bookcases harbouring not a speck of dust. Despite the changes, the room felt overwhelmingly familiar. Harry imagined the sound of Dumbledore clearing his throat and saying something inscrutable, the creak of that old chair. It made Harry want to turn tail and run to save himself being devoured alive by memories.
Oh, Merlin. Draco wasn’t sure how much Albus and James would have told the girl. “An error in judgment,” he explained briefly.
“Not my place to keep it from you,” Zerk admitted. He was dressed more formally today, and Harry wondered if he’d been called in from home the evening before. He reached into the inner pocket of a dark grey blazer and pulled out the morning’s edition of
“Racist rubbish,” Clark said, “
“I’m sure that would be fine,” Clark told him.
Harry considered, “Look, I could do little things for you, fine, but I get to veto anything weird.”
will bypass the wards to some extent, but only within certain limitations."
Harry sat back, more than happy to let Malfoy take over.
“It might surprise you what the brain remembers,” urged McGonagall, “Why don’t you give it a try?”
“I did,” Draco sighed. “Several times. Harry says we ought to just let her; it makes her happy and she was miserable for so long.”
“Professor,” Harry said, tightening his grip on Malfoy’s hand, “I think something’s wrong with me.”
Harry looked to Draco, who pursed his lips but gave a short nod.
The truth was, Draco had no fucking idea what he was doing.
“Merlin,” he breathed, tossing the letter onto the table top. “He didn’t know about you!?”
Harry nuzzled against Draco’s cheek, kissing him, “Different circumstances, sweetheart, you know that. Besides, it's not like your father made efforts at atonement.”
It didn’t help that as of that morning, less than three weeks into term, Clark was on a two day suspension for throwing a punch at the Atwal boy—McGonagall giving credence to the new anti-violence campaign at Hogwarts—and Harry had been required to fetch the boy from King’s Cross when he came in. Clark was sulky, recalcitrant, and refusing to admit even a whit of remorse, about the punch at least. He did, however, apologise for inconveniencing Harry, which Draco supposed was something. Harry, for his part, went out of his way to reassure Clark that he was never an inconvenience, listen to Clark’s rant about Atwal, and generally bestow his sympathies. Draco had bitten his tongue, but only just. He didn’t think it would hurt for Clark to accept his responsibility in this. But that was Harry for you, decent to a fault.
and neither of those seem like they would work on crumbs,” he admitted. “I took on the dishes and the laundry and the yard, and Gin dealt with the rest.” It felt like an admission of guilt. He’d taken her for granted. He slumped, dropping the cloth back in the sink—he’d deal with the perpetual mess that was the kitchen later. “How is she?” he asked, voice low.
“That’s right,” Harry stated.
“I’d say your best course of action is just to let him. If you just stay pleasant, don’t react, it won’t be any fun for him and he’ll soon give it up,” Hermione advised, returning her attention to Harry.
Waiting in McGonagall’s office were two uniformed, grim-faced aurors. They balked a bit when they saw Harry, who crossed his arms over his chest, leveling them with a dubious look.
“You going to be alright?” Harry asked
“On the contrary, I assure you,” Draco insisted casually. “The truth must out. Your father, in an effort to be gracious, no doubt, omitted my part of the story. I expect he did so because all I was doing was skulking about the castle looking for him.”
“That’s just it, though,” Clark pressed. He was clearly getting exasperated at Draco’s lack of understanding. “How can I fight for the people when I’m not one of them any more? I’ve got this cushy home and magic and loads of money and I’ve everything I could ever dream of wanting, and scads more that I don’t need, besides.”
“Al, Jamie,” he began, turning to his boys. “Do you still have your lists? Can you hunt down what you need, please? We’ve still got Teddy’s and Jamie’s old books, so mind you only get the ones we don’t already have.”
Scorpius’ attention was drawn back towards Harry when the man sighed and folded the bit of paper. Father didn’t look at him, his face seemingly purposefully fixed on the newspaper.
. Ron, Harry, if you want to continue at regular speed for a couple more minutes, just to reinforce the spells, and then we’ll break off into groups to try.”
“This way when you’re getting worked up, you have some easy reassurance. Or else you can come save my arse, as you’re wont to do.”
“If you’re sure,” Harry said, rising up to kiss him.
Professor McGonagall’s mouth thinned and she gave him a thoughtful nod. “I see. Well, let us not panic preemptively. Run and check with Professor Flitwick and let me know what you find out. I assume you’ve checked your map?”
“Yes, alright,” Draco whispered.
"Got it. Look, I didn’t mean to lose it with Nan. I know she means well. I just couldn’t stop thinking this place could house three hundred foster kids, and she wants to turn it into a bloody museum!”
He sounded truly sincere, Harry could hardly believe it.
and even
Harry kissed his forehead, “I wish I could turn it off for you, I really do.”
“You’re looking now to ensure the arches on either side of Clark’s uvula are equal,” lectured the healer, and Harry’s attention drifted off as Professor McGonagall approached him.
“Lavender,” he said slowly. “Would it help if I said I’m sorry?”
They went upstairs and Jared changed into his pyjamas. Then Draco made him brush his teeth and wash his face, proving that Christmas wasn’t, in fact, all that special in the end. Jared was too tired to whinge, though, and soon he was tucked under the covers of the room that was robin’s egg blue and completely his. Clark had chosen nothing but black for the walls of his room. Jared wouldn’t say it, but he didn’t like going in there. He thought something might be lurking out of sight.
Draco’s hand clung tightly to Harry’s. Harry brought it down to his lap, where he could hold it with both of his own. He didn’t suspect the Malfoy family typically had conversations like this.
“No offence!” Lilly hurried to add.
Seamus took the opportunity to hop up on the bench and call out “A mighty fine lad indeed,” laughing and clapping like an insane person.
“Alright,” Harry grumbled reluctantly. “I can see what you mean. I’ll do my best, alright?”
“I’ll deal with it,” Draco heard himself saying. “You’re exhausted. You’ve been exhausted all day. Go to bed. I’ll manage.”
Harry settled himself on the bed behind the struggling boy and dropped a kiss onto the burning skin of Draco’s rear, chasing it with another several to his thighs and arsecheeks, working his way slowly inwards. Draco let out a surprised murmur and clamped his legs shut when he realised Harry’s goal. They’d not done this before.
“I think that’s wise,” Professor Malfoy asserted and the praise made Jamie feel clever as anything. He watched as the knife was then sheathed, and a long, thin, ivory box sailed down from a shelf, in response to a spell. The professor never seemed to have to hunt about for anything, as though every myriad ingredient had a particular place. “Unfortunately, some of these bull thistle seeds have sprouted. Separate those ones out, if you would,” he instructed.
“Why’d you stop?” he asked instead, wishing they could go back to a few minutes earlier, when he was trying to get to that place where his world was nothing but diligence and reassuring blows.
“Right,” Harry said dumbfounded, “Well, well done.”
“I’ve been trying, I’m just not certain they hear me, you know?”
“Alright, Harry,” grunted the figure. From the voice it was almost definitely Dean, Harry decided.
Harry watched the fluid, open movements of the interviewer as he explained the morning’s proceedings and offered them tea. He tossed his mane and grinned and sparkled through it all. His every gesture was mesmerising and Harry started, identifying his feelings as those of attraction. Harry knew he was attracted to people who weren’t Draco. He also knew that was natural and normal and all that, it just startled him when those people were men. It still felt new and if not unsettling, at least a bit surprising. He tightened his arm around Draco and was relieved to feel Draco give his thigh a little comforting squeeze in return.
“Weird,” the girl told him.
Jamie chewed on his lip a while longer, considering. “Well. That might be...alright. Maybe, you know. Could be worse,” he admitted, attempting a casual shrug, his fingers fiddling with his duvet cover, tracing the stripes of the grey and navy plaid. When he looked up, however, his green eyes contained a spark of hope. Harry knew his son. Jamie’s pride might forbid him from outright asking, but Harry could tell beyond a shadow of a doubt that Jamie wanted him to—maybe needed him to—return to Hogwarts.
With a grin, Charlie selected a card. Without missing a beat, the stocky Weasley—who was a few ales in already—let out a earsplitting screech and leaped up onto the table. Everyone was cackling in confused amusement, while Charlie stuck his hands into his armpits and starting flapping his elbows. He was crouched down and wriggling his arse and making the most awful noises. Percy gave them all a filthy look from above the pages of some report he was reading in the living room. Charlie then started grunting and shaking one leg out to the side.
“I think I really have to try to get my heart going fast enough,” Scorpius offered, “and I’ve never gone off just by being startled, before.”
“Alright, darling,” Pansy said, her tone changing completely, as she gave Draco’s cheek a little pat, “Up you get, I’m off to bed.”
-looking cat all the same. He didn’t try to pet it, though, he only waited.
Clark nodded. Draco raised a hand to the boy’s jaw, ran a thumb over his cheek in a gesture so tender Harry thought his chest might crack right open.
“You should,” Malfoy replied, fiercely, hand curling around Harry’s wrist, “Blame me, I mean. Why couldn't I be good like you? You never falter, you always do what’s just and right and noble. It’s second nature to you. All I do is protect my own arse, it’s all I’ve ever done.”
Harry ground his teeth, but let Malfoy lead the way to the courtyard. Harry didn’t remember being terribly meticulous in school, but that was ages ago. Surely he’d had the opportunity for growth over the years?
“You were. You are!” Harry choked out quickly, mortified. “Of course you are! I just wasn’t sure if, er, you were planning on coming.”
Harry suddenly thought about Malfoy on his knees in the shower and he blushed scarlet, not feeling admirable at all, and praying McGonagall didn't have Snape's legilimency skills, "Oh, ah, thanks, Professor." There was an awkward pause, Harry really wished people would stop giving him compliments entirely, "Well, I'll...I'll just be going then. I'll let you know about Malfoy and the, er, lessons."
Al’s lip curled when he saw Jamie. “What do
“Yes, of course,” Harry said. He was relieved enough at the interruption to ignore Jamie’s rudeness. “Out you go. I’ll call when pudding’s ready.”
“We’re going to the alley and apparating home,” Malfoy told him as they descended the stairs, “then I’m taking a nap. After that, I intend on doing nothing but eating, sleeping and shagging for two days solid, understood? There’s a reason I’m in no hurry to have children.”
“Maybe. But it’s...crap. It’s not fair,” Al sniffed.
“Not on purpose!” Harry insisted, “Voldemort just...lived in my head for a long time and I guess I picked up a few of his tricks. I’d never even done it before today, when I tried it on McGonagall.”
“Potter, don’t,” Draco warned. “We can’t.”
Draco scoffed. “Oh, I don’t make a show of shrouding my emotions. If you’ve angered me, you’ll be sure to hear about it.”
“Then I’m happy for you, Harry,” Ginny said, “truly.”
Harry carted him off to the storage room they had snogged in a few weeks earlier. He wasn’t sure he could physically go any further without getting his hands and mouth on the damned git.
“I can’t do this, I can’t hold it, it fucking hurts, my shoulders…”
when we’ve finished.”
“What’re we having for dinner, then?” James demanded.
“What
“Hey,” Harry whispered as he climbed onto Malfoy's bed that evening. He felt exponentially more awkward than he had the night before, now that he was in the after kissing Draco Malfoy times. He cast a quick
“I love you,” he said, simply.
"You do realise you've gone from one night of cuddling to imagining a future with the man," Pansy noted. "You don't think that's a bit much?"
“Hm,” Harry said. He took his time standing, stretching his neck lazily before stalking forward. His approach was slow and deliberate. He cupped Draco’s jaw in his hand and dipped in, grazing his nose along that mesmerizing pulse point. He inhaled the fresh scent of the seaside, and pressed a kiss to the hollow below Draco’s mandible. He felt Draco tense, as though Harry were something dangerous he had to steel himself against. He straightened and next kissed Draco’s mouth sweetly, trying to dispel that notion. He didn’t want fear in this. “I don’t think that’s what you want, love,” he determined, with all the soothing authority he could muster. “I expect you’ve had quite enough dressing downs for one lifetime. I think you would rather atone.” He left the word suspended in the air, his lips returning to Draco’s neck, planting kisses like seeds in every nook and hollow.
“Clark, love, is that you?” The voice was familiar as Harry had heard it many times in the boy’s memories.
“Malfoy, can I ask—”
“Liar,” Albus said, his eyes narrowed.
The door to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes let out a sound like a slide whistle upon opening. Back-to-school shopping was not yet in full force, so although there was a score or so children sifting through boxes of Insta-Slug and Welding-Gum (“Gum up your friends’ jaws!”), the redheaded clerk was unoccupied.
“I—I fuck,” Harry gasped, grinding his knuckles into his sternum, “I don’t know, I’m sorry, I just. I’m sorry. I need to sit down.”
Draco shrugged. “It’s...something I do. Penance maybe.”
Draco only hoped Harry would be around when it did.
Hermione’s fingers flicked upwards in an ‘alright, alright’ sort of gesture, “Well, whatever your sexuality, I don’t think they will bar you from quidditch. Pretty sure that goes against several pieces of legislature. And they would have to know about you in the first place.”
“That’s very generous, Mr. Potter, but I’m afraid families must be thoroughly screened—”
I have a big ethics application due for school this week, so unfortunately I likely won't be able to keep my chapter-a-day pace for a little while. I will try really hard for every second day, just wanting to give you a heads up! I will not abandon this story!
Harry and Hermione looked at each other, then fled towards the commotion.
“No sign, then?” Harry asked.
She looked up, around the oval of solemn-faced students. She folded her hands, one over the other, her knuckles knobbly with arthritis that didn’t suit her age, “I was brought here to address what academics call mass trauma and what I call deep hurt, grief, and the aching tatters of stolen childhoods.  It pains me that cannot complete my assignment, for the first tenet of healing is safety, and that is not something I can offer you. I had hoped it was, but something is at play here that is asking you to prolong your endurance, your resiliency, to stand together and protect each other for just a little longer.
Malfoy didn’t answer, just waited, fixated with Harry’s words.
Draco nodded and Harry transferred the child between them.
Potter gave a hollow laugh.
Scorpius thought, who was
somehow and far too easily toppled by Draco’s recalcitrance.
"Oh, come off it, Harry," Hermione hissed, mortified, "We're not children. The truth is, Headmistress, Harry's got this map, it was his dad's actually—"
“Whoa,” Clark said, “That’s some jedi shit.”  He sighed, “Look, I know it probably seems like she’s a bad mum,” Clark attempted to explain, pulling away from Harry and wiping his nose with the back of his hand, “but she does love us, I know she does. She just...loses reality sometimes. She doesn’t mean to. Some things mess her up. Especially like changes in routine. Me coming home probably set her off.”
Weasley shot to his feet, his face burning in righteous anger. “Merlin help me, Malfoy, you’re a dead man—”
“Well, that’s a relief. I hate to see a child suffer. Remy was a bit fussy, but I think he’s gone down for the night. Lily was her usual self, full of vim and vigor! Never a dull moment with that girl!”
Draco cowered in close, his forehead leaning into Harry’s thigh, pressing small kisses to his quad before looking back up at him.
Draco pulled his wand from his sleeve and issued a
Harry sighed. He’d thought maybe he could get away with not telling Malfoy about the incident with the sheet. He’d not wanted to cause him any undue stress, but now he realised that made him look like a bit of a patronizing arse.
being dramatic!” protested Draco sharply, “I’m a Death Eater, I hurt people. I let people get hurt,” his tone darkened, bitter with repugnance, “I’m a spineless, gutless coward.” He paused, taking an unsteady breath, “I still see them when I sleep sometimes, did you know? Their bloated faces, their dead bulging eyes, blaming me. Muggles, half-bloods, muggle-borns, Professor Dumbledore. Judging me, tormenting me. They died in horrible pain and I let them. What’s wrong with me? Merlin, I—I deserve it, I deserve to be haunted, to never forget what I did.”
. I understand that many of you know these spells already, out of necessity. I encourage you to continue with your extracurricular approach. For my part, I will attempt to supplement your knowledge with some more esoteric spells:
There was another long silence. Harry traced the curve of Draco’s ear, then the bone behind it and the muscle behind that. Draco liked when Harry did that, and Harry liked knowing it.
"Sorry, Tiering," Draco pronounced, "you're just going to have to put up with us for a little while longer."
He used his wand to illuminate a few ensconced torches in the hallways and led Draco and Clark down the dingy hall to the kitchen.
Potter stood and squeezed Scorpius’ shoulder affectionately. Draco waited for the customary flare of protectiveness that he typically got when other adults were interacting with his child, but it didn’t come. Even his damn subconscious seemed to trust the man.
“What is it?” he said.
“No, we’re alright,” Harry said, “We don’t mind waiting until she gets home. You friendly with your neighbours at all, could you ask them if they’ve seen her? Or does your mum have a mobile?”
“I should hope so.”
“Yes, go on, Fortitude, explain it,” Ri prompted snidely, crossing his arms and raising his sandy blond eyebrows. “Dazzle us with your expertise on technical arcane theory.”
“Oh, I don’t know, twenty minutes ago or so. She wanted me to start a fire. In my own loo, can you believe it? Selfish girl, I told her what for.”
“You’re going to give something up,” Harry informed him, “you won’t be getting off tonight. I think that’s a fitting sacrifice, don’t you?”
“I don’t like when you’re upset,” Harry tried to explain.
It was methodical and dull and inexplicably soothing and soon Clark found himself dozing off and on against the headboard.
Malfoy considered him. “Not really, no,” he replied carefully. “I’ve mostly been preparing for the start of term.” He paused as if deliberating quickly with himself. “And I saw Pansy.”
“It’s alright,” Harry offered. Draco’s hands were trembling where they touched and it must have given him away.
“Well, if you ask him to be part of your team, he’s hardly going to turn you down, now, is he?” Draco had said when Harry had mentioned his disappointment.
“It must be hard,” Harry began hesitantly, “to feel that a friendship that important to you is being threatened.”
This response did nothing to soothe Scorpius’ worries, from the furrow of the boy’s brow. “What were you arguing about?”
Draco didn’t answer. He didn’t want Harry to do anything simply because he felt obliged to. “Nevermind. I’ll be fine. You needn’t smother me so.”
Harry rose and took the duffel that Ron held out, hugging him and then Hermione.
The afternoon was not a pleasant one. It was spent sorting through mail and what felt like an endless stream of howlers. Clark was barred entry to the sitting room because Harry didn’t want some terrible curse to explode out of an envelope and injure him.
“Any time. Unless I’m busy. And then I’ll let you know.”
“She probably just wanted to get you alone before giving you more instructions.”
“Pretty rich from the girl who, as I recall, punched him in the face,” Ron commented, looking at her adoringly.
"You couldn’t have just asked me if I wanted to spend some time with you or something?" He sighed.
Slowly, still shaking, Malfoy obeyed. His eyes were red-rimmed, face tear-streaked, pink blotches blooming over pale skin. Harry cupped a hand over his face. This might be a bad idea, he didn’t know. His inhibitions were down and he just...he just wanted Draco to know.
“Fine. Night, Dad. Night, Professor.”
“We went through a cubby together,” Draco supplied, nodding to the corner where a few square shelves sat stuffed with toys and baby things. Most were gifts, Harry assumed. Merlin, the baby shower felt like a lifetime ago, but he could still picture the scene: Ginny, pale but smiling, one hand on her belly, soldiering through the event, laughing, and pretending everything was normal. Had she known then, Harry wondered, that this life was not the one she wanted? Had she told him as much in her own way? Why hadn’t Harry seen it?
you have to write down what you’re hoping to forget first. Then you can prove it worked. And it helps if you also include any preceding or proceeding events that are linked to it, so you don’t have any clues.” Albus shoved one of the notebooks at him and dug out a quill and a vial of ink from his satchel. “Here.”
“Well, what did you talk about, then?” Draco demanded, returning his book to his bag and slinging it over his shoulder. He cast disillusionment spells on them both before they left the quiet alcove.
“Might be a bit of an overstatement,” Harry pointed out. “It’s mostly Al, you know how he is. Conniving little blighter. Though it’s not just him, Malfoy seems in on it, too. Like he enjoys trying to get a rise out of me.”
Draco extended a graceful hand for a cup, which Harry dutifully passed him. Draco sipped the tea suspiciously.
“So, we need to look into Legilimency on non-human creatures and summoning spectres, is that correct?” Malfoy said, sitting back and allowing his words to take on a more businesslike quality. Hermione was jotting down ideas on a slip of parchment.
“Thanks, love. What do you think about Dudley’s invitation?”
Draco was reading by the light of his wand and he didn’t look up when Harry entered the canopy. Harry leaned up against the headboard beside him, forearms resting on his knees.
Usually when the need to be hurt got too distracting, Draco would seek someone out. There were places he knew he could go, to find men with needs counterpart to his own. No matter how brutal the partner, though, Draco found himself with too much control. He was more clever, more fastidious, always certain to never be truly trapped. Those precisely calculated experiences were so unlike the interlude today, which left him choking in Potter’s drawing room, a singing terror streaking through his veins. The violence and the powerlessness had served as an aphrodisiac. And he’d let Potter know.
Draco coloured.
“To see if I react to it?” Scorpius ventured.
, behind. On the other hand, this just confirms my fears: they didn’t accept me before not because of my capabilities but because of bloody gossip and I honestly don’t know if I want to play for a team like that.”
The three headed towards the doorway to wend their way up to the main part of the castle.
at his son, and Scorpius fell like dead weight, Jamie scrambling to catch him from his awkward position behind the smaller boy.
The memorial was about as intolerable and oppressive as Harry anticipated. The great hall was draped with light cream coloured banners and there were fresh white candles bobbing above the heads of the guests. Hagrid had replaced the Halloween decorations with large bouquets of autumnal foliage, and the dining tables had been replaced with various chairs. Portraits of the fallen surveyed the crowd from alcoves. Harry tried very hard not to look. He couldn’t quite bear to see Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, or Fred just now. Or Dumbledore or Dobby or little Colin Creevey or Lavender Brown or any of the rest. He wasn’t sure if this memorial was providing further closure or just freshening the wounds he had been trying so desperately to close.
3:17 am was probably too late for sex. It might be safe.
“I know, sweetheart. It was very decent of you to try and protect your friend,” Harry told him. “But in future, can you please make an effort to talk to me before you make big mind-altering decisions? For yourself or anyone else?”
“Your wife. You're, er, separated? I mean, is it...” Potter trailed off, looking uncertain.
“Well, sometimes her decisions really suck.”
“Yeah,” Hermione agreed. “Sweet and poignant and—”
“I’ll talk to you then. Happy Christmas, darling.”
Madam Malkin examined Harry, who tried to give her his best 'we’re all friends here!' smile.
continued to crank out bizarre headlines:
Then again, maybe that wasn't the sort of things fathers discussed with their sons. Scorpius tried to remember if his father had ever alluded to being interested in men, and came up short. Then again, he’d never heard his dad so much as mention being interested in women, either. It had been as though relationships—even the one with his own wife—played no role to speak of in his personal life. Scorpius wondered if that had been for his own benefit, or if his father had been too preoccupied with his career and his research to make time for such a thing as...
Harry sighed as he parked the pram outside Flourish and Blotts, scooped up Remy, and made his way through the gaggle of rubbernecked shoppers.
When he spoke, Weasley’s words were a hiss of incensed tension: “When I figure out how you’re pulling this off, tormenting Harry like this, whether it’s a potion or spell or just your particular brand of manipulation, you’re over, Malfoy. You’ll have to take your boy and leave the continent, if you’re not locked up by then, that is.”
There was a tug at Draco's eyebrow and Harry knew there would be a conversation about that confession sooner or later, but he couldn't attend to it because Ron was still there, fuming, his large hands balling up into fists at his sides.
“Well, I guess we’ll just see how it plays out,” Harry shrugged.
Harry cringed. “That sounds so fucking creepy.”
“Oh?” Brocklehurst said politely.
“Oh, for hell’s sake, Potter—” Draco sighed with frustration.
CWs: canon-typical ableist slurs, past child neglect, traumatic memories, anaphylactic episode.
Jamie was more astonished than affronted. This was not a side of Scorpius he had seen before. “You’re rather feisty when you’re angry,” he observed.
“Am I to assume it is me you are attempting to protect?” Harry interrupted, coldly.
Harry bristled. “It’s not a puzzle to us,” he pointed out, “It’s our lives. It’s Draco’s safety.”
“What am I still learning?” Draco insisted, appalled.
With a final squeeze, a polite nod to Malfoy, and some well-wishes for Scorpius, Molly stepped into the Floo.
Thanks so much for the very generous comments, y'all are spoiling me and I adore it.
Harry scuffed a shoe against the ground. He watched the poppies blowing in an imaginary wind in the painting mounted behind Zerk’s head. “It’s just what I’ve known. I thought I was a freak as a child because I kept doing magic in a world where magic didn’t exist, and then I came to school and I was Harry Potter and everyone knew me and I didn’t understand why, not really. I didn’t know what it meant to defeat Voldemort until he came back.”
CW: anxiety/PTSD-type feelings, descriptions of past violence, grief.
“Er,” he said, taking it off and handing it to her, “It’s a little magic.”
Harry only gave a contented little sound and nuzzled against him, clearly not partaking in Draco's karmic anxieties. "Good," he murmured happily.
Karanjeet gaped at Draco and Harry. “Aren’t you going to
“His divorce? Yes. It was kept rather hush-hush, but…”
“S’alright,” Clark replied, “I've only got enough money for the tube and I can get there on my own.”
“Hm,” Al answered. He looked as if he were about to say more, then spotted Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. “C’mon, Scor! Let’s—”
Harry took a stabilizing breath and pressed back into Draco’s touch. “Yes, alright, you’re right. He’ll be fine.”
hadn't settled on their judgment of him one way or the other. Then again, maybe that was just him trying to salvage his own ego.
Merlin, the summer seemed to pass more quickly with every year. “Indeed.”
Clark was on the verge of laughing now, ruining the moment, or perhaps salvaging it, Draco didn’t know.
Jamie shrugged, embarrassed. He still felt weird about his dad being the DADA professor. He’d been ready for an onslaught of ribbing at the hands of his housemates, but from the first day, all anyone had seemed was impressed. Jamie was taken aback by the thunderous standing ovation that had erupted upon his dad’s introduction as a faculty member. And, admittedly, the obstacle course had been pretty neat, all done out on the Quidditch pitch, testing their skills from the term prior in rapid succession. It definitely beat Professor Stump’s dry, theory-heavy lectures from third year.
Harry examined Malfoy’s face, wishing he could kiss him. Merlin, all this would be so much easier if Harry wasn’t Harry and Malfoy wasn’t Malfoy. If they could just live their lives below the radar. But if they were ever going to make this public, it was going to be a whole
from his satchel.
“Being gay!” Harry hissed.
“Yeah,” Draco promised.
“No,” Harry agreed, pulling her in for a brief, fierce hug. “It’s not right, but we’ll deal with it. You’re dealing with it.” He stepped back, letting his hands squeeze her shoulders.
Detention was just a way of life for Albus. He wasn’t good at listening because he always had something more interesting on his mind, so he was used to spending at least a few evenings a month with one professor or another. Tonight’s detention had been easy, chatting with Uncle Neville as they replanted the Gremlin Pods. Al had been let go early (he nearly always was with Uncle Neville), and he’d rushed back to the Slytherin common room, but Scor was nowhere to be found.
“Since when do you and Scor study together?”
Draco looked at his pocket watch, “Ten minutes.”
“I rather think I did,” Draco said. “I’ll not have you fall back into the silent martyr routine, it doesn’t do anyone any good.”
Harry looked at his watch. Draco’s little golden hand was pointing to
“How about I watch Remy, and you go have a shower and a nap?” Teddy offered instead. “You look like hell, and you smell worse. I can visit with Jamie and hold a baby at the same time.”
“I think continuing to preach interhouse unity is still a valid strategy. Mr. Malfoy, I appreciate your attempts in this direction, also.”
“Darling, consider what you're asking,” Draco entreated softly. “I’m not a Muggle. I know very few Muggles. I don’t understand Muggle culture. I believe you when you say things ought to change, but it would not be right to insert myself into a situation I do not understand. That’s too akin to all your goings-on about colonial history, isn’t it? I cannot presume to know how Muggles ought to rule themselves or run their societies.”
“Obviously,” Draco acknowledged, “How do you forebear?”
“Shit,” Harry said guiltily. “I forgot to mention that, didn’t I?”
“No,” Harry agreed, relieved and smilling, “you’re definitely not that. Come here.” He drew Malfoy in kissing him soundly, “You’re fucking unbelievable.”
“I’m sure you do. I said hold it.” He climbed back on the bed, on Draco’s other side this time.
“I don’t want his apology,” Jamie seethed. “I don’t need the apologies of pitiful little snakes who poison the only friends they have!”
“Headmistress Clearwater has extended me an offer. To teach. It would mean Lily and Remy and I moving to Hogsmeade, and Merlin knows you and Al would grow sick of me being there all the time, having to endure me as your professor, and waiting for me to inevitably slip up and call you sweetheart in front of your friends. But you’d see me every day, could come visit Lily and the baby on Hogsmeade’s weekends and holidays, and I could come to your games. It would be a big change and it’s not on your shoulders to decide, of course; we’d need to talk about it as a family, but it’s an option, something we can discuss…if that would make things better? Or maybe not, I don’t know—”
That, at least, caused Draco to crack a small smile, and Harry kissed him, lips working slowly against his, as salve to an aching muscle.
“It is a matter of autonomy, Harry,” Hermione had chipped in, kindly.
“Yes, but you shouldn’t have to,” countered Draco.
at the tie clip still sitting benignly on the bathroom floor.
“What makes you think that something terrible will happen?” Draco asked thoughtfully.
Draco gave a long suffering sigh. “I suppose I’ll make do with a chit for new furniture for the house.”
“Well, Dudley really cares about what you think, doesn’t he? I didn’t want you to think I wasn’t good enough for him.”
“Why don’t you then?”
Harry pulled the other boy in for a kiss, and Draco came willingly. Harry savoured the warm press of their mouths, Draco’s arms snaking down to rest on Harry’s hips, the way their bodies slotted against each other so comfortingly.
"See that you do!" Lily ordered. She crossed out something on her parchment and stormed out of the room. If Scorpius ever did end up part of the Potter family, he felt certain he would
“Most of it just sounds like Lucius’ typical horseshit,” he said quietly, “I knew Draco was receiving letters from him, and I think the one about Valentine’s just arrived yesterday morning. I saw him pocket it at breakfast. The only thing that seems at all suspect is the bit about the injury in September. I saw his knee. It was wrecked. He couldn’t have faked it; I know Madam Pomfrey would not have been fooled. But he wouldn’t name names, either. I never did figure out who was responsible.”
“Did I handle that poorly?” Harry mused aloud, “I don’t see how else I was supposed to react, but she seemed awfully upset with me.”
“More watchful waiting,” Hermione concluded, “certainly not ideal.”
"I am, you know," Harry urged. "I know you're mostly joking, but I would never—"
“Well, good luck, Harry,” Hermione yawned, finishing her tea and standing up to head up to bed, “Please do try not to lose your temper.”
“Wait, are you still here?” Lily asked again.
Hermione arrived then, looking a bit harried, but cheerful. She squeezed in next to Pansy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Please?” Harry prompted.
“I’m not thrilled about it, and I’m certain I don’t know what you see in him, other than looks, I'll give you that,” she admitted, “but Hermione gave me the spiel, and Merlin knows that girl can spiel. I’ve seen you four together, and no one ever looks upset. And he did save those kids. If you and Ron and Hermione are willing to trust him, I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt. Plus, I’m not sure you’d be bearing up as well as you have been without him. You’ve every right to drown yourself in Ogden’s Finest and sleep for a year, you know.”
Not unlike Malfoy, his erection really didn’t seem interested in Harry’s opinion.
Harry poured himself some tea. He wrapped his hands around the ugly mauve mug, feeling familiar curves of the glazed lumps under his palms. The ever present shame roiled behind his ribs.
Afterwards, they settled, Harry on his back, Draco draped over him. His chin rested on his folded hands which in turn were stacked on Harry’s chest.
Pansy snorted sarcastically, “Oh yes, between the two of you, Harry is the dramatic one. Nice try, darling.”
!” A high, childlike voice pierced the air, coming somewhere from the crowd. Harry’s heart shot to his mouth and he turned to see the curse hurtling for Malfoy beside him. Harry, still wandless, bodily shoved Malfoy sideways, allowing the curse to strike his own shoulder instead. He felt the crackling of his neurons where it hit, hyperstimulating the nerves that were soon alight with pain. Harry felt his knees give way and he went down with a sharp cry.
“Eurgh!” Harry said, shoving it back to Hermione. Graciously, she read the article to herself first.
Harry grinned, coming down to touch ground only to bound forward again, feeling powerful as the bright autumn air filled his lungs, ruffled his hair.
Auror Andrews grew suddenly ruddier and puffed up her chest. “It is our duty to protect, I’ll remind you, Mr. Malfoy.”
Thanks to everyone for your patience and kindness. ♥️ ♥️ ♥️. As I get closer to the end (I mean who am I kidding I still have a while to go, but still) everything feels like much higher stakes and I don't want to disappoint anyone, so I am feeling a wee bit anxious about posting new chapters 😅. But I guess it also means folks are invested and that means SO MUCH to me, too. So. Onward!
“So,” Kingsley said, finally, “Harry. I understand you are wanting to take on guardianship of Clark here until we are able to track down his mother?”
He’d barely gotten the words out when the scene shimmered and they were back beside his mother, the baby’s crying intensity as Clark shook his mother.
“Don’t worry, Hermione,” Harry told her, not liking to see his friend bothered and wishing he could share the lovely bloom of serenity in his chest, “Everything will work out.”
“What did you do once everyone knew there was a war on?” Jamie directed the question at Harry. “Teddy said you and Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron had to go away for a while, that you had a secret mission.”
. Worse still, Al knew he had a right to be. It was hard to explain, the burst of hot rage Al got every time he even thought about Jamie talking with Scor. Al was aware his reaction wasn’t necessarily okay. He even believed Jamie’s intentions weren’t terrible, it was just...well, Al had found Scor first. Scor was therefore by rights, his.
“You smell fine,” he informed him, his arm automatically circling Draco’s waist. He felt Draco grip his hand in his own. “I’m sorry I left you alone to stew for so long. I had to sort things out for myself, a bit. But then I was just turning everything into a catastrophe when it isn’t, so it was a counterproductive reaction.”
and the corresponding
“That’s not fair!” Ron seethed.
As Harry struggled to find what he wanted to say next, the thoughtlessness of his question weighed on him. Jamie was still a boy. Harry should have brought this to Ron and Hermione, not his son. What if it didn’t work out? What if he got Jamie’s hopes up only to dash them? Maybe the position had been extended to someone else by now, or maybe Harry’s hesitations were warranted. What if all the wartime memories and the lancing guilt  really were more than he could bear and his first day in the castle left him overcome? Harry tossed the anxiety aside. If Jamie wanted him there, he would be there, full stop.
He saw the moment the penny dropped for Ginny, her calculated expression going from confusion to understanding. She seemed to be warring between anger and hurt, but she thankfully didn’t say anything.
Malfoy looked first at the hand encircling his arm, and then at Harry.
“Your last challenge is upon you,” Shanna’s voice broke through his thoughts, “capture the snitch.”
Harry stirred as Draco wound himself around the other boy’s body.
Scorpius was a little less enthused. The idea of all those hexes zipping around made him nervous. He tried to shake the sensation off. The Ravenclaw second-years might be diligent, but they were always fair, and surely Professor Potter would put an end to any spells that managed to land. Besides, it was important to Scorpius that he succeed in all his studies, especially Defence. He wanted to be ready if anyone ever came for him again. He shuddered in the warm air, trying to force back the memories of strong hands clamping onto him in the disorienting darkness. If Father hadn’t heard him—
“What you lot can't seem to conceive  about me is that I’m not an especially good person,” Draco explained. “But  trust that I won’t push things so far as to compromise what I have with Harry. You might not always respect my motivations, or even my actions, but at least believe me on that.”
“Yeah,” Harry chewed on the thought. He’d never have identified those as qualities important to Draco, but it did sort of fit, “I guess that makes sense.”
“Yes, alright,” Harry agreed. He shifted Remy, who was mouthing curiously on a spoon, to his other knee. Harry didn’t know how to begin.
“Take your fucking clothes off,” he pouted.
it had said. Harry didn't know, maybe it was.
The auror grimaced. “I’m Auror Travis Hewstone and this is my partner, Drusilla Andrews.” The other auror, a short woman with ruddy cheeks and spots gave them a nod. “We’ve been asked to meet with you to discuss certain allegations regarding the misuse of potions and/or mind-control magics.”
Malfoy finished his glass of sparkling water. (Honestly, who ordered sparkling water at a pub?) And set it on the table.
He waited until they were all alone until he spoke.
“I’m sorry.” Ginny said, she was surveying his face, hands resting comfortably on her stomach. Draco shrugged, not really wanting to talk about this anymore.
“Merlin, I think that’s Potter.” Theo said darkly. Draco nearly passed out.
“Damn.” Weasley muttered, he hurriedly stuffed the thing back in his trunk and motioned for Granger and Potter to follow him. Draco couldn’t breath as he watched Potter. Look this way. He silently willed. Notice me please. Potter turned his head and his eyes met Draco for the briefest of moments before he turned his head away abruptly. A flush was creeping up Potter’s neck and Draco felt his cheeks begin to heat. They were gone and Draco groaned, flopping back against his seat. Luna was sitting very straight, her eyes bright and smiling.
Beside him Harry was shaking his head frantically,
“What...I don’t understand. I need to get out of here.” Abruptly he sprung off the couch and practically ran out the door. Draco made to follow him but the door already slammed shut, nearly hitting Draco in the face. His head was reeling, what did that mean? Fuck. He should’ve told Harry before they got so far. Maybe if he had told him...what? He wouldn’t have been pissed? Of course he would have. Draco was a death eater for Merlin’s sake.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but then closed it. What his father didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him.
Dear Potter,
Draco found out what it meant to love life. He had friends, a mother who adored him, a husband he loved fiercely, and a job he didn’t dread going to every single morning. And although some nights he woke in a cold sweat, remembering all the horrors he had seen over the years, Harry was always there. Pressing a kiss to the side of his temple, usually half asleep but there nonetheless. Their life together wasn’t perfect by any means. They argued, occasionally went to bed angry, and other things that are no doubt bound to happen. But none of that mattered. Not really. The two of them were wonderfully, and blissfully happy. Draco couldn’t ask for anything more in life.
“I don’t know…” He didn’t want Potter to hate him more than he already did. Surely the song could only make things between them worse. But honestly how could things between them get any worse?
Sincerely,
“I wanted to talk.” Potter said, rubbing a hand on the back of his neck.
“See you Draco.”
Draco let out a small, muffled sound. Harry must’ve read all of them by the looks of it.
“No one’s following us, I was watching.” Hermoine said softly, giving him a sad smile. He nodded, finding his throat was too thick to speak without his voice breaking. He wasn’t sure why the rush of emotion had suddenly hit him. Perhaps it was because he had had more than a few fantasies about him and Harry walking into a Muggle cafe while holding hands. The idea of it had seemed terribly romantic at the time. Not so much now when Harry didn’t remember their history together. Draco had made sure to thoroughly erase all traces of him.
“How did you…” She stopped as well, her head tilted and eyes questioning. He shook his head. He wasn’t sure he should tell her about what he had done to Harry. Although she most definitely would’ve agreed it was for the best.
“Not your fault, but thanks.” Draco replied, staring at his shoes.
Dear Harry,
Your worst enemy
Draco needed to stop writing these letters. What if someone found them? Merlin, what if his father found them? He could only imagine the punishment he would get if his father even glimpsed the things he was saying. Yet he could not bring himself to throw them away. They were letters to his enemy. The person he loathed most in the world. He should be able to burn them without a second thought. It should bring him pleasure to watch every written word crumble to ashes. It didn’t. And that worried him a great deal.
“How-nevermind. I don’t want to know.” Both of them sat in awkward silence for a few moments.
“What are you playing at Malfoy?” Weasley asked angrily.
“I found them.” Tonks said, arms crossed.
Hey guys! I did not edit this chapter so...But I wanted to get this out before I go on vacation. Hopefully I will get a chance to update while I'm away but if not the next chapter will come out in around 3 weeks. But hopefully less. Anyway I hope you like this chapter because I had way to much fun writing it.
“I’m sorry.” Theo said.
“Do you know what would happen if the dark lord found out about this?” Severus gestured between the two of them. Draco felt a twinge of annoyance at those words. Of course he knew. He wasn’t a child. He wasn’t stupid. He was a death eater for Merlin’s sake. He knew the consequences one's actions had in regards to the dark lord.
Dear Potter,
“Give it back,” he said angrily.
“Hey, do you think it’s safe to get takeaway for dinner?” Ginny came into the room holding a small folded paper. “This Indian place looks really good and-” She stopped short, raising her eyebrows. “What were you guys doing?”
Harry shook his head and smiled. “Morning.” he repeated. His mouth began to turn down at the corners and he grabbed Draco’s arm. The one with the mark. The sleeve had ridden up, exposing the dark mark.
“I’ll just check on Scorpius,” Malfoy said after Harry had waved him off, refusing to let the man do more work than he already had.
“There, baby, that’s all. You did it. No more positions, you’re finished. So beautiful how you did that all for me. So brave and generous.” He kissed Draco’s neck and ran a loving hand along the swell of Draco's tremulous shoulder. Harry felt his own cock, viciously hard by this point, pulsating needily alongside Draco’s arse.
"My bet is he'll fuss about it but secretly be pleased."
“No!” Clark objected, too fast and fierce to be anything but an outright lie.

“And did it sound like she was coming from somewhere in the room?”
Draco drew back the ratty old curtain so Walburga was in full view.
’ Harry thought, but he had no options beyond courtesy. He leaped up from his seat and stepped in to shake Draco’s hand and clap him on the shoulder. Draco’s lip curled in response at the downright
“Sounds ideal, yes,” Ri agreed.
Ron grimaced as if remembering his awkward first relationship. “She must have convinced her mum to do her dirty work when she couldn't find a vessel among the students,” he added thoughtfully. “So, how do we kill a cwalus?”
“Yes, thank Merlin for Neville. And if you’re asking that, I trust you’ve heard the other rumours. The ones about me.”
“Beg your pardon?” Draco asked, not following.
“What, what is it?”
“No maternal nurturing from you, I take it,” he noted dryly.
“How is your mother doing, dear?” Molly asked as she served small portions of soup and salad to precede the meal.
“A break would be a great help, yeah,” Harry admitted. “I’m thinking I might have to look for more work, and the bills are stacking up simply because I’ve not addressed them. A few days to myself would be a gift, Molly, truly.” He felt another raucous smack of guilt. He wanted to take care of things, yes, but he also wanted time to see Malfoy. Harry felt his wedding ring suddenly heavy on his finger. He’d not even thought to take it off. He’d been trying to convince himself that the separation was only temporary, at least until he’d seen his account statement at Gringotts. Now, he didn’t know what was the best path. He wanted Ginny to be in their children’s life, of course he did, but whether she’d still have a place in his, well, he no longer could say with any certainty.
Ron sniggered but Hermione was not amused.
“Well?” Albus demanded, almost as soon as the words had left Draco’s mouth. “What did you have for breakfast, then?”
“Hullo, Fred,” James called out, echoed by Albus. “Have you met Al’s mate Scorpius? He’s Professor Malfoy’s kid.”
Thanks so much to everyone who has read and commented. I am really excited to be working on a new story and am so glad you all are here!!!
Instead of opening them, Draco screwed his eyes closed harder, features twisting as if afflicted. Then, giving into some emotion Harry couldn’t understand, they relaxed. His eyelids fluttered open and his gaze met Harry’s, nervous but steady.
"Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it," is a quote from Einstein.
“You think it’s wise to be doing this in full view of the fireplace?” Malfoy queried. “Anyone could show up.”
Harry didn’t bask. He stuck around long enough to be appreciative, but it wasn’t very late when he tugged on Malfoy’s sleeve, tilting his head subtly towards the dorms. Draco gave him a nod and the two slunk off.
“Please,” Malfoy rasped.
“I can’t...promise anything. I’ve no idea if I’ll be good for him or if us working together will end in utter disaster, but I don't wish him any ill. No matter what happens, I wouldn’t wish that. He’s been through enough, and so have the kids. I know that.” He let out a tense breath, feeling suddenly laid bare. “Merlin, Granger, did you put Veritaserum in this tea?”
Harry sighed and collapsed his head into his hands. Draco shifted closer, his palm warm and soothing as he stroked a path along Harry’s spine.
Shortly afterwards, Granger reappeared. Well, Granger-Weasley, he supposed, but that was a mouthful he didn’t have the capacity for just now, not with the incessant drumming in his head. Floating jauntily before her were two more plates of pudding, along with a teapot, a sugar pot, a little pitcher of cream, and two mugs, some cutlery and a makeshift cold compress. The whole array plopped down on the dining room table. Hermione waved the rest of the dinner dishes away with the air of a woman who didn’t have time or patience for household chores.
“Of course. And what were you doing under there?” Mum asked.
The social services witch who greeted Harry and Clark after an hour of waiting was a petite, wispy-haired middle-aged woman with tortoiseshell glasses that hung on a chain around her neck. She waved them into a little office that was piled high with parchment stuffed into folders. There were two wooden chairs across from a desk, well, more a table, really, that had at least seven or eight mugs half full of cooled or cooling tea.
To his surprise, Malfoy only chuckled. “Nice try, Harry. As much as I love being on my knees for you—we're not going there when you're angry. So why don’t you tell me what’s bothering you, and after that, we'll see, hm?”
“No,” Harry said, firmly, even though, if he were being honest, passing out right now didn’t feel like a terrible plan. But the earnestness of Malfoy’s misery had struck him and he didn't want to just ignore it, “Tell me what got you so upset, I would like to know.”
“Leave it, Potter,” Draco retorted—his words were cut short with a groan as Madam Pomfrey pressed on his abdomen.
Ron snorted. “Would be hard to get into as many scrapes as we did. Merlin, I hate to think of it, sometimes. I just pray that things at Hogwarts have calmed down since we were kids.”
Draco reappears with a tea tray.
Harry just nodded in return and then proceeded to almost bite his tongue in two, because at that moment, Malfoy had decided to wrap his hand, and lips, around Harry’s cock.
“What?” James stopped rifling through the racks of robes and looked up at Draco.
Harry thought about it. It wasn’t like he had a quidditch career to jump into, but he also didn’t have an income. He had plenty of savings, but he’d feel better with a job, he reckoned. Not that he knew what sort of work he would even enjoy. He also thought about lazy mornings and cafés and walking strange streets hand-in-hand with Draco in placed where no one knew them. “I’d like that,” he decided. “We could go somewhere new to both of us.”
“Exactly!” Harry said. “Is that what you want? Do we even like the same things? I can’t even talk to you about half the things you're keen on!”
“It’s not that I mind helping out—” Clark tries to explain.
Harry was about to offer some sympathy, but Draco’s scowl made it clear that that would not be appreciated, so instead he busied himself with shrinking Clark’s trunk down to save them from having to lug it up three flights of stairs.
Harry shifted, covering Draco’s body with his own and slotting their mouths together with practiced ease. This thing between them, it did mean something, and Merlin, Draco hated when Harry was right.
Harry bit his lip. Maybe Draco was right. He would have told Clark whatever he wanted to know because that was just his response to questions he knew the answer to. And then he'd be yolked to that creeping sadness that would more likely than not spoil his day, like it spoiled so many days, especially in the summer. Maybe it was alright to only talk about these things on his own terms.
Malfoy whirled, dark pink slashes of emotion visible over his cheekbones. “Where do you Apparition wards end?”
Harry nearly choked on his own saliva he was so stunned.
“Yes?” Scorpius replied, resigned to his fate. Why hadn’t he just said ‘
“Give me a minute,” Harry said, diligently moving Draco’s leg through the full range of motion. It seemed to be improving, “If I start snogging you now, I’m not sure when I’ll stop, and I probably won’t get to your knee at all, and then you’ll never walk properly again, and something tells me you can hold a grudge.”
“What’s your point, Granger?” Malfoy retorted, chin tilting, a defiant edge to his words.
Draco raised a palm to stop the explanation, which felt like half-protest, half-confession. It was typical of the girl, really. Being accused of any misbehaviour at school would set her rambling and pointing fingers at those who she perceived to be the true culprits of the misdeed in question. “I’ve no interest in assigning blame,” he assured her.
“Yes,” Draco repeated miserably. Harry tightened his grip.
Harry knocked to let her know he’d arrived, then entered.
“I thought about it,” Draco allowed. “For Scorpius’ sake, I almost convinced myself  to go, but in the end it was for his sake I stayed. I wanted him to know you can make a life from ashes, that past mistakes didn’t dictate one’s future, and that redemption is achievable—or at least I thought it was. Weasley tried his best to impress on me that that was not the case.”
Atwal held up a golden tie clip and shouted, “
“Go ahead, Potter,” Malfoy goaded, pressing impossibly closer. His lips brushed the hollow before Harry’s ear, but Harry couldn’t move, fixated on the torturous truths. Harry couldn't track from where this sudden, strange intensity had arisen. It left him discomfited: trapped and confused. “You think I don’t know how close you came to snapping my neck in front of my own son? I do. I fucking know you. I know you like no one else, isn't that right? So if you’re going to maim me again, you might as well get it over with.” Malfoy’s teeth flashed white, scraping against Harry’s jaw. Harry gasped painfully. He couldn’t make sense of the gesture, not until Malfoy shifted forward, the hard line of his cock stark evidence against Harry’s hipbone.
They walked another block, Harry inwardly reviewing the last couple of hours: how witty and charming and warm Tennyson was; how at times, he and Draco seemed to be speaking in a language Harry only half understood. The words were familiar, but their meanings shrouded. Names of designers, socialites, products, events, all skirting over Harry’s brain, refusing to consolidate into something sensical.
“It’s dreadfully unfair that you obtained that position when you don’t even give a toss about Potions,” Ri grumbled. “Especially when he’s one of the few professors at this school from whom I can actually learn something.”
“What about Neville?” Ron cried out.
“It’s just the truth, darling,” she said, “I’m sure Harry’s not uncomfortable with some slight familial sentiment.”
“No,” Harry stated firmly, realising it to be very much the truth. The storm of anxiety and want and doubt brewing within him had nothing to do with regret.
“I think I still have some S.P.E.W. buttons,” Hermione offered.
“Oh, Harry Potter, sir, it near blew me over when Winky said you’d asked a favour of little old Breety! Never in my long life has Breety been sought after by such a wizard!” Breety wheezed out a laugh, “You have saved my home, sir, there is not a thing I wouldn’t do for you!”
“He deserved it,” Jamie glowered.
, which will instantly apparate you to somewhere safe, without you having to conjure up an image of where you wish to go.”
“You’re such a caring, considerate and generous kid,” Harry told him, “I mean that.”
you interested? Do you want to be?”
“Not yet,” Hermione said, “Well, maybe McGonagall has. There will be a faculty meeting this evening and I’m sure we’ll get the highlights tomorrow.”
Had anyone else said that, it would have sounded boastful, Al reckoned, but Scorpius was never like that. He might not realise that most kids didn’t get to have expensive vacations, but he also never seemed to take them for granted.
“Ron, go fetch McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione said, her voice still pleasant and calm, “Harry’s unwell.”
“Oh. Well. What else do you do then?”
"You don't sound terribly alright. Something else troubling you?"
Blinking furiously, Scorpius scurried as quickly and as silently as he could back to Al and Jamie’s bedroom. His heart was pounding rapid fire within his chest and he felt…
“Yes.”
“Well, that’s crap,” Ginny announced, “that’s not the point of the DA at all! If they’re not going to use their powers for the common good then maybe we should just disband entirely? We only kept it running because so many students still were keen on the practical aspect of it.”
At dinner, Harry made the mistake of asking a question about Marx. As a result, after dinner, he was once again on the sofa with Clark, this time with a ‘zine. Draco set a fire in the grate before settling into his favourite chair, a whole stack of home decor magazines from Merlin-knew-where beside him. Constance perched on the back of the chair, looming over his shoulder. The extra bacon had done wonders for her opinion of him.
“Enough, Draco, stop. Too much.”
Potter shook his head. “How do you do it?”
“Jamie’s just using him to bother me! He doesn’t even like Scor!” Al erupted, freckled face shining red in the candlelight. He all but stamped his foot in his obvious fury, arms crossed over his chest and his chin jutting out indignantly.
“Such as?”
“Lovely, is that rosehip?”
Someone was shouting. Harry flailed about groggily, trying to orient himself. Remy was crying again from beside him. Fuck, had Harry fallen asleep with the baby? He ought to know better. Hell, he did know better, he’d just been so tired. He was still so tired, what time was it?
Ginny rolled her eyes and pulled out a scroll from her shabby satchel that had seen use by too many brothers. “Atwal, your chaser,” she said, finding his name on her list, “Figured they were quidditch mates, so it should be easy for them to get on.”
"Doesn't seem very likely," Zerk remarked.
“I didn’t get her first name, but that’s Lavender’s dad, yeah,” Harry confirmed.
“Oh, you know. It was always very
“I know it’s upset you,” Harry says carefully, “but I don’t think anyone else noticed as much as you think they did. Charlie flirts with everyone, no one will give it a passing thought. And almost everyone had something to drink, some more than others.”
“Feeling alright?” Father pressed, his shrewd eyes scanning Scorpius’ features for any sign of illness or fatigue. He came and sat on the bed, pressing a cool hand to Scorpius’ forehead, more out of habit than any belief that Scorpius would be fevered.
"I meant specifically don't tell him that, it's vulgar. You've seen him around Dean and Seamus, he's not exactly comfortable with the physical aspect of things. Stick with a euphemism. Say we're, I don't know, together."
It was a mistake.
Malfoy’s lips pursed and he nodded, “Seems that way.”
“Blimey,” Ron breathed, sounding half horrified and half amazed, “that’s all the apology I’m going to get, isn’t it?”
“You need a little prodding when it comes to potions.”
Draco sat himself down beside Clark. He put his hands on his knees. “It could,” he admitted. “You know better than most that terrible things happen.”
Really really love hearing from you all, I so appreciate your time and thoughtfulness.
The title for the series is from
“Hm,” was Malfoy’s only response. “Light the stove, won’t you? And fetch the olive oil.”
“No,” Malfoy shook his head, “not since that night.”
"You look
spell.
“Hullo, Malfoy,” Harry said, pushing the pram up to the table. “Terribly sorry we’re late.”
“Yes, not that it matters. You realise I can just Floo back here anytime I like? We’re going to your mum’s, not mine.”
Malfoy had wordlessly followed Harry to the rarely utilised study at the rear of the house. Harry had once had pleasant fantasies of curling up with the fire blazing, a cup of tea beside him and a frivolous spy novella in his lap. Then he’d had four children. Now he had mostly empty bookshelves and a great deal of dust.
Draco turned his head, gazing at Harry expectantly.
Draco wondered if he was allowed to just go and rouse Harry and get him to sort this for him. Harry would know what to do. He’d probably give the kid a hug and some hot cocoa and make a little joke and the whole thing would be easily settled with everyone feeling good about the resolution. But Draco didn’t think walking away just now would send Clark the sort of messages of acceptance and understanding that were expected here.
“I see,” Draco offered. “I’ll be more careful in future.”
Al beamed as he read the words, and immediately wrote a reply, balling it up and taking aim.
It was breakfast on Tuesday when Claire Gibbens approached Harry. She was flanked by the same girls who had been with her that day in Scrivenshafts. She was flushed with anticipation.
“Don’t,” Clark cuts him off. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
Harry tried not to think about the note he found on the kitchen counter four weeks ago, pinned in place by a large packet of baby formula that he hadn't had the first clue what to do with.
“It’s just those beautiful curls!” Not-Gran said, fussing over Jared’s hair. “Oh, when I was a girl, I wanted curls just like these more than anything!”
Harry didn’t know what to do with the ensuing silence.
“They were unharmed save for one who was tortured briefly, which you witnessed, I understand. They all spoke most highly of Mr. Malfoy’s bravery. I suspect a lot more ill would have befallen them if it were not for you.” She gave Draco a thoughtful, searching gaze. Harry realised it was one of pride.
Harry read out the speech Hermione had penned for him to a sea of sniffling spectators. Parents were holding tightly to their children; students were linking arms, tears streaming. It didn’t feel like six months ago for any of them, Harry realised. It might as well have all just finished up yesterday. In the very back of the hall he could make out the pinched faces of Draco and Narcissa Malfoy, a purposeful berth left around them by the rest of the onlookers.
“About that,” Harry hazarded. “Do you mind keeping this between us? Just until I’ve had the time to tell my friends and family.”
Harry grinned, “Pretty accurate first impressions, actually.”
“Oh, piss off, Jones,” Ron spat. “The point is, Winky said Clark was by there yesterday, asking for provisions, enough to last him a couple of days.”
“Shove off, Fife,” Al demanded coolly. Fife’s nonsense never bothered him or the Ojo twins, but he knew it laid Bingham low. “You don’t need to be an arsehole about it. Go on, Corin, I’m listening.”
“I would think so,” he puzzled.
Clark gave a short nod and scampered off.
Not-Gran looked surprised, then sad. “Oh, Merlin, I’m so sorry. I was just so excited to see you that I forgot.”
“When I came to Hogwarts,” Harry said thoughtfully, “I was an orphan. I had no memories of my parents and I didn’t even know I was a wizard until shortly before the start of term.”
“When do I not?” Harry grumbled, curling up behind him, and drawing him close, “I love you, you know.”
“I don’t exactly relish it myself.” Draco grumbled.
“The strength and resiliency you show by returning here, to the site of your trauma, speaks volumes. Your willingness to thrive in this dark world inspires your peers and your professors alike. I thank you for sharing it with me here today.”
“Uncle Ralph says it’s because he cares so much.”
“Please, Harry,” Draco whinged, “I can’t get deep enough, I fucking need you.”
“You don’t,” it was Molly Weasley who spoke this time, her voice cracking. “Harry, this is your home, you don’t have to leave.”
“This was an emergency dose. What he really needs a mind-healer,” Hermione replied grimly, “I thought the nightmares had eased off since this summer, but I should have guessed that incident in the autumn would bring things back up. I’ve never seen him this bad. I don't like it.”
“And why not?” Pansy insisted. “You going to stay celibate forever?”
“She converted her entire bedroom into a blanket fort which she’s called The Warren. I think she fancies herself too old to play pretend, but I could tell she wanted to. There was a lot of talk of a family of fictitious rabbits without her ever quite committing to a character.”
“I don’t know what your mother is feeling,” he told Al honestly. “But I don’t think she could ever stop loving you. But the truth is, Al, I can’t control what she is feeling, just as I can’t control what you are feeling or even what I am feeling, a lot of the time. What I can control are my actions. We’ve been hurting, our family, hurting each other. I wasn’t caring for you like I should.”
“Scor, wait!” Al called out. “I’m sorry, I’ll…”
“What is it? Something else bothering you?” Harry prodded gently.
“Unfortunately, Hogwarts has not been a safe place for Draco this year,” Harry said. “His interest in me, along with his affiliations during the war, have made him a target of violence. At my behest, he left the school when the news broke. I wanted a chance to investigate the issue. I now have done so.”
“You were?” Harry said, “Whatever for?”
“Merlin, I can scarcely wait. All I want is a serene body from which I can exorcise disease.”
“I thought Severus Snape was your potions professor, Dad?” Al pressed.
“They didn’t then either,” Harry felt obliged to say. “It was a whole conspiracy to get me away from Hogwarts, it had nothing to do with my merits.”
“Beside you, mate!” Yelled Ron, and Harry looked back to see he was indeed flanked by Ron and Goyle, “We’ll keep ‘em off you!”
Harry ignored the quivering lip of the child, which he suspected was what Clark wanted. Tiering reached for a toffee and shoved it in his mouth, his hands in his pockets.
“Hm,” Weasley said, surveying Scorpius. “And who’s this, I’ll be damned if you aren’t the spitting image of that little git—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Clark,” Harry said, “I don’t want him to feel used, and I don’t want him to think everyone else thinks he’s a charity case.”
“McGonagall was hoping,” Harry said when they pulled away a few minutes later, “that you and I might at least try to teach the Tiering kid some Occlumency. Not that it will solve the problem, but at least it will help him out a bit. His mum, she's a muggle, and she's got, ah, some sort of psychosis and it really freaked him out, thinking he had it, too."
His palm fell against Harry's heart, and instinctively Harry covered the hand with his own. Draco's cheek rested on Harry's shoulder and his voice was low and serious. The earnestness of his words intense as a brand. "Harry, I know loving me is something rather new to you, but I've lived and breathed loving you since childhood. I was desperate. I spent my life tormenting you, antagonizing you, pushing every button in every way I could think of. I tried lying to myself, denying myself, convincing myself my hatred towards you was something other than a shield. All of that just made me want you more. Nothing worked. And then the war happened and I fucking dreamed of you, longed for you. And finally, you saved me. You let me hold onto you and pulled me out of harm's way, just as I had bloody fantasised about. It wasn’t enough. I needed more. I needed you close. And I realised, just as my father did, that to get that, to get to have you, I’d have to let you perform another rescue. I needed to become another one of your strays, Harry, so that you’d keep me. It wasn't right, I know it wasn't, but I didn't care. I knew I should, but I just didn't. I wanted you.”
"We're aware, Professor," Hermione replied, "the last thing we want to do is cast aspersions on Lavender's family, but I cannot think of another reason why they would be up there."
(See the end of the chapter for
“But that’s the thing!” Clark sighs, looking up. “She does fine! She manages! And then something happens and she can’t manage any more.”
“I’m sorry for running and hiding and for distrusting you, Harry
“Lovely,” Harry said, forcing a grin. He handed over his galleons, barely bothering to register the amount. Receipt in hand, and he made for the door with long, quick strides.
He dropped the stick at Neville’s feet, then swept back to the other side, taking down another few players as he went.
He’d justified the first night they’d slept together. Harry had been lonely and upset and staying had been something Draco could just
“I’ve got some drills if you like, Harry,” Jones proposed sweetly.
speak of forgiving my father, I’ll have you checked into St. Mungo’s within the hour, Potter, that’s a promise."
“That’s lovely,” Harry assessed. “Shift your knees open more for me, love.”
“Merlin!” Pansy shrieked, loudly enough to make their tea cups rattle on their saucers. Draco winced.
“Harry, mate,” Ron piped in, breathlessly, “I’m so sorr—”
Malfoy looked at him, not willing to hope.
“Yeah,” Clark says, unconvinced. He wants them to make it better. He just doesn’t know what better looks like. “It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have demanded we have Christmas together. Only she didn’t want me at home, and I wanted to see Jared.”
“Ah. Right, yeah. Yeah, I was there, on the astronomy tower,” Harry repeated. “Dumbledore cast a body bind and hid me beneath my Invisibility Cloak.”
“Okay,” Clark agreed, “Okay, so go ahead. Tell me.” He steeled his gangly limbs in place, determined to hear Harry out.
“Yes, Father. If you say so.” Scorpius made a face.
“Oi!” Ron protested weakly, but he gave Harry a grateful but grim little smile.
As they stepped forward, an opening appeared like sliding automatic doors, disrupting the sheen in the side of the building. A gaunt looking wizard in a trim black robe embroidered with mauve and peach runes along the sleeves and hem.
“When did you get so old and sage, hm?” Harry chided with a small but earnest grin. He squeezed Teddy’s shoulder affectionately. “I am, love, or I soon will be, don’t fret. Decisions to be made, is all. I want to do right by you, by the kids.”

“You hid it from him?” Harry asked, amazed.
Jamie was a little late for lunch, having just met with the Gryffindor Head of House to discuss switching from Care of Magical Creatures to Hexbreaking. He was feeling peckish by now and started to put together a sandwich for himself from the cold meat and cheese spread. Jamie was always partial to sandwiches.
and handed it over to Harry.
"You weren't, anyone would have." Harry assured him gently, leaning up to kiss the sharp blade of Draco's cheekbone.
“I think you should come,” Harry considered, “I’m hitting forgiveness pretty hard in my speech...Hermione’s speech, really, but I have to give it. That’s the flavour of the thing, though. Forgiveness, forging forward, burying old grudges and celebrating new friendships.”
“Even just for appearances. I can shout at the DA all I want but Hermione thinks—”
“Merlin, I didn’t know anything was too ornate for your tastes.”
He took a seat across from them with a flourish of robes and picked up a powder-blue ostrich quill from the table beside him.
“Here, you’ll need this,” Draco announced, sliding over a thin volume entitled
“Fine,” sighed Clark.
“Thanks, that means a lot, it does,” Harry said, earnestly. “Ron, please don’t give him a hard time about this, alright? I know you two like to go at each other a bit, but leave this alone.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Harry retorted firmly. “It’s late. You’ve no food there, and if I know you, all your furniture is draped with dust covers. We’ll take him to the cottage. You two can take the boys’ room, it’s not as though they are using it. We’ll get him out and back in the morning with no one the wiser.”
“I don’t think Clark will run off again,” Harry offered with a yawn. Now that Draco mentioned it, he was feeling quite sleepy. “He feels badly about it, now. But yes, I suppose I should turn in, especially if Hermione’s predictions about the blue moon amplifying Lavender’s powers comes true.” He braced himself on his thighs and stood, slowly, feeling the rock and sway of inebriation as he did. “Potent stuff, that.”
Clark doesn’t know if that’s true. He doesn’t know if he doesn’t
Mother blinked, clearly not understanding. “One can always have more, surely?” she wondered.
“Yeah, but pleeease?”
Harry leaned against the table, but Draco started pacing, arms tight around his torso, face stricken.  It only took him about eight strides each way. Harry let him cross the floor, once, twice, three times.
“Nah,” James replied, “Dad’s just being all mopey and reclusive.”
Together, Harry and Draco went to the new Slytherin common room to collect Clark. To Harry’s surprise, Atwal was already there, looking altogether much more alert and put together than Harry felt.
“Merlin!” Harry responded.
“Clark,” Hiram hissed, but Harry grinned and stood, winking at the younger boys.
Draco turned and examined the man’s face. He didn’t look curious or keen at the exciting diagnosis like some healers had. He didn’t appear to be plotting or calculating Scorpius’ worth to the right buyers. No, Potter looked distraught, concerned for Scorpius’ welfare. His dark brows were curled inwards, tucking under the straight line of the black frame of his clubmasters. His mouth was pursed with the gravity of it all. Potter wanted, Draco realised suddenly, to
“It’s bollocks,” he muttered, feeling like he was whinging, but also it really, really was bollocks. He was so very tired of it all.
“Oh!” Harry blurted out, his face flushed scarlet. He felt sweat pooling between his shoulder blades. He’d assumed it was old news by now, this heavy shame, that it would have made the gossip columns months ago. Then again, no one knew, not outside the Weasleys and Draco, so perhaps word of the whole painful mess had managed to remain under wraps. “Uh, that won’t be necessary,” he muttered. “We’ve separated, Gin and I.” His right hand flew unthinkingly to his left finger, and Penelope’s eyes followed the gesture. “So it will just be Lily, Remy and I moving in.”
“Has it?” Harry choked out, trying to keep his eyes from bugging out and landing in the froth of his beer.
“‘Course,” Ron replied, he kissed Hermione and stood, “Let’s get our cloaks, then.”
“Wait!” Harry told Atwal, “You can’t do the spell if she’s in Clark’s head, we don’t know what will happen.” He turned to Clark and Lavender. “Fuck, what have you done.”
Harry took Malfoy’s face with his free hand, pressed their lips together. Walburga shrieked, a blood-curdling noise that sent Constance to hooting miserably from the sitting room.
“What?” Al asked, his brows furrowed.
He was seated across from Zerk in the poppy room at St. Mungo’s.
Harry winced, “Yeah, my godfather didn’t think much of all that bigotry either.”
Today when they arrived, the pews were gone and in the expanse of the open floor were large, cozy-looking sectionals and easy chairs, arranged in an oblong (to fit the narrow room) ring.
His son gave a standard grunt in response. Harry fished out a handkerchief and blew his nose, repocketed the thing and leant back against the counter. Across from him, Jamie did the same thing, his arms crossed.
“My dad, you mean?”
“Go check on Hiram,” Harry directed, jerking his head towards the entrance hall, “think he could use a friend.”
“It’s normal to feel upset,” Harry told him quietly, “You can go if that is what you would like, of course, but, if you could, please consider staying here, just for a bit. Talk things out with me, I think it would help. I don’t want you leaving here and feeling poorly and not having anyone to go to.”
Harry was gobsmacked. It was the first thoughtful thing Jamie had done for the baby in months. Usually, Jamie’s sole involvement with Remy was to complain how the baby’s cries woke him up at night. Harry felt inordinately moved.
“An anomaly,” Ri assured her.
“Yes,” Draco leered, “there is some pretty solid evidence of my effects pressed into my abs."
“Yes, of course. Like Al, I already know your news.” He gave an uncharacteristic grin which, along with the newly-acquired use of Al's nickname, Harry saw with crystal clarity was solely for the purpose of setting Ron’s blood to boil. Conniving arsehole. Harry sighed, shaking his head. Nevertheless, he felt a bit amused seeing the purple tinge spreading across Ron’s cheeks as he righted his chair and slumped onto it. Draco really was a masterful provocateur, Harry would give him that.
He wandered towards the kitchen. He arrived in the doorway only to have a bottle thrust at him by Jamie.
“What, what is it?”
“Very well. You’ll tell me if you change your mind.” Their eyes met, and Harry felt oddly as though Draco were about to rip a plaster off his skin. A necessary task but nevertheless unpleasant. “Monday, then.”
“Did you find something for tomorrow, then, Ron?” Harry said, changing the subject as he stepped behind them to heat the kettle.
“Draco, what is it?” Harry urged, running a hand along the other boy’s shoulder blades as if he could find a specific fault to fix, but there were no clues. He stroked up along Draco’s spine, the nape of his neck, the base of his skull. He threaded his fingers through the fine blond hair, but still no response.
He felt Draco’s hand on his leg, giving him warm reassurance just as Dudley reached a mammoth gorilla arm across the table, and squeezed Harry’s shoulder. “I’m sorry for it,” he said, seriously, “I’ve learned a bit more about why we had to go into hiding last year. You didn’t have to keep an eye out for us, you had no reason to want to protect us, but you made sure it was taken care of, anyway.”
“Got to have some perks to make up for the lack of privacy,” Harry said ruefully, shooting Draco a grateful smile. He attempted to set Remy down in his swing, but the baby was not having it, and threatened to start screaming again, so Harry quickly course corrected and cuddled him close, instead. “Hush now pumpkin, you’re all right,” he cooed, then looked back to Draco, once Remy had settled. “Have you eaten, babe, can I get you anything?”
Harry remained alone at the table with the pitiless tomes. They offered him no guidance. He sat with his forehead resting on his palm for a few minutes, rather at a loss. Was he supposed to leave Draco alone and give him more time? Were they supposed to have this out here and now? He’d felt so sure in the safety of Zerk’s office, but now he felt just as muddled as before. Fuck it, he needed to know. Draco owed him the truth, at the very least.
“You’re too generous by half.”
As students returned, Neville marked each path that had been searched with a large glowing red X. Group after group returned, shaking their heads, shrugging, then choosing a new path and following it instead.
“Fuck,” Draco breathed, face staining pink as he wriggled with an anxious, aroused sort of shame. Harry loved taking apart the poised, unflappable boy, loved finding those vulnerabilities and tearing into them. “How do you want me?”
Harry woke up the next morning with dim sunlight shining through the pale grey curtains. He was curled around Draco and Merlin, it felt liberating to wake up with him instead of having to slink away to his own bed in the early hours of the morning. He pulled Draco closer and kissed him behind his ear. Draco grumbled wordlessly in response, but shifted back, letting Harry hold him.
Merlin, Harry didn’t even know what that last one sounded like, but his imagination supplied it nonetheless. He felt his cock take interest in that idea, too.
Beneath the table, Draco’s hand crept in and up along Harry’s thigh. Merlin help me, Harry thought, shifting slightly in his seat, feeling his cock twitch in response to Draco’s audaciousness. He set his jaw, pretending to be engrossed in
, that was the usual first symptom. How long had he been sitting there, hoping it would pass, that it didn’t foretell what he knew it did? Draco brushed a platinum lock of hair off his son’s forehead.
“Sorry,” Harry said, “could you direct us to the Ministry for Child Welfare?”
“I don’t know,” Malfoy seethed. “Several hours, maybe more. He needs his potion.”
“Catch you off guard?” Harry asked, resuming the more gentle ministrations of earlier, squeezing Draco’s arse affectionately.
“He is,” Harry granted, then added a hint of teasing to his tone to ease the mounting tension: “A lot of hot air and bluster and absolutely no follow through.”
“Didn’t know you were such a poet, Potter,” Draco teased, but with the gentlest of smiles, and a kiss to his cheek. Harry dropped his head to Draco’s shoulder, let the other boy run soothing hands over his neck, his back and oh,
In response, Draco shut his eyes and sank below the surface.
“Like potions?” Harry asked.
The Daily Prophet
“Hm,” Draco acknowledged. He added a dash of milk to his own tea and sat down across from Harry.
“Breety notices, Breety takes careful inventory. No other sheets, Harry Potter, not a one.”
Harry nodded, “Killing Voldemort scattered the Death Eaters, but I have no way of knowing if it changed their minds. More likely, those who escaped, or hell, even those rotting in Azkaban, are simply resentful and plotting, waiting for an opportunity to rise again. And the only way to prevent it is by hoping enough people believe me, choose my beliefs over theirs. For me to reach the undecided before someone else can."
“Sorry?” Harry asked.
“This is how they get you,” Fife muttered in warning. “Hold onto your Galleons!”
“Ah. Well, I’ll go with you, then,” Jamie offered.
“And completely neglectful of things that don’t capture his attention,” Potter shook his head, bemused. “I can’t make heads or tails of his interests from one day to the next.”
Curiously, Harry looked from side to side of the vast nothingness. Then he spotted Draco, leaning casually against a black wall, a smirk on his lips, wearing nothing but his black pants and thermal. Even though Harry was used to seeing him in this outfit, even used to seeing Draco in no outfit at all, these days, he still felt that thorough twang of want reverberate through him. Harry was about to step towards the projection of Draco when all at once the figure whirled around, and peel down those tight black pants, revealing his bony, pale arse wriggling about, mooning him. He heard a delighted cackle and then was promptly shoved out.
“More.”
“I know,” Harry acknowledged. He ran his hand down the boy's back, soothingly. “I’m sorry. I do like to give you your privacy, but you’ve got us all worried, love.”
“Another excellent question. I’m afraid I don’t have an answer for you.”
Harry ignored Draco’s attempt to keep his distance, pressing onwards as if Draco hadn’t said a word. “Pain?” he guessed and Draco’s chest tightened because yes, yes,
“Kiss me,” Draco demanded.
“I can’t, Dad,” Lily insisted. “I need the acoustics.”
“I’m sorry I frightened you,” Harry murmured softly.
“And she loves you, too, Harry,” Charlie continued, “even before you and Ginny were together, you were already a son to her, and that didn’t end just because you two broke up.”
“It’s not that, Dudley,” Harry sighed. “I guess it’s a relief to have someone who was there for all that stand up and say it really was as grim as I remember. That it wasn’t okay for them to have done the shit they did, because it really, really wasn't. I appreciate how you’ve thought about it, how you’re trying to do right by me, I do. I just probably need some time. We’ll get a pint this summer, how about?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry ground out, “I didn’t mean to do that to you.”
The reaction didn’t come. Instead, there was only warmth and a sense of being rather cared for in a way he wasn’t sure he appreciated. Any hopes he’d had that being with Potter would somehow get it out of his system were clearly dashed.
Harry had used the new spells Hermione had taught him to tidy the kitchen and the living room. Then Remy had woken up and Lily had wanted a snack, then they’d migrated back to the drawing room, where Lily had a little easel and some watercolours arranged by the window.
Harry bit his lip, “You’re sure?”
Draco growled. “Not what I meant. I just...it’s not enough. I want to atone properly."
“I’m not in the habit of forcing participation,” Harry explained. “I’m certainly sad to see you go, but it is clear you have made up your mind and far be it for me to coerce or cajole you.”
“It’s a recent development,” Draco began. “Vates often present just prior to the onset of puberty.”
When Harry stepped off of Hogwarts grounds, he apparated. Instead of Grimmauld Place, he was surprised to find himself instead at the entrance to St. Mungo's. He supposed that was what was on his mind. He’d seen Zerk only a few days ago and they’d talked about the damned article, but Harry hadn’t been able to make a decision. His conversation with Clark had rattled him more than he thought, he supposed. As much as he wanted to see Draco, he somehow still wasn't ready.
"Your whole
Harry yanked at his knuckles, a habit he seemed to be acquiring for when it came time to parse his feelings. He still didn’t say anything.
There was a flash of their old Auror days in the phrase, Ron and Harry reviewing cases early in the morning, strategising over raids on nests of Death Eater holdouts. Those had been exciting, triumphant days, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to miss them, not when he knew how the job cut into Ron’s evenings and weekends: the little things he’d missed in Rose and Hugo’s lives. Ron had been pissed like this when Harry had transferred departments, but that had been ages ago and any lingering resentments had long since cooled. They always did. Harry grinned back at his friend. “Well, something very near as thrilling as solving a cold case: sorting baby clothes into things that still fit Remy, and things that don’t, followed by tossing out nappies that are too stained or ratty to hold on to.”
“Anyway,” Harry tried to smile, “pick whatever owl you like. It’s not about what’s best.”
Thank you everyone for taking the time to read this!
“Wow, real reassuring there, Draco.”
“Because Pansy Parkinson and I are such close mates,” Harry commented dryly. “And no, I, er...didn’t have a lot of reason to trust most adults when I was a kid. And the few I did sort of trust usually weren’t in a position to help me. And I was proud, I guess. I wanted to bear it, didn’t want her to know she was getting to me.”
“Sorry!” Lily chirped brightly, whatever drama she’d be embroiled in at school was clearly no longer troubling her. “Hello, Professor, enjoying the weather? And did you fly here? And is that your broom I saw near the front door?”
Ron chuckled darkly, “Better not let him get near that stuff too often, seems pretty potent.”
“Al, love!” Harry exclaimed, crossing the room hastily. He sank down beside the boy. “Whatever is the matter?”
Harry found the portkey the Appleby Arrows administration had stashed in the phonebox near his house. It was an old can of tuna fish in the phone book slot that he was not thrilled about having to reach inside. He felt the familiar but unsettling sensation behind his navel, and arrived at the front gates of a large, professional quidditch pitch in North Lincolnshire. Harry knew from all his and Ron’s ‘research’, that it was somewhere near Trent Falls, but from the ground all he could see were the massive elevated spectator stands, striped in broad swaths of pale blue and black. Ahead of him was a registration table with a young, sharp-nosed witch seated behind it.
“Was that a yes?”
“Oh,” Ron grunted, shoving his hands into the pockets of his faded jeans. “I don’t know. Just I’m sorry. And I’m glad Remy’s alright and that you’re doing better.”
“Brilliant!” Harry agreed, “I’ll bring Ron!”
“Of course she did,” Ron replied. “She thought he just wanted to have a hearty midnight snack with friends, or some nonsense.”
“Yes, but you still have more than you need,” Clark argued.
Harry grinned and then, finally,
“I didn’t want your conscience to interfere.”
“You have now completed the second section. Our next section measures raw speed. At the green light, you may proceed in a forward direction. Stop when you see the light change to red.” Shanna’s voice instructed.
“Merlin, I’ve missed you,” he admitted.
Pansy curled a glossy red lip. “Oh yes, that. But not this evening? Astoria’s not…”
Draco came without warning. Potter and his fucking mouth, always talking, saying things he oughtn’t to, not yet, no matter how unfathomably true they might be. Draco shuddered, spurting off helplessly with a startled groan.
Fife pursed his lips, hating to be disobeyed, but refused to acknowledge Al’s facetiousness otherwise.
“Six stunning spells to take down a first year student?!” McGonagall scolded.
Hermione surveyed the three boys thoughtfully, her eyes lingering on Draco, “I think we should all go,” she concluded, “we were all there, we might have picked up on something the others didn’t.”
Draco felt disappointment curl low in his belly but he nodded, returning his head to rest against his forearms. He resolved to himself that he’d not stop Harry, no matter what. He wanted to take whatever was on offer tonight, no matter how difficult.
Nearly every student in the school was at least a little afraid of Scorpius’ father. Professor Malfoy had a reputation for being strict and uncompromising. If he’d overheard Fife’s words, it would land the boy with a weeks’ worth of detention.
“Well, I’m not sure I’d ever call him Ri to his face,” Scorpius confessed. “I’m a bit scared of him.”
Jamie glanced to the head table, where his dad was sitting with Professor Malfoy. It had been weird, this summer, having the professor show up at first, like seeing a yeti in the desert, something terribly out of place. When he was in primary school, he’d thought his teachers somehow lived in the school house full time, and even though of course he knew better now, it had still been a bit jarring to see Professor Malfoy step out of the Floo. But then he had kept showing up, and Jamie had gotten used to his being around. It had meant no more beans on toast, which was a major boon, in Jamie’s opinion. And Dad seemed relieved to have a friend as well, lighter somehow and less stressed all the time. Parents needed friends as much as anyone, Jamie supposed.
“Bit of a one-woman show going on there,” Harry grumbled.
“Alright, that’s alright,” Harry soothed, “Let’s just duck in here until you’re feeling better, then.”
“Merlin, Ri, do you ever listen to yourself?” Fort accused. “You sound like a little Lord Voldy in training.”
Al looked like he wanted to say a great number of things, but after a quick glance at Scorpius, he swallowed them down.
“Let’s go.”
“Aren’t we playing Malfoy’s team tomorrow?”
“Yes, fine, Jesus. Message received,” Clark groused. “But I’m not sticking around while you have this one out. So. Goodnight.” He scampered off.
Harry laughed and shook his head, straightening his legs.
“Have none of you used the Internet?” He inquired.
“Very well. It is good you are so capable, and have friends to watch over you,” her eyes flickered to Harry, who swallowed nervously.
“I’m sorry to intrude,” Draco said, forcing himself not to match the man’s aggressive tone. “Potter took Lily and Remus home, but the boys were loath to leave without seeing you, so I offered to watch them. This is my son, Scorpius; he’s a good friend of Albus’.”
But children weren’t meant to be repulsed by their mothers, especially not before they were grown. Scorpius knew this. He heard the way his classmates talked about their mums, and while kids got angry or frustrated or embarrassed, they were never
“Not on my watch,” Shanna winked, “I’m very good at my job.”
“How do you know?” Jamie demanded, his face pressed into Harry’s shoulder.
“His is not solely to blame. Scorpius chose to go along with it.”
“What
“Yeah, well Mum feels like it is.”
“Who,” He demanded.
“I know,” she sighed, “Harry, take a turn, please, I don’t want to talk about this any longer.”
“Untouched as the purely driven snow, I’m afraid.” Malfoy replied with a shrug.
There was a suspended silence, but finally, with a shuffle of fabric, the pale, pointed face of Scorpius Malfoy appeared, hovering above the cot.
“Right then," Malfoy resumed, "Circumstances are actually not bad, since you’ll be able to have your wand on you. Use it, it makes things easier. Most Occlumens have to complete the spell silently and wandlessly. Not the case here.” He proceeded to teach Tiering the incantation and accompanying gesture. Clark demonstrated it several times, Draco firing off corrections—”Plant your feet, more swoop.
“When did you become all pro-Draco Malfoy?” Harry demanded.
“You saw Snape!” She turned to him and gestured for him to elaborate.
“Death Eaters?” Neither of them said anything to that. They had really gone and fucked this one up. They had put everyone in the castle in danger. These people were ruthless, they wouldn’t care who they hurt in getting what they wanted done. Other business...Exactly what other business did they intend to get done tonight?
“It’s fine I suppose.” Her face quickly broke into a wide smile. “At least you both have stopped acting so stupid.”
“Right, anyway, don't you need help with your Potions homework?” He said quickly.
“What’s wrong Draco?” Luna asked, sitting beside him in the library. He knew better by now than to hide things from Luna.
That same day Severus left and they were alone again. The five of them were in the living room, warming themselves by the fire.The heat made him feel sick. Draco was listening to everyone talk about founding Weasley, he didn’t have the heart to participate in the conversation. It wasn’t like he ever came up with any good ideas. Harry and Hermione kept giving each other side glances, as if they knew something that the rest of them didn’t. After what must have been the fifth side glance Ginny exploded on the pair of them.
There was a sharp rapping on Draco’s door and he quickly shoved the letter under a book.
He couldn’t believe it. Every single part of him was practically humming with excitement. Harry hadn’t mentioned anything about the letter. But after a terribly awkward conversation he had agreed to let Draco go with him to Muggle London. Draco had absolutely no bloody idea what Harry was supposed to be doing in Muggle London, but honestly he didn’t care. Ginny impatiently waved them off.
“Weasley.” Draco said, drawing himself up.
“I’m sorry Draco. This is war.” War. They were still kids, they shouldn't have to think about war. Without a word Draco stood from his seat and left the room. He glanced around, trying to find wherever Harry had gone to tell him of his plan. After searching the area he realized that Harry was no longer there. No matter, he would tell him later.
Draco
I’m very tired of thinking about Potter. I don’t want to think about him anymore. I want to move on with my life and find someone else who might appreciate you. Of course it’s my terrible luck that I would develop a soul sucking crush on my worst enemy. But anyway, that’s enough about me and my sorrows. How are you? Have you sent any letters to Ginevra? You should, I bet she likes you an awful lot. Also, I hope you are staying safe. You-Know-Who is back. I’m certain of it. This isn’t a very cheery letter. I wish I had something happy to tell you. How are the wrackspurts doing?
“Fine, I’m fine. I have to go.” He shook himself out of Severus’s grip and ran to see Luna. He burst into the hospital wing and nearly knocked Ginevra over in the process.
“Right. I understand, I promise.” he said simply.
Draco swallowed. “Him.”
One rather awful thing has happened of late, however I suppose something good has come out of it. First off I want you to know that Hermione isn’t going to die. Because I’m going to break into my house, find some damn potions, and take you with me when I leave. Sure, this could go terribly terribly wrong. But Granger needs potions and I need you, so fuck it. Really there isn’t anything else we can do. I hope you don’t punch me when I rescue you. I feel sick every time I think about it. I know what’s going to happen when I see you again, and yet I still delude myself into thinking we’re going to make out once it’s safe. I’m going to end it here and stop torturing myself. I leave very soon after all. See you soon Potter.
“Yes you do.” Potter shook his head. “I want you to leave us alone.”
“Poor Harry.” Luna said. “He looks nervous.” Draco nodded. He did look nervous. Probably because he was such a shite dancer.
Draco flung his letter box under the couch as Severus walked into the room. Draco was honestly surprised that he was still here. For sure he had thought that he would’ve left by now. However he seemed to want to stay to make sure Hermione healed properly and they knew what they were doing. It quickly became clear to Severus that they were a lost cause. No one knew where Weasley was, it seemed he had done his job of disappearing almost too well. And Potter kept mentioning something about finding artifacts or something or other. Draco didn’t know what was happening anymore. He had given up trying to keep track of the disaster they were stuck in.
“I hate that name.” His cousin practically growled. Severus said nothing, only staring at Potter. Oh shite. He was trying to legilimence Potter. Draco drew up his own shields but had no way to warn Potter about what Severus was doing. Or...Harry. Could he call Potter Harry now? Draco had so many questions that he needed answered. He was going insane, standing here next to him but not being able to hold him. Severus’s eyes snapped to Draco and he gulped. He certainly did not look happy for Draco.
“The hippogriff?” he asked cautiously, making his way up a long stairway.
“Okay, see you in potions?” Draco asked, just to give himself something else to say.
“Professor Snape?” Luna asked, her face suddenly lit up in excitement.
Malfoy
He winced, waiting for someone to come running. The house stayed eerily quiet. This was fucking creepy. After no one attacked him, he flung himself down the stairs to the dungeons. All the thoughts seemed to flow out of his brain. Only a name was wrapping itself around Draco again and again. It was pitch black down there.
Dear Potter,
“I agree.” Potter said without missing a beat. Draco felt himself get hot. Potter had just agreed with him. He felt happiness spread all the way down to his toes. He was a mess these days, honestly.
“Sorry sorry.” She said, screwing her eyes shut. “Blood, you know how it makes me.”
“You’re not.” her eyes brightened and she looked at him hopefully.
“I was just-just-”
“Wait, they're going to kill Buckbeak?” Draco said, astounded. “Why on earth would they do that? And who’s going to kill him?”
“That’s what we said last time.”
Sincerely,
Neither of them said a word. Draco and Harry continued to stare at each other, the silence stretching painfully. Ginny’s smile fell into a frown as she surveyed the scene.
“I like you too.” Understatement of the fucking century.
“I know, you’re just trying to protect me.”
“And I actually thought we might make it through the whole train ride.”
“Morning?” he asked sleepily, rubbing a hand to his eyes.
Blowing out a breath Draco folded the letter and put it away. He wondered if he would ever actually give these letters to Harry. Perhaps when they were older and all this was very far behind them. He didn’t know what to do. He was trapped in an ever enclosing box with no perceivable way out. If he pounded his fists on any side, it would topple on top of him and everyone he cared about. He drove the heels of his palms into his eyes and shuddered a shallow breath.
“Sorry.” Draco could hear the sheepishness in Potter’s voice from here. After the three of them had vanished from sight Draco dragged himself out from the alcove and tried not to look too depressed. He didn’t want his mother asking what was wrong. Because. Everything. Everything was wrong and Potter was confusing and he was still a death eater.
“Heyyy.” Harry complained, tugging at his arm playfully. Draco pretended he didn’t see the shadows in his eyes as he said it.
Draco put a hand to the back of his neck awkwardly. He didn’t know what to say to that. It was true after all.
She shrugged, “That’s exactly what I mean, the way he looks at you, and talks about you when you’re not around...it’s kind of obvious.” She glanced around the common room to make sure he wasn’t in earshot, even though it was a little late for that. “And he’s nice, and sweet, and you should really give him a chance.”
“He still remembers you and most else-” Hopefully. “It was just me I erased.”
“Okay?”
“Know what you mean.” Theo sighed. “Bloody parents mate, they want us to do all their dirty work.”
Her eyes flickered between them before she sighed and twisted her hands together. “I know, I know.”
“What.” Weasley said quietly. Potter looked angrily at him and then back at Ron.
“I really am sorry about reading the letters.” Harry blurted out in a rush.
“Go.” Severus said gruffly, giving Draco a push then a nod towards the empty corridor. Draco nodded hastily and waved a pitiful goodbye before breaking into a run to find Hermione. He yanked the coin out of the message and tried to ignore the pitfalls of his stomach as he read the message.
“Oh, and don’t mention this to anyone. Even my mother.” Draco said, glancing back. Borgin glanced upward before bowing and replying.
“I will bring them to the castle.”
The end.
“What’s up with you?” Pansy asked.
“I agree.” Luna said simply, with a small nod.
“Yes, yes I suppose everything is fine.” Snape sat next to Draco. “We have to discuss something important.”
“I had a question.” He said, eyes cast downwards. Draco frowned.
“Well you got it now.”
“Harry!” Hermione’s eyes grew wide and she shot an apologetic look towards Draco. “He rescued you, you have to remember that!”
It feels strange writing to you now knowing that you’ve finally read all of my other letters. I think I might actually give this one to you, as there’s really nothing for me to lose anymore. I was angry, extremely angry, with you at first. A part of me still is. Though after quite a bit of contemplation I have come to terms to why you read all of my letters. I’m sorry I botched the obliviate. I don’t think I was trying very hard to do it correctly and now you’re paying for my mistakes. I hope you can forgive me for that. I don’t know how to be around you anymore. It scares me, you know everything about me, and I still don’t know that much about you. I was speaking to Ginny a few nights ago, and she told me that you hardly ever talk about yourself. And when you do you always seem to be uncertain. I have no idea what your family is like, you told me you wanted to be an auror after Hogwarts a while ago, but I’m fairly certain that you were lying. If it is alright with you, I would like to get to know you. We haven’t spoken more than a few words together since that particular incident, and I was wondering if it would be easier for the both of us if we write to each other instead? Sure it may seem incredibly sappy and a bit stupid as we sleep a couple feet away from each other, yet something tells me that this is a good idea. Normally I’m full of terrible, reckless ideas, but I don’t feel a looming sense of dread so I must be right. I won’t be offended if you don’t want to. I merely wanted to try, because I miss you.
