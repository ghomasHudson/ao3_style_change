The food looked absolutely delicious, and much more appetizing now that he wasn’t sitting in the Hospital Wing. There were two steaming plates of veggies, roast beef, shepherd’s pie, and treacle tart.
at him. Actually fucking smiled. Draco didn’t smile back. Yes, he was trying to be nicer to Potter, but that did not include smiling at the git. It never would include smiling at the git.
Potter went on, “You could have just waited for me to show up. I would’ve been your partner if you’d have just asked.” His voice was soft now, and sounded very understanding.
Harry was practically lying across the table to reach Draco, and his eyes were mere inches from his own, concern written all across them. His lips sending out soft breaths across his own. Harry’s cheeks a bright pink, probably mirroring his own.
Draco wanted to be left alone so he could perish in peace. He didn’t want Harry, of all people, seeing him in agony from foolishly running into a wall. He was pretty sure his nose was bleeding, and when he looked at his fingers that had been clutching it before Harry had fallen on top of him, they came back stained a dark red, and he groaned even more.
This, in the first place, was extremely optimistic thinking of him; going up to the people he had wronged in his life and admitting his misdeeds. He knew he had to do it, he had made a promise to himself during the Curse, although it was much harder than he would have liked. But, it was only the beginning of February: he had a lot of time to figure things out.
“Ha ha, well funny story. I didn’t really pay any attention in that class. So, I really don’t know anything about Space.”
“Malfoy, you need to go to the Hospital Wing. Like now. Can you walk? Never mind, you probably can’t. I’ll go get a teacher-”
“If we’re going to be stuck with each other for Merlin knows how long, tell me what the hell is going on with you.”
Draco continued to sit up in his bed, and pushed all thoughts about the vision-like-dream from his mind. He found he was surprisingly hungry. He looked over at the little bedside table next to him, expecting there to be food or tea set out, because he knew Madame Pomfrey couldn’t resist fussing over him and making sure he ate, especially breakfast which he knew people argued was ‘the most important meal of the day.’ But there was nothing on the table safe for his wand, an empty water glass, and a bandage wrap…
“What if we split up and then someone comes into Hogwarts and kills you? Or I get killed in Hogsmeade?”
He’d gotten a new scar, too. Where the killing curse had hit him. Right over his heart. A lightning bolt just like Harry’s.
“This might be too personal a question to ask, and I totally understand if you don’t want to answer it,” Harry rambled, his eyes still searching Draco’s. “But, how- how did you get this scar?” Harry finally lifted his head, his hand slowly reaching out to touch Draco’s right cheek, hovering over the scar that was there, silently asking for Draco’s permission to touch.
He turned his attention towards one of the couches in the back corner of the common room where a girl was lying. He could make out the short, black hair of his only friend from anywhere. It was Pansy. Something sparked inside of Draco, a sharp fear and heartache for the girl who constantly chose to hang out with him.
He had been hit with disbelief at the words Potter had said, but hadn't really felt the loss of everyone else's presence until he had seen Pansy. Now, it was like they absolutely needed to do everything in their will to break whatever
“STOP!” Draco yelled, getting to his feet and standing directly in front of Harry, hopefully shielding all of Harry’s body.
“You know, I would love to reminisce in our past, Harry, but not right now while I’m in pain and my nose is bleeding.”
He brushed a finger across Harry’s face. “I could just say it over and over and over again. Thank you for everything, Harry.”
Draco hadn’t used Occlumency that night, finding he wanted to speak to the figure again. About many things that couldn’t yet be explained. He knew if he had a chance to encounter the figure again, it wouldn’t be likely he would answer any of Draco’s questions, but Draco wanted to try at the very least.
Apparently, Alec had fled the scene sometime after Harry had already started to carry Draco up to the castle. Authorities hadn’t been able to find Alec until around the week Draco had been conscious in the Hospital Wing, playing games and chatting with Pansy and his mum.
Draco didn’t know how group therapy sessions benefit him at all. He should’ve gotten a pass on the whole thing at the beginning of the year when it started. It was not like he would ever willingly speak up to share his feelings. His classmates would probably shoot him daggers with their eyes if he did. He knew they thought he shouldn’t get to feel remorse when there were others more deserving of it. Draco honestly agreed with them.
Draco really was tired, and was at least somewhat glad they didn’t have to wait until twelve anymore to stir the stupid potion for fifteen minutes. Draco could go instantly to bed, curled up in Harry’s warm blankets that smelled of Harry’s soap, and fall asleep with the knowledge of someone right next to him, caring for him and protecting him.
He’d known throughout the past couple years, that he was going to die a tragic death, because that was what accompanied someone who’d done countless unspeakable crimes. But facing death, for real, and knowing others would die because of him, was petrifying.
every step of the way. He was now on the main floor, poking his head into classrooms and the Great Hall. No luck.
Everything that happened before he went to sleep last night came back to him in flashes. He remembered the Dark Mark
Draco fought back the urge to strangle Potter. He was not having this conversation. Sure, Potter had testified on Draco’s behalf at his trial. Potter was the one who had gotten Draco out of a five year sentence to Azkaban. Potter had practically saved his life. Not for the first time. But Draco hated being reminded of the terrible things he had done and their consequences. Especially when they were brought up by Potter. The very definition of all things good and light in the world.
Through all the movement and voices, Draco could just make out Harry on the other side of the hall. He was accompanied by Granger and Weasley. All three of them were looking at him, and Hermione gave him a smile and a thumbs up, which he appreciated.
“So you’re a stalker?” Draco huffed, then came to a realization. “That completely explains sixth year and how you always knew where I seemed to be! You are a stalker!”
Draco wanted to know more. He wanted to know how Harry had met Alec, and if Alec’s dad was coming back to England, and how Olive had died during the war. Maybe Draco’s family had imprisoned her. Instead he nodded his head, and returned his attention back to the door.
The article went on to state in full detail everything that went down That Night. Draco was horrified that everyone now knew in detail what had accumulated between Drys and him. But looking around the Great Hall, with all eyes set on him and not in an air of loathing, was one of the best feelings he’d ever experienced. He briefly wondered which Auror had been the source, and why they would do such a thing for him.
“Harry! Merlin, Harry, I’m here. I’m here, I'm here and I’m not letting go.” Draco let the tears fall down his face freely. Draco was fussing with the other boy’s body, moving Harry’s head so that it rested on Draco’s lap, and so Draco could lean down and wrap his arms around Harry’s freezing stomach. Hopefully bringing life and warmth back into the liveliest person he knew.
It was officially two Sundays from the event with Drys, and Draco was still in the Hospital Wing. Of course, he hadn’t had much of a choice the first week he was in the Wing, as he was in a half-coma and everyone thought he’d end up dying because he’d been struck by Avada Kedavra.
They sat in silence for a good five minutes, only the noise of wind and their breathing to be heard.
The book hadn’t provided them with any information regarding the time span of when the effects should start to work their way through a human’s body, but Draco supposed it worked like any other potion. Which meant, based on logic and knowledge, the effects of a potion should start to work between the time span of a few seconds, and up to five minutes.
When Draco had used the term ‘Dark Lord,’ Harry gave him an exasperated look, and Draco was certain Harry was going to scold him, but instead, he looked sorry, and he snuggled up closer to Draco, like he finally understood why it was so incredibly hard for him say You Know Who’s real name.
The statue miraculously moved and revealed a spiral staircase. Draco looked skeptically between Potter and the newly-revealed entranceway. “Crumpets? How did you-”
Draco, on the other hand, was extremely embarrassed to dance in front of Harry. But, after a lot of prompting from Harry, Draco finally copied what Harry was doing, even if it was toned down by a great amount.
“Dead? I don’t think so. He’s still breathing. But, he’s not waking up.” Draco was trying his hardest not to become angry. It was incredibly difficult, when all he could see and think about was red hot anger; angry at himself for not brewing the potion correctly, angry at the world for not letting him have this one victory, and angry at the Figure for foreseeing his failure, somehow.
“Potter- uh. So, I had this dream last night.” Potter looked utterly confused, like he didn’t know why Draco was talking about his dreams when they were in the middle of a crisis. “I was in this weird room, and there was a hooded figure. I couldn’t see his face and he didn’t say anything except for ‘two weeks.’”
The door was a deep forest green, embedded with designs of fairies and magic sparks, and what Draco was sure was some sort of waterfall. It was definitely a special door that led to a special room of some sort. Draco itched to turn the handle and waltz inside, but he knew it wouldn’t be safe to do so. It could be a trap.
He tried to sit up quickly, to show that he really was fine, but it didn’t quite work out. Instead, he banged his head against the wall, making everything blurry again, and was promptly knocked out, meeting darkness once more.
“Draco, Draco I’m right here. I got you,” said someone. That someone sounded pretty upset, like they were choking on tears.
“Yeah, but that was for all the horrible stuff I have personally done to you, or done indirectly to you, or whatever. Over the past two weeks you’ve apologized to me for things you literally had no control over, which is noble of you, I guess, but still.” Draco shrugged.
When Draco got dressed, he was feeling extra bold and decided to wear a Muggle themed outfit: jeans and a jumper. He contemplated changing a dozen times while admiring his outfit in the mirror, and after a lot of self pep-talks, he walked out of the bathroom sort of confidently in his Muggle attire.
“I trusted you, Alec! I thought we were friends!” Harry half-shouted. “Seems like I put my trust in two people who didn’t deserve it.”
This time around, this kiss was anything but delicate. It was filled with so much want; all that frustration of being apart from each other for so long put into the kiss.
Draco shared a room with Blaise, Theo, and two other Slytherin’s named Jorah Davis and Calder Robins. They were the only Slytherin boys who had returned as Eighth Years. The girls consisted of Pansy, Daphne Greengrass, Milicent Bulstrode, and Jorah’s twin sister, Tracey.
But now that there were people filling the hallways to the brim again, he felt like he wasn’t allowed to look at people. He didn’t want Harry to know that, though.
He walked over to where Potter was still standing, facing a shelf that Draco was sure had a chair sitting in front of it at one point.
“I’m guessing this counter-spell was not strong enough. The witch or wizard who cast this barrier probably made sure it couldn't be broken by some first year spell. Besides, if we get the potion done in the right amount of time, and wake everyone up, the adults can work it out,” Potter reassured.
“Young man, you are extremely underweight. Let me get some food in you,” She scolded. Draco did not argue, even though it was getting pretty late at night and wasn’t anywhere near dinner time.
“Draco! Happy birthday!” She squealed. “So, what do you think?” She used her free hand to gesture at the grand space that could probably rival Malfoy Manor’s ballroom.
He then shook his head and faced forward again, continuing the walk to transfigurations with Draco following close behind, fingernails digging into his palms.
When Draco was a child, his father would tell him, “Always be brave. Always stand up for yourself. Look your opponent in the eye, and show them
“Yes, of course. Anything, my dear.” Her smile was beautiful. He hoped she kept her smile in a minute.
He was glad they hadn’t gotten into an argument. He weirdly found that having civil conversations with Potter were much more enjoyable than arguing.
“What do you mean?” Draco wasn’t mad at Harry. He actually felt more affection towards him at the thought that Harry wanted to make sure Draco was safe and okay.
Just as he was ready to start casting the same spells he’d already said over and over again until one of them stuck, a charm came to mind. One he knew that if cast with the right emotion or strength, it would work wonders.
Once Harry’s shirt was fully off, Draco got the opportunity to kiss every inch of his upper half, and made sure that he’d leave marks. His neck was the prime target, where Draco pressed open mouthed, hot kisses on his adams apple, under Harry’s ears, and above his collar bone. Every once in a while he’d lift his head to look at Harry, and it was clear the other man was in pure euphoria, which made Draco grin at the thought that
“Draco, this- this place is amazing!” Harry exclaimed, cutting through Draco’s introspection. Harry had his back to Draco, sticking his hand into the water.
Draco wished their walk to McGonagall’s office would hurry the fuck up. He could feel the students’ curious glances as they passed. And, of course, he didn’t want to talk to Pansy about Harry. At the moment, he didn’t even want to
Draco fell down next to Harry, taking the arm he had just cut and holding it in his hands. He didn’t know much about the human body and the different arteries, but he was pretty sure he’d cut one.
Something must have shifted on his face, indicating he was about to perform some sort of spell, because at that moment Smith and Theo simultaneously shouted
“Now it’s my turn to ask a stupid question,” He said. Draco rolled his eyes and crossed his arms, waiting for Potter’s stupid question. “Why are you wearing robes when you could be wearing much more comfortable clothes? No one else is here. I don’t think you have to abide by the dress code.”
his sleeve wouldn’t ride up because there were others in the room. Which was partly true. But, he knew, deep down, that he didn’t need to wear cufflinks, that he’d be perfectly fine without them, especially with the bandage wrap. And if he could resist the Pull of a dark wizard’s powerful magic, he could do this.
There were two people sitting on the sofa near a contraption that flashed moving pictures and contained people talking. The two people, man and women, about maybe thirty, were leaning against each other, under a blanket. The moment felt so intimate, Draco had to look away. He stared at the giant windows letting in the night sky instead.
“I trust you. Or, I’m beginning to learn to trust you. I would like to believe you wouldn’t lie to me, especially when we’re the only two people around,” Potter said.
Draco had been wondering and fearing who it could possibly be for the last two weeks, and especially today, as it was the day the Figure had said he would basically infiltrate Hogwarts.
How could things become more confusing as he found out more answers? Logically, it didn’t make sense.
McGonagall had taken it upon herself to check in on him, make sure he wasn’t too overwhelmed with the attention. His response to that had been a lie. In reality, he was both overwhelmed and happy, however that might work.
He could explain everything to Theo after he found Harry and glued him to his side so Harry wasn’t able to walk away again.
Hopefully this chapter wasn't too boring, this was originally going to be the last chapter before the epilogue but that definitely didn't happen. I know everyone is going to love the next chapter though; you guys will be happy.
Draco wanted to break something. He’d never felt more furious in his entire life. They had wasted a whole entire week brewing the Restorative Potion based off of the instructions out of a
Waking up felt like a full lake of ice water to the head; cold and severely unpleasant. He wasn’t sure where he was- everything was distorted. He didn’t feel like opening his eyes, for fear of facing more cold unpleasantness.
In the end, it did turn out that Draco had wasted their precious, limited time. Was he surprised that had happened? Honestly, not really.
“I just mean, you never talk. You never interact with other people, besides Parkinson. You haven’t given the chance to show literally anyone you’ve changed.”
But what Harry said, what came out of his mouth, untangled any leftover doubts inside of Draco, and set them free for good.
“It’s really nothing- I just- I wanted you to have this.” Harry held out his hand, the chain and red diamond shaped piece gleaming up at him. “I found this gem at one of my lowest points last summer. I picked it up from outside the Weasley’s and kept it in my pocket until I found this chain lying around. So, then I turned it into a sort of necklace, so I would never be without it. It’s been a reminder to me after all this time, there’s always something new, awaiting to be discovered, even in the darkest of times.”
Harry was frowning. “Don’t think about that. Just- what’s your dream job? Anything you’ve had your mind on?”
He wanted to tell him how this was the best gift he could have ever received, that this was all he’d ever wanted, but he didn’t want to ruin their moment with a mushy heart-to-heart.
“Weren’t you the one to suggest we look in books to solve this curse?” Potter smirked, and Draco felt a little bit of Potter’s happy and hopeful self return back to him.
He also briefly explained his stay in Azkaban, and how horrible that experience had been, even with the Dementors gone. It was tough, reminiscing on one of his most dreadful and humiliating moments, but Harry was there to comfort him, and tell him that he didn’t need to look back on it if he didn’t want to. Draco had shaken him off and explained he needed to talk about it with someone, and Harry was the only someone he would do it with.
In Draco’s youth, he had always believed Lucius would never break his own rule. He was the one who came up with it. But when he actually saw with his own eyes his father withering under the Dark Lord’s stare, Draco wasn’t the least bit surprised seeing Lucius infringe upon the guideline. It honestly, (and Draco felt awful for thinking this), made Draco feel better about himself. It somehow made up for the times he had gone against what his father told him. It didn’t exactly make sense why it did, but it did.
Elizabeth then voiced Draco’s thoughts, and for a moment he believed she used Legilimency on him. “I know it’s a silly question. Of course everyone has felt guilt. Especially after the events you all have experienced in the war. I’m here to tell you, it’s okay. It’s normal to feel guilt, like the weight of the world is on your shoulders.”
Harry stepped right in front of Draco. There was barely any space between them now, and Draco held his breath.
All too quickly, Harry pulled back and smiled with both his mouth and eyes. “Does that answer your question?”
Theo continued, while Robin’s menacing figure stood slightly behind him. “I can’t even fathom which one of these stories is true. Except, you know, the ones where people are calling you a ‘hero’ and whatever fucked up shit goes along those lines. Those are so obviously not true, I laugh every time I hear someone say it!”
While he had been watching Potter cast spell after spell for the past hour, and his Mark had burned away, probably grinning up at him from his arm- blistering in the pain and self-loathing that washed over him, he thought he might possibly have a way to find out more about the Dark Mark.
Draco hated when Harry gave him that look. He tried to ignore the pulling in his heart whenever Harry gave him that incredibly disbelieving and I-know-you’re-hiding-something look, but it became increasingly hard to ignore the more he saw it.
Draco almost recoiled. He wondered why Harry was allowing Draco to hold him the way that he was, when Harry was still angry at him. He started to move his arms back to his side, when Harry grabbed his wrist, a silent plead not to be left alone. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry even tighter.
Turning back and walking towards Drys, Draco said: “You said you’d tell me everything about your little plan.”
“Give me one minute, though. Please,” Draco said, wanting to talk to Harry before he entered a duel that would probably lead to Harry getting killed.
“It’s not that,” Draco said. “It’s just--” he choked on his words. And then his words left him all together. He didn’t know what to say to Harry.
Everyone else was standing in the room, too shocked to do anything. Even Blaise looked surprised at his action.
“I’m sorry,” he blurted out, stepping away. “I’m so, so sorry, Harry. I--” He turned directions and headed to the back door. He needed to get away badly. He knew Harry wouldn’t follow him, and when he turned around for a split second just to check, this was confirmed.
Finally, when he felt her wrapping the new bandage around his forearm and cast a healing spell on it, he turned his head and looked at Pomfrey who was now gathering her things.
McGonagall finished speaking, and she walked up to Draco, looking down at him with a smile. “Welcome back, Draco.”
He was engulfed in darkness once again, and then he was standing at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, facing the real life Drys.
“So, we’ve checked every place now. I think it’s safe to say we are the only ones awake.” Potter said as the two of them started walking back towards the entrance of Hogsmeade.
“I’m-” Draco was starting to get aggravated. The room was starting to fill with hot air. Everything was spinning and there was nothing he could do to stop it. He closed his eyes, willing himself to calm down.
“Yeah, yeah, where’s Harry?” Harry was the only thing he could think about. He hoped Pansy had invited him, or else this night would be even worse than it already was.
Two Death Eaters standing behind the one in the front grabbed Drys by his arms, while the rest of the group trampled through the house, working smoothly and without any sort of hesitation. There were three Death Eaters who stayed out in front of the house, though, in a clump and talking to one another.
He was too focused on the fact that he might be going to Azkaban. Sure, they would learn all about Drys’ evil plan and how Draco was trying to stop what Drys had been planning, but in the end, just like the Aurors had told him, he had killed someone. He had killed Drys. He was officially a murderer.
“Mate, he’ll be fine,” Draco overheard someone whining. “Can we just go in now? I’m bloody starving!”
” Draco cast as he slightly lifted his palm from the cut. The blood surrounding the cut, but not coming from the cut, disappeared, and so did the blood that had ended up on Draco’s hands. It was a stupid spell to cast, though, since a new wave of blood came pouring out.
“Fine,” Harry said, tugging Drys’ journal into his bag. He took Draco’s hand in his, and not for the first time, Draco marveled at how they fit together perfectly. “Soon enough, we’ll have our own Garden of Mystics.”
“Please call him Draco, Alec. And it’s okay, he gets a pass today.” She smiled at him, a real genuine smile, and Draco thought he could hug her right now.
“We can finish this chat at another time. We need to start brewing the cure. Like now,” Draco said hastily as he gathered up his belongings, getting ready to make the trip to the potions classroom.
Draco wasn’t going to ask Potter about his nightmare. He knew Potter would have asked Draco had the situation been switched, but Draco wasn’t the type of person to ask such personal questions that would lead to heartfelt and emotional answers. Potter definitely was that type of person.
Draco choked on nothing as he took in Harry’s words. “Damn. Okay. That’s something I never would have expected. You’re as Gryffindor as they come.”
“Wow, no kidding,” Draco responded with what he hoped was a substantial amount of sarcasm, to try and get some sort of reaction out of Potter. Anything other than the sad, emotionless statue of a man that was standing before him.
“So that’s when I started experimenting on his book, using spells and potions to try and break whatever enchantments that only allowed you to ask three questions. It took lots of trials, but I did it; I broke the enchantment, and all the knowledge in the world was at my fingertips, and all I needed to do was ask it what I wanted to know, and it delivered. Every time.”
The next song that came on was another slow song, and they both didn’t seem to mind. They stayed pressed against each other, swaying slowly to the song.
“I had of course heard of Severus Snape during my school days,” Drys said, “and I know he had the same natural fondness for creating spells, but I’d never known he had created a book that held all of the Wizarding World's known secrets! It was certainly better than
“It’s Drys Kaspian. Alec’s father. The one whose name is engraved on the entrance to the Garden,” Harry said, though he wasn’t whispering. The Figure-
Pansy started rubbing his arm carefully and said in a soft voice, “It’s all going to be okay.” Although, the remorse laced in her words said otherwise.
Then he was alone. Standing in the middle of his party, probably looking like a complete loser. He could go find Pansy or Blaise and Greg again, but he found he didn’t have the energy to hold a conversation with anyone. Except Harry.
But Harry surprised him, not for the first time. “How could I forget? You told me about this type of flower the first day of all this. The day I woke up and no one else was awake, no one else responsive or moving.” Harry was now standing next to Draco, their bodies touching. “That was, everyone but you.”
Draco let out a breath he hadn’t known he’d been holding. He looked over at Potter, who had stumbled over to where Weasley, Granger, Longbottom, Thomas, and Finnigan were sitting in the middle of the room. Everyone else in the room was finally quieting down from their fit of laughter.
I still have the other part of the Wizarding World to guide. Sure, of course I’d rather have all of the Wizarding World, but waking everyone up from the curse isn’t a huge problem of mine.”
Snape’s mystical book sat at the foot of the Gryffindor bed, along with his wand, necklace, and photograph. He grabbed three of the items and stuffed them deep into the pocket of his robe, and hooked the chain clumsily around his neck, not bothering to tuck the gem under his shirt.
Sighing, Draco made his way over to Harry, who was across the library and staring brightly at a battered book in his hand.
He had to tell Potter what had just transpired. He was worried that if he didn’t speak of what the figure had told him, he would forget everything.
Harry had stolen the blankets some time during the night, and he was wrapped up all cozily in them, his leg and arm splayed on Draco in an uncomfortable position. Draco found he was freezing, and mentally berated Harry.
Draco asked himself when it had become easier to talk about the war, and his trial, with Harry. Sure, he still felt uncomfortable and had a desire to flee from the conversation, but the way Harry was looking at him made him feel safe. It made him feel like Harry understood everything he said and related to it, even though he didn’t.
“C’mon, Harry. I can’t lose you,” Draco spoke, “I can’t lose you. You’re the best part of me. You make my life whole, and without you in my life-”
to tell the whole class he was stuck in a closet. He couldn’t have just made up a fake story as to why Draco was late? No. Of course not.
“Draco, is there anything else you wish to tell us?” Dumbledore asked politely. He had this knowing look that Draco hated.
Harry lifted an eyebrow. “Why would I be kidding. You don’t want to talk to me! What did I do wrong?”
“Well to answer your question, Albus and I have a protection charm placed on our portraits. No curse or hex or any means of dark magic can harm us. Others encased in frames are not so lucky.” Snape turned his head to look at his neighboring portraits; all sound asleep. “We were curious as to what exactly was going on. When we found out we couldn’t move to other portraits inside the castle or out, we knew something was terribly wrong. When Minerva hadn’t arrived at her office for days, our suspicions were mostly confirmed.” Snape returned his gaze back to Draco. “But thank you for coming in here, Draco. Even though our worst intuitions are now confirmed, I am glad we now know what exactly is going on out in the world.” There was the faintest of smiles on Snape’s face.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief. “Merlin, Pansy, you are a lifesaver. You just got me out of the most awkward conversation.”
Draco caught up with Potter, and he realized he was still slightly out of breath. He tried to breathe normally, but that somehow made everything worse. He stumbled a little and then doubled over, knees hitting the ground, one hand clutching the grass under the snow and the other clutching his chest.
They had gone skipping away, huge grins plastered on their faces and squeaky giggles pouring not so discreetly from their mouths. Draco had
to stop resisting the pull of the Mark, and let all of your worries and emotions wash away; watching Harry die while not having to suffer. Of course, the outcome of these two options will still be the same; I’ll have to turn you over to the Ministry and blame every death on you, but wouldn’t you rather give in for the last day of your life? Wouldn’t you rather not suffer while you watch Harry Potter die?”
“It’s on.” Only, the song that had been currently playing died down, and was replaced with an exceedingly slow song. That didn’t seem to have any words. And did he mention it was exceedingly slow?
Harry shrugged. “I feel like spending six years in Gryffindor made me more… well, Gryffindor. But at heart I’m a Slytherin.”
Potter looked startled at the question. “Uh, no. It has never hurt in any way ever since Voldemort died. Why?”
“But, since you foolishly declined, you’ll suffer greatly. And after I’ve had you watch Potter, your parents, and your one minuscule friend- Miss Parkinson- all die, I’ll give you to the Ministry, telling them it’s all your fault for the slow death of everyone at Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, and the slaughter of the Purebloods in Hogwarts. along with Harry Potter’s death. I’ll let them deal with you, and I’ll be the savior, turning in the evil villain. After that, they’ll have to love me and follow me. They’ll be even more willing to back me up on the death of all of the other Purebloods in the Wizarding World, because they'll see how the world has benefitted from them not being around.
Draco loved Harry so much, he had willingly sacrificed his own life for Harry’s. Harry loved Draco just as much in return, and that love had saved Draco’s life. The mixture of their feelings and Draco’s action moments before
When he had come to the only broom closet he knew of on the seventh floor, and had spotted no one around, that had only reassured him it was a trap. So, annoyed with his own overflowing sense of curiosity, and wanting to leave as soon as possible, he had turned himself around and was about to walk away and start his journey towards Transfigurations when he heard a door slam open.
“Thanks,” Potter took a deep breath, “Here we go. I’m not exactly sure if this counts as a secret, but we’ll see.” Draco waited in anticipation as Potter took a couple more breaths. “I’m not okay.” Draco wanted to laugh at how
Draco was suddenly filled with a load of endearment for Potter. Pansy was the only other person who had ever said similar words to him, and it meant a lot coming from Potter, of all people. Someone who he would have never thought in a million years would know he was gay.
“Are you really asking me this right now?” Draco was absolutely incredulous. “I’m trying to sleep, for your information.”
confessing to someone you were attacked because people despise you, and for good reason. “A group of students attacked me last night.” He continued to look down. He guessed she already knew what had happened, Madame Pomfrey probably told McGonagall what he told her, so why did she have to interrogate him when she already knew the gist? Okay, yeah, she was the Headmistress and wanted to make sure her students were safe and healthy, but he wasn’t worth her time.
Harry’s expression softened the smallest bit. If Draco hadn’t been studying every last inch of Harry’s face, he wouldn’t have been able to see it. “I don’t know what I am, honestly. Mostly confused, I guess.”
and placed it in front of him, turning some knobs and licking his lips as he worked intently on trying to get the Muggle invention to work. Why did it have to be licking his lips, Draco thought sourly, why couldn’t he have had some other habit that didn’t make Draco hard.
He casually stepped into the room, keeping his eyes locked on his destination: his bed and the small area surrounding. Immediately, the voices quieted down and a couple coughs floated through the air.
Draco brought his volume down an octave, but he was still the same level of ticked off. “Here’s what we’re going to do. I’m going to come out of this bathroom in a couple minutes, you’re going to leave me alone, and we’re going to sleep.”
Madame Pomfrey hastily stepped out of her office at the sound of the door opening, and her expression showed that she was most certainly not happy to see visitors at this hour.
He pressed on. “I’m not sure if there’s a blatant way of telling you why I’ve been avoiding you, but I’ll try my best to explain.”
Draco absently played with the gem at his throat, thinking about the possibility of having a secret room just for the two of them, like the Garden. It was a truly amazing prospect, and Harry was right; they were more than capable of fulfilling it.
Harry led the way into the room, and settled at a spot directly in front of the fountain, setting down the basket and the black box thing that was possibly called a radish. The word didn’t seem entirely correct, but he felt it was close enough.
“I realized then,” Harry continued on, as if Draco hadn’t just stuttered through a sentence. “That you were-
Drys and Alec were taken outside the house after that and then whisked away, the other Death Eaters Apparating away from the house. But, before they all left, some stayed behind to light the place on fire, also using curses to break the windows and other valuables.
Once he made his way to the back of the library, standing in front of the large windows, his suspicions about what had been making the noise was confirmed. The same eagle owl that Draco had sent to Azkaban to deliver a letter about a week ago was flying in place right in front of Draco’s face, and he carefully opened up the window to let it in.
“No. Well, he sort of talked. It looked like it was taking a lot of effort for him to speak. He said he didn’t want to come here, and that he could just go back to his dormitory to heal the rest of his injuries.”
Draco had spent many days in the Great Hall staring at the Gryffindor table, watching Harry be there, but not
“Well then, I’ll talk to her as soon as possible,” the Headmistress said. “I will send my owl with more information regarding sessions at a later time. Hopefully in the next couple days.”
Draco groaned. The thought of Harry, barely able to walk, let alone carry another person’s weight, hike up to Hogwarts in the middle of a harsh rain storm was absolutely dreadful. Especially after witnessing Drys’ death, and what Harry surely thought was Draco’s death.
“Speaking of the Weasleys, what happened to you and… girl Weasley?” Draco asked, not wanting to think about how he would never find happiness any longer.
After their time spent together in the kitchen, everything went downhill. Draco had known after their shared moment that they could never be together, in a relationship or just as friends. Things were just too different now that the Curse was over, and normal life was settling around them once more.
This chapter was originally going to be 10k+ words long, but then I realized I should just cut the chapter in half, since I've been working on it for about 3 weeks and still am not close to being done. So, basically, here's part 1, and I'll hopefully finish the *better* half soon. Sorry for the long wait!
It was a different sort of silence than the one Potter had given him that morning, when he was mad at Draco for wasting their Thursday.
“Yes. Sorry, I accidentally knocked something over. I can clean it up though,” Potter said as he took out his wand. He cast a spell under his breath that Draco couldn’t make out, and the mess on the floor vanished.
“Yes. After everything that had happened with you and Mr. Potter, the Ministry and I have discussed some terms of your probation that need to be readjusted.”
“But, if you really mean it, I’ll go. I’ll give you some space, and I won’t come back. It’s up to you.” Harry dropped Draco’s hand, and his hand felt so cold; it wasn’t due to the freezing temperature outside. Harry started to rise up from his seated position next to Draco, but he caught Harry’s arm before Harry could get far.
but he was weak. His anxiety about every last detail of his life clouded his mind, and his breathing came up short. He could tell that Harry was even more concerned for him than before.
Last night? From the large windows in the room, Draco could obviously see it was dark out, which meant it was Saturday night, and he’d been sleeping all day. What a bloody waste of a day. He could have been doing way more interesting activities were he not attacked… like reading, or studying…
Potter slightly frowned at Draco, and moved aside, notifying for Draco to go ahead into the office first.
Draco checked the time using his wand, not for the first time in the last ten minutes, and saw that it was finally eight o’clock. He perked up, and lightly tossed his book on a table as he walked over to Harry. “Are you ready?” He didn’t have to explain to Harry what he meant.
“We don’t know why it’s up. But, I feel like that’s honestly a pretty good guess. It’s strange that this happened on the same day we find out everyone in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade is under some sort of spell.”
“We’re just confused, is all,” McGonagall cut in. “I know there is more to the story. We would just like to see your side before we jump to conclusions.” At the last part, she glared again at the Auror.
Potter shifted on his feet a bit, but didn’t say anything. He looked very uncomfortable and out of place. Instead, he raked his hand, the one that wasn’t still latched onto Draco’s wrist, through his already messy hair.
An Auror who Draco had never seen before started walking towards Draco, joining Pomfrey on the left side of the bed. Pomfrey gave the man a stern look while Draco calmed his breathing.
The next thing Draco knew, a slow hum of a song was starting to play out of the radio. As the song started to progress, Draco noticed that it was quite different from songs made in the Wizarding World, but he also noticed he was enjoying the song. His foot was tapping along to the beat, and he scowled at his foot for betraying him. Harry caught Draco’s scowl, and smiled, while starting to dance on his own.
Whoever praised optimism was a right foul tosser, for the sole fact that the idea ‘if you think things are going to go precisely how you want them to go, then they will’, was right. Which was so far from right Draco didn’t even know where to start.
Elizabeth laughed too. “Yes, very good, Harry. Now, to start off our session today, I would like to talk about guilt. Who here has ever felt guilty?”
It was becoming so tiring, staring at a spot on the map, that Draco heavily considered trudging over to Slytherin and shaking Theo until he woke. In hindsight, it was a good plan.
“When did you write this?” Harry asked, annoyance and pain seeping into his voice. “When did you get the response? And how on Earth did you surpass the ward that's keeping us locked in?”
“H- hello, Professor,” Draco finally managed to spit out. He couldn't make eye-contact with Dumbledore, so he just settled for looking at the blank patch of wall between the two former headmaster’s portraits.
“It's from my mother, I’m guessing, from the crest on the front. My father obviously wouldn’t be writing to me from Azkaban.”
“No. I’m sure Voldemort is dead. But I’m also confused about one other thing. If you sent a letter to your father, why didn’t you also send a letter of distress to the Ministry or something? Don’t you want us to have help?”
Draco was abruptly awoken by someone shaking his shoulders violently. Someone who smelled like fire whiskey and strong perfume.
“Malfoy, I don’t think Snape would lie to you, do you? If we have to share an extremely personal secret, so be it. I think it will be worth sharing if it means we’ll get an answer on how to solve the curse.”
Once back inside the library, Potter started back up his practice with defensive spells. He had not wanted to try and learn the Deletrius charm, but Draco convinced him he should practice casting it a little while longer, since he had already worked on it for a good amount of time.
He had his wand in his hand, (even though he could not cast any spells to harm others- thanks to his probation restrictions), but he could cast a shield protection charm around him if he needed to, at the very least.
. I have a blade on me, and I will give you that blade to cut Potter open wherever you like, as long as an ample amount of blood ends up on the blade. You will hand the blade over to me, and your family lives, along with everyone who is currently under the sleeping curse.
Draco tried his hardest not to look at Harry after their time spent in the kitchen, so that was the first time he’d truly seen him. Draco’s breath caught in his throat and his whole body stilled.
“Right. Well, we’ll finish this conversation tomorrow, Mr. Malfoy. Have a good night.” With that last statement, she crossed the room to the doors, passing Granger, Weasley, and Potter who were awkwardly standing in the middle of the room, nodding to them as she passed, and left.
Butterflies filled his stomach and the warmest feeling imaginable encased Draco as he stared at the back of Harry’s head. He was right there.
Through his shame, Draco felt something else surge through him; panic. He didn’t know of any spells to repair clothing. He would have to walk through the halls of Hogwarts, with his Mark out for everyone to see. This was probably what they wanted to happen to Draco. They knew causing Draco pain in the form of curses wasn’t enough, they had to tap into Draco’s self loathing to make him really suffer. Even if he clutched his arm tightly to chest, people would know. They would think things, and they would cast him vicious glares. Everyone, save for a couple First Years, knew what he was.
Sorry this chapter is like extremely boring and nothing really interesting happens until the very end.
Thanks to his probation, he was under the watchful eye of Minerva McGonagall. If he ever wanted to leave Hogwarts to go down to Hogsmeade, he’d have to ask for permission from her, which he was dreadfully scared to do.
He scrubbed his cold hands across his face. He’d been so fucking stupid the past two weeks. He’d had so many opportunities to seek help, and he blew them all. His time was up. Tomorrow was Sunday.
“I felt the same exact way, the first day the curse started,” Draco said, “And I’m also glad I got to know you better too. And let me tell you, Harry, you’re not alone. You’ll never be alone. Whatever happens tomorrow, I’ll be by your side. As well as all the days after that.”
“It’s just, I know we’re not exactly friends. But if there’s something else Snape said, or you had another one of your visions, or you found- I don’t know, a secret room somewhere that could possibly help us out, you’d tell me, right?” Potter looked directly at him. His eyes huge behind his glasses and his eyebrows furrowed.
Things were messy, between him and Harry--not always perfect. They still had some aspects to mend and some subjects to talk through. They still had plenty of trauma to heal and sleepless nights that left them dead on their feet. They were still early on in their relationship.
Draco had no clue what to do with himself ever since he’d come to the realization that he fancied Harry. Granted, it was a lot to take in, especially when he had a million other things to deal with.
It was still so awkward, and the worst part was that Draco knew it was his own fault. Harry looked like he was full to bursting with words, but seemed shy to speak up because of Draco being so obviously not in the talkative mood. It was hard to answer
“He didn’t want to be seen while trying to capture me: for whatever reason, I don’t know, but when I was on his trail, he left the Slytherin tie for me to find and keep me off of his tracks; for me to think it was a Slytherin who was awake. I guess he thought his cover was blown since he had made noises and I’d obviously known that I was not alone anymore. Then, I'm guessing he hid in Slughorn’s office, which was the last place I heard a noise and searched for him before I bolted off to go and search for you, Harry.
“Alright everyone, I hope you have a fantastic week! See you next Friday, same time, same place,” Elizabeth announced at the end of their hour.
. But maybe it had been a part of his dream? He pulled up his sleeve to check once again, and much to his dismay, it was still moving, the color a deep black. His breath caught in his throat, and his mind instantly thought of sixth and seventh year when the Mark moved constantly, and burned terribly when the Dark Lord summoned him. He still couldn’t believe that the horrid tattoo was moving again. It was the worst sight Draco could ever lay his eyes upon.
to warn Draco not to send another letter.  Also, Draco already explained that overall he’d been too fucking scared, and telling Harry about his Mark was not something he’d wanted to do.
Draco was wide-eyed as he looked from Snape to the book still clutched in his hand. “How does it know how many people are around it though? This doesn’t make sense. Why can’t you have just made it easy.”
They started walking along the path once again, keeping their pace slow. Except this time Draco felt that something had changed. Some line had been crossed, between the two of them. The tension that was there before, was gone. The walk back to the castle was filled with comfortable silence this time, only broken by Potter almost slipping on a patch of ice and Draco laughing hysterically at him.
Draco wanted to tell Potter to go on without him, but he knew Potter wouldn’t allow that, as a result of his weird paranoia that some shit was going to happen to either of them if they were separated.
Draco could tell Potter’s optimism was wearing down, and that made the small ounce of his own optimism wither away completely.
The sides of his vision grew blurry, and with that came the shortness of breath, and the shaky, sweaty feeling. He hated Aurors and he hated Azkaban. He’d said to himself he’d never do anything that would lead to him stepping foot in that wretched place again. He wanted to know what had happened, and why he was thrown into a situation that involved fucking Aurors.
Day four of trying to save the world started off just like day three. Literally exactly the same. Draco woke up with no visions that night. Potter had no nightmares. They took showers, got dressed, and ate breakfast in the Room of Requirement before making their pit stop to the Gryffindor and Slytherin common rooms, where they observed no one had moved a muscle. The discovery had been outstandingly shocking.
“Kaspian,” He and Harry both said at the same time. Draco with intense dislike, and Harry with no emotion at all- maybe a tiny hint of surprise.
He had always been scared of her. She was a powerful woman. He knew she didn’t like him very much, which made sense, he had been a down right pain in the arse during his younger years at Hogwarts. But, he was very grateful she let him return this year to Hogwarts. He could very well be at the manor right now, finishing out his probation there.
Draco sat in Potions with his head down on the table. He was so tired, he had barely gotten any sleep the night before.
Clearing his throat, Draco said with astonishment clear in his tone, “Thank you, Headmistress. Thank you so much.”
After searching all his pockets, Harry had collected a handful of things, and set them down carefully on top of the table in front of them both.
Draco glanced at Alec, his face stuck in a tight scowl. He then moved his gaze to Drys, who was so tall and scary, yet nothing even comparable to the Dark Lord. He wished he could look at Harry. He wanted to know what Harry was thinking about all of this, and how he was dealing with the knowledge that Draco had the power to either mar Harry, or let him die.
He tried to sit up, but was immediately hit with a burst of pain, coming from pretty much everywhere.
Maybe he and Harry were each other’s sophrosyne. Maybe he and Harry led to each other’s true happiness and self awareness.
was the strangest concept to grasp. They had been friends for some time now, Draco knew, likely for about a week or so. But Harry had flat out said that whatever had been cultivating between them for days and days was utterly, simply, friendship.
Blood was spurting out incredibly fast, and every second he wasted, Harry was more at risk of… becoming seriously damaged. Not dead. Death wasn’t even in the cards for Harry, because Draco would make things right, and if anybody was fated to die, it would be
Of course, there was the small problem of distributing the potion out to everyone in the school, along with the small problem of how exactly they were supposed to distribute it; they weren’t sure if it was done by a certain spell, or if they had to walk around to every single person in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, opening people’s mouths and forcing the liquid down their throats.
Draco hadn’t really thought of anything else he wanted to say, but now that Dumbledore mentioned it, he did want to mention to Snape that his Mark had started moving again. He knew Snape would understand how he was feeling, seeing it come alive again; he also had the cursed tattoo. He wondered whether Snape's portrait had the Mark. Probably. He wanted to ask if his scar had started moving again too, but he didn’t want to ask in front of Dumbledore.
“So, is there some sort of protective charm on it?” Draco asked, resting his chin on Harry’s shoulder while peering at the journal.
He couldn’t look Harry in the eyes; he knew he'd been too abrupt. For Salazar’s sake, they only reconciled with each other last night!
He didn’t know why his brain filled up with stupid thoughts like those. It was a waste of space. But he couldn’t keep them from coming. He was filled up with way too much hope.
While still dancing, Harry took his wand out, and pointed it at the radio, which made the song even louder.
He wanted to rip both of his Professors letters in half, along with his exam. He wanted to sit against a wall and wrap his arms around his legs, while he tried to disappear from existence. He wanted life to not be so fucking hard and awful all the time. He wanted to be good.
Harry had always been going on about all the different spells Alec had taught him, like the one with the radio and the one with the photographs. He used to feel jealous of Alec, having spent so much time with Harry, but now he felt anger towards him, knowing that all along Alec had been working on some evil plan with his father.
have not done anything.” He turned his head to the side, almost like he was looking for something in specific. “He’s simply under the body binding curse.”
“I just-” Harry was back to standing at Draco’s side, except this time, their eyes were locked and Harry was closer than ever. Was this the moment where they would kiss? Draco wasn’t prepared for a kiss. Not yet at least. He wished Harry would have given him some warning or… “I thought this would look pretty in your hair.”
Pansy moved out of the way, but Draco wished she hadn’t. Pansy’s presence always somehow made him feel more confident.
Draco did as Harry said, and somehow, they were even closer than before. Draco’s cheek was touching Harry’s cheek, and the contact was bloody amazing. Draco felt giddy knowing he would have a photograph any minute now of the two of them in close proximity.
He heard a couple more voices and noises, lots of shuffling around, and then he felt a cool substance flowing down his throat.
Pomfrey looked like she wanted to say something else, but opted out of it, grabbing the last of her things and levitating some behind her that would not fit in her arms.
They had guessed that they needed to make their way to Slughorn’s room when Snape’s book started ominously glowing. It had made sense, since last Friday night they had finished brewing the Restorative Potion around ten, which now made it exactly seven days since when they had started the potion. It was finally time to test it out, and see if it worked, returning everyone back to their normal state.
Draco was still making his way towards the Defense classroom when he felt a hand wrap around his wrist. His
Draco didn’t respond, and Harry didn’t say anything else. The silence was comfortable, although he longed for the warmth of Harry at his side.
When they both arrived at Hogwarts’ front entrance, Potter and him turned to each other. Potter stuffed his hands into his trouser pockets, and Draco crossed his arms.
Everyone watched in awe as she strode through the room, right up to the Aurors. She began whispering rapidly to them, her eyes dark and her lips firm.
and not having the courage to properly thank Harry, and maybe apologize to him for everything at the same time.
Right as Harry was about to lunge for the book, he tucked his wand away, and that was all the distraction Draco needed. He sidestepped his way, passed Harry, and bolted through the library, heading out the doors.
“I’m sorry,” Potter said across the table from Draco. Draco rolled his eyes and was about to open his mouth when Potter cut him off. “Before you say anything, I’m apologizing for what’s to come. If we’re going to be sleeping in the same room every night together, you should know that I have pretty bad nightmares. Sometimes I wake up Ron and everyone else in my dorm, and I know it annoys them even though they say otherwise. But, yeah. I just thought I should tell you.”
“Oh,” Greg said as he took a sip from his drink, “He’s over there, with Granger and Weasley.” He pointed to the middle of the room.
Both Blaise and Pansy laughed. “Not even in the slightest, Draco,” Pansy replied. “At least not anymore.”
Working up a bit of courage he had somewhere deep down inside of him, Draco finally said, after finishing chewing his bite of roast beef; “How have your classes been? You know-- since you got back.”
“Oh, um, Alec taught me them. He also introduced me to rock music and pop music, and well, lots of genres of music,” Harry answered, now pointing his wand at the radio and muttering some charm.
“Look, I won’t be long, I just want to see how Draco’s doing,” Pansy said impatiently. From behind her, Draco could see Granger nod her head in agreement, while Weasley was staring at his feet, and Potter seemed to have no clue where to look.
They arrived at the Slytherin common room and flopped down on one of the couches. Draco took out his homework for potions and started to work on it while Pansy took out a magazine and flipped through the pages, only stopping to look at the fit models. He really did wonder why Pansy still hung out with him, when she could choose to spend her time with Theo, or Blaise who she so desperately loved, and yet she chose his company to theirs. The thought made his insides all warm. Even though she was annoying most of the time, and got on his nerves frequently, he was glad they were friends.
Draco sniffed and tried to look away, but Harry’s eyes just wouldn’t let him move. “It represents the very thing you fought to destroy. It represents how we were on completely opposite sides. It’s
His heart clenched at her words, and he could sense that his eyes were starting to get watery. He still needed to say something to her, though. Something that was going to take every ounce of courage in his body to say.
“This is just all so surreal,” Draco murmured. “I mean, this year, this cursed year-- I would never have thought something like this could happen to a person like me. I always had Pansy, but you, Harry, you were different.”
Draco thought that much was obvious. Of course they had to be careful, and make sure that they spoke the right words, not making the book confused as to what they were asking it.
been enough to open the book. At least one good thing came from Draco sharing one of his most precious secrets.
Pansy and Draco sat down next to each other, and Draco clenched his hands in his lap. It was going to be fine. He just had to give simple one word answers when they were asked of him and soon the session would be over before he knew it.
They continued to stare at each other in silence. He was unhappy that they had gone back not knowing what to say to each other.
Draco took a deep breath. “Thank you. Thank you for doing this for me, and for being so kind. Merlin knows I deserve it after- after everything.”
Blaise reached across the table to pat him lightly on the shoulder. “You really need to work things out with Potter, mate.”
He headed back over to the area where Harry was located, and sat down at their usual table, opening the book and reading the table of contents, finding a section on simple spells he should be able to cast without breaking any part of his probation.
There were millions of possibilities that could happen over the next two days, and Draco already knew what he wished one of them would be: for Harry to never stop looking at him like he was now. Eyes full of sweetness and care.
“There is a catch however,” Snape drawled. Draco groaned, because of course there was. “The book only provides you with information that is already out in the world. It cannot create a counter-spell or new kind of charm, it can only find you what already exists.”
He then slowly turned away from the mirror, and started to take off his robes and shirt. He tried his hardest not to look at his left forearm, but it was like his eyes were automatically drawn to it. The Dark Mark was still distinctly apparent on his arm. It had faded slightly, but it was still there.
Harry stiffened, and Draco had to take a deep breath. “No, I didn’t even have to think about it. I would never
His tears were starting to become sparse, from the lack of… whatever produced tears in one’s body. Draco honestly had no clue how tears were made or what they came from, not that he would ever need knowledge about that particular subject in his life.
Draco’s second thought was how awful it was that he’d never even known of someone with the last name Kaspian ever being kept in the Manor’s dungeons. There had been so many people, and Draco had never been good with names and faces. He was sickened to think about how he had forgotten the names of people who his family had held as captives, thinking that they deserved so much better than that.
He had never told McGonagall that people constantly attacked him. She definitely knew, though. From the times he sported a black eye and from bruises that were clearly visible. She had once even come over to where him and Pansy sat in the Great Hall and asked if students were bothering him. Pansy had shot him a look that said, ‘just fucking tell her the truth,’ but Draco had shook his head and told McGonagall that he was fine. The Headmistress had said to tell her if anyone ever did bother him, because no one deserved to be attacked.
Before he could even register what was happening, Harry’s arms were wrapped tightly around him. One of Draco’s most favorite things.
He hoped Potter’s unprecedented walk through the snow helped him clear his head, at the very least. He liked to think the stroll was of some significance.
Draco moved his gaze to his lap for a couple of seconds, trying to ignore Harry’s piercing eyes. “Alright.”
All the Slytherins in the class sat closest to Slughorn's desk, it wasn’t like Draco chose the spot, but he supposed it was better than sitting with any of the other houses. He didn’t have any friends in the class. That meant Pansy wasn’t in NEWT Potions.
Draco didn’t exactly know what he was expecting to find when he came to this broom closet. People wanting him to suffer, surely. He really was just curious, and he didn’t want to have to spend more time alone with Pansy than was needed. He was grateful for a friend though, for someone who actually chose to spend time with him. But, she got rather annoying and bitchy very fast. Especially when it came to meal times. Pansy was always complaining about how thin Draco was, and how he should eat more. He knew she was right. But Draco never liked to admit he was wrong. So he always just snapped at her when she brought it up, and she snapped back. It was like an endless cycle of snarky and ruthless remarks.
“I’m not splitting up from you, Potter. I’m just resting.” Draco informed Potter, who was now walking over to where Draco was seated.
“Well,” Harry said, positively uneasy to be retelling the story, but also not the type of person to back down. “You, uh, fell on top of me. Your body was limp, and your heartbeat stopped. It was… terrifying. Before you interfered, I could tell that Drys had had the killing curse on the tip of his tongue, and I was ready to meet my end. But, you just showed up out of nowhere, right as the curse left his lips. I saw Drys being splashed by some liquid, and then you fell on me, green light filling up every inch of the forest.”
By the end of their tenth listen to the song, they were both completely out of breath, and couldn’t stop laughing, which didn’t help their out of breath problem. They perched on the water fountain, right next to the radio which was now playing a set of random songs that Harry definitely didn’t ask it to play.
Draco felt a wave of hot shame flood throughout his body. Someone, other than Draco, had seen his Mark. Something he vowed to himself would never, ever happen, no matter what.
Draco stood in the center of it all, watching in disbelief as the house became destroyed, turning into the exact version of the one from his visions.
Potter shook his head. “It is weird. And I couldn’t even begin to form an answer for you. I’m just as clueless.”
Draco was not stupid. He knew someone was messing with him. But, he was curious nonetheless, and had time to spare before his next class. He guessed the letter meant for him to go as soon as possible, so after he finished his breakfast consisting only of tea, and had reassured Pansy that he would meet her in Transfigurations in a couple of minutes, he had set off to the seventh floor.
The world felt so cold. Colder than it had been the night before, when it had been snowing. When they had laid in the snow. Together.
It was around ten o’clock on Friday, and Draco and Harry were crowded around the bubbling cauldron filled with the Restorative Potion; Snape’s book propped open in Harry’s hands.
He was definitely moving at a more bearable pace now, so why hadn’t Harry shown up yet? Harry had his stupid map he could use to track Draco down with, and-
“I’m sorry, Draco,” she sighed, “As you said, I’m not that well rounded on curses of any kind, and even the wizards and witches who do study Unforgivables and the like have never found out why Mr. Potter wasn’t killed that fateful night. Your best bet is to talk to Potter himself.”
Draco shot up from his chair and grabbed his belongings. Harry was looking at Pansy with anger and looking at Draco with longing.
Was Harry mad at him? Harry looked mad. Or was Harry afraid of him? Was Harry afraid that Draco was going to almost kill him again? Was he nervous about being in the presence of a murderer? Did he only bring Draco to the House Elves, away from all of the people in the Great Hall, because he pitied him?
Harry’s lips were soft while Draco could feel his were chapped, not that it mattered to Harry. Harry’s own hands replicated Draco’s; one was placed at the nape of Draco’s neck while the other was touching his cheek gently.
Draco had never kissed anyone as lovingly as he was kissing Harry, and he was scared he was doing something wrong. Harry was basically in control, Draco thought he was parting his lips fine, but Harry was most certainly better. Harry’s tongue grazed his teeth and his lips, and Draco tried to do the same to Harry, but he failed miserably, and let Harry do what he was good at.
They’d decided that the Garden of Mystics should be left for Drys and Olive and those two only. But the idea of leaving a mark on Hogwarts, their very own secret room, that students generations from now might happen across, was something Draco and Harry had needed to create.
He was then in the Garden of Mystics with Harry. They were slow dancing again, and there were words floating through the air.
As if the universe could hear his thoughts, Draco heard a soft rapping at what he presumed was one of the far windows of the library, promptly diverting Draco’s attention.
Now Draco was rummaging through his trunk trying to find his set of Slytherin outerwear. If Potter was going to go full on Gryffindor, Draco was sure as hell going to do the same with Slytherin. The house rivalries were stupid now, considering everything that happened with the war; it seemed so childish, but despite everything he still felt Slytherin was the best and had to prove it to ever so Gryffindor Potter.
Granger, with her hair a frizzy mess, tied up in a knot on the top of her head, looking worriedly around the room. He thought that she was trying to look for him, that maybe someone had tipped her off that he was very badly injured in this room. But she didn’t seem to see him, and instead she said to herself, “Where is my bloody quill?”
“Yeah, but we banged on all of the doors. I’m pretty sure someone would have come out to see what the commotion was all about…”
that deep, but the blade could’ve been enchanted or some bullshit, causing more harm than Draco could physically see.
Drys was still not nearly as frightening as the Dark Lord, but somehow learning that the man in the hooded cloak was Alec’s father all along, made everything a bit more real.
Draco didn't even really know why he was still having a conversation with Potter. Let alone a civil conversation. He should be running down the corridors, trying to get to class.
“Yes, Professor,” Draco said shakily. He turned on his feet, and hurriedly stalked out of the office, shutting the door and willing himself not to break down.
. A book that Draco really had no reason to hide, other than to piss Harry off. He then remembered it was because of the stupid cloud of smoke Harry had created.
Before he could stop himself, before Pomfrey could make it back inside her office, Draco said warily; “Madame Pomfrey?”
He was more than content, he was in love, he was really in love with Harry, and Harry was maybe in love with him.
“Oh, yeah, of course. I’d love to,” Draco said, trying to reign in his feelings. Kaspian was asleep. He wasn’t here, and he wouldn’t be here until, well, everyone woke up. Which could be soon. But, who knew when the curse would really be broken. And until it happened, Draco was the one with Harry.
It will probably take me a while to write it, as I have to make sure I've included everything I wanted to include and that I wrapped up the plot in a way where I don't leave people confused, but I promise I'm NOT abandoning this story.
It took him about a week to understand that he, himself, Draco, was the person making him unhappy. He truly was his own worst enemy.
The wall that held the opening to the Slytherin common room came upon them, and Draco said the password to allow them entrance. As he watched the entryway appear before his eyes, he fiddled around in his robe pockets for the vial he had stuffed away.
” which made a large cloud of smoke appear in front of him, and Draco started coughing while swatting away the fumes.
Harry, accompanied by Weasley and Granger, hadn’t so much as batted an eye in their direction. They hadn’t even noticed that he and Pansy were standing pretty close to their little group, listening in on their conversation.
“Oh for- bloody hell, I’ll just grab it myself.” Draco reached across their workspace and grabbed the knotgrass, along with a couple of lacewing flies.
Potter and him continued their search in total silence, not even talking to acknowledge that they had so far found no one else awake. When they had stopped to peer into the window of Honeydukes, Potter eyed all the sweets inside very obviously, and Draco watched as his eyes lit up respectively. There was something about Potter’s child-like demeanor that was consoling.
“Is the day before the sleeping curse happened,” Harry finished, understanding of the situation washing over him.
The rest of the school was in complete shock. The area in front of the Great Hall was in disarray; a clash of chatter and stunned silence filling the air.
But his attention was already somewhere else as he heard a loud banging, the door to the Hospital Wing crashing open and hitting the wall.
Harry how he was so experienced, to which he had responded, “Ginny,” which only made Draco kiss him more.
“Alright, enough about me. Now it’s your turn,” Potter said. Draco noticed Potter was gradually regaining his usual posture and attitude, which he was glad about.
“If you would hold out your own wand, Mr. Malfoy. I need it to undo the spell,” McGonagall said, leaning forward in her seat to be able to reach Draco’s wand.
Before he left the room, Draco made sure to discreetly catch Blaise’s attention and give him a small smile and nod, to which Blaise gave a wry grin in return.
That night, in his room at the manor, he had begun to write a letter to McGonagall, asking if he could attend Hogwarts to redo his Seventh Year, if he got the okay from his probation Auror. She had messaged back the next day, saying that it was absolutely alright, and that she was glad to have him back.
“So, you’re saying, I’m a good person because I reluctantly followed a Dark Lord and wanted to puke every time I was forced to torture someone? Then, yes, I guess I am a great person.” Draco’s tone was bitter, and he was starting to become more angry every single second Harry spoke.
and he was pretty sure he screamed, and then there were reassuring hands and breaths right by his side. Those breaths were there when he needed them most. Although, he couldn’t even begin to guess who it belonged to.
Once Harry had read both letters, Draco took them back and stuffed them away. Harry was keeping silent. Whether that was a good or bad thing, Draco was not sure.
“Incredibly soppy, Draco. I’m sure Parkinson would love to have heard you say that. She would bully you for years about it, I bet.”
struck, was strong enough to keep Draco alive. A sort of reversal on what happened the night Harry’s parents died; on what Lily Potter did to keep her boy safe.
“How about you, you know, take one thing at a time. Focus on the funeral first, or focus on fixing things with Harry. You don’t have to do both.”
“Shut UP!” Draco finally snapped, and for a second he was sure he was about to pull the sink right out of the ground. “Stop being incredibly nosey and mind your own business for once, Potter!”
“I’m perfectly fine, let’s do this.” Draco walked over to the edge of where the slide started, and sat down, willing the slide not to move. Harry followed his lead and sat down next to him. The slide was surely wide enough for the both of them.
“Hey.” Harry rested his hand on Draco’s shoulder once more, and the contact eased some of the anger out of him. “You don’t know that for sure. I know you had those visions, or whatever, and I’m only going off of what you told me, but I honestly don't think Sunday is like an omen of death.”
At the end of class, as Draco stayed behind with Blaise, to wait for everyone to leave the room, Harry approached them, and that time they couldn’t get out fast enough, due to idiotic people taking their sweet old time.
Drys went on. “I hope you boys understand, but I’m now going to have to kill you, Potter. You’re of no use to me now.”
“No?” Harry said questioningly, quirking an eyebrow. His eyes were still squinty due to his lack of glasses.
The kiss was so deep and so slow, Draco felt time had frozen. It was just him and Harry, kissing, hands interlocked, Draco’s tear-streaked cheeks hitting Harry’s glasses.
All of their fights, all of their shared animosity and hatred for each other, their hexes and jinxes and cruel words crawled through Draco’s mind. A rejected handshake. Quidditch matches. Dementors and the Triwizard tournament. The Inquisitorial squad. Sixth year. Draco crumbling under the pressure of the Dark Lord, and Harry following him every chance he got. Malfoy Manor and the lies he told to insure Harry and his friends' safety. The FIendfyre and Draco clutching onto Harry, terrified that he would die.
“But I don’t think it really matters now. The Ministry is probably under the same curse Hogwarts is under. They would never know.”
After a long and tiring discussion of whether or not he and Potter should go to Snape’s portrait the very moment they found the book or the next day; they’d finally decided on making the trip to the Headmistresses’ office the next day, which was a Thursday.
Draco was shaking, in fear and anger and whatever other emotions were coursing through him, tangling up his insides and making it hard to breathe. “
Sure, Harry admitted they were friends. Sure, Harry had danced with him for an hour, or longer. Sure, Harry smiled his brilliant smile and his eyes sparkled every time he so much as glanced at Draco, but did all those things-
It had to be a dream. No way, in no reality, would Harry be willing to bring his face so incredibly close to Draco's, not after Draco turned into a murderer.
Of course, he would prefer dating him, but they hadn’t crossed that line from friendship to partners yet. He didn’t think they ever would, but he was fine with that. He would rather have Harry as a friend, than have him as
He was seeing stars, and not the ones that were stuck up in the night sky. The back of his eyelids were surrounded in stars, stars created by Harry’s touch.
Standing beside him in front of the doors leading to the Great Hall, Potter scratched the back of his neck, and then started pulling off his gloves, hat, and scarf.
Potter laughed again. This time Draco was sure he hadn’t said anything funny. “Simple. Yeah. Well, we better get going, then. It would be great if we could find some counter spell or potion sooner rather than later.”
They moved their bodies in unison, sliding down right next to each other. Draco ended up a little ways in front of Harry, but they were still pretty close.
It was amusing how he and Potter went back and forth consoling the other, saying comforting words when they got upset. Sometimes Potter was the one filled with anger and annoyance, and Draco was the one who spoke reassuringly. Sometimes it was the other way around, like right now.
Fresh air hit him as he made it out into the alleyway, the smell of alcohol gone and replaced by rotting trash. He slumped down against the walls and raked his hands against his face, breathing in and out slowly. He was so fucked up. He wanted Harry so, so badly, and yet he couldn’t bring himself to even hold a conversation with him.
Drys stepped forward, and Alec stepped back. “I’ll explain everything, young Malfoy,” Drys said, “however, before I do, you have to tell me, did you contemplate my offer? You had a week to think about it, which is a good amount of time.”
Now, looking at Harry, who was miraculously sitting across the table from him and acting like it was no big deal, was simply stunning to him. What was more stunning, was that Harry looked content, and not lost; not like he was in his own little world while blocking out the real one. Draco was shocked to admit to himself that he was doing the same thing.
“How-” Draco caught his breath- “How are you able to do that? Send me into memories and- and different scenarios.”
Draco let his left hand release from Harry’s hair, the other still touching Harry’s cheek while his thumb brushed over his soft skin, and courageously brought it down to Harry’s groin, his eyes asking for approval from Harry, and Harry nodding eagerly whilst still kissing Draco passionately.
And, now that Draco thought about it, Drys’ whole plan really did revolve around Draco. He wanted to make the Malfoy’s suffer for what they had done to Drys’ family. He wanted to make sure that no matter the outcome, at least someone in the Malfoy family would lose. He’d strategically planned it out, that whatever reality took course, he’d at least partially get his way, one way or another.
But she didn’t get to finish what she was going to say. Once again, the door to the Infirmary slammed open, and Pansy strode in, flanked by Granger, Weasley, and Potter. He was almost relieved to see Pansy, to talk to a friend, but he didn’t know what the fuck the other three were doing, and he had no intention of talking to any of them.
Draco threw himself down next to Harry, who had just gotten over a coughing fit. He instantly put up an umbrella charm around Harry, something he should've done a lot sooner.
He had made extra attempts at avoiding the Mark whenever he took a shower and got dressed the past week; although it wasn’t like he
Draco had been forced to join in that attack, since his father had led it. He’d been under strict instructions to hang back and watch as the experienced Death Eaters did what had to be done. Snape had been the one to explain everything in detail, and Rookwood had stayed back with the two of them to make sure they weren’t planning on doing anything stupid.
Pansy had thrown a party for him, even though he had specifically told her not to, she did it anyway. Typical.
Potter walked back and forth three times in front of the wall, and a door appeared. He pushed the door open and stood facing the inside of the room. Draco backed up a little, his breathing intensified. Potter turned to face Draco, and noticed how scared his composure must be. His brows creased and he took a deep breath, which made Draco do the same.
They walked next to each other, elbows sometimes bumping, towards the stairs. When they got to the top of the set of stairs, Harry opened the book again, pointing to a spell inside of it.
“How very Gryffindor of you,” Harry remarked as he started walking towards the sound himself, completely disobeying Draco’s wishes.
It was the most gentle kiss imaginable, no rushing, no force; just pure, soft, love. Harry was treating Draco like he was built of glass, too. He couldn’t help but think that the old Draco certainly would have never tolerated any treatment where he was viewed as delicate. But now, it felt more than comforting, it felt like he truly meant something to someone.
Draco glanced down, unable to look into Harry’s eyes anymore since a small smile formed on his face. “Ugh. You’re unbelievable. Stop coming back. Stop doing all of this for me. I don’t deserve it. I don’t deserve you.”
“Yeah that sounds good,” Draco agreed as he continued to look down at the bubbling potion. “I’ve heard of plenty of counter-curses to barrier spells, however I don’t know them by name, but I know they exist, so we should be set. Maybe we can even get the counter-curse today and be able to get help from the Ministry by nightfall.” Draco knew he sounded sickeningly optimistic, but it was not that hard to believe. Spells to break wards did exist, and since the book provided them with what he hoped was the correct kind of Restorative Potion, he hoped it would do the same for an anti-barrier spell, or potion.
“Wow. This is really nice, and not at all what I was expecting,” Potter said as he walked farther in, closing the door behind him and admiring every aspect of what the Room of Requirement had created.
Beside him, lying in bed, Harry shifted in his sleep, his body now facing Draco’s. Draco brought his hand out from under the duvet, and was about to brush away the fringe that rested against Harry’s brow bone when Harry’s eyes opened a bit, slowly blinking against the darkness, and Draco supposed, his blindness.
She sighed and her face looked full of sympathy. “Well alright. Here you go.” She handed him the wrap, and he took it gratefully. “Have a good night, dear.”
Draco almost laughed as he kept looking at the Figure. Sure, he looked intimidating, but he was nothing even comparable to the Dark Lord. Not even close.
“Still, we’re different. If you look past all the war shit, and Slytherin shit, it’s obvious we’re nothing alike.” But Draco was becoming less and less confident of the words coming out of his mouth.
Harry’s wand, and shook his head in self-deprecation. “And to finish what you were saying, I had originally wanted to offer up Kaspian, but I knew you wouldn’t have been pleased.” Draco’s fingertips felt the wood of Harry’s wand, and snatched it quickly, not wanting to touch any cobwebs.
His mind was almost forcing himself to think it had all been a dream, but he was positively certain it hadn’t been. People usually said, “It’s too good to be true,” but in this case, it had been too good to be false.
He couldn’t back out of admitting to Harry the truth this time. The truth always came out one way or another. It was a statement Draco had forgotten throughout his entire time of lying to Harry, rather unfortunately.
“You were protected by Hogwarts’ wards at first, the one McGonagall had put up. I don’t know how you’re resisting now however, given that the wards are broken.”
Everything was hazy, but he now remembered what happened at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. He remembered Drys, Alec, and all the Death Eaters. He remembered Harry, and how he had hurt him. Harry had almost died due to
He also hated Potter, of course, for giving him the scars that blemished his skin. But, he supposed he was partially to blame, for he almost cast the
“What do you think happened? Like do you think it’s some kind of curse or maybe just some First Year’s spell gone wrong?” Draco asked Potter innocently.
The noise he heard the first time, the small noise that had obviously came from the dungeon, came again. It really did sound like another person was with him.
to look at the wretched thing. He was only ever tempted when it started writhing; it made him want the damned thing gone more than ever.
he’s rude to everyone, especially the Slytherins. I’ve tried to talk to him about it, but he won’t listen. So, on his behalf, I apologize.”
“Thank you,” Draco said finally; sincerely. “Really, thank you, for returning these to me and keeping them safe. And… you know… thanks for saving my life. Out in the forest.”
“I don’t think you would, but can you please keep this to yourself? What I’m about to say. I wouldn’t want the press to find out.”
His body was almost pleading him to fucking hide his worst mistake, and oh how he wanted to give into that pull.
“You see, Draco. Whatever you choose, I’ll get my way. But the ‘right’ way will benefit you. So, like I said before, it’s a simple choice. Besides, if for some foolish reason, you’d rather decline my offer, and have your family, almost half of the Wizarding World, and Harry Potter
He wasn’t sure why the figure needed Harry’s blood, but it most certainly was going to be used for something evil, since why else would anyone need the
“I don’t care because you’ve grown. You’re a completely different person than you were years ago. Of course, it’s important to acknowledge the past, and help it guide you to become a better person in the present and future, but you shouldn’t let it haunt you for the rest of your life.” Harry let his hand find Draco’s and he squeezed it tightly. “You’re a good man, Draco.”
Draco nodded his head. He knew he wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep after having slept for such a long time, but he could happily lay in bed and not have to worry about anything.
blood? Definitely not to admire and keep in a jar, although Draco was sure some crazy fan out there would do that.
“You could have had a great life, Draco. Ruling beside me, letting me take the reins of your mind. You would have been admired and loved by all, known as the boy who had cleansed the world from the evil Purebloods.”
Kaspian was also a very, very suspicious character. Like, he would be seen by himself in the middle of the corridor at a weird time of day. Draco knew this because he usually saw Kaspian when he would come out of the library, or out of the kitchen, and would just wander the halls for the sake of nothing else to do. But he supposed it was probably nothing. Kaspian was probably plagued with thoughts of the war just like everyone else, and needed some alone time to process everything.
His hands fumbled with the bed sheets as he waited in anticipation for the group to come out of the Pensieve.
“Try again. Maybe you didn’t do the right wand movement,” Draco added, hoping to bring back some of the optimism he had earlier.
“We shouldn’t split up. That’s always a bad idea. Have you ever even seen a horror movie?” Potter said.
It reminded him of the time during the Sleeping Curse. It was extremely odd--he longed for that kind of peace again, the peace that was brought by only two people living inside a giant castle, no one else around except for the one person he loved more than anyone. This thought also sickened him, because why would he be fantasizing about a time where he was literally manipulated and made oh-so-many wrong decisions?
Potter lifted himself off the steps, and took a couple steps in Draco’s direction. “We need to do something.”
Draco tugged his arm from Harry’s grasp, straightening his shirt. “I’m not really in the mood,” he stated blankly.
“Hmm, maybe. I’ve had experiences with- people, invading my mind. Describe to me what it felt like and maybe I can tell you if it really was just a dream, or something else.” Potter rubbed at the scar on his forehead, like he didn’t even realize he was doing it.
Although, Draco knew he shouldn’t be judging Harry, considering he was the one who started their childish rampage throughout the castle.
-” Potter gestured vaguely at the space between him and Draco- “friends. I helped you escape from a broom closet yesterday and now apparently everyone and their mum thinks we’re best mates. Not including yesterday, we haven’t even talked to each other since your trial this summer!”
Now it wasn’t possible. Draco would be condemned to watch the Wizarding World fall apart again, all because he had failed, and lied, and hadn’t changed from the Death Eater he had been only less than a year ago.
Potter crossed his own arms over his chest. “Well, I’m sorry but I can’t. At least for now. Something has happened and you're the only other person around.”
“I’ve heard stories like this,” Elizabeth said. “Where a wizard could escape any curse thrown at them even at their weakest, even without a wand. Mind you, nothing was ever recorded that said a person could fend off
“I love you too,” he said softly, a single tear sliding down his cheek. “I love you so much, Draco Malfoy.” He cupped Draco’s cheek. “Don’t you ever leave me again, for what we found is something made of pure magic, and I won’t let that bond sever.”
He felt a pair of strong, yet consoling, arms surrounding him. Harry was hugging Draco, and Draco found he was hugging Harry too. He was crying into Harry’s shoulder, getting snot and tears all over Harry’s shirt. He felt Harry rubbing small circles on his back, and then he felt wary fingers carding through his hair.
Draco wasn’t exactly sure if Harry was now casting defensive spells because he believed something horrible would happen tomorrow that they needed to prepare for, or if he just simply hated sitting around. He took a wild guess, and came to the conclusion that Harry just hated sitting around, from what he’d observed the past two weeks. And, Friday night, Harry had specifically told him he didn’t think Sunday was an omen of death. Draco really hoped Harry was right.
Granger frowned down at him. She was still on her knees beside him and he was still laying on his back, his head lifted up a bit.
“Please don’t be dead, Harry. I need you.” Draco pressed a soft kiss onto the top of his head. “I can’t do this without you,” Draco sobbed. “Please, please wake up.”
“Yes, you were. But after you passed out, Hermione Granger came to get me, and I levitated you here. You’ve been asleep since last night.”
Draco noticed he was the only one left. All the chairs were still arranged in a circle, and he observed that someone had accidentally left a quill on the ground. He started to walk towards it, and was about to pick it up and stuff it in his bag, because he could use an extra quill, when he heard a noise coming from directly outside the door. His head immediately shot up, and his arm was still extended towards the quill, when the noise came again. He recognized it as a faint drum of laughter. Without hesitation, his hand came to grasp his wand, which was in his trouser pocket, and he pulled it out, brandishing it in front of him.
Hearing Pansy talk, Madame Pomfrey spun around and started to complete his vital check. His mother joined Pansy, looking down at him with worry, but also pride. Somehow she made it work.
Draco looked at Harry, astonished beyond words. He didn’t know what else to do except kiss him; to kiss him, hold him tight, and never let him go.
Harry’s breaths were becoming nonexistent, and Draco was shaking horrifically, but he had to be strong to cast the charm to make it work right. He could be strong.
It had obviously been lightning, he told himself. And he would have believed it had the sound not started again. The noise was almost like someone dropping a vase and breaking it, pieces shattering, except on a larger scale. Then there was a huge
The walk back to the Room was filled with Harry’s consistent blabbering. Not that Draco minded. He liked listening to Harry talk, and his voice was soothing and familiar.
He felt extremely giddy and his leg was bouncing up and down; it was impossible to focus on different types of Muggle sea creatures. It was almost time to make their way down to the Garden, and Draco couldn’t stop thinking about spending more time with Harry.
The duel Draco thought of to stall Drys from killing Harry, because Drys had Harry’s blood and no use for him anymore.
He tried not to watch Harry’s eyes following him as he walked over to his bed, pulling on his shoes and gathering up his wand and a couple of books into his bag. He felt extremely self-conscious, and knew Harry was probably judging him severely, but he pulled himself together, trying to remind himself what Harry thought of his outfit did not matter.
“We are going to do something different than stare at paper all day again. Something actually productive,” Draco said. He took out his wand and held it in his free hand.
They were walking back to the Room of Requirement when the Dark Mark on Draco’s arm started burning and moving like crazy. Luckily, they had been about a minute away from the Room, so Draco sped up his pace the rest of the way, Harry trailing behind in confusion.
“I’m sorry, that was really dumb,” Potter said as he continued to try, and fail, to conceal his tears.
Draco then explained to Pansy in detail everything he could remember from the night before, leaving out the part about the cut on his arm. Pansy pulled up a chair and listened intently to Draco’s story until Madame Pomfrey finally came out to yell at Pansy to leave. Draco was pretty sure Pomfrey had let her stay for more than five minutes, but he didn’t complain. Pansy had also handed Draco his wand. She had apparently come by to see him Saturday morning, and Pomfrey had given her his wand to keep safe until he was awake.
Gathering up any leftover courage, he made his way slowly to his dorm. Once standing outside the door, he could hear the muffled voices of his dormmates, and Draco had to control his breathing for a couple of seconds. He knew Theo would have a shit ton to say, like always. It was also going to be
For the hundredth time in the past two weeks, the world stopped. The snow stopped falling and the wind stopped blowing. The only other two things besides Harry that he was aware of, was the Anemonlea flower still in his hair, its bright petals bringing his mind right back to Harry, and the red gem touching his bare chest, humming softly.
