“Mm. Yeah. Probably could’ve done with just my fingers, but. Well.” He laughed, a soft breathy huff of amusement. “You know what it’s like.”
Malfoy snorts when Harry tries to wave him in first, and gestures Harry ahead of him. “After you, Auror Scarhead.”
“Unfortunately, nothing concrete,” she says, and it’s like a bucket of cold water. The flicker of hope he’d kept burning since dropping off the feather at her Alchemy lab fizzles and dies, and the sudden loss of it is nearly painful. “But hopefully some of what I’ve learned will give help Harry narrow his focus of investigation.”
“First cousin once removed,” Weasley says without missing a beat. He quirks a smile at Draco. “I’m pretty good with working out family connections, as you can imagine.”
“Could have dug my heels in about it,” Harry pointed out, and wouldn’t that have been a fun adventure, seeing which of them could out-stubborn the other. “And will you
“Baking’s not the only thing I’ve learned from your mum,” Harry said mildly as the spatula gave Ron’s hands another couple of whacks, followed up with a firm swat across the seat of his trousers.
He knows he shouldn’t be doing this, but he wants to see Potter before he leaves. If something goes wrong, Merlin forbid, he doesn’t want the first Potter hears about it to be when they’re informing him Draco’s been injured.
“It makes sense,” Potter insists. He steers Draco into his room and nudges at him until he gets into Potter’s bed. “It’ll be easier if you’re already here when you wake me up. And it’s not as if we haven’t shared a bed before, yeah?”
A sudden lightness fluttered in his chest as he walked down the broad aisle that split the room in two, and Draco bit back a smile. Sometimes it struck him anew just how lucky he was to belong here. He hadn’t felt like that at first, especially during his first year here, where he made the long walks to and from his cubicle with his chin up and his spine stiff, wary and half-braced for mistrustful looks or suspicious murmurs from his colleagues as he passed by. How he’d received them, more often than not.
“Well how was I supposed to know that?” Harry asked, struggling to not laugh and spoil his act. He enjoyed more than he should when Draco got all flustered and exasperated with him.
“Harry,” Malfoy says again, still reaching, and there’s something below the surface of his voice, something low and urgent that holds him up.
“Thank you,” Malfoy said, leaning harder into Harry’s side. Then he looked over at Ron. “Now. As I was saying before about that International Wizarding Law lecture we had on Thursday…”
The door opened and Harry slipped into the room. He was wearing a hospital gown of his own, with one arm splinted and tied tight to his body with a sling, and a nasty-looking bruise blooming over his temple. He was clutching a small bouquet of daisies and two shiny Chocolate Frog packets in his good hand.
“I’ve been so worried,” Potter says, and Draco can practically taste the words, they’re so close together.
At least money was still worth something, at least in the quantities he had it in. Otherwise, sometimes he thought he wouldn’t be tolerated in society at all, even here on Knockturn.
“Oh, well, if you’ve saved me a scone,” Draco muttered. From the scattering of crumbs on the plate, it looked like Harry had saved him two scones and then eaten one of them. Still, beggars couldn’t be choosers, and frankly Draco counted himself lucky that Harry had left him the one.
“What on earth would a fever have to do with me deciding to try orange juice?” Draco asks, annoyed, and pushes him away. “Stop that. I’m
Harry had finally given in last night, but only because Ron had promised that if Harry went out one time, just once, then Ron would never say another word about him ever going out again.
There’s a flash of movement from near the window, and Draco turns to see a barn owl peering back at him from its perch.
Harry experiences the sudden and dizzying feel of his stomach falling several stories, just like Number Forty-One’s body did when it fell from the broom.
“If you ever want to have sex again you’ll stop talking,” Draco said, and Harry laughed. Draco made a small sound of disgust and let him go with one last shove.
Draco finally makes him shut up by sticking his tongue in Potter’s mouth, and mercifully Potter’s more interested in snogging than in continuing his ridiculous made-up lyrics.
He’d understood that if he ever managed to find Potter, he might have to give up everything. He just hadn’t understood what that would feel like.
And Harry knew all of this, but he still couldn’t keep from rising to the bait Draco laid out for him. He’d never been able to resist.
She’s still being nice to him instead of giving him sass. This definitely does not bode well for him. He wonders briefly exactly how much of a fuss his parents raised at the Ministry, then promptly decides he’s far better off not knowing.
Harry led the way up the stairs, keeping firm hold of the banister because he was drunk enough that he’d gone a bit unsteady on his feet. The second floor, shared by Ron and Hermione, was dark and quiet, but the third floor was dimly lit by warm lamplight spilling from the nearly-closed door of Ginny and Luna’s bedroom. Music played softly, high tinkling notes and crooning vocals that didn’t form any words Harry could decipher, so Luna was home. The uppermost floor was also dark—Dean and Seamus were planning to stay out a little longer—and Harry switched on the lights with a wave of his wand and pushed open the door to his bedroom.
“Fucking Trace, Harry,” Ron says. “Tell me you haven’t got Malfoy there with you. If he dies before he ends that spell, we’re all fucked.”
The pain in his back has grown bad enough that he’s having trouble thinking of anything else. He paces back and forth a few times, hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. He shivers, checks the cuff on his left wrist and the cord on his right, and then flicks his wand at the camera as the pain between his shoulder blades rises to an agonising crescendo. His wand clatters to the floor and he doubles over, crouching, forehead tucked nearly to his knees, and as his spine curves he feels the skin tear open. Draco screams, reaches up to claw at his shoulders, screams again, and the last thing he remembers is the bright flash and the steady click-click-click of the camera.
From the other side of the shelf, Harry could still hear the steady click of coins being stacked, and a quick spell confirmed what he’d already known; the curse on the spoon was passive, needing to be activated. Harry put his chestnut wand away again, then picked up the spoon and turned it over in his hands.
on another as Malfoy shuffles through them, and there’s no earthly reason why Harry should feel this embarrassed about condoms, of all things, when he and Malfoy have been getting up close and personal with each other’s cocks for more than two years now.
“Exceedingly dull,” Draco says without looking up. “I barely saw any of it, other than potions labs and my hotel room.”
“Oh?” Draco asks, folding his arms over his chest. “And which of us will be sleeping outside, then?” Transfiguration spells are notoriously unstable when used inside Extension Charms. If one of them Transfigures a bed, there’s a good chance they’ll find themselves suddenly on the floor a couple of hours later.
Draco tucked his hands into the oven mitts and opened the oven. The butter knife went into the center of the cake and came out clean. Draco half-turned to give Harry a smirk as he took the cake out, and knocked the lip of the cake pan against the top of the oven. With his hands swaddled in the thick oven mitts, the pan slipped right out of his grasp, flipped neatly end over end, and clattered down onto the opened oven door.
It takes him a moment to make the connection. She’s worried about him. She was worried because he disappeared, which means that she
There’s something about flying with Potter that’s always been better than flying by himself, be it on a broomstick or a motorcycle.
Potter closes the flower book and tucks it under his arm. “Probably,” he says, then looks around. “If you were here over two months ago, there’s probably not much point in looking around for clues,” he says.
And then he steps close, and then closer, and wraps Draco up in a warm hug. Draco puts his arms around Potter without thinking, and leans into him for one brief and glorious moment. His body is torn between remaining tensed, and melting into Potter’s embrace. Which is good because, caught between two opposites, Draco ends up doing neither. He counts two heartbeats before letting go, and it takes every ounce of willpower he’s got to step back.
On the first morning of their forced cohabitation, Harry awoke to an empty bed. Yawning, he sat up and looked around, and found the bedroom quiet and dim. He hadn't even considered how bloody awkward it would feel to wake up next to Malfoy, but it looked like he would get to put off that particular experience until tomorrow.
“Oh, you,” Dorothea says, swatting at Draco’s arm. “She knows better than that. We had ourselves a lovely chat the other day, got ourselves all acquainted. She’s been abroad for a while so I was telling her all the things that are new here on Diagon Alley. I warned her off old Slug & Jiggers. I told her, if you need a potion, you ought to go straight to Draco Malfoy! She was very interested in that, weren’t you dear?”
Malfoy’s still got that wild-eyed look about him, and he’s still wet from the rain, still tracking muddy footprints across the floor. Ghosts can’t track mud.
Later, Harry wouldn’t be able to say what on earth had possessed him to do it. But watching the shape of his name on Malfoy’s lips ignited a burst of
The two Junior Aurors were easy enough to shoo out the door, but Cora was more difficult to persuade. It was only by virtue of being The Boy Who Lived that Harry managed to convince her to leave the safety of her shop in his capable hands while Malfoy did his work. The Auror interviewing her offered to escort her down to the Ministry to submit her official statement, and that would likely take long enough that Malfoy would be finished by the time she returned.
Finally, he gets the tent up and ducks through the door, heading straight for his bed in the corner. Harry drops down on it and just sits there for a minute, too mentally exhausted by this situation and his life and Malfoy to expend the effort to even lay down. The wall facing his camp bed hasn’t changed in the ten years Harry’s been using this model. It’s wide and empty, like Malfoy’s bedroom wall had looked after he packed up his Wall of Crazy. He blinks heavily, trying to remember if he’s had a combined total of six hours of sleep in the past week. No, probably not.
The first touch of Draco’s finger made Harry’s hips jerk, and he breathed deep and even as Draco pushed inside, slow and steady. It burned, being forced open like this even with a single finger. Harry hadn’t had anything inside him since the last time Draco had touched him like this. He liked it well enough, but it didn’t really do much for him when he did it to himself, so he never bothered.
And if the frown hadn’t already told him, Harry would have known a moment later when Malfoy takes out his lighter and clicks it open and shut, open and shut. “Nothing,” he says. He gazes through the open doorway, staring at the fussily-upholstered furniture crowded into the sitting room. “As much as I don’t relish a night spent on the floor, I’m not sure that I trust anything in this place.”
"Well," Malfoy said, sealing the last bag and carefully settling it into the crate. "I'd say that does it here."
He doesn’t think of them as individuals, his marks. He doesn’t give them an identity. It’s “they” not “him” or “her” or whatever name is written on their kill sheet.
He wishes he could take the words back the instant they leave his mouth, but Potter only kisses him again. “You were my first,” he murmurs between kisses, his voice rough and possessive. “And I was yours.”
He gives her a sour look. “Well pardon me for taking an interest in the running of my own bloody shop.”
“Oh,” Draco says. “Well, I suppose I’ll see her sometime next week when Dorothea finally stops bending her ear.”
Draco stares at him and sees no room for compromise on this. Potter waiting outside is likely as much bargaining as he’ll be allowed. He swallows and nods. “One hour,” he agrees.
“I think so,” Harry said, the words sparking off a nervous flutter in the pit of his stomach. “Yeah, I think I am.”
Harry's orgasm caught him almost by surprise; one second he was hovering right on the brink, and the next he was tipping over, pleasure washing over him in waves. He was dimly aware of Malfoy coming too, the steady throb of his cock deep within him, and all Harry could do was hold on tight.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “I suppose you’re right. We’ll be driving each other spare in no time, I’m sure.” He frowned a little. “This is going to be strange, isn’t it, spending all that time together.”
“For fuck’s sake,” Draco says, then shouts at her, “Keep stirring your Elating Elixir or your cauldron’s going to boil over.”
“I’ve read the same intel you have,” Draco interrupts when Weasley launches into yet another recitation of the case particulars. “And even if I hadn’t, you’ve already covered it three times. Believe it or not, I’m good at my job.”
Draco doesn’t question him. One thing about Potter is his instincts are flawless, always have been, and although he hasn’t always trusted Potter, he’s always had the utmost respect for Potter’s eye for danger. They’ve barely started to turn away when the car explodes.
“Erm, sorry, I—didn’t mean to interrupt,” Harper said, looking back and forth between them. “I just came to see what was keeping Desmond.”
Harry had taken advantage of Draco’s distraction to pull Draco’s shirt over his head. He couldn’t see and his arms were all caught up in it, and rather than fight Harry for it, he just let it go. Harry tossed it aside and reached for Draco’s trousers.
Balanced on the wooden stool Draco’s Conjured for him, Harry finds it a little difficult to get a good rhythm going without feeling like he’s about to topple them both right over onto the ground. When he takes too long in getting it figured out, Draco takes matters into his own hands. Being on top gives him the leverage to start up a rhythmic sort of grinding that keeps Harry deep inside him while also driving him entirely out of his mind.
“—and the pawn stabbed him in the finger!” Pansy jumps in, and dear Merlin, they’re finishing each other’s sentences.
Pansy gives him a bland look. “The cow who fucked up your Floo address.” She goes back to dabbing lipstick on her upper lip. “The offices open at eight on Monday. Good luck getting it worked out.”
More lube, another Warming Charm, and Harry had himself slicked up and ready. He moved higher up the bed, one hand wedged behind the back of Malfoy's knee to push his leg up. With his other hand, Harry reached down to steady his cock as he lined it up with Malfoy's arse.
As Harry watched, Draco fetched a plate and a spatula, and carefully piled up a little mound of crumbled-up cake, spooned a little dollop of chocolate frosting on top, and then went digging in Harry’s cupboards. After locating a jar of cherries and twisting it open, he fished one out and stuck it atop the frosting and tucked a candle beside it.
Hermione shrugged and took another drink of beer. “Probably wouldn’t have on its own, but paired with the jumper it was fairly obvious.” She gave his feet a pointed look. “Along with those awful socks of yours. You really ought to replace them.”
Shivering, he reaches for his wand and flicks it, closing all the windows and the skylight, then again to warm the flat to a cosy temperature.
“As I said,” Draco tells him, feeling a little more confident. “It’s a matter of some delicacy. I was hoping you might help me with this… discreetly.”
,” he said. Harry must not have looked entirely convinced, because Ron rolled his eyes and pointed out, “Haven’t we been in training together for half a year so far? And no one’s hexed anyone else?”
“I love you,” Draco says, because he wants there to be no doubt in Potter’s mind what he’s trying to say.
She moves away from the fence, and Draco bends back over the flower bed, and they work in silence for a while. A jay shows up when Draco’s partway through the second bed. It perches on the fence and watches him as he works his way down, piling weeds and sticks shed from the elm tree as he goes. He’s uncertain what he should do with those heaps. He’ll ask Potter where to dispose of them later, otherwise he’ll come back out once it’s dark and Vanish the lot of them.
“I’ll never find anyone,” Harry said, dragging a throw pillow over his face. “I am going to die alone.” It was now September and Harry had been going on dates for almost two months. The furthest he’d got with any of them was with Maria, who’d left him with both a goodnight kiss and a lingering sense of misplaced guilt over the current state of Wizarding politics.
“So,” she says after giving him a few minutes. “Can I assume that it’s something to do with Potter that brings you to my kitchen in the middle of the afternoon?”
“All right,” Draco says, getting down a couple of teacups and saucers, placing them on the kitchen counter. “We kept our relationship a sordid little secret because we wanted to make certain it was going well before we opened ourselves up to outside scrutiny and criticism.” Which, Merlin, they were about to get a load of. Just the thought of it makes Draco want to cancel his subscription to the
He shut his door after himself and kicked off his shoes, nudging them neatly side-by-side against the skirting boards beside his wardrobe. Harry started to unbutton his shirt but halfway through he caught sight of his bedsheets lying twisted and rumpled over his bed, and even though it’d been nearly two months since the last time he’d had Draco over, it struck him hard that he was never going to have Draco here again. The tight wistful-possessive feeling twisted through his chest again as it sunk in that what they’d had was over, really over.
But Weasley isn’t so lucky. A curse had caught him squarely across the ribs, shredded his robes and begun to peel his flesh back in long strips. Draco hits him with every first aid spell he knows, holds him tight and Apparates him to St Mungo’s where several Healers take him away while another lingers to question Draco about what spell Weasley had been hit with.
“That wasn’t part of our arrangement,” Malfoy said. “The arrangement was I agree to come here and you pay for my drinks. You never said anything about me having to be nice to anyone.”
“It drives Ron and Hermione up the wall, how I spoil their kids. I know I do, but my godfather would’ve done the same for me, if he’d been able.” He stares up into the street lamp and blinks a few times. “And anyhow, they’re good kids. Teddy, too.” Potter looks over at Draco. “He’s your cousin. He’ll be home for Christmas hols soon, you know, if you want to meet him.”
Harry’s had a decade to think about what made the Department single him out for this horrid job. He’s certain it was an offhanded comment to then-Head Auror Dawlish:
“Oh,” Harry said, and looked at the bag of flour sitting open beside the mixing bowl. “I’ll make some plain ones, too, then. We’ve still got some of that strawberry jam your mum sent over, it’ll be nice with scones.” There’d be leftovers, but Harry didn’t mind having scones with breakfast and then again with tea. He glanced over and saw that Ron was smiling at him, and Harry looked away again. “What?”
Draco sighs a little to himself and turns onto his back and stares up at the ceiling. His eyes have begun to adjust to the darkness, and he can barely make out the shape where the ceiling meets the wall. He closes his eyes again.
Really, it wasn’t exactly on purpose that he hasn’t slept with anyone else since that first time with Malfoy. At first it was only because it was convenient to not have to go out looking for sex if he wanted it, not that he had more than the vaguest idea how that would even work. All he had to do was call up Malfoy and ten minutes later they’d both be naked. And then after a while it was because Malfoy knew him, and yeah, the novelty of a new person was something that could be fun, but Harry prefers being with someone who knows him, who already knows what he wants and how he wants it and can be trusted to not go running straight off to the
Belatedly, he realises what he’s just said. He’d never bothered to keep his sexuality hidden when he rebuilt his life overseas, but he’s never spoken plainly about it here. Pansy probably already knew, had to have known after that unfortunate incident with Potter in the potions classroom just before he’d left. Though he’s never actually
of sodden clothing hitting the floor draws his attention. He glances up to see that Potter’s taken off his shirt. He’s angled away from Draco, so Draco gets a good look at one of Potter’s shoulders and his side, and then Potter steps into one of the shower cubicles and out of Draco’s line of sight. A few moments later, Potter’s trousers and pants sail out to land near his shirt, and the metal rings rattle over the curtain rod as Potter draws the shower curtain closed. The water starts up a second later.
Draco is perfectly intelligent, thank you very much, and he’s never taken well to anyone implying otherwise. “Why the fuck not?” he snaps.
Zelda hangs her cloak on its hook and looks down at herself. “Bugger,” she says, and goes into the lavatory to fix it.
flat. When he tried to Firecall the offices again, he was informed that Floo Adjustment, Cleaning, and Directory Extension Services didn’t have an available appointment until next week. Gritting his teeth and cursing Agnes to the blackest depths of hell, Draco booked the appointment.
Desmond’s breath caught, and for one awful moment Harry was afraid that he’d fucked up. That he’d entirely mistaken Desmond’s friendliness for attraction, and this was pushing too far and he’d irreparably destroyed his chances with the best source of information on Malfoy. Then in the next moment, a slow, pleased smile spread across Desmond’s face, and Harry could breathe again.
“Come on, do it,” Draco says, holding Potter by the hips, leans in to give the tip of his cock a teasing little lick. Tips his head back and locks eyes with him. “I want you to come on me.”
On the one hand, Draco is glad that his parents still love each other after twenty-five years of marriage. But on the other, that doesn’t mean he wants to know about it in any sort of detail. Pansy’s parents hate each other, but they refuse to divorce because, according to Pansy, that’d be like admitting defeat. Blaise’s mother has a new husband every other year, it seems. Might have a new one now, in fact, though Draco hasn’t spoken to him in a while and can’t be certain. Tomorrow. He should do that tomorrow.
“You’re ready for me,” Harry said, blinking up at Draco. He worked his finger in a little deeper, finding Draco perfectly loose and slippery inside.
When he gets home after speaking to Potter after he’d first woken up, the very first thing Draco does is go through their house room by room, top to bottom, to make absolutely certain that everything related to his curse is safely hidden. All of the books in the library upstairs are Charmed with false covers, and Draco collects all the files Potter’s made about the other curse victims and hides them under his mattress. Draco keeps the book of Chinese mythology in his room, and that in and of itself is not incriminating, should Potter happen to see it. Which, frankly, Draco doubts will happen. Potter has no reason to set foot in Draco’s room, and he’s always been very good about respecting Draco’s private space, just as Draco has always respected his. He has no reason to believe that’ll change just because Potter doesn’t remember a couple of years.
Where Draco goes next, as it turns out, is just over to the neighbour’s. With no Trace on his magic, all it takes is a quick
“Impressive, isn’t it?” Draco says mildly. Inwardly, he’s a bit enchanted by Potter’s reaction. There are drawbacks to witches and wizards being raised as Muggles, but respect for magic is not one of them, and the sheer reverence in Potter’s voice brings a smile to Draco’s face. Despite living in the magical world for nearly two decades, there will always be a part of Potter that’s occasionally struck speechless by magic, able to find a joy and wonder in it that Draco, raised as a pureblood, will never match.
Later. Harry will shoot him later. He just needs a minute. He slips from the bathroom and into the kitchen, silent as death. Fuck, he is so utterly fucked.
Dark. Harry’s never been set off like this, ever. To continue the cat analogy, if a single spell is passing a cat and other cursed places are Crookshanks, then this place is like spending the day at Mrs Figg’s.
“My hand to Merlin, he did!” Neville insisted, catching her hand before she could pinch him again. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say he could read and knew straight off what utter twaddle they were.”
“I worked a case my third year as an Auror,” Draco says, continuing his circuit, trailing his fingertips lightly over the MGB’s fender. “Couple of wizards thought it’d be funny to enchant Muggle cars to do all sorts of strange things. Misuse of Muggle Artefacts had the case until the steering wheel in one of the cars turned into a devil’s food cake while they were on the motorway. Two people were killed, three more injured. I learned to drive after that and…” He shrugs. “I just like cars.”
The wizards manage to hold onto theirs, but Draco’s and Potter’s come flying across the room and Potter catches them both neatly and tosses one to Draco.
What with the delayed gratification they’ve had tonight and all, Harry would have thought that his orgasm would’ve been one that hit like a runaway train. Instead, he climaxes in a gentle cresting of pleasure and then gets kicked straight into a sweet and sleepy afterglow, all warm and heavy and so happy that it feels like he could just burst with it.
So he makes bacon and eggs for Malfoy. And coffee, too. It’s fancy shit from South America, single estate, organic, fair trade, probably comes from beans shit out of the arses of an endangered species of free-range spider monkey who are fed only organic bananas and, of course, the organic coffee beans.
Draco nods. “I’ll walk you out.” He takes a deep breath. “And Potter? Thank you. I understand this is a tremendous imposition. I want you to know how much I appreciate what you’re doing for me.”
Which, now that it’d begun to play out, Draco saw that he could turn this to his advantage. But, fuck. He’d have to be far more careful in his interactions with Harper from here on out. He’d need to balance keeping up the appearance of romantic interest while not actually encouraging it to go anywhere—at least, not anywhere near a bedroom.
Zelda fumbles one hand behind herself and makes a rude gesture at him, and the apologetic tone of her voice never wavers as she keeps talking. And Draco gets a sudden flash of insight into Zelda’s handling of Henri and why it’s so effective. He’s never stayed in the room when the two of them have talked before now, but for this conversation at least, her approach to it seems to be,
“Stop lying to me!” Potter shouts after Draco tells him he’d never seen those files before. “Stop pretending you give a fuck! What is it, did you trick me into dating you so you could get some twisted revenge? Or maybe your Death Eater buddies bribed you so you could all have a good laugh? Or maybe—”
So naturally, that was when Harry fell in love with Draco, and they decided to take their relationship from friendship to romance.
“It does happen occasionally,” Ron said cheerfully, toasting Harry with his bottle. “Oh, are you going to do an accent?”
He wishes he didn’t know what Potter looks like naked, maybe then he wouldn’t fantasise about it quite so much, but Slytherin and Gryffindor have Quidditch practice back-to-back on Thursdays and he’d forgotten his gloves back in September. Potter had been standing at his locker, his back to the door, and dropped his towel just as Draco walked in, giving him an unimpeded look at his body: the thin limbs and jutting joints, the shadows of his ribs shifting as he breathed, and the slight knobs of his spine dotting a path from where his hair curled damp at the nape of his neck all the way down to the tight curve of his arse. Draco had turned right the fuck around and left, forgetting his gloves for a second time. He didn’t go back again.
“No, no,” he said, waving Draco off when Draco made to stand up. “Don’t bother, I can see myself out.”
Malfoy rolls himself off Harry’s lap to sit beside him on the cot, and Harry reaches down to the floor and snags his jacket, rummaging about in the inner pockets. He gets out the torch first, the one where the handle slides back to turn it into a lantern. It’ll be dark soon, so he clicks it on and sets it on the floor beside the cot before diving back into the jacket. A colourful array of condoms come tumbling out as he drags his hand free a moment later, bottle of lube clutched victoriously in his fist.
on each one shows that they were all cursed. The second body also reveals three wounds. The third and fourth bodies have one each, in addition to the deep gashes between their shoulder blades.
Harry continued to eye him suspiciously, then sighed and returned his attention to the Chocolate Frog in his hands. He fished the card out of the packaging and sighed. “Another Merlin. I’ve only got about a thousand of him already.”
afterward. And then the chocolate cake thing had happened, and it hit Harry like a bolt of lightning that it wasn’t just convenience that made him not interested in sleeping with anyone but Malfoy. And by then it was too late, he was already in it too deep to get back out again.
Potter rolls over and stretches out on his stomach, and Draco scoots down the bed and pushes his legs apart so he can lie between them. He runs his hands up the insides of Potter’s thighs, urging him to spread wider, watches him shiver. He does it again, and again, intending to draw this out as much as they can both stand. Potter’s got a gorgeous arse, and Draco is nearly faint with glee that he’s going to be the first person Potter allows to have him like this.
“Relax,” she says, rolling her eyes. “I’m not going to say anything to him about how desperately you want to ride his cock.”
Draco’s just annoyed enough to say, “Are you referring to my tendency to remind you at every opportunity of the time you—”
“They can wait a little longer,” Harry murmurs and leans in to peck another kiss against Malfoy’s mouth just because he can. “How long have I been out, anyhow?”
Katie leads him into a dusty little library just down the hall. The stockroom is in an undisclosed location, accessible only by a Two-Way Floo Connection. Draco had always been curious how they’d managed to make it work without connecting to the official Floo Network, but every time he’s asked, Alyosha has tapped his nose and smiled instead of answering.
“Thank you,” he tries to say, but his throat is tight and the words come with no sound. He tries again, licks his lips and whispers, “Thank you.”
They eat in silence, and perhaps it’s the Butterbeer that makes him feel warm and loose, but it’s not nearly as awkward as Draco thought it’d be. He and Potter finish eating, and then Potter washes the dishes while Draco dries them and puts them away, and covers the rest of the casserole and puts it back into the refrigerator. Draco sets their empty Butterbeer bottles aside for Potter to get rid of tomorrow.
“We’ve got two witnesses who assure me it’s not absurd at all,” Harry countered before he could think better of it. They hadn’t covered interrogations at all in class yet, and he wasn’t sure whether he should have revealed his witnesses this early on. He wished he’d been able to go over that chapter in the book a little closer. He’d looked over it before but most of it hadn’t really stuck. Harry pushed the thought aside as soon as it popped into his head. He was probably over-thinking this, anyhow.
But Zelda’s been fantastic so far, even better than Draco had dared hope for. She’s neat and polite and careful around the shop, and over the few months they’ve been spending time together, Draco’s come to genuinely like her. She’s friendly, and she’s clever, and she’s hard-working, and above all she’s
“Something’s obviously wrong,” Hermione put in from where she sat on Harry’s other side. “Come on, Harry, you can talk to us.”
Ron gave him a skeptical look, then glanced across the room. Harry followed his gaze. Malfoy had both elbows leaned on the bar as he spoke to the bartender. It made his shirt draw tight across his shoulders, made his lower back curve just-so, made his arse stick out appealingly.
“Of course I’m right,” Draco sniffed, then smiled at him and added, “I’m so pleased you’ve mastered agreeing with me so readily.”
Harry doesn’t know where else they end up but he can feel them rattling around, popping from one place to another with no rhyme or reason and his head is spinning, he feels sick, but Malfoy is warm and steady against him, a rock in a storm, and Harry clings to that with all his might.
“Yeah,” Draco says, reaching up to comb his fingers through it, fluffing it back to its usual buoyancy. “It’s going silver.”
“Put those in a bag for me, please,” Draco tells her as he walks by on his way to the shelves with pre-brewed potions, and she sighs as she sweeps them off the counter and into the palm of her hand before she does as he asks.
Granger straightens her vivid yellow robes across her knees. “Not entirely, Magical Bugs and Diseases still wears green,” she says. “But the other floors have been assigned new colours. Artefact Accidents is pink, Creature-Induced Injuries is turquoise, and Spell Damage got lilac. Potions and Plant Poisoning got stuck with yellow.” She grimaces. “They’re all fairly unattractive shades, but the yellow’s just a little bit worse, I think.”
“My own fault,” Harry said, half-distracted by the strange sense of déjà vu that’d suddenly overcome him. Had he and Desmond met before? He managed to dredge up a friendly smile. “Lost in thought.”
He falls more into character with every step. It’s been a while since he’s played the spoiled pureblood scion dabbling in dark arts, but it’s a role he’s comfortable with. He straightens his posture, keeps his strides long and his steps clipped. Hardens his expression and tips his chin up an imperious fraction as he pushes through the door and steps inside.
Well. She’s not wrong about any of it. “Purely out of curiosity,” he says, folding his arms over his chest. “What would you have done if I had turned out to be a werewolf?”
Harry starts to unbutton his own trousers, but gets distracted by Draco dipping his fingers into the tin of lube and reaching behind himself to work a finger into his arse. Harry doesn’t quite realize he’s staring until Draco kicks at his foot.
And, if he were being very very honest with himself, a part of him sort of liked seeing Harry like this, looking like the very image of his younger self. It gave him a bit of a thrill to see Harry laugh or smile, or at ease in Draco’s presence in a way that he never would have let himself be a decade ago.
So the next night, Draco does it again. He leans around Potter to get a measuring cup from the cupboard that he didn’t strictly need for the meal he’s cooking, and steadies himself with a brief touch of his fingertips to Potter’s arm. And that time, Draco could swear that Potter leaned into his side as he did it.
Potter bites the corner of his lip as he idly picks at the label on his beer bottle. Draco quietly has a heart attack.
There’s a shout from overhead and the sound of someone clattering down the stairs, and all Harry can think is that he isn’t done kissing Draco yet. He fumbles behind them, wrenches open the door of the narrow coat closet, and drags Draco inside.
Then Weasley and Potter get into a long debate about the Cannons’ upcoming match against the Appleby Arrows. Draco would have thought that their chatter would annoy him, but it provides a pleasant backdrop to his work. Also, it’s rather amusing to watch Weasley get all worked up in defence of his team, pacing agitatedly back and forth across the lab as his face turns more and more pink. At first Draco wasn’t entirely sure whether Potter’s deliberately winding him up, but when he innocently asks whether Weasley thinks the fact that the Cannons have consistently scored a total of ten points per game for the last five matches is a deliberate strategy, and Weasley launches into another impassioned argument, Potter slips Draco a wink.
It’s always disorienting as fuck to step into something that’s bigger on the inside, even worse when he’s not expecting it. On the outside, it’s just a shed, maybe a little larger than he might expect a shed to be, but still common as newts’ eyes. But on the inside it’s one of the nicest garages Draco’s had the pleasure to step foot in.
“He said—” Zelda begins, and is cut off by a sharp rapping at the door. Draco looks across the room to see Potter with his hands cupped to the glass, peering inside. Zelda sighs and gestures at him. “—he’d be here first thing this morning.”
“—doesn’t explain why you’re lying to me,” Harry cuts in. He’s warming to it, now. Letting loose all his fear and anger and desperation for this to fucking be
“Shall I Transfigure that bed into a fainting couch for you?” Draco asked. He couldn’t quite see Harry’s other arm, couldn’t tell whether that sleeve had shifted as well and had revealed any other images. “So that you can do all your moaning and swooning properly?”
Harry gave Draco the soppiest smile he could manage and kissed his cheek as he reached beneath the table and pinched Draco’s thigh. Hard. And he was immensely satisfied when Draco flinched and hung onto his own smile through what looked like sheer force of will.
He sneaks a glance at himself in the sideview mirror: the blue-framed glasses catch his attention first, and then his pale hair falling softly over his forehead. It always catches him a bit off-guard how old he looks. Somewhere deep in Draco’s brain, he always expects to see himself as he was years ago, just barely into his twenties and still brimming with youthful optimism and enthusiasm and determination to make a difference. That was well before he really began to dig into the mystery of Potter’s disappearance. Before he discovered just how deep the rabbit-hole went.
Potter drives them up near the house slowly, the bike bumping over the grass, and steers them to a stop beneath a broad oak tree before he turns off the engine. The sudden absence of sound is startling. A set of windchimes hanging from the front porch of the Burrow tinkle softly, and off in the distance a songbird twitters out as Potter balances the motorcycle with one foot while he hooks the other around the kickstand and settles the bike’s weight onto it. Then he hops off, and Draco clambers off after him and removes his helmet.
Annoyed, Draco gives him a push, and Harry leaves off composing bad poetry to push him back, which is just as well because it turns out that one rhyme’s about all he had in him. And then they somehow end up in the most juvenile little slap-fight and what a sight that must make, the pair of them with their cocks out and trousers down around their knees, trying their best to stay quiet as they flail at each other in the confines of their little closet, and somewhere in the middle of it Harry manages to accidentally knock the container of lube out of Draco’s hand and it disappears down among the shoes heaped on the floor.
Harry opened his eyes—when had they shut?—and couldn’t stop himself from smiling. Malfoy was blushing, looking both startled and happier than Harry had ever seen him before. That made Harry want to kiss him all over again, so he did.
“Don’t talk about my father like that. Just because yours was so perfect,” Draco says as they step outside. He casts a Warming Charm around himself, and Potter does the same.
“Just a pet project I’ve had for a while and haven’t been able to get working properly,” he says, gesturing to the stack of coloured folders. “What happened with Pierson attempting to steal files made me think that we need better security.”
After he fills them in, Draco goes down to the lobby while Weasley and Granger are in with Potter and takes the Floo back to his house. He throws some things into a bag: several books, a change of clothes for him, and another change of clothes for Potter. Then he steps through the Floo and returns to St Mungo’s.
Harry kept his eyes on Draco as he shucked off the rest of his clothes. One day, possibly one day very, very soon, he thought he’d like to take his time and look, because
“Make yourself at home, dear. Dinner’s in thirty minutes,” she says. She flicks her wand, and the heap of potato peelings on the counter flies into the bin. “Would you like a drink? There’s water, pumpkin juice. Wine, if you fancy something a bit stronger. I think George brought over some Butterbeers, but,” She pauses and makes a grim face, “I’m not sure I’d trust them. He’s been
“Right, if that’s what you’re calling it,” Weasley sighs. “I’ll make this fast so you can get back to…” He flaps one hand. “Whatever.  I don’t want to know. Look, you know how Pierson went into Campbell & Collins last night?”
“—a Muggle neighbourhood?” Draco raises his voice, talking over Potter. “There’s absolutely no reason I should move to a Muggle neighbourhood, Potter, and I won’t do it!”
Balan has pressed himself into the back corner, his feathers all puffed up, making him look twice as big. His eyes are fixed firmly on Draco, gleaming with an intensity that Draco very much does not like.
Lucius nods to him, and sweeps from the room. Narcissa watches him go, then reclaims her teacup and saucer with a murmured
Katie rolls her eyes at that, and Draco takes a few moments to ready himself. He’s not at all concerned about her seeing something she shouldn’t. He’s a skilled
“Ugh,” Draco said, getting an unfortunate mental image of it, dozens of little eyes peering down at him while he showered or used the toilet. “That’s creepy. Don’t even joke about it.”
“First off,” Harry said. He took a breath, and then went on much more calmly. “We’ve just been over this. I’m not really young, Malfoy, I know what I want. And second, it’s not taking advantage if I want you to do it.” He frowned, studying Draco’s face intently. “I mean, if me looking like this genuinely makes you uncomfortable, I don’t mind waiting. They’ll have me back to normal in a couple of weeks, a month at the longest. That’s not so long to wait.”
They ran through it twice more, and the last time Harry’s mouth could barely keep up with Draco’s, sliding up and over Draco’s body as Draco rattled off the names of each bone. Harry finished kissing him, mandible-maxilla-zygomatic-
The lift banging to a halt at its destination was enough to catch his attention. Draco seized Harper by the hand and started pulling him towards the long bank of Floos, but Harper dug his heels in and tugged Draco to a stop.
Weasley laughed aloud at that. “I hate to break it to you, mate, but you’ve got the wrong partner if you’re looking to avoid trouble.”
But Harry only picked up Draco’s mug, raised it in a little toast, and then took a drink. And as he sipped, the cock got visibly harder and then spurted a little burst of sparkling come.
“I’m going to owl her and tell her that her favorite student is besmirching her honor by going about, casting sloppy Transfiguration spells. For shame, Potter.” There, now. This was better. His heart was beginning to slow, though his face still felt hot. He was sure his cheeks were as noticeably pink as the shredded paper on the floor. He hoped that Harry would assume he was embarrassed over the mess he’d made.
“So you’re going to tell him?” Hermione asked with the sort of eagerness that people in happily-committed relationships always seemed to have about them when they saw their friends on the verge of pairing off as well.
Potter, the beautifully wanton thing that he is, gives Draco a grin and slides his arms around his waist. “Would you care to discuss Belgium?” he asks.
a first year girl into giving me some amount of instruction. I wrote her Potions essay for her,” Draco muttered. “She got an O on it, too.”
Dorothea, the older witch who owns the antique shop across the way, has decided that now’s the perfect time for what she refers to as
“Fuck,” Potter says again, slapping Draco’s hand away. He yanks a towel off its hook and drops it over Draco’s lap because, oh. Right. Naked.
But this isn’t what he wanted. Not like this. Potter doesn’t remember, and ever since he lost his memory, it hasn’t been the same. Aside from that last fight, things between them have been gentle. There’s been a little bit of teasing, mostly on Draco’s part. But there’s been no bickering. No name-calling. No winding each other up for the sheer fun of it.
Draco heaves an overly-dramatic sigh and stops by the back of the sofa. “You’re right, I won’t. But only because I don’t want to listen to you complain tomorrow morning.” He pauses a beat, then continues in his very best Potter-impression, “Oh, Draco! I am in
Malfoy isn’t guilty. Malfoy’s no terrorist. It makes Harry’s stomach lurch in a horrifying way because if Malfoy isn’t guilty, then...was everyone else? He swallows hard, takes a step forward, faking interest in the wall of crazy. He tries hard not to stare at all the newspaper clippings, scrawled notes, pictures of bombings and so many of himself, so many of them in his disguises. He tries so hard not to react. Robots don’t react.
They make polite small talk for a few stilted minutes. Robards asks how Draco’s transition was, whether he’s found a flat and settled in. That sort of thing. Then they get down to business. Robards gives Draco a thick packet of papers that outline all the rules and regulations he’ll have to follow when setting up his subdepartment and goes over the basics before discussing Draco’s other assignments.
But all too soon they arrived. “Well,” he said, slowing and tugging Harper to a stop outside the door that led up to his flat. “This is me.”
Malfoy gets the bag and hands it to Harry, and Harry takes out the potions he’ll need. Malfoy watches critically as he lines them up on the bedside table.
Sighing, Draco untangled his fingers from Harry’s hair as he slumped back against the wall, breathing hard, and Harry pressed a trail of open-mouthed kisses to the crease between hip and leg, nuzzling the soft skin there and breathing deep. If this was the last time he got to be this close to these tender, intimate parts of Draco, he wanted to remember every detail.
“Because he’s a giant wanker?” Ron asked, a little hesitant, a little hopeful, like he was afraid of the answer he might get but still couldn’t stop himself from asking.
This deep into evening, thick stretches of darkness have settled over Diagon Alley, making everything look smooth and soft. Warm yellow gaslight falls in broad puddles around the bases of black iron streetlamps and casts shifting shadows as he moves. Draco watches his own shadow as he approaches and passes each streetlamp in turn, how it sidles up from behind him, shrinking down and down til it huddles in a small blot beneath his feet, then stretches out before him longer and longer until it’s swallowed up by the shadows, only to reappear behind him as he nears the next light.
“This house,” Malfoy begins, and he draws himself up in the way that means he’s about to launch into a lecture. “
"You most certainly are a bad influence," Chan shoots back. "That's why they keep you in the basement."
“I’m sorry,” he says, half a beat too late. One hand clutches the collar of his dressing gown closed at his throat and the other, the injured one, he keeps tucked behind him. He leans his shoulder against the edge of the door to hold it half-shut. “I didn’t mean to worry you.”
It doesn’t take long to lay in the spellwork: a broad woven net of Accelerant Charms, usually used to start campfires, and several strong shields to keep the Muggles away until the job is done. Malfoy weaves one final spell, another Accelerant Charm that he loops into the rest and draws back out to the pavement, so that they won’t even have to set foot on the property, never mind inside the mansion itself. Harry spares a moment’s regret for what they left inside. Their wands, his jacket, his glasses, Malfoy’s coat. But things can be replaced, and he doesn’t dare risk trying to go back inside for them. The only thing that truly matters is standing right here beside him.
“Thank you, Draco, just set it on the counter over there. Harry, that roast needs to come out of the oven
He should wake Draco up, but if he woke Draco up then Draco would be embarrassed and things would be awkward, but if he let it go on longer then it would be worse, wouldn’t it? And also Harry really really liked what was happening.
Potter tips his head to the side, watching him. “You’re not going to continue? You were just getting to the good part.”
Cool air floods into the room, and Draco’s skin erupts in goosepimples as he disrobes. It’s windy that night, the branches of the elm tree outside his window making strange shapes, backlit by the sodium-yellow of the streetlight across the street. Draco casts a spell over the floor that will clean up the blood he knows he’s going to get on it, then he ties his Portkey around his wrist and tucks his wand beneath his pillow for safekeeping.
Up in his room, Draco runs through a mental list of preparations. He hadn’t bothered to make excuses for his absence this time. He’ll be back in time to attend dinner at the Burrow on Sunday, and Narcissa had stopped by the shop yesterday so she almost certainly won’t be by again in the next couple of days. The full moon this month has the unfortunate timing to fall just before Passover begins and Zelda’s gone to spend it with her grandmother in France, whom Draco knows she doesn’t get to see nearly as often as she’d like since she’s finished school and come back to England. Draco really hates to close up the shop, but Zelda hasn’t hired a new employee yet so there’s nothing to be done for it.
“Hello yourself,” Draco says, and for a moment they just stand there, smiling foolishly at each other. Then Draco seems to remember that he was actually doing something and reaches past Harry.
“God, Malfoy,” Potter says, gently tracing his fingers up Draco’s spine between the two injuries. “This looks like it’s barely healed at all.”
“France hasn’t got a queen,” Potter says. His hand goes still. “They haven’t had a queen in a very long time, actually.”
Exhausted, Draco closed and locked the door of his hotel room with a lazy swish of his wand and flopped down on the narrow bed. He’d nearly died today, and still all he could think of was Potter.
It’s a fairly ridiculous game. It’s loud and disorganised and mostly involves people shouting, at each other and at the portrait. Wally gets overexcited about the noise and begins to shriek as well, adding to the pandemonium. Lucy swivels her head to give him a disgusted glare and shuffles sideways on her perch to put as much distance between them as she can.
They pass through the elaborate arbour and out of the rose garden to where the path curves across the lawn and up to the Manor. A trio of peacocks pecking for insects in the brittle grass look up as one, heads slowly swiveling to watch as Draco and his mother pass by.
But fuck it, Harry thought to himself as he scooped up a good handful of Floo powder from the repurposed jam jar on the mantel. He was willing to gamble that getting himself accidentally bonded to Malfoy was the worst thing that would happen to him today.
He opened his eyes to darkness and silence, and for one long, awful moment, he thought he was still there. The world resolved itself in a rush, the soft mattress beneath him, the warm sheets and blankets he’d kicked away in the night, and he knew where and when he was again. Harry flung himself out of bed and groped for his glasses and wand, shoved his feet into his slippers and threw on his dressing gown. As quietly as he could, he crept from his bedroom and down to the kitchen.
Potter gives a strange laugh and scrubs his hands through his hair. “Oh my god,” he says. “You’re not going to believe this.”
“He’s getting close to perfecting it. Close enough that he needs test subjects to finish adjusting the formula,” Draco says. “We need to get him right now.”
“Of course I knew. Hermione told me straightaway after Pansy owled her about this one’s stupid plan,” Ron said, jerking his thumb at Draco. “Glad it worked out, by the way. Congratulations. Ginny thought you’d never get it together.”
“There is a stool right next to you,” Draco points out, giving the side of her arse a jab with his wand, and she swats him away.
His foot nudging at Harry's leg reminded Harry ridiculously of a dog scratching its side and he broke into breathless laughter.
“Oh, we already did that, Harry. You can give me just a few minutes in here.” She pulls him inside, the bell on the door tinkling merrily.
Draco huffs a little bit, but he steps into the bathtub and then sits down on the edge of it so Potter can see his back. He uncorks the vial of potion and swallows it down, then sets the empty vial aside. There’s a slight tugging and the soft crackly sound of dried blood coming loose as Potter peels one, two, three feathers from Draco’s back and drops them on the side of the tub.
“Yes, but not like that. I’m pretty good at getting past wards,” Malfoy says, and can't seem to resist sliding a smug glance at the Glock lying on the bedside table. “But the ones the Unspeakables have set up are like nothing I’ve seen before. And if I’d messed about with them, I’d have been a threat. The way I did it was as someone who was nosing too close to the truth, but not a
“We’re required to spend time together,” Malfoy said. He picked up a fancy crystal inkwell, and held it up to the light to examine a smudge of dried blue ink in the bottom.
Malfoy’s eyebrows went up and a moment later he started to laugh. “That… is definitely a cock,” he managed to gasp out between bursts of laughter. “How did you manage that to do that?”
He debates whether he should seek her out, uncertain about what state of dress he might find her in, then remembers that this is
He thinks about all the times he’s dragged himself out of bed and stood over Potter and prodded him off the sofa, and how all of those times when Potter blinked his eyes open, Draco’s cock was
There was a wide dark pink mark stretching low across Draco’s ribs from where he’d been bent over the edge of the bathtub. Harry hadn’t realized that he’d been pushing Draco against it that hard. Draco had delicate skin that bruised if he so much as looked at it wrong, and normally Harry was so careful. He leaned down and kissed the mark. After a moment, Draco’s hands came down to card gently through his hair.
“Like I had a fucking cauldron dropped on my head and I’ve got an idiot hero for a boyfriend,” he snaps. Or tries to snap. His voice is still coming out soft. His head feels like it’s been stuffed with wool batting.
They stare at each other for long seconds. Then Potter breaks the stand-off by heaving a theatrically large sigh and flinging his hands up in the air.
For a moment Harry has the wild idea of proposing to Malfoy right here and now, but he dismisses the idea just as quickly as it’d popped into his head. At the very least he ought to think some on how he’s going to do it, otherwise he’ll probably say something stupid and terrible. Knowing Malfoy’s in love with him back probably hasn’t turned Harry into less of an idiot around him, and Malfoy will never ever let him hear the end of it if he screws up, or worse, lets one of his utterly terrible innuendos slip out. And anyhow, they really ought to give all their friends and family a chance to get used to the idea of them as boyfriends before they start planning a wedding. Harry has a vivid vision of introducing Malfoy to the Weasleys as his fiancé and actually shudders at the thought. Yeah, they’re definitely going to wait on that. Maybe a long while. Harry knows that Malfoy’s it for him. There’s no reason to rush.
Malfoy cast a slew of spells at himself and Harry, and whatever he saw in the results made him sag in relief. “Temporarily,” he said. “It’s only temporary. It appears to be a type of spell that’s sometimes used in political marriages, or to marriages arranged to solidify relations between two families. It encourages the newlyweds to spend time together. You know, really make a go of it. Typically, the spell will only last about a month.”
“We’ll continue this conversation later,” Dorothea says, patting his arm, and Draco gives her a smile.
Talking to Potter is relaxed and easy until they get to the locker room and Draco catches sight of himself in the mirror. He stops to get a better look.
“It’s fine, Malfoy. They look Muggle, see. Hiding in plain sight.” He gives Draco a lopsided little smile. “Like we are.”
The flip Harry's stomach did this time was definitely elation, because the sight of Malfoy in his uniform
“No!” Draco rounded on him. “You don’t get to lecture me about the werewolves! You jump off bridges!”
“I’m beginning to,” Potter says, picking up his quill again and absentmindedly blotting at the drip of ink with the pad of his thumb. “Where did the blood come from?”
Oh yes. That arsehole definitely knew. Draco gave him a glare, even though Weasley wasn’t looking at him, and then did his best to focus on his paperwork, so that he could get through this stack of folders and move on to the part of his evening where he could drink.
“Keeps things exciting, I’ll give you that,” Harry agreed, resisting the urge to move closer to Draco. He’d missed the small point of contact from the instant Draco had moved away and very much wanted it back.
The night of the full moon, he and Potter eat dinner together early and do the washing up, and then Draco sits at the table for as long as he can stand, browsing through potions periodicals while Potter reviews some case files for work. When the ache between his shoulder blades edges toward an itch, Draco stands up.
Draco takes a deep breath and presses down, feels the tense muscles spasm and Potter’s breath comes out in a pained hiss. Draco backs off immediately.
Ron turned the suspicious look he’d been aiming at the pint onto Malfoy instead. “I didn’t think you had,” he said slowly, as if Malfoy had suggested something utterly absurd. “Because I watched you carry them over here.”
“I never would’ve used yours,” Harry says. There’s an insistent note in his voice that he’s not used to hearing in himself, and it startles him nearly as much as Malfoy, who blinks a few times before shutting his mouth.
Potter shrugs. “It’s just weird, is all. Like finding out the Prime Minister eats jam sandwiches or something.”
And then he paused, waiting. All this time he’d avoided thinking about it in those words, because that would make it real. Being in love was something beautiful and terrifying, and the idea of being in love alone was almost unbearable. He waited for the crushing despair to set it. The hopelessness. He waited to feel trapped, to feel dragged down by his longing for someone who didn’t feel the same. This was the first time he’d admitted those three words to himself:
“Hold on tight,” Potter says, and what a coincidence, that’s exactly what the Potter of Draco’s fantasy said.
“I could smell your arousal,” Potter growls, nipping at Draco’s neck. “I could smell when you came.”
“Bad,” Malfoy says. “It’s very, very bad.” He pauses, and Harry can see him gathering his thoughts, considering his words. He takes a breath and continues, “We wizards are constantly radiating magic. Not much, not enough for us to notice. But it’s like how our bodies are constantly radiating warmth, constantly breathing out damp. We can’t help it, and that magic has to go somewhere.”
“Ron must have missed that lesson, then,” Hermione said dryly. “Just the other week he let George goad him into a contest about who could stand to eat the spiciest curry, and then he was up sick half the night.”
“There is an enormous difference between liking someone and wanting to shag his brains out.” He slouches in his seat, stretching his legs out so his feet are beneath her chair. He hopes it’ll annoy her. “They’re not mutually inclusive, you know. I can think he’s an attractive man and still dislike him. Intensely. Which I do.”
It takes some effort, but Draco lets go of his initial surge of indignation. Potter doesn’t have to help him, he reminds himself. Potter is rearranging his entire life to help Draco. He doesn’t have to do any of this.
Zelda huffs and sweeps the stack of Sickles into the palm of her hand before stamping off, and Draco hasn’t got the faintest idea what she’s got herself so worked up over. The Goblins like her well enough; she’ll be back inside of ten minutes. But she’s been behaving strangely ever since she came back after her time off from the shop. He wonders whether something happened while she was away that she’s not telling him.
Malfoy gave him a few more thrusts before he pulled out and took himself in hand, working himself on long, smooth strokes, the head of his cock disappearing into his fist at the end of each stroke as Harry watched, transfixed. It felt like it took barely any time at all before Malfoy gasped out, “Here, here,” and then came over Harry’s stomach, long stripes of come mingling with Harry’s own.
“Pleasantly surprised,” Harry said, and he was. There was something about this that felt comfortable, for all its obvious luxury.
“So, I took some stupid and unnecessary risks and then was an arsehole about it this morning, and you might’ve overreacted a little bit?”
After a while he pushes himself to his feet and stumbles into the bathroom where he’d left a change of clothes and a spare wand on Sunday. It’s chestnut and unicorn hair, and requires a bit more effort to use, but it works for him readily enough. He deals with the bloody wounds on his back and Vanishes the feathers stuck to him. He gets in the shower and scrubs dirt and blood from his skin, then gets out and dries himself off and dresses in grey trousers and a warm black jumper. And then he might as well face the music.
The sleeve of his clean set of robes fits a little too snugly over his bandaged arm to be entirely comfortable, but anything with looser sleeves will interfere with his brewing so he’ll simply have to tolerate it. It’s not noticeable when he inspects his reflection in the mirror, and that’s all that matters to him.
And as much as Draco made light of it sometimes, rolling his eyes with Weasley and saying, ‘What, again?’ when Harry ended up in St Mungo’s, and his tradition of buying Harry get-well flowers and ugly socks, deep down it sort of terrified Draco how little regard for his own life Harry seemed to have. And yeah, being an Auror was a dangerous job, Draco knew that, but there were risks and then there were
Draco only cocked an eyebrow at him. Then he smirked and also cocked his hip, drawing Harry’s attention to his—
“Oh,” Harry said, surprised and more than a little disappointed. He’d honestly assumed they’d pick up where they left off, and he hadn’t quite realized how much he’d been looking forward to it until Draco said he didn’t want to. “Okay. Well. If you change your mind about it, let me know. I’d, erm. I’d like that.”
(Well, two people, but the idea of Lucius Malfoy asleep on his sofa made even less sense than Draco Malfoy being there.)
“It also said I’m not an Auror anymore. It’s got me riding a bloody desk! It’s got Ron insisting I’m curse-damaged and I can’t be an Auror anymore, and—”
yourself, which is ridiculous! You love ‘Arry and he ‘as chosen to be with you, and zat should be enough.” She shakes her head. “Zey all mean well, but it is difficult. I understand what it is like to be ze outsider.”
Potter shakes his head again. “Full moon,” he says bitterly. “I’ll be in no shape for polite company. Or whatever sort will be at any party that girl plans to throw.”
For a while, he loses himself in the steady rhythm of chopping vegetables. He hums to himself as he works, a Kooks song that’s been stuck in his head on and off for the past couple of days. It’s been far too long since he’s cooked, he decides as he finishes prepping the vegetables and begins to melt butter in a pan. For years, he’d used cooking as a way to destress after a long day at work, sort of as a replacement for the potions work he quit doing right after he left Hogwarts, except without the danger of something exploding if he fucked up or his attention lapsed for a moment. And it was something he could share, a simple pleasure he could give to other people and take pleasure in himself. His boyfriend, if he happened to be seeing someone at the time, but most nights it was Megan.
In the meantime… Draco glanced guiltily to the dark Floo before he reached over and caught the edge of the throw blanket and pulled it over himself, tucking it around his legs. It was still warm from Harry’s lap. Tomorrow, he’d start trying to bury all of this nonsense again. But for now, he’d let himself have this.
Malfoy opened his mouth, then shut his mouth again, then very quietly said, “All right." And it wasn’t anything even approaching an apology, but Harry had a feeling it was probably the best he could expect.
“Not giving it that chance.” Malfoy’s lighter is suddenly in his hand, and he twirls it idly in his fingers, flicks it open and shut, open and shut. “What was it you said, that there are very few problems that can’t be solved by burning it to the fucking ground?”
Which he needn’t, because Draco has no problem telling him, “Because I can’t very well go to work in my pyjamas.”
“You do realise I’m an Auror, not a Healer?” Potter goes on. His eyes are big behind his glasses, and very green. Such nice eyes. “I only know enough Healing spells to stabilise someone in the field until they can get seen to by someone who
He has no idea how long he spends on the bathroom floor, but he must doze off at some point because it’s fully dark when he jerks awake to a brisk knock on his door. Draco forces himself up and stumbles into his living room, where the streetlight spilling in from the window is enough for him to retrieve his wand from where it’d fallen beside the armchair. He casts a
nice painkillers. Well, fuck. He took stock of the rest of himself, and nothing seemed broken, only bruised. That was all right. They’d probably let him out of here tomorrow morning, maybe tomorrow afternoon at the latest. He knew they’d want to keep him overnight, because they always kept head injuries overnight.
Harry laughed aloud and mercifully dropped the chair back onto all fours and put his hands down again. “Hermione, you think
First, he casts heavy wards over the walls of the flat, both to keep himself inside and to hide the fact that he’s up here. Then he opens up the skylight and the windows, shivering a little at the chilly air that floods in, in case the wards aren’t enough to stop him. He doesn’t want to break them again. Then he sets up a camera on his kitchen table, carefully angling it so it will capture him if he stands in the middle of the living room. It’s charmed to snap a photo every three seconds as soon as it’s activated. Then Draco takes off his clothes and sets them aside and takes out the two wrist cuffs he’s spent the last few days charming.
“I need you to get on the Floo to Henri.” He shoulders her aside and pulls the door open to peek out into the shop. Other than a witch with an enormous feathered pink hat browsing through vials of potions, it’s deserted. “Right now. It’s an emergency.”
Other people. He needs other people around. That’s where things had seemed wrong before, when other people were around. He needs Ron and Hermione.
“Thanks,” Harry told him as he passed by, sneaking another kiss from Malfoy before he ducked into the bathroom. He hurried through his own shower, brushed his teeth and washed his face, and then hesitated before he opened the door.
“How have you never heard of that before?” Draco demands, still trying to keep his voice down. “It’s one of the most important rules of etiquette in proper wizarding culture. A guest should always arrive five minutes early. It shows respect for the host.”
“Oh, you…” Harry trailed off as Draco tugged on him, pulling him onto his side so they were facing each other. Their hips lined up for a moment and Harry shivered as the hard ridge of Draco’s erection dragged over his own.
But it’s not all good. He fidgets almost constantly. Paces back and forth like a caged animal whenever he’s indoors. And when Potter was describing the symptoms of his lycanthropy, he completely neglected to mention the mood swings. The smallest things seem to irritate him, but his annoyance is transient because the smallest things also seem to delight him.
Between them they polish off the samosas and the korma and the wine, and then Potter packs up the rest of the curry and the rice and puts it away in the refrigerator while Draco washes their plates and silverware.
There’s another parlour off the other side of the entryway, this one larger with a square grand piano crouched in the corner. A large archway connects to the dining room, and Harry follows that through to the butler’s pantry, then into the kitchen, then back up the hallway, peeking into a small library and peering up and down the empty dumbwaiter shaft with the aid of a small electric torch he fishes out of one of his jacket pockets. Upstairs he goes through half a dozen bedrooms, from the large elaborately-furnished master suite looking out onto the front garden to a small room tucked at the back of the house, little bigger than a closet, with two narrow beds crammed into it. This is definitely a wizarding home, if either he or Malfoy had any lingering doubts about it; the beds are house-elf sized. Continuing up another flight of stairs, there’s another floor of bedrooms, and then above that, finally, the attic.
But other than that, nothing else had really happened. Draco had no other obligations at work or at home. And with only the one not-very-exciting case with which to occupy himself, that meant that Draco had more than enough time to spend mooning over Harry like a lovesick second year with his first crush. And worse, he felt so bloody obvious about it. Harry didn’t seem to have noticed, thank Merlin, but a couple of times Draco had caught Weasley watching him speculatively, and Draco couldn’t quite shake the feeling that Weasley had him all figured out.
broken something valuable, they’ll never admit to it, especially since all the ones most likely to have broken something (read: all the ones with Weasley as their surname) are also the ones most experienced in saying they didn’t do it with a perfectly straight face, and if Molly Weasley isn’t able to get the guilty party to crack, Draco Malfoy certainly won’t be able to. So Harry doesn’t bother with a reply. Just gets his mouth back on Draco again, and after a moment one of Draco’s hands comes up to cup the back of his neck, the slight pressure guiding him in closer.
The low rumble of a passing lorry roused Harry enough to move them away from the street. He broke the kiss just long enough for them to stumble over to the building on the corner, tripping over the step up into a deep, shadowy doorway. Harry hauled Malfoy around and pushed him hard against the glass door of the shop. It rattled in its frame, setting off a faint jingling of bells from inside, and then they were kissing again.
He’s got everything ready by the time Potter comes back down, dressed in a pair of jeans with a fraying knee and a thick blue wool jumper with a large yellow H stitched onto the front. It doesn’t take long to eat and clean up, and then they take the time to sort through the stack of curse books, with Potter Charming their covers innocuously Muggle before Draco organises them on the shelves in the library. Draco takes a moment to put the sofa back in order from having been slept on, fluffing the cushions and refolding the rumpled afghan, before they put on their shoes and Potter turns to face Draco.
“Clear!” another yells and Harry scrambles back, pressing himself against the wall. His heart is going to explode in his chest, just like Malfoy’s will if they shock him again. Surely the human body can’t withstand such a horrid thing?
Draco sighs and flops back on the bed, exhaustion and his injury and a really brilliant orgasm all catching up to him at once. His eyes slide shut and he doesn’t fight it as he turns his face into the pillow.
And then it comes again and it’s so jarring that he stumbles backwards and knocks over a metal tray of scalpels. He scrambles out of the way, but no one’s paying attention to him. One of the younger nurses thinks she did it and she looks as though she’s about to cry as she gathers everything up. The doctors and nurses breathe a collective sigh of relief as Malfoy’s pulse remains in attendance.
“We’ve worked that out for ourselves, thanks,” Malfoy said, and was nearly drowned out by Nicolas Cage suddenly shouting, “I’M A VAMPIRE!” and oh dear lord, now he was flapping his arms.
There’s no organisation to it at all, and it sets Draco’s teeth on edge. He has no idea how Katie can work surrounded by chaos, the mess and the
Even collaborating, it takes them the better part of a year to get enough substitutions figured out and the formulas submitted for Ministry approval that they can begin selling potions made from them. Currently, the list of available potions is quite limited, but Draco hopes to at least double it by this time next year.
Laughing, Harry pulled him in for another kiss. “Absolute rubbish. There were about five thousand bats.”
Because as much as rejection would hurt, Harry thought that the not knowing would be worse. If Malfoy made it clear he was uninterested, it would hurt, but then it would be over and done with in one sharp blow, and Harry would be able to start learning how to get past it. But going on like this, with this awful longing and the vague promises of
He can tell she’s trying to change the subject, so he lets her. “Oh Pansy, stop, you’ll make me blush,” he says dryly. “Are you finally ready to go?”
Potter tears off the paper while Draco watches apprehensively. He’d meant to get a plain one, and then when he’d seen this in the shop he couldn’t resist wrapping it up as a gift for Potter.
, Draco thinks about going back to going back to his little flat and it doesn’t seem quite as appealing as it did when he first left it. He doesn’t want to stay here in this Muggle neighborhood, or here in this house with its Muggle appliances. It’s not even that he wants to continue to live with Potter, who’s turned out to be a much better housemate than Draco would have predicted.
Draco stroked him through it until Harry went boneless against the bed, the tension flooding out of his body in a sudden rush. Draco flopped down beside him, propped up on an elbow, and couldn’t resist reaching out and tracing the petals of a red flower inked below Harry’s collarbone.
The fading embers of Draco’s irritation spark at the idea of Potter and Pansy discussing him behind his back, though he’d already known they did that from bugging the table on Friday. Still, he’s annoyed that neither of them had mentioned he would be working together with both Potter and Weasley. Although, Pansy’s comment to Potter about meeting Draco in a more informal setting makes a lot more sense now. Draco has no idea what would have happened if he’d seen Potter today for the first time in years. It was bad enough they’d sprung Weasley on him.
“You should have told me,” Desmond said, and Harry could see how his balled-up fists trembled with impotent rage. Truthfully, Harry was impressed that he was keeping himself so tightly controlled. Harry wasn’t at all sure that he could have stood in Desmond’s shoes and done the same. He’d likely have been shouting by now.
The front of his robes are soaked with blood, and Draco doesn’t even notice it until a young Mediwitch draws him aside and cleans him up with a few gentle spells. “There you are,” she says with forced cheer. “You’ll want to look presentable when you visit your partner after he’s patched up.”
“Extremely unfair,” Draco says. He’s growing very sleepy at a somewhat alarming rate. “There are regrettably few circumstances in which I am allowed to hit him. He choked on biscuit crumbs once, and I got to wallop him on the back. It was the highlight of my week.”
“Oh—I—” Draco paused and gathered himself, a little embarrassed how much the kind gesture had thrown him off-balance. “Thank you. That was very thoughtful of you.”
They walked out together, and Draco knocked his shoulder into Harry’s before they parted ways, Draco heading up Diagon to wherever he’d agreed to meet up with Pansy and Harry around the side of the coffee shop to a quiet place from which to Apparate.
“No one can change that much,” Harry had replied, and Ron had rolled his eyes about it and told him, “Yeah, but he
When Malfoy touched him again, he didn’t flinch. As always, the first intrusion of someone else’s finger into his body made Harry feel strange and eager and inexplicably embarrassed all at once. Malfoy touched him slowly, stroking his finger in and out for a few moments before he added a second. Harry breathed through the burning stretch of it and palmed his cock, keeping himself hard.
Draco shrugs. “Around.” He doesn’t want to tell Potter that his first boyfriend had been a University student reading Chemistry. One night they’d got drunk, and Draco had cast an
After dinner, they retire to the living room with its mountain of books, and they begin to look through them, occasionally reading bits aloud to each other. They’re sorting through mostly in search of anything to do with birds. Draco reads about Prometheus, who was chained down and had his liver eaten by a giant eagle each day, only to heal each night. He scans ahead until he finds the story of Ischys, who had an affair with Apollo’s lover and was to have his eyes pecked out by crows, only the crow sent to do it felt sorry for it and didn’t and Apollo turned the crow black with the force of his glare.
Draco followed him inside and closed the door after himself, then took off his shoes and left them sitting neatly beside Harry’s. He dropped his satchel on the chair and opened it, pulling out pajamas and a small toiletry bag, and a warm sort of fondness fluttered in the bottom of Harry’s chest at how Draco didn’t bother to look around, and his easy familiarity in Harry’s private space.
Draco sneaks another glance at Potter, the way his dark brows draw together in concentration, how he’s caught his lower lip between his teeth, and Draco has to look away again. It’s taken Draco years to come to terms with the fact that he likes men, but he’ll never come to terms with the fact that one of those men is Potter. Finding Potter attractive is a complication, and Merlin knows Draco’s got enough of those in his life right now.
Draco makes it to the final drawer on his list, marked Ros-Ryz, and has just slid it open when he feels the faint prickling of the Locator Charm wash over his skin. He shivers and the hair on his arms rises into goosepimples.
Everything went well enough until it was time to leave. Touch, as it turned out, was in fact a requirement of the bond. Thirty minutes after accidentally triggering the spell, a faint itching started up under Harry’s skin, and Malfoy sighed and said, “Bollocks.”
Ron shrugged. “I don’t know what a Hubert looks like, to be honest. Mostly I think you still just look like a Harry. Even with…” He paused, gesturing vaguely to Harry’s person, “…all that.”
“Malfoy,” Harry says seriously. “I need to be honest with you…” He sits up and takes one of Malfoy’s hands in his and holds it firmly. He looks deep into Malfoy’s eyes. Did he imagine the way Malfoy’s breath just caught? Malfoy’s watching him avidly, and Harry takes a steadying breath before he continues, “If there were NEWTs in fucking, I’d give you an O. Because you give me one every time. Sometimes even two or three if I’m very lucky.”
“You’re trying to get your hand on my cock.” Harry glanced over his shoulder, but Mrs Calloway didn’t seem to have overheard.
He opens the door and and finds Weasley sitting at one of the room’s two desks, an array of folders spread out over the top. He’s scribbling something into a small notebook. Draco steps inside and shuts the door behind him, has a look around while he waits for Weasley to acknowledge his presence. Weasley keeps his office neat enough. A little cluttered, but not unbearably so. Lots of pictures on his side of the room, mostly of Granger and small ginger children Draco assumes are his, but also of his parents and many siblings. He spots a few of Potter mixed in there, too. One in particular catches his eye, of Potter in that black leather jacket and boots, straddling a gleaming black motorcycle and grinning at the camera. Draco hastily looks away.
They shared a lift downstairs, said good night and parted ways in the Atrium, where Harry stepped into the Floo. He was only home long enough to feed the cat, and then change into a Harper-sized robe and to take another dose of Polyjuice. As soon as his appearance settled into Harper’s familiar features, Harry stepped back through the Floo and out into the Leaky, and from there headed down Diagon to Knockturn.
And of course, he went straight for the spoon. He took his time, and a somewhat roundabout way to get to it, but Draco knew exactly what was in his shop, and kept a closer eye on the four cursed objects than anything else—especially the three that weren’t locked up securely in the case. The ring was the most dangerous, enchanted with a variant of the Jilted Lover Curse, but the spoon was a close second in sheer malevolence. Somewhere over the decades, some witch or wizard with a nasty sense of humour had enchanted it with a powerful Immolation Curse that would only respond to Muggles. It’d taken the IUMC Curse-Breakers several weeks to disarm it, leaving the curse intact but twisting a few subtle strands of spellwork so that in the unlikely event the spoon made its way out of the shop and into the hands of a Muggle, the curse would harmlessly self-destruct the moment it tried to activate.
“All right, then,” Harry said and tackled him to the mattress and kissed him hard, because ‘make me’ was probably as close to an invitation as Draco would give him.
Harry is bouncing along with all the excitement of a first year off to Hogwarts for the very first time, pushing through the crowds of parents waiting on the platform, his gloved hand linked with Draco’s, tugging him along, pacing back and forth in search of the best place from which to see Teddy when he arrives.
“No,” Draco tells him. “I’ve got another idea.” He sucks in a deep breath. “Potter. I need you to trust me.”
“They got lucky. That’s all,” Harry says. “We need to figure out a plan. Can’t just keep running like this. We need to put an end to this.”
He probably shouldn’t let this happen. But what the hell, it felt good, and it wasn’t hurting anyone except himself. He’d enjoy it tonight, take these few minutes before he fell asleep to pretend that this was something he could have. And tomorrow, they’d figure out how to bring it all to an end.
Dimly, he registered Harper reaching his own completion, shoving himself as deep as he could inside Draco, the heavy throb of his cock as he emptied himself into Draco’s body.
Draco keeps up a steady stream of half-mumbled expletives punctuated by gasps and groans, none of it loud enough to be worrisome. Harry’s just beginning to lose himself in it, swept away by the steady tightening of his arousal, when he’s startled by a woman’s laugh from what sounds like is right on the other side of the coat closet door. Oh god, there are people in the entryway now, how long have they been there? Suddenly, he doubts how loud Draco’s been, how loud they’ve
Draco finds that a small part of him is comforted by the fact that no matter what happens in the coming months, whether he succeeds or fails, at least he won’t die a virgin. A smaller part of him is curious whether Potter’s thinking the same thing.
Draco thought perhaps he should be upset by that, but he was highly distracted by the way Harry was sucking at his neck. “Ah,” he said. And besides, he understood exactly what Harry meant. Sometimes working Harry up into a pique did more for Draco than any physical stimulation ever could. Fucking Harry while his temper ran high was Draco’s favorite thing in the world.
, even though it was far too large for that. The living room was broad and open, with big windows on the far wall. A plush burgundy and cream rug covered the dark wood floors, and the furniture was all overstuffed tufted leather in a rich deep green. There were three bookcases holding at least four bookcases’ worth of books, and an enormous fireplace with an ornate marble mantle  housed a cheerfully crackling fire that bathed the room in soft warm light.
When Zelda returns, fingers perfectly intact, they’ve got their first customer of the day. Draco lingers behind the counter, listening to Zelda answering questions, and helping her with the till. He only has to step in a few times, mostly for questions of where various things are located because Zelda’s still familiarising herself with the shop’s layout. By lunchtime, he feels she’s got a good enough grasp on things, and Tuesday afternoons tend to be slow enough that he feels comfortable leaving her to mind the front by herself for a few hours. He sends her on her break, risks leaving the floor unattended for the few minutes it takes to run upstairs and make himself up a plate of last night’s leftover roast and veg. He’d strung up a Proximity Charm across the front doorway, a page shamelessly stolen from Dorothea’s book, but he’s able to bolt down his lunch and do the washing up without it going off. Back downstairs, he only has a couple of customers before Zelda comes back.
She said it with such a straight face that it took Harry a moment to twig onto why that name sounded familiar. He burst out laughing.
Malfoy’s gaze drifts to the looming house. “It must be terrifically strong,” he muses, and sounds intrigued.
Harry had reviewed the next two chapters and finished his cup of tea, and was just contemplating making a second cup when Draco called him back. He went eagerly, leaving his cup on the counter without rinsing it, but what the hell, it might distract Draco from fussing about the teabag in the sink. And then was intensely and increasingly disappointed when studying turned out to be nowhere near as exciting as he’d built it up in his imagination. Helping Draco to study had involved not very many clothes and rather a lot of Harry’s mouth on various parts of his body, along with several interludes of vigorous shagging. Study breaks, Harry had called them just before capturing Draco’s laughing mouth with his own.
So yes, he’d agree to a game of Quidditch even if Potter weren’t currently looking at him with great big hopeful puppydog eyes.
“I just assumed…” Draco trailed off, his frown deepening. “I heard about all the dates you went on. I assumed at least one of them would have, well. You know.”
At the time, the way Malfoy had lolled all over Parkinson, and how she’d fawned over him and cooed at him and played with his hair, had only been obnoxious, because back then everything about Malfoy had been obnoxious. But now, god. Just the
“A habit I’m afraid you’ll have to break here,” said Desmond with a rueful smile. “Mr Malfoy frowns on idleness, and if he catches you at it, well…”
There was a brief tap at the door just then, and when Harry called out, the Mediwitch came bustling in. Draco relaxed a fraction when he saw that it wasn’t Mediwitch Marigold, which was silly because she worked upstairs in Spell Damage so of course she wouldn’t be taking care of Harry this time. He didn’t recognize this one, but she certainly seemed to know him. Gave him a slow, disapproving look, then didn’t give him a second glance as she briskly got on with taking Harry’s vitals while Draco sat by as still and silent as a statue.
“Expecting a party?” Malfoy scoops up a few and sorts through them, eyebrows going up. Harry catches sight of
“That’s what I’ve been saying!” Hermione said, lighting up. “That is exactly what I’ve been saying. It’s absolutely infuriating!”
strikes Harry momentarily speechless, and then the sucking twist of Apparition steals whatever he might’ve said next.
Draco starts walking, heading for the small park nearby. There are a few people at one end of it, where a small playground has been set up. He recognises Mrs Field sitting on the bench with another young mother, chatting while their babies play together on a blanket. She doesn’t notice Draco, and he hurries along the path to the gazebo at the far end before she can catch sight of him.
“Good,” Harry said. He took another sip of his coffee (and of course he was using Draco’s favorite mug, the grey one with the little cauldron painted on the side that was enchanted to bubble whenever the mug had something hot poured inside it) and leaned over to set the cup on the coffee table beside the tray, grabbed a biscuit from the plate and crammed the whole thing into his mouth, then fished out a file folder from his bag before he sat back.
Harry lost track of the conversation entirely as Malfoy’s thumb moved, stroking slowly up the inside of Harry’s knee, then back down, then up again. Harry’s breath caught, and he glanced over at Malfoy. But Malfoy was looking across the table at Ron, fully involved in their conversation, and gave no indication at all that he was aware what his thumb was doing.
“How is Dorothea?” Draco asks, partly because he wants to turn the conversation away from his fictitious trip to Austria, but mostly because he’s been gone for a few days and he’s wondering if he’s missed any gossip.
Getting his hand on Draco’s cock again felt like coming home, the hard length nearly as familiar in his hand as his own, hot and a little damp against his palm. Draco whimpered when Harry took his hand away and broke the kiss just long enough to lick his hand. He took Draco’s cock in his fist again and rubbed his thumb over the head before giving it a little squeeze.
Draco grabbed him by the shirt collar and yanked him over the threshold, Harry tripping over his own feet and nearly taking them both down. Draco managed to get the door shut and then Harry was pushing him up against it and kissing him again and the first brush of his tongue against Draco’s had Draco moaning. He clutched at Harry’s hips, slipped his fingers under the hem of Harry’s shirt and swept them up his back, and his brain nearly melted because he was finally touching and it felt every bit as good as he’d dreamed it would. Harry’s back beneath his palms was smooth and warm, leanly muscled, and Draco pulled him closer. He was starting to get hard, and when Harry slotted his thigh between Draco’s legs, Draco couldn’t help rubbing up against it.
“I know that,” Draco said, and he did know. Even if Harry hadn’t told him bits and pieces over the years, he still had his own store of experience to draw from. “There was a war on, I know how it was. But, people were always talking about you, weren’t they, and all the grand adventures you had. There must have been some part of it that wasn’t life or death. There must have been some part of it that was fun.”
They eat in silence, and then Potter puts on the wireless and hums a little to himself as they do the washing up. When Draco’s down to scouring the last pan, Potter puts on the kettle. Draco rinses the pan and takes up Potter’s abandoned tea towel, wipes it dry, and goes to put it away in the cupboard.
“We’ve been waiting for an hour,” Ron complained, waving his wand to release the charms keeping breakfast hot and fresh.
Draco huffs a small laugh. He understands all about humouring one’s mother. “Well, a little luck never hurt anyone,” he says, handing over the paper bag with the potions inside. “Thank you very much.”
Harry doesn’t like this question any better than the last, but maybe if he gives Malfoy something, he’ll shut up. So he says, “I’ve got this talent thing. I can sort of smell other people’s magical signatures. Not smell, exactly, but I think I sense ‘em in the same way as I smell things or hear things or touch things. Just know it, I guess.” He glances at Malfoy to find him staring back at Harry with wide eyes. Harry turns back to the road, swallowing uncomfortably. “Anyway, suppose that’s why they wanted me. Nice skill for a Hit Wizard to have, knowing he’s got the right person before he kills ‘em.”
“And off-putting,” Draco cut him off. “I’ve no idea why you thought the bedroom of all places would be a good place to display it.”
Draco’s smile turned indolent. “So you do know the rules.” His eyes slipped half-closed and he looked up at Harry from beneath his lashes.
“Yes,” Draco says. “I explained our relationship, and I.” He clears his throat. “Well. It’s a lot to take in, isn’t it? I thought it best to give him a bit of space right now.”
They’re quiet as they pass through the Leaky Cauldron and out into Muggle London. This isn’t the first time Draco’s been out of the wizarding sections of the city. He’s passed through a handful of times in his adolescence, and he’d just been again with Potter when they went shopping and then met the estate agent to look for a house. But it’s worse, now, than it was then. It’s busier on a Thursday evening, and it’s loud and overwhelming and there are Muggles absolutely everywhere, hurrying this way and that. Some of them are holding odd little rectangles of metal to their ears or poking at them in their hands and they’re not watching where they’re going. He nearly collides with one, jumps out of the way and knocks into another.
Things are different now, and it’s so hard for Draco keep that in mind when they’re like this, settled into the easy routine of cleaning up the kitchen together. He nearly reaches out to steady himself against Potter’s back as he leans around him to grab a tea towel, but he snatches his hand back just in time. They haven’t touched each other at all since Draco woke Potter up after his nap on the sofa, and Draco’s a little afraid to try, now. He tries not to think of the look on Potter’s face when he’d seen Draco, but sometimes it pops into Draco’s head unbidden.
Harry finished with the file and shut it, then stood up from his desk and went round to Ron’s cubicle. He kept it marginally more organised than Harry kept his own, but it was a far more cheerful sort of chaos, with loads of pictures of Hermione and his family crowded onto his desk, and about a dozen colourful crayon drawings from his nieces and nephews tacked to the drab grey walls alongside wanted posters and photographs of crime scenes.
Potter gropes for his hand among the bedsheets, finds it and grips tight. “I’m so glad you’re okay.”
There’s a good chance that this is going to get him nowhere but dead. But he’s come so far at this point that there’s nowhere to go but onward.
“I guess,” Potter says slowly. “I…” He pauses, gives Draco another strange look. “Do you, er, want to kiss me?”
“Also,” Harry went on quickly when Ginny cocked back her arm with another banana chunk in hand and gave him a threatening look, “Ginny is far too good for me, and more radiant than a thousand suns, with lips like rose petals and very nice hair that does that pretty wavy-flippy thing at the end when it’s short, and, erm, eyes that… don’t need glasses because they’re not shit like mine, and—hey, Gin! Stop, I was saying nice things about you!” The second piece of banana bounced off Harry’s chin and rolled away under the cabinet.
He never thought he’d be in a kitchen, cooking dinner with Pansy Parkinson. It’s odd, but in a nice sort of way, how relaxed this feels. And the fact that he hasn’t yet seen Pansy wear anything but Muggle clothes, and Draco still hasn’t quite wrapped his head around the fact that she’s dating Luna Lovegood, of all people. But her happiness is a deep and steady thing, and Draco thinks that he’s probably all right with this being his new normal.
Arthur had gone into the sitting room with the newspaper, and Ron, exhausted from a full day of Auror training and preparing for another one tomorrow, had gone off to bed. Everyone else had gone home, and the Burrow was dim and quiet when Harry followed Molly into the kitchen and took up a tea towel to dry off the dishes as she washed them.
makes Draco feel better, so much so that for one ridiculous moment, he’s tempted to open the door just so he can slam it again. Instead, he slumps against it and looks around the room. It’s barren aside from the stack of boxes piled unsteadily in one corner. He takes out his wand, finds the box labelled ‘furniture and fixtures,’ and gets to work.
He’s in love, and it feels like flying and falling all at once. It feels like the first time he’d pulled off a Wronski Feint, elation and panic blurring together as the ground hurtled up at him, and Draco holding onto his broomstick for dear life, feeling as though it’s out of his hands and he’s just along for the ride.
The size and shape of the wounds is disturbingly familiar. There’s a puncture wound on the man’s chest, and another in his stomach, and one more in his thigh. There are two more wounds, deep slashes to his other thigh and his upper arm. Glancing blows, Draco realises with a start. That’s what those cuts he wakes up with are. Someone’s been shooting at him this whole time.
Draco thought Harry was a strong person. He respected Harry, and treated him as an equal and, come to think of it, that was probably a large part of the reason they’d got on so well in bed. They’d approached each other as equals, and for all that they bickered they also respected each other deep down, and everything had sort of fallen into place from there.
There’s a perfectly timed crack of thunder that exactly matches the way his heart jolts at Ron’s words.
“Well. If you don’t find the lube for me, you’ll be getting down on your knees anyhow to finish sucking me off. So quite frankly I don’t see what difference it makes to you,” Draco says imperiously, folding his arms over his chest. His trousers choose that moment to lose their grip on his knees and they fall down around his ankles with a soft
Potter rolls his eyes. “Neither of us,” he says decisively, and oh Merlin, Draco knows that look on his face as well. “You know what? We’re both adults. We can share a bed for a night without it being a,” He gestures vaguely, “a
“But that’s….” Draco says, staring down at the tickets. “Potter, that’s two months away.” With two more full moons between now and then. “I might not…”
After a moment, he gathers his wits enough to think to check the cage. Did they eat something they shouldn’t have? Perhaps a poisoned mouse? It’s the only explanation Draco can think of to explain what’s just happened. But an inspection of the cage doesn’t provide any explanation. Aside from a scattering of feathers in the bottom, it’s clean.
Draco slapped him lightly on the shoulder. “Don’t be crude,” he said. “And ugh, don’t talk about my mother and blowjobs. You’re ruining the mood.”
The Aurors are forced to lower the Anti-Apparition Wards they’d layered over the warehouse in order to transport the injured to St Mungo’s. The condition of several of the Aurors is dire enough that they don’t have time to make it to the designated Apparition Point they’d left around the side of the building and they have to disable the entire bloody thing. And of course as soon as they do, four distinct cracks of Apparition come from deeper in the warehouse.
And then on the other side, there’s Malfoy. Regular Malfoy. Quidditch-playing Malfoy. Nose-stomping Malfoy. The very same Malfoy who, ten years previous, told Harry he’d rather stick his prick in a blender than be Harry’s Auror partner, and who’d subsequently left Harry both horrified and intensely intrigued that Malfoy knew what a blender was and the destruction one could cause to a man’s more delicate of appendages.
“Yes, but.” Draco stared at him. This was still Harry, it shouldn’t disconcert him as it did to see him sitting at his desk. But he just looked so bloody
“No, he usually doesn’t,” Draco says. Fuck, he’d forgotten entirely about Potter this morning in his rush to be seen to at St Mungo’s and get back before the shop opened. “Did he say how I should contact him?” Given what Potter had seen, Draco doesn’t think this is a conversation he’d like to have down at the Ministry, but he doesn’t want to turn up at Potter’s house unexpected and unannounced.
They take their broomsticks up, and good Merlin, Weasley wasn’t exaggerating when he said that Granger could barely hold on. She’s wobbling alarmingly and is holding her broomstick in a deathgrip. Fleur and Angelina both Charm sparkling circles of light into the air for hoops, Percy keeps the hard rubber practise Bludger in a firm grip, and Ginny Levitates the Quaffle.
, what a day it’s been. Work was impossible, and the moment I get home, Molly shows up with practically an entire florist’s shop. I’ve honestly no idea how she managed to get it all through the Floo. You’re lucky that as best man you haven’t got to deal with any of this nonsense.” She frowned at Harry, brow creasing in a look that was more amused than sceptical. “Who on earth are you supposed to be?”
“You know, I’m sort of tempted to,” Harry sighed, staring idly up at the ceiling. He’d never noticed that crack before. Had that always been there? “I bet McGalliard would have a fit if I did. It’d almost be worth getting docked a couple of points.”
It occurs to him just then that Katie’s got a Durmstrang education, and he really doesn’t care to find out firsthand whether the rumours about all the Dark Arts they learn there are accurate.
Harry’s mouth had gone dry. He swallowed and shook his head. “Nothing. Never mind. I…” He smiled a little sheepishly and flattened a hand over his hair. “Sorry. Lost my train of thought.”
But as far as he could tell, right now it was just him and this bloke, whom Harry presumed to be Desmond Dwyer.
Potter visibly reins in his anger. Takes a deep breath and says, “Look, I know you’re probably not thrilled to be working with me. I’m not thrilled about it either—”
He’d only just finished when Celene tapped lightly on the door and pushed it open. “He’s here,” she said.
"You want this," Malfoy said intently while Harry's brain was still whirling uselessly. "Potter, I know you want this."
“Not landed in the middle of a field of geese,” Pansy snaps, then turns to Draco. “Did you know that when geese take flight, they shit?” Her mouth presses into a thin line, and she adds darkly, “Because they do, Draco. They do.”
, neither of them want to risk using the table, or even sitting down on chairs. They eat quickly and without speaking, and in no time at all they’re finished.
It’s on the tip of his tongue to argue that how would the neighbours notice? Then he thinks of Dorothea, who spends her whole day glued to her front window, and promptly shuts his mouth again.
Things are a little awkward between them for the next few days, and Draco has no idea how much of it is coming from Zelda, and how much of it is from Zelda picking up on his own awkwardness and not knowing how to respond to it. But they fall easily back into their routine, and then everything is back to normal. Days pass into weeks. Summer withers away as the weather turns cool. The leaves burst into riotous colour, and things continue on.
The damp tip of Draco’s cock poked at Harry’s stomach, and he reached down to give it a squeeze. Draco made a small breathy noise and batted Harry’s hand away, only to wriggle around until he could get his cock lined up against Harry’s. He moved slowly, pushing the hard length of his cock against Harry’s, and Harry quietly lost his mind. He loved this, feeling Draco so hard against him, and knowing that it was for him, it was all for him, and he was right where Draco wanted him to be, doing exactly what Draco wanted him to do. All he had to do was sit here and be good, and let Draco use him as he wished.
Some ingredients are easier to find substitutes for than others, of course, but Draco gets lucky with the Pepper-Up, and it only takes him a few evenings of tinkering around in his back room to discover that he can swap in ordinary cow’s horn that was harvested beneath a full moon, and tweak some of the other ingredients. Cow’s horn is a common ingredient, so Draco adds in just a dash of ground runespoor scales to make up the magical deficit, and there he’s got it. It’s not quite as effective as traditionally-brewed Pepper-Up, but it works well enough that the grateful witch told her friends, and now word’s spread around enough that Draco’s taking in at least two or three custom orders each week, enough that he’s started spending his one day off per week down in his potions lab, working through complex magical equations and keeping an eye on his simmering cauldrons.
“Warm bedding when it’s cold is one of life’s greatest pleasures,” Draco said. “Don’t tell me you’ve been denying yourself all these years.”
For some reason this struck Draco as the funniest thing he’d heard in a long time, even though it was perfectly true. “Well,” he managed between bursts of laughter, “at least it’ll be bad for both of us? Misery loves company and all that?”
“Yeah, well, you’re an idiot too, then. We’re both idiots, happy? It was nobody’s fault, and it won’t happen again,” Harry said and turned away, grabbed his jeans from last night off the floor and a clean pair of pants and jumper from his dresser. “I’m going to shower.”
Harry opened his mouth to answer, then saw the way Ron was watching him, and closed his mouth again. “It’s been. Erm. A few months, I guess,” he said carefully.
They’re in Harry’s cupboard under the stairs. Harry knows objectively that it’d be a tight squeeze for two grown men to fit in here, but from this deep inside Harry’s memory it feels larger than it ought to, like he’s as small as a child again. It’s exactly the same, from the thin, lumpy pallet the Dursleys had crammed in here for him to sleep on, to the small stack of clothes folded into clumsy little squares and stacked as neatly as a small boy could manage, to the handful of broken toys he’d quietly rescued from the bin and stashed away in the deepest corner of his cupboard.
Potter snickers. “That’s the advantage of teaching grown-ups,” he says. “Also, I’m not above threatening them with laps if they provoke my headache.”
Malfoy huffed a little, and muttered, “But also the tufting,” and didn’t give Harry a chance to respond before he fed his cock back into Harry’s body and resumed thrusting. Harry hooked a hand behind his knee and pulled it up, spreading himself wide open. Malfoy wasn’t hitting his prostate anymore, but this position left him with his hands free. He pushed one of them between their bodies and wrapped his fingers around his cock, and in no time at all he was nearly there again.
Draco sighs and selects his clothes for the day, then opens his door and peeks out into the hall. The bathroom door stands open and the lights are off. Potter’s door is still shut, so Draco slips out into the hall and goes into the bathroom to get ready first.
“What’s going on?” Potter asks, and Draco has to tell him. He can’t let Potter go on believing this. He never should have lied to him in the first place.
“Yeah, it was,” Ron said flatly. “And yet you still went out of your way to collect evidence against Malfoy—”
With the end of the year fast approaching, with Dumbledore still alive and the Vanishing Cabinet still broken, Draco hasn’t got time to waste rebrewing potions. His parents’ lives hang in the balance, and the scales will be tipped by his success or his failure. And right now he’s stuck here rebrewing a bloody Percipience Potion because Pansy fucked up in class, and Draco wasn’t paying close enough attention to stop her.
“I’m the Chosen One?” Harry tried. Malfoy gave him a flat look, and Harry sighed, defeated. “Fine. We’ll stay at your flat.”
“Trying to feel for a fever, hold still,” Potter says and nearly clocks Draco in the face, and then Draco grudgingly submits and allows Potter to press his wrist to Draco’s head because it’s easier for everyone this way. “Well, you don’t seem warm.”
Draco and Granger trail after them at a safe distance as Ginny drags Potter over to the kitchen and shoves him through the doorway.
They were out in a bar this time. Harry and Hermione liked to try a new place each time they went out, and Ron very indulgently went along with it. This one was a little more club-ish than they usually aimed for, darker and with loud music that meant they had to raise their voices to be heard.
“Hush, Ron,” she says, taking her book away from him and waving him off. “I’m making polite conversation with a guest.”
“You’re not helpless,” Ron tells him. “You’re doing fine. You just need a bit of reminding from time to time. Nobody blames you for it. We all understand.”
Draco gave a small hum of pleasure, and a moment later his mouth went slack around Harry’s cock. His hand stroked once, twice more, and then he groaned as he climaxed, his come splashing across Harry’s ankle. Draco blinked and mumbled something unintelligible, his tongue curling under the head of Harry’s cock, and he rubbed the top of Harry’s foot apologetically.
Draco screams, and then there’s Potter right in front of him, eyes wide, reaching out. Draco staggers to the side, shoving him away, screams again, and—
“I need to get out,” he says again, and then he’s going for the door and he doesn’t stop when Draco calls after him, and then he’s gone.
Harry doesn’t know whether it’s the overwhelming self-hatred he suddenly has for himself at seeing this place and remembering the time when he was a
“Coffee,” Draco said, looking up just in time to catch Harry disappearing through the doorway. A second later, the light switched on, casting a block of light across the wood floor.
It says something about Potter’s state of mind that he just sighs and nods, accepting that explanation easily. “Just for tonight.” He digs in his bag, pulling out jars and bottles and vials, and entire stock of healing potions. “We’ll get you fixed up and call it a night, yeah?”
And so he does, and he comes back with a file full of information, a picture paperclipped to the inside cover and then pages of facts, everything Potter could come up with, a name and an address and a birthday and a list of surviving family members, schools, occupations, past lovers and current friends.
Draco’s control is slipping, he feels like he’s barely able to control himself, slamming himself into Potter over and over. “Slut,” he gasps. “You’re such a slut, but you’re mine. You’re mine, fuck.”
Something cold and terrified washes through Harry. Because he’s never seen Blood Magic performed, only ever witnessed the gruesome aftermath when it goes wrong. Clasping Harry’s hand tightly in both of his, Malfoy fires off a rapid stream of Latin that Harry’s horrified brain can’t keep up with. He catches the words
“Most of them. Three of them,” Potter says. “Thirty years in Azkaban each. The last one got away, plus the potions expert they brought in. Fled the country, as far as we can tell.” He sighs, shifts uncomfortably. Uncrosses his ankles and crosses them again the other way.
“Wait, wait,” Malfoy pants. He lunges for the edge of the bed, snags the top drawer of the bedside table with his fingertips, and jerks it open. He pulls out a tube of lube and shoves it at Harry. “Use that.”
“Put away the bloody paper,” he commands. He has no idea why he ever wanted someone around who wasn’t afraid to push back against him, because this is bloody infuriating, and why won’t she just do as he says?
missed catching wind of this? Potter flushes pink and dumps his handful of coins all over the counter in a great clatter.
“Make it part of your character,” Ron said from where he was sprawled comfortably on the end of Harry’s sofa, bottle of beer dangling loosely from one hand. “Whatsisname can be sort of clumsy. Plenty of people are clumsy.”
Or, he’d assumed everyone else had left. When he stepped out, towel clutched around his waist, he found Draco fussing with his hair in front of one of the mirrors. Ignoring him, Harry stomped over to his locker and got his clothes out, dropped his towel and quickly pulled them on.
—has sunk in deep, swelling up so big inside you that you feel you can’t contain it, warmth and shivery excitement spiked with sharp bursts of fear that he’s wrong, what if he’s wrong?
“I guess so,” Malfoy says. Harry thinks this’ll be the end of it it, but then Malfoy says, “How many people did you say you’ve slaughtered?”
He loved this, the way Draco’s body felt, but also knowing that he was inside another person, that he was inside
Draco still had another handful of folders to work through, but getting through those ledger pages had sapped his motivation to continue on with the rest down to nearly nothing. At least he’d got through the worst of it, and could come in to face the rest of these files with a clear mind. A quick flip through them assured him that it was mostly sales invoices and packing lists from deliveries, and those weren’t bad at all.
Pansy heaves a put-upon sigh. “Let me guess,” she says, pressing her fingers to her temples like she’s having a vision. She used to do the same thing at Hogwarts when she mocked Trelawney. “You came here… with Potter… on his motorbike.”
The paste has to sit for five minutes while the wound stops bleeding, and Zelda cleans the blood from his face and hair, and carefully wets a cloth with Anti-Septic and cleans the scratch, then dabs a little smear of the Coagulating Paste onto his scalp. That cut isn’t as deep and doesn’t hurt as much, and the slight pain of it is enough to distract from the throbbing agony of his arm.
“Just know, is all,” Potter tells him. “They’ve never led me wrong before. Now seriously, shut the fuck up.”
mean, which I’m not assuming you…” He trailed off when he felt Malfoy trembling against him, and it took him a second to work out that Malfoy was laughing silently. “Oh, fuck off,” he grumbled, jamming an elbow into Malfoy's side.
“So,” said Harry. “Let me get this straight. You figured out you missed me and wanted to have a relationship with me, so you got Pansy to get Hermione to set us up, then suggested to me we carry on a fake relationship which involved real dates, so that you could try to make me fall in love with you for real somewhere along the line of pretending to have feelings for each other.”
All Harry knew for sure was that Malfoy kept the Manor in good repair, paid his taxes each year, and so far as anyone could tell, didn’t venture out in public at all.
“Oh,” Harper said. “Well, this can just be a drink between friends, if you’d rather. It doesn’t need to be anything more than that.”
“Give up, Malfoy!” he shouted from his temporary bunker. “You’re just making this harder on yourself.”
he types back quickly, fingers flying over the touchscreen so fast that it autocorrects to something completely unintelligible four times before he slows down enough to type properly.
“And honestly, when would I have the time?” Malfoy asks. “Or the energy, for that matter. You wear me out, Scarhead.”
“Now we do our jobs and finish with these bloody trunks,” Malfoy said. He picked up one of the paper envelopes layered with protective charms they’d been given for anything that might pose a threat. He enlarged it with a tap of his wand, picked up the handfasting cords and slipped them inside, sealed it, labeled it, and tossed it in the evidence box. Then he lifted a silver cigarette case out of the trunk.
them. And I certainly don’t want one in my ear.” He holds it up to his face, squinting at it. “This is really clockwork?”
keeps him dry as he walks to the park where, sure enough, he finds Potter in the gazebo. He’s sprawled across the floor of it, limbs akimbo and soaking wet. Merlin, how dramatic.
Jameson fished in his pockets and pulled out a tattered paperback. “Go on, then. I’ll just wait here for another twenty or so before leaving. That’s enough time, right?”
Potter glances at him over his shoulder. “Tea?” he asks instead of responding to Draco’s ridiculous observation with something like,
Ron held out his elbows—of the three of them, he was the best at Blind Apparition—and Harry and Malfoy each took an arm. Harry took a moment to cast a temporary ward around the shop, and then they were gone.
“A bit of time, my arse,” Potter says. “I know how complicated the spellwork on the motorcycle is. This must have taken you days to get done.”
With a small sigh, he turns back to stare out the window. It’s pointless to think about these things. This is the path his life has taken. It won’t do him any good to ponder what other paths he might have gone down.
“Merlin,” he breathes, pressing one hand to his mouth and dropping the stack of photos onto the table. That was certainly not a Veela. Draco has no idea what the fuck that was. He shudders, and the wounds on his back throb.
Harry’s throat goes tight at the thought of Malfoy, and between one blink and the next he’s suddenly standing in the tiny Auror break room with a spoon in his hand, a soggy tea bag balanced on it.
“No, most are a lot better than him. But there’s arseholes in every bunch,” he grumbled, taking another look over his shoulder. The man was still staring.
But Draco hadn’t grown up with Molly, and Mediwitch Marigold had this intensely disapproving stare that made him feel about five years old and two inches tall, so Draco did his best to keep himself firmly on her good side.
Draco blinks, and stares. Oh. He bought the pyjama bottoms in the first place because the fabric felt so soft and drapey, and he loves them because they’re every bit as comfortable as he thought they’d be. But hey, look at that, he can see every detail of his cock outlined very clearly through the thin fabric, right down to which way it’s pointing and that he’s not circumcised.
Draco pulled a face at him, even though he was being very pointedly ignored. He indulged in a bit of sulking as he finished up his scone, but mostly ended up sneaking glances across the desks at Harry. His tee-shirt, which had already been somewhat stretched-out from years of use, was even looser on his thin frame, looking very close to the sort of shirts he used to wear back in school. With some minor changes to the setting, Harry looked like he was taken straight out of Draco’s Hogwarts memories, bent over a stack of parchments in the library, laboring over homework or studying hard for an exam. Something about it made Draco’s stomach give a persistent little tug, and he looked away.
His arm is still around Draco, Potter’s elbow propped up atop the side of the bathtub, his hand loosely curled around Draco’s bicep in a way that feels both exhausted and strangely possessive.
He’s not thrilled to be hanging about the murder basement any longer than necessary, but Malfoy is incredibly—sometimes, maddeningly—thorough in his work. They start at the north wall, then make their way east, south, and west, weaving in and out of rooms. Malfoy even casts an array of diagnostic spells and sensing charms over the collection of ancient canned foods, even though in Harry’s opinion they obviously don’t contain anything more threatening than a horrible case of botulism, which is easily avoided so long as they’re not stupid enough to try to eat any of them.
Of course, the lift chose that moment to arrive, slamming to a halt before them. The grille clattered back, and just in case either of them had managed to miss all of that commotion, a second later the lift gave a cheerful little
Not that they'd never been alone together before, but Harry sometimes had a difficult time convincing himself that just because Malfoy clearly had no sort of romantic interest in him and just because nothing had ever happened any of the other times they'd been alone together before, that this time wouldn't be different.
Still grumbling, Ron got a second knife from the drawer and came up next to Harry to help. They quickly fell into a rhythm, with Ron trimming the leaves from each berry before passing it to Harry, who cut it into neat slices.
“That depends,” Draco says, and is pleased by how light and casual he sounds. “Did you check for fireworks tonight?”
It feels as though he’s barely closed his eyes when he comes awake, baffled for a moment as to why until he hears it again: a soft murmur from Potter’s end of the tent. He turns onto his back in a gentle rustle of sheets and then keeps very still, listening. There’s another soft rustle of sheets from Potter’s bed, then a half-strangled moan.
Despite knowing that he desperately needed one, Draco had initially been reluctant to hire an assistant for the shop. He’d put it off as long as he realistically could, wary of having someone he didn’t know from Merlin in his shop, in his routine, in his life. Dorothea complains often about whoever’s most recent in the seemingly-endless parade of shop assistants she hires. He’d been understandably hesitant about hiring one of his own.
Potter kisses him, hard and hungry, and Draco melts into it. Lets himself go limp and pliant, lets Potter take control. They’re both fully hard by the time they get undressed and on the bed. Potter stretches out on his back and Draco begins to straddle his hips, but at the last moment he turns so he’s facing away from Potter.
“I know,” Malfoy says and turns away, because he knows that if Harry’s reduced to whining, the conversation’s over.
laugh; mouth open, eyes squeezed shut, head thrown back—and Ron looked surprised for a moment before he laughed, too. And in that moment, Harry felt like this was really something he could have. That the past three weeks had been the beginning of something wonderfully real. The quiet evenings spent studying together in Malfoy’s flat, falling asleep each night to the soft sound of Malfoy breathing beside him, waking up each morning to sheets warmed by their shared body heat. How their lives had slowly begun to entangle, how Harry’s favorite mug had its own place in Malfoy’s kitchen cupboard, his books stacked together with Malfoy’s on the shelf, his clothes in Malfoy’s wardrobe and their toothbrushes in the same cup by the bathroom sink. It wasn’t much, not yet, but it was enough to make it easy for Harry to envision
“That too,” Draco agreed, and then his smile edged into a smirk. “See? I gave you that one. Look how generous I am.”
“Mm, yeah,” Potter sighs. “It’s just… I really shouldn’t have done it like that. My leg hurts now.” He rolls halfway onto his side and peeks up at Draco through his dark fringe. “Would you rub it for me?”
