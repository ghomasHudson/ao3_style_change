“I rather got the impression it’s Sirius’ fault they’re not on speaking terms. I brought his reply for you to read; I’m not sure where you want to go from here.” He wished he could enjoy them finally being civilised with each other. He wished he could fully take in the phenomenon of her coming to his flat like this. But all he could think about was that man’s faced overlaid on hers. They weren’t just similar; they were
‘I’ve just finished Paris fashion week and I’m hanging around for a while, catching up with old faces, trying to wrangle some collab deals for next season. You know the score.’ Blaise went into modelling after Hogwarts and had taken the muggle fashion industry by storm with his cleverly tailored clothes which really were one-size-fits-all. Of course, that was because they were all charmed to adjust to the individual’s body shape, but the muggles didn’t know that. He was particularly popular among plus size and maternity demographics, because his clothes adapted with their owners. Draco was convinced that muggles couldn’t be quite that stupid, but maybe he wasn’t appreciative enough of how vain some people could be. Yes, the irony of that statement wasn’t lost on him.
‘I really need to go; my lunch hour is up.’ They kiss each other’s cheeks and Hermione makes her way over to the lifts while Draco heads for the ministry floo. The food in the atrium really was always terrible.
“There you are!” Luna floated into the room wearing a long blue kaftan mottled with orange hues. Despite her summary aesthetic, there were small pumpkins with grinning faces dangling from her ears; a nod to the time of year.
“I know you’re in love with him.”
How much isolation can the human consciousness withstand before it starts to deteriorate? How long on average does the neurotypical prisoner survive before being slowly eaten alive from the inside, driven mad by the inner thought? These questions are not ones that Draco could answer, although he would’ve liked to have studied the concept while he had the chance.
‘The portraits took offense when they started speaking fluent French at me and I didn’t have a clue what they were saying.’
When he returned to the drawing room his friends weren’t there, but he quickly found them in the sitting room across the hall that was much smaller and cosier. They had ordered tea from the house elves and were sitting in an almost perfect circle waiting for him. It was strange seeing them all together, and even stranger having so many people in the Manor at once. If his mother were here, she’d have been ecstatic.
‘Do you need anything?’ Harry asked him. Draco paused for a second but decided he’d deal with the consequences later.
He needed to get back downstairs as it was already approaching the hour mark and he needed to take the Polyjuice and more Pepper-up before he left.
Once it had, he was engulfed in a raging fire of pain. It sizzled through his nerve endings and fried his capacity for any deep thought. He gritted his teeth to keep from crying out as he felt like someone had set him on fire. What the hell happened? He didn’t remember a thing after Hermione had left.
‘I know darling, I know. But she has us, doesn’t she? And we can be there for her even if they can’t. Would I be a terrible person if I said I’m relieved? I’m not ready to say goodbye to her.’ Harry pulled away from him and gave him an odd look that Draco couldn’t place.
‘Oh Draco. No, no, no, don’t think that. Of course you’re a good person. Haven’t you seen it? Look at how close you are to Teddy, he adores you. Look at all the people around you who would drop everything for you. You don’t even realise how important your input at the orphanage has been. I know it’s hard to let go of all the things you love to do, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do those things again. You just have to trust that it’ll work out so long as you let go.’
But then Potter was there. “Shhh, shhh. I’m staying here, ok? Just here.” He pointed to the sofa and as if by some miracle Draco did shush. Potter continued as Draco stood there in shock, “I’m going to stay here until morning and then we’re going to take you home, okay?” If a fox could blush, Draco would have. He’d never seen this side of Potter before; didn’t even know it existed. There was nothing else to do but go to the bed Potter had made for him and wait it out until he could figure out how to change himself back again. Even if he knew how, which he didn’t, he couldn’t very well change into his human form right in front of Potter. Could he, if he tried? He doubted it.
‘I knew you could do it!’ Teddy exclaimed once they’d made out the back.
he thought.
‘Excellent. Well, this isn’t strictly hospital policy,’ the healer began, looking around as if checking to make sure no one could hear, even though they were in a private room. Yeah, Draco
It was fortuitous that Draco hadn’t managed to lift the wards Harry had set because whilst a shower was a great way to disguise the physical appearance of tears, nothing could disguise the sounds of his sobs. Especially not since he’d left his wand in the bedroom where he’d apparated to.
‘It’s a stupid medal anyway,’ he muttered grumpily.
“So,” Malfoy begins brusquely after he has poured their tea, “what kind of help is it that you need?”
‘I see.’ He choked. He snatched up the half-destroyed paper and turned to leave. The air was thick, and his head spun with hurt and confusion. Had he really just been a charity case these past couple of months? He’d thought they’d been adjusting as well as possible considering the circumstances…
He pushed the door open slowly and was surprised to find that this room was as dark as any other. The only light slipping in came through a gap in the curtains, casting a patchwork of moonlight across the hardwood floor. Harry’s study was the one part of the house Draco had had no input in designing. It was hard to see the contents of the room by moonlight, but he knew and remembered with fondness that Harry had covered the far wall with hundreds of photographs of Draco, Teddy and himself in a random combination of wizard and muggle shots. Mostly taken by Draco who had taken up photography some years ago.
‘The stories are always better when you read them.’ She stopped and looked around the messy room. ‘I tried to stop it, but I don’t know how.’ He eyes glittered with tears and he could see she didn’t understand what had happened.
“Fine.” Better to play the piano and make Pansy happy than sit around and get more wound up.
‘I don’t deserve you,’ he whispered into Teddy’s hair.
Smith had a point though. Draco would be beside himself if he knew Harry was hurt and he didn’t know what to do about it. He would be angry if Harry had been getting sick and not telling him.
‘Do you remember when I told you all about your how your dad and my dad were troublemakers at school?’ Harry asked him. He nodded eagerly. ‘Well, they also made this. It’s a map of the school that tells you where everyone in the castle is at all times. It used to show you secret passages to get out of the school – like the one-eyed witch passage you could take to get to Honeydukes. They were mostly closed after the war though. We thought you might like to have it since you’re the last descendant of a Marauder. I don’t really need it now, do I?’
Harry’s hand had stilled in the fox’s fur while he thought, and it didn’t like no longer being centre of attention. It sat up and began whining again. Taking his life in his hands once more, Harry dared to lift the animal up and carry it through the doorway. It hissed and spat at him, clawing at his arms and leaving angry red welts.
cute,’ Harry whined, and it reminded Draco of Ella.
Draco made a point to go to Hermione’s office just before their regular lunchtime catch-up that day. He wanted to go somewhere outside the Ministry so that he could talk to her in relative privacy.
So, he had spent the last month brewing a batch of Polyjuice Potion instead. It was right where he left it under stasis. It was missing the hair Granger promised to provide, but he wouldn’t need that until tomorrow. The potion had finished brewing yesterday and he had neglected clearing up after himself which he did so now as a distraction.
‘Hermione,’ he said gently, taking her small hand in his large one. ‘We could sit here and shift blame all day, but it won’t change anything and it won’t make either of us feel any better. What’s done is done and all we can do is learn from it.’ She smiled at him warmly.
“I suppose I could slow down a bit. But just know you can’t police what I eat, Potter! It’s not my fault your taste buds are terrible…” He looked at Harry with that haughty expression that used to make Harry want to punch him in the face, but now makes him laugh.
Draco had had a job working for a potion developer for the past two years, but even before he’d decided to move to France, he’d thought his superiors were making a mug of him. Draco’s potions were available in a lot of the top apothecaries, but he never got any credit for his work. He’d supply the firm with all his new formulae and in return the company provided him with a lab and the most up-to-date equipment. Except, they never ever gave him any credit. That’s why he’d kept his greatest achievement secret.
‘Trust me Granger, I have no intention of going near
‘Well, it’s common for magic to become a little unsettled after a divorce. Mostly because the bond you forged when you got married linked your magic together. Often it only lasts a few months and isn’t really noticeable, but between you having been a horcrux and Draco taking the dark mark, you two aren’t exactly the common example.’
‘I told them not to contact me under any circumstances. I specifically said I was going away for a family emergency and they were to contact literally anyone else. Why can’t people just listen? Just because this whole thing was my idea doesn’t mean I know everything about everything!’ He picked up his wine glass which had been left untouched and downed it like water.
‘Right. I mean, I wouldn’t normally check up on you, I know how you feel about it. Harry can check for magical signatures interfering with the wards though, so I figured better safe than sorry.’ She explained as she drank the last of her tea.
‘Yeah, yeah, you’re my favourite sausage. Now you have to let me go. I’ll be back later I promise.’ He gave the two little monkeys one last squeeze and let them go.
‘I’m very well thank you. Harry said you weren’t feeling well yourself?’ Draco nodded. Harry hadn’t told her the nature of Draco’s illness as they referred to it around here and it worked quite nicely since many of the kids assumed that Draco was among the muggle staff who worked here.
‘Pardon?’ He took a large swig of his tea and for once wished he took sugar. It was bitter again.
Draco stares at him in utter disbelief. “Are you kidding me?! My twin is out there somewhere,
‘No Ted, it’s not selfish. Hogwarts is a really big thing for you and Harry knows that. I’m sure he doesn’t mean it. Have you told him?’
“What? They just let you walk in and take Potter’s wand?!”
‘I was not aware Mr Potter would be joining us, Minister.’ Draco said coldly. Any excuse not to have to look at the git’s stupid face.
A few more seconds passed, and the decision only became more agonising. Before his mind had really settled on an option, he was turning the handle and stepping into the room. Being in the room a second time alone made the feeling more obvious. Like most old magical houses, there was latent magic all over the walls in Grimmauld Place. It thrummed in the background to the extent that it became part of the house, unnoticeable to most wizards. What made this room so different was that there was no magic at all. It wasn’t just the stillness of a mostly abandoned room, it was an absence of magic. The room was, not to put too fine a point on it, dead.
‘I don’t want you to live without it.’ Harry said determinedly. He wasn’t about to let Draco give up hope just yet.
“So what this is saying is, if we can get hold of Potter’s wand, it should be connected enough to him that we could create a living anchor on this side of the Veil and pull him back through?”
If Draco had told Potter the truth about how he really felt, would it have been enough to make him stay? Or would it only have tipped him over the edge sooner? Draco supposed most people wouldn’t want a failed Death Eater mooning over them. Why would Potter have been any different?
She let him drink a full glass of water before she tried to speak to him again. Draco had time to observe that although she was well put together wearing tailored robes trimmed with the brilliant red colour of the firm, her hair was even more frizzy than usual, and her cheeks were flushed.
‘Harry,’ he mumbled, not quite awake and not quite asleep.
‘I’m sorry Mr Malfoy, the Minister is fully booked all afternoon. Perhaps you should try asking for an appointment further in advance?’ Kingsley’s bitch of a secretary told Draco with an oversweet voice and a derogatory look.
‘Alright fine, I’ll floo call once a month.’ She looked at him incredulously and went to argue. ‘No, Hermione. Take what you’re given.’ She huffed at him but thought better of starting an argument.
‘She doesn’t even know my real name. I’m heading the project under an alias so that it doesn’t attract too much attention. I don’t want people to think I’m just doing it for the publicity. It’s all under the alias Albus Severus on both the muggle and the wizarding side of things.’ Draco physically winced, despite the accompanying pain.
‘No! No. That’s not what I want. I don’t want to practice dark magic. You can’t do this!’ He stood and ran for the door. Smith got there before him.
Harry to know? There had definitely been a moment at the open mic that Harry couldn’t explain, but Malfoy didn’t seem to want to talk about it, or even acknowledge it for that matter.
He picked up the vial of Polyjuice he had left on the table and trying not to think about the colour, downed it in one. Despite the number of times he had brewed it, he had never actually drunk it. It tasted like burnt caramel. A burning sensation radiated out from his stomach towards his fingers and toes as if he’d just swallowed acid. He fell to his hands and knees as his skin bubbled and shifted. His hands thickened in front of his face; his fingers shorter and hairier. His centre of gravity shifted – this muggle must have been a good few inches shorter than him. Presumably less conspicuous because of it.
As he opened his mouth to speak, she turned the page and her position shifted slightly. The long sleeve of a thick cable-knit jumper appeared as she changed her grip on the book so that she held it with two hands. Harry was distracted by the tiny freckle he noticed on her right palm, just between her thumb and her index finger. He didn’t realise it was possible to have freckles on one’s palm.
‘I get by with a little help from my friends.’ Harry sang totally off key but with great enthusiasm. He thought maybe this was the best Christmas morning so far and he hadn’t even gotten out of bed yet. He glanced at his bedside clock which read ten in the morning and he was genuinely impressed that Harry had managed to keep Teddy occupied for so long.
‘So long as who’s here?’ He asked. His own voice echoed the same way as Hermione’s. She was chanting in his head.
‘It’s fine.’ Harry smiled but there was a tightness in his expression that Draco couldn’t quite understand.
‘So, Ted, tell us all about Hogwarts.’ He and Harry exchanged nervous glances, unsure of what they might hear.
Harry didn’t like that very much. He pulled Draco into him like he was nothing more than a pile of feathers. Draco was assaulted with the signature cedar and grapefruit of Harry and engulfed in the warmth of his – mostly naked – body heat. Draco wanted to hold onto him for the rest of his life, but he knew that wasn’t healthy and it wasn’t the right thing to do. He’d done the wrong thing enough times to know that now. He had to tell Harry the truth.
‘Draco, please, maybe you should think about this. It's very sudden. Are you sure this is even what you want? At least let me do this with you.’ He couldn’t look him in the eye, but he did kiss him, so gently that his lips barely ghosted over Harry’s.
‘Draco, breathe, please. You’re losing control again. Reign it in.’ Draco’s breathing was ragged, and he took deep, gulping breaths. ‘Tell me why it doesn’t matter. This isn’t like you, I don’t understand. Help me understand.’ Draco didn’t know how to.
“No, no. It’s fine. You didn’t have to stay though, I’m fine.”
‘No. I have to do this for myself. If anything happens…you were an auror, you know what to do.’
“Quite right. Let me find you a room Remus, you can’t be going home now. You too Lyra, you’re welcome to stay in your usual room.” Sirius stood and the atmosphere broke. Harry suddenly felt bone tired as if getting everything off his chest had taken the last of his energy with it.
“Yeah…”
‘Thank you.’ He whispered. Teddy was grinning and waving frantically, and Draco managed to wave him off with a smile that was marginally less forced than he thought it would be. He focused on the feel of Harry’s hand in his own and at the very last second, Harry pulled Draco against his side and wrapped an arm around his waist.
He had no idea how long he’d been here, suspended in nothingness. A minute? An hour? A day? Weeks? He doesn’t remember what came before. He doesn’t have the energy to reach into his mind and find out. He doesn’t much care about what his name is or where he came from. He just wants to get out.
‘Haha, very funny. Shouldn’t I be asking you that?’ Teddy pouted adorably and Draco pulled him into a hug. ‘Are you feeling better?’
‘He can stay with me.’ Harry said immediately, and Draco’s heart skipped a beat at how enthusiastic Harry was about letting Draco back in what was supposed to be their family home.
‘So it is drugs. You’re disgusting. Do you have any idea how disgraceful it is to be on this stuff when you’re looking after our son?! How dare you? Where did you even get this stuff. If I’ve brought you in on an official Ministry case whilst you’ve been off cavorting with dark wizards I swear to God I’ll-’
‘What did your mind healer say when you told him about this? I thought you said you were supposed to see him every week…?’ Draco watched as Harry shrank their luggage and sent it on ahead. He was less envious of Harry’s magic now that he knew his own was still there lurking, but it did make him frustrated to know he was equally as capable of doing everything yet didn’t know how.
‘I didn’t catch that.’ Draco said, his eyes meeting Andromeda’s as she entered the drawing room to greet him. She seemed as astounded as Draco at Teddy’s unusual behaviour. Teddy lifted his head so that his face wasn’t squished against Draco and said much clearer.
Draco scoffed. ‘What, you think I’m going to tell you everything without knowing that? Are you a fool?’ He was being mean again, but what did he expect? Draco was a Slytherin after all, he knew all about self-preservation.
‘No! No, no! None of them were touched. I covered them in a bubble charm first. Actually, why didn’t I do that with everything else? That would’ve been the sensible thing to do.’ Draco let his head fall into his hands, his breakfast now abandoned.
“Granger…”
After a couple of minutes, he has a brain wave. “Can I have caput draconis?” He turns his head to find Harry staring at him. “What?”
“Of course, I shouldn’t have kept you so long, I’m sure you have very important auror-ing to do.” Harry wants to point out that auror-ing is definitely not a real word, but he supposes that next to Malfoy he doesn’t have a leg to stand on.
Harry frowns. Why would Malfoy think Harry was here because he was in trouble? Is Malfoy… up to something? Then it clicks that he’s wearing full auror robes which, incidentally, are far too heavy for the heat of the day, and he probably cuts a foreboding figure.
He was briefly aware of a voice, although it sounded like one long mumble, and he hoped he wasn’t supposed to know what they were saying since it hurt his head too much to think. The pain in his chest didn’t seem to be going away either, much to his dismay. It was the kind of pain that didn’t really hurt that much but caused an ache so deep it seeped into his bones and made him question if there was ever a time when he had lived without it.
‘Us.’ He said quietly, and Harry immediately felt bad. He often referred to Draco and ‘his’ baby and at first Draco had taken that to mean that Harry hadn’t wanted children but really, Harry only did it to avoid admitting how much he wanted it too. There was a hole in his heart every day that made him ache wanting to have a family with Draco and see Draco be happy. He held Draco impossibly tighter as if he might float away.
‘Harry?’ Draco asked him quietly. He was facing away from him and in the darkness, it was impossible for Draco to see his face.
‘I had some help. But yes, it’s among my many talents.’ He said smugly. He flushed when Harry caught his hand as they accidently brushed against each other. It shouldn’t provoke that reaction, they’d been married for heaven’s sake, but Draco still got a small thrill when Harry did those things without even thinking about it. His mouth snapped shut as he looked at Draco with surprise.
She looked confused. “Who?” He pointed over his shoulder towards the tapestry.
Draco refused to acknowledge Teddy’s comment, his mind was already well and truly fucked, and he didn’t need anything else to think about. He figured he should probably eat too, so he followed Teddy into the kitchen and decided he’d actually make him breakfast instead of leaving him to the unhealthy cereal again.
‘I know it isn’t, but you don’t know how many sleepless nights I had thinking I might never get the chance to explain. They kept saying you’d be fine but until I saw you open your eyes. Christ, you don’t know what it’s like. It felt like I was watching the same thing happen all over again except this time it really was my fault.’
Malfoy leads him to the back of the house into a large living room. There’s probably a fancy name for it like a parlour, or a drawing room, or something, but Harry’s never got to grips with all of that. It’s a very fancy room with ornately gilded sofas, armchairs, and coffee table, and he’s sure the art on the walls is original. A pang of longing strikes him suddenly. Not for the Manor, but for the history, and the long line of ancestry Malfoy is surrounded by all day that Harry doesn’t and will never have. It must be nice to belong to something as established as that.
‘Hey, hey, breathe. You have to take it one step at a time.’ Draco huffed, but moved over so that Harry could sit next to him on the sofa. He pulled his blanket over Harry’s legs even though Harry was pretty much never cold. Harry gave him a gentle smile and he told himself to relax.
‘Strange feeling huh.’ His voice came out gravelly and Draco wondered how long he’d been stood there watching him.
He turned the shower on and glanced at himself in the mirror. He looked shocking – his skin was an odd shade of grey and there were deep bags under his eyes. He clutched the sink as his head span. He shouldn’t have jumped out of bed so quickly. The spell passed, and he straightened back up and stepped into the shower. As the hot water pummelled at his back, he contemplated how they were going to do this. They never did discuss it after they’d put up the Christmas tree. Not that Draco had been complaining…
It was all going smoothly until Luna pulled out her wand from some hidden pocket in her kaftan. The fox had patiently been listening to everything she said but as soon as he saw her wand, he scrabbled away from her, running out of room on the table's padding and slipping on the metal surface beneath.
“Draco could help you look for it though, couldn’t you?” Pansy interjected lightly. She seemed far too bright and interested for someone who detested anything remotely close to hard work or magical theory. He wondered what it was the two of them found to talk about.
‘I’d like to give you some homework for this week. I’d like you to go away and think about your childhood and see if you can make any connections between what happened back then and what is happening now. I’d also like you to sit down with Harry and tell him just one thing that you’ve never told him before. Can you do that?’ Draco could, but he didn’t want to.
He laughed.
Interlude over, the Hit Wizards seemed to spring back into action, pulling Draco out of his seat with large, meaty hands. The one who looked like a cheap version of Vince broke the news.
The man laughed again. He was tall and broad; the parts of his face not covered by a thick grey beard were heavily scarred. He might have been menacing to anyone who wasn’t Draco, but he had been used to the Death Eaters loitering outside his bedroom door ‘keeping watch’, so very little phased him anymore.
When they parted, he realised that it was the first time she’s initiated a kiss. It felt like some kind of revelation.
“Please don’t do that. Don’t hide it from me.” He looks into Malfoy’s eyes properly for the first time. It’s possibly the closest he has ever been to Malfoy’s face before, and he can see that the glimmering grey of his irises are lined with a darker graphite ring. There’s even a small smattering of freckles across his nose that Harry is convinced he must have been hiding at school because he absolutely would have noticed that.
Kate x
fine in that moment.
‘I’ll grandad you in a minute you shit. Since when do you speak French?’
‘Don’t panic, this isn’t what you think.’ He passed Draco the box which he opened with trembling fingers. Inside was silver ring with an engraving on it. He looked incredulously between Harry and the jewellery. ‘I’m not asking you to remarry me if that’s what you’re thinking. I just thought- well, it’s been a horrible year and all, but it brought us back together and I want you to know how much it means to me that you’re still here. I know it’s only been a couple of months, but I never stopped loving you and well, I wanted to give you something to say I’m glad we’re starting anew. Maybe this time will be even better than the last…’ Draco was blown away. A single tear fell from his face but once it dropped it was like a waterfall. Twice in one day too – honestly, becoming a Potter was a nightmare. What happened to his cold Malfoy façade?
‘Thank you,’ he said quietly, running his thumb across the spot where the cut had been. It wasn’t a big deal, it was just a scratch really, but it mattered. It mattered that Harry was there to do it for him, it mattered that Harry noticed. Draco couldn’t say why it affected him as much as it did.
As soon as he was back at his flat he took of his expensive robes and changed into the joggers Harry had bought him. It always made him laugh at how much he had protested when Harry had bought him them. He was sure he’d called them an insult to fashion and the trousers of peasants. Oh, to look at him now.
“It’ll all get cleared up in the end, don’t worry.” He tried to placate her, but her face was ashen. It only made her vibrant lipstick stark against her rapidly greying pallor.
Like the way Draco’s eyes subtly changed colour when he was happy or sad or angry. How he feigned cold aloofness while helping the first years with their Charms homework at the Slytherin table over breakfast. The way he always noticed when Draco entered a room or left it.
since he last saw Malfoy and he fully expects to be turfed out once Malfoy realises exactly who is at the door.
They made it a couple of blocks away, a distance they’d pre-agreed would be far enough for them to apparate back into Harry’s office without being too conspicuous. Harry offered Draco his arm, and apparated them both directly into his office, seeing as the wards only allowed for Harry to apparate in and out.
When his sobbing turned to sniffles, something in the back of his mind clicked into place.
“Potter, wait. That’s not what I meant.”
“Potter, please. Will it- will it make him happy?” Harry turned and saw the earnest look on her face. Recently he’d begun to realise the pattern in Malfoy’s behaviour. When they were kids, Malfoy had been snotty and snarky to impress, because being quick and intelligent made her stand out. Now that they were older, it seemed to Harry that this had become a defence – that when she didn’t trust her own opinion, or didn’t feel valued, she could fall back on that shell of meanness and quick wit. It didn’t excuse it, but Harry understood it. And he was determined to put a stop to it.
‘Do you think Teddy has really taken it all that well? Or should we expect the fall out later?’ Harry asked him.
He didn’t remember where the song came from, only that his mother used to sing it to him in that delicate lilting voice she had.
When they arrived, Draco could not believe his eyes.
“Draco, no. This has to stop. Don’t you think you’ve had enough hummus for now? You’ll make yourself sick of it and then you’ll never get to enjoy it again.” He was looking at Draco helplessly now. It wasn’t the end of the world that Draco had developed a love of hummus, but Harry would quite like to be able to kiss him again without tasting garlic.
‘Oh!’ Draco forced a hideously cold laugh. ‘Is that what you did? And I suppose all those criminals you put behind bars were just
With an absent wave of his hand, Harry righted the scattered bottles and fixed Hermione’s foundation, although it was unlikely she’d be back to claim it anytime soon. Then he turned his attention to the fox.
The cold was making Harry’s face hurt and he had started shivering, but he didn’t even think to cast a warming charm because he was so distracted by what he saw. There was a pale, yellow glow coming from the weather jar that brightened her face and made her long, silvery curls shine. Every now and again she closed her eyes as she sang, as if she was really
Granger rushed past him and went directly to the bookcases which lined the wall. In another time Draco would have blown his lid at her presumptuousness, but she meant well so he let it slide.
‘How do we fix it?’ He smiled and shook his head, finally moving away from the window and walking over to where Teddy was sitting. He knelt in front of him.
Except Ponytail didn’t take him back to his cell. Instead, he led him back through the corridors that all look the same, back into a part of the Ministry with charmed windows. Draco tried asking what was happening, unwilling to believe that he might actually be allowed to go home, but he got no answers. He wasn’t cuffed again, but nor was he greeted with smiles or apologies when he was taken to a large desk similar to the one he had seen when he arrived.
He kept touching his arm. Sometimes he didn’t even realise he was doing it. He was sure that he was probably ruining their little catch up, but he didn’t know what he could do about it. What was the alternative? Smith had mentioned his memory, maybe finding what was missing would also release the block on his magic. But how on earth would he be able to know what he’d forgotten? That was the whole point.
‘He’s been up since five,’ the matron, Susan, said quietly from behind him. Draco nodded conspiratorially.
Lyra couldn’t see Draco. She either saw herself or she was disillusioned so as not to see anything at all. Afterall, she had only gestured vaguely when he had mentioned it before. And didn’t the tapestry add the names magically after a new baby had arrived, not before? His head hurt with all the possibilities. Almost unconsciously, he inched closer to the wall until the tips of his fingers could brush Draco’s face if he stood at arm’s length. Magic prickled his skin like weak electric shocks.
‘Potter.’ He said shakily, nodding briefly but not looking anywhere near his eyes. He couldn’t.
He tried valiantly not to wallow in his failure, but as the chill of the dark room sunk into his skin while he waited for the heat of the fire to permeate, he wasn’t able to hold back the tears collecting in his eyes.
went unsaid.
“Then Draco will get himself out and the two of you will find a way to come back for me later.” Granger reached across the table and laid a hand over Pansy’s. It was testament to how difficult this was that Pansy didn’t move a muscle, but Granger didn’t take her hand back. The tension in the room could have been cut with a severing spell.
‘Woah Draco! You can’t possibly think that-’
He was half way to Hermione’s office when he was suddenly reminded of the fact that she’d been in the process of moving the last time he’d been here, and he’d completely forgotten. He got a few strange looks as he abruptly turned tails and went in the other direction. It was more nerve wracking to have to go to the Minister’s offices to see Hermione, but then the Minister had always been kind to him.
“Oh honey, you know I love how bookish you are. I just can’t keep up with you.” Harry starts rubbing at Draco’s shoulders. He’s been at this for hours and it’s a welcome relief for his aching back. Draco had thought about Harry’s ability to read quite a lot. He’s noticed how hard he has to concentrate on making sure he reads the next line instead of skipping a couple, he’s also noticed that sometimes he gets stuck on a word even though Draco knows Harry knows that word.
‘Never show up at my home without my permission again.’ Draco’s tone was firm, but Harry grinned anyway.
‘No. You don’t understand. I just need to do this, ok? The same way I needed France.’ Maybe that had been the wrong thing to say. Harry put the paperwork down and turned to face him. He even took his hands in his and for a moment Draco was scared he was going to find out something terrible.
He watched through the glass as Harry adjusted Teddy’s grip on the broom. He had always loved watching them interact with each other, so much so that he often forgot that Teddy wasn’t biologically theirs. Not that it made any difference as far as Draco was concerned. He watched as they kicked off the ground and flew out across the neighbouring fields until they were out of sight.
“Harry! And…Lyra? This is a surprise. Come in.” Sirius looked worried as he ushered them down the hallway of Grimmauld Place. The two of them were walking very close together and Harry couldn’t quite tell if it was purposeful until he felt her grip his little finger. Why only his little finger, he wasn’t sure, but he didn’t question it.
It was strange not seeing Granger go. She would have to go beyond the property boundary to apparate to the employee entrance of the Ministry since they didn’t want to be traced directly to the Manor. Years ago, the unplottable nature of the Manor would have negated this, but since the floo was now regulated under his house arrest restrictions, they were having to make do. Pansy went with Granger, but Draco stayed behind.
‘It might’ve made a difference though. If there’s something you want to say to me, you should just say it. I don’t appreciate you using Teddy as a bargaining tool.’ It sounded meaner than Draco really meant it to, but it was true. Related by blood or not, Teddy was their son and he deserved better than to be a pawn in their pathetic attempt at civility.
‘Out. To a club. You need it.’ Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry didn’t really know what to say. All he could see was a war waging behind Malfoy’s eyes. It made him think about a time when Malfoy hadn’t faced some kind of conflict and found he didn’t know of one. “I hope you find some peace.” He chose to say in the end.
“Mysteries is one floor down from the Atrium and one floor up from the courtrooms,” she said as if nothing happened. “It’ll be better if we take the stairs. There’ll be fewer people around to take notice.” He nodded, not lifting his eyes from the keys even though he had ceased playing.
‘Experiemental procedure? What did you do to me? Do people not normally recover from that kind of thing?’
He would then meet her, and she would take him to the DoM where they would try to turn him into an anchor for Potter on the other side of the Veil. An anchor which, if everything went to plan, would give Potter a way to come back out of the Veil and home to them.
‘I’m here to help you Draco.’ His mind healer was a child, quite literally. Draco wasn’t sure if he could tie his own shoelaces yet. Draco glanced at the name plaque on the desk,
‘Anyway, it turns out the clinic were being paid vast sums to give certain clients the pills but weren’t in on the ring.’ Harry explained.
“Enjoy your stay, prisoner.” The face withdrew into the shadows.
Draco couldn’t help but add, ‘and I felt terrible that I missed you go back to school.’
‘Ted? What’s wrong?’
It’s very wrong of Harry to smile given the circumstances, but he does enjoy seeing Malfoy in his element again. He imagines that if Malfoy had been a muggle, he’d have made a perfect university professor. Oxbridge educated of course – a Malfoy wouldn’t stand for less.
Most of what they found were revisions of pureblood rituals and traditions. Half of them made no sense at all and the ones that did were so old and barbaric that even Draco couldn’t face reading them. One of the more grotesque ones suggested that if a pureblood patriarch died without leaving an heir, his genitals should be dipped in a preservation potion and used posthumously.
‘Teddy, listen to me. He’s wrong. He doesn’t know anything about this family and even if he did, what he thinks doesn’t matter. You don’t let any stupid bully hurt you, it’s not worth it. Do you understand me?’ Teddy looked at him blankly.
‘May I please use your bathroom before I go?’ Draco thought if she was any sweeter, he might get a cavity.
‘Absolutely. Please do let me know as soon as possible. I’m sure for now you have much to do. I hope to see you soon Mr Malfoy.’ Kingsley stood and shook Draco’s hand.
‘Everything alright?’ Draco asked him as he settled at his side. Teddy nodded.
Maybe once in a while it was ok to let people love him.
‘I know everything,’ he teased. Her shoulders shook a little as she huffed a small laugh.
‘Be careful, love.’ Harry warned him. ‘I won’t be far. Just remember if she kicks off you can’t fix it.’ Draco nodded but, in all honesty, he didn’t expect she would. He knew how it felt to think people who were supposed to love you didn’t care anymore. She would calm down eventually. He waited until the corridor had been quiet a few minutes and then he tapped on her door gently.
Of course, it was Oliver Wood.
“I suppose it was a long shot.” She shouted right in his ear as the room rumbled around them. If it were to collapse, they would never make it out in time. He couldn’t find it in him to respond, he could only cling to her and wait for the shaking to stop.
‘Are you quite alright dear?’ She asked him worriedly, fixing him with a look scarily like the one his mother used to give him except without the ferocity.
The next time Draco woke up, he felt surprisingly good, all things considered. His throat was less dry for a start, and when he opened his eyes, he didn’t feel like he was emerging from water – also a good sign.
‘I’m fine Hermione. Go back and spend time with the kids.’ Since Hermione became head of the DMLE, her time with her children had been suffering. She gave him a smile loaded with sympathy and pity. It made his stomach churn.
Her house, apparently.
‘Harry talks shit. Since when were we ever friends? I told him the truth about what happened to our marriage and yes, I should have told him long before now, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to start playing happy families. Did he tell you about how he lied to me? How he stole from my flat and accused me of being an addict? How he threatened my relationship with Teddy to try and force a confession out of me? He went full Head Auror on my ass Hermione and that’s not ok. I’m not saying I didn’t deserve it, because I absolutely did, but he’s deluded if he thinks it changes anything at all.’
‘I need to get a team of aurors on surveillance at the clinic. Kingsley reduced the urgency levels on the case when he realised that there weren’t going to be any more victims soon. Whatever it is, we think it didn’t have the desired effect and they gave up for a while to change the formula. I don’t have clearance to go straight in there and we can’t afford to spook whoever’s involved until we have enough evidence to bring them in. Do you think it’s a potion or some sort of pill?’
‘Oh. Really? I was never all that religious. My aunt and uncle went to church at Christmas but that was about it.’ Draco shook his head.
Bracing himself to see one of dozens of horrible memories from his past, Draco was not prepared for the flash of red hair, a blast of brilliant green light, and the distinct voice of a woman shouting, “HARRY!”
‘What.’ He said breathlessly, but Draco couldn’t answer him. He was already desperately trying to get air into his lungs, but he couldn’t remember what to do. He gaped at Harry who was looking at him worriedly. ‘Draco? What’s going on?’ Draco scrabbled for the vial on the counter although it was probably useless by now. His lungs were screaming for air, but he couldn’t make them work. What was breathing again? Panic was clawing at the inside of his empty chest like a white-hot poker.
‘Will you tell me? When things have settled down?’ He looked at Draco so earnestly that he briefly wondered how he had ever had the strength to leave him, even if he didn’t regret it.
‘I didn’t…it’s not- it’s not like that. I just grew up without many people around in a pretty big house and sometimes- sometimes I can’t think straight. I get confused and irritable and I need a new scene and some quiet.’ Harry looked at him sceptically.
“It’s not impossible to find one here, but you’re more likely to see one in North America. He’s a snow glow fox. They’re born white and when they grow, they develop sandy brown or grey legs and tails depending on their breeding. They’re my most favouritest foxes. Especially the ones as handsome as you!” The fox preened at her praise; his ears flattened against his head so she could stroke him gently. Harry was almost jealous.
He realised he’d been rocking himself back and forth like a nutter as he’d disappeared inside his own mind.
‘Yeah, everything’s fine. Hermione was just helping me with a little project.’ Ron nodded.
He was just finishing is second cup of tea with his aunt, who was telling him a lot about the various plants she was learning to grow in the garden, when Harry arrived. Draco was actually disappointed as Andromeda had grown up in the Black family and had some very interesting knowledge on some of the rare plants that were no longer available in England.
‘Spungen!’ Spungen appeared a couple of minutes later.
“What if
Teddy came out of his room in just enough time for a high-five goodbye, he’s still too cool for hugs, and Draco showed Hermione out through the front door since he didn’t have the magical ability to lift the wards Harry had set. Not that he would ever admit that in a million years.
I'm so sorry this update took so long. I have been busy, but this chapter has also been the hardest I've written for this fic so far. It didn't turn out the way I wanted, even after a hundred edits, but I hope it will do. Feelings are not my forte...
“I think we have a visitor.”
‘Yeah…it was great…have you seen your dad?’ He heaved out eventually.
He waited for another ten minutes before Harry returned and then insisted they travel by floo - he was too tired and confused for apparition. He’d missed sleep because of his nightmare, and he was more than a little shocked at his outburst. Did he really think they could handle adoption? That was more than a big step for a fragile relationship. But then, was their relationship fragile? Or was he making it fragile by shutting himself off? He wished he could figure out even one of those answers.
He made it upstairs fairly easily but when he set Teddy down on his bed, the young boy stirred just enough to be aware of what was happening.
Harry looked like he was about to start crying and Draco would never admit it, but he wasn’t far behind him. Draco began to feel a familiar twist of guilt in the pit of his stomach when he realised that if he did indeed to go France, he’d only be proving to Teddy that his fears were well founded.
‘Of course I will.’ He promised, and he meant it. Harry smiled the kind of smile that brought the faint creases around his eyes out. They really were faint, he wasn’t even thirty yet, but they were little reminders of the life they’d lived so far.
It was wrong of him to have said nothing about Potter’s disappearance. He could see now, having worked for so long with Granger, that Potter left this kind of imprint on everyone he met. In the beginning it had been easy for Draco to tell himself that he was allowing Potter to chase the life he really wanted over the one he had, but that wasn’t true. What Draco was really doing was protecting himself from a life where he didn’t have to see Potter’s face and wonder how things might have been. From a life where the whole world had a small piece of Potter except him.
It was unfair, and it was selfish, and Draco would be back to his familiar self-loathing when it was done, but when Harry reached out and pulled Draco into him, he let him hold him because if Draco was honest, he was tired of this. He was tired of the lies and the games and the misunderstandings and he really missed his husband. Eventually, Draco fell into an uneasy sleep in Harry’s arms for the first time in three years. Neither of them made it into work that day, and somehow, none of their friends were surprised.
‘Sweetie,’ he started carefully, ‘I know we're friends and I care about you very much, but you can’t always shout for me when you’re upset. You have to trust Matron, ok?’ He had already started planning in his mind how he could slowly withdraw from the children and force them to establish a better relationship with the staff.
‘Little Ella has asked for you every single day.’ Draco’s heart swelled. Ella had been the very first resident in the orphanage, Harry had told him. He’d met the little girl the first time Harry had brought him here and they’d built a strong connection. She was a little ray of sunshine and it made it much easier for Draco to deal with missing Teddy when she was around. Not that anyone could ever compare to his little wolf of course.
“I have nothing to say.”
‘Yeah you should.’
‘Ok…’
‘We’d better get a move on. We’re due at The Burrow in forty-five minutes.’ Harry snorted from beside him.
‘Master is the last heir of the Malfoy family and the Noble House of Black, but he does not bear either name. Spungen was woken from his sleep upon Master’s arrival.’ Spungen declared. House elf magic was always tied to the magic of the family they served, it was one of the ways the family trees updated with every descendent.
“Harry, I wanted to kiss you. I want to kiss you.” She paused and his heart sank in his chest as he anticipated a ‘but’. “I also want to know what is going through your head right now. You’re not telling me anything. Why are you asking me about this person called Draco? Is it something to do with whatever’s making you like this?” He felt a flush of embarrassment rise up his neck and burn onto his cheeks. It sounded so sincere, nothing like her usual aloofness.
‘Mummy,’ his odd voice cracked, and he wanted nothing more than to cry in her arms like he had when he was a little boy. He couldn’t cry now though, he didn’t know how to.
‘Draco! You finally made it in! How lovely to see you!’ She pulled him into the office sharply by his elbow and shut the door behind him. ‘What are you doing here? You can’t have been out of hospital for long…’ She straightened out her deep purple robes and pressed her hands to her cheeks. If Draco didn’t know any better, he’d half suspect there’d been some inappropriate activities going on before his arrival. That brought images of the Weasel he never wanted to see to the front of his mind and he quickly changed tack.
‘Why does something have to be up with me?’ He mumbled against Harry’s skin. He tried not to laugh as goosebumps erupted across his chest.
He turned to Pansy to wait for her judgement. She stood gawping in front of him. “Well…” She paused as if she couldn’t find the right words. “No one’s going to suspect it’s you anyway.” With Pansy being no real help, he strode over to the nearest mirror and got a shock.
“I’m not playing at anything,” he mumbled, trying to walk up the stairs on his own. The buzzing had eased since they’d come downstairs, but being close to her made the feeling worse, like his head was being held underwater and he couldn’t come up for air. Perhaps this was all just a dream and Dudley had been holding his head in the toilet the whole time. He could hear Lyra clattering up the stairs behind him.
He poured everything into the day’s entry. So much so that his hand quickly cramped with the ferocity with which he was writing.
Why was there so much bloody folding?
“Will you please just listen to me?”
“It worked!” Lyra shouted in his face as soon as he opened the door. He didn’t even think to ask her what she was talking about because as soon as he made eye contact it was like all the breath had been sucked from his body. He stood there with the door open, even though it was clearly raining outside, and Lyra was dripping all over the hallway.
me to take care of him if anything happened. Tonks never even fucking met you.’ Harry spat. Draco was incensed.
‘I know. I’m sorry.’ And there is was. The first apology since the divorce. Draco didn’t know if it was an apology for the invite, or if Harry meant more, but somehow it felt like something had shifted yet again. Draco stood very still as Harry stepped towards him. He fought the instinct to step backwards, instead standing his ground.
There were clothes already laid out for him which was unusual since the elves knew he preferred to dress himself. There was a tweed blazer with leather patches over the elbows, threadbare corduroy trousers in an odd shade of tan, and brown leather loafers scuffed down the sides. It was about as opposite from Draco’s tastes as could be, but this would make sense if he was to be looking like a muggle.
“You don’t know everything about me,” he shrugs nonchalantly, although his insides feel like runny honey the way Harry is looking at him with such admiration.
‘You still knew what I was laughing for. I count that as an admission of guilt.’ Draco’s stomach flipped as Harry pressed him into his side. Harry was warm and familiar and smelled like home and Draco wanted to bury himself in the feeling. Except it was tarnished with the knowledge – or lack therefore – of what was going on between Harry and Wood. Near death experiences or not, Draco wouldn’t play second fiddle to anyone.
There was no way to tell how long Draco had been in Azkaban. In the early days he had tried to count the cycle of the moon by scratching tallies on the wall, but the beginnings of a cold he’d had when he’d entered the prison had raged into a fever so high he’d become delirious, and he’d lost count.
‘Basically, yeah.’ Harry nodded. ‘I found the pills in your apartment when I found you. I think they were trying to frame you.’ Draco opened his mouth to apologise, for not sending those pills off as soon as he found them, but Harry cut him off.
Draco was never letting Pansy talk him into anything ever again. The minute he apparated them to the doorstep of his former home, he felt his world tilt on its axis. He lifted a hand to knock on the door and froze, it felt totally wrong to be knocking on his own front door. In the end, he hesitated so long Pansy knocked for him. Luckily for Draco, it was Luna who answered the door. Draco wondered whether that was a strategic move by Potter but then the thought Potter probably wasn’t quite that switched on.
His eyelids felt like sandpaper and his head pounded when he woke at seven thirty. It had been a stupid idea to run out into the storm like that right, but he had no way of knowing when the next storm would be. A wave of frustration came over him when he remembered he had probably given himself a fever for nothing. Had he said the incantation wrong? Had he mis-brewed the potion? Had he missed a step altogether?
‘Happy Birthday, Harry.’ Draco whispered, his throat squeezing painfully. He strode off as confidently as he could and made a beeline for Hermione, who was standing talking to Neville right at the far end of the garden.
‘I know,’ he said quietly. Thankfully at that moment Teddy’s attention was diverted by the reindeer shaped baubles and darted off. Draco nodded and smiled as Teddy showed him row after row of unique ornaments from glass snowflakes to perspex spheres you could insert your own photo into to hang on the tree. He wasn’t really paying as much attention as he should be though as he continued to think about Harry’s Christmas present. He was seriously running out of time. His gaze wandered away from Teddy and he saw a couple picking out a nativity set. He was nearly blinded when the woman’s ring caught the light and flashed in his eye as she turned to show her partner whatever it was that had caught her eye. He remembered the first time he and Harry had bought their own Christmas decorations – it was novel for Draco since his own family had never celebrated Christmas – besides at Hogwarts.
“I’m not sure that’s wise,” Remus interjected, “we don’t know where that animal came from. It could be a shapeshifter for all we know. It might lead us into danger.”
It wouldn’t matter if Draco was robbed at gunpoint or his flat burned down, nothing in the world would make him part with his wedding ring. It didn’t matter that the relationship it symbolised was nothing anymore, this simple band was a reminder that he’d even had Harry at all and he wouldn’t part with it for the world.
He went up into the loft and searched around for a familiar looking red box which housed all of their Christmas decorations. He was surprised to find it in a far corner, covered in a thick layer of dust. It was odd, because every year Draco cast protective spells over it whenever the decorations had been taken down again to make sure it didn’t get damaged by dust mites and the like. He’d always studiously avoided the house around Christmas time following the divorce, not wanting to be reminded of the festive cheer he wouldn’t be part of.
‘That’s horrible! I didn’t know I was giving him my magic! I mean, not that it would’ve changed anything if I had, but…it feels a bit like stealing when you don’t know it’s happening. Did you know?’
Draco supposed this might be quite good timing for him. He could leave his current employment, take on the Ministry contract, and he’d be free to leave for France at the end. Maybe it was a sign he was doing the right thing.
. He couldn’t leave without him. Not after everything.
‘Good morning, Draco! It’s lovely to see you again!’ Helen greeted him with a warm smile. It had taken him longer than he’d care to admit to stop calling her Leggy-Blonde, but he’d gotten to know her a little since he’d returned from France and she was a lovely woman. He was less than impressed when Harry had said she was going to run the place, but who was he to keep a woman of her level of accomplishment away from needy children?
They opened presents from Ron and Hermione – i.e. Hermione, who got Teddy a book on Herbology. They were going to see them at Christmas lunch of course, but Hermione had the foresight to know that if they all exchanged presents at The Burrow, they’d probably drown in gift wrap. When they were done, Draco glanced at his watch.
“Divert attention? How exactly could that be seen as diverting anything? Everyone knows Potter and I hate each other, why on earth would I go out of my way to see him for the first time in
‘Yes, he did. I think you should go. I have some time off from work so if you want to I’ll stay, and we can go together. Luna will be there too, and Granger. You won’t be alone.’
He decided he’d make the trip over, without the letting agent, so he could see the place more objectively, imagine what it might be like to approach as a customer rather than an owner. He didn’t make it far however, since the heavens opened and forced Draco back inside. He could do that another day he supposed – it wasn’t worth wading through such heavy rain. Instead, he spent most of the day tuck up under a blanket with a book he’d bought at said bookshop. He knew he would have to go out to the chateau later, so he figured he may as well let this trip slide in the hopes the rain would clear later.
‘Me? Never.’ He smiled and lent up to kiss him. Draco hated morning kisses, as a rule. He refused to kiss Harry before they’d brush their teeth, it was just good etiquette. He couldn’t help it today. They pulled away and that would usually be Draco’s cue to get up and get dressed. He was never the type to hang around in bed when he could be doing something else. He also took great pleasure watching Harry squirm as he dressed in front of him. The thrill of making Harry blush had never worn off.
‘Well, you are basically a philistine after all.’ He blew flour in Harry’s face to annoy him, but he missed, and it all went in his hair. He started giggling like a child until he breathed in some of it and started hacking up a lung.
‘My problems with my magic are my fault, not yours.’
‘Oui, je suis un descendant. Mais s'il vous plait, vous pouvez m'appeler Gabriel.’ He smiled kindly. Harry gave Draco a nudge and he was confused for just a moment.
‘Never mind. Let’s head home.’ He probably shouldn’t have been flooing backwards and forwards but really what choice did he have when Harry had basically abandoned him. Ok, maybe that was a bit strong but still. Had he actually thought about the implications of him shooting off like that?
“Well, then. You’re lucky you have me, aren’t you?” Harry doesn’t need to be able to see Malfoy to picture the broad smirk on his face.
‘What have you been doing then?’ He asked between mouthfuls. The pair exchanged a look which he knew meant they were doing something he wouldn’t approve of.
‘Thank you very much Miss Daphne, I love it!’ Ella said politely when they were almost ready to leave. Draco helped her back into the coat he hadn’t noticed her taking off.
After a few minutes there was a scraping of furniture and a click of a lock. He wanted to push the door open and swoop right in, but he knew he had to let her come to him. He waited patiently as the shuffling inside stopped and the door creaked open slowly, revealing a little girl with swollen, red eyes and tangled hair. He was so shocked his heart nearly skipped a beat.
‘I’m never going to abandon you, Draco. I love you.’ Draco nodded around the lump in his throat. Swallowing it down, he opened his mouth to tell him how much he knew that now.
“I want-” Harry couldn’t bear not to touch Draco. He looked anything but that confident figure leaning against the wall of the Transfiguration corridor. He seemed scared. Before he could stop it, Harry was reaching out and brushing his thumb gently over Draco’s lower lip.
“Where I can post pictures of my books?”
‘I don’t know. I can just…feel it.’ When his eyes met Harry’s, they were greener than he’d ever seen them. They were soft with worry, but there was a depth in them that told of the thoughts whirring in his mind.
“Yeah it is.” Harry said so quietly Ron probably didn’t even hear. He offered to get the next round in, even though it wasn’t his turn, since it would give him five minutes to collect himself. Ron barely even responded, just waved his hand vaguely as if it wasn’t even a question.
‘Keep it simple. Something that’s second nature. Don’t draw too much power. Even if it is back, you haven’t used it in a long time, and it might be unpredictable.’ Harry was always so cool in a crisis. Draco envied him that.
Harry’s hair was a knotted mess all over the pillow and Draco desperately wanted to run his fingers through it once more. He daren’t though, since he knew how much of a light sleeper Harry was. Harry was pouting in his sleep and his eyelashes were fluttering as he dreamed and if Draco wasn’t absolutely terrified of his current situation, he’d think it was the most adorable sight in the world.
Their faces were centimetres apart. Even through the cold and dampness of their clothes Harry could feel Draco’s body heat. He could also feel his cheeks heating up under Draco’s gaze and their compromising position. To make matters immeasurably worse, Draco didn’t particularly like the way his wet clothes were clinging to him, so he kept wriggling his bum.
‘I told him not to contact you.’ She said, a little abruptly, but answering his next question nonetheless. ‘I thought you needed the space.’
‘Love you too,’ he mumbled before falling asleep a second time that day.
‘Sorry Spungen. It’s a muggle device. I’m sure Harry didn’t mean for it to make so much noise.’ Spungen’s face twisted in disgust at the word muggle, but Draco could forgive that for now considering he’d had little contact with the outside world while the chateau had been abandoned. Attitudes had changed quickly after all.
‘It’s not because of you, if that’s what you think. It’s just because I feel like I can breathe here. This place is my own.’ Harry placed a hand over Draco’s on his face and gave him a sad smile.
how much
He stormed out of the kitchen in a rage and almost completely missed Teddy standing just outside the door, his Lego scattered in pieces on the floor in front of him.
‘My mother was a Black you imbecile. I’m French on my father’s side.’
‘How so…?’
The movement of his arm alerted Aspen to the sugar snaps in his jacket. Much to Harry’s relief, he busied himself trying to get at them for the rest of their relatively short walk. It was a very mild day for October, but he still would have been freezing cold in his denim jacket if it hadn’t been for Aspen’s fur keeping him warm. For the first time it occurred to Harry that foxes were often bred for their fur, and Aspen could have been one of those foxes. The thought made him shiver, independently of the chill, and he felt guity for enjoying the warmth of the small body held against his own. The world could be a cruel place.
He couldn’t help the feeling of terror that crawled up his spine. There was no one to help him this time. No father, no mother, not even Severus. Ultimately it gave him two choices. He could refuse to help Granger and let the court of public opinion swell to the point that the still-corrupt Ministry arrested him anyway, or, he could go with her, try to fix the problem he helped cause, get caught, and be arrested anyway.
The aspen trees were a long way from the Manor itself but having spent so long beneath them that is where he wanted to be when it finally happened. Covering himself in the best weatherproofing charms he could do with his wand dampened, he ran out into the pouring rain. The cold water pelted at his thin nightwear and although the fat droplets hurt as they made contact with his delicate skin, he was otherwise impervious.
‘Shut up.’ They got on with decorating the tree. At one point, Harry pulled Draco into quite a competent waltz when a slow song came on. He stepped back and watched as Harry charmed twinkling lights onto the tree. It was the only magic allowed near the tree and was only allowed because one year they had cat-sat Crookshanks who had spent the whole Christmas period attacking the wires on the electric lights.
By the time they’d folded the pastry six times, Draco was surprisingly tired. Thankfully the pastry needed time to chill before they could do anything with it. For once Draco’s chilled fingers were actually useful. Handling the pastry too much made it too warm which was a greater problem for Harry than Draco.
He almost laughed when he remembered being too embarrassed to ask his mother what a huckleberry friend was, too proud to admit to not know everything, even as a child. The faint amusement died before it could even reach his face as the freezing temperature dropped further; the dementors were making their rounds again.
‘It’s perfect!’ Harry sniggered from behind him as he checked his appearance in the mirror. Draco was wearing a pair of his least-fancy dress trousers so as not to destroy expensive garments but still look presentable.
There was no one around, not even any dementors, so he didn’t care that he crawled over the ground on his hands and knees to retrieve it. Reaching out with shaking fingers, he noticed he was wearing the same faded grey and white striped clothing his father had worn when he was here and the idea of someone changing him while he was unconscious made him shudder. Draco almost scoffed until it hit him how bad it was that nearly a year after the war none of this had changed. If Potter had been here, things would have been different.
Hermione tucked a thick curl behind her ear as she thought about what Draco was saying. She looked particularly well today, purple robes really suited her complexion. Draco would know, he spent hours as a child listening to his mother tell him all about how different cuts and colours suited people in different ways.
She was telling him all about the gossip she’d heard at tea with the Greengrass’ and as usual, he found himself rolling his eyes at most things. Honestly, how could people so blindly believe everything they hear? He knew for a fact Theodore Nott hadn’t run of with Tracey Davis because Draco knew full well Tracey was gay and had a huge crush on Astoria Greengrass. Not that Astoria returned her affections. He wasn’t about to start telling his mother that however, so he kept his mouth shut and nodded where applicable.
‘Why is he mean?’ She stopped her foot angrily and he was glad he was yet to witness her throw a tantrum.
‘Are these memories?’ His head with tilted to one side in confusion and Draco thought it was adorable. He nodded shyly as Harry picked one of the phials out of the box and noticed the label.
A rosy glow came to the surface of her skin, not like the brick-red that tinged Ron’s ears whenever he was embarrassed. She seemed unable to respond but he didn’t mind that. Seeing the small smile on Malfoy’s face, watching that glow brighten her pale skin as she flushed elegantly, right before the gust of confidence blew away again, was enough to make him want to say it again and again and again.
A startled movement next to his bed drew his attention to the rest of the room. Regulus’ room was the kind of tidy only accomplished in a room that was no longer lived in. Books were aligned perfectly on the shelf opposite him. All the drawers were properly closed and there wasn’t a single thing out of place on the dusty surfaces or scattered on the floor except for a thick hardback book which was faced downwards on the bare floorboards. It seemed Lyra had stayed with him after he was moved; she was sitting in an armchair positioned next to his bed, her eyes wide with fear, until she realised it had been Aspen making the racket. Her shoulders slumped and she reached down to pick up the book she must have dropped in her shock.
When he left Grimmauld later that evening, Aspen still asleep in his arms, he couldn’t help but feel disappointed. He knew in his bones there was something about this fox and for some reason no one else could see it. He was also, however, determined to do something nice for Sirius. Now that he thought about it, it wasn’t fair for him to rattle around in that old house on his own. There must be centuries of negative energy and dark magic bleeding through the walls. But what could he do?
” This was the final step towards becoming an animagus. He had come so close to finding his animal form and this was finally it.
‘When Harry?’ If he couldn’t be honest about this then it only went to show how much of it all had been a lie.
“We heard what happened and we wanted to know what we can do to help.”
‘No,’ Harry said quietly, his voice cracking slightly. ‘Just know that you scared the crap out of me and you’re not allowed to do that ever again. I already lost you once, I won’t lose you again.’ Draco could feel the hurt radiating off Harry in waves and his heart did an uncomfortable flip in his chest.
‘No, I’m not.’ Teddy sniffled. ‘I’m scared of…’ Harry caught Draco’s eye as they waited for Teddy to figure out what he wanted to say. Draco’s heart was racing. This was the longest he and Harry had been in the same room together since the divorce, and Draco didn’t know how to feel. ‘I’m scared of you not being here when I come back.’
“You see what I mean?” He asked them with a hint of desperation in his voice. The two exchange looks with each other that Harry couldn’t quite decipher.
‘I know you love me Ted. You don’t have to tell me. Actually, it’s my job to tell
‘Because she’d just received the planning permission for the refurb, which we could only get if we got approval for the whole project to go ahead. She was desperate to tell me the good news.’ Of course. Harry had answers for it all. Draco felt like a prized idiot for ever thinking Harry would date someone without telling Draco, or anyone else they knew for that matter.
‘That woman you told me about. The female you.’ Draco’s breath caught.
It was perplexing then that as he made his way to the back of the house, it was like walking into one of those cartoon rainclouds that followed one character, only in reverse. Not long after Luna had moved in, but long before Malfoy arrived, Luna had single-handedly constructed a large conservatory out the back of the house. It was attached to the plant-filled living room, although it was difficult to tell that considering the plants covered so much of the walls. Harry had never been in the conservatory, but he had noticed it had a long coffee table, some comfortable looking sofas, and what he thought looked like sewing equipment in one corner.
Draco sat by the window to drink his tea, and he watched the sunrise creep over the rooftops of Paris surburbs. He’d become a much earlier riser than he ever had been before, and he’d grown to appreciate the still freshness of the dawn. As he slowly drank his tea, he became vaguely aware of a shift in the magic around him. Confused, he drew his attention away from the pink-streaked sky and glanced around. The room was still, and in the weak rays of sunlight, he could see dusty particles floating as if carried by an invisible breeze. Nevertheless, something was wrong.
“It can wait a while,” Harry mused, letting his eyes close again. One day maybe he’d get to sleep a whole night with Draco pressed against his side like this. One day. Even though Harry enjoyed not feeling like he had to speak when he was around Draco, after a while he started to suspect something was off. Draco’s shoulders where still too tense, his breathing not quite even. A sliver of doubt crept into Harry’s mind. Was this not what Draco wanted?
But then Harry pressed the lightest of kisses to the base of Draco’s neck and he couldn’t fight it anymore. He melted into Harry’s embrace and felt the arms around him tighten in response. Honestly, Draco was worried that at this point Harry could tell him he’d been sleeping with Wood every other day for ten years and invite Draco to join them, and it still wouldn’t be enough for Draco to leave him. Maybe Draco was too clingy like that. Wait, no, he couldn’t be closed off and clingy at the same time…could he?
‘Draco. Please. Just stop apologising.’ Harry said tiredly.
He wasn’t allowed to brew anymore. Not because it required magic as such, at the end of the day it was still very much similar to muggle cooking. However, should anything go wrong, his inability to use magic would become as issue quite quickly. Whilst he would usually be far too stubborn to admit defeat, he could well imagine it wouldn’t bode well for his relationship with Harry if he endured yet another near-death experience.
‘You’d better get a move on then.’ Harry grinned, and all but dragged Draco up the stairs in his enthusiasm.
Luna brought them to a room that was somewhere between a sitting room and a vet’s examination room. It was a large space painted pale green with a metal table in the middle. There were yet more plants lined up along the wide windowsill to Harry’s left, and the walls were covered with anatomical drawings, potions recipes, and complex want movements. There was a saggy old sofa in one corner with one arm ripped to shreds, and a few cushions and dog beds stacked beside it.
‘I’m sorry? I’m afraid I don’t understand ba-” He breaks off as he follows Harry’s gaze towards his arms. It confuses Harry when he starts scrabbling to unfold the sleeves he’s just rolled to his elbows, until he realises that Malfoy thinks he’s staring at something else entirely. In seconds he has crossed the room and grabbed hold of Malfoy’s left forearm.
‘There’s nothing for it, Draco. It’s him who’s causing it. You won’t get better so long as he’s here.’ Draco was confused. As he looked around, he realised he wasn’t at the clinic at all, he was sitting in Harry’s study, across from the wall of photographs he always loved so much.
“It’s just something I need to figure out for myself,” he said desperately, searching her eyes for understanding. She nodded once but the step back she took from him told him more than enough.
“What are you doing here anyway?” She broke the awkward silence. “Luna isn’t here. She’s at school on Thursdays.” She hadn’t noticed that Harry hadn’t brought Aspen with him. Ron had finally stopped sloping off to wherever he was going all the and he agreed to let Harry have an afternoon not keeping an eye on Aspen. If this was what co-parenting would be like in the future, Harry would have to pass. Although, it had been Harry’s decision to keep Aspen, and he hadn’t exactly consulted Ron before making it, so he probably shouldn’t complain.
‘Edward, I think your father and Draco need to talk without us eavesdropping, don’t you?’ Andromeda led Teddy through to the kitchen.
“How did you- what are you-” He couldn’t string a full sentence together to save his life. She knelt in front of him and turned the cool cloth over and pressed it back to his forehead and he sighed involuntarily.
The only time he had ever felt even remotely close to Potter had been when he had been attacked by a dementor or when he was in-
‘I won’t harm him, per se. But I wonder what he’d say if he knew about us. I could tell him all about it. How you looked when you lay in my bed that night.’ He stumbled over to Harry and began whispering in his ear. ‘I remember all the sounds you made. Each moan, each hitch of breath. I’m sure he’d be so pleased to hear…’
‘Yes! I was just looking at it. Most of it doesn’t seem of any use.’ He told him. Harry’s frame deflated.
She looked up at him with those sparkling eyes he loved so much. “What do you want me to do?”
Draco paused with a forkful of egg half way to his mouth.
At the beginning of his second week on the case, he was preparing blood samples to analyse them for rare compounds when he got a surprise visit.
He supposed it was his own bloody fault for not allowing him to go with him.
His father had always preferred to have his study on the north side of the house because the Manor was south-facing, and it meant he could spend whole days there without the sun blinding him. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had been in this particular library. It had always been forbidden to him as a child, although it hardly mattered since the door was sealed with an old kind of magic that had been woven into the very building. It only recognised and gave admittance to the current Malfoy patriarch. No matter how gifted a wizard Draco had been as a child, which was actually a fair bit even though he had always been overshadowed, he would never have been able to get in.
‘Oh yes, little Ed is going to a school this year.’ Leggy-Blonde said from behind him. Ed? Who the fuck did she think she was? She doesn’t get to call Draco’s son fucking Ed.
good terms, and Ron and I spent that evening with him and other than being a bit quiet, he seemed fine. There are no new developments on his whereabouts, and no sightings of him since 17
“Well, that was then.” She sniffed, lifting her pointed nose in the air. It didn’t work on Harry anymore.
‘I miss h-him,’ he hiccupped. Draco’s heart broke for him.
Once they got clearance, Harry asked Draco to go with him to the clinic to scope the place out. They were both going to Polyjuice; Harry going undercover as a patient, while Draco went for ‘moral support’. Draco wasn’t convinced that it would work but Harry seemed completely confident. Draco had to remind himself that Harry had more than likely done this a hundred times before and Draco had been none the wiser. That wasn’t a pretty thought.
‘I was wrong. I was upset that he might be happier when I wasn’t there, and it made me angry. That was wrong of me, very wrong, and I’m sorry you had to watch.’ Teddy pursed his lips in thought, taking him time to mull over what Harry was saying.
‘It’s not the only one.’ He muttered under his breath and Draco nearly choked. Thankfully the pastry chef seemed to be turning a blind eye. Or deaf ear. Or both.
“Yes, I realise that but-”
“Hey…” he whispered into the darkness. Immediately the fox was quiet, regarding Harry carefully. It slowly crept back to the bed Harry had made as if it knew what Harry expected it to do.
The same thought had been ringing in his head for an hour now, stuck on a continuous loop. He didn’t know what to do with himself. He’d make tea, that’s what he’d do. Tea fixed everything. His hands shook as he filled the kettle, the cupboard door slammed against the one next to it because he opened it with too much force, the mug clattered when he almost dropped it instead of putting it down gently. All in all, it was the most disastrous cup of tea he’d ever made.
‘I did it to myself.’ His voice was quiet and wavering.
‘Am I?’ He wiped at his face and realised Teddy was right. He supposed he probably deserved a few happy tears for once.
‘After you came back.’ Draco’s heart sank to the floor. He didn’t know what he had expected. He’d been the one to bring it up. He could’ve ignored it, pretending he’d not seen anything, but he wouldn’t be made a fool of. He slipped the ring off his finger and closed the gap between them. He took Harry’s hand and dropped it into his open palm.
They ushered Teddy onto the train and Harry handed him Eltanin. Teddy seemed to have forgotten his worries already when he spotted another boy, clearly another first year, who also had an owl. Teddy went straight up to him and started asking him all about his owl and the other boy lit up with excitement. Draco smiled as he watched their exchange and the two boys scrambled into the nearest carriage together. Draco focused on Teddy and keeping his breathing even as he tried to keep his anxiety at bay.
‘Long enough.’
‘Ted?’ Harry mumbled from where his head was squished against the pillow, facing away from Draco.
‘Oh, it’s from Hermione. She told me to give you her love, but you may as well just read it yourself.’ He gave the letter to Harry and reached forward to take one of the wine glasses. Hm, Gamay, not one of his favourites. A little too fruity for his tastes. Still, it would do.
It felt like every fibre of his being had snapped all at once. He tumbled backwards down the steps and Potter’s wand skittered away from him. His vision blurred as he felt everything inside him breaking and fusing back together in the wrong order. It wasn’t until he looked down at his hands that were no longer hands that he realised what was happening. He was transforming.
‘Ok!’ Teddy bounded off towards Quality Quidditch Supplies, dragging Draco along behind him. This shop was less packed than the street when they stepped inside, setting off the bell above the door, many people couldn’t afford the luxury of a broomstick after the war. Draco supposed it was taking a while for business to pick up again.
He supposed all a long he’d known there had to be something. He could physically do magic after all. But where did it leave him? If he re-forged the bond with Harry, he’d be married to him but only because it would save his magic. It wasn’t as if he didn’t love him, of course he did, but they weren’t ready for that and they both knew it. Harry was too much of a blind Gryffindor to see it, but Draco could. He was cautious, he didn’t go into things without knowing what he was in for.
‘I nearly did. But no, I didn’t.’ He nodded and gingerly took a seat as close to the opposite edge of the sofa as he dared.
‘Fine implies it could be better. How is your husband?’ Draco’s insides froze.
“He’s so beautiful!” Luna exclaimed as the fox stood up and looked around. It seemed very curious and a little nervous, but it located Harry and cocked its head to one side as if waiting for something.
‘I’m not running away, Pans. I need space to get my head together and figure out what I’m going to do with the rest of my life. Maybe I don’t want to date anymore, maybe I don’t want a family. I don’t know any of that because I threw myself head first into a marriage which was doomed since before it even started.’ Even as he said it he was done explaining himself. It was his decision to make.
Harry looked over at Fred once more, looming in the dark, and added, “how’s business?”
‘Oh. I was really hoping you’d find something. We’re running out of avenues to explore.’
Harry only saw Ron first thing in the morning. He was noticeably absent in the evenings and never appeared during the weekend. It was strange that it never occurred to Harry to ask him what he was up to until after Ron had already left for work; doing a job Harry couldn’t remember and felt too embarrassed to ask. If it weren’t for Aspen keeping him very busy, Harry probably would have been suspicious.
‘Are you sure?’ Teddy nodded. Draco felt like a terrible parent, but he didn’t know what he could do. His anxiety was clawing at him more and more with each passing minute and there was nothing he could do to stop it. He closed his eyes for a second as if it would help him with the battle raging on inside but all it did was make his head spin.
‘What the…’ Hermione frowned. Draco was shocked but wouldn’t have thought anything of it if it weren’t for the tingle in his palm. He wiggled his fingers absent-mindedly and the shelf shot back up on the shelf like nothing had happened. They looked at each other with wide eyes.
‘Draco, thank heavens you’re here. She’s locked herself in her room and I'm not even sure she can hear us anymore. We’ve been trying for two hours to get in.’ Susan was a very patient woman, Draco had learned, one of the things that made her so good at her job, but she looked like she’d met her wit’s end.
and disappeared into the flames.
‘Draco we can’t do that! That’s wrong!’ Draco rolled his eyes.
‘I like to think after a while you would’ve found whatever it was you were looking for and come back.’
‘No of course I’m not.’ He snapped. ‘What would you like me to do? Go to pieces over something I have literally no control over? Is it ideal news? No, it isn’t. But that’s not what we’re here for.’ He barked. Harry visibly recoiled and he felt like a dick.
A minute passed. Then five. Then ten. Once again, he recited “
‘…ok.’ He re-joined the girls who were giggling with each other conspiratorially.
‘The first thing you need to know is that while you were at Hogwarts, Draco moved back in. But before you get too excited, there are a few things you should know.’ Teddy stayed very still and very quiet, and Draco was too anxious to sit down with the pair of them, so he strode over to one of the many living room windows. He was grateful to be inside; the wind was howling, and sleety rain was lashing at each of the panels. He felt cosy being indoors, although his nerve damage never let him feel toasty warm like he used to.
‘No, I feel fine.’ He frowned when Harry reached towards him, but he quickly caught on that he was unbuttoning his shirt. His fingers shook as he fumbled with each button, but Draco didn’t try to take over, because he knew he would do the same. It was agonising, and each time Harry’s fingers danced over Draco’s skin, goosebumps quickly followed.
‘I see it hasn’t taken you two long to talk about me behind my back.’ Harry’s voice almost matched Draco’s in its grogginess as he appeared from behind Hermione, but it still made Draco’s heart swoop inside his chest. Or maybe that was the potions.
‘I can feel you thinking. Stop it and go to sleep.’ Draco ripped his fingers from Harry’s as he felt the walls he’d so carefully built slam back down. How long had Harry been awake? Letting Draco stare at him like he held the key to the universe. He couldn’t let him think that he could admit to sleeping with someone else and Draco would smile and brush it off like it was nothing.
“Say I don’t. Explain it to Remus, he doesn’t know anything,” Harry tried. He had a hunch this would be yet more evidence of something being out of place.
When the song ended, the emotional outpouring was replaced with the same impassive expression Harry was so used to seeing on her. She didn’t make any attempts to engage with the audience like some of the others had, but in a way he liked that she invited her audience in while keeping it at a distance.
‘And can I assume,’ he began slowly, ‘that my involvement in this case can be taken as reassurance that I’m not a suspect?’ He hated how much he sounded like his father, but he was not about to play games.
‘So that’s why you like this show.’ Draco was going to come up with a witty response, he really was, but he was sleepy, and Harry was comfy, and he really couldn’t be bothered.
‘Are you sure that’s all it is?’ Draco sighed and held Harry’s face in both of his hands.
‘You did perfect. Thank you.’ It occurred to him that he hadn’t felt anxious at all the whole time, neither had his mark bothered him as it had been in the past few days. He wondered if Harry had noticed too but he wouldn’t ask him that now.
Whilst he was shampooing his hair, Harry walked into the bathroom. Draco wasn’t impressed that Harry didn’t have boundaries, but he supposed that was the joy of marriage. Well, they weren’t technically married anymore. A spike of anxiety hit him as he was reminded of how unstable everything was yet again. He didn’t know these people who didn’t believe in marriage – for him it was that ultimate safety blanket, a reminder that Harry would always be there even when Draco wasn’t the easiest person to live with. A safety blanket that was no longer there.
Rubbing the side of his neck awkwardly he turned away from Draco. ‘I don’t think you’d believe me if I told you. Not that I don’t want to! Of course, I want to do anything that’ll help you believe me, it’s just- wait. I could…show you?’
Draco swallowed hard. She was really quite menacing when she wanted to be. “If you have no concern for my wellbeing, why does it even matter?”
She placed the fox gently on the table and pulled off the blanket Harry had wrapped it in. It had been impossible to get the fox to leave the flat unless Harry blocked most of its vision so that it couldn't see where it was going, otherwise it threw a fit and started spitting at him.
at this early hour…”
Breakfast had always been their time together, even though Pansy was a horror in the mornings. From their first day at school they had bonded over tea and toast and it had become a kind of ritual of sorts. Except this breakfast was very different.
‘From your favourite patisserie in France? I’m positive I wouldn’t have a clue.’ Harry said with fake innocence. Draco’s jaw dropped.
‘The nice ladies don’t like me anymore.’ She fiddled with the corners of the book Draco had finished reading.
nice to see you looking so
Then again, his own naivety wasn’t so far behind. Did he really echo his father that much? He had his own mind; he had always been capable of making his own decisions.
‘Yeah, I’m not sure it was the right thing to do. Coming back here…’ He trailed off, not having the words to say. ‘Anyway,’ he said as he straightened his posture, ‘it’s not about me, it’s about Harry.’
The Ministry was the same as ever when he arrived. The wizard who checked his fake ID slip barely even glanced at him before letting him through without question. That was especially worrying considering how soon out of the war they were – he would have expected security measures to be much more stringent than that. It was almost too easy.
Ron glanced down at the chessboard for a split second before saying anything. “Good to see you not looking like a ghost, mate. Sorry I dropped in like that, I didn’t know you weren’t well. The bloody fox was driving me mad though,”
‘I decided,’ Teddy started. Draco glanced sideways at him, but he didn’t stop what he was doing. ‘I don’t think I’m too cool for hugs anymore.’ He clung onto Draco’s waist awkwardly from beside him and Draco nearly dropped the plate in his hands.
He walked over to the bed and got in fully clothed. He shivered violently against the icy cold sheets no one ever slept in. He could hardly see in the dark – without his magic he could barely see much anyway – but he tried to look at the room. He’d decorated it in blue, one of his favourite colours besides green. It gave the room quite a regal look in his opinion. Particularly with the thick satin curtains by the window which he now realised he’d forgotten to close. He couldn’t be bothered to get back out of the bed to close them now.
“Aspen,” Harry said quietly, “do you know the forest in the dreams?” Harry’s heart felt as though it could burst at any moment, with excitement or fear he couldn’t quite tell. The fox’s silver eyes blazed. He keened with affirmation.
“Do you think we’re ready?” She whispered through the dark as if someone might hear. He hadn’t taken Granger for one susceptible to last minute nerves.
“What’s all this about?” Harry asked him. Draco didn’t answer at first, and a knot formed in Harry’s stomach as he thought he’d said something wrong. What if this was a ‘sorry we can’t be friends’ picnic or a ‘this was a mistake and I don’t really like you’ picnic? Harry’s palms started to sweat, but he realised if it was anything like that the chances of Draco sitting with him like this would be slim.
Harry may not like reading very much, but he definitely likes making his boyfriend happy.
An uncomfortable tightness coiled in his gut. He had mulled over the whole thing so many times that he could practically see Potter’s determined face slipping through the Ministry wards. However, as much as Draco had pondered his complicity, never once had it occurred to him that Potter might have
He didn’t want to move when he woke up the following morning. It wasn’t a regular occurrence that they woke up still wrapped up in each other. More often than not, they moved apart during their sleep, and on the occasions that they didn’t, Draco usually found himself as Harry’s human pillow. That morning, Draco woke up nearly on top of Harry, like he’d tried to climb into him in his sleep. He should move, he knew he should, he just didn’t want to. He got to have this to himself. A sleepy Harry, with a sweet little pout and even messier hair than usual. No one got to see him like this except Draco, and he was the luckiest man in the world.
‘I do apologise. I seem to have given you the impression that you have some sort of choice in the matter.’ He strode over to the other side of the room. Draco wondered what he was doing until he spun the desk chair around. Harry had been in the room the whole time and Draco hadn’t even noticed.
“The bloody hell is that racket?” Ron was standing behind Harry and blocked the kitchen light, plunging the fox back into the darkness of the hallway. The fox immediately ceased making a sound and Harry could vaguely make out the fox curling up at his feet, its fur acting like a mini furnace.
He seemed surprised at that. His eyebrows lifted just a fraction, but it was a minute or two before he spoke. ‘Not at all. You make it sound so interesting. Anyway, the Draco I know would never apologise for his own intelligence.’ Draco supposed he had changed a lot, but then, some of it was for the better.
He didn’t want to appear too eager to know the details, but in truth he was terrified. “Where?” It was difficult to keep his voice steady but he just about managed. Surely, it couldn’t be good news if Potter had been separated from his wand? He could picture green eyes and messy black hair. The honeyed sound of Potter’s laugh echoed in his ears and made his chest ache. He had gone about this all wrong and Potter could be lost to him forever. To them.
The song was softer than the version Harry was familiar with. Malfoy sang it slower too, like she had all the time in the world to hit each note with perfect clarity. Harry had no idea Malfoy could sing like that – her voice was soft and rich, and it floated up to the higher notes as if it took no effort at all. It was as though a summer breeze was sweeping through the room and ruffling Harry’s hair.
‘The portkey leaves in two minutes. Have you got everything?’ Draco nodded and looked down at the small, mother of pearl button that had been designated for their journey. He found it insulting that such a small, insignificant object held more power than he did. He took a deep breath to prepare himself. Harry took his hand and gave him a small smile of sympathy. It wasn’t much, but it quelled Draco’s anxiety a little to know at least Harry was going with him this time. He’d sent an owl to Teddy to tell him what was going on, but they hadn’t had a chance to floo call yet. He missed his little boy terribly – he felt as though he’d been robbed of precious time with him. He’d been trying not to think about it.
‘Maybe?’ The tingle in his palm was gone as quickly as it had arrived, and he wasn’t sure he could do it again if he tried.
‘Draco, love, I can’t ask you to do that. Not for someone like him. You’re anxiety-’
“It’s weird. There being another pub in the middle of Diagon, I mean. It’s always just been the Leaky,” Ron said after a while. Harry realised he had turned and was looking down the opposite end of Diagon where the buildings were shabbier. It was unrecognisable compared to how it had looked when Harry first arrived with Hagrid. The Quidditch supply shop was still there, as was the menagerie and the apothecary, but Gambol and Japes had eventually gone out of business – unable to compete with the Weasleys. Fortescue had died a few years ago and the ice cream parlour had become an artisan coffee shop which Hermione loved but Harry thought was way overpriced. Madam Malkin had moved her shop up to York where the wizard community had grown exponentially since the war, the empty building boarded up and faded.
“I have questions.”
‘Actually, I just saw him out in the tent with Hugo.’ Draco supplied helpfully.
‘Hm. You’re still a git but…you’re my git.’ It was difficult to get his head around, but he had to try. For all their sakes. Harry pulled him in for another kiss and Draco could feel him smiling against his lips. Even after they pulled away, they stood in each other’s arms just for the sake of being close to each other.
‘I’ll be upstairs, you talk to him.’ He mouthed. At least, that’s what Draco understood from the general shape his mouth made. Coward. Harry disappeared out the door faster than he’d seen him move in ages.
It didn’t register with him until he was opening the large doors to his favourite bedroom suite, that he’d produced that small quip as naturally as he blinked and yet it had sounded so much like his former self. Maybe there was hope after all.
“Do you need some help with that?” Ron asked him, indicating towards the livid marks, concern etched all over his face.
‘You know, you won’t be able to do this much. You can’t go around picking favourite kids. I know she’s sweet and she’s taken to you but if you do things like this for her and not the others, they’ll start to feel left out. What are you going to do when the muggle protocols are in place and we’ve got double the capacity?’ Draco’s heart sank but he knew Harry was right. He supposed he missed having someone to spoil. He loved Teddy more than anything, but he was getting older and developing his own interests and making his own friends and it didn’t matter to him so much what Draco did. He saw all the small children running around at The Burrow on Christmas Day and he missed it.
‘You’re beautiful you know.’ Harry said as he set Draco down on the newly charm-extended sofa. When had Harry managed to do that? The sneaky bastard.
He stumbled out of the floo in the Manor drawing room, feeling rather lightheaded, when he collided with something solid and smelling strongly of vanilla.
Essentially, Harry knew make up was no more or less an artform that brushes on a canvas, but what Harry couldn’t
‘Let’s not think about it now. Today is for better things.’ Harry offered him his hand once again and they left the empty shop and made their way towards Notre Dame. They walked around to the West Façade, Draco’s favourite, and he took in the sheer immensity of the gothic architecture.
Harry couldn’t help but watch Malfoy’s hands as she wrote to Remus. The way her long fingers twirled the pen every now and again was almost as mesmerising as watching her play her guitar. Each word was carefully and precisely placed on the page; each loop immaculate and perfectly uniform. He could watch her like this all day, head bent over the paper, brow slightly furrowed in concentration. Over the past few weeks and months he really felt like he was starting to see the person she was under her armour of insults and haughtiness. Even if there was still the occasional slip.
‘He didn’t tell you?’ She asked him. Draco shook his head.
‘Bloody hell,’ Harry muttered under his breath.
When Monday morning loomed, Draco dragged himself out of his hovel and into the Ministry, with little hope of achieving anything remotely useful. Instead of going to his small office, Draco headed straight up to see the Minister’s secretary who was fully prepared for an argument when the minister himself appeared.
‘Don’t ruin it.’ That made Harry laugh.
Pansy, to his surprise, looked positively thrilled to see him as he arrived outside the chateau. He supposed that was more likely to do with the bitter cold than her enthusiasm over seeing him. He was even more surprised to find she hadn’t come alone.
‘But you can’t be busy! Dad has a date with the nice lady with the books!’ Teddy burst out.
“You silly sausage,” he said with mild exasperation as he felt water seep through his jeans. “Can you go five minutes without making a mess, hm?”
‘We, Draco. You’ve been there since the beginning.’ Draco didn’t say anything to that.
November 1999
‘Why don’t we agree that it stops today? It doesn’t have to be that way. Think about all the things we’ve done together. We didn’t let the backlash stop us getting married. We didn’t care when everyone thought you must’ve cursed me or poisoned me with amortentia. We didn’t care when they said I was using my fame to promote a political agenda. Look how well we did when we first decided to raise Teddy together. There were so many times when it was us against the world and we made it. We just have to find it again.’
‘I saw your pretty little ex-husband the other day. What a shame it would be if something were to happen to him. He really is lovely, although he’s not really my type…’ Wood staggered and fell against the alley wall, scraping his cheek against the rough brick.
“Wow, this place is amazing,” Harry says as he steps closer to the middle of the room. It’s a long and thin space, about half the length of the Great Hall – no mean feat considering the Manor is far from a castle.
‘Let’s go and look at Quidditch things first, yeah?’ Draco said with a tight voice.
The two animals circled each other. Each time Sirius came in closer Aspen gnashed his teeth in warning. Harry tried to let it play out, but he could tell that Aspen was only being aggravated and, in the end, he had to quite literally risk life and limb to separate them again.
‘I know you don’t. I’m just saying I could. So long as I still have you.’ Draco’s voice cracked at the end and Harry’s heart shattered.
‘Will be a lot better if I don’t have to worry about that smug git’s face.’ Draco cut across him.
‘You’re squishing meeeee!’ Teddy squealed from between them and Harry reluctantly let go. ‘Are you going to tell me what’s going on then?’ He looked between Draco and Harry expectantly. He reached out to hold onto Draco’s hand – Draco wasn’t even sure he realised he’d done it – and he was amused to see Teddy was indeed wearing last year’s Weasley jumper, a good inch and a half too short on his arms. Honestly, Harry had always been useless with the packing.
‘DRACO!’ He flailed helplessly as he slammed back to reality.
‘Potter.’ Draco nodded vaguely in Harry’s direction and winced slightly when he got a
“Is this your apology for destroying my blanket, or my bathroom?” He asked as he finally located the phone in his bedside table drawer. The fox tilted its head up with an air of sophistication and looked at him with sharp grey eyes as if to say
Although Aspen loved meeting new people, he was very anxious whenever Harry took him somewhere new. Whilst the easiest solution to this would have been to have everyone come to them, Harry and Ron’s flat was far too small for a fox, and it was very important that Aspen got to explore outside and dig for things until his heart’s content. So, Aspen often ran free in Luna’s shielded garden and although he had destroyed a couple of hydrangeas and one unfortunate rhubarb plant, it was going really well.
He didn’t need to look long to find the memory he was looking for, it was the most viewed of all the memories he had collected in the few short years since he’d been doing this. After the war, a mind healer had told him viewing his memories from a distance might help him understand the trauma he went through. At the time he’d thought it was bullshit but it seemed to help, and he’d been doing it ever since.
Draco thought. He didn’t want to go back to his horrible little flat.
‘Oh yeah!’ Realisation dawned on his face and Draco laughed so hard his sides ached.
“I was doing some research after you told me what Harry said. There isn’t very much on the Veil because no one really knows anything about it, but I keep hearing about an experiment carried about by the Unspeakables, before they were the Unspeakables, which would allow people to pass through for a short period of time and come back again.” Draco stared at her as she brought her teacup to her lips. What did this have to do with anything? No one really knew when the Unspeakables were formed, but it had to be hundreds of years ago. Surely if any experiment like that had been a success, the Ministry would have been very careful not to leave any traces of it anywhere.
‘What happened? Please don’t tell me it was because of me.’ Hermione pushed some hair away from Draco’s forehead and he was surprised by the gentleness of the gesture. He and Hermione had been good friends for a long time, but physical contact beyond the occasional hug was never much of a thing.
‘You know what I mean,’ Harry glanced at him sideways to make sure he knew Harry was joking, ‘you watch him like he’s a china doll.’ Draco shrugged.
‘Men.’ Pansy said with a roll of her eyes, but Draco knew she didn’t mean it because she’d failed to conceal her amused smile. She picked at her bright red fingernails as she waited.
It didn’t even matter that he couldn’t sleep. This place, wherever it was, was warm and safe, not like his cell. Even if Potter knew it was Draco, he wouldn’t exactly have turned him out on the street either, would he? The weasel would have, but then Draco shouldn’t expect any less based on how he’d treated him and the whole weasel clan over the years.
There was a storm raging. Streaks of brilliant white cracked across the sky making Draco’s room flare bright before being plunged into darkness again. Less than a second later its partner in crime boomed through the air, nearly making Draco’s teeth rattle in his gums. He had always hated thunderstorms, but this one was important.
Draco smirked. ‘When doesn’t she?’
‘They tried to bump me off for being a traitor.’ Draco filled in the blanks.
‘And if I hadn’t been such a dick about it you wouldn’t have tried to cast that stupid spell.’ Draco huffed. They could talk themselves in circles about it, but it wouldn’t get them anywhere.
Draco was on board with.
‘I don’t wanna go.’ Teddy said into Draco’s shoulder and he was sure he had an actual pain in his heart. He wanted to tell Teddy that Draco didn’t want him to go either, but this was the most important day of Teddy’s life so far and all issues aside, Teddy needed Harry and Draco to be there for him today.
‘You’ll be able to when you’re older. You haven’t learnt how to channel your power enough yet.’ Teddy placed the star on the highest point and Harry let him down again. Teddy had seemed lighter since their little chat, although Draco felt like he was watching him, waiting for something. He wasn’t wrong either
Granger stared at him like he was an idiot. “Because next time it might be someone who doesn’t deserve it.” She seemed taken aback by her own harshness, but it was true. He would be lying if that didn’t sting a bit, but he sort of did deserve it.
Now that caught Draco’s attention.
Harry scrambled up from the table feeling utterly wrong-footed. He had come here to help
A couple of days after their talk when Draco had blown up in Harry’s face, he found himself in one of the upper floor apartments. It was the day of their date and whilst Draco hadn’t been impressed when Harry told him it was yet another surprise – Harry had at least assured him Draco was familiar with the place he was taking him. He supposed that would have to do.
‘Are you ok? You look pale? Was it too much? You should have said.’ Draco shook his head and slowly pulled his shirt up and over his head. He watched as Harry’s worry melted into confusion and right back to shock again.
had printed yet another article about Draco’s connections to the dark arts.
. It means always pure. An affectation, something to make them sound fancier than they were. It’s all for show Potter, it always has been.’ Draco was surprised to find Harry laughing.
‘Really. He’s a natural born flyer of course, couldn’t believe it when they said he’d grown up muggle-’
“And why the hell are you letting them do this?!” Pansy rounded on Draco. She was running behind the three of them as he was escorted out of his home, her thin heels clacking loudly on the marble flooring in the hall. There was no way to explain himself to her without implicating himself further in the accusation. He could only look at her pleadingly.
He threw away the unopened mail. Anyone important knew where to find him now anyway. Next, he turned his attention to the small pile of
“These are written in Latin.”
Harry was surprised at first, but after a few seconds returned the kiss as though he needed the air from Draco’s lungs to breathe. His fingers skimmed up Draco’s sides with such a featherlight touch that Draco's skin tingled in their wake. Heat radiated through his body from where their lips touched all the way to his toes and he wondered why people didn’t live like this. It was euphoric.
‘Now you care.’ He stared at Harry, not knowing what to do. The responsible thing would be to listen to him. He wasn’t strong enough physically to keep moving to and from his flat, but he wasn’t strong enough in any other way to deal with what Harry had just said.
‘No you don’t.’
‘Stop that.’ Harry hissed behind his smile as he waved at Teddy. Draco frowned for a split second before he realised he was fidgeting, shifting his weight from one foot to the other like a maniac. He stood stock still immediately and Harry shot him a strange look.
‘You’re right, it’s a good idea.’ Harry nodded and took his hand. ‘Just let me know if it’s too much, ok? I don’t want the same thing happening again ok?’ Draco thought back to the Thai place in muggle London, the one they’d been to when Harry had been promoted. His heart swelled at the difference, at the attention Harry paid to Draco’s anxiety. There was a niggle, a small seed of doubt in the back of his mind that maybe it was just because he was physically sick that it mattered more, but he pushed it aside. Harry was sitting across from him, looking at him like he was the whole world, and he was inclined to believe it.
“Yes!”
‘Hey, we should be heading off Harry.’ He heard Hermione saying, Hugo asleep in her arms.
“Which door is it?” He hissed in Granger’s ear. She was looking ahead with a frown on her face. It worried him because he had been reliant on her knowing her way around. And then came the rumble. Granger had obviously waited for this to happen, but she hadn’t warned Draco. They stood in the middle of the room as the doors around the edges started to rotate into new positions. It was impossible to tell which door they’d entered through and therefore would get back out of.
“I think we should talk.” She said after a while. Something tightened in his chest.
Draco used to hate the aftermath of Christmas. He hated it, because it was that awkward time between Christmas and New Years that wasn’t really a holiday, yet everyone was off work and no one seemed to know what day of the week it was. This year, however, he felt like that most of the time, the only difference was that he wasn’t alone in the feeling.
‘I have no idea,’ he said with a sighed. Daphne pulled Ella’s hair back and caught some of it between her fingers.
“As ready as we can be,” he replied, her whispering contagious.
‘I still don’t know if I should,’ he admitted.
Harry had promised Ron that he was only allowing the fox to stay in the flat until he could figure out what to do with it, but that wasn’t exactly true. Straight away he was drawn to it. After all, why would a silver fox just
He looked up at the door. ‘Sissy?’ Draco had never heard him call her that before.
He slipped under the covers and shivered. He’d always cast warming charms on his side of the bed. Harry might be a human furnace, but Draco certainly was not. The bed warmed instantaneously, and Draco’s head flicked over to Harry’s side of the bed.
‘He will.’ He reached across the table and took one of Harry’s hands in his own. ‘You’re great with him, you know? I know you were never meant to raise him, but he loves you more than anything and I trust that you’ve raised him to be strong enough to deal with anything.’
‘I’m Helen!’ She told him brightly. As if he asked. She stepped aside to let him in and he swept down the hallway like he owned the place. Well, to be fair he had owned the place once upon a time.
‘Don’t give up the day job.’ Harry swatted at him, but he couldn’t help but crack a smile. Thankfully, Gabriel gave them some other pastries to enjoy in case their own weren’t all they were cracked up to be. Draco would’ve been offended at his lack of confidence in his culinary expertise, but as one of his mille-feuille sank in the middle he thought that was probably for the best.
“You say that like I care. We’re not friends.” She spat with the kind of venom he wouldn’t have thought her capable of mere moments ago.
When Harry was done, the tension could be cut with a knife. Even Lyra didn’t quite know where to look as she flung her jumper over her head and darted out of the room.
Sirius sat patiently and waited for Harry to figure out what it was that he wanted. He had always known what Harry needed, even though he had been missing for so many years of Harry’s life.
lived in my house. I know he was there, as in, factually I know it, but I don’t have any specific memories of it. All I remember was the fear. A few days ago, Harry asked me about my wand and I’d completely forgotten he’d taken it from me. I mean, I knew he had, but I’d forgotten that he had it and he used it to defeat
know Rihanna?’ He grinned in vaguely the right direction.
Since his delightful stay in the Ministry holding cell, the situation had been explained to him, via Granger, who was actually a great help even if he resented her manner. A witness in the Leaky that day had come forward with a suggestion that Draco might have had something to do with Potter’s disappearance, based on claiming to have seen him slipping out of the side entrance of the Ministry near the estimated day of Potter’s disappearance – 7
“Where did you find this?” He asked Granger. Pansy was practically vibrating in her seat.
When he kicked off the ground and the breeze blew through his hair, he didn’t give a fuck whether this was within his house arrest restrictions or not. Being careful to stay within the boundaries of the wards, he flew higher and higher until all he could see was the Manor roof and the sprawling fields around it. The high hedges that framed the edges of the grounds looked comical from up here – who did they think they were stopping from seeing in? There were no neighbours for miles.
“What does it matter? There are plenty of things you don’t know about me.” The fox started crying at them because he was no longer centre of attention. Harry automatically stroked between his ears and he quietened.
“I’m sure there are.” Harry replied slowly. There was an edge to the way Malfoy had said it, like she was laying down some unspoken challenge that Harry was supposed to recognise. Could it be that she
“I think you’ve told me what you can. I can’t say I’m grateful since you should have told me this
Still, and call it his inner Slytherin cunning, he was sure this wasn’t a coincidence. Someone, maybe at the bank, maybe someone who knew something about Draco’s situation, wanted him to leave as soon as possible.
‘I don’t see how any of this is supposed to help.’ He was angry, he felt trapped in this small room with no windows. Who thought this was a good place for therapy anyway? Make the scarred people feel claustrophobic. Genius.
‘I didn’t stop loving him, Teddy. It’s difficult for you to understand because you’re so young. Sometimes when you love people you have to let them go so that they can be happier and sometimes they go and they’re not happier and they want to come back, and other times they don’t.’
‘The patients have been exposed to a high level done of Aconite Violaceum.’ He announced.
Draco was floored. He had been so busy with Latin translations and planning with Granger that he hadn’t factored Pansy into the equation. Throughout school he had been contented with the fact that Pansy was far from academic. Their friendship was built on Pansy’s love of Draco’s piano playing and Draco’s reliance on Pansy’s unwavering ability to give him better advice than anyone. It hadn’t occurred to him that she was watching her best friend risk a spell in Azkaban and her girlfriend put her career on the line for a man she didn’t particular like and certainly didn’t miss. He had been heartless.
‘Did you really name this one after my dad?’ He asked the same question every time and always got the same response. At least, he did before Wood worked there.
Harry met them downstairs and signed the sheet with the time of their departure. Ella was holding tightly onto Draco’s hand and bouncing excitedly on the balls of her feet. Draco only hoped the surprise would live up to her expectation.
card, but there were some things even Harry’s fame couldn’t buy. Ginny’s pregnancy had hit Draco pretty hard, but now that Pansy was pregnant with her second child, Harry wasn’t sure Draco could hold out hope for much longer.
‘That’s all I ever wanted Draco.’ Harry turned to look at him and Draco summoned his confidence and held his eye.
‘How did it go?’ There it was. A surge of annoyance made Draco’s skin prickle uncomfortably even though he knew it was unfair. Harry cared about him, that’s what he had to keep telling himself. Hospital days were the worst for them, since most of the time Draco had nothing new to report. He understood that Harry was concerned, but it was disheartening enough for Draco to hear he was no better, it didn’t help that he had to relive the appointment every time when Harry asked him how it went.
It was then that Draco drew back. “Not here,” he said, “not like this.” He was panting for breath and Harry could only nod in agreement, unable to form words at all. Draco’s head dropped and their foreheads pressed together. Harry closed his eyes and marvellous at the pure luxury of being allowed to touch Draco like that. Of being the person allowed past his walls.
‘Ok, if you don’t want to talk about the past, let’s talk about now. How is your home life?’ Draco scoffed.
‘Harry, if you wanted me here, you could’ve just said so.’ Draco said gently. Harry looked at him with wide green eyes and Draco’s chest tightened. It was doing that a lot these days.
‘Draco.’ Draco refused to open his eyes. ‘Draco please look at me.’ Draco didn’t want to. He shook his head like a petulant child and pressed his lips together to stop himself crying. ‘Draco, come on. I’m on your side here.’ Draco took a deep breath and opened his eyes.
He was making them both hot chocolate and Harry was sitting in the kitchen watching him intently.
Except human children do not make inhuman noises that were jarring in Harry’s ears. The same scratching sound that had alerted him to the fox in the first place had joined the crying, so he went back into the kitchen. The fox was running around the room trying to attack everything within its reach. Luckily the cushioning charms were protecting the surfaces, but it was horrible to hear anyway. He considered casting a silencing charm and going to bed, and probably would have too, except he just couldn’t bring himself to leave it.
‘He kept his flat so he would be here when you came back, yes. But before he moved, the Minister and I needed his help to solve a case. You know how clever he is with his potions, don’t you? There’s no one nearly as good as him.’ Draco smiled. Harry didn’t need to do that, he deserved whatever the fallout would be. ‘He got hurt on our mission because I didn’t take good enough care of him and now he has a bit of a problem with his magic…’
‘It came back?’ He jumped slightly when Pansy took his hand and squeezed it reassuringly.
‘Yes, well, you’d best make the most of your last weekend.’ Harry said with a wistful smile. Draco’s insides froze. It was August. Teddy was starting Hogwarts this year.
“Morning! So, I thought that after we’d checked on the Polyjuice we could- oh, I’ve interrupted something, haven’t I?” Granger walked into the room carrying a stack of books with her nose buried in the topmost volume when she registered the tension in the room. She glanced between Draco and Pansy as if she could figure it out just by looking at them.
‘Oh! Désolé. Harry doesn’t speak any French.’
‘I resent that accusation.’ Draco said playfully.
‘I promise I’ll be ok. I just wanted to see you and make sure you could see me now I’m better again. I won’t have any more accidents now we know why, ok? You can go and enjoy school and not worry about me.’ Teddy didn’t seem convinced and his hair stayed bright blond, but he didn’t argue. Harry took Draco’s hand again and they made their way to the nearest concealed spot – one known for apparition. He was lucky Harry was so powerful really, it must take significant magical power for him to apparate them all.
‘Those Christmas elves are getting sneakier and sneakier every year.’ He teased. He’d laughed the first time he’d explained to Harry that Christmas elves were actually house elves. Supposedly an obliviate went wrong once and knowledge of the elves ended up being told as a muggle fairy-tale.
‘Why do you write in this thing so much?’ Harry asked him a couple of days later. It was unusual, but he’d had a strange dream and he wanted to write it down as soon as he woke up so he didn’t forget it. Draco paused mid-sentence to look at him. There was no anger on his face, but it didn’t seem like a good question.
“Of course, your cousin and I have much to discuss.” Remus smiled and it showed the papery thinness of his skin. Harry glanced at Sirius who was eyeing Remus with concern. Harry had only ever known Remus to look sickly, but he supposed Sirius had more often seen him as a young and, relatively, healthy teenager. Sirius was notably quiet, but Harry hoped that he would open up to Remus in a way that he couldn’t with Harry.
They took a right at the fountain and walked through the rose garden – perhaps the only part of the grounds to have successfully survived the winter. Draco wanted to stop and smell the roses, but now wasn’t the time. Eventually, nestled between the hedgerows separating the rose garden from the wild flowers, they came across what may well be Draco’s favourite place in the world. He had been too busy to spend time here during his little sojourn to France, but he would make up for that in the future.
The day dawned bright and cold and as soon as Draco opened his eyes his stomach filled with jittery nerves. Harry was still asleep next to him and usually Draco would enjoy watching him sleep for a few minutes but today he needed Harry awake to stop him having a meltdown. He knew it was ridiculous for him to be so scared, he should be excited to have Teddy home. Still, he knew it would be a long day for them.
‘Oh. Right. It’s going really well thanks. How’s business?’ Hermione had told him Ron was much happier since he’d quit the aurors and started working at the shop with George. Privately Draco thought George probably needed the extra sibling support. He was doing very well but he still had never been quite the same since his twin had passed. Not that Draco had known him all that well back then to be able to pass comment anyway.
‘Localised disillusionment charm. She never suspected a thing.’
Here he sat and tried to pick apart the wards. He needed to temporarily transfer some of his magic to the house so that it would look as though he was still there. The threads of magic were unbelievably tangled, and it took him a long time to isolate and snap the thread he had been trying to find. This should have been something he tackled during his house arrest, but he really hadn’t thought it would be so bad.
‘Yes, that’s what I came to talk to you about.’ The healer interrupted. ‘We’re willing to let you leave, Mr Potter, as there is very little we can do here; your tests all came back clear. You’re going to have to be patient and wait for your magic to return slowly. It’ll be a very slow process and we’re not sure how much of your magical ability will ever fully return, but that’s a bridge we can cross when we come to it. For now, it’s all about physical rehabilitation. You haven’t moved in weeks and it’s likely you’ll have some muscular degeneration.’ Draco felt like he’d been slapped in the face.
‘Don’t you dare make comments on the state of my marriage. That’s none of your business.’ He spat icily.
‘Oh, Draco. I understand, I really do, but surely there’s something less drastic you can do than moving to another country.’ His gaze dropped to his half-eaten salad. He couldn’t look at her when she was giving him that look with those big brown eyes. Who knew how Ronald didn’t bend to her every whim. Who was he kidding? Of course he did.
His father’s voice came again. ‘Shut up Father!’ Draco whispered.
‘Did he?’ Why would Harry tell Teddy he wasn’t coming when he only invited Draco on Teddy’s behalf?
‘Super-strength Polyjuice,’ he told him with a wicked grin. Harry sat upright, his eyes wide.
‘I think that’s a great idea Ted, you should tell Neville. I’m sure he’d love to help you figure it out.’ Draco knew it was early days for things like that, but it wouldn’t do any harm to encourage his interests. He stood up to clear the plates away after that, effectively putting an end to talk about Hogwarts, although he thought he heard the mention of ghosts over the rushing water from the tap.
The hallway reverberated with chatter from the kitchen and it seemed Harry was wrong. As he approached he felt almost as though he was a naughty schoolkid again, creeping around after hours. Except he wasn’t, he was a grown man, and he needed to get control of the spiralling situation.
‘He doesn’t hate the house, he just didn’t want to see me.’
‘Clearly I will. As for you, the jury’s still out on that one. We’ll just have to wait and see.’ He watched the emotions flit across Harry’s face until he finally settled on a beaming smile.
“We can’t let it out in the street either!” Draco tried not to bristle at being referred to as ‘it’. It was fortunate he was no longer able to speak, as he would have gone on a tirade against Potter invoking his charitability on him. Potter still had his hand in his… fur, and Draco was trying his utmost not to give into the instinct to- to- snuggle. Disgusting.
“Shouldn’t it be my actual name then?” He turns to ask Harry who grins at him broadly and makes his stomach summersault.
‘Look. Harry. I’m not going to sit here while you throw shade at me and complain. If we’re going to talk then fine, but I can’t do it right now. I need to get home and-’
‘I miss you. I’m sorry I don’t visit very often. I didn’t even bring you flowers.’ He’d usually conjure some when he got here but once again, he’d forgotten he couldn’t do that. ‘I often wonder if you’d be happy with the things I’ve done since the war, or if you’d think I’d sold myself out. You were never quite so harsh as father. I like to think you’d understand.’
His head felt woozy as he wandered down to his lab. Mercifully, it was at the opposite side of the dungeons to the old torture cells, or he might never have brewed a potion again in his life. At least he had time to recover his sleep before he actually had to go through with the plan. It almost worried him that he was so calm about it when the entire course of his life depended on what happened when they got to the Ministry.
The coin was the only thing keeping Draco sane. Draco’s cell was high up in the island prison and would have been streaming with sunlight most of the day if the sun could shine on such a tower of despair. The walls were slick with damp and the air smelled like decay. It was easy enough to understand why people went mad in this place even without the dementors, let alone lack of human contact and poor living conditions.
‘This has been a year from hell, not to put too fine a point on it. But, in a lot of ways it’s been the best year of my life. I was a wreck without you, Draco, even if it didn’t look like it. We’ve come a long way to make it right again and although it’s been so hard watching you suffer, I’ll be forever grateful to you for letting me help you heal. I don’t want there to be another day when you don’t wake up beside me and I don’t want Teddy missing out on any more time with you. You always talk about how the kids are little rays of sunshine, but you have no idea that to me you burn brighter than the sun. If we’re going to go ahead with this adoption, I want to do it the right way, so please, be the ultimate pain in my arse again?’
‘What the hell Draco, there are hundreds of these- you know what, never mind. Now isn’t the time.’ He propped Draco up enough that he could down the potion and Draco flopped boneless back onto the bed. He felt the potion run through him and it almost made him feel a little drunk.
“It’s ok to be worried, Granger. I miss him too.” Draco snapped his mouth shut and regretted his words immediately when Granger stared at him like he was crazy. He had no idea what possessed him to say it; he had never ever been susceptible to empathy.
‘Hm. I did always feel like something was missing. Couldn’t put my finger on it at the time.’ Draco admitted.
“It’s called beauty sleep, Weasley. You should try it sometime.” It was still utterly bizarre to Harry that these barbs were actually the banter of friendship, but he also loved it.
‘Draco you shouldn’t do this on your own. I should watch them with you, or we should have someone else here, like Smith. What if something happens and I don’t know what you’ve seen?’ Draco shook his head.
‘Night.’
‘Then what is?’
‘House elf.’ He said casually. ‘Apparently I disrupted his sleep.’
“I’ve never seen anything quite like this…” Granger said with wonder as they approach the deep mahogany door. Even Draco could admit that it was an impressive door. It was goblin-made, back in the days before they got big-headed and only worked with precious metal. The wood was intricately carved with all kinds of ancient pureblood symbolisms – a mixture between standard emblems like swans and bees, and family-specific engravings such as the Malfoy family crest. Draco read the words
swhich had stacked up in his absence. He scooped them off the table to add to the rubbish pile when a headline on the most recent one caught his eye.
