“The treatment she’s having right now will help with her strength, give her longer, but they still think a year at the longest. So she may move back to the Manor. At...at the end. But for now. I’ll stay there with her in London.”
Once they are settled in a booth in the tiny bar, Hermione with a Krušovice, Harry with a Pilsner Urquell, she gives him a long appraising look. "I didn't realise. You seemed down, after, but I thought you'd moved on. I know you and Nathan didn't work out, but you and him seemed happy until recently. I even thought he might move in." She takes a sip of her beer, but Harry stays silent, staring down at his beer. She nudges his hand and waits until he looks up. Her voice is soft, "It's been over three years since Draco left."
After Ron has finished locking down ‘Harry’s Corridor’ he transfigures a doorstop from the vase on the windowsill, props open the door. Malfoy settles himself into one of the chairs in the corridor across from it, while Ron and Hermione settle themselves on the chairs inside the room.
She grins at Harry. It is a running joke of theirs. When his advanced wandless skills had got him noticed by the Unspeakables, along with the private research he’d been doing on wandlore and the natural channelling of magic, he’d jumped at the chance to transfer over. Officially he was still an Auror, his title was down as a Consultant Investigator, which meant his absence in the day to day cases was less noticeable.
“Yes, she said you had.” Then Draco’s face crumples like paper, a kind of despair and grief written across it that Harry hasn’t seen on him since 6th Year. It is soul deep, and shattering to watch.
"I need you to get Healer Green here, Granger. I need to show him the files on this case." She sees now the worn leather satchel lying on the visitors' chairs, haphazardly collected papers sticking out of the top. His look is pleading.
"Why isn't there someone from the DMLE here? Injuries on active duty always trigger a presence from personnel? Why couldn't they request Healer Green themselves?"
Her skin more translucent, but she still exudes grace and elegance. She looks up at him then and he smiles and walks forward. “He wrote you then? I had wondered if he really would.” He kneels down in front of the bench and takes her hands and kisses the back of one of them. He can feel tears pricking at his eyes.
Stood in front of the door to a room is a Junior Healer. He's planted himself in a firm stance, hand in warning on the wand at his waist.
Softening her voice, she tries again. "Please get Senior Healer Green. On my say so." She can see he's still torn. The mere presence of Malfoy has rubbed him up the wrong way, and he doesn't want to deviate from protocol. She hardens her voice again. "Do it. Or you can be the one to explain the resulting condition of Senior Investigating Auror Potter to the Minister personally." He concedes with wide eyes and a nod, making his way out of the double swing doors back into the main areas of the ward.
“Please, Harry. Sorry. I.” He swallows. “I was going to write to you.” Harry barks out an incredulous laugh and turns towards Draco.
"Yeah. Fuck. I need to go and see her. I've been avoiding it. I've seen her at Andi's, although not recently, but then there's the distraction of Teddy. I've not been to see her on my own." He feels so guilty. He and Narcissa had been on friendly terms. A weird by-product of Ministry enforced reconciliation efforts. It was through her that he'd met up with Draco again, back in the days when Draco was still Malfoy to him. Seeing her alone again after he left had felt too much.
"Malfoy? What happened? You tell me right now. Why are you here, why is that globe in your hand rather than in that of DMLE personnel, and why couldn't you contact Robards yourself?"
He nods and grabs her wrist, dragging them sideways from where they are stood until they are shielded by a large pot plant. “Fuck. What do I do?” He cranes his head around to see if Malfoy can see them, before looking back at her. His breathing is fast. “Hermione, I don’t think I can...”
“I’m sorry, ‘Mione.” She’s heard it so many times before. He quirks a smile at her, hopefully, takes her hand and she scowls at him. She knows she’ll forgive him. He’s her brother in all but the law.
Draco slows out of his stride and glides to a halt. He’s not saying anything and Harry takes the opportunity to look him over. Despite his obvious discomfort at being here, in this corridor with Harry, he does look good. He used to never look like he’d eaten a square meal. Now, while still lean, it is with a hint of muscle. Draco shifts a little, puts his hands in his pockets then takes them back out again.
It strikes him then that he never really got a chance to know a Draco who wasn't either weighed down by the angry or unrealistic expectations and opinions of the world around him, or frozen by visceral fear.
"That's the thing Hermione. I don't think it is ever going to matter how long ago it was." His voice is muffled as he talks into the tabletop.
It is so pervasive in Britain that he often forgets that it wasn’t everyone else’s War. That they don’t know all the ins and outs, all the names. It would undoubtedly have become their problem too, over time. He doubts Riddle’s ambition stopped at the coast of Britain, or even at the fringes of Europe but, as it is, they never had to find out.
“Well, well. I’m guessing this is one of your lot? You’re the spit of him.” Draco glances across at the photo Harry is holding out. His stomach clenches. Someone in Mysteries has fucked up. Royally.
"I could come with you? I mean, only if she's at the London house. I'm not going to Malfoy Manor. I love you, but not that much." She smiles as she says it, but Harry knows she means it. She has no desire to confront those demons.
“Neither hide nor hair. I reckon we slip into the hall right before they close the doors, and then we just take whatever seats are left.” She’s eyeing the doors. The stream of people is slowing to a trickle and the organisers are stood at the doors, ready to shut them behind the last attendees to enter.
Malfoy runs his hand’s through his hair. "He didn't clear it before he went. No back up, no extraction Portkey. Nothing! This was sat on his desk." He's still gripping the smoke filled globe. "I need to contact Robards. But he's at that conference. I didn't know who else was authorised. We weren't ready to go live yet."
Despite the difficulty of the situation, the volatility of his emotions, Harry finds himself drawn in by the speakers. He truly does love his job, and this stuff is fascinating. He tries to get his head in the right place, he’s been looking forward to this conference for weeks. The chair is skillful, linking the points the speakers make, framing the debate in wider terms. Harry finds himself scribbling furiously, particularly with regards to the presenter from New Zealand. Her work on the gathering and dispersing of natural magic has been a very useful reference for his own work. He wrote her a letter, back in the early days of his Unspeakable career and she very kindly replied to the questions he had posed. He sent her a copy of the resulting paper when it was published, along with his thanks.
Before he gives himself completely over to this, before he loses his thoughts to the intoxicating attention of the man he loves, he forms a plan. Tomorrow he’ll get his mother talking about the garden immediately, while he goes and primes Myron. He’s always seemed a decent sort, unlike Abraxas. He’s likely to agree to a favour. Cover for him for a short while.
After Ron has stepped into the room and assured himself of Harry’s relative wellbeing he exits to the corridor and secures the swing doors with a modified locking charm. No one but medical staff will be able to enter this dead end of the ward.
It takes a few seconds for her to take the unusual situation in. He's dressed in what at first glance look like Muggle clothes. Finely cut navy wool jersey trousers, in a harem style, a soft navy long sleeved t-shirt with an iridescent sheen to it. His long hair is caught back in a knot at the nape of his neck. He's got a plain silver ring on his left thumb. She's seen those before. Knows an Unspeakable when she sees one.
The examination of the rather beautiful magical paintings of landscapes in the entrance hall while away the few minutes until Tassy calls him through. “Mistress is being in the garden, Master Harry. She is being in the garden a lot since we is moving here.” She looks up at him mournfully. “Tassy is being glad Master Harry is coming back. Mistress will be needing you all.” Then she’s gone with a crack, leaving Harry stood at the exit out to the rear garden.
Fleeing at the end of the session, Harry makes it almost all the way to the stairs before he hears hurried footsteps behind him.
Hermione is already halfway out into the street, she looks back at him, "There's a nice little bar I know down here, you can still get me that beer."
She'd heard rumours, of course. Noted both Harry and Ron's obfuscation on the subject when they were asked.
The wait feels like forever. Ron goes and gets them all coffee and pastries from the hospital canteen. They all drink the coffee, but merely pick at the food. Hermione is dosing slightly when she hears a muffled cry. When she starts awake and looks around she sees Malfoy as he holds out the alert globe to Ron. The yellow is gone, the smoke a pale grey fading quickly out to white, striped through with wisps of purple. Ron takes it gently from the Unspeakable's hand and places it inside his satchel. Malfoy drops his head into his hands, elbows rested on his knees. Ron’s hand rests on his back between his shoulder blades. Hermione drops her head back to the wall and drops back into a fitful sleep.
He groans as Draco finds a particularly knotty muscle in his calf. "I'm so glad you don't have to bring home your work. Your fingers are
“You spoke then?” Her voice is hopeful, and he hates to crush that but he’s not going to give her false hope.
“Thanks ‘Mione.” He pulls her into a soft side hug as they enter the hotel doors. “I’m Unspeakably grateful.” She groans at the terrible joke.
Draco looks up at Harry with glassy eyes. “She doesn’t want it made public. If anyone asks then I am to say I am in London for work reasons, and she wants to spend time with me for the limited period I’m in the country. At some point we won’t be able to hide it, but she’d rather try and avoid the inevitable press interest for as long as possible. So, I’d be grateful if you could be discrete. Tell Hermione and Weasley of course, if you wish, but otherwise...”
"What the hell have you done, Malfoy? If you have stepped one hair’s breadth out of line and it has harmed him, I swear..."
“She’s that bad?” Harry whispers. Draco’s expression almost collapses again as he nods, but he holds it back, dropping his eyes.
After he finally calmed down in the hallway, and stepped back into the room, it had taken only one questioning look from Narcissa, with arched Malfoy eyebrow, to set him off again. As tears rolling down his face in unrestrained laughter she had bitten her lip to try and control her own resulting mirth. Her reserved facade had finally collapsed at a shocked ‘Please! Auror Potter!’ from the Ministry official. After that they had reached a dark kind of fellow feeling, which transformed over the years of meetings into true friendship.
I have several chapters of this written already, and it has been staring at my accusingly in my drafts. I’m going to post what I have written every few days and get the rest done as I go.
Hermione is suddenly reminded of a time when she had been at a park with her Dad, long before her Hogwarts years. A child had run out into the nearby road and the mother had instinctively followed, pulling the child sharply back to the pavement as a car hurtled towards them brakes and tyres squealing, and onlookers screamed. Back on the pavement the mother had shouted so loudly at her shocked child, the angriest eight year old Hermione had ever seen anyone, and then pulled her into the tightest hug, sobbing.
He puts his beer down with a shaking hand. “I thought that too. When he said it at first, said that he needed to move away.” He takes a breath. He’s never said this out loud to anyone but Draco.
Then on Monday he’s going back to Shutterthwaites office and resubmitting those forms. Ring on his finger or no, he’s going to exploit the fact that it’s ‘
Harry hasn’t been here in three years, and then even before that not often. It doesn’t seem to have changed much, but he doesn’t suppose it ever will. After walking up the elegant front steps he’d been admitted swiftly by Tassy.
He shakes his head at Ron, "He must have spotted something in the surveillance data. I saw him at I guess six-ish and he said he was going to go through it all, including the new reports. I went back just before nine, as I was leaving, and he was gone. I didn't have a chance to go through the documents to see what he'd noticed. But the plans for Arcadia were on the top of the pile. There were traces of recent apparation from the nearest point to his office. By the time I got there he was down. I brought him straight here, but they just pushed him straight in, started standard curse damage protocol."
Harry is glancing through his notes, seeing if they actually make sense, when he tunes into the current question about trees and their capability to channel natural magic. He can sense what’s about to happen as the New Zealand speaker looks around the Auditorium and Hermione elbows him. He swears under his breath as he watches it unfold.
Hermione is listening, he can tell, but she’s not interrupting. She can clearly see how difficult it is for him to say all this. When Draco left Harry had refused to talk about it at all, hadn’t wanted to. Not with Hermione, not with Ron. He’s even only briefly touched on it with his Mind Healer, and maybe he should have noticed that in itself was one major problem illustrated in that omission. He usually told her everything.
Harry pushes the floating files aside, casts Finite Incantatem, making them a rough pile by the sofa. He twists in his seat and suddenly Draco has a lap full of apologetic Harry Potter.
“I just couldn’t. It was like this physical reminder of how he’d touched my life. Been entwined with it. An echo of him. He’d removed every last bit of himself, but not taken a thing from me, from our life. And it broke me, Hermione. Since he'd left I’d had sex with other men in our bed, sat at the kitchen table morning after morning with Nate. I’d rearranged the living room, because I fucking hated the way Draco had it set up. And all that was fine. But seeing that, the way he’d left every single bit of our shared life behind. If he’d even taken the Holly print, or the bloody fucking umbrella it might have been better, you know? But it was like it all just washed off him, like it had never happened for him. He just stepped away and left this husk of what had been there.”
She's suddenly very aware that she's at the end of a very long deserted corridor, no staff in sight, with Draco Malfoy. Harry is locked in the room beyond, cursed, and something isn't right at all. She snicks her wand out of her holster and into her hand.
Walking over, Draco shakes Hana’s hand and then hesitates. Hana sees it and stands, gesturing to Harry, “Oh, Draco, let me introduce you.”
” printed on it. That really swish umbrella of mine Draco point blank refused to relinquish. On the stove was an old cast iron kettle. He said tea tasted better from water boiled in it. It did too. Regulus’ old potion kit, the cauldron, flasks and beakers. One of Molly’s knitted blankets.”
“You’re sorry?” He voice is low, threatening, “You’re fucking sorry? Have you any idea how reckless, how idiotic, your behaviour was, Potter?”
"Then you're a fool! I've already explained very clearly why the protocol won't work! In fact it will make things worse. If you won't call Healer Green..."
“And it just hit me, all of a sudden. How fucking unhappy I was. Nate is great. A nice guy, sexy as hell, funny, intelligent, he cared for me, fit into my life, got on with my friends. But I realised it all just felt like a pale imitation of the real thing.”
would be taken. Time is weird. He wonders idly if it’s existence would have reassured him, back in the days when he wondered if they would even survive.
Harry is shocked. “At the Manor?” He knows, everyone knows, what Draco thinks of his former home. Even people who only know of him through press reports know that much. He never sets foot there if he can avoid it. The idea he would move back is almost impossible.
Harry responds to the question easily, as he goes on the words flow like liquid. This is his area, and although still new to the game, he knows his stuff. He’s still flattered though that Unspeakable Jones called on him, that she’s read his latest paper off her own bat. The questioner brings in further points, and Hana Jones responds to clarify the latest findings on the sites where magic naturally pools and what is known of what causes it. The discussion is vibrant, with the other witch and wizard on the panel joining in.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” She’s seen Harry apologise for endangering his own life before, been on the receiving end often enough, but she’s never seen this look on his face. She’s shouted at him herself, years ago, but she’s never heard that tone in his reply.
He can tell Hermione is turning things round in her mind. Recatergorising her experiences in light of the new information. Her voice is quiet when she finally breaks the silence.
He was thrilled he’d got the ‘tap on the shoulder’ not long after Draco left the country, and for the first time in a long time he enjoyed his job. It was possibly that which had carried him through the grief of his broken relationship, and fooled those around him of his happiness. Allowed him to fool himself.
He doesn't waste any time with hellos or explanations, and she finds she appreciates that, despite being intrigued.
“Maybe he’s not coming. He might have been called away.” He voice sounds hopeful. “Maybe I’ll get called away. Are you sure all our current projects are OK ticking along by themselves? I’m sure I could pop back, check things over.” She gives him a shove towards the doors as the organisers look at them expectantly. He grumbles, “Knowing my luck the only free seat will be right next to him.”
Her takes her hand, brushes over her wedding ring. She knows he does this for comfort, and the fact that he’s doing it now both gives her comfort and strikes a deep fear into her. He looks at her again, "There is someone more senior coming now?"
The longer and more formal written apologies had come later, by owl. To her, to Ron, to Neville, to Luna, and she can't even guess how many others. They were more carefully considered, but seemed no less truthful or remorseful for it.
"I mean. I thought I'd moved on too. And Nate and I were good. I was happy. Until I realised I wasn't."
’ is in a smallish meeting room on the first floor. Harry is sat at the far side of the room, chatting to Hana about whether some little known and supposedly Muggle cultural traditions can be used as a basis to start examining the nature of early magical agriculture, when Draco walks in.
Ron glances across at Malfoy, and she follows his gaze. He has one hand gripped tight round the pile of papers on his lap. The other is still holding the alert globe.
Harry hadn’t actually been that surprised to discover, on his first day in Mysteries, that Hermione wasn’t actually the high level Ministry lawyer she seemed to be to the outside world. Every time the discussion of Unspeakables came up in conversation with their friends from then on they both bitched about them mercilessly. “A nightmare to work with’, ‘Unspeakably Rude’, ‘No better than they ought to be’, but weirdly it never seemed to arouse suspicion.
“This isn’t actually my specialist area, although of course it is related, however I do hope that we have the person here who would be able to give you more detail.” She finally locks eyes with Harry, smiles and gestures for him to stand, nodding. “Please, Unspeakable Potter, I believe your latest paper on the role of chlorophyll in the process of the embedding of natural magic into wand wood deals with this exact point?”
“1912? Myron Malfoy would have been around that age then.” He’s not lying, not really. He hasn’t said it
Harry groans, and then slowly sits back up before he continues, "You were right. I was going to ask Nate to move in. Just before we split.”
She pulls the covers to sit better over him, and takes the glass of water away. “Well, that is what you get for tackling Dark curse wielding wizards alone. What were you thinking? It’s lucky Malfoy found you.” At that he looks around the room. “They went for coffee. Ron finally got him to leave the room, he’s been here the whole time. I think he feels responsible, but this is entirely on you Harry James Potter.” After hearing more from Ron over the hours she’s now firmly on the Unspeakable’s side. Harry had been reckless.
“We saw each other actually. At a work thing, abroad. Neither of us knew the other would be there beforehand. But he took the opportunity to tell me then, rather than write.” She strokes his hair, making a pretence that it is to push some errant lock into place. He allows them both the comfort of that fiction.
"Sixth year was around the start of the war. Malfoy and I had been dating for two years then. I had told him everything and I thought he loved me. But he at one point took me off to the bathroom and I thought that something different was going to happen. But then I noticed that he seemed slightly upset. He told me that we need to breakup. I thought that it was because he is being forced into the light side. And that me and my friends and Dumbldore can protect him. But he told me that he willingly went to the dark side. That he never loved me. He was doing it for fame. The one time I thought it was a lie was when he helped me and my friends. But he never apologized. Even after I saved him." I said feeling tears come to my eyes.
He immediately broke and said, "of course you can love you can have anything you want." And he hugged me as his mom and dad laughed.
I got close to him. "You useless rat. I thought that you were better then this." I said and kicked him inbetween the legs.
Hermione and Pansy ran up to the girl's dorm. And amazingly I was able to follow as the others fell down the stairs as it turned into a slide underneath their feet.
"Honestly I shouldn't be surprised.Ill give you a pass and also you all should hurry to your first class." Snape drawled raising an eyebrow.
I looked around and touched some kind of skeleton hand. It grabbed my wrist and I frantically pried it off.
Harry is having a conversation with his familiar. He then turned to me and said somthing in snake which I think is thank you.
"It doesn't matter." I stated abruptly, and pried her off of me. Suddenly we heard a scratching sound at the portrait of the Fat Lady. Ron sighed and got up, heading to the portrait hole. We all turned our heads so we could see what was going on.
The next day I woke up and nudged Draco. He woke up and got on top of me. I noticed his eyes have gotten bits of red and I said, "do you need blood Draco?"
We walked into the store and there are baby clothes, toys, and other essentials. "Are you sure this is a good idea?" Ron asked.
"No its not harry. I read up on them and it actually increases the happiness you have." Hermione said, smiling.
I kissed back rubbing against him. He then ripped off my shirt and pants. Then took his own off. I put his fingers in my mouth sucking and licking them. When he pulled them away he pushed them into my but slowly pulling them out then pushing them in. I moaned and pushed against them. He then pulled them out and slowly pushed himself inside me. I groaned and pushed against him. He smiled and began to slowly pull out and push in. Then he grabbed my penis and began to slowly stroke me and play with my balls. "Draco... Please. Harder. Faster." I panted.
"Which is what I am afraid of." Remus said and went back to glaring at us. Or more at Draco who is not paying attention and running his fingers through my hair.
When we finished I took us to Snape and he gave us the healing potion. Then we stormed over to Dumbledors office. I opened the door and we walked in. "Dumbledore I am so sick and tired of that bitch. Either do somthing about it or I will have my father sue this school and have you fired!" I said, getting louder till the end of my sentence.
"Yes Harry, it'll be fine, if I need you I am sure I can just ask Dumbledore for you back,"  I said and kissed his forehead.
"Something wrong with Harry? Ever since yesterday he has been acting different. I don't know if he loves me anymore." I said, almost in tears.
Draco pulled away. "Well we can't. Besides, it's not like you and your boyfriend don't snog each other in here at night." Draco said.
"How long have I been out?" I immediately asked, wanting to know what I had missed and how much time I had till I left for Hogwarts.
"Harry are you sure you are okay. If you want we can skip classes." Draco said pulling me on to his lap.
I'm sitting on the couch in my and Mason's home. Tears are running down my face as I look at the ring Mason gave me.
She got into Ron's face and yelled, "OH YES LET'S ALL THROW BOOKS AT MYRTLE BECAUSE SHE CAN'T FEEL IT! TEN POINTS IF IT GOES THROUGH HER STOMACH!!" she put her arm in Ron's stomach, "AND FIFTY IF IT GOES THROUGH HER HEAD!" And she put her arm in his head.
We got up and I gave Harry his potion, though it did not smell like it normally did. Probably just tired. We got dressed.
I paced, thinking over and over that I want to find Harry. A door appeared on the wall and I walked in. Harry is passed out naked and tied to a bed with a gag in his mouth. I looked around and found another me in the corner of the room.
"Floo. I have been having trouble sleeping, too. Sleep now, my little mate. I'm here." Draco said, running his fingers through my hair. I cuddled into him. For once this summer, falling into a peaceful sleep.
I growled at him making him pull back and I said, "I'll take Harry to the hospital wing. You all stay here," and I walked away keeping Harry close. Though Moody followed, not getting the hint.
He then began nipping and kissing my neck and jaw till he got back to my lips and began kissing me there again.
I felt tears run down my face and started to cut myself. Then I wrapped them up and went to bed. I hope Draco does not find out or see my cuts.
I looked at my hands. "I believe you. I'm sorry for not trusting you. I'm a horrible mate." I said and started crying harder.
The next day I got up and got ready for the wedding since it's wedding day. I'll be meeting Harry at the Weasley's.
"Harry. It's okay. It's over and done with. It's going to be okay." I said, rubbing his back and sitting on our bed. I started to rock him like a child and looked at the time. I saw we missed breakfast and will need to be at classes in an hour.
"Now Harry, I'm going to need to ask some questions. I know it may be hard to answer, but please try your best. I just want to know what you remeber." McGonagall said, frowning.
That night I decided to take a walk since I was unable to sleep. Mainly because Harry is still on my mind. He does not seem mad or discusted. He mostly seemed. Flustered? Embarrassed? Eather was cute.
I'm happy that we finally get to go to Hogwarts. Our dad's told us so much about it. How they met. There adventures.
"Harry!" Hermione and I yelled as Harry got hit by a branch and fell. Hermione and I went over but we got hit too. We all crawled away.
I looked at Hermione and motioned for her to go ahead and explain, "It's his name. When we say his name they come. That's why every one fears his name. That's how they did it in the past." Hermione explained.
I moved my head to the side allowing him access. He bit into my neck and began sucking out the blood. I pulled him closer enjoying the feeling.
After we ate we went to our first class which is Defense Against the Dark Arts. We sat in our normal spots and a minute later Moody came in drinking something foul smelling. Then he continued being weird. I really don't like him but Harry thinks he is good so I have to deal with it.
We heard some teachers talking about Harry and he followed them. I tried to follow but I could not get in.
We walked in and Dumbledore asked us to wait and told us we can have a licorice snap. But be careful because they are quite sharp.
"Easy for you to say. You have a soulmate and before that you were gay." Ron said sounding a little annoyed.
When we got there Ron and Blaise is already there and it's almost dark. We began walking and Hermione is singing the Hogwarts song as Harry is walking a bit away from us lost in thought.
I nodded and said, "as long as I spend time with you. Your friends. And get to meet the man you marry. And go to the wedding."
His face imeadtly turned from angery to sad and worried. "No no I do love you. What would ever make you think I don't."
"Okay. I guess. But couldn't he study with us?" I questioned laying back on the couch, my knees and down were dangling off the side and my head looking up.
We are in the library studying up on the lake after our classes. "Back to Hogwarts a History. This brings back memories." Hermione said, slamming the book down.
"Aww. Did Ron disturb you?" Harry said and picked Lucif up. "It's okay Lucif. It's okay." Harry said, petting him.
He moaned and I began thrusting in and out, causing him to moan and gasp. "Mm. Draco! Faster please !" He said and I done as he wished.
"No, get back here," I said but too late. I looked at Ron and Lockhart. Lockheart woke up and said, "Hello. Who are you? Who am I?" He said.
After that conversation, we got dressed and went to breakfast. Pansy and Hermione came over and sat with us. "So how was your boys night?" Hermione asked.
"Yes. My Mother will also send me my own. She said she could get Harry some, but I told her I'll take care of it." I answered.
"That was a dementor. They guard Azkaban but since Sirius Black escaped they are looking for him. Not sure why they attacked you." Professor Lupin said.
"I'm sorry Harry. I love you and I always will. I am sorry to make you think I don't." He said and kissed me.
Ron and Blaise got into Ron's bed closing their curtains as I laid Harry down and took off his glasses and shoes. And placed his wand on the dresser.
It was the moment I was walking past the Golden Trio's compartment. I got a whiff of the most wonderful,delectable scent, so I took a step back. I was at the door and the scent completely flooded my senses. Mate. As soon as that registered in my mind I peered in through the door and looked at each member of the trio. Hermione? Nope. Weasel? Praise Merlin no. Harry. Harry was my mate. At that moment it felt as if my brain had just shut off and I was overwhelmed with the urge to enter. But I couldn't. They were already looking at me, so I decided to take the safe route and continued my confident stride.
"Today the Goblet of Fire will tell us the three champions of the Triwizard Tournament. Don't forget, once your name is chosen you are magically bonded and there is no going back. The first champion is," The goblet roared with fire, and a piece of parchment came out of it. "From Beauxbatons: Fleur Delacour!"
Then when I walked up I thought of Voldemort but he was never that scary. Plus I defeated him three times now. Once as a baby. But then I thought of how I felt with the dementor. So then there it was in all its glory. A dementor.
Harry walked out slowly looking around. As the dragon attacked him he hid behind a rock and summoned his broom.
We walked out and went to our classes. After, Harry wanted to go for a walk alone and I let him go. Even though I didn't want to. I worked with Hermione and Ron for an hour and then Harry came back. He was okay.
"He may go to a close friend, his mind will force him to, and it will satisfy him. Then, two weeks after the child is born, he will start drinking from you, again." Madam Pomfrey said.
"Nothing. Just greeting you both on this fine morning." Then he smiled brightly and walked inside the great Hall.
He slowly came up to me. "You're leaving stuff out. Have they done anything cruel to you?" He asked.
So now I am waiting in the Gryffindor common room, studying with hermione. Harry left not to long ago and I miss him already.
"Well I couldn't help myself. Plus, Harry allowed me to." I retorted feeling slightly offset and defensive.
"Diagon alley!" He shouted and threw down the powder, green flames enveloped him and he disappeared.
"Draco said that Harry did not want to bother anyone with it. So Draco just asked his parents if Harry could live with them." Hermione answered.
Today we leave for my parents. I woke Harry up and we done last minute things so we can leave. "You ready to leave Harry?" I asked as I walked out of the bathroom.
"Don't worry Harry. Rita just likes to twist stories about people. Everything will be fine." I assured him.
Harry sighed. "Just a girl and a man. They kept asking me about Tom. Then they knocked me out saying they don't need me." I hugged him to me sensing that he is depressed.
As soon as we got to the common room I sat on a couch and cuddled my stuffed animals. Hermione and Ron sat on eather side of me.
"Don't worry Harry. Your doing great. Now follow my lead. One two three-" I said over and over now going in more of a box motion and turned in slow circles. I also saw Hermione and Pansy standing in a corner, watching. Ron and Blaise dancing to, but not as elegantly as us.
"Of course." I stated, noticing that through the glass material in the door, Malfoy was walking past our compartment. His eyes were yellow.
"Good morning professor. Could you give them three passes for the Restricted section? They want to know more on my type of werewolf since I am Harry's mate." I rushed out, grabbing Harry's hand near the end.
"Um. Somthing about keeping People out of your mind." I said, trying to think about it as much as I can.
"What have you two done for the time away from us?" Ron asked, then took a big bite out of his food.
He blushed. "I trust you. It's just I was not sure that...Um." He stoped talking and he blushed even more.
"Draco it's okay. We will find him. Just please don't yell." Hermione said, placing a hand on my shoulder.
"Draco there was nothing that you could have done. How about us four will get a dream less sleep potion and you can get Harry to be nice to you again." Pansy said and they left.
I moved over to Hermione, but a mermaid put a trident to my throat. "Only one." It said. I nodded and a shark came up, scaring all of them. I took Hermione away.
But then Ginny came down and sat next to me. "Harry you promised that you would wear a bra for me." Ginny said.
He just began rubbing against me again giving me pleasure that way until we both came. He then just layed next to me and we cuddled against each other. We heard every one else come in. Then we fell asleep.
"Im fine, just got shocked. I mean how can you get pregnant and have kids? Especially if you have male parts still." I asked.
I got up to see him emptying his stomach into the toilet. I rubbed his stomach and moved his hair to make sure it don't get in the way.
"Probably. Though I think only Hermione and Pansy will. Blaise and Ron will probably do nothing." I said, grabbing some shampoo and started washing Harry's hair.
I nodded and we finished eating and went to Hermione room because ours probably smell like sex. And we relaxed.
I glared at Harry. "Why did you not bother to tell me this before?" I said. He looked at Sirius as I started to stalk forward.
The next day I woke up in bed with Draco holding me in his arms. "Morning Harry." He mumbled against my shoulder.
"Please guys. Can't you just let me think about it? When I'm done I can tell you." I said, wanting to end the conversation.
I looked at his arm that has a bad cut in it. "And you were doing so good." I said and helped him up.
Draco blushed and I smirked. "Yes very. He is my ickle cuddly puppy." I said and my snake,who is on the table, laughed.
Ron went first opening all his presents and was happy with what he got. Especially the owl.  It was Draco's turn next. I laughed when I saw that Hermione got him a werewolf book and the whole twilight book series. He also got dog toys from the twins, Ron and Sirius. Though he seemed fine with it. Next it was Hermione. All she got was books, but was ecstatic.
"Yes sir. The good thing is that I won't be crazed, like normal bitten werewolves." Draco said smiling.
When we got to the great hall Dumbledore had the first years sorted and introduced the new teacher and told every one Snape is now the DADA teacher.
Everyone crowded around us as he opened it. When he did, however, it started screeching. I covered my ears, probably being the most affected, being a werewolf and all. Harry finally closed it.
"I don't mean to." I said tears running down my face. "The first time I was trying to protect him. Voldemort was threatening me. I just want him back. I never wanted to hurt him." I admitted.
All through the day up untell dinner Draco has been begging for me to pay attention to him. Our freinds would looked at us strange but not say a thing.
But then Draco got ontop of me and began kissing me ruffly. I kissed back the same pulling him closer.
"Yes he did. I'm sure every one is fine with that. He is my mate, so he can." I said, somewhat defensive.
Draco looked at us and we decided we can stay a Night. We each got a room with our significant other and got ready for bed. Me and Draco fell alseep wrapped in each others arms.
A black figure passed by the door and slowly opened it. There is a flying black cloak that reminded me of death. He came closer and I heard Draco growl as I felt myself grow weak and tired. I heard a woman screaming and saw a flash of green light as I passed out.
Harry eyes went wide. "I know how we can get to the ministry. We just need to ride the Threstles." Harry said.
The wolf growled at Ginny who backed away and looked at me. The wolf sat down, and a minute later Draco was sitting there, crouched down.
"All righ'. Come on in." Hagrid said and stepped back, allowing us to come in. "So wha's been happenin' with yer lot." Hagrid asked.
We ran back to our dorms. Ron went upstairs but I stayed in the common room. I want to know more about this diray.
"Harry was hurt," I said and started to try and get the rocks down again. But then the pain started to disappear. And I stopped.
I nodded as Mr. Weasley came in. I decided that he will walk me down the isle since he is like a father to me.
"I came in here after Olive Hornsby teased me about my glasses. I came here and was standing by that sink. And all I saw was a pair of yellow eyes." She said.
She has tears falling down her face and began pleading for this not to happen. The Weasley's both look mad and slightly upset. "Please don't do this. She is only a child." Mrs Weasley said.
"That's probably it. I mean he hates us, why would he do such a thing?" I said wishing it was not that "Though I think there is something different about him," I added thinking about Knockturn Alley.
"It's almost curfew go to your rooms." Hermione said, getting up, Pansy following her to the girls room.
I sighed and said, "the only thing difrent would be your sent because we would have mated. And, it won't hurt or make you walk difrent that much."
At lunch Umbitch came over. "All of you detention for walking out of class." She said and walked away.
Today is the day of the task and Harry is scared. He is scratching at his arms and pacing. "Harry it's fine. Let's go to the stadium." I said.
Me and Pansy looked at him and I said, "No, he should be fine. He's had a rough day, he should sleep."
I felt as though the water in my body had suddenly become lava and I could hardly register the sound of my screams as I fell to the cold, hard floor. My vision became blurry and I saw blobs of color coming into my line of sight, and slowly fading out into blackness.
"It's fine Draco. I'm sure Hermione is right I won't die." Harry said getting out of my grasp and doing homework.
One we found the room we went in and found the bathroom. Then saw Ginny's shampoo and placed it all in. "I can't wait until she uses this," I snickered.
My parents had left me at the loading station like every other year, saying their parting words before I left, along with the werewolf stuff that I had to know and remember. That wasn't the 'life changing part.' In fact, it almost seemed expected.
Draco took it and said, "yeah, this makes sense. Spiders flee it and it's a snake. Which will be why only you can understand it."
"Well... at the moment, I'll like a dress, but I don't know what I'll like tomorrow." I said frowning.
She went over then she came back and said, "Because he does not want to talk to a bad friend. That is what he said."
We all laughed, when the door banged open and Ginny came in with blood on her clothes and a insane smile on her face. "You'll be mine Harry!" she  said and lunged at me.
"Alright well, I will have to keep this. Just go to your room." He said nodding and looking at the map.
He then turned over again and hugged my arm. He eventually stopped moving and cursed under his breath.
After classes I met them at the library and we went to the restricted section. "So, what did you do to Harry?" Hermione whispered as we looked for werewolf books.
Harry woke up as Madam Pomfrey came in. "I can mend bones easily, but growing them back is a whole other thing." She said, handing him a potion.
When we got there we got into carriges Ron and Blaise joining us hickeys on there neck and cloths and hair a mess.
"Well she was walking and you know how I like it when they walk. But then I just asked her out." Ron said, seeming to be in a daze.
I ran quickly to the owlery and called my owl. I tied the letter and told him that I'll give him some treat. Then Headwig came over and said, "long time no speak Draco. How are you?"
I nuzzled his neck and lightly kissed him. "Don't worry Harry I'll protect you. I love you so much." I said.
"You look beautiful Harry," Draco said putting an arm around my waist and leading me to the great hall.
I smiled, happy that Draco has this all planned out. I am already thinking about what every one will wear and where it's at. Everything.
At the end of the day, we couldn't change them back. When we (me, Draco, Ron, and Hermione) got to the common room, Ginny looked at us and laughed. "Wow, Harry you have never looked gayer. And Ron. Just. Wow." She said laughing.
"Harry told you that we are wizards. Now we can tell you about all the cool adventures in Hogwarts." Hermione said as we sat down for dinner.
"Who is the one person that was with us in this house that hates the idea of me and you together?" He asked, having me rest on his lap and my head on his chest.
At breakfast Ron and Blaise came in late and yelled at me and Draco for not waking them. We just ignored them, not really caring.
"Draco, I know, but there is nothing you can do." Blaise said. And he is right. There is nothing I can do. I sighed and continued to eat and drink. Blaise doing the same.
After a few moments I yelled Mason's name and came, as Mason came into me. He pulled out and collapsed next to me.
"Draco, dear, the disappointment of a nephew. Dating, the oh so great, Harry Potter, making your mum and dad weak," Bellatrix says, then me and Blaise stupefy her. Fenrir attacked Blaise, and I tried to use a spell to help Blaise, but as soon as I got ready Fenrir ran off leaving behind a bleeding Blaise. All the deatheaters, then, left. Draco started at were Snape laid.
"I am not going to be a last resort!" She yelled and handed Snape her paper. "Plus I am already going with someone," she snapped and walked out.
She nodded and dismissed us. I dragged Harry to the room of requirement deciding to finish what we started.
I sat up and Harry looked at me lustfully. I smiled and began kissing him again as the curtains we're ripped open. "Told you I could do it." I heard Hermione say as I sat up.
Draco blushed a little."I'm going to show Harry my room. See you later." Draco said quickly. He then grabbed my wrist and dragged me to his room. "Here is my room love." He said and fell onto his bed.
"Madam Pomfrey allowed us to have the rest of the day off." Harry said, smiling and sitting into my lap.
Around midnight I carefully got out of Draco's arms and went down to the abandoned bathroom. I took out my wand and used the cutting spell a few times.
I mean how can I be calm when there are two peaple getting in my head. Snap is teaching me occlomencey. And I don't think he'd like to see me and his godson have sex.
"Well... I really want to tell you something but I am afraid of how you will react," I said, sitting on his bed.
"Yes and they are inviting you, your mom, your dad, and us. It's going to be so great." Hermione said, smiling.
I started skipping as we went to the Gryffindor common room looking for Fred and George. Ron and Blaise have already washed off the ink.
We layed here for an hour. I was about to fall asleep when Draco spoke up. "It's time for lunch. The day after tomarrow we go back to hogwarts." He said.
I then decided that I want to try to top, so I flipped us over. "What do you think your doing?" Draco said smiling.
"Yeah, but I wish she would hurry up. And how were you able to get into the girl's dorms?" Ron said.
"Actually most owners give them a place to sleep and food. The cloth that they were is just a symble to there working. I am sure that they can get a new one. They would just have to make a new one. Dobby one time did." Draco explained.
"It is alright. This, my children, is a Pensieve. I use it to look back and see what went wrong. It is quite helpful. Especially when I find my mind a bit stretched." Dumbledore explained.
"Well hello pott- aaaaaaaa." Nevill came up behind him cutting off Nagani head and Voldimort his waist line. Killing Voldimort with the sword of Griffindorks.
On the way in, the twins decided to sneak up behind us and yell "Harry's out of the closet!" and everyone clapped.
"We are going to Hagrids. I should probably go get changed though." He said, indicating his clothes.
"So the merfolk are going to take something important and put it underwater for you to find within an hour?" Pansy repeated just to make it clear.
I read them over and they are filled with nasty words. I ripped them up. "She is wrong. I love you. You are beautiful, strong, smart and every thing I can hope for in a mate." I said, hugging him and kissing his forehead.
"You don't know? Son, he has you wrapped around his little finger. He is so Slytherin I'm confused as to how he is in Gryffindor." Father said then walked out.
I got up and shot the binding curse on her. She froze and Draco got off, turning human. "How did you get away?" I asked.
The next day I woken up and we got ready. I dressed in the girls uniform and we went down to the common room and waited for our friends.
I slipped out of little space and kissed back sucking on his toung getting a groan from him. Then he pulled away. He grinned and said, "you taste good. And a great kisser."
Mason sighed and said, "it's okay. I understand if you don't want to marry me. When we started dating I knew it was not going to last. You were on the rebound. When I asked you to marry me that was because it last longer then it did. I thought you were over it. I will be okay if you want to marry Draco."
I looked at the door and saw the Malfoys - senior and junior. I hid in a wardrobe and thought: Ha, back into the closet.
"Draco has told me you are acting strange. Does this have anything to do with the Ginny incident and Prophet?" I asked.
I froze and watched unsure what to do.  What is he even doing here? "H-harry?" I said slowly stepping forward.
I went back to my compartment with Pansy, Blaise, Goyle and Crabbe. They know everything - including Potter being my soulmate.
I hugged him and he cuddled me. "I'll let you keep all the bunnies. And when we go to Hogsmead I'll give you anything you want. Just pleas don't neglecte me." He said and kissed my cheek.
We ran and looked back just as the executioner killed Buckbeak. Hermione leaned into Harry and cried. Harry stood there in shock and hugged Hermione.
The next day we woke up and did all the last minute stuff. We then went to the car and through the barrier to platform 9 3/4.
Ah. Umbitch. Just as ugly as I remember. I looked over to Harry who is staring at her in disgust. Kind of cute.
After we ate and went to our bedroom to get ready for bed Mason pushed me to a wall and said, "now where were we?"
For the rest of the day we just sat around and talked. After dinner, I checked Harry for cuts, then we took our showers. After, me and Harry fell asleep.
"He was supposed to love me. He is supposed to be mine, but he just chose to be a fag and started dating that mutt. Now Ron is dating Blaise. What's next, you and Pansy? Oh and don't forget Dean and Seamus. All the Gryffindors are practically gay. it's wrong." Ginny said to Hermione.
We all laughed at Ron and Harry said, "It takes practice. But don't worry, it's not like you are going to ever wear them," and she took back the shoes.
At lunch we told the others why we were acting strange. Hermione told me that I'm lucky I could get more. Pansy said she is going to put the rest under lock and key once we get it. Ron banned me from sharp objects for the rest of the day.
Blaise and I are back in the Leaky Cauldron just drinking. I thought back to the great times that Harry and I had. And all the times we would talk about the future. Having kids getting married where we will live. But none of that has happened. All because I was an idiot.
Then Harry shot from the water, landing at my feet, covered in scratches. I helped him up and wrapped him in my Towel. Hermione handed me another one and I gave him that to. I hugged him to me and kissed his for head.
I cuddled Harry and placed lightly kiss his forhead every once and a while. We did not talk or anything, we just enjoyed each other's presence, but then I felt the need to drink his blood. So, I laid him on his back, and got on top of him. I smiled, and he tilted his head to the side, giving me full access to his neck. I leant down bit into his neck, and began to drink his blood. He moaned and pushed his hips into mine.
"No. It feels pleasurable to mates." He said and bit into my neck. I sighed at how good it felt. He then pulled away and said, "See it's good. How do you feel?"
"Don't worry I will make sure father does not let anything bad happen to either of them," Draco said.
At lunch, Blaise was making up stuff up about what happened. "I'll go talk to him. You three can start heading to Hagrid's." Draco said and got up.
Crookshanks came over. How she got there I don't know and went to touch the roots of the trees. "Come on," Harry called and ran over taking a tunnel. And we followed behind.
"We only get in trouble if we get caught. Other then that it's breaking the rules." Harry said, smiling.
When we got to the field, Madam Hooch said her normal stuff, then we were off. I looked for the snitch, flying around the pitch. Draco is staring at me, not paying attention.
We went to the great hall and Draco kept trying to hold my hand our put an arm around my waist, but I did not let him. We then sat down and Hermione looked at us both sceptically.
I looked at Dumbledore for reassurance, but he did not look at me. Not even a quick glance. I frowned, not sure if he cares about me any more.
I shifted into my wolf and began running, leaving my friends behind. Dont worry Harry I will find you.
Harry finally walked out with a hopeful smile. "He told me something I could do to help me with my task. I would need to learn a new spell." He said.
Mason shook his head and said, "if you marry me you will never be truly happy. I know you won't. Don't marry me for me. Do it for you. Don't worry about me. I will be okay. As I said. I knew this would not last."
Blaise and Pansy came in and Blaise I noticed started flirting with Ron. I almost laughed and Harry looked at me strangely. "Blaise is flirting with Ron," I whispered.
I walked down just as he joined his friends. "Potter - getting all the attention as always. Heard you're finally out of the closet, Potter." I said.
The next day it is time to go back to school and I think Harry feels depressed even with the potion.
The next day as soon as Pansy and I got to the Great Hall we went and sat with Harry, Hermione, and Ron.
Harry cuddled up to me and kissed my cheek. This is so nice since he ignored me all day. Maybe I'll make him even more happy tonight in bed.
We then got dressed Harry feeling like a girl today, so she picked out a pink shirt some shorts with a design on the butt. She began walking hetself with a slight limp. I laughed but just held her hand and we went down to breakfast.
We said good morning and began eating. Then the owl post came. On the daily prophet, the front page has me and Draco hugging and kissing on a loop.
I glanced back at Draco who is still staring at me. He gave a small smile and then went to looking at his food and began eating.
A year later and hogwarts is all fixed up. Headmistriss Mcgonagall is allowing any one who wants to go back can. Me and Draco of course are going back. Hermione Pansy Blaise and Ron will be coming to.
Me and Draco walked our son, Scorpio James Malfoy-Potter, to the Hogwarts Express. We then saw Blaise and Ron with there adopted son, Hugo Dame Zabini-Weasley.
"Pleas only speak when you are called on. And the reson why is because to my understanding. You all have n I think had good learning since first year. So we need to go back and learn the basics. Now pleas put away your wands. We don't need those." Umbrige  answerd.
“To promote house unity, you will be made an example of.  You will be sharing a room with people from a different house, well the boys.  As only three girls came back, you will all be in one room.  The faculty know Harry and Draco are together, and through some things they can tell if they wish, will be in a room together.  Neville, you and Dean will actually be sharing as there are more of your house.  We also put Ron and Semus with Theo.  We hope you all can get passed prejudice and war.  Everyone lost something, whether 18 years ago or two, please remember that.”
“As soon as Poppy gets here, we’ll explain.  Seems we found Annaleise Dumbledore’s other parent but he’s sick.”
Draco continued.  “It’s not your fault.  It was the horcrux that made it hard for the connection, it has to be.  Please don’t beat yourself up over it.”
"No. Lucius saved Sirius, gave information to the order that even Severus didn't know. I have the memories to prove it. Severus gave them before...before he died. Narcissa saved my life in that forest just minutes ago. Draco saved us at the manor and practically gave me his wand, making it to where I could kill the son of a bitch in their house. They go free. I will fight the ministry if I have to, Kingsley."
“No.  I don’t want to and I don’t think I wanna be an Auror anymore.  I don’t know what I want and I don’t think going to school will change it.  I’m sure Hermione will though.”
“Does he know?  About your uncle, Harry.  What does he know?”  Hermione asked when the subject of the dreams came up.
“I don’t really know, Moony.  There’s things Draco needs to know, but I don’t want to tell him till I know where I really stand.  Are the Potter’s the only bearers?  And we got a new elf, Slinky.  She says I have a lot of homes.  How did I not know this?”
James nodded and the men watched as the woman flooed away.  Harry was grateful she didn’t stay to ask questions.  He also knew James knew something was wrong with him.  James patted the cushion next to him and Harry sat.  The older two stayed quiet while Harry gathered his thoughts.  It took a few moments, but Harry finally spoke.
Sirius leaned forward a bit and ran a hand through his hair.  “Hermione thinks it’s James in the room.  That Albus did something that night and that’s why you are hearing the person.  She also thinks Annaleise is your sister.”
“That is what you have always said, Narcissa.  Everything pertaining to that man; it was don’t worry Lucius, there’s nothing to worry about Lucius, and so on.  For Harry bleeding Potter and the mutts to come to my home, without me knowing, to have a meeting with my wife and my son; that’s not for worry either?”
She smiled as the boys sat with their friends.  Ginny told him how Molly was still hinting at Harry over Neville, but Augusta loved her so that was helping.  Neville blushed and told his friend that his Grandmother met them for lunch on the last Hogsmeade weekend.  Harry was happy the old lady approved of who would most likely be the next Lady Longbottom and gave his friend a hug.  Ginny looked so happy despite what Molly was still trying to do.  While Harry hadn’t heard from the woman for quite some time, he had a feeling the owls were being intercepted by either Draco or his parents.  Not that he cared, he didn’t need the added stress.
Remus looked at his husband, who was trying to gather his words.  Sirius had never been one to talk about feelings, and Remus knew him better than he did most times.  It was the wolf in him.  Moony knew his mate inside and out; it was the same with James.  Sirius ran a hand through his hair and looked at the two.  He could see the need for him to be alright with this in both sets of eyes and sighed.
Draco let his finger run around the hole of his lover and watched as the green eyes he loved roll back and Harry’s back arch off.
Both men nodded and Harry got up, walking out to the garden. Harry thought about how he felt about what he just encountered. What he was told. He was a Lupin and a Potter. If he took the glamour off, everyone would know that James Potter was a bearer, which could be more dangerous for him. Harry was tired of danger. He was also tired of attention and taking the glamour off might make him unrecognizable. So many thoughts, so many emotions. At least he knew why he felt some sort of connection with the wolf that first class in third year, why they got close before finding out he knew James and Lily. He found a bench and sat on it, looking out at the trees that surrounded him. Keeping a secret like this would be hard, well not James and Remus' secret, but his. He wanted to find a mate, wanted a life of happiness, wanted a family. He just had to find that without telling a potential partner why they couldn't sleep together. There was no way he was getting pregnant now. He was almost seventeen for crying out loud. What did he know about babies.
Draco nodded and stayed where he was as Harry got out of bed.  He watched as Harry reached the door to their bathroom and turned back.
“As for homes, you have the main manor in Surrey.  You have a cottage in a small community where the Peverell family started, and a summer home in Athens.  You also own a piece of the school due to the Gryffindor and Slytherin lines, so about a third as they had many descendants and only three in account for today through all the founders.  Anything else you wish to know, Mr. Potter?"
Lucius looked at his son, the other’s not really knowing what to do.  He walked slowly to Draco and sighed.
Three.  Harry was seeing red.  He also knew the only person he killed was Tom.  That angered him more than he realized.  He pulled Draco to him and just held him, letting him silently know that he’d never be hurt like that again.  Draco moved back onto the couch and pulled Harry to his side, turning to the adults.
Draco nodded and whispered to Harry, who nodded as well.  Both sets of parents watched as their charges went down the hall, hearing Harry tell Draco he could borrow some pajama bottoms if needed before the door shut.
“Mr. Malfoy, Harry needs his rest.  You can come back in the morning.”  Poppy stated as she approached the boys.
The men all smiled and then it got quiet.  No one really knew what to say about what Hermione thought.  They could all see her reasoning though.  Harry scooted to where Draco could wrap him in his arms, holding him close to his body.  Not that Draco minded, quite the opposite.  Remus sighed and pulled Sirius to him while they waited for the younger pupils to process everything. Sirius let himself be pulled to the other and sighed as well.  He didn’t know all that Hermione had discussed with his husband.  He thought on it, same as Harry he supposed.  The lost room though, that was different.  They had found every room in every part of the castle when they went to school so long ago.  They had even found rooms in the area the returning students were in.
The others nodded as the carriage came to a stop.  Draco, grabbing Harry’s hand, once again led his boyfriend into the great hall.  People stared at the couple as they made their way to a smaller table.  McGonagall gave the returning 10 students their own table, figuring it’d help if they had to share more space.  Promoting house unity was also a thing she insisted upon.  It was one reason Remus and Sirius were able to get Harry and Draco in the same room.  The Headmistress decided the returning students would be made an example of.  Due to this, each boy would house with a person from a different house.  She also figured Harry and Draco would rather be with someone who would eventually look past who they were to the war, almost deciding to house them together before the marauder’s suggested it.
“We don’t know yet.  He’s been under the weather, but not seriously ill or anything.  We just figured a cold or some sort.  She could have meant that though.  Given Harry’s luck.”
He watched as Molly’s face showed surprise at his words, but he couldn’t help it.  He nodded to Remus and then turned to head to his room to gather things for his shower.  He sighed as he leaned against the now closed bathroom door, hoping the ginger was gone when he was finished.  Leaning away from the door, he dropped his pants and brushed his teeth before starting the water.  After using the toilet, Harry stepped into the tub, a sigh leaving his mouth as the water woke him a bit more.  Draco was coming over today to look at notes again, but this time he was bringing something with him.  Harry didn’t know what as the owl yesterday didn’t say.  He was hoping it was a breakthrough.  All they figured out so far was that Severus was researching through the Potter DNA to see if the principles of the contraceptive could change for a male as well.
“Harry, you need to go back.  You’re going to need the NEWTS.”  The girl explained as their food arrived.
Harry nodded and kissed his way back down to his hands, taking the tip of his lover into his mouth and sucking lightly.  He continued to suck, slowly sinking more of Draco into him; the blonde taking a bit of control back.  Draco tangled his fingers into the hair of his lover and slowly thrusted into his partner’s mouth.  This they had done, this they knew.  The anticipation of what Harry wanted to try to making the sensation all the more present.
“Yes, I dated your daughter.  Yes, I love her, but I’m not in love with her.  My dad liked gingers, I like blondes.  My dad liked birds, I like blokes.  I’m not my father, I never have been.  If you can’t be alright with that, I think you should leave till you can be.”
“When your mom forbade me to have a bloke, any at all, it set off a reaction.  Apparently there is a submissive part to the gene.  I apparated right to Draco and it took a bit for me to calm down.  We’re still looking into it.”
Harry looked at the mutt, at least he felt bad.  Turning back to Remus, he shrugged.  “We decided to try the friend thing.  He wants to apologize to Hermione and Ron too.  Somehow though, even with Charlie, I don’t think Molly will like the fact I won’t be family.  Especially if Potter’s are known for finding the ‘love of their life’ at age 11.”
He awoke to a warmth.  A warmth he never felt.  A warmth that felt safe, loved, cherished.  He smiled and pulled the arm closer of the person behind him tighter, relishing in the warmth of the embrace.  He sighed, not wanting to yet open his eyes, but knowing he’d have to eventually.  Ron and Hermione could be here any moment for all he knew.  He didn’t know what time it was, and didn’t really care to know it either.  He felt lips touch the nape of his neck and smiled before turning around to look into grey eyes that slowly opened before him...Draco.  He was here, it really was him, he wasn’t dreaming!  Neither young man said anything, just taking it in that they were really with the other, the nightmare didn't wake them.
Ron nodded and started to eat the food piled on his plate.  No one said much else, letting two of them eat.  Harry was slowly sipping a tea and Draco wasn’t too far behind him on his.  They all looked up as the familiar noise of mail was flying through the air and watched as the Weasley’s new owl landed in front of Harry.  Harry sighed and picked it up, not really wanting to read whatever was on it.  The others watched as Harry silently opened the letter and his face said all they needed to know.  Oh sure, they didn’t know what was in the letter, but ever since the library, Molly Weasley has been trying to get her nose in Harry’s business.  Harry just sat the parchment down and let Draco take it.  The blond read it and was a bit upset.
Remus smiled.  “There’s James, and a bit of me.  Your father was so loyal, so kind, and knew exactly who to trust with what.  When Lily brought Severus, he was the only one to see how much he’d help.  It took Sirius longer than I to see it, but I always knew there was more to Snape then he wanted us to see.”
She looked at Sirius and shook her head.  “It can’t be possible.  He isn’t like Prongs, I would’ve known.  He also hadn’t been with anyone but Gillert, that I’m certain of.”
Everyone watched at the oath swirled around them and locked itself tight within the two men who held their hands together.  Sirius nodded and backed away.  He looked at Harry, who had watched them and nodded, smiling a bit.  Harry smiled back and looked at the two men who knew the answers to the questions he had.
“The usual, Harry.  This is starting to scare me.”  the blonde whispered, kissing the head in front of him.
They all turned to see Draco entering the room once more.  Harry was about to comment, but Draco held his hand up.
The class put their things up and filed out.  Harry nodded at Draco, silently letting him know he could go.  The blonde smiled and left with Hermione and Ron, but let them know he didn’t want to go far.  The other two nodded and they sat in the hall, pulling out their book and discussing what they read thus far.
“Yes, cub.  Don’t let her get to you today.  Harry, Gin and Neville, George, the rest...well, they know you and Ginny aren’t going to happen.  Let them handle Molly, alright?  You just have fun.”  Remus commented to his son.
He turned to me and walked to my side and licked my cheek. Every one laughed, but Hermione just rolled her eyes. "Dray! eww!" I yelled.
We danced for a bit. When the song stopped we went back and sat with Ron and May. May is talking non stop and Ron is siting there scowling at Hermione and Krum. "Are you listening Ron?" She asked.
We then began washing each other up and exchanging kisses. When we finished we decided to not get dressed and just go to bed cuddled next to each other.
Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall came in and used a spell to make him be put into a chair. They then forced a potion down his throat and he turned into Mr Crouch.
"The title says 'the Boy That Is Gay and Genderfluid.' Worst title ever." Blaise said putting it aside. "It needs to be catchier."
Harry nodded.  “I know.  That’s why I don’t want him to know about me.  How are you doing, really?  Hermione explained how wizarding society usually works, and you are pretty much doing the complete opposite.”
Draco sighed a bit and turned his body more to Harry.  “I hope it’s worth it.  Not that I didn’t try with a girl, I did.  It didn’t work, and I just gave up.  Then I found out about the contract.  To be fair, Astoria didn’t want to anymore than I did. I just don’t know if it’s worth it.  I love my family and what the name Malfoy stands for, or what it did before the Dark Lord.  I want to make a name, a good name, for it again.”
Harry left the room without a word and the other three knew.  He was going to that portrait and seeing if he could figure out how to get in it.  They hurriedly went after him and stopped next to him.  The lover’s was two boys and Hermione gasped.  They all looked at her and she just kept looking at the framed canvas.
Remus nodded and they went back to their other conversations.  Everyone ate, talked, laughed, and was just...happy.  Happy they all survived.  Arthur did let everyone know that Kingsley decided to do a big memorial service next week, wanting to let everyone have enough rest and to grieve over those they lost.  He also let it slip that the new minister would probably try to get Harry to say something.  Harry told him that there wasn’t any way he was speaking, he didn’t want to.  He didn’t defeat the bastard on his own, just finished it.
Draco walked closer to the bed and Harry pulled onto his arms, making the blonde land on him.  Draco smiled, leaning in to kiss the slightly younger man as Harry wrapped his arms around his neck.  Draco loved these moments, the ones where Harry let go.  Sometimes it was hard on him as well, but as long as he was in control, it was fine.  Harry sighed as he felt the blonde settle between his legs; he liked him there.  As Draco deepened the kiss, Harry wrapped his arms tighter around the blonde, keeping him in place.  A moan left him as Draco’s hand started to slowly run down his skin, leaving a fiery trail down his ribcage.
They let him know he could pick whichever room he wanted and so he walked down the narrow hallway. For being one of the last pureblood families in England, the cottage was smaller than Harry thought it would be. He shrugged a thought that maybe he wasn't as well off as the Malfoys, but he liked the homey feel he got from the place. He found a room that was a deep emerald color and walked in, right to the bed. He didn't even really look around and it was the first room he came to. Harry collapsed on the bed and let the day flow out of him. He felt his eyes close and deep grey invade him behind his lids as they closed for much needed sleep, not even taking off his shoes.
Harry nodded and sat down.  “It wouldn’t matter, Nev.  Hermione kicked the straight out of me while hunting horcruxes after a dream I was vocal about, anyway.”
Draco was able to eat more than Harry was while the heat was going through him and knew he needed the food.
Harry opened his eyes to see everyone looking at him.  “He knows and I let him know his daughter was alright.  I don’t think he knows how much time as passed, and I didn’t tell him who I was.  He kept saying I was gone in the dreams.”
Draco woke up to his lover drawing little designs on his skin with his fingers.  He smiled and leaned down to kiss Harry’s hair while he ran his fingers through the mane.  Harry sighed and continued tracing his fingers around the pale skin.  Neither said anything and given the fact that Harry hadn’t pleaded or jumped the man he was laying on, it seemed Harry’s heat was calmed.  Both young men stayed in the calm after the storm, just enjoying the other body they were tangled in.  Both boys had no clue what day it was, how long they had been in the room, or when they should leave it.  They had no clue what rumors were surrounding the fact they kept to their room.  They did know they weren’t quite ready to face it yet.
Pansy and Theo really didn’t know what to think watching their friend with the boy he was dating.  Seamus, and Dean weren’t that surprised.  They; however, remembered how Harry followed the blonde during their sixth year.  Draco took Harry’s hand and led him out, following their friends off the train and to a carriage.  They ended up in a carriage with Luna and Neville, the former smiling at Harry.
Harry watched as Narcissa looked at her son a moment before calling her own elf to bring the notes from her safe in her dressing room.  She then looked back at Harry.
“That sounds more than adequate.  We are stubborn men, and I think we’ll need the communication as well.  So, now that’s out of the way, we should get ready for your friends.”
“No, Harry.  I know he did something to you.  I get Ginny cheated on you with Neville, but you were straight the last we all saw you.  I don’t know what he has over you, but you don’t have to.  His family should be in Azka….”
They paused again and Harry knew they wanted him to be patient, but Harry looked down at his lap and furrowed his brow. James Potter carried him, his father was his father, but one of these men were too. It was a lot to take in. He looked back up and saw his godfather looking at him.
First and foremost, I wanna say thank you to every single one of you fabulous people!  I have been busy with work and have it a bit of writer's block in a few chapters.  I have a rough outline, but trying to figure out where I want the plot to go next while our lovely boys advance in their relationship.  It's not a good excuse, but it is one!  I am hoping to be able to spend some time in the next few days to devote to writing so I can get back on track with this one.  I do have till chapter 21 finished though!  Now that I'm done with my rant and excuse, here's chapter 19!
He nodded.  “Alright.  I will keep this.  Oath or no oath.  Also, Draco, no more coercion from me to go to a woman.”
“If anyone can hear me, tell padfoot and moony it was wormtail.  I’m in the lost room in the unused part of the school.  A house elf just told me.  Merlin, please help me.  I need to find her before Albus hurts her.”
“Mr. Potter sirs, yous gots to eat.  Wes are trying to gets you out.  The bad man is gone and Dobby’s Harry Potter defeated the snake man.  Wes are sorry its taking so long.”
Neville smiled.  “She’s with some of her friends in seventh year.  I’m to save her a seat.  She got head girl.  McGonagall asked her not to say anything and she doesn’t know who the head boy is yet.”
“Morning, cub.  How are you this morning?”  he asked, sitting the meat on the tray so it would burn while he finished.
“Hermione came to me yesterday before going to the library to meet Draco.  She asked if maybe the connection with Voldemort was why you hadn’t been having this strange connection with this person.  She also asked if we were 100 percent sure James died.  I told her yes, but she gave us a theory.”
“We agree.  We already contacted Draco’s parents and Narcissa is looking in her mother’s journals for spells that were used.  Andromeda is helping as well.  Lucius is controlling the paper already and bought them out for this purpose just Friday.  You both leave Molly to us, boys.  She won’t be a problem.”  Sirius stated.
, not even looking at the floor, so they settle into an uncomfortable silence, walking along the forest. Harry hasn’t even questioned how they’re getting to where they are going - hell, he’s never even gone to Sirius’ house since the two years straight of knowing him.
Harry finds himself grinning as he tucks the envelope back, reaching out in the dark to grab a scrap of paper to scrawl back to Sirius, a short message about how the Dursleys will think it’s Christmas come early, and a reciprocated see you soon. Suddenly his birthday has become a whole lot more interesting, especially if it means not seeing his so-called-guardians for another year, when he has to come back for the summer.
“James was always the star at it, of course, but I picked some of it up. Your dad had a book that his father gave him, about becoming an auror. Part of it, a large part, is all about disguise. We learnt that - proved ruddy useful in the war, and well…now, of course.”
“Wait - you don’t? Why? Ron and Hermione will be there, all of them will be. It’s the new headquarters,” Sirius says miserably.
This, Harry has learnt from his letters, which are typically very long with scrawled penmanship and detailing everything he has gotten up to in the last couple of weeks. Sirius, who remains permanently locked in his residence due to being a fugitive, is going house-crazy and thus spends most of his time attempting new hobbies and verbally abusing his omnipresent house elf Kreacher. The hatred between the elf and his owner is mutual, and amusing for Harry who remains himself essentially housebound with his official guardians, non-magic folk the Dursleys, who have to keep him over the summer, albeit not wanting to.
Remus looked at James and then back to their son.  “He’s in heat.  I, we, didn’t think he would go into heat yet.  You haven’t had sex with him, he hasn’t ever as far as we know.  He also doesn’t transform.  He shouldn’t have a heat.  I have one, it’s how James got pregnant the first time.  Every Halloween after a wolf is eighteen and has lost their virginity, they have a heat.  It’s how we procreate.  How packs are made.  If Harry and you haven…”
Hope you are doing alright.  Mother and I were hoping you, and your companions, would like to come for tea this week?  Just send a note with either your owl, if you have gotten one yet, or with an elf.  Hope to hear from you soon.
“Harry.  Son, look at me, please.”  he pleaded, trying to get the dark haired man to raise his head just a bit.
“It’s just, I thought I’d be more submissive.  With the gene and all.  I mean, in the Muggle world, submission is different than that.  If I understand it correctly anyway.”
Harry nodded at the explanation, knowing that the mother of the man he fell for wouldn’t tell him more than that.  Voldemort did a number on a lot of people, Draco and Lucius aren’t exceptions.  With the man being in the house and Dumbledore not dying by Draco’s wand would be punished, that Harry knew.  He also knew she was right, Draco had to tell him in his own time.  That’s if he even wanted to.
Draco nodded.  “I wasn’t all that demanding either, but Harry...we may be in the future.  I know what your talking about.  Don’t forget who lived in my house.  He was a sadistic asshole and had all kinds of things he used for sex.  Thankfully, nothing on me that one time with Aunty Bella and the other guy, but still.”
It had been a few weeks since Harry told Lavender off and she pretty much kept at it.  No one would listen to the girl anymore, but that didn’t stop her from talking.  She was slowly gaining a reputation as some crazy fangirl who thinks she knows what’s good for the savior and what’s not.  No one paid her any attention.  Harry had taken to spending his morning on the weekends in Remus and Sirius’ rooms with them, James, and Annaleise.  It was time he needed.  It let him learn about himself and what was happening.  Draco used the time to spend with Theo and Pansy since he was with the Gryffindors all summer.
Harry turned and looked at him, wanting to see the reaction.  “That we should try.  That we just let us be in the moment.  That we let instinct overplay the mind.  That we relax.  It makes sense, doesn’t it?”
He grabbed a pair of boxers on his way to the bath and then locked the door before turning on the water.  He grabbed his toothbrush and did that chore while the water heated up.  Getting into the water, Harry let out a sigh as his muscles loosened a bit from sleeping on the floor.  While he loved having Draco wrapped around him, the floor wasn’t very comfortable.  After washing off, the dark haired man turned the faucet off and then grabbed the towel.  He ran it over his face and hair so that he could grab his glasses of the counter.  He then wrapped the towel around his waist and trimmed his face.  The young man smiled when he was finished and pulled the boxers under his towel before opening the door and walked to his room.
Nothing else was said, he just lead his boyfriend out of the house.  Draco pulled him close and then they apparated to the cottage.  Harry could still apparate till the fourth month, then the baby would have limbs and organs fully developed and it wasn’t safe.  He picked Harry up, carrying him into the living room and sitting on the couch with Harry in his lap.  They heard the pops of the others, but neither cared to see who actually followed them.  Harry stayed curled in the blonde and just let the calming heartbeat help him.  He took deep breaths, knowing he wasn’t going to see Molly Weasley anymore.  He couldn’t put himself, or his child, through that kind of judgement.  It wasn’t healthy.  No one who followed, said anything.  They just went about their business.  Draco stayed still, his lips resting in Harry’s hair and kissing his head, letting him know he was there.  He knew what that good-bye meant, they all did.  Harry wasn’t going back to that house.  Harry was done.
“I WAS THINKING ABOUT MY FUTURE, AND HARRY’S.  MUM, HE KNOWS.  HE EVEN GAVE HIS BLESSING ON IT.  WHY CAN’T YOU JUST BE HAPPY FOR ME?  NEVILLE’S A GOOD MAN, MUM.”
Harry nodded.  “I don’t think I want to take off the glamour.  You and my dad went to great links to hide me, hide him really.  I don’t want to jeopardize that.  And if I meet a guy, I
Harry opened his eyes to see Remus looking at him, his eyes changing before him.  He curled into Draco, wanting to hide from the man.  He knew he wouldn’t hurt him, it was his papa, but he looked a bit scary.  Draco took Harry in his arms and Harry could feel him talk, but not what was said.
He could feel the tears and Sirius pulled him to him, Remus not moving. He didn't know if his touch would welcome his cub at the moment. He did move closer though.
He looked at the elf.  He couldn’t speak, not really his throat was dry and achy.  Why did they say Harry Potter like he wasn’t there.  He was Harry Potter.
“I haven’t gotten to tell you yet.  Today, love.”  Hermione explained, silently signaling they had ears listening.
Harry sat back, trying to wrap around the vaults and value they held.  He thought the one vault was plenty, but three just for him, let alone the three already in place for children.  He looked at Remus, who raised a brow in question.  Harry nodded, silently letting his father know he was alright and for the goblin to continue.
It had been a few days since finding James Potter behind the lovers portrait and Harry was just waiting for something to fall.  He never had a normal life, this he was used to.  Being with Draco was starting to spread rumors around the school and they both knew the prophet would be finding out soon enough.  They were actually surprised no one leaked out anything yet.  Seamus and Dean were a bit hesitant with their friend, but given that Dean was at the manor for however long before Harry, Ron, and Hermione got him out; they understood.  It was when the savior was alone, like now.  Draco was in Runes with Hermione and so Harry had a free period.  He still didn’t know what he wanted to do once school was finished, but was happy he came back.  It started out just wanting to be with those he cared and loved about most.  Now though, he was accomplishing something he never thought he could.  Harry never planned on love, on future, on a family because of Voldemort.  Now though, he wasn’t going to let anyone get in his way.
Sirius just nods and makes his way to the fireplace, mumbling about the situation.  Remus knew he could blow up before this was done and over with.  Draco had some things to prove to Harry’s family, and Remus was sure he’d be able to.  While Sirius was supportive, he was more overprotective than Remus had ever dared to be.  He left the boys to it and followed his mate, turning for the kitchen for breakfast.
Harry didn’t move, just turned more into the blond holding him there.  Remus turned his worried gaze to Draco, who then asked Harry to look at his Moony.  Harry nodded and looked at Remus.
“Yes.  When the Healer told Lucius and I about it, Lucius made me give it to him.  I didn’t want him to have it.  I saw what it did to Sirius and had suspicions in school about the three of them.  When Sirius let me in on just how close the three of them were and how it affected you, I wasn’t too shocked, Harry.  I am also saddened that my son had that choice taken from him.  I always regretted it, but more after I saw with my own eyes how my cousin felt while he was telling me about you and your fathers.”
Harry pulls Draco back to him and sighs.  “That works both ways.  And I get to call you my boyfriend.”
“I have to spend time with Mother, she’s getting annoying almost.”  he whispered, pulling Harry into his arms.
He then sat to eat, his stomach not letting him wait on the other two men in the house.  Hearing a tap on the window, Harry waves his wand to open it, letting the owl in.  The animal dropped a letter and the prophet down, waiting on Harry to give him a treat.  Harry gave him a piece of the ham and watched as the owl flew back out.  He sat the paper down for Remus and then picked up the letter.
“I’m not sure.  Harry hasn’t slept in four days.  Something about some dream with darkness and not finding Draco.”
They kept quiet while Harry told the tale, the most kept secret of his father and the two men downstairs.  With everything they have been through to this point, Harry knew they wouldn’t say anything.  He also knew, he was going to need help.  After he was finished, they sat in silence again.  He could tell Hermione was a bit worried, which probably meant she had heard of this before.  Ron was ecstatic, which was odd.  Harry lifted an eyebrow, silently asking why that was and Ron spoke.
He grabbed a pair of jeans, slipped them on, and then pulled a white tee over his head.  Getting on the ground of his closet, “there you are”  he whispered as he grabbed his trainers, putting them on his feet.  As he walked into the living room to leave with the two marauders, he heard Sirius mumbling about having to see Mrs. Weasley.  Harry couldn’t blame him as he was just as worried about the visit.  Molly will once again ask about Harry and tell him it’s his duty to continue the line.
“Moony...what if it's the room we found seventh year?  No listen, we found the part the kids are using that year and us three always went there for “Moony time” with James.  We always called it the lost room so no one knew, especially Peter.  Hell, I don’t even think we told Lily about it.”
He could see the tears trying not to fall and moved to where they were sitting and he pulled Harry into his lap.
The Stag never liked staying in the infirmary, couldn’t sleep.  However, the need to make sure Harry was alright outweighed that last night.  Harry hugged all his fathers and then everyone said goodbye to the nurse and headed back to their rooms.  Harry and Draco just held hands and walked silently back to the eighth year tower.  When they got back, it seemed most everyone was still eating.  Ginny and Neville were on the couch though, just snuggling together.
“Well, we won’t keep you boys any longer.  Have a good day.”  Remus stated, knowing James wanted a shower and probably a real bed.
She smiled and nodded, turning without saying anything else.  Harry turned to see Hermione and Ron, silently asking for details, and Draco just smiling at him.
They had a talk with Slinky yesterday about letting them cook their own meals unless they asked her specifically to.  He, for one, knew it calmed Harry down to do the muggle chore himself.  Not that Remus could blame him.  They were due at the Malfoy’s today for tea around two and Sirius was still in mind to let that family know about James and Remus’ connection to Harry being conceived.  Not that they didn’t know of James, of course, just not the truths behind it.  Sirius really thought that letting the Malfoy’s know would help his godson and Narcissa’s son.  Not that Remus didn’t, he just wanted Harry to make the decision on his own.  So much had been placed on Harry, chosen for him, and Remus wanted Harry to be able to have this one thing.  Walking into the kitchen, he sat to work on breakfast, making a big English breakfast for Harry and his mate.
Draco leaned in and kissed Harry’s forehead before getting up.  Harry stretched and followed, but taking his clothing to the bathroom this time.  Harry was quicker than Draco with his morning routine, so always showered first.  He made sure to be a bit quicker today since they had to catch the train.  They were going to be early so they could get a compartment before anyone had time to stop Harry, or ogle for that matter, when they got there.  Turning the shower off, Harry wrapped a towel around his waist and quickly trimmed the stubble on his face before getting dressed.  He put on a pair of denim jeans that Draco loved and a green button up.
They watched as Sirius left and then went to find their rooms. Hermione, Lavender, and Pansy found their room first and left the boys till the morning.  Harry and Draco found their room, leaving the others to find their own.  Walking in, Draco started open doors, while Harry waved his wand to put their bed together.
Harry held onto the arms that wrapped around him, trying to calm down.  That fucking dream was going to kill him.  He could hear his father and godfather talking, trying to figure it out.  It had been four days since Molly Weasley triggered the submission part of the bearer defect.  Four days since he and Draco had been able to see each other due to Draco learning the company he was to run.  Four days since Harry Potter had gotten any sleep at all.
Harry started to fill his plate, realizing he was hungry.  Something about the little girl that held a common name with someone he used to look up to was nagging at him.  Something about her was off.  The other returning students were also discussing her.  Dumbledore had kept her a secret as none of the purebloods had known he was a father, let alone that she was old enough for school.  Harry also knew Draco was taking it hard given their sixth year.
Harry just moaned, knowing an answer wasn’t needed.  They hadn’t explored enough for the submission part of him to come into effect intimately and they were both alright with that.
Harry chuckled as Remus just sighed and shook his head.  Remus knew Sirius would do it, and that it wouldn’t take much either.  One by one, the three men walked through the flames and into the house Harry once thought of as a second home.  Red hair surrounded him as he felt someone pull him in a hug.  He smiled and wrapped his arms around the girl and smiled in greeting to her other half.  Neville smiled back and reached out to touch Harry’s shoulder.
“Harry and I are going to the village for lunch.  You are all welcome to join us.  Y’know, get out of the house for a bit.”
Draco moved, their hands moving as well, taking Harry’s boxers off.  This was new and Draco was nervous.  He was hoping Harry didn’t react like last time, he’d hate himself if he did.  After the shorts followed Draco’s both young men looked at each other.  Harry nodded and Draco moved his hips to where they could rub against each other, hoping since it wasn’t a hand Harry would be ok.
“Yes, Mistress Cissy.  How’s Pipper be of service?”  A cute little elf in a pink pillowcase asked, popping next to the woman of the house.
Harry felt Draco tense and then realized what he said and closed his eyes.  He turned his face into the blonde’s neck and let the other calm him.  They weren't supposed to say anything till the ministry found out.  They were also waiting till James had a bit more time to catch up to time, so to speak.
He watches the young elf nod, her ears flopping.  “Oh yes, the Potter’s have more than one house, Master Harry.”
The girl in question turned to the bed, her hands on her hips.  “What’s wrong?  Harry Potter, that red headed woman needs to learn a lesson, that’s what’s wrong.  How dare she talk to you like that, to Draco like that.”
He felt draco smile against his chest as his hand moved into the hole in front of the shorts, wrapping his hand around the man under him.
He had just finished when he heard a knock on the doorway.  He turned to see the blonde Slytherin leaning against the frame with his arms folded and his feet crossed.  He looked delicious in a pair of holy jeans and a dark purple shirt.  His hair was hanging loose of the gel he usually wore and Harry had to admit, he looked better this way.
Sirius stood and walked next to Remus.  “Hold Remus’ hand in yours.  I will recite and ignite the oath, but you will be making it to him.  He’s Harry’s father after all.”
The marauder’s just nodded and waited for the rest of the group to get there.  Minerva watched as each marauder had a hand under what she assumed was Harry’s cloak and soothing whoever was under it.  She also watched the younger men.  Harry wasn’t taking his eyes from the person under the cloak and Draco was whispering things in his ear while running his fingers through his boyfriend’s hair.  They jumped when Hermione opened the door, Ron and Pomfrey behind her.  She sat in the floor, pulling Ron with her while the older of the group had a discussion.  The students listened as Remus and Sirius explained the dreams Harry was having, his likely sister as well, to the portrait and how it opened.  The dark magic Albus used to hide him and who was under the cloak.
Harry smiled and nodded.  “Yes, just thinking, Moony.  I should get the things together.  Can we use the library today or do you need it still?”
He watched a sigh leave her and a small smile.  Two of the people in the room still didn’t know the kinship their friend had with the Dumbledore, but the little girl looked very happy the older boy was going to be fine.
They both blushed when they remembered Harry and Harry shrugged it off, letting them know he saw them kiss in the hall yesterday.  Their blush gotten redder, causing all of them to laugh a bit.  Harry let them know if they wanted it private, the middle of the Great Hall probably wasn’t the best place for it.  They heard Molly call for lunch and after promising not to say anything about everything, the trio headed out to eat.  When they got outside, Harry noticed Ginny and Neville were at the complete opposite end of the table from her mother.  Harry just shook his head and sat next to Remus.  Lunch was loud as ever, with so many to feed gathered around the table.  Plenty conversations going on at all times, but Harry was happy to be there.
There was something in the way Harry would react when boundaries started to get pushed.  It was hard to tell, but if he had to guess, his boyfriend had similar experiences he did.  This helped him a bit to know how to approach certain aspects of the relationship.  They had talked a bit about the abuse, on both sides; however, no details as neither really wanted to know them yet.  Watching Harry react around his family, and the two friends, showed Draco plenty.  He already knew a lot from watching Harry, but even with Remus and Sirius, certain encounters made the young man flinch.  It was like he was waiting for something to happen if he didn’t do certain things each day.  Draco hadn’t asked Hermione about it either, knowing the witch would just tell him to ask Harry.
Harry smiled and explained the conversations he had with his friends.  Remus was quite proud of Harry for confiding in them where he could.  Hermione probably already knew it was possible, she really was like Lily.  Bearers are in a lot of books, even in the Hogwarts library.  If that girl ever saw the word mentioned, she looked into it.  Remus told Harry that, and the younger agreed.
Molly will not be a favorite in the story, don't hate me.  In order for the way I wanna do the plot and for future hurdles with the boys, this has to be done.  I love Molly though, but pureblood society is about procreating, and status, in this fic.
Harry didn’t take control a lot, not like he seemed to be doing now.  Draco loved it.  They both knew with the gene what their parts were.  They just also knew that being in the moment, being just Harry and Draco was more important in learning how to be intimate with each other.  Harry propped himself up on one arm to get a better grip on Draco and smiled.
“That’s about it.  He’s really different, Gin.  I want you guys to meet him, and he wants to make things right.  He listens, sees past the papers.  He’s always looked past the papers.”
We opened the door. "Jeez you two are like rabbits." Draco said. They jumped apart and luckily are not completely undressed.
He did the same and we all put them back in the cage. "I think that we should leave two out for Lockheart," Draco suggested putting two on the desk.
My father and the Weasleys came over and started arguing. When my father said "It's time to go!" I said "See you at school Potter," and winked at him as I walked out.
"Ron was an idiot and asked Hermione to the dance the wrong way." I said and then Harry jabbed me in the ribs.
He unconsciously curled up to me and I put my arms around him. I hope he will he happy about this. Then I fell asleep.
I'm currently sitting at the Leaky Cauldron with my best friend Blaise. I found the Daily Profit and on the front is Harry with some boy. And apparently they are going to get married in a month. I threw it across the room. How dare he. He may be my ex but that was not entirely my fault damn it.
“This is true, Moony.  I would also back it, of course.  I can also brew so I can help.”  Sirius added.
“All returning seventh years that should’ve graduated already will be in one dorm.  This is because there’s only about 10 of you guys.  Also more boys than girls.  Hermione will be sharing with Pansy and Lavender.  The eight boys will have one person in the bedroom with them.  Your godfather and I told a small amount of this summer to Minerva, who’s agreed to let you two be roomies.  You will have to be careful when boundaries are pushed because she is planning on watching you two more than the others returning.”
“Do not tell me where his family should be.  Lucius Malfoy worked for Dumbledore, who I think had every intention of letting them rot in hell.  Severus, while Albus was dying, took the memories needed to help his godson.  I gave them to Kingsley.  They were innocent, Lavender.  Now...as for the rumors, you think I’m a puppy.  Don’t deny, I heard you.  I also know everyone in this school has heard me call Professor Lupin my papa.  Guess what...he is.  That’s all you’re getting, you lot don’t deserve any of my life’s story.  I am a puppy, Lavender; I just don’t transform on a moon because of my damned lucky streak I guess.  I have the werewolf in me and I have a mate.  Wanna guess who that is?  Anyone?  Wanna guess why he didn’t tell his crazy ass Aunt who I was?  No...it’s because he’s my mate.  Due to the war we haven’t marked each other all the way, but we don’t have to, to know it. Remus knew about his mates, that’s right two of them, since he was eleven.  Said he always knew there was something there.  I always knew something was there and because I don’t turn into a wolf, I tend to be more submissive, like a puppy.”
Harry sat up at that, almost hitting Draco.  He turned and silently said sorry.  Remus then looked at his son and moved forward a bid.  “Harry I need you to concentrate.  The connection can work both ways.  You need to let him know we know and will get him out as soon as we can.  Blimpy find the elves in the kitchen and see which ones are feeding James, please.  We need to know what magic was used.”
Draco pulled Harry closer, kissing his forehead, right by the scar he was famous before, smiling as he heard the slightly smaller man sigh in contempt.  Draco knew he could use to this, even before they had to.  He knew from the few nights they fell asleep in the library while going through Severus’ notebooks.  He knew it the first time Harry kissed him, he knew it the first time he figured out he had a chance with the man in arms.  Draco rolled onto his back, taking Harry with him, sighing with the dark head laid on his chest like it was made to do it.  No talking was needed as the blonde wrapped his arm back around the other, running his thumb up and down the bicep nearest to him.  Another sigh and a push to be closer the only movement Harry made before curling his fingers and tracing lines on the torso he was laying on.
I knocked on the door and it creaked open. "Hello Draco, Potter and friends. Come in." He said stepping aside.
"Harry listen. Dumbledore does care. He, I think, is just having a hard time right now. This Harry is not good. Blood quills are horrible." I said, gabbing his hand.
He got low. "I am so sorry. I did not mean to leave him alive. I was sure that he was dead." Wormtail said.
He got up, pulling me with him. He took us over to the bedroom and pushed me onto the bed, climbing on top of me. He smiled at me then closed his eyes. "What are you doing?" I said. "I'm savoring this moment." He whispered. I waited, but he just stayed at that position for what felt like forever and actually was only 30 seconds. I poked my head up and kissed him. He opened his eyes as I layed my head back down. "Damn." He said.
"Okay good." I said getting up to get them. I took them to my room and set them in my closet and hid them so that Harry can not get to them.
I got up and walked out. I went to the Slytherin common room and sat down on a couch next to Draco. "Hey, are you alright?" He asked, putting an arm around my shoulder.
"I can't believe you. Harry and Draco turned you gay. Don't worry I will fix this." She said and walked away.
"I don't feel like doing anything today." Harry said and leaned against me. I began to feed Harry and myself.
Harry smiled. "Draco this is my God father Sirius Black. Though you seemed to know that already." Harry said.
He then got very close and said. "You shall show respect. You shall eather say sir or Mr." Snape said. He then walked away and said, "now control your emotions. Clear your mind!" Then just as he was going to yell the spell. I did.
There is a stupid werewolf. I don't want him anywhere near Harry. Actually, I don't want anyone near Harry right now.
Meanwhile Hermione was looking at me with a quizzical expression. "Draco what are you thinking about?" She inquired .
"But that takes time away from you. I need you my Harry." I said, hugging him and stopping us from walking.
"After a werewolf's first shift they become more protective of their mate if they found him or her. If they have not and they do after, they will immediately become overprotective." Hermione said.
"That actually sounds like a good idea." He said keeping me down. There is a knock at the door and Draco said. "Enter." Ron and Hermione came in.
After the ride we went to the great hall on the Carriage. We walked into the great hall and saw Ginny crying to Mcgonagall. Dumbledore came over and asked us to meet him in his office after lunch.
I was so scared all day about what Malfoy would do. I told Hermione and Ron what happened and they made sure to keep an eye out. But no one said anything. No one teased me or anything. Wich just made me more nervous.
Her smile falters for a moment and said, "don't lie. Voldimort is not back. And he did not kill Cedric."
Ginny sat next to me and clung onto my arm. "You don't like him do you?" Her voices had obvious disgust and arrogance.
It's been a while since they have been here. I have no concept of time since it's all dark. I just sat in the chair staring ahead. No point in struggling or screaming. Nothing will happen.
Then Victor and a few of his friends walked passed us and glared at me. I bared my fangs at them and they kept walking. "And make sure you stay away from them," I said.
After classes we went to the library and began doing our home work. I kept glancing at Harry, actually being able to tell now, though I am not sure what is wrong. "Draco do your work." Hermione said.
"I had smelt you. Your parents will be here to get you around twelve. You know, it's very dangerous these days to be going around on your own." Remus said, looking at Draco Seriously.
I walked up to him and Draco was looking at me worriedly. I stood in front of him. "I would like to see if you could stop the Imperius curse. If you want." Mad eye said.
"We are not making out so it's not PDA. we are just cuddling. I  mean Ron and Blaise are too." Harry pointed out. And he's right.
"I feel a little bad for teasing you. So I'm going to make it up to you." He said, straddling my waist and leaning over me.
"You have? Well, I find it good for when the mind is...Stretched. I always come here, trying to find out where I went wrong. What has your faimly used it for?" Dumbledore asked.
I then used a spell so I won't feel pain and so that Draco will not know I'm hurting myself. Then I used a spell to cut at my skin. I smiled as I done so a few times at each arm. I watched as my blood leaked through my skin and onto the counter. After a few minutes I got out the medical kit and wrapped my arms with cloth and taped it up.
After classes we went to the common room and I pulled Harry onto my lap. I helped him with most of his home work, then it is time for dinner.
Though Harry kept asking questions praticly trying to get me to do his hw. "Harry do your homework. I can't do it for you." I said pushing him his paper.
Through out the week, I had the same routine; Wake up; Throw up; Go to the Great Hall; Throw up; Eat; Go to classes; In potions, throw up; Go to Great Hall, and eat; Go to rest of classes; Go to Great Hall and force food down my throat; then, Go to bed.
We both said good morning and began eating. Harry had me hold his hand as we ate, but I did not mind.
"The enemy?! Ron this is so we can make freinds." She turned to us two. "Where have you two been? Get ready for bed now! And go to separate places now!" She said.
Hermione released the balls and we started the game. Me and Harry started circling the pich as the adults and ones not playing sat in the stands. Harry started staring at me and slowly coming to me.
We went to the shrieking shack and Hermione told us about it. Then a snowball hit us. We turned and no one is there. Then anther hit Ron right in the face. Then I was knocked over and smelled Harry. I remember his invisibility cloak and ripped it off. He is smiling like an idiot.
When I woke up the next day, Draco is still here, asleep, cuddling me to him. Not wanting to get up, I cuddled back up to Draco, enjoying his presence. But sadly, I felt him move and wake up. "Morning, my Harry," he mumbled.
We went to my parents after saying bye to Ron and Hermione. "Draco, Harry. Good to see you again." Father said.
"Well we will leave you and Draco alone. Have a nice night boys." Pansy said and they all left, bidding us goodnight.
I just can't believe they did not know I am working for Voldemort. I mean the only reason why I "almost died" and hid the diary was to cover my tracks. I wanted Harry to be beside me, but no. Then when Draco gave that damn paper to Hermione so he can help Harry I tried to kill him and the basilisk tried to kill Hermione instead.
We went to the living room just as the fire place lit up with green fire. Hermione came through. "Harry, Draco. It's so good to see you two again." She said, walking up and hugging us both.
As we walked in, everyone is talking about the writing on the wall and asking the seventh years if they know what the chamber is.
When I pulled away I licked his neck and began kissing him. Then Ron can in and said, "hey stop making out and come here for a bit."
"They're talking things out about their relationship. There going to meet us at Hagrid's so we came here to see if Draco is done mother-henning you, Harry," Pansy answered smiling good-naturedly.
