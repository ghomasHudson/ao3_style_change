“My blood can save her.” Draco said.
“I was busy.”
The American president frowned and scratched his nose. “Well, I am glad that wizards settle things in a more—civilized manner.”
“Oh, right.” Harry moved the piece back. He moved a castle forward, and Draco immediately took it with one of his pawns.
“Somewhat.” The woman wrinkled her nose dismissively. “But they’re rather clumsy with it, and the power seems to diminish the longer they hold it. Without constant infusions, they are mere Muggles again. And magic, after all, is in limited supply. We cannot simply make more.”
Draco set his jaw. “Message received.” Draco took a step back toward the door, but Harry moved around the kitchen bar, until he was facing Draco, exactly dueling distance apart. “Tell Granger for me that our deal’s off.” Draco said. “And I’ll see her in the debates.”
He’d already felt it.
His commitment to avoiding phones had lasted as long as the end of the first week. Talking to only McGonagall and Trelawney would do that to you. McGonagall spoke only of what he could be doing to prepare for N.E.W.T.s, whereas Trelawney…well, she hadn’t ever stopped making Doomsday prophecies.
Worse, it had intensified, like the sun’s rays at dawn, climbing across the Earth until they painted it golden.
"Shouldn't we call to report the outage/?"
He turned. Ariana was leaning against her portrait frame. Harry jumped. She’d never really spoken to him before, at least so directly. “Did he tell you?” he asked. “Is he going by broom? Walking out for a place to Disapparate?”
Every day, Draco thought about immobilizing Harry and drinking until he was finally sated. Every night, he had to practically chain himself to his bed so as not to slither into Harry’s.
“I just feel so
“They took it, Harry. They sucked it out of us.”
Harry muttered. “For Malfoy.”
“We have to get magic somehow,” Dijiksra said matter-of-factly.  Most witches and wizards cannot withstand the procedure. Their bodies waste away at an exponential rate, and they experience weakness, dizziness, loss of vision….We have discovered that if we re-infuse them with the magic, they recover somewhat. Though of course, that is a significant security risk.”
The love remained.
“What the—
"So basically, Anna dumped him, and he never got over it. And it ruined their friendship, and nobody would talk to him, and now, well--seems like he's taking it out on you."
“Well, you had to try, didn’t you? I always said we should have left them in the Room of Requirement.”
He wondered if he should pinch himself now; would it be too obvious? This had to be a dream.
Shoutout to @tearinmyarc for helping edit, especially since I was on Benadryl (again) when I wrote this chapter, and I uh--sleep-wrote?!?! Nonsense?!?! So thanks for catching that.
.” Draco said. “Potter wouldn’t understand. He doesn’t know what he’s missing.”
. Do you want to make out? Chastely of course—I wouldn’t want to compromise your virtue, even thought that ship has undoubtedly sailed--”
McGonagall didn’t answer, which Malfoy figured was answer enough.
loving me.”
How could he care for someone as narrow-minded as that?
Ron got to his feet, cracking his knuckles. He swayed, as though drunk, but his blue eyes were narrowed in fury. “Let’s go, cowboy.”
Even though Voldemort’s followers were imprisoned or dead, and Shacklebolt had announced a new era of resistance to the prejudices of the old regime, the ideas Voldemort had helped to perpetuate still remained in some capacity.
His first kiss had happened there, when Cho Chang had approached him under the mistletoe.
“Are you going to stop him, or are you going to help him?” Ariana asked. “Because Draco doesn’t need the Chosen One, Harry Potter. He just needs someone to hold his hand and tell him it’s going to be okay. Someone who has faced the unimaginable, and survived.”
The rest of the funeralgoers were taking a stroll through the Malfoy’s garden, admiring the albino peacocks and the general greenery, breathing in the sweet summer air.
Malfoy took that news with a surge of relief. With Potter all the way across the world, there was no chance they’d run into each other.
Draco moved closer to him, drawing his wand as he did so. He pressed it into Harry’s neck, right where his pulse throbbed. Harry didn’t flinch, only looked at him, tears rolling down his cheeks.
Why did Draco have this effect on him? It wasn't like they were friends. He wasn’t even that mean, he was just... indifferent.
he whispered, and there was a soft
Draco was silent. He wasn’t about to tell anyone he was a vampire. Perhaps if he simply agreed to McGonagall’s terms now. Perhaps if he snuck into Hogsmeade while Potter was asleep and Disapparated—
Harry jumped to his feet, shocked, “You tried to—”
Harry had managed to convince Hermione to do some snooping with him a few weeks ago, even though she’d been adamanatly against it at first.
They were teenage enemies, participants in a war bigger and darker than either imagined, spilling each other’s blood on a bathroom floor.
“Certainly,” Dijikstra said.  “Once we get the rest of the world to cooperate. Imagine what people will pay to steal magic from the ‘Chosen One.’ I know quite a few Death Eaters who are desperate to have their revenge. The process is even more painful than the Cruciatus Curse.”
"Aren't they? You graduated from U of H. Major in English. Rejected from all the major master's programs. You like to read, but you hate doing research. Your parents are divorced, and you have two siblings that you aren't really close to. Your last boyfriend was a guy in your computer science class, and you broke up because you caught him cheating."
Draco checked his watch. The sun was already starting to turn the room gray, light filtering through the window next to Potter’s bed.  Potter would be coming around any moment now…
“You wish,
“I don’t want to go a stupid party.”
“What if I didn’t use public transportation?” Draco said, ignoring this. “I could go in, come right back. Easy.”
I'm sorry for what's about to happen. But it's what needed to happen.
“Your Muggle subjects waste away. Your wizard subjects die. The magic takes up no permanent residency. What exactly is my money funding here? More death?”
“What about our things?” Harry was at his side now, his fingers tapping on his leg. “My phone—”
. Wouldn’t you do the same, to save Weasley?”
When Draco had come to the door, Harry had been sitting at his kitchen counter, his eyes closed, trying to practice Occlumency.
Draco moved his hand up and down, quicker and quicker, until Harry came with a shout, his cum splashing onto Draco’s chest and stomach in a sticky mess.
she said. “
“Then test me! Test me right here, because I’m not going anywhere! Who
For a moment, Draco seemed about to succumb to the attraction that crackled between them. He tilted his head forward, and Harry felt his breath ghost over his lips. “You’re
lips bright pink and so well-bitten that they nearly swelled.
But when Draco was finally bundled into the Portkey home, along with Shacklebolt and his retinue, after nearly a day of Potter wrangling the opposing countries into a cohesive unit and acting as though Draco were a piece of furniture, it occurred to him that maybe Potter didn’t
Except—
Suddenly, Harry heard a crash, as though a door had slammed. It came from the right side of the alleyway, where it branched into another. Harry crept forward, kicking himself for not grabbing the Invisibility Cloak.
Finally, Ron kicked the cowboy in the knee, and he relaxed his grip just long enough for Ron to break free. He took the scepter and pressed it into the cowboy’s forehead. The man screamed in pain, but Ron only smiled and pushed it harder.
Draco sat bold upright, his heart racing, chest heaving, as a feeling of emptiness slowly spread inside him.
“Fascinating,” Ron said, and Harry heard the click of a camera. “But the pictures don’t move—look!”
"Helped you what? You trying to tell me your dick doesn't work?'
"First question." Harry moved one of his castles and took out one of Draco's bishops. "What happened between you and Anna?"
Draco grinned wolfishly. He sprinkled a couple of blonde hairs into her tea.
It was what his mother would have wanted.
"Wait--" Harry frowned at a Lord of the Rings chess set, whose box seemed to be jutting out from the wall-- "No way.'
Draco was not a Malfoy any longer.
Harry couldn’t believe it. She was
Blocked again. , Predictable as always.” Draco dodged a Body Bind Curse. “Just listen to me.”
and that same chest-heaving feeling that magnified all of it, casting the moment into sparkling technicolor.
“You mean your bushy haired partner? We took care of that.’ The woman’s eyes narrowed dangerously.
need us alive.” Harry fought to lock his grief and shock at Hermione passing in a box, far deep inside him. He had to keep it together. He had to save Ron, at least.  What for?”
But perhaps it would be prudent to find another drink first. Draco went back into the foyer, preparing to re-enter the ballroom and make a beeline for the bar. His vampire liver seemed to have an abominable alcohol tolerance—three cognacs in, and he was barely buzzed.
idea where Potter is, or am I just going to search every casino in Vegas?”
Harry said nothing. He thought that saying
Potter jerked awake, and in an instant, their first spells had collided off each other.
Inevitable.
McGonagall’s office, the Headmistress’s Office, always left Harry with a pang of repressed memory. The late nights ensconced here with Dumbledore, sifting through clues for the Horcruxes. The night Voldemort had returned, and he’d told the details of the encounter to Dumbledore in excruciating detail…the attack on Mr. Weasley that Harry had thought was his doing, only to learn later that Voldemort had seen it as an opportunity to manipulate him…when he’d thrown all the instruments across the room after Sirius’ death, doing whatever he could to quiet the roaring inside of him…
Dinner that night was a lousy affair.
This was so ironic that Draco simply laughed, gesturing to where Potter was clearly attempting to eavesdrop even though he’d been Charmed. “You want to lecture
And the sinking, velvety blackness as Draco drank, until Harry’s limbs were sluiced in soft lead. Until his eyes had fluttered shut and stayed that way, and he’d sunk down and down…
The woman smiled, and Harry saw for the first time that she had slit-pupiled eyes, and a curious pattern to her skin. Her dress, which he’d thought to be make of a shimmering material resembling snakeskin, seemed to be reforming and unfurling before their very eyes, the hues changing subtly through every whirl of fabric.
“You can’t die.”
He could still feel that surge of warmth inside him, a tiny flicker of his magic.
Ariana was watching him as though she detected the turmoil going on inside. “Don’t make the mistakes my brother did, Harry. Don’t push someone you love into darkness.”
And Harry wondered if he could die from loving someone so much.
“Because I didn’t want him to die.” Harry said caustically. “It would have been too quick an end.”
“Unless you can give me a reason why you, out of anyone else, can neither carry nor imbibe a virus, you will not be able to see them.”
"I'm Harry." Harry held out his hand. “Where do you want me?”
“Here we are,” Heath shot them a suspicious glance over his shoulder. “If we’re not interrupting.”
But Aberforth never really said much. Whenever Harry asked him, he simply grunted about needing to tend to an old goat farm, or he told Harry to go somewhere else if he wanted to be a therapist.
"That's not even true!" Harry protested. "He was in my physics class. Freshman year."
“What’s up?” Harry asked Neville as he walked in and took the seat Malfoy had just vacated.
“No, we don’t. Go away.”
Harry had hoped to at least get some rest before it came to this. He didn’t know if he had the strength…
“Who’s there?” Someone called shakily. Harry frowned. That voice sounded so familiar.
Hermione bent her head to her book again, her brow furrowed, and Draco settled back against the headrest.
“Do you want them to survive?”
Harry left, his mind racing.
Draco blinked.
“Huh?”
“You’re obsessed with Malfoy,” she accused. “You need to let it go. The war’s over. Voldemort isn’t coming back.”
“What does the famous Harry Potter want with us?” the witch who interrogated him had long black hair and a sardonic expression. She put her booted feet on the table and waved her wand as she talked, which emanated bright green sparks .
“What are you talking about? What do you mean?”
He still liked to come to the Owlery, even though he found himself looking for Hedwig without realizing it. He hadn’t gotten a new owl; to do so at this point seemed like an insult, when Hedwig had died defending him. She had been his only friend at the Dursleys.
“Because Ron and Harry haven’t contacted me in
Draco stepped out of the lift and wandered down the hallway, barely paying attention to the few wizards who greeted him as he passed.
He only heard those same words, resonating in his ears, promising more than he could have ever hoped to imagine, more than he deserved, forever…
Draco looked down. “I can live with any human blood. But if I’m—attracted to them. It’s…”
“Since we’re in one of the most security-heavy, aggressively American places in the world,” Hermione said. “I’d really prefer you keep your voice down.”
Hermione’s disapproving expression looked curious on the waiter’s face, but it still had the same power. “Are you ready, or do you need to look in the mirror one more time?”
“Fine.” Draco ran a hand through his hair. “Then I have another question.”
"But why take it out on me? Why isn’t he mad at Anna?”
"I have a bike, so I should be good." Harry said. "You can--stay with me if you need to."
But when Draco looked into Harry’s eyes, and Harry’s hand grasped at his, locking that velvet box between them, which held nothing more than a simple set of silver rings, engraved with the words that Harry had whispered to Draco the night of his mother’s death, the words that meant more than
Harry raised the wand higher, double-checking the nooks and the crannies around the bar, wondering if Malfoy lurked beneath a Disillusionment Charm, waiting to attack.
Draco Malfoy had to hold all the cards. “She didn’t take you back after the battle, did she?”
“You fought off
whilst you were quarantined. You will cut a respectable figure for yourself and for our family. You will accept the condolences that no doubt the entirety of the gathering will offer you. And you will help me dedicate the class gift to medical research.”
“You’re a little outside your jurisdiction.” That came from the man dressed as a real-life cowboy next to her. He even had a piece of grass between his teeth. “What Americans do is none of your business.”
“Harry,” Draco hissed between his teeth, blood still staining his mouth. “Fucking—”
“Dunno,” Harry had said with a growing sense of horror. “Maybe I am.”
“Narcissist.” Draco murmured softly, just to see the color deepen. “Not everyone is in love with you.”
“What color dress robes are you buying?” Ron asked. “Mum says we should stick to Hogwarts colors, but it’s time for something a little less drab, I reckon.”
“Oh, great,” Draco said sarcastically, trying to cover up his unease. “You’ve become a human Deluminator. You know, I think my considerable fortune could be better spent elsewhere, and I’m sure my father would—”
The cowboy rolled his eyes.
Ariana didn’t say another word, but her eyes shone with understanding. The portrait swung open.
And now—
So I THOUGHT that I would only be writing one more chapter, but then I was like, 'I gotta talk about Draco on a plane, and 'I gotta make fun of Las Vegas,' so here we are! Featuring a few original characters, Draco and Hermione hate-bonding (the best kind of friendship), and a magical necklace that links Hermione and Ron through the power of love, because they're the only straights that matter.
“Yes, Professor.”
“He also told me that they need gold. They’re in desperate need of an investor. One who quietly supports their cause from afar. One who is so well-known that he’ll be let in without question. One with large sums of money and no conscience.  I’ve already sent an owl to make the necessary introductions, and an initial payment just to get them interested.”
“Whoa, Malfoy.” Harry’s voice had that soft note in it, the one where he made everything feel like it was your fault. “Let’s talk about this. I thought you were going home for break.”
“Surely wizards have a cure for this sort of thing,” Harry had heard about the virus from Hermione, but most of the students sneered at Muggle technology, and were woefully uninformed on non-Wizarding current events. Only the Muggleborns really kept in touch, but Harry got the impression that their reiteration of Muggle News hardly earned them social points.
Draco whirled, letting his vampire attributes sharpen his features, turn his smirk into a snarl. Letting himself look as cold and threatening as possible.
But sometimes he wondered what might have gone differently that day on the Hogwarts Express, if Ron hadn’t sat in his compartment. What might have changed, had he taken Draco’s hand? Would he still have so many people to burden? Would he have been better off with the Dursleys, who’d never have done a thing for him?
“Of course not.” Hermione said. “The magic goes into the nearest neutral object, typically the tool used to siphon it in the first place. That same tool will also transfer the wizard’s magic back, given the right spell.” She raised her wand and took the rod from Ron. Then, she started muttering a chant to herself, drawing it out until it resembled a song.
“But I can.” A hint of humor entered his voice. “And you said you didn’t have to kill anyone.”
When he sat up to look over at Malfoy’s bed, he realized why.
“You could have made that more believable.” Potter was walking toward him, 2 glasses of Firewhiskey in his hand.
“Whatever it takes.” Draco agreed.
“Did not destroy the entire room, just the Room of Hidden Things,” Draco rolled his eyes. “Honestly, you think Granger’s the only one with magical knowledge?”
"You mean--we're stuck here? For the whole night?"
“Like lose at Quidditch?”
And the quarantine dragged on and on…
No one in the Order would ever trust a Malfoy, Draco’s brief friendship with Potter notwithstanding. The act had been dropped as soon as the Ministry had resumed normal duties; Shacklebolt detested propaganda, and he didn’t want a Malfoy within spitting distance of his system of government.
Draco looked at him, feeling a twinge of regret. He hadn’t meant to resort to brute force; he supposed he was still full of adrenaline from the news.   Potter would have a horrible headache when he awoke…
Harry’s eyes met his. The other’s were wide and almost completely black, and there was some dark red substance staining his lips. Harry felt a sudden urge to reach for them, run his fingers along those lips, see what they
“Well,” the witch twirled her wand over in her fingers. “If you were dead, for instance, what might happen to your magic?”
Harry drew his wand. “You think you can take me, Malfoy?” The corner of his mouth curled into a cocky smirk, and Draco wanted to bite the dimple that appeared on his cheek.
Draco sighed and took another swig of the bottle. His expression had turned distant; his eyes seemed far away, like he was almost talking to someone else entirely.
out together.”
“How many, Draco?” he asked softly.
He turned back to Ron’s chess game. “Come on. Let’s play.”
“Oh Merlin, not this again,” said Harry.
Would Fred still be alive?
Harry didn’t want anyone to die for him.
“Like I’d tell you.”
He looked up. The daggers had disappeared into ashes, collecting in piles at his feet. He probed them with his finger—there was the same sense of power—the same spark. It seemed to jump into his skin, and for a moment, Harry felt a surge of strength.
“I won’t.”
“But then—why didn’t you break us out? Why didn’t you wake me?”
"No, I mean--I guess it--"
Harry didn’t know anything about vampire venom. He hadn’t bothered to learn; he had basically slept through Defense Against the Dark Arts this year. It wasn’t like anyone was going to fail the person who’d killed the Dark Lord.
“I know more than you.”
Draco pulled Harry through the door and shut it behind him, then pressed Harry against it. Harry felt him reach behind him and latch the door, and he shivered.
His thoughts had wandered back to that night again, in spite of all his attempts to forget it.
Draco kept snarling, his fangs gleaming, blood staining his chin. “Get away from me, Harry,” The closer Harry got, the more Draco shook. The more broken he sounded. “Get awaay. I don’t
Harry watched another rivulet of sweat trickle down Draco’s neck. “What if I wanted you to?”
He couldn’t look at her picture without feeling a rollercoaster of emotions: hatred and longing, love and frustration. He couldn’t look at her without thinking of her brother, who had pulled the strings of Harry’s life since he was born, who was always standing behind the curtain, whose desire to destroy death had caused the demise of his sister…
“Then take off that ridiculous Charm and follow me.” The man let out a sigh and disappeared back behind the wall.
"My phone's dead." Draco said.
Of course Potter had to follow him. He’d been too crazed with hunger to bother hiding where he was going, and Potter always had that obnoxious affinity for sheer dumb luck.
“You’ll have to get in line.”  Draco said, unable to keep the contempt from his voice. Hermione backed up slightly, sensing his change in tone, so that she was a fair distance from Bolton and Dijikstra. Her beard had nearly disappeared, and she seemed to be shrinking, the hair on her scalp expanding. Her hand drifted, ever so casually, to her pocket.
"Shit," Harry muttered, clutching his knee.
“’Took care’ of her?’” Ron had turned pale beneath his freckles, and his fingers caught Harry’s in a vise. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Maybe.”
They were trapped.
Harry thought,
“Definitely,” Draco said. “Damn Weasley, I didn’t know you had it in you.”
"No." Draco looked up from his phone, and his eyes met Harry's. "Sorry," He said. "It's just--my phone is about to die, which is kind of like an EKG and ventilator rolled into one for me, so I'm a little--"
It scared him that he’d liked it that much.
Malfoy had tried to run,  but Sanguini was so fast.
“Oh, nonsense.” Slughorn fussed at Draco’s collar, buttoning him back into respectability. “Never a night of my youth when I didn’t engage in a little debauchery, m’boy! But you come from good stock, you’ll do excellently under a little pressure.” He was steering Draco toward a set of stairs, which Draco knew opened up onto the stage that hung over the dance floor. “Potter is up there already—do us proud!”
Once again, shout out to @tearinmyarc for editing
Take-off had been a nightmare. When the plane had started to race down the runway, Draco had been horrified to see the nonchalant, even bored expressions of the Muggles around him. Only the children seemed to be paying attention; several of them gave ‘whoops’ of excitement and gasps of delight as the plane finally took to the air.
If it was the only good thing that Draco could do in his worthless, meandering existence, it was enough.
Harry’s hand went up to the tiny scars on his neck, the puncture wounds that, luckily had escaped the notice of any of his friends.
Things to listen to during this chapter:
McGonagall flicked her wand and froze him where he was. “Test him.” She called, and Longbottom sauntered back in, looking smug.
Assured now of his invisibility, Harry crept further toward the noise.
“It’s a good idea to have access to food from the Hog’s Head.” Harry said after a few moments. “Aberforth can—”
“Which means you are subject to the same laws as everybody else. It is about time you learned to abide by them.”
“You aren’t taking me seriously,” Trelawney sniffed, tossing back her hair. “It is an affront, Harry, though not an unusual one. We Seers have always been ignored, always mocked and ridiculed. It is, alas, our Fate.”
Harry reeled above him, his eyes wide and open, and Draco didn’t know whether it was vampirism or lust that made him grab Harry by the neck and pull his neck to his teeth, sink them in and bite and suck and lick, until Harry was whimpering above him, until Harry’s other hand was down his own pants, his breathing faster and harsher until he came with a groan.
He sounded so…delicious.
Blaise leaned in. "Anna."
They met eyes for a second, and Draco thought suddenly of the fantasy which had emerged so suddenly in his head—his fangs in Harry’s neck, the sweet blood running down, the way Potter would
“Why? Is she tired of having a coward for a son?” Harry rose to his feet, clenching his fists at his sides. “Does she want to trade you for a son who doesn’t run away at the first sign of a fight?”
“Vampires are attuned to people they’ve bonded with.” Hermione was speaking rapidly, like she was reciting a phrase from a textbook. “They can find their target even over great distances, often through barriers that would otherwise baffle wizards and Muggles alike. The bond created when a vampire drinks repeatedly from the same individual, particularly when that bond is accompanied by orgasm, is thought to be—”
She batted her eyelashes. “I’m sure anyone would be honored to get a visit from the great Harry—"
starving.”
"Draco?"
Harry half-laughed. “I didn’t really.”
Finally, in some desperate attempt to regain control of the volatile tension permeating the room, Harry said, "I propose a drinking game."
“Can’t we just Apparate the rest of the way?”
He’d been ready to pounce, but Draco’s presence complicated things. What was he doing here? Who was the man with him? An accomplice? A
going on in Draco’s body, the way every nerve ending caught alight as Harry clenched around Draco’s fingers, the soft groans Harry let out that made Draco want to die, the way they fit together when Harry finally rode him.
"What?' Draco got up and wandered over to him. "I'm not playing chess with you, if that's what you're  thinking."
But Draco had Harry in his teeth now; he could tell by the way his green eyes flashed, the way his hands were clenched into fists. Draco couldn’t let go. “She couldn’t forgive you, could she? For dumping her after Dumbledore died, leaving her in the dark for an entire year? You decided to be noble and cut her loose, but you didn’t think about how she’d feel. You imploded, and didn’t consider that she’d be hit with the shrapnel—”
Ron clambered to his feet and began to feel the walls around his cell, but Harry could tell by the heaviness in his steps that he found it difficult, too.
That was not the case, unfortunately.
Of course, this only made Potter watch him with even more interest. Draco could practically see the cogs in his head turning. He took a long swallow of pumpkin juice.  It tasted like sawdust, like every other human food always had, but it was better than skipping the meals.
After a couple weeks, Harry finally got the courage to ask one of the other managers, Blaise, about it.
"No." Draco said shortly, but a moment later, the volume was turned up on the tv.
“Ah, the Boltons.” Draco nodded obsequiously. “My father spoke very highly of you.”
Draco glared at Harry’s hand. "Hands carry bacteria. Make sure you wash yours. Your fingernails are filthy."
"So," Draco said. "Do you like working here?'
of magic in their veins.”
“And I’m rescuing Potter.” Draco retorted. “We all have our shortcomings.”
“I thought you were dead.” Draco said, an edge in his voice, the hurt starting to shine through, like blood seeping through a cloth. “That’s what it felt like. You were just—gone. Is that what you wanted?”
“I will have a Healer come and test you tomorrow, Mr. Potter. You’ll have to stay a few days to ensure no contamination, of course, but should you test negative--”
“That,” she said. “Is part of our inscrutable evil plan. I’m sure you’ll figure it out eventually.”
It would be so lonely without them. He wasn’t sure he could handle all that silence.
But he was getting hungry. They still had nearly ten hours to go. What was he supposed to do—take out a flight attendant as he walked back from the bathroom? It wasn’t like there was any privacy on these things.
Draco put his head in his hands. "I fucking hate this place."
Draco frowned, though his heart leapt. “So what is to keep you from taking power from me? Or my cousin?”
Finally, Harry had followed Draco into the kitchen to ‘check on the food.’
Truthfully, Draco had been glad to go to Hogwarts for the spring semester. He hated being in the house when they were like that. It was as though he were intruding on the living dead.
jealous. Isn’t she with Thomas again?”
“And I take it all of his magic is gone?” Draco asked.
His mother—his family—was what mattered. Potter was—nothing.
He wondered if Draco was dancing on the balcony, his tongue shoved down the throat of some poor girl, one he’d probably told all manner of sweet things, running her hands through that bright blonde hair, feeling his lips pressed against her neck—
Also, I'm pretty sure now that there will be 10 chapters. It's a whole-ass novella.
open. Harry had only been able to get there because he lived half a mile away, and it was still a half-mile of biting wind and numb fingers and riding his bike as carefully as he could over all the ice.
there. That ought to work.”
“You said you’d help me, but you’re just watching me die!”
And as the mug of hot chocolate that Harry had so meticulously crafted for Draco cooled in front of him, Harry started to wonder again whether death from exposure would be preferable to being snowed in with Draco Malfoy. They had been sitting at the same table in  silence, listening to the indie music playlist repeat itself, and Harry felt like he might spontaneously combust from the awkwardness.
Harry thought.
It never tasted the way Harry had tasted.
“Get the fuck out of here, Potter! I never want to see you again. I’ll kill you. I swear to God, I’ll kill you—”
“They won’t be pleased if we show up uninvited. There were some er—jurisdictional lines that we
Potter slumped forward, unconscious.
Draco downed his cognac in a few quick swallows, relishing the burn it brought to his eyes and throat. He hadn’t seen Potter yet this evening; he’d heard the clamor, of course, when he had entered, but he’d snuck up a side corridor into the upstairs wing of the grand country house, towards the sound of Parkinson’s mocking laughter and Zabini’s smooth drawl.
But—he stopped for a moment as he clasped the silver and emerald brooch, fashioned in the shape of a serpent, that was supposed to fasten the clasp of his traveling cloak.
“I’ve spoken to her Healers,” Hermione interrupted. “She has only hours left. Is this how you want to spend that time, Draco? Out here, trying to go against her wishes? Or with her, to say—”
Harry had nearly risen from his seat, but Hermione had an iron grip on his elbow. “Sit. Down.” She hissed. “Read,” she thrusted
Hermione did not look motivated by this information. “Can’t you feel anything? Do you know if he’s alright? Where are they?”
He knew what he would find through the doorway.
“No, Professor.”
Better that they were enemies again, and always would be.
“I didn’t want it anymore.”
Draco didn’t need more than that. Harry tried to reach for him, to hold onto him, but he was too fast. “Stop!” Harry shouted helplessly, as Draco raced toward the house.
I hope you're having as much fun as I am! I'm working on the last chapter now (hopefully it will actually be the last one. lol). It's gonna be a great time.
“What d’you—”
The photos were taken, and Draco retreated back down the steps. Now that the main portion of the evening was done, he could politely retire for the evening.
“Harry told me.”
And when the quarantine had ended, he’d managed to wrangle an invitation to Narcissa’s funeral service.
“Mr. Malfoy is a very vulnerable person. A lot like you, in fact.”
"That's not what I was trying to do."
But Harry was already running, the phone tossed onto the grass that lined the pathway. He felt the gates turn to smoke as he passed through them; it was like standing too close to a campfire, a burst of heat, the smoke stinging his eyes, and then he was through, the mansion less than a hundred yards away, tracking Draco’s gleaming had as he disappeared over the threshold.
Draco yawned. “I don’t see why.”
“Your blood won’t save her,” Harry kept his eyes on Draco. “Please. Listen.”
Hermione took his arm. “Do you love him?”
“Sure. Let me just step into my office. Oh wait—”
That night, they pulled the book and pored over it together.
“Can I get you anything?”
What was he supposed to do now? He could hardly tell Potter what he’d been trying to do in the Room of Requirement. And he was so…
about the virus.  Father—I can save her.”
He followed the trail to the door and outside, looking warily up and down the streets. They were deserted, and their cobblestones left no similar trace of Malfoy’s passing. A bite of wind blew, and he shivered. It was spring, but the nights still got cold.
Malfoy thought.
But if he didn’t tell Ron soon, Ron would never forgive him, either.
of their spells worked. They even let me take one of their wands and try, but—”
The cowboy looked at him, his brow furrowed. “You’re supposed to be one of the greatest wizards who ever lived. What will happen, I wonder, when that’s all gone?”
“OI. WE’RE ABOUT TO DIE.” Draco finally shouted, and they broke apart.
“I have some studying to catch up on,” Harry said, which made Hermione pull a skeptical face. “Really! I’m so behind!”
“It figures I would be stuck in Hogwarts with
“I was hungry—and you helped me out.” He said. “We fucked, Potter. Do you want a fucking greeting card?”
Hermione tapped her fingers on the table. “They’re obviously going to have some defenses. Maybe if we did something like when we snuck into the Ministry—”
“But here I am, living in the same room as you, human blood bag and all.”
Hemingway." Harry handed the bottle back to Draco, who took a sip.
“There’s nothing to admit!” Draco shouted, his fangs lengthening. “Nothing’s changed! I
That, of course, got her attention. The chance of there being a book Hermione Granger hadn’t read or wasn’t familiar with was slim, but the mere thought of being bested was enough. Hermione never backed down from a challenge.
He couldn’t finish his sentence. Draco had already pulled him out of the kitchen, raced with him up the stairs of the house until they reached a bedroom with white sheets and dark, crimson hangings across the windows.
Draco looked away. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. We’ve always been enemies. Until—”
"What?'
It was right when Harry had finished counting the bills, and Draco had already clocked out, that both their phones started going off.
“Told you Dean was right,” he crowed.
The Room of Requirement had transformed into a sizeable dormitory, with Harry’s suggestions. Malfoy had simply stood to the side and looked sullen, but Harry could tell he was at least somewhat grateful.
“Let me take care of you,” Harry said. “Whatever you need—”
“How did your lot win the war of American Independence?” Draco asked the waiter, who was stunningly attractive, with bright blonde hair and tattoos.  “How did we lose to
Draco shook his head. He’d been hoping these sort of thoughts would go away with time, after what he’d done, but they’d only intensified.
C’mon—
“But the passage,” Draco said aloud. “How would I phrase that?”
“What?” Lucius whirled, for the voice had seemed to be coming from the opposite direction, one of the trees that lined the path toward the manor.
Malfoy never cared about anyone but himself.
“Unless they are changed into a vampire.” Draco retorted.
“You always have to use that damned spell,” Draco said.  For a moment, his fingers lingered along the skin of Harry’s wrist, and Harry suddenly felt a surge of emotion, crackling between them. For a moment, snapshots raced through Harry’s mind.. All the fights. The kisses. Those desperate moments in the Room of Requirement. The  bedroom at Narcissa’s funeral.
"And now?" Harry said softly, his eyes never leaving Draco's, something in his chest begging him to go on.
After a moment, Draco began dressing. His father was right: he
Draco felt Hermione tense beside him, the small gasps of horror she made at what she saw. He himself, in spite of all he’d seen and done under Voldemort, felt a wave of nausea coming on. He grasped her hand in his own and squeezed it.
“Aw, that’s cute.” The woman tipped her head to the side. “He thinks we’re going to let him go.”
“Harry Potter, eh?” the man asked, looking him up and down. “Welcome to Quarantine.”
The emeralds that were the exact color of Harry’s eyes.
There it was again. Why couldn’t he make these thoughts go away? Was he finally going insane?
“I need you to find Harry and bring him back.”
Harry didn’t know how long they did that. Coaxed each other through orgasm after orgasm like taking drugs, hit after hit.
Draco guzzled down some more blood. “Fine. They’re in a prison. He’s--in pain. I think they’re still alive, but I could be wrong. I didn’t see Ron anywhere.”  He tried to keep his voice nonchalant, but there was definitely a twinge in his gut. Harry was in terrible danger, and he was hurting.
Harry wondered. He thought of the choked way Draco had responded to his prodding about the tower, the defeat that had sunk into him, the way he’d hung his head, like he couldn’t bother to be mean anymore.
“Draco, I’m sure that—”
“Yes, Professor.”
Draco’s teeth sank in effortlessly, applying the barest amount of force to puncture Potter’s skin, and immediately the blood started to flow from Harry’s veins into Draco’s mouth, down his throat.
“I would rather neither of you waste my time with dishonesty.  I have known the two of you far too long to not know a duel when I see one. My office.
He gripped the knocker and banged it solidly on the door a few times. Then, he shoved his hands into his pocket, one hand gripping his wand tightly.
Lucius Malfoy dashed through it, then stopped, his arms hanging uselessly at his sides.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Hermione snapped. “We’re getting
“I don’t know. But I don’t like it.”
you here.”
Dijikistra nodded. “Of course.” She raised her wand, and Hermione flinched.  There was a
The waiter shrugged, biting on his lip ring. “Maybe it you hadn’t worn bright red coats because you cared more about being ostentatious than actually winning battles, we wouldn’t have whooped your asses. And technically, you lost
"Blaise," Harry said. "we were just--"
“Don’t talk about that night,” Draco hissed, remembering with a flash the hatred etched on Snape’s face, the jeering laughter of the other Death Eaters as he’d fallen, and that sickening sense of horror that he’d really done it, more than the mark on his arm, the attacks on Bell and Weasley, this was it, he really couldn’t go back now. “Don’t talk about it—ever.”
A mission that had led to all three of them: Harry, Malfoy, and Dumbledore, at the top of a lightning-struck tower…
Granger was one of Potter’s best friends. And it was her they’d tortured that night, her that Bellatrix had sliced open, all because she was a Mudblood. Worthless. Expendable.
He couldn’t believe how much he’d liked it.
he thought.
Lucius Malfoy didn’t even blink as Draco stepped closer, his teeth ready to slash. “You are not the type of monster that scares me anymore, Draco.” He said. “I have faced far worse than you. Now, drop this act and get dressed.”
In quarantine, it was easier to hide it. He’d just reply to Hermione’s text messages, post an occasional photo of a squirrel outside his window on the SnapChat she’d made him get. Exercise. Keep to a routine.
"Why do you act like you hate me?'
No, that wasn’t right; he’d come to Hogsmeade, to find Malfoy—
“Specimens?” Draco asked, trying to sound fascinated and not apprehensive. “What do you mean?”
“Sorry-“ Harry shook his head, banishing thoughts of Draco from his mind. “What?”
"You don't think people are seriously going to come in this?'
“I’d rather be here, anyway. You know that.” Harry was sort of looking forward to his time alone. At least he’d be able to visit Dumbledore’s grave in private, without a thousand eyes watching him. He could sneak down to the kitchens and see if the house-elves would let him experiment with a few recipes (he’d gotten very into cooking these last few months; it was a side effect of a childhood spent with food scarcity)…
“Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey are working on administering immune boosters, but it looks like it won’t be enough for everyone. We’ll have to give it to the first years first.”
“No, there’s no need to derail your plans over me. Really.” Harry forced a smile against the heaviness that descended in his chest. “Just write to me, okay?”
McGonagall took a deep breath, then looked around. “Wait—is Potter awake? He shouldn’t be listening to this conversation. This is confidential information.”
Honestly, all the righteousness made Draco want to vomit. It made him want to corner Harry and just—kiss the living daylights out of him.
When Draco arrived at the Slytherin common room, he quickly whispered the password and dashed to his dormitory, flinging himself on his bed and putting his hand over his eyes.
“We—that is to say—he—was up late last night,” Draco willed himself not to glance at Potter, and betray the whole game. “
Nothing happened.
he tried to communicate, even though her eyes were fixed on what was before them, and he could see the rage building behind them.
“What are you saying?”
“You always have to have a problem with Malfoy.”
“You should be fine here within a limited population,” Neville said.
Harry was silent for a moment. “I don’t mean to be,” he said finally. “But—you’re a
Lucius was a heartbeat behind him, both of them too full of adrenaline and hope, tragedy and despair, to think of casting a spell.
“Abraxas.” Hermione snapped, glaring at him coldly. “And we aren’t concerned with pleasantries, Mr. Bolton. Show us your research. I have a degree in Healing, and I’m not easily impressed.”
“They seemed to think Harry was acting—erratically. That he was seeing enemies everywhere.”
Not everyone fancies you, Potter.” Draco sneered. “That heroic attitude is a turnoff for some of us.”
not invited.”
With a massive effort, Draco willed his fangs back into his gums.
“That was a PR stunt. Which is now over.  If you’ll excuse me, I have to get to work—”
“Perhaps not.” McGonagall said, and her voice was almost sympathetic as she continued. “But they will not have the answers you seek.”
“Can’t be passed to me! I know it! I’m safe from her.”
“There’s a Blood Replenishing agent in there. He’ll be fine.”
Hermione continued as though he had not spoken. “Las Vegas, specifically.”
Draco tried to move forward again, but nothing happened.
"Something I said?'
“No. The letter indicated that she had been ill for some time, and it has worsened.” Her eyes blinked at him behind the spectacles. “Is there something I should know, Mr. Malfoy?”
But the Sun was shining, and it was a warm day for March. The very least he could do was spend some time outdoors on his broom.
What if there was something or someone out there even more powerful and dangerous than Voldemort? What if he was about to let them in?
“I’m seventeen. What I do is my own business.” Malfoy said. Though his limbs were immobile, he could still speak. “I don’t have to explain anything to you.”
What if Harry just wanted to move on because he knew, like Draco always had, that there was no point in a love that sweeping, that all-encompassing?
Harry shrugged. Malfoy was an opportunistic weasel, and always had been. McGonagall was mad if she didn’t know that.
“Since when?”
Harry held up his hands placatingly. “If you’d just let me explain.”
Draco huffed. His eyelids were getting so heavy, and these beds really were spectacularly soft. “I wouldn’t mind killing you.” He half-mumbled. “It would give me some peace and quiet, at least.”
“And? Can they use magic?”
"I'll be
“Well,” Hermione gave a sly smile. “They didn’t ‘let’ me leave. They surrounded me as soon as I stepped outside our enchantments.”
“I was a
“If you don’t leave right now,” Draco hissed, twisting Potter’s wrist a little further, so that he let out a bark of pain. “I will kill you.”
Hermione sighed. “How are we supposed to get in there?”
“So you use Muggleborns as—” Hermione began.
Didn’t matter that the guy had volunteered. Didn’t matter that he’d seemed more attracted to Draco when he’d revealed his fangs, not less.
When he came again, it was with Draco on top of him, his fingers sunk into his asshole, probing at his spot until his vision went back.
Ariana looked at him for a moment. “Aberforth talked to me about you, too, you know. After you left.”
Wow, y'all. I really started this ready to write about some thinly veiled innuendo and shenanigans as Draco tries to navigate a Covid-19 world as a vampire. Had no idea I'd be writing a love story like this.
He looked into Harry's eyes, then at the bottle.. "Not any I want answered."
Harry thought of the snow as magic, something that only arrived every decade or so, that always marked something important. The last snowstorm had been on his thirteenth birthday, and he'd kissed his first crush, Cedric Diggory, behind the snowman they'd built together, their lips tasting of Chapstick and ice.
He stopped. At the end of the hallway, there seemed to be invisible wall of air between him and the staircase.
“You’re experimenting on Muggles. Why?”
It was too much for both of them.
"Look, Potter if you die, then it'll be my fault, and I really can't stand the guilt, okay? What the hell am I supposed to say to your poor mother? I annoyed you enough that you risked death from exposure to get away from me?"
head up to kiss him…
But Malfoy had already passed the Great Hall…
He felt feel full for a moment, before the hunger set in again. He’d looked in the mirror before he’d come down. There were already dark hollows beneath his eyes, and his skin had a sickly and bluish tinge to it.
Harry couldn’t help himself. He stepped closer to Draco, one of his hands tracing the edge of Draco’s collar. “I don’t know.” Harry whispered.
something happened between you two.”
All he knew was that if anyone from the Ministry knew exactly what he had really done, he wouldn’t even be put in a cell. He’d be put down, like a rabid animal.
He’d never be able to forgive himself.
Hermione looked around. “How did you find out all this? What did you do?”
“Are you going to do it?” Harry asked finally.
Draco had been having dreams about what he was missing. Sinking his fangs into an unsuspecting victim’s neck, feeling them shudder against him, the warm and salty gush of blood as it entered his mouth.
"It's alright." Harry said. "The people are nice."
Finally, the screaming stopped, and the cowboy went limp. At the same time, Harry felt himself unfreeze.
“What?”
Draco had stopped feeding to grind himself against Harry, the friction pulling the most delicious noises from him, making him practically keen.
Perhaps they were leaving them to rot. He hadn’t been able to bear telling Ron that they’d ‘taken care of’ Hermione, whatever that meant.
he thought furiously.
He pushed through the tourists and lounged against the bar, scanning the area coolly.
But he was interrupted by Hermione, who rushed into his arms and kissed him through the blood that still trickled from the wound in her forehead.
“Too noticeable.” Hermione bent her head over her book, effectively ending the conversation.
“What are you talking about?" Potter sure hated being left out of the game. It was almost adorable, if it wasn't so irritating. "Tell me!”
Dijikistra shook her head. “
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it quickly.
Is it
Beside Draco, Potter’s blood was rising in his face, his heart had sped up again, and Draco could see the moisture his breath had left in the air. He licked his lips.
The door slammed, and Harry slumped against the wall. He sat there like that for a while, his head hidden in the crook of his elbow, hoping they’d think he’d gone to sleep, but his mind was racing.
"Now I'm just the friendzoned loser." Draco shrugged. "Who can't move on."
Granger. One that I actually won, for once. If this isn’t your invitation to a tryst, well—”
“I’ll be back for
Shout out to @tearinmyarc for being like 'what the fuck is that' and me being like 'understandable, lemme change it.'
Harry reached out, but his fingers brushed only air.  He got a flash of impressions: Hermione’s exasperated expression, the thrill of a kill, the sweet taste of blood.
“Because I don’t know where he is.” Hermione put a hand in her hair, which was frizzing like it always did when she got too excited. “He and Ron went into the desert three days ago, and I can’t find them. I’ve tried all the usual spells, but there’s nothing to show where they went! They’ve vanished!”
Harry glanced over at Draco, then away quickly. He was sprawled out on the couch, one hand resting on his stomach, rising and falling gently as he breathed. Harry's cheeks flushed. Why did everything Draco did make Harry feel like he was an exposed nerve, sensitive to the slightest breath of the wind? Why did Draco make him feel so
“It won’t help.” said a voice.
for Malfoy beyond utter dislike?
Ocean.
Hermione seemed to be fighting an internal war. Finally, she said. “Let’s just focus. Can you tell where Potter is?”
The blood would run out in a week.
“Yeah,” Harry said on impulse, too quickly to backtrack. What if Malfoy wasn’t even inside?
Or, they both needed exercise, and Harry could only spend so much time doing press-ups alone, and they were both in training for Quidditch finals.
“That was—sort of nice.” Ron said, bewildered. “What the hell happened to you?”
“It is not just about saving your life, Malfoy. It is about saving others.”
And Draco looked, for the first time, at a loss for words.
Harry hoped that Ron would be able to throw off the Imperius Curse, like Harry had been helping him to do. Hoped that he’d have the good sense to run, to get help before these wizards hurt anybody else.
He was only conscious of a sudden stillness, an uncomfortable notion that something was out of place.
Potter breathing in his bed, the heartbeat that had sped up when McGonagall had cast
"Aren't we playing enough of a game right now?" Draco asked. He dropped his gaze back to the board. "Sounds to me like you're afraid of losing, Potter."
Hermione nodded. “Underground or above ground?”
Ron looked sheepish. “What do we do with this?” he held the rod gingerly, as though afraid it would go off.  “We’re—”
"Well. I try to turn towards the light as much as I can." Harry said, relieved to find that his voice wasn’t shaking. "There's only room for one emo kid in this cafe."
It was better that Draco had never sent an owl after that party. Better that Potter had volunteered for a mission across the world.
This was what his mother’s illness had done to him.
Lucius seemed at a loss for words. His eyes were fixed on Draco’s fangs. His fingers twitched, reaching for the inside of his jacket—”
An image rushed to him, unbidden. He’d pressed Potter against the wall, the papers cascading out of his arms. With precise, delicate hands, Draco shoved Potter’s head to the side and sank his fangs into his neck. Potter gave a groan that was half-pain, half pleasure. His eyelids fluttered…
Harry was silent for a moment. “Maybe they wouldn’t hate you as much as you think.”
Draco and Hermione were silent for a moment, stunned. “That’s impossible.” Hermione said finally.
“Don’t push me away.” Harry said. “I won’t go anywhere.”
One day, Harry caught him coming back after sneaking out through the secret passage. His hair was ruffled, but he looked as pale and sickly as ever. “They closed Quarantine.” Draco said. “How’s that for ironic?”
This was Harry’s chance to let Draco go.
“You never do what I want you do.”
Of course, her utterances about how important it was to stay in communication hadn’t stopped him from tossing his new phone on his bed as soon as he arrived back in the dormitories.
magic. You won’t get away with this!”
He turned to wave at the dark-haired figure to his left, and Slughorn shoved Draco forward.
“Oh.” Ron looked confused. “She was talking through one of those mirrors during quarantine to someone. Wasn’t that you?”
“Why?” Draco could feel tears starting behind his eyes, but he pushed them back.
“Is there any chance I’ve been exposed to it?” Draco asked.
“Stop.” Potter hissed. “I know you still care.”
Pain split his skull open. Pain greater than any he’d experienced, like his very soul was being removed, like his skin was being torn off. This was agony, worse than his scar, worse than the Cruciatus Curse.
Of course, they started off with completely different hobbies, opposite daily routines. When Harry read, Draco exercised. When Draco practiced spells, Harry watched
And Harry couldn’t explain the twinge in his chest when Ron said that.
Draco bucked his hips up, and Harry relented long enough to grab the lube and start slicking up Draco’s dick, the pressure of his hands warm and even and
“You shouldn’t have gone out.”
about being above the law, Professor McGonagall?”
“She’s--I’m sure she’s coming.” Harry said. “Just takes a while to get backup, going to London and all.”
The cowboy retrieved the rod from where it had fallen in the struggle. “Now, all this squabblin’s not good fer business. But, Mr. Malfoy, I already took the liberty of writing a letter to your father. Lucius is transferring the funds as we speak. And let’s be honest, it isn’t likely he’ll miss a son like you.”
so that it broke with a crack. The pain forced Harry to his knees.
Harry grasped Draco’s wrist. Draco’s eyes darkened, and Harry saw fangs start to peek out over his lower lip.
such a special gift, and deliver it to a more
“Change of plans,” Draco said loudly, and he knelt, conjuring a velvet box out of thin air. “If you agree, that is.”
Several times, especially when the plane shook from turbulence, Draco had considered jumping out a window, trusting  his vampire strength to protect him, and casting a Cushioning Charm to slow his landing.
“No one gets to be the hero in this.” Draco said. “We’re in this together.” He nipped at Harry’s neck, enough to raise a welt on Harry’s skin.
“I’m sure he doesn’t want to see me.”
“Shut up and listen to me,” the voice that issued through the phone was clear and direct. Of all of the golden trio, it was Hermione that had changed the most since the battle. Where before she’d been intimidating, she was now terrifying. Where before she’d been intense, now she incinerated. Whenever she spoke, the room went completely silent.
.” Draco said. “In the right place at the right time.”
Draco sat up. “Exactly. You’re thorny; you cut open anything you touch, anyone you love. You’re just a weakness.”
Draco swore. “How long is this going to be?” Draco ran a hand through his hair, feeling his chest tighten.
you to believe. All the liberal governments and elites, too concerned with equality to see that their heads are up their own asses. Indeed, such messaging is a prominent reason why your Dark Lord failed. He built his ideas under superstition and speculation, easily debunked at every turn by the
"It's my last name.'
“The witch,” Ron said. “Is she dead?”
“D’you think Hermione’s coming to get us?” Ron turned to Harry after running his hands along a wall, his expression hopeful.
"Helps with what?'
“Because—” Harry stopped. Something was holding his breath in, keeping his words caught in his chest.
He wanted everything.
Harry closed his eyes and flicked his wand at himself,
"Wanna play Monopoly?"
Harry hadn’t visited the portrait of Ariana Dumbledore since the Battle of Hogwarts. He hadn’t even bothered to reopen the passageway. In fact, he would have felt better if no one had ever disturbed her at all.
“I’m trying to look presentable.”
Draco had thought they were together.  He kept waiting for Harry to pull him aside, or into one of the fancy hotel rooms. For an opportunity to declare what they’d both felt, to seal it with their lips and bodies. For Draco to tell Harry how sorry he was that it had taken him this long.
“If you could please stop flirting with every attractive person in our vicinity—"
his face twisted in disgust—“with Malfoy.”
When he reached the bottom, he was greeted by a floating tray of champagne. Draco plucked a glass and sipped it, his taste buds alert for any hint of drugs.
“You were in quarantine, and no one was watching you together, trying to figure out what you were to each other. Isn’t it interesting that you became something else whenever the outside world didn’t matter?”
Finally, Ron looked up at him.
I’ve severed every professional and magical bond between us. And I still
“I’ll take my chances in the castle.”
This was
He couldn’t feel Harry anymore.
“The people who took Harry and Ron. I’m a monster, Granger. And I’m going to be starving when we get there.”
Have fun y'all. We got another chapter after this one.
Harry’s next question was spoken soft and quickly, as though he was afraid of the answer. “Do you want—
“For the moment, that we do not want it,” Heath said. He waved his wand, and a long, metal rod with a crimson jewel appeared in his hand. “However, should our visit prove to be unsuccessful…”
“Go back to school, Mr. Potter.” Lucius spoke in his eloquent, clipped voice, which belied his disheveled state. “You should be in quarantine. This is a family affair.”
"If I'm going to be stuck here with you, it can't just be all dour silences and emo brooding."
Hermione opened her mouth to ask something else, but Draco held up a hand. “This is all very alluring, but I’ve seen no proof. For all I know, you’re some crackpot with a journal and too much time on your hands. Have you successfully tested this—
He was somewhat right, but that didn’t stop him from being infuriating.
The whispering stopped, and Harry heard the rustling of papers.
Harry thought.
"Question, or drink." Harry held up the bottle. “It’ll be fun.”
“I said, leave her out of this!”
“What are you doing?”
He shook the vodka in Draco's face. "Will this convince you to play with me?'
And then the gem touched Harry’s forehead.
Harry told himself.
"Oh, okay. Well, we have those magazines--"
“And since when have you ever cared about the rules? Merlin’s beard, you sound like Granger.”
He kept his wand in his hand, but he hadn’t managed to do much more than move the rock in the intervening hours. Even that effort exhausted him—it was like trying to pick up a tiny pebble with oven mitts. Everything was clumsy and awkward, and he still couldn’t do any more complex spells.
Draco shook his head. He needed to focus. Harry was lying on his bed, unconscious. Draco had managed to Disapparate them both out of the bar and into the Hog’s Head, and then it had been a simple levitation spell through the darkness.
“My apologies, Mr. Bolton. We were just discussing our dinner plans,” Draco said. “Would you two mind joining us at the Eiffel Tower’s restaurant later this evening?”
Draco smiled softly, and his eyes shone with unshed tears. “Harry.”
He loved that temper, especially the way Potter’s simmering anger sent a burst of energy through his own veins.
“We need to talk.”
“A Hogwarts without Malfoy,” Ron said. “What a lovely thought.”
Harry’s blood ran cold. “You killed her.”
“Likewise,” Hermione said, letting her gaze linger on the woman’s toned calves. Draco pretended to cough so as to hide his surprise and amusement. Hermione’s attempt at flirting came off the way her magic did: startling and overtly intense.
“Harry talks in his sleep.”
The kettle gave a low whine. Draco turned back around. “What?”
Draco and Harry play a game.
“Potter, do not disappoint me.” Her voice had that edge to it, and Harry found himself agreeing before he could stop himself, “Yes, Professor McGonagall.”
“No,” Harry shook his head. “I think we should—”
“And he also saved your life!” Hermione’s left hand twitched, and Harry knew she was thinking of the
“I wouldn’t call it that—"
Draco tossed the ball up and caught it, his face expressionless. “Told you I don’t fancy you.”
Then he eyed the tiny rock he’d kicked to the corner of his cell.
, his mother wrote back
Draco was sipping from the hot chocolate, his badass combat boots propped on a table. Harry left the show on, bewildered. He didn't think he'd ever heard Draco laugh.
McGonagall tipped her head to the side. “What are you suggesting, exactly?”
Maybe it was wrong that they clung to the people they loved like a lifeline, terrified of the drowning that might occur when they let go--
He couldn’t believe it had happened.
Now, Harry stretched out on his bed and stared at the ceiling. His stomach growled; Aberforth had sent over food, but he was still hungry. It seemed that he was always making up for those years of near-starvation at the Dursleys whenever he was at Hogwarts. The thought of being stuck in this room with little food and no entertainment for an indefinite period reminded him uncomfortably of the time he, Ron, and Hermione had spent hunting Horcruxes.
Draco closed his eyes, remembering. Potter’s eyes burned even brighter when he climaxed, like they were glowing.
hungry. Potter’s heart was beating fast, pumping that delicious blood through his veins. His cheeks were flushed with it.
He lowered his wand.
Someone stupid enough to follow him.
“Can the two of you stop bickering? I’d like some peace and quiet.” Harry glared down at his pancakes. A part of him looked forward to spending the break alone, but the other part wanted to listen to Ron and Hermione bicker some more.
“What? No.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Harry lowered his wand, pointing it instead at the door, which swung shut behind him.
Harry said nothing, but shifted away from Draco on the couch. When he finished his sandwich, he got up, grabbed a magazine from the shelf, and sat in one of the corner armchairs
“I’ve never been in a car.” Draco shook his head. “Honestly, Granger.” He tried to lean his head against the window, but the plasticky material was too uncomfortable. “You could have at least gotten us first class.”
Already, the lack of magic inside of him made him feel old and exhausted. Harry fought to keep his eyes open, afraid that closing them would mean they never opened again.
“Hermione, I don’t think this is that big of a deal—”
All to save her son. All because it was the best chance for Draco to live, no matter what happened to her, no matter what side ended up winning.
in school." Draco said. "I liked that."
Sympathy was the last thing Draco wanted. He just wanted everyone to stay the hell away from him.
Ariana didn’t answer.
They were tired and sweaty from wall ball, and Draco was laying on the floor, staring up at the ceiling. His white t-shirt was a little see-through, stuck to him with sweat.  Lately, the tiniest athletic activity seemed to exhaust him.
Harry held up the phone. “Hermione. Tell him.”
And Draco didn’t either. He didn’t even know if he meant what he’d said, about making Harry forget. For how
What if Malfoy Manor only opened to those who were truly human?
"Where the grand gesture gets the girl in the end? Or, the best friends fall in love? Or, she doesn't realize until the last minute that he's meant for her?"
So why the sudden change?
He rushed forward, trying not to overhear the whispered exchange between Ron and Hermione, which seemed to oscillate frantically between seduction and concern for his well-being.
“Let’s talk about what we’re gonna do when we get there.” He said, trying to distract himself from his thoughts, which kept turning with unerring tendency toward that night, when Potter had faced him across a marble floor, his voice thick with pain.
“I need to speak with you.”
They’d started making up all kinds of ridiculous rules. You had to make yourself fly to touch the wall. You could create illusions to distract your opponent from where the ball was. You could only use your feet to move the ball. Malfoy was a helpless cheater; he kept Summoning the ball and casting Repulsion Charms, and several times he’d nearly tackled Harry in his effort to get to the wall first.
But this was different, more personal. No one ever saw Malfoy like this, in these private moments before bed. No one had that privilege of seeing him when he wasn’t trying to be seen. Stripped of all his bravado, he was raw and arresting. He looked like art, like a painting come to life.
She towed him down the hallway and toward a flight of stairs. He clattered after her, neither of them speaking. Draco was getting a little winded. For someone so small, Granger was
Hermione grabbed him by the arm. “C’mon, we need to go over our plan.” She walked him over to a set of chairs on the patio. Fake Paris even had a fake bistro. It was disgusting.
Draco frowned. "What do you mean? Isn't that your name?'
"Fuck. Are you about to break into song?"
talked about his birth parents.
“What the Hell does that mean?” Harry got to his feet, but the witch raised her wand threateningly, and he sank down to his chair again. “What are you doing with the Muggles? What are you going to do with us?”
Draco pulled Harry to his feet, so that they were nearly chest to chest. Harry was a little shorter than Draco, and when he looked up, it was to see Draco's soft, thin mouth, to feel his chest rise and fall against his own.
The stranger staggered, bringing his hands to his eyes, and it was only now that Harry saw that his hair had grown bushy, that his suit was large and ill-fitting, that he was—
There is possibly only one more chapter (but who are we kidding? There's probably more). It's getting intense.Draco is at his breaking point. Harry knows what that means better than everyone.
There was nothing he wouldn’t do to save Harry Potter.
Harry shook his head. “You look—better than you have. Healthier.”
and the lights turned on.
“Did you kill her?” Ron shouted. “DID YOU KILL HERMIONE?”
What had happened between them that night at Harry’s apartment, and then the next morning, and then at Draco’s apartment, and for months afterwards, sneaking around the Ministry, through the depths of London, and even, one memorable time or two, in Harry’s office—
Draco’s turned up his nose. “I don’t have patience for blood traitors and half-bloods,” he sneered, tapping the back of Hermione’s hand with his wand as he did so, silently signaling to her not to make a move, not yet. She was practically vibrating with rage, and it was hard to keep the duo’s focus on him.
“No promises,” Harry muttered.
And the pain raged through, replaying every word, every kiss, every look between them that spoke of something terrifying and awe-inspiring, growing even more with every passing second, like the sun breaking through the clouds.
And the man immediately crumpled to the ground.
Of course Potter would be impervious to compulsion. He’d already proven himself able to throw off the Imperius Curse with hardly any training, because he was just
scar carved into her skin, one which no amount of potions and elixirs had ever managed to remove entirely. “Maybe it’s time to put all this aside.”
She watched him carefully. “You’ve thought about it. I can tell.”
“Does it have to be—”
Draco snarled helplessly.
The corner of McGonagall’s mouth twitched. “I see. Well, as Potter has a particular talent for eavesdropping—
“I thought I was a monster.” Draco smiled wryly, trying to pretend the words hadn’t cut him.
he added hastily. “Just some stupid Muggle show.”
Sometimes, he even liked working at the Ministry. It kept him underground, out of the sunlight. And sometimes, his enhanced hearing could catch the whispered conversations he wasn’t allowed into, so long as someone forgot to cast
“Damn.”
“Show yourself!” Malfoy climbed to his feet, his fangs descending past his lip. “Show yourself, you bloody
“Enough!” McGonagall’s eyes flashed, and her glare was more terrifying than he’d seen it since she’d been mid-curse during the Battle of Hogwarts. “I am going to set up a way for you to communicate directly with your parents, but you still are forbidden to see them.”
Harry awoke back in his cell, with Ron’s freckled face peering at him from the other one.
War of 1812.”
Hermione texted him almost daily with updates, and Ron occasionally sent a poorly taken selfie or two, but he was growing restless. It was already past time for spring break to be over, and the whole world seemed like it was just on hold, waiting for news of the next disaster, the newest outbreak.
“That’s not your concern,” the witch said. “We’ll return him in one piece—more or less.”
“Potter,” he whispered weakly.
his thoughts or Draco’s, passion or blood, magic, all tangled up in each other.
“That doesn’t mean you weren’t somehow exposed—”
“Like what? We hate each other, Potter. We’re mortal fucking enemies. One fuck isn’t going to change that.”
“You will go.”
“I don’t know why the two of you bother with this.” Hermione wrinkled it nose. “It’s absolutely barbaric.”
Draco had revived him long enough to shove a Blood Replenishing Potion down his throat, then tucked him into bed.
found any success.”
A woman with metallic purple eyeshadow paused from delivering a tray of drinks. “Wizards don’t get Muggle diseases! Here—” she shoved a bright pink drink into his hand. “Have some fun!”
“Did you give him this before or after you drank most of his blood?”
. It was absolutely infuriating—he didn’t care about these diseases. He probably thought only wizards descended from Muggles were susceptible; it was exactly the kind of pureblood thinking that he was known for.
‘His mother was dying,” Madame Malkin clucked sympathetically as she started to measure Ron’s arms and legs. “He wanted to be there for her.”
“Pardon?”
“We hope your vampire tracking is something they haven’t thought of. If they’re anything like the Death Eaters here, they won’t have taken precautions from people who aren’t—"
Harry had barely looked at him once they emerged from the facility, panting and bloodstained.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione had begun to send Patronuses and Summon owls, and within hours, the American and British authorities had assembled in one of Treasure Island’s famed conference rooms to shout at each other.
Harry burst through the door, his wand raised, ready to cast a stinging hex, a Repulsion Charm, anything to prevent Draco from making the biggest mistake of his life—
Harry was silent for a long moment.
Harry scoffed over Draco's soliloquy, and for a moment thought he had overstepped.
Malfoy’s mother was sick? Since when? Why hadn’t he said anything?
“Vulnerable—” Harry laughed incredulously. “He’s a
“They made a fake Europe. How tacky.” Draco looked up at the fake Eiffel Tower. “And inaccurate.”
“You were a
“Professor, I don’t—”
“You are to stay here for the duration of the break, and longer if necessary. You are dismissed.”
“Excuse me?”
“First time for everything,” Hermione snapped. Then she slid him a piece of paper.
“What are you doing?” Harry shouted as Ron walked out of his cell, his face smooth and blank, tears still falling from his eyes. “Where are you taking him?” The cowboy followed him, his wand held aloft like a puppeteer.
The kiss lit up every neuron in Harry's brain, and at the same time, it felt intoxicating, like he'd downed that entire bottle of vodka and then moved on to whiskey. His limbs felt leaden and fluid, and he was barely aware of his own whimpering as Draco deepened the kiss, as he moved him over to the couch, running his lips along Harry's jawline and neck.
He slammed the door in Draco’s face.
McGonagall shook her head. “Leaving the castle would put you, and everyone you come into contact with, in danger. You will risk exposure to the virus once again, and you could then expose anyone you come into contact with. Draco,” she said, her voice softening the tiniest bit, “The best thing you can do for your family is to stay away from them.”
Harry winced. "Please don't--"
“There have been confirmed cases of coronavirus in the castle. Until you can be tested, you must shelter in place. I repeat, do not go back to your dormitories. Stay where you are.”
Draco looked away. “I’m not talking about this with you.”
Draco pushed it away in disgust.
was going to survive it, only that he had to try…
, and she—”
Harry’s therapist had told him that it would take time for his friends to fully forgive him. That even though they knew it wasn’t his fault, the link between him and their dead family members would remain. It was an invisible line, tethering him to their loved ones. For a while, all they’d see was the death he’d brought.
He found Malfoy in seconds, partly because there were only ten or so people left in the castle, but also because Malfoy was always in the library this time of day. He had been for the entire seventh year, and Harry could never figure out why.
"So--"
The woman inspected a nail. “I’d be much more worried about yourselves, if I were you. After all, once our main phase of the experiment is complete, you’ll be as expendable as the Mudblood.”
“Precisely. These are our Muggle test subjects. We’ve imbued each of them with a tiny sliver of magic, just enough to get the blood flowing, so to speak. Then we test their abilities by putting them in a situation where they might need it—something of severe emotional or physical distress: fights for resources or starvation, for example.
“How did Malfoy react?” Hermione asked suddenly. “Learning that wizards are susceptible to a Muggle disease must be the Ninth Circle of Hell for him and his family.”
"Apologizing every time you say something awkward. At this rate, you'll be apologizing until the lights come back on."
Draco lurched to his feet, stumbling toward Harry, reaching out to touch him, to hold him, to tell him anything he wanted, everything, just to get Harry in his arms again, just to stop this
He stayed like that, pinned in agony, until the merciful blankness of unconsciousness took over.
Draco wrapped his arms tightly around Harry, the blood hitting him with a sudden wave of ecstasy. He’d been attracted to the guy in the bar, sure but this was
Harry didn’t move, “Draco—”
“I was trying to protect her!” Harry shouted. “She was better off without me.” His eyes flashed. “
“Do what you want,” Draco said. “But I think it would look stunning on you.”
Lucius put his hand to his lips. “I—I don’t understand. When—”
Harry felt a trickle of hope surge into his limbs. How could they have made such a foolish mistake? They could escape easily now, bring the whole Ministry back to dismantle whatever horrendous operation these American wizards had going.
Draco was sitting up on the bed, cradling a skeletal-looking woman in his arms. Her silvery hair was strewn all over his chest, individual strands gleaming on the black silken sheets. Her fingers were long and thin, and Harry could practically see the shape and color of the bones beneath.
With none of the usual haunts open, Harry had no idea what Malfoy would do in Hogsmeade. Of course, he could have simply used it as a stopping-off point for Apparition, which meant he could be anywhere by now…
“Yes, Professor.”
“Fine.” She rolled her eyes. “We’ll go to the library while he’s there. To
Harry had to get right in front of them before they noticed him, and it was Malfoy who noticed him first, his bright blue eyes widening.
The fFrewhiskey must have been going to Draco’s head. Potter’s face was swimming in front of him, and he was beginning to notice things that he thought he’d forgotten, like that Potter always smelled like grass and cinnamon, that he always walked with the readiness of a born athlete, that he was so
The pebble trembled.
There were so many things that Draco wanted to say in that moment, so many things he wanted to Harry to know. That Harry had brought happiness to his life when he thought he deserved nothing, that he could be content to simply watch Harry from across a room, and it would be enough, that there was no one else in the world that Draco could imagine waking up next to, that he had been in denial about love being anything but destruction, but he thought their love might just be enough to withstand anything, that he was sure and terrified all at once, and he loved him so fucking much he wasn’t sure his immortal body could contain it…
He crossed the room and wrenched Potter’s wand out of his hand, then cast a curse that forced him to his knees.
Lucius stopped. “Why should I believe anything you say? You aren’t my son—you’re a filthy, bloodsucking—”
“The Center for Magical Diseases and Infections thought so too,” Neville said, “But it’s happening. Kingsley has ordered the school to send children home. Immediately. “
as though he’d never been there. As though he was—
Ron had sat up to watch Harry’s attempts. At his question, he shook his head. “I tried everything Hermione taught me about undoing enchantments. Everything--the cowboy and the woman came in here to watch me do it. And
But then Malfoy heard Harry’s television blaring
He loved Harry. Even if he’d never say it, even if it meant nothing because he was too shredded and useless, too broken a soul to ever be with one as golden as Harry’s, it didn’t matter.
because they spoke of something that could never be severed, something that encompassed loving beyond a moment, beyond all time, that would live long after both of them had become dust… nothing more needed to be said.
“Potter!”
“Do you think Malfoy will be there?”
He took Granger’s hand in his own and looked into her eyes. “When do we leave?”
"Anna was my favorite person in the world," Draco said. "And I fell in love with her. And then she met him." He shook his head. "Everyone was so excited when they got together. She'd loved him for so long, and it always seemed like he never even noticed. Except
“Yes, the cards all show it, Harry!’ She shook one at him aggressively. “Famine. Destruction. Death looms ever closer!"
“You can also kill her. Her condition attacks her immune system. If you are infected—”
“Time to go, Malfoy.” Harry grabbed his arm, but the other boy was incredibly strong. It was like trying to move stone.
“No. I will not rest my mother’s life on Harry Potter.” Draco said. “Move, or I’ll blast you.”
He could only watch, horror growing in his stomach, as the cowboy entered his cell, now clad incongruously in scrubs and cowboy boots, holding a long, metal rod with a pulsating crimson gem at the top of it. “What is that?” Harry tried to say, but nothing came out.
There was a crack, and Harry’s wrist sprang out of Draco’s grip, healing instantly.
Harry, as it turned out, wasn’t much of a strategist. At least, not against Draco Malfoy. He kept getting distracted. It was all he could do to remember which piece moved where, and Draco still had to correct him sometimes.
“What are we?” Draco lifted his chin. “Tell me what we are.”
“Sorry, but you cannot leave until the rest of the staff has been cleared.”
Harry’s vision went fuzzy as Draco fucked his mouth, finally coming back into focus as Draco came, spilling down Harry’s throat.
Blaise shrugged.
And then Malfoy stopped, so abruptly and precisely it seemed almost inhuman. He turned his head slowly until he was staring exactly at where Harry was standing, and his nostrils flared, like he was scenting the air.
“I don’t have a problem destroying this portrait.”
Harry felt a surge of hatred. Maybe he should just leave Malfoy to his fate. Maybe contracting a “Muggle disease” would be a fitting and ironic way for him to die.
Draco thought he saw Harry move, but he willed himself to look back at Professor McGonagall. He didn’t know how to explain what had happened last night. He wasn’t sure he
But the assembled press, the onlookers, Harry and Draco’s exes, ready to pop out of the woodwork any moment….
“How was it?” Ron had asked.
“And Potter—try not to kill him, won’t you?”
“I just told you, Potter. Fuck off.”  Potter didn’t need to know he’d been looking at vampire anatomy, trying to figure out how much blood he could ration before he started to desiccate.
"I've only ever read
he could practically hear Hermione say.
He stepped through the threshold, a hundred curses on his lips.
“I hate Americans,” Draco said. “And I don’t care who knows it.”
Draco dipped his head. “My father would certainly be interested in this,” he was careful to sound afraid, even though he could feel Hermione’s disdain beside him. “Perhaps if there was a place where we could draw up an agreement?”
He glanced at Hermione, who shook her head. They couldn’t attack, couldn’t raise the alarm, without knowing where Ron was.
“Shut up and listen. I need you to go to America.”
The waiter smiled back, and Draco noticed his eyes were a pale green, like seaglass. “I think you could
And Draco forgot everything he had been planning to say.
All he wanted was to sleep.
Harry’s head was throbbing. It felt like someone was banging a hammer on the inside of his skull.
a little too loud, and he finally stalked over, snarling that dragons never acted like that and why were people so hard on Jaime Lannister anyway?
wizards.”
Draco was suddenly standing before his father, his face feral, his lips pulled back to reveal his fangs—“say his name.”
They had to get him out. Had to.
“I have my ways. Besides, at the hotel you took a shower that was like, four years long.”
“I already programmed mine and Ron’s numbers in there. Promise you’ll text us.”
Harry tried to steel himself against the feelings rising up in him, tried to let Draco walk out the door. He knew that it was different this time, that if Draco walked out, he would never come back. What had happened between them in quarantine, the electric moments they’d shared in Vegas, would dissipate into memories, clouded over by cobwebbed nostalgia and circumstance.
McGonagall sent her Patronus to check in on them every few days, but their conversations were short and unproductive. Her Patronus merely delivered information, and it was always the same: cases were increasing, it still wasn’t safe, they didn’t know how long it would take, and more were dying every day. “Do you need anything?” the Patronus always asked last, but Harry couldn’t think of anything that was actually necessary.
“Like anyone would want to go to your home, Malfoy,” Harry muttered. “No one wants to watch your father drink mimosas and impulse-buy expensive art.”
In fact, he seemed to be climbing floors, going ever-upward.
But here Draco Malfoy was, standing before him.
He couldn’t spend one more second pretending to be this person, the one he’d been during the war, who sneered at wanton destruction and cared only for himself and no one else.
“Fuck off, Potter.”
“I’d like to be excused from this conversation,” Harry said. “For the rest of my life.”
“Science?” Draco broke in. “I don’t understand.”
“Oh, you’ll have patience for this one. I believe you are acquainted.” Dijikstra smiled serenely, and Draco felt Hermione tense beside him. ‘
charm had swept all of that out of his head. What else did they talk about that was too private for Harry’s ears? What was McGonagall hiding?
A wizard in Surrey had manage to manufacture a vaccine in the first week of May. Within weeks, enough of the population had been inoculated that quarantine had lifted. Even in the mMggle world, people had started to poke their heads out into the world again. Friends embraced on the streets. Lovers reunited.
He was just in the way.
So Harry hadn’t protested when Ron had explained the Weasleys’ plans. He hadn’t pushed Ginny when she’d said she needed time, time to be by herself and work through the trauma she’d experience fighting the Death Eaters at Hogwarts.
They came from a nearby empty classroom, and Harry’s wand jumped into his hand without thinking.
“My mum wants to know if you’d come home for Spring Break. A chance to toast the hero and all. We know you’re
“So? Muggle diseases can’t bother wizards, right?”
"So--I can go home, right?'
"What? How am I supposed to get home?"
“I’m serious.” Harry could feel himself blushing, but there was no going back now. “I want you to.”
What if his mother got sicker? What if he was here, and she—and he didn’t get to say goodbye?
“Well, it’s been over two weeks,” Draco was pulling on his socks and shoes, checking his hair’s appearance in the mirror (the previous evening had messed it up spectacularly).
“Mr. Malfoy? Mr. Malfoy, are you listening to me?”
Harry leapt up the steps and dashed through the door, his wand raised, looking around desperately for Draco—
“You are both poised to be leaders of the community, following your graduation from this school. Potter, you have already expressed your ambition to become an Auror. And Malfoy, Professor Slughorn tells me that you have a talent for politics.”
“I can’t be infected.” Draco said. “My blood, my cells—the virus affects humans. And I am not a human being anymore.”
“But you’re immortal?”
Harry snapped out of it and stared down at the game board, trying to focus on the pieces.
Ariana still didn’t look afraid, but she turned and disappeared down the hallway without another word. The portrait swung open.
The next thing Harry knew, he and Draco were on the bed, Draco’s mouth still latched onto his neck.  Draco deftly unbuckled Harry’s belt and pulled his pants down, running his fingers over Harry’s shaft in a way that made Harry’s stomach knot and his skin catch fire.
“I wasn’t trying to kill him. I was just—
“What?” Harry’s hand went to his neck, impulsively. “Our blood? Our souls?”
The sounds Draco was making were hardly human. He keened like an animal, the grief shuddering through him in waves that never seemed to dissipate.
"Stop that."
Draco’s face twisted. “Then
“Times change.”
Harry bit the inside of his cheek.
Ron dropped the rod and wrapped his arms around Hermione, lifting her off her feet.
“I really don’t want to—”
And it's only the beginning.
“I don’t believe they’ve taken our magic forever.” Harry said firmly. “There must be some way for us to get it back. And we’re going to figure it out.”
“I’ll be fine.”
Harry heard whispering in an odd language, and a chill went up his spine. Something dangerous lurked on the other side of that door, he was sure of it.
But Blaise must have done something, because after that, Harry rarely worked with Draco. It was usually only if their shifts overlapped; Harry coming in for the evening, Draco finishing out the morning. There was one memorable time when Harry had covered Ron's morning shift with Draco, and they’d been forced to work together for four hours. They didn't say a word to each other the entire time.
of me. I
Harry thought, but the thoughts weren’t his. They were someone else’s, someone who knew him through this bond and beyond it, someone across a gulf of miscommunication and pain and death.
And Draco looked upon the face of Harry Potter for the first time since that wonderful, terrible night.
Draco’s nose crinkled. “What makes you think I care what you  have to say, Potter?”
a spell erase nearly a decade of duels, insults thrown in the hallways, fights, spells and breakneck attacks?
"Oh, okay do I--"
He was feeling weak and tired again, but Draco’s hard on was still pressing into his stomach.
“It’s not that they think it’s your fault, or they blame you.” She said. “It’s just that grief can be irrational.”
Mr. Malfoy. I shall keep you apprised of the situation.”
Her eyes narrowed. “I’ll be at the exit when you leave.”
Even he and Ron had reached their breaking point—but with Malfoy—he wouldn’t last twenty-four hours.
“I don’t care, Potter!” Draco shouted. “You hear me?” Green sparks shot out of the end of his wand. “I. Don’t. Care.”
“I hate you,” Draco whispered brokenly.
Harry grabbed his coat, unable to believe his luck, and dashed out the door, only to skid all the way into his bike, sending it, and himself, tumbling to the ground
If all they had to count on was this moment, Draco wanted to make it last.
“I—it was a stupid question, Draco! Let it go!”  Harry was turning bright red, which was unbelievably attractive for a variety of reasons.
“Potter. Malfoy. My office. Now.” McGonagall appeared at their sides, her hair swept into its usual austere bun.
“Draco—” Lucius whispered, his voice shaking. He sat on the bed on the side opposite Draco and drew his wife’s hand to his face, cradling it, kissing her fingers.
“Was he?”
"Yeah, I'm not a fan." Harry could feel himself getting warmer inside, and took another sip of the vodka. It was starting to taste a little better now, though he still wished he had a chaser. "There are still things you can live for."
Ron snorted into his pudding, but Hermione pulled a face. “Why do you let Malfoy get to you, Harry? It’s not like he’s coming up with anything new.”
Which might have been touching had it not been for the fact that they were probably more concerned with their own self-preservation than his own.
The chess game started well enough.
“Just—get us out of here.” Ron started to chuckle, but it became a sob. “You’re the Chosen One.”
He didn’t know how many he had killed. Like a coward, he had turned away from the bodies when he was sated, spoken not a word to his parents as they led him back to their mansion, looked away from the casualty lists that adorned the
Harry fully expected to lose, but he was hoping that some of Ron’s strategy would have sunk into his brain by osmosis, and a brilliant game plan would come to him.
“It would die with me.” Harry said. “It’s
And Draco certainly did not like the look in the cowboy’s eyes.
“Come on, Harry.” Hermione half-smiled. “You know I found a way around that.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” Madame Dijikstra said, placing a placating hand on Draco’s arm. “I can assure you that we have made progress. We’ve simply had to make—adjustments to our earlier timeline.”
nothing happens."
There were footsteps coming down the hallway.
he thought.
“Well.” Draco straightened, smoothing a piece of hair back from his forehead idly. “
They were over the Atlantic Ocean, headed to New York, where they’d get on
Draco’s head snapped up. “I can Turn her, Father! It isn’t too late.”
But Harry and Draco couldn't care less about what anyone else thought. For Blaise and the firefighters, this was a natural disaster. A blizzard of epic proportions.
“You have ‘an unerring capacity to do the right thing,’ that’s what he said to me. You’d walk through fire to save someone else.”
“You can’t keep me here—” this was ridiculous, Draco knew the virus couldn’t take hold in his system; he was immune, he was immune to everything—“My mother—Professor—”
“I’m shocked you know what posthumous means, though since you’re using it incorrectly, it really can’t be helped.” Hermione said nastily.
And now he had to stay in a huge population, just to blend in, just to make sure no one came after him with wooden stakes or pitchforks, fake it and smile and act like everything was fine for the rest of his immortal existence.
McGonagall arrived the next day in person, having cast a Bubble Head charm around herself as a precaution.
Draco forced his fangs back, and his eyes met Harry’s. They looked at one another, for the first time, as something more than mortal enemies.
"So you found the vodka."
“What are you talking about?”
“How soon will we know if we have it?” Harry asked.
Harry fumbled around on the bed until he found his wand.
“Yes,” Draco looked away so that Potter wouldn’t know the whole truth. He could get blood from any human with a heartbeat, true. That had been well established.
“Should I stop you? I could, you know. This portal doesn’t open without my permission.”
Quidditch still managed to sweep away every problem in his head, at least as long as he flew fast enough.
Neville gulped. “Well, that’s the thing—it’s—spreading to the wizarding community. Several members of Puddlemere United have fallen ill after visiting a local pub.
“You aren’t saving me again.” Draco caught the ball and squeezed it so hard, he popped the rubber open. “It’s not worth it.”
And it was Narcissa Malfoy who had bought Harry that extra time.
But how could you block out what had already invaded your mind?
Draco stepped into the crushing darkness.
Conversations with McGonagall and Trelawney, while never boring, certainly weren’t a way to maintain his sanity.
Anybody would have been better than Draco Malfoy.
It was when Harry finally stepped back into the castle, thinking of taking a late lunch, his eyes slowly adjusting to the gloom, that he heard it.
"I don't deal in depression as the ultimate meaning of life." Harry said.
and he could already feel a bruise forming on his knee. Maybe it would be smart to stay in until the roads thawed out. There were sure to be dozens of accidents in weather like this.
McGonagall surveyed Harry and Malfoy, calculating. “Very well. Enjoy your break. You may go.”
But he’d quickly learned there was something—sweeter about it if it was someone he was attracted to. If it was someone he drank from in the throes of passion, or the lingering aftertaste of a kiss…
“If you’re done,” Hermione interrupted caustically. “We’d like two coffees, please.” She glared at the waiter until he walked away, shooting Draco an appraising gaze over his shoulder.
Harry exchanged a glance with Draco, and for a moment he wanted to do the same, rush into his arms and hold him there, hold him and never let him go again—
“I wanted to stop loving you!” Harry shouted, desperate for him not to leave, in spite of his earlier plans, in spite of what he’d decided when he’d heard the knock at the door and
CHAPTER 9: SEPTEMBER
, looking at him like this, for the rest of his life.
And in front of a group of very uncomfortable-looking wait staff, Harry had finally grabbed Draco by the shoulder and turned him so that they faced each other.
“Well. I
"Potter was where he had always been: in the way."
Draco bucked his hips up thrusting into Harry’s mouth, bringing tears to his eyes.
“Looks like we’re stuck here.” Potter sank down onto the floor by the wall, his head hanging.
But in these moments, watching Harry pace, talk to Hermione, glance surreptitiously at the photographers and fireplaces that ringed the Atrium, run a hand through his hair so that it got ruffled again…
“No.” And Ron was crying now, crying harder than Harry had ever seen him.
“If you want to be the next Minister, you will go. You will shake hands, mention how you and Potter—”
"Just go count your bills at the register.""
Too many who hadn’t lost much of anything.
He looked at the wall above him, tried spells to carve it out, to open it from that end. Perhaps he was just exhausted. He pointed his wand at a piece of rock that had broken apart from the wall. “
“Because”—Draco ran a hand through his hair. “Because—” he could hear the blood in McGonagall’s veins moving. He could nearly
Harry thought.
“I dunno.” Draco rolled over to look at Harry. “Do I look older to you?”
But there must have been something in Draco’s bite, some kind of relaxing and attracting agent, because Harry felt a surge of arousal hit his body, which already felt like it was going to burst, the moment Draco’s teeth broke through the skin of his neck. He moaned and went limp, his hands scrabbling at Draco’s back weakly, barely hanging on amid the flow of pleasure that coursed through his body.
“I’m not a Legilimens.” Hermione said. “I just have common sense. And we’re going together, or not at all. So
“Told you, Potter. I
To his right, the floor opened up, and people were dancing. There were couples all over the floor, spinning and twirling in each other’s arms, or simply holding each other.
“Ouch! What the hell, Granger?”
“We were camping out in the desert, tracking a couple of kidnapped Muggles,” Hermione began. “I woke up, and Ron and Harry were gone. I didn’t know where they went.” I tried to track them as best as I could, but—there’s no trail. Car tracks, footprints, all magical traces, everything—gone.”
“It’s a huge castle, Potter,” Draco spoke around the fangs descending in his mouth, not daring to do more than a half turn-around. “It shouldn’t be hard for you to stay away from me, unless you’re still obsessed with me, that is.”
The second floor opened onto a hallway that overlooked the floor below, still festooned with a chandelier remarkably similar to the one that had plummeted on top of Hermione on that terrible night—
When he was certain that she’d left, he bent his head to the man’s neck and  drank again.
Draco took one last look at Harry before disappearing through it, wondering if he was making the right choice.
And Harry said it, his eyes following Draco’s tongue as he licked some of the sweat from his lip. “What if you drank from me?”
“Malfoy?” Harry’s wand was pointed precisely at his chest, like he could hear where he was from the hallway, and he didn’t lower it, even when Malfoy held up his own empty hands defensively. “What in Merlin’s name are you doing here?”
“Over my dead body will you get Minister over me, Granger.”
Hermione opened her mouth to say something, but he was already disappearing inside the restaurant. He passed tourists posing in front of a cardboard cutout of the Eiffel Tower, a gift shop where tourists could buy little miniature towers for their home. “Ridiculous,” Draco scoffed, checking the price tag. “Everything about this town is fake.”
Draco in.
It wasn’t that it was difficult for him to stop. It was just that every time he drank someone else’s blood, he grew frustrated and angry. And he drank deeper and deeper, trying to convince himself that it was all he needed. That he wasn’t missing anything.
“What do you want?” Harry asked, after a few seconds of awkward silence. It was three in the morning, and he’d been lying in bed, willing his mind to empty.  His muscles were lead, and there was a stabbing pain between his eyes. The paperwork had taken hours, and then Percy had wanted a full debrief. Harry had though the questions would never end.
Footsteps, pacing back and forth hurriedly.
“Malfoy,” Harry muttered, trying to ignore the tightness in his pants, to convince himself it was nothing more than the mood of the club. “What the hell?”
Draco’s jaw ached…
He didn’t have a single person he could ask for help.
He didn’t know why he’d added that last line. He was just so
“This is outrageous! They can’t just keep us here.”
He got up and dressed, throwing on an old Slytherin t-shirt and sweats. Harry
The figure across from him, a mound of maroon and orange, finally stirred. Ron unwound his lanky limbs and pulled himself to a sitting position, using the bars as leverage. “M ‘fine.” Ron mumbled. “I just wanna go home.”
“I love you,” he whispered, and he pulled Harry in for another kiss, his hands gentle, stroking at his neck and his chest, still licking up the traces of blood that trickled from the wound in his neck.
Harry bit off the end of the word, blood rushing to his cheeks. His hands went into fists at his side. “All you do is destroy.” He whispered.
And now even that was gone.
Draco took another sip of vodka. "You tell people shit, and all they do is tell everybody about you behind your back. This whole place is like gossip girl--minus the hot people."
“We’ll come with you.” Blaise stretched languidly.  “I’ve never been one for school-sanctioned events anyway.”
Harry shook himself. Ron had been saying something, and he’d been distracted.
“Ariana Dumbledore died very young.” She said. “But her portrait is quite old, and people say a great deal when they believe nobody is listening.”
This is the end. Finally.
Harry stuck his wand in his back pocket. He held up his hands.
That thing that had passed between them the night of Narcissa’s death, that which had kept Draco in Harry’s arms that terrible night, had been extinguished like a candle in the rain. All that was left was hatred. Grief and cold disdain.
“Nice to see you again,” Draco said, his every word oozing disdain.
Draco shook his head. “I’m getting out of here. This party’s ridiculous.”
The people who died for him, even when he didn’t ask it, even when he would have given anything to have taken their place.
“Fuck.
“What do you want?” Draco whispered. “Baby, please,” he groaned as Harry started kissing down his chest, his lips sucking a mark on his hipbone before grazing, ever so slightly, across his dick. “Harry,
Draco had never felt a hunger like this before, and he’d never felt this—attraction—to any of his other prey.
be dead. Harry Potter would not die, not before Draco, not like this.
The corner of Draco's mouth twitched, but his tone was absolute. "You're staying here."
He had felt it every time he’d looked at Draco, since Draco had drank his blood during quarantine.  He’d felt it when he’d refused Draco at the party, when Draco had pressed him against the wall at his mother’s funeral. Every day that Draco had sneered at him at the Ministry. Every moment since he’d been aware of it, that feeling had been there.
Draco looked him up and down, slowly. “Thought I would complain.” He drawled. “Horrendous service.”
Draco looked at him, and his eyes had turned gray, the color of a sky that threatened snowfall. Magical. Fantastic.
“Tell me!”
They were two young boys, journeying through the Forbidden Forest, drawing closer to each other as the darkness pressed in from all sides.
“No.” Harry’s brow furrowed. “It wasn’t.”
Draco ran his tongue over his slowly descending fangs idly, still thinking of how
But his hands caught only air
He’d landed his Thestral just next to Malfoy’s. The pair had already huddled together in the trees, happy to be with a member of their herd
“Since you made a joke about my mother.”
He’d looked into those liquid eyes and it had all faded to blackness.
“You. Just. Know?”
like. “Malfoy—"
“I’m pushing you away because I don’t fucking need you anymore!” Draco shouted. “Quarantine’s over! We can go back to the way things were!”
Lucius’ lips trembled. He pressed them together. His long white hair, usually thick and shiny, was in straggly strands, pulled back in a bun. The bones stood out sharply on his cheekbones, and his eyes had a sunken-in look to them
Harry felt a strange sense of foreboding curdle in his stomach.
“I went after him.” Harry reminded him.
“’Potter’?” Harry echoed, bewildered.
Ron looked as though he were having a hard time grasping recent events. Or that might just be the bruise purpling over his eye. He glanced at the door. “They’re going to set off alarms. He won’t be down for long, and with most of us unable to do magic—”
Not only was he incredibly loud, panting and clattering his way down the hallway, but Draco could hear his heartbeat.
He looked at the owls perched all around him, and thought with a pang of Sirius. It felt like all he did here was walk the paths of old memories. Ghosts followed him at every turn.
But Draco had already thought of this. “I flew the Thestral at 9,000 meters. I’ve been in quarantine for long enough that there’s no trace of it. I didn’t touch anything—"
Harry had thought it was difficult being around Malfoy while school was in session, but it was doubly difficult now. There was no way to avoid him, no steady stream of other students to dull the painful brilliance of his hair, or to dissipate his sneers and mocking remarks.
“Let’s not wake her,” Ron had said. “We’ll get her if it’s serious.”
“You don’t mean that.” Hermione snapped from where the witches’ robes were. “And I hardly think that Hogwarts graduation robes are necessary, Ron. It’s only a party.”
to be rid of me. Well, now you are. Have a nice life,
He was all alone.
“Later.” But instead of following Harry out the door, Draco simply moved to a table and sat, still scrolling through his phone.
“And I cast a few Confusion spells to make sure they thought I wandered into the desert and died.” Hermione shrugged. “It’s simple really, just a matter of concentration.”
He gave a soft laugh at the thought that Malfoy snored. It was so—unrefined. He wondered how many girls had been sworn to secrecy after spending the night in his bed.
Harry’s heart sank—how was he supposed to know what the Room was if Malfoy didn’t say anything?
Draco took deep breaths, trying to calm himself. Surely it didn’t mean what he thought. Surely Potter wasn’t—
“What?”
"Besides, that wasn't what I called you over for." He reached behind the chess set and pulled out a glass bottle, about half full.
“I—I just know.”
Being a vampire only amplified what had always been there.
Draco looked down. "I uh--lived here for a while. Right after I graduated. I was living with Anna, but--"
His dick was hard and throbbing, and the pressure only seemed to be building as Draco pressed himself against Harry harder, wrapping his arms around him and squeezing him as though he were a human blood bag, and he wanted to swallow every last drop.
"Can I get you anything else?"  Harry asked desperately. At least if he was standing at the breakfast bar, he’d have something to do with his hands.
Harry thought to himself.
When she finished, Harry raised his wand.
“No one knows,” Hermione said, unable to resist the impulse to answer her question. “Some people are born with magic, and some aren’t,”
“Your mother is much safer with you here.” McGonagall finished in her clipped voice. “We are united on this, Mr. Malfoy. Your father has already informed me that should you arrive at their door, he will simply send you back here.”
Draco laughed drunkenly. “I tried to kill you. What part of that screams of my affection? I mean, the Dark Lord was quite
Draco squinted, but he could see nothing. Someone was invisible, lurking in the shadows. Someone who didn’t have a problem moving without being seen.
Harry shook his head. Thankfully, the Fiendfyre hadn’t permanently damaged the room’s magic. It had only destroyed the thousands of artifacts in the Room of Hidden Things, the bust of the troll, the glass stopper with that dark red substance…
“Ron.” Harry reached for his hand again, but he couldn’t reach it. “Ron.” He said, louder. “RON.”
Harry flicked his wand.
“Well, you know what to do. What are you waiting for?”
“Can we just go?” Hermione tapped her wand against her leg. “We’re wasting time.”
Lucius stopped. “What did you just say?”
Harry and Draco had settled into a tentative truce over the past few days. Stuck as they were in quarantine, it had become obvious that they needed to establish a few ground rules in order to avoid killing each other. Especially since Draco was apparently designed to kill people.
Never mind that his mother was pale and sickly, red splotches standing out along her skin. Her Healers never left her room with anything but somber expressions, and his father—
This was originally gonna be four chapters. It definitely is going to be longer than that. Hope all of y'all are staying safe and healthy, and finding ways to connect with people in spite of the isolation. It's rough out there.
“His family—“ Harry’s fingers twitched. “Is it his blood? Is he trying to save her? Is that why he tried to leave?”
Draco thought.
But Draco wouldn’t let it go. He couldn’t. “What makes you think that I want you?”
Ron stiffened, standing up absurdly straight.
Harry swallowed and swarmed up Draco’s body. He felt feverish, pressing hot kisses to Draco’s lips, licking his fangs to see if he could taste the vampire venom.
The cowboy got to his feet, blood trickling from a wound in the back of his head. ”
“Why aren’t you taking this seriously? You agreed to help me.”
“It still sounds like you wanted me gone,” There was an undercurrent of hurt Draco’s in his voice, and the kettle was now a dull roar. “So I’ll do you a favor.”
Anyway, it's a few months later, and Draco and Harry are about to announce their relationship at a press conference....
McGonagall threw open the door and vanished back into the hallway
And in a moment, Draco was gone. He dressed and left the room so fast, it was like he’d nearly DisApparated.
Draco brought his knees to his chest and leaned against the headboard, urging his heart rate to slow down, his breathing to even out. He closed his eyes, concentrating. Calling forth Harry’s voice, that feeling that had laced between them in Vegas, connecting once again when Harry had returned to London a few hours ago.
Harry Potter lived in a penthouse in downtown London, nowhere near any other wizarding dwellings. Draco thought it must be a product of the war, to hide in plain sight, where no pureblood wizard would deign to search. No one would expect the Chosen One, the most celebrated wizard of the century, to live near Muggles.
“Thought you’d come looking for me.” The waiter appeared at his elbow almost as though he’d been conjured there.
“But—your medallion!” Hermione said, still a little starry-eyed. “I thought you were dead.”
He tried to scream, but the charm held him fast. Tried to warn Ron, to cry, to beg, but he couldn’t move.
‘Oh, you know. Balmy. Slight breeze. Fuck if I know, Hermione. I’m not a fucking crystal ball!”
Draco shook his head at the memory. He had to forget it. He had nearly killed Harry, nearly drained his body of its blood, and who knew how close he’d come next time? Who knew how easily he could have drank and drank, until no amount of potions or spells could bring him back?
Draco held up a hand, thinking. He had to get the exact order of the words right. Longbottom had done it first—so it must have had security measures against Snape, the Carrows, and other students.
Harry mumbled indistinctly.
Draco’s voice came to live in his head.
And Harry disappeared into the darkness, because wherever Draco Malfoy went, he had to follow.
“This is just research on Dark creatures,” Harry said, disappointed. “It’s for Professor Sheen’s class.”
at him. He’d never wanted them to find out. He’d known what would happen.
like flying on a broomstick.
They always used to spend parties like this: ensconced in a single room, sprawled around each other on the floor, dizzy with smoke and drunk on Firewhiskey. All of the Slytherin parties, the Yule Ball, any of the Hogwarts celebrations, had ended that way, with Draco and his mates in some room, laughing themselves hoarse, forgetting everything but the night.
After Harry had stayed there like that, holding Draco while his world fell apart, holding him like it might hold them both together, Lucius had left them alone for a while.
“I don’t think—” Bolton interrupted.
All he had to do was say nothing for two more seconds.
Finally, he looked down. “Granger. You’re in my way.”
“You aren’t
Draco frowned.  “You know, you’re quite an accomplished Legilimens. The Dark Lord should have recruited you.”
“He’s up to something—"
If Draco wasn’t upset about his own predicament, it might have been satisfying that Potter had finally found a rule he couldn’t worm his way around. “That’s insane! How will we survive that long?”
“I don’t want to go.”
And it had been so
But Aunt Bellatrix was always drawn to the smell of blood.
Harry shook his head. “I promised him this. He has a thing for grand gestures.” Inside, though, Harry was agreeing with Hermione. What if this was all a ruse? What if Draco was doing all of this just to humiliate him?
“How?”
Can’t you see that?”
Harry had tuned her out, thinking of taking a fly around the Quidditch pitch later, when she suddenly slammed something on the table in front of him. He jumped, then rolled his eyes.
Potter flinched. “Don’t be like this.” He placed his drink on the ground and crossed his arms.
love you.”
Draco could feel him trembling. But Potter wouldn’t let out a whimper of pain. He wouldn’t even ask for mercy.
to go, to keep up appearances.
“Still don’t want me to be the hero?” Harry said shakily, but his hands reached up to reach around Draco’s waist, so that Draco had to climb onto his lap. Draco was now nearly straddling Harry, and he could feel Harry’s hardness against his own. His hands slid from the bed to Harry’s back, but he held him lightly, nearly trembling with restraint.
"You ever read those romance novels?" He tipped his head to the side, and took the bottle back. His fingers fumbled over it a little, and Harry realized that Draco was already tipsy.
“Glad I finally managed to shut you up,” Draco spat, before dashing down one of the moving staircases.
“Are you alright? Is it your scar again?”
And already, he was beginning to get hungry.
responsible.”
“I paid you back.” Harry rested his hand against the wall, as though he could feel the outline of the door. “I pulled you out of the fire. I grabbed your hand.”
"Don't count on it." Draco muttered. "I'll be right back." He rushed out the door and emerged a few moments later with a phone charger. "It's icy out there. There's no way we're leaving until this clears."
After another week, Harry could tell that Draco was getting desperately hungry again. He kept watching Harry eat, and he sounded as though he were having nightmares.
it. Get the fuck out of my life.”
“I’m not
Harry thought.
But that was before. Before he’d been bitten at the Battle of Hogwarts. Before he’d become a monster, able to tear apart anyone who so much as sneezed at him.
Finally, Draco snatched the lube out of Harry’s hand and slicked up his fingers. “C’mere,” he whispered, and Harry positioned himself precisely between Draco’s legs like he’d been waiting for this all along, like this was something they’d done a thousand times before, and it seemed that way except for the fucking
“The survivor’s guilt is normal, too. But there is no way of knowing if your choices would have kept more or less people alive. You defeated Voldemort in the end, and the Wizarding World is at peace. That is what matters.”
“I don’t blame them,” Harry colored in the picture they’d given him, keeping his eyes down. “I
“You are no son of mine. You are a monster with my son’s voice!  And I won’t listen to a word you say! Get out of here at once, or I’ll curse you!” Lucius drew his wand and pointed it, shaking.
“Do you want me to punch you again?”
Draco didn't even glance at him.
The alleyway adjoining the Hog’s Head, the one the noise had come from, ended in a dead end and a dumpster. Harry frowned. Where had the sound come from?
“A few
Draco’s face twisted, but his fangs were lengthening, and his mouth was open, panting. “If you want to leave,” he said. “You should do that now.”
He waited for the monster to erupt in his chest. The one that had emerged so viciously when he’d seen Ginny and Dean embracing in that corridor during Sixth Year. The one that assured him that Ginny had been it: is person, his soulmate. The person he was meant to love for the rest of his life.
The cowboy waved his wand, and the desert floor in front of them shimmered to reveal a staircase, well-lit and ornate, descending below in a tight spiral.
Harry knew that voice anywhere, even though he wished he didn’t. “What do you want, Malfoy?”
The ‘please’ was what caught his attention. Granger never asked anyone for anything. He sank into the desk chair, resting his feet on the table. “You’re the ‘brightest witch of your age,’” he said, making air quotes around the phrase. “What can I possibly do that you haven’t done already?”
Harry closed out of the article without reading further. It was more of the same; he wondered why Hermione bothered to even send them to him.
And when he finally got to his feet, he swore that he would never cry again.
“And if we’re here longer than that?”
“McGonagall’s orders. None of your business.”
Harry’s hands shook. “I don’t want to talk about this.”
“LIKE HELL.” A large figure emerged and tackled the cowboy to the ground. They rolled over on the floor, the larger figure’s red hair flying, his fists pummeling the cowboy’s head over and over.
“Looks like we’re cancelling our trips, then.” Ron glanced at Harry. “Do you want to come home with me?”
He looked up for a moment, and his eyes met Harry’s. All the grief in them seemed to vanish, replaced by a simmering rage. His pupils widened, and his eyes turned black. His fangs descended so quickly, they pierced his bottom lip, and it was with a mouthful of blood that he spat at Harry:
(I quote DH and HBP a lot, so uh--credit to JKR, except not really bc they're mine now. bye.)
Harry leaned down to kiss up Draco’s chest, leaving his own marks on his collarbone, up to his neck which made Draco gasp and moan against him. “Let me take care of you,” Harry said again.
Harry wandered over to one of the grand columns next to the bench. He leaned against it, taking his time to mull over his answer. Finally, he said, “I wanted to see how you were doing.”
The bodies lying in the Great Hall, their faces still and peaceful.
“All due respect, Chosen One, but you don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about.”
“Oh clearly!” Hermione said, her voice rising an octave. “You hooked up with him!”
He couldn’t help it. It had to be human blood; nothing else worked. He’d even tried a few rats, a deer, a bear. Nothing else satisfied him.
“But—” Harry shook his head. “Never mind.”
else that I would risk everything, burn, die for. And even if you don’t—
And he dreamed…
Hermione touched the back of his hand with hers, a gesture they’d gotten into after Ron left, a way of checking in with the other.
“There were fifteen of them.”
He felt Draco swallow, and a surge of warmth suffused his body.
as something landed on the mattress.
Harry shut the door and walked across the foyer to the kitchen, waving his wand at one of the kitchen barstools so that it slid out.  Harry put fresh water in the kettle and placed it back on the stove, then pointed his wand at it, listening to ensure that it had begun to heat. He heard Draco sit behind the bar, shuffling his chair so that it squeaked on the hardwood floor.
"I think that we aren't paid to sit around."
"Well, that was neat." Harry said.
dead? What if he’d severed the bond somehow? What if being connected to Draco Malfoy was
Hermione’s eye roll looked ludicrous on the waiter’s face. “Ha ha. She’s exuding magic. Bolton is strong as well, but her—"
Harry’s mouth was wide open, surprise and adoration lighting his eyes, and Draco knew that even the most magical photo would never capture the wonder blossoming inside his heart.
“Fat chance, Hermione,” Ron mumbled around a mouthful of kippers. “Malfoy’s a whiny little bitch, and always has been.” He took a massive swallow and continued. “I wouldn’t put it past him to finish his master’s little mission posthumously.”
Draco shook his head, willing his fangs back into his mouth. He stood. “If you all will excuse me,” He said. Good night, Professor, Harry.”
But how could his family be in danger? What could Draco be doing to help them? Even if they didn’t have the virus, Draco should know that his best option would be to stay away—
Draco casually withdrew his wand from his pocket, keeping his same nonchalant expression. “And how do you know that?”
It gets sappy and sweet here, and I'm not sorry at all for it. Thank you again to @tearinmyarc for editing ALL of this, even though we both thought it was gonna be like a quarter of the length it turned out to be.
As Harry watched, the stranger moved his wand in a complicated motion. The cowboy fell to his knees, clutching his throat. But then with a violent movement, he ripped a gash across the stranger’s face.
They sat there in silence for a while, but eventually Harry grew tired of checking Twitter for updates. It was the same pedantic messages from the same distressed politicians and power companies.
And he hated himself for feeling that way.
But Harry wasn’t concerned. He wasn’t afraid.
Draco shrugged. “He asked if I had any ‘party favors.’”
He eyed it for a half-second, then bit into it. It was delicious.
Harry exchanged glances with McGonagall, who simply rolled her eyes and said, “Enjoy the rest of your day, Potter,” jerking her head at Trelawney as if to say,
“Did she get torn apart by a wild animal? It would have been better to take her alive.” the American president asked.
He was stopped by a hand blocking his path through the hallway.  He ran into it, grunted.
Harry Potter would need a lot more before he walked away.
His dreams were haunted by dark green eyes, black hair, bright pink lips.
When would he stop feeling the cost of this war? When would he stop seeing all the lives he had interrupted, all the families he had torn apart?
It  painted a curious picture: Minerva McGonagall, the brightest witch of her Hogwarts class, looking for all the world like one of those Muggle pet fish.
Blaise was standing at the entrance, with red and blue lights flashing behind him. "We're evacuating y'all in case the pipes burst." He said. "Warming centers are gonna be the only places with power. But by all means,” he smirked. “Snuggle up."
"What's the problem with that?"
“Don’t they care about the quarantine?” Harry asked aloud.
When Harry next awoke, it was morning. He could hear birds chirping from outside the window.
Harry looked down the table to a group of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor first-years. They were typing away frantically on their phones, looking anxious. One of them coughed, and the others all jumped, looking around nervously.
The foyer was a wide expanse of pristine, elegant furniture, the floor white marble. Multiple adjoining hallways, as well as a spiral staircase, extended from the room.
How could they ever hope to survive?
“So these are the Muggles?” Draco asked.
“Of course I can.” Draco had started feeling the tug the moment they’d crossed into the state of Nevada, by the pilot’s designation. It felt like a string tied to his stomach, pulling him inexorably in the same direction. “He’s definitely that way.” Draco pointed to the West.
Harry had wanted it to stop.
more. Because I love you, Harry Potter. I think I’ve been in love with you since that very first day on the Hogwarts Express, and I tried so hard to run from it, because I knew it was going to be over for me. I knew the moment I kissed you for the first time, touched you—there is never going to be anyone else,
“—stronger whenever you fall in love.” Hermione finished. She sat across from him and put her elbows on the table. Up close, Draco could see that she was in pretty rough shape. There was a cut across her forearm, and the ‘Mudblood’ scar stood out sharply on her skin. Her eyes had dark circles beneath them, and he was pretty sure there was dirt and leaves matted in her hair.
references!” Hermione had turned bright red, and Draco grinned in triumph. “Stop trying to flirt with me!
Draco and Harry broke apart.
Wondering if it was possible to do the right thing when you were made to bring destruction.
He just wish he
A hand grabbed his chin, and he was suddenly staring into a pair of dark eyes, eyes that seemed to be glowing with an inner light, anchoring him, drowning him.
"Malfoy?" Blaise laughed. "Ignore him. He's been an ass to everyone since he got dumped by his girlfriend."
It really was laughable that Harry thought he could sneak up on Malfoy.
Those were the words with which Lucius Malfoy greeted his son, after not contacting him for months. In the middle of a pandemic.
“I’ve been in quarantine for over two weeks. If I had symptoms, I’d show them by now.”
He cried harder than he’d ever cried in his life.
“Of course not; it’s powerful. It’s part of the game. It obliterates, just like everything else. It defeats and is defeated, just like everything else. So why did you take yourself off the board, Potter? Why push everyone who loves you—
from someone who claimed to watch him toss back shots while choking back tears.
"I am
Harry was just starting to think that this job was...bearable. He got free drinks, and the customers were nicer than most. No one was yelling at him or telling him that he needed to make something of his life, and his coworkers were kind and outgoing and didn't seem all that gossipy. So what if he had a problem with one coworker? He could avoid him, and life would go on…
"Yes." Harry said. He let go of Draco’s chin and sat back.
It was easy to hide that you were miserable when you were by yourself.. Misery tended to rub off on people, and no one was interested in being depressed when they were finally getting to go outside, to see the Sun again.
And that's the way it was. Harry tried his best to be as kind as possible, going out of his way to do work without being asked, to never ask for anything, but none of it seemed to have an effect. Draco belittled him constantly, nitpicking every tiny detail. Harry folded the napkins incorrectly. He didn’t set out the mugs with the handles facing out. He packed the breakfast bar too slowly.  And, when he couldn't find something to criticize, Draco would just stand there, breathing deeply through his nose, until he finally muttered something about the restroom and stormed off.
If Hermione was dead, if he’d led his best friends into battle once again, only to have them killed? If another person had died for him…
At the funeral, Draco sat in the front row, his back straight, his blonde hair stark against his dark robes. And whenever Harry tried to talk to him, he turned to talk to someone else.
notice was quite an experience as well. Especially watching him as what Draco was doing to him tore him apart, as pleasure crossed the lines of his face, magnified because he had an audience, and Potter was a show-off if he was anything else…
“They were experimenting on Muggles,” Hermione argued. “There was nothing to indicate—”
And he was always up to something. Even now, he’d been all secretive and aloof whenever Harry had seen him. He was sure it had to be something Dark or dangerous, or both. When had Malfoy ever done something for the good of someone else?
Draco pasted a smile onto his face (he’d been practicing for months; you’d have to really know him to know that he didn’t mean it). He and Harry shook hands, both of them positively beaming. “Draco.” Potter said coolly, his deep green eyes expressionless, and bottomless.
?” Draco tried to push past Harry to the door, but Harry stepped in his path.
He’d waited to return to normal. Waited for that
“Potter.” Draco whispered softly. “Now I’m impressed.”
“He says he had a few friends investigating for MACUSA. All of them were following reports of disappeared Muggles. Authorities thought it was some kind of kidnapper. They tracked them to the desert, posing as a group of Muggle tourists. Is that a croissant?” Draco took a bite, then spat it out. “God, that’s revolting.” Hermione handed him the thermos, and he took a long sip before continuing.
“Jump them as soon as they get us out of our cell? Sounds good to me.”
Lucius took a step back, his eyes widening. “You’re—you’re—”
Hermione’s plan turned out to be casting a Tracking Charm on Malfoy’s book, which she’d managed to do while leaving for the loo. Malfoy, too distracted by Potter’s nosiness, hadn’t even noticed.
“Enough! Of course a filthy Muggle virus wouldn’t take hold of me,” Malfoy tried to move, but the spell held him fast. “Just clean me and let me go home.”
Draco’s wand leapt out of his hand. Harry leapt forward and caught it, returning it to Draco with a laugh.
He usually only came here at night, when the rest of the castle was asleep. He didn’t have an Invisibility Cloak like Potter’s, of course, but he could cast a Disillusionment Charm well enough. He’d been trying for days to find a way for the Room to make what he needed.
Everyone left after breakfast. He saw the mass exodus, a sea of black transported in carriages from the castle to where the train waited, from his vantage point atop the Owlery.
“What are you not telling me?”
have crossed. Unintentionally.”
McGonagall flicked her wand, and Malfoy felt himself able to move again, but her glare froze him all the same. “You aren’t going anywhere, Mr. Malfoy.”
“I’m sorry, I don’t follow.” Hermione said politely. “Who?”
Of course, watching Harry when he
Hermione rolled her eyes and grabbed him by the sleeve. “Come on.”
"So he's just a dick, then?" He ran a hand through his hair as Draco walked through the door, his aviators pushed back into his fine blond hair. He seemed to wear the black uniform like it was a personal charge to look as stylish as possible, and with his combat boots, he was pulling it off perfectly. The sunlight seemed to catch him as he walked into it, lending him a silvery glow. Harry felt his stomach drop.
“Does it have to be a wizard? Can you get blood from any human being?”
First, Draco had come down to the Great Hall to find that the House tables had been replaced by a single table in the middle.
He could even hear the
What if Potter
“No!” Harry shouted, snapping out of the compulsion.
Harry thought. No matter what McGonagall said, he considered it an absolute injustice that Malfoy wasn’t serving time in a jail cell right now.
Harry thought, his body crumpling with the weight of the grief, the misery, and the loneliness.
“There’s gotta be a way.” Harry said. He took Draco by the shoulder, guided him toward his bed. Draco must have been exhausted, because he crawled under the covers without a word of complaint. “Get some rest. I’ll think of something.”
Draco hated how his voice sounded, how lost and vulnerable. “You can’t tell anyone about this. Ever.”
Draco gulped. He knew what they were counting on. Draco Malfoy had always been a coward. He wouldn’t take any risks; he’d do anything to save his own skin.
“Well—you can’t stop me from seeing my parents. I’m seventeen!”
Draco stiffened, but said nothing.
He hadn’t even had a chance to say goodbye.
In answer, Harry finished unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, until he slid it off him and onto the floor. Through it all Draco barely moved a muscle, but Harry could feel his muscles trembling in restraint.
And it was Malfoy who had discovered the broken Vanishing Cabinet, Malfoy who had mended it and used it to let the Death Eaters into the school…
“Oh, look who’s—”
But he heard only the soft
“The vampire bond.” Harry said. “Hermione helped me make a potion to break it.”
“He would have shown you mercy if you’d told him it was me, back at your house.” Harry said. “And on the Tower—”
“Are you that bad at it?”
“Don’t you at least want to know what he’s reading?” Harry needled her. “I mean, what could interest Malfoy? What if it’s something you’ve never heard of?”
I'm really sorry for what's about to happen. I don't even know how to summarize this chapter, except that I was sad writing it, and you're gonna be sad reading it. Enjoy.
“You know what? I’m going to see when that waiter gets off.” Draco stood. “If you’ll excuse me.”
“He felt bad about it, you know.” Ariana spoke, startling Harry out of his reverie. She still had that quizzical half-smile on her face, and her wide, pale eyes contained a certain depth to them, the feeling that a very old person looked out of that child’s face. “Talked to me for quite some time about it, how he needed to go but hated that he was proving you right. How it was probably what he deserved, to be locked in here with you.”
His wand clattered to the floor.
“Is that—”
thanks again to @tearinmyarc for helping edit, especially since I keep writing on Benadryl, which makes me sleep-write nonsense.
Harry tapped the back of her knuckles.
“Better than nothing!” Harry held his arms out. “So is it just a matter of time? Am I going to wake up with your fangs in my throat?” He blushed.
It's Day 25, and things are getting even more serious for Harry and Draco. Draco's blood supply is low, and he can't figure out how to get more. Harry is convinced that Draco is up to something.
And maybe they were all each other really had left.
Part of him wanted to burn this whole building down.
The entire world could have burned around them, and the Malfoys only wanted to save each other.
“Fine.“ Harry sighed. “
Draco arrived two days before, and the connection had become thinner, tenuous. Vague sentiment, caught like the dissipating waves of the ocean as they rolled onto the shore. But it was still there. Draco could call it up when he wanted, just to see if Harry was okay. To see if what had been between them remained.
“You need to think of someone other than yourself, Mr. Malfoy. You will spend the night in your dormitory. The other Slytherins are being moved out and checked for exposure as we speak. We may be able to head off the virus with a few antiviral spells, as long as it has not taken hold in their systems—”
seemed anxious at first, but that could have been anything. He probably just hated being in Harry’s presence. Harry was pretty sure that they were allergic to each other. Having Malfoy’s eyes on him too much always made him itch. Even looking at his dot on the Marauder’s Map did it—like the hatred was yawning across their entire magical distance. He was so
“I’ll figure it out.”
“Air depressurization enchantments, the Bubble Head Charm—” Draco listed off his spells, knowing his father was impressed by the begrudging admiration gleaming on his face. He didn’t tell him that a regular human being probably wouldn’t have been able to withstand the conditions. Didn’t tell him that he hadn’t been sure if
Malfoy was so irritating. His hair always perfect, hands neatly manicured even though Harry
How could any other magic measure up to what was happening inside both of them this instant?
have upset them.”
“Oh, you’re expendable.” The cowboy tipped his hat. “Depend on it.”
And Harry was lonelier than ever.
They’d been able to handle the secret of Voldemort’s immortality. Harry was pretty sure they could deal with the spread of a virus.
Harry had arrived to see Lucius pacing the gate, shouting abuse at Draco. And then Draco had knelt before his father, his shoulders slumped in anguish. Lucius Malfoy’s face was etched in disgust.
"Can I ask you something?'
Draco took a drink.
Draco shot him a side glance, but said nothing, so Harry pressed on. "Why do you call me 'Potter'?"
“We need to go,” Hermione approached them, holding hands with Ron. “Once we get to the top, we should be able to Disapparate.”
explain it.
And Draco knew what she was going to say before she said it.
“Hundreds of years of lore would have me believe otherwise.”
“What makes you think you had to be a part of
After a few moments, Potter and McGonagall returned to their conversation, but Draco could still see Potter shooting him glances every few moments.
He certainly didn’t want Potter to know things like that, especially since—Potter ran a hand through his hair so that it got even more ruffled, and Draco’s mouth watered.
He didn’t know why he bothered. None of the teachers ever took any of his requests seriously.
There was disgust and hatred etched on Draco’s face, and a tenderness so whole and complete that Harry’s knees started to shake. “Potter,” he whispered, and his wand hand shook.
Before Ron could ask anything else, Hermione changed the subject, “Have you talked to Ginny lately?” she asked, a catch in her voice.
So far, he’d had no luck. Food was one of the five exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration, and apparently blood qualified as food.
He stopped. The lights were back on, but something had changed. The witch was floating above him, and her dress had changed. Instead of fabric that twisted, furling and unfurling in different panels and sheens, the dress had become a collection of serpents, writhing and reforming, collecting so that they slithered across the floor.
“I didn’t—”
Harry pulled out his Marauder’s Map. “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” he whispered, and waited as the map filled with ink.
“We’re working on a way for us to keep his magic from dissipating once he dies.” Bolton added. “The death of Harry Potter,” he whistled. “I’ve volunteered to do the honors, myself.”
How could you silence a beating heart?
“As I was saying.,” Hermione interrupted. “There is no way to permanently remove magic from someone without killing them, and no way for magic to exist once the person hosting it has died.”
And knowing that he was probably about to see Harry, they were even worse.
“Please, Professor.” Draco felt a tear escape and trickle down his cheek. “It might be my last chance to see them.
Careful to keep most of his body hidden, he practiced the movement he’d learned so long ago.
"Why?"
The man’s neck, covered in blood.
Draco slumped in his chair, defeated. “I need to see them.”
“Oh, you mean the paper you still haven’t started on?” Hermione said. “You could learn a thing or two from Malfoy.”
"You know what?" Draco said. He got to his feet and held out his hand to Harry. "Tell them." He linked his fingers with Harry's, and looked deeply into his eyes. "I don't care."
A chill went down Draco’s spine. “With corona virus?”
"I don't know--it just--fits you."
But instead, he just watched as Potter set his jaw and disappeared. He heard Potter’s footsteps as he tramped through the property, then a
“I don’t think it works like that,” Draco said, to buy himself time. He had been seeing things, feeling things—extreme weakness, the bleak walls of a cell, iron bars, bolts of pain, startling terror, a flash of light…. “I’m not channeling his spirit.”
He lowered his wand, but Harry didn’t step back. They faced each other, the two young wizards, who for all their differences, all the conflict that separated them, were now in exactly the same place…
And Harry could feel Draco, through the fog. He felt him like a secret, like a whisper in his ear and a chill down his spine. He could
“You’d get out of it! Always!” Harry was nearly shouting now, his green eyes narrowed in fury behind his glasses. “You find your way out of
"You call everyone else by their first name."
Harry wandered over to the stack of board games at the back. He ran his finger down the titles.
Harry did
Heart pounding, he pressed his body against the wall and turned the knob so that it swung open.
It's been months since the last time Draco and Harry saw each other at the party. Draco's an intern for Minister Shacklebolt, and Harry is an Auror with Ron and Hermione. Feat. way too many Twilight references, because it's just too funny. Hermione being the only useful member of the golden trio.
“That’s what I’m saying!” Harry protested, his voice at a normal volume now. “Voldemort’s dead, we’re all back at Hogwarts, and he’s still on. The same.
“I thought our goal was to maintain a pureblood society.” Draco added. “Why create more people who can’t do magic?”
But Bellatrix only laughed, that laugh turning into a snarl as she spotted more enemies ahead.
“He loves you.”
the touch said.
And Draco moved, so quickly that even Harry Potter, one of the greatest wizards that had ever lived, didn’t have time to react.
They took our
“I’m not wearing the lip ring.”
There were so many other things Harry wanted to say, things he wanted to do. He wanted to never leave this moment, to keep Draco
“My brother had a fascination with mastering Death.” She said. “As did your old master. Do I need to tell you how it ended for them? The only true master of Death lies unconscious behind you, a master because he chose not to cheat Death. Because he accepted it with open arms, and did not try to go against nature--”
Hermione ran a hand through her hair. “And I don’t want to call on the other Aurors for backup, since—”
Harry shook his head. “No, nothing like that. I’m just—tired.”
“But that’s impossible.”
"It's gonna be a rough night, folks."  the anchorwoman was saying, gesturing to the numbers on the screen. "The governor has issued a state of emergency, and all the major roads are closed to all but essential traffic. There have been a number of accidents and deaths already." She looked directly into the camera. "Stay home. It's not worth your life."
Draco thought.
Harry wondered if he would die like this, if Draco had planned this, a way to finally kill the famous Harry Potter.  “Draco—” he whispered, trying to tell him that he was passing out, but he couldn’t say anything more. The world was turning fuzzy at the edges, and Draco was still drinking and drinking like he would never stop.
But Harry didn’t have much time to speculate. He could feel the tension building, catching along his spine and spreading outward.
Harry frowned. Malfoy usually would have taken care to hide such obvious marks of his passing. Did he
As if being called ‘The Chosen One’ wasn’t enough.
“The prisoners who have successfully transferred their magic.”
“Father and I have work to do. Don’t you have ‘
It was almost like being in quarantine again, except now he didn’t have to sneak out to clubs, and he could take whatever unsuspecting victim he wanted home. He could try to use them to fill the void Potter had left, and if they had to take a Blood Replenishing Potion after, so be it.
Malfoy’s lip curled. “I know I can. I am something you’re not, that you’ll never be.”
Draco nodded. “You aren’t sure. But I can’t deny what I am.”
It never mattered to him how to Heal. He knew he would only ever be good for the opposite.
“And what’s that? A vampire?” Potter cast a curse, and Malfoy swept it aside easily.
“Did you fall asleep holding hands?” Hermione sneered. “With
“What did they—
Harry shrugged. “I just have to keep it up ‘til graduation. We can go back to hating each other after that.”
It didn’t matter if Harry would never forgive him. It didn’t matter if Draco became a monster, crossed that invisible line he’d been toeing ever since Harry left.
"Oh." Harry felt his cheeks burn. "Sorry."
He left the office before Percy could utter another word. He’d probably suggest that Draco send one of those infernal memos, but Draco preferred to be out of the office, away from Weasley’s accusing gaze.
“But wait!” Dijikstra said, grinning. “Isn’t there someone you’d like to see first?”
“Then I’m ready when you are.”
"Better safe than sorry.”
“What took you so long?” Hermione hissed as Draco finally stumbled back through the doors, his shirt askew and his hair mussed.
His father didn’t leave her side, didn’t say a word to Draco. Just kept her thin hand between his own, watching her every breath and movement like he was afraid they were her last.
Hermione’s phone dinged, and she swiped across to check it. “Corona virus has spread to the UK” she said aloud. “Well, we already knew that.”
Harry looked at him for a long moment, then lowered his wand. He sat on the bed and crossed his arms. “So?”
“I can save her,” Draco saw hope, a ray of light, cross the wasteland of his father’s face. “Father. I can, trust me.”
Draco looked over at him, frowning, as though he had forgotten he was there. "Come inside. There's no way anyone should be on the road right now."
Harry whispered, holding his wand above his head as he entered the Hog’s Head. Aberforth must be traveling, he’d taken to doing that often since his brother’s death. Harry suspected that he frequented Godric’s Hollow often, the place where he’d lost Ariana, where Dumbledore and Grindelwald had plotted the destruction of the world; where, for all his efforts to protect Ariana and his mother, his family had been shattered.
Harry and Malfoy sat, neither looking at the other.
"That's not what I asked.  You walk out of every room I walk into. Unless there's a blizzard, you'd do anything to get away from me. I just--is it something I did? Is there a
would come on too strong. And he wasn't sure exactly what was happening between the two of them, only that the cafe seemed a lot hotter, and Draco's eyes were wide and glistening, and there was a little tracery of veins along his neck that Harry could see even now, and he had a sudden urge to run his lips along them, to feel where the blood pulsed---
“I thought that was the point. Come roaring in, spells blazing. Blast them the fuck out of there.”
Harry drank, and something about the rush of the alcohol, and the way Draco's eyes were still glittering, the splay of those hands against the red velvet, gave him the courage to do what he did next.
“If you’d just listen,” Draco said aloud. “Maybe you wouldn’t always try to stop me.”
“Good. Mr. Potter?”
Which I’m surprised they even let us have.”  Ron muttered. “After all this madness.”
He arrived before Harry, his hands delicately behind his back so as to hide their shaking. “You ready for this?” Draco whispered
“I don’t think he can save her,” Harry said. “But he has to try. If he doesn’t try—he’ll never be able to live with himself.”
“I know what you are.” She said.
Once upon a time, Draco would have done everything he could to prove he was worthy of Shacklebolt’s trust. He’d be driven by his desire to succeed, to rise to Minster, to make his father and his family proud. Draco would have fought to be included in those meetings, the ones that everyone pretended didn’t exist, where power changed hands like a daring, intricate chess game. Draco knew those meetings took place, knew by the smug looks Percy shot him whenever he was invited to one, while Draco had to wait in the hall.
"Can I ask you something?" Harry asked over the laugh track.
Pansy sighed with exasperation. “You’re off your face. Excuse him,” she said to Draco. “Why don’t you come out on the balcony with me? We can have a drink.” One of her hands slid its way up Draco’s arm, lingering on his muscled bicep. “Or maybe a few drinks.”
Narcissa who had made sure that Voldemort didn’t know his curse had failed a second time; Narcissa who had enabled Harry to leap free, to face Voldemort and destroy him, once and for all.
It almost felt like they were becoming friends.
Draco laughed and pushed the bottle back over to Harry. "Touché."
“Don’t you?”
He even would have been happy with the night guy, Travis, who always smelled like Cheetos and called women 'females'.
“Shh.” Draco sat across from her and started adjusting his shirt. “I didn’t hook up with him; I just had to get him alone. Turns out he’s a wizard.”
“Ron.” He choked out.
Draco tensed, as though he were about to strike. Harry didn’t flinch.
But it was gone. He felt only a slight twinge at the idea that Ginny might have moved on, and he couldn’t figure out what it was—regret? Remorse?
“I think that he would understand more than a lot of people.” Ariana said. “Why don’t you ask him?’
Before Harry could ask anything else, she disappeared back through the door.
“Good. I will bring technology for communication with your parents shortly.”
“I know.”
Draco. You know I wouldn’t ask if I wasn’t desperate. “
His owls to Draco still went unanswered.
With increasing frequency, that victim had black hair and bright green eyes…
Draco drew back, gasping, a spot of red dotting his white collared shirt, now with several of the buttons undone.
But Draco had already disappeared through the door, back down the velvet-lined staircase to the foyer below. He should have known that this party was a mistake, shouldn’t have allowed his father to talk him into it.
Draco stared at the water, his hands clasped behind his back, letting the dull trickle of the fountain soothe him. He couldn’t hear anything but the fountain. Not the clamors of his relatives. Not the eager references to his mother’s fortune, the snide whispers about the suspicious nature of her death (
"Whatever. Come on." Draco handed him a lighter and gestured to the candles arrayed about the shop. "Light these. Then do me a favor and close the blinds.”
in America.’” Draco finished. “It’s ‘classified.’ I thought Kingsley weeded out all the traitors. How
Americans were so easy.
At that, Hermione looked up from her book, wincing. “Harry
“No it wasn’t. It was for all of us. For a better future.” Ron repeated the words his therapist had taught him with the same monotone voice Harry had come to recognize.
Draco started down the stairs first, hurrying so that he was several steps ahead of the others. The staircase descended through the center of an opulent lounge. Golden carpeting adorned the floors, and the walls had tasteful, elegant paintings of wizards and magical creatures. The figures in the paintings blinked at him sedately as he descended, seemingly unbothered by his presence.
Apparently, his mother’s condition was genetic, so they thought he might develop symptoms, especially if he was exposed to her. Something about magical immune systems and the transfer of antibodies, other jargon Malfoy never bothered to listen to.
“And now?” Draco asked.
Harry remembered his parents as they’d appeared in that graveyard. During third year, when he’d secretly wanted to the dementor to stay longer, just to hear his mother’s voice—
“I don’t mind, really.” Harry said. “If it’s the only thing to keep you alive. I said I’d help you—”
It could never happen again.
In this part of Texas, snow was a fairytale: far-fetched and fantastic. Everyone spoke about the snow in hushed tones, as though speaking about it too much would scare the winter miracle away. People told stories about how the air smelled different, of were children on toboggans, the whole world was at a standstill.
“Don’t you? Vampire blood can heal, after all. Perhaps a dose of yours will cure your mother’s condition. Perhaps, were she to die with your blood in her system, she would be able to join you forever—”
What if this was part of a plot to bring back the Death Eaters?
Ariana sighed. “Sometimes we can’t accept the things that are most obvious to us. Albus certainly knew that.”
"Do you want me to clock in first, or--"
“Why?”
“I’m shocked, Granger! You stole blood!” Draco wagged the thermos at her. “How could you? Lives could be lost—"
“You don’t know
“So you’re pushing me away because you’re afraid.”
Draco didn’t want to stop. He didn’t think he ever could stop.
“And never mind that it compromised anyone else, right?” Ron snorted. ‘Typical Malfoy.”
The door to Harry’s apartment was decorated with a Halloween wreath and a roaring lion. Draco snorted,
Okay, so I actually am sure that there's 13 chapters now. Well, 12 chapters and an epilogue, because I've drafted everything. Yay!
“You have to mean it, Potter!” Draco hissed. “And I
“I have a boyfriend!”
“Harry.” Ron whispered weakly. “I don’t feel so good.”
Then, she’d ordered him a ginger ale.
It Is What It Is by Mayday Parade
Perhaps one day, when they finally got married, they’d be so enamored with each other that they wouldn’t stop to wonder about him at all…
Malfoy thought, remembering that day in the bathroom, the blood that had burst across his chest and abdomen, Potter’s hands scrabbling desperately at his shirt. “
“I think I understand quite well,” Draco sneered. “You wanted—
Draco’s body gave a little shake, as through throwing off a blow. “You asked her to.”
When he'd opened the door and found the cafe dark and Draco sitting with his arms crossed at one of the tables, his heart sank.
a voice said.
“Where’s your wand?”
“Well, not permanently. Magic doesn’t work against its original wizard, and it diminishes the longer its away from its host. But I’m hoping to eliminate that.”
He hadn’t been able to fall asleep; the newfound nourishment was coursing through his veins, giving him a burst of energy.
It wasn’t until Malfoy actually started walking along the seventh floor corridor that Harry realized it.
"I made hot chocolate. Do you want some?" Harry held up a mug, already topped with whipped cream and peppermint shavings.
He pulled out the map of Vegas that Hermione had foisted upon him as soon as he agreed to the endeavor. “Do you have
“That’s a good thing, right?” Draco protested, “We want to make sure none of this is traced back to him!”
Draco dropped the ball. Harry could see his shoulders tense beneath his shirt. “Don’t fuck with me, Potter. It’s beneath you.”
Draco squirmed in his seat, trying to get comfortable. He couldn’t understand why Muggles paid so much money for these things. If this was the standard mode of travel, he’d simply never go anywhere.
“You know your mother wouldn’t want that.” Lucius broke in, his voice twisted in anguish. “To become—”
Of course, McGonagall’s
at home.”
"Took you long enough," Draco said. "I'm heading out."
Hermione picked up one of the hairs and held it to the light. “And I assume they know me too well for me not to be disguised?”
He didn’t know how right he was.
"Okay, but can you press pause on the gooey shit? You're making the first responders uncomfortable.”
There was no way magic would help him escape.
“Or me,” Hermione interrupted.
he’d said.
“Professor, if I might have a word?” Malfoy looked curiously flushed, his eyes bright in the light. “I have a request to make of you.”
transfusion, and our powers have only increased. They show no signs of diminishing.”
Harry rolled his eyes and locked his phone. It only had 50% battery, and he hadn't brought a charger, either.
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?”  Harry put his hands on his hips. “You may as well tell me.”
“You could learn a thing or two from Greyback,” she chortled when she found him, guzzling at the neck of one of the Death Eaters, their blood staining the front of his collar. “He knows how to kill without being too messy.” She flicked her wand, and the body slumped against him, dead.
Draco straightened his tie and shot a smug look over at Hermione. They both wore silk, three-piece suits. While Hermione had opted for the simpler, black option (they’d had to guess at the waiter’s measurements, and she’d already been about to murder Draco for how long he’d been spending in the shop), Draco was bedecked in a brilliant blue and gray floral suit that set off his coloring perfectly and made his eyes nearly glow in the setting sun.
“Speak up, Potter.”
Draco could tell by his tone that it had better
of air as the snake’s fangs nearly missed him.
“As long as it takes, Mr. Malfoy. And watch your language!” McGonagall replied.
And then she was gone, disappearing back up the staircase. Draco heard the stomp of boots on stone, then silence.
Harry said something else, but Draco didn’t hear it. He was already fast asleep.
McGonagall seemed to have guessed the nature of Harry’s thoughts, because she gave a deep sigh before continuing. “You could do a great deal more good if you worked together. The war is over, and we are on the same side. Are we not, Mr. Malfoy?”
He shook his head. “Don’t lecture me about death, Potter.” He spat. “I know more—I know enough—”
Draco was the first to look away.
“You took magic from pureblood wizards?”
“I remember everything that happened between us, Malfoy.” Harry’s eyes were suddenly that near-glowing green again, and Draco felt curiously vulnerable as he walked over to the bench, towering over him. “I remember every second.”
“So what’s the plan when we get there?”
“Stop. I know that something—happened between you and Harry.”
“He’s late,” Harry paced anxiously around the Atrium, leading to not a few camera flashes from the assembled press, as well as a sympathetic glance from Hermione. “We were supposed to make our statement at seven. It’s seven thirty.”
Harry whispered.
“GET OUT.” Draco screamed. “LEAVE US ALONE. YOU DID THIS. YOU—I’LL KILL YOU! I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY POTTER.”
He rolled over to look at Malfoy. He was sleeping on his stomach, his head nearly hanging over the side nearest Harry, one leg dangling off the other.
“You’re just upset because I’m better than you!” Ron smirked, directing one of his knights to begin beating up Harry’s bishop.
“Who are they?” Draco gestured to a set of cells pressed against the back wall. These cells lacked the light and minimal warmth of the others, and indeed, Draco saw quite a few of the prisoners shivering under their blankets.
It didn’t matter. Draco saw it in his eyes.
“How do you know about all that?”
Draco snorted. "Yeah. They are."
And he wasn’t descending into the dungeons, either.
The animosity between them had been absolute from the first day, when Harry had arrived for his first real shift at the café. He’d found Draco rifling through the breakfast bar, meticulously lining up the napkins and arranging the straws.
"Are you talking about Anna?'
Draco Malfoy was finally the monster he always knew he’d be.
raised by Muggles.”
Harry did so, then sat back down on the couch. Draco opened the ottoman in front of it and pulled out a few blankets, throwing them over the both of them.
Draco stopped. “What in Merlin’s name are you talking about, Potter?” his voice was harsh, ugly. Harry’s heart splintered. He had hurt him. Wounded him, by severing their bond. By allowing him to wake up in the middle of the night, not knowing if Harry was dead…Not knowing what had broken, only that
“Get on your dress robes,” Lucius had appeared at his bedroom door in a shimmer of silk and velvet, his sleek hair brushed and bound back in a ribbon, his silver-topped cane setting off his aura of elegance. “We’re going to your graduation party.”
“Look.” Draco dropped his wand, letting it roll on the floor over to the corner. “I’m unarmed. I’m not trying to attack you.”
The connection snapped apart like a bone breaking.
magic.”
“Do not repeat that drivel at me. You and I both know that there are this virus does not distinguish between Muggles and wizards. Many purebloods have already fallen ill. I will not let your arrogance—”
Harry snapped out of his trance and dropped too, feeling desperately for a pulse. “What the Hell—what did you—” his hands scrabbled at the man’s neck, but they were covered in something warm, something with a rusty, salty smell.
"Come on!" Harry's eyes met Draco's, then he looked away. "That's not fair."
"At least." Draco said grimly.
Madame Dijikstra and Mr. Bolton shared a conspiratorial glance. “The biggest threat to a pureblood society are Muggleborns,” Dijikstra began. As she spoke, she paced back and forth in front of the doorway, like a professor at lecture. “Thieves of our magic, there are more and more of them each generation. They dilute the bloodlines of even the most pure wizarding families, threatening the sanctity of our way of life and that of magic itself. And where do these Muggleborns come from?”
“--I know it,” Hermione finished. “Just let it go, Harry. Worry about you.”
"I'm an English major. Legally, I'm not allowed to
"I don't know what else you could possibly want to know about me."
“Oh, we’ve been down this road before,” Hermione rolled her eyes, then cast them up and down Ron’s form appreciatively. “Nothing I haven’t seen before, anyway.”
Keep up the Kudos-ing and Commenting, please. It's my only contact to the outside world.
Still. This
Potter had looked.
He hadn’t even looked disappointed when, after Hermione had heard that Ron was going off with his family, she’d tentatively stated that she wanted a holiday away with her parents as well. “We always wanted to go to Italy as a family,” she’d said, “We’ve never been. Now seems like a good time, since—”
Draco stopped for a moment to lick at some of the blood that had trickled down Harry’s neck, the movement causing him to grind against Harry just enough for Harry’s orgasm to burst through the surface, crashing through his consciousness, wave after wave, until he was trembling in Draco’s arms, “Let it out,” Draco hissed through it, in between long drinks from his neck. “Let go, I’ve got you.”
—on any actual magic users?”
“You cannot. For once in your life, Potter,
But now, all Draco was aware of was Zabini’s ignorance of his mother’s passing. How could someone be insensitive to an event that shook the entire Earth, that rearranged the atoms of Draco’s body? How could he be so cavalier about such a catastrophe?
“You’re staring.”
But Harry couldn’t freeze Draco out; he was too bored.
And the office did have small changes. There was the portrait of Dumbledore, snoozing delicately in a high-backed chair. The Order of Merlin, First Class, which Minister Shacklebolt had bestowed upon McGonagall for her courage at the Battle of Hogwarts (McGonagall never polished it; she had been so disgusted with the Ministry’s initial response to Voldemort’s return that Kingsley had to practically beg her to accept it in the first place), the Sword of Gryffindor in its crystal case, and a few portraits of cats that gamboled about good-naturedly, hunting various squirrels and birds through the paintings, the antithesis of the sicky sweet kittens that had adorned Umbridge’s office.
He’d gripped the seat and closed his eyes, feeling the ground drop out from beneath him. The ground grew smaller and smaller below, until the plane reached ‘cruising altitude’ above the clouds.
"I thought you were calling me 'Harry' now,"
He spent the whole flight in fear, his mind racing ahead. He was terrified that Malfoy had already tried to cure his mother, possibly infecting everyone around himself in the process. Terrified that his father had attacked and killed him, because the Malfoy family didn’t abide nasty half-breeds.
have a dark side. I was just beginning to think you were boring."
Draco sat up so fast, he got dizzy. “Are you asking if I fancy you?”
Draco was silent for a moment, his head whirling. Was that what had been going on this entire time? Had he loved Harry Potter from the beginning, from that first day on the Hogwarts Express?
But Hermione was unfazed. “Honestly, don’t you lot read? She took the rod, holding the gem up to the light so that it sparkled.. “A magical siphon is not a revolutionary concept. Dark wizards have been attempting it for centuries—there are even rumors that Niccolo Machiavellli used it to siphon power from wizards who threatened him.”
He wished he’d tried to listen more, slept a little more convincingly before McGonagall had cast
He wasn’t sure how long he could keep this up. Alone, the sadness overtook him again, a cold hand wrapped around his stomach, reaching up into his throat.
His father blinked, and the darkness descended again. He crossed his arms. “How?”
“Professor, I am concerned about the virus. With my mother’s illness—”
He’d gone to Lucius to see if they needed help, but Mr. Malfoy had already contacted McGonagall, who was absolutely livid that Harry had flouted the rules.
“A fair few.”
He made his way through the crowd as Malfoy’s lips moved against the man’s neck, his blonde hair streaked with sweat. He was wearing a silk dressing gown over his pajamas, but he made it look elegant and sensual as he reached up to pull the other man closer.
Draco’s Patronus had been weak and sputtering, and it didn’t really have a corporeal form. It was some smallish, canine-like animal, but it was hard to tell what it was exactly.
Harry shouldn't have come into work. Sure, the café was open, but it was
Malfoy always sounded so smug, so convinced that he was superior just for never bothering to come after Harry.
They played in silence for a while, but it was clear that Draco was better at the game than Harry. Finally, when Draco took his inevitable checkmate, Harry said. "Do you want to ask me anything?"
“It’s the safest way to travel long distance,” Hermione said patiently. “No wizard would expect us to use Muggle transportation.”
. For other people, love saves. Love is connection and happiness. Love is a lifeline. But for you,” he pressed his lips against Harry’s neck, his fangs only pulling at the surface of his skin, still not breaking it. “For you, those who love you only get the bad end. When they’re too close, they burn up. Better to be far away, and bathe in the light of having known you, having been near the Chosen One, but not close enough for it to hurt, to burn—”  He pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s throat, hardly able to believe what he was doing. “I know it, Harry. I know it all too well.” He held his fangs an inch from Harry’s skin, and the other boy trembled, but he didn’t move.
Harry’s heart twisted at the anguish in his voice.
He’d told the press some bullshit story about how he and Draco had ‘mended their fences’ together as quarantine buddies, and then he’d
Malfoy got up, grinding his teeth.
Draco wrinkled his nose. "I'd rather eat glass."
, Harry Potter, and I saved your friends. You
And the door swung open…
Draco certainly wasn’t going to tell him what he thought his Patronus resembled.
Harry leaned in close, and Draco brought his lips up to Harry’s within a heartbeat, his fangs already lengthening, lust and hunger thrumming through his veins. Their lips were a hairsbreadth from meeting—
“It’s 7PM.” Harry said, just as McGonagall replied, “Sleep well, Mr. Malfoy.”
“Harry? Are you even listening to me?” Ron poked him with his wand.
“Technically, you’re already dead.”

So they ended up moving the television to the middle of the room, where Harry conjured a couch. Draco pulled over a few blankets from his side (adorned in Slytherin colors, of course) and they took up their opposite ends with a businesslike attitude, barely speaking except when Draco asked questions; he was behind, and he refused to catch up on his own.
But his dreams had been featuring Draco a lot lately. In a way that made Harry devoutly thankful that Draco was not an accomplished Legilimens.
Harry limped inside, resting his bike against the wall just on the inside of the door. In spite of Draco’s hostility, he was somewhat grateful for delaying the inevitable trek in the snow. It was
There had been a chance of snow this weekend, but Harry hadn’t taken it seriously. The forecasters said it might snow nearly every winter, and they were always wrong. Nothing like that was going to happen, especially in Texas.
Harry stared at the dot of Draco in the Slytherin dormitories, wondering if Draco could feel him watching, wishing he was a better Legilimens.
“We’re going to break out of here,” Harry got to his feet and looked around the cell, swaying a little as he did so. He felt dizzy and weak, and his heart seemed to flutter in his chest. “There’s got to be a way. Come on, help me.” He ran his hand along the iron bars and the solid stone wall, hoping for some jolt of electricity, a buzz of another presence. Some indication that his magic had not entirely deserted him.
