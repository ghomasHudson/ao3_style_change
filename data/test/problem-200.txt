Ah... it's Cedric's voice. Draco turned his face so he could see Cedric. The prince was standing not far from him. "Is that wrong, Prince Cedric?" Draco asked, raising his eyebrows.
"I'll keep that in mind," Draco agreed warily. Even a short walk in the forest of Olympus was already dangerous for him. He wouldn't want to go near Hades at all. Moreover, the title of the God of Death sounded more terrifying than the God of War.
"No," Draco replied curtly, which allowed Harry to breathe a sigh of relief. They danced again gracefully and elegantly.
"Yeah, it's just a name, and maybe everyone in the future will remember it as a rebel and a traitor," Terence said with a crooked smile.
Draco's soul was shaken. Where was the face he has known since birth? Draco saw another man in the mirror, who, although maybe a little more handsome than Draco, was not Draco!
Draco looked to his left and found a large golden door. Curiously, he opened the door handle. It seemed difficult and stuck, but then after Draco tried a few times, the door opened easily, with a creaking sound from the hinges that hadn't been oiled in a long time.
"Send me back," Draco said quietly. Harry just stared at him without moving. "I'll never love you, Potter. Get me home quickly," he added.
He threw the glass bottle vigorously at a rock in front of him. It didn't take long, the clear liquid that filled the bottle had now spilled over the stone and the grass beneath it.
Harry said nothing and disappeared from the streets. Draco was still breathing hard. Because of that incident, he decided to return home, in case other creatures chased him. Draco's martial arts skills should have been useful, but it would be better for him to run first and dodge rather than pay attention to the immortal being.
After that brief conversation, Cedric and Draco's journey was decorated with joking laughter until the sound of galloping horses made Draco's laughter instantly disappear.
Draco felt the horse he was riding slightly galloping away from the other Titans. Attica did it on purpose when she wanted to talk privately.
Draco was still afraid to look into War God's face and just nodded silently. That man was very close to him. His masculine body scent smelled faint, almost breaking Draco's focus. It looks like Ares uses a mixture of musk and sandalwood essential oil.
"You sound emotional, Ares. Do you still hold a grudge against me since the Trojan war, where Diomedes managed to injure you so badly?" Athena purposely annoyed Ares.
When the restaurant's head chef left, Harry pulled Draco a chair and then sat in front of Draco. "This restaurant belongs to my mother," Harry watched the head of the restaurant leave. "Luna is my mother's assistant for a long time. She loves this restaurant as much as she loves her life."
Hector also started his approach the wrong way. He threatened any man known to be interested in the blonde prince. He wanted to make sure he was a prime candidate for Troya's future spouse should the king change his mind and allow his son to marry. For the sake of his goal, Hector survives single life to wait for Troya. Troya walked side by side with his servant but felt his neck ache as Hector watched him intently behind him.
“Master Harry married in Italy when he graduated from college, at the age of 20. They are a young couple who love each other. As far as I know, master Harry loves his wife very much," Alden cleared his throat. "I had already started working for master Harry by then. In the past, She was a good person, very easy-going and friendly, but… Mrs. Seraphina was indeed weak from the start. She has heart disease with an imperfect valve." Alden took a deep breath as if trying to muster up the strength to tell a story.
Seeing Harry starting to be provoked by emotion, Draco's hand moved to caress Harry's muscular arm that he could reach gently. He hoped the soft touch could reduce Harry's sentiments.
"Someone once said," said the man after standing in front of Draco. His beautiful amber eyes were able to hypnotize Draco. "Flowers don't worry about how they will bloom. Flowers just bloom and turn toward the light..." He smiled. "And it makes them beautiful,"
And he's sure, someday Draco will realize that there is still Cedric who wants to love him with all his heart, take care of him, and make him the happiest person on earth.
"Maybe yes," Luna paused, she stared at Draco. "Look, Dray, his appearance wasn't just a coincidence. You have to make him take side with the angels. Because if you don't, I can't help you save humans."
Doctor Jason looked flabbergasted by Harry's unexpected movements, he tried to pull the knife out of Harry's clutch, but Harry pulled the knife and threw it away.
Harry squinted at Draco with an accusing look. "Oh, yeah? Earlier, you have swept away in my kiss, your lips hot and soft for me, ready to accept me."
"I heard Harry asked her to live together, just imagine! There isn't a single woman Harry has ever invited to live with. I thought she was a gorgeous woman! It turns out she was just average. Maybe Harry was drunk when he brought her with him."
Several people then laughed as someone refuted Draco's answer. "Have you seen them?" he asked with a laugh.
Especially when her eyes fell upon Draco's green dress, which now sat like trash on the floor, Daphne would sigh dramatically, then grumble again in vague words. Luckily Daphne had a spare dress with her. Although not quite as fancy and beautiful as the green one Harry had torn up, it was a pretty good dress. It is maroon color and simple cut, perfectly wrapping Draco's body.
Harry's eyes also moved to scan Draco's current appearance. It does not reflect the figure of a Queen who all the people of all kingdoms have glorified.
"They know that you love prince Troya very much. If you lose him, our country will be weak," One theorized.
"What are you really doing? Just daydreaming?" Draco asked, finally questioning the reason why they were here, doing nothing, not saying anything.
7. Glamour or 'charm hood' is the power that all mythical creatures have to hide their original appearance from humans. Still, only Harry can use Double Glamour that cannot be seen by humans and mythical beings, except by Draco.
Draco sat down and took out his lunchbox when a group of vampire girls approached him. They sat in front and next to Draco while watching him open lunchboxes. The scent of onions was powerful from the delicious food. His mother made it for him. Narcissa knew that Draco really liked onions. Because of that, she added quite a lot of onions.
Draco dug into Troya's memories of Hector again. The man had been his personal bodyguard when he was just starting his career in the military. He was four years older than Troya, and even though he only had the occasional chance to look after Troya—Hector always bothered him.
Draco had to put a lot of effort into chewing the food. The meat was tough and spiced to the point, but the people around him seemed to enjoy eating it. Draco felt full quickly. The whole meal was utterly different from what he used to eat during his life as Draco Malfoy. Draco was a food expert. No matter how busy he was as an actor, he makes sure his tongue only tastes good quality food. The long-haired beauty often cooks by himself and makes cooking his hobby.
Darco glared at him, but he didn't say anything before moving into the bathroom, limping. He made sure to close the door behind him, although he was annoyed to see no lock. He stepped into the shower quickly, sighing contentedly as hot water traveled down his body, sore from head to toe.
Ares doesn't employ human servants at all. The few Demigods were also mainly used as knights. The majority of Demigods served Ares because he was the most capable god to make them formidable warriors.
Quickly the man grabbed Draco's shoulder, and at that moment, Draco realized that he would kiss him. As soon as he could, he looked away, trying to struggle, until Harry's lips just landed on his temple, and the man's grip on his shoulder grew so intense, it hurt.
"I'll go first. If there is anything, I'm at home. My house is close to here, just go straight, then turn to the left. My house has no fences. Please stop by later at my house."
"Yes. You did it." There was a smile on Harry's voice, “With great enthusiasm and hunger. I just lay there, and you eat me whole, all night."
Draco silently prayed. Sadly, it seemed that God still wanted Harry alive because the man seemed uninterested in touching his drink. Instead, his eyes fell on Draco and glared at him.
"Aren't you happy here, Draco?" Harry moved closer to the bed and touched Draco's chin with his fingers. That's when Draco saw Harry's palms wrapped in bandages. “I fulfill your needs. I give you what you cannot buy with your own money. Don't you think that's enough?"
"Hey!" Draco tried to pull his hand from Harry's grip. "What the hell are you doing?! Didn't you say I could take a walk in the garden?! Why are you forbidding me now?!" Draco asked incredulously.
How does he know? Draco thought. But Draco should have known that Harry must know about it, considering that he is always everywhere.
Draco finally started to give up and surrender — placing his little cute head on one of the man's shoulders, while Harry was still busy reading thick fantasy books and acted as if he hadn't had Draco on his lap all this time.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief. Finally, all of this would end quickly before even the ten days Harry had set. He won't have anything to do with Harry, or perhaps Icarus again, considering Icarus appears while Harry also appears. If he was Draco's guardian angel, he shouldn't have just appeared when Harry appeared, so Draco doesn't trust Icarus. Everything feels strange to him.
After savoring the rain, Draco went into his room to change clothes and have dinner. He didn't meet Harry on purpose. After all, it seemed that the man was just bluffing when he said he wanted to talk about Draco's birthday. And Draco wasn't sure Harry would be waiting for him. Harry seems quite busy and has a lot of work.
Ah, thinking about Arabelle made Harry want to leave this room and quickly go straight to his mistress. But before that, Harry had to confirm one thing.
"Whatever, you shower here with me, or if you prefer to challenge me, we could end up having great sex in the bathroom. Now please scrub my back with soap,” Harry took off his pants, snickering again when Draco immediately glanced away, not wanting to look.
"I'm very happy that Your Majesty showed me his concern. Your Majesty doesn't need to worry. After this dance, I'm going straight back to the Richmond manor." Charles's words were met with a faint nod from Draco.
He’s angry and upset. He wanted to whack Cedric's hand away, but his common sense made him have to suppress the crazy thoughts that were filling his brain at this moment. After all, Cedric was his relative, and he's sure he wouldn't dare take Draco away from his brother.
The sword behind his back looks scary. It was as if he was waiting for war and was ready to face it. Draco remembered what Luna said yesterday about the prophecy of Armageddon. But he wasn't sure. Draco wasn't even sure what he was getting into right now.
Actually, Draco himself was confused by himself. Part of his heart hates Vlad, but partly wants him.
Who could have guessed, a young man as perfect as Draco read a vulgar book? Really, Harry felt like laughing.
"When it comes to Ares, I know him very well. He always treats his lovers sweetly and pampers them. I have some doubts about your complaints. What happened?"
Their stubbornness was not just out of love or desire. But also their form of resistance to Zeus' arbitrariness. Aphrodite still holds grudges for being forced to marry Hephaestus. Ares also feels that his parents always feel neglected and belittled.
"Thanks, Draco." Hermione touched Ron's arm gently, turning Ron's seemingly inseparable attention to Draco. "Ron, this is Draco," muttered Hermione softly.
Draco awkwardly blinked a few times when he heard Harry's command that sounded undeniable. Draco didn't want to be ruled by anyone! He will only follow orders that come from within himself.
"Now, put on these shoes." Daphne put a pretty gold shoe on the carpet. "Then I'll walk you down. Mr. Potter is waiting downstairs because the party's getting started."
"I used to cook for some of my sisters in Sparta, only in certain neighborhoods. No wonder you've never seen this before," Draco reasoned. He was pretty pounding at the moment because maybe he had gone too far in preparing the dinner this time. He shouldn't have forgotten that the fact that he came from the future shouldn't be known to anyone.
"His Majesty was injured while he was practicing swordsmanship with Prince Cedric. That... A sword scratched His Majesty's neck."
"Good evening, Your Majesty," Draco said politely as his husband finally turned into the wide-open door of a room. The entrance of his husband and Arabelle's room.
Sighing, Harry placed the invitation sheet down on the table with a grim expression. He leaned his back against the back of the chair, unable to shake off the presence of envy that clouded his mind. He wished that if only he had a fate line like that Alpha from Hufflepuff—to have a soul mate still by his side and the chance to witness the birth of his own child, he wouldn't be this sad.
The voice sounded hoarse and sorrowful in Draco's ears. And it came from a man who was holding a body covered in blood.
It was not uncommon for kings to seek advice from the Oracles before going to war or about to make political decisions.
"I'm fine," Draco replied curtly. "Even though I know all this happened because of you and your enemies!"
"You're worried about being expelled from Olympus because of your human status, right? Goddess Hera said she might be able to make you a Titan if you can prove your adaptability on Olympus and show that you can be of use to the Titans. Since you live in my palace, then you should probably learn to be a soldier." Ares looked into his eyes intently, as if he was also assessing the seriousness of Draco when he said it.
"Buying time," Harry repeated. He suddenly looked nervous. "So that I can stay here longer, w-with you." Harry quickly turned his face to the side so Draco wouldn't notice his blushing face, embarrassed.
"No, of course not, Your Majesty. I was just so excited about this meeting that I came too soon." said the concubine was no less friendly. "Please have a seat, Your Majesty."
Protect him from what? An instant later, they rolled over, and a loud bang hit his head, darkening everything, and Draco couldn't remember anything else.
"At the restaurant?" said Ron. "You know, that place is a lot quieter than a park, and it sure is..." Ron swallowed hard at Harry's somber expression. "We don't have to bother hiding and observing from a distance."
“Then Mrs. Seraphina got pregnant. They were both thrilled, anxious, and happy because it was their first child. After all, it was a precarious pregnancy. Mrs. Seraphina shouldn't be pregnant because of her illness, but she's a stubborn woman behind her frail body." Alden subconsciously smiled, softening the flat lines on his face. "She was determined to get pregnant and give birth to their child, even though everyone was against it, even master Harry was against it."
They were solitary creatures who easily get angry. They do not like crowds, so they choose to hide in caves in the highlands and stay away from humans. Sometimes, a group of hungry Cyclops no longer felt full enough to eat livestock and try to prey on humans.
"But I doubt it because the gods only employ Demigods or Titans and creatures like Centaurs and Satyrs. You're human, so you can't. Unless—" Alastair seemed hesitant to continue.
"You have the right to survive incidents that may occur in the future, no one knows. I could dump you tomorrow or ten years from now, or maybe I'll never let you go. So, I agree. I guess I'll have to reassess you one more time. Are you more than a beautiful body with a rose scent? Do you deserve to be kept in my palace after you turn unattractive and boring in my eyes? This sounds cruel, but since you seem serious—I won't underestimate your intentions either. I ask you one more time, Prince of Sparta. Are you seriously going to support me more than just my bed partner, be my tool and ally? That means you might become one of the assets of the War God, like the Amazonian knights." Ares responded.
Because she was running fast and impatient, she did not pay attention to a stone in front of her. Now, she had fallen on the grass that felt damp because the rain had just poured.
Draco's silhouette took off his shirt, and his innocent upper body was reflected in the dark shadow with a seductive shape. Damn it! Harry started cursing when Draco's shadow in the window made a motion to lift one of his legs onto the bed and seemingly take off his trousers, then Draco seemed to run his fingers through his hair, making his beautiful long hair flutter with slow motion — according to Harry's vision.
"If only my stepmother were not pregnant with my child, maybe I would also fall in love with you, Your Majesty," Terence said non-formally, ending with a chuckle.
Although he collapsed, Draco was sure, the black shadow he saw was Vlad before his vision completely darkened.
Draco looked at Harry again and felt a little uncomfortable because seeing Harry was so calm. Harry was even scary without the slightest bit of emotion. Draco didn't like that. He preferred an explosive and angry Harry over this kind of Harry. With Harry's rage blasting, Draco could fight back with his emotions, but with Harry being so cold, all Draco could do was shrink back in fear.
“Master Harry is currently in Italy. There's some urgent business over there.” Alden shifted his seat to make it more comfortable. "I should have told you this from the start, but master held me back."
Draco hugged Narcissa tightly, and he saw Harry, who was watching them. Draco didn't care how great that immortal man was or how strong Harry was. What Draco cared about now was his mother. He didn't want to be away from his mother and didn't want to leave her alone.
"This... Uh... This is because of His Majesty," said Arabelle embarrassed with her face already reddened like a tomato on a royal plantation that was ready to be picked.
"Then I'm even more worried about Draco," Hermione recalled Draco's plea to her. "He asked me to help him escape from the house. His eyes were so tortured, is it possible that Potter held him hostage in that house by force?"
It was time for Draco to free the poor man. With Hector’s title and physical beauty, he would have no shortage of beautiful women. In vain if he waits for a son who was forbidden to marry by his father. Especially now that he would be sacrificed to become the bride of the God of War, Draco also asked his servant to walk faster and away from Hector.
Draco cursed his bad luck. If he were human, Draco might have beaten him with a golf stick. Luckily, he was an immortal who had strength.
Was Cedric's view of Arabelle that low? Did Harry have to scream in his brother's face and say that Arabelle was a good woman? Even she was a virgin when she first slept with Harry.
He lifted his long legs onto the chair he'd been sitting on. He bent his long legs and embraced the bend with both hands. Draco buried his beautiful face in his legs. He closed his eyes at the same time as those beautiful eyes dripped with clear crystal.
Draco seemed to think a little when he heard Cedric's words. Having made up his mind, without saying anything, Draco immediately dismounted the white horse.
"I feel pity for you. I think Hades is cursing you. Everything would be better off if you just died from being bitten by a snake. But now what? You're going to be presented to Olympus? The king doesn't love you. He's waiting for the right moment to sacrifice you to a god," The mischievous girl babbled. Draco tried to remember her name but failed. It seemed that Troya had gotten so used to ignoring them that he was reluctant to waste time remembering his evil sister's name.
creepy. Draco started to feed the cereal into his mouth and watched the movie. He watched tv more and more serious until he didn't realize Harry was at his side again.
He saw Cedric's arrival, and he immediately prepared in his place. He raised his sword high when he saw Cedric's hand movement.
Hermione smiled again. "Don't worry, I already know." Then she looked at the group of women who were now scattered and busy gossiping with each other. "Don't mind them. They just envy you."
Thousands of years ago, there was a great war between Troy and Sparta. The story was immortalized in
"Again, you're taking this all too seriously. I'm free to do whatever I want, Hera." Ares confirmed.
Harry didn't reply again. He turned back and leaned against the window. "I give you the honor to stand beside me, Malfoy."
Someone as perfect as Draco must have been approached by many men. Even though Draco already had a husband, it would never rule out that crazy possibility. Arabelle twirled her fingers nervously. Surprisingly, she couldn't hold back the question that had been stuck in her head any longer.
He absorbed the view of the house and reminisced about it until the tall black gate closed, blocking his view.
Draco stared in disbelief. Cedric repeated the words that had been troubling Draco's heart for so long.
He felt like a failure because there had been a misunderstanding. Did Ares hate him now? But this morning, the servants treated him as usual, including Alastair. Draco thought he could have been kicked out because Ares was disappointed in him. It seems the war god didn't say anything.
"I think it's my own problem. You don't need to think about it. You're already perfect," Ares rubbed the back of the prince as he hugged him.
Daphne chuckled in amazement at her own handiwork, then muttered, distracting Draco. "You are the most different from Mr. Potter's previous lovers," Daphne grimaced. "It's not that you are any less beautiful, you are the only 'male' lover that Mr. Potter has, but you are no less beautiful than them even if your makeup is not too heavy."
"How should I behave as his wife? What does he like in someone who becomes his lover?" Draco asked bluntly.
All the men on Olympus who passed her couldn't blink or avert their eyes. Ares was one of the lucky gods to be her main lover. Aphrodite was willing to bear his child and, together with Ares, had committed dozens of offenses. They do not want to stop having an affair even though they were often blasphemed and punished for it.
Harry's clear emerald eyes staring intensely at the girl's body suddenly stopped at the elbow. It looked to be bleeding a little. Not only in the elbow, but her knee was also bleeding.
"I just want to get away from you, why don't you let me go?!" this time Draco screamed in frustration. "I beg you. I'm sick of being here. I..."
"It would be more beautiful if we spend it the right way," said Cedric, which managed to make Draco turn his gaze to the man who was currently beaming at him. "Will, Your Majesty, spend his last dance with me?" asked Cedric formally as he held out his hand in front of Draco.
Draco changed places again. Another war with another army, with the corpses scattered on the ground along with the lingering scent of blood and the smell of strong embers. It gave Draco a headache, and he also felt intense sadness from nowhere.
"How could I hate you? You are so beautiful and independent. I should have learned from you," Draco said sincerely.
Draco's body stiffened as he watched Cedric slowly but surely getting closer to him. The brunette's face was so close to Draco's, and even Draco could feel his breath.
Draco was silent. Ares’ words seemed to remind him that he, too, was human. Ares would not hesitate to punish him if he made a mistake. He started to get too comfortable because of Ares' polite treatment of him since their first meeting. He absolutely must not forget his title as the God of War, his age which already reached thousands of years, and his non-human status. His way of thinking will certainly be different.
"I'm not sure if you're alone here. This forest is too far from the royal palace. Are you with Prince Ced—"
"Harry!" A shrill shout that slightly hurt the ears managed to make Harry's anger and irritation evaporate. There, he saw Arabelle running towards him with a smile on her lips.
He didn't want to go down in history as a queen who betrayed the King and fell in love with the King's own sibling. He didn't want to create a scandal that might destroy the image he had worked so hard for.
The envoys, Draco, and probably the rest of the Spartan palace were now dumbfounded. After all the miracles that had been shown, the king of Sparta carried on with his intentions.
"No, Ares isn't that kind of person. He doesn't care what the gods or other Titans say. I think he's just giving you time to be alone or think about other things," Eros explained.
Draco didn't answer Harry's question because it felt like his brain wasn't letting his mouth speak. Draco squeezed Harry's hand tighter, and then Harry cupped his face with both hands. At first, it was cold and piercing, then it began to feel warm, and finally, the buzz was gone.
"Why?" Draco felt uneasy as he watched the messengers begin to put on their helmets and prepare their weapons.
“I think he is ready, not to surrender to you, but ready to kill you. His eyes are those of murderous hatred."
"You have me. I'm your guardian angel. You don't have to worry," Icarus said with a smile. "You just need to stay away from Potter, so the demons don't come too much. Potter is like a beacon for calling the demons out, so you should stay away from him."
The prince pointed one of his hands towards the group of guards. As if he knew the meaning of the code, one of the guards ran hurriedly while carrying a sword that had been prepared for Cedric.
"The King won't mind it. Why should they be stingy with a prince who will be sacrificed to Olympus?" Draco objected.
This young man still hadn't given up on his attempt to harm Harry. Harry could bet that Draco was looking for a gun, something — maybe to smack him on the head when Harry was distracted.
Draco saw blood running down the wooden floor. He froze. His heart felt like it was about to fall off, and at once, the air in his lungs was forced to stop. He held his breath as he glanced at the corner of the room, which was blocked by several bookshelves. From here, he saw Mr. Flitwick lying on the floor with a terrifying face and mouth wide open. Blood came out of his body, which was separated from his heart. Somehow it happened.
The prince was afraid because the bird spread its wings wide to hug and kidnap him away. Although not a hunting bird, it has deadly claws and a beak, but then he didn't run away because the bird dropped a shiny object on the ground, and then the bird backed away and flew away.
Troya, who was a prince that secluded—Ares, didn't want to frighten him. He was still a virgin, and his father's restraint nature meant he didn't get familiar enough with men. Ares knew his reputation among humans wasn't very good. The prince was most likely frightened when he was brought to Olympus.
The scream took Draco by surprise and woke him from his sleepiness. When he realized, he felt himself in Harry's arms, held him so tight till he felt hurt. Harry's whole body was wrapped around him as if to protect him.
At that time, Draco thought that he was happy enough with his career and life. Why should he date if it would only take up his time? But he regretted it this time. If he did die in his sleep and reincarnated into someone else—he should have tried dating. He felt lost. Draco spent three days in Troya's body like a madman. He stays away from everyone and doesn't want to answer anything. Even so, he still forced himself to eat. For some reason—no matter how difficult the current situation—Draco didn't feel like dying.
Draco turned his head to find a group of beautiful women whispering and staring at him with hate. The most beautiful woman in her very sexy black dress openly eyed Draco with contempt from head to toe.
"Why are you so selfish? You only think of me as a substitute for Elle!" Draco also didn't understand why he was so unstable today.
Before the blond could protest or attempt another escape, Harry caught his lips in another of those mind-blowing kisses that melted Draco's resolve and made him forget why he'd ever tried to leave.
The image of his mother and father's cheerful faces, then replaced by depressing faces, flashed through Draco's mind. It made Draco even sadder. If only he weren't helpless like this, he would have avenged his parents on Harry by making him feel the pain his mother and father used to feel in the past.
"Why is this room can't be opened?" Draco was still trying to open the door at the bottom of the stairs.
Draco frowned. "Given all this time he's been pushing his way, I'm sure he'll do it... so he let me go temporarily?"
A loud groan was heard. The bull moved away, trying to stay alive. Ares' sword managed to hit its vital veins. The monster bull's blood gushed out, turning the mulberry bush in its path red. The bull struggled and tried to escape with the sword still stuck with the last of its breath. Ares jumped forward and hit the bull's nose hard with a fist wrapped in copper plates to knock it off balance.
Before Harry could finish his sentence, a scream that sounded spoiled made the man shut his mouth. Both Harry and Draco quickly looked for the owner of the voice, who turned out to have opened the door to the royal study so rudely.
"What was the purpose of calling me to this place? Your Grace must know, as a queen, I can't waste my time on things that are not important." Draco said casually.
"This is Daphne," said Harry calmly. "She will prepare you for tonight." After that, Harry stepped back, turned, and left the room.
Draco couldn't help but smile. Ron looked more annoyed at being forced to come home late than at not seeing Harry.
Draco glanced at Harry for a moment. Sometimes the man's words just can't be trusted. But considering all these things are possible, Draco began to believe in him. His eyes were now on Professor Trelawney again when Luna suddenly nudged him on the shoulder.
"It's all right, doctor. Being sad is a normal thing for me…” Draco smiled bitterly, then put on a sour face, and grabbed his stomach. "Ouch,"
Hearing Draco's sighs and screams made Vlad even crazier. He continued to pump fast and hard. Draco squirmed restlessly, his hands gripping the sheets. And it was a beautiful sight for Vlad, seeing Draco's naked body glistening full of sweat.
"Seriously, what's so interesting about him? Isn't he really annoying?" now it was Blaise's turn to speak.
For the ancient Greeks, a magic trick or two would easily amaze them and worship the magician like a god, but it wasn't that easy for Draco. He flashed his best smile at Troya’s parents and family for the last time. He was about to enter a dark horse-drawn carriage made of aloes before someone interrupted.
Draco chose to sit under a large, shady olive tree while writing something on papyrus. He noticed when his manservant peeked at his busyness and only frowned. He did not write Greek letters but Latin letters in English. Of course, it was not something the ancient Greeks could understand—especially a servant like him. Draco felt safe writing anything even if he idly complained about the Spartan royals he didn't like.
Draco tilted his pretty head. What did Ares mean? Did his protests the other day scorch Ares' interest in him for good? But if that was true, why would Ares still want to carry Draco to his room and hug him?
Feeling highly depressed, Draco paid his respects to his father with polite gestures before the beautiful young man turned around and rushed out of the large room, which somehow felt cramped for him.
The word "quieter" to Draco sounds two ways, either he doesn't like crowds, or he wants to do something about Draco. In essence, Draco must remain careful because being alert is the earliest weapon to draw wherever the foot goes.
"Ah... it's okay, Lady. If Lady is exhausted, Lady and Your Majesty can go back first. I still want to take a walk here." Draco said without the slightest objection.
“W-Would,” Draco cleared his throat because his voice was so hoarse. “Would you like to be brought a drink?”
"What if he tries and succeeds?" Alden interrupted quickly. “Mr. Tom is very cunning and dirty-handed. He uses many people to achieve his goals. We must not underestimate him and must always be careful." Alden looked at Harry with serious eyes. "You should have told me to take care of that person long ago so that he doesn't dare to do anything wrong, my lord."
"Why? Don't you know that rumors about you have also been heard as far as Olympus? Even we gods want to know what the prince of Sparta looks like. Unfortunately, the king of Sparta didn't let you out of Sparta and kept you only around the palace area."
When a big wolf confronted the Prince—that's when Draco gave up all his remaining courage and ran as fast as he could. He screamed desperately. Even though he realized there wasn't much he could do—he didn't want to give up so easily. Ares came just in time and killed the wolf. The other herd fled because they knew that Ares was one of the rulers of Olympus. The God of War still wore his metal helmet and brushed the blood off his weapon with a broadleaf. He then stretched out his hand.
"God Ares! Have mercy on us!" The Queen of Sparta, whom Draco thought was overly dramatic and exaggerated, was, in fact, probably the only sane human in the palace.
Draco stared angrily at Harry. Why did that man abruptly come and scold Draco all of a sudden? Where was the promise that Harry said that he would release Draco if he became his lover? Draco's anger also ignited.
"You're looking for a human, aren't you? A boy. I saw him earlier," He said with difficulty. The Cyclops was now snoring. Ares and the Satyr's conversation didn't affect him at all.
“Put on this dress. You must be ready in half an hour. Mr. Potter wants to see you before the party,” said Daphne, spreading the green dress on the bed and walking out of the room.
"Too bad, Ares, as long as I live, you will still be known as a pathetic loser god that no one wants. As for me? Well, have you heard that the humans in the city of Athens want to build a statue of me the size of a hill?" Athena boasted.
But the one in Ares' palace wasn't the planetarium like in his old school. The Titans and Demigods called it the Star Tower. There was real stargazing there. Not for fortune-telling and the like. Titans made it a kind of research center with Hadreda being one of the leaders.
"Tell your prince my palace has guards who are many times more capable than those in his palace, so he doesn't have to bother sending useless people to my palace, especially to take care of my wife," said Harry with a hardened face.
The thought of ice cubes made Draco bothered. His throat was dry, but he refused to drink from the earthenware jars in the palace because the hot temperature has made the water warm. He also saw a stream that sounded gurgling not far from the olive tree he was under.
Cedric laughed out loud. For a moment, Draco just stared at the man who was laughing until he finally stopped laughing and cleared his throat.
"Draco, you're ready for me." Harry's eyes lit up with lust. "Why don't you want to admit it and not torture each other like this?"
"Ron, you can't just point out the Omega you see for me to partner with," stated Harry, getting bored that he'd been here for about thirty minutes — sitting around making no progress at all. Harry was grateful that no one else knew where their Alpha and Beta were, sitting together and huddled together like lonely men with no purpose in life.
Ares didn't listen to anything Aphrodite said at his side. He just stared at his wife and Dionysius sharply and analyzed them. Dion was not the type of guy who liked to date humans or changes partners. He was almost as loyal as Hades, who only loved Persephone. But his wife Ariadne died several decades ago, and Dion was happy to be single until now. Though, Ares knew that Dion would not be so bold as to flirt with his wife openly.
"That's because I love stargazing," Draco purposely covered up his true intentions. He wants to meet Hadreda, mentioned by Attica.
Harry immediately stood up and hurried. He readied his gun, the heavy dagger that had been at his feet, and his revolver. If he had to kill for Draco, he would.
"I want to save you! Do you think I can let you be taken to Mount Olympus to indulge in all the nonsense of marriage to the god Ares? They are all swindlers! The king has been deceived!" Hector argued.
The door to his room opened, revealing a man Harry had known well throughout his tenure at Gryffindor. The man stepped in front of Harry's desk. "Am I bothering you?"
Sighing for the millionth time, Harry walked in first. The decision was unanimous. "Let's just go back to the packhouse."
"You guys are slow. I could get hurt right now." Draco didn't mean it. He could have screamed for help from the start. But somehow, he was also interested in what the vulture would do. It didn't look like it meant to hurt him.
"You should ask your mother, Goddess Hera. She's the Goddess of Marriage. I'm the most inappropriate person to ask about marriage." Aphrodite laughed.
Harry's tongue then froze when he heard Draco's words. The king certainly knew that a royal noble was forbidden to bow their head too long to others, especially if the royal noble was wearing a crown. Harry couldn't help but flinch as he watched Draco remove the ruby-red crystal crown from above his head.
"That's the God of War; killing a monster bull alone, impressive." There was a cynical clapping sound near Ares.
"I want to stay here, Prince. I don't want to make His Majesty angry again with our meeting." Draco declined gently.
"It's okay. I think you deserve a wedding. We'll invite all the gods of Olympus then. Do you want to arrange your own wedding?"
But Demigods mostly possess extraordinary powers, unlike ordinary humans. For example, Hercules has extraordinary strength, then Perseus, who has the same strength. It's the same with Achilles. As for Draco? An ordinary human who works in a bookstore. He started to doubt his Demigod blood.
"I'm fine, Prince Cedric," Draco said firmly. "You'd better get out of my room. I don't want His Majesty to come here and see where you are. Right now, we're not in our palace. I don't want you two to fight here."
Harry nodded his head, feeling ready because of anger. Tom and the psychopathic killer, whoever he may be, and anyone who dared to hurt Draco, his possession. If they decided to confront Harry, then they had chosen the wrong opponent.
Actually, what had happened to these people? Did they think Draco was so crazy that he played with a guy behind his husband's back? Tsk! If he had longed for love and attention, surely long ago, he had been looking for another man who could warm his heart.
And... perhaps, only Glenice was the only outsider who knew that her queen was still a virgin until now.
Draco nodded and smiled. But then Cedric's large hand reach out to his face, wiping the tears that rolled down his cheeks.
Draco was not sure if they're really married right now. Ares referred to him as his wife even though they had never exchanged rings or walked the altar. He also didn't know what wedding rituals were like in ancient Greece. Right now, he was worried about many things. After this, what will happen?
of this club, approached Harry with seductive eyes. She was the one Harry had usually chosen to accompany him drinking when Harry visited, and now her heart was filled with jealousy that Harry seemed so attracted to the new member.
"Attica, Lasonas, and Argus will return to the residence of the warriors after reporting the events in Sparta to Ares. We would like to apologize for causing you any harm, prince of Sparta."
"Maybe I won't be here long, Alastair," Draco muttered weakly, filling his basket with fresh rosemary shoots.
"Looks like his condition has improved," Alden said, trying to look casual even though he knew what his master had just done to Draco. "We've investigated the culprit."
But a few seconds later, Cedric straightened his back and looked at Draco with a hardy look before he uttered a sentence that made Draco even more frustrated.
"My Lady," a middle-aged woman was now bowing in front of him. "You have been awaited by My Lord below."
"In that case, I also apologize for what I said earlier, Your Majesty. I realize that the existence of a child sounds impossible." said the King of Delion without a second thought, which managed to make Draco feel a little uncomfortable.
Doctor Jason, who was on duty, was quite aware of Harry's reputation for being so cruel and hot-tempered. After all, Harry was the owner of this hospital.
Draco looked up and unexpectedly, the other man was also looking down. Very close to Draco. Draco stared at the dark eyes that were staring back at him. The man smiled but there was a smirk in Draco's eyes, so terrifying that Draco could see his fangs slowly stretching out. Draco winced in horror and his breath hitched. Those eyes stared at him sharply before speaking between his fangs.
The Spartans were stunned. They had just witnessed God's miracle. The whole hall immediately fell to their knees in a worshipful manner. Vultures are known to be one of the pets of Lord Ares. Now that he has witnessed this miraculous transformation, Draco finally believes that they really are Ares' emissaries.
He stared at Harry in silence, as if the young man was waiting for Harry's response. Draco stared at his husband's face, looking for any traces of displeasure that might adorn his handsome face.
Meanwhile, hundreds of the best Spartan soldiers now surrounded the envoys. They didn't allow Alastair to take the prince away.
Draco just realized that he was currently wearing a thin dress. He immediately moved his hand slowly to pull the blanket higher. Draco pulled the blanket up in slow motions until it covered half his neck.
Draco could see a swarm of bees sucking the flower nectar there. Draco also Saw a natural waterfall with clear water flowing down not too fast. The river was shallow and rocky, and he could see nymphs-a kind of fairy creature in human form-playing in the water.
"What's wrong? Why do you look in pain?" Draco asked softly as he brought his hand to stroke the top of the horse's head. The moment Draco landed his hand on the horse's head, the horse let out a small shriek again.
Currently, Harry and his mistress, Arabelle, were traveling. They wanted to spend their last day in the Delion Kingdom looking at the jewelry in the market. Like a couple, Cedric also decided to spend their last day in the Delion Kingdom traveling with Draco.
"Your Majesty Draco, is it okay if we go back to the palace first?" Natalie cut him off as she fled her gaze to Draco.
I assure you that Draco will find his happiness, but it's not that easy. There are some conflicts, heartbreaks, struggles, and misunderstandings he has to face.
Cafe Hogsmeade is a cafe owned by his friend, Luna Lovegood. They loved visiting this place because of its comforting atmospher. The atmosphere looks like it is in the forest with the scent of leaves, rain, and citrus.
If only he had gone berserk and called for the royal healer, Harry knew, in an instant, the situation inside Draco's room and outside the blonde's room would be dreadful. With such a state, Draco must not be able to sleep peacefully.
Everything was fast; Draco didn't have time to run or panic because suddenly Harry's bodyguard, the biggest one, grabbed him roughly, picked him up, then slammed him on his shoulder like a sack of rice.
After that, Draco chose to stay silent the whole trip while wearing his headset and listened to music, trying to keep himself busy with his phone screen as much as possible. He couldn't hear Harry speak, or the man simply didn't talk. Draco didn't really care either.
Draco was speechless for a moment. The young man cursed himself for thinking too far. Damn it! Draco didn't know that fiction novels could affect his sanity.
When they are on their way home, Harry's mood seems even worse than before. Draco frowned at him. Does Harry always go through his days in this rage? That man will surely die young, Draco thought with amusement.
The second way was to look at the palms and count the number. If his fingers were more or less, it means he was still in dreamland. Draco felt his heartbeat fast and pinched as he confirmed that his fingers were complete. He wasn't dreaming. It's all real. After that, the young man shouted out of his high-ceilinged room. He screamed like a demon as he ran around his palace. He couldn't accept it. He's a modern man with a million achievements. He was not quite satisfied with his career. His life was perfect, even though there was no time to date.
Ares was an overly attractive man. Even for Draco, who works and knows almost half of the most handsome creatives in Hollywood. His well-groomed jet-black hair looked pleasant to the touch. His eyes were green and shady, harboring a mysterious yet friendly impression. His face was more captivating than the statue of the gods in the Greek museum he has visited. His skin was not too light, a little dark like the skin of a young oak. His physique was also perfectly sculpted thanks to his routine that likes to fight and eradicate the monsters of Olympus.
His frown deepened when he saw how deep Draco's wound was. Spontaneously, anger took control of the dark-haired man again. Actually, what crazy things have been done by his cousin and wife that his wife could be injured so badly? And how come his wife didn't even weep in pain?
Hearing Harry's voice, the queen lifted his head and looked at his husband. Harry was staring at him with a fixed gaze. Honestly, Draco didn't really hear the question he just asked, but considering he was a queen of a big empire; he was required to look perfect at all times.
Harry pushed himself as deep as he could, finally breaking through the barrier, ignoring Draco's screams of pain. Eventually, Draco's screams died down. Harry lifted his head and gently kissed Draco's open, panting lips.
Draco angrily pushed her hand away and scoffed. "So funny, Pansy. Like I just got permission from my parents to date,"
Harry stepped back towards Draco with a light cream-colored scarf in his hand. Seeing how well Draco slept, Harry felt that his decision to change the bandage on his wife's neck was the right one.
Harry then stood up and walked over to Draco in one swift motion. And then he snatched the phone and threw it in any direction.
Yes, right now, Draco, Harry, the King of the Delion, and Natalie were spending their time relaxing in the central garden of the palace, which turned out to be very spacious, more comprehensive than Draco had expected so far. The garden also has many directions that look confusing. According to Natalie's explanation, many immigrant nobles often get lost in this beautiful garden.
"Because there will be times when you want offspring and have to go to men to fertilize your wombs," answered Lasonas again.
"What were you doing earlier?" Draco wiped his lips frantically and tried to tidy up his clothes while moving away from the predator. "You are trying to—" Draco felt betrayed even though Ares had promised that he was willing to wait. He had even made sure that Ares wouldn't hurt him if he refused to be touched.
"Track their whereabouts until you found it," Harry gritted his teeth. "Whatever it is, the address, the car number, anything to direct us to him. We have to find Draco before it's too late." Harry closed his eyes, for a moment feeling the tightness in his chest.
Still unsuspecting, Alden stepped toward the towel cupboard. It was then that Draco quickly jumped up and ran toward the bathroom exit.
"Where is he?" Ares asked. The transmitter was starting to weaken, and he had only a vague idea of the prince's location.
He knew the action he had just done did not reflect his image as a queen who was gentle and loving to anyone, but for some reason, Cedric's shout and his rude actions made Draco engulfed with an extraordinary sense of fear.
Ron glanced at Harry many times. He really wasn't used to Harry's silence—the Alpha's silence always brought a tingling feeling in Ron's stomach.
“Your father hid this from his family. He doesn't want your mother and you to be worried," Alden sighed. "You may not believe me, but let me tell you first, then you can decide. Whatever your acceptance later, I will not mind, for sure there is not the slightest lie from me to you." Alden's eyes wandered into the past as he began to tell the story. “Your father came to master Harry at the time, asking for an injection of funds and a cooperation agreement. Master Harry wasn't really interested, and he was prepared to refuse flatly. Your father's company, which has completely collapsed due to disorganized management, will require an enormous amount of money and attention to fix things up. But then your father made an offer to master Harry."
Draco thought for a moment. He does not know. He didn't really like living in Sparta. All the attention on him was starting to tire him out, but being taken to the mountains by people who might just be swindlers doesn't sound too much fun either. He still believed that he could return to his original body. Suppose his soul can move to Troya's body that means there was a way to do the opposite. He just doesn't know how.
Draco started not to bother Cedric's impudent behavior. He then frowned faintly. "You mean Arabelle?" he asked without any more rigidity of language.
"The kingdom might be able to issue a new regulation that requires all linen buyers to pay 5% more than the linen they buy. A kind of tax, however, the money the kingdom earns from selling linen will only be distributed to the flax craftsmen, who have sent their linen to the kingdom," Draco explained smoothly.
"I've never held gold this heavy. Your jewelry is sold out. I hope I didn't miscalculate. But it looks like you can buy a house with all this gold," The servant handed him a rather heavy leather pouch.
Draco just flashed his friendly smile at the King of Delion. Draco was so grateful for his strong heart that even though he had been married to Harry for five years, it never occurred to Draco to fall in love with him and that feeling now bears sweet fruit.
Draco opened his eyes and saw Harry, who was still holding his face in his hands. From here, Draco could see Harry's beautiful eyes. But then he remembered Harry's black eyes, and it made him shudder with horror. Draco immediately took Harry's hand off his face.
If Draco's mother had not been betrothed to his father, indeed until now, his father would never have married any women, considering Lucius' very authoritarian personality and never showing his affection for anyone.
As someone who had never been in love, of course, Draco was curious about that feeling. The feeling that his father had suppressed from him for so long. A feeling that his father considered useless trash.
His father's words managed to make Draco's confidence began to waver. He began to worry about himself having to follow his principles or himself having to defend his ambitions.
Draco took a deep breath as if he'd just drowned. The sun's rays made him dazzle. Draco’s eyes are too sensitive. Not only his eyes, but all his senses were very sensitive. Draco was sure he even heard the ants' footsteps in the side garden. It all made him dizzy.
The nagging boy looked a little confused at Draco. Does a snake bite also change his personality? Troya was a very religious young man. But now, he could say some insolent words about the Olympus gods. For Draco, his current life was indeed frustrating. There was no delicious food, no internet, and he can't drink cola with ice cubes.
Harry snorted and glared at Draco. "What do you think? I waited for you in my study room and then realized that you, with your stubborn head, decided to challenge me,"
Internally, Draco grimaced a little. That older man, was he blind or deaf? How could he not know that Harry had a mistress whom he loved so much? In fact, the news had been widely discussed by the high-class nobles. He should have known, even though the information was often discussed in secret.
Draco sighed as the pulse increased with Harry's touch. His brain struggled over what the man was doing with his hand, but his body couldn't resist it. Draco needed Harry's hand. He needed them the most.
Yes... certainly. Draco imagined himself dressed in fancy clothes, dressed by a professional makeup artist, free to do whatever he wanted. Most importantly, he had the golden opportunity to go out with Alpha which is the dream of all Omegas.
"What do Spartans usually do when they party? It's not like Thebes or Athens. I thought you Spartans only knew how to war," Dion added.
Good, it looks like Doctor Jason's getting off guard. Now it's time to find a way to fool this doctor and run away later, Draco thought.
With his slightly disheveled black hair, deep but sharp light emerald eyes, thin, manly curved lips, and high cheekbones that angled his face in such a way, was matched by the jet black suit that wrapped his muscular body snugly, making him look like a handsome angel with a dazzling evil character.
When Harry let go of his lips, Draco's breath coming erratically, this kiss was the most intense kiss Draco had ever felt.
Still, no matter how hidden it was, Troya was very beautiful. The moonlight that slid gently into the expansive room hit his white skin, making it seem like he was glowing. Satyrs and nymphs began to arrive in large numbers. They had many dishes in their hands. Draco noticed that most of the dish was dominated by meat. There was the whole deer roasted in rosemary and large bowls of buttered potatoes and vegetables.
"How is he?" Harry pushed his way through the crowd of nurses. The nurses in another room were seen chasing him because the wound on his arm had not been bandaged.
A large vulture had just flown down nearby. It carried something sparkling in its beak. The young man was immediately alert. Vultures don't bode well in whatever era it's in. Spartan warriors used to see them on the battlefield when dead bodies lay strewn about, severed hands, guts spilled, and blood that flooded after the war covered the field—the bird would fly over the corpses and feast.
Harry watched Draco's reaction, cast a judging look, then continued his words. “You must be my actual lover, Draco. Starting tonight." Harry stood up. “I only made one offer. You will be my lover, and I will treat you well, and if you refuse, I will consider you worthless and throw you to my bodyguards."
In contrast to Natalie, who, as much as possible, displays a portrait of a harmonious husband and wife who love each other, Draco can only slip his hand to hold Harry's strong-arm gently. They don't show anyone that they are a harmonious couple. Still, every time someone sees the two of them, they would say Draco and Harry were the perfect couples over the past few decades.
Cedric seemed to be still surprised by the slap given by Draco. He could only stare at him without being able to process the order of words Draco had directed at him. Slowly but surely, Cedric withdrew his hands that had been gripping Draco's arms.
"Elle!" Vlad shouted that name as he achieved release, for some time this day. Vlad seemed never satisfied with Draco.
Draco didn't want Harry to know that he saw the real side of Harry. Honestly, Draco was actually a little scared, but as long as Harry didn't know that Draco knew his true form, maybe it could make his fear lessen a little.
Unknowingly, Cedric's strong hand moved to grip Draco's freed hand tightly. Draco was surprised, but he let Cedric take his hand. That guy might have been afraid Draco would stumble again.
Draco managed to turn on the light, and it was quickly revealing Harry. The man sat on his couch casually, wearing only black silk pajamas and holding a drinking glass next to his hand. Draco glanced at the brandy bottle that appeared to have come out of nowhere, which Harry seemed to have poured while waiting for him.
Draco was awestruck that he has never had anything so cool like this. He glanced at Icarus with joy, and Icarus simply smiled. It was as if he had just given a present to a child who was crying because his ice cream had fallen.
Simple indeed, but for some reason, Draco still exudes an aura of extraordinary luxury even though his beautiful body was wrapped in that simple plain clothes.
And when Draco lifted his head, Harry was already out of the room. Draco let out a deep breath. Was he wrong? But isn't everything Harry does out of lust? Harry was clearly passionate about Draco and wanted him. But after that, what will happen?
Harry stepped faster. He even ignored Arabelle, who had a little trouble walking because the dress the young woman wore felt heavier than usual.
“I'll help you, Draco, but you have to help me too. I also need my own release. Look at me, sweetheart, look at my body…” Harry opened his black, silk robe, and his body was naked underneath it. Draco's breath caught when he saw the evidence of Harry's desire; it was so hard and firm. "Use me, Draco, let me inside you and heal you." Those words were the only request Harry never used to anyone, and he only did this to Draco.
Tbh, I'm not planning to make this fic long. This story will end soon, with a few more chapters to go. I want to end this fic as soon as posibble so I can re-upload "Love in the Darkness", my other Darry muggle fic that I previously took down.
Draco gave a slight grimace as he could feel his legs being dipped into a frozen river. Cold. But even so, Draco kept his feet there, trying to adjust himself to the extreme temperature of the water.
Humans are creatures who are never satisfied and expect a lot of things from Olympus. They want a miracle to make their life easier. That was the reason why Zeus locked the mountains of Olympus from the humans. Humans should not hear the words of the gods other than through the Oracles. Zeus gave Hermes an assignment for it. The messenger god occasionally visited the Oracles who resided in the temple and delivered the messages of the gods.
"Yes? Do you need something?" Draco asked, furrowing his brows when he saw the anxiety clearly showing on the girl’s face.
Cedric then folded his hands and placed them on the wooden table between him and Draco. Cedric rested his chin on the folds of his strong hands. With a smile on his face, he enjoyed Draco's beauty.
Draco looked at Arabelle, laughing happily with her dazzling smile. All the maids and guards there were mesmerized by the beauty and kindness of their proud queen, His Majesty Draco.
He had already put poison, which would not be detected, on the bottom of the glass specially prepared for Harry Potter tonight. Harry Potter doesn't want to use the same glass as other people. The glass was exclusive, especially for him to use, and this afternoon while pretending to clean the bar, Draco sneaked into the particular storage area and put an undetectable poison on the glass. Harry Potter swallowed a drink from a glass that had been smeared with poison, and then all his revenge would be avenged.
"Your Majesty, is my embroidery done now?" the girl asked, holding the cotton cloth in her small hands.
Cedric's heart was thumping crazy. He felt like a teenager who just got his monkey love. This time, the happiness that filled Cedric was many times more pleasant than the satisfaction he got when he beheaded his enemies on the battlefield.
With one swift motion, Draco could feel that his body was bent in a way that made Harry fucked him easier. His ass and hips were up in the air, and his body almost perfectly bent while Harry was drilling him at an unforgiving pace. He touched his stomach—it was now a little rounded instead of perfectly flat like before, Harry’s come swelling him up.
Draco was startled when his name was called loudly. His silver eyes that had been staring in awe at the swords belonging to the royal guards immediately moved quickly to find the source of the sound.
Harry raised his eyebrows in an interesting motion. Harry then spun around so that he could now face the large red curtains at the far end of the ballroom.
so that all the war affairs have been delegated to Cedric. Of course, Cedric agreed because he really liked the compliments many people gave every time he won a war.
The young man's smile grew wider when he saw his husband finally rise from his throne. In an instant, there was silence. There was no longer the sound of music from the orchestra or the high heels worn by the ladies in the ballroom.
Draco scowled in annoyance and pursed his lips. The blonde also didn't know why he was so wary, even though this wasn't the first time Draco and Cedric had slept in the same bed. When Draco wasn't married to Harry, they had slept together, even though Nelly, Cedric's favorite dog, was in their midst.
The firm voice of one of the palace guards who was right in front of the door of the Delion Kingdom's hall filled the room, which for some reason suddenly became silent. There was only the sound of the orchestra welcoming the arrival of a perfect couple of Kings and Queens of the past decade.
Draco shook his head again, feeling Harry's cock deep in his hole starting to feel uncomfortable. Draco was so eager to move because he was so sensitive right now.
"Hey, strange man! What are you doing? Hurry up and walk!" ordered a man whose path was blocked by Draco. It was actually Harry who got in his way, but the man definitely didn't see Harry.
"I can use it if I want," replied Icarus. His hands were behind his back, and then he walked down the stairs to where Draco was standing.
Loud applause greeted them as the two nobles straightened their backs. But in an instant, the sound of applause disappeared as the two nobles began to move in the midst of battle.
The man looked at Draco sharply, then shrugged and stared at Draco straight ahead. "Come on, I'm not in the mood to argue with you," he looked at Draco seriously. "How do you feel?" Harry lowered his head and studied Draco.
Before Draco could finish his sentence, Cedric immediately pulled the slender body into his arms. Cedric hugged Draco tightly. The brunette seemed to be pouring all his longing and worries to the owner of his heart.
The atmosphere in the club was tranquil. Incredibly quiet. Even the fierce music stopped as everyone stopped doing their activities and stared at Draco, standing and panting in front of Harry as the man sitting on his VIP couch. A second later, a rough hand gripped Draco's arm. So harsh that it made Draco scream.
Harry gritted his teeth, trying to hold back his excitement. "Nothing," his voice was a deep groan, trying to hold himself back when Draco's soft, soapy hands touched his waist.
"Just for tonight," stated Harry. "I also understand the absolute difference between the two of us. However, I swear on behalf of the Moon Goddess, you have nothing to do but stand by me."
His mother left a few minutes ago. She left some money for Draco, even though he doesn't ask for money from his mother anymore, but his mother said it's his birthday. So Draco can use the money and buy anything he wants.
Alden bowed his body slightly, his face expressionless. "I mixed my drug. You know what drug it is."
The Amazonians were a legendary tribe in ancient Greece made up entirely of female warriors. Draco first learned about it from the Wonder Woman comics. Diana, the superhero Wonder Woman, was said to be an Amazonian soldier. They were led by a queen who was said to be descended from Ares due to his relationship with nymphs or fairy creatures.
Harry took a step back when Alden fell. He turned his head and looked at Draco, “Did you see that, Draco? Every time you try to run away, I swear there will be lives of sacrifice for you. Those who are off guard to allow you to run, I will kill them!" Harry viciously directed his punch once more at Alden.
Demigods could occasionally leave Olympus to meet their families. The status of a Demigod was usually kept a secret, as many humans believe in superstitions such as their hair or body parts having specific properties.
"What are you doing? Did I scare you?" Harry raised one of his eyebrows when he saw a look of fear and nervousness adorn Draco's beautiful face.
His mother chuckled and went back to doing her cooking. The excuse was genuinely childish, but at least the answer tricked his mother.
"We even know that you're planning to avenge your parents' deaths," Alden's face softened as he saw Draco's cheeks turn red, then looked at him with regret. "Your parents' deaths shocked us too, Draco. Believe me, master Harry was surprised by that. He is known to be cruel, but he certainly never intended to hurt a weak person. He's been trying to help your father, for your sake,” Alden emphasized his words. "Everything that happened wasn't my master's fault,"
Draco snorted. "I don't want to take anything from here. I came here with nothing, and so when I get out of here."
The God of War heard the sound of a swarm of bees above his head. Rather than Cyclops, Ares was probably more worried about the bees. They were not lethal but annoying. They were also difficult to get rid of. Ares breathed a sigh of relief when he finally saw the prince. Even though they had never met, Ares knew that it must be her. Since he was the only human on Olympus and as per the rumors, Ares recognized her by his unusual golden blonde hair.
He wanted to grab Draco's soft hand and place it on his cock, then satisfy himself in Draco's body. But he couldn't. Harry wanted to get Draco to surrender willingly. Their last two sex was not voluntary. Although in the end, Harry was able to make Draco feel good. Harry Potter never forces a woman to fall into his arms. It is the women who are scrambling to be hugged by him.
wine for their dinner, hoping that tonight Draco gets a little drunk and loosens his guard. But the thought of making love to Draco while he was drunk didn't please Harry at all. He wanted the beautiful man to volunteer, wrapped his legs around Harry's waist when their bodies were joined. That moment will definitely come if Harry will be patient and keep this stubborn young man down slowly.
"The king insists on making sure you bring armed guards if you wish to leave the palace, Your Majesty." The servant girl told.
And with that, the door closed slowly, causing Draco to release another deep breath. His eyes already felt wet from feeling so embarrassed at Greyson. As for Harry, he was still acting casual, as if nothing had happened.
"On an afternoon like this? Are you alone?" Harry asked suspiciously as he squinted sharply at Draco's face, which, unfortunately, remained calm.
When Draco opened his eyes, he was in the same room he woke up for the first time. Draco smelled the pillow again, and it was the same. Draco ran towards the door and opened it slowly because he was afraid the man would see him again. And yes, the man was drinking a can of soda. Before the man looked at him, Draco had closed the door.
Doctor Jason chuckled. "Geez, you make me worried." He took Draco's breakfast and handed it to Draco. "Eat before it gets cold,"
"So what? That dress is specially ordered for you,” this time, Harry growled a little, holding back his patience.
This time Draco closed his eyes while slapping himself on the cheek. When he opened his eyes, he is still in the same place. Again Draco closed his eyes and slapped his cheeks for the umpteenth time.
Harry's lips tightened in a thin line, and then he immediately stood up. “Tell your wife not to do anything. He is mine, and no one can take him out of my house, except with my permission." Harry looked straight at Ron, considering. "I respect you, Weasley. You are one of the few people I respect, and I don't want this respectful relationship to break. Sorry, I'll excuse myself first because there is an appointment with the other client after this." After nodding stiffly, Harry walked away from the huge meeting room.
It's too late to look back. Draco made up his mind. He closed his eyes and spoke quickly, "I am willing to be your companion for a while."
Draco shot Harry a surprising look at the man swearing in such a public place. Things no nobles should do, especially a king of a large kingdom.
According to his mother, only a few Demigods were living on Earth. Most of them lived with their God parents in Olympus. The Demigods who live on Earth are all wealthy and respected people because their God parents support their children's lives. But not for Draco. He only lived in a cheap apartment near the corner of the town.
Doctor Jason sighed as Draco was pensive. "Ah, I shouldn't talk too much. You should get some rest."
"Prince Cedric, you shouldn't have to shout like that. I'll still hear you," said Draco when he saw his friend and brother-in-law walking towards him with a large sword in his hand.
One day, Draco accidentally saw a Nymph smile. Draco shuddered to see her mouth filled with fangs. No incisors or molars. They turned out to be true carnivores.
"Thank you," Draco nodded and accepted. Then he gulped down the contents a few times before giving it back.
"In that case, we take our leave, Your Majesty. I hope Your Majesty enjoys your time in our little garden. If Your Majesty forgets the way back, Your Majesty just needs to follow the golden statue in this garden." The King said with a smile which Draco replied with a nod.
"Elite restaurant, of course," said Ron, sprinting after Harry. "Which makes you much more comfortable and less grumpy."
The arrival of the king and the words full of anger made all the guards surrounding Cedric slowly take steps to leave the house.
Draco was dumbfounded, still fascinated by Harry's show of affection. Was that man doing it on purpose to defend him from the crowd of wicked women?
He kissed and sucked them with a masterful touch. Draco groaned loudly. His back arched feeling the sensation of the tongue and lips and the warm breath of the man down there. Likewise with the fingers that helped tease him out of his hole.
"Wow, thank you very much, Your Majesty. Now I'm even more excited to embroider." Arabelle smiled widely and showed a row of her white teeth.
"Or worse, the Theban spies poisoned him, and then they brought the antidote themselves. All so that they could bring prince Troya to their country."
"No need," Harry's lips tightened in a thin line. "You better go, Rouvas," said Harry coldly, then he turned around and stepped into his mansion with Draco in his arms, shouting at Alden to quickly call a doctor.
"Don't look for any other evidence that Potter likes Pansy again, Dray," Blaise said, sounding serious, which couldn't help but make Draco finally give up on his analysis.
The first thing he had to do was find a job because Draco had to survive. As before. Especially now that he supports himself and the child in his womb, he took a deep breath.
"Se… Sex?" Draco asked haltingly, with his face already flushed with embarrassment. For some reason, Draco's cheeks turned red just by hearing those words.
Harry turned his head, looked at Alden, and frowned. "Ah, yes. He's fine, just had an attack on his head, he's in pain."
"What happened to you, Arabelle?" Harry frowned in confusion when he saw Arabelle now hiding her face in Harry's chest while wailing in tears.
Draco moved his eyes to look at Cedric, who had been staring at him with admiration. "I think you must know what my answer is, Prince Cedric," He said with a smile and gently closed the thick novel on the wooden table. He put his elbows on the table and rested his chin on his hands.
"Yeah, we can relax a bit because there's still a few more hours before we get to Olympus. So Attica, is that story true? Said some Amazonian warriors are going to visit the Titan community to find a mate?" Lasonas smirked.
And what he was worried about happened. Draco stumbled, his body tumbling into the abyss. His head hit a large rock until it bled. His body ached as if there were thousands of needles poking him and his legs were bending strangely.
"Yeah, she's like an encyclopedia walking in there because she's almost the same age as Ares and has lived in Ares palace for a long time. You can ask her anything."
"I'm grateful, but I won't have any reaction to it at this time," Ares responded as if he didn't care.
Those rude actions and shouts always managed to bring Draco back to the bitter memories his father had left him.
"What are you doing here, Prince Cedric?" Draco asked as Cedric turned his athletic body so that they were facing each other.
Without saying anything, Draco accepted the firm hand. He couldn't have refused Harry's invitation, considering that the night was approaching, Draco certainly wouldn't have made it back to the palace without a single light.
It was so big, Draco could feel his already swollen prostate getting pressed against automatically. Draco let out a needy moan. “Please.” He breathed, attempting to move against Harry’s cock.
Draco waited a long time until the car finally slowed down. There was a sound of massive gates opening, then the car started again, slowed down, and then stopped. The sound of the car door slamming. And thankfully, there's a movement to open the trunk. Draco prepared to jump and attack whoever opened the trunk door, then escaped.
Draco remembered Icarus's words. He said Draco would be safe with Icarus. But where is he now? Draco is in danger, and he's not with him right now. The sound of footsteps came from Draco's right, and his body started to stiffen.
His whole life changed in just a short time, his whole plan was shattered, and he was now collapsed here. Back in the devil's clutch, and now even owes his life to that man.
"Your arrival is not disturbing at all, Your Royal Highness. Coincidentally, I do wish to visit another area in this palace." Draco replied with a polite smile.
According to Draco, the atmosphere was starting to heat up, and he should defuse this tense atmosphere. "Fine. So you guys are fighting over me? Look, I'm so honored, and I appreciate that. But being fought over by two creatures that don't make sense..." He glanced at Harry. "I feel sorry for myself. Why don't the girls fight over me? While you guys were fighting, I wanted to eat. Have fun."
"Prince Troya, are you all right?" One of the older women who were the temple caretaker greeted heartily.
Then Doctor Jason laughed horribly. “Let's start this ritual. I will slash you slowly in your body parts so that you will slowly bleed to death," the knife flashed playfully in front of Draco. "Then I'll throw your body right in front of Potter's eyes, for sure I'll be delighted. And later, I'll finish Potter with my own hands,"
care with whatever immortal rules. I'll find the exit if you don't want to tell me, weird guy." Draco then walked out of the room to find an exit.
"We were only tasked with picking you up and bringing the king of Sparta a wedding present. Ares didn't say anything about this," Alastair shook his head regretfully.
The man still covered Draco's mouth. "Shut up," he said. "If you want me to let go, promise not to scream anymore, or I'll sew your lips," he commanded.
From the side, Cedric looked closely at Draco's beautiful face. The young man was really very beautiful. It seemed that God carved his face when God's smiling.
"Fine. I feel like I have a little sister. She is very innocent and cries easily," Draco said lightly, which managed to make a smile line Harry's face.
It was at this moment that a figure emerged from the shadows, stepping closer to Draco's body lying on the cold floor. He lifted the body easily as if there was no significant weight.
When Draco realized what Harry meant, it was too late. The man gripped both of his arms with one hand. Draco's strength was nothing compared to the strength of Harry's hefty body above him. Quickly the man tied his wrists with a dead tie, which was very neat, then tied them to the bed's head.
Glenice looked awkwardly at Draco, who seemed very curious. It seemed, Glenice had to satisfy her queen's curiosity.
Harry’s eyes snaked down Draco’s body, lingering on his lower half. He whistled. “I completely ruin you for anyone else, huh?”
Draco was almost speechless, his tongue stuck. His father offered him to the evil man in exchange for an injection of funds for his company? Impossible! His father couldn't have done that!
Draco's face turned pale and looked at Harry sharply. "What the hell. Why are you take a shower here? Y-You have your own bathroom in your room. T-This is.."
Even though Alastair himself was wearing armor and carrying a blade, he was practically immaculate with his hair and beard regularly shaved. The other followers are also decent-looking. Even Draco didn't smell the pungent body odor of the half-goat satyrs.
The tension spreads throughout Harry Potter's huge and grandiose mansion. All the maids were standing tense in front of Harry, preparing to receive a furious rage from their master. Harry's private doctor was currently examining Draco in his room. Harry wanted to wait in there and see Draco's condition, but his mind was bewildered. The good mood he had this morning has now turned into a burning rage.
Cedric just smirked and shrugged his shoulders. Without saying anything, the brunette stepped into the place where the royal guards were training.
Draco's cheeks flushed even more, mostly when his eyes were swept across Harry's hardened cock. It was clear that the man was very, very aroused.
At this time, Dionysius, the Wine God who had been busy chatting with Phobos and Deimos, walked over to the table of the Titans and Demigods. Draco was joined in and dined with them.
"Yes, wait a moment." A female voice was heard from inside. Soon, the door opened. "...Dray?" called the woman after seeing him. She looked so shocked.
Draco was grateful that Ares didn't carry him until they arrived at his palace. Ares found his horse, and now they both rode it. Draco felt ridiculous as his muscles involuntarily tightened from panicking around the man. Ares seemed to notice his reluctance to touch and sat slightly away from him. Even so, his hand holding the reins was still able to protect the Spartan prince from falling. He also spurred his horse not too fast.
Also, I'm so sorry if this story triggers you guys. But what I already know is that I have included the tags and warnings.
For a moment, there was only the sound of the orchestra and the tapping of heels between Draco and the crown prince.
"Yes, you better not do it. I don't want you to be disappointed. I want to remember you as the first human to be my wife—the most beautiful prince of Greece and other good things. I don't want you to turn jealous and demand attention from me until I have to leave you. It wasn't the first time. I have had so many bad memories with my ex-lovers who didn't know the right way to position themselves," Ares explained.
Harry took Draco's hand formally as he entered the restaurant. The head of the restaurant herself greeted them and led them both to the table that had been prepared. Harry looks familiar with the restaurant's head chef, and Draco sees the head of the restaurant, a French woman with a thick French accent. Now and then, Harry spoke fluent French and smiled in response to the head chef.
There was instant silence as Harry answered Draco's question quickly and steadily. He wanted to get out of this room so he could avoid this very awkward situation.
But suddenly, someone bumped into his shoulder and just walked into the middle of the crosswalk even though the light hadn't turned green yet. From the side of his eye, Draco could see a car speeding up. The person who bumped into him was still walking. The hood they were wearing made Draco not recognize that person is a man or a woman. Though, from their posture, Draco could tell that that person is a man.
Cedric's heart skipped a beat when his sense of smell caught the fresh scent of roses wafting from Draco's long blonde hair. After all, Cedric could go crazy just because of the smell of that beautiful hair!
"I want to take a shower first," Draco said, and immediately got up from the chair and headed for the bathroom.
The King of the Delion Kingdom seemed to be still shocked by what he had just seen. He could only faintly nod his head. Harry's departure with the girl now left Draco, the King of the Delion, and Natalie in silence.
It was about ten meters from the door to where Draco was standing. The door was far enough away to run even if he was running fast. Draco didn't know what kind of creature or human killed Mr. Flitwick. Draco thus reached into his pocket to find his phone and pressed the emergency number with trembling fingers.
Cedric didn't feel the slightest bit daunted. Cedric was used to arguing, fighting to the point of fighting his life with his eldest cousin, two years older than him.
"You are the killer of my parents," Draco gave Harry a hateful look. "And to me, it is an unforgivable sin. I will always blame you for it. I hate you more than anything else."
Harry realized that he really shouldn't underestimate Tom because Tom has important friends behind his dirty business. Based on his subordinates' investigations, the man was linked to an illegal weapons syndicate and underground groups.
Draco leaned his back on the headboard of his bed. Out of the corner of his eye, the blonde looked at his husband, who was busy turning on the heater in Draco's room.
"Draco Black," he replied nervously. "Please, hurry up." And suddenly, his phone caught fire like when Harry burned his phone back then, but this time it was completely charred.
"All right. Please be careful," Draco nodded as Cedric pulled his hand away. Cedric kissed the back of his hand gently.
Draco finally ran to get his phone, which luckily still worked. He quickly pressed to call Luna and heard a murmuring sound like someone was doing something.
Snorting loudly, Harry unbuckled his seatbelt and hopped out of the car. No. Harry couldn't imagine it. Asking his own subordinates to disguise themselves as his companion undermined his pride as an Alpha. Where did Ron get such inspiration from?
Draco closed his lips tightly. He didn't want to answer the question Cedric had just said in a frustrated tone. He couldn't possibly tell the man that Draco's father had carefully planned the direction of Draco's life all this time.
Did Draco have to spend more time teaching Arabelle? But, if he had spent more time teaching Arabelle, maybe he wouldn't have any more friends to relax with, and his husband might criticize Draco's policies.
Arabelle's heart was beating nervously. She held the scarf that the queen had just wrapped around her neck. "Thank you, Your Majesty."
Papyrus can only be obtained through transactions with the ancient Egyptians. It also goes through months of voyages, and usually, only poets, healers, priests, and philosophers use it. In the court of Sparta, papyrus was used when kings made important decisions, regulations, or announcements. But Draco instead wasted it, making the diary and scribbles less meaningful.
Harry's eyes softened slightly when he heard Draco's plea, but then his smile seemed to harden. "I just wanted to make you realize where you should be, Draco." Harry unbuttoned Draco's shirt one by one, leaving Draco's flawless, pale chest open for him.
Both of them didn’t last long this time. Harry came soon, and Draco cried out when he came too, head tossed back. His stomach stretched, and his belly ached, and he was so full. Draco let out another long and loud moan as Harry’s cock twitched inside him, filling him again with come. Harry nuzzled his lower back, and with one last move of his hips, he carefully rolled them both over on their sides.
"The point is, don't even think about approaching his territory, not even us demigods dared. He lives in the underground of Olympus and does many secret things that even Zeus doesn't know," Alastair said.
Draco woke up to he senses the smell of grilled sausages and eggs. Without realizing it, he just walked into the kitchen. Draco stared at the breakfast on the table and snatched it right away. Without thinking, he finished it in just a few seconds. It felt like he hadn't eaten in days. His stomach was starving.
"Well, he met my wife yesterday and had a long talk with her," Ron tried to lure Harry in, and it seemed the fishing rod had hit because Harry's eyes narrowed, and looked at him suspiciously.
Like what Troya usually does, Draco smiled. This time he improvised by waving his hand the same way members of the British royal family do. But he soon realized that his way of greeting was too foreign and lowered his hand because he imitated the behavior of the nobility in the twentieth century.
"You comment too much." Ron started the car engine and started to drive the car out of the packhouse. "You haven't tried it yet."
"He never saw me. I don't know why he brought me to Olympus, but what is clear from your story—he doesn't consider me his lover. Do you know why he wanted to make me his wife?" asked the prince.
"Oh, is that so? Sorry, I'll try to do better later," Draco was disappointed and back lowered his head.
Aphrodite embraced the God of War. For the first time in decades, the Goddess parted reluctantly. "Ares, you are not only my lover. You are my ally and the father of my children, and we are committed to supporting each other. I don't want that to be lost." Aphrodite looked at him sadly.
"That... That red spot is usually done by their partners when they are about to have sex. A kind of stimulation, Your Majesty," said Glenice fearfully. She was anxiously awaiting how Draco would respond.
Eyes burning and overcome by anger mixed together, Draco challenged Harry's stare, trying to ignore the man's nakedness. "I've always heard that you're evil and cunning, but I really didn't expect you to be that low, using drugs to force me, who is disgusted by you, to serve you!"
Of course, the hard movement forced Draco to open his eyes. His eyes seemed to blink a few times when he saw his husband's faint face, but seconds later, his eyes widened when he realized that his husband was really close to him.
"Okay, it's up to you," Ares smiled. He then cleaned his hands with a cloth soaked in warm water and then stretched out his hand.
Daphne was busy tidying up her equipment behind Draco as she continued mumbling. "But you are special. You should be grateful. Mr. Potter never asked me to dress up his other lovers," Daphne's muttering had answered Draco's previous question. “And the most sensational thing is this dress is Mr. Potter told me to order it directly from the designer in Paris. Special order because it was completed in just 1 week, this dress is specially made for you, second to none in this world." Daphne gave a small exclamation, looking dazzled by something in her hand. "You should be grateful that Mr. Potter treats you special."
"Your Majesty, papyrus was limited than gold in Sparta. It's not easy to get. I don't know if the librarians would still give it to you," the servant shook his head.
Can you achieve satisfaction when you are raped? Draco held his burning cheeks with his fingers, feeling embarrassed and disgusted with himself. Maybe it was true that there was hidden inside him a whore who finally came out and took control of his body.
"Sir, I don't mean to offend you, but Mr. Potter is unlikely to be found that easily. You have to make an elaborate appointment with the secretary first,”
"His Majesty?! Did he hurt you?!" Draco asked with his voice starting to rise when he heard Arabelle's words.
"Isn't Cho Chang very lucky to be that close to Potter?" said Pansy in a whisper. She was only joking, but her serious tone forced Draco to take it seriously too.
"But you're sick! There's no need to push yourself like this." Draco said stubbornly, which elicited a chuckle from Charles.
"There's no need," Greyson extended his hand to shake hands with Harry, to which the green-eyed man replied immediately. “Nice to do business with you, Potter.”
Besides, seeing Ares's envoys who were now in the Spartan Palace, Draco was hesitant. Were they really the envoy of God Ares? What if they were actually sent by kings or princes from other kingdoms whose proposals to Troya were often rejected by the king of Sparta? They could have claimed to be messengers of Ares, knowing that no king could oppose God.
Honestly, Draco wanted to refuse, but considering that the other man who was currently asking for the dance was Charles Richmond, one of the dukes who contributed a lot to the prosperity of this kingdom, he couldn't help but accept the dance from the man who seemed to adore him a lot.
Draco returned Hermione's hand and smiled broadly as well. "Draco," he whispered, introducing himself. "Thank you for greeting me, and I'm not a woman." Draco felt cringe by his last words.
"All the Satyrs who serve Ares are castrated because only then can they work properly." Alastair was always willing to explain if Draco asked.
The receptionist looked at Ron and recognized him. "Oh, Mr. Weasley, welcome," Her demeanor turned friendly, and Draco sneered at the difference in treatment he received, especially since the receptionist was looking at Ron with adoration. “My apologies, this afternoon we sent a message to your secretary that today's meeting has been canceled. Mr. Potter suddenly had to go overseas."
Cedric immediately dropped his back onto the bed that Draco was filling without the slightest sense of politeness. It took Draco by surprise. Even though everyone knew about their friendship, Draco was afraid that someone else would step in and gossip about them.
"This time, Zeus seriously thought about punishing you. You could lose your god title, Ares." Hera looked at her son sternly.
Harry turned and looked at Draco. Finally, the man was persuaded to pay attention. At least he was annoyed by Draco's uneasy attitude and decided to send Draco home.
If only the young woman had not been chirping about herself embroidering roses, maybe Draco wouldn't have known what his husband's mistress was currently embroidering.
"Oh, did any Spartan philosopher have such an opinion? Interesting, we don't really follow your progress," Argus commented.
Draco snorted in annoyance at that answer. "You have 3 international chefs in your house," was what Draco heard over the servants' chatter.
Draco rolled his eyes. "I don't want to discuss my night activities with Ares with anyone, understand?"
"He's not immortal and short-lived, but he's reliable," Lasonas patted Alastair friendly on the shoulder.
"Watch yourself, General Hector! If the king finds out about this—" Draco spoke a little loudly. The maid looked restless.
One of the maids pulled Draco's bed cover, and seemed to be checking the sheets, then whispered to each other and giggled. When Draco looked at them with frowning, the two female assistants put on flat faces and hurried out of the room.
Before answering Draco's question, Glenice bit her lower lip timidly. She knew very well that a lowly maid like herself was strictly forbidden to talk about royal family members, especially if she wanted to tell something that didn't sound good.
The royal guards didn't seem bothered by Draco's arrival. Ah... seeing a man as beautiful as Draco, who would be bothered?
The Cyclops was male with one big eye on his forehead and wore buffalo skin to wrap around his lower body. Not many of their kind lived on Olympus. They may be monsters but had the intelligence equal to a stupid eleven-year-old boy.
"Punish me if I'm wrong, but Ares is proven to have broken the rules. He made contact with humans by carrying his identity. I demand that Ares be punished!" Athena persisted.
Draco didn't want to fall into Harry's seduction trap like the people who fell into that his arms. Draco didn't want to end up like Harry's lovers who were simply dumped after he was satisfied. At least, even if Draco failed to get his vengeance, he could walk away from Harry's life with pride.
Draco wanted to argue but didn't want to spoil this beautiful atmosphere. Locked in for weeks in that damned room and now for some reason, Harry is kind enough to take him out — albeit with a tight guard — Draco briefly glanced at Harry's bodyguards who were standing as usual at the access exit.
Draco’s hole clenched against the sudden emptiness, puckering and clenching as it adjusted to the absence of fingers and tongue. Draco’s lips trembled, and he felt tears beginning to pool at his eyes. He was so aroused, he practically needed to come now. He went to reach down for his cock, but Harry slapped his hands away with amusement.
Herion's paces stopped for a moment, and he panicked a little because the two of them met something that gave off an intimidating aura—a Cyclops sitting in the middle of the path while looking at them.
The light for pedestrians is still red. Draco turned to the man next to him and asked. "What day is it today?"
Without waiting, Draco immediately dropped his body in a graceful motion onto the queen-sized bed. Draco also turned his back to Harry. He was too scared to look at his husband's face that always looked angry.
The thought that this man had used so many women and men to satisfy his arrogance and power made Draco feel sick. And suddenly came the strength within him to push the man away and slap him with all his might.
"Right now, you can say you don't love me. But I'll keep trying. I'll keep trying until the time comes when you say you love me."
"Armageddon is a war between demons versus angels. Between them, it means that the creature comes from both fortresses, but they will be one of them." The tattoo on Luna's neck seems to move around following the sound of her voice.
It seems love has made people think irrationally. How could they flaunt their affection in such an open place? Maybe they thought the storm wouldn't get anyone through the area. If so, they were so stupid.
“This is the certificate of ownership of this house. Harry has bought it in your name. And this is the account number Harry opened in your name. All the accessories are in the envelope. You just have to use it.” Seamus placed the files in an open folder on the table and smiled again. "I was only ordered to hand over these files to you. When everything is complete, I will take my leave." The man got up from his seat, leaving Draco, still staring at the papers on the table in shock.
Draco looked at his father, who was now taking a small glass bottle out of his pocket with a cold stare. When Lucius took Draco's hand and placed the glass bottle in his hand, he remained silent.
"Hey! Don't go around doing things like that! You think I'm an object?!" Draco shouted angrily. He still didn't care about people looking at him with strange looks. Draco has often been considered abnormal since childhood because he can see what ordinary humans cannot see.
Titans can't really blend in with humans. They were immortal beings who cannot age. They kept their secrets properly for thousands of years. Zeus also ordered to place all the artifacts and technology of the Titans on Olympus, which was guarded with layers of protection. He didn't allow the human race to know their secret.
Draco blinked a few times when he heard Harry's grunt. "So... Your Majesty came here to avoid duty?"
His heart skipped a beat as he imagined himself wrapping his arms around the body from behind and resting his head on the man's strong back.
Draco was devastated, devastated when he saw Harry Potter, the lover he trusted so much, sending private messages to a girl he said was just a close friend.
"And you, Draco," Harry took off his jacket and rolled up his shirt sleeves. "This is a warning for you. If you fool one of my bodyguards again to escape, you will waste one life because I will kill them right away."
Draco turned and narrowed his eyes. A slight glare from the very bright sun. It was Hermione's husband, Ron. The redhead wore a black suit and smiled faintly at him. Even though he was Harry's business partner, luckily, this one was a good man and loved his wife. Draco recalled Ron and Hermione's affection at the party that night and was amazed at the amount of love that emanated from Ron and Hermione when they met eyes.
Draco still stared at the scene before him. Harry lay down proudly, evidently stark naked under his covers, and stared at him with a look of possessiveness. He frantically pulled the blanket over to cover his entire body, but his movement made Harry's blanket sag and almost revealed his manhood.
"Don't challenge me, Draco." hissed Harry piercingly. "Maybe I've never done it to a man, but I've done it to women who I thought of no longer useful."
"Slow down," Harry whispered softly, pulling the glass away from Draco. "Stubborn brat," He grumbled, then took a sip of the drink in the glass.
A groan escaped as she felt a stinging pain run through her elbows and knees. As much as possible, she tried to get up from her position. But unfortunately, she was too weak and could not do anything.
"Yes, accident, the police said that your car was sabotaged and the brakes failed. Your car rolled over and hit your head. Luckily we were able to save you."
Luna smiled. "I think he likes you," she said, and it literally made Draco almost laugh out loud if Luna didn't close his mouth quickly.
Draco couldn't lose the War God's protection so quickly. He had to survive as long as possible on Olympus, at least until he could meet the oracle named Cyllenius and find out why his soul could be in Troya's body.
"This is my first marriage, Goddess Hera. At least I want to do it in a civilized way." Ares confirmed his stance. Goddess Hera arrived late, dinner had just finished, but the guests knowingly dispersed. They noticed Goddess Hera that came with angry faces. Ares' followers had returned to their residences.
"What do you think I want to do?" Harry threw down his shirt and stood naked in front of Draco. The man's body was extraordinarily beautiful, slender but firm with his muscles poking out, looking so strong. "I'm going to take a shower," Harry looked amused at Draco's surprise. "And you come with me."
," Daphne was dumbfounded when she saw Draco looked normal at the name of the restaurant. “Hey, that's the classiest five-star restaurant. There will be lots of eyes that see and judge you, but don't mind them.” Daphne rolled her eyes flirtatiously. "They're just jealous because you're with the most wanted bachelor."
"Go away. I don't want to argue, nor do I care what you're here for. Go before I force you by myself," Ares ordered. He and Athena had never fought head-to-head, but everyone thought Athena was stronger. All because in every war, the side that Athena defended usually won.
For heaven's sake! Bless his soul! Draco was still fully dressed, and what makes everything worse, Draco's outfit was a thin white t-shirt and shorts that showed off his smooth thighs. And when the clothes get soaked, it makes Draco's body so sexy, reflected illegally behind the white clothes that make him look mysterious.
He turned his head wearily to find Harry sitting on the edge of his bed. Draco shuffled as far away from Harry as he could, and his behavior brought an amused light in Harry's eyes.
"I don't mind," Harry replied, tightening his grip even more. "This way, people will know that only I can win the heart of Draco Malfoy. Only me," said Harry with a smile.
"Not master Harry's mother," Alden seemed to be able to read Draco's mind. "Mrs. Seraphina Potter is master Harry's late wife."
All the guards held their breath when they saw that smile. Seeing how fierce Cedric was when he was fighting, the guards were overcome with fear that their queen would be hurt later.
"Ah, Your Majesty is here too? I didn't expect Your Majesty to be here," said Arabelle while trying to be as calm as possible and trying not to be influenced by Cedric's sharp gaze.
Harry's head was lowered, and Draco felt certain Harry would kiss him for a moment. But somehow, the man's neck stiffened and stopped his intention. Harry pushed Draco away. Then turned his body toward the door.
Ares put his helmet back on and jumped off his horse. Herion had memorized Ares' habits. When he drew his sword, it meant he was telling Herion to stay away. The horse neighed and galloped away, leaving Ares in the dark and the monster bull snorting furiously at him. Someone had sent the monster for him. The creature was not commonly roaming on Olympus. In addition, monsters usually will not directly attack the Titans like him. They were designed to kill humans, not Titans.
The maid looked like she was begging, but at the same time, an aura of disgust and anger enveloped the young woman in a black-white lacy apron on her chest, typical of a royal maid. Draco’s still confused when his personal maid shook her head and gave Draco a code to tell Arabelle to leave them.
The mysterious man kissed his nape. Draco couldn't avoid the man's touch. He stood too close and locked him in front of the door! Draco could even feel his back against his hard chest.
Draco's future? Who is this man to decide his future? Draco wanted to explode in anger but couldn't. Harry looked different. He looked so calm but clad in a dangerous rage, so cold and charming. After all, why did Draco think Harry was charming? While cursing himself, Draco tried to erase the thoughts that led to his attraction towards Harry.
"The Japanese said, if you want a flower to be beautiful, it must be cultivated because flowers have a way of bringing people together, pulling them away from home," he said again.
With a gentle motion, Cedric pulled Draco's chin so that the young man's baby grey eyes that had been staring at the labyrinth garden in front of him shifted their focus to the night sky dotted with various stars.
Instantly, the atmosphere in the small house cooled. Both Harry and Cedric flashed their hostile gazes. Even the healer bandaged the wound on Draco's neck felt all the hairs on his neck stand on end.
"You mortals think of them as mythology, and yourself make a convincing spectacle that they exist." Uninvited, Harry sat next to Draco.
The man is wearing medieval clothes. His eyes are dark and sharp, shaded by thick eyebrows and curly lashes. Pointed nose. His jaw is firm with thin lips that seem cynical but curvy sensuously.
Troya must find an opening where he can escape. Maybe he could pay Ares' envoys to let him go or have his loyal servants tether a horse on the slopes of the Olympus mountains. The problem was he doesn't know the truth. It was possible that they wouldn't take him to Olympus, but to some other place, he didn't know. After all, Olympus was very far from Sparta.
"Ah yes... It feels inappropriate for us to chat with each other when Your Majesty doesn't know my name yet. I'm Natalie Canterbury. Previously I was the 13th concubine, but now, I have been appointed as the main concubine and in charge of filling the position of empress that has been long dead." explained the concubine, Natalie, in such detail.
"I won't bother you," Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco's doubtful look. "I won't bother you, Draco." the man repeated his words. "I won't even get up from this chair,"
He then lifted his ass from the chair he had been sitting on for the past three hours. Before he left, Draco took the time to bow slightly to the crown prince.
It took Draco a moment to understand the words. Until then, he realized the meaning of Harry's words, his slight awareness screaming a warning of danger. His body immediately moved, desperately trying to get away from the danger.
Draco’s breath deepened. He finally felt exhausted. His hole and nipples were abused, and his stomach was so distended. He wanted to rest, but he said, “Okay.” The hatred, the revenge, all of them have long been forgotten.
Without saying anything, Harry stepped toward Draco. Again, the man swallowed hard when he saw Draco's smooth back. Dirty thoughts began to fill Harry's head.
, a duck meat dish grilled to light brown and greasy with crushed soft potatoes served with a salad bowl. It tastes amazingly delicious with a blend of unusual and distinctive spices, making Draco fascinated with this typical French cuisine's flavors.
Maybe it should be like this. Perhaps Draco and Harry should have taken different paths and parted ways with all the happy and sweet memories that remained at the bottom of his heart.
After this, what? Can he talk to animals? Troya was compelling to be in a fairy tale. It seems the theory was wrong. The canary flew away, flapping its wings frantically after hearing Draco speak. Obviously, he can't talk to birds.
Today was the day that the entire Shinia Kingdom entourage prepared for their return in the next two days. Everyone was getting busy, Draco was as busy as everyone from his kingdom, but he still made time to sit in the Delion Kingdom library and read a book that caught his attention.
Draco then ducked down to bring his face closer to Harry so that the man would see his eyes. Within this distance, Draco can admit that Harry has a handsome face. But there is a dark side that envelops him so that Draco should not know him any further.
Harry shook his head. Oh, of course, you can, Harry muttered to himself, but he would lose the satisfaction of teasing Draco. He wanted Draco to be in this room with him.
"Bastard," Harry cursed with his eyes already brimming with rage when he saw that the white cloth around Draco's neck was now stained with bloodstains. Even the stains had soaked Draco's goose feather pillow.
Draco was scared. Will he be forced again? The air started to feel suffocating, and Draco began to gasp.
Icarus smiled. "This sword will appear when you need it. You just have to call for it. Say 'Excalibur' when you need this sword."
"Doctor!" Harry called out half screaming. And Doctor Jason, who happened to be nearby, walked in worriedly.
When Harry pulled himself carefully away from Draco and lay next to him with his arms still tight around his body, Draco was too tired to move. What a magnificent heavenly dream, Draco sighed to himself, still tingling with the lingering remnants of such a satisfying pleasure.
Harry casually lay on the bed, unconcerned with his naked body, raised his eyebrows, and smiled as Draco looked away. On purpose, he approached and lifted Draco's chin to look at him. "Why, babe? You're embarrassed to see your lover naked? Haven't we spent hours naked together?"
Harry grabbed Draco again and whispered softly in his ear. "I can help you heal your pain," as he spoke, his free hand went down to the blonde's chest, deliberately rubbing his finger across Draco's nipple, then it goes down to his lower body. The groan, when Draco felt Harry's fingers touch him, sounded agonized. “Too sensitive, darling? You need a release immediately, right?" Harry's hand moved and grabbed Draco's cock.
Icarus then kicked him, and Draco rolled on the stairs. Draco's eyes looked at the room where Professor Trelawney was teaching earlier, and suddenly he returned to where he was eating his lunch. Was it Harry who took him to see it through his eyes? Draco wondered. He choked again, but his vision was still the same.
A crisp laugh escaped Arabelle's lips when she heard the words Harry had just said. Without asking Harry's permission, Arabelle willingly leaned her narrow back against Harry's firm chest.
The King of Sparta refused to believe it. It doesn't matter how convinced the messenger was. He didn't want to give up his son without a fight.
Harry was quick to stop him, his grip strong on Draco's little cock. "Hold on, baby, go slow. I want you to go slow."
"You can laugh all you want." Harry took another deep breath. "I'm not going to force it because it's hard to say it. Do you want, uh, to date me? Not just a date, but a date as, you know, a lover," Harry could feel his neck turning red now.
That night Draco fell asleep with a nightmare, where Harry kept saying that threat in his ear, that he would kill anyone who helped Draco and anyone who was off guard until Draco could escape. That sentence rang clearly throughout the night.
Icarus took out his sword and split it in half. Though, the sword remained the same, and another sword appeared. "This is a sword covered in the blood of thousands of angels who have died fighting demons. With this, you can kill those demons," explained Icarus.
Draco fell silent. Harry freed him. That was enough. And if it meant Draco had to tolerate this man's arrogance one last time, it might be worth it.
"I just want to get out of this place!!" shouted Draco angrily, frustrated that Harry had used sneaky threats to prevent him from running.
"Me too. I already marked him so that he can come back to my house after ten days," Harry also refuted, not wanting to lose.
In a hurry, Cedric grabbed Draco's hand. He pulled the hand a little harshly, but Draco didn't make a protest. He knew a man like Cedric must have great energy. Maybe Cedric didn't mean to grab his hand so violently.
Ares seemed to have forgotten his main goal. Alastair and the other envoys must be anxious right now. Ares should have immediately picked up the prince and told them, but he couldn't stop observing the prince of Sparta. He barely even noticed when the pack of wolves started to move in to hunt. Draco was their target.
"Prometheus! Icarus Prometheus!" the man shouted, but Draco didn't turn his head and continued walking down the stairs.
"You have agreed to the terms put forward by our Oracle more than a week ago. You can't back down anymore. Even God Ares has graciously brought all these gifts. Do you want to oppose it?" Alastair asked in an even tone.
"He's in pain!" Harry's voice rose. "I thought his condition would be better, so tomorrow he could go home, but he is in pain. Why is he in pain? You said his wound would get better..."
"Queen Draco, you must know that right now, the kingdom is thrifty? We must prepare ourselves. We don't know when the other kingdom will attack and seize power."
"But it seems you have to intervene, Your Majesty. Because I believe, this rebellion that I have prepared is a large-scale rebellion that will have an impact on the Shinia Kingdom."
"Your Majesty, please forgive Prince Cedric. He doesn't know what he means. Prince Cedric is still young. He can't control himself well." Draco pleaded.
Draco couldn't help but blush at the action and the look of utter contentment on Harry's face. Sticky and tired, he lowered his legs back to the bed and tried to roll the older man away so he could go clean up.
"Ares' area of power is filled with the toughest warriors belonging to Olympus. Including the women who are average Amazon warriors like me. For those of us who respect Ares, women are a weak side to him. Argus and Lasonas don't talk about it, but actually, we might as well create a situation that forces some of his lovers left," Attica confessed.
The door opened, and Daphne hurried inside. The woman gasped to find Draco's tear-streaked state in that dress — an exclusive dress designed by a famous designer, the only one in the world, which was very expensive and must have made all the women envy — now dangling rips across Draco's chest in a pitiful and disheveled state. The expensive make-up on Draco's face also went awry because of the tear marks on Draco's face.
Empress Draco Lucius Malfoy's smile grew wider as he imagined that he would soon descend to the dance floor and be able to show off their closeness to another noble couple that had made him heart a little envious.
Draco suddenly realized it. The conveniences he got accidentally, like the small house his father could buy for a very low price.
Confused, Ares said things he shouldn't have said. He said he no longer wanted to share the bed with his mortal wife. He did it because his pride was disturbed. He couldn't guess Troya's behavior. Yet all this time, he was proud to admit that he was the ultimate lover worshiped by his lovers—except for Aphrodite.
Honestly, after hearing the news that he was pregnant, Draco felt as though his world was collapsing and falling to pieces. After all this time, he had struggled to get rid of Harry, and Harry had miraculously agreed to free him, but it seemed fate was playing a game with Draco.
“Since Mrs. Seraphina's death ten years ago... Master Harry changed, he closed his heart. And immerse himself in work. He's never been the same since then."
During his life in London, Draco was practically an atheist. Draco often claims to be an agnostic who doesn't believe in any religion. The concept of ancient Greek belief for him was far-fetched. But the transfer of Draco's soul into the body of a young Spartan named Troya had miraculously made him rethink his faith. And now he saw a vulture turning into a giant that he could not explain logically. Was that magic?
"Yes, your answer is correct, Your Majesty. Can I be proud that such an extraordinary queen knows my name?"
Harry turned and had his back to Draco. His face couldn't be seen now. "I just wanted to see you, so you don't run away. And I saw Abaddon come into the store," he explained.
Harry seemed to be able to read Draco's mind from the look on his face, his lips tightened in anger, and the man growled. "Forget it!" Harry threw down the napkin angrily, then stood up. "Alden!"
Unbelievable! Draco shook his head in disbelief as he heard the words slip freely from Cedric's lips.
"No, Prince Troya. Kronos has the same form as us. The story of him eating his children is just a dramatization spread by our race," said Argus again.
Draco swallowed hard. The atmosphere in the room became awkward. He deliberately coughed as he tucked his slightly disheveled hair behind his ear. Not forgetting to straighten his back.
The two nobles walked hand in hand towards the shady tree in the middle of the blue flower bed. A sense of calm immediately greeted the two of them when they were under the tree, which turned out to be very big.
"Still," Draco still had doubts. "Why me? Just out of curiosity? Really? Then what if I disappoint you? If I'm not as beautiful as the rumors say, then what will happen to me?"
The club owner welcomed him. Of course, considering how much he owes Harry. Hurriedly, the fat man led him to the best VIP seat. "You can choose anyone to accompany you," muttered the owner of the club in a livid tone.
The question that came so easily from Cedric's mouth made Draco's eyebrows knit together. He didn't even think Cedric would ask a question he could already answer for himself.
Until then, Harry Potter came into their life. Harry Potter was attracted by Lucius's rapid development and was thinking of starting a partnership. At first, Lucius was not interested. He was pretty satisfied with the business he was running himself. But Harry did not give up. In various ways, he tried to approach Draco's father. And somehow, Lucius finally surrendered to the power of Harry Potter into the power of darkness, which, when gripped, would not be rereleased.
"One of his lovers used to try to cast a love spell on Ares. They were taken to prison and sentenced to death," Attica said in a small whisper.
"I want to do it. I'm not naive, Ares. I know very well that one day you will leave me. That's why I have to prepare for it. I love living in your palace, I have friends, and they treat me well. I know someone said that I wouldn't be allowed to stay here for long as a human. When you are not tired of me, you will protect me, but if you ignore me, someone will force me to leave. I have nowhere to go back, so I think this is a reasonable request." Draco explained.
The sun began to emerge timidly from the east as if it didn't want to stare at a group of humans who had woken up and were doing their respective duties with such enthusiasm.
For a moment, Natalie was taken aback by Draco's explanation. The situation between the two of them was quiet until the arrival of a man interrupted the silence.
"I will treat you kindly, not as a prisoner, but as my lover. I think we can have a pretty good working relationship."
Draco's face turned pale, hearing that the god eavesdropped on his when he cursed harsh words. He felt like jumping and running to the wolves' lair because of shame.
Harry's fingers touched Draco's tight hole and fondled it with incredible skill until Draco's thighs were open, hot, wet, and ready for him. Harry was already on top of him and squashed him. Draco can feel how passionate Harry's cock touching him.
"You like it?" in the dim light; Harry looked gentler. The evil line on his lips seemed to be fading, and it made him appear even more relaxed.
"Master Harry was very angry with your father. Your father simply squandered the opportunity he was given, and master didn't want to give it a second chance. The company can't be in your father's hands anymore if you don't want to ruin it even more. So master bought it at a reasonable price, even still giving your family a monthly allowance every month even though your father doesn't deserve it," Alden looked at Draco deeply. "It's all because my master is worried about you."
"I wish Your Majesty Draco could adopt a child or two. I can't wait to be the aunt of Your Majesty's cute babies." Natalie said in a cheerful tone that managed to make the tense atmosphere that had previously surrounded the four people disappear.
"You!" Harry called to a servant who had been seen holding back her tears. If Harry remembers correctly, the servant was Draco's personal maid.
Harry clenched his fists angrily. “Look, this is just a small abrasion, and I want all my words to be obeyed, take my blood, and save him! And if…" Harry's panting, his eyes glancing at Draco's limp body. "And if anything happens to him, I'll make all of you pay for it!" he muttered menacingly, making anyone who heard him shudder with terror.
"Ah!" Draco let out a small shriek as his body felt like it was about to limp because his feet had accidentally been tied to the bushes. Cedric, trained to be alert, immediately put his hand on Draco's back and restrained the queen from swaying.
When their eyes met, her laughter disappeared instantly, and there was not a smile. Because of intense curiosity, little Draco walks closer to her to ask why the girl stood alone and laughed for no reason, but the closer he got, the more the girl lowered her head. Then suddenly, the girl lifts her head to show a big smile with two fangs appearing in both corners of her lips covered in blood, and both eyes widen as if her eyeballs want to come out of her head.
A werewolf man looked at Draco from the side of the road. His eyes that glowed even during the daytime scared Draco a little. Only a little, because not all werewolves are evil and dangerous. The man smirked as he looked at Draco, and now Draco was really scared. He seemed to know that Draco could see his wolf eyes and wondering what to do with Draco.
"I'll introduce you to him. I'll take you to his house this weekend, how about that?" Draco was starting to get excited now. There is someone who will replace him to love Harry, and she is a vampire who can't die easily.
"They won't suspect you. Abaddon must have killed them too or erase their memories. You're safe here." Harry walked toward his kitchen. "By the way, where is your guardian angel? He doesn't appear when you are in danger. Ah, maybe he is scared of Abaddon."
Draco flushed angrily. “Are you an animal or what?! Get out now. You better not expect me to help you with that!”
