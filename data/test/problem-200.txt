“Come back if you need anything,” Pansy called from behind, not bothering to follow them. “And do stop by later, I still need to take your temperature.”
Harry stepped into the room with a sheepish look on his face and scratched the back of his neck. "Sorry," he said, embarrassed.
“Ah Ron! There you are!” Lavender came running towards them as soon as they set foot in the already overflowingly busy hall, her lilac dress waving around her legs as she ran and an equally purple mask in front of her face. “Interesting choice of robes.”

Harry’s head shot up in surprise, looking at the Captain wide-eyed, the mesmerised trance he had been in now broken. “What?”
Luna’s smile looked sad now. “I promise I won’t hurt you, you have my word Em,” she said softly while extending a pale hand out to him for him to take.
about the map: there was a golden line woven across it, the end of the line seemed to be fading while the new beginning was bright and clear, sticking out proudly against the sand coloured background. The line seemed to be
aboard this ship?! He needs inspecting, who knows what diseases he could carry!” she yelled as she started inspecting Harry, lifting his sleeves and nodding at the scars she must’ve seen there. “For the Queen’s sake, do you even eat?” She lifted her face shifting her calculating stare to Harry’s eyes. “Or sleep?”
of all people who spoke up. “Blaise.” It sounded like a warning.
chest. “‘Never celebrate your win too early, always be cautious of the other’s position,’ remember?”
“Draco… ”
“Yeah I get it, Riddle-”
Harry nodded again and took the plate, walking out the door of the kitchen and onto the quarterdeck. The stars were out already, shimmering brightly, an early spring breeze whirled around Harry, making his hair even more messy than it usually was. It couldn’t be later than seven in the evening, yet the night looked as if it was midnight. Calmly Harry finished his food, thinking the past two days over in his head.
Harry started taking off his top very reluctantly - insecurity, doubt, fear and anxiety were all gripping at Harry’s heart, making the rest of his emotions squirm - the tight fabric of his shirt hadn’t left his skin in weeks due to his paranoid but mostly accurate fear of him getting chased after by power hungry men and women alike. Harry almost let out a bitter laugh as he was yet again reminded of
The Captain in turn took a step back, closer to the door. “No I’m afraid he can’t; don’t you want to experience your second time seeing land from the ship? I bet
Eduardo handed Harry a plate of food when dinner was over. “Here, take this, next time you’ll get the chance to eat with the rest, but for now you can just pick a spot on deck to eat.”
“Here,” Eduardo said, handing Harry a bowl of soup with a friendly grin on his face. “You can eat this outside, just choose any place on the ship you want, well except from the captain’s quarters that is.”
exactly he had ended up on this ship in the first place, his sleeve had rolled up revealing him to be ‘the one and only Harry Potter’, that went to show how dangerous Harry’s clothing leaving his skin really was.
The sea was suddenly
“We’ll drop the bowl off by the galley and then I’ll show you a place you can sleep,” Neville said.
The bolt slowly left his body and Harry imagined it sighing as it went, bidding Harry the best of luck and leaving him with the promise that it would always come as soon as Harry would beckon it.
He couldn't help but grin as the storm created another lightning bolt that hit even closer to the ship, eager to reach Harry.
“Listen Harry,” he started. “If you ever need our help or if you, um, just want to come back, we’ll be there. We would love to have you on our ship.”
“Well erm, okay, I think.”
“Hey mate!” A voice broke Harry’s dreams, echoing in his mind, and bouncing against the walls of his consciousness. “It’s time to wake up!”
Barely a second passed before the two pirates who had come in launched into an intricate conversation with Eduardo. After that pirates entered fast: Ron and Neville waved excitedly at Harry; Luna smiled and winked at him; Blaise grinned, his eyes covered in a strange gleam and his teeth shining in the dim light; and last the Captain entered, his squinted eyes searching Harry with intensity. The Captain's glare made him slightly uncomfortable and he had to physically stop himself from sighing in relief when Eduardo yelled for him to come over, breaking Harry out of the trance he had been in.
Harry had, in a haze, moved to the main deck and immediately spotted Luna and Ron talking: he couldn’t quite help but think of the Captain spitting Ron’s nickname out as if it was a foul curse and yet again Harry wondered exactly
“Oh yeah,” Nigel said nodding. “quite sure, Blaise couldn’t have meant anyone else really.”

Hey! Sorry, posting took a bit longer than expected hehe, but I'm back and I'm going to post normally from now on yet again :) Enjoy!!
the bloody map?”
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Fine Weasel, go for it, don’t fall into the sea, please.” And with that Blaise turned around and walked back to the sterncastle deck. “Draco for the love of everything wicked, let me steer the damn ship, you steer like a maniac!”
Harry didn’t bother taking his eyes off the map to come up with a witty reply, instead his eyes seemed to be glued to the thing, one question moving to the forefront of his mind. “What is it?”
“Malfoy?!” Harry called out in surprise. He had expected a lot, but it was safe to say that Malfoy wasn’t one of them. He should’ve known that it was Malfoy by the way that his hair had shimmered and those grey eyes, but there had been something so different to the Malfoy that was ‘Dorian’ than to the Malfoy he had come to know, Dorian somehow had seemed more real, more vulnerable, softer than Malfoy had ever been and Harry had liked it, a lot.
“What do you reckon they’re talking about?” Ron asked, suddenly next to him and whispering in his ear.
Lavender clearly chose to ignore this remark as she directed herself at Harry. “Have you already found out who your date is? We’re all very curious.” She winked at her last sentence and Harry decided that he didn’t even want to know who she meant with ‘we’.
"So shall it be. Blaise Tamir Zabini, please confirm through your signature that you have witnessed these proceedings and they were completed with true intentions."
Draco took in the crinkles of mirth around Harry's eyes, momentarily lost in the unhindered view of the bright green color of the irises. "Seeker Doubles."
The constricting in Harry's throat made it hard to swallow as he focused on the messy, dripping wet hair, flushed cheeks from the hot shower, thin silk bathrobe, bare feet, exposed tattoos…he couldn't speak.
"Finally, Draco Lucius Malfoy, do you have any final questions before you are officially released from the Death Eater Rehabilitation Program?"
Harry barked in laughter, stopping to hold himself up against the wall, unable to hold it in any longer. "Oh god, how do you know they're different flavors?"
"Fairly confident I can," he said, holding out an arm to call over his broom. "Count of three, Malfoy?"
Finding the moment he needed, he used every ounce of focus and strength to push himself into a seated position. Leaning casually against the wall below the window, he primly arranged the comforter around him, and almost released a sigh of relief that the down texture covered his distraction. Harry's hands were too preoccupied messing up his own hair to assist his movements and cause an even more unfortunate incident.
"Throwing spells, are they?"
Harry laid back on the pillow beneath him and pulled what he could of the sheets over his face. Draco continued to show no such shame, the cigarette smoke filtering almost as soon as it left the end, so the house wouldn't stink. "Is that so?"
His mouth opened and closed a few times but Sirius didn't make a sound. He started to say something several times, emphasizing his point with an extraneous finger and narrowed gaze. Finally he made a choked sound and shrugged, turned around, shut the door, and walked like a zombie down to the basement where Remus had a cup of tea and snifter of brandy waiting.
"Pans is probably still in the Lovegood girl's bed in some foreign state; she has more pressing concerns on her mind."
"You've got a few dozen more notes at my desk. Mind taking them?"
"Never better, Potter," Draco coughed as his head stopped spinning. "Back up, you're stealing all my air."
"Favors aren't as fun if their details are given away, Potter," Draco said, trying to shut him up.
"Right on time, as always."
As he wrapped his gloved fingers around the handle, he almost purred. He wasn't allowed a broom like this for the entire tenure of his rehabilitation, Quidditch deemed too aggressive an activity for someone of his history. His muscles screamed for the exertion, and in lieu of warming up properly, he swung his leg over the broom and kicked off into the air.
- Your beta and alpha skills are legendary (LE-GEN-DRARRY okay I'll stop now) and this would not be what it is without you. Endless thanks to you.
Penny Thatcher sniffled a few times but didn't burst into tears all over his desk like some did; the last wizard he'd processed left great piles of tissue all over the cubicle.
After Apparating, she looked around at the dark street with small piles of dingy slush, and decided she would need to stop at the corner store before heading home.
"I could return it to you by the end of the day, or you could just give me the temporary license to do this myself."
"No excuses, you won't even wake up for a few days at least," she said, guiding him to his bedroom and charming his pajamas on. "I'll come check on you, or send someone over to make sure you're alright and haven't burned the building down from making tea."
"It's a Muggle shop, I usually use the bathroom for any spells, and I refuse to eat wearing rain-soaked clothes. Besides. You still owe me a date."
Henry nodded and adjusted his grip on the bag before disappearing to the communal kitchen. A silencing charm on the door and the walls, refreshed every few days, kept the noise of an argument down the hallway from reaching outside of the apartment, and from the way Henry rubbed at his eyes between putting fruit in the fridge, Cassie and Kevin had been at it for ages.
The Department Head, who doubled as a counselor and therapist, smiled as June handed her the heavy wool. "Typical post-Valentine's. Did the other counselors go home?"
Furious knocking on his door startled him, almost hitting his head on the counter above. Brandishing his wand, the buzzing still in his veins, he army crawled over to his foyer, only a few feet away from the kitchen, to peek at the shoes beneath the crack: nondescript, brown, no robes swishing above. Not an Auror or his parents. Since only a few people knew where he lived, it was easy to deduce who it was, and back away enough to avoid a broken nose, as Hermione used her key to open the door.
"You can't leave well enough alone, can you?"
She yanked on her desk drawer, the top one on the right that stuck on cold mornings, and ran her finger over the tops of several bottles before selecting a perfume that would cover the smell of despair before she walked out of her office for the day.
It seemed to soften Harry, the pout twitching as if he wanted to laugh. "It's wretched out, let's go to the loo."
"What flier?"
"Is he going to who I think?"
More chuckling, and that damn vibration of Harry's voice doing things to him he wished were happening in any other situation, except the one where he was draped uselessly in his arms.
"Yes," Harry said, his hands slowing as he dragged out the single syllable into not quite a question.
(See the end of the chapter for
Releasing a breath that washed warmly, sweetly, over Draco's face, Harry nodded and signed his name at the bottom of the form. "Thanks, Malfoy. Let me know if you need anything from the DMLE for this."
Harry looked up at Draco from the ground of the pitch several feet below, breathily heavily, belying the sprint he'd taken to get over to Draco's side that quickly. His cheeks were bright red already from exertion, and several trails of sweat ran rivers down his temples.

Typically she'd knock before entering, but privacy was a joke in their small makeshift office with walls barely taller than her average height. So, her surprise at witnessing a very occupied Draco snogging the Auror on his lap, was more than warranted.
Harry's mouth remained in the shape of his next insult, eyes crossing as he stared at the white chocolate penis presented to him. A creeping blush started below his collar and made it to his ears before he cleared his throat.
Blaise knew exactly what to look for; the nervous adjustment of robes or carefully not making eye contact with anyone. There were still disreputable characters, and he'd had so much fun weeding them out as part of his Rehabilitation with a clerk in the Wizengamot, he intended to make a living out of it.
The witch slumped her shoulders a little further down, mumbling into the scarf around her neck. "Last night, sir."
"So," Draco said, "how does that even work?"
Draco's eyebrows shot up. "On second thought, let's get you to the loo."
"Ready for me to fly circles around you, Potter?" he called, thanking Merlin his voice was steadier than his stomach at that moment.
Percy cleared his throat pointedly to regain control of the meeting, raising an eyebrow at Blaise's suggestion. Both men nodded, Blaise still smirking and Draco rolling his eyes, and turned to face the Head Clerk with interest.
Draco decided then and there making Blaise's smirking illegal would be his first act as Minister, if his supposed "best friend" even lived past today.
He jolted when a warm hand touched his cheek, jerking to look at Potter's face instead of the snow flying in the streetlamp.
but-"
"They were waiting to fly in when I opened the office today," Lorna said, smirking as she marched up to Draco's cubicle. Her pride shone like a star. "You'll find your theories and ideas have caused a stir up above."
A sharp intake of breath, the sound whispering in the air before a firework exploded. "Jeffrey Barnard Richardson."
He didn't have the answers, but as guilt rocked through him, Draco promised himself, his reflection with a trembling lower lip blood red from spending the last several minutes worried between his teeth, he would stop this before it even started. The toothbrush was methodical across his teeth and gums. Too forceful, his spit was pink with his own blood, bright against the white of the sink. He avoided looking to his right when he passed from bathroom to bedroom.
. The rain poured on top of the cover, loud and near deafening, but Harry's voice cut through the sound like an arrow. "I came up for lunch, you numpty, didn't know you were the one dragging your heels in front of me."
"You already know, boy," Lorna said as she walked back to her desk. "Aurors have a lot of clout around here, especially when they've defeated a Dark Lord twice."
Closing the door was their signal Lorna wanted Draco to be completely honest with her. With a small wave of his wand, he cast a freshening charm on his favorite chair, to rid the legs of the street salt from workers' boots. He crossed his legs and relaxed into the comfortable leather.
Draco glared at her as if she'd called him the wrong side of a hippogryff instead of his own surname. "Granger. Potty. Weasel."
Blaise nodded, biting his lip from asking just what sort of special circumstances, barring the use of gold, Draco used to be released early from his rehabilitation. The two wizards were the only ones left as they reached the level below the Atrium, only a two minute lift ride left to go, and he turned to take his chance, when a hand shot out to stop the lift doors from closing.
"Are you implying you like my glasses, Malfoy?"
Potter smiled as he said, "You've got nice skin."
His mouth in the shape of a small
Grabbing him under his arms as best he could, Draco moved them towards the hallway. To his credit, Harry tried to help by propping himself up by one arm pressing against the wall in the hallway, but it only served to throw Draco's balance off.
"Yes, it does," Lorna agreed. "Though, I think it hurts more for them than for us, my dear. The wix passing through our office come to us in a time of upheaval when they can't trust themselves to safely administer the Obliviation, and bare intimate details of their personal life. Do well to remember that."
Throughout it all, Harry was annoyingly unruffled for Draco's taste. The waitress returned as the Auror opened his mouth to make a comment, and he again motioned for Draco to make the first move, and he ordered their caprese in a practiced cadence before Harry asked for the turkey club, extra arugula, with the same tone only regulars can carry.
"Seeker's Doubles?" Harry parroted, after he'd swallowed. "You're out of your mind if you think you'd beat me."
"Are you going to change or play me in your perfectly pressed trousers?"
and he did not, in fact, lose his best friend?"
Henry collected the rest of his schoolwork, already half-packed when she'd arrived, and laughed ruefully, before leaving for the diner with free wifi and decent coffee.
"It's Jenkins, Braxton. Jenkins." The name was drawn out with an annoyed whine. "Please just call me June."
Harry's grin twisted into an amused grimace. "Alright, that's enough. Time for bed, soup and tea. In that order. Up you get."
Groaning, his hips pressed involuntarily into the mattress to rub against his sleep pants in a way he hadn't experienced in months. Would this have been on the Ministry flier? Part of Granger's pep talk? A renewed libido after years of suppressed magic and resigned exhaustion? He doubted it, even as he hiccuped from the surprise of sensitivity.
"Shh, Draco, I already told Madame Gastigan where you'd be. You need to rest."
"Malfoy," croaked a voice down his hallway. "Y'alright?"
Draco didn't complain about the moment to recuperate. Their second round was much longer than the first and he was having a hard time stopping his arms from shaking and his gaze from wandering, several lines and patches of sweat discoloring Harry's shirt by now, causing it to cling rather than flap in the breeze.
HAPPY OCTOBER!
Draco gulped, the arms previously raised in an open and challenging stance now hanging by his sides. "What are we doing, Potter?"
"Shut up, Potter," Draco said. He couldn't help his grin and he could feel the burning heat in his cheeks from his exertion.
Even with his heels digging into the stone and carpet, and scrabbling against walls with manicured nails, Draco made it to the hallway below the Owlery in no time. Blaise put a bit more force than he'd let on into the compulsion spell.
Hermione busied herself making tea, rapidly explaining to Harry what she'd overheard and why it was so urgent he come straightaway. His red Auror robes weighed heavily on his shoulders as he listened to her recount of an incident in the alleyway near her job at the apothecary. The long day of work and promise of another sleepless night dulled his senses so he did not immediately notice when the victim of the attack emerged from the bathroom behind him.

"Malfoy, could we just-"
and space was limited.
"Fucking hell," he groaned, plopping heavily on his arse to check if he'd ripped through his sleep pants.
The walk to the lift was more chaotic as the court dates and appointments flew by, but everyone skirted the two imposing men, striding with purpose towards the queue back up.
"Ron, let's take that Howler now, shall we?" She gave him no choice as the dumbfounded Weasley trailed behind her, pulled by his collar.
"Same for you, you know," Harry continued. He wiped his hands on the napkin in his lap, only a few bites of their meals remaining on their plates. "Practicing. If you're free on Saturday night, the Quidditch Pitch at the Ministry is open. No one really uses it on the weekends, and Mungo's completed all their physical fitness tests of the players down there two weeks ago."
Theo bent double laughing when he joined Blaise and Draco in the dorm, post-procedure.
"What?" Draco spluttered, swinging his head from gazing in the steamed windows to examine Harry closely.
As he picked up the crisp, the salt beneath Draco's fingers reminding him how sweaty his palms were, he put it in his mouth with a defiant crunch.
"Just bring it down here," Hermione said, muffled behind her book.
Draco looked up and tipped his mouth in a small grin before wiping his mouth with his napkin and folding it on top of his empty plate. Harry, whose hair was completely dried now, grinned back at him while the sun broke through the clouds outside to shimmer on the foggy windows.
The gold buttons on Harry's bright red Auror jacket caught Draco's eye as they reached the end of the alleyway, and Draco grabbed his arm with a firm grip. "This hero streak you have where you won't accept help is getting egregious, Potter."

June tapped her wand against her boots to protect the suede from the disgusting February slush. She didn't need to ruin her expensive boots, and place a cherry on the top of her shitty day. Her bright red hair with blonde at the ends earned her a few whistles by passing muggles and wix alike, but she ignored them all, just continued to walk towards the closest Apparition point for home.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Molly. She made a huge batch today when she found out you were under the weather."
Shaking his head mutely, Ron pointed to the gift card tossed to the floor, the kind that sang when it was opened, which Harry found out much too late…

By now Draco had reached the hallway into the locker room, and he could hear the slap of Harry's trainers on the stone floor, close at his heels but giving him a bit of space. That way, when Draco stopped short and spun to face him, they didn't collide, but only just.
With the remnants of Valentine's decorations hanging in the Ministry, a red streamer caught his eye rather than Auror robes, though there were several of them in the Atrium just before nine in the morning. Blaise checked his watch one more time before walking around the throngs of employees milling around like ants in an overturned nest.
Harry froze as they made their first stop, a green haired witch joining them, her voluminous robes forcing the two men off to the one corner, nearly touching.
Harry shook his head, failing to take notice of the way Draco's hands shook behind his back. "Can't recall a single time you've bested me on the pitch, Malfoy."
Draco was shaking, obviously afraid anyone had noticed him careening through the castle with a mold of his own penis made of melt resistant chocolate. Harry moved his hand up Draco's arm, a familiar swath of skin beneath the pads of his fingers, and slowly licked the end of the candy.
Draco grinned slightly, his hands shaking from excitement as he watched the document glow around the name momentarily, taking the quill from Blaise's outstretched hand. "She'd make me do something ridiculous as repayment."
The day passed much the same as the one before, except the second day there were more appointment cancellations and rearrangements, as couples made up or the wix had second thoughts. Each time June came around with an updated list for the four counselors in the office, his cheery attitude took another dent, until the shining gloss dulled to a more complacent, normal countenance. His watch, moving at a glacial pace the whole day as he promised himself he was
's. Draco left the scarf on the coatrack but grabbed his jacket. March was more forgiving than February but not by much.
Hermione rolled her eyes and drained the last sip of her wine, her fingers threaded through Percy's fingers as they sat on the couch. The New Year's party was going swimmingly except for the…minor misunderstanding in Harry's kitchenette. Hermione could make out Harry's shoulders lifted in self-defense through the window between the living room and kitchen.
"Draco?" Lorna called from her office after one of her appointments from the day before left, a fresh handful of tissues and puffy eyes their most distinguishing features.
Parvati Patil scoffed. "You are hardly a gentleman, Blaise Zabini."
Sirius stopped dead in his tracks. At the risk of seeing more than he wished of his godson and cousin, he whipped around to see the newcomer. Rather, the woman who'd been in the room all along, just out of sight in the adjoining loo.
Really, that voice should be a registered weapon.
Her sigh of relief relaxed him as well, the sympathetic tension dispersing. "Good, you should be recovered after just two days, then."
"Thank you for coming in on short notice," Percy began. "I won't waste too much of your time this morning, the letter should have explained your presence for the witness of a signature. I trust you had a good weekend?"
Draco tapped the quill gently on the parchment, to avoid ink stains, but also to release the pressure building in his body. It
Percy looked up to acknowledge his appointment with a smile, before returning to his task of rustling through a ceiling-high cabinet. He tapped his heels to float back down to the floor and walk to his desk, a slim blue folder in his hand, and welcomed Blaise to sit down.
Replacing the drifting motes of afternoon sun through his window, the streetlamp outside glowed a sickly yellow onto his sheets, coloring everything a dingy sepia tone. The door across the hall, the one to his bathroom, was open and the soft glow of the automatic night light illuminated the contours of his shower curtain and the outline of the single bar of soap, razor and toothbrush. He blinked to adjust to the darkness of the hallway after staring at the night light too long, trying to see around the corner into his living room.
Several seconds, where the men shared breathing space, siphoned all the air from the room. For the first time in several minutes, Harry's gaze wandered from Draco's eyes and moved slowly down to his lips. Draco licked them in response, his mouth unable to properly wet the lips still dry from flying.
"He's the witness?"
The sound of several small intakes of breath was driving him mad. His eyes were closed so he could focus on regaining his breath and lowering his heart rate, so he could hear each time Harry opened his mouth.
Draco scratched his quill against parchment with sharp, brusque strokes, noting every necessary detail in shorthand to be deciphered by a clerk later. The department was always swamped after a holiday, with Valentine's and Christmas proving the worst.
Without pausing to let anyone where he was going, to avoid the predictable
"Draco drink this immediately," Hermione demanded, holding a tiny vial to his lips that he drank without question. The fit of laughter, compounding upon itself, slowed to a halt when the Calming Draught took hold. "Better. Now, we need to get you to bed immediately so you can rest this off. Now that you've cast, you're going to be exhausted. Did you Apparate home?"
. Months, really," Harry said, each breath hitting Draco's neck and face. Draco realized he wasn't breathing anymore when Harry's eyes met his again. "May I?"
Draco shifted so his arm was more securely around Potter's waist. The pub he'd stumbled (

At this proximity he realized the height difference wasn't that significant, once he'd gained the final few inches of growth defying his childhood malnourishment. For years Draco was taller than him, but he got a strange flip flop in his stomach looking down slightly into wide eyes. Guilt swarmed him instantly, realizing Draco was the same height as Jeff, and a wave of nausea twisted inside of him.
The feeling of hitting turbulence on a broom washed over him again, but instead of a featherweight charm from Hermione, his feet were swept up from the rug. Panic flowed through him as his shoulders pressed against a bicep and a familiar warmth flooded through his abdomen with a deliriously fit chest pressed against his hip and arm.
"Thank you," Draco whispered, quiet enough the wizard snatching interdepartmental memos from the air to make extra notes couldn't overhear.
The smirk on Theo's face darkened further into a hint of sadistic glee.
"I knew you'd be a chum!" Blaise charmed the candy to follow his friend as he shoved him out of the room with obvious relish. The magical thrust sent the Slytherin, resisting every inch of the way, out their dorm and out of the common room.
fall off of the broom, tumbling to the astroturf a few yards below him, rolling as the breath rushed out of him. The broom landed lamely on the ground, bouncing once on the springy turf before hovering a few inches, patiently waiting.
"I apologize for standing you up," he said, keeping a straight face and putting a heavy sincerity in his voice, ignoring the slight lightheadedness from sitting up. "But you see this meddling man at work released me from indentured servitude and I haven't been myself since."
She bought herself a few moments by rifling through her planner of all the appointments of the following week.
No response. Of course. She tried to hit their doorbell with her nose, and realized how sticky it was, and hoped it wasn't something utterly foul.
Theo turned to Blaise as their third friend disappeared for no doubt the most embarrassing encounter of his life…and that included that one time Voldemort hugged him in front of the entire castle.
She'd already committed the words to memory, mesmerized as she was, but she nodded and jotted a few notes down in her planner dutifully. "Was there anything else this department could assist you with, Mr Zabini?" June winced at the canned tone of her voice, the phrase cascading off her tongue in a pre-rehearsed ramble.
"That bastard owes me fifty Galleons," he said, more to himself. June was certain he'd forgotten she was even there, a self-satisfied smirk playing at the corners of his full lips, until he turned that sparking look towards her. "Pity, that I've missed him this time. Do me a favor and let him know I dropped by, and he had better not miss Thursday as well."
"Where are your glasses?" Draco blurted, as much to break himself of his own fixation on the different textures he could see in Harry's hair, as he was genuinely curious.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy!" she berated, tripping over him to land with a wumph on the carpet of his living room. He winced as he heard the knee of her jeans rip. "Dammit, these are my favorite."
Though it was delicious soup, and he was so parched he finished two pots of tea in no time, the constant presence of Harry in his flat unnerved him and he only half finished the serving. Had he folded the couch blanket? Were his counters clean? His mother would be so disappointed if he had a houseguest as lovely as Harry without offering him something to eat.
Percy's high cheekbones colored slightly, and his eyes sharpened with humor. "My weekend was blessedly quiet, as I stayed home with a glass of red wine and a riveting thesis. I immensely enjoyed - ah, Mr Malfoy, thank you for joining us."
"He's
Or, how awake his cock seemed to be.
Hermione cast a featherweight charm on him, he felt the sudden loss of mass and it halted his comment as his stomach went to his throat, like missing a stair step.
The rest of the processing took seven minutes. Throughout, Harry never once made eye contact with Draco, moving his hands from his robes, to folded on his lap, to his hair, to under his thighs, repeat. The same platitude he gave to Miss Thatcher he also gave to him, but the dismissive shrug of shoulders told him everything he needed to know.
Draco's hand moved to rest on Harry's opposite arm, fingers curling around his bicep. He knew Draco could feel the new scar there beneath his elbow and spiral up towards his shoulder by the way those long fingers tensed against him. But he didn't say a word. Later Harry knew he would need to tell Draco exactly what happened - words always worked better for him - but for now, a quick nap on the couch while holding him close was exactly what Harry needed.
"You sure know how to compliment a man," grumbled Draco, but he couldn't deny the growing feeling of exhaustion washing over him. A man's hand, Harry's hand, rested on his shoulder as he slumped down into the mattress, eyelids fluttering and eyes unseeing. He unconciously moved into the warmth of Harry's hand as it smoothed the comforter over him.
Harry nudged Draco with his knee below the blanket they were sharing. The couch bounced a bit as Draco retaliated with a press of cold toes against the top of Harry's foot.
A small moue of surprise, covering the ache of rejection and despair hanging on his clothes from the night before, filled Harry's face. "How did you know-?"
"How do I look?"
He smelled like the soap provided in the Ministry showers, something Draco had used a few times before fixing his bathroom that first month in the Ministry provided flat: sharp and clean, an overabundance of tea tree oil to make up for the cheap product. The white of his teeth stood out sharply against his cheeks, tanner than Draco would ever naturally achieve, and during the startling moment the most coherent thought he could form was he'd used a breath-freshening charm, too.
When he paused, looking a bit apprehensive for how Lorna would respond, she gave him an encouraging nod. Smiling at him over the rim of her mug she said, "You've given a lot of thought to this, what else? I know there's more."
With his muscles firing on all pistons and his brain woefully dysfunctional, Draco could barely stay still long enough to hear the first sound of one leave Harry's mouth before he pushed up into the air.
"Are you...are you okay, Harry? You haven't been home in weeks and I feel like I still don't have you here."
"I got behind today, day after Valentine's and all," Draco said, reshuffling his desk to organize it under the scrutiny of his superior. "How was your day, mum?"
"Sorry, Granger," he said, the static in his veins from the aftershock of magic numbing his lips and tongue so it came out with a heavy lisp and the last r rolling around in his mouth like the purr of a motor. He used his foot to kick the door shut and then lay still.
The day after Valentine's was always hard.
Harry seemed preoccupied enough with his seat in a chair taken from the kitchen, a magazine Draco recognized as a local Quidditch gossip rag, to not notice Draco's own distraction.
The kettle slammed in a more satisfying way than the door had, rattling on the metal. He shoved his wand violently at the gas to light the fire and was granted a four foot high blaze for his trouble.

"Two days?" he exclaimed. Didn't he have something important happening in the next...day or...he couldn't remember, lethargy replacing the static electricity in calming waves.
"Ten months, four days."
"It's been dismal," he said. "Reminds me of my first Valentine's Day here, actually."
"The fuck are you saying-"
Standing with the help of pushing on the arms of his chair, Harry shuffled over to grab Draco's hand. The blond looked up and stayed quiet, though Harry could see his patience was waning.
A broom waited by the entrance to the pitch when he returned several agonizing minutes later and he raised his eyebrows at the stamp of Firebolt Five. This was Potter's spare broom? Trying to change quickly, but not wanting to appear too eager, had caused him to fall on his arse. Twice. Like hell he'd let one blossoming bruise stop this from happening.
"Well, what?"
Draco's lips popped with a sharp release of breath, and his "No," was as emphatic as could be.
Only through his considerable force of will did he not sprint to his desk to open the note immediately. No one sent Draco Malfoy of the Magical Detachment Facility, little blue notes
, Draco thought, surveying the inside of Potter's medicine cupboard,
"What?" he snapped, turning around; eyes wide, hair unkempt from running his fingers through it too many times…Potter stood outside of
But none of them turned to this.
“I can’t say I’ve ever had a need for this particular product,” Draco replied flatly, taking the man’s Galleons and adding them to the till.
“I can’t imagine that would be very good for your business,” Draco added, not meaning for it to sound so much like a threat as it did.
When the yellow-haired man appeared to buy mermaid scales for the third time that week, Draco finally marked it in his ledger. There were only a few potions someone may need that quantity of mermaid scales for; most of them were unsavory, and plenty were downright illegal. Draco was usually careful to keep note of the ingredients of this nature he kept in stock, and eventually he would inform customers as they approached the legal limit of how much they could purchase or possess at a time, though it rarely came to that.
The truth was, Potter would always leave, would always have one foot out of the door. He would always need an escape, need a release that Draco couldn’t provide him with, and it would never be enough.
“He hasn’t moved,” Granger was blubbering, her composure breaking down in an instant. “He hasn’t moved in almost a day. He sleeps so much, he sleeps
Draco traipsed around to the front of the couch quietly, and watched as Potter slept. Despite himself, he bent down slightly to see that small tears were welling in the creases of Potter’s eyes. As he watched, one finally brimmed and spilled over his cheek.
“Right,” Potter said as if only just considering it, and began to take his robes off, revealing a muggle t-shirt that said the word Star Wars in blocky text for God knows what reason, and a pair of inexpensive looking jeans.
He nods.
The flat was even more cluttered than Granger’s, and considering the man currently sat unchallenged as the Most Powerful Wizard In The World, he certainly didn’t seem to bother to employ magic to cook or clean often. There were dishes piled high in the sink, official-looking, stamped and embossed papers crumpled and strewn about, robes tossed over desks and chairs and nearly every surface cluttered with any variety of items, including what appeared to be a stack of several unopened gifts in the corner.
The room quakes as Potter fucks into him. Draco hears something crash in his kitchen. The very air seems to crackle with magic, like the hair-raising static before a lightning strike. Draco buries his face into the bed, moaning into his mattress. Potter fucks him like he’s trying to get rid of something, and bites down on the back of Draco’s neck when he comes. The trembling of the room shudders to a stop.
Potter looks up in the chaos, not even bothering to grab his wand as two nearby witches scramble to cast
Draco reached a shaky hand out to Potter’s shoulder, rocking him slightly until his eyes slowly opened. He jerked back into the couch when he saw Draco, wiping desperately at his eyes, and Summoned his glasses with a flick of his wrist. Draco rocked uncomfortably on his foot when he realized that Potter was blubbering: low, quiet, but nevertheless unceasing sobs were spilling out of his mouth, and he covered it in an attempt to stop them. Eventually, he sucked a long breath in through his mouth and looked up at Draco pitifully.
It was a longer stretch of absence than the public was used to, and far longer than Draco believed he could stand — six entire months during which he heard nothing. And then Potter reappeared on the cover of The Prophet, a photo of him glowering against camera flashes as he herded some shackled dark wizard or former Death Eater or other into the temporary Ministry penitentiary where they’d no doubt be herded off to Azkaban. Draco had waited for weeks after that, months, knowing that Potter was alive and okay, but he never reached out again, never so much as replied to Draco’s owls until the day he strolled by the Potions shop two years later, too much a coward to even wear his own face.
Potter put a hand on Draco’s arm, as if all of the cruel things he was saying were actually exactly what he wanted. “You’re amazing,” he said, rubbing small circles in Draco’s skin. “Draco. You’re so amazing.”
Harry sat on his bed and took Draco’s hands in his, pulling him closer. “Draco,” he said quietly. “I’m not leaving you.”
Potter looked glum, but he nodded. “So,” he said. “What time do you get off? Can we get dinner?”
“Lately you need it all the time,” Draco finished for him as he refilled the vial with the potion which felt warm in his grip and was as deep a purple as the midnight sky. He’d seen similar potions rip through the community, had known his fair share of wizards who had lost themselves in the promises that they found at the bottom of the vial. Though he tried not to think of it, he could understand Potter’s temptation toward the darker side of potions — he’d felt the draw in the early years after the War as well. The desire to be numb.
He’d learned that wasn’t something he could take for granted, seeing Potter again. He’d taken it for granted once, but he knew better now.
Draco couldn’t help glaring at him, a look so withering it made Potter wince. He wasn’t normally one for magicless violence, but he was simultaneously tempted to lift the register over his head and throw it at Potter’s gawping face.
Potter stirred with a start, lancing forward onto his hands and knees, and for the briefest moment, there was something dark in his eye — utter terror, Draco realized. Then he blinked it away and looked up grinningly, and Draco was disarmed just as always. “Funny running into you here,” he said, rubbing his neck.
And then the man burst out laughing, a deep, hearty sound that came from somewhere low in his belly. For someone who seemed so reticent of attention, being the loudest thing in the room didn’t seem to bother him; Draco could even hear Ragbin stir in his office at the disturbance.
“I was only doing what your fearless friends should have done from the very beginning,” Draco said, and Potter’s face twisted the way it always did when he came anywhere close to insulting his friends.
Draco watches the rest of it unfold from Potter’s flat. The DMLE succumbs first, and then the Wizengamot, and then, inevitably, the entire Wizarding world.
“Wine? Firewhiskey?” Harry asked as they rounded into the kitchen — he was even hosting now. “I actually know where everything is now,” he said. “Hermione and Ron came round to help me clean.”
“I should have stopped him,” Granger murmured, both of her hands against her mouth, a caricature of fear and concern. Despite himself, her worry lit something dark within Draco — a resentment for the heroes’ unrestrained willingness to call on the villain in times of need, to demand his help without even having the courtesy of admitting who he was helping, loyal as these unrelenting Gryffindors always were to their friend.
kind of path in life or he’d slowly drive himself insane. Of course, it took as much time for the Wizarding World to accept former Death Eaters back into society, and yet longer time for him to find a Potions master willing to take him on, even as an apprentice.
And then — because what could he do when the Harry Potter was saying such sweet, beautiful, insane things to him — Draco stood and climbed nearly across the kitchen island and did weave his hands though Harry’s hair, pulling him into a deep kiss as he did so. They kissed ferociously, like they hadn’t done it in years, like they had lifetimes of lost time to make up for, because they did.
“Or are you high right now?” Draco asked, his voice thick with a sneer. “Are you going to splinch us?” Potter glanced at him, rolling his eyes with a spark of fiery personality Draco hadn’t realized he’d been trying to elicit from him.
Draco pulled away and climbed onto the island, sitting with his legs spread apart as Harry stood between them, his eyes darkening at their brief separation before he pulled Draco closer again, reconnecting their hungry lips and chasing his open hands down Draco’s chest and onto his thighs where he gave one tug and pulled Draco as close to the edge of the counter as possible.
His emerald eyes glint in the darkness. Everything about him seems to have changed. Draco can’t even recognize the man he’d had a drunken shag with a month ago. All of his awkwardness and vulnerability is gone, replaced by something fearful — something Potter has been all along, beneath the drivel of humanity.
He holds out an arm, and Draco crawls over to him. He lays his head in Potter’s lap and closes his eyes, feeling the magic vibrate off of him like a gaping chasm of magma.
“A Ministry list?” the man said, the corner of his lip pulling up like he had heard something very funny.
But something about the rhythm of Harry flitting in and out of his life — the bursts of aching absence that were followed with lush, delicious and understanding connection from none other than The Boy Who Did All That Stuff, left Draco almost drunk with desire for years. Until Harry left and didn’t come back.
And then, once again, he was gone.
They fuck in the men’s. Potter’s ridiculous dress robes have too many buttons. He turns Draco into the wall like he doesn’t want to see his face. Potter grunts in restraint when he pushes in, but Draco lets himself moan into the cool ceramic. When Potter finishes, Draco looks down to see purpling bruises where Potter’s fingers dug into his hips.
Though it was nearly impossible, Draco pulled away, sucking in a deep breath. Harry’s hair was even more of a mess, and it felt impossible not to touch again, impossible not to be on top of him, all over him, touching him desperately and greedily for eternities.
“You want more,” Draco says again as Potter stains his neck with pink kisses. “You could do so much. You could be so much.”
It was then that Draco learned how seamlessly Harry could weave in and out of his life. He’d come by Draco’s flat where they’d order takeaway, always together in private, and they’d learn about one another outside of the context of the Houses and Professors and battles and war. Some nights, they’d knock back firewhiskey and speak the common language that only survivors could parse, and early on Draco realized that he provided something that Granger and Weasley couldn’t, though even he wasn’t sure what it was.
When the yellow-haired man began to show up in the shop, something alighted inside of Draco. There was nothing particularly noteworthy about him, at least nothing that Draco could place. He tended to hover by the vials of premade potions in the window when the shop was busy, waiting for people to clear out before he made his purchase as if he was afraid of interacting with crowds, no matter how small.
“Fine,” Potter finally said, his mouth pressed into a thin, indecisive line. “Do you need a change of clothes?”
Draco latches his mouth onto his neck, flicking his tongue against Potter’s trembling skin. The next thing he knows, he’s being thrown against the room by an invisible burst of force.
“I’m looking for mermaid scales.”
Potter was scrambling after him as he strode back into the kitchen to get his shoes and the rest of his things.
Draco threw a hand up, not wanting a distraction, nor wanting to hear
“Oh,” Draco said, surprising himself with how charitable his response was. “Sometimes magic is mess.” He looked up, met the man’s reluctant eye. “It’s all about finding what calls to you.”
Potter sits next to him on the couch. “It’s going to happen soon.”
It wasn’t until he actually saw the state of Potter’s brewing that it all suddenly began to feel real. Draco eyed the small, messy desk and cauldron Potter had set up in his equally cluttered living room — and he couldn’t help but smirk.
It all just felt so rotten.
“Ministry list,” Draco said as Potter paid for his scales that day, just in case Potter wasn’t completely sure that Draco was onto him. He now understood why that threat never seemed to bear weight — because The Ministry would never prosecute him.
Draco blinked, unsure if Potter was being purposefully daft, or if he really thought that who was brewing his narcotic potions was why he was upset. He turned one of the vials over in his hand, and then replaced it before swiftly turning and leaving the room.
Draco doesn’t wait for Potter to figure out what’s going on, to resist. He grasps Potter’s hand in his, connecting their wounds. A stream of red winds down his wrist, a font of blood intermingled.
Draco climbs atop him. He presses his teeth into his bottom lip until blood springs anew and then presses kisses to Potter’s neck, leaving a trail of red splotches.
“I want to show you something,” Draco says.
“Draco,” he called, and Draco stopped, his hand on the door, giving Potter one last chance to say something — anything — that mattered, that could convince him this wasn’t a complete waste of his time.
Draco crept to the doorframe and watched as Potter stirred from his semi-conscious state and reached to turn the clock on his bedside stand toward him. Then Draco watched as another vial of his doctored potion came floating through the air into Potter’s outstretched hand, where he uncorked it, tipped it back, and was gone again.
Potter sucks in a lungful of air the moment Draco connects their fingers. Draco can feel it too: the expanse of magic, deeper than the rolling sea and twice as chaotic.
But the truth was, it was getting harder and harder to see Potter when he took the Nox —  the way he’d lie there completely vacant, like his soul was taking a vacation from being housed in his very body. The comparison was even more stark after the modified Nox had returned some vigor to his countenance.
“You’re right,” Potter says, teeth tinted red. “It doesn’t.”
“I won’t be here,” he said as Harry watched, chest rising and falling heavily, lust slowly clouding out of his eyes as his face grew more grave. “If you leave again. I won’t be here when you return.”
Potter pulls his hand away, looking down at it, dark with blood.

apartment, he realized immediately as he glanced around at her messy kitchen, the stacks of books that seemed to spring from every possible surface and cubby. She’d been training for some promotion in the Ministry or other, Draco recalled reading in
“Tell me,” Potter says.
“I was always rubbish at potions,” the man said, staring at the counter. “I find them quite finicky.”
“How did it start?” Draco asked eventually, and he knew Potter would know what he was talking about.
“What did you do to me?” Potter says.
“Right,” he said. “So do you like it?”
Potter sank into the small armchair that sat by the desk, and for a moment, Draco thought that he might fall asleep again.
Potter winced at that, but Draco gestured his confidence vaguely. “It’s safer than what you’ve been knocking back every —” he glanced around at the empty vials that were cluttering the room, the potions desk, the mantle, the floor. “Every single night by the looks of it.”
lauds him daily in glowing profiles of decadent praise.
Draco hates every single pub on Diagon, but he lets Pansy drag him out anyway. Potter sees Draco before Draco sees him; Draco catches him staring from across the room.
“Do you want to?” he breathes.
much, but not like this, and none of my Reviving charms are working, and we think a Propago Potion might help, but I’m not sure of the interactions, and so I wanted someone to check my work, but no one at Hogwarts will owl back, so I just reckoned —”
“If you don’t stop eventually,” Draco said. “You will die.”
“I said I would stay,” Draco said. “I’ll stay.”
“This is fucked up,” Potter says.
So it was true; she hadn’t been here before, yet she knew what she was looking for, knew where to find it. She glowered at him, clearly mistaking his confusion for scorn, and he couldn’t blame her, so swirled the two were within him.
“Have an audience?” Draco offered. “Potter, I’ve seen you at your worst, and I’ve seen you beneath that,” he said, recalling the times he’d been the one to put Potter there. “I just want to be around in case I’ve miscalculated anything; if I’m going to be the one who kills you I at least want to watch.”
Draco is braced for a
Then he looped his arm through Draco’s, and took them to his flat.
Draco snorted, almost too shocked at the casual way Potter broached the topic of their past to fully engage. “You did not,” he said. “You only vanished,” he said, adding, because he knew how much it would hurt, “It’s an art I see you’ve perfected these days.”
The rain starts without warning, and they’re drenched in minutes. Potter reaches for Draco’s fly, but Draco grabs him by the wrist.
“Will you come?” Potter asked suddenly, and Draco knew immediately that it was simply a favor, nothing more than an odd fraternity, and it made his insides twist. “Will you stay?”
Draco did clean — just a bit, careful not to move or mend anything that looked too personal, because the last thing that he needed was a reason to get even more involved with Potter’s life. He made tea on Potter’s stove and spent a bit of time checking some ledgers for the shop, and eventually he heard Potter stir in his bedroom around the five hour mark when the potion should be wearing off.
“I suppose so,” Potter breathed, and Draco soured as he realized the hurt in his voice didn’t bring any amount of pride or satisfaction; it just felt rotten.
Potter stopped coming by after that, and Draco figured it was only as to be expected. There was nothing Potter was better at than disappearing — his ability to remain a shrouded figure after the war had always been nothing short of impressive, considering often even the most advanced Wizards were incapable of locating him. His public appearances were always inconsistent at best, and he often didn’t even attend events that were thrown in his honor — though how could he, considering how many there were?
The man nodded. There were bags under his eyes.
“Malfoy,” she said as she approached the till.
“I haven’t made you do anything.”
“Take me,” Draco hisses into his bed. Potter could vanish their clothes with an errant thought, but instead he just shoves Draco’s trousers down around his thighs.
“Cast something,” Draco whispers.
“My business?” the man repeated again, glancing down at the sachet of scales in his hands. His face twisted solemnly, and Draco was almost a bit disappointed that it seemed so easy to talk him out of whatever illicit behavior he was obviously engaged in.
“No,” he said firmly instead.
Draco could see the thickening of passers-by even before Potter stepped into the shop. He tried to trace his movements through the distorting aged glass at the front of the shop. Potter reaching over to sign autographs. Dropping down to his knees to speak to a pair of young wizards. Posing for a quick photo. When he finally stepped inside, only a few of the crowd braved following him, he immediately fixed Draco with an awkward, apologetic smile, as if trying to explain in his eyes why it was often easier to hide. The contact felt immediately too intimate — he had grown so used to seeing Potter through the veneers of his potions, or vacant, high, and useless — and though he had always tried to avoid fantasizing about the next time he saw Potter, when he had, it wasn’t anything like this. Potter approached the till and then was interrupted, stopping again for another autograph as Draco felt his heart rise up into his throat.
That, too, will fade eventually.
He’d been working as an apprentice in the small potions shop for about a year now; it had taken him several years after the war to admit to himself that he needed
Potter turned onto his side, and when Draco glanced at him, he could see Potter was giving him a thankful half-smile. “Everyone’s waiting to see what I might do next,” he said. Draco thought of all of the witches and wizards prying at Potter, literally and figuratively yanking at him at every opportunity, and considered the amount of weight this might be placing on Potter, one that no nightmare or dream could fully encompass. “But maybe it’s just this.” He gave another of his deep sighs. “Maybe I just fade into nothing.”
“Right,” Potter said, apparently unperturbed. “They still call me in on loads of things.”
“Quiet yourself,” Draco hummed as he put his case down and took off his coat. “Ears everywhere. We wouldn’t want the entire wizarding community to find out about The Boy Who —”
“No,” the man replied immediately and smiled down at the scales Draco had placed in front of him. “No. Thanks,” he said, and he left.
Harry had leaned across the kitchen island and was kissing him before Draco even realized what was happening. It was gentle at first, then firm like it always was, Harry’s kisses just an extension of himself: heated, unwavering, and fearless. As Draco was just about to let himself reach up and tangle his hands through Harry’s hair, Harry pulled away.
As Draco went to the back to fetch them, too stunned to really respond, he could hear the two squabbling indistinctly. When he returned with the ingredients, Granger placed her hand over the bag as Weasley rooted through his pockets to pay. “And,” she said, her voice almost a whisper. “We need you.” She gazed up to him, locking eyes, and she didn’t have to say anymore; Draco immediately understood.
Potter shook his head immediately. “Course not,” he said. “I was always rubbish at potions.” He paused as Draco recalled his yellow-haired alter ego. “Actually filched it from the Ministry,” he continued nonchalantly as Draco pulled a stool up to the desk and began to pen through the recipe. “They were running a case to get it off the streets, and—”
The light years they treaded were orbits that would never intersect again, but from the spinning orrery, from Saturn’s gravity, Draco plucked off a dusty moon, heavily cratered. “Here,” he said, hoping the grooves in Harry’s palm might understand the scars along its surface, or that Harry’s skin might recognise the composition of its soil. “This one’s Pandora.”
didn’t work. Nor did any other Counter-curses Harry ever learned. Harry was about to try a Stasis Charm when a loud rumble rent the air above them—Harry looked up—and there it was, a fully-fledged Ukranian Ironbelly with her 50-feet wingspan, roaring and bearing down on them like a metallic landslide from heaven.
lantern up to hover, pulls the paperback free from his overcrowded plastic bag, flings a Translation Spell on its cover, and raises it to eye-level so that his face is hidden entirely behind the spine.
“There’s loads you need to do,” Draco says sulkily. “But no, as I said, that was purely accidental, and bold of you to assume that I need a reverse charm to see through your Polyjuice.”
“I’m not the one who calls the shots.”
Draco tucked a wayward lock of Harry’s hair back behind his ear. He looked steadily into Harry’s eyes when he asked, “Tell me, what is it that you want?”
At the back of her little hut, the Shaman’s herb garden was a roundabout woodland with a moss-coated well at its centre.
Going blank for a considerable amount of time, Harry watched Malfoy suck at its end, right where Harry’s lips had covered a moment ago—a lungful, hearty and swift. Panic built at Harry’s throat. He wanted to snatch the cig back.
Draco was tempted to halt just one second, just long enough for him to capture Harry’s expression. He waited for the momentary weakness to pass, and it did, rather smoothly, like a boat on a windless sea; Draco dived so that the gurgle of water was all he could hear.
“Sickle for your thought?” Harry asked, carelessly flipping down from the back of Betty the Bicorn. He tickled her chin for a good while before she huffed; made her way to the herb garden, tossing the tassel of her tail from side to side. Draco hated Harry a little more with each passing second.
prompt: space song
Now, Harry finally understood what he meant. He could dwell eternally in this replicated universe of his longing. Could not fathom how he had been operating all this time without a key in the ignition. However the Shaman might have warned them, Harry also knew there was no way anyone could be prepared for something like this ... this was the inflow of a lifetime of emotions.
Draco yelped, but no sound came out; water came in, then more came rushing through his lips. He couldn’t ….
“Not to poachers, maybe.” The way Harry’s eyes focused on him made him squirm. “Draco, you don’t have to prove yourself to anyone.”
Harry snorted. “And by the time I come back, she’d be well fed and you’d be gone. You know me so well, Malfoy.”
“Nothing.” Harry crouches down too; smoothes the flat of his palm along Draco’s bicep; then down, to fondle a knobbly elbow. “Ruin my missions. Poke holes all over my wards. Infest my dreams and prayers with your name. Whatever you want.”
“Don't you dare. I’m highly affronted by the suggestion that I might settle for anything less,” Draco said.
Their last stop was to a grumpy old Centaur, who was a bit mad, and lived alone in the wilds of southern Kazakhstan. He had diabetes, and drank wine whenever he felt thirsty—which was always. Draco suspected he’d filched them from the Muggle tourists, who sometimes stored bottles of them in their tents.
Beyond the row of white round tents was Lake Issyk-Kul, large as sea, and Harry could hear the din by the shore, where Arithmancers lazed about like lizards, enjoying the warm sun and the attention as they Amplified their hourly sportscast. Gamboling about in the lake were the dragons and their Solomonari who were either back from the Hunt or still preparing for it. Their happiness was practically in arm’s reach.
Droplets of water from the rain catch on Potter’s glasses, hiding his eyes. Draco presses his thumbnail into his own index finger, a spark of magic letting him push past flesh until a bead of red rises to the surface. Potter’s hand trembles as Draco repeats the action on him.
Potter smirked, and then it faded. “You know,” he said, his voice so low it was nearly a whisper. “I did try. I did try with you.”
Draco was waiting — as he had been for some time, he realized — for Potter to snap back at him; to bolster and brew and return quips and acutely targeted insults in the way that had been their language for so long, before and after the war. But he just nodded and looked at the vial in his hands, shimmering royal purple, and uncorked it.
— from his eye while Draco tried to decipher what in Merlin’s name was so funny. “Thank you,” he said, putting his hand into Draco’s, which confused him until he realized he was holding a fistful of coins, the scales in another. “I’ll take that under advisement.”
After some time passed, Potter expected Draco at the end of every week, and even had freshly brewed tea waiting for his arrival. Draco sat with him sometimes, and they spoke easily of simple things, of Quidditch semi-finals and the latest updates to the Hogwarts staff, not touching upon anything so fraught as family or, Merlin forbid, the future. Potter never kicked him out no matter how late he stayed, but would simply begin to drift toward the Nox Draco left for him on his kitchen counter as the nights grew long. He would slowly drift off or daze out, and Draco would take his leave.
“I’m yours,” Draco says. “I’m yours.”
Harry snorted at the honorific. “I’m taking you out to dinner,” he said. “Tonight.”
coincidence.
Draco blinked at him, his words coming out as almost a question. “That’s alright.”
Draco studied his face and found it revealed nothing — aside from a chiseled jaw and five o’clock shadow as well as a small twinge of awkwardness.
“Draco,” Potter started, and something caught in Draco’s throat with that, the combination of the use of his first name, the look in Potter’s eye, the discomfort of seeing this side of someone he had only seen in headlines and photoshoots for the past two years, so vulnerable, so afraid.
Potter looked up like he might say something, and then a small young girl was yanking at the bottom of his robes, chittering about wanting to see his scar. As Potter was swept back into the bustle of the crowd, Draco decided now would be a perfect time to busy himself with restocking in the back.
“It’s too much,” Potter says. He pulls at the collar of his shirt, like something inside of him is trying to get out, like he’s burning from the inside. For just a moment, the vulnerability returns, his grimace like that of a confused child.
Potter gently works his way from under Draco and climbs atop him. He kisses Draco’s hair and temple, slowly unbuttoning his shirt.
. Extinguished, like it took everything that he had to simply remain upright.
They’ve all known from the beginning how powerful Potter was. He only had to realize it himself.
“It’s hurting you,” Potter says.
Draco stays silent, his eyes locked on Potter’s.
“I didn’t know you — worked here,” Granger said slowly, and Draco felt himself flush. Granger had never forgiven him, would never; most wouldn’t, but she also wouldn’t pretend that she had like so many others did. She was probably judging the shop, he thought as he watched her glance around and take it all in, wondering what kind of an establishment would hire a filthy former Death Eater. Draco was rolling another half-insulting inquiry on his tongue when she spoke again, quietly, so close to him.
“Malfoy,” Potter said, a plea in his voice. Draco rolled his eyes and reached into his case where he produced three Shrunken vials of his own personal Nox.
But Potter didn’t vanish this time. Instead, a few weeks later, Potter walked in as himself.
But when he finally approached the counter to pay, Draco found himself immediately disarmed by his gaze. The fellow was good looking, yes, but there was something in his eyes — a deep, velvety brown - that made Draco forget how to string words together to form a sentence.
Draco was always good at potions; unlike many other things, potions made sense, as did the bulk of the rest of his life these days. It consisted largely of him working, far more than his parents found ideal for someone of his upbringing, but he refused to take another penny of their money. When he wasn’t working, he was tinkering in the makeshift potions lab he had created in the spare bedroom of his flat, having Blaise or Pansy around, or finding any other way to distract himself from the fact that this was
“And the owner has requested proof of identity for anyone purchasing scales,” Draco lied. “So it may be best to source your ingredients elsewhere.”
And it had been so easy, so painfully easy to just pick up where they had left off. It already felt like they had, and that maybe the only thing standing between them was Draco’s inability to swallow a grudge.
And Draco grew even angrier to realize that Potter didn’t even have the shred of self-awareness necessary to realize what he did to people.
“This way,” Granger said, her voice clipped. Draco followed her into her small living room, where someone was huddled on the couch. Unable to slow himself, Draco sped around to see.
“It should last the week,” Draco said pointedly. “It will simply have to. I happen to know that one of the ingredients you’re missing is a Suttonfruit that takes three weeks to ripen before use. Unfortunately, this seems to be your only option at present.” He slid the vials against the counter where Potter gawped at them, the irritation in his eyes slowly shifting into something that looked like horror.
The next time he came in, the yellow-haired man bought the mermaid scales alone. It was almost as if it was a challenge, as though he wanted some kind of comment, and Draco would admit that he was tempted. Many other shops were already limiting customer access to the product, locking them up behind counters and requiring identification or even Ministry approval to purchase. In addition to their dark associations, the scales were also insanely expensive —one sachet cost about a quarter of Draco’s rent.
“Sweet dreams, Potter,” Draco said, and he closed the door behind him.
— Granger trying to apologize for Potter even as he lay there in a trance, scrambling to justify The Savior’s behavior as always. Granger trying to explain, maybe, what on earth could justify Potter disappearing on him for
Potter kills a man the next day. It’s not on purpose — at least, Draco doesn’t think it is.
“I mean it,” Draco said at what he realized was the last opportunity to get through to Harry while his brain was still functioning. “I really mean it.”
Harry wrapped both of his hands around Draco’s, holding him tightly, pleadingly as he locked him with his gaze, and Draco found himself beginning to fall into those pits of silver green.
“Right,” Draco murmured, producing three more vials of his Nox from his bag. “I suppose these are for you, then.”
Potter stares at him for a long moment, and then kisses him. He catches Draco’s bottom lip between his. It stings where it’s been split. Potter sucks the blood out.
The pallid, scattered energy of the flat Draco had visited only a few weeks ago had entirely transformed.
“You won’t leave though, will you?” Potter asked, that same plea in his eyes.
Draco paused. He could only be disappointed with himself for ever thinking Potter might understand. Images of Potter sprawled about the couch that night, eyes wide open but entirely unseeing flashed through Draco’s mind and left a coldness in their wake. He was there, but he was gone.
thanks for reading!! hope you all made it out alive! :))
The moment he saw her slip through the door to the shop, Draco pondered what he considered each time this happened: packing up his things and moving to Scotland, or Morocco, or God, even America. Anywhere that he didn’t have to do this — to see the people he had been guided into attempting to destroy, to have it all wash back against him and then to have to chat with them and act like it never happened, though it was never quite like that with Granger.
Draco began coming round most evenings after work, sometimes delivering potions, other times not. For the most part, when he came by, Potter was a shell, whether because he was using or because he was swimming through the haze of after effects. Often, Draco came by to find him sleeping, and left just as quickly, not eager to discover whether this slumber would crescendo into a screaming fit or not.
“I had a nice time tonight,” Harry said after a moment, pouring a glass of whiskey for Draco and taking a sip of his own. “It was good seeing you without your being in the middle of saving my life,” he said.
Potter shows up at Draco’s flat the following week. Draco has never given Potter his address. He has a dense tangle of wards in place to keep intruders out. None of this stands a chance of keeping Potter away from something he wants.
But then Potter runs a finger across his palm, splitting it down its scar without breaking the kiss. Potter will heal it later, if there is anything left to heal. But for now, Draco gives him everything, and Potter will take and take until not a single drop remains.
Draco walks into the alley, and Potter follows. He knocks the cigarette out of Draco’s hand. Draco breathes smoke into his lips when Potter pins him against the wall. Potter doesn’t kiss like before. He kisses like he needs it.
Potter sighed again, long and drawn out. “I just need to sleep.”
Draco took his robes off to reveal a buttoned shirt and trousers, and then climbed atop the blankets in the bed next to Harry, who didn’t seem to mind the rejection of his attire, nor the fact that it implied Draco would not be staying the night. Potter spelled the lights out, and the two of them turned onto their backs. Draco knew that Potter was staring listlessly at the ceiling just as he was.
His hair changed in two parts, first turning a deep, rich brown and then recoiling back to its usual length, touseled carelessly against the couch. Then his cheekbones rose, his skin darkened, his eyebrows thickened, and his jawbones - if this were even possible - sharpened even more.
Sometimes when he came by, Weasley or Granger were there — more than once he’d Floo’d into Potter’s den while they were in the middle of conversation, Granger casting a gaze at him over her shoulder that could petrify Salazar himself as Draco deposited the Nox and left. One time, he walked in on Potter and Weasley sat on the floor of Potter’s kitchen, snickering mysteriously until Draco realized they were in the middle of a game of Exploding Snaps.
“Sure you can manage the crowds?” Draco asked, and though he’d meant it as a joke, the thought settled into his bones: Harry was willing not only to brave the public, not only to brave reality, but to do so with a former Death Eater — with Draco by his side.
And there was nothing he could do to change it.
Harry exhaled, deflating a bit, which brought Draco some amount of satisfaction. He caught a few glares from the Potter Heads who milled around the shop, jealously waiting until Potter’s attention would free up again. Draco considered playing dumb; for all Potter knew, the Polyjuice hadn’t worn off that night in Granger’s flat until after Draco left. Maybe he could pretend he didn’t know this secret of Potter’s, didn’t know anything about him, and then maybe this time he wouldn’t get sucked up into it again.
The man didn’t come the next day, or the next day, or the next. He didn’t come the entirety of the next week. But someone else did: Granger.
“Bedroom,” Draco reminded Potter one night as he uncorked a bottle after a long lull in conversation.
Draco laughs. Potter doesn’t like that. It shows in the way he crashes his lips against Draco’s, kissing him like it’s a punishment. He bites at Draco’s bottom lip until the metallic taste of blood fills his mouth. Potter pushes his tongue between Draco’s lips, greedy for every last drop.
Draco blinked, remembering his similar line of questioning from the other day. “I like the job fine,” he said slowly. “It’s easy in ways it needs to be, challenging in the ways I like. And there’s a future,” he added, “If I stay the course with my training.”
Potter nodded, his quietness slightly out of character, and Draco found himself wondering whether the side effects of the Nox were affecting him around the clock at this point.
His entire flat rattles riotously, like they’re locked in their own personal earthquake. Potter pulls Draco off of the wall and pushes him onto his stomach on the vibrating bed. Draco’s bed sheets twist into ropes and tighten around his wrists.
“We need Occamy teeth,” Granger squabbled out. Draco blinked at her, and she gave one of those exasperated pleading looks she always shot the other two.
Draco, at last, dragged Harry down onto the grass. “Stop that. You’re driving me crazy,” he complained. Reluctantly, Harry sat down as well.
“It will be, if you stick with me for a while. His wand had a dragon heartstring core, and bore a magical signature very similar to yours. We suspected it was the reason why your ward came down without a fight.”
“Shouldn’t you be a dragon?” Harry said, unsure.
“Would it?”
“Typical, but how did you … I was Polyjuiced for Merlin’s sake.”
“Don’t what!”
. Blushing, Draco briefly considers plunging back into the moon pool so he can languish away on the sea bed.
“Fuck you,” Draco said.
Yes to which? Maybe to all of the above. Draco did not want to know.
Very uncharacteristic is Draco's cooperation, almost waveless, as he folds himself back into the warmth of Harry’s chest, his fizz settling down.
Nothing happened.
Before Harry exited the garden through an arbour, a pale green plant growing by the footpath stopped him in his tracks. In the late summer wind, shooting up in dense spikes were silvery tufts of wormwood. Harry remembered just how bitter the plant tasted. Accidentally, he had once smeared wormwood infusion all over his lips in Potions class, and it …. Harry bent down and flicked at a young shoot curiously, an idea forming in his mind.
came whooshing outdoors. They took their time to drink, to reflect.
Harry turns away from the silvery world outside, because he already has the colour imprinted along the swollen rhythms in his heart. He aligns himself with Draco instead—forehead to forehead, nose to nose, a huff of laugh seeking its pouty better half.
“Not if we can’t make good use of our time?”
His hands cupped Harry’s face as he said that; it was very convincing. Those dawn-cold hands slid down along his cheeks, and then Draco was circling his arm round Harry’s neck, as if they were lovers.
Draco had been under Stasis and a variety of Potions ever since. The Shaman had to reach deep into his core to stop his Transformation in time, lest his body crossed the point of no return.
“Can’t it be both though? It’s us too, you know, the bond; it’s our history.”
Harry flopped down onto the grass, trying to keep his line of sight steady upon a spiky, gnarled shrub before him, where ripe apples dangled in clumps, all looking fresh and inviting. Draco picked one off from the dense tangle of branches. Inspected it. Harry’s eyes had remained levelled, which was quite a feat in itself, but his mind kept flicking up towards where Draco was.
Of course Draco can loiter about on a stormy night in Tokyo for all he wants, just because.
Harry nurses a fistful of
“A symbolic one, too?” Harry said wryly.
“Yeah,” Harry whispered, suddenly feeling sad, “I know that.”
Draco shrugged. “I’m hardly valuable.”
“What are you, then? I thought you might be a creation of magic.”
Harry found it somewhat amusing; endearing, too, but this was nothing new. “And I got you,” he teased.
“Pass-the-story? Guess it’s my turn,” Draco cut in with a forged nonchalance. “Under the Imperius Curse, they were manipulated to betray the dragon community—too clichéd? Or maybe, some were bought over to the wizards’ side? And there must've been moles among the Animagi, I'll bet.”
The Retrieve Hunt was supposed to be the highlight of the race. As the name suggested, competing teams could work solo or form alliances as they tried to sniff out traces of illegally poached dragon hearts, stowed away within the Tien Shan mountain range.
“No,” Draco says softly. “They don’t get to be loved. By me.”
“Fancy some refreshments, Harry?”
“Fair enough. Care to make a list?”
Wandlessly, he casts an
“It made you feel validated.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry blurted. It was a belated one, but it somehow felt relevant, with Draco thumbing the bridle thoughtfully, his fingers brushing along the brow band, the cheek straps, the throat latch … “You shouldn’t have to—I shouldn’t have brought that.”
Below, Harry’s fingers were fishing for Draco’s hand, which Draco refused to give, yet he felt rather grumpy when Harry gave up.
Harry took his time, reflecting, and found that he felt no anger. She was human after all, and had been there for Draco when no one else could.
“Take me with you!” the young man’s voice pleaded, now sounding faraway.
This small, snide voice in Harry’s head puts him in his place. Even when, obstinately, a part of him still earmarks the cloudy fringes of every forthcoming typhoon, waiting for the day he can carry one of them like a promise ring.
“You haven’t—” Draco asked.
Trout fish flitted by, silvery with a hint of blood-red along the lateral line of their bodies. Water swished softly around him. Everything was cast under a blue-green filter.
Eyes glittering, Draco revealed gleefully, “I saw my own ghost underwater.”
him, is all. Harry did remember soaking himself with a thorough Disillusionment Charm before following Draco through the trees and under a gazebo. Plus, the Polyjuice must still be running strong in his bloodstream. This new body is lanky and stiff under Harry’s command. After sinking onto the hardwood bench across Draco, there has been a dull ache spreading outwards from the lumpy bones in his bum. Harry can proudly say that his own is generally more impact-proof.
The scales were fading away from his face, and his wings were shrinking under the Shaman’s care, but not fully gone. At first, Draco had burrowed himself under his shelter of blankets, claiming that he looked indeed too hideous to continue existing on Earth. It was the only time Harry was allowed to go forth and coax him out for another vial of Core-stabilising Draught.
“I swear the garden’s usually quite organised.” Harry was still smiling—soon wasn't, when he caught sight of Draco limping. Draco was a little bandy-legged, having not fully recovered from his vigorous fit of bone remodelling; he was walking bare-footed because his elongated toes could not fit in his old shoes.
But Malfoy was saying “perhaps” in the way he only did when he was agitated … lying, usually, or when he’d had too much coffee. P-haps.
Another hearty gulp.
“Yes,” Harry said.
Their Bicorn knew the way by heart, and needed no spurring. The only time she slowed down her pace, it was to linger among a sunflower field. She sniffed longingly at the wide chequered faces, nudged the thin yellow petals with her muzzle, kicked the soil around playfully, before setting off again.
The Shaman was in the company of a woman around her age when they crunched slowly up to the small plateau of her hut. They were in deep conversation on the windy promontory, a wool rug spreaded out beneath them. On the woman’s shoulder stood a blindfolded eaglelet. When Draco stepped into the glow of the lamp, the eaglelet crooned, and the two women folded their laughter away.
Except Harry didn’t, and Draco couldn’t believe the excuse he gave was—
Draco’s head snapped up. “Do you?”
Still smiling at Harry’s grumpy face, Charlie gave Draco and Yulia a little wave, the hardness to him slightly misaligned then, sliding off just a fraction, and revealed from beneath was something that reminded Draco of a warm hug, something unconditional.
But Draco has already whipped them away, and they soon emerge on the other side—thankfully, in one piece, if a little shaken by the rough, soul-crashing push and shove of the vacuum.
“Then we’ll finally be free?”
Although all standard appliance spells were hard at work up here, whirring and groaning to generate more heat and oxygen, to cancel out the effects of wind …  they were only capable of doing so much. Harry glanced sidelong at Malfoy, who wasn’t even wearing gloves; those hands looked raw and vulnerable under the nipping air, and Malfoy had forgotten to cast a Warming Charm on himself.
march alongside Big Bi Basilisks, and
The HoverAid Stations, after settling down one after another by the shores of Lake Issyk-Kul, turned most of its wizarding parts into a temporary campsite. According to Malfoy, who had taken part in the design process, the Stations functioned a bit like the Knight Bus when travelling airborne, and, while on land, would appear as a modest row of yurts to the Muggle eye.
(See the end of the chapter for
Before him is the advent of the one and only subject in all his prayers, a stolen glimpse of heaven, an excerpt from his daydreams. Harry’s never been greedy, and he tries not to be ungrateful, but ever since his doubt has been smoothed out by the flat fact that this is
After their Station landed squarely upon the wizarding airstrip by Lake Issyk-Kul, Harry had filed a request to leave the campsite. He wanted to pay a visit to the Shaman’s hut; Malfoy wanted to tag along.
Of course Malfoy was thinking of himself, Harry thought, rather peeved. Even when Malfoy’s assigned Flyer was still suffering from the aftermath of his incompetence.
“Presuming that I even care—then maybe,” Draco replied, sticking his nose in the air.
a few of the key ingredients for his potion, Draco was recovering fast, and as soon as his physical traits were human enough, he could run errands for her.
He plucks them out one by one. It’s none of his business as to why Draco’s here (if not for Harry); why Draco’s not prowling the alleyways off Harry’s flat (which is under heavy Fidelius), or banging on his Floo network (locked and barred), or … or badgering the street lamps that must now recognise Harry by the loneliness framing his silhouette. He wonders if sixty four unreturned owls are exactly what it takes for Draco to fall out of love, so exhaustively, that he comes, unbothered by the potential presence/absence of Harry—like old snow, stoic under the short-lived tyre marks, for when another spell dawns in a white flurry, history will no longer mean a thing.
There was a low echoing rumble, and thick fog was rising from beneath. Harry thought he was about to be consumed.
Now Harry can see past the thick of the fray, where three silver stags are charging across the pumpkin patch, two of them identical. Beyond: the sun stalks over to the grey chimney the way it does, the way
“No!” Harry’s frantic shout is soon drowned by the wet, violent pattering, then, easily muffled by the warping of time and space. “You can’t Apparate on a typhoon da—“
“I’ll—“
It isn’t long before Harry locks eyes with another pair of bentgrass green, noon-dried, both of them slightly surprised by the mirroring determination they find across hours, thinking,
“But you know if Draco chooses to give, he’s going to do it with everything he has.” There was no hint of blame in her voice, like she was simply observing a fact.
Harry found Malfoy under a tree out in the campsite. He was having lunch. There were several magical yurts squatting sturdily before them, blocking them from prying eyes and passers-by.
The young man preened. “I
“Why the hell haven’t you renewed your license? The closing date was last Saturday.”
Draco means it as a joke. It comes out like something else—like a suggestion.
“It is natural to be curious, but some things are safer left unknown,” she said simply.
But their Sonos is blaring out some vogue anthem and Draco is dancing to it—oh, he’s dancing to it and Harry can’t tear his eyes away from the subtle, shifting lines under Draco's silver mesh top, from the beads of perspiration running down along Draco’s neck, from the amber glass of cocktail that casts a hint of crystalline light upon Draco’s wrist.
"It's okay. I hear you. Let me—" Draco untangles the Merman from the mess, who seems to understand that his handler is neither hostile nor predatory, and allows himself to be carried back to Draco’s base, where, without the ambient noise droning from all directions, the world clears up. A revelation shines through the hollow of the Merman’s voice, lingering. Draco could recognise him anywhere, how Harry breaths; the small annoyed hiss when he's in pain but doesn't want to show; the slight shake of his mop of hair, bringing the air around him into a briny rustle; droplets of water tinkling against his shoulders, sea spray against the shore. Draco would know him blind.
Harry’s train of thought clicked its joints together into motion before, again, crushing down into a pile of wreckage—without thinking, Harry used the leverage of Malfoy’s body to flip them around, and Disapparated with a dissonant slam.
Harry sighed. “You’re a handful, aren’t you?” He let his magic swirl around Draco’s lowermost spike—just inches before his withers. Slow circles. Draco tried not to surrender immediately under the spreading tingle. The exact texture and the sheer density of Harry’s magic surprised Draco every time, as though he hadn’t already formed a skin memory from it.
Unfortunately with the same pigheadedness they saw rodeoing and taming wild Graphorns a life challenge of theirs. Few had succeeded in Troll history; most ended up with a concussion.
Harry stared at him, not yet recovered from the daze.
Malfoy frowned. “But, what do you mean? It’s by far the best one I’ve got. It pulls me into that … state every time. Every morning. I can’t just cast it aside.”
His own ghost.
Harry was back. Draco knew it before he got to the door.
The Shaman’s healing magic, boosted by a regular intake of Core-stabilising Draught, could stabilise Draco magically and physically at where he was, but he would need another force within him to reverse the change, and that was where the Auxiliary Potion came into play.
It seemed so simple at this moment—Draco was here, and Harry was here too. But they had tried, and failed, and tried again, with Draco chasing him through centuries, through one body to the next, through one lifetime to the next ….
The Shaman tried again. “It didn’t bother you that the Hags were already calling you by the title Solomonar?”
Terribly invested now, Draco fixed a couple of quick Notice-Me-Nots on himself, before sneaking along the wall of books and artefacts towards a nook behind a mildewy cabinet. They were clearly arguing; Harry was taking a stance that, in his body language, could roughly be translated as defensive.
By the entryway, Draco stood unmoving under the autumn tree, almost like he’d never moved, but there was Harry’s duffel bag lying at his feet; Harry suddenly felt sick, feverish. It had been opened, the contents dug out, the canvas sagging. Draco was holding a pool of silver in his hands.
"You should ... you should learn to take care of yourself."
During summer, the city mostly reminds Harry of Draco, who likes taking steamy baths three times a day if possible. Tokyo’s also clean as a cat; here, even a fish market can be far shinier than Harry’s bathroom mirror.
"I've been told I'm rather awful at that."
“What’s wrong?”
“I’ll—” Harry didn’t know what was his to promise, and what was not. He shuffled to the edge of Draco’s woolly nest. “I could stay, for a while; but only if you want me to.”
“I’m not—” Harry yawned. He was in no condition to banter. He wished Malfoy could leave him be for a while, but of course he couldn’t. He never could, could he? Leaning forward, Harry rested his forehead against the steel tubings, savouring the icy sting from the thin film of frost upon its surface.
There were whispers of doubt, arguing that
Subjected to Betty’s clopping hooves was a steep gravelly trail, narrowly flanked by mountain slopes. An eagle patrolled its kingdom from above: patches of green; clumps of tawny.
“Asks the Saviour of the wizarding world.”
The pulley creaked as it spun feverishly in on itself to hoist up the bucket and the dragon heart. The rope was being eaten away by the wheel’s rim at an alarming speed, and Harry could feel their connection fading. The image of the young man flickered too, like candlelights in a gust of wind.
Under the permission of the Shaman, Madam Cholpon, Draco added a loo-size Wizard Space into the wall. He slept there now, behind the built-in bookshelves. Later, he even gave the cubbyhole a door and a charmed window. He no longer hinged his hope on the prospect of Harry coming back for him, for their theoretical bond. Life was good here. His time broke into a gallop whenever he practised Divination and basic Healing, and the idea of living in exile among the mountains as an apprentice Shaman did not bother him. Not in the slightest.
There, she’d rolled out a felted wool rug at the edge of a promontory that overlooked the foot of the mountain, a vast stretch of green plain. Further beyond, stood the city centre of Bishkek.
“This is not just a decade of wrong choices you will be facing. Many have gone mad from obsessing over their past lives. The simplest method will allow you to summon the apparition and see what it wants. Hopefully, some would find that enough to answer their questions, but most wouldn't. Most continue on their quest for a full explanation on life and death—if there was leeway somewhere in the process that they could take advantage of; if it was possible to retain their memories and magical powers even after rounds of reincarnation; if a weapon made from dragon heartstrings of the same soul-lineage would be able to create extremely powerful magic.”
“You’re not telling?” Harry asked just for the sake of making some noise. Not a thing—not a mote of dust here seemed to give a monkeys about them.
Harry shrugged, frictionless, as the answer had come to him. “It reminded me of your magic.” Potions was never a subject he could tackle by intuition before this; it felt infinitely strange.
The seasons were all messed up that morning—reversed. Betty trotted along by Harry’s side as he trudged through the reds and yellows of autumn, then late summer, smelling aerial and sharp. Last came spring, where an offshoot trail led them deeper into the centre, onto a stone-based elevation. It was damp and mossy; Harry cast a spell underneath his shoes, because he kept slipping as he approached the well.
Yulia was hit by a Conjunctivitis Curse. After that, not even a sliver of the conflict was registered visually in the memory clip. As Charlie’s Protego slid and fell away, however, the formless familiarity hardened into …
on humans? I used to think you couldn’t. Is that even normal?” Draco mused, evidently gravitating towards one of his chattier moods. “Is that even legal?”
“Long story,” Harry said. “Basically, I Summoned you out of the lake when the fog rose. Someone was watching us, I think. But he was shot by an arrow and it gave me a window to Rennervate you and Apparate us away. Actually, I have a feeling it was the Centaur who went there to check on us and made sure we got away okay. You know the rest.” The rest was a series of Apparition jumps. Draco gaped at him.
She stood up from the wood table, on which displayed all the prescriptions ready to be distributed today. She put a hand on Draco’s shoulder, squeezed it, then slid it gently towards his face, which she cradled, as if it were something precious. “No, my boy,” she said softly. “Your destiny lies elsewhere; this much I do know.”
When Harry woke again, it was on his bunk bed in their cabin; it was nighttime, and the rumours about Malfoy had swiftly colonised the Station before reaching Harry in no time.
a backup plan, to say the least. They’d come hastily, and didn’t even have an agreed-upon meeting place after Disapparating, or signals to call for help. No one would know where to find them if they didn’t make a safe return by dinner time.
On the circular masonry of the well, Draco’s ghost perched at the edge, where it most certainly had been empty just seconds ago.
After Harry Apparated back to the campsite, his absence continued to fold itself in the fusty snugness of the Shaman’s hut. It multiplied with each turn of Draco’s thoughts. It hung in the air.
“You have to … quick, you have to promise ...” said the young man again, still holding on to the unstable flux of his existence.
“Can you cast
Cutting through the opaque landscape was a blade-shaped curse, a thin, pale gold sheet of light that came at Harry, rotor-like. If Harry Apparated them away, there was a good chance that the curse would get sucked in by the vortex, and would then hit one of them before they got to their destination. But before Harry could test a nonverbal
Harry’s stomach sank; Draco did not even bother to hide his confusion. “But it was—” he struggled for words. “It was me. I could feel it. It was a part of me. I know it sounds silly, but I know—”
“Yes,” Draco said loudly. A bit louder than he intended; he cleared his throat. “Isn’t this what you want too? I can give you this, if it’s what you want. A bonded dragon.”
He had no idea what to do with it. Why it came. Was he jealous of Harry, who suddenly looked elegant and peaceful without the burdens of the war? Was he jealous of the dragon, who had easily secured Harry’s undivided attention?
Betty the Bicorn was appointed to escort them to the gate. Again, because no other would. The Shaman confirmed Malfoy’s dragon dung theory; Harry wasn’t pleased. But Betty seemed happy enough when she saw them, and Harry gave her chin a good tickling.
“Maybe—I dunno …” Harry had a horrible feeling that she was trying to impart an answer that was incredibly simple but somehow he was unable to grasp. He stared at the smear of dirt on Malfoy’s sleeve. It did not rearrange into legible words. “Maybe I wasn’t prepared enough? Maybe they were … far away? I don’t know.”
“But now?”
“I don’t know if I should be angry with myself,” Draco said in a low voice, like it was a conspiracy theory. The syllables were puffed out softly just inches away from Harry’s skin. “I’ve yet done anything grand without you either wrecking my plan or getting it done for me halfway, Harry.”
house—“ That was Madam Cholpon. Draco never knew her to speak to anyone like that before, with such a level of disgust in her voice.
“It was stupid, I know, not to mention incredibly selfish. Let’s just forget—”
“Race me to the top,” she challenged, assessing Harry with a piercing sidelong glance. Immediately beneath Reni, the pointy Ridgeback started pumping her wings fiercely, the force of it sending waves of snow onto Harry’s face. He tried to catch his breath, but sucked in a mouth-full of icy droplets and damp wind instead.
Was Draco this lovely before? Harry didn’t know; he had never thought of Draco in either a romantic or sexual way, or at least if he did, he never did it consciously.
The clash of metal suddenly rang through the air.
His back and arms were exposed, only a pair of trousers clinging to his sweaty legs. Harry was sitting crumpled up on the floor, pain angrily flaring in every part of his body.
reach the end of the hardened road though, he realized that he really
"Right," Harry said, dryly.
With one last regretful rumble the sky cleared up, leaving only blue and the sun shining brighter than before.
Sadness glazed over Dorian’s eyes for a moment and not long after he suddenly turned around and began leaving the hall, pushing people aside in a hurry to get away from Harry.
Another shadow moved through the blinding light.
He spotted the Captain: grey eyes, sunkissed hair, arched brows and an expression that was strangely close to concern.
They ran through streets upon streets, and even though Harry’s breath had started wearing thin and shallow, he couldn’t allow himself to stop. Adrenaline ran through him driving him to keep pushing harder. Panicked and alert he stopped focusing on finding the most clever paths and roads to get rid of the man panting behind him, instead Harry was now focussed on just keeping his speed up. He never stopped for anyone, not even when men riding carriages swore at him and cursed.
The Captain's eyes seemed to pierce Harry's with all the intensity that they harboured. "Yes, he's… a criminal, to put it lightly. It surprises me that you don't know about him yet." He paused looking away from Harry for a second before continuing. "You're not the only person in the world with powers you know?"
boys, for that matter, was harder, way harder.
It was far too late though.
Blaise seemed to think this over for a second. “Valencia.”
, Harry thought as he walked back to the Gryffindor common room. Tomorrow was the ball and he, in fact, did not have a mask yet.
“What’s wrong with dating people from other houses?” Neville asked from the opposite side of the table as people around the hall started going back to chattering amongst each other, some still throwing sneaky glances at Harry.
“Right,” Pansy broke Harry out of his thoughts. “shall we get started then?”
Harry could feel the familiar lighting seep into his skin as he welcomed the storm. He smiled when he recognized the storm beckoning him, knowing that they'd met many times before.
he couldn’t help but feel content in some strange way.
-Amber
The Captain was quiet for a second, as if hesitating. “He-”
Hi, welcome back !  Thank you for sticking around :) welcome back to this rollercoaster of a plot heheh
“What did the Captain tell you?” Ron asked, his eyes glistening.
"Why does it look like it's aiming for us?!" the dark man, that the Captain had called Blaise, cried out.
He could barely hear Harry's hum in reply as he flicked the light on in the bathroom, momentarily blinded. Shutting the door with care, so the stark light wouldn't disturb the man on his couch, Draco let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding, the gust shaky and rattling in his lungs before escaping. The sides of his porcelain sink protruding from the wall were smooth and cold beneath his palms as he gripped it for dear life.
"You're holding that awfully close to your face. Either you need glasses or you're hiding from me."
When the waitress asked if they wanted a booth or a table, Harry turned to look at him with raised eyebrows, allowing him to pick.
"You have to sign," he explained, presenting the form to the taller man.
"You're a right fucking wanker, sometimes, Malfoy." Harry's mouth, the cupid's bow of his upper lip, curled back defensively. "And you talk big, but you need to take some of your own goddamned therapist advice."
"That's the exact issue, I think this department could be built into something...bigger."
Harry scratched the back of his neck a few times before turning to see what was irritating him. Crookshanks flicked his tail again just as Harry moved, and he received a face full of ginger fur for his trouble.
"They're getting back at you for the Christmas prank," Hermione said, trying to get it through the boy's thick skulls to stop the war before it began. "You did tell them, and I quote, to
"Thank you for your vote of confidence. I'll have you know I have complete control of my magic now."
Throwing his arms over his head, Draco let the surge of adrenaline still filling his ears with ringing and his muscles with violent energy push him to pull his own sweat-soaked shirt over his head, throwing it harshly onto the floor.
"It's a muggle thing, Draco, and since it's Christmas Eve and you haven't hung a stocking yet…I thought I would make you one."
Draco chuckled a little, understanding completely the overbearing nature of his rival-turned-friend. Hours poring over the Archives of the Ministry during his first year in rehabilitation, spending almost every hour with her, had ground down his patience and reshaped his perception of her entirely. He stared at his soup for a few more minutes, eating another couple mouthfuls, before his head started spinning and his eyes stung with exhaustion. He pushed the tray away gently and painstakingly adjusted himself in order to sit up further on the bed.
"Of course," he said cheekily, his breath coming a bit more rapidly from excitement. He was free! "The end of my rehabilitation means my accounts are my own again, so I could fund the changes myself. I could even get decent coffee in here."
Draco glanced at him, a trace of venom in his glare, but he understood. "Special circumstances."
? There was no name?"
"Why did you call me in?" Draco asked, absently reaching one of his long arms over to Lorna's desk to grab one of the chocolate biscuits there.
"Stop and
Throughout the formal proceedings, Percy read a long list of duties now expected of Draco as a fully rehabilitated member of wix society, and Draco agreed to uphold each to the best of his ability. A bitter and metallic taste was on his tongue throughout, but he could see the comradely sighs of annoyance Percy released on his behalf after several of the more redundant ones, but pressed on to be free of the invisible manacles of relative indentured servitude.
Without breaking contact with his warm hand, Harry nodded, some of the anxiety releasing from his gut.
"It's just bubblegum," Harry said. He stuffed the pack back into his jacket pocket where he was sure Sirius had kept cigarettes.
"Do you need me to help you?"
"Without the right access, those opportunities weren't...afforded me until recently."
Draco still had his hand on his arm, so he gently grabbed it and removed it so he could take a step backwards. The slight gap between Draco's slips snapped shut as Harry moved away, and his guilt twisted even tighter at the bereft expression on the man's face.
"What's this for?" Harry asked, his moment of wakefulness not extending, now that the threat of danger disappeared. Grabbing the fleece, he looked to it and then at Draco, who'd stood up as soon as the wand was no longer pointed at him, his arms crossed defensively.

floating through the air."
! I want to move forward from this, away from the idiots we were and maybe make something good? Excuse me for thinking we were becoming...at least better. I'd settle for friends, if that is all I can get."
"This is my stop actually," he said smoothly, slipping on his most charming smile. "I've come to see someone in Magical Games and Sports about leprechaun gold. Got to be proactive, only a month until St. Patrick's Day, you understand."
Blaise was having a hard time breathing as he replied, "Yes, yes of course! Little compulsion never hurt anyone."
"Did you need help eating your sweets, then? Is Padma overloading you with treats again?"
Harry chewed slowly, savoring each bite of his sandwich in unhurried happiness, and raised his eyebrows at Draco who realized he was staring again. The words he wanted to ask were choked at the top of his throat and he couldn't take another bite until he'd asked. He took a deep breath and looked at Harry with a stern expression.
"Draco, stop being so squeemish."
Harry looked down at his date as he walked along another garden wall on the way home from the cinema. "Well, you see, Draco, when a man loves a woman-"
"Yes, and you probably need help standing."
"Thanks, Henry. That bag's got fridge things."
Direction continuation of chapter 5
Draco sighed the sigh of a man who'd had quite enough of someone's martyrdom bullshit. His longer legs kept pace with Harry's vengeful strides with ease. The streets of Rome echoed with the sound of Auror boots hitting damp pavement, street lights only barely illuminating the alley they were cutting through to get closer to the checkpoint.
"We'll see whose technique works better during the next game, won't we?"
"Lorna, dear boy. The next time you say that name I'll put grounds in your coffee."
lingered in his office long after Lorna walked away.
Looking down, a sheepish blush appearing on his neck, Draco's voice didn't waver when he said, "It's unfortunate I had that many to process, really. Makes the whole holiday a bit painful."
The coffee in his other hand, in a travel mug he'd gotten for Christmas that year from Granger, filled the small space with the rich aroma of a dark Italian roast. He couldn't open the memo with only one hand, and he was not about to set the mug down with how greedily one of the witches was inhaling the scent. However, he could make out his first and last name written in untidy scrawl over the top, without a return department on the other flap, as was customary.
Harry crossed his arms in front of Ron, before the redhead lost control completely, the red letter still crushed in one hand and addressed to the shop in Diagon Alley.
The notion of spending a week in his flat with Harry made his already twisted stomach flip.
A slow blink from the man whose eyes she was staring into worked as well as a slap to the face. Imploring her mouth to form the words, she blurted, "Of course!"
After this, there will be one more chapter and the epilogue <3
"What does he have that I don't?" Ron demanded.
"Whoa there," buzzed against his shoulder. The feeling of Harry's voice against his neck, that line of skin behind his ear, was more heavenly than the few moments of solitude, before interruption. "You're dead weight. Hold on."
Slamming the door to his flat, Draco continued the litany of self-depreciation out loud instead of in his head like he'd done the last seven hours since his encounter with Harry in the lift.
Rushing over to the lower entrance to the locker room, Draco hunched his shoulders up and didn't breathe again until he was safely down the hallway and among the solitude of metal lockers and empty showers. The air pulled through his nose sounded explosive in the otherwise quiet room, and he tried not to think about changing his clothes with Harry only a few dozen yards away.
"It's nothing," Harry insisted, hating his skin for blooming in a blush so easily. He couldn't get the memory of Draco grabbing his arm out of his head, the memory replaying over and over again in his mind the last several days. He'd hoped pulling one of his favors in the clerk's office would rid the intrusive thoughts, but it had only served to place the way Draco looked when he smiled, or waved his hand at him when he insisted he was paying for lunch, though he knew he was on a fixed income with the rehabilitation.
[a/n] July 30th, 2016 guys this amount of writing usually never happens. But I am so excited for Harry's birthday you get three chapters today!
"I'm going to...I'll just...excuse me."
Today, the lackluster coffee in the break room was enough to make him feel almost alive, and the much shorter list of names with appointments was close to bringing an actual
. "Malfoy, don't do that," Harry said, pressing on past the discomfort and anxiety, desperate not to take five steps back when he thought they were taking so many strides towards civility, the reason he put in a good word for him in the first place. "I did it because I wanted to. What good is this stupid Auror position if I don't do some good with it? I hate the stuff here I can't fix, and Hermione is helping me, especially now that I'm living with her, to try to find out ways I can help. I'm pants at this, I'm not a Slytherin like you and Blaise. I'm like a bull in a fucking china shop and -
But Harry wasn't listening, pinned in a pile of snow beneath his boyfriend on a walk home from a wonderful date, he pulled Draco down for a kiss instead of answering.
An inelegant snort burst from Ginny, and she turned back to her book. Resettling into her seat, her leg brushed against Pansy's, the denim of her jeans rubbing coarsely against the fabric of the Slytherin's knee-high stockings.
The question startled him enough to answer honestly, breaking his focus on the clean, though slightly bitten, nails on the hands he was definitely watching, . "Not really."
"Twenty hours?" Draco croaked. Hermione's final conversation warning him about the side effects slowly piecemealed back together in his brain.
June brought her wine glass into her room, breaking her own rule of no food or drinks except for water in the bedrooms, and silenced the world outside both literally and figuratively. Her fuzzy clothes and the warmth from the wine soothed her hurt feelings, and she hoped she'd get moved out of her department before she had to see Draco Malfoy ever again.
Several silent moments passed as Blaise waited for Draco to greet the Auror as well, and he turned to chastise his friend for blatant rudeness, when his mind went into rapid-fire.
Prompt from blaiddseren
"Did you sleep alright, Malfoy?" Harry asked, his voice smoothing from sandpaper to the feeling of a very dry bath towel running over your arms, still sending Draco's hyperactive mind into fits of distraction.
Swallowing, pushing up from the floor, knees shaky from more than just exhaustion, Draco said, "Of course, just need to use the loo."
Harry didn't seem to notice, only the shock of curly hair and his nose appearing from the top of the blanket. "Go to bed, Malfoy. It's two in the morning and I need to sleep before work." One eye cracked open to look at him blearily. "Unless you need something?"
"Fuck!" he screamed as he lowered the power, shutting off the gas completely.
The scent of Chanel
Lorna lightly smacked the highest part of him he could reach, the meat of his shoulder, and chuckled as she trotted back to her office. He could see a small flock of notes waiting for her as well, hitting the door insistently, and all of them unceremoniously fell ontop of the already mountainous piles of paperwork. He sat down heavily in his desk chair, summoning his coffee from its perch, and sighed happily at the task before him. Several weeks stood between his department and Valentine's day now. Without the extra witches and wizards filing through the office, he had both time and energy to devote to the happy distraction before him.
but they weren't even looking at any of us!"
"Fred and George sent me a literal bag of their dicks. In various chocolate flavors!"
With a pop, Harry brought his mouth away from the chocolate, licking his lips where the white frosting lingered, slowly picking up each taste, keeping eye contact with Draco the entire time.
Draco hummed to prove he was listening to her chatter, and the feeling tickled his lips and made him start to chuckle, which tickled the rest of him until he started to laugh uncontrollably.
Shaking his head and slowly making his way back to his bathroom, Draco muttered, "Not right now, no."
"I KNOW WHAT THEY RUDDY WELL ARE!"
"Fuck off, Potter."
He ignored the note, moving it to the bottom of his

Harry immediately curled towards the back to press his face into the soft fabric.
"Is that so?"
October 2nd, 2016 - This is the chapter not available on FFN. Enjoy!
Hermione covered her mouth as she saw what Draco was attempting to hide, but was too slow to say anything before his struggling arm moved around his body to present the white chocolate shaped-
The snort that left Harry's lips made a raspberry sound followed by a true guffaw. "You must have hit your head when you fell. Hermione will kill me if I don't take care of you, she would be here but -"
"Absolutely n-"
"Name?" he asked, burying his face in his paperwork.
"Auror on duty," Hermione said, to save Harry from himself.
"I've not flown in a while, myself, but Ginny asked me if I wanted to run drills with her while the Harpies are on break for a few weeks."
He smacked his lips a few times, shuddering at the taste of food and tea in his mouth gone sour. The incantation to cast a breath-freshening charm on himself was halfway from his lips before he remembered the burst of flames out of his stove. It would not do to lose his teeth in some freak mint-scented accident, as they took two days to grow back properly. Self-preservation won out and he stumbled out of bed towards his bathroom to brush his teeth.
"Send them down, please."

Draco's quill stuttered, but continued to skitter over the parchment, words exploding in dark ink over the crisp form. "Length of relationship?"
"No. Living arrangements?"
"It's funny, Ron!"

"Broom was confiscated," Draco replied, trying for nonchalance and landing on bitter. "Haven't purchased a new one yet. I hope they donated my Nimbus to Hogwarts, at least. The brooms they expect first years to learn on are atrocious."
At least she had another bottle of wine waiting in the flat, hidden in her bedside drawer.
The hallways were full of wix on their way to their lunch break, a clock several meters above their heads chiming noon in the Atrium. He counted the chimes in his head like he always did at noon, adjusting his steps to move in time with the rhythm. The lines were too long at the lifts and he refused to Floo if he could help it, so he made his way to the solitary desk near a set of black doors, nodding to the witch at the counter. She glanced up from her book
Harry couldn’t bring himself to consider the Captain’s statement properly because his mind started clearing up and with it: his panic started rising, coiling around in his stomach as he was reminded of everything he’d been through. Harry’s breathing started speeding up and wearing thin at the sheer thought of having to redo everything he’d already been forced to do. The scars on his skin rose, presumably lighting up beneath his clothes. “Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, fuck.” Harry let out a string of curses as a tear rolled down his cheek. “Not again-I can’t-Not again-” The devastating feelings of panic were so strong that the couldn’t do anything apart from mutter out words and let the tears streak his cheeks.
“Bloody well looked like it,” The Captain answered, but even though it was clear that the remark was meant to be slightly cutting, his tone was too soft.
“Wow,” Harry gasped out in wonder, amazed by the sheer beauty.
still available for you.” Ron’s gaze was filled with pity now, almost overwhelming Harry with the intensity of it.
know him. It was undeniable who he was now, seeing as there was only one of him in this world.
“Who are you?” Harry asked the stranger next to him, voice filled with awe and genuine curiosity.
Blaise smiled,
The door to the space that Harry was in was softly pushed open, light from upstairs blinding Harry slightly as he saw the silhouette of a long haired woman stepping into the room. She calmly walked past him, not even seeing the barrel he was hiding behind, and grabbed the rope in the corner, cutting a piece of it off with one sharp pull of a knife.
-Amber
What followed was Eduardo chasing Ron and Pansy all over the main deck while cursing them in Spanish. It was rather a spectacle really, and Harry couldn’t help but smile to himself.
“One of the members used to sleep here, but he left the ship and instead decided to stay at…,” Neville started before breaking himself off. “Oh well it doesn’t matter, just know that that bed is free, so you can sleep there.”
Luna turned around slightly, smiling softly, but shook her head, indicating a no.
Before he could make any more decisions on where to go, he heard a sharp voice speak up behind him.
He was so utterly fucked.
Harry lightly took her hand and she pulled him upwards, supporting him when his muscles still refused to move. Luna had the rope in her other hand, but her knife was now tucked away in her belt. She was using the hand she had used for wielding the knife to hold Harry up, until his legs regained their ability to move.
Harry stood at the railing of the deck for another hour or so, thinking about nothing in particular, hypnotized by the waves below, until a certain scent broke him out of his trance.
