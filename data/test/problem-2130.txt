The lake’s water is mucky and green with algae and old shit. I never got to see the ocean with you, and this is the closest I’ll get.
Father laughed. “He’s a half-blood orphan, twenty-one, and dirt-poor. Crabbe and Goyle ran a background check, and there’s nothing
I groan quietly and arch forward.
The tips of Harry’s ears are bright red. He smiles sheepishly. “Did you uh... hear any of that?” He rubs the back of his neck and looks down at the floor.
“We could teach her,” Harry suggested. “Bring the knives, the torches,
I turn away from the window and look at the street—all normal shit. Turn back. Face the window. Take a step back. Maybe I’m standing too close to properly see myself.
You grimace and close your eyes as you lay back against the headrest. “Mmm. I don’t want you to do anything, Draco,” you say, slow. It’s a fucking lie. “Robards and Kingsley don’t care if I shoot up as long as I show up for the job. They said they’ll even supply the Dreamless for me so I always have enough.” You grin, but it’s not very happy. “I’m the bloody Saviour, so I can do whatever I want, right?”
“Sirs, please!” Switzly interrupted hastily. Her face was a few shades greener than her normal pigment. “Switzly does not want to see that again,” she said, shaking her head. “All that blood… Those noises...” she shuddered.
I take a look at Tosser through one of my mirrors again. He looks as if he’s about to spew the contents of his stomach all over my bus.
“Hmm,” Harry said. “I was thinking about starting with the Fiendfyre blow torch and Draught of Living Death?”
husband onto the store’s sample mattress. “Mmm. You are a
“Alright.” You lean against the doorway, looking me up and down. “You going to wash up?”
Although I did suggest to Barbara that we dance the Mamushka at the Holiday Ball, but she said she didn't know what that was!” He frowned. “Another reason why I think there’s something off about that woman.”
“Damn, that sounds fun for when they come to visit,” Harry said. “And I know Hermione always enjoys playing with Sheila,” he added. “If her screams are anything to go by, I mean,” he chuckled.
Harry read the sign on the cage. “
My eyes burn with that heavy sleep feeling. I smile and tell him to get some rest.
I suppose that would be alright.” He gasped as Draco bit down on him, harsh and stinging. “
But before Harry could really start up again, the store owl returned from her trip to Hogwarts. She swooped down and perched herself onto the Quidditch supply shelf before them. Then she screeched at them— loud and piercing, the kind of noise that easily rips your eardrums in two.
“Rotsely’s note is very short. He says:
You struggle to pull on your sopping wet muddy boots that you always insist on bringing into the room. You almost fall as you put your left boot on your right foot, shaky and sweaty. Normally, I’d laugh.
Switzly interrupted before they could start up again. “If sirs are finished, Switzly can take you to the registers for checkout.” She looked at them, hopeful.
Draco smiled and pushed his very
the blades till they're red, and all that.” He was starting to look a little bit more excited. “And we can bring Sheila again too, like last year,” he said, hopeful. “She had such a fun time last time.”
Harry grabbed hold of Draco’s arm and began pressing his mouth all over the tips of Draco’s fingers, to his hand, down his arm, then up his bicep to his neck. He was loud; violent, almost. Draco threw his head back as he gasped and smiled, eyes closed. He looked like he was thoroughly enjoying every second of it.
“I agree, Father.” Draco took a deep breath in. He did not agree; he had never gone to see that bloody hack of a Mind Healer.
“We’re actually going to be here a while longer,” Harry said. He watched as his new plants hungrily chowed down on each other’s petals and stems. Harry leaned over the cart and poked a baby geranium’s fang. He cooed as it growled at him.
Before Draco could respond, Harry laughed. “Not really. Dean’s one of my mates, though. We dance at the White Swallow together. The pay is awful.” Harry paused to let a kitten nibble on his finger. “Dean flinches every time someone draws their wand now. But he’ll be alright.”
“Fuck,” I mutter. The glass is warm and smooth against my hand, but I wish it was sharp so it could slice me open until I bleed out. “What is it, then?” I hardly recognize my voice, it’s so dry and brittle. “What do I say?”
Draco and Harry exchanged bemused glances. Draco laughed. “We don’t know yet.”
“Oh Vernon, did you hear?  It’s dreadful—the train’s out of order. And just when we were planning to visit Marge this weekend.”
“I’m not sure whether I should laugh or cry,” I say, gruff.
I started volunteering at a magical creature rescue the next day.
“Strange woman; very…
,” he said. He turned to face Draco. “Do you think we should buy a few for Monday and Rotsley?”
His lean fingers stroke my cock through my slacks, insistent and relentless.
“Yeah, we still have some stuff we need to buy,” Harry grinned. He stopped leaning against the shelf and took a step away from it, moving into the aisle of the store instead. He turned to look at Draco, who was watching him, heated and wanting. “We just got a little...
Maybe he’s got bad ears too. Maybe I’ll buy him something to eat. I’ve got a couple of Sickles left on me. There’s a dirt-cheap vendor a few shops away from him. I can check my reflection in the window. Make sure the Polyjuice hasn’t worn off.
“Yes, the Quidditch aisle is that way, sir,” Switzly nodded, watching them tentatively, like she thought Draco and Harry might start slamming each other into walls, or creature food shelves, or mattresses again. Only they’d be naked this time, and it would be horrifying for everyone except them.
,” Harry smirked. “If you know what I mean.” He exchanged a filthy, lecherous look with Draco that probably should have stayed private.
I take a sip from my glass, wincing at the pungency of it all. I force myself to swallow it down. Then I nod and smile and say thank you, I appreciate that.
I was happy for him when he got the promotion. It’s funny; everyone expected it to be me when I was still on the force, but I never liked that job much.
“Mmm.” You close your eyes and sigh. “I need a fucking drink.”
It’s a good thing that I’m in this bloke’s skin because no one really sees you when you don’t mean anything. People only see you when they want you for something.
“Me too,” Harry grinned. “When we stood on the ledge of the Astronomy Tower, held up our umbrellas, and waited for the lightning to come.” His hand rested on Draco’s lower back, then crept lower and lower… and lower.
, after everything, but he really thought that Harry understood, but clearly Draco’s been irritating him and he should just leave,

for it; we couldn't resist the temptation.”
I remember it well,” Draco said, enthralled. “I do sometimes wonder if Umbridge’s hair ever grew back after that charming little incident.”
Perhaps I’ll start with… five thousand Galleons,” Draco smiled, looking at Harry knowingly.
,” Harry said, amused.
“Family is everything, Harry,” he said, looking at me sadly. “I wish you would reconsider.”
“Absolutely,” Harry said. He pressed his mouth to Draco’s arm again, teeth out and ready.
“Thank you,” Draco tells Andromeda as he takes his hands from under the blanket and takes the cup. It’s steaming, and Draco sniffs up the steam. It smells good, and maybe it won’t be a hardship to drink it once it cools down a little.
Harry takes care in writing his notes. He thinks about the words more than he would ever think about something he would write for one of his essays or tests. These words seem more important than paying attention in class. They are more important than anything else.
Dear mom and dad,
“Yes, Weasley, he is. Always has been and always will be. And if it’s up to him, he will only marry one person in his life, but that idiot has told him that he doesn’t want him. So now he’s been sulking for a week, ignoring his schoolwork and being a massive pain.”

Sunday 23 April 1995
“You can’t trust the Dementors,” Remus explains. “They have different standards than us. If they think you are guilty, they won’t hesitate to hurt you.”
Draco lets go of Harry and sits up a little straighter. He turns so Harry can see him. “What’s wrong?” he signs.
“I don’t understand,” Harry says next to Draco. “Everything was fine. He’s still sick all the time.” Draco can hear the tears in his words, knows Harry’s heart is breaking. Harry’s free hand strokes some of Draco’s hairs out of his face, and then his thumb slides over Draco’s cheek.
When everyone had left I wandered around the grounds for a long time, wishing I had brought my invisibility cloak so I could stay out after curfew and sneak into the dormitory after everyone was already in bed and asleep. When I passed the broom shed I ran into Fred, one of Ron’s brothers. He asked me how I was and I told him I was fine, that I just didn’t feel like going back to the castle just yet. I think he understood what I really mend, that I wasn’t ready yet to get beaten, again. So he gave me his broom and told me to fly around for as long as I wanted. And that’s how I started flying around the ground, close to the forbidden forest. And you will never believe what happened next. I spotted professor Snape sneaking into the forest. I flew into the forest, but the trees were too thick for me to see where Snape had gone. I circled around until I heard voices. I landed in a tree nearby and listened. Snape was threatening professor Quirrell. They talked about getting past Fluffy and some other hocus-pocus. So that must mean that there are more things protecting the Sorcerer’s Stone than only Fluffy. The only problem is that Quirrell will not be able to keep standing up to Snape, I’m sure of it. Quirrell is scared of everything and Snape can be very scary.
Draco nods and then takes his Potions textbook from his bag. Harry follows his example and soon they are both bent over the book while Draco tries to explain to Harry how to make a Wideye Potion. The potion has two steps, but Harry keeps messing them up.
“It’s a small home. You might be able to,” Draco answers. Teddy nods in conformation and picks up a bright green crayon. He starts outlining a house with his tongue stuck between his lips. Draco looks away, out of the window. The neighbour's house has a garland in front of the window. Draco spotted it this morning, just before he was supposed to go to work. He ended up staying at home. He called in sick and cried half the day away. The garland is still there now, the words a sting into Draco’s heart. It’s a girl, is all it says. And Draco knows it’s insane, but he wants to grab a rock from the garden and smash the window and destroy the garland.
Harry reads over the note three times, maybe even four. His heart is inside his throat and that doesn’t make any sense. It’s not why he’s here. He’s here to help. And just help. He wants to be a friend to Malfoy. So that is what Harry writes down before he pushes the note back.
“I still don’t get where he’s hiding,” Neville says. “We’ve checked the woods around the path to Hogsmeade. He never shows up on the map. And he’s not in the caves on the other side of Hogsmeade.”
It started off good, saying Hagrid bears no responsibility for the hippogriff attack on a student. But that was the only good thing about the letter. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures will have a hearing about it because of the complained of Mr Lucius Malfoy (explaining why Draco got so angry) and that the Hippogriff needs to be kept tethered and isolated till the date of the hearing.
Hermione and I struggled up the spiral staircase up to the top of the tower. I had tears in my eyes because of what had happened to Draco and I throw off the cloak as soon as we were out in the cold night air. I tried to hide my tears and tried not to get angry with Hermione, who was a little bit happy about Draco losing points for Slytherin. He came up to help us and all she cared about was house points.
After that Draco and I just sat down on the stairs up to the Entrance Hall and stared at nothing until it was time for the Christmas meal. It was probably as good as the last two years, but I hardly tasted it. Draco was just as quiet beside me. There weren’t many students at school this year and we all dined at the same table. Professor Snape told us to light up, that it would be fine. And then Professor Lupin snapped at him that he should give us some time to grieve, that brooms are like lovers to Quidditch players, but that Snape won’t understand that since he never had a heart for the sport anyway. And then Headmaster Dumbledore made the entire table open Christmas Crackers to light the mood.
“You boys are insane. Pettigrew will never make it into the castle,” Hermione says. “The Aurors are on top of this case, he will be caught in no time.”
“You’ll be fine,” Harry tells him.
Friday 30 December 1994
“I’m scared too,” Harry says. “Scared of what is expected of me, scared of losing my friends, of putting the people I care about in danger. But most of all I’m scared of losing you.”
“I didn’t bring any presents. Why should I bring presents?” Draco teases Teddy.
I couldn’t sleep that night, just lied in bed staring at Draco’s drapes through a gap in the curtains for hours. First I listened to Draco cry and wondered why he had been so against doing the spell Professor Snape had told him to do at the duel. I was happy when the sobbing turned into even breaths and I knew he was sleeping. But that just left me to think about what Hermione had said. Could I be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin? I don’t really know anything about my father’s family. I tried to say something more in Parseltongue, but the words didn’t come. I think I need to be face-to-face with an actual snake for it to work.
“I know,
—he’s developed some
“You want to do some good and make things right—start by visiting your goddamn godson.”
Draco sniffed and looked rather affronted. “I think you taste delicious,
“Mmm. Alright, Potter.” I reach over and grab the Firewhiskey and try not to think about my father or about people dying when you love them. The whiskey burns my throat on the way down. It makes my chest and stomach warm only for a moment before I go cold again.
But today I don’t taste anything, and nothing hurts when I clamp down hard with my teeth.
Fancy heaves himself up from where he’s leaning against Burkes’ wall, clenching that article in his fist.  He turns toward me, wipes his face with the back of his hand, and starts walking. He’s walking right up to me, and all I can do is stare. I should move out of his way, but I don’t.
Draco rested one of his hands on Harry’s arm. Then he faced Switzly again, clearing his throat. “Hello, Switzly,” Draco said, raking his nails back and forth over Harry’s bicep. “I’m looking for something else. Some more Bludgers and a new Beater’s bat, actually. Over there, correct?” Draco gestured in the general area to the side of them, his eyes glinting mischievously.
to the Productive Use of Dark Magic Department.”
about him,” Father said approvingly. His gaze darkened. “What was our last groundskeeper’s name?”
“You like what you see, darling?” Tosser asks, voice dropping low.
learning experience for him.” Draco dropped a couple of knuts into the coin slot, causing the cage to open. He reached in to grab a Pygmy Puff, frowning when it didn’t bother to snarl or bite him.
“I suppose not, then,” Draco said, amused. He turned back to the Bludgers on the shelf, and reached up to grab the

“Yeah,” I grunt. I start the engine again and take off down the street going 150 easy.
Harry’s back hit the shelving so goddamn hard that the resulting
Under the table, Draco’s fingers continue in steady, firm motions over my trousers. I spread my legs further and lean back. I feel my cheeks and neck heat.
Draco nods, forces a smile. Turns to Harry.
everything real quick and grab him up and toss him out onto the street.
father,
” Your hand makes its way to my side and rests there, shivery in that way you get when you need another hit. “They said I could be a father, though.”
I turn my head and look across the street. Fancy’s still leaning against the side of Borgin and Burkes. His smoke is stomped out on the ground, and he’s crying and reading that crumpled-up article while taking swigs from his flask.
What do I say to that? I grip my wine glass tight, and I imagine it breaking under the strain. Red would seep through the cracks, onto my hand, down my wrist. I should say something, I should. I open my mouth and—
“Right,” Harry laughed. “Yeah, I don’t know if this is helpful for you, but we also use the noose sometimes at night.” He looked at Draco, wanting him.
“It really is a shame we had to regrow Rotsley’s fingers,” Draco said sadly. “He was terribly disappointed.”
Harry and Draco smiled sinfully, then exchanged illicit leers.
“Merlin…Malfoy.” You’re slow when you talk, as if you wish you didn’t have to talk at all.
,” Draco murmured. “She sounds just like the song we waltzed to at our wedding.”
“You mean her head?” Harry asked. “That got burnt clean off,” he chuckled. “I guess she wasn't able to hear me tell any more lies after that.”
“What have you got there?” Draco gestured to the fluffy, squirming bundles.
“Alright.” I sit up and close my eyes. I see my dead Father. I want to cry. I open them.
“Yes, sir,” Switzly said, sorrowful. She slowly, reluctantly reached up to grab the first few plants.
A wolfish grin overtook Harry’s face as he dove in like a man starved. He grabbed Draco’s hand and pressed his lips to the tips of every one of Draco’s fingers. Harry did this several times over, each time more voracious and animalistic than the last. Then he continued mouthing up Draco’s arm—vigorous and thirsty and lovingly vicious, tasting and nibbling at him.
“Monday says that Abigail—the Acromantula she got as a birthday present for Rose—escaped from her box earlier today!” Draco exclaimed, thrilled. He scanned the parchment. “Apparently she’s loose somewhere in the Hufflepuff girls’ dormitories after attacking Filch in the Great Hall.”
“Yeah, okay. Hermione and I will bring breakfast. Do you have anything in the house to have for dinner? I could ask mom to send you something if you don’t.”
“Yes, I am,” Ron says.
“I wanted to call him Scorpius,” Draco says.
And then Hermione goes off, explaining how she’s always scared that she will fall, and that a lot of accidents happen during broom rides. Harry falling off it isn’t the first and certainly not the last one. The numbers are bad, only nobody seems to care and it stays a form of transport. It’s barbaric, according to Hermione. Neville signs along, but the movements go too quickly and Draco has already pushed his parchment back to Harry, who scribbles as fast as he can to keep up with Hermione’s words. Draco doesn’t read it yet, he tries to follow Neville’s movements. It’s great to see how hard Draco tries to get the hang of BSL. It warms Harry’s heart and it makes butterflies chase each other in his stomach.
Viktor stood over Cedric, who lay on the ground, twisting and jerking around. I used Stupefy on Viktor to make him stop. I couldn’t believe he did this, I thought he was a good guy. He was always friendly towards us, joined us for dinner on multiple occasions. And even Hermione liked him in the end. But it looks like he was a cheating bastard after all. We did send up some red sparks so the teacher could get him out of the maze. I didn’t want to be responsible for him getting eaten by a Blast-Ended-Skrewt.
Adrian glides his broom down to the ground. Draco doesn't say a word to him. He tries to hold his tears inside, tries not to show how broken he’s on the inside. When they reach the ground Draco doesn’t dare to look at the group of people in the middle of the field. He knows what they're looking at and he can't see it. The idea of seeing Harry's broken body, his lifeless form. It will be unbearable. There’s no way Draco can look at that and not crumble apart. It’s already a struggle as it is.
“So you’re like… You dig boys as well as girls?” Ron stammers.
James blinks with his eyes. “Yes, he is.”
We also ran into Hagrid in the library last week, which was very unusual. He tried to hide some things behind his back and asked us if we were still looking for Nicolas Flamel. Ron bragged that we had found him ages ago. I had to hide my smile when Neville rolled his eyes. It had been Hermione and me that had figured it out, Ron had no part in that and he knew that. But I’m getting used to Ron taking credit for work he hasn’t done, always making everything sounding like a team effort instead of giving the person that done it the credit unless of course, Ron did it, then it’s just him.
Uncle Vernon also put a padlock on Hedwig’s cage, so she can’t fly around. She’s bored like hell. Just like me. But she is lucky; she’s not having an emotional crisis because her best friend kissed her on the cheek. And she’s not the one not capable of sending a letter to her other best friend to ask her what it means. No, that’s just me. And I’m scared of the owl that will arrive with Draco’s letter, will he say anything about it in a letter. Will he explain why he did it? And what am I supposed to write to him now? Does he expect me to say anything about it? I’ve been trying to write to him, but I just don’t know what to say. I can’t put in a letter that I’m confused, that I don’t know what it all means. AARRGHH, it’s driving me insane.
“The gifts, the small little tokens Draco has been sending you. Fuck, you really don’t know, do you?” Zabini shakes his head again. “Didn’t any of your house-mates explain to you what was going on?”
“I know, sweetheart. I’ve already called healer Burke. She said she would send over prescriptions for your birth control potion.”
On his tiptoes, Harry sneaks out of the dormitory. Down the stairs and into the empty common room. The fire is still going. Fresh wood lays beside it. All the junk has been cleaned away. It seems the house-elves have already done their job.
Sirius thought of Professor Snape next. Sirius went to school with him (but you already knew this, since you both went to school with the both of them) and said that Professor Snape was always obsessed with the Dark Arts. And he used to be friends with others that were Death Eaters. Sirius listed off some names, but I didn’t care. I told him that Professor Snape was just as upset as him when my name came out of the Goblet and that if it hadn’t been for him I might have killed myself on the day of the second tasks. If Professor Snape wanted me dead, he would have just let me drown myself.
“Harry, you don’t have practice tonight,” Neville yells from behind him.
“You’ve heard me sing. I will never be able to do what you do, makeup notes and words and make them work. You should have become an artist,” Harry says as he sits down next to Draco. Draco takes Harry’s hand and places it on the keys. He pushes the fingers down as he leans his head against Harry’s shoulder.
“Not a chance at all, I would guess,” Neville spurts out between his laughter. Harry and he lock eyes for a second, and Harry can’t help but smile at his brother. Of course, Neville already knows. It’s not as if Harry has ever been able to keep a secret from him.
“Yeah, be all happy that you were right. Like always,” Harry spits at her before he turns around in his seat.
Draco stayed at Hogwarts this Easter holiday. He said I would need him more than his mother would need him. It’s nice to have him around. We are not allowed to go outside the Slytherin common room because of the attacks so we spent most of our time just hanging around in our dormitory, talking and playing with magic. It’s nice. I’ve missed this, just the easy simple time with Draco.
Draco gets up with the help of Luna, and he takes a seat in their car. He remembers something about their plans to travel all over Great Britain this year to find rare plants and non-exciting creatures. But why in a Muggle car? Draco has no idea. Luna rattles on and on about all the places they’ve been so far, and Draco tries to listen. But his mind is filled with his stupid actions. Why did he run away? Why can’t he enjoy the party and forget about the biggest failure in life? Why was he angry at Blaise? Draco has no idea anymore. Today is supposed to be about Teddy and his birthday. And Draco has ruined it, just like how he ruins everything else.
“Because I love you. For all the good you do. For how you take care of Teddy. For the strength with which you overcame a potion addiction. For how loyal you are to your family. For the effort you took to earn the trust of Hermione and Ron, how you worked hard on getting to know them because you know they are important to me. I love you because you let me cry and scream at you when I was healing. I love you for helping me figure out what I want to do with my life, for showing me that I didn’t have to keep protecting the world, that I could be just me. And I want to do the same for you. I want you to know that I want you to be just you, and that it is enough to be just you.”
“Leave it, Blaise. Draco is going to kill you,” Parkinson says.
Draco drops his head and looks at his lap. He can’t go back to that. Not if it’s going to be useless anyway. He will just have to learn to live with the fact that he’s never going to be a father, that he will never give Harry his life wish, a child of their own. But then Harry will leave, so maybe it’s okay, maybe Draco won’t become addicted to them. If it keeps Harry in his life, it might be an option.
‘I suck at Divination,’ Harry writes. ‘I just predict Neville’s demise all the time. That seems to cheer Trelawney up the most.’
And then the hat shouts RAVENCLAW.
“Okay,” Harry says as he stops in the middle of the field. He hands Draco a broom and places his own next to him on the ground. “Flying is easy once you get the hang of it. We just need to get you in the air first.”
“What, that you dragged me into a toy shop when you saw this hideous thing in the window. Or how I had to stop you from buying up the entire store,” Draco teases him.
“No,” Harry shouts as Pettigrew raises the wand and then grabs Draco’s arm with his other hand. He pulls Draco towards him, turns him around and then points the wand at Draco’s throat. Harry freezes on the spot. His heart hammers in his ears. His eyes are locked on Draco’s.
Harry slams his book shut. “Couldn’t even if I wanted to.”
I miss Hogwarts. It’s like I have a constant stomach-ache, that’s how much I miss it. I miss the castle, the secret passageways and ghosts, the classes, the mail arriving by owl. Hedwig is locked up in her cage and she keeps waking uncle Vernon in the early morning because she’s bored and makes loud hooting noises. We have an argument about it almost every morning. And yesterday on my birthday I accidentally said ‘you’ve forgotten the magic word’ when Dudley told me to pass the frying pan and the room exploded. Dudley fell off his chair, aunt Petunia screamed and uncle Vernon jumped to his feet and roared at me, telling me the M word was forbidden and that I shouldn’t threaten Dudley. But all I meant was please. I just wanted Dudley to say please.
Hagrid shushed him quickly, telling us not to shout about it. And when I told him I had some more questions about what else is guarding the stone apart from Fluffy he invited us over at his place. After he left Ron and Neville decided to find out what he had been hiding and told us he had been in the dragon section. I told them Hagrid always wanted a dragon and they informed me it was outlawed years ago. And that having a dragon is dangerous. Ron said his brother Charlie has some pretty scars from when he was burned by wild ones in Romania.
“Why did you excepted all the tokens if you didn’t want them?” Zabini asks.
Draco wrote me back to tell me he loves to see the house and the family tree. As a kid he had a lot of lessons into their family tree, to make sure he knows where he comes from and all. He said it was really boring, but I kind of envy him. I have no idea who my family was. Luckily Sirius loves talking about you two. He has all these amazing stories of how he ruled the school together with you, dad.
Ron’s brothers Fred and George are a lot of fun, and his father is also great. He is fascinated with muggle stuff and asked me what the purpose of a rubber duck is. Percy is still stuck up and complained about the fact that they were harbouring a Slytherin at their house. His mother told him to shut his mouth and be more polite to their houseguest, meaning me. Everyone else is very nice to me and it seems they all really like me.
Harry pulls him against his chest again. “You don’t. You saved me. You didn’t destroy me. You make my life complete, and the only way you can destroy it is by leaving me.”
“He might not be allowed to,” James says. “I’m sure that if Draco could, he would have written to you.”
Thinking of Draco made me think of our fear of Voldemort coming back. Now that the stone is gone he will have to find another way. And headmaster Dumbledore agreed with me that he is still out there somewhere. We had a little talk after that about you, mom. Because Voldemort had said that you had died trying to stop him from killing me and I asked the headmaster if he knew why Voldemort wanted me dead in the first place. Headmaster Dumbledore said he couldn’t tell me why, not now at least. He will tell me when I’m older and ready. I don’t know what that means, but it wouldn’t have helped to argue. The headmaster did tell me why Quirrell couldn’t touch me. It’s because you died to save me, mom.  Your love for me also left a mark on me, an invisible protection in my skin. It had been agony for professor Quirrell to touch a person marked by something so good.
“A stag, just as his Patronus,” Harry informs Ron. “And Sirius is a black dog.”
“Hermione is wrong. Flying is awesome,” Draco signs.
And then everyone went away for the Christmas holiday and Draco and I kind of forgot all about helping Hagrid with his case. We just stayed in bed late each morning, smooching each other senseless. And when we get hungry we both take a short shower, I braid Draco’s hair and then we just make our way down to the great hall to grab a late brunch. None of the other students that stayed behind bother us and the teachers don’t seem to be that hard on us. Professor Snape hasn’t yelled at us once this whole week about having more distance between the two of us. And he normally does that all the time. Always says there should be at least two inches of space between us on the bench at breakfast, or that we need to sit on opposite sides of the table with potions, so we at least don’t turn it into a love potion by accident.
“He’s upset, we can’t just let him go like that,” Harry says.
“And I’m not saying that Draco has feelings for you,” Remus continues. “But if he has, he might be frightened of them. You told me his father is already angry because it came out he’s deaf. I’m sure his father won’t take it lightly if being gay piles up on that.”
Malfoy is in four of Harry’s classes. They share History of Magic, Potions and DADA, just like last year. And Malfoy is also in Divination, one of the two new classes that Harry follows this year. Harry sits in the back of the class, paying no attention to the teachers. His eyes are focused on Malfoy. He observes how Malfoy keeps his head down. During History of Magic Draco reads through most of the lesson. When other students doze off (or take massive notes as Hermione loves to do), Draco has his book open and scans over the pages. In Potions Draco makes the potion just as everyone else. And he is good at it. He always has been. Professor Snape likes Malfoy. His behaviour towards Malfoy is the complete opposite of his behaviour towards Harry. But Harry is used to hearing how he’s the same as his father and how his popularity will one day abandon him and he will be hopeless and lost.
“All of the Hufflepuff seventh years have Herbology too,” Seamus pipes in.
“Did you take them?” Harry asks again. He needs Draco to say it. It’s the only way he will believe him.
They sit in silence. Draco rests his head on Harry’s shoulder. A young man walks past the waiting area, a newborn baby in his arms. Draco follows him with his eyes. Watches as the man softly sings to the baby. It stings in his heart. He hates the jealousy that grows inside him every time he sees someone with a baby.
Together with Hagrid’s package came also my Hogwarts letter for the coming year. It was the normal stuff, informing me that the school year will start on the 1st of September and a list with the books and supplies I will need. But it also included a permission form to visit Hogsmeade. That made me a little sad because there was no way Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia were going to sign it for me.
The only downside was that sometimes people would look at us, see how close we were and that we were holding hands, and then would say nasty things. Sirius had warned me that not all wizards and witches are okay with people being bent, and I know that there are kids at school who also think its wrong, but it still hurts a little when they show their hatred of people like us.
“Whatever you say. Just catch the Snitch already,” George shouts before he’s off to aim a Bludger at Flint who tries to score for Slytherin.
The weirdest thing was how Hermione had a long conversation with Adrian. I’m sure it had something to do with getting into the kitchens so she could talk to the house-elves. You should have seen Ron looking at the two of them all the time. It’s clear he was jealous. It would be great when Hermione and Ron could realise that they both love each other and should just get back together.
Harry looks at the steps of the main entrance of Hogwarts. The Christmas holiday had sped by in no time. And the long train ride back to Hogsmeade had never gone this fast. Harry drags towards the stairs in front of him. He doesn’t want to go back inside and have to say goodbye to Draco. His fingers are cold and he has a sour taste in his mouth.
Harry is proud. And so in love. And so grateful for everything Draco did tonight. “Thank you for today,” he signs. “You saved us.”
“Okay,” Hermione answers. She doesn’t remove her hand from Harry’s. Harry stares at them. Is it bad that he wonders what it would feel like if Malfoy would take his hand in his? Does that mean he does fancy him? Harry just doesn’t know. But he loves spending time with Malfoy.
The next day, Hermione pulled me to the library to talk about what happened. She believes I didn’t put my own name in and is worried just like Draco about the fact that somebody might want to kill me. Ron and Neville were with her, and they also agreed I would never have entered. Ron said I would have put Draco’s name in if I’d had the change since I went on and on about how good a candidate Draco would be. This made Draco blush and he kissed me on the cheek, saying Ron was right. Neville tipped in that he thinks I will win, but that he also believes I didn’t put my own name in.
“It’s just a stuffed animal,” Draco tells her. “Harry couldn’t help himself when he saw this one. Said it was perfect for his newest godchild.”
Draco can feel his mother's eyes on him. But he can’t look at her. He needs to face the Dark Lord. He needs to hear the impossible tasks that will be entrusted to him. A task that will kill him for sure. There is no way he will be able to finish off the strongest wizard alive.
It was all so nice. And then it all became horrible. Professors McGonagall and Flitwick came into the Three Broomsticks, together with Hagrid and the Minister of Magic Fudge. Draco and Hermione pushed me under the table just before they all took a seat at the table next to ours. They talked about the Dementors and Sirius Black. How Sirius Black used to be your best friend, dad. That the both of you had been inseparable when you went to school at Hogwarts, like brothers. They talked about how Black had been the best man at your wedding and that you had named him my godfather. And that wasn’t even the sickest thing about it. He betrayed you, gave you up like you mend nothing to him. I heard them talk about the Fidelius Charm, how Black had been your Secret-Keeper and had given up your location to Voldemort.
But that didn’t satisfy Filch, he kept blaming me. He said it was because I knew he was a Squib. But at that moment I didn’t even know what a Squib was. Filch said I knew because I had seen his Kwikspell letter. It was Professor Snape that then said that maybe Hermione and I had just been at the wrong place at the wrong time. But that it was suspicious that we were in the upstairs corridor instead of at the Halloween feast. I didn’t know what to answer. I didn’t think saying I had heard a voice that wanted to kill was going to do me any good. So I was very glad when Hermione explained that we had gone to Nearly Headless Nick’s death-day party and that I was simply escorting Hermione back to her own common room. Snape than asked why we didn’t join the feast after the party and Hermione said that she was feeling really tired and just wanted to go to bed.
Teddy nods his head and takes another crayon and starts to colour again. Draco pets his hair and then moves back to the sofa where Pansy is checking her nails.
The classroom door opens and Malfoy stands up from the floor. He goes inside. Harry, Neville and Hermione follow him. As usual, Malfoy finds a spot at the back of the class. He sits down and pulls his history textbook out of his bag.
After those attacks, almost all the students decided to go home for the Christmas holidays. Hermione tried to convince her parents to let her stay, but they agree, saying they missed their daughter, so she also had to go. Draco is also leaving, going to his elaborate Christmas dinner at the manor. I hope he will have a good holiday. I think he’s really scared and sad right night. He’s been crying more often at night. I hear him every time I wake up from my nightmares. They are still the same. I see Draco somewhere, I try to get closer to him and then he disappears. What if he doesn’t come back from the holiday?
I love you both,
“Yes, we are,” Neville says. “And you won’t stop us.”
Malfoy’s eyes glitter as he reads Harry’s words. Harry watches them as Malfoy writes his response.
“True. Your dad should have a little more faith in you,” Sirius says. “But you won the Quidditch Cup, so your dad won’t say a word about your grades. Your mum on the other hand…”
“Harry,” Lily says. She turns him around with her hand and places her other hand on his other shoulder. It won’t be long, and Harry will be the same height as her. She hardly has to look down at Harry. Her face morphs into one of compassion when she looks at him. She pulls him against her and circles her hands around Harry.
I took forever to reach Honeydukes, but once I got there and had sneaked into the shop without anyone noticing me, I didn’t know where to look. There were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets imaginable. Nougat, squares of coconut ice, toffees and hundreds of different kinds of chocolate. They even have a wall with ‘Special Effects’ sweets, like Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, Tooth-flossing String-mints and sugar-spun quills.
Hermione sighs and looks at all of them for a long time. “I’ll guess I’ll help too,” she says. “Just to make sure you don’t get killed.”
Harry laughs even harder and shakes his head. It’s good to see Hermione worry about Ron instead of him for a moment. “I do think I need to tell him that it’s just boys for me.”
Draco laughs and pushes Harry’s face away, making the man tumble over. Teddy laughs and points at Harry. “You fell,” he giggles. And just like that, the boy has forgotten all about the massive hint Harry gave him about one of his presents. He runs off to his box with toys and pulls out some of his favourite ones. Harry moves to sit next to Teddy and plays with him. Draco turns away and tries to focus on the cupcakes again. It’s a dull job, but he gets it done. And then Hermione and Ron are there, just like Molly and Arthur. And when Draco sits down with a glass of wine, Blaise and Ginny walk into the house.
The line stays quiet. Harry stares at his feet in front of him. His vision blurs as tears start to flow. “I don’t want to lose him,” Harry says. And he will if he forces Draco to get help. Draco will shut him out entirely, and then all hope is gone. He’ll start using again, and Harry will find him dead in their bed one day.
“He isn’t crazy,” Harry says. He nudges his shoulder and Ginny gets the massage. She lifts her head, looks at Harry and raises her eyebrows.
“Thank you for coming today. I know we were supposed to look after Teddy this weekend,” Harry starts.
When they had all left Sirius stood up from his chair and said he would write a letter to Draco’s mom, to make arrangements to keep Draco save. When he left, Draco started to cry. He sobbed on and on about that he could never go home again. I just held him until he fell asleep. And that is where we are now.
“You’re at the wrong table, Gryffindorf,” someone yells at Harry. Harry looks up from his breakfast and spots Parkinson and Nott some seats away from them.
“You shouldn’t have,” Draco answers without looking at Harry. The bed dips when Harry sits down on it. His hand finds Draco’s and squeezes it lightly.
“I know you’re upset still about Draco,” Neville says when they walk beside the water. “And that it’s hard for you to study without him, but Hermione’s right.”
I’ll keep you informed on how Sirius is doing, I know you would want to know. And about all things concerning the war against Voldemort. Dinner is ready, so I’m off now.
And it isn’t only the students and teachers that make school suck. I had to go to this crazy wand weighing ceremony for the tournament. And that would have been fine if just Rita Skeeter hadn’t been there. She’s a journalist and she wanted to interview me. Mr Bagman said it was fine, so I kind of had no choice than go along with it. She took me into a broom closet so the others wouldn’t disturb us. And then she took out her Quick-Quotes Quill and started asking me questions. Only the quill didn’t write down anything I said. It just made up things, like that my eyes were filling up with tears when we talked about my parents. We didn’t even really talk about you, so why would I get teary-eyed. And she kept asking me why I entered. I said I hadn’t but she didn’t believe me.
“One day, we just need to be a little more patient,” Harry tells Draco.
“You’re still worried about Malfoy?” she asks when she looks back at Harry.
Remus smiles. “Iris calls me uncle. You’re allowed to do the same. And Neville too if he wants.”
Harry shrugs and sits down on one of the bar stools. Lily puts down the leftovers she was packing away and sits down next to Harry.
Love you,
"I can't do it like this, Draco," Harry says. He places a kiss on Draco's shoulder. "Not when you shut yourself off and just let it happen to you. Fuck, it feels like I'm raping you."
“Told you,” Hermione says.
“Hogwarts,” Draco signs.
“I can’t, Hermione,” he says.
Harry doesn’t know what to write back. He disagrees. Draco’s family is horrible. The way they treat Draco is unacceptable. But he can’t say that.
“Kill the spare, that’s what he said,” Harry continues. “As if Cedric was nothing.”
Draco turns around and steps a little closer to Harry. “Maybe I like chasing you,” he says. Harry’s cheeks get even more colour and Draco wants to kiss them. He’s aware that his skin is hot and that his cheeks are probably even darker than Harry’s. But Draco doesn’t care anymore. Hasn’t cared for some time now when it comes to Harry.
“He must be,” Neville says. “It’s why the Aurors can’t find him.”
Draco lays his arm around Harry’s shoulders and pulls him against his chest. He doesn’t interrupt and he doesn’t say anything about the tears that moister his shirt.
When we were dismissed, Viktor asked to talk to me and we headed out towards the forest. Viktor didn’t want to be overheard he said and I was fine with that. I wanted to talk to me as I was Hermione’s best friend and he wanted to know what was going on between her and Ron. He said that she talks about him just as much as she talks about me and Draco. I told him that they are dating and was surprised to see that Viktor didn’t like this news. He asked me if I thought he might have a chance with her, that she might leave this redheaded boy for him. I didn’t like to crush Viktor’s hopes, he’s a nice guy, but after all the pining towards each other I’m glad Ron and Hermione are back together and I don’t think Viktor will be able to come between them.
Love you,
Harry snaps out of his mind when Malfoy slips away from his arm. Harry turns to see Malfoy fall to the ground, his body limp and his eyes closed. Harry crouches down and lifts Malfoy’s face in his hands. He quickly checks if there are no wounds from Malfoy’s fall. “Don’t leave me,” Harry whispers. “Everyone else has already left me. I want to be your friend.” Harry doesn’t know where that comes from, but he knows it’s true. He wants to be Malfoy’s friend and help him.
“Please, just let me explain,” Harry begs.
The staring hasn’t stopped. Harry does it now too. He sits with his friends at the Gryffindor table. He pretends to eat his food and listen to their conversation. Ron is going on about another essay they are supposed to write. Harry doesn’t care. He hasn’t finished any of his homework for the past two weeks. It was something he used to do with Draco. They would sit in silence and work. And now, Harry is always surrounded by sound. He gets distracted and just gives up.
“How did you get mum to fall in love with you?” Harry asks James.
Around four all my friends arrived. It was nice to have Hermione, Blaise, Greg, Daphne and Luna come over to my home during the summer. We had a lot of fun. Mrs Tonks had put 14 candles on my cake, which was delicious. We hung out in the garden and everyone told me about their own summer adventures. Blaise had been to some tropical island, Greg and Daphne had met up several times during break and Hermione explained how she helped out her parents with their work. Luna was fascinated by the way muggles take care of their teeth.
Harry doesn’t look up when Shacklebolt stands up and starts to talk. Another person Harry let down by running. By becoming an accomplish to a wanted criminal. Always on the run. Always looking over his shoulder. Until they made a choice and found a way to live their lives in peace.
“What is?” Remus asks with a frown on his face.
It was dark by the time we reached Hogwarts and the car was acting up. The engine started making funny noises and when we could see the castle the car was shuddering and losing speed. And when we had passed the lake the engine died. We dropped down, gathering speed and heading straight for the solid castle wall. I thought I was going to die right there. I closed my eyes and wished I could get the change to tell Draco that I love him.
That was the end of the ceremony and the Headmaster told us we could go down to the Great Hall to have dinner. But he had forgotten about the photographs. First, we had to take group shots. Seeker kept rushing forwards to make sure I was in a prominence potion. And then they wanted separate shots of all the champions. They took a million shots of me, much more compared to the other champions and it really bugged me. I wanted to tell Draco when I finally made it to dinner. Only Draco wasn’t there. I had to learn from Hermione that he was serving detention with Professor Snape because he got into a fight with some of the older Slytherins in the hallway.
“And I want you to live,” Harry says. “I need you to live, so I can keep breathing. Please Draco, try to live again.”
“Then you should tell him. He won’t mind,” Hermione says.
Harry lays down on the grass and pulls the Snitch from his pocket. He lets it fly up into the sky a little before he grabs it and pulls it back. Neville still walks around, busy inspecting the plants around them.
Draco shakes his head.
They'd arrived at the party about an hour ago. Draco had sat down in one of the chairs and hasn't moved since. Harry looks at him from his place on the sofa. Ginny sit next to him, telling him all about the house hunt and how happy she's with this place. Harry nods in agreement. Not that he's paying attention to her words. He’s sure he won’t be able to recall anything Ginny says today.
“I hate both of you, just so you know,” Harry says as he sits back down. “We can’t just let him be. Not now that we know he’s deaf.”
“No, I won’t. I won’t fall for that lie,” Hermione says.
“Yes, she is,” Harry says.
Lily stands in front of him, her hand placed softly on Draco’s belly. Nathan stands by the table and smiles at Lily.
“You want to share a broom and go higher?” Harry asks when they have their feet back on the ground.
“We’re telling them today, right?” Teddy asks. He strides next to Harry, their hands linked. Draco walks just behind them. He’s quiet. He still feels guilty for what happened last year, how he made Harry stay home with him. Harry told him again this morning that he wouldn’t have wanted to spend Christmas last year in any other way. So Draco tries to remind himself of that too and forget about it. It’s one of the things he learnt in therapy, don’t make a problem out of something that isn’t a problem, and don’t blame yourself for things that are out of your control. Draco can’t change what happened last year, the only thing he can do is make sure this Christmas is one they all enjoy.

“I know, sweetheart. I know. It’s all going to be okay. I promise. But I can’t help you. It’s too much for me. You need someone who’s trained for this. You need professional help. And I promise it will work. It helped me to cope with the pain, the losses. It thought me that it wasn’t all my fault, just like all the things you just said weren’t your fault. You didn’t kill any of those people. You never wanted to get addicted, and you didn’t take the potions now. You need to learn that it’s not your fault, none of it is your fault. The only thing you did was try to survive, to keep your mother safe. And you saved me, during the war and after. I know you don’t see it that way, but I don’t think I could have healed the way I did if I hadn’t had you with me every step of the way.”
It’s when I told Hermione, Ron and Neville that I’m not brave, Neville gave me the card of his chocolate frog he was eating. He said it was because I collected them, but I know he did it to try to cheer me up. I think he understands a little, he confessed not long ago that he thinks he was misplaced in Gryffindor because he’s not brave at all. I looked at the card and it was of headmaster Dumbledore. Just like the first card I got. And when I was reading the back of the card again I got so excited, because I had found Flamel! The card said: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’. When I told the others, Hermione jumped from her seat and ran out of the Great Hall, telling us to wait for her. When she came back she had an enormous old book in her arms. She called it light reading and Ron commented on that, making them snap at each other again. Really this girlfriend, boyfriend stuff is confusing.
“Do you think ours would have been this beautiful?” he asks.
Rookwood gives Draco a dark look. He’s still upset that Draco took his place around the table. Draco is sure that Rookwood would kill him if he knew he would get away with it.
And that is true. Ron is good when it comes to secrets. He’s never before betrayed Harry or Neville. And he won’t do it now. He isn’t Pettigrew. Harry looks at Neville and raises his shoulders. They might as well.
“I didn’t plan to fall for him,” Harry says. “I just wanted to help him.”
Draco’s cheeks turn red and he looks out of the window. Harry steps closer to him and takes Draco’s head in his hands so they can look at each other. Their lips meet and they kiss for some time. Harry opens his mouth to let Draco’s tongue in. At some point, they move. Harry’s legs bump into the seat behind him and he sits down. Draco crawls on his lap, not stopping his assault on Harry’s mouth. His hands slide through Harry’s hair and Harry moans into the kiss. It’s perfect. How is Harry ever going to survive not being able to do this for the next two months?
After that, Draco and I danced some more and then we went for a walk outside to have some privacy so we could kiss. On our way to a private spot, we overheard Karkaroff talk to Professor Snape. It turns out that he was extremely insulted by the fact that Hogwarts would let two boys dance together. Professor Snape told him to start living in the now instead of in the past and let us be, that he had no idea what he was talking about. We both duck out of the way and hid behind a bush when they passed us. I think Professor Snape did see us, but after the conversation he’d just had, I think he thought it was wise not to point us out and duck points for kissing in the yard.
"Thanks, mate." Harry smiles softly. When all else fails, he knows he’ll always have Ron and Hermione to help him out.
“Why don’t you go take a bath, relax and wash your hair. You’ll feel better afterwards,” Harry says.
“Just a second longer,” Lily says. “I’ve missed you.”
They both fall silent again. Harry can’t look away. Draco is on the other side of the room, and the lights are soft. It’s hard to see the grey of his eyes. They are darker now in the twilight. Less like an ocean, and more like rocks. Draco’s platinum hair falls over his left eye. It has grown out even more and it won’t be long before Draco can pull it into a ponytail at the back of his neck. Harry wonders how long Draco is going to let it grow. He would be beautiful with long hair. Harry is sure of it.
“You still think that Ron having a girlfriend will make him less angry about the fact that you want to kiss his little sister?” Harry asks.
Professor Moody didn’t deny it. He took credit for his handy work. He wanted to know if Voldemort forgave the other Death Eaters, the ones that never went to Azkaban, or even searched for their lord. He was the one who concurred the Dark Mark in the sky during the Quidditch World Cup. And he made sure I would win the Tournament. He manipulated me all year and he is the one who used the Imperius curse on Viktor during the final task. Viktor didn’t attack Cedric because he wanted to win that badly, he wasn’t in control.
Harry grabs the frame and puts it down. His heart aches just to look at it. A small tear falls from his eye and he wipes it away in haste. He won’t cry. Draco isn’t worth it.
On the morning of Halloween, we had Charms and Hermione was partnered with Ron for that lesson. I was stuck with Malfoy as for usual. And we both suck at charms; we’ve both been unable to make our feather fly. It only flies off the table when Draco pushes it away. Hermione is the only one that has been able to make it fly until now. And I’m not sure what happened during class on Halloween, but I know that Hermione was trying to tell Ron how to pronounce the incantation and showing him how it’s done, and Professor Flitwick was clapping and praising her for her good work. Malfoy snorted next to me, calling Hermione a know-it-all mudblood. He turned around and told Nott they should do something about her attitude. I don’t want to know what they are planning to do to her, but I’m going to make sure I’ll find out so I can warn her or help her stop them. It’s fine if they want to go after me, but they should leave Hermione alone. I hate it that they are picking on her as well now just because she’s my friend.
Love you, mom and dad, I wish you would have been here for all this.
We had to undergo all kind of silly test the weekend after the task. Some people of the Ministry came to oversee them. And Sirius and Draco’s mom were there. I think that was the first time they’ve seen each other in years. They first didn’t know how to interact with each other. Draco’s mom was extremely polite, just like Draco was in the beginning with Sirius. I made Draco laugh. I love it when he laughs. He’s so beautiful, mom. I want to look at him for the rest of my life. And now that we know about our soul bond, I think I will. I know I will never love anyone the way I love him. And yes, I know we’re only fourteen. But there is no denying it anymore, we’re made for each other.
Hagrid caught up with us and we told him what we had seen. I asked him what it was, but Hagrid didn’t’ know. Draco said it must have been weak, to drink unicorn blood, because it would keep it alive but that it would also curse it. That the creature must be very afraid to die. Hermione had joined us and said something that made me think. She said that it would be bad unless you only needed to stay alive long enough to drink something else that will make sure you can never die. She was talking about the sorcerer’s stone, I’m sure. It makes the elixir of life. But who would be so weak they would need unicorn blood to stay alive?
Harry raises his wand and shouts Stupefy. Red light flies through the room. Pettigrew jumps out of the way and escapes the spell by inches. Draco looks up from his book. He pushes his chair back which falls to the floor with a loud bang. Pettigrew is on the move. He sprints to the table. He and Draco both reach for Draco’s wand at the same time.
“So, you convinced him to let you help him?” Ron asks with his mouth filled with food that he should chew.
“Mother isn’t answering my calls. I’ve tried to Flo her multiple times.” Draco says out of nowhere.
* * *
“If I can have everyone's attention,” Teddy says. “I have some important news to tell you all.”
“He never talks. We thought it was a status thing. But I think…” Harry starts. He’s not sure how to explain it properly. “He doesn’t respond to sounds.”
“They say she kissed Luna Lovegood,” Harry says.
And then Harry is back, his arms around Draco’s waist. “Let’s go outside and watch the fireworks,” he says. Draco agrees and follows him outside. Seamus is already setting up his show for the night. It’s a good thing that Hermione and Ronald’s cottage is so remote. No Muggle would believe that the fireworks Seamus comes up with could be bought in a regular store.
Harry nods and then puts his hand on hers. “He’s not going to hurt any of us,” he says. “We won’t let him.”
“If it’s one of us, it will be Neville,” Ron says. “He’s the one that doesn’t have that many friends, that likes to spend time alone in the greenhouses. And he’s a single child without any parents.”
It has been hard. Hermione, Ron and Neville are fun to hang out with, but I missed the times Draco and I would just spend with the two of us, talking about everything and nothing. I missed his lessons in defensive charms and jinxes. He just knew how to get me to use my wand without being afraid of it. But he ignored me all the time, so that wasn’t happening anymore. And on top of that Nott and Crabbe had started with their jinxes and beatings again. It was again not safe for me to be alone in our dormitory, partly because Draco only came in when he was off to bed and he was always already off to breakfast before I even woke up. I didn’t know if he just didn’t know that Nott had started beating me again or if he didn’t care.
“That girl is too popular,” Fred says.
And the scowl on Draco’s face when he reads them. Harry loves that scowl. He can’t help but smile each time Draco crumbles up another note and tosses it in the bin on his way out of class.
Harry shakes his head. “Nothing. What was it you said,” he says. He knows he should look at Ron, stop him from following his line of sight, but he just can’t. He wants them to trip, to stumble, to stop dancing. He needs Malfoy to stop dancing with that cow.
I’m fine by the way. Madam Pomfrey said I’ll be allowed to leave before dinner tonight. I didn’t break anything or got hurt, I just fainted. The only reason I had to stay overnight is that Madam Pomfrey is worried about me since this is the second time I passed out because of the Dementors.
Hermione had gotten money from her parents to get an early birthday present and she wanted to get an owl. She loves Hedwig and is always grateful she’s allowed to use her whenever she needs to, but she would like to have an owl of her own. So we went to a magical creature shop where we bumped into Ron and Neville. Ron was there to get his rat Scabbers checked over, said Egypt hadn’t agreed with him. The witch behind the counter was busy with another wizard so we waited. Draco moved very close to me, almost hiding behind my back when we looked at all the amazing creatures in the cages. There was a pair of enormous purple toads, a gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell and poisonous orange snails. Cages filled with owls and ravens was where Hermione took off to find herself an owl, Ron on her heels, chatting to her. Neville said that Ron wants to try to start dating Hermione again. But after today, I don’t think that’s ever going to happen.
“I don’t know, sweetheart,” Harry answers.
Filch left us alone with Hagrid and Draco turned to him telling him he wasn’t going into the forest. There was a note of panic in his voice. Nott also started to protest, saying he wasn’t going either. Hagrid shut them both up that by saying that if they wanted to stay at Hogwarts they will go in. He said that we had done wrong and that we now have to pay for it. Draco started ranting then, saying that this was servant stuff, not for students and that if his father would know what he was doing… well, we never found out, because Hagrid stopped him by saying that if he rather was expelled he could go back to the castle to start packing.
A beam of light shines into the compartment. Harry looks out the window. The rain has stopped and the sun is trying to fight its way out of the clouds. It’s so different from only minutes ago, when the Dementors had entered the train and almost killed Malfoy.
“I missed you too, Teddy. Did you have a good time with your grandma Andromeda?”
Harry looks at Iris and Neville. He squeezes Iris’ hand softly. “I’m fine, Iris. You don’t have to worry,” he says.
Wishing I was with you both,
Harry laughs out loud until he spots Mrs Prince on the other side of the clearing with tables. He pushes his hand in front of his mouth and hopes that Mrs Prince will leave them be. She shakes her head and then walks away without saying a word.
“I’m sorry,” Draco whispers.
Friday 10 June 1994
A huge smile forms on Harry’s face. “I can see,” Harry signs back. His heart hammers in his chest and he’s glad he doesn’t have to speak. “You stopped him,” Harry signs.
“No, he didn’t, Ron. He’s forcing Malfoy against his will,” Neville says.
* * *
It was worst between Marcus and Wood, the captain of the Gryffindor team. They throw hexes at each other every time they saw each other. At one moment Wood treated to hurt me or Draco and ever since then Marcus made sure there were always people protection us. It made it hard to show up to classes on time.
“You’re freaking out in your head, aren’t you?” Neville asks.
Harry looks at Draco who smiles at him. It’s hard to believe how okay Draco is with being deaf. They have been over this before. That Draco has always been deaf and thinks that sound will be distracting. Still, Harry can’t believe it. How is it that Draco never complains about not being able to hear? It’s so normal for Draco that he doesn’t even know what he’s missing. And maybe that is better than what happened to Uncle Sirius. He used to hear just fine, loved the sound of his own voice a little too much if Harry believes the stories Lily and Uncle Remus tell them. And then one single spell took it all away. It must be so different for them both. Harry hadn’t even thought about that. Draco’s never known anything else. For him, the world is a silent place. Harry wonders what that is like. Would he be okay to know he misses something that others have?
‘Your deaf uncle?’ Draco writes down.
Pettigrew doesn’t seem to notice that Harry is moving, so Harry risks another step. His eyes stay fixed on Pettigrew’s hand. Draco’s wand inside it, pointing at Draco’s throat. Harry can’t see his eyes, but he doesn’t miss the tears that drip from Draco’s chin.
“What is it?” he signs.
And then headmaster Dumbledore said the worst. He said the Chamber of Secrets war indeed opened AGAIN!
Harry closes his eyes. He can’t stand watching Ron and Hermione snug their faces off anymore. Why did he think it was a good idea for his two best friends to hook up? All the snugging is a bit much. Harry didn’t expect them to snug all the time. Can’t they just stop when Harry is around? It’s not like he came over to just hang out. He needs to talk to Hermione because he messed up. Big time.
Remus gets that look on his face when he’s about to say something Harry won’t like. “Harry, I can’t guarantee that Draco is willing to put in the extra work,” he says.
By the time Professor Lupin came back, I was sitting in Draco’s lap and we were both eating the chocolate he gave us. It really did help, it made me feel warm again. Greg, Blaise, Hermione, Luna and Daphne had joined us in the new compartment. None of them had fainted like I had and I felt a little ashamed. They had seen the Dementor and also felt horrible, but none of them felt as sick as I was feeling at that moment.
“Shut up, Ron,” Harry and Neville say at the same time.
At that moment Malfoy stirs. He blinks with his eyes and then sits up a little straighter. He looks at Harry and then towards Remus. Harry smiles at him, in the hope Malfoy understands that everything is okay. Remus fishes another bar of chocolate from his pocket and hands it to Malfoy.
Love you both,
* * *
I found Draco lying on the floor, between the feet of a high statue of a wizard with a face that was ancient and monkeyish. It had a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard’s sweeping stone robes. I sprinted towards Draco, begging him not to be dead. I flung my wand aside, grabbed Draco’s shoulders and turned him over. His face was white as marble and he felt cold to the tough. His eyes were closed and I was afraid I was too late. I hugged Draco against my chest and begged Draco to wake up.
“Well, then we’re both horrible people,” Harry states.
“So am I,” Harry tells him. Then he knocks on Madam Pomfrey’s office door. He tells her that Neville is awake. Neville gets something for the pain and then they are all instructed to go to sleep. Harry lays awake for a long time, a bright smile on his face. Draco likes him. And kissed him. Pettigrew might still be on the loose. And Harry will probably be grounded for the entire summer holiday when Lily and James hear what he did. But all that doesn’t matter. With Draco by his side, everything is going to be amazing.
“Fuck,” Neville says at the same time as Ron asks what Harry is on about.
“Rude,” Neville says to Harry’s left.
“Ron already thinks I’m seeing someone,” Harry says without looking at Hermione. “I don’t want him to get the wrong idea. He’ll just make fun of it.”
We stopped crying after a while and just sat there talking; we both didn’t feel like going to the Halloween banquet. It was already too late to go to any of our other classes of that day. Sorry about that, but Hermione needed me more than that I needed to sit to more boring classes. And I’m not sorry I missed DADA, really professor Quirrell is horrible. We don’t learn anything in that class at all. If we ever face a monster we will be lost.
“This is more important than my school subjects,” Hermione answers. “It’s not fair that Malfoy can only understand half of what we’re saying. So the sooner we all learn to include him, the better.”
Hermione got petrified. She was at the library during the last Quidditch match. It was Slytherin against Hufflepuff and I wanted to go see Draco fly. When I was walking towards the stadium I heard the voice again. It said it was going to kill this time. I tried to follow it for a bit, but I lost it, so I went to the Quidditch match.
I love watching Draco play. He’s really good and looks so beautiful on a broom. And now even more since he stopped putting so much grease in his hair and it falls more natural around his face. Mom, dad, I’m sorry, I’m hopelessly in love with him.
I love you both, I’m going now. I just want to be alone right now.
“He doesn’t want our help, so leave it,” Neville says from his other side.
Draco shakes his head.
Harry looks up to spot his sister between the group of first years. Iris looks at Harry and Neville and waves. Not long now and she will join their table. She has to. Harry needs to keep his family close so he can make sure they are all okay. At least until Pettigrew is apprehended. Until then it isn’t safe for any of them.
“We could have had a baby by now,” Draco says. The words hurt, but it’s what has been swimming around his head this entire week. That if he hadn’t lost their baby, it would have been born around this time. They would have been parents. But instead of that, the only thing Draco has is a massive hole in his heart that doesn’t seem to heal. No matter how hard he tries to mend it back together.
They left after a while, leaving me tied to the tree. I struggled to get lose, but nothing worked. My eyes were watery and that hurt, because the tears started to freeze a little. After a while I just let my head hang and hoped it would all be over soon. I must have passed out at some point because the next thing I know I woke up in the hospital wing with some warm blankets on top of me. Madam Pomfrey made me stay there for three whole days, only releasing me in time to go celebrate New Year’s Eve. Not that I had anyone to celebrate it with. I stayed up together with Myrtle, looking at the fireworks through her bathroom window.
“I know,” Harry says. “It’s still wrong.”
“Where have you been this afternoon?” Ron asks.
I didn’t know what came over me, I taunted him, asked him if he’d gone soft. Said he didn’t care last time when he killed all those Muggles to get at Pettigrew. Hermione ushered me to be quiet. It was the final drop. I roared that Black had killed my mom and dad and I broke free of Draco’s restraint and lunged for Black. I didn’t care about magic or the fact that Black was larger and stronger than me. The only thing I wanted was to hurt him as badly as I could, no matter how much I got hurt in return. I punched Black in the face and then was pulled backwards by Draco. Hermione gave Black a kick on his leg and he tumbled down, losing the wands that went scattering over the floor. I fought against Draco’s grip, got free when I punched him in his stomach and then I snatched up my own wand.
“You still love him,” Neville says.
Harry nods. It’s okay. As long as Draco doesn’t run again, it is fine. Sure he won’t run away again, won’t he? If only Harry knew why Draco rejected him before.
Harry pushes his hand through his hair. “I’ll try,” he says. “Not sure if Malfoy wants me to be his friend.” And that is the whole problem. Harry wants to help him, wants to be close to him. But he has no idea how.
Harry can’t take his eyes off Malfoy. He’s still unconscious. But his features aren’t as horrible as they were when the Dementor was close. Now his face is relaxed and he looks at peace.
“Thank you, Ron,” Harry answers.
During the night I had a very strange dream. I was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban. And the turban kept talking to me, telling me that I should be happy that I’m in Slytherin, that it was my destiny. I told the turban I didn’t want to be in Slytherin, that I wanted to transfer to Gryffindor. I tried to pull the turban off my head because it was becoming heavier and heavier, but it tightened painfully. And then Malfoy was there, laughing and pointing at me. After a while, Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher. He laughed also, with a high and cold laugh. Next, there was a burst of green light and I woke up sweating and shaking. I hope none of the other boys knows that I had a nightmare and won’t make fun of me for trashing in my bed.
Ginny gets up and places a kiss on top of Harry’s head. “I’m off, gay boy,” she says. “Please explain to my brother why we will never be and that it’s okay. I’ve got Nargles to catch.”
Draco’s father claimed he didn’t know how his son had gotten a hold on it. And then I accused him of leaving it in Draco’s room, knowing Draco would use it since he had forbidden him to communicate with anyone outside of the family. Draco’s father's white hands clenched and unclenched and he hissed: ‘prove it’. Draco’s hand then slit back into mine and he asked his father in a broken voice if he had done this to him, to his own son. Professor Snape got up from his chair, ready to step in if needed, but Draco’s father just said in a cold voice that Draco was no son of him and then turned around and kicked Dobby out of the room. I turned to Draco and tears were streaming down his face, but he looked determent. He asked Professor Snape if he could give the diary back to his father. Professor Snape seemed confused, but agreed and told us we could go back to our friends. Draco ran out of the office, pulled off his shoe and his somehow always clean white sock and stuffed the diary into it. He pulled his shoe back on and ran down the dark corridor towards the sounds of Dobby’s squeals of pain.
Draco let the words and gestures comfort him. He still doesn’t believe he’s worth saving. He still thinks he doesn’t deserve Harry’s love. But he will try, he will see a mind healer, and he will give up on the idea that he needs to get pregnant to keep Harry. It’s not what keeps him with Draco. Harry stays for the same reason why Draco could never leave. Because he loves Harry, no matter what. And somehow, Draco will find a way to get back on his feet, now that he knows that Harry will always stay with him.
James stays silent and Harry blinks a tear away. “Would they keep them from him?” Harry asks.
Draco doesn’t blink as the assault on his mind takes place. He stands tall and holds his ground.
Draco gets some juice for them all and then sits down on the left side of Teddy. “Why do you think you’re going to be a big brother?” Draco asks him.
Your Harry James Potter.
It’s almost time for the Easter dinner now, I can’t believe how the time flew when Malfoy and I were talking. We first talked about the plan to stop Nott and Crabbe. And then we talked about the upcoming exams. Malfoy told me his father expects him to be top of the class, but he thinks Hermione will beat him in most subjects. I told him his father would still be proud of him when he becomes second. I don’t think Malfoy thinks that is true, he still smiled at me and thanked me. I told him that my aunt and uncle won’t care how I do with my exams and that they don’t really care about me at all. Malfoy found that hard to believe.
Harry rounds a corner, coming up to the other park of tables. The chairs here are still on the floor. And one of them is occupied by Draco. His back is turned to Harry, as he leans over a big book. Harry can’t stop the loving smile that forms on his face. Draco is completely in his element, unaware of the time and his surroundings. Harry has stared at him often enough when they were still friends. Draco never noticed then, or pretended he didn’t. It was the best part of studying with Draco. The time's Harry could just look at him and feel complete.
Malfoy glances at the note. He makes a fist with his thumb on top and nods it.
“You should,” Harry agrees. “We’ll need a new Keeper next year now that Wood is graduating. I’ll ask mum if I can visit you this summer, so we can practice.”
Hermione said she thought we were in the Shrieking Shack and Draco joked that there were some weird ghost living in it if they would smash furniture and torn large chunks out of it. Before Hermione could respond we heard a creak overhead. Quietly we crept up the crumbling staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except for the wide shiny stripe on the floor that was made by something being dragged upstairs. We all put out the lights at the ends of our wands and crept toward the only door that was open.
Things got even worse during our last lesson on Monday: Defence Against the Dark Arts with Professor Lockhart. Hermione thinks he’s amazing and Ron is acting all jealousy. I just wished he wouldn’t single me out, so Nott wouldn’t have fuel for his new jokes about me dating Lockhart. And his lessons are an even bigger joke than those of Professor Quirrell. The first thing he made us do was take a test where all the questions were about him. Like what his favourite colour is and things like that.
“Don’t cry, sweetheart,” she says.
We didn’t take the Port-key with just us six. When we got at the location Cedric Diggory and his father were already there. Draco and I both agree that Cedric is extremely handsome. He’s about seventeen and is the captain and seeker of the Hufflepuff team. His father got all excited when he noticed that I was along everyone. He looked at my scar and it made me a little uncomfortable.  Draco squeezed my hand and it made me feel a little better. Until Cedric’s father looked at our locked hands like we were contagious. Cedric noticed and mouthed a sorry towards us.
“My head hurts,” Neville tells them.
Draco nods and takes a deep breath. “I think I need to,” he says. Without thinking about it, he lifts the bottle to his mouth and swallows the contents. “Fuck, they could have made it taste a little nicer,” he comments. Harry doesn’t respond. Draco looks at him. A tear travels slowly from the corner of Harry’s eye down his cheek. It hangs at his chin for a couple of seconds before it falls. When another tear escapes Harry’s eye, Draco lifts his hand to wipe it from his cheek. Harry turns to look at Draco, and he tries to smile.
“Fine,” Harry snaps back. He pushes his books into his bag. “I’m going for a walk,” he says and walks away.
“You’re spacing off,” Hermione says.
Love you,
The Knight Bus doesn’t have normal seats, instead, it’s filled with half a dozen brass bedsteads. Once I set down on mine the bus took off with another loud bang. It threw me back flat on my bed because of the speed of the bus. I felt really nervous on the bus. The driver, Ernie wasn’t a very good one. We kept mounting the pavement, only the bus didn’t hit anything. Everything jumped out of the way of the bus as it approached and back into position once it had passed.
I was panicking. I could run and no one would ever know I had been there. But I also couldn’t just leave them there. I had to get help. But who would believe I didn’t do it? I was so lost. What was I supposed to do? And then Peeves came by and saw the bodies next to me. He started screaming: ATTACK! Attack! No mortal or ghost is safe, run for your lives. And of course that made every door in the hallway crash open and students were coming in from all directions. It wasn’t until Professor McGonagall came on the scene and she had ordered everyone back into class that I dared to move. Professor McGonagall looked at me and told me to follow her. I tried to tell her that I hadn’t done it, but she said it was out of her hands. And then she took me to headmasters Dumbledore’s office.
And then the Dark Lord returned. More rooms of the Manor became off-limits. Draco sneaked around to watch how his aunt and uncle tortured Muggles and blood traitors. He watched through keyholes to see the Dark Lord praise his father for his inventions.
“I’m going to have some dinner. And if you don’t join me,” Harry wavers. He doesn’t want to do this, he doesn’t want this to end, but Hermione is usually right, and it might work. And Harry can’t stand around anymore and watch Draco destroy himself. “If you don’t join me, I’m packing my bag to stay at Ron and Hermione's. You can go and destroy yourself all alone. Just know that when you do, you destroy me along with you.”
We had a little moment and for the first time, I understood why Professor Snape has so mixed feelings about me all the time. He’s worried about me, and about Draco, but sometimes I know he wishes I was in a different house so he can duck more points of me, or treat me like he does with Neville from time to time. I think it’s because I look so much like someone he used to hate.
Burke lets Draco put his clothes back on and then she tells them about the options the other healer mentioned last week. Draco and Harry have discussed them at home, and Draco is glad when Harry starts to answer the question of what they want.
“What’s going on?” Draco signs.
Hermione and Neville fall in line with Harry before he exits the Great Hall and turns towards the stairs that will lead him to the History of Magic classroom.
Draco nods. “Thank you,” he signs.
Malfoy reaches out and takes hold of Harry’s hands. He shakes his head and then let's go again.
“I think you’re right,” Remus says. “How are you feeling?” he signs.
Harry is allowed to spend a week at Ron’s place. They fly around the large garden most of the time, joined by Ginny, Fred and George. The last two teach Ron that he’ll never be good enough to join the team, but Ron for once doesn’t let his twin brothers destroy his mood and doesn’t give up.
Harry gets a hold of Malfoy’s arms and keeps them in front of his chest. He looks Malfoy in the eyes. “It’s okay,” he says.
“I want to try out for the Quidditch team next year,” Ron says.
I don’t know what to do now. I have no way to contact anyone who could help me. And I still don’t have my letters. No kind words of Hermione telling me summer will be over before I know it. No funny stories from Ron about his crazy family. No words from Draco to ease my mind. And even if I had the letters, I’m sure there weren’t any letters from Draco between them. I would have recognized his handwriting. And that is one of the things that keep me up at night. Why didn’t he write to me? I thought that the kiss he gave on my cheek when we arrived at King Cross mend something. And I had hoped that maybe we could become boyfriends. Why would he kiss me and then change his mind?
“Harry, why don’t you show Draco where he will be sleeping,” Lily says.
When the boy was being dragged out of the room, Headmaster Dumbledore showed up next to us and told us it was time to return to his office. He pulled us out and we both started to apologise straight away. But the Headmaster only smiled and told us it was fine, that he shouldn’t have left the cabinet open, knowing full well how tempting the light is.
The next day Draco was still ignoring me. And a young Gryffindor first year had started stalking me. His name is Colin Creevey and he wanted to take a picture of me when Hermione and I were sitting outside during lunch. It’s hard to sit in the Great Hall and see Draco having a good time with Pansy and Daphne, all laughing and smiling at each other. But back to Colin, he wanted to have a photo of the both of us and even asked me to sign it. And of course, that is when Nott passed by and started making fun of the fact that I was handing out signed photos. He shouted about it and everyone started looking at us. Colin wanted to stand up for me and said Nott was just jealous, but that only made it worse. Nott asked what he should be jealous of. Of the fact that I had a foul scar right across my head, or of the fact that I was bent. And he said a signed photo of me would be useless now that I had started shacking Professor Lockhart.
Malfoy shakes his head. ‘I was born deaf,’ he writes.
The Dark Lord waves Rookwood away. Rookwood stands up and finds another seat further along the table. The Dark Lord’s eyes find Draco. He pats the seat beside him. Draco nods and takes his new place. He’s been promoted. Draco knows this will save his mother, they both won’t die tonight. But it will also mean that his faith is sealed. Before Easter break is over he will wear the mark on his arm. He’ll be one of the Death Eaters, and his betrayal will be complete.
“Forget about him,” Ron says. “He’s in Slytherin. I’m sure his housemates will look after him.” Ron looks at the doors and then at the empty plates in front of them. “Do you think it will be long before the first years are here? I’m hungry.”
Harry sits down next to him. “Yes, sorry about that. Just a little gay panic.”
‘Study session in the library tomorrow?’ Harry writes.
Hermione puffs. “Please God, help us,” she says. “The Potter brothers are going to get themselves killed.”
“Yeah, it’s when I met Malfoy for the first time, all up and mighty. He reminded me of Dudley. What has that got to do with anything?”
“Can you believe they suddenly treat him like a hero again?” Pansy asks. “They spend months saying he’s deranged and dangerous. And now that he’s dead, it’s all praise and glory for the little man.”
Once the tents were done, Draco and I went out to get some water from the tap. It was amazing to see the many wizards and witches around us. I never really thought about how many there were in Britain, let alone in the entire world. And there were little kids with magic, playing with their parents' wands and flying small broomsticks. Draco saw me gaping at them and he told me he still has his somewhere at the manor if I wanted to go give it a try. I pushed him a little away from me and we both laughed before our hands linked again. I felt really good that day, just hanging with Draco at a campsite filled with people from all over the world that were just as magical as me.
I told Sirius what Hermione was up to and he wrote back to wish her good luck with trying to accomplish the impossible. I also wrote to him about Moody and his mistreatment of Draco. I know Sirius doesn’t really like the fact that Draco and I are together, but he said that I should tell him when Moody goes too far. And that he would write Moody to ask him to tone it down a little, to not think that my friends are the same as their parents. It’s nice to see Sirius look out for me and Draco. I’d never known how good it is to have an adult that will always be on my side, no matter what happens. So thank you for making him my godfather and making sure I’d have someone now that both of you are gone.
Neville and Harry both laugh as Ron looks affronted. It’s not easy for Ron, Harry knows this. His best friend wants to have a father with an exciting job, just as Harry and Neville’s dad. It’s not his fault his father just loves Muggle artefacts more than he loves fighting criminals.
Harry closes his eyes and shakes his head. “Not your fault, Draco. You’ve done everything by the book from the moment we knew. This is not on you.”
"I know, Blaise. And I will, I promise,” Harry snaps. Blaise is the one to talk. He left Draco to deal with it on his own the last time. Harry hasn’t forgotten that Blaise was there the first time it happened, that he’d just had sat by and done nothing while Draco was slowly killing himself.
Remus doesn’t say anything. Harry knows Remus still feels guilty for not being there that night. Not that anyone ever blamed him. He was at St Mungo's to support his husband. It was a bad time. And Lily and James survived, Lestrange got caught and Harry wasn’t harmed. It could have been so much worse. Harry could have become an orphan just like Neville. But now that the Dementor is gone Harry can appreciate how amazing his life has been up to now. He’s a lucky boy and he will never forget it again.
“Just remember that there’s always hope and that I’ll always love you,” Harry says. He opens the fingers of his hand and Draco can’t do anything but watch Harry’s arm slip from his hand. He squeezes into Harry’s arm, but it’s no use. The arm is slippery from the rain and it slowly slips out of Draco’s grip.
“Well, what is it then?” Draco asks. He knew mentioning the night with Blaise would get her to talk. He doesn’t feel like waiting all night for her to open up. He’s got an early start tomorrow, and he would like to get to bed in time.
Neville lets his head drop back down and sighs. “Fuck,” he says. “Harry, tell me what happened.”
“I think she’s off on one of her cruises again. I’ll pop by the Manor tomorrow when Teddy is at the nursery and see if she’s there,” Andromeda says.
“Ew, gross,” Teddy says. He struggles to get out of Harry’s lap and then walks towards the door. “I’m opening my presents,” he tells them.
“Keep your voice down,” Harry snaps while he looks around them. Nobody sits close      enough to overhear them, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. “Nobody is to know.”
“You tell me later today what that is all about, alright?” Harry says.
Malfoy blinks with his eyes. His writing is shaky. ‘I didn’t struggle,’ he writes.
“Yes, of course,” Hermione says as if it’s nothing.
"It's okay, sweetheart, " Harry tells him. Draco gets pulled against Harry's chest and is enfolded in his arms. He cries against the naked flesh in front of him. Everything is falling apart. Harry should take him now. He's fertile and ready. What does it matter that Draco isn't into it? They need to do this, need to make it work somehow. Draco needs Harry to believe that his dreams can still come true. Draco needs Harry to stay with him. It’s the only thing that keeps him sane and away from the pain potions that stand in the back of the cabinet in the general bathroom. Without Harry, he won’t be able to stop himself from taking them to make the pain inside his heart float away.
When Draco was swimming some laps I took of my own clothes and joined him in the bath. It was so deep that my feet barely touched the bottom. Draco swam to me and wasted no time before he started to kiss me. And it didn’t just stay with kissing. For the first time, we had more space than our small bed and it was just perfect. He turned me around so I could lean over the edge while he entered me, his hands roaming over my body. It was amazing and we both found pleasure and were still having when we both had a heart attack. Out of nowhere, someone said that this was quite the show. We turned around and spotted Myrtle sitting cross-legged on top of the taps.
The game then began with the Bulgarian mascots, Veela’s. It was crazy to see how they impacted all the man around us, except for me, Draco and Sirius. Sometimes it’s nice to be bent and not interested in women. We could hear Draco’s mother whisper to his father to get a grip and Mr Tonks was on the front of his seat to get a better look. Tonks pulled him back to make sure he wouldn’t fall out of the box. Next were the Leprechauns, the Irish mascots. They made it rain gold, but Sirius warned us that the gold would disappear so that it was no use trying to catch it.
“Don’t cry, Draco. It’s Christmas,” Teddy says.
I still can’t believe how much has changed in the last month. After everything that happened the night of my last exam, the world has turned upside down. Sirius has been cleared from all charges and he’s now my official guardian. This means that I’m not writing to you from 4 Privet Drive but from 12 Grimmauld Place. I’ve got my own room. It’s the first room we properly cleaned together when I came home for summer break. The house is really dirty, and there is this house-elf that keeps complaining and saying nasty things about Sirius. I liked Dobby better, he was crazy, but at least he was fun. I’ve asked Draco if he knew whatever happened to Dobby after he freed him, but he has no idea.
“We promised dad,” Harry says. “You can’t go after him.”
“Nobody,” Neville says. His cheeks turn red and Harry shakes his head. He signs ‘Ginny’ and Neville nods.
Harry drops his head to the back of the sofa and moans softly. Why are these people his friends?
Not long after that, we were reunited with the Weasleys and we went into Gringotts to get money to buy school supplies. Fred and George wanted to know all about Knockturn Alley, saying their parents never let them go there. Mr Weasley fixed my glasses by the way with a simple spell. I should ask him about that tomorrow, I’m sure it will come in handy this coming school year. I told Hermione I had seen Draco and his father in Borgin and Burkes, but couldn’t continue because Mr Weasley asked if Lucius Malfoy bought anything. When I told him he was selling, Mr Weasley sported a familiar grim and was saying that he’d love to get Mr Malfoy for something. Mrs Weasley responded in a sharp tone that he should be careful, that the Malfoy family’s trouble. They almost started arguing inside the bank, but Mr Weasley noticed that Hermione’s parents are muggles and he got distracted because of that.
Teddy runs back into the room with his Teddy-bear in his hands. He climbs on the sofa, pulls off his shoes and pushes his feet underneath Draco’s blanket. His little toes tickle Draco’s feet, and he smiles.
“I am,” James says. “Because we got you something amazing for your birthday.”
“Oh, having a baby is a hardship for our Saviour and his whore?” the Auror laughs.
We had dinner at the Leaky Cauldron. The five of us ate our way through five delicious courses. Draco’s mother was a bit hesitant to eat there, but Mrs Tonks promised her it was good food and that it was nice to not have to think about which fork to use. After dinner, we were all full and sleepy. Hermione her parents came to pick her up and the rest of used the floo to get back home. Draco is staying with at the moment. His father is off on some business trip and won’t notice that he’s not at home. His mother is also here at the Tonks. I think she really loves hanging out with her sister.
“Anyway,” Draco continued. “I was telling you about our visitor that you missed yesterday—Barbara Sterling? From the Productive Use of Dark Magic Department?”
“Brilliant,” Harry laughed, looking relieved. “Zacharias Smith made such a huge fuss about it the last time she escaped. It’s not my fault Smith wasn't wearing any shoes. Sheila was hungry, and his toes looked like blood sausages!” he continued. “It’s only natural, really.”
“I don’t know what to do, Ron! Draco’s everywhere I turn!”
,” Draco smiled, eyeing Harry’s neck like he was hungry for it. He somehow managed to restrain himself…. for the moment.
Draco pursed his lips as he watched the Pygmy Puff, unimpressed. “I personally prefer my dessert to have more bite to it, but I suppose this will do.”
Harry leaned into him even more. “
Deep circles under his eyes ‘cause blokes like him never sleep. He leans against the shop window of Borgin and Burkes and lights up a ciggy with a nonverbal. He brings it to his mouth and breathes in deep, then lets the smoke out nice and slow.
Then some new guy walks right in front of me, bark-laughing all loud and hearty with some girl beside him. He’s a tall, lanky bloke with orange hair, and the girl’s got bushy, curly hair. They look like Ron and ‘Mione but they’re not. I haven’t seen them since I left to start polyjuicing it up on the streets two years back.
Two pairs of wide eyes stare at him.
,” he said. “Monday doesn’t particularly care for sweets. Perhaps one for Rotsley, though.”
I think I found a couple of strands of this homeless bloke’s hair before he jumped in front of that train. But I don’t remember, to be honest. And I don’t remember finishing brewing this batch of Polyjuice or adding his hair, but I know I did. I don’t try to think too hard about it because I can’t. I don’t really care. As long as no one recognizes me, it doesn’t matter how I got here.
Switzly watched them, pursing her lips. “Switzly will find the Malfoys a good,
“Fucking hell, Potter,” I continue. If I knew how to be angry, I would be. “I’m not going away with you. My father’s just died.”
“We have many more,” Draco smiled indulgently. “My personal favourite is the electrocution chair.” He turned to Harry. “It reminds me of our first date,
Draco immediately snapped his full attention over to Harry. “Oh
Draco squinted at the Pygmy Puffs as he stepped forward to take a closer look at them. His eyes became more and more alarmed as he observed them. “What...
Draco and Harry walked over to the plant section and stood at the beginning of the aisle, not entering yet.
, you have the most
Draco surveyed the options very seriously. He squinted at the descriptions of each Bludger type.
These young chaps are all the same; so bloody full of life until they actually live it.
“So true, darling. He always enjoyed
Then he hears two infuriatingly familiar voices from inside:
You look at me, and the veins in your eyes are very, very red. “Kingsley and Robards. Well, mostly Kingsley, actually. He was also saying that”—your hand starts clenching—“in this Ministry job, I could start a family.” You take another swig of whiskey from the bottle. “He was saying that it would be good if I had a family. If I started young, and all. People would like to see that I’m doing alright; that I’m happy.”
“Please don’t,” Switzly whispered, not loud enough for them to hear. She rang them up as quickly as she could. Which was not very quick, given that she kept looking up at them every three seconds, wary and nervous—and for good reason.
Draco’s mouth felt very, very dry. “Dean Thomas.” He swallowed. Dean had been very gentle, kind, and understanding about Draco’s lack of experience and need to keep their relationship a secret.
“Ready to get the plants?” Harry asked, breathless. His neck and throat were red with Draco’s teeth indents scattered deep along his skin. (Draco eyed him, pleased).
Fancy’s wearing some purple leather trousers and nothing else. I can see his ribs staring at me like they want me to bite them. They’re sharp, poky. I don’t think there’s much meat on them.
Draco had turned very red in the face, and also seemed very happy with the sudden turn of events. “
“What a special treat for those girls,” Harry grinned. He took a closer look at Monday’s letter. “Oh… and Monday says Abigail was also foaming at the mouth and gnashing her teeth at the fourth years! Sounds like a case of Acro-Rabies to me. Those girls must be having so much fun with her.”
I get it. I change up my Polyjuice every so often so I can be whoever I want, do whatever I want. No one knows me, and I like it so bloody much, I think this is what it’s like to be happy.
“He completely
“Leave that bloody article in the street, Draco. We’ve got around fifty of them at the house. And put a shirt on—you look like a fucking skeleton.”
As we were saying our vows, I caught a glimpse of two familiar stony faces at the back of the pews.  I was angry, but Draco said they wanted to come.
“Let me take a look.” Harry squinted at the receipt and shook his head. Then he turned to Draco. “We should leave more Galleons, don’t you think?”
My heart goes cold and stutters. Why would he say that? He knows about— I told him. The faded scar tissue on my hand tingles.
Harry laughed. “Yeah, I’m just fucking with you,” he said. “Although, we did have some fun with it back in fifth year.”
“Right. My campaign forced me to hire that mudblood queer for diversity publicity,” Father said, shaking his head. “Bloody disgusting. When I caught him with you like that—in your own bedroom…” He shuddered. “We’re fortunate that Mind Healer Umbridge helped sort you out after what he did.”
without it. Either way, what bliss,” he said, leaning further against Harry, wanting more.
You can have anything you want,
“Having a son won’t fix you, Potter.”
Switzly gulped, then managed to snap herself out of the aghast state she was under. “Switzly shouldn’t even be surprised anymore,” she whispered. “Yet she always is.”
,” he teased.
Harry frowned. “I didn’t know we donated to them. I thought I sent the Galleons to the Celebration of Dark Magic Festival…”
The shop-elf’s eyes widened in alarm. She opened her mouth to respond, but before she could, Draco scoffed, “
,” he said. “Perfecting Unforgivables, teaching our children dark duelling, and wearing these joggers?” He trailed his lips along Harry’s neck. “You’re taunting me,
And I want to kill this ginger tosser for blocking my view of Fancy, but I figure he just wants to have some fun while he’s still here. Live.
“Who is he, Father?” Draco had been expecting this conversation ever since he returned home from university, yet his chest still grew heavy.
“Perfect.” Harry grinned wide like he didn’t know how to stop. “I’ll take the lot!”
A cold weight settles in Draco’s chest. He pauses at the door. Well, he thought that Harry
“Yeah,” you breathe. You’re watching the ceiling, studying it. Your lips part slightly. “The dead stay dead, I know.”
They didn’t hear her. Draco shoved Harry hard, further into the shelf, and continued biting Harry’s throat, teeth out and tongue swiping along his neck.
The kittens were small and warm and soft. They mewled, and Draco felt very large, but also very insignificant. It was nice, he thought, to take care of something that wasn’t himself. He looked at Harry. “I’m Draco, by the way.”
“It’s alright,” Harry said. “I think we still have a little bit of Greyback’s flank left in the deep freeze. We can give that meat to her as a treat before we go to the Ministry Ball when the time comes.”
“Right.” I follow you.
Draco was upset when I told him I didn't want to invite Petunia and Vernon.
“It depends,” Harry said. “We like to switch it up every night.”
.” He moved even closer to Harry and smiled wickedly. “In fact, I am feeling a bit…
“Mmm,” Draco smirked, turning to face Harry. “Foaming at the mouth, gnashing teeth… that sounds like how you woke me up this morning,” he said, low. “You were like some deranged, growling Manticore; you frightened me.”
Tosser’s mouth is plump and smeared with red lippy, and he looks pretty goddamn smug, smiling with his crooked teeth out. The whites of his eyes glitter when I jolt the bus past some street lights as we near the slums of the city. To be honest with you, Potter, he’s not too hard on the eyes.
Quidditch practise was every day during the holidays. Marcus wanted us to be ready for the match on the 23rd. We’d have endless discussions about tactics and Marcus kept drilling into me that I was only allowed to catch the snitch if we were more than 50 points ahead of Gryffindor. They had a lead of 200 points, so we needed more than that to win the cup this year. Draco would hide his laughter against my shoulders every time Marcus brought it up again.
Wednesday and Thursday pass by in the same manner. And now it’s the last day of the week, and Harry has another Quidditch practice tonight. But first, he makes his way to the library and sits down in his now regular spot.
Speaking of Draco, he still isn’t back, so I think I’ll go look for him to tell him what happened during my Deviation exam.
“Of course, he wants our help,” Harry says. “You can’t think he likes being all alone all the time. And he must struggle with school. You of all people should be upset by that.”
“Father will be upset,” Draco signs. “And I’ll have nobody to help me at home. None of the other elves are like Dobby.”
After the feast, we made it upstairs and Draco got into bed with me. Blaise said he was going to find out a way to get in even though he isn’t even seventeen and Draco said he would join him. I fell asleep that night, dreaming of Draco holding up a big cup, being the TriWizard champion, and smiling down at me saying he couldn’t have done it without me.
I’m going to sleep now,
After that headmaster Dumbledore awarded Ron and I both Special Awards for Services to the School and he gave out points for the house cup. Neville got 100 points for finding help, Ron got 150 points for facing danger to save a friend and he gave me 200 points for bravery and courage to face the Basilisk to save the boy I love. Professor McGonagall escorted Ron and Neville back to their own common room and Professor Snape took Professor Lockhart to the hospital wing, leaving me alone with the headmaster. He first thanked me for showing real loyalty to him and then he told me something disturbing. The only reason why I can speak Parseltongue is because Lord Voldemort can, as a last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin. Headmaster Dumbledore thinks that Voldemort has transferred some of his own powers into me the night he killed you. I don’t know what to think of that. It scares me. I wondered if I was only Slytherin because of that part in Voldemort inside me since you both had been Gryffindors. Headmaster Dumbledore assured me that the hat would see more than just the little part of Voldemort that is inside me and that I myself had qualities that Salazar himself valued in his students, like my determination and cleverness. He also said that I cherish the once I love abidingly and unconditionally and that that was very Slytherin of me. And then he continued that I could have also been in Gryffindor because I also have a lot of traits that are part of that house, like my bravery (even though I don’t feel brave most of the time) and my heroic actions last year and now. And the fact that I had pulled Gryffindor’s sword out of the head should tell me that house placements aren’t as black and white as we would like to pretend. And that I shouldn’t worry about the small part of Voldemort inside me because that was not what made me the person that I am or determent my placement in Slytherin.
Harry nods. He closes his potions book. He hasn’t written a single word for his essay in the last half hour. Snape will be happy when he can again take points from Gryffindor. Harry doesn’t care anymore.
Hermione said that Headmaster Dumbledore was really angry, furious even that the Dementors had come onto the grounds. He had slowed my fall and then magicked me onto a stretcher and walked me up to the school. Draco had run after him, just like Hermione, Blaise, Greg and Daphne. Greg said they were afraid they had to comfort Draco because they thought I was dead. His voice trailed off a little and I just squeezed Draco’s hand to comfort him.
“You feeling any better?” Harry asks.
Harry doesn’t think about it. He opens his hand and his wand drops to the floor. It bounces a couple of times. The sound echoes around them in the empty library. Harry doesn’t take his eyes off Draco as his wand rolls out of his reach. Draco’s eyes on the other hand follow the wand to where it stops in its tracks. When Harry gets a chance, he knows exactly where his wand now lies.
Pettigrew groans.
Ginny sits up straight. “Oh fuck, that’s why he doesn’t talk?”
The next day there was another letter, now address to me in the smallest bedroom at 4 Privet Drive. And again uncle Vernon didn’t let me read the letter, but I was convinced they would try to send more so I made a plan. I was going to wait for the postman on the corner of the street, but uncle Vernon was waiting for me at the doormat when I came downstairs the next morning, so I couldn’t get to the postmen before he delivered our mail. When the post came I saw that there now were three letters for me, but again uncle Vernon tore them up. He didn’t go to work that day and nailed up the mail slot. But more letters kept coming. On Friday there where twelve letters pushed under the door and around the cracks of the window of the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon burned them all and started to hammer and nail up all the cracks around the doors. The next day there where twenty-four letters in the eggs. Yes, you read it correctly; they were hidden inside the eggs! On Sunday letters came flying from the fireplace filling up the house. Uncle Vernon made us leave the house. We drove for hours without breaks or anything to eat. Dudley was howling at the end of the day. We stayed in a hotel and the next morning the owner brought us a letter, addressed to me, in room 17 Railview Hotel in Cokeworth.  She said she had about a hundred of them at the front desk. But I still didn’t get to read them.
Madam Pomfrey ordered that they both stay overnight, to make sure they get the rest they need.
“Draco, I’ve been wondering. And I think I need this, need to know that this isn’t something Voldemort did to me by turning me into his final Horcrux,” Harry continues.
Harry James Potter.
Draco took over all the responsibility for Buckbeak’s appeal. He’s always faster with his homework than me, and once he was done he would pore over enormously thick volumes with names like ‘the handbook of Hippogriff psychology’ and ‘Fowl or Foul? A study of Hippogriff Brutality’. And he did all this next to helping me with my homework. I think I’m really dating the smartest boy in this school.
“Who cares about the girlish squad!” Neville shouts. His hands tremble and his fork falls on the table.
Harry lifts his head a little. “You seem excited,” Harry says.
I’m crying now. I haven’t cried in a long time. But being here, all alone at Privet Drive, not having my friends nearby to talk to, it makes me sad.
“Shit,” Harry says. “It’s the girlish squad.” He quickly steps forward, in the hope Lavender and Parvati don’t decide to come out and join them.
“I love you,” Draco states.
“Just thinking about how everyone I know is taller than me,” Harry says.
“Or, he’s hiding in plain sight, and we just haven’t figured out yet how he does it,” Ron says.
When Draco started Hogwarts, he missed the afternoons hidden away in the passage the most. At Hogwarts nobody died, nobody made potions in all colours of the rainbow that inflicted pain and suffering to the persons taking it. School was boring.
And things got even worse when Professor McGonagall came into her study. She was leading Nott who started shouting that he was going to catch me because I had a dragon. Professor McGonagall was very angry and told us it was wrong to make up lies to get back on students. Even worse was that Draco had tried to help Harry and had already lost Slytherin points and scored himself a detention because of the cock-and-bull story about a dragon I had made up. She said she thought Granger would have more sense and that she had expected me to be better than this. We all got detentions and she took fifty points each from our houses. I tried to plead with her to not take that many points, but she said that I couldn’t tell her was she could and couldn’t do. She would also report us to Snape.
Neville and Harry laugh. Harry leans his head on Hermione’s shoulder. “He’s better when he’s asleep,” he tells her.
I did what you asked of me, dad. I broke the connection and made a run for the port key. It was hard with my broken leg, but I managed to step through the pain and make it. I grabbed hold of Cedric’s body and then the port key. I was swirled away and landed back in the Quidditch pitch at Hogwarts.
We spent the morning in the common room with our friends, close to the fire. I was sitting in Draco’s lap and Adrian shouted we should go cool down in the snow outside. He and his friends had just come back from a massive snow fight. And after lunch we took his advise and went for a stroll in the cold. Close to the castle, the snow was a mess, but the farther away we walked around the lake, the more untouched snow was around us. It was a nice afternoon, until Draco insisted we go back because he had to get ready (like three hours before the ball even started). He made me put a very elaborate braid in his hair, which took me like four tries to get right. But it made him look so beautiful, it was worth all the effort.
“Harry, he clearly wants to be alone,” Hermione says. “You can’t force him to talk.”
And then there is the extra homework we’ve gotten from the Ministry of Magic. Draco and I passed all the tests with flying colours and it’s official now. We are bonded by the Corpora Anima Una bond. We’ve gotten all these extra books we need to read to understand what it all means. It also means we get special treatment in the case of injuries and stuff because it will affect both of us. I wondered if it could also mean that we have to take all our exams together, that would help me loads with potions. Hermione told me not to be silly and Draco told me I should just study harder. I need to go find me a new best friend and boyfriend that aren’t so against cheating. But well, that’s never going to happen because I love them both too much to let them go.
Harry looks at his trainers. One of the laces is coming loose. Harry leans forward to tighten it.
Dear mom and dad,
Draco is now giving me a weird look, he doesn’t think Sirius being impressed with my flying is important. He’s still upset that Black told him that I could never date a Malfoy. It seems Black knows Draco’s father from his school days too and they weren’t friends.
“Yes, I did,” Harry says. The soft cries for Hermione were kind of hilarious. Ron says he doesn’t want her in any other way than just friends. But Harry isn’t stupid. The way Ron acted today says it all. He would never volunteer to go to Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop instead of Zonko’s Joke Shop. He doesn’t care about quills at all. It was just that Hermione wanted to go there so badly. Harry didn’t mind. He was fine going wherever, as long as Draco was tagging along. Draco loved Scrivenshaft’s. He got himself some new quills and fresh parchment. He even found parchment that you can reuse. Everything you write on it disappears after a couple of minutes. It’s perfect for when Draco has to explain something. Not that he has to write down everything anymore. He’s made great progress with his BSL. He can follow more and more of what Harry says to him. It’s nice that he doesn’t always have to write down everything. It’s better to be able to look at each other when they speak.
Nott offered one of the badges to Hermione but told her not to touch his hand, that he didn’t want it to get slimed up by a Mudblood. And that seemed to be too much for Draco. He reached for his wand and everyone around us was backing away. Nott also pulled out his wand. They both cast a spell. Draco went for Funnunculus and Nott used Densaugeo. Jets of light shot from both wands and hit each other in midair. They ricocheted off at angles, one hitting Crabbe who got great ugly boils on his nose. The other hit Hermione. Ron was next to her in seconds to help her. Her teeth were growing at an alarming rate, making her look like a beaver. This is when Snape arrived. He sent Crabbe and Hermione to the hospital wing and he gave Draco and Nott detention.
“Well, thank you, Draco. I’m glad someone over the age of ten appreciates my lemonade,” Molly says. She smiles at him, and her eyes sparkle. “And I’m happy for you and Harry.”
“I don’t want to die,” Potter said when the screams of the Mudblood had stopped. Aunt Bella had laughed and we’d had known, she was dead and gone.
Hermione shakes her head in her disapproving way and Neville pretends to study a plant close to the water edge. They all sit and enjoy the September sun that still shines bright. It won’t be long before it gets too cold to sit outside, and Harry will hate being stuck in the castle for all of winter. But for now, he will enjoy this time outside with his friends. Hermione has already taken out a book and Ron has gone to see what kind of plant Neville found.
Oh, I must tell you about Fred and George, you remember Ron’s brothers. They are the only students, next to Hermione, that don’t think I am the heir of Slytherin. They make jokes about it all the time. When they see me walking down a corridor, they come to march ahead of me, shouting: ‘Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through.’ And making jokes like: ‘Harry’s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea whit his fanged servant.’  It makes me feel a little better to know that there are at least two other people that think it’s ludicrous that I’m the heir of Slytherin.
I think that is all for now. I’m doing really good and I’m happy. Still miss you both, but it’s good.
Moments later I turned a corner and spotted a Dementor. Without thinking I draw on one of my happiest memories of time spent with Draco and cast a perfect Patronus. My Stag galloped towards the Dementor, who tripped over its own ropes. It turned out it was a Boggart and not a Dementor. Even easier to deal with. I just shouted Riddikulus and the Boggart was gone.
“Ron is going to kill you,” Harry says. “No doubt about that. He’s too protective about his little sister.”
Harry takes the glass and stares at the liquid inside it. James sits down on the small garden bench beside Harry. Harry’s mind races. He isn’t sure how he should answer his father’s question. Harry loves being home and spending time with his family. But he can’t get Draco out of his mind and his heart keeps aching. It’s as if Harry can’t enjoy anything anymore now that Draco has rejected him.
So Hagrid was back at teaching and that left me with only the stupid egg to worry about. Cedric had given me a clue, a couple of days after the ball. He’d told me to go take a bath with the egg. He even gave up the password for the prefects' bathroom. And since Draco and I still hadn’t figured out what the egg was all about, we decided it was time to try out Cedric’s hint and explore the prefects' bathroom. We went at night, tom make sure we would have enough time and that we wouldn’t be disturbed. We used to cloak and the Marauders Map to make sure nobody would spot us out of bed.
When James looks back at Harry, he knows he needs to say it. Not for his dad, or anyone else, but for himself. He knows this is him and that it’s never going to change. It’s time to stop hiding it and pretending he might one day fall for a girl.
“And what if it is because I died during the war? What if it’s because I once housed a part of Voldemort’s soul inside my body? Who knows how that fucked me up,” Harry says.
Weasley steps up next to Granger and takes a hold of her hand. He looks at Draco and nods his head. “He died last night,” he says. His voice is flat and broken.
Draco nods in confirmation. Harry’s arms slide around Draco’s waist, and he rests his head on Draco’s back. “It’s okay to be sad,” Harry says.
Harry looks back at Neville. “Please don’t. He’s not gay. And I don’t want to lose him as a friend.”
I’ll write again when Draco is here and tell you all about my party and the Quidditch World Cup.
“It hurts, it hurts so fucking much,” Draco stutters.
“Uncle Harry kissed you and then placed his hand on your belly,” Teddy says without any doubt, not taking his eyes of Dragon who is flying above the table. Teddy’s hair has turned the same dark green as the stuffed animal. Andromeda says that Tonks was the same around this age, constantly changing her hair colour without even realising it. It’s a good thing; it means that Teddy is more like his mother than his father. It will make full moons so much easier down the line. Harry had been worried about it once he read about young werewolf children having to go through that change every couple of weeks and how they would get locked up alone to make sure they wouldn’t hurt anyone. Harry said he would never leave Teddy to go through something like that alone. So when Teddy changed his hair colour to platinum about a year ago, when Draco was comforting him after he fell from his little broom, Draco had cried in relief. He wouldn’t have to fear for his lover's life every couple of weeks because he would go and lock himself in with a baby werewolf.
“That makes two of us, Malfoy.”
Love you both,
He should get a new name tag. The one next to the door still says Harry Potter & Draco Malfoy. It will be just Harry Potter from now on. That was clear when Harry had come home last night from his week-long training in Scotland. When he’d found the house empty, all Draco’s possessions gone. He didn’t even leave a note. Just disappeared from Harry’s life like the last couple of years didn’t matter at all.
And Uncle Vernon has kept true to his word. I’m locked in my room. A man has fit bars on my window and uncle Vernon made a cat-flap in the bedroom door, where they pass through small amounts of food. I only get let out to use the bathroom in the morning and evening. Otherwise, I’m to stay here, in my room, by myself, all alone, with no way of escape.
It’s still early morning and there is no rush. But still, Draco doesn’t think he can get out of bed. He knows he promised Lily that they would go to the park today. And maybe in some time, he will find a way to move without puking all over himself, but right now he just wants to lay still in his bed and not think about what it means that he’s sick for no reason.
Draco agrees and then gets up when James and Madam Pomfrey step out of her office again.
We grabbed our trunks and began to drag them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors. When we were at the foot of the front steps we could see Professor Snape standing at the top. He asked us why we didn’t arrive on the school train. He looked troubled and I wondered if he had been worried about us. That maybe he does care about our wellbeing, even though I’m one of his least favourite students and I kind of thought that he was trying to steal the sorcerers stone last year.
“You’re sure?” Harry asks.
Draco places a kiss on Hermione’s forehead and then one on Rose’s. “I’ll see you both soon,” he says. Then he takes Harry’s hand, and together they walk out of the room.
“So, he’ll be close to Hogwarts,” Neville says. Neville drums his feet against the floor. His eyes sparkle as he pulls the Daily Prophet away from Harry.
Dear mom and dad,
“Where have you been?” Ron asks when Harry sits down next to him.
Your Harry James Potter.
“What is wrong with that man?” Lily asks. She places a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
“Yes, now it matters what Slytherin does against the other teams,” Neville says. “And if they win, with how many points.”
A hand and cloth slide over the bark of the broom. Harry follows it with his eyes. It’s his hand, even though it doesn’t feel like it belongs to Harry. It has moved over the broom a million times by now. Harry should stop and put his broom away. But the idea of not having anything to do is frightening. Harry wants to stay busy.
“Let’s go get some dinner,” Neville says. “We don’t want Ron to go hungry.”
“Yeah,” James says. He looks at Harry and then back at Pomfrey. “I didn’t teach him that,” he says.
“Yes, we can try,” Draco says. His voice sounds hollow. It’s just going to be another reminder of how hopeless this whole situation is. But if Harry wants to try, then Draco will do it. Whatever it takes to keep Harry with him as long as possible.
Dear mom and dad,
Draco bites his bottom lip and nods. Of course, his mother would notice. Just as she noticed that Draco didn’t want the Dark Mark on his arm. She probably already knows. There is no point in hiding the truth from her. There never was. It’s silly Draco thought he could keep this secret from his mother.
Draco turns towards Harry and sings: “See you at dinner?”
Ron was sorted in Gryffindor and he looked happy to be there. I wish I was sorted into Gryffindor as well, at least then I would have had one friend in the dormitory. Now the only person that even says hi to me is Zabini.
Hermione rolls her eyes. “I told him I didn’t want them here. The horror stories from Fleur of how Molly kept barging into the room while she was giving birth to Victoire. And how she just decided to stay in the room when Fleur had Dominique. No, thank you. And now I get some time with my two favourite boys before the hordes decent on us.”
I’ve been thinking about it, touching Draco, seeing him without his clothes. Ever since Christmas. And during our Valentines date, I found out he thought about it too. We had a lovely picnic beside the lake. Draco had managed to get an order in for picnic food from Hogsmeade. It was lovely. After we finished the food we took a walk around the lake until we ended up at the Quidditch changing rooms. Draco pushed me inside and we started snugging. And before I knew it Draco was pushing my sweater over my head and stroking his hands all over my bare torso. Well, I’m sure you don’t want to read all the details. It ended with Draco’s shirt on the ground too and his hand down my trousers, wrapped around me. Fuck, that felt good, to have his hands on me. I repaid him the favour after the match against Ravenclaw and I can say it’s just as hot as having his hands on me.
“Yes, you would have been,” Draco agrees.
“I don’t want to get promoted. I want to get out,” Draco answers. He tries not to sound irritated. It’s not Harry’s fault that this mad man has the capability to ruin everything good in Draco’s life.
“But Uncle Sirius,” Iris starts.
“You still have other friends who would love to go with you,” James says.
“What did she mean by that?” Ron asks.
‘Deal,’ Harry writes. He can’t help but smile at Malfoy.
Lucius stops and turns around. He doesn’t face Lily head-on, but stays at an angle, ready to continue his walk away from them all. “No, you may not,” he sneers. “We want nothing to do with blood traitors like you.”
Harry leaves the butter and picks up a slice of bread. He takes a bite and forces his jaws to move. Even toasted the bread is still uneatable. He drops the slice and walks out of the kitchen. A picture of him and Draco still stands on the cupboard in the hallway. Harry looks at it. They smile and look so happy. Harry remembers when it was taken. They had just moved in together. All was right then with the world.
By the next morning, Ron his bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size and the cut had turned a nasty shade of green. Draco said that it is what you get if you mess with dangerous animals. Ron had to go to the hospital wing and when Hermione and I went to visit him at the end of the day he was even worse. We told him he should just rest and that we would take care of the dragon on Saturday. With Ron out of the picture, I could tell Hermione about the cloak and we could do it together, just her and me. And we really needed the cloak, since Crabbe had stopped by at the hospital wing to borrow a book from Ron, the book with Charlie’s letter in there. Meaning Crabbe and Nott would know that we are going to get rid of Norbert on Saturday.
But back to Sirius his love life. He’s struggling. He pretends he’s okay with Professor Lupin moving on. And he said he’s glad that Remus is happy. Doesn’t change the fact that I’ve heard him cry a couple of times now when he thinks we are asleep. He’s been talking to you, dad. I’ve heard him, telling you he wished you were here to make him see that everything will be alright, just like you used to do when you were younger. He misses you. He needs his best friend now that the man he loves has moved on. I know you would be here if you could, that you didn’t want to die on us. But we do miss you and we still love you. I wish I could ask you what I do to make Sirius feel better, to get him to smile more. He hardly smiles anymore. I’m truly worried.
Harry’s mind brings up a blank. What else could they get him that is related to Quidditch? Unless it has something to do with the World Cup that starts in two weeks. He shoots up and looks at his dad. Did they really? Will Harry go to the Quidditch final? But mum said it was too expensive. And Harry doesn’t want them to struggle because of his dream.
Harry James Potter
“Wow,” Harry says.
“I know,” Harry says.
I still have bad days, where everything just seems to be too much. Draco gives me the strength to face those days and without him here, well some days I don’t leave my room at all. The Dursleys don’t care, they are happy to see as little as possible of me. Miss Davis has given me some exercises to do this summer that will help me fight the negative thoughts. She says they are Muggle techniques, so they don’t acquire me to use magic. I have to write down all my negative thoughts I have in a notebook she has given to me and then write behind them why they are not true and what I can think about instead to make it better. And I also have to write down when something good happens, so I can remember all the good things in my life when I’m having a bad day. I haven’t written down a lot of things yet since I’ve been mostly just been alone here. Writing down the negative thoughts is easier until I have to figure out why they aren’t true and what I should think instead. But I’m trying and that is all Miss Davis asked of me.
We took a place in the stands and Ron and Neville brought binoculars so we could see even better. Lee Jordan, a friend of Ron’s brothers was giving commentary for the match and it was clear that he wanted Gryffindor to win. It was a very exciting game and my friends around me cheered when Gryffindor score the first goal. I pretended to be outraged about this and we had a good laugh. Hagrid came to join us and he asked me how I was doing. I told him I was good. I didn’t mention that the bullying is still going on and all the others were too involved in the game to tell Hagrid otherwise. Gryffindor got a penalty and scored again. Dean started shouting that they should hand out a red card, making me and Hermione laugh. Ron, Neville and Seamus didn’t understand which made it even more amusing. And when Slytherin scored I cheered for my team. Ron tried to muffle my screams by placing his hand over my mouth, but I just batted it away. It was good fun. Slytherin scored five more times after that and Ron and Seamus were getting upset that I was still cheering them on. But in the end, the Gryffindor Seeker caught the Snitch and Gryffindor won by one hundred and seventy to sixty.
Professor Snape made us come to his office and we missed the entire welcome feast. Ron looked around in amazement, never have been in Professor Snape’s office before. I wish it had been my first time there, but I had to go and see him a couple of times last year when I had gotten into trouble. It turned out we had been seen, by multiple muggles. When I learnt that, I knew we were in big trouble and for a moment I was afraid we would get expelled. Why hadn’t I fought harder with Ron to not take the car, but just to wait for his parents? I’m sure there would have been another way for us to get to Hogwarts. One that wouldn’t end me up in detention on the first day back at school.
“WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW, WEASEL!” Draco shouts in the other room. Harry and Pansy both jump up. Harry doesn’t waste any time to get back to Draco. The sight in front of him frightens him. Draco has his wand out, pointed at Ron. His arm shakes, and his face is red. Ron has his hands up and says he’s sorry. Blaise got his wand pointed at Draco, just like Hermione, both ready to act if Draco loses it completely. Harry moves into Draco's sight with care. He needs him to calm down before anyone gets hurt.
Harry shakes his head. Something is wrong here. He’s seen this before, a long time ago, when he was still little. Uncle Sirius standing in front of Uncle Remus, slamming into him because he didn’t know how else to communicate his frustration. Back when Uncle Sirius was still struggling with the fact he would never hear again.
Just like Harry was a great Quidditch player. New tears make their way down Draco’s cheeks. He doesn’t want to open his eyes. He doesn’t want to remember that it are only memories he’s got left. Why did he want to win that match so badly? What good did it bring him to go after the snitch like that? The day had been perfect until then. The banter in Myrtle’s bathroom. The first kiss they shared. The promises they made, to fight this war together. The flirtations on the field before the storm had fallen on them. The race to get to the snitch first. It had all been great. Until it hadn’t.
“I’m sorry,” the healer says again. Draco tries to remember her name, but his mind is blank. Slowly the healer slides the probe she used for the echo out of him. Draco wants her to put it back, to have another look, to tell him that she was wrong, that she made a mistake.
They both laugh and the tension is gone for a second. But then Hermione takes Harry’s hand in hers. “Promise me you won’t go after him alone,” she says. “I don’t want to go to your funeral.”
-x-x-x-x-
“Yeah, I’m good,” Harry lies. He struggles to sleep and homework is still a nightmare. But it’s been better than it was in the beginning. “Can’t wait for summer break and our trip to the beach,” he says. "I’m sure there will be enough handsome bare-chested men walking around there to get my mind off Draco.”
“You’ve met my mother, right?” Ron asks.
“No, he will,” Harry says. “He’s scared. The last time he faced the rat he lost his hearing.”
Harry James Potter
The wards around Draco’s room fall. Draco jumps upright and quickly wipes some tears out of his eyes. Not that it will do him any good. His eyes must be pussy and red and his cheeks are still wet from the tears. Everyone will know he’s been crying as soon as they see him.
“No, I can’t force him. He just needs some more time. All will be fine. He just needs some time.” Harry tries to convince himself as much as he wants to make it clear to Hermione that all will be fine.
Draco’s father started to complain about headmaster Dumbledore first, saying it was scandalous that he had forced the other governors to sign for his reinstatement before he demanded an explanation about what had happened since Draco refused to tell him anything. He wanted to know who had been responsible for all the attacks this year. Professor Snape said it had been the Dark Lord, acting through somebody else, by means of a diary. Professor showed the destroyed diary to Draco’s father. When he did that Dobby started to point at the diary, then at Draco’s father and then he would hit himself on the head with his fist to punish himself.
“If it gets too bad, write me about it, and I’ll come and rescue you,” Harry signs.
Hermione puts the paper down. “I might not have grown up with it,” she says. “But I do know what that man did to your family.”
Snape made all of us stop with a simple Finite Incantatem and I could see Ron apologise to Neville for whatever his broken wand had done. Hermione and Millicent looked like they were fine. Only Draco looked worried at Nott like he was afraid Nott had read more in him working with me that there was. And this was the moment that Professor Lockhart decided that it was time for a volunteer pair to teach us all a blocking spell. And of course, Professor Snape volunteered Draco and I. Professor Lockhart showed me some complicated sort of wiggling action before he dropped his wand, expecting me to now know what to do. Meanwhile, Draco was almost fighting with Professor Snape, and when the professor told him he should, Draco just ran out of the Great Hall. I think he was crying and I wanted to follow him, but Professor Snape had already found a replacement for Draco and now I was facing Theo Nott.
When the door closes, Draco lets the tears fall. It’s a good thing his wand is still in the kitchen. He would hate to damage any of the pictures on the wall. The constant reminders of the people they lost. Harry’s parents, Teddy’s parents, Sirius and Professor Lupin. Fuck there’s even a picture of Draco’s parents. Draco didn’t want to put it up, but Harry wouldn’t hear any of his protests. ‘He was your father’ Harry would say. ‘He might have done some horrible things, but he did love you, and you love him, that makes him worthy of a place on our walls.’ Now it’s just a reminder of the man that turned Draco into someone he never wants to be again. And his mother is no better. Draco hasn’t spoken to her since the time she called him to tell him she wasn’t coming to the wedding. Only because Draco chose to follow his heart instead of the path his parents had laid out for him. Sometimes he wonders if he made a mistake. If he’d listened to her, he wouldn’t have to fear the pain it will bring when Harry finally leaves.
“Not sure,” Draco signs. He closes his eyes for a second and then he makes a fist and shakes it.
“Will you stop pretending that you are still on Voldemort’s side of this war,” Harry snaps. He steps away from Draco and paces across the room. “You’re not going to kill Dumbledore, you won’t have to.”
“I couldn’t hold on to him, mum. I couldn’t keep him with me,” Draco sobs.
"Okay, I'll see you around three." Harry answers. He can’t think of how upset Molly will be and how it will ruin her table setting. He needs to focus on Draco before he loses him to another addiction. He puts down the phone and focuses on the pancakes he's about to make. Ron is right; things will get better. Draco just needs some time and love. And Harry is more than willing to give him all the love he has.
I went to have tea with Lupin the next day. I wanted to know if he knew that Black had betrayed them, and why he still had a picture of him in his office. But first I asked him if he knew why the Dementors affect me so much. I don’t want to fall off my broom again if they show up again for our next Quidditch match. I told Professor Lupin that I’m scared that I’m weaker than the others. But he assured me that it has nothing to do with weakness. It all has to do with all the bad things that have happened to me. Professor Lupin explained it to me. That Dementors drain peace, hope and happiness out of the air around you. Even Muggles can feel their presence. When they get close every good and happy memory will be sucked out of you, only leaving the worst experiences of your life. Professor Lupin said that the worst that has happened to me is enough to make anyone fall off their broom. And he might have a point, but that doesn’t mean that I want to faint every time they are near. Even though I’m sure that the woman I hear screaming when they get close is mom. I think I hear you’re final moments, how you try to protect and save me.
“Good,” Ron says just before his face turns into a scrawl. Hermione sits down next to Harry, accompanied by Krum. That explains the scrawl on Ron’s face.
Harry puffs out some are. “Yes, okay. I love him,” he says. “But I can’t have him. So what am I supposed to do? I can’t keep doing this. Feeling empty and alone. It’s too hard, Neville.”
“I’m afraid so,” Burke answers.
Harry lifts Draco’s face and gives him a short soft kiss. “It’s okay. I’ll be right here waiting for you. We’re going to be okay,” Harry says.
Harry just stares at Draco who tries hard not to look at any of them. He must feel bad that this is another thing he can’t do. Harry doesn’t want to think about how that class would have gone for Draco. How the others would have made fun of him, stuck on the ground. Why didn’t anyone realise something was wrong when Draco couldn’t even get his broom to fly for him?
Dear mom and dad,
Draco lands with his feet on the fluffy rug that decorates their living room and crumples to the floor. Harry’s arms are around him in seconds. “It’s okay, I’ve got you,” Harry says. Draco nods against Harry’s chest and grabs hold of his sides, pulling him closer towards him.
“Not me,” Draco signs. He looks away as he blinks his eyes.
Draco opens the bottle of champagne and fills their glasses. He hands the bottle off to Pansy, who claims she won’t part with it anymore until she’s off to her other party, the one with all the handsome single men before Draco turns to Harry. “I love that table too much to give it up,” he tells Harry.
So, this month it was me who ended up on the hospital wing. Hermione joked it looks like Draco and I are trying to set a record or something. I thought it was funny, Draco doesn’t really agree. I think he had a big freight when I fell off my broom. He yelled at me to don’t do anything that stupid again. And when he was done, Marcus came to yell at me some more for making us lose our first match of the season. He went on and on about that he was a fool to believe anything Terence would say. He stormed off to go and write to Terence about what a disaster our first match was. Adrian and Miles seemed happy to see that Marcus and Terence are communication this much. They say they used to be friends when they were younger and that it maybe will temper Marcus a little if they would start hanging out again.
“He hates me,” Harry says.
Harry bites his lower lip and blinks away the moisture in his eyes. He’d hoped the kids hadn’t notice, but nothing escapes them. Draco has been an emotional mess all pregnancy. It’s worse than the roller coaster of physical and emotional hardship he’d had when he was pregnant with Lily. But Harry had understood that. He’d felt the same fear and been on the same roller coaster. What happened with James was still fresh in their minds and didn’t leave them until Draco was holding Lily in his arms. But it had been better when they had Nathan. Time had helped them heal and Draco was more stable and enjoyed being pregnant. But this time around, he’s been all over the place. Harry wished he knew why. It looks like it’s more than just the hormones, but Draco swears that there isn’t anything else. And maybe he doesn’t even know why this time around it’s taking so much from him to get through his pregnancy.
Harry leans his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Me too,” he says.
Harry swallows. He doesn’t plan to die. He won’t hurt his family in that way. But he has to stop Pettigrew. The rat will take Neville from him if he doesn’t. And maybe even his Uncle Sirius. Pettigrew sure would like to finish what he started there.
Transfiguration is a really difficult subject. I find it hard to remember all the rules of the transformation formula. It has to do with bodyweight, wand power and other things. The wand power is one I most struggle with. I’m still a little afraid of my wand, since its Voldemort's brother wand. But I’m learning how to control the thing and maybe in some time, it won’t scare me as much anymore. We’ve been working on trying to turn a match into a needle and we have started on the theory about switching spells.
I promise to stay safe from now on.
“I heard they aren’t a couple,” Hermione says. She skips over the fact that she has the hots for Ron. But she thinks that Ron doesn’t feel the same about her, and Ron thinks that he’s not good enough for Hermione and doesn’t want to ruin their friendship. It doesn’t matter how many hints Harry lays out for them, they just won’t confess to each other how they feel.
I slipped back to my friends and soon Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean joined us and we had a lot of fun. Until Rita Skeeter came into the pub. She was fishing for a story, even asked me for an interview about the Hagrid I knew. And then the most amazing thing happened. I had expected Draco to lose his temper, but it was Hermione who stood up and called her a horrible woman and told her to keep her quill inside her bag and leave us all alone.
“Since he drooled all over Digory last year during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff,” Ginny says.
Neville shakes his head. He regrets saying it now. Harry doesn’t need to look at him to know this. Neville never wants to talk about what happened. How a dear friend of his parents, one of James’ best friends betrayed them all. Harry is still grateful that Sirius was the secret keeper of his parents’ hiding place. The world could have been so different if they had switched secret keepers. Then Harry would be the orphan. And Neville would still have his parents. Would they have taken Harry in? Raised him as their own? Probably, but still. It’s different, knowing your real parents are dead and gone because of the betrayal of a friend.
“No signing during exams,” Uncle Remus says from the front of the room.
Not long after that, a house-elf pops up with some dinner for Harry and James takes his leave, saying he should check in on Iris and Neville and then report back to the big boss (aka mum). He hugs Harry one more time and then he’s off, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts.
The hospital wing is quiet now, unlike when Harry and Remus entered it. Madam Pomfrey was busy with Neville. She just pointed at an empty bed and Remus had helped Harry to get on it. His legs are still a little wobbly, but he feels much better now.
The air rushes past Harry as he pulls his wand out of his sleeve. He has no idea what kind of spell he should use. He tries Wingardium Leviosa, in the hope he can make himself float. Of course, it doesn’t work. Tears well up in Harry’s eyes. He doesn’t want to die. Not like this. Not when he’s just figured out that he wants Draco to be his boyfriend. That he wants to take him out on a proper date. And maybe even take him home to his parents.
“Yes, that is perfect,” Hermione says. “Then you have to pay attention in class for once, instead of trying to steal my notes all the time.”
“Just try it, please?” Harry replies. He makes a begging face. A soft smile forms on Draco’s face and Harry’s heart speeds up.
“I’m sorry too,” Narcissa says from somewhere behind Draco. Draco closes his eyes. He can’t have his mother here. He will break down if she stays. And then she will know the betrayal in Draco’s heart. It will put both of them in danger.
Ex-fiancé and former Death Eater Draco Malfoy says Potter had been battling Polyjuice addiction before he disappeared. “Harry was tired of being seen. He just wanted to be someone else for a while,” Malfoy says, voice hoarse. “The Polyjuice started as a therapeutic exercise that we thought would help him, but it spiralled into something insidious.”
You drape one of your naked legs over my own. My damp robes keep my skin from touching yours. But you’ve already cut me open and slipped inside my chest and stitched me up again.
seeing him everyday
“Fuck, Malfoy.” You untangle yourself from me, freeing yourself from what’s left of my life. “I need to go before I change my mind.” You stumble out of bed, naked, and throw on some trousers that were tossed on the carpet.
“Right, yeah. What about her?”
Draco drawls, “Yes, well Harry’s been cooking ever since he was a young boy. I can imagine he’s quite good at it by now.”
These rich pricks think they’re all that—but this bloke really is something. Flask clutched in his hand; I’d bet my last two Sickles that it’s Amortentia. The shit’s rare since the ‘03 ban, but these blokes with the money buy it from the Underground. They drink it like it’s Firewhiskey ‘cause they hate themselves. If they drink enough, maybe they’ll love themselves. I don’t give a fuck. I hate all of them anyway, but I don’t mind when they fuck me a little.
Harry reluctantly unhinged his jaw from Draco’s arm and looked at Switzly once more. “Right,” he said, wiping his mouth.
“That reminds me,” Draco continued, attempting to pull his gaze away from Harry’s throat. “Did I mention that Barbara Sterling from the Ministry’s Productive Use of Dark Magic Department stopped by yesterday? She was hoping to speak to both of us.”
Harry, who was quite used to this kind of behaviour after nearly sixteen years of marriage, merely smirked. “Why do you think I wore them?” He paused. “Oh Draco, this mattress is far too soft.”
Yet my father is dead, and I can feel myself unravel.
“Yes, that Thomas bloke was probably touched as a young child. It’s what happened to your cousin Sirius on your mother’s side. Turned him into a queer mongrel-lover.” Father smiled and continued, “No matter, I know you’ll make me proud, Draco. And the Greengrass Family awaits your decision.”
Draco’s hand curls, tightens around me. I agree that yes, Draco is right; I’ve been ‘

I pull over and flick my wand at the door to open it.
“Yes,

“It certainly seemed like an invitation,” Draco smirked. “And you looked so
Harry straightened up a little more, pink-cheeked and panting and very, very happy.
for the git, alright? And maybe—
Maybe Draco was scared; he didn’t know. Draco didn’t know a lot of things, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to learn them. “Why are you telling me all this?”
Harry’s eyes soften. “
I attempt a grateful smile that I imagine looks more like a grimace. I’m tired.
“I’m interested in your carnivorous plants. I’d like to buy all of them if that’s alright,” Harry said. He watched her with large, hopeful eyes.
Harry made a series of strangled noises that didn’t sound completely human. His hands grasped at Draco’s fitted shirt, then travelled lower and lower and lower down Draco’s back, till he reached his—
“Yes, I remember it well. I watched you nail yourself onto it, and I couldn’t help but join you.”
And alright, I take it back, Potter. With his bone-weak stomach, Tosser doesn’t remind me of you anymore.
. He said they tasted like the ones His grandmother used to make,” Draco smiled sneakily. “I didn’t tell Him how she got the recipe in the first place.”
Harry grinned. “Brilliant. Monday and Rotsley will have so much fun.” His eyes darkened, heavy and full; he started kissing and gnawing his way up Draco’s arm again, wild and unrestrained.
” He licked his lips as he eyed Harry’s neck again.
I think they might have loved me a little.

” Draco smiled. “I keep telling him that he needs to learn to play with his food before he eats it, so this will be a
Switzly closed her eyes again, taking another deep breath in. She appeared to be muttering something unintelligible under her breath. Then she looked at them once more, tiny eyes narrowed. “No, Switzly doesn’t have those, sirs,” she responded, firm.
I lean into you, my mouth moving against your neck. “My mother and father never really loved each other, you know,” I whisper into your throat. I pull back a bit so I can see you. “Not the way you’re supposed to, at least.”
“No. I’m in mourning, Potter.”
on the back of my left. I remember ‘Mione saying that I could remove it easy, but I kept it.
“Hold these two.” Harry’s eyes were clear and bright with dark bags underneath them.

Switzly put her hands on her hips and glared. “Sirs are
He reminds me of myself.

“No. At the rate you’re going, you’d die within the year out there.” My throat feels tight, but I know I’m right. “You should go back to London. Work for the Ministry. I’m not welcome back there.”
“Is that all you were going to tell me?” Harry asked. He bent over slightly as he stared at Draco’s backside thoughtfully, like he was contemplating going for another round, and he wondered how loud he could get Draco to wail using only his hand.
Harry draped his arm over Draco’s shoulders. “Later,” he laughed.
Switzly looked at Harry, doubtful. “Are you sure, sir?” She pointed at the carnivorous plant section. The Cannibalistic Carnations were baring their teeth and lunging at each other, barely locked down by their charmed chain reinforcements.
“Yeah,” you laugh. You pull your shirt off over your head and throw it at my chest.
reverberated all around them—bloody loud as fuck, like Harry’s spine was probably fractured and pounding in pain. Harry moaned as if he had never felt anything better.

Harry, I honestly thought we were past that, but— why the
Draco’s sharp nails dig into my thigh. He chuckles. “Yes, Petunia and Vernon certainly did spectacularly. Harry’s meals are always excellent.”
Harry watched him, voracious. “I’d say at least twenty thousand, Malfoy,” he said, voice hoarse from all the delighted hollering he did earlier in the Quidditch aisle.
“Oh...” Harry’s grin falters. The skin on his knuckles pales as his grip on his
Harry continued mouthing at Draco’s throat; muffled, “mmm… yeah, actually.” He reluctantly pulled himself away. Draco made a small noise of protest.
Draco smiled. “Divine.”
So yeah, Fancy’s caught my eye, and there’s not much else I can do but watch him walk and breathe and live. I think I hate him already, which makes me like him even more.
“Fuck off, Pans.”
I drive back to my flat. It’s a dingy bed and bathroom by a lake. Some kid drowned here last summer when his mum went out for a smoke.
“I think that one Dementor liked you a little too much,” Harry laughed. “My Patronus did the trick with that one,” he said, smug. “Charged the git till it floated the fuck away.”
” Draco murmured, tracing Harry’s elastic waistband with his nails. “You know I would have only let it kiss me a little,” he pouted. “And never on my mouth.” Draco’s lips twitched as Harry looked at him incredulously.
I sit up and try not to cry. “Fuck you, Potter.”
“I know,
Harry happily gasped for air, causing Draco to chuckle as he slowly released him. Harry frowned in disappointment. “Don’t tease,” he complained, looking at Draco’s hand longingly. “Torture me instead.” Harry watched him, hopeful.
, don’t you think?”
Information regarding the closed casket service coming soon.
Harry’s eyes narrowed. “Why would Barbara say that?” he asked. “I mean, I know I forgot to feed Sheila again that morning, so she was a bit hungrier than usual,” he said, sheepish. “But she and Ernie were just playing! And besides, Ernie has been out of St. Mungo’s for a couple of months now, last I heard. They regrew his legs and everything.”
Special magical creatures that help Aurors relax after grueling and stressful cases?
Harry grinned at him. “Absolutely.” Harry leapt forward and grabbed an enormous armful of Fanged Geraniums, Snapping Sage, and—of course— the Cannibalistic Carnations. The flowers latched themselves onto him, ravenous.
