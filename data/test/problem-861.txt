“W-what.” He looked away from Draco and focused on his best friend who looked at him like he figured something out.
Harry inhales sharply, his nose filling with the distinct tang of sweat and Draco, He pulls at his white blonde hair, the strands sliding between his fingers easily. He muffles at Draco’s groan with his mouth and bites down on his bottom lip.
“Marissa? That kid.” He ate a mouthful of chips and after that he continued to speak about the weeping girl “is she using that my boyfriend cheated on me shit again?”
Two weeks has passed and things were getting intense with the school works. It stressed him a lot and occasionally had to take pain relievers because he had migraines. It was also two weeks since he had properly talked to Draco. They only talked during calculus classes which involves with headaches and lots of calculations. They talked but it was strictly about the subject or any school related topics.
“Just wanted to visit my only child.” Lily says and sat down beside him. “So, a little birdie told me about you with a guy?”
“He likes the book you’ve been obsessing for days.” Ginny says and immediately Ron grinned widely then talked to him.
“So Harry I never thought you’re into boys?” Hermione asked and brought out the gay magazine Ron had bought him last year.
“Good good.” Ron glances at Harry who was playing with a lose thread on his sweater. “I’m sure it will be fine Harry.”
“Good.” He says and put his right arm around Draco’s waist. Harry then leaned in closer to him.  “Cause I really like you too.”
“Ravi de vous rencontrer également.” He replied and Harry thought it sounded french. He didn’t speak nor understand french so he just shrugged it off.
Cedric had kissed him one night after they secretly dated for a month. They were at the Driggory’s house specifically nearby the pool. Harry was half naked and his boyfriend was on top of him, kissing his jawline.
“I needed a change.” He honestly said, the truth was he had to even though he didn’t really want to leave his old school. He loved it there the environment was nostalgic and his friends were amazing. Including, Ron who went to the same school with him.
“Of course you didn’t know.”  Harry laughs at his best friend. “I was planning to take him to the Zoo, Jen’s IceCream Shop and then at the Amusement Park.”
“My name is Harry.” He continues then shook Draco’s hand which was already ready. After for awhile he withdraws his hand even though he liked the feeling of Draco’s soft skin to his.
“I’m enjoying this too much.” He could feel his smirk on his skin then he looked up at him “but okay, my prince.”
Draco’s eyes darkened and he held his breath. He bit his lower lip it may have seemed he was nervous and was about to cry.
He ate a pizza and decided to drink some of Rum Coke and whiskey. His friends were a bit tipsy except for Neville who seemed to disappear. Ron was laughing at a joke Luna had cracked which wasn’t that funny at all.
"B-But that means..." stuttered Harry, looking at Draco, who by now had tears running down his cheeks.
"I know how bad that sounds now, but now it doesn't just affect him and that troubles me even more," Severus stared at him, understanding what Dumbledore meant. He felt dizzy for a moment and lowered himself back into his chair.
"So I'll do the firethorn and you take care of the flubberworms. Can you manage that?" sneered Draco now. Harry rolled his eyes but nodded. Draco stared at him in irritation. Since the beginning of the year there had been no biting comment, no point from Potter and that bothered Draco more than he wanted to admit.
"Yes, Sev is right, let's celebrate something," Remus said and now walked over to Harry and Draco, followed by the others.
"Yes, I'm gay, just like you too, or are you interested in girls too? I mean Cho...", Harry quickly shook his head.
"She tortured me, over and over again and I couldn't fight back - again. I couldn't tell anyone because that would have meant she would have won. Sirius, Sirius was everything, my hope and I killed him," Harry's sobs grew louder. Draco came even closer, but Harry backed away until he felt the wall of the parapet at his back again.
"It's all right Madame Pomfrey," Draco said, moving a little away from Harry so that the medi-witch could exaMione him.
"I know Severus, but they wish and .... by Salazar, my son is getting married and it may be the last time I see him," a single tear ran down Malfoy's cheek.
"Get started, the recipe is on the blackboard!" he said sternly now, sitting down behind his desk and correcting papers. Harry looked at the blackboard, in itself he should be able to manage the potion. Hermione had said that it was quite complicated. Not in terms of ingredients, but the different ways it had to be warmed, cooled and stirred. He started and made good progress. The potion looked like it needed to look. The last instruction for the flubber worms, on the blackboard he had difficulty deciphering. Since his last run-in, if it could be called that, with his uncle, he had felt that his vision was worse than before. He didn't want to ask Snape, though, so he grabbed the flubberworms and just threw them whole into the cauldron. He stirred, but the consistency wasn't really right anymore. It began to smoke and Snape looked up.
Harry and Draco decided to ride the spinning tea cup first which was a bad idea because it made both of them dizzy. Harry recovered after a few seconds while his future boyfriend took minutes.
After a couple minutes he received a message from Hermione telling him where they were which reminded him he needed to start doing his homework. He placed Little Draco to the table and started to do his work.
“They are, I almost laugh everyday because of them” Harry commented and leaned in closer to Draco’s side.
“By the way, my name is Draco.” His voice was a bit raspy, it sounded sexy “and I’m really sorry about doing that.”
“Harry, please.” He had begged again when Harry decided to cross the street. He was tired of hearing his boyfriend begging him to come out.
“He‘s a douchebag used to play and break everyone’s hearts.” She said while Luna just shook her head, disagreeing.
“Thank you.” Draco smiled at him, he dropped his backpack on the floor and wore the hoodie. After a few minutes, the Uber and arrived and they said their goodbyes.
Harry shifted leaning sideways on the locker. He honestly felt nervous about talking to Malfoy but then he also missed him.
They silently walked together, Harry was behind Draco. Suddenly, Draco stopped walking and he stumbled into him.
“My manager bought off some pictures from a source and He does look familiar.” She explains “I assume you are together.. you were holding hands.”
Cedric stood up and stuck a tongue out then jumped to the pool which made Harry giggle. His boyfriend was being cute and he couldn’t help but admire him.
“Luna.” They shook hands, Ron was next and he awkwardly took draco’s hand and lastly Hermione who dealt with it like a professional person that she is.
“That guy over there.” Luna says “Mione, I think it’s not a good idea to say false rumors about a guy we never met.”
“She does that because..” he leans in closely and whispered “some of our mates here actually want to fuck people who are pregnant.”
Harry was kidnapped by Ron, his ginger haired  best friend was now looking at him with a blank face. He felt nervous for some reasons so he decided to open his mouth but was stopped by Ron who had shushed him. A few minutes had passed and he felt uncomfortable with Ron talking to himself. He suddenly thought that maybe he figured out that he had a relationship with cedric before.
"Mr Potter?", Harry startled. The rest of the night he had been able to sleep without nightmares, now he looked into the gentle eyes of Madame Pomfrey.
"It just never gets boring and it's the most beautiful one I know," Harry said with a smile and kissed the other gently. Together they stepped onto the terrace of the house and looked at the children, who were now sitting in the sand and building a castle. The sea was roaring and the waves were crashing against the rocks. The call of the seagulls, mingled with the laughter of Sirius and Lily. The sun bathed everything in a warm, surreal light.
"Oh, oh he won't soften you up after all," Remus said with a grin. Snape gave him a barely intelligible look.
For the next few hours they did their homework. Despite everything that had happened, Harry was happier than he had been in a long time. With Draco by his side, he suddenly felt stronger and more confident. They talked a lot, laughed and got to know each other in a completely different way. Only shortly before Severus was to arrive did Harry become serious again.
"I don't know. I didn't wake up again until late in the evening. The hand was bandaged, the blood and the blade gone. There was a bottle of water next to my bed and that was it," Harry said, stroking the white scar on his wrist.
They worked side by side in silence for a while and yet seemed to complement each other quite well. The recipe was complicated and even Hermione didn't seem sure if what she was doing was the right thing, Harry noted with a sideways glance. Blaise and Ron were arguing and their potion smelled like rotten eggs from a distance, which it absolutely shouldn't.
"Are you all right?" asked Draco, visibly concerned. Harry nodded, but was pale and completely drenched in sweat.
"So please begin. You have one hour," Slughorn said. Harry sidled up to the other's table and looked at him challengingly.
"You could be apart no matter how far or how long, but you would never be truly happy without each other," he said. Draco nodded and looked at Harry, who didn't dare look up.
"Mhm...", listlessly Harry reached for a piece of toast. Blaise had no way of knowing that he could go very long without eating something. He felt Draco's scrutinising gaze on him now too and picked up his fork to eat some scrambled eggs. He didn't need any more questions.
"Severus, it's good you're here. I think some Death Eaters have been seen in Hogsmeade," she said. Severus looked first at her and then at Dumbledore, who was standing behind his desk, rubbing the bridge of his nose.
"Protecting him with our lives. Harry was all we had left of James and Lily, of people who were our family to us. We were family because neither I, Sirius, Lily or James had parents anymore. When Harry was born, we swore to protect him and ... and I just don't know how to deal with the fact that I have to break my promise ...", Remus said and broke off. Now he couldn't stop tears from running down his cheeks again. Severus immediately pulled him into his arms.
"What do you think? Of course he told me and also Sirius and reproached us for treating you like that. He was angry and disappointed. He's not James, Severus!" said Remus resignedly. Severus wanted to say something back, but then the door opened and the rest of the students entered.
"Of course. You go ahead, both of you. You can freshen up right there and then you can have breakfast," Madame Pomfrey said and disappeared. Harry nodded and swung his legs off the bed. Draco did the same and reached for some fresh clothes.
"I'll be all right," he said exhaustedly. Madame Pomfrey raised her wand in irritation and then looked around in amazement.
"That's ... um, terrible ... isn't it?" Ron wanted to know. He and Hermione were sitting on two chairs next to Harry and Draco's bed. Now it was Draco, who was reading a book and couldn't hear anything, but had his hand tightly closed around Harry's.
"Yes so far, it's just a precaution, so go on and Mr. Zabini, I'll ask for your silence," Snape said and the Slytherin nodded.
"Granger, Weasley and Zabini, no duels in the corridors, that meant detention. In an hour outside the potions classroom and you'd better be on time," Snape said, glaring angrily at the three.
"W-When he fell through the veil, he took a part of me with him, a part I thought I had lost forever until recently," the potions master nodded and a shy smile flitted across the otherwise expressionless face.
"What are you afraid of?", Remus wanted to know. Harry looked at him for a few moments, then turned away and went to the window. He knew exactly what he was afraid of. This fear had haunted him ever since he had become aware of how he felt about Draco.
"Yes," he heard Draco's voice softly, then he opened the door and entered the flat. He waited a moment, then closed it again and at the same moment the boys pulled their cloaks off their heads.
"Enough with the niceties. Come, we'll show you our room," Blaise said and pushed the two out of the common room. Harry had to admit that the room was really cosy, something you couldn't necessarily expect in a dungeon. However, it wasn't very big, a third bed certainly wouldn't fit next to Draco and Blaise's two four-poster beds. Harry's trunk was next to the door leading to the bathroom. The fact that the Slytherins had their own bathrooms made Harry jealous, because he preferred to be alone in the bathroom and in Gryffindor that was only possible late in the evening or very early in the morning.
"You liked him a lot, didn't you?" asked Draco abruptly, and the other looked at him in complete surprise.
It was bright, far too bright. Harry opened his eyes and looked into a blinding white light, but it disappeared immediately. He sat up. Where was he? Only slowly did he realise that the sea stretched out before his eyes. He had never been to the ocean before, but that was how it had to be. Everything was a little unreal, a little too beautiful, too bright, like when you looked at postcards of places you'd already been and wondered who had taken the photos, because live it was completely different. Harry looked down at himself, wearing white linen trousers and a white shirt. His bare feet sank into the soft sand. Was this heaven? And if so, where was Draco? Had he perhaps survived or was he simply still alive? He stood up, turned and saw someone coming towards him in the distance. It wasn't Draco, the man was too tall for that. His dark wavy hair fell loosely over a white shirt.
"Dray, without me, you could just go on living and in the end it's not your decision," Harry said and turned around. Draco reacted immediately and climbed onto the parapet as well, resolutely grasping Harry's hand.
"Um yeah sure, I don't want to miss the wedding and .... well, I should stay near the school," he said quickly. Before anyone else could say anything, the portrait of Salazar Slytherin hanging above the fireplace cleared its throat.
"Good, then go. I will also cast protective spells. We will not let this place of peace be taken from us," the Headmaster said. Severus looked at Minerva, who nodded and followed the teacher outside.
"Don't leave them alone, please," she said and the man nodded weakly before the Malfoys disappeared. Sighing, Severus lowered himself onto one of the two chairs. He had to collect himself, even if it seemed hopeless.
"I'm definitely trying and I don't think it hurts, or did you feel .... well, that Cedric was in pain?", Harry swallowed hard and then shook his head.
"Y-yes," Draco said haltingly and the potions master nodded. He reached for the cloak and threw it over the boys.
"Yes, better now than tomorrow," Severus said energetically and pointed to the door. The boys looked at each other worriedly, but followed the teacher.
"What's next?" Neville wanted to know in a whisper, but Harry raised his shoulders helplessly. They sat quietly in the grass for a little over ten minutes when there was a rustling sound and suddenly two unicorns stepped out onto the lawn. It was a mare with her foal. A murmur went through the class.
"I'm so sorry," he said and now he was crying too. Remus was with him immediately and pulled him into his arms.
When the teachers came back to the Great Hall, all the tables had disappeared. The students stood around in small groups or sat on the stone floor. Molly Weasley came rushing towards Severus Snape, followed by Hermione, Ron, Bill, Ginny and the twins.
"Nothing will happen to you. The prefects take their fellow students to the dungeons. Follow, Mr. Filch! He will show you the way to the secret passages. The teachers are protecting the hall. No one leaves the building!" the man said, giving Draco and Harry a look that they both immediately understood. While the prefects began to collect their charges, many of the adults stayed behind to help the teachers.
"There is a small bay behind the rocks where the water is very calm. I think I'm quite a good teacher," Draco said and laughed.
"I don't know. There were more important things and ... I don't know. You know, we were going to take you in after the war and start a family. When he died, it was just too hard for me to say something, because you had lost him too," Harry nodded.
"Yes, he would also die, and according to your stories, it is completely irrelevant whether they are bound or not."
"In my rooms and there they will remain. I have exempted them from classes because their schooling does not seem to matter now," Severus said and rose.
"Sure and ... I'd like to tell Blaise. It wouldn't be fair to just confront him with my death at some point."
"Yes, Harry, I suppose that's one way to put it. We must remain vigilant and prevent such fanaticism from ever arising again, for I have had to learn before ... where such things lead, but for now, peace is restored. I see you have already received some presents," Albus said, looking at the dessert, which was overflowing with cards, flowers and sweets.
"It won't hurt," Madame Pomfrey said and let her wand wander over Harry. It took much longer than usual and the Gryffindor did not suspect anything good. The medicine witch seemed worried.
"How? What?" Harry wanted to know and looked at Severus. He came closer, tapped his wand on his hand and when he opened it, there were two rings inside, shining silver.
Severus and Remus walked silently towards the large lake. It was still quite early and cool and hardly any students were to be seen.
"I don't know, I've just been practising," Harry said, trying to look as innocent as possible, but he suspected Draco didn't believe him.
"What? Yeah, okay sorry ... um ... so you did?" asked Ron now very quietly. Again Harry nodded and sipped his orange juice.
“Oh cool! Harry’s got his pet snake Suni, she’s been his for years now. But I just got a new kitten and I’m still trying to get her used to me. I named her Marissa. Do you have any pets?” Draco grinned, not responding for a moment as they all stumbled into one boat before he spoke again.
were carved in fine cursive across the latch. It took a considerable amount of self-restraint to not burn the thing where it was. Instead, he decided to make the disgusting thing useful and haul it in front of the door. It was light. Empty. Hadrian held back a snarl. At least they hadn’t gotten their grubby hands on his actual trunk, though this certainly was the exact model his parents had bought him.
And if he wasn’t damn right, puzzle it was. Ministry B.S. not letting him drop the last name because of some stupid heirship and voting seats.
“Final questions children. Do you wish to stay with Sara and Erin?” Hadrian nodded so quick that Lucius thought his head might fall off. Laney looked affronted and deeply offended, protesting the idea vehemently. “Do you wish for visitation with the Potters and Alexander Potter?”
“Where’s your husband Severus?” The dark-haired man snorted and glanced at the clock. “Ah, well, I’ll wait a bit before starting breakfast then. How did you two sleep?”
“Play nice Leandra.” The girl looked at him with utter betrayal, as if he’d just insulted her entire family. It was a rather funny expression to see on a child before she pouted and slouched into her brother, looking up at his through her hair.
Tom was looking at him with wild and confused red eyes. Zeroing in on the paper in his hands and Severus’ arms wrapped around his body, and he came closer. Barely breathing the man stared at him as if he were looking at him for the first time. Like he was something special. Tracing the shape of his eyes and the fall of his disheveled ponytail, murmuring softly.
Crammed under a bed, with hot tears beginning to stream down his cheeks. He never wanted his mother more than that moment now.
“Don’t worry about it Lane. They’ll drop off all our luggage, pets included at our dorms once we’re sorted. Unless you have an owl, then they go to the Hogwart’s owlery.” Laney nodded happily, ignoring Draco’s small squawk as she grabbed his hand to hold as they walked. Harry sniggering near silently at the confused expression on Draco’s face.
Sighing, Hadrian grabbed his wool coat and slung it on as he trotted obediently down the stairs to the floo. Hauling Annabee up onto his hip and good naturedly allowed Draco to wrap his scarf around his neck like a mother hen (or an overprotective house wife). Mama was at the tail end as Mother and Lucius led the way.
“I don’t know where young Mr. Potter is. Alexander is finishing up the semester at home, you know how family problems go. I’d assume Lily and James took some time off to console and teach their son.” Severus rounded on his employer.
“I’m aware. I’m here to take both of you in. You’re wanted for kidnapping, disregarding a restraining order, and quite a few other things. Does Lily know truly what you’ve done? Or have you just pacified her with Dumbledore’s greater good argument?” James snarled at him and Sirius just looked his fill. Before James started flinging spells at him.
“Haden’s mine! Go ‘way!” The little girl burrowed her head into Hadrian’s collar and Alex was gifted with a poisonous glare from his biological twin. But just before a fight could break out and Dumbledore could intervene their mother straightened.
“Hadrian.” The blond aristocrat kept his voice soft and nonthreatening as possible. The boy gave a slight nod, his sister was looking worriedly between the two of them. Hadrian blinked. “I promise, I’m not going to let anything happen to you. This will just be some questions to deviate your home life and how you’re doing, okay?”
“Nothing you wanna know about Papa. I assure you.” Severus looked appalled but the Lord was ducking behind his husband where Draco could hear him snorting with quiet laughter, shoulder’s shaking as he tried to cover it with a cough. Severus glared at him.
Something a bit lighter and funnier before we start getting into the climax of the fic! (I got plans like you wouldn't believe my friends >:)
. The sharp pieces of his broken wand parting his flesh easily as it had his hair, as if it were a hot knife through butter. Blood was flowing easily, but not overflowing as to drip and ruin the circle. He looked out his window. Night was still young. He got to work. Jabbing the homemade brush into his arm and careful drawing the symbols.
“Because they’ve never had to worry about them. I don’t see Potter or Alexander, so they probably aren’t here yet.”
It almost looked like Alex’s room, or what little he saw of it that one time he snuck out of the attic.
“Not a bad idea. Crabbe and Goyle are already down in the hall.” Hadrian sighed and just decided to skip the robe as Suni cheekily rested her head on his shoulder. At least she let him put on a tank top and pants. “Are you going to walk around like that.”
.” Sara smirked. “Besides, I wonder who would also win this fight if it’s all about money. I own my own business and Erin here is extremely affluential in an international military task-force. You are the equivalent of a stay at home wife and a police officer. Noble, but not very lucrative, all your money was made by your ancestors. We’re self-sufficient and though we have a lower net-worth than you, we didn’t see fit to
“It seems the Headmaster would like a word with Hadrian today after breakfast. However, he said nothing about informing you as his sibling. We will endeavor there after you two and I eat.” Laney frowned.
She’d left them alone to use the bathroom. She thought it’d be safe, they had just won the court case and it was usually a busy space at the ministry. Laney didn’t think anything would happen in five minutes. Yet, when she’d returned Annabee was screeching on the ground, clutching the Slytherin scarf Draco had wrapped around Hadrian’s neck and bleeding from a cut on her forehead. Her twin nowhere in sight.
“I’m from Britain and I’m probably English by blood. But my home culture is from a small desert island named Dicai. Blistering sun and spice is our life, though I grew up here and only have been to the homeland a few times, my mentor made sure I was taught all our traditions and immersed in the culture from the second she took me in.” Hadrian paused. “You don’t have to hide your wands or magic by the way. I know and I am.”
“Have Uncle Sev try Legilimency on you sometime. The fact you blackout entire school years isn’t normal. Anyway, there’s a war going on. Between Dark and Light, and everyone thinks the Light side is all sunshine, roses, and goodness. But, the dark side is being painted in a demonized light. Tom, our lord, was dragged into this war by the leader of the light side who manipulated him and then tried to kill him after killing a few very well-known wizards under Tom’s name. Now our lord was forced back into the light, people know he still lives and the war has been started all over again and we’re going to die unless we can clear the names of dark witches and wizards before they kill us all.” Hadrian frowned in thought, eyebrows scrunched up.
The brunet was dragged by his ear by an irate and infuriated potions professor as Draco hurried over to his sister. Holding her wand which no one bothered to check, the sparkle in her eyes was full force. Yes, a beautiful job well done. Laney put her thumbs up for him to see from the library and whooped with glee when Greg piggy backed her to the infirmary. A month and a half until the court day left.
The ginger snorted, “Watch this, Suni. Kiss your daddy!” Immediately like a reptile on a mission Suni launched at Hadrian and coiled around his shoulders before pressing her snoot against his cheek. Hadrian just looked ahead with a fondly exasperated look, not running away from the snake kisses at all.
“I’ve heard you’re a Metamorphagus, is that your effortless or just your preferred appearance?” The words tumbled out of his mouth before he thought of just how rude he was being. He was relieved as instead of being offended by the blunt question the younger man smiled softly, eyes glancing at Draco.
“In the magical world custody often is gifted to the godparents, do any of the children have them?” Severus cut in.
“I’m Hadrian Dragma-Potter. Minstery wouldn’t let me drop my birth name until I can legally drop my heir title.” Draco’s jaw dropped.
Four days of hard work. Bags were becoming purses of black under his eyes as he worked tirelessly into the night, before throwing a rug on top of the circle as soon as the sun broke the horizon. Then he’d suffer through James dragging him to breakfast where he’d sit silently and they’d all ignore the bruises and the fact Hadrian could barely walk without leaving a blood trail behind him from his leg. Lily shot her husband concerned looks, and Alex was wary, but reassured by his father easily enough. Enough that he had the audacity to tell Hadrian that the sooner he behaved and got ungrounded the sooner they could fly together and get homeschooled together.
The excess potions and compulsion charms layered on each other and Tom wasn’t even surprised that no one would recognize Hadrian from Harry. With that much mind manipulation and compulsion, it was a wonder that he wasn’t a moody and violate mess full time. How Hadrian had kept himself intact for the summers away from the insane headmaster was impressive.
Hadrian dropped the shell shocked boy and shot to his feet just as James stopped at the corner. Seeing Alexander bleeding on the ground and Hadrian bleeding while standing over him, however Hadrian was still in an adrenaline rush and not just waking up. So he grabbed a vase from the table and hurled it right at James’ face before taking off.
“Oh, you know.” It was dead. Tom had never heard the boy anything but buoyant and cheery. Always first with a welcoming embrace and a wide grin stretched across his tan cheeks and the bright green eyes. Caused by Tom’s curse, (how could he have disfigured his child.  sparkling with warmth and light. Severus’ thumb grazed their child’s neck again.
“Cool, what do you- holy Merlin.” Draco interrupted himself, prompting Hadrian and his sister to look behind themselves. Both froze and looked awestruck.
“Oh Harry, look at you. You’ve gotten so big, and look at your hair. I was so worried about you when you…” Hadrian didn’t blink. The green eyes that matched her own showed little concern or interest. Just watched silently, judging. He was so still that if his hands didn’t shift within the other little girl’s she’d think her son’s twin dead. It was unnerving to see an almost copy of James act so cold to her.
“I don’t pay the mortgage, it’s already in my name. Just yearly taxes. I’ve been pulling overtime lately anyway so I have more than enough to take some time to get to spend some time with Draco’s family.”
“The war is more important right now. Thank you for your shelter, Hadrian. As well as the meal, it’s delicious.” Hadrian smiled gently, his frame flickering as it went back to honey tan skin and dark brown hair. Working around the snake on his shoulders, Hadrian green eyes didn’t even glance at his hands as he quickly pulled out his ponytail and put it into a messy bun.
“Can I pet Suni?” Hadrian gave him a gentle smile and sat still as Draco hopped on the bed with him and reached out. Hand hovering in front of the large snake patiently letting her scent him before going to gently run his hand down her long body. “She’s gorgeous.”
Hadrian looked to him, almost as misty-eyed as his uncle as his voice cracked. “I had living parents, and they sent me to live with
“You can’t be so light when you tell people your parents are dead. They’re going to think your nuts.”
“Ah, you’re right. My platonic knight in shining armor. The brotherly prince to my damsel in distress.”
“First, let’s dissuade you of this notion that you will ever leave here. As Head of the Potter house you will
the man smiled into the kiss before pulling away. Draco grabbed his hand. Kissing each knuckle before slipping the ring onto Hadrian’s ring finger, letting the small thrill, the ember, that lit up in his chest burn as he got to admire the ring on his hand. He grinned up at his groom, grabbing the front of the man’s shirt and shoving him back inside and onto the bed. Wandlessly and wordlessly throwing up a silencing charm and straddling his future husband with a wicked grin.
“Hadrian?” The brunet blinked, looking to his side and stepping back when he saw Draco on one knee. A box in his hands being wrung with the blonde’s jittery hands. Hadrian covered his mouth with his hands. “I’ve known you for so many years and loved you through all of them. The little arguments, the sass, the snark, the sweet, the nights in the doghouse. When I woke up on my sixteenth birthday at Hogwarts, your name on my lips and your love on my mind, I wasn’t even surprised. I knew you’d be the one I would spend my entirety with. For life and beyond death. I want to love you for all of it. For the rest of our lives. Hadrian Dragmire, now Hadrian Thomas Prince, will you marry me?”
With that, the two women helped themselves to the floo and vanished with a flash of green. Severus hid his own smile and left the Potters shell-shocked in their chairs while he went back down into the dungeons. He had a few letters to pen after all, and godchildren to check on.
“You are? You are! Oh, my baby!” She cooed, misty eyes as she slapped her husband’s chest excitedly. “Lucius, Lucius! They’re mates! I knew my Veela heritage would bless my son like it did my grandmother.”
“How about friends, do you have any friends in school, or from your old muggle school?” Laney frowned and hummed.
The table startled again, Draco included this time. His love had looked like his lord already and now he was basically the man’s (slightly more handsome) clone. His lord, though shocked, looked very amused. Raising a hand and pointing to his partner.
Lily blinked but nodded, “Yes, we got him a snowy owl for his birthday this year. He named her Hedwig. Are snakes allowed?”
“God, I gotta work on pronouncing half of this. First one’s drought of living death? Draught? Second one is the stomach of a goat, that was the bezoar question. Third is nothing, both are aconite.” Snape pinched the bridge of his nose and summoned the sheet of parchment from her hands. Glancing it over and nodding firmly.
“He’s claiming there’s no way we can support three children without an inheritance, but we’re fine! I can prove it! We live in a safe neighborhood on base, the kids had activities, they went to school. They never wanted for food or clothing or love… I don’t want them to take my baby.”
Now she was still the same, but it was obvious to him that he’d scared her. More often than not when they walked Mother would have a hand on the back of his head, covering his old injury. Double checking the straps when he had to wear a leg brace and carrying him when he couldn’t walk anymore.
“We have a good chance to remember yes. But Hadrian was exposed to compulsions and memory charms so early and so young that his memories of being Harry at Hogwarts are gone forever, and he was a baby so any memories with us are either faded to nothing or gone. When we get home, I want to make a blood purging potion. I want any remnant of that old bastard’s magic and blood adoption out of our baby.” Tom nodded placatingly, magic still lashing dangerously around them. Slowly, he stretched them out onto the bed, still holding tightly to his husband.
No, disrespecting his family had consequences. Hadrian didn’t plan on stopping until Alex was firmly trashed in the eyes of his peers. However, for all his careful planning what he hadn’t expect his brother to do all the work for him.
James frowned again, “Alex said he went up to greet Harry before the sorting ceremony and he got ignored all the way to when Harry was sorted into Slytherin rather than our family house. He was distraught that after five years the first thing his twin did was snub him.”
"Oh come on, there must be something to be said for having the body of a sixteen year old again," Remus said.
"It's so pointless," he said, turning on his side, even though he could barely see Severus in the pale light.
"Thank you," Blaise said and walked towards the door. He had a strange feeling, not knowing what to expect made him nervous, but immediately it subsided as he stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. Harry and Draco were sitting on the bed, reading. Their fingers intertwined tightly.
"Fine," Draco said, pointing his wand at Blaise and only moments later his wand flew through the air. Irritated, the Slytherin looked around.
"Please," said the teacher. The werewolf looked at the other inquiringly for a while, then he began to tell.
After class, they walked together to Potions. It was the first time they sat here after her accident and Harry wasn't the only one who had a queasy feeling. Slughorn watched them warily the whole time. The task today was not really difficult and with the book of the Half-Blood Prince's, Harry managed to finish his potion very quickly.
"Yes, but they are only sixteen ... it would be a decision that would affect their whole lives. They could never be truly happy without the other," Dumbledore nodded, stood up and paced restlessly. Severus suspected that something else was bothering the Headmaster.
It took a while before they reached Severus' quarters. Once there, the two boys sank down on the couch.
Severus Snape had quickly reached the headmaster's office and hoped that the man was there. He didn't know why he had such a bad feeling, but he knew he should talk to Dumbledore if he wanted to find out what was behind all this.
"O-okay, and what is the catch?", Draco wanted to know, who could see exactly that his uncle wasn't saying everything. The latter sighed and sat down again.
"Mum and Dad, that's why they were here, isn't it?", Draco then wanted to know, pulling Harry close to him.
A Hufflepuff girl screamed and covered her ears, more and more joined in and Harry too went to his knees. Voldemort was no longer just in his head, he was in everyone's heads and he spoke, "Give me Harry Potter and I will spare your lives, no harm will come to you, but refuse and I will reduce the school to rubble and none of your pathetic protection spells will be of any use to you. Dumbledore is an old fool and cannot protect you. Give me Potter, you have one hour! I'll be waiting in the Forbidden Forest, Potter. Come and none of your friends will be hurt!" As quickly as the voice had come, it had disappeared again. Now panic broke out, students shouted in confusion, ran around until Dumbledore silenced them all with a simple: "QUIET! "
"Good morning," Remus Lupin startled, rubbing his eyes. Severus was standing by the couch and holding a cup of coffee in front of him.
"I can't say, but we need to find out more about the soul bond if we are to .... if we are to separate them, but until then, the two are dependent on each other if we don't want Potter to die," Snape concluded, looking thoughtfully into the flames of the fireplace.
"Hello puppy, how are you?" he wanted to know and now also looked at Draco, who had hesitantly come closer.
"Crabbe's an idiot!" said Draco, smiling wanly. Severus didn't know how to react, so he just nodded.
"And us!" the twins shouted and now joined Ron and Hermione. One by one, more and more students stood protectively in front of Harry and Draco. The Slytherins were backing away more and more.
"Mhm ... yeah can be, but I don't either. This is a crappy situation for both of us, so why complicate it," Harry said, stopping as they stood just outside the hut. Draco looked at him for a while, then nodded and looked around. There were only a few students attending the N.E.W.T. class. A handful of Gryffindors, two Hufflepuffs and three Ravenclaws. No Slytherins, except himself, were present.
"Alright, I'll send Mr. Zabini right over, after all it's Saturday and Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger around afternoon if that's okay," asking looked at the boys who nodded in agreement.
"Try to get some sleep and we'll see tomorrow," Severus added and the two young men nodded before closing the door behind them.
"Potter!" he shouted and it worked. The Gryffindor sat up, breathing heavily, and looked around in confusion.
"That's nice Ron, but Dumbledore has offered me and Draco to stay here at Hogwarts next summer too and there's plenty of time before then."
"I'm sorry, I'm crying here, and you're feeling the same way," he said, but his partner shook his head.
"Yes, exactly. It's really important, otherwise you'll both end up in pain. If you're the one on the bottom, then ... then you just have to trust and try to relax. It helps if you touch yourself or even if your partner does it."
"Leave it Dray, yes it did ... so it worked," Harry said, letting go of his friend's hand and spotting Remus.
"No ... no not at all. But I think he already wanted to, but I was just too young for him and I was," Draco nodded.
"I-I ... I have to die," he asked at some point, trembling. Remus, who in the meantime had also knelt down in front of the couch, nodded weakly.
"Are you coming?" he asked, looking at Harry invitingly. He stood a little unsteadily on his feet. Draco saw it, walked around the bed and grabbed him by the upper arm. Immediately Harry felt a little better.
"The question is rather whether you really want to do that? In terms of you-know-who, it would certainly be good, but otherwise you seem to be ... very happy," Severus said diplomatically.
"Stop!" the Potions Master now said louder than he had intended. Draco and Harry looked at him, startled.
"Mhm...could be. I don't know what's wrong with him. I thought he was happy for us to go on holiday together with Lucius, Narcissa and Draco, but now he'd suddenly rather go with me alone."
"Here's to the here and now, I suppose that's all we can drink to," Severus said and they toasted. They were silent for a while, but Severus could feel Remus watching him closely.
"Well it's just too cramped in Mr Zabini and Draco's room and as for the food, we'll come up with something plausible."
"Good night Madame Pomfrey and thank you very much," Harry said and the woman had already disappeared. Draco slid closer to Harry again and clasped his hand.
"You were unconscious for four days. I thought I had lost you," Draco said in a trembling voice. Harry reached out and stroked his husband's cheek.
"Yes," Harry said, letting go of Draco's hand and turning onto his side. The Slytherin suppressed a disappointed sigh as the warmth of the hand left him and closed his eyes.
Harry blinked and felt Draco's arm around his waist. He smiled until he remembered why they were lying here together. Immediately his stomach tightened and his heart beat painfully against his chest. Suddenly he felt Draco's lips on his neck.
"We'll think of something to keep it a secret for now, and there's one more thing you could help me with..." said Harry.
"Honestly yes, have you heard from Harry or Draco?", Hermione wanted to know. Blaise shook his head in resignation.
"We thank you and ... and we are getting married tonight, Dumbledore is marrying us and you shall be there," Draco said.
"What's going on?", Minerva wanted to know. As briefly as he could, Severus summarised the events of the last few days. The Gryffindor tutor had to sit down and was visibly fighting tears.
"Not me! Maybe I'll get you something else. See you," he said with a wink, then disappeared from the room.
"In the Room of Requirement. At least an appropriate atmosphere could be created here," said the Potions Master and Dumbledore nodded.
"At the risk of sounding cruel again, I'd rather I-I killed them, but Albus thinks the Lord himself must do it, so kill Harry," Severus said, his stomach tightening painfully at those words.
"How was it?" she wanted to know anxiously. Lucius sank into the armchair and poured himself a firewhiskey.
"There you are again," Remus Lupin stood up from the kitchen table and looked inquiringly at the boys.
"We just thought that if they took after us, they'd be putting their lives in danger plenty more times," Draco said, laughing.
"Good night then. I'll take care of them," Madame Pomfrey said and Severus left the hospital wing. Outside the door, he ran a quick hand through his hair. What should he do now? Ultimately, there was only one way to keep them both safe from harm, but did they want that? Potter had no one left, his parents were dead, so was his godfather and his relatives had abused him for years. But Draco had a family and they should know what had happened. Severus took a deep breath and hurried out of the castle.
"You're scared," Harry nodded and lowered his gaze. Draco put a hand under his chin, forcing him to look up.
"I'm sorry, but a couple of overzealous Hufflepuff, have hurt themselves in Herbology. So, how can I help?" she asked, smiling mildly at the boys holding hands.
"Mhm ... so now the hellebore and then ..." said Draco, bringing Harry back to the here and now. He glanced at the recipe and then at Draco. Hellebore? It didn't say that at all ... That was as far as he could get with his thoughts. There was an explosion and he and Draco were thrown against the wall. Harry only saw Slughorn hurrying towards them in a blur, then everything went black.
"It doesn't or I wouldn't have offered and now Lupin, excuse me. I need to sleep, tomorrow will probably be the hardest day of my life. Narcissa and Lucius are coming around late afternoon," Severus said and stood up.
"I know the memories. Your father also beat you and humiliated you, why didn't you ever tell anyone? I just didn't want to appear weak and I was just afraid of where I would end up," Harry said almost defiantly. Snape sighed deeply. The brat would mean his grave once more.
"Did he just say 'he'?", Draco wanted to know in confusion, looking after the Headmaster as Harry smiled.
"I messed up again and the potion exploded and thank you, I slept very well," Severus said tonelessly and stood up.
"Yes, I can see that. So there really is ... Love involved?", it was a question from the teacher, but no answer was needed.
"Um ... yes me you too, but that's different from a lifelong commitment to each other, we could never be happy ... alone," Harry added, barely audible. Draco took a deep breath and nodded.
"I know they were the first friends you ever had and they were like your family, even more so after your parents died," completely surprised, Remus looked at the other.
"Yes, because this boy could become my son's soul mate and I want, no I demand, that you at least try to treat him as if you care," Lucius said insistently. Severus remained silent and turned. He walked down the stairs and then turned to Lucius once more.
"Believe me, the movement is the be-all and end-all. Well, and the destination, determination, deliberation! These are the words they teach you ... so you have to learn that and then it works," Remus said.
"I don't know, I know how I feel and so do you, but you're right, it's a big step," Draco said and lay back on his side, hugging Harry to him.
"I want to see the sun at last, I can't stand the weather here," Draco grumbled. In fact, the sun had not been seen for days and it rained again and again.
"And where is my favourite granddaughter?" he then said, taking Lily from Severus' arms. The latter shook his head with a smile.
"Dray I'm not jealous, at most a little envious," Harry said, grinning now. Draco shook his head in amusement and kissed his friend gently.
"Hey, yeah I'm going to die too because we have a soul bond, but we'll be together and that's all that matters," Draco said, squeezing Harry's hand tighter.
He grabbed some appropriate clothes and went to the bathroom to change quickly. He really felt embarrassed about what had happened and he isn’t willing for Ron to expose him because he hid things under his couch. He went out to see them talking.
And that’s how they ended up kissing in a Janitor’s closet for a moment. Using the ‘my boyfriend has forgotten something from his classroom’ excuse which he thinks his friends did buy.
“Don’t worry, Harry.” He smiled and took his hand and held it “I won’t do it again.. so are we there yet?”
Things were going well they hanged out most of the times. They even watched the football game and went to get ice cream afterwards.
“We were supposed to eat remember but we decided to skip it.” Harry rolled his eyes and took a huge bite of his burger.
Jealousy was not really his forte but he had been jealous before. When he was a child he sometimes despised the stirring feeling in his stomach whenever he saw his crush talking with another person that wasn’t him.
“Hi.” She says and handed his drink. He mumbled a quick thank you and kissed her cheek. He could feel Cedric looking at them but Ron started an odd topic which eased the tension.
“Im deciding wether I should go back or just stay here to hang with you.” He says and Harry panicked. He didn’t clean his room and his bed was a mess.
Harry never admitted it but he felt an admiration towards him. Cedric was his first ever friend when he was a newbie in the school. He was very kind that he showed him around school and introduced him to his friends.
“It’s no biggie, I only showed you my amazing skills in playing Mario Kart.” Harry shrugged and flexed his muscles which made Draco laugh.
“I-I well.” She sighs and looks down at their hands “Harry, I’m sorry to tell you but we should break up.. I met this girl and I really like her a lot and-.”
“I know, If I were me I’d-“ Draco says but was interrupted by a female who introduced herself as Pansy.
There was a brief silence until Ron coughed and decided to tell them a new joke he had been wanting to say to them.
Harry obeyed and looked up at Draco’s light grey eyes. He moves closer to wrap his arms around Draco and presses a kiss against his neck. Draco darts his tongue out to lick his lips and then leans closely to press a soft kiss against his lips. Harry shudders against him and he feels his fingers tighten around his waist as they continued to kiss.
“You wimp.” Draco chuckled “it’s a steel staircase and besides the building looks pretty expensive. I’m sure that the architects build it well to avoid you from falling, Potter.”
He cared for the boy; he was very sure about that fact. He was overthinking too much about this and Harry knew that he shouldn’t but he couldn’t control his own mind. He felt his migraine worsening.
Harry started to tell her about his secret relationship with Cedric in to which brought his mother to tears because she didn’t want him to feel like that.
“I’m fine and I just wanna go home.” Harry shrugged and the other boys face frowned. “You can go now, thank you for your concern.”
Cliche it may have sounded, thinking too much about it, how can you not forget about a young handsome lad that accidentally touched your hand while on the train. It was quite awkward honestly but Harry wished he could see him again. Just a sight of his messy white-blond hair and pale skin. Damn, even his back was so handsome.
“Neville invited them.” Luna says and grinned “aren’t you happy harry that you get to hang out with Draco.”
They ate the dish together on the kitchen bar. Harry almost moaned to how good it was, it’s been weeks since he ate a home cooked meal made by someone. Draco reminded him of his mother, he was sweet and a bit silly. He was talented and knew how to cook; his mother also knew how to cook and he couldn’t wait to let his friend meet his mom. They would probably bond over sharing some recipes and that made him smile.
Harry was in awe of the Manor. It was even more beautiful on the inside. There were lots of portrait to which he assumes is the whole Malfoy family. They all had gorgeous white- blonde hair and piercing grey eyes.
He rang the doorbell once and waited for anyone to open the door. After a minute, he was greeted by a butler who greeted him by his last name.
“Boyfriend!” Draco waves at him, as per usual he was leaning back against his locker. He waved back and had a dopey smile on his face.
“It’s okay, it’s the school’s fault.” He mumbles feeling a bit guilty for lying to him as he helped Draco put his groceries inside the basket he was bringing.
“Ron.” He called for his best friend who immediately told him to come. He went and they all greeted him.
“Nev, you can’t be serious.” Harry groaned as he watched the boy fall down while approaching his crush.
“You’re welcome.” He blushes then Draco lets go of his hand. He was about to walk away when Harry called for him.
“Please?” Draco said in a soft voice “also I’m doing the cute eye thing where Pansy told me is a weakness to most human beings.”
“Actually, can you help me out? I’m new in this town and my first time going into this shop.” He lied a bit “I’m a bit lost on where to find some things.”
Immediately, Harry hated the attention and stopped doing obnoxious things and attending to parties. Ron was a bit disappointed but was thankful that his funny face (because he wasn’t photogenic) wasn’t on the internet already.
The white blonde haired nods and tries to steady his breathing. Harry stays silent, waiting for him to say anything.
“Oh right.” Harry said “My mom told me about that.. they spent a night in this tent shaped igloo and it was freezing.”
“I’ll have to pass.” He said feeling a bit tired “I’d have to find my friends and see if they’re okay.”
After, looking at the attractions it was now noon time and Harry decided to take him to the ice cream shop. They decided to just walk towards the store since it was only a walking distance.
“N-nothing.” Draco looked away and took another bite of his burger. His cheeks were flushed for some reasons.
He walked towards the kitchen to get a snack for both him and the weeping girl. As he reached out a snack placed above a counter, someone poked his back. He yelped and quickies turned around to see the git who turned out to be Draco.
“Yeah, I should just skip.” He said taking off his glasses massaging the bridge of his nose ”I mean it’s only one classes left for this day.”
“You can’t just do that, what if there was an asshole drunk driving and didn’t notice the traffic signal?” Harry explained feeling panicked “I’m sorry it’s just the things I’ve... well read online, stuff happens and it sucks.”
Harry left his house early and went to the cemetery where Cedric was buried. When he arrived he placed a single rose to the ground. He sat down for awhile and looked at the sky.
Kissing Draco had become one of Harry’s favorite things to do. They were still making out on the bed in Blaise’s house.
“With my friends and this girl who was sitting with me on the living room.” He told him and he nods while opening the chips.
“Cedric, you didn’t have to do that..” Harry cried “I’m so sorry if I had been more careful this would happen.”
“Are you still mad at her?” Draco laughing at him interrupted his thoughts “Don’t worry, Darling. I only like you.”
Hermione raised her eyebrows while Ron continued laughing. He felt a bit embarrassed but Mione gave him a comforting smile which made him think she was cool with it.
“I know, I know.” She said “you know what, he never shuts up about you and it’s getting so annoying.”
“Harry.” It was Draco voice and he turned around to see him with a worried look. “I was outside looking for you.”
The party was such a bore for him; his friends were enjoying, dancing and drinking their guts out. He sat in the couch with a random girl next to him who was talking about how her life ruined because of her bf cheating on her.
“Harry!” He felt Cedric pushed him and he fell down. He could hear a bone crushing and when he looked Cedric was underneath the car.
“Neither do I.” Harry said, truthfully. “You left in a hurry and I forgot to give you my phone number.”
“Mm, how about we exchange our number right now.” Draco offered and brought out his phone and handed it to Harry. He immediately typed out his number and gave it back. It took a few minutes when Draco finally sent him a message composing of a celebration emoji.
He was still mad about Draco talking to a girl at the party. So he pretty much avoided the boy even though Draco seldom asks him to hang out with him sometimes. He rejected and managed to reason that he always managed to ask at the wrong times so he had to reject him. Also Harry had classes on that time and  he was pretty quite serious about school.
“I just met him. Don’t be stupid.” She rolled his eyes “this is Harry and that is my brother named Ron.”
Two minutes had passed until he could see Hermione and Draco together walking towards them. He felt his heart beating rapidly at the sight of him. Draco looked good as always of course he was wearing all black today except for his shoes which was brown boots. His hair was gelled back perfectly.
The Ferris wheel started to move slowly. Harry could feel they were ascending. He plans to ask him out when they reach into the top.
I don’t think I could upload next week but I promise the next chapter will have loads of PDA. BECAUSE we love PDAs especially from DRARRY.
"Don't cry Hagrid. Without you ... I think you're a great teacher, don't give up on this and please look after Hedwig, okay?" asked Harry, hugging Hagrid, hugging the latter's thigh rather than anything else, of course. The half-giant patted him on the back as gently as he could.
"In the Room of Requirement at 8pm. Can you sneak out without getting caught?" Harry wanted to know and a smile was now on his lips.
"Draco my boy, Potter will be your undoing," Voldemort said, pointing his wand at the Slytherin. Harry reacted immediately and pulled his husband behind him and said, "I love you!" before turning back to Voldemort.
"He teaches me occlumency again and teaches me how to empty my mind in the evening so that I don't have nightmares anymore," he explained.
"Thanks, I'm all right, but still need to take it easy. Hair...er...freshly washed," Harry said quickly because he couldn't think of anything better to say. Draco looked at him thoughtfully.
"Well I don't know what's so interesting about Messrs Malfoy and Potter, but it would be nice if you would turn your attention to me now," Snape thundered and everyone immediately turned to the teacher. For Harry, the lesson was a gauntlet. Snape pestered him and although he could answer every question, he gave him no points. Draco, meanwhile, felt unbridled anger in his belly. Not at the situation, not at Potter, but at his godfather. Why did Snape treat Harry like that, and just when he was already down?
"Are you coming?" Draco's voice snapped him out of his thoughts. The Slytherin table was emptying and Draco and Blaise seemed to have finished eating as well. Harry nodded and walked out of the hall behind them. It was close and for a brief moment they were separated, not far but enough for Harry to slump in pain.
"Well ... nothing. I can't talk about it yet, but ... let's not. We'll do everything as I said. Protecting them is the most important thing now. I would defiantly ask you to work with Horace to find a way to separate them, that would be very important to me and I'm sure to Draco's parents as well," Severus nodded, but wasn't really satisfied with the answer.
"What is it then that gives you cause for concern?", Albus wanted to know and made two cups of tea appear.
"Scar?" asked Harry irritated and Draco nodded, pushed up his husband's shirt and then he could see it too. There was a lightning-shaped scar on his chest, just like the one on his forehead.
"Yes, possibly, but you should leave now. They'll be here in a few minutes and it would be better if you were gone by then!" said Severus.
"I'm not a father, but you look just like all the fathers I know. No one ever said being a father was easy."
"Yes, Ron ... I was dead, but I still look better than you," Harry opened his eyes and grinned. Hermione, Ron and Blaise were standing in front of his bed. Draco was also just waking up and rubbing his eyes.
"Leave it, there's something about detention together," Draco said, grinning briefly before turning back to the parchment.
"It's all right, I'm used to it. So do you have pyjama parties here often, or why the mattress?" asked Harry.
"What do you think is happening to us?", Harry wanted to know quietly and turned slightly. Draco leaned on his other arm and looked at him.
"If you kiss me, she'll think that's why we've been gone all day and no one will be surprised if we make another quick getaway after curfew," Hermione said, now clearly red in the face. Ron looked at her and couldn't quite believe that he was suddenly so close to his goal. He smiled and said, "Okay sounds like a plan," and before Hermione could say anything else back, she felt Ron's soft lips on hers. She couldn't form a clear thought, which was certainly very unusual for the Gryffindor, and leaned into the incredible kiss. They only broke away from each other when whistles, cheers and shouts sounded in her ear. They looked up and the entire common room was staring at them. Some shouted congratulations and Ginny grinned all over her face, only Lavender Brown snorted and ran out of the room.
"Those scars, that's your past and not important anymore, okay?" asked Draco then. Hesitantly, Harry nodded and then stripped off his sweatpants. Draco looked deep into his eyes and then shed the last of his clothes, as did Harry. Then they stepped into the shower together. The warm water poured down on them and Harry had no idea what to do. He just stood there and stared at Draco.
"Not so fast, but don't worry. The castle is big and we have safe hiding places here. I'm going to see Dumbledore now and you stay here and don't move, understand?", Harry and Draco looked at each other and then nodded hesitantly at the man. He turned and hurried towards the exit, but then reconsidered and came back once more. Without giving it much thought, he kissed first Draco and then Harry on the forehead, then hurried outside.
"We'll have to deal with that later. There's a bigger problem," Severus began, recounting the day's events. Narcissa sat down on the couch, pale, and looked at her husband, who looked similarly upset.
"Ron, he's not what you think. Please believe me! He would have been with me ...", Harry faltered. He had left out the part about the suicide attempt until now. Now he took a deep breath and began to tell the story. Hermione and Ron were paler than ever.
"Harry? Harry, come on wake up, you're dreaming," Draco shook the other's arm. It took a while, but eventually Harry opened his eyes and looked around, breathing heavily. His body ached, as if he had a full-blown muscle ache. They were in the hospital wing, but what had happened?
"Yes, Professor," said Neville, looking once more at Harry and then leaving the room with Hagrid. Madame Pomfrey meanwhile examined Harry and visibly turned pale.
"Actually, no. Yesterday, that was ... I was overwhelmed and just wanted to get away and forget everything."
"Good lesson, today. No homework, see you in two days," Hagrid closed the lesson. Harry picked up his bag and walked up to the castle. He was dreading the next lesson. They had Defence and besides Draco he had to meet Snape there and he had no idea how to act.
"P-Potter is dead," she said in a raspy voice and now turned to Draco, who was lying behind Harry, still holding his hand. She bent towards her son and here too she felt the pulse, stronger than Harry's and she also saw a fluttering of the eyelids. Draco was alive! She knew that it had to be quick now.
"I think we did it," Draco said and walked back over to the bed, sitting down on it and looking worriedly at Harry. His friend looked sad.
"Please," the teacher said and his voice was so sensitive and gentle that Harry responded. He looked up and gazed into the man's eyes and for the very first time, Severus Snape saw not James Potter, but only Harry.
"Well, everything. I mean, what would your parents say if they knew. Your father, he ... well, he's a Death Eater, isn't he? And you're chained to Harry Potter," Harry hadn't really meant to bring it up, but now it had just slipped out. He heard Draco breathing heavily today, then there was a rustle and the Slytherin turned the light back on. Harry blinked a few times and then looked at Draco, who didn't seem angry, but struck.
"Thank you, that means a lot," Harry said and then looked back at Draco, who now looked very sad and reached for his fiancé's hand.
"I ... we should get going, if it's okay. Miss Granger and Messrs Zabini and Weasley, will be at my door in half an hour," he then said hesitantly. Draco nodded and stood up, pulling Harry with him.
"Well after the end of the Death Eaters and after our son killed the Lord, it became known that we were working as spies for the Ministry. The Daily Prophet has had no other topic for days," Lucius explained.
"I know what you mean and I also promised Lily to look after him and to ... I am Draco's godfather, I held him in my arms when he was only a few hours old. Letting him die... you just feel so helpless, so weak and it kills me," he said and Remus looked up.
"Good morning," he said, looking inquiringly at Draco and Harry, who stood hand in hand in front of him.
"Don't go anywhere, okay?" whispered Harry, pressing himself even closer to Draco. The latter kissed his husband's temple and shook his head.
"Yes, really," he said and soon they were standing by the greenhouses. During the lesson he was able to talk to Ron and Hermione again, they had been worried, of course, after Harry and Draco were not present at dinner or the next day's lesson.
"Thank you and I'm really sorry for the way I treated you .... you both," Draco said and now also looked at Ron, who nodded slightly.
"No, but let's go," he said and took Harry's hand. They entered the forest and it was almost as if every sound was swallowed up here. No more birds could be heard, no more rustling of leaves, only silence. Although it was still broad daylight, almost no sunlight reached the ground.
"Sure and if you let me, it will be forever, however short it is," Remus said sadly. Severus nodded again and together they entered the Hogwarts grounds.
"I liked you when we were at school too, but there were the marauders and well, Black. When he came to Azkaban, I knew you were too desperate to think about anything else and when he came back ... he came back and you were a couple. I didn't know officially, but of course I wasn't blind all those years and when he died it just felt wrong," Severus concluded.
"Y-Yes, does that mean you had that burning sensation all the time too, even though we were so close?"
"They're bloody sharp. When they want to, they attack and can inflict some pretty nasty wounds," Harry explained further.
"All right, then let's set them up, but what are we going to do with the evening that has begun?", Draco wanted to know, not without ulterior motives.
"I'm not turning him in! He's my soul mate," Draco shouted, trying to give his voice a firm tone, but not really succeeding.
"Er...w-what's this?", Remus wanted to know, irritated. Severus rolled his eyes and took off his shirt. His counterpart turned pale when he saw the battered skin.
"Draco, we're chained together, we can't even go for a pee without the other. I mean you could, but... that's no life, neither for you, nor for me."
"I don't know, for a long time. I liked you back when we met in Angular Alley. You know, being your friend, I would have wanted that a lot, but Ron ... Ron was the first real friend I had, and you put him down, so... well, I decided that maybe you weren't worth it after all. But over the years... I think the bond was really always there, because I never stopped being attracted to you," Harry said guiltily.
"Don't you remember? The Ravenclaws I ... I went after them ...", Harry looked at Draco and it came back to him. The others had insulted them and then there was only pain.
"Okay, let's go," Draco said and began to undress, always making sure to stay as close to Harry as he could. By now he was wearing only his pants and looked questioningly at Harry.
"Yes, they'll be happy to take you into the family too, if ... if it all ends eventually," Severus said. Harry swallowed hard. He couldn't find the words. The Malfoy, who didn't know him at all, would take him in just like that, as their son, no, as their son's partner.
"If you two keep this up, everyone will realise something is wrong," Blaise murmured and Draco nodded.
"We'll manage. I'll talk to Severus, he'll somehow be able to get us into the castle unseen," Lucius said and put a reassuring hand on his wife's arm.
"Poppy? Mr Potter, I beg your pardon!" the healer said sternly. The next moment she put something on his face and immediately his vision cleared, though not entirely. Severus looked beside him and froze. In the bed beside him was himself. How could that be? He looked down at himself and ran a hand through his hair. Surely that wasn't his body.
"Do you want something to eat?" he then asked Draco. Draco sat next to Harry on the bed and held his hand. Barely perceptibly, he shook his head.
"KILLED YOU?" now Draco screamed and knelt on the bed. Tears of anger and despair in his eyes. Harry stared at him, completely stunned.
"Don't worry Weasley, you'll learn what illusion spells are," he said, then broke away from the others and walked to his parents with Harry holding his hand.
"Of course, fill them in. I'll talk to the colleagues, everyone has to make sure that there are never situations in which Harry and Draco could be separated. I just want the students to know that they will both suffer pain if separated, but that this bond will not last. The less they know, the better," Dumbledore said.
"I once learned that you always have a choice. Apparently that doesn't apply to Harry Potter ... he never had a choice," Severus said resignedly. A smile flitted across Remus' face.
"I believe you, but you never know. Please lie down and Mr Malfoy you can sit at the foot of the bed," said Poppy. Draco nodded and made room while Harry lay down on his back with a sigh.
"Yes, mine too. Then sit here on the bed," Harry said and slid a little to one side. Draco hesitated briefly, but then did as he was told.
"Yeah, I guess if it hadn't affected me too," Blaise's gaze moved to Harry, who was still engrossed in his book, and then back to Draco.
When Lucius came back into his and Narcissa's room, Harry and Draco were already asleep in the middle of the larger conjured bed. Draco, as usual, had one arm around Harry and their hands were tightly intertwined. Narcissa sat on the edge of the bed and stroked her son's head.
"Shut up Lupin!", Harry shook his head with a smile, maybe the rest of the week wouldn't be quite so awful after all.
"I'll take you. Harry, Draco, you can stay here overnight. I'll come back for you at noon," Severus said and left the room with Remus and the others. Dumbledore patted Harry and Draco somewhat awkwardly on the shoulder before leaving as well.
" ... hurt him, he haunts you, and not in the nice way," he finished with a grin. The teacher rolled his eyes theatrically.
"Maybe the timing is just right. We both need someone now to keep us from despairing, don't we?" asked Remus. Severus looked up at the castle and then back at the man beside him. He kissed his temple briefly and nodded.
"Yes, the diary was a Horcrux, which is why you were able to render it harmless with the basilisk fang."
"Remus? Are you all right?" asked Harry, who couldn't help noticing the worried look on the man's face.
"You saw it, Fawkes, didn't you?" Albus looked thoughtfully at his faithful phoenix. He tilted his head and trilled softly.
"He practically asked us to have sex, it's funny," Draco said and now sat down at the table. Harry shook his head in amusement and followed suit.
"Harry James Malfoy, I am proud that you are part of our family, even if only for a short time. We will carry your story to the world and you are not to blame for any of this. You are a victim, just like Draco, please understand that," he said, pulling the young man into his arms one more time. They stood like that for a while until Lucius broke away and took his wife's hand.
"Well, you almost killed him in your recklessness. He had internal bleeding that could hardly be stopped. Through your connection you were able to transfer some of your magic to him and so he was able to begin to heal and now tell me why you did that, even though I can understand it not being easy around him, you knew what was at stake," Severus said seriously. Draco was his godchild and he had known him since birth, all the more reason for him to care for his welfare and if Potter died, there was still the possibility that Draco would not survive this either.
Harry and Draco continued walking towards the Forbidden Forest. Near Hagrid's hut, Dumbledore stood and came towards them.
"Er...guessed!" said Harry quickly and before Snape could say anything else back he blacked out and fell to the floor.
"Don't you have to go?", Blaise Zabini looked questioningly at his best friend, who was putting away his homework.
"So you go to the toilet first and I'll take a shower. That should be fine, neither is too far away, okay?" suggested Draco. Harry just nodded. Last night's conversation was still hanging over him. He saw Draco a little differently now. It almost seemed as if the other actually cared about him. While Draco showered, he went to the toilet and then, without thinking about it, took off his top.
"But Draco, still ... it would be a lifelong commitment and I-I don't have anyone else, no family or anything, but you do and for my sake I don't want you to lose yours too," Draco shook his head and placed his hand gently on Harry's cheek.
"Well, as long as they don't move more than two metres away, it's all good, but .... well Mr. Potter might die if Mr. Malfoy moves away for a longer period of time or if the distance gets bigger, I guess. Mr. Malfoy doesn't show such strong reactions, but I can't estimate how a longer separation would affect him."
"Sure, sure ... so we're finally separated and it's really ... relieving," Harry said unconvincingly. Neville looked at him inquiringly.
"Didn't she kiss you? I saw you when we got off the train," slowly it dawned on Harry again and he grinned.
"Potter, now don't make such a fuss!", Snape snapped, and Harry winced. Suddenly he felt terribly alone, even Draco didn't dare look at him. Furious now, he took off his jumper, stripped off his shirt and tried just not to be here. Madame Pomfrey looked at Severus, who now stepped a little closer. The old wounds and scars looked much worse in the bright light than they had last night. They stretched from his back across his chest to his stomach. The upper arms were also affected. Some of the wounds had barely healed. Add to that the fact that the young man was really skinny, although you could see obvious muscle from the Quidditch training, Harry Potter was a prime example of an abused and neglected child. Draco looked doggedly in another direction, but he could feel Harry's trembling despite himself. Everything in him screamed for them to stop, for them to leave Harry alone, but he couldn't move to protect him.
"Maybe, but still and that's not a request," the teacher said and was gone in a moment. Harry sighed and reached for his bag.
"We're glad too and Blaise is right, we'll always be here for you as long as we can," Hermione said, hugging them both as well, while Ron nodded.
"We ... we are engaged," Draco said at some point and smiled when he saw the surprised faces of his parents.
"Come, let's sit down in the sand. I am here because you need me to keep your true soul anchored. I'll show you the two paths you can take, so to speak."
Inwardly. Wait, had Draco just said "uncle"? It didn't help. He straightened his shoulders and opened.
"Are Snape and Slughorn come further?" Ron wanted to know. Harry sensed that Draco was listening carefully and so he nodded.
"Harry dear, well ... well, that was a surprise. Congratulations! To you, too, of course, Draco," Molly said. Harry looked at his husband, who nodded invitingly.
When Severus Snape came back into the dining room, he immediately spotted Remus at one of the back tables. He crossed the room and sat down with the werewolf.
"That only the Horcrux would die? No, I hoped so in a way, but I didn't know. Well, Harry, I guess you'll stay special. Who can claim to have survived a Death Curse twice? That'll go with you, I suppose, but at least now you can share the glory. Because your husband killed the Dark Lord," Albus said with a mild smile.
"No Ron, it's no one's fault. If I had reacted faster, I would have run after the idiots too," Harry said quickly and Draco turned back to repotting and Blaise.
Harry went into the bathroom. He was alone here at this time of night and that was just fine with him. He took off his shirt and groaned slightly. His shoulder still hurt like hell and he was glad that Quidditch selection wouldn't be for another two weeks. His upper body was covered with slow-healing wounds and scars. He quickly showered and pulled on his shirt and sleeping pants. He slipped under his covers and closed the curtains of the four-poster bed. Slowly he lay down and felt the stabbing pain in his back. He turned onto his left side, the only position in which he could lie reasonably pain-free. Then cast another silence spell and sank into a sleep dominated by nightmares.
"Oh, he was special ... very special and ... let's not do this. You should go. I'll deal with the school and ... and the rest when the time comes," Dumbledore said and put a hand on the shoulder of the two boys.
"Yes, it's curfew, no one will see us, but you should put some clothes on anyway, I'll wait outside the door," the teacher said curtly and walked out of the room.
"Okay listen Malfoy. I'm sitting with the Slytherins, sleeping here and I'm practically chained to you if I don't want to die. At least spare me the looks of the Slytherins, that's all I ask," Harry said with deep resignation in his voice. Blaise looked at Draco, who sighed, sat down on his bed and began his homework as well.
"So now I have another surprise, come on," said the half-giant and led the class a little further into the forest. Suddenly they were standing in a clearing, but nothing was visible.
"I know ... I know how hard this is, I'm no different with Draco, but if we despair now, so do the boys and is that what you want?" he then asked gently and Remus shook his head as there was a knock at the door.
"Come on darling, we're counting on you Severus!" he said. Severus nodded and stroked Narcissa's arm briefly.
"You didn't? But I saw you swimming at the Triwizard Tournament," Harry laughed out loud and shook his head.
"We have tried everything, but have found nothing. There is no other solution if the war is ever to end. Believe me, I'd go to the ends of the earth with both of them if I knew it would help, but it wouldn't change anything here."
"What your father wants to say, we are very happy. We're going to have a fun few days, aren't we Siri?"
"No Harry, you can't. The students would want to know why the potions professor is in the hospital wing. It's better if no student knows about your accident, not even your friends," Dumbledore said and Harry nodded, albeit hesitantly.
"Um ... what do you want to know? They're normal, I'd say. I know my father seems very distant, but that's part of his role," Draco explained.
"I'm sorry," Harry said then, not daring to look up. Lucius stepped up to him and put a finger under his chin so that he looked at him.
"You should eat a little more, boys," Narcissa Malfoy, watched Harry and Draco anxiously. They had had breakfast brought to their room. The room waiter had not looked bad when he brought breakfast for four for the two Malfoys, but after a princely tip, he had asked no questions.
When they reached at the ticket booth for the Ferris wheel. Harry had to let go of Draco’s hand to pay for their tickets. After paying, they went inside to their designated area and sat down.
“Maybe, I could teach you some recipes someday.” Draco offered “my mom taught me how to cook when I was kid so ever since then I’ve been learning how to.”
They continued laughing and teasing Harry who was growing even more redder. Until all of their friends arrived and finally the topic had shifted from Harry being distracted to Holiday plans.
When he arrived at the school, it was a clean environmental friendly type of school. He didn’t expect much but it surprised him; there were only a few students by the front of the entrance, hanging out and some reading a book. He breathed in the clean air and went in passing over the other students. The hallway was extravagant; it’s design was very modern with a mix of classical touch designs. No wonder his mother chose this school for him.
