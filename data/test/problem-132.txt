Harry could feel the other man behind him, could sense his presence, but Lucius did nothing. The Death Eater regarded her cooling for a few moments before he turned away. “She is yours, Potter.” He murmured before he strode from the room, going in search of his wife. As always, the preservation of his family won out against whatever duty he still had to the fallen Dark Lord.
By this time Draco was panting, the words spilling from Harry’s lips and his actions sending fire coursing through his skin. A voice in the back of his head had made itself known, presenting the idea that maybe, just maybe, having a Vampire ravish him wouldn’t be all that terrible. For now Draco was able to resist the voice, pushing it away and willing it silent, but he knew that eventually he’d give in, eventually he’d listen. He’d ignored the voice before, and the voice had been right. His choice not to listen had caused him pain, so much pain…he wouldn’t make that mistake again. “Potter…” he breathed, unable to get out much more before the Vampire spun on the spot, apparating them away from the street. The crack of apparation faded away and sound returned to the street. It was as though Draco Malfoy had never set foot there.
Draco nodded. “Yes.” He lied easily, sitting up in bed and stretching his arms over his head. If he was being honest, his sleep was far from easy. Ever since Snape had given Harry the potion that would eventually cure Harry, Draco’s nights had been plagued by nightmares. Visions of Harry being ripped from his grasp flashed through his dreams again and again, followed by the terror and pain that the Dark Lord would great him with the moment the vampire wasn’t there to protect him. But he couldn’t tell Harry any of that. The vampire could never know what he was truly given in that goblet Draco had coaxed him to drink from, on orders from the Headmaster and Minister of Magic, of course. Harry could never know that within three weeks time he would lose the blonde, no longer needing him for his blood.
Harry was thinking about Harry Pottery stuff and was jolted out of his thoughts by the door of the Room of Requirement opening. Harry walked inside and the door closed behind him, casting him in darkness
Hermione and Ron looked up from their spots at the one long Christmas table to see Harry swaggering into the Great Hall with a self-satisfied smirk. He slid into the empty seat across from them and grinned. "Hey guys, sorry I'm late."
Slowly Draco nodded, biting his lip. “Yes, Harry, it was him. You’re…you’re the one who’s supposed to kill him, so he tried to make you into a weapon for his own use. I…I’m not sure why he decided to make me your mate-“ he started before the vampire cut him off.
Harry frowned and shook his head. "No...I feel the same. Hopefully this was either the nighttime one or the wildest dreams come true one. But I still want to find out who sent it. Come on, let's go to breakfast."
Harry shifted slowly, he was kind of sore, and places that had never hurt before hurt. He closed his eyes remembering what had happened in his dream. At least it WAS just a dream; he would never be able to face the school if it somehow got out that he had spent Valentine's night with Draco-sodding-ferret-boy-Malfoy.
The vampire cocked a curious eyebrow. “Does it really feel that good?” he asked, pure curiosity in his voice. He wasn’t mocking him, making fun of Draco.
Ever since Harry had returned to Hogwarts carrying the head of the defeated Dark Lord something was different about their friend. Something…off. They weren’t sure if it was merely the loss of a few months of memories or if it was something else entirely, something far more sinister. Occasionally Ron would catch the look in his eye; the wild look of hunger and evil, as if he creatures were still inside of him, just waiting out their time. Then other times Harry would look lost and empty, as though he had misplaced something of great importance and yet couldn’t remember what it was he had lost in the first place.
Draco panted, his eyes wide as he trembled in fear underneath the vampire. There were tears in his eyes as he looked up at Harry, the pain slowly fading from his body. “I-I’m sorry, Harry.” He whispered, curling up into a tight ball.
Immediately Draco's face turned bright red. Potter could only mean...oh god, this was turning out to be the best Christmas Draco had ever had. "You-you can't be serious." he stuttered.
“Not yet.” Draco shook his head. “I was supposed to be branded this upcoming summer.” He explained nervously, his jaw clenching slightly. “And now I never will be. Do you know the only think worse than not bearing the mark?” he asked the two Gryffindor’s, voice hard and unyielding. Slowly the pair shook their heads, remaining silent. “Defiling the place where the Mark goes. That spot is supposed to be for the Dark Lord, and now Harry has claimed it for himself. Claimed
The Gryffindors and Slytherins all jumped in their seats as Snape banged into the room, muttering darkly about "pink ribbons and glossy blonde hair", whatever that was about. He barked some directions nobody really was listening to and then collapsed into his chair in weariness. Valentine's Day was always most trying for those of a more subtle nature. Or those who just hate pink and overloads of chocolate.
Eyes widening almost comically, Draco gaped up at his best friend. “You have?! Who??!” he exclaimed, deciding to ignore the twinge of hurt that information sent through his heart. He’d had enough pain and heartbreak for one day. And after having a taste of Harry Potter…Draco wasn’t even sure he’d want to go back to Blaise anyway. Deep inside of him there still lingered a small spark of hope. The hope that some day Harry would break all of the rules and remember what everyone said he was supposed to forget. He was Harry Potter after all; doing the unexpected was what he did.
With almost a cry, Harry pounced onto Draco, straddling the blonde. “I’ll erase their scent from your skin.” He hissed, nuzzling the curve of Draco’s throat. “I’ll burn their memories from your mind. I’ll drink you down and fill you up until I’m the only one you remember, the only one you want.” Harry promised and Draco shivered. Was this what he wanted?
Draco laughed softly. “Well I’m glad you think that, Harry. I slept amazingly well.” He admitted with a small smile. “You’re a nice, um, bed partner.”
Harry chewed his lip, trying to keep a silly grin from spreading across his lips. Oh, today was his lucky day indeed... "Well, Malfoy...what usually comes after kissing with illegal amounts of tongue action?"
Draco’s eyes widened as he gaped at Dumbledore for a few moments. “I…really?” he asked before his eyes narrowed. “How do you know?”
Again the vampire nodded, looking nervous. “Do you think I can see them?” he asked softly. “You don’t think I’m too dangerous?”
“Don’t hurt Dumbledore, Harry.” Draco murmured before he sat up. “Coming, Headmaster!” he called, inwardly cursing the old man for interrupting their moment, but knowing nonetheless that the Headmaster would only come if it was urgent. He turned to Harry, giving him a feeble smile. “We’ll continue this later, alright? Once we figure out what he wants.”
“Yeah…” Harry intoned, pulling Ron from his internal musings. “I guess you’re right. But still…” he frowned, brow furrowing as his gaze sought the Slytherin table again. His skin prickled as Draco looked up and their eyes met for a moment before the blond quickly averted his gaze again. Harry absentmindedly toyed with the pendant that hung around his neck, his eyes gaining that unfocused, lost look again.
Slowly Draco nodded, his stomach clenching as he realized what would happen now. Now he would leave, never to see Harry again, and that space in his chest that now was filled with a comforting warmth would once again be cold and empty. “Y-yeah. It-it was great.” He nodded, shoving aside the nauseous feeling churning in his stomach. “You’re a great shag. I…I’ll just be going, sorry I fell asleep.” He mumbled, sitting up and making to leave the bed.
Harry’s tongue flicked out, licking his lips as the Incubus fed on the fear surrounding him. He turned to Bellatrix, easily knocking her wand away with a wave of power. “You killed Sirius.” He hissed, eyes practically glowing with the force of his rage. “And you will suffer.”
“Hey, Potter.” Draco answered with a slight smile, dropping his bag by his desk. “I see you finally took me up on my offer.”
The voice in the back of Draco’s mind was screaming, yelling at him to say nothing and get out of there, to escape while he still could. But Harry’s voice was like a drug, dulling Draco’s senses and making him so full of yearning for more that he was speaking before he even realized the words were leaving his mouth. “Years.” He breathed. “Probably longer. Didn’t…didn’t realize it until I saw that picture. The one of you in the Prophet…with the blonde.”
Trying not to swallow in fear, Severus nodded, holding out a vial of a dark and swirling liquid. “Yes, My Lord. The potion is complete. If I may ask, My Lord, what is this potion to be used for? It’s rather unpredictable, and if used in the wrong circumstances it could have terrible consequences.” He barely resisted the temptation to flinch back as Voldemort turned, giving him a cold and bone-chilling look.
“Of course.” Hermione nodded, standing up and offering Draco her hand. “If you need any help of anyone to talk to, we’re always here.” She announced, ignoring Ron’s horrified expression.
Almost immediately a pink flush spread across Draco’s cheeks. Was that why he was acting this way, so differently from his usual nature towards the vampire? “Of course not.” Draco scoffed, crossing his arms over his chest in a defensive gesture. “I just don’t want to go to Azkaban, which is where I’ll end up if you die.”
In the dungeons deep below Malfoy Manor, Harry groaned, opening his eyes as he heard a noise beside him, and immediately blinking in the dim light of his cell. Last he remembered he had been fighting with Draco Malfoy on the Quidditch Pitch, not another soul in sight, and now here he was. He sat up, blinking as the face of a smiling house elf came into focus next to him.
“You’re not supposed to be here, are you?” Harry asked with an arched eyebrow, seeing the outline of the woman stiffen at his words.
Hermione frowned again, the expression deepening as she noticed just how weary the Slytherin was. “What do you mean?” she asked, making sure to keep her voice calm and unaccusing. It wouldn’t do to frighten off Draco before he told them anything good. “Harry can’t be-“
Then Draco's eyes widened and he squeaked in surprise as Harry strode quickly forward and pulled him into a heated kiss that only lasted moments before he pulled away and turned to leave. But to Harry's horror, even though they'd kissed, he still couldn't move from under the mistletoe.
me. You drink my blood, that’s it! It doesn’t mean I can’t kiss Blaise or hang out with other blokes!”
Shaking the dark thoughts from his head, Draco looked up at the darkening sky with relief. He was almost tempted to just find a nearby bar and drink his sorrows away, but he knew where that would lead. He’d get drunk and end up taking some bloke home with him, and he didn’t want that. Not tonight.
"Mh hm." Draco smirked, noticing the flick in Harry's eyes. "Think you can handle kissing a Slytherin, Potter?" he drawled.
He didn’t knock before he opened the door, striding into the blind darkness. He almost hoped to see Harry’s dead, crumpled body sprawled out on the floor, but all he saw was an impenetrable darkness. Not even cooling embers glowed in the hearth. “Potter?” Draco breathed, his heart pounding faster at the very real possibility that Harry was dead. He wanted the vampire to suffer, yes, but he also didn’t want to spend the rest of his miserable life locked up in Azkaban like his crazy aunt.
Draco quickly scooted away from Harry on the bed, pulling his knees to his chest before he registered the sticky wetness around his groin. Immediately his eyes widened in horror. “Did…did I…” he trailed off, unable to voice it.
“Keep telling yourself that, mate.” Harry answered with a sly grin, snickering softly. Draco could almost call himself happy to see the vampire had regained some of his color and the shaking through his body had stopped.
Numbly Draco nodded, his mind reeling. Three weeks. That’s all he had left with what was possibly the best thing to ever happen to him. While he hadn’t yet admitted it to himself outright, deep down Draco knew that he liked what he had. He liked being Harry’s mate, being
In his room in Hogwarts Draco Malfoy lay curled up on his bed, a sickly guilt twisting through his stomach. His task was complete, yet he was still worried. It had been simple, really. All he had to do was get Harry alone, knock him out, and then slip him the Portkey to take him straight to the dungeons in Malfoy Manor. Everything had gone according to plan and Draco’s father had assured him that Potter would remember nothing of what happened. No one would know that Draco had a part to play in the scheme and no one would know that Potter was gone.
It was Draco’s turn to blush and he pouted, nudging Harry’s shoulder. “It’s not my fault it feels so good.” He grumbled. “And can Vampires even get fat? I thought that the point of them was to be lithe and desirable in order to seduce unwary prey and have their wicked way with them.” He smirked slightly. “Which, I must say, you hit the mark dead on with what I find attractive. Was that on purpose?”
Once he got to the privacy of his own room, Draco groaned in frustration, stripping quickly as he made his way to the bathroom. He turned the water on warm, stepping beneath the spray and gripping himself tightly with a breathy moan. He closed his eyes, Harry’s face and the rest of the vampire’s body immediately presenting itself in the forefront of his mind. He tried his best to ignore the thought that he was getting off to the thought of Harry bloody Potter, but still when he reached bliss it was to the breathy moan of “Harry” upon his lips.
Once Draco was stretched enough, the man himself writhing and pleading for Harry to be within him, Harry finally removed his fingers from his arse. Draco let out a whimper at the loss, lifting his head so he could look down his body to where Harry was slicking his cock and lining up with his entrance. He could feel it, the hot, thick head pressed against his opening, not yet breaching it in the way that he so desperately wanted. Slowly Harry lowered himself down on top of Draco, keeping his cock in position as he pressed soft kisses to Draco throat. The blonde let out a whimper of pure need and Harry smiled against his skin. “Ready?” he asked throatily, fangs glistening in the light.
Instead Draco sucked harder, looking up at Harry from underneath his lashes as one hand crawled up to teased at Harry’s balls. That was all it took and before Harry could shout out a warning his hips shot forwards, nearly choking Draco, and he came.
Harry blinked, looking down at the necklace in surprise, as if just noticing its existence. “This thing? I…” he trailed off, face screwing up in concentration as he tried to remember. But there was no memory of its previous existence to be found. “I’m not quite sure.” He shrugged. “I guess someone gave it to me. It…I like it.” He murmured softly, unwilling to admit that wearing it gave him comfort. Harry didn’t know how to explain it, but wearing the pendant helped to anchor him. Like it was holding him together and without it he would shatter into a million pieces.
Quickly Harry pulled his hand away from Draco’s pants, as if burned, a confused frown slipping onto his lips. “I’m sorry.” He quickly apologized, peering up at Draco with wide, dark eyes. “I thought you liked it. The noises you were making… they sounded pleasurable.”
The first signs of Harry’s change started at breakfast a week and a day after he had been infected. The signs started…and they didn’t stop.
In his darkened room, the vampire perked up, the Incubus reawakening within him. Harry took a deep breath, his tongue wetting his lips as he tasted the air. Yes, there is was. The unmistakable scent of his mate’s pleasure, his very essence. But the vampire held back, content to lurk in the shadows until the time was right. And… his tongue shot out again and Harry smirked, the Incubus becoming more excited. Judging by the thick scent, the time for Draco to submit to his want and need would be soon. Then he would take what he so desired.
Again Draco nodded slowly, glancing nervously towards the door to Harry’s room. “But it’s possible I’m not his intended, right? We don’t know for sure.”
“Then…maybe in a few days you can sleep in my bed, get that contact you need?” Draco offered with a small smile. “Sorry it can’t be tonight…I’m still rather shaken up about this.” He admitted, a light blush decorating his cheeks. Truth be told, Draco needed some time to think things through, decide where to go from here. On one hand he could comply with the vampire’s wishes, give himself over body and soul to the Gryffindor and savior of the Wizarding world, and in the process become a disgrace to the family name and probably get killed by the Dark Lord even though, as Draco saw it, this was all the Dark Lord’s fault to begin with. The second option that Draco cold see involved refusing to give Harry what he needed, killing the vampire in the process, and getting carted off to Azkaban for the rest of his life. All in all, Draco found the first option far more appealing than the second, baring the part about being murdered by the Dark Lord himself.
.” He hissed out the name, sending shivers coursing down Draco’s spine. “Are you willing to become mine?”
A frown crossed Draco’s lips as Harry stopped feeding, knowing it certainly couldn’t have been enough for the starving vampire. “Keep drinking.” He growled.
Harry chuckled, easily reading the expression on Draco’s face. “No, they haven’t. Granted, I’ve never claimed any of the others before.” He grinned, leaning forwards to press a light kiss to Draco’s forehead. “I think the claiming is a bit more…exhausting then my normal feeding, you know?”
For a few moments Draco gaped after him, leg still tingling from where Harry had brushed up against his upper thigh. Gathering his resolve, and with a light prod to his back from Blaise behind him, Draco swallowed and exited the train, stepping down onto the bustling platform below. His mother was easy enough to spot; her brilliant blonde hair practically glowing even as steam from the train swirled around her. His father’s absence was hardly a surprise, not after everything he had done. Due to extenuating circumstances and his, however unintentional, hand in the Dark Lord’s death, Lucius Malfoy had been placed under house arrest until further notice, and the family’s assets had been handed over to his mother for safe keeping.
Frowning, Draco tilted his head to the side in confusion, trying his hardest to swallow his anger. “But why would the Dark Lord capture Harry instead of just killing him?” he finally asked.
“Yes, My Lord.” The pair murmured in near unison, bowing low before they departed from the Dark Lord’s presence, their orders given.
By this time Draco had been attending classes regularly for over a month and to everyone on the outside it looked like his life had finally returned to normal. What most people completely missed, however, were the frequent and unmistakable glares and looks that two-thirds of the golden trio threw him at all hours of the day.
“Harry-Harry please-“ Draco protested as the vampire pinned him down under his body and ripped off his shirt.
"What the fuck Malfoy!" Harry yelled. "What are you doing sending chocolates to a boy!" then Harry clasped his hands over his mouth.
Letting out a bark of laughter, Harry nodded, nuzzling Draco’s neck like usual. There was a pause and then Harry was sinking his teeth into the soft skin of Draco’s throat. Draco let out a soft moan, an exhalation of breathy air, his eyes falling closed at the sheer bliss falling over him.
“You were so afraid.” Harry mumbled, hiding his face. “And after what happened last time… I-I just couldn’t bring myself to tell you. You were unhappy enough about this whole ordeal without having to come here twice a day. I…I don’t want you to be upset, Draco.” There were tears in his eyes when he finished.
Draco fingers played across Harry’s chest, tweaking and rubbing a nipple here, eliciting a gasp and throaty moan there. The nubs were peaked and red with abuse, and yet the Vampire arched into Draco’s touch, his body silently pleading for more.
Quickly Draco nodded, the very sight of Harry’s fangs spurring him on to get away. In moments he was out the door, the solid wood thunking closed behind him.
"Gosh Dean you are SO good at that." Seamus said breathlessly. Dean grinned up at the Irishman and licked his licks seductively.
At that statement Draco almost snorted scathingly, but something stopped him. There was something in the Vampire’s tone and mannerisms that made him hesitate. The Vampire was almost…caring. Yes, that was the closest word Draco could find for it. There was a cooing sound in the depths of Harry’s reverberating voice that calmed Draco, making his muscles and entire body relax.
To Harry's horror, the secret figure in the darkness decided at that very moment to make an appearance, showing himself to be none other than Draco Malfoy. But you already knew that, right?
Harry blinked. "No! Of course not! Don't be ridiculous, Malfoy!" he said quickly, diffusing the situation by placing his hands over Draco's hips. "You want to go to the feast, right?"
The blonde nodded, hoping the flush was gone from his cheeks. “Yeah, I’ll be back. And…and I’ll leave the door open.” He promised. After a moment he climbed off of Harry’s lap, glad his robes hid his distressing problem. “Have a nice evening, Potter.” He said before quickly hurrying out of the room.
just asked him a direct question and he had to answer. “Yes.” The Gryffindor finally admitted. “I do…yearn for your touch.”
All three Gryffindor's turned to look at the entrance to the Great Hall as the door opened and Draco walked through on slightly shaky legs, his hair a mess. "Speak of the devil..." Hermione breathed.
Draco smirked and looked over at the doors to the Great Hall, which just so happened at that very moment to open to admit the Golden Trio, Harry in the lead. He was looking rather sexy in the new sweater Molly Weasley had knitted him, Draco had to admit to himself. The Slytherin watched as Harry glanced over at him and looked quickly away before doing a double-take.
"Oh my god..." Harry whispered. "I thought I was straight, then I met you." his eyes were wide, making Draco fall on the floor laughing.
Harry flushed brightly and gave a little nod, pulling on the shirt Draco had picked out for him. “Isn’t once a day enough for you, mate of mine?” he teased lightly. “With the pace you’re setting, I’ll soon be fat and lazy off your blood.”
Blaise rolled his eyes good naturedly, ruffling Draco’s hair with mild protestations from the blonde. “Whatever you say, Draco.” He smiled. “It’s nice to have you back, though. The dorms just haven’t been the same without you.”
Harry shook his head, humming happily as he inhaled Draco’s scent deeply. “No, not that…” he murmured before he groaned. “You smell
Ron shrugged, biting into another one of the truffles Hermione had gotten him. "He's probably searching for that mystery sender of chocolates of his, or he's crying alone in a dark and shadowing corner." he said.
Nodding, the vampire forced himself to back down, sitting next to Draco on the couch and pulling his knees to his chest. There was a long pause of silence as they were each lost in their own thoughts before Harry finally spoke, his voice barely above a whisper. “Do you want to lock me in my room again?” he asked almost sadly.
"I don't know." he replied, showing her the letter. "Although I have a feeling I recognize that handwriting and the tone of voice..." he trailed off as a familiar expression lit up Hermione's face. "You have an idea."
"Sorry." Harry muttered, telling himself firmly to not look the other boy over. He made to push past Draco but found he couldn't take more than a step in either direction. "What the..."
But of course it did. Draco had known it since the moment he saw Harry in the robes shop when they were eleven. It just wasn’t realized until now. Harry was the only one who could possibly be worthy of him. The only one he’d ever want.
Severus nodded and flicked his wand at the door Draco had been eyeing, and it slowly swung open, showing nothing but darkness. Within the darkened room Harry looked up at the rectangle of light, squinting against the brightness. Something in the light called to him, a song of yearning and desire washing through his very soul. He wanted to call to it, sing to it and make it his own, but he remained quiet, the hunger pulling at him. Harry stood slowly, the motion oddly fluid and graceful, taking a few strides towards the door opening and the light. He paused, hiding back in the shadows a few feet from the doorway as he heard voices.
Slowly Harry stepped forwards, the crowd of robed and hooded figures parting to make way for the Dark creature. He could feel himself shifting, his body changing as more of his humanity melted away and the creatures within him surged forwards. His teeth sharpened, fangs extending, his nails turned to razor sharp claws, and a pair of black wings sprouted from his shoulders. At long last the Incubus was free to reign destruction upon everything he could get his claws on.
Later that evening Draco was doing his usual Prefect rounds before the feast when he for the third time that day found himself trapped in one spot. He swore under his breath and looked up to see another one of those blasted mistletoes.
A grin spread over Harry’s mouth and he eagerly kissed Draco again. “Brilliant. So you don’t mind the whole, you know, vampire thing?”
A smirk flash onto Harry's lips and in a flash his fingers were deafly unclasping Draco's robes and starting on the buttons of his shirt. "Oh, I most definitely am serious." he arched an eyebrow at the blonde. "Do you have any complaints? Or would you rather we be trapped here forever?"
In the Gryffindor Common Room Hermione and Ron sat snuggling in front of the fire. "Hermione can't we-" Ron said sleepily.
Harry nodded and handed the parchment over and Hermione scanned over the words. "Harry...I think this is
“I know because we allowed him to be captured.” Dumbledore admitted softly. As a look of rage passed over Draco’s face he held up a hand. “Now, now, I assure you he was never in any danger. With the strength he now possesses he was perfectly safe. You must understand, Mr. Malfoy, that this was one of the only chances we had to destroy Voldemort without him attacking the school.”
"Shall we talk? Or continue flirting at a distance." was Harry's reply. Of course he had meant to say, "Of course not you pompous prat!", but obviously that sentence wasn't happening any time soon.
"What's a new feature?" Harry asked, taking Draco's momentary distraction to look the Slytherin up and down. Man he was fit...
"What?" Draco blinked before following Harry quickly. The Gryffindor pulled Draco into his Common Room and up to his dorm, closing the door behind them tightly. "Potter, I really don't think-"
A flush rose in Draco’s cheeks and he rested against Harry’s chest, letting his head loll back on his shoulder to bare the tantalizing side of his throat to the Vampire. “Want your breakfast, Harry?” Draco practically purred.
Within Harry the Incubus slept, its battle with the vampire the previous night leaving it weak and tired. The vampire within Harry purred in contentment, pleased to finally sate himself with the blood he needed and to have his mate beside him.
Draco’s heart jumped in his throat, hammering hard as a wave of longing and need washed over him. They held each other’s gaze for what seemed to Draco like an eternity, the bite mark on his arm going from tingling to a throbbing pain. They looked at each other for so long that Draco began to feel a little hope. A spark that maybe, just maybe Harry would defy the odds and remember.
“Of course I do.” Harry murmured and Draco was so taken aback by the admission that he missed the way the vampire’s eyes shone with hunger. “And I will do as you wish.” Harry whispered, voice feather soft.
Slowly, grudgingly, the pair of Gryffindors nodded. “We’re sorry for doubting you.” Hermione finally said gently. “Once you two are more settled,” Ron winced at the word, looking slightly ill at the thought of his best friend and worst enemy being together like that, “will you allow us to see him? It…it might do him good to see us again.”
That idea surprised Draco and he paused, thinking it over. “Fine.” He finally nodded, turning on his heel and practically sauntering to the bathroom, his hips swinging in a fashion that bordered on lewdly. “But you’d better get your arse in here and quickly. And I’m washing your hair.”
been waiting for someone, someone who he thought he’d never have, not even in his wildest of dreams. Unbidden, the picture of Harry from the newspaper swam into the forefront of his mind, narrowing in on the blonde ravishing Harry senseless. How long had he wished for that man to be himself? How many times had he wanked at night, pretending that it was?
"Well that's a new feature..." Draco murmured thoughtfully as he looked up at the little decoration.
Finally, after almost five minutes of nervous pacing, Draco took a deep breath and knocked on the door gently. Moments later the door unlocked and Draco pushed it open, blinking into the darkness of Harry’s chamber. “H-Harry?” Draco mumbled quietly, slowly stepping into the dim light, his heart hammering in his chest.
The vampire nodded, visibly relaxing as Draco seemed alright. “Yes. Ron and Hermione.” He nodded again, trying his hardest to remember what his friends looked like. After a few moments of concentration the ginger and brunette’s faces swam into the forefront of his mind. “Do you really have to be gone when they get here?” he asked, a pout flickering across his lips.
That admittance made Draco flush with guilt and he quickly extracted himself from Harry’s embrace. “That…that’s great, Potter.” He murmured. “Now you…you should drink so I can go to sleep.” He said, offering Harry his hand and trying not to wince at the look that crossed the vampire’s face.
“Siren,” Harry answered curtly, turning from Draco as he felt his fangs extend, the hunger getting worse. “And Incubus. You need to go.”
Draco cursed softly, running a hand over his face tiredly as he made a mental note to have a serious talk with Blaise later about spreading true rumors. “It’s not that ridiculous, Weasley.” He said softly.
Harry nearly screamed in pleasure as the heat and wetness of Draco’s lips and mouth wrapped around him and Draco
In response the vampire hummed, letting even more of the Incubus’s powers leak through his barriers and reach Draco. He gave Draco’s cock one last tug and the blonde’s body seared with pleasure, his hips arching impossibly as he came, covering Harry’s chest with droplets of white that ran down Harry’s body with the spray of the shower only to be dragged down the swirling drain.
Quickly Draco nodded, sipping the warm, soothing drink again. “Sorry, I just…I forgot.” He murmured lamely.
Harry nodded and took out a second vial, inspecting its swirls of pink glitter suspended in purple. "This one is too girly..." he made a face and put the vial back, picking up the last one.
But surely Harry would still remember him, remember their time here together, Draco told himself time and time again. Yes, the Gryffindor would no longer need his blood, but couldn’t they still be like this? Couldn’t they still be together? It made Draco’s chest ache, the thought of losing Harry forever, losing the man he never knew he needed but who completed him like no one else even would. But he acted like everything was fine; putting on a mask he was so practiced at wearing. It would do no good to concern Harry.
That got the desired reaction from the vampire and a low growl rumbled up through Harry’s chest. “And just
Outside in the corridor a blonde man stood next to a very dark haired man. Both had been partaking in a rather enjoyable time with the other when they had rounded a bend and heard quite disturbing noises coming from the wall that they now faced. Snape furrowed his brow, listening, while Lucius sneakily tried to place his hand in Snape's.
Blaise sneered and pushed off of the wall. "Do you know what'll happen if the chocolates are mixed?" he asked. Draco shrugged. "Of course you don't, and I bet you don't even care." Blaise drawled, cracking a smile. "Potter could go crazy for all we know and all you would care about is getting your revenge." Draco smiled at him.
“Yes, because that’s all you really cared about with Potter: shagging.” Blaise snorted with an easy roll of his eyes, gently rubbing Draco’s back. “You know it was more than that. You liked the specky git, though Merlin knows why.” He smiled down at his best friend. “Hell, you even stopped messing around with me just to make him happy. You wouldn’t do that for just anyone.” He pointed out wisely.
“Two days.” The Death Eater reported, bowing his head low, the torch-light shimmering over the layer of grease that coated his hair. “In two days Dumbledore will release Potter, allowing him to travel with the rest of the students to Hogsmeade. That will be your chance, My Lord.”
“What, together?” Harry snorted, smirking at Draco’s startled expression. “He was my prey, not my lover.” He hummed, licking his lips at the memory. “Merlin, he tasted so good…like red wine. But you, you my sweet Draco, you will taste like Ambrosia, of that I’m sure.”
It took a few moments for Harry to speak, and when he did his voice was low, choosing each word carefully as his eyes flicked over Draco’s form. “We could…go together? Save…time?” he offered, an eyebrow arched almost hopefully.
Draco nodded in understanding, going to his trunk to grab his pajamas. “Your friends and I talked today, remember them? Ron and Hermione?”
It took Draco several moments to notice the silence that surrounded him; too long. He froze in his tracks, realizing his mistake. Silencing spells, he could feel them now. Swallowing hard, Draco slowly drew his wand from his pocket and gripped it tightly, ready to fight and defend himself if the occasion arrived. He looked around, ears pricked and ready for any sound. But there were no noises from the dark, and even his footsteps made no sound within the deep confines of the spell. He took a few more steps before he paused, finally making something out through the muffled silence.
Draco shook his head. “You seem fine to me, Potter. And I’ll be there just in case anything happens.”
“Oh…so much has happened in your absence, Dray.” Blaise smirked widely, settling back in the couch so that Draco’s head was resting on his chest, his fingers still stroking lightly through his hair. “Let’s see… Theo and Daphne have gotten together. Apparently Pansy and Goyle may have something going on, though Pansy claims it’s just physical. We all know the truth, though. You can see it when they look at each other, it’s nauseating how in love they are.” He paused, thinking over what else Draco needed to know now, before he could hear it from other sources.
“Meddlesome old coot.” Draco muttered, shaking his head as he retreated back to his window. The sun was just breaking through the early morning clouds, starting to melt away the swirling blanket of fog. Looking out over the grounds Draco frowned as movement caught his eye. Was that…
Draco sighed, shaking his head. Seamus was wrong, he wouldn’t be seeing Harry again. And even if he did, it’s not like it would change anything. Finding his mother in the crowd again, Draco quickly hurried over to her, giving her a tight, if quick, hug. “Hello mum.”
“Mr. Potter?” the woman said softly, looking over her shoulder into the hall before quickly slipping into the room and closing the door behind her.
But then Harry was talking again, pulling Draco from his thoughts. “It’s just…I’m drinking from your hand, so far from your heart.” The vampire tentatively nuzzled Draco’s neck before pulling away the moment he felt Draco stiffen in fright. “Severus, he said the closer to your heart the more potent the blood, and… the better it would feel for you.” He explained softly. “And…I would only have to feed once a day from your neck.”
Draco glared at Harry, trying to ignore just how hot the boy looked with that smirk plastered across his lips. "That's none of your business, Potter." he spat.
Inside Harry, the power and strength of each creature were fighting those of the others (most of them natural born enemies) for dominance in Harry’s body. The blood of the Vampire quickly consumed the Undead virus, feeding off of Harry’s magical power. Although Vampires are born of blood, their power comes from that of the wizard. Therefore, the more powerful the wizard, the faster the infection would spread. That was the second mistake that Voldemort made.
Spluttering, Draco found himself without words, unable to answer the Vampire’s silky questions. He couldn’t admit that. He couldn’t admit that he
Just like that Draco’s world came crashing down around him and he finally felt it; the deep loneliness he’d managed to keep hidden from himself. He had plenty of admirers, yes, plenty of people who would love to have a night with him. But that was all it was, one night. He couldn’t find anyone who would stay, anyone who he
“Harry.” Harry corrected him automatically, leaning down to lick and suck at one of Draco’s nipples. The blonde hissed in pleasure, chest arching up in a search for more.
“But Harry…” Draco breathed, gathering enough courage to gently cup Harry’s chin in his hand. “You’ll die without me.”
, his body sang, writhing and pressing against the body above his, wanting it with everything he had.
For a couple long minutes Draco was silent, still trying to understand just what Harry was saying. The vampire wanted him, and not just for one night? He felt his chest become warm again at the thought and he slowly nodded. “Yes, that…that’s okay. You were right, I have been waiting for someone, I just never thought I’d have him.”
“What if I hurt someone?” Harry asked nervously, toying with the fraying hem of his shirt. “How do they know I won’t drain someone dry?”
Harry never got to hear the end of that sentence because suddenly he found himself attached to an armful of blonde, who seemed to be intent on snogging the living daylights out of him. And of course, in his highly drugged state (he had stupidly eaten another three chocolates since he entered the room), Harry really didn't mind this at all.
“Shhhh, my mate.” Harry cooed, reverence held in every syllable. “I’ll take care of you.” He promised, dipping his head to start undoing the blonde’s pants before he frowned, ears perking up. There it was again, a hurried knocking coming from their front door.
Draco’s eyes widened and he pressed his face to the glass, hardly able to believe his eyes as the rolling waves of fog parted in front of the figure. He was walking slowly up the path from the front gate, unruly hair and bright green eyes unmistakable, even from a distance. But what made Draco gasp and jump to his feet wasn’t Harry’s return, but the skull, a length of spine still attached, that hung by his side, held limp by his hand.
Suddenly a bright red rose tied with a black ribbon appeared on the table before Harry. Harry picked it up and seconds later the bell rang. To everyone's surprise Snape leaped from his desk and sprinted out of the classroom before anyone had moved.
Finally Harry got to the very last present--a small box wrapped in silver and green with a thin black ribbon tied around it and forming a very intricate bow on top.
A soft growl left Draco’s lips and he grabbed Harry roughly by the chin, making the vampire look at him. “And I won’t leave ever again.” He promised, knowing he’d regret those words later but saying them anyways.  Anything to make Harry drink so he wouldn’t die. “Now drink!” he ordered with a low growl.
Noticing Draco's slightly dazed look and still hands, Harry took his momentary distraction as an opportunity to get the Slytherin's shirt of and his pants undone, although he waited to pull them down in favor of looking his prize over.
It was the perfect plan, of that the Dark Lord was certain. Nothing could go wrong. By the end, he would have a perfect weapon at his disposal. A weapon that not even the Order of the Phoenix could control or thwart.
With a sigh Draco started going through his things, trying to decide what was worth keeping and what could be tossed aside and forgotten. The trunk was almost full by the time Draco found it at the bottom of a drawer, stuffed there when Harry forgot and the sight of it caused too much pain. Draco looked at it for a few long moments, fingers running lightly over the thick, warm wool as he tried his best to keep the pain in his chest at bay.
As one the Death Eaters nodded, quickly disappearing to proceed to their task. They knew better than to fail their Lord and Master.
Behind him Draco could feel Harry hesitate before reluctantly pulling away. He listened to the creature’s receding footsteps until he heard the heavy thunk of Harry’s door shut behind him. “What is this about, Headmaster?” Draco asked warily, feeling strangely nervous now that the vampire was gone from his side.
As Draco approached the doors to the Hospital Wing his chest clenched, nerves tightening his throat. He quickly pushed the feelings away, trying to reassure himself. Everything was going to be fine. Harry was fine, Voldemort was dead, and everything would go back to normal. Everything would be all right.
But then the Irishman grinned again and laughed, winking at his boyfriend. "Ah but that would be telling." he said with another roguish grin. Ron threw a pillow at him, which Seamus easily ducked, and the group of boys got ready for the day.
“Mr. Potter!” the house elf squeaked. “You must come with me.” It smiled and took Harry’s hand. There was the feeling of transport and then…nothing.
Draco sighed as he walked down the streets of Diagon Alley, trying his hardest to ignore the overwhelming amount of pink, hearts, and flowers that decorated nearly every storefront. It wasn’t that he hated Valentine’s Day, per se; it was just… this particular Valentine’s Day. He loved the chocolate and gifts he was typically showered with on this day, mainly from his many admirers, but this year he just didn’t feel the normal excitement when he saw the large pile of presents.
Inspecting the different vials, Harry sighed. He couldn't differentiate any of them as potions he knew. "Which do you think I should take?" he asked Ron.
Harry frowned, jealousy flashing though his eyes. “You…you’re waiting for someone? I…you should have told me. Then…then I wouldn’t have…the claim, you can’t be with anyone else.” He admitted quietly, squeezing his eyes shut to ward off the pain of rejection.
"So you did it then?" Blaise asked when they reached the Entrance Hall, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed.
“You’re allowed to take your N.E.W.T.S late, right?” Hermione’s voice came from behind them and she slipped into the seat next to Harry. “I remember Dumbledore telling you the other day.”
“Alright, fine.” Harry finally conceded after a few moments of reluctant silence. “How far will you be?”
. By the third day Draco had locked himself in his and Harry’s room, refusing to come out for meals or let anyone inside. He curled up in bed, feeling sick to his stomach as the hours ticked away.
Just the thought made uncontrollable panic well up in Draco’s chest and he scrambled to the window, shaking as he curled up on the ledge and pressed his forehead to the glass, the cold against his skin ground him somewhat as he looked down at the gray grounds.
Harry grinned, fingers trailing up Draco’s chest to get started on his shirt buttons. “I was almost sorted into Slytherin, you know. Perhaps that’s where it comes from.” He explained softly, inhaling sharply as Draco’s naked chest was presented for his eyes to feast upon. “Mmm, so pretty.” Harry murmured to himself, fingers caressing over the blonde’s skin.
Draco shook his head. “Potter, you feeding from me was possibly the most erotic thing I’ve ever experienced. I’ve never come so hard in my life. The only requirement is that you continue feeding from me and never seduce another bloke into your bed, okay?
Finally the need to be closer to his mate became too much and Harry quietly crept from the confines of his room. He walked almost silently, shifting through the shadows the moonlight cast in Draco’s chambers. “Draco? Mate?” he cooed quietly, feeling Draco’s presence nearby. He peered into the sitting room and came face-to-face with his mate straddling another bloke and snogging him senseless.
“After many blood and magic tests, Severus has managed to identify the makeup of the virus inside of Harry. Using that makeup he has created a potion that can help suppress the creatures inside of Harry, making them go dormant. He’ll have to take the potion daily once it starts being effective, but besides that both of your lives will be able to go back to normal and you can put this nasty incident behind you.”
"Well it's just that I smelled that exact piece earlier. I thought it smelled like hair-gel, raspberries, bubble bath, and a flower carrier." Harry replied, a slight smirk dancing across his face.
Draco found himself appearing on something soft and covered in silk, with a heavy body on top of him and an answering hardness pressing against his groin. He looked up to find the Vampire leering at him, shifting so their hips rubbed together. Unable to stop the soft gasp from leaving his lips, Draco flushed at the pleased look that crossed Harry’s face.
“Because I’ll be there.” Draco answered gently, just as he had the last eight times Harry had asked the same exact questions. “And they must think you’re getting better.” He added before he winced, realizing that he had never exactly told Harry before that Dumbledore was trying to cure him.
He couldn’t help but wonder, sometimes, if Harry truly found him attractive, or if it was just the whole ‘mate’ thing. Yes, in the past few weeks after Dumbledore’s revelation the pair
Harry yawned, shifting in bed and turning to gaze adoringly at the sleeping blonde before him. He gently reached out, brushing Draco’s hair from where it fell in his face. Slowly the blonde stirred, blinking up at Harry for a few moments before a smile spread across his lips. “Hello, Harry.” He murmured.
Harry stood there for a moment before smirking slightly to himself as he watched Draco go. He was pretty sure by the slight wobble in Draco's legs that that kiss was as good for him as it was for Harry. Without another deep thought about what had happened (over thinking things could be dangerous), Harry went to potions. He had a gift giver to find.
Harry smirked. "I was doing some...research." he took out the box of vials and set it on the table, looking the note over again.
. With a sigh Draco got out of bed, going to the closet to get dressed for going out into the freezing drizzle that accompanied the gloom outside.
Draco was staring with an intense ferocity at Harry, mentally willing the brunette to eat the chocolate.
Harry’s cock had thickened and lengthened to such proportions that Draco was sure it would never in a hundred years fit inside him. What made Draco shudder the most, however, was the ridge of spines that descended from his pelvis down either side of Harry’s shaft to the tip. They looked incredibly painful and a glistening sheen seemed to cover Harry’s cock from root to tip.
Once the door closed behind him, Draco took a deep breath, trying to at least somewhat steady his nerves. He still jumped, however, as a voice slithered out from the darkness, wrapping itself around Draco. “Why have you come back?” Harry asked, voice low. Carefully Draco followed Harry’s voice and found the Vampire lying under the covers in the large bed. “You’re endangering yourself by coming here.”
"You're not very bright now are you, Potter. Eating chocolates from someone you didn't know. You're just lucky I didn't poison them." Malfoy drawled with a smirk.
Harry nodded, then opened his mouth to speak. "These chocolates really are quite a delight. You must eat one to see I'm not in a plight." he said, wincing mentally. Even in a drugged state he wasn't the best of rhymers.
“Yeah.” Harry nodded with a soft sigh. “I can, but I think I’m just going to take them and get it over with. I’ll have to go into further Auror training anyway, there’s no point staying at Hogwarts for an extra year.”
Harry flipped the note over and read the black words on the parchment. 'Ehem. Don't listen to a word the Weasel says. If you don't take any of the potions I will know and I won't be happy. (That's a threat, Potter) -WD' Harry's eyes widened, he felt like he recognized that phrase, but from where...
"No." Hermione said sternly before kissing him gently. "You KNOW Dean and Seamus are up there. You don't REALLY want to interrupt them do you?" she asked.
"Well," Draco said as they heard the sound of benches being pushed back in the Great Hall, "Time for Step 2." Blaise rolled his eyes with a sneer and nodded, following Draco down to the dungeons.
“Harry, he…” Draco let out another choking sob and it took several more minutes of Blaise rubbing his back until he was able to try again. “Harry f-forgot. He forgot…me.”
Smirking, Harry got on his knees and dragged Draco's trousers down as well, licking his lips. "Yes, let's."
Exams passed quickly and before Draco knew it his N.E.W.T.S were taken and it was time to pack up and head back home. He packed up his trunk slowly, taking his time as he looked around what were once his and Harry’s chambers, allowing his senses to absorb one final memory of the place.
Draco grinned as he saw the owl bring Harry the box of chocolates and the note he had written. Hopefully the Gryffindor would eat the right ones and Draco would get his reward by the end of the day. Draco managed to pry Pansy off of him and motioned Blaise to follow him out of the Great Hall.
Harry snapped out of his trance of staring at Draco's lips and scowled. "Of course I can. The real question is if you can handle it." he almost growled before suddenly pulling Draco against him and capturing his lips in a forceful, demanding kiss.
When the hunger disappeared Harry pulled back, licking gently over Draco’s skin to heal the vicious wound. He frowned as he noticed Draco had passed out, his mug of hot chocolate shattered on the floor. His frown deepened as he shifted slightly against the other young man and felt a hardness pressing against his leg. He sighed softly as he noticed the remarkable bulge in Draco’s trousers, restraining himself as he remembered what the potions professor had said about drinking closer to Draco’s heart. Harry would not hurt his mate, would not give into his repressed desire, until the other allowed it. Even if that time was never.
Draco didn’t return to the Vampire’s lair until the next night, and even then he was practically dragged there by Dumbledore and Snape. Dumbledore had discovered Draco’s lack of cooperation when Draco had not gone to Madam Pomfrey for blood replenishing potion and when Snape had gone to take his daily sample of Harry’s blood. This time Dumbledore would personally ensure that such an incident would not happen again. The headmaster stopped outside of Harry’s room and turned to look at Draco. “Now Mr. Malfoy, I realize that you’re scared. However, you agreed to give Mr. Potter your blood and that is what you must do.”
“Bullshit.” Ron exclaimed the moment Draco had finished his story, shaking his head. “Why should we believe that you’re Harry’s mate? You two have hated each other since the moment you met.”
Eventually, catching Granger once again glaring daggers across the Great Hall at him, a look that would have sent anyone else running to the hills, but not Draco Malfoy, Draco decided to put an end to all the nonsense. He got up, his progress across the Great Hall followed by several sets of surprised eyes, stopping in front of a wide-eyed Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. “May I help you, Granger?” he asked pleasantly.
Harry shook his head and pressed a secretive finger to his lips. "I want to know for certain first."
For a few long moments of shocked silence Draco gaped at Snape. “Why?” he finally breathed. “Why would he do that?”
Unable to disobey a direct order from his mate, and certainly not one that held so much conviction, Harry nodded. He gently nuzzled Draco’s neck, inhaling his scent. Carefully he bit into his skin, forcing himself to drink slowly and deeply, refusing to hurt Draco though the other creatures inside of him craved destruction. Long before he had sated his thirst, Harry pulled back, licking over the wound.
"Of course I am." Draco huffed, eyeing the vials and Harry wearily. He looked up again. "So...how are we going to get out from this? I apologize, but I don't want to spend the rest of my life trapped on your bed."
“Yes.” Draco repeated, looking up into the dark eyes of the vampire above him. “You can have me, however you would like. Claim me, make me yours, just fill the emptiness inside me.”
Draco snickered, shaking his head. “The only cock I’m gagging for is Potter’s.” he quipped before his expression sobered as he remembered that that was no longer an option.
Outside Draco sighed, running a hand through his hair as he tried to decide what to do. He’d go to class, talk with his friends. He’d act normal, as though nothing had happened and everything was right with the world. And then maybe, just maybe, he’d decide to pay Harry a visit, if he didn’t force himself to forget about the vampire completely. Dumbledore rarely came to check on either of them and, even if he did, Draco knew with some strange certainty that Harry would rather lie to the headmaster than let Draco get in trouble. The vampire adored Draco and it made him want to be sick.
"I thought so." Harry grinned mischievously and pressed close to Draco. "That was sneaky, Malfoy, very sneaky.
“Go!” Draco shouted, sliding around to Harry’s front so the vampire would focus on him instead of Blaise. Not needing telling twice, the other Slytherin scurried out the door. Sighing in relief now that his friend was safe, Draco looked up at Harry and felt his blood freeze in his veins. Harry looked angry…no, he looked more than angry. He looked downright pissed. “Harry…” Draco started, trying to come up with a reasonable explanation, but Harry cut him off.
Harry blinked, quickly moving back from Draco and lowering his gaze. “Sorry.” He mumbled. “You just…look so cute when you’re sleeping.” He admitted softly.
. His hands scrambled for purchase in Draco’s wet locks, finally managing to twist through them almost painfully and grab hold as Draco licked and sucked his way down his shaft. Never before had the vampire felt something as good as what Draco was doing to him with lips, tongue, and teeth, and the pleasure coursing through him seemed to sear all the way down to his DNA. Within moments there was heat coiling within the pit of his stomach and he tugged sharply on Draco’s hair in warning, trying to pull the blonde off.
Huffing in frustration, Draco fixed his hair in the bathroom before stepping out into the sitting room to meet Harry. Well, he’d just have to bring it up that afternoon, then. He’d make sure the Vampire knew that Draco Malfoy wanted to belong to Harry Potter. Forever.
Draco paled a bit. "S-so what if I did?" he tried to spit out but his voice was slightly shaky. He folded his arms across his chest as a protection mechanism. "So, are you going to help me or not?" he tried for petulant.
To Draco, the Dark Lord’s newest plan to take down Potter seemed rather foolish. After all, if he had Potter in his clutches why on earth would he return him to Hogwarts? Draco, of course, had spoken to his father of these concerns, who then explained the Dark Lord’s reasoning. Killing Potter alone would not be enough to gain Voldemort the world. First he must destroy the Golden Boy’s image, eradicating all support for him. Otherwise Potter’s death would do nothing; the others would still fight against him. Voldemort would also gain something else that Potter’s death would never bring him: a weapon.
“I’ve been wanting this for so long.” Harry murmured, looking down at Draco with adoration clear on his face. “Ever since I saw you in those magazines I’ve wanted to touch you, to taste you. Will you give me that?” he asked, surprising himself by the question. He’d never asked his prey before if they would let him feed, he just did. Then again, he’d never known the others, or wanted them as much as he wanted Draco.
When Madam Pomfrey found him Draco hadn’t moved from his spot, still lost in thought and half asleep from the exhaustion of his ordeal. Instead of lecturing him about not coming to see her, the medi-witch had simply found him some clothes, helped him to his feet, and supported him as they went up to the hospital wing, and for that Draco would be eternally grateful. Only a few murmured words were exchanged between the two as Madam Pomfrey helped him settle on the bed and gave him his potion.
The Slytherin sighed and nodded, looking a bit sheepish. "Yeah, I sent you the present." he mumbled, flushing brightly.
Draco arched an eyebrow at the pause, tilting his head up to look at Blaise. “And what about you, my dear Blaise?” he smiled coyly. “Have you met someone to replace me in my unfortunate absence.”
Draco groaned, rubbing his eyes. This couldn’t be happening to him, not now that he thought he’d finally gotten this whole ‘mate’ thing under control.
When Draco awoke it was to a soft, melodious voice crooning in his ear as a comforting warmth pressed against his back and a gentle hand stroked him. Once his brain registered exactly where that hand was, however, Draco’s eyes flew open and he started squirming. “No! Get off!”
The young body beneath him was panting and whining, writhing with something that was certainly not pain. The Incubus inside of Harry awoke, coming alive as it fed off the other’s pleasure. He needed the man and he needed him now.
“I will come.” Harry agreed with a nod, tongue grazing over his fangs as he followed the Death Eater. He remained calm as they approached the ballroom, Harry Potter slipping back into the shadows as the creatures that were within him burst forth, tasting the air. They stopped outside of a pair of heavy oak doors and Harry could
Taking a deep breath, Draco nodded and approached the darkness of the room, stepping just inside. A purring sound came from the blackness and Harry carefully approached Draco. “Harry?” the blonde asked, voice timid and scared.
“Italy.” Blaise answered vaguely, gesturing with a hand through the air. “My parents want me to start…studying my father’s work."
Draco raced towards the Slytherin common room, trying his best to keep the tears that threatened to overwhelm him at bay. He was a Malfoy, after all, and Malfoy’s don’t cry.
After a few moments Draco nodded. “Of course, though I can’t guarantee he’ll remember you. And it may take some time before he’s stable enough to be around other people. Blaise was over and Harry almost ripped his throat out.” He admitted sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. “The Dark Lord wanted to turn Harry into a monster, a weapon of Darkness for his own sick purposes. We’re not yet sure which creatures are dormant within him, nor how much of Harry actually survived the infection.”
“I can make you feel better.” The vampire practically purred, licking his lips in a way Draco supposed was meant to be seductive, but which he found to be rather terrifying. “I can make all the pain go away.” He continued, shifting until he was in a crouching position, ready to pounce.
“The Dark Lord wants you.” The Death Eater in the doorway announced, trying not to flinch at Harry paused in his feeding from the body underneath him. The Vampire straightened, licking the blood from his lips as he gaze seemed to bore its way through the man’s mask.
After a few more bites Draco nodded. “All done.” He smiled a little, returning to his place on Harry’s lap and offering his neck. “It’s your turn to eat.” He said with a crooked smile.
“Exactly.” The Headmaster nodded again. “Hence why we needed to allow Voldemort to capture him. Voldemort would take him, thinking that Harry will be his little Dark pet to use, and Harry would finally have enough strength, power, and Darkness in him to destroy Voldemort once and for all.”
"Yes. And it almost cost me an arm to get it. Literally." Draco sighed. "Can I have the other potions back please?"
A small squeak left Draco's lips but he nodded quickly. Of course he wanted to go to the feast, he was missing his favorite double chocolate cream pudding. Perish the thought of missing THAT! "Of course I do." Draco spat, his fingers tripping over the front of Harry's pants and deftly pulling them down. "Now let's get this over with."
The blonde snorted, snatching his hand away from where Harry had been playing with his fingers. “Inconvenience? That’s what you’re calling this, Potter? This is so much more than just an inconvenience. You want to take my blood, the essence of my life!”
The wound Harry made was vicious, spurred on by his anger and need to posses the blonde screaming and writhing in pain beneath him. Finally Harry pulled back, giving the vicious bite mark a few licks so that it would scar stark and red over Draco’s perfect porcelain skin.
Draco panted as feeling crashed over him, spinning through and confusing his senses. There was pleasure, there was pain, and then something else entwining the two, making them one and the same. Draco craved more, loving the feeling of Harry’s firm heat filling and stretching him, but needing it deeper within himself. He bucked his hips down and moaned, hearing an answering noise of pleasure from the man lapping at his neck. He had expected the feeling of Harry drinking from him to hurt, but it was a dull ache, easily overwhelmed by the sparks of fire singing through his veins as his blood was pulled from his body. It was a heady feeling, making him dizzy when combined with the feel of Harry’s cock slipping in and out of him, butting his prostate ever stroke or two.
"Do you have to?" Lucius whined, pouting quite prettily. Snape scowled at him and nodded, which made Lucius pout even more.
Draco didn’t need telling twice and the moment he got out from under Harry he sprinted as best he could to the door, hurtling through it and closing it tight behind him. He leaned against it as dizziness from blood loss threatened to overwhelm him and black spots danced across his vision. Moments later there was a heavy thud and the sounds of snarling as Harry threw himself at the door, trying to get to Draco.
Draco swallowed hard, thinking back to Blaise and all the Slytherin knew. His friend hadn’t been the same since that night he came face to face with the vampire who had claimed Draco for himself. “And what… what do those rumors say?” he asked slowly, trying to keep his voice from wavering nervously.
Neville smiled in remembrance and hastily answered, describing in great detail. "Well, I got her a necklace and a flower hair band, a container of lime-green spinach-flavored bubbles, two bracelets covered in four-leaf live clover, a bottle of beetle-juice, and a glass of bubble bath." he said excitedly. Harry nodded to show he was paying attention. Really Harry was TRYING to pay attention to his dorm mate's ramblings, but his attention was stolen by a blonde haired Slytherin who was still not wearing the school's uniform and who seemed to be up to something.
Ron shook his head, burying it in her hair. "They're WAY too loud and I really don't want to know what they're doing with whatever it is Seamus got them." he mumbled.
That night, after finishing his homework late in the library, Draco returned to his chambers to find Harry sitting in his bed, propped up by pillows as he read a Potions book. “Evening, mate of mine.” The vampire murmured without looking up. It had unsettled Draco the first time he learned of Harry’s ability to feel his mate’s presence, but by now he was used to it, though Harry occasionally still surprised him by what he could sense of the other boy.
picture.” Harry hummed, hand leaving Draco’s crotch to tweak and tug at a nipple, eliciting another hiss of pleasure from the man beneath him. “I’ve always had a particular weakness for blondes. A craving, I suppose you could call it. I blame you for that influence.” He chuckled softly, licking his lips. “Now tell me,
Of course, as soon as he left the compartment he ran into none other than Harry Potter himself. At the sight of the brunette Draco paled, the scar on his forearm burning and making him gasp softly in pain. Before him, Harry arched an eyebrow, a bemused half smile upon his lips. “Malfoy.” He nodded slightly to the blonde before he brushed passed him, the remainder of the Golden Trio in tow, and disappeared off the train and onto the platform.
“I haven’t claimed you yet.” Harry murmured, eyes raking over Draco’s bare chest with ill-concealed appreciation. Just the sight and smell of his mate made the creatures within Harry go crazy. “But if it will remind you of who you belong to, then I have no other choice.” He breathed, dipping his head down.
Dumbledore sighed, looking behind him where Severus and McGonagall stood quietly, observing the altercation. “Severus, do you think you could explain this to Mr. Malfoy? I have contacts in the Order who I must inform about this incident. Minerva, if you could explain to Mr. Malfoy the arrangements that will be made that would be excellent. Good day.” He smiled and nodded to them before sweeping out.
A few long minutes passed and Draco stared at Harry in complete disbelief. The vampire didn’t think Draco found him attractive?! Harry must still be as thick as he was in human form. Slowly, a wide smirk spread over Draco’s lips as he had an idea, one befitting or a true and dastardly Slytherin. “You’re right, Harry.” Draco said, his eyes glinting as Harry’s head snapped up to look at him, an expression of pure anguish written across the brunette’s face. “However…” Draco continued, “I’ve still taken blokes a lot uglier than you to bed with me. It doesn’t matter who’s sucking my cock, as long as I’m horny enough.” He finished, returning to the bed and stretching out languidly with his arms above his head so that Harry could witness every distinctive curve of his body, including the hardness still quite apparent at his groin. Draco had a problem and by Merlin he was going to do something about it.
The place where Harry’s teeth pierced his flesh was cold, the blood racing to that spot deliciously hot in comparison. The sensation made him dizzy, his head swimming as he felt himself react unbidden to the stimulation. A dark blush warmed his skin and Draco was grateful for the darkness and shadows of the room. He shifted slightly, the desire to touch himself overwhelming as the pleasure built and built. But then, almost moments from climax, Harry pulled away, licking over the wounds in Draco’s neck.
Lucius struggled for a few long moments, weighing the consequences of Potter dying to what would happen if word got out that it was his son’s fault that the Savior was dead. Eventually Lucius relented. “Very well, Headmaster, Draco will stay in the castle. I expect this situation to be handled quickly and quietly, and I want a daily report on Draco’s health so I know that Potter is not mistreating him.”
“He is.” Draco cut her off, shaking his head. He heaved a sigh before starting to explain everything that had happened in the months since Harry had seemingly vanished from his friend’s eyes.
"What the-" Draco squawked as he rough hand pulled him into a darkened alcove. "Fucking hell!" he yelped as he came face-to-face with the emerald eyes of one Harry Potter.
"What sort of person are you looking for, Potter?" Draco asked, making Harry look at him in confusion. "Wait, don't tell me: medium height, well defined torso, blonde hair, grey eyes, best body you've ever laid eyes on." Draco looked at Harry with horror in his eyes, who looked back at the grey eyes in shock. This WAS NOT happening! But yes, dear readers, this most definitely WAS happening.
Spinning around, Draco raised his wand, pointing it straight at the man who had seemingly just appeared, leaning against a store wall at the entrance to an alley. “What do you want?” he growled, something about the man making the hairs at the back of his neck prickle. The man just looked at him, the upper half of his face in shadows, before Draco caught a flash of white. He shuddered as he realized what he’d seen: fangs.
“Oh dear,” Harry murmured, shying even more away from Draco. “You had better go.” But Draco’s eyes had slipped shut and he seemed to not have heard, instead feeling oddly and completely at peace. A low growl rumbled from Harry’s throat as hunger swept through him, making him tremble with desire. “Go!” Harry shouted, finally getting Draco’s attention.
The little girl let out an "Eep!" and fled from the scene as Draco swore under his breath and looked at the sopping state of his robes. Harry watched happily as Draco ripped said robes off and vanished them. To Harry's great joy the Slytherin seemed to wear only a black tight fitted tank top under his robes along with a plain, crisp white button down shirt, which was also soaked through with juice.
For a few moments Draco just stared at the vampire, his angry expression gradually softening. Then he smacked Harry’s arm. “You’re an idiot, you know that?” he grumbled. “What were you planning on doing, just drinking once a day until you passed out or died from malnutrition and starvation? Do you know what will happen to me if you die? Don’t you care about me, Potter?!” By the end of his rant Draco was almost shouting, his breath coming in pants and his heartbeat pounding in his ears.
“Hmmm, what?” Draco murmured sleepily, blinking up at Harry in surprise with rather glazed and clouded eyes. Slowly they cleared and Draco frowned. “What…what was that?”
Once again, later that morning on his way to lunch, Harry was found walking along an empty corridor. There he came upon Draco Malfoy standing awkwardly in the middle of the hall, alone. Immediately Harry glanced up and saw, exactly as he had expected, a bunch of mistletoe.
“I’m tired, Potter.” Draco finally said. “Can I go now?” he asked, though he was almost positive the vampire would never reject his wishes.
Draco nodded a little, sipping at his hot chocolate before he held out his wrists for Harry. “We might as well get this over with, then. I can tell you’re dying to taste it again.”
Another smirk flicked across Harry's lips and he glanced up at the mistletoe. "Do you think kissing will work this time?"
On the other side Draco let out a breath, sagging down to his knees as the full scale of what he had learned hit him like a pile of bricks. He let out a soft sob, curling up in a tight ball. When this had all started Draco thought it would never end, that he’d be stuck like this forever. Now he leaned that wasn’t the case, and…Draco realized it wasn’t what he wanted. He should be ecstatic that he would be free, but instead all Draco could feel was a cold emptiness spreading through his chest, centered on his heart.
"Malfoy's?!" Ron's eyes widened. "That's ridiculous!" he snatched up the note and his eyes widened. "Merlin, it is!"
At that Draco rolled his eyes, letting go of Harry’s wrist and dropping to his knees so he was level with Harry’s crotch. “Don’t be an idiot, Potter.” He muttered, flicking his tongue out to lightly lick a drop of pre-come from the tip, eliciting a sharp intake of breath from Harry. “You deserve to come too, you sodding Gryffindor.” He hissed in irritation before taking Harry in his mouth and down his throat in one go.
For a few moments Draco just gaped at Harry from his position on the floor before his world went crumbling down around his ears. Harry forgot. Harry got better and…and forgot him. That was the only explanation. Swallowing hard, Draco stood on shaky legs, tugging his shirt down over the mark of Harry’s claim on is arm, the scar tingling unpleasantly.
The vampire shook his head. “With your blood I will live.” He murmured, neglecting to mention that without his mate he would most likely go into withdrawal and kill himself through bodily neglect. If Draco would be happier without him then Harry would let him go.
At that Ron snorted, shaking his head in disbelief. “Like we’re going to believe that.” He muttered scathingly. “That’s even more ridiculous than the rumors that have been flying around the school.”
The woman’s shoulders relaxed slightly at Harry admission and she slinked close to him. “Tonight the Dark Lord will call for you.” She murmured softly. “There will be a gathering where he expects you, Dark creature that you are, to swear loyalty to him.” She paused, eyes bright as she looked Harry over with a nod. “You’ll be able to get close…I trust the Incubus is well fed?”
Draco frowned, his own anger flaring in his chest. “I don’t belong to anyone, Potter!” he snapped. “You don’t
By the time Draco removed the offending shirt Harry was almost drooling over the sight of said Slytherin practically stripping two tables away.
Draco hurried over to sit by his friends and Harry just barely caught his eye. The Slytherin's cheeks blushed red and he quickly looked away as Harry smirked knowingly. Harry turned back to Ron and Hermione. "It definitely wasn't from Malfoy. Maybe another Slytherin was trying to set him up." he told them firmly.
A frown spread across Harry’s lips and his brow furrowed. “But I already…” he trailed off in confusion.
There was a lengthy, drawn-out pause as Draco thought before he slowly, hesitantly, shook his head “No. Maybe…maybe some time you can even share my room?” he offered haltingly. “I mean, you must be craving closer contact than just my blood, right?”
Contained in this box are three very different potions. One will make you mine forever, one will make all your wildest dreams come true, and the last will make the nighttime even more spectacular. Choose wisely, love, I look forward to your final decision. ~ WD'
.” The voice purred and Draco jolted as he felt something hard press against his thigh. “Scared, Malfoy?”
"Ahh, what a beautiful winter morning." Draco sighed happily as he sat in his seat at the Slytherin table. Both Blaise and Pansy arched an eyebrow as they slid into spots across from him and looked up to see a dark grey ceiling that threatened snow.
Seamus whistled, winking at Draco, impressed. “You’ll do well, Malfoy. And don’t worry about Harry. You two will see each other again, it’s not over.” He finished cryptically before giving Draco a jaunty wave and pulling Blaise into the swarming crowd of parents and students. Within moments they were gone.
to stay. So they would fuck, they would leave, and Draco would pretend that he didn’t feel the emptiness. That the emptiness didn’t hurt. That he didn’t need anyone.
"Oh god." Draco muttered, looking horrified. Harry just grinned at him like Christmas had come early and he had been elected as the most awesome person ever to live.
In his mind Draco was panicking, but he made sure his exterior stayed cool and collected. "Actually, no. That doesn't sound familiar." he forced a drawl from his lips. "Perhaps it was from some other conniving Slytherin."
For a few moments the pair stayed that way; Harry panting as he tried not to collapse into post-orgasmic bliss, and Draco happily drinking him down and suckling on the head of Harry’s cock. Finally Draco pulled away, licking his lips as he stood and smirked at Harry. “Good?”
"And...what makes it so wonderful, Draco dear?" Pansy said carefully, ready to bolt if Draco started smiling. "Did you get any good presents?"
Harry dropped into the chair across from Draco before he looked over at his mate skeptically. “And why, pray tell me, was it necessary to spend a fortune on me?”
“There’s enough Harry Potter left in me to stop from doing that, yes.” The dark haired man nodded, setting his book on the nightstand and rolling over to look at Draco, tentatively reaching out to brush his hair from his forehead with the tips of his fingers. “But you’re not afraid of me, or the Incubus that resides deep within me, taking advantage of you as you sleep?” he asked curiously.
Draco was quite stunned for a couple of seconds before he pushed Harry away, his knees almost feeling weak. Almost, but not quite. "That should have done it, Potter." he smirked slightly and turned on his heel, stalking away when what he really wanted to do was push that Gryffindor up against a wall and snog the living daylights out of him. Well...maybe later. "And if you tell ANYONE about this I'll kill you!" he called over his shoulder before rounding a corner and out of Harry's line of sight.
"No." Draco drawled with a small gulp. "I had Blaise fill them. A few with aphrodisiac, a few with Veritaserum, and the rest with whatever the hell he wanted. I just hope he knew I meant fruit or chocolate fillings..." Draco trailed off. He picked up a small rosebud-shaped milk chocolate and sniffed it. "Hmmmm, it doesn't seem too dangerous. Smells of raspberry, chocolate, and..." he inhaled deeply, "whipped cream." then he popped the whole entire thing in his mouth, chewed, and swallowed.
“Very much, yes.” Harry breathed, his warm breath ghosting over Draco’s flesh, making the boy shiver. His tongue shot out, licking lightly over a patch of skin before ever so gently sinking his fangs in. Harry couldn’t help but moan as Draco’s blood blossomed across his tongue, the taste as heavenly as every time he fed, filling his senses completely.
Draco was in a complete and utter panic. Harry was missing. Harry was missing and yet no one seemed overly concerned. He was reassured time and time again that this was normal, that Harry would some times disappear for some alone time. Like Harry Potter would ever just up and disappear in the middle of their date!
A bright smile spread across Harry’s face and the young Vampire leaped out of bed, scrambling to get suitably naked. He joined Draco in the shower moments later, wrapping his arms around his chest and pulling the blonde close. “You’re so pretty.” He murmured, nuzzling Draco’s sweet smelling, pale neck.
The Gryffindor chuckled almost darkly and Draco cursed the shiver that ran down his back. "I could help you, Malfoy. Everyone's going to the feast, no one will come down here to help you." he moved within the mistletoe's radius. "All I need is for you to answer one simple question."
I did.” He murmured, hand leaving Draco’s throat entirely to grip Draco’s hips. “I’ve been watching you, you know.” Harry purred throatily, head dipping to nuzzle at Draco’s neck, making the blonde stiffen. “You take so many men into your bed…but the never stay. Why is that? Are you…waiting for someone?”
"Oh Harry." Ron interrupted the dark haired boy's train of thought as he caught sight of the box. "Have you figured out who gave that to you yet?"
"Well it looks like you'll have to take one after all." Ron sighed, picking up one of the vials and looking at the thick clear liquid in it. "Don't drink this one, it looks too much like hair gel."
. He liked how it felt when Harry fed, had even come to crave the sensation, really. But most of all, Draco liked feeling safe, knowing that the vampire would protect Draco from any harm, no matter what.
"OR," Hermione added with a smile. "He's already found the mystery sender and he's snogging the daylights out of her.
At long last, hours later, Harry was sated and he collapsed down on the bed, gathering Liam in his arms. The teen had passed out a while ago, his human body too weak to keep up with a woefully neglected Incubus. Harry sighed softly, feeling fuller than he ever had since he turned. He snuggled up to the warm body next to him, closing his eyes with a contented hum. Within moments he was asleep.
To Draco’s surprise the Headmaster just laughed, easily brushing off Draco’s anger. “My dear boy I would, but alas it is not my blood that Harry needs, but yours. Now go on, and once you’re done you must go to Madam Pomfrey so that she can check you over. If you don’t, I will know.”
Draco, still cussing under his breath, chanced a glance up at the Gryffindor's table and his eyes immediately locked onto Harry. To Draco's amusement the boy was practically gaping at him, his eyes once-overing him every five seconds or so. Things were going better than planned.
A part of him wanted to see Harry one last time before they went their own, separate ways, but the other part of him feared the pain it would inevitably bring. When the train finally jolted to a stop at the station Draco took a deep breath, gathering his courage as he grabbed his baggage. No matter what happened he would stay strong, cool, and collected. Whether or not he saw Harry, he wouldn’t let the pain get the better of him. He wouldn’t show weakness.
“Are you sure he’s not up to something?” Harry asked his best friend, squinting across the hall at a shocking head of blonde hair. Several weeks had passed since the “Draco Malfoy incident” as Harry was wont to call the Slytherin’s dramatic entrance and equally dramatic exit from the Hospital Wing.
And yet, despite all of that, something was missing from his life. He’d never really noticed it before, the emptiness. Not until that fateful day with the equally fateful headline. Not until that day he saw the picture of Harry Potter pushed against a wall and being thoroughly ravished by another bloke. Another bloke with striking blonde hair.
“I think we need to talk in private.” Draco suggested calmly, nodding to the eyes on them as he snagged a cookie from their table. “Come on, then.” He smirked, swaggering slightly as he exited the Great Hall, two perplexed Gryffindors following a distance behind them. The Slytherin led them to a small courtyard, sitting down on a bench and gesturing for them to sit across the path from him. “Now, ask away.”
The headmaster shook his head, expression still calm. “As of yet we do not know exactly what Harry is, Mr. Malfoy, but I can assure you that the situation is completely under control. We have Mr. Potter locked in a room warded for all the creatures that he may have been infected with.”
“Sh-should I go in there?” A voice—Draco’s—asked in fear. The sound was music to Harry’s ears and he could feel the hunger surge within him, wanting to break free.
“I don’t like prey that runs.” The man told him, a tongue flicking against the shell of his ear. “Especially not prey that’s as pretty as you. I’ve seen the pictures, the ones in the …special magazines.” Draco stiffened and he felt hot breath snicker against his neck. “I must say…you look
The vampire sighed, looking down as he nodded. “I…I should have asked you first, I know, but I…I just couldn’t help myself. I’ve wanted you for so long, wanted you to be
Mr. Potter had just taken the first bite of his Mickey Mouse Waffle when the post arrived, carrying with it multiple packages all brightly wrapped in various shades of a garish pink. A ferocious looking black owl swooped down and sat in front of Harry, carrying with it a heart-shaped package as well as a note. After delivering its items the owl hooted and flew off out of the Great Hall.
A low, feral growl erupted from Harry’s throat and he launched himself over the back of the couch and pulled Draco away from the other bloke. There was a shout of fear and surprise and behind Harry Draco gawked at him. Harry was crouched down on all fours, his teeth bared at Blaise, who had sat up, startled, on the couch. “What were you doing with my mate?!” Harry snarled.
There was a knock on the door to Draco and Harry’s quarters early in the morning on the fourth day of Harry’s disappearance. So early that the sun had yet to break over the horizon, turning the dismal gray night into the light of dawn.
"Oh." Neville said, seemingly disappointed. "I thought it was probably from one of your million fangirls wanting to have your first born child." he said wistfully. "Well have you eaten them yet?"
A burst of power rushed from him and the doors splintered, exploding in a cloud of wood and dust as Harry strode forwards. “Ah, my pet.” A voice slithered out from the front of the room, wrapping around Harry in a slickly slime of pure evil. “I see you have come to join us. Please, come closer. I’d like to see you for myself, in all your glory.”
Draco let out a breathy moan as the vampire captured his lips in a hard kiss, fingers working to divest him of his robes and trousers. Within minutes Draco was completely naked, spread out underneath the other man for his gaze to devour. “Please.” He whispered, his cock hard and throbbing, yearning for any touch Harry might give him. “I need…”
With that Harry leapt at her, claws raking along her throat. Bellatrix screamed and struggled, but no one dared come to her aid. “Lucius!” she screamed, eyes pleading as Harry’s hands wrapped around her throat. “Lucius please!”
"I think a better question would be who sent them." Ron said, looking at the note suspiciously. He felt like he knew that handwriting...
The door of the hospital wing burst open and Draco jumped, sitting up to see his father striding through the doorway with Severus, Dumbledore, and McGonagall hot on his heels. “I’m sorry, Mr. Malfoy, but we cannot allow you to do this. Draco leaving the school at this time would be preposterous and uncalled for.” Dumbledore was saying calmly as Lucius stalked over to Draco’s side.
“Can’t say.” Draco smirked, his stomach coiling in what he determined to most definitely be thrilling anticipation. “I’ve lost count.”
A smirk spread over Harry’s lips as he reached a hand out to play with a few strands of soft, blonde hair. “I can be an even
A dark frown crossed the Vampire’s plump lips and he took hold of Draco’s wrist, tugging him over to a chair. “What are you afraid of?” he asked softly, almost breathlessly. “I will not hurt you, I must only take what is mine, what I need to survive.” He sat down in the chair next to Draco’s and squinted slightly in the soft light of the fire. “I am sorry for any inconvenience this will cause you, Draco. I really am.”
With one hand Harry pushed out his power, knocking them all to the floor, as his claws tore easily through Voldemort’s skin and muscles, bone splintering with the force of his strength. The Dark Lord let out a gurgling sound as Harry’s claws reached his heart, squeezing and brutally crushing it. There was a scream of pain and rage as the light faded from the Dark Lord’s eyes, never to spark again. Harry looked up, withdrawing his hand from the ragged wound in Voldemort’s chest, to see Bellatrix’s wand pointing at his face, trembling with her fury.
“Mmm, I didn’t think you’d come back.” Harry murmured, his voice reverberating and low. He nuzzled Draco’s neck and inhaled, moaning softly at the scent of Draco’s blood racing through his veins. “You smell so good.” He murmured, gently pulling Draco over to the armchairs by the fire.
Slowly Draco nodded, settling back against the pillows of his bed. “Yes, Headmaster. Umm…what about the Incubus?” he asked, trying to mask his anger and hurt with curiosity. His father had written him off, just like that. The very idea of the family name being tarnished and his father had signed him off to be some Vampire’s plaything. Expected, yes, but it stung nonetheless. “You said P-Potter has Incubus in him as well. What effects will that have?”
“Which is quite frankly ridiculous.” Ron supplied helpfully in the heavy silence that followed Hermione’s revelation.
"Farther?" Harry asked apprehensively, resisting the urge to just pounce on the Slytherin right then and there.
There were a few long moments of silence as Draco thought over what Harry had said as he grabbed his wand and cast a cleaning charm on his pants. Potter might not have actually touched his skin, but he still felt rather violated that the vampire had seen him in his most intimate, vulnerable state. Finally Draco sighed, rubbing his eyes. He didn’t have enough energy to deal with this vampire ordeal anymore. All he wanted to do was go back to his normal life and forget about the monster that thought he was his mate. Forget about the feeling and sight of his blood passing between the other boy’s lips.
Draco bit his lip, squirming a little. “But…but what Dumbledore said about me being Potter’s intended...why? Why would
“Voldemort.” The vampire hissed, his voice filled with venom and a deep, dark hatred. “He’s the one who made me like this, the one who made you my mate.”
“Your professors have informed me that you’ve once again stopped going to class.” Dumbledore answered sternly, though Draco could pick out the touch of concern in his voice. The old man regarded him over the top of his spectacles for a few moments before he continued. “I have come to assure you that Harry is perfectly fine. He is in no danger.”
“Mmm, so you’re awake.” A voice murmured close to his ear and Draco nearly jumped, rolling over with a groan, his body protesting the sudden movement, to look at the dark haired man lying beside him.
“What makes you think he’s up to something?” Ron asked curiously before taking another large mouthful of his pot pie.
The Vampire, on the other hand, was a nervous wreck from the moment Draco told him the news. Nothing Draco did seemed to reassure Harry that everything was going to be fine.
Harry's eyes widened and he forced himself not to jump for joy. "We...have to kiss?" he asked slowly, his gaze already flicking down to Draco's lips.
The Incubus smirked as he saw Draco’s gaze, his sharp nails making quick work of Draco’s boxers. The humming had stopped and Draco whimpered under the creature’s hungry stare. “N-no!” Draco whimpered, shuddering as Harry flipped him over onto his back, finger sliding to pull his arse cheeks apart. “Please don’t!”
Draco jumped as the door slowly creaked closed behind him and arms wrapped around his waist, a strong, muscular chest pressing up against his back. “Mmm, they told me you would come,” a dark, soft voice purred in his ear. “But I wasn’t sure…they could have lied.” A pair of gentle lips dragged across the base of Draco’s neck and he shuddered.
Panic welling in his chest, Draco’s eyes darted over to Ron and Hermione, standing on the other side of Harry’s bed. The look of pity on the two Gryffindor’s faces was what finally broke Draco. Without another look at Harry Draco ducked his head and sprinted out of the Hospital Wing, the doors slamming closed behind him.
They continued their activities and soon the room was filled with many moans and groans. Yes, they were playing scrabble. Just kidding, but you can probably figure it out. I still have great faith in you thinking abilities.
Draco glanced at the clock, his eyes widening. “A little over an hour. We’ve overslept.” He swore quietly, jumping out of bed moments later. “You want to shower first, or should I?”
All too soon Harry was pulling away and licking over the place where he had bitten, face devoid of the usual content expression he wore after feeding. “Goodnight…mate.” The vampire said softly before he rose smoothly and slunk away to his chambers.
Draco looked at the box as if deciding if Harry was playing a trick on him or not. He nodded absentmindedly and considered which to choose. "You did fill them yourself, correct? If so you should know which ones to reject." Harry stated, smiling as he saw the flicker of fear on Draco's face. If Harry was correct then Draco had absolutely no idea what was in any of the chocolates, but by now there was no turning back.
A smirk slipped across Harry’s lips as he stepped forwards. “Yes, they will all die.” He hissed. He took another step forwards and Voldemort’s eyes widened imperceptibly before Harry’s hand thrust forwards, pushing through his chest. Blood splattered against his robes and behind him the other Death Eater’s shouted spells, trying in vein to take him down.
"I know what he got her!" our boy Harry crowed. "I saw him hiding it under his bed. Of course he got her the normal jewelry and all that, but he also got her a can of whipped cream, a pair of purple sparkly handcuffs, and a gallon of chocolate sauce." Harry finished to the shouts of laughter from the other boys.
For a few moments Harry could only stare at Draco’s back, his mind warring furiously as he tried to decide how best to respond. The truth, or what the blonde wanted to hear? “I…” Harry started, swallowing hard. “Yes.” He finally, reluctantly admitted. “Eventually.”
"I see..." Draco trailed off with a sneer and a glint in his eye. He snapped his fingers and the candles around the room lit. To Harry's surprise they were in quite a large room that contained nothing but a bed draped in white and silver, what appeared to be a bathtub sunk into the floor, and a random coffee table. Harry cocked an eyebrow in confusion, not daring to speak for fear of what might come out. Draco shrugged. "I don’t know, I mean, I GUESS it IS Valentine's Day after all.
The question caught Draco off guard and he took a few moments to ponder it. “I…I guess I just thought he wanted to kill him creatively.” Draco shrugged. “I mean, I’ve figured out by now that the original plan was to make me Harry’s mate and then whisk me away from Hogwarts so that he would pine away and die…but…” he trailed off as a thought hit him and his eyes went wide. “Except Vampires don’t die without their mates. They get sick, yes, but as long as they have some sort of human blood they’ll get better. But without their mate they’re ruthless and destructive. Pure evil.” His eyes went even wider. “A weapon.” He breathed, knowing he was right by the amused twinkling in Dumbledore’s eyes. “The Dark Lord wanted to make Harry into a weapon. A weapon for him to use.”
"Now, now Lucius." Snape said, pushing the blonde off of him. "That'll have to wait for later, I have a class full of sodding Gryffindors and your son to get to."
Immediately the memory of Harry drinking his blood flashed through his mind, the thoughts spreading warmth through his body. After a few moments Draco shook his head with a frown, trying to rid himself of the thoughts. Yes, the blood sucking hadn’t been overly terrible, but that didn’t mean he wanted to do it again, right?
For a few moments Draco could only blink at Harry in confusion. “Oh.” He finally intoned, a frown crossing his lips. “And if I were to keep it unlocked…” he started slowly, “you wouldn’t hurt me, right? Or-or let
Both men jumped and looked at each other in horror as the moans, groans, and swears turned into very loud shouts of "Oh god, POTTER!" and "Merlin, DRACO!". Both of the former Slytherins took off running down the hall. They finally stopped running when they were at the opposite end of the school, and when Lucius had dragged Snape into an abandoned classroom and locked the door.
Outside the door Ron and Hermione winced as they heard Draco cry out in ecstasy. Ron turned to his friend, looking a bit green. "I hate when you're right."
The gaggle of teenage boys made their way down to the Great Hall, picking up a few giggling females along the way, one of which was of course Hermione Granger. Upon arrival to the Great Hall the first thing that hit Harry was the sheer amount of pink, purple, and frills that seemed to have attacked the Hall overnight. At first Harry thought that perhaps Professor Lockhart had returned from the dead, but then he noticed Snape's for once washed hair and decided that that was probably not it. The second thing that Harry noticed was that Dumbledore had on a nice pair of Light-Lavender robes that complimented his beard nicely, and the third thing was that there was a man with pretty long blond hair tied back in a pink ribbon currently sitting next to Snape, and, if Harry was not mistaken, seemed to be holding onto the potion master's hand under the table. The fourth thing that Harry noticed was that a pair of silver eyes were staring at him from the Slytherin table and that the owner of the eyes was not wearing the schools uniform, which Harry found rather odd.
Taking a long swig, the alcohol burning down his throat deliciously, a wide smile broke across Draco’s lips. “You always know just what I need, Blaise.”
“Yes.” Draco nodded with a small smile, picking up his trunk again. As he turned to follow Narcissa he caught a flash of dark hair and striking emerald eyes. Draco froze in his tracks, starring as Harry joined the Weasley family, plus Remus and Tonks, laughing brightly at something one of the twins had said. As if he could feel Draco’s eyes on him, Harry turned, locking gazes with the blonde.
Swallowing, Draco found his mouth suddenly dry and it took him several moments to try and answer. “I…I’m ok-kay,” he murmured, biting his lip as he glanced across the room at the door again. “I’m actually not sure why I’m here, Headmaster.”
The Vampire nodded and shifted closer so he could reach Draco’s hand, not even noticing as the blankets slipped precariously low on his hips. He ran his lips lightly over Draco’s skin as his fangs descended. Moments later he sank his teeth into the tender flesh of Draco’s wrist.
"Of course I'm stupid, god dammit!" Harry yelled. "Now tell me why you're playing this shit!" Harry gasped again, eyes bulging. "I didn't mean to say that!" he gasped. "I wanted to hold my tongue like a cat." again Harry's eyes got even wider after he uttered that phrase.
Draco laughed. "You never should have trusted that note, Potter. Especially not after the part about yourself, strawberries, and whipped cream. I was going to go into detail, you see, but then I thought that Saint Potter would be too innocent for words such as those." he said with a leer.
