“Idiot” he chuckled and accio’d the lube from the bedside drawer. He much preferred it over a spell. It was part of the Weasley twin’s new adult range, this tube had a slight warming spell in it, no more cold lube where it shouldn’t be.
Draco knew he was rambling but honesty he couldn't care less. He had never had a lover like Harry, even for their first time, he was, as promised, making Draco lose his mind. That wicked mouth doing amazing things to his cock, even taking the whole thing to the base and, sweet Merlin, those wicked fingers, stretching him wide and teasing his sweet spot. “Harry fuck, can’t, need, too.” The only signal Draco got that it was fine to let go was Harry taking him even deeper. It was all too much and with a shout, Draco came, flooding Harry’s mouth and gasping as if he had run a mile. The feeling of Harry’s throat squeezing his sensitive cock as he swallowed his release was almost too much but before Draco could say a word, Harry was on his knees at the base of the bed, pushing Draco’s legs out of the way and resting the head of his own cock against Draco’s entrance.
Draco wrapped his hand around Harry’s length. He filled Draco’s hand, long enough to poke through the other end and thick. Draco’s mouth watered just thinking about being impaled on that monster. It had been a while but Draco was determined to get his wish before the night was over.
“You’d be doing what?” Harry snapped. The combination of alcohol and lust swirling in his belly made him bolder. Looking Draco in the eye, Harry deliberately swept his gaze down Draco’s, over the small flat nipples—the left one pierced by a small rose-gold serpent, the flat abdomen, front of those sinfully tight leather trousers. Honestly, Harry had never seen anything as sexy in his life.
The only sound in the room for quite some time was of eight adults devouring Seamus’ cooking. It didn’t take long until they were all sopping up the juices with hunks of bread and groaning with full bellies.
It was remarkably comfortable, small, but warm and dry, which was all either man cared about right now. After being out in the elements, frostbite and hypothermia were both very real concerns. Pulling his wand, Draco started a fire in the fireplace as Harry looked through the small kitchen. Plenty of tinned provisions and thank Merlin there was a kettle.
“He’d look best in dark colours I think,” Harry said trying to get his body to behave. He was far too old to be getting a hard on in public, no matter the provocation.
, the door creaked open; the exhausted men stumbled inside and stowed their skis in the hall cupboard.
“You can tell them that at Sunday lunch, and don’t bother arguing, you will be attending with me, not right now, but one day,” Harry told him forcefully, to Draco’s slight shudder. There was something about being ordered about that clearly his body enjoyed.
“Yes Potter, I’m gay,” Draco took a step forward, instinctively Harry took one back. Back and forth, until Harry’s back pressed against the door, and Draco sported a far too familiar smirk.
Harry was just as speechless, the only noise in the cabin was the storm still howling outside and the crackling fire. Harry wasn’t even sure if he was breathing. He couldn’t take his eyes of the gorgeous blond man underneath him. Draco’s thighs felt solid beneath Harry’s and his hair just that little bit messed. Exactly what Harry had sometimes thought Draco would look like after a night of solid lovemaking. Hell, even debauched fucking would be fine right about now. Harry’s body had well and truly woken up and he was struggling to get his arousal under control.
“Fred’s fine, driving George mad in the shop but he survived the Battle. The spell knocked him out for a while and he was a bit dazed for a couple of days but he’s totally fine. Loves to scare his nieces and nephews with that story for Halloween.” Harry held Draco closer as he felt him physically relax in his arms.
’, he couldn’t help but think too busy kissing the man beneath him to bother removing them.
“I was fit to murder you at first,” Harry admitted getting to his feet. “Changed my mind though,” he again pulled each twin into a rough hug. Besides Ron, who would always be his best friend, Harry was closest to these two.
Pushing open the door Harry was rewarded with the sight of his bed and tugged Draco over to it. Pushing him onto the soft bedding and tugging the blankets from under him. Draco offered no assistance as Harry manhandled him under the covers. In fact, the rotten sod was grinning.
“No idea but…” Draco showed Harry the tag. He turned to glare at the twins, who just smirked in return.
“Oh yes, you do not want both Molly and Arthur Weasley annoyed with you, take my word for it. Neither of us wanted a huge wedding, so it was in the paddock behind The Burrow. Still, even with just the Weasley clan and our friends, it was big enough. James made his entrance a week before my twenty-fourth birthday. Albus and Lily followed soon after.”
Watching over his shoulder, Draco was captivated by the look of pure lust and concentration on Harry’s face as he drove Draco out of his mind. Clearly, he was watching his body slide easily into Draco, driving him closer and closer to losing control. Looking up Harry caught his gaze and grinned.
“It won’t take much at that rate but I want my reward too.”
“In tight leather pants!” George added, and Harry’s face flushed at the provocative image that popped into mind. His friends immediately picked up on it, and the teasing was ramped up higher.
He had never seen anything as gorgeous as the sight of Draco Malfoy shamelessly enjoying his lovemaking, no his fucking, Harry corrected himself. This wasn’t love, it was just pure lust, that was all.
“No, I want to ride you. Here, or upstairs.” His words made Draco’s brain short circuit. He’d not been on the giving end in a long time. Not that he had anything against it but it just hadn’t worked out that way.
“Well, I think I should come clean,” Harry scratched the back of his neck, trying to work out how to explain the situation. It wasn’t every day that a man found himself in the frankly bizarre case of buying lingerie for his current boyfriend, from said boyfriend’s former girlfriend.
The last few years had been hard. Professionally, Draco was at the top of his profession, he was often asked to consult on various cases at other Wizarding hospitals. He was developing a range of potions to help cure Dragon-Pox among other things.  Personally, his life was a mess. Divorced, part-time father to a son he hardly knew and trying to manoeuvre his way around the adult dating scene which was not working out at all.
“Owlbert Einstein?” Draco asked puzzled, “What sort of name is that?”
“Best Christmas present ever” he heard Harry whisper in his ear as he collapsed onto Draco’s chest, both panting and gasping at the over stimulation.
Winking up at Harry, Draco took him to the base again, before letting Harry’s cock fall from his mouth. Clearly, he was pleased with himself by the grin on his face.
However, his body didn’t seem to want to obey him, instead, he spent what seemed like hours, staring. Harry simply could not tear his gaze away from Draco.
“My mother taught me, in the kitchens at the Manor. The house-elves were very displeased but knew not to disobey the Lady of the Manor. I make a wicked shortbread too.” Draco admitted.
“No, it’s fine I get it. I do all I can to stay out of the papers. I don’t care if it's fundraising for the hospital or various charities, I’ve no shame in digging into my friend’s pockets for things like that, but my personal life is just that, personal. It was dragged through the papers enough during the divorce, enough is enough.” Draco raised his glass in salute.
“No chance of that happening,” Harry said raising his glass in salute. It was Draco’s turn to look puzzled. “I’m really not that into women, to be honest, and I’m not quite ready to explain to my 12-year-old daughter why there is a naked man in my bed, that conversation with the boys was embarrassing enough.” Draco choked on his Firewhisky.
“Stay there, eyes closed, I’ll go and get it,” after making sure Harry was obeying his orders, Draco rushed down the hallway to the study and checked on the little bird who gave him a happy little chirp. “Shhhh,” Draco put his fingers to his lips and carried the box through to the front room where Harry was waiting, eyes closed.
He’d always been far too captivated by Harry, ever since school if he was honest. The first few years had been in spite of Harry rejecting his friendship but by the third year, it had been his developing sexuality and all the confusion that came with that. By the fourth year, he’d been enjoying his fellow housemates, both the boys and the girls, and had never really stuck to one or the other, switching between lovers effortlessly. Beyond Blaise and Pansy with whom he’d hook up with whenever he was going through a dry spell, Draco hadn’t had a permanent partner for a while now. Maybe that was all about to change.
Harry had floo’d home after work, got changed and grabbed his bag. He had not been on skis in years and was really looking forward to it. It was one thing he could thank the Dursleys for. There was no way Vernon would have left him alone in Little Whinging. So they had been forced to take Harry on their yearly ski holidays with them and it had given him a type of freedom he had never felt before. Skiing was very nearly as good as flying. Grabbing his brand-new ski jacket, Harry zipped it up and after checking the address again, stepped into the floo and called out the name of the lodge, disappearing in a flash of bright green flames.
He walked over to see what Astoria was looking at and she grinned up at him showing him the boxed stockings.
“Fuck you are gorgeous,” Harry blurted out, unable to help it.
Breakfast was another formal, stuffy affair, but thankfully by eleven o’clock, they were finally flooing home with bags of presents and more food. Harry stripped out of what he was wearing and changed into tracksuit pants and his old Quidditch Jersey, and thankfully Draco had the kettle on for a decent cup of tea.
Draco had never been so turned on and frustrated before in his life. He badly wanted to come, unsure if he could continue to hold back.
“Honestly Potter, are you a wizard or not? How do you think bent wizards have been fucking before we discovered Muggle lube? The spell is
“Please what?” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear to his whole-body shudder. Gently Harry tugged his arm above Draco’s head and wrapped the red cords around his wrist and secured it around the bed head before checking the ropes were not too tight. Kissing Draco’s shoulder, Harry repeated the process on his other arm, so both stretched towards the bed head. The red ropes stark against the pale grey bedding, and Draco’s body stretched out for him to ravage. It was a sight Harry would never forget. Gryffindor red is his colour, Harry smirked at the thought.
would still crucify them, Rita Skeeter still had it out for Harry and Draco had also gained her wrath on more than one occasion, so this would be just the sort of thing she’d delight reporting on. Draco figured they deserved some small measure of happiness.
“Sorry for keeping you, how may I… oh hello Harry.” He spun at the voice, shocked to find Astoria Greengrass standing in front of him. She looked good in what was undoubtedly the uniform of the store; her blonde hair pulled back into a loose bun.
Harry’s roughness was exactly what Draco needed as he covered his stomach with his release, gasping through it and feeling like he had been in a Quidditch final. He was totally wrung out.
“I always envied you in school,” Harry whispered, “You were always so perfectly put together, even after a Quidditch match, you were perfect. I looked like a mess five minutes after crawling out of bed.”
All he did was stand there while she loaded his arms up with bits of satin and lace, she’d ponder over various things and put them back, adding more.
Harry leant forward until their foreheads were touching. Harry tried to get his wayward emotions under control. This was crazy. Until tonight he had not willingly told many people he was interested in men, yet in the space of a few hours, and a bottle of Firewhisky, he had unloaded all his secrets to Draco Malfoy, a boy he had actively fought against in the war, one he had very nearly killed.
“A heads up that Malfoy was going to be here this weekend would have been appreciated though, Gin!” Harry lightly scolded only to receive a cheeky grin. Even though they all got on far better now than when they were children, and he was Blaise’s best friend, who was engaged to his ex-wife, Harry still wasn’t sure if he put Malfoy himself the “
Instantly awake, Harry listened again for the strange noises that had woken him. A dull thud and some vague cursing drifted up from downstairs. He knew it wasn’t any of his guests; they’d all left earlier in the evening after celebrating Christmas at 12 Grimmauld Place. The house should have been empty. From the noises coming from downstairs, it wasn’t.
“I don’t care who my kids date or marry, so long as they are loved and treated well. I can hardly be a hypocrite and tell them no, now can I? I’ve hardly put myself out there since the divorce. Hermione nags me about it, but hell, dating is hard enough at the best of times, add my past into the mix and the
’, get a grip.” Draco glared at himself trying to will back the haughty Malfoy mask, wanting to armour himself somehow before taking a deep breath. Renewed and determined not to succumb to Harry bloody Potter of all people, Draco pulled open the door and headed back to the living room.
“You alright?” he asked concerned. Harry knew he probably should have been gentler, he knew from previous lovers that he tended to get a little carried away but Draco didn’t seem to mind by the look on his face. Tiredly he nodded.
Draco was not one for public displays of affection, hell neither of them were. Two damaged boys, just trying to overcome shitty childhoods and move on from the war. However, Draco would do little things like this and Harry did not doubt how much his boyfriend loved him.
“Honestly, we have no idea, the third one Blaise thinks," she replied with a chuckle, throwing herself down on the bed. “I’m glad you could make it, Blaise does want the two of you to be friends.”
“I have a far better idea for this,” he said stroking it, “Fuck me, Potter, it’s my turn to see stars!” with that Draco flopped on his stomach beside Harry, spreading his legs and making himself quite comfortable.
“Oh, it has its moments, but they are pretty good kids and Molly and Arthur helped a lot. You never know, you may meet someone else and give Scorpius brothers and sisters.” Draco’s inelegant snort was so out of character, Harry nearly choked on his Firewhisky.
“You keep looking at me like that and I’m not going to last much longer,” Harry accused, he was riding the edge of losing control as it was. he had not corrected Draco’s assumption that he had not had sex in six years, more like six months, and he had been nothing like the gorgeous man under Harry now, although thinking back, Harry clearly had a type, fit tall blond men.
“I’m happy to keep it quiet from everyone else, but… I have to tell Scorpius,” Draco said quietly as if he expected an argument.
’ Draco wondered before his brain turned to mush. Eventually, the men had to pull apart due to a lack of oxygen. Harry ran his finger over Draco’s swollen lips and gave him a wicked grin.
“Scoot further up, I’ll fall off the bottom of the bed,” Harry ordered, manhandling Draco until he was where Harry wanted him. Getting comfortable between his spread legs, Harry couldn't help himself as he covered that delectable arse in kisses and nips, to Draco’s obvious approval by his low moans. Grinning wickedly to himself, Harry prised Draco’s cheeks open and blew a stream of warm air at his entrance, watching it twitch at the sensation.
“Well, anyone else and I could answer that, but you, I have no idea?” Harry replied, far more honest than he would have, had he been sober.
“Would you consider me dreadfully forward if I said I wanted to take full advantage of that big bed in the other room and ravish you?”
Harry looked up at his husband, who was wearing the same sad look as the baby owl.
Someone had left Draco Malfoy gift wrapped under his Christmas tree.
“No… um… we don’t… err… have any milk,” he stammered, licking his lips and trying to get his voice to work, “Is black tea alright?”
“Thank you,” Draco said kissing his cheek and giving him a potion, “I know they stress you.”
“I take it I’m staying?” he asked grinning at Harry cheekily.
“Where the hell do you think you’re going?” Draco grumbled as Harry walked over to the bed, dropped the towel that was slung around his hips and climbed in, taking off his glasses and dimming the light.
“No! don’t.”
“You want me to what?
“Well hello there,” he said quietly to the little bird who again chirped at him, slightly louder this time, as it hesitantly walked across the bottom of its cage and gave Draco a quizzical look. Immediately, Draco knew he’d found Harry’s new owl.
“Fuck Harry,” Draco gasped as Harry gripped his hips and dragged him closer, slipping in that last little bit until Draco could feel how close Harry was to him, balls deep in his arse and at that perfect angle that each thrust dragged the head of Harry’s cock over Draco’s prostate to his gasps and moans of pure pleasure.
“It's up to you if you want to wear them and yes, I did go a bit overboard, but I couldn’t choose.” Harry didn’t mention the number of items he’d put back. For someone who was showered with gifts as a child, and Harry often bought him silly little things, it still amazed him how carefully Draco always opened his presents.
“Well, if you were anyone else!” Draco threw Harry’s words back in his face.
“Come on, into the bath.” Draco steadied him as Harry stepped into the hot water, hissing at the heat and as his sore muscles relaxed. Dropping his head back onto the edge of the bath, Harry closed his eyes, letting the warmth seep into his bones as he listened to Draco tidying up in the other room. The faint murmur of Draco talking, probably telling Harry off, although he was doing a half-arsed job of it. Harry had been told off by experts, Draco was nowhere near in that league, he just used that damned disappointed look of his.
Breaking their connection Harry sat back and stared at the sexy man he was straddling. His heart was thumping and these ski pants were suddenly very uncomfortable. ‘
“My son’s birth dates and their constellations.” Harry had muttered dazedly as the potions had started to take effect. “James and Albus” he had finished on a pained gasp as his shoulder had slipped back into place. Draco knew from gossip that there was now a third date under the two boys, he could remember reading a birth announcement for a baby girl a few years ago.
Draco was long and thick and Harry desperately wanted to impale himself on that gorgeous cock but first, he needed Draco hard and ready. Harry had a couple of steady lovers but it was just physical, nothing more than that so he’d not been exactly celibate since his divorce, so Harry was more than confident about his ability to send Draco over the edge.
“No, just the kids’ constellations and birth dates. They were painful enough, thanks; I don’t need more. I’m surprised you remembered, although I think I only had the boys then, Lily Luna has been added to the mix since then.” Harry fumbled for his wallet in his discarded jacket and opened it, tugging out a capture and handing it to Draco. “James on the left, Albus on the right and of course Lily in the middle.” Draco looked down at three good-looking kids, clearly, the capture had been taken on Platform 9 3/4. “Lily’s first day at Hogwarts, she was so excited. That was nearly two years ago, James was in fifth year and Albus third.” The pride in his voice was clear.
on the table and the little owl hopped over to the bag and knocked it over. However, no treats fell out, much to his clear disgust evidenced by the loud squawk he directed at the bag. Which set both men chuckling. It seemed he didn’t much care for that either and his next squawk was directed at them.
Inadvertently they had started their own new tradition, sitting in the bath on Christmas night, drinking hot chocolate and chatting about the day.
* * * * *
“Come for me!” Draco ordered, surprisingly for Head Auror Harry loved being ordered around, well by Draco he did. By that little hitch in his breathing and the twitch of his cock, Draco knew his boyfriend was close to losing control.
Draco swiped his thumb over Harry’s cock head, smearing pre-come along its length and proceeded to stroke Harry in time to his thrusts. It was sensory overload and Draco knew he’d not last much longer. He’d love for them to come together but knew it was unlikely.
“I swear if any of my kids turn out like me, I’ll disown them,” he threatened to Draco’s snort of laughter.
Smirking, knowing he’s going to tease his husband mercilessly over this, Draco headed to the kitchen to start breakfast.
“Not bad so much as busy, spells backfired, and charms cast wrong. Potion poisoning. That sort of thing.” Draco sipped his tea, sighing in appreciation. “Healer Donovan floo called in sick, so we’re down as well.” Understaffed was an issue Harry knew well. They chatted about mundane things until Patricia stuck her head in the door.
“Now who’s being an idiot?” Draco grumbled to Harry’s grin. Catching his lips in a quick kiss Draco crawled out of bed and headed down the short hall to the bathroom.
“What the hell are you grinning about, Potter? We could be facing death.” Harry pulled a coin from his pocket and held it up to Draco’s inspection.
Harry had never been with such a vocal lover before but it was turning him on something fierce. There was something about being with someone who told you exactly what they wanted. Muttering the spell, Harry found his hand covered in a slippery lube and he easily slid two fingers into Draco’s passage to his guttural groan. Giving him time to adjust Harry started to finger fuck him in time to sucking on that gorgeous cock. It was thick and firm under his lips, he was forced to take it deeper as Draco could not keep his hips still, a sure-fire sign he was close to coming. Twisting his hand, Harry stroked his fingers over Draco’s prostate to his howl of pleasure.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hips to steady him, not sure he could manage much more right now at the incredible sensation of his cock slipping into Harry. He was tight and snug, the slippery lube easing the way, and Draco had to start reciting potions ingredients to get his body back under control.
“You’re so bloody bossy!” Draco complained, grinning, even though he knew Harry couldn’t see him. However, it was true, Harry was a bloody bossy lover and had the filthiest mouth Draco had ever come across, but fuck if that didn’t turn him on too. Draco would never have been able to guess, when they’d started dating, that Harry was the kinkiest man he’d ever dated. The filthy things he’d convinced Draco to do were numerous, and now it appeared ladies’ lingerie was next on that list. Draco knew without a shadow of a doubt he was going to wear those knickers for Harry, hell he’d even wear full Gryffindor robes if Harry asked.
Harry put the mugs down on the shelf around the edge of the bath, checked and water and added some bath oils. They would help with the aches and went to wake Draco.
Once the kitchen was cleaned up, Harry was damn sure Draco used every pan they had when it was his turn to cook. They settled down in the lounge room. Harry had his nose buried in a Quidditch magazine when he heard a muted shriek from their bedroom. Grinning, he tossed the magazine on the lounge and walked down the hall.
“How many ex-girlfriends do you have?” he asked genuinely curious. They’d both discussed their pasts. Ginny was a regular visitor to their flat, she and Draco often got into in-depth discussions about Quidditch.
Draco smirked into his tea, knowing his Valentine’s present this year had been very well chosen, despite any protests Harry had put up in the past. Owlbert wasn’t going anywhere.
Truthfully, Draco was more than a little jealous that Harry had been able to keep up such a civil relationship with his ex-wife. Draco could hardly even be in the same room as his without her creating a scene. Draco had tried, mostly for his parents and to carry on the Malfoy line, but he just could not do it. Their lovemaking had been pathetic at best, all he had wanted to do was get it over with. Though they both deserved more than a loveless charade.  So he had called an end to the marriage and Astoria had not taken it well, to say the least. But Draco was quite certain she was more in love with being the next Mrs Malfoy than she ever was with him.
“Come on, let's get all your things hidden away, your new owner will be home soon.” Draco put him up on his shoulder and walked into the study, the little owl making happy little chirpy noises. Draco enlarged the rest of the owl’s belongings and tucked them out of sight. He didn’t want Harry seeing them just yet.
“Draco please!” Harry whined, he needed to come too but being squished into the mattress there was no way he could get enough friction. However, Draco knew just how to fix that problem as he roughly rolled Harry over, dragged him to the edge of the mattress and as soon as his knees hit the carpet he had Harry’s cock down his throat, sucking him hard and easily shoved his fingers into Harry’s stretched, sopping hole. Harry came within seconds as soon as he felt Draco’s mouth on him and his fingers up his arse, stroking his prostate. “Fuck yes” was all he could manage before he came so hard Harry felt like he was about to black out.
“You’ll love the Weasley’s I promise you. The Burrow is always crowded and busy but smells amazing and is full of my favourite people. I’m not saying it will be easy, Draco.” Harry warned, “but hell we overcome a megalomaniac wanting to take over our world as children, dealing with our families should be easy after that - right?” Draco’s snort of laughter echoed around the room.
“Well, we have known each other since we were eleven, even if most of that was childhood arch enemies.” Draco’s drunken grin made Harry laugh.
“Dark blue maybe?” Astoria asked, holding one up to Harry’s nod. It had black lace at the top and bottom and dark blue ribbon is lacing it up through the middle and laces dangled from the bottom, for stockings Harry assumed.
“I always liked Fred and George, their pranks and clever ideas,” Draco admitted. He had never told anyone that he admired the Weasley twins. To be honest, he envied all of them, more than anything else he would have loved a sibling but it seemed that the Malfoy’s were destined to only have one child each generation.
At first, Harry couldn’t pinpoint the sound of the noise, as the room was quiet again but then he heard it, a low growl coming from the Christmas tree. Stepping further into the room Harry gasped as he located the reason for all the noise.
“Come here you!” Harry growled grabbing his hand and roughly dragged Draco back into his lap as the blonde wrapped his hand around their cocks, pumping them together to their mutual moans, spreading their pre-come to make the slide easier. The slight callouses on Draco’s wand hand adding extra stimulation.
“Sorry Malfoy, that is pretty lousy. Ginny and I have always been there for each other and the kids, I mean she has pretty much ordered them to my place more than once, particularly when she and Blaise first got together but no one is more important to me than my kids so I didn’t really mind. One reason I had to get a king-size bed, they have no idea of personal space.”
“Beautiful isn’t it?” Draco said quietly, startling Harry out of his musings.
“He’s still with a patient Harry, but he should be having a break soon if you’d like the wait?” The medi-witch on duty told him with a smile. Harry, like all the Auror’s, was well acquainted with St Mungo’s and he knew most of the medi-witches on duty.
Encouraged, Harry pushed in, the lube easing his way, although Draco still gasped at the stretch, squeezing his eyes closed at the sting. Immediately Harry stilled, not saying a word, or moving until Draco nodded, his eyes a dark stony grey as he roughly ordered, “Move,” to which Harry willingly obeyed.
“It goes this way,” he turned it around and held the elastic up against Draco’s waist. “The straps should go under the knickers, that way you can keep it on when I drag them off.” Harry wasn’t going to admit he’d been just as confused until Astoria had shown him how it was worn.
“Fuck Potter more,” he gasped as Harry determinately took him to the base, to his lusty groan of approval. Course Harry didn’t stay there long, much to Draco’s disappointment but then again, breathing was rather conducive to further enjoyment.
Creeping downstairs, avoiding the creaking tread on the third last step, he crept into the kitchen to find it empty, as was the dining room. A low moan caught Harry’s attention, and he crept towards the front room. Pushing the door open, he muttered nox, distinguishing his wand. Harry knew he knew he would not need it, not with the number of lights that decorated the Christmas tree.
“Ya not be wantin’ dat one Sir” Draco didn’t bother turning to face the man who had spoken, “Scrawny lil’ thing it is’, how ’bout a nice tawny owl instead?”
“It’s clear that you’re not totally against the idea?” Harry commented, lightly running his fingers over Draco’s ribbon-wrapped erection. He wasn’t fully hard but well on the way, so Harry decided to give him a helping hand as it were and reached down and tugged on the bow which unwrapped nicely leaving the remainder of the ribbons in place. I’ll thank Hermione for that later Harry thought, positive it was her doing.
Finally, Astoria had loaded him up to her satisfaction and led him over to a small sitting area and proceeded to rehang all the frilly things onto a rack, fussing over them until they were to her satisfaction.
“We need a name for you, don’t we?” Harry asked stroking the owl’s head, “He’s clever you say?” he asked to Draco’s nod. “I hope you got him some owl treats?” Harry couldn’t help his grin at Draco’s epic eye roll as he left the room, coming back with a bag of owl treats.
Draco could not tear his eyes away and Harry gracefully crawled down his body and started to tease him. Clearly, in a mood to take his time and really, trussed up like a Christmas turkey, there wasn’t much Draco could do about it.
Harry nudged open the bedroom door with his hip, careful not to spill the mugs of hot chocolate he was carrying and stopped, grinning, taking in the sight of Draco Malfoy in all his naked glory sprawled over his bed. Clearly, he still worked out, that was not the body of a banker, and Harry smirked at the oval-shaped bruises that decorated Draco’s hips. Carrying the mugs into the bathroom, he noted the bath was full. Spelling the water not to overflow was one of the more useful spells Hermione had taught him after one too many overflowing baths.
Draco loved listening to his boyfriend’s moans and gasps turned him on so much. Harry used to be so quiet, they both were really. The result of having discovered the joys of wanking in a dorm room with other boys. Sure, they all did it, but at that age, no one admitted to it. Now, however, Harry was a noisy bugger, not holding back his moans and groans, letting Draco hear his pleasure, gripping their joined hands hard, needing all the connection they could get.
“This is not going to be a habit, do you hear me?” of course his owl didn’t pay him any attention, having got what he wanted. “Spoiled brat” Harry muttered as he curled up on the lounge, pulling a blanket over them as the owl got comfortable in his lap, making soft little hoots as Harry petted him.
“You’re wearing far too many clothes,” Harry grumbled, tugging on the bottom of Draco’s jumper. “I need you naked, now!” he would have vanished Draco’s clothes, but he always got in trouble for doing it when he was horny, which of course was ridiculous, he only needed him naked was when he was horny.
“Fuck, I need you naked,” Harry whined, not caring how that sounded and with a wandless spell vanished the last of their clothing to their mutual moans. “Better?” he questioned, grinning at the look on Draco’s face.
“Come for me, I want to feel you fill me,” Harry whispered as he clenched around Draco’s girth. “Please?” that was all it took for Draco to start to move again, hard strong thrusts into the willing body above him.
“Oh yes, I’ve had a few “
“Merry Christmas Harry, we’d best get down before Molly sends someone up after us.” No one could open any presents until everyone was in the front room.
“Fuck!” Draco moaned, he’d never had anyone do this to him. Sure, he’d heard stories but none of his lovers had brought it up and how the hell would you ask someone to do that?
“Having fun?” Harry asked, stripping off his jumper and t-shirt, wiping his sweaty brow with it to Draco’s frown. “I don’t know why you bother; it's just briefs and boxers,” Harry said, snagging a pair and kissing his boyfriend. “I’m going for a shower I stink,” he stopped halfway to the bathroom and let his jeans and briefs drop to the carpet, to Draco’s growl of disapproval and Harry’s snort of laughter as he walked to the rest of the way to the bathroom naked.
“They are gorgeous, thank you,” Draco leaned over and kissed Harry on the cheek. “You do spoil me,” he fluttered his eyelashes at Harry to his bark of laughter.
Draco remembered reading the joint press statement the Potters had made confirming their separation; however, they were still committed to co-parenting their three children. That had been five years ago and besides Ginny being linked to every male Quidditch player in the European league, and her subsequent engagement to Draco’s best friend, Harry had not been linked to anyone. The only time he had graced
That look Harry gave him made Draco’s insides squirm in arousal, he had never wanted anything so badly as he did this. Ducking his head once more, Harry brought Draco back to full arousal in seconds, swallowing him to the base as he slid his fingers further back and traced them over the sensitive entrance to Draco’s body to his clear delight at his loud, unrestrained, moan.
Picking up the slightly more substantial package Draco also carefully unwrapped it to reveal the black satin knickers and the suspender belt, the satin was so soft, he could imagine wearing it. Holding up the suspender belt, he hoped he didn’t look as confused as he felt. It was a somewhat confusing array of straps.  Harry took it from him with a light laugh.
“Oh, come here,” Harry carefully opened the cage and lifted the little owl out. “You’re going to get me in trouble, do you know that?” Harry scolded but clearly, he wasn’t being taken seriously as his owl lightly nibbled on his fingers.
“My turn!” Harry growled in his ear and, gripping Draco’s hips hard, he lost any finesse he had and simply fucked into the compliant man beneath him, taking his pleasure. It wasn’t long until Harry was also losing control, flooding Draco’s body and collapsed on Draco’s back, gasping and trying to get his breath back.
Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s hair, gasping at the sensation of being right down his throat. “Fuck Potter,” he moaned unable to help himself. “That’s so good, more!”
“There’s no ice cream. I was just thinking how scandalised Scorpius would be, he can’t imagine a world without ice cream.”
“You have a milk moustache,” Harry laughed as Draco swiped his tongue over his upper lip, removing most of the froth.
“Do you… fuck… want me to pull… out?” Harry managed to choke out, he was so close to losing control. He hoped not, but it was polite to ask.
“Dean if you don’t hurry up and marry that man, I will!” Ron told him, to everyone’s laughter and a snort of disbelief from Hermione.
Taking control of the situation, Draco finally had Harry where he had wanted him for quite a while longer than he cared to admit. He was not going to let the moment pass. Draco tilted Harry’s chin and slowly brought their lips together. He felt Harry’s shocked intake of breath, but he didn’t pull away. Letting Draco explore his lips at his own pace and he was in no hurry. Who knew if he would get another chance, he was going to take advantage of all he possibly could. Draco wasn’t even in a huge hurry to deepen the kiss, happy just to feel Harry’s lips against him, the wonder as he hesitantly started to kiss him back.
“Have you thought of a name for him?” Draco called out from the kitchen.
“Not like I’m about to say no,” Draco snapped frustrated. “I’m close, get in me now!” but Harry shook his head.
* * * * *
Of course, Draco just mimicked Harry’s posture and glared right back. Not for the first time, Harry admitted, if only to himself, what an attractive man Draco had grown into. His black ski trousers fit him in all the right places, just tight enough to hint of the fitness of the man wearing them. A thick grey ski jacket brought out the silver of his eyes and a few stubborn flakes of snow clung to the blond tresses. Suddenly, the fact they only had one bed was far too tempting.
“I could hear you snoring from our room, come on out before you do catch a cold.” Harry was half tempted to stay there just to spite him. However, the smell of something good was wafting in from their room.
“I know that, Potter,” Draco snapped annoyed “However, there are two of us and only one bed, and I am not sleeping on the floor.” He shoved past Harry and walked back to the kitchen, pacing around the small cabin, clearly agitated.
Maybe ribbon wrapped was a better description as Draco’s whole body was wrapped in a thick, bright red, ribbon. It pinned his arms to his sides while crisscrossing his torso, in intricate knots, which wound down his body to end in a huge bow covering his privates.
“What are you doing in my room, Potter?” Draco asked sleepily, “You didn’t come clubbing with Blaise and me.” sitting up, Draco rubbed his eyes and looked around the bedroom. “This is not my room.”
“What is it?” Harry asked as soon as Draco sat back down, the box in his lap.
“Salazar you are fucking gorgeous like this.” Draco blurted out, not caring in the slightest about his confession, it was true. Harry was shamelessly taking his pleasure from Draco, gasping and moaning as he rocked his hips back and forward, his thigh muscles stained with the effort to slide up and down Draco’s cock. His dark hair was plastered to his head with sweat, both from his exertions and the warmth of the room and those green eyes fairly sizzled with lust. Draco was captivated, by the man riding him.
Even though they were stunning, Draco deliberately avoided the snowy owls. He knew that would bring back far too many painful memories of Hedwig.
has speculated on it enough times. That’s why I don’t date and never take anyone, except Ginny or Hermione, to any ministry function.”
“I’d say turnabout is fair play, however, I spend as little time with my parents as I possibly can.” He admitted, snuggling closer to Harry. “The constant disappointment is just too much. I often think they would have preferred me to be trapped in a miserable marriage than dare to divorce.”
“Now, you’re going to be quiet when I put you in this box,” Draco held it up for the little owl’s inspection. “I’ll put in some air holes and paper on the bottom for you.” The little guy hooted as if he understood what Draco wanted and hopped over to inspect the box as soon as Draco put him on the table. Draco crossed his arms over his chest and watched with amusement as the little bird inspected his surroundings. For now, he was just a bundle of baby feathers, but he’d grow into a beautiful bird within a few months. Draco was sure of it.
“Go on, get out and let us get dressed then,” Harry ordered his godson out of the room and tossed back the covers “hell it's freezing,” he pulled back the curtain and looked out. “You got your white Christmas,” he told Draco, who scurried over to hug his boyfriend.
“You’re overdressed Malfoy, strip!” Harry ordered in his Head Auror voice that normally had people jumping to obey. It was completely lost on Draco though, who even though he did start disrobing it was at a much slower pace as to what he had stripped Harry.
“Like this, fuck me into the mattress Potter!” Draco ordered, rather surprised how steady his voice was as he most definitely did not feel steady. It felt like his world had been spun off its axis, honestly it had felt off-kilter since Blaise had slipped him that obviously spiked drink. He’d get his so-called best friend back for that later, not sure if he could curse him for it or buy him that ridiculously expensive bottle of Thousand-Year-Old Ogden's Firewhisky that Blaise had been coveting for years. It wasn’t as if the cheap bastard couldn’t afford it himself.
“You have no idea,” Harry replied grinning himself as he ground against Draco to the other man’s moan. Harry hadn’t fooled around like this for ages, the feel of a fit muscular body under his hands, a hard cock rubbing alongside his own. Bliss.
By the time they’d finished Harry had racked up a bill of over one hundred galleons to her delight.
“Ready. When. You. Are,” Draco panted, in return, honestly, he was rather amazed his brain was still working as his body had completely shut down, it was running on pure sensation right now. “Fuck Harry please,” he couldn’t help his whine of frustrated pleasure. This is what he had always missed, the raw pleasure of being fucked. Astoria was far too much of a prude for Draco to bring up what he really craved. As much as he regretted his marriage, Draco adored his son, so something good did come out of it.
Early Saturday afternoon found Draco putting away washing, not one of his favourite jobs but still preferable to de-gnoming Molly Weasley’s garden, which is what Harry found himself doing. Tugging open their underwear drawer, he shook his head, typically Harry’s half of the drawer was a tangled mess, tipping the lot out on the bed Draco set to tidying it again. He would happily admit he was a bit of a neat freak, as Harry liked to call him, but honestly, his boyfriend was a slob. Sitting on the bed, Draco started re-folding the underwear yet again.
“It's beautiful, so soft,” Draco said stroking the satin. Harry picked up one of the square boxes. “These go with it.” He didn’t want to come off as pushy about it, but Draco had seemed to enjoy dressing up as much as Harry had. Taking the package Draco unwrapped it to reveal the stockings.
“Yep,” he stammered on a gasp, his whole-body shuddering in pleasure. “But we can discuss it much later.”
“You are so damn gorgeous, miles of pale skin and sheer red knickers, I’ll never forget this sight as long as I live,” Harry finally started to move, slow to begin with, he wanted this to last. He gripped Draco’s hips, there would be bruises later and started to move, letting Draco feel every inch, relishing in his gasps and moans. Harry was aware Draco knew the spell to undo the ropes if he chose to. It was entirely up to him. Harry also knew he loved to be tied down on occasion.
Draco just nodded, not about to admit he had been hiding in the bathroom like a scared First Year.
” had paid off, and they’d had enough. Blaise had threatened this for years but Draco had never thought he’d really go ahead and do it.
They fit perfectly, he’d never doubted that and felt somewhat strange, very different from men’s underwear but beautifully so. The elastic was tight around his waist, but the soft silk skimmed his body, so sheer he could see his hard cock tenting the front of them. Reaching down to stroke it, he couldn’t prevent his low moan; he’d never felt anything like it in his life. Caressing himself through the sheer soft silk, Draco didn’t hear the floo roar to life or Harry’s voice floating through the flat.
“More!” was all Draco could manage, his body was no longer his own, he wholly belonged to Harry. There was something very freeing about handing over his pleasure into Harry’s hands. He’d been shocked the first time Blaise had brought up being tied down and used, Draco had been sure it would have triggered his anxiety attacks. However, Harry had been willing to try it, and the first few attempts had not been the best. Strangely enough, it had been Blaise that had helped them. As he was Draco’s best friend, he’d expected it to be incredibly awkward, but he’d keep it clinical, and they’d all be dressed. He’d taught them to accept the ropes and to give themselves up to the feeling of being taken care of. Before that Draco had just seen it as his freedom being taken away from him, now he relished handing all control over to Harry.
“Their brains too thankfully,” Harry said with a chuckle, “But they are great kids and have handled the divorce pretty well. Ginny and I both have an open-door policy; the kids live where they choose. So far, it has worked pretty well although I often have kids sitting down for breakfast who were not there for dinner. You have a son, don’t you?”
“I don’t see you complaining too loudly,” Draco said boldly, dropping his gaze to the hard bulge now straining against the front of Harry’s pants. Tugging on the drawstring, they loosened enough that Draco could push them down to get his hands on Harry’s stiffening cock and slowly stroke it. He grinned at Harry’s low moan as he let his head fall back against the lounge back, allowing his boyfriend to take full advantage. Grabbing his wand, Draco closed the floo, they’d nearly been interrupted before, and he was in no mood to cut their afternoon lovemaking session short. Roughly manhandling his lover, Draco dragged his tracksuit pants off and tugged the jersey over his head, leaving Harry a rumbled mess. Grinning wickedly, he spread his legs further, lewdly sprawled over the lounge and winked at him.
Dropping his watch, glasses, and wand on the bedside table, Harry pulled back the covers and jumped into bed, only to scramble straight back out.
Harry couldn’t remember exactly how he had ended up with an invitation to one of Blaise’s ex-stepfather’s ski lodges in the Scottish Highlands for a weekend skiing. He was not entirely sure which stepfather the lodge belonged to, but according to Ginny, it was impressive. Ten bedrooms, huge fireplaces, chef’s kitchen, underground cellar, the place apparently had it all.
“Well, I’m not saying no, if you’re offering!” Harry smirked, stroking himself, making his cock jerk to his touch.  Not saying a word, Draco grabbed him, he’d tease Harry later about his very girlish squawk, and pushed him onto his back on the bed. Sprawled in naked abandon against dark blue sheets, Draco was hit with a bolt of lust. It was probably a good idea that they’d not hooked up in school, Draco had no doubt his grades would have suffered terribly. Unable to contain his smirk, he could just imagine telling old Lucius the reason his grades were slipping.
“Fuck!” Draco gasped as Harry slid all the way in. He’d not been so full for far too long. He’d forgotten just how bloody good this was. Buffeted between Harry’s strong hard body and the soft mattress, there was nowhere else he wanted to be. None of his other lovers had brought Draco to such a height of sensation so fast. Harry had him teetering on the edge of orgasm and kept him there, at the perfect angle to nudge against his prostate on each thrust, the pleasure building with each strong thrust.
“I envied you too,” Draco whispered, not wanting to break the quiet. “You succeeded at everything you did, had good secure friends you could rely on.” ‘
“Oh, shut the hell up, Malfoy,” Harry grumbled, which of course had no effect, except to make Draco laugh harder. “I’ll fucking hex you again in a minute.” Harry staggered to his feet and walked a very crooked line over to where Draco was still laughing his fool head off. Harry had meant to drop down on the soft couch beside the blond who had finally managed to sit up. However, Harry misjudged the distance and ended up collapsing into Draco’s lap instead.
Blearily Harry looked at his alarm clock. It was 3:15 am, and he had no idea what had woken him. He had just started to drift off again when he heard it. A sad little hoot echoed through the flat. Trying to ignore it, hoping it was only the once. It came again. The saddest sound Harry had ever heard, and it was breaking his heart. Silently cursing his husband, and not wanting to wake said husband, Harry carefully climbed out of his warm bed, snatched up his flannel pants from the floor and dragged a t-shirt over his head as he padded down the hallway to the spare room.
Grumbling to himself, George pushed aside the curtain and disappeared behind it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Good?” he needlessly asked to Draco’s nod, right now speech was beyond him.
” and “
“Oi!” Harry broke into Draco’s musings “You were offering!” he said nodding to where he was stroking his cock and grinning up at Draco with a look of pure mischief on his face.
“Oh, shut up,” Harry grumbled, knowing he was not going to live this down in a hurry. “Owlbert was scared.”
“Well, come on!” he held his hand up and helped Draco step into the bath, making himself comfortable facing Harry and accepted the mug gratefully. The water was hot enough to make his skin tingle from the heat and he sipped the frothy delight with relish.
“Oh yes, to Fred Weasley. George comes in quite regularly, but that was the first time I’d seen Fred. I didn’t realise he had a girlfriend. Now, what can I help you with.”
“So… what is it?” Harry asked, not taking his eyes off that box. Draco picked it up and shook it, but he couldn’t hear anything. Tugging on the red ribbon, it unravelled, and he pulled the lid off, dropping it on the bed. It was full of black tissue paper, peeling it back until it revealed sheer red fabric. Tugging it out of the box, they both gasped. It was a pair of sheer bright red silk French knickers.
“Eventually!” Harry replied with a cheeky wink as he engulfed Draco again, clearly working his way down to the base. Harry’s bold assumption that there would be fucking later tonight and the sight of him swallowing Draco’s length had him squeezing his eyes shut tightly to try to control his body.
“What the hell guys, French knickers!” Harry complained, dragging the twins outside; they just grinned at him.
“Be nice, Harry,” Ginny reprimanded, looping her arm through his, “Come on, I’ll show you to your room before you murder each other.” Grabbing his bag, Harry let Ginny tug him away from the group and towards the stairs.
“Well, I did play Seeker,” Harry quipped to Draco’s eye roll as he returned to bed, crawling in and settling against the pillows, finally looking around their little love nest.
Bent wizards were really no big deal in Wizarding Britain, no one particularly gave a hoot what people did in the privacy of their own bedrooms, however with their pasts, Draco knew
Walking was slightly painful, it had been far too long after all, but it was well worth it. He had forgotten that familiar ache, the pain and the pleasure. Not that Harry had hurt him at all, he had been fantastic. Catching sight of himself in the small cracked mirror, Draco could swear it was a different man looking back at him.
With the soup heated up and bowls of tinned fruit, the oddest meal Draco could ever remember having, they settled down in front of the fire again, the only noise was of them hungrily finishing their impromptu meal.
Dinner was, as usual, a big noisy affair with platters being handed across the table, everyone talking at once and Draco loved it. It seemed he’d always been a part of this sizable, noisy family. He caught Harry’s gaze from the other end of the table and smiled at him. Once they’d finished eating Molly was dragged out of the kitchen and the adults set about cleaning up. They had learnt years ago she would not sit down unless forced to do so. Once the kitchen was clean, they all headed into the front room.
“It must be nice,” Draco said quietly, sipping his second drink.
“Yes, Daphne and I opened it a few years ago. We spent some time in France, and we both always loved fashion. The undergarments are as important as clothing.” Harry couldn’t help but think that sounded somewhat like a well-rehearsed sales pitch, but he nodded in agreement.
Harry could hardly contain his wicked smirk at the look on Draco’s face. That, combined with his ever-hardening cock, was a reasonably clear indication that Draco was entirely on board with it. Grabbing Draco’s shoulders, Harry spun him around to his startled gasp and pushed him towards the bed, so his thighs were flush against the mattress. Putting a hand between his shoulder blades, Harry pushed them down with a determined force until, as promised, Draco was sprawled face down on their bed. His silk-covered arse the perfect height for Harry to take full advantage of, but that would have to wait a bit longer. Giving Draco’s arse a hard swat, Harry walked around the side of the bed.
your colour!” Harry grinned at Draco’s indignant squawk at the thought of him being sorted into Gryffindor., that was even worse than being tied up and delivered to someone as a Christmas gift. teasing the pale body beneath his questioning fingers, Harry took his time. Circling the small nipples until they pebbled in arousal, walking his fingers down Draco’s stomach, watching him suck it in, either in arousal or ticklishness, Harry wasn’t sure, and lower until they danced above his pubic bone. Harry walked his fingers along it, looking up to watch Draco watch him and that was not a look of distress in his eyes. They blazed with lust.
“Fuck, harder, make me come,” Harry begged, the fucking was terrific, but he needed more. He wanted to feel Draco lose control, wanted his fast, furious fucking as his orgasm overtook him, wanted to feel it crash through his body, as he lost control, wanted to know it was Draco doing this, and him making Draco feel so good in return.
“Better than bloody French knickers!” Draco replied to Harry’s blush.
The general laughter from his friends echoed around the room. Glancing over to whomever he had brought down, Harry was horrified to realise he had crashed into Draco
“So very different to what they were with me. My mother has even taught him how to make biscuits, I didn’t think she even knew the Manor had a kitchen when I was a boy. Father is teaching him proper pureblood manners and has even taken him to the opera, to show off his grandson in public. Scorp isn’t much of a fan but he goes for his grandfather. I’ve warned them both not to even attempt to arrange a marriage for my son, he’ll marry who he loves, when he decides to, and not be dictated by some stupid pureblood rituals.” Draco couldn’t keep the passion out of his voice, it was probably the only thing he and Astoria agreed on.
“Sleep well?” Draco asked, not even bothering to hide the laughter in his voice.
“Fear not my fussy eater, Molly Weasley has taught me fair few cooking spells over the years. Might not turn it into roast pork but it will at least improve the flavour.” Glancing up Harry caught the almost terrified look on Draco’s face. “What?”
“What the hell am I doing in your room?” Draco puzzled, still not awake. That sexy, sleepy voice making Harry’s insides squirm, in a not entirely unpleasant way.
Once the presents were all handed out, with a lot of extra gifts for the kids, it was Harry and Draco’s turn to go back upstairs to shower and get dressed.
“I don’t believe that bloody rag, they’ve dragged my name through the muck more times than I can count, thank you. No, I had no idea about your sexuality, not really my business is it?” Draco hoped he could attribute the heat in the room to his blush. You’re thirty-four for Merlin's sake, grow up he thought to himself, taking another careful sip of his drink.
Harry just nodded and set to work on driving Draco to the edge. Harry hadn’t done this in a long time, but it wasn’t something he was likely to forget as he took Draco deeper and deeper, relaxing his throat muscles until Draco’s cock slid down his throat and Harry was nuzzling the pale hair at his groin.
* * * * *
“It’s a wonder you’ve got any teeth left in your head, Potter,” Draco grumbled as he put the mug of hot tea down on the bedside table. “What civilised person has three teaspoons of sugar in their tea?” ignoring the jibe, Harry managed to sit up enough to sip the tea.
“I’ve been shopping!” Harry said holding up the bag. The look that crossed Draco’s face was one he’d never forget, a mixture of both arousal and curiosity.
“Then show me, or are you all talk Potter? Scared?” Draco easily fell back into their childhood banter but there was no malice in it this time.
“Did you make me supper? Harry stepped out of the tub and onto the bathmat, he caught the towel Draco threw at him, his eye roll was epic, and he didn’t do much of a job hiding his grin.
“I’m not a girl, Potter,” Draco mock grumbled, but secretly he was thrilled. Harry had bought him roses the first time he’d arrived at the Manor to collect him for their first date. Six years later, and he still regularly bought his husband flowers.
Harry hated to admit it but Draco was a bloody good skier, but then it stood to reason he would be as fearless on skis as he was on a broom. It was similar, the feeling of flying down the mountain, the wind whipping past them, the trees flying by as they weaved and ducked between them. Harry could see Draco’s grey ski jacket just out to the side and crouched lower over his skis, hoping to gain more speed.
“Once Lily is old enough, I don't care so much but I’d like to keep it from her a bit longer, the fact her father likes men. Shit, what is in this stuff.” Harry raised his glass, glaring at it accusing. “I never open up like this to people, particularly, people I don’t know that well.”
Kissing Draco’s shoulder, Harry grinned at the stunned look on his boyfriend’s face.
Draco’s muffled growl just made Harry laugh harder, “This will be fun, well for me anyway!” the look on Draco’s face was priceless. Harry would not push Draco beyond what he was comfortable with, but as they had been circling each other for years. Harry could only assume that Draco had driven his friends mad, same as Harry had.
“Did you just come to traumatise us?” Fred asked filling their glasses again. Much as Harry was like a brother to them neither wanted to hear about his love life, particularly with Draco Malfoy. Harry just smirked, in perfect imitation of Draco, he’d rubbed off on him.
“Yes, are you alright with that?” he was shocked to see those slate grey eyes bright with tears.
It didn’t help that his ex-wife was now engaged to Draco’s best friend, Blaise. He and Ginny were co-parenting their kids and Harry really was happy for her, however, it did mean making nice with Draco.
“Oh yes, more than okay. It's so good, keep moving please!” Harry shamelessly begged, loving the feeling of Draco’s thick cock stretching him wide, his cock squashed between his stomach and the sheets, Draco’s weight all along his back. “Fuck” he muttered, floating away on sensation, nothing was better than this.
Harry couldn’t help thinking as he did it again. With no warning, he leant forward and teased Draco’s entrance with his tongue, to Draco’s much louder moan.
“You and Draco may come in quite handy, that is, if he, and you, would not mind helping an old school friend. Daphne and I are thinking of expanding into men’s lingerie but had no one we could ask about it. We’d be more than happy to provide you with a good discount?” Harry shook his head.
“With marshmallows?” Draco asked hopefully. He fondly remembered the Christmases of his childhood sitting around with his parents, reading Christmas stories in their pyjamas and robes and drinking mugs of hot chocolate.
” category.
“Did you get lost in there?” Harry’s voice carried down the hall and Draco grinned, in a hurry to get back to bed and to see where this, whatever this was, was going.
Draco thought to himself, which considering his present predicament was rather ridiculous.
Seamus and Dean were banished to the couch area as they had both spent the afternoon in the kitchen, it was now up to everyone else to clean up. However, with six people in the kitchen, it was quickly done, and they all took places on the comfortable couches, with glasses of wine or Firewhisky and sat around just chatting with one another.
“Much as the bearskin rug was a nice touch Potter, I don’t know about you, but I’m far too old to be fucking on the floor. I’m sure this place has a bedroom, preferably one with a nice comfortable bed, with you in it?” Harry couldn’t help his slight chuckle.
“You’re spoken for Weasley!” Hermione announced, waving her left hand at him, he just grinned and kissed it, swooning at her eye roll. Being the first of their friends to get married had not made the couple grow up at all, to Harry’s relief.
“I respectfully disagree, my parents were married long before my birth,” Draco said in the haughtiest manner he could muster to Harry’s vast amusement.
Harry took it slowly at first, slipping all the way into Draco’s willing body before pulling back. Draco gasped as the stretch became easier and his body adjusted. It had been far too bloody long, but never like this. Maybe it was the fact that it was Harry-
The cabin was all timber but clearly well-built as no wind whistled through the timbers. One wall was made of stone with a small fireplace. Deciding to do a little showing off of his own, Draco flicked his fingers at the fireplace, muttered a spell and a fire was soon crackling in the fireplace. He just shrugged his shoulder to Harry’s muttered, “Now who’s showing off?” He assumed the view out the large window at the bottom of the bed would be spectacular when the snow stopped falling, right now though, he couldn’t see past the snow.
“I’m not a bloody girl Potter; I don’t need sexy lingerie, thank you very much.” Draco tried to snark, but he could not take his eyes off the sheer silk, running his thumb over them.
Draco nodded.
“We got married thanks to James, he decided to make an early appearance.” Harry smiled at the memory, “Ginny said it didn’t matter if we were married or not but I knew it would have mattered to Molly and Arthur. I’d never been so terrified having to face the people who had been like parents to me and admit I’d got their daughter pregnant.”
“Well, he certainly got your looks,” Harry asked looking up to catch Draco’s smile at the thought of his son.
He pulled open the door to a tingle of the overhead bell and stared in amazement at the array of colour.
“It will be my pleasure Malfoy!” Harry whispered, his voice dripping sin as he lubed himself up and nudged his cock head against Draco’s entrance. He was already loose from Harry’s earlier attention so it wasn’t too difficult to slip into their mutual groans. Draco was tight and snug and Harry knew without a doubt he’d not last long, even though they’d only come less than an hour ago, some sort of Christmas miracle as far as Harry was concerned.
Arthur was handing out mugs of coffee laced with Firewhisky, Harry noted, taking a sip. The kids were wide awake without the added stimulant. The younger ones are hardly able to keep still. Either Santa had been, or a few people had cheated as the tree was stuffed full of gifts.
Taking a deep breath, Draco pushed open the door of
“I’ve told you things that I’ve never told anyone before, and it's not just the Firewhisky talking, you’re easy to talk to,” Draco admitted. “I used to see a mind healer for a few years after the war, she saved me.” Draco laughed bitterly, “I couldn’t talk to my parents or my fiancée yet could blurt out everything to a stranger.” Harry grabbed his hands to stop him playing with the sheets.
“Come on, we need to get out of this weather.” After trudging for what seemed like hours, although was probably no more than twenty minutes, Draco grabbed Harry’s arm.
Swirling his tongue around Draco’s nipple, he was rewarded with a low moan which in turn made Harry’s cock twitch in appreciation as he lightly tugged on the hard nub with his teeth to a louder moan.
Noting the goosebumps pebbling Draco’s skin, unsure if it was arousal or the cold, Harry cast a wandless spell and the fire crackled to life. 12 Grimmauld Place could be damn cold at the best of times, in the middle of the night in late December it was beyond freezing and that was the last thing Harry wanted. The cold was not conducive to seduction, and that was his plan for tonight.
“You need to ask?” Draco stammered as Harry slid all the way in again, as close as two people could be.
“Close Harry so close,” Draco stuttered, losing his tenuous hold on his control as Harry thrust into him harder and with no warning, Draco’s control snapped, and he gasped in relief as his orgasm tore through him. His release covered Harry’s hand, the knickers and probably the sheets as well. Right now, he couldn’t care less; he had as much energy as a newborn Niffler. Thankfully he could slump on the bed, held up by Harry’s body and the restraints around his wrists.
’ echoed around the room as Ginny bustled around getting things ready. They finished up their breakfasts quickly, grabbed skis, and prepared to head out.
Harry threw a Stinging Hex at Draco, who was far too drunk to move out of the way in time. However, it didn’t anger him as it would have done in the past; instead, he toppled over sideways on the couch, laughing his stupid head off to Harry’s annoyance.
“Is that what you want? Just us?” Harry was deadly serious. Not making fun of him, those gorgeous green eyes as serious as Draco had ever seen them.
In their competitiveness to outdo each other, neither paid all that much attention to where they were going and they ended up miles away from the others. They only realised once they had finally come to a stop at the bottom of the mountain. Harry pushed his ski goggles up on the top of his head.
All too soon, just as the first lighter shades of blue lightened the sky, Harry was rudely dragged from his slumber, by a very grouchy Draco. Sleepily Harry couldn’t understand what Draco was grouchy about, he had tea already.
Moaning into the kiss, Harry grabbed Draco’s gorgeous firm arse and pulled him slightly higher so their cloth covered cocks ground against each other. The sensation amazing as Harry lost himself in a good old-fashioned make-out session. ‘
Draco handed over the massive tray of chicken they had been asked to bring and followed Harry into the front room. Even with the reduced presents, the tree was hardly visible. Draco wasn’t sure who was more excited - the kids or Harry.
“You alright there Malfoy?” Harry asked, the amusement in his voice evident as he slid all the way down to their mutual moans of pleasure. Draco was bigger than his other lovers, the stretch enough to make Harry gasp at the sting but it was not enough to make him regret this. He’d have to thank Ron, Hermione and Blaise when he saw them next.
Harry left the bag on Draco’s side of the bed but added a little anti-tampering charm. He wanted to be there when Draco opened his present, to see the look on his face and the lust come to life in his eyes.
“Of course, I did, He clearly likes you.” Draco nodded to the little bird.
He had felt a stab of envy when Ginny had shown no hesitation in hugging Harry when he had arrived. Draco would have rather liked to have done the same thing, hug Harry Potter. Lost in his thoughts he jumped slightly as Harry put a mug of hot, black tea on the coffee table in front of him.
“Not going to happen, Potter, you’d defend those kids with your life, and I know it. Fuck, listen to us, sitting around in a snowbound cabin, getting drunk and talking about our kids and ex-wives.”
“Maybe I should bend you over the bed like this,” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear, close enough that he could feel the heat radiating off his body and his gasp at the naughty suggestion. “Oh, you like that idea, do you?” Harry reached down and stroked Draco’s arse, his hand quickly slipping under the loose silk. He had to admit they gave him much more comfortable access than Draco’s regular boxers and that bright cherry red was a stunning contrast to his pale skin.
“Oh fuck!” Draco swung around in horrified shock to find Harry standing in the doorway, his eyes glued to Draco in those knickers. Automatically he tried to cover himself up, but Harry wasn’t having any of that. “Don’t!” Harry snapped in his Head Auror Voice, to which Draco automatically responded and dropped his hands to his sides. Harry hardly even realised he’d crossed the room until he was standing right in front of Draco. He could not tear his eyes away. The silk was so sheer he could see Draco’s weeping cock through the fabric, a wet spot at the tip. Looking up Harry caught Draco staring at him and with a wicked smirk, Harry reached out and stroked him through the soft silk, relishing Draco’s low moan.
“Fuck Harry more please!” Draco needed more, Harry’s slow thrusts weren’t enough, he needed to be fucked, hard and furiously. He wanted to feel that deep ache in his arse for days. He wanted Harry to mark him as his. “Fuck me, damn you.” He snapped, frustrated to Harry’s shock; Draco could be a damn bossy bottom.
“Thanks, Patricia, I brought his dinner, figured he’s not stopped to eat?” her grin indicated he was correct. Harry was not surprised. They were having a nice chat when Draco arrived at the medi-witch station. He looked exhausted but gave Harry a small smile.
“Good,” Draco managed, planting his feet on the floor and thrusting into Harry, making the dark-haired man shudder and gasp above him. The flames from the fire caught the rivulets of sweat making their slow path down Harry’s chest, Draco couldn’t tear his gaze away as they made their slow progression over chest muscles, taut stomach and disappeared into thick coarse pubic hair.
“You damn well talk too much Potter!” Draco tried to snark, but it was pointless, his brain had turned to mush.
“To bed, night,” Harry said having difficulty stifling his grin. He knew damn well the state he’d left Draco in and knew without a doubt he’d do something about it. Sometimes teasing his boyfriend was one of the best parts of his day, well that and when Draco took his revenge and made Harry bend to his will. Not that it took much bending. That was half of the fun of it.
The new year hit with a vengeance; the weather dropped to well below freezing and Harry lost another coat and came home from work freezing. Draco shuffled him straight into a hot bath.
As Ginny had predicted, Seamus was cooking something amazing if the appreciative groans from the hungry adults were any indication. Harry kept his grin to himself as Dean thrust a stack of plates into Draco’s hands and told him to help set the table. The look on the former Slytherin’s face was priceless. However, with their combined efforts, the table was soon set and even with candles. Seamus came out of the kitchen carrying a huge pot of something that smelt damn good. Dean had a bowl full of mashed potatoes and Ginny the vegetables.
Ignoring the mess on Draco’s stomach, Harry leaned over and kissed him, trying to get his heart to calm down, it felt like it was about to thunder out of his chest.
“I’m not going to last long,” he stammered, “Fuck I’m close.” Harry just nodded, giving permission for Draco to take over, which he gladly did. Draco knew he wouldn’t last long, only a few more hard thrusts before he was burying himself in Harry and holding still as he emptied himself into his new lover.
“Is that better?” he asked, handing Draco a paper towel to wipe his mouth and hands, both covered in red sauce.
“Love you too,” he grabbed Draco in a hug and kissed him. “Thank you, come on let's eat.” That little telltale smile flirting around Draco’s mouth told Harry all he needed to know.
“You wish, Malfoy,” Harry replied, picking up on the joke easily as he wrapped his legs around Draco’s calves and easily flipped them, grinning in delight at Draco’s undignified squawk which soon turned to a moan as Harry started kissing his way down Draco’s now naked body.
“So, do you,” he nodded in return wrapping his hands around the mug “This is good, who taught you to make a proper hot chocolate?” Draco was curious. He’d never have thought Harry would have been able to make hot chocolate as good as his mother’s.
Harry had stilled, given Draco time to calm down and carefully pulled out, dropping Draco’s legs to the bed and flopping down beside him, feeling very pleased with himself. The effects of the alcohol had dissipated, his euphoria was now totally due to the sexy man beside him.
“Look!” he pointed through the trees to a small cabin that was just visible through the snow. It wasn’t very large but it would at least protect them from the rapidly worsening blizzard outside, so they wearily trudged towards it. With a quick
Harry’s blue ski pants were just tight enough to draw Draco’s attention and he couldn’t help wondering about the body hidden underneath. He had seen Harry in a professional capacity on more than one occasion, however ogling a nearly naked man with concussion, broken bones or hexing injuries and cuts and bruises were considered extremely poor form. Regardless, Draco was not dead and could appreciate how fit Harry was. It was hard to miss when the man was sitting on Draco’s examination table stripped down to just his pants.
“Blaise has invited us to spend New Year with him in London,” Draco informed Harry one afternoon as he got out of the shower. “Wants to show off his new flat, looks over the Thames and we can watch the fireworks, do you want to go?” Harry pulled the towel off his head to Draco’s grin. He could only imagine what his hair looked like as he dragged his fingers through the wet strands.
Somehow, they both managed to get time off between Christmas and New Year, so it was a few days of lounging around the house, eating the tonne of leftovers both Molly and Narcissa sent them home with and sleep in. They met Hermione and Ron for lunch at a local cafe one day and had dinner with Seamus and Dean.
“I’m serious Draco,” Something in Harry’s tone must have sunk in as Draco finally took him seriously and looked around more carefully.
“Fuck, so close,” Harry whined, unable to take much more as his body ramped up for what he knew would be an explosive orgasm. “Sweet Mercy” he gasped as it was torn out of him. Harry felt as if his brain had shut down as he couldn’t say a word, just managed to gasp and moan his way through the strongest orgasm he’d ever had.
“They are gorgeous,” he rested his chin on Draco’s shoulder, “You should wear them, you’d look gorgeous in Gryffindor red.” He was only half-joking but honestly, he’d not been able to get the thought of Draco in the soft, sheer silk since Fred, or maybe George had given them to him. He’d be bloody gorgeous.
Harry slipped on his glasses as he slid out of bed and grabbed his wand determined to find out who had got past the wards on the house. Shivering in the cold December air, he wished he’d taken the time to throw on something warmer than his t-shirt and boxers but he wasn’t going back upstairs now.
Draco had no doubt the little bird knew it wasn’t valued by the sad look on its face.  Draco opened the cage door and carefully lifted the little bird out, who then chirped and whistled at him happily.
“I brought your dinner,” Harry held up the dish, the warming charm keeping it nice and hot. “Hungry?”
Taking the plunge Draco nodded and was rewarded with a huge grin.
Draco just grinned. He was going to be doing all the work here as Harry was a contented lazy sprawl under him, a slight blush colouring his face and neck as he gasped and moaned. Draco tightened his grip and jerked them harder, faster as he leaned down and captured Harry’s mouth with his own. Slipping his tongue inside and savouring the taste that was uniquely Harry’s. Tea, peppermint and Firewhisky.
“I need to come!” Draco whined and to his frustration, Harry stopped the delicious torment and let Draco’s cock slip from his mouth with an obscene pop.
Harry chuckled and sat back down, resting his head on the back of the couch.
“Molly and Arthur Weasley have the biggest hearts of anyone I’ve ever known, Draco. I promise you if you’re important to me they will accept you.”
“You’re not finished yet,” Harry said handing him the last parcel. Harry couldn’t decide which was his favourite. The black knickers and a garter belt or the dark blue corset.
Together.
“Yes, that’s his name, Owlbert Einstein,” Harry replied as he sat down, gratefully sipping on his hot tea “He’s still sleeping.”
“That was actually far better than I expected,” Harry said leaning over to put his bowls on the table. “Molly and Ginny would be horrified, tinned soup - Merlin forbid," but his grin had Draco grinning along with him.
“Nah, he just wants Malfoy in his bed,” Fred had suggested, curling his arm around Harry’s shoulders in laughter.
Thankfully Harry didn’t question him and simply tugged the ribbon and lifted the lid.
“Harry please, touch me, I’m so close,” Draco gasped, he so badly needed some friction, he was frustratingly close but just could not tip over the edge. He’d have to thank the twins later, much later, for their naughty Christmas present, if this were the result. He loved it when Harry took charge, slaking his lust in Draco’s willing body. He never left Draco wanting though so he could not hold back his sigh of relief as he felt Harry’s hand grab his leaking cock and slowly start to smear his wetness to make the glide easier. The dual sensation of Harry’s cock sliding into him and his hand on his cock was enough to make Draco squeeze his eyes shut and try to hold back his orgasm as long as he could. He would never tire of the physical aspect of their relationship. They’d both had lovers before, both male and female, but Draco had never had one who let him explore the more in-depth, kinkier aspect of his personality as Harry did.
“Your miles away, what are you thinking about?” Harry asked, propping his head on his hand and watching Draco.
“Take him home, Harry; the night healer has just arrived, see you Monday Draco.” With his swinging shifts, it came around every so often that Draco had a treasured weekend off and he was eager to get out of here.
“Be with you in a minute” a voice called from the back “Look around while you wait.” Harry did as the voice commanded. He’d always thought underwear was just for practical purposes, but none of this was at all realistic, but it was all gorgeous.
“Oh Merlin, please give me Draco Malfoy in tight leather pants in my bed,” Harry had asked, staring up at the night sky. It was a blanket of stars, one of them shooting across the night sky.
“Tell Mademoiselle we sent you; it's rather… high end.” Fred told Harry as he wrapped his scarf around his neck again and pulled on his coat, waving to the twins. He set off down the street to the apparition point.
“I’d say it is a rescue lodge or similar but it’s fancier than most, maybe someone’s winter hideaway?” Draco sipped his tea. “They aren’t normally so… comfortable?” or normally have just one large comfortable bed he thought to himself.
“I wanted to thank you for Draco’s Christmas present,” Harry replied with a smirk as they both choked on their drinks.
Even though Harry hadn’t had much to do with the Greengrass girls in school, he found himself quite liking Astoria. Not many women would take this situation quite so well.
“Now we will meet back here on Christmas eve. Everyone will bring their dish and present. The minimum amount is ten galleons.” Molly explained. With the size of the Weasley clan, these days Christmas was a well-planned exercise. Draco had a month to come up with the perfect present.
“You okay?” Harry asked, a glass of Firewhisky on the table beside Draco’s chair as Harry nursed his own, “You were gone a while.”
Getting to his feet and brushing snow off his jacket and jeans, Harry looked across the road at the very posh looking store. Black and gold were their colours, not that Harry knew much about women’s lingerie stores, but it looked bloody posh to him.
Without thinking about it, Harry reached up and ran his fingers through Draco’s hair. It was as soft as Harry had always imagined, it reminded him of Lily’s hair as a baby. Draco stayed silent as Harry lightly ran his fingers over the contours of his face.
“Hmmmm eventually,” Harry grinned at Draco’s muttered profanity as he stood between his spread legs, the silk stretched tight so Harry could easily see the plug teasing his boyfriend, loving his whines of frustrated arousal. Kneeling on the carpet between Draco’s feet, Harry slowly dragged his palms up Draco’s thighs, feeling the muscles twitch under his hands. Leaning closer, Harry pushed the silk out of his way and trailed a line of kisses up the back of Draco’s thigh to the curve of his arse and lightly nipped it, enough to leave a red mark. At his shuddering breath, Harry repeated the same manoeuvre up his other leg. He was in no hurry to end this sweet torture; it was too much fun.
fondness for reporting on every time I have a bloody piss and it’s no wonder, I just don’t bother with dating at all.”
“Is this a good enough reward?” Harry asked smirking at Draco’s very vocal enjoyment of his body being very thoroughly pleasured, “Don’t worry you’ll get your chance at the fucking part, this isn’t going to be one way.” Harry gripped Draco’s hips tighter and speed up, thrusting into him harder, making Draco take his whole length, not that he was complaining about it at all.
“No, I want this one, how much?” Slowly Draco stood again, towering over the shop owner.
“No Malfoy, this is my room.” Harry managed not to let his eyes roam over Draco’s near-naked body.
“What time is it?” he asked glancing out the windows. It was just lightening.
Glaring at Harry, he swung around and headed for the kitchen, slamming through the door to muffled complaints from the other side.
“Yes,” was all Draco could manage to whine, Harry’s naughty suggestion sent shivers over his body and heat straight to his cock. Not that he wasn’t hard enough already but the thought of being taken over the end of their bed wearing women’s lingerie, well apparently Draco was kinkier than he thought as he had no objection to that idea at all.
“Please Harry,” Draco moaned, his boyfriend was such a damn tease, but Draco needed him now. He was so hard he ached, but he knew his release was entirely dependent on Harry. He could hear Harry moving around the room. He readily identified the click of their wardrobe opening, wondering which restraints Harry had chosen. He couldn’t help his startled gasp as the cold lube was smeared around his entrance and of course Harry’s evil chuckle. Bastard, he thought, gasping as slowly Harry started to stretch him. His gasp turned into a moan as he felt Harry push the plug in, spreading him around it. Not enough that he’d not feel the further stretch when Harry slid in. He gasped, startled as the plug started to vibrate lightly.
* * * * *
“I really think, considering I’ve had your cock down my throat and about to put my fingers up your arse, you could call me Harry?” He asked with a cheeky grin, to which Draco just managed to nod in agreement.
“Two, Pansy and Astoria.” Draco absently replied, still trying to get a peek in the bag. From what he could tell it was over half full. “How much did you spend!” he demanded to Harry’s smirk.
Course that wasn’t very successful as now all his senses were on full alert and it was more intense. Vaguely Draco had to wonder where Harry got so damn good at this but decided to ask him much later.
“You damn well stop now Potter and I’ll curse your balls blue I swear it,” Draco snapped to Harry’s chuckle as he carefully lined himself until he could feel Draco’s cock nudging at his entrance and muttered a quick lubrication spell. Harry preferred the proper stuff however he wasn’t going to waste time going upstairs to retrieve it, this would do for the time being and he made love often enough that he didn’t need a tone of preparation, even though that could be a lot of fun.
“I’m bisexual, Draco. You must be the only person who doesn’t know since the bloody
“Yes, thanks.” Unable to keep still, Harry finished his tea and walked over to the window, staring out into the white nothingness. The blizzard had set in and he could only see a foot or so through the glass. Lost in his own thoughts Harry had no idea the picture he presented to the man sitting behind him.
and stepped into the dim interior. A voice called from a back that they’d be with him shortly and to have a look around, so Draco did as he was bid and slowly started to inspect the various owls on display.
“Fuck,” Draco gasped as Harry slid into his body repeatedly, driving him crazy and nudging him closer and closer to losing control again. He had not come again so quickly since he was in school, far too many years ago, but he could feel his cock hardening again.
There had been something in that damn Firewhisky he’d been drinking earlier as two glasses would never have affected him like this otherwise. Still, the outcome wasn’t all that bad, well except for being naked, wrapped in red ribbons and spread out under Potter’s bloody Christmas tree. They’d even damn well put a tag on him. Granger had backed off when she’s approached him with a bow.
“How’d they take that?” Draco asked snorting in laughter, “Bet that made you squirm.”
“Yes, with marshmallows. Let me run the bath for you and I’ll go make some.” Harry climbed off the bed and unselfconsciously walked over to the en-suite bathroom and seconds later the sound of running water filled the bedroom. “Don’t fall asleep!” he warned, tossing on a robe, the rest of the house was bitterly cold, and hurrying downstairs.
“Your wish is my command, Malfoy!” Harry snarked back and thrust in harder, enough to make the old bed complain loudly, the creak of springs and thump, thump of the bed head against the wall joined in the gasps and moans of the two men. However, Harry couldn’t hold back, it was all far too much as he gripped Draco’s hips hard enough to bruise, and bellowed his release into the room, shuddering as it was torn out of him, and into the willing body of his new lover.
“Are you OK with this?” Harry asked he would never take unfair advantage of someone like this, it wasn’t in his nature. At Draco’s pause, Harry removed his hand, not wanting to influence the blonde wizard at his mercy however Draco gave him a hesitate nod. Reaching up Harry unknotted the ribbon silencing him and watched him work his jaw loose.
Letting Draco’s cock slip from his mouth with an obscene slurp Harry grinned.“That is the general idea Malfoy, I want to make you totally lose control.” Harry couldn’t keep his hands to himself and started to wank Draco as well, his muttered curse made Harry grin.
Draco stared up at the sign above the door. He’d discussed his plan with Ron, Hermione and even Harry’s ex-girlfriend, Ginny. They’d all assured him that for all of Harry’s stubbornness, this was the right thing.
“Yes, fuck please,” he gasped a little at the intrusion, not through pain, it was just unexpected. He nodded at the questioning look on Harry’s face, clearly, the man was a little pre-occupied to ask if he was fine with this. He was so much more than just fine. He hadn’t fooled around in a few months but wanted so badly to be claimed by Harry.
“Don’t move my pretty pet!” Harry ordered, and even in a whisper, he knew Draco would obey him. Walking over to the wardrobe he pulled out their toy box and selected a plug, not an overly big one but it would start to stretch Draco out but not enough that he’d not feel Harry’s entry. There was no fun in that. Smothering it in lube, Harry was pleased to see that Draco had not moved. He just stared at the sight before him. Draco’s long narrow feet planted on the carpet, bare legs spread wide that led up to those gorgeous red knickers, Harry made a mental note to thank the twins later, to where his arse was on display under the sheer fabric. Walking over, Harry smeared lube on Draco’s entrance to his moan and quickly slid a finger in.
“You do know I have no idea what most of this stuff is, don’t you?” Harry asked, not able to keep the humour out of his voice. She merely grinned and nodded.
“Oh, shut up, it’s well after midnight. We can talk more tomorrow,” tugging the blankets up over them, Harry leaned over and gave Draco a soft kiss and muttered “Good night” and they settled down to sleep with the sound of the wind howling outside, but they were warm and contented, heading down another uncharted path.
“Always one to make an entrance, as usual, Potter,” Draco growled, clearly not in a forgiving mood. Harry just grinned at him, he knew by now that Draco was more bark than bite.
“Fucking show off,” he grumbled a grin breaking out and ruining his pout. Wandless magic had always turned him on, the sheer power of it.
Thankfully his legs were not tied together so Draco could spread them wide to give Harry easier access which he took full advantage of and rolled his balls in his hands, to Draco’s gasp. He couldn’t hold back his moans and gasps of pleasure, this was more than he’d ever experienced in his life.
“You’re going to overheat in that jacket, take it off, you don’t need it in here.”
“So, it would seem! I must have been good this year, or is that wicked?” Harry asked, trying to look innocent, but he knew he wasn’t succeeding. The bulge in his pyjama bottoms showed that his thoughts were villainous.
“Well, you’re… not gay!” Harry stammered, unsuccessfully keeping his eyes on Draco’s face. Those leather pants fit like a second skin, leaving nothing to the imagination and, to Harry’s astonishment, a small lightning bolt tattoo was etched onto Malfoy’s hipbone.
Harry snorted in laughter at the look on his boyfriend’s face. His pure blood sensibilities were offended.
Dinner was much like any other, they sat and discussed their week, offered solutions to problems and the like. Not that Harry was anywhere as skilled at potions as what Draco was but sometimes it was the little things that changed the way he was working on a problem. Right now, he was trying to come up with an antidote to dragon pox. It had nearly been eradicated but Draco was part of a team to clear it up once and for all.
Harry stood just outside the bathroom door, the soft light enough to see his sleeping boyfriend. He was curled under the covers, hugging Harry’s pillow, a small smile on his face. Grinning, Harry climbed into bed, wrangling his pillow back and tugging Draco close. Muttering something, he wrapped himself around Harry, snuggling close and immediately dropped back to sleep. However, it took Harry a bit longer. He kept reliving their night of lovemaking repeatedly in his head. From walking in and catching Draco in those red knickers to the sight of Draco secured to the bed with red restraints. Not for the first time, Harry wished Draco had been sorted into Gryffindor, but then again most of his wanking fantasies involved the blonde Slytherin curled up beside him, often involved them fooling around in the Slytherin dorms. As Harry started to doze off, he knew without a shadow of a doubt he’d be buying Draco more lingerie. The results were outstanding.
“What?” he asked to Harry’s light chuckle.
Glancing down with bemusement, Harry looked at the box and up at Draco. He was about to shake it when Draco stopped him.
Harry pulled back slightly, mostly to breathe, but happily swallowed Draco’s cock to the base again, reaching up and fondling his balls, making the man beneath him squirm and gasp in delight.
“I think we’re going to have to clear another drawer for Draco’s lingerie,” Harry grinned as Astoria added the corset to the pile. Harry wandered over to a table and picked up a black pair of sheer knickers, some sort of stretchy lace stuff but he thought Draco would look adorable in them, not that he’d tell the stubborn git, he’d deliberately not wear them if he did. Harry picked up one in each colour and added them to the ever-growing pile.
“No, I’ll give it a while, wait for his personality to come through,” Harry said, walking into the kitchen, the owl perched on his forearm. Draco smirked, satisfied at how well he knew his husband, and slid a few pieces from the chopping board onto a plate. Draco watched amused as Harry tried to teach the owl which vegetables were good for him. Carrots, apparently, were not acceptable, but snow peas were alright. It didn’t take long until their new companion had figured out which ones he liked, even if Harry kept trying to give him the others.
Harry’s flat wasn’t far from the pub, but tonight his feet were not cooperating. It was close to twenty minutes later when he slotted his key into the front door. Dropping his scarf and leather jacket on the sofa, Harry plodded down the long narrow hallway. A faint Lumos from his wand lit the way.
Draco couldn’t help thinking fondly as, without warning, he knocked Harry’s hand out of the way and engulfed half of his length, to Harry’s started gasp of pleasure. There had only ever been two men who had been able to swallow all of Harry’s length, neither he’d ever been able to tell Ron about. Even though he’d taken Ginny’s virginity, Charlie Weasley had taken his on a hot, drunken night in Romania.
“Don’t you bloody dare, if you value your balls.” Harry threatened, however, Draco just snorted at that threat as he knew it was pointless. Harry was clearly quite fond of his balls right where they were.
“Fuck Potter, you’ll make me come doing that.” Draco gasped, not to stop Harry, but he figured fair warning was only polite.
“Any what?” Harry asked puzzled looking back over his shoulder at Draco who was now sprawled on the couch, an ankle supported on the opposite knee.
Course he didn’t have time to focus on the knickers, what with excited children, the older ones with new brooms, the kitchen a hub of activity, and as usual, the smells mouth-watering.
“Our betrothal was announced when I came of age, we married three years later. Astoria loved the thought of being the next Mrs Malfoy, I’m still not sure I was part of that excitement.” Draco drained half his drink, staring into the flames. “It was a disaster from the beginning. I knew all my father cared about was the Malfoy line continuing but it took six long years for her to get pregnant. I was so relieved when she made the announcement and I could remove myself from her bedchamber to both our relief, and wait for our son to be born.” Draco finished his drink and poured another. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to blurt all that out.”
“I’d prefer it if you fucked me!” Harry said and despite being held down, easily broke Draco’s hold and rolled over, boldly waggling his arse at Draco. “I’m prepped and ready and waiting for your cock to split me open!” Harry said opening his legs so Draco could see he was indeed ready to be taken. They made love often, so they didn’t need a lot of preparation every time, and honestly Harry rather liked the pleasure and pain of being taken fast and hard. Course the best way to get what he wanted was to provoke Draco into giving him what he wanted. Harry knew damn well Draco would never really hurt him, but right now he was not in the mood to take it slow and gentle.
The slight crinkling of paper drew Draco from his folding, and he stared at the black tissue paper confused. Tugging it open, he found himself holding the red silk French knickers that Fred Weasley had given him for Christmas. He stroked his thumb over the silk, it was soft under his touch, and so sheer he could see his hand through them. Snapping himself out of his fascination with them, Draco quickly folded them and put them back in the drawer, finishing up just as Harry arrived home from the Burrow, filthy dirty and sweaty but grinning happily.
A few nights later it was Harry’s turn to return the favour. It was close to eight o’clock, and Draco was at least three hours late home from work. They’d both had to work back on far more nights than they could count, but Harry could guarantee that Draco hadn’t stopped to eat. Putting his dinner into a container, Harry slipped it into a carry bag and grabbed his jacket. Grabbing some floo powder, he called out “St Mungo's” and disappeared in a flare of bright green flames.
“Sweet Merlin Potter… I won’t last.” Draco gasped, feeling his orgasm creep up on him. Frustratingly Harry backed off, teasing him and sucking lightly, running his tongue over the head and rim, driving Draco mad. He’d never had a blow job like this, not since Pansy Parkinson had bestowed the first one at 15 in the Slytherin common room. It had been a dare that no one thought she’d carry through on but then again Pansy always had been an exhibitionist.
The Weasley boys then got in on the act and, well, it had degenerated into a free for all hook-up suggestion party for Harry and had become more and more outlandish until Fred and George had come up with the most outlandish suggestion. Unfortunately for Harry, also the most accurate one.
“Yes, but we’ll need a good selection to choose from, now shoosh.” She reminded him somewhat of Hermione when she was on a rant about something. He and Ron had learnt a long time ago, not to get in her way.
“Untie me, Potter!” Draco ordered, used to having his orders obeyed, course Harry did no such thing.
“Far too much damn information, Harry,” Fred wiped the Firewhisky off his chin. Harry just shrugged, unconcerned about their reactions.
“Calm down. Once the storm passes, we can apparate back to the lodge.” Clearly, Draco was not convinced by the look he gave Harry as he dropped onto a chair.
Harry just stared at the little fluffy owl staring up at him from the box. It blinked at him a few times, adjusting to the sudden light and gave a tiny hoot, tilting its head and blinking again.
“Need some help with that Potter?” Boldly looking down at Harry’s hardening cock, Draco smirked and quirked an eyebrow at Harry. Those unsightly clothes that Harry usually wore, clearly his fashion sense had not improved since school, hid a gorgeous body. Harry was all toned, solid muscles. He’d shot up since school too, they both had, but Draco had never expected this.
The tea and fire had warmed both men up significantly, but Harry had yet to take his jacket off. He could feel himself nodding off until Draco’s chuckle woke him up again.
“Molly Weasley!” Draco said in a small voice. “I’m going to have to spend time with Molly Weasley! The woman who rid the Wizarding World of my crazy psycho bitch Aunt Bellatrix?”
“What would be worse?” George queried walking over to Harry and holding out a small black card with gold writing.
“It won’t be easy, you know, that right? But then again when have we ever done easy?” he grinned at Draco’s huff of laughter.
“You’ve never complained before and come on; sexy knickers are nothing compared to what is in our toy box. Maybe I’ll make you wear a plug for the day before I take you wearing those knickers?” by the action going on in Draco’s pants, Harry knew damn well he wasn’t averse to the idea. “I’ll leave it up to you when surprise me?” with that he let his boyfriend go.
“Muggle expression, you look pleased with yourself.” Draco just shrugged, running his hands through his damp hair.
“Eventually,” Harry replied and Draco was sure he could feel his grin against his skin as Harry nibbled and kissed his way lower, his destination obvious. It had been a damn long time since anyone had made Draco feel like this. Astoria had flatly refused to pleasure him with her mouth after the first two or three times and never after she had fallen pregnant and Draco hadn’t had that many lovers, either male or female since the divorce to do it either.
Draco grabbed Harry’s waistband and tugged him further into his lap, not wanting the dark-haired man to end up on the floor, well not unless Draco was down there with him but alas, the carpet didn't have the same appeal as the large comfortable bed in the other room but was that taking things too far, too fast. Hell, right now Draco didn’t care, he was swept away with the feeling of Harry in his lap, kissing him back and knowing there was no way they could be disturbed.
“Oh fuck!” he muttered, louder than he’d intended as Harry boldly took him into his mouth and lightly sucked. Draco wasn’t too sure how long he’d be able to hold out. He’d been so busy at work, sex had not been a priority, so it had been a while since anyone else had touched him and no wanking could ever make up for this.
Harry had celebrated New Year’s Eve in the pub with his friends. Ron had proposed to Hermione and her delighted acceptance. His best friend had been full of nerves when Harry had helped him choose the ring last month.
“You love my filthy mouth, don’t… fuck… don’t tell me otherwise,” Harry stuttered just as Draco got the angle right and dragged the head of his cock over Harry’s sweet spot. “Fuck yes there again,” he stammered, feeling the pleasure zing along his nerves. Draco was strong enough to hold him down, not that Harry couldn’t break the hold if he wanted to, but he loved handing himself over to his lover. He had no doubt Draco’s grip on his hips would leave bruises, but he didn’t mind that either, he loved the stupid grin wore every time he saw them before they faded. Draco was not allowed to heal them.
“Oh, do you now? You like hearing what I intend to do to you, is that it?” Draco could only nod. “Maybe I’ll put those ribbons to use later? Tie you to my bed and have my wicked way with you, repeatedly?” Draco couldn’t prevent his whole-body shudder at the thought of it.
“Happy Valentine’s Day, Harry,” Draco sat on the coffee table in front of Harry and put the box into his hands, feeling like Luna’s nargles had taken flight in his stomach. “You can open your eyes now.”
Flopping on the mattress, Draco tried to catch his breath, he felt like he’d just finished a Quidditch match. He was breathless, sweaty and ached but he’d not swap it for anything.
“Now, are bras required or not?” she queried, again the eyebrow doing its little dance and Harry could not contain his blush. He wasn’t sure how far Draco wanted to take this but that just seemed a bit too far, just yet.
Somehow Draco doubted it but this was more than he’d ever imagined. That wet, teasing tongue was driving him mad, mercy it felt so good as Harry swiped it around his entrance, teasing the sensitive flesh and making Draco whine in arousal. He could well understand why it was so addictive, it was a toe-curling pleasure that has all his nerve endings alive and clearly dancing to Harry’s tune. All too soon Harry tore his mouth away, trailing kisses up Draco’s back to whisper in his ear “How do you want me? Like this or on your back?”
“Just give him a chance, he’s a friendly little guy, just has some growing up to do.” Harry looked down at the little bird again who hooted again, a little louder this time. Glaring at his husband again, Harry reached into the box and the little bird jumped up onto his hand, chirping as Harry lifted him out.
Harry hadn’t mentioned the knickers again, he didn’t have to. Draco could not get them off his mind. A few times he found himself standing in their bedroom, knickers in hand and rock hard, somewhat inconvenient when his boyfriend wasn’t due home for hours. Stripping off his healer’s robes and underclothes, Draco stood naked in their room, caressing the soft silk. Bending over, he slipped them over his feet and tugged them up.
“Tattoos, I was wondering if you have any more?”
“You take a little getting used to, be patient!” course the arrogant Slytherin took that as praise, but then again, he had every right to boast. He was long and thick and sweet Merlin Harry could very easily get used to this. The Auror department kept him fit as did the regular Quidditch matches with the Weasley’s so Harry had no problem getting into a rhythm, sinking down onto Draco’s length and easily riding him.
“Draco, I understand. I saw one for years and I did have a family to talk to. We were all affected by what we went through as kids. However, if it ensures our kids can grow up safely, then it was worth it.” Harry’s explanation was cut short but his jaw-cracking yawn and Draco’s snort of laughter.
“Owlbert?” Draco asked with a laugh as he slid eggs onto their plates and carried them over to the table.
“You’re both welcome any time, let me know how he likes them.” She said with a wink handing Harry the bag. Waving he left the shop and wrapped his scarf tighter around his neck, it was cold out here.
Striding off down the short hall, Draco found the cabin did have a loo, a basin and an old claw foot bathtub. Taking care of business, Draco washed his hands and braced his hands on the old chipped sink and stared at himself in the mirror. Draco had never really paid much attention to his looks but the man staring back at him from the mirror looked old and tired.
Apparating home, Harry stepped into the lounge room and shrugged out of his coat, scarf and gloves.
“And there is that famous Malfoy snark I’ve missed.” Harry carefully climbed to his feet, his legs wobbly and his arse sore. Putting his hand out he pulled Draco to his feet.
“He’ll outgrow the baby feathers in a month or so, according to the owner at the Emporium.” Draco picked up their mugs and walked into the living room. Their little owl was not going to be ignored, and his sad little chirrups had Harry taking a detour to his perch near the window to pick up and carry him to the lounge with them to Draco’s amused smirk.
“That could be awkward if you had company,” Draco said smirking, the Firewhisky loosening his tongue. There was no way he would ever have had this conversation sober. “Wouldn’t do the sex life any good having your three kids burst in on you and some woman.” Harry just gave him a very confused, slightly inebriated look.
“Well, we clearly came that way, so we just have to retrace our steps.” He replied, which of course would have been perfectly logical except that visibility was low. Looking up, Draco noted the sky was getting darker. By his calculations, it was about two in the afternoon but felt much later. “We need to find shelter and fast.” Draco shouldered his skis and started to walk towards the forest, grabbing his own Harry followed.
“Why?” Harry asked, looking up again. It was getting darker, and colder, the wind picking up.
“Yes please,” he moaned, the image dancing in his head.
“Oh, you’d be surprised who comes in here and what they buy but of course it’s privileged information but not all of it is for the gentleman’s wives shall we say!” Harry found himself grinning at her mischievous nature. He could see Draco dating her, she was a lot of fun.
They spent Boxing Day at the Manor, and that could not have been more different. Formal and stuffy and Lucius’ disapproval radiating off him in waves, but Harry did his best for Draco’s sake, trying to engage the elder Malory in conversation. By the time they retired to Draco’s old room, Harry had a raging headache.
me themselves if they could have got away with it. I don't even think it was the scandal of the divorce, but the fact they were no longer associated with the Malfoy name. It was all just for the prestige and image, they didn’t care that their daughter and I were making each other miserable.”
“Yet, you named your son after him?” Draco asked curious, pulling out of Harry’s arms and settling down on the other pillow and watching him from the light from the fire.
“Don’t give me that rubbish, whatever is in that bag is just as much for your enjoyment as mine.” Draco correctly guessed. “Well go and put it away, dinner is going to be ready soon.” Draco knew damn well he’d not be able to concentrate on anything else except that bag all night. “Bloody Potter!” he muttered under his breath as Harry disappeared down the hall.
“On a mountain?” he replied sarcastically to Harry’s glare.
“Potter,” Draco’s voice echoed from deeper in the cabin and it didn’t take long for Harry to find him, standing at the doorway of what was clearly the bedroom, the only bedroom in the entire cabin. “We have a problem,” Draco said staring at Harry over his shoulder and scowling.
“Sweet Salazar Malfoy!” Harry moaned, twining his fingers into those fine blonde tresses. Harry needed to ground himself, he felt like he was floating away. Draco knew just when to tease with that wicked tongue of his, flicking it over all the sensitive parts of Harry’s cock, or to take him to the base, swallowing around the head which made Harry see stars. “Fuck yes,” he moaned as Draco took all of him again. “I’ll come again you keep that up,” Harry warned, feeling it was only polite but Merlin he really did not want Draco to stop, this was amazing.
“I don’t care what other people think, the only opinions I care about is my friends and family, the rest of the Wizarding world can go jump for all I care,” Harry snapped, it was an old argument which still irritated him. “Love is love, it shouldn’t make any damn difference who it's with, it's not illegal. I’d love to give Skeeter an interview that would curl her toes but Ginny has reminded me, it would hurt our kids and I would never do that. Sorry, it's a sensitive topic.” Harry smiled apologetically.
“I see you made it, Harry.” Ginny laughed as she helped him to his feet. Giving her a kiss on the cheek only to hear Blaise’s playful growl, Harry dusted himself off and looked around the room.
“I’m not exactly looking forward to facing your parents either, thanks,” Harry grouched. While he was thankful to Narcissa Malfoy for lying to Voldemort in the Dark Forest, Harry knew it had only been for Draco’s benefit. If she had known her son was safe, well Harry didn’t want to think of the outcome.
“What the fuck!” he stammered, grabbing his glasses so he could see what was in his bed.  Instantly recognising that platinum hair and dragged the covers off the man asleep in his bed he demanded, “Malfoy, what the fuck are you doing in my bed?”
“Are you coming, Malfoy?” Harry taunted, grinning at the glare he received from the blond Slytherin as he clipped on his own skis and took off down the mountain after Harry.
“You are an idiot at times, Malfoy,” but there was no sting in the complaint. “Of course our families have to be told, but well… I’d like to keep it from them for a short while. You know, just to be sure of us?” this time it was Harry’s turn to be hesitant.
“Well, it ain’t much o’ a bird, normally they be 10 galleons but 7 will do?” the little bird screeched in indignation at hearing that, much to Draco’s amusement. He lightly stroked its head, and it settled again. Draco also purchased everything any self-respecting owl could need. Shrinking everything but the owl and his cage Draco walked to the nearest apparition point and soon found himself in the front room of his and Harry’s flat.
“You look like the cat that caught the canary,” Harry said, returning his grin.
“Probably this,” Draco said before pushing Harry hard against the door and kissed him. There was nothing soft and sweet about it. The kiss was rough and demanding, all teeth and tongue. There was no way Harry was letting Draco win this battle, so he effortlessly pushed off the door and, still kissing him, backed Draco to the bed. With a wicked smirk, Harry shoved Draco backwards onto the bed and following him down, he continued their passionate kissing, which soon led to Harry peeling those leather pants from Draco’s body to their mutual satisfaction.
“So, do you have any further tattoos, Potter?” Draco called across the room as he finished his tea, leaning over to put the mug on the coffee table.
Teasingly Harry let his hand slip further down, stroking against Draco’s sensitive entrance and carefully pushed a finger into Draco's warmth.
“What the hell are you talking about?” Draco asked totally confused to Harry’s drunken grin.
“I see he’s as charming as ever,” Harry muttered to faint chuckles behind him.
Knowing full well what Harry was getting at, and knowing him well enough, Draco knew Harry could take him quickly like this, and it had been a while since they’d played this game. Roughly dragging Harry where he wanted him, to his laughter, Draco pinned him face down, shoving his legs open and lined himself up. Harry squeezed their joined fingers to let him know he was okay, and Draco pushed in one long constant thrust to Harry’s moan as his body was breached.
“Pull a name out of the hat, instead of buying a gift for everyone; you just buy a present for one person,” Harry explained yet again.
“Draco!” Harry growled warningly, he’d been adamant for ten years that he did not want another owl, but clearly, his husband had ignored him and gone against his wishes.
“I knew there was a reason I loved you.” Draco peeled back the lid, and the smell of Harry’s chicken casserole filled the room, to quite a few hungry groans. Not saying a word, Harry just handed him a fork and watched as Draco dug into the meal right there. Grinning, Harry steered him down the corridor towards his office. He pushed Draco into his chair and cleared some room on his desk. He had heard about sauce stains on Draco’s patient files for weeks. Arguing that he was not to blame, he had not even been there didn’t make any difference.
Harry swung his pack onto his back and grabbed his skis again, grinning at the group, Draco in particular. There was no way Harry was letting Draco get away with more runs than him.
Cheeky bastard Draco thought fondly as he straddled Harry’s lap, quickly pinning his arms to the back of the lounge as he leaned in and lazily kissing him, taking his time, making Harry whimper in both pleasure and frustration. Harry had changed a lot from the skinny, underfed boy from school, and had turned into a gorgeous man who had a kinky streak a mile wide. They had an active and varied sex life, and Draco loved it, loved this sexy man underneath him.
“Shall I tell Molly Weasley you just compared her to Voldemort?”
Boldly, he stuck his hand into Harry’s pants to his startled hiss. Maybe or maybe not, his hands were cold and grinned at the glare his boyfriend gave him. Soon enough Harry’s scowl turned into a contented sigh as Draco stroked him, nibbling on his ear and making him all hot and bothered.
“Really?” Harry asked in a very sarcastic tone to Fred’s snort of laughter. “Thanks for the warning though, I’m glad we didn’t open it in front of Molly and Arthur.” Harry finished off his Firewhisky, glad Fred had capped the bottle. Getting drunk with these two was a painful experience, as he could attest.
“The fact that we can’t be disturbed, no kids barging in or work floo calling, just… us..” Draco trailed off, feeling a little self-conscious. He wasn’t one for admitting what he wanted, well not without a lot of provocation. Gentle pressure on his chin forced him to look up and at Harry.
“Well I certainly won’t say no to a bottle of this quality but what’s the occasion?” Fred questioned as George went to get some glasses. Cracking it open, Fred poured them each a generous shot, and they clinked glasses to cheers all around.
“My son is having a much better time at Hogwarts than we did and it seems the old house rivalry is much more Quidditch focused these days. Merlin forbid he even has Gryffindor friends, your son is one of them.” Harry chuckled at the disgruntlement in Draco’s voice. There was something rather comforting lying in bed, listening to the storm rage outside and talking about all sorts of things. Course, the fact he was feeling lazy and contented from that spectacular orgasm has a lot to do with it.
“Didn’t I tell you not to go to sleep?” leaning down Harry whispered in his ear and could not contain his laughter at Draco’s very girlish squeal and furious glare.
“That bastard Zabini is in trouble when I get my hands on him!” Draco growled, for show than anything else. Blaise had threatened months ago to do something about Draco’s very inconvenient attraction to Harry but he’d never thought his so-called best friend would act on his evil plan. Draco had underestimated the dark-skinned Italian, he’d not do that again.
“Harry, you two have been circling each other since you were about fourteen and the hormones kicked into high gear. No one, who knew you then is the least bit surprised that you two have finally started dating. Of course, I know they are for Draco, why do you think I didn’t go for girlie pinks? So not his colour.”
“How are they with Scorpius?” Harry asked curiously.
Harry dropped a kiss into Draco’s shoulders and carefully pulled out, rolling onto the bed and brushing Draco’s sweaty hair out of his eyes. He had to grin at the well-fucked look on Draco’s face.
The next morning Draco woke to a cold empty bed, light spilling into the room from the window. Rolling over puzzled, he glared at the open bathroom door. Harry would normally tell him if he’d been called into work overnight, but he had clearly been out of bed for a while, his side was icy. Grumbling about missing husband’s, Draco climbed out of bed, pulling on his pyjamas and walking out into the flat.
Leaning over to kiss Draco again, driving him wild with that wickedly talented mouth, Draco gasped as the rough carpet under him became a soft and luxurious fur and the ribbons melted away leaving him free.
“That’s right, haven’t got a girl, so different from bringing up boys I can tell you. Lily is so different from her brothers, not just that she’s a girl but her whole personality. She’s far more loving and loves to bake with Nana Molly and spending time with her cousin Rose. She loves nail polish and ribbons. Merlin helps the boy who wants to date my little girl.” Harry said, his protective father instincts coming forth.
“What did you do?” he snapped, the sting in his fingertips having reduced to a tingle.
“Now, now, where are your pure-blood manners? You know better than to ask the price of a gift!” Harry chastised for Draco’s glare. He loved riling up his boyfriend.
A few days later Harry walked into Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and pulled both twins into a rough hug, handing them each a bottle of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky.
Christmas Day passed in the usual blur. Even after two years of dating Harry, Draco was still getting used to the abundance of it all. He’d been accepted into the Weasley family, even if Harry didn’t know about the threats to his physical wellbeing if he hurt Harry. By Christmas night they were far too tired to do more than cuddle under the covers and get ready to do it all again the next day.
“I’ve always wanted to thank her, but I didn’t think she had wanted to speak with me, after what my family did to hers.” Pulling Draco into his arms, Harry accio’d the handmade quilt over them.
“Maybe later we could try a corset? It would pull his waist in beautifully.” Harry wasn’t sure who was more excited about that prospect, her or him, but the imagery was stunning.
“I think we’re going to have to make some room for your lingerie, I think we’re going to be regular visitors at Astoria’s lingerie shop.”
Harry crawled closer and made Draco look at him.
“Anti-tampering charm. Hands off until we open it together, I want to see your reactions.” Harry walked over and picked up the bag, removing the spell and handing it to Draco.
’ Harry couldn’t help thinking as Draco nibbled his way up the side of Harry’s neck and nipped his earlobe, sending shivers through his body. Harry didn’t even bother trying to hold back how this was affecting him but there was no reason to, he could feel Draco’s own need nestled alongside his own. Thick and heavy it felt fucking amazing rubbing alongside Harry’s own erection.
“What’s so funny?” Harry asked, close enough to make Draco jump startled. The messy-haired git just grinned.
-Potter, who was fucking him, his childhood enemy turned lover, the flex of his shoulders and stomach as he gripped Draco’s hips and lazily fucked him. Harry clearly wasn’t in a hurry either, he was taking his time, his thrusts strong and deep but not hurried, enough to make Draco gasp and groan at the sensation of being so full, Harry was no slouch in the endowment department either.
“You are so damn gorgeous,” Harry slipped his hand under the silk and stroked Draco’s bare flesh, weighing the softness of Draco’s balls in his hands, slowly sliding his hand up the shaft to the weeping head before retracing the same path, with the same deliberate slowness. He could feel the slight tremor under his hand and Draco’s breathing quickening with his arousal. Harry repeated the movement, but this time over the silk, Draco’s gasp was approval enough that he was enjoying what Harry was doing to him, well that and his rapidly hardening cock.
“Course not, wouldn’t dream of it,” Harry dried off and pulled on an old pair of flannelette pyjama bottoms and an old t-shirt and walked out to their room. Sure enough, on the small table near the French doors, was a bowl of soup, a pile of buttered toast and two mugs of tea.
“I know Gin, I’m really happy for you, he’ll be a far better husband than I ever was,” Harry admitted with a small, sad smile. He did love Ginny, he had since he was a boy. Unfortunately, they had grown apart and had decided to divorce five years ago. Not that it made the slightest bit of difference to the Weasley’s. Harry was still part of the family and he considered Ginny one of his best friends. He knew for a fact that she and Hermione were trying to set him up with someone. He could do without that, his two best girlfriends setting him up on a blind date. It was the stuff of nightmares. He shuddered lightly at the thought.
* * *
“Yes, I’m going to feel it later but… I don’t mind.” Draco’s wince, however, gave him away to Harry’s light chuckle.
“Hey Gin, Blaise, thanks for the invite,” he said as he shook Blaise’s hand. Harry had been sure he would not like Ginny’s fiancé but surprisingly enough, they got on well.
“In the bathroom, come on, a soak with do us both good,” Harry helped Draco to his feet, hiding his small grin at how wobbly Draco was, and led him into the bathroom. Steam was still rising from the water and the smell of Patchouli mingled with the sweet smell of hot chocolate. Harry had put two large towels beside the mugs and carefully stepped into the hot water and made himself comfortable.
“Come on, come on, Santa’s been, get up!” he said grinning, his hair a bright turquoise.
“No way, you are fucking joking! Six years since you had sex? Your right hand must be your best friend!”
Lightly Harry stroked over the warm, responsive skin beneath his seeking fingers. Toying with the soft head and stroking the shaft to Draco’s shuttered breath. Harry couldn’t take his eyes off him, as Draco’s eyes darkened to the colour of a stormy sky, the lust apparent as Harry played with him.
“What are you thinking about?” Harry pressed. Draco was clearly miles away.
“Don’t stop,” Harry begged unsteadily, he was so close to coming. They hadn’t fooled around like this for ages. Sure, the sex was fantastic, but there was something to be said for fooling around like a pair of horny teenagers. Harry knew Draco was close as well, he was losing that smooth rhythm he usually had, and the jerking was becoming well jerky.
“Hmmmm good,” Harry sighed, happy to let Draco take charge this time. His grip was tight enough to make it good, but not so tight they’d come too quickly. Harry was captivated watching the heads poking out from the end of Draco’s fist, and then disappear again, their pre-come pooling on Harry’s stomach. “Don’t stop.”
“Oh, shut up, where’s my hot chocolate?” Draco demanded to scowl at Harry who laughed at him.
“What about the girls, or boys, who want to date your sons?” Draco asked, the bottle was just about finished and they were both well and truly feeling the effects, no way they would be having such a personal conversation otherwise.
“So…orry.” Harry stuttered, and Draco could not stay mad at him. He could guarantee that some down on his luck wizard was now sporting a new warm winter coat.
“What if the storm doesn’t pass? That’s the beginning of a blizzard out there, in case you were unaware and we’re in the middle of the Scottish Highlands.”
“Fuck yes” Harry hissed at the sensation of Draco filling him as he wrapped his hand around Harry’s cock. It was sensory overload and Harry knew he’d not last too much longer so he slowed down. Rocking his hips to their mutual gasps, it was the perfect angle so Draco’s cock head rubbed over Harry’s prostrate on each thrust. Normally it took a fair bit of manoeuvring to manage such a thing but clearly, Draco was just the right size to manage it easily.
The feeling of Draco’s hands in his hair, urging him on, and the gasps, mutters and moans spurred Harry on. Pulling back, he concentrated on the soft head, gently sucking on it and swirling his tongue around the groves and bumps. Gently squeezing his balls and trailing kisses down to the base. He loved the way Draco’s cock jerked to his touch with arousal. Kissing back to the head again, Harry once again took Draco to the base, swallowing around the head to his muttered curse.
“Better?” Draco asked sipping his tea, he was curious about Harry’s nervousness. It was in stark contrast to the man Draco knew from work. He had seen Harry stand up and argue his case in front of the whole Wizengamot without notes and not hesitate once, truly it was a sight to behold, Harry Potter arguing his case. Honesty Draco thought he was wasted as an Auror, Harry would have made a first-class Wizengamot member.
“I want you,” Harry said, crawling back up his body and boldly kissing Draco to his approval.
“What do you mean?” Draco demanded, scowling and bouncing off the bed to stand in front of Harry.  Arms crossed over his chest.
“Well he’s such a posh snob, he needs posh undies, and it doesn’t look like you mind.” Harry could not control his blush. It was an unwritten rule amongst the adults, no sex at the Burrow. It was just too weird. Luckily, they were are only staying until Boxing Day.
“Fuck, so good,” Draco whined, frustrated at not being able to touch, but also turned on. The bastard was taking him right to the edge, his orgasm looming and then backing off again.
Draco moaned into the kiss as Harry twined his fingers into his hair and lightly tugged to Draco’s delight. He loved the sting as Harry devoured his mouth, tugging his head into position and reducing Draco to a quivering mess.
“Reward?” Harry asked puzzled. The man was getting an epic blow job, what else did he want?
“From the look of that.” Draco pointed to the sky, “A blizzard is about to blow in and we do not want to be caught outside in it, our friends will be digging us out when it blows over if that is the case.”
“Yes, oh fuck yes, Potter. I want to feel you stretching me wide...”
His body hair was so pale it looked as if Draco had none, except around that impressive cock where the hair was a darker blond. Harry wanted to make this memorable, who knew if they would get a second chance. Harry knew he would be wanking to this memory for years to come.
Sure, enough Draco was waving his hand in the air and blowing on his fingers. Harry leaned on the door jamb and grinned.
“Morning,” warm arms wrapped around Draco’s waist as he made pancakes.
“You’re my Christmas present Malfoy, you’re not going anywhere, yet!” He was right, they were too old to be fucking on the floor, however, it had been fun. Grinning Harry couldn’t wait to horrify Hermione and Ron at their New Year’s Eve party. Maybe he’d even bring Malfoy.
Sleepy mutterings of “Merry Christmas” and “Morning” echoed through the house as excited kids and sleepy adults descended the stairs.
“Oh no, I rather like you gift wrapped for my enjoyment,” the look Draco gave him was murderous but that just cranked Harry’s amusement higher. He’d have to thank Santa later, much later.
“He chose you?” Harry asked, puzzled, pulled into Draco’s story despite himself and Draco was right about one thing, he was a cute little owl. Right now, he was purely a bundle of feathers, but Harry didn’t doubt that he would turn into a beautiful barn owl.
“He’s not going to fall for it,” Draco put a small plate of meat in front of them “Here, he’ll like this far more,” that was clearly much more acceptable, and the little owl never nipped Harry’s fingers when meat was on offer.
He had his head tilted so Harry could scratch under his chin, soft fluffy baby feathers soothed by Harry’s fingers.
“Are you going to corrupt me on the lounge, again are you?” he asked grinning as Draco took his glasses off and put them out of harm's way, this close Harry could still see him clearly enough to see that wolfish grin that never failed to turn his insides to mush.
“You knew that would happen,” Harry nudged Draco out of his way, and put the kettle on. “I’ve never had a baby owl before, Hedwig was fully grown when Hagrid gave her to me. He’s all fluff.”
It was freezing as he and Harry apparated to the field out the back of the Burrow. The Quidditch rings visible in the darkness. He hoped they would wake up to a white Christmas tomorrow. After stomping the snow off their boots, both men were enveloped in Molly’s hugs. The kitchen smelled of Molly’s famous Christmas cake and chocolate.
“The kids seeing Draco’s French knickers,” Fred told his twin to his laughter.
“Oh, fuck Harry, I’m so close, please I need to come, need you to, oh fuck, please, more.”
Hermione came over to give Harry a kiss while Ron gave him a thump on the back in greeting. They were Harry’s favourite people in the world, and it felt good to see them again.
* * *
Harry jumped startled as he felt his pocket vibrate and then grinned to Draco’s annoyance.
“I didn’t think of the kids, but that would be far worse,”
Harry loved giving head, love the sensation of making someone lose control under his teasing. Besides the actual fucking it was his favourite thing to do and the fact that Draco was tied up and couldn’t touch just added that extra spice. Harry had been accused of being a kinky fucker in the past and it was not something he could deny.
“Could I interest you in a nice hot bath and a mug of hot chocolate?” Harry was not above bribery to get Draco to stay the night.
“Come for me,” Harry growled in Draco’s ear, leaning over him and trailing kisses up his spine to his shoulder. “I want to feel you lose control as I send you over the edge.” Harry wasn’t far off himself; he could feel it building in his lower belly, the pressure that he was trying to hold back, for how long he wasn’t sure.
“Bastards,” Harry said laughing, but he could not get the image of Draco’s pale skin starkly contrasting to those red silk knickers, he’d be stunning. Draco also could not tear his gaze away; they were beautiful and so soft, he thought, stroking the silk. Draco shoved them back into the box. He knew he’d be thinking of them all day.
Outside, in the night sky, two shooting stars finally crashed into each other in a spectacular display of sparks.
Somehow, over the years, they had all ended up as friends of a sort. So Harry couldn’t avoid Draco nearly as much as he would have liked.
Getting his breathing back under control, Draco turned his head to grin at Harry. He had never quite felt this happy after a bout of energetic fucking before. He couldn’t get the grin on his face under control.
“Less talk, more action, Potter!” Draco grumbled as they reached the bed and he forcefully shoved Harry down onto it so he fell in a sprawled heap across the mattress. Taking full advantage of the situation Draco dragged his socks off, grateful Harry had taken his snow boots off earlier and attacked his clothes until Harry lay there in just his red boxers, a cheeky grin and nothing else.
He admitted as Harry teasingly licked him, unerringly found that super sensitive dip under the head and Draco whimpered at the pleasure. He desperately wanted to touch, but the ribbons prevented him, all he could do was feel and it was a unique experience. Once he’d like to repeat - often.
* * * * *
“I thought that was you, Draco?” Harry queried taking a beer from Ron. The glare he received brightened Harry’s mood significantly. They may not be children any longer but some things never changed and riling up Draco Malfoy was one of life's simple pleasures.
, preferably while you have your fingers deep inside me, stretching me for your cock." Draco’s voice was a husky tease, causing the said cock to twitch in appreciation of his blunt statement.
“Fuck me once you've made me come, I need to feel you inside me, please?” Draco had hardly got his request out before Harry was kissing him again, tongue teasing Draco’s. Breathlessly Harry rested his forehead against Draco’s.
Draco knew to beg wouldn’t do any good, Harry would drag out his frustration even further, he’d done it before. Harry’s nipping at his arse and kissing up his thighs was driving Draco crazy, and there was not a damn thing he could do about it. His moan of arousal echoed around the room as Harry started to play with the plug, pushing it further in and then pulling it partially out only to shove it back in hard. Draco could not keep quiet; he was turned on beyond belief as Harry was also slowly stroking him through the silk in time to the slow fucking.
“I see you made it, mate,” Ron grinned as he put his arm around Hermione’s shoulder, tucking her protectively against his side.
“My room is upstairs, I’m sure you can walk that far?” not waiting for an answer Harry led Draco by the hand upstairs to his room.
“You’re a kinky bastard,” Draco tried to laugh it off but damn Harry and his dirty mouth, it always got Draco so worked up, and of course he knew it.
Before Harry could remind Draco yet again that he didn’t want another owl, Draco cut him off, “Yes, I know all the excuses Harry, but look at him? You can’t send him back to the owlery, after all, he chose me, he’s a clever little owl,”
“The what?” Draco asked puzzled to Harry’s light chuckle.
“Well not really, I was thinking maybe black?” he really should have been better prepared, Harry followed Astoria over to the far wall of the store. Row upon row of things he had no names for.
“So, how can I help you today? A special occasion? After something pretty? Spice up the love life?” she asked with a wink and Harry couldn’t prevent his chuckle.
“I figured you’d not stopped all day,” Harry put the mug down and leaned down to give Draco a quick kiss. “Bad day?”
“Fuck me, hard, don’t hold back, I won’t break.”
“Tea?” Harry asked, both to warm them up and to give him something to do, to get his mind off the far too attractive man he was snowed in with. Without waiting for an answer, Harry walked over to the small kitchen area and filled the kettle, putting it on the hob to boil. Mugs, tea bags and sugar were no problem but of course no milk. Harry turned to let Draco know and was very glad he wasn’t drinking or he would have choked.
