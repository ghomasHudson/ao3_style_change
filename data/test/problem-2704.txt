“We’d love to have everyone there”
Draco sobbed while leaning his phone on a mug on his table to continue talking. He was even hiccuping repeatedly, with tears streaming down his burning red cheeks, his nose was runny with snots and his face was wet from the tears
“Are your feet sore?”
Harry said in his ear, his nose nudging at Draco’s hair “
He slid the shirt off Potter gently so he wouldn’t cause any further pain. Draco’s mouth parted when he saw the bruising upper arm, it was all swelled up and discoloured “Do you feel any tingling feeling on your arm?”
“Well, he’s nicer than before” She said, it was amazing how he could hear everything they said from where he was sitting “Plus, he’s one of the people with highest scores. Zabini is also good but he’s already tutoring Ron”
“You haven’t answered my question”
“Anyone want to swim?” Pansy suggested “Before dinner?”
point is, you two broke up, he’s a jerk, he doesn’t deserve you”
” Ron winked at Harry before disappearing. Harry exhaled loudly and walked up the stairs, since Draco has a date, he didn’t have to cook dinner for two as always, he figured maybe he could take a shower and finished some paperwork left from today. As he strolled in the hallway, he could hear the low humming of Draco, the blond has a habit of humming songs while he was in the shower, he loved that about Draco. Harry quickly grabbed a somewhat dry towel up from his bed and got back to the hallway once he heard the door being opened.
Pansy grabbed Hermione’s hand and ran out of the guest bedroom, back into the living room, which was still filled with music and people talking “What are you planning to do?”
Draco asked when Ron was the one to sit in front of him “You’re married”
Narcissa wears the pants in the relationship now I said what I said 👀
something “Wait, are you serious about this?”
“Well I
Pansy tugged on Harry’s shirt and whined, stomping her feet on the ground like a kid “Come on, okay, there are two others options for you”
“Oh, no, this is actually nice” Potter smiled while looking at it “It’s a good…house”
skinny” He looked down at himself, maybe he was a little skinny, just a little bit. He lost his appetite a while ago, and no matter which fancy meal Pansy brought to him, he couldn’t bring himself to eat it. His clothes were now slightly bigger for him. And since Pansy pulled him out of his place quickly, he could only put on a simple pair of robes he hadn’t worn for half a year
“No, I don’t think so” He answered truthfully, he just wanted some actual peace now “I’ll just go and pack my things to go back to my parents”
” Theo shut his eyes when he felt something wet in his entrance.
“Hey, busy day?” Pansy asked once Draco arrived at their booth, Harry looked up at the blond and soon realised he was smiling at him, who was still in his Healer robes
“I didn’t get to do Neville” He pouted “Guess what month he got?
?” Draco let go of his fingers and asked innocently, his eyes starry and full of desire. Harry huffed out a breathy laugh and picked Draco up again, feeling Draco hugging him tighter as they went up the stairs, maybe they could take a shower, or a nap, or ready for the next round. Harry could think of a million ways and places to do Draco, but now, Harry only cared about being with him, nothing else matters anymore, because there was only one thought engraved in his mind right there and then…he
“We are not, just a little bit” Harry said in his raspy voice, the same voice that always held Draco back in their bed. Sometimes he knew Harry did this on purpose but he couldn’t resist this urge against his boyfriend with high libido. Draco met his lips halfway for a chaste kiss and grabbed at his gifts tightly so they wouldn’t fall.
“I’m glad” Potter said, sighing in relief and leaning himself on the table “Er, why were you so late? It’s past midnight now”
“What are you doing?”
“Well, he was a patient” Draco said softly, putting the spoon in the bowl and locked his hands together. If Harry looked closely, he could see that Draco’s hands were shaking, he wasn’t sure why Draco was so nervous “He stayed at St. Mungo for weeks and, uh, he insisted on bringing me on a date every time I examined him. And well, after a while, I said yes. Er, but turned out, it was quite nice”
” He gripped Potter’s bicep tightly and bit on his ear tenderly “
“Hi, I’m Lilian” She smiled at him, he kinda felt like he was giving her hopes if he didn’t tell her he was gay. He waited until the waiter placed their drinks down before speaking
” Potter mumbled the last three words quietly but Draco still heard it, he could feel the blush creeping up his cheeks and damn Potter for making him look like that
“Don’t you have a three years old son with Hermione Granger?” Lucius pointed at her and Pansy froze there, that was true, Harry and Draco were the only couple left who haven’t gotten married yet “He’s going to have to get married soon, and preferably to a Pureblood”
“It’s alright, they can watch us from afar, there’s a restaurant near the beach too” Pansy reassured her wife “Then they can join us after?”
“She’s right there, Ginny” He pointed at Luna, who was standing with Padma Patil “And how many glasses have you drank?”
“You’re serious?”
“Said the person who decided to jerk me off when they were still out there” Blaise said, wiping some of the come off Ron’s face “Want to go home together?”
“Maybe I am” Harry said as Draco snickered, picking up his bag from the floor and they continued walking down the hallway “So, just to be clear…” Harry said as Draco noticed his friends squealing at him from afar and he tried to ignore them “When Ron saw Oliver Wood and Percy in the Quidditch changing room years ago…”
“Remember what?”
“Right, bring in the
“I’m just tired, that’s all” He rubbed his eyes and they kept walking in the hall, that was it, the plan was over
” Draco burst into more tears and grabbed another pillow to hug, his ex
“Sure, I’ll call you again tonight to ask, just in case, and I’ll tell you the information for the party, if you decide to come” Potter gave him a smile,
it. The blond shrugged and turned around, sitting on Harry’s lap, kneeling on the chair of the booth so that his knees touched the chair and his thighs wide open. It was a weird position, but if he put his feet on the ground, it would be hard for him to ride Harry later, not that he was thinking about it
“When I borrowed your computer, I did some searching,
“There’s Celeste, you know her right?” Hermione asked, earning a nod from Draco. Just from the way the corner of his lips slightly moved, like it was almost a sneer. Pansy smirked, Draco hated that chick too “And well, there’s Cormac”
Theo moaned when he felt a finger was pushed inside along with the Auror’s tongue
“And why?” Pansy nudged him “And don’t think I didn’t see your behaviour today, you avoided him
“Aren’t you gonna join anyone?” Pansy spoke next to him, startling the blond. He cleared his throat and shrugged
“Don’t be such a wuss, Ron” Ginny said from outside the circle, she was smirking at him as he grumbled.
“None of your business, now please put this one”
I can ask Luna to make it, I’ll wear it everywhere”
Draco smiled at her words and shook his head
“You know the drill” Hermione said to Harry, but her fingers tapping on Pansy’s back from behind so Harry didn’t see. It was bloody Morse code, luckily Pansy had learned it just to woo Hermione in, sometimes they communicate with it, especially when they were scheming something in secret.
“Oh right” Draco said “Sit down” He gestured and glanced at Harry one last time before focusing on Seamus
“Okay, who’s next?” Pansy said when Ron finished his part “May?”
“I’m being followed, help” He mumbled and pressed his face to the guy’s firm chest, he was still scared. But as soon as the guy hugged Draco back, he felt warm and secure, he didn’t know why exactly, it just happened.
” Pansy shrieked from afar and Draco ignored, he just didn’t care, the only thing he was focused on now was Potter’s smile, it was bright, and beautiful. Recently Draco has been able to crack that smile on Potter’s face, when Potter laughed at his attempt to be funny, Draco felt a spark in his heart, it was one of the things Draco likes about him, the fact that Potter’s smile can light Draco’s heart up, like candles in a dark room
“She kinda scared Ron into persuading Blaise” Hermione smiled and shook Draco’s hand “I’m glad you two are here to keep me safe, it’d be awkward if it was any other strange Aurors”
Harry gripped Draco's arm and gently tugged the other man towards him, holding him tight as Draco's sorrows drained out.
As Harry continued the chant, Severus picked up the jug and began covering Harry from head to toe, the slime slithering down his arms and legs, encasing his body in a chilly membrane that could slip within the cracks between the worlds.  Harry blushed as Severus ran his hands over his penis and into the crack of his bum, and stifled a giggle as he coated the bottoms of his feet.  Then it was Harry's turn and as Harry covered the taller man, he chanted and thought of home.  Of where he belonged.
to be selfish.
and the heat soaked into the muscles of his back, stinging the bruises lining his chest.  He'd been pleased to see Draco at the Stumbling Leprechaun last night.  It had taken time, but Harry had gotten to know him, and his snooty self-absorbed attitude had mellowed with time.  Sure, Draco still didn't raise high the sceptre of modesty or humility, but he wasn't a bad type, either.  Then Ron and Hermione left, and then Ginny, and only he and Draco had remained.  Drinking far too much.
Slowly, he pushed open the door, but all he could see was blackness, an impenetrable dark that might have been Peruvian Darkness Powder it hovered so thick.  Then, a flash of light, a sudden sinking feeling in his belly, and he quite suddenly passed out.
Potter looked up at the painting, his gaze reaching back into some past that swam in sadness and Draco swallowed his regret for asking.  "Yes," Potter said.  "He was."  He turned away from the art piece and entered the kitchen.
"So, this is where the creative genius makes his masterpieces," Draco drawled, smothering just how amazed he really was.  He was a man of masks and it wouldn't do to appear too impressed.
"That pain, it was nothing.  This hole in my eye, the patch sucking the power from Voldemort's soul.  I hurt all the time."  Harry says this with a casual air that can't be real.
"Fine, you trust Loony.  I would take Loony over fucking Potter anyway.  Do you know what?  He came onto me!  In my kitchen," he pointed sharply towards the room behind him.
"Now, when you're calm, we can talk.  Until then, just shut your lips."  She turned away from him and Draco realized the struggle she was under and he wondered if she wanted to hug him or kick him and suddenly he felt contrite.
Harry stopped talking and peered at Ron's face in the green flames.  "Why are you telling me?  Go tell Draco."
Draco almost said, but he held his tongue.  Feelings flashed that stirred his body, memories of when Harry'd kissed him, and he tried to ignore those and convince himself that was
After a full night attempting to categorize the piles of parchment and paper, filing, organizing, and attempting to decipher Hermione's shorthand—neither an easy nor enjoyable task—Harry knew he could not tackle this project without help.  He had jumped into the job with such enthusiasm, finding a worthy hole to dump his vast energy into, positively sure there would be something immediately helpful and gratifying to be discovered in Hermione's notes, but his hope and energy were wasted, again.
Weasley looked him over, and Draco felt the need to clean himself.  A furrow appeared between his eyes as Weasley went through the obviously trying process of thinking, but it was Lovegood who said, "He wasn't in bed this morning."
Hermione's hand did get better, but it took time.  She suffered quite a bit of pain, but stoically kept on, fulfilling her part in the preparations for the final assault on Voldemort.  Harry, though, came out of the experience with a new scar and full access to all of his immense power.
He didn't know what to do, so he just smiled back.
"Run!  Merlin fucking God not again!" Harry screamed, digging into his eyes with his fingers and red lines began etching their way along Harry's pale skin.  "Run!" and this time Draco did.
book that listed them.  Only he and I could read it.  It involves the solution, or potential solution, to the equation in the corner.  Initially I worked a few out on my own, but then after Severus figured out I cracked the code and hadn't taken it to Voldemort, he brought me in.  So I would assume Hermione's key is somewhere around here, hidden in plain view.  The key connects the equation to the actual spell that translates the code."
Draco looked at Harry again.  "Yes.  He is alive.  But he asked me to keep his whereabouts a secret.  He doesn't want to be bothered, Harry."
Harry's hand, balled into a fist, tightened against his belly.  It looked about ready to claw out his guts, he was so strung with tension.  With another few steps Draco stood within reach of Harry, dropped the note onto a nearby table, and still Harry did nothing but watch him.  As Draco brushed his fingers against Harry's hand, it immediately unfurled.  Wrapping their fingers together, Draco lifted the man's hand to his lips and kissed each knuckle.
Draco knew that somewhere, somehow, he'd missed the plot-thread and by the look on Lupin Jr.'s face, he was reading the same bad tale.
Harry struggled to ignore the people.  Sometimes, the scent of them would coat the roof of his mouth, and his eye teeth
Harry leans against the coaming, that grin still playing on his lips, chapped yet full.  Draco forgets himself and readily smiles back.
"I've no idea.  It could be anything," Pansy said.  "But I expect you can discover the cause, Draco.  It's your gift from the gods, to figure out the shite none of us can."
"It's not," Draco said, avoiding his eyes.
And as Harry's eyes lingered on Draco's crotch, he saw that not only was the vision suggestive, the position and circumstance must have been as well, because a noticeable bulge strained against the tightened fabric of Draco's trousers.
His long coat fluttered against his calves as his advancing strides parted the gathering crowd, separating the onlookers like a Merlin's Day Parade.  It was a warm, early May afternoon, and the Alley was packed.
It wasn't hard for him to imagine the how, really; Muggles lost themselves in the city all the time, on purpose and on accident.  What really nagged Harry was why.  He and Malfoy had become… friends of a sort.  And they'd talked about things, future things, like catching a match or touring the Romanian Dragon Reserve.  Then Malfoy had gone off on this conference and vanished.  The conference organizers had lost him, and he'd never contacted Harry or his other friends.  Harry knew, he'd checked, even though Pansy had wondered why in Salazar's name Harry was looking for Draco Malfoy.
want to hear.
"Hey, Draco!"
And Draco started at that thought.  Why would he do that?  Why would he go digging in his deeply buried past, long forgotten, for Potter of all people?
"For what?" Severus asked.  Draco looked down at Tufts.
Minutes slipped by as they continued down the steep grade and a soft noise finally tickled Harry's modified hearing. It was musical, like a hundred sopranos singing in melodic unison. Harry didn't recognize the words and wondered if it was mermaid song.
"Yep."
Caught in blubbering reaction they stumbled over each other's words.  "You go first," "No, you, what were you going to say?"  Finally, they stood in silence, gawking, and Draco, overcome with a bout of shyness, had an urge to tear his eyes away.
"Who else could keep you warm?  Who else would you let warm you?"
He pounced out and shook, raining the entire Bath in little droplets of water.  Turning to spy on Draco, Harry rubbed himself dry with a towel.  Draco leisurely washed himself with a cloth and some bubbles.  "Use a Pensieve, Potter, it will last longer."  Harry almost turned away in alarm, but the tone wasn't scornful, but playful, and he realized, in a burst of self-awareness, that Draco was flirting with him.
The gathering grows quiet.
"Sure," came the quiet voice.  The American beamed like he'd unexpectedly won the jackpot.
Lucius nodded, smiling at his prodigy of a son who had returned to him.  He turned his back on Draco as he poured the drinks.  A sign of trust he would soon pay for.  "I must say," he said, "I was beginning to lose hope, though I was impressed with some of your strategy.  The manor was a terrible loss, however.  That, my son, was a waste."  He lifted the drinks and turned towards Draco, who'd finished the last swoop of his wand and then drove his mind into his father's.
Then the door banged open and Harry stepped in.  His chest rose and fell, heaving with breath like he'd ran up the three flights to the room, and the brilliant green of his eyes reflected the weak light of his wand that he pointed inside.
“I tried.  When I was first here.  I used a spoon, and tried to dig around the bars, but the foundation is firm.  You got another idea?”
"What, are we children?" Draco asked. "Why're we retiring so early?"
Harry stood around, agitatedly fiddling with the frayed sleeve of his winter robes, pacing like a caged griffin in the brilliantly lit club when the deep voice alerted him.  "Mr. Malfoy will see you, sir."
And it struck. First it hit the metal chair, leaving a charred hunk of chrome and steel, then the desk was the next casualty, all melted and twisted from the terrible heat. The look of fear in this fool's eyes tasted sweet and Harry drank it up.
"Potter!  Don't leave.  I need to talk to you.  I know it's you.  Please!" he pleaded, but Harry disappeared into the crowd.
"You can't leave…" he began, but a quick pulse of Draco's grip pushed the next few words out in a rush, "without fulfilling the Law."
"Sure thing," Potter called after him and then looked at Draco.  The silence that settled was crisp and entirely out of Draco's control.  This wasn't how he dealt with law breakers.  He opened his mouth to speak, but Potter beat him to it.
"Yeah.  Shall we?" Lily asked.  As Draco offered his arm, Lily stood and took it, and then they walked out of the building.
The voice was high, tinny, and full of amusement.
"How should…?" he asked.
Harry chuckled and shook his head.  "No."  He proceeded to cast a series of spells on the roses, from a Deflating Charm to a Burdening Hex, but finally it was his Magic Disruption spell, a fair bit of magic if he did say so himself, that finally dropped the flowers with a dead 'thump' on the clean desktop.
Harry reached out and brushed his fingers over Draco's hair.  Draco hmmed, leaning into the touch.  "I know," Harry said.  "And that's why I like him.  It's all ingenuity.  He's smart and inventive."
Harry nodded eagerly.
"She's fine.  She and Zabini are talking about moving in together."  Harry had dipped to grab the latest volley, but stalled in mid-motion, his mouth open like a waiting hippopotamus.  The nut had sailed over his shoulder and tinged against the painting of the Scottish highlands hanging behind him.
He followed after them, realizing that things would never be the way they had been.  And that was good.  He followed after them and the promises they held.  In a way, he was mad.  Mad for them.  Mad for hoping.  But he didn't care.  With them he wanted to burn, burn, burn and live.  Like he'd never allowed himself to do before.  Live like people who had nothing and everything to lose, like vagabonds who rode across the world on touring brooms and each time they burned out their charms, they'd laugh and say 'bugger' and enchant the broom again to keep on going.
It was three in the morning, and Draco had been swept up in one of those dreams where he'd done more against the Dark Lord, stood up against the Carrows, and had not been a bloody coward, striving only to save his family and his own arse.  It was the kind of dream where he'd listened to Dumbledore, and there'd been a use for him.  Where he hadn't merely been baggage.
With a sigh, Harry turns away, the weight of an honest answer pressing on his shoulders like the weight of the world's expectations.  "It's a long story… But it's the last trace of Voldemort's soul."
Draco's head snaps to look over at Harry, his gaze challenging, brow bunched in disbelief.
"Well, I met a kid version of you, and we built a wall. I gave him the skill, and he put in the power." He reached out to the golden dragon and could feel it inside Harry, feel a tiny hand gripping that portion of him he left behind. "If it looks like the wall will fail, I will try to help sustain it." He shrugged, unsure of exactly how to explain what he'd just done.
"No problem, Draco," he said.
Laura joins in.  "Oh come on, Harry," she says to his disapproving look.  "It's funny."
Ron nodded.  "Oh Harry, that's terrible," he mimicked Harry's tone, then, "So, it wasn't any good.  Bugger."
"Thank you for such a deep and thoughtful compliment.  Come with me; I shall show you where you will be staying."
"Come on, Harry."  The tone to her words was dangerously bordering on a whine, and Draco knew that there was no way Harry could hold out much longer.  There were many things that he knew about Harry; his lack of willpower to a full throttle Hermione whine was just one of those things.  "Just one date.  What will it hurt?"
Laughter filled the room and Draco sighed in relief.
The two men stared at each other.
With a contemplative crinkle in his eyes, Harry turns to Luna.  She cocks her head and offers a ghost of a smile.  "Well," she says, "If his understanding is less than expected—" she shrugs, "—perhaps a sleepover is in order."
Harry reached out and brushed Draco's hair, barely ghosting his fingers over the fine strands, causing them to glide under his skin. Then he drew his fingers down the side of Draco's face, and Draco leaned into the touch, his eyes half-closed with a smile on his lips like a contented feline. With gentle anticipation, Harry leaned forward and kissed him.
"We'll have to think of your name if you want to stay," Luna says.  "Maybe Plundering Pansy or Buccaneer Parkinson or …"
"I see you've finally grown sick of your own stink."
"The Horcrux released an impressive amount of magical energy, more so than the others….  I couldn't let the knife go until I was sure it was destroyed."  Pain wracked her voice.  "I suppose I should be happy the rest of me didn't suffer the same fate."
There was a pause and Harry worried that they'd been pushed out, past that shield within Hermione's mind again and had lost the tenuous connection they had with her. Then she thought at them again and Harry relaxed at the controlled way she delivered her next words.
"But…"
Draco tried to make sense of the twisted humor of the universe.  He'd obviously been a very evil man in a past life.
"We have so much to tell you, Hermione. Why don't we start from the beginning and then you can ask questions, okay?"
"Of course.  I am Draco Malfoy, vampire extraordinaire with a bite that rocks your socks."  He winked at Harry, who blushed deliciously and laughed at his corny joke.
The walls were covered in shiny sheet metal with black rivets holding the large sheets together. The gray floor was concrete, boasting deep gouges and chips as well as long crevices that held what looked like centuries worth of dust. The room was perhaps a hundred yards long and in the center sat a rickety desk with one folding chair and a pile of cardboard boxes surrounding it on the floor.
be a bit annoyed at a man, even a friend, seeming so friendly with his wife.
“Harry, are you even listening?”
Harry chuckled at the man, then turned back to Wolfwood. "Are you ready to receive them, then?"
Moffy popped in and placed a tea service for three on the table.  Taking her time, Mrs. Malfoy reached for her cup and took a small sip, her eyes half closed.  "Well, we did have a few house-elves to help in your raising, and Draco you can have Moffy if you would like.  She's a trained au pair as well as a maid."
"Draco?  What's going on?"  Harry asked with a dazed slur.
As a young boy Harry'd never traveled, never gone to the park with his father and mother and played.  He'd dodged bullies and hidden away from violence and neglect.  He kept his tears silent while locked away in a tiny cupboard like something broken or out of season.  Dumbledore had assured the skills to survive would be ingrained into his very soul.
Harry's slit eyes rounded, and he quickly shook his head.  "People… I don't like people to touch me," he dropped his gaze, "but you, that's… good.  I like it when you touch me."
"So, you know what those equations mean, then?"
The cute, young mediwitch came in, startling him from his nap, eyes darting to his twin scars instead of lingering there like they had when she first realised who her patient's guest was.  She didn’t bother delivering her flirty smiles and engaging wit anymore after the few short words he'd exchanged with her.  Luckily, she realized a lost cause.
"Thank Merlin you have Granger and Lupin to plan the attacks on Voldemort.  If it were up to you, we would all be sacrificed unnecessarily for minimal gain."  Harry watched as Draco moved his knight to take his bishop.  Damn.  He hadn't seen that.  It hadn't even been a purposeful sacrifice like he'd alluded to when Draco took his last rook.  He was really pants at chess.
"Yeah?"  He returned Draco's gaze.
All those years ago, Harry'd yelled as a ball of black mist swirled around him.  He had gripped at his throat, like he couldn't breathe, and Teddy'd freaked out.  He remembered calling out for Harry over and over, but then Neville had grabbed him and they Disapparated and that was the last he'd seen of his godfather since a month ago.
Was he dead?
for a change.
So caught off guard was the Minister, that he dropped the glasses and they shattered against the floor.  The amber liquid ran into the cracks between wood planks, filling the shallow troughs as Draco filled his father's mind and broke down the charm Lucius had so carefully constructed.
The End
Sitting on the floor next to the pile he picked up one item after another, casting spell after spell on them to determine their function.  A thin, arched disk, deep red and highly polished, was the next item to examine when Draco finally spoke up.
Scorpius crying and he could already guess at the answer.
"Ron, maybe…" Harry tried, but Ron had steam he needed to blow, and Harry knew no cajoling on his part would soothe his pissed off friend. Remus sat calmly by his side. Remus always seemed calm these days and right now it only irritated Harry.
"Am not."
"Mr. Potter, I would like to speak with you for a moment, if you will."
"It's him. He's got my tracking spell on him," Harry whispered. "Let's follow."
BAD OYSTERS BRING HALT TO WIZARD CONFERENCE
After silent minutes passed, Draco stood and surveyed the area.  One Harry Potter crushed under large stone.  No Charlie.  No dragon.  A few empty food wrappers and no water.  A person couldn't survive this long without water!  Draco had to do something.  Water.  Water.  He had to find water.
"What about me?"  Harry asked, a worry line between his brows.
"Is that it?" Harry asked.  "Is it ready?"
"I found a spell.  We can talk about it tomorrow."  Harry guessed that was as good as he was going to get.
"I can take it," he said.
"It is time that we, the British magical population, confront these violent actions.  Harry Potter is a terrorist and our Ministry is mishandling him.  He is not a hero.  He is not someone to cheer, someone in which to offer aid.  His actions breed death and destruction.  More than 300 people have fallen at his hands, been
Wasn't that a laugh?
to himself.  "A tad too grainy, but it will have to do," he mused.
The Ministry has been careening towards implosion with a madman wielding power and a mass of mindless cockroaches following along, surviving in any way they can.  Nobody has a mind of his or her own anymore.  Draco feels terribly alone in his self-awareness.  As he smiles and answers more questions from the reporters, he senses that there is nobody out there like him.
"Okay, fine," she huffed.  "Just think about it.  Eventually, you will explode if you don't give up this work, work, work lifestyle.  I don't want to see you burn out like Neville did," she said and turned to once again join the flow.
"Hello?"  His voice was hoarse and his throat rebelled at that one word.
She smiled brightly at the two men.  "Remember that he loves you and he loves your baby, and both of you, two wonderful and good men, have a lot to pass on.  Know this Harry; I doubt any other child in this current era will be any more loved.  And yes, you will have times when your wonderful, beautiful baby turns into a raving demon," she chuckled, "but every child must find their own place.  Just remember to provide a stable home, a solid foundation for them to return to, and your children will always come back to you even as they become adults and begin their own lives."
"Yes, thank you. I don't want to get lost again." This small admittance slipped out of his lips undirected and he hated that it had.
"Sure," Remus said emerging from the Floo, wincing at the slur that came through in his speech. He stood up straighter, jaw dropping uncouthly as Draco entered the room, all pompous and arrogant as usual. Harry turned to look at Draco, then back at Remus. He seemed rather baffled by Remus' obvious distress, as if he couldn't understand how Draco's presence in Hermione's flat might ever cause a jaw to drop.
Tufts turned back to watch the building and purred.
"No.  I'm not touching that filthy thing."
With an 'I am not amused' look, Remus said, "Well I don't know what you have and haven't tried, Harry.  Basic revealing charms are a good place to start."
."  "
Harry looked up at Severus, his eyes bright in the moonlight and fairy globes.  Then he sighed and a smile overtook his face.  Draco caught his breath at the sight.
"Please, I need your help. My friend, Hermione Granger, has been cursed and going through her notes she mentioned you and that you might help and…"
The feeling was odd, tingly, yes, but also warm and relaxing.  It charged him even as it consumed him.  It was so pacifying that he was totally unprepared for the complete agony that hit him when that warm tingle hit his Dark Mark.
Who he was Draco swore he would discover.
The table wasn't overly burdened by food, and though Harry didn't want to seem like an uncultured pig, the hash browns were so damned good, not to mention the waffles slathered with cream and strawberries, that he found himself sheepishly returning for seconds.
Draco paced all over the office as he spoke, distracting his father with words.  As he walked, he laid a trace of sand along the wooden floor, laying down the sigil Harry had drawn for him.
"How you feeling now?" Ron asked as he went to Remus to check him over.
"Do you want to go talk to them, Harry?  Maybe tomorrow?"
Harry exchanged a glance with Draco and Severus.
Harry blinked at him, then licked his lips.
"Well, maybe he just wants to help out." At Remus' sceptical look, Harry scrambled for another excuse. "You said he wanted friends. And there is that vow he made me swear."
"…certain, Severus?"  It was Remus and the man sounded very worried.
And could the man kiss.  His lips were pliable, but demanding, and that little nip he did on Draco's bottom lip sent signals coursing through to the ends of his fingers and toes, signals that insisted certain bits prepare for more exercise.
.  But if
"Remus." All three men turned to see Kingsley nearby. "Run… get away." Their friend slowly raised his wand. It shook in his grip even as Kingsley continued to speak. "Run, Remus," he begged as a ball of silvery light bubbled from the tip of his wand.
. He looked down the left passage then down the right, blue globes lining both ceilings, their soft glow lighting the passageways. Nothing different. Nothing to separate the two. So, he turned right.
Potter stressed 'you' and Draco had to snort.
Remus sighed.  While the Aurors hadn't bothered him much in recent years, some would come in to poke sticks at the tame werewolf from time to time.  Harry and Tonks often spoke for him and his lack of trouble making seemed to waive these little social visits, but Tonks had been gone for years and now Harry could offer no more help, either.
Harry paused, then thought, "screw it," and wrapped his arms around Draco; a small, female gasp came from behind.  "But you saved me, remember?  You
And then, one slow thrust later, he was engulfed by Harry's heat.  Though trying to be gentle, the part of Draco's brain that thought "take your time" and "go slow" was a small, pixie-sized portion.  His cock was buried in Harry's arse.  His pristine, untouched, virgin arse.  Draco's brain limped along in utter disbelief.  And awe.
"Didn't think so.  If you care about Stephen, you should stop and think about what's best for him… Selfish prick."  Dog Man took a step towards Draco, then stopped.  "Stop harassing him."
"Potter.  Harry Potter.  He's my newest client.  Lynx Animagus."  Draco sighed again.
"Well, Potter. Care to tell me what you can?" He let his eyes graze over the surrounding patrons of the restaurant.
"Hello."  The word seemed to rebound off the walls and slowly slip away, unabsorbed by any ears.  "Hello!"
"Oh, Merlin… Draco," Lily groaned out.  "Yessss."  The word was drawn out so long, it sounded like a hiss.
"No!  Take me!" Draco said, the innuendo not subtle at all.  "Let me out of this hell hole.”  Draco smiled up at Severus, and it was one of those rare, sweet smiles that showed just how much the young man loved him.
He'd also discovered something else important. Something he had to remember. He had to tell Ron, if only he could just focus.
"And you," Snape asked.  "How are you feeling, Harry?"
"Daddy!  Don't go."  The little girl's hands were gripped so tightly, entwined really, with Tufts' fur, that not only a sense of utter dejection, but pain, was coming across their link.
Just as the petals had fallen earlier, silence settled between them.  Frustrated, Harry huffed.  Then he sighed.  He shifted in his chair and waited as Draco sat, casually resting one elbow on the arm of the chair.
He realizes, after this entire fiasco is concluded, he will be forced to refurbish his ego.
"Sometimes it is nice to just let loose.  I'm Aiden."
"Isn't it beautiful?" Harry asked in awe.  Severus squeezed his hand.  Through the shifting colors they saw a form, a person walking towards them.  There was breath-stopping familiarity with the gait of the man's stride as he walked, the lift of his chin as he looked over at them.  Harry's breath stalled.  This was it.
Harry looked up at Remus and his friend nodded at him, offering his support.  Harry nodded back and placed the pot down on the ground in the center of the circle.  Remus stepped over the edge of the circle, and with one final glance behind him, he left the basement entirely.
Harry flinched as the words tried to bend his mind. Tiny tendrils tickled at his untouched corners of thought trying to bypass his strong will and sense of self. But something within him grew heavy, almost like a concern or worry, and then the power of the staff stopped cold, as if it had hit some immovable force.
Doubled over in his own unfortunate repercussion of the spell, Severus finally gripped onto Harry's biceps and tugged him to his feet.  "We are not done," he said breathlessly.  "Get up."
"Okay, so Bumbleton's theory says that if you can pull away one thread of a spell, the rest will collapse.  I can't separate, let alone capture any of the singular data, and I can't face it as a complex unit, so that means I should try to provide a new vessel for the spell to jump to…"
The healers from St. Mungo's, adorned in their lime green robes, arrived and took Hermione away.  Harry and Remus Apparated to the hospital and waited until the sun rose, pacing a hole in the tile floors.  Finally, Mediwitch Periwinkle came out to talk to them.
, but please,
He looked up from the stone he'd been kicking and his breath caught at the sight.  A double rainbow arched over the hills to the south, shimmering in the morning sun.
The man walked forward, his arms out, reaching for Remus. Remus gripped those arms and he was struck with a sense of déjà vu. It all felt so familiar. But he wondered how something so alien could be identifiable, this stark feeling of panic… something he knew so intimately. Sirius gripped tighter, and then Remus became aware that it wasn't this stark landscape or the ever-present panic, it was Sirius, his steadfast support and brilliant invention, the gentle way he guarded those he cared for. Remus remembered it all, in a surprisingly crisp sense of recollection.
Moony growled, the wolf slipping through Remus' firm control, shocking Harry at the utterly feral sound. Moony got to his feet, and began to stalk the man fuelled by dark powers and stolen lives. Scrimgeour stumbled towards Sirius, who'd just reached the remains of the stone cage. Moony growled and lunged at Scrimgeour, ignoring Harry and Draco. Harry realized why he felt no fear from the werewolf, Moony was protecting them.
"But—uhh…" he stammered.  "Nothing happens.  I can't…"  His face grew hot, and it wasn't from arousal.  Severus would touch him and his fucking cock would continue to mimic a wet noodle and he didn't want to disappoint either of them.  His birthday was soon looking like a disaster in the brewing.  He didn't think he could take failing right now.
"No," Minister Scrimgeour said. "I can handle it. You need to return to Mexico. Protect him as he searches."
"What?  Really?  Why would the goblins do that?  Has he really lost his mind?"
"Who?"
They stood in awkward silence and Harry wasn't sure how they'd ended up there.  "So, not so into this Rodger bloke then?"  It took him a few seconds to realize the air was suddenly a few stone heavier.  He'd never been one to avoid pointing out the elephant in the corner.
She looked over at Draco, eyes wide and stiff as if all of her concentration was directed at focusing on Draco's face.  "No."
"What?" he sputtered.
Before Harry can even open his mouth, Draco knows the truth, and nods to himself.
Remus glanced over at the unsure sound of Harry's words. "What is it?" The air was warm and thick with moisture. Remus wore a woven Panama hat to shield his eyes from the bright sun of the early tropical afternoon.
Snape now dressed in trousers and short sleeved shirts, his bite scar a pale ridge across his neck and the Dark Mark leered at Harry, but Harry overlooked that tattoo with casual ease.  It meant nothing, not when Snape had loved Harry's mother; not when he took care of both him and Draco.
"Harry, what's happened to Remus and…?" Ron trailed off, but Harry could hear the unspoken words. And you?
"Really, Ronald, I don't think that Ginny would appreciate such a thought. It isn't like she wants recognition just because she is dating Hannah Abbott. Put down that Pride Flag. Really," Hermione ranted and Ron looked sheepish. Kingsley and Remus shared a look.
"Well, if you don't want me, then never mind…" Suddenly he couldn't believe he would ask such a thing.  Of course he didn't want Harry to touch him; he loved Draco, as Harry loved Draco.  Draco was their center, their core, and they were peripheral.
Snape looked at the other two and threw back his head with a laugh.
"Hermione, focus." Harry forced his words out, thinking them loudly, firmly, but without blowing them all away with the power of it.
"Alright."  She lifted the knife; his last view before he screwed his eyes shut, the candlelight reflected off its metal surface.
The stagnant air held like a waiting breath.
Gears shifted in Remus' brain. Didn't Harry tell him about an Auror who was out to get him with very short hair? The man must have been there undercover. But still, Remus thought it might be an interesting point to pass on.
"Well, that case's important, too."
Harry ran to him.
"You're right, Harry.  I won't keep anything else from you any further.  If you ask, I will tell you."
Harry snorted. "Don't worry," he yelled at Ron. "Keep in communiqué, okay."
He turned from them and went looking for Harry.  He wasn't surprised to find him in the library.
Remus glanced around once more for people, and Disapparated to Ron's tiny flat.
"'Bout time," Pansy called over.  "Sheesh.  Never met anyone more in denial than you."
Then he remembered; he did what he did for himself, not these ingrates.  He was no martyr.  And his trademark sneer replaced the sadness hidden on his lips.
Draco raised his palms in defeat.  "Who knows if I can fix it."
"I thought this was familiar.  Harry, see this equation."
Draco nudged the car with his wand again, and after the telltale spark, it zipped along to the Diagon Alley map and quite plainly parked right on top of Gringotts.
“Yeah, Ginny is
“Hey, look, I don’t know, Luna can be right, she can be wrong, that’s something we’ll never know” Pansy shrugged, scribbling her and Granger’s name inside a heart in her parchment “If I think about it, I don’t think there’s a world where Hermione and I don’t end up together. Oh, do we…are Hermione and I together? In your world?”
“Do you
He waved his wand, pointing at the pair of white shows with small wings on the sides that was hanging on one of the statues on the wall. Draco grabbed it as soon as he heard footsteps arriving “Hi”
Harry said, pushing the hair that fell on Draco’s face away, he thrusted in harder, reaching his prostate every second. Draco’s cock couldn’t stop leaking precum, Harry squeezed his arse apart, slamming in deep and the blond cried out loud. His body was hot from inside, sweats were forming on his forehead, his cock was itching to be released soon “
“I can vouch for that” Pansy interrupted them and snickered “Do I need to make a list?”
“What’s wrong?” Potter asked and he turned around, the Auror only has a towel wrapped around his waist, with water dripping from his wet hair down, his hands were drying his hair with another towel, Draco looked away and didn’t answer. It seemed like every hot guy just has to walk around half naked now.
“I’m sore” He said, and locking his arms and legs around Harry “Carry me up in your bedroom, would you?”
“Nothing”
“Hey, how long is the opera thing?” Potter asked
“Can we all act mature in here?” Draco rolled his eyes and leaned back on his booth “We are 25 already for Merlin’s sake”
” Potter stopped laughing as soon as he asked “No,
“I think we’ve heard enough” Lucius said, turning to look at Narcissa and she gave him an understanding nod, he turned back to stare at Harry, exhaling a long breath “We…will give you our blessings to ask for Draco’s hand in marriage”
“Oh, nothing” Harry grinned and kissed his head again “Just something I have for our date tonight, after we meet your parents”
you will calm down” Hermione said
“But I—…”
kiddo” Harry grinned, carrying their daughter up in his arms, she was holding a stuffed bear that Ron gave her when she turned 5 last March “What are you doing here? Where are your brothers?”
want you to do me right now” He smiled, taking off his shirt in under a second “What if someone caught us?”
“Why did it have my name on?”
“A lot,
“Are you, er, are you going to the party next week?” Harry suddenly wondered, turning to him as Draco stared at him “The one Hermione, Parkinson and other Prefects are hosting?”
He murmured to himself when he saw a lanky guy with dirty blond hair in white see-through shirt and a tight leather trousers that was next to Potter, touching his arm persistently. Potter was wearing a black dropped armhole tank top with jeans, he could even see how muscular Potter became from where he sat. Draco tried to look through the crowd, but it was hard to spot Potter again, he left his stool and went through the crowd. The closer he got, the clearer he saw, and Potter was not at all comfortable with it. In fact, he was trying to decline the other guy nicely, Potter just always have to play nice, Draco sighed annoyingly.
“My hand hurts too, you know, kiss it better?” Harry teased and Draco let out a small chuckle, bringing the back of Harry’s hand up to kiss the rough skin, leaning to the side when he felt Harry pressing kisses to his cheeks, showering him with touches “Harry”
“Well, he was
Draco ran to his door and put on his shoes before running downstairs, he quickly opened the back door of the book shop and locked it carefully and just started running. The street was dark and empty, there were barely anyone walking, and Draco kept sprinting, he would normally be tired of this, but not this time, he has to make it. There was no way in hell Draco’s going to let Potter give up on him. He ran and ran, until he saw the Grimmauld Place, the blond quickly stopped and walked to the doorstep. He has been to this place so much even the house knows him when he comes, it knew that he was allowed, but it wasn’t the point.
“You’re so hot” Roger said in his ear, and Theo rolled his eyes, he had heard enough of that,
“Okay well
men still ogle at me? I am yours, why are you worried? If I’m yours, I’d never let another man touch me. They can look as much as they want, they can never have me. Don’t you get it?” He said, he folded his legs together and looked down “Why do you have to care about everyone else when you could just care about me?”
“It’s just…
“You didn’t tell me”
“You’re spoiling the mood, Harry” Draco said in his ear, one of his hands grabbed Harry’s hand and slid them under his own white shirt while his other hand threatened to pull the Auror’s towel off any second now “Fuck the date, I want you to fuck me now”
“Warming me up or your crotch?” Draco turned his head around to smile at Harry, meeting him in a kiss on his lips “I think I feel something warm under me”
“Well” Theodore stuttered, his eyes looking down “I thought it was you, so I snuggled up with him all night. I told him not to go”
“What?”
” Hermione said while laughing loudly, Pansy was drunk, and she won’t stop making toasts, Hermione brushed herself against Pansy’s arm, she was wearing a backless navy blue cocktail dress, Draco was certain Pansy picked that out for her wife, she even has a small tiara on her hair, she has recently had her hair cut, so it was just as short as Pansy’s, but wavy as always.
He mumbled, looking around but soon he realised his reflection in the mirror weren’t moving after him anymore. Shivers ran down his spine when suddenly Potter held his hand, more like
“I can’t believe you judged us then went and shagged in the lift” Blaise chuckled quietly, his arm wrapped around Ron’s shoulder, he wasn’t smoking anymore
, Harry. Why else would I be in the bedroom half naked with you right now?”
“I found your shoes” He said, giving her the shoes as she sat down on the chair in the hall. When he was in the other world, Luna was the kindest one, Draco got the chance to see her true self without holding any prejudice against her, and it felt nice, she was nice. So she was the first one he decided to apologise for “Do you mind if I talk to you for a bit?”
“Y-yeah, it’s fun” Draco flinched and looked the other way. They have been walking for a while, learning about coffee and cocoa, Hermione was the most excited one in the group, Pansy was just excited because her wife was excited, he didn’t pay attention to Potter, probably because he was trying to avoid him. It wasn’t like Draco did it on purpose, he just didn’t know how to act or what to say anymore, he stuttered like a kid trying to talk when Potter asked him stuff
“You’re lighter than I thought” Potter said, starting to walk to catch up with the girls
Harry started smiling at everyone, nodding and thanking people when they began chanting loudly his name, he never really liked parties
“But—…” He halted when the bell rang and half the room stood up to switch places “Wait…”
“You weirdo” Draco smacked his chest and leaned in, burying his face in Harry’s neck, smelling his spicy scent and suddenly had the urge to bite Harry
“You look cheerful”
” He poked his head out and called, watching Harry jolted and sat up on the bed to look at him
“A bit” Draco replied when Potter sat down next to him “It’s from the walking”
“It’s fine, your friend ran to grab the eye drop right?” The man shrugged and smiled at Draco with one eye closed and one eye opened “I’m Harry by the way. Er, what’s your name?”
“Harry” Draco mumbled
“I know” Neville replied “I know, I’m an idiot, I never let my feelings out because I fear I’d show it too much, you were always with…attractive guys, and rich, and good in bed, and I-I didn’t know if I could compete with them. I was just…I was too worried about the differences between us that I forgot how much I love you, and I neglected your feelings, I’m an idiot, I wish I was braver, I wish I wasn’t so indecisive, I wish I could be better for you”
“What?” Draco sat up, his voice became all serious. It was his intention to make the two of them become a couple, so obviously he wouldn’t want them to not be together. He had seen how Neville and Theodore were with each other from the other world, Neville was treating him like the only one he could see, Theodore did not lay his eyes on anyone else. He wouldn’t want to hurt Neville in the process of this whole thing “You can’t be serious. He treated you like trash”
Draco kept repeating the sentence the other Draco had written for him. The same? What did that mean? Did he mean they might have a chance to be together in this world? Draco touched the letter and leaned back on his pillow behind him. It has been a few days since he got back, and after accidentally calling Potter by his first name, acting all caring when he came in with that bleeding head, Draco started avoiding him. No more insults, no more doing things to get his attention, even the other Draco still kept up with the insults when he was here, Draco just couldn’t do it now. He touched his left ring finger, remembering the moment Harry gave him the ring, the ring that wasn’t meant for him, he was still moved by it.
“I did apologise to Luna, and I want to talk to you too. Is that alright?”
“So, seven?” Harry turned around and gave Draco the brightest smile ever, the blond hasn’t felt this way for a long time, maybe in years “I’ll pick you up”
“I am not going in” He grumbled. It would have been great, their relationship, Draco had woken up that morning with a smile on his face, he seemed happier, then he went to Harry’s office, and the git had no clue what happened. Draco was heart-broken, but he shook it off and did what he need to do…avoid Harry at all costs.
Harry thought in his head once a person appeared in the crowd in front of him. The person was wearing a mask, a gold mask which made it hard for Harry to recognise who this person was. They have a Slytherin robes on and Harry could see their black heels from underneath, it was probably a pair of six inches stiletto. Their smooth long blond hair falling down gracefully to under his chest, they approached Harry’s spot and with a snap of their fingers, their robes fell off the floor. Harry couldn’t help but getting shocked from the guy standing before him now, green tie, his white unbuttoned shirt was tied up half way so it looked like a crop top, showing his slim waist, short black skirt that barely covered his arse when he turned around, fishnet stocking and black heels that complimented his legs, his skin was pale, and when he strut around Harry slowly to the music, he could smell the fresh scent of flowers, jasmine to be exact, and lime. Harry couldn’t find the strength to tear his eyes away from the blond.
“Wait, really?”
“Stop blaming him” Luna finally appeared into the screen, sitting down next to Ginny with a soft smile on her face and her cat in her lap “How can we help you?”
“I’m fine, I’m fine” He grabbed her wrists and calmed her down “It’s
” He murmured between their kisses, biting on his lower lips and tilted his head to the side for Harry to suck on his neck as water trailed down on their soapy bodies, cleaning them along the way “
…really like you too, Harry…

“Did you…bite me?” Harry asked, rubbing his sore shoulder when he saw teeth marks on it
university with him,
“So, er, what do you do? You already know what I do” Harry grinned while grabbing a mug that said “
“Oh, sorry, just sorting out the information”
“I mean you
“I love you, Draco” Harry said, his green eyes staring into Draco’s deepest place in his heart, it felt like the first time he said those words to Draco again, the same feelings, the only thing different now was that it hurts “I still do, I don’t want to lose you, I never wanted to lose you. I don’t even know what I’m trying to say” He stuttered, scratching the nape of his neck as a sign of him being extremely anxious “I know why we broke up, but, I think, I can wait” He looked at Draco with a puppy-like look, like he was begging for forgiveness even when he did nothing wrong “I can wait for you to be ready, I don’t care how long it takes. I just want to be with you, Draco, you’re all that matters to me”
, please just go
“It’s fine, it’s been years”
“Marriage?” Pansy squealed, looking at Ron with the same surprise look he has right now “Isn’t it a bit too soon to discuss? After all, he’s only 26 now, you know, we still want to have fun”
“Fine, one match” Ron said after a minute of standing there, he finally sat down as Draco arranged the chess pieces “I won’t back down”
“I’m not sure” He said, and it wasn’t a lie, he really didn’t know how to do this, if only he picked out ducks like Anthony or a crup like Roger, but
“How did it go?” Pansy sashayed to his spot with a smile “Selling any?”
Draco squinted at the both of them, he was definitely suspicious, but there was no way he’d choose Cormac over Harry, Pansy bet her marriage on it
“Theo’s gonna leave for France? Why didn’t he tell me this?” He did know that Theodore has a huge passion for fashion, but he didn’t he’d leave. What about Neville?
right on the sweater he was wearing with his back arched. Harry was above him, his body trembling with with bliss as he filled Draco up inside. Harry breathed out satisfyingly and looked down at Draco with a smile, planting a soft kiss on the blond’s forehead
“So so-
“What do you do if they don’t love you back then?” His voice broke, tears rolling from his eyes as he couldn’t take it anymore, he hugged her back tightly and just straight up crying on her shoulder “What if you know you can never have them but a part of you still want them? What if-…”
“I’ll go” Blaise said, keeping his eyes on the books. At the party a week ago, Draco saw with his own two eyes, the sight of Blaise comforting Ron. After being scolded by Romilda Vane, Ron had taken his seat on the couch next to Blaise, sitting quietly, and the next minute, he watched Ron spilled everything out to Blaise, who was actually listening, and later, rubbing his back in a reassuring way. It must have been a big step for them, because now, Ron coming to ask him questions about Blaise and then leaving in a hurry became a regular thing Draco encountered every few days.
. So if anything
“Then why are you still eating it?” Harry asked when Draco ‘
” Pansy snapped her finger in front of him and Draco finally was brought back to the present
“No, not at all, I just want to do something nice” He said, placing his hand on his chest “Nothing in return, you can trust me”
“I’m tough” Draco pouted, stepping back to frown at Harry “Don’t you believe me?”
Pansy barged in the room, startling Draco “I was worried sick. I even had to ask bloody Granger to ask the other Prefects if they saw you. You disappeared for three hours straight after we celebrated your birthday”
The little boy, Eddie, immediately grabbed his trousers and smiled at him brightly “
“Don’t give up on me” Draco pushed Potter back and murmured
“Oh, Brandon, this is Harry” Draco introduced him to Brandon and Brandon’s eyes lighten up, not in a good way “Harry, this is Brandon, my…boyfriend”
“Blaise-…”
“You’re awfully wise here, aren’t you?” He chuckled and held Harry’s hand “It just seems impossible”
“Oh, er…”
“What do you think happened to two people studying every day together for more than a month?” He turned to her, watching her expression unfolded “Think about it”
“Wait, really? You all did it?”
?” Draco’s hand came up to touch it before shrugging “Well, guess we were both so lost in it, we didn’t know”
“I’m going” Draco smiled at them, shrinking his tools with a flick of his wand and left the room.
“Er, yeah?”
“Don’t patronise me” Potter snapped at him, his nose scrunching up at the pain on his arm “You’re so bloody annoying, Malfoy”
He cupped the Auror’s face, whispering into his lips “
“Really?”
“Oh, alright” Theodore said, shrugging and picking up another Witch Weekly, Theodore might seem like he has no manners at all but since he was a Pureblood, manners was the thing he cared most “Is he cute? I didn’t remember anything, I only know that he’s warm, I still get that fuzzy feeling when I woke up”
“Oh” Draco breathed out “Really?”
“What war?”
“Nothing, just…I realized how much I like you” His lips couldn’t stop forming into a smile when he thought about it, so turned out, he has always liked Harry, and even when his mind tricked himself into thinking he didn’t, his heart wouldn’t obey. And just like Pansy, Ron, Hannah, and everyone else have said, he
“You look hot, I thought I should ask you out”
“That’s your usual excuse, I’ve heard that”
“Gross” Draco laughed and got off the bed slowly “
“That’s…perfect” Potter added, he could tell the man was swooned too like him
She stood up and smiled at him, skipping out of the hall
?” Pansy started laughing and wrapped her arm around her wife’s waist “It’s the same as yours-…”
“Hey, what are yo—
, you wore the bracelet I made you”
“That’s not the point. Are you guys going or not?” She pinched Theodore’s leg, making him hiss loudly
The guy exclaimed, rolling his eyes before sashaying away. When Draco finally calmed down, he realised Potter was still holding him, and it felt like eternity before he spoke
“Are you scared now?” Harry arched an eyebrow at him but Draco couldn’t back out from this, he
“Here are your meals, sir” Rose grinned and received the wine bottle from Blaise’s hand, which she poured carefully down “The entrees will include, Pasta Aglio e Olio, I have memorised it, for uncle Harry, and Pasta with Browned Butter, Anchovy, and Kale, for uncle Draco” Rose said, following Blaise after she was done with serving the appetisers
after all, he was the one to tell Hermione and I about it” She winked at him and left with Granger, hand in hand like some couple, which they were. Draco sighed and leaned back on the couch, how could he face Potter? He still thought Draco was his Draco, but Draco wasn’t, which made this whole thing an absolute fiasco.
“How long has it been since you last shag anyone, Anthony?” Pansy cocked her head to the side, making Goldstein blushed
Finnigan whispered, he thought that his voice couldn’t be heard from across the room. Draco sighed, maybe sleeping next to him wouldn’t be that bad. After all, he couldn’t jeopardise his and Potter’s relationship in this place. If Potter was the other Draco’s happiness, then he shouldn’t destroy it.
“I’m not” Draco furrowed his eyebrows at Harry and looked away. Hermione had finished hers a while ago, Pansy was still struggling, and Blaise was helping Ron finish his Amortentia. He wondered what they smelled there as well, what Harry smelled especially.
take advantage of him” Harry groaned, lifting the guy up higher. No one could just use Draco like that, Draco deserved better than this piece of trash “Do
“I know, don’t worry” Potter said, his voice low “And, er, it was a good kiss anyway”
“No, it was a pleasure to be Harry Potter’s boyfriend for a minute” He said teasingly, he did feel kinda proud to say that he was Potter’s boyfriend
Draco mumbled, remembering all the time he gave all the white chocolates for Theodore, who loved the it “That doesn’t mean anything”
Things got different now, because Draco realised he has feelings for Harry, or Potter, or Harry Potter in general. They were the same, he had realised from watching Potter. The way he acted around his friends, his honest laughters, his gentle smiles, his deep voice, it was definitely the same. He did that with everyone, not Draco, of course, and that was what made him sadder than he was now. Just the fact that he liked Potter but wasn’t sure what to do about it. Suddenly becoming such a coward, he hated himself for this. If only he knew what to do.
“Why? You said he’s your type”
” He said and walked out, he closed the door and made his way back to his suites. Opening the door slowly, the light was out so he assumed Potter was asleep already, Draco tiptoed back to the bed and quickly lied down, he draped the blanket over himself and closed his eyes, they have a busy day tomorrow
He said, standing up, he wasn’t going to just sit here and have this awkward conversation with Harry anymore, he has to go dancing, something to take his mind off this. Draco walked around the booth to get to the dance floor without having to past Harry.
” Both Harry and Draco said. Once the waitress had left the table, Harry showed a sly smile as Draco did the same
“What?”
“Yeah, he said he’d leave early to come back early, he said he has to follow is first dream before he could reach his second” Pansy said, shrugging and Draco finally realised, Theodore was just sorting his life out, and it was good “Come on, Draco, stay. It’s the last time we can be together”
was the same person Draco took a picture of this morning just because he got the hots for the guy in his campus. Turned out, this cologne
“Bye,
didn’t expect it from you, Mister Malfoy” Then she lowered her voice that Draco could barely hear it “But you have the Black’s blood in you, so I don’t expect much” She sighed and looked back at them “I don’t want the same thing from 20 years ago to happen
” Draco said, dragging Harry away. When they were walking up the stairs, Draco realised his hand was intertwined with Harry already, he glanced up to see the git smiling brightly
He groaned, he has heard enough of the nagging coming from everyone he knows, he could not take it anymore “Thirty is young”
“And don’t get me started on you” Theo’s lips curled in contempt “You and the whole thing with Ron. We know you’re hiding your gun to show you’re faithful to Ron”
“I can’t believe your mother made your father shut up” Harry whispered at him and he couldn’t believe it as well. Ever since the war ended, it seemed like roles were reversed in their family, so he could understand that.
, the party that you two kissed” Ron chimed in, pointing at the spot on the ground, with the same hat Luna used that day for the game “Well, you didn’t actually kiss, but you know what we mean”
“Not anymore” He smiled, slipping his fingers between Harry’s, looking at their silver wedding rings that they have put on for seven years now. Harry’s hands were different, it was calloused and has scars on, his skins became tanned over the years of training under the sun. Draco’s was opposite to him, Harry would sometimes say he was a porcelain doll to him, since his skin was lighter than Harry’s, his fingers slimmer and smooth as he took care of his hands more than Harry, who refused to put his hand cream on. And when they held hands, it fitted together perfectly.
“She’s snogging her wife, of course” Theo said, stating the obvious, why did Draco even bother to ask? He knew that sly witch would probably be dragging her wife in some room to shag now “And don’t avoid the topic, he complimented you,
“Ron, your
“Lie down, Auror” Draco pushed Harry back down on the bed and kept himself up on his knees, just hovering above Harry’s length while untying his shirt, letting it open “I’m on top this time”
I won’t tell anyone” Ron dragged Harry out of the lift and they kept walking. Harry was torn, he wanted to say it, but he just couldn’t “Not even Blaise, though I’ve vowed to never keep anything from him on our wedding,
, I’m so glad” Draco smiled at her “And what about Blaise and Theo?”
“Of course” He said and Potter nodded, feeling that this was their chance to talk, Draco continued “Are you?”
Finnigan laughed and pulled Thomas up the boys’ dormitory. For Draco, he didn’t want to look up, Potter was still standing at the door like an idiot
“Yes, I’m fine” Draco said into his phone “Harry saved me, I mean, a firefighter saved me, he’s also my neighbour…which I didn’t know”
” Harry looked up at her,
“Harry,
” Harry murmured, only to be replied with a raspy “
“No, no, we’re fine” Potter replied “Keep going”
?” Pansy gave him an obvious look “Hot Aurors with cute animals? It will be a hit”
“See? It’s exactly why I gave up” Draco pulled his hand back and looked at Harry once last time “If you have remembered, we’d have been something…
“It’s three in the afternoon, Pansy”
Draco rubbed his hands together, blowing warm breaths into his palms to feel less cold. It was the coldest night of this month, everyone had said so. He could have just stayed in his dorm, but it wasn’t that different from here. Blaise was teaching Pansy in the library for an upcoming exam, one Draco had already studied so he was safe, while Theo was occupied by a guy like always. Draco found out the hospital wing might be a safe place for him to stay.
Draco stilled his movements when Harry suddenly passed a small parchment to his spot, with his ugly handwriting on, Professor Slughorn was busy reading something from his table that he didn’t even notice
“I’m offended you didn’t come to me or any of the girls for sex advice” Pansy pointed out with a frown “We’re lesbians, and lesbians are brilliant sex experts”
“Of course” Pansy chimed in smoothly, saving Harry from the awkward situation “Brandon—…”
“I know what you’re trying to say” Draco mumbled, looking at her eyes, which was sending him death glares “I will tell him soon”
“Happy now?” He smiled at her and Pansy nodded, giving him her thumbs up
“I only give them out to the younger students, First and Second-Year mostly, clearly, you’re not them”
“Denial, denial”
“That’s a hard request you’re asking there” Potter laughed softly, and he won’t admit Potter’s laugh has made Draco’s chest warm. He looked out to see the moon again, wishing to stay calm, he has to.
“Nothing” Draco replied, he heard something, but ignored it anyway “Potter, just...if you have any problems, I could just bring McLaggen home, then you won’t have to see me grinding on him anymor—…”
“Slytherins might be hard to like at first, Potter” Draco rolled his eyes “You should know that the best”
“I told you he wouldn’t be able to bear it” Hermione mumbled, sitting down on the couch and handed the tea mug in Harry’s hands “Harry?”
Harry and Draco both looked up to see their friends walking to the beach, they were quite far away but they could hear Ron’s loud voice already. As soon as Draco saw a certain someone, he turned back to Harry and grabbed his playful hand
“This isn’t my side of the bed” He said with a grin that was followed by Harry’s laugh, the left side was
Ron stepped back and stuttered “See—see you later”
“Excuse me,
“You knew?”
He whispered when he finally saw Harry on the other side of the gate. It’s been so long since he could see Harry so close, he cursed his stomach for feeling all this butterflies.
“He did want to go, Pansy too, but we played rock, paper, scissor and I won” Hermione grinned when Theo let out a chuckled, she stepped closer to him and put her hand on his arm “Are you alright?”
“I’m so glad” He sniffled softly, and just as she pulled him in for a hug, Draco was surprised, she was a warm person. He didn’t even think she’d forgive him, and when she did, he couldn’t help but becoming speechless “I’m sorry”
“Oh honey, if Hermione and I are friends, then we might have done some stuff friends wouldn’t do” Pansy snickered and showed off her wrist to show him a bracelet “See that? The bracelet? It’s got Hermione’s initial on it, it’s hers since she was a kid but she gave me because she loves me. We’re girlfriends”
” Draco said in unison with Potter
“We can’t tell you who you should date or love, Draco” She whispered in his ear, rubbing soothing circles on his back as tears rolled down his cheeks “We can’t control you, Draco, you can do whatever you want now, as long as you’re happy. And if Harry can bring you what you want, we’re fine with him”
” Draco murmured and pushed Harry back until they both hit the table “We might as well make a special memory here” He licked his lower lip and kissed Harry, feeling his tongue slipping inside. Harry’s kisses were always full of passion, love, and even without wine, Draco still felt drunk on it. He sucked on Harry’s bottom lip while his hands went sliding up and down his husband’s firm chest, all the Auror training paid off well. He bit playfully and made Harry hiss.
” Draco raised his arm high and greeted the guy loudly, startling the man, he walked quickly to meet the guy halfway, his heart racing. When he approached the man, he was surprised by how handsome this one looked, his face showed he was kind, Draco could tell, he was good at looking at faces.
all over Granger. Do I spend a lot of time with her? Yes, for real important reasons. Do I miss on a few things when I’m with her? Yes, but you can tell me what happened”
“You asked me to tutor Weasley, I said no, and now every Professor is telling me to tutor him? Was it you?”
” Draco closed his robes and walked away.
“Will you hate me if I am?”
“Ready?” Draco said, fixing Harry’s shirt and hair again, he got so nervous he couldn’t sleep at all last night, but Harry was there to talk to him until morning. It was possible that both his parents have known by now, and he wasn’t sure how they were going to react
” Draco heard Hermione’s loud squeal and saw her jumping into Pansy’s arms “I can’t believe you did this”
“Here, it’s…your clothes here” Potter handed him a pair of green silk pyjamas with his initials on,
“What did you get?”
Ron beamed brightly, shocking the blond.
“I thought we had a meeting with the other Aurors today”
fell for me?” Draco smile’s widened on its own, he was filled with joy. Just when he thought he couldn’t like Harry more than he already has. Harry nodded and he leaned over, kissing his flushed cheek “You’re cute, Harry” The Gryffindor beamed, pulling Draco in a hug, and once again, Draco never stopped feeling safe when Harry was with him.
“Can I talk to you later?”
“Are you alright?”
over Weasley” Theo teased, laughing loudly with Pansy as Draco held back a chuckle “They have been playing Quidditch all year, Weasley is the Keeper and Blaise is the Chaser, he’s bound to like Weasley sooner or later”
find him, although what he saw was hard to process “But I, er, I saw him with someone else”
, he has been hung up on Neville for two years, it wasn’t like he didn’t try to forget about the stupid guy, he just…can’t.
“How long will you stay here?”
according to Draco. Almost every week, he’d take a man home and Ron has to cast a Silencing Charm to sleep. They have become friends, in a way, and from their daily lives together, Ron learned that Blaise wasn’t just a manslut, he was also loyal to his friends, he was hardworking, and he could cook. Before moving in, Ron had sworn to himself to
“I don’t want you to go home with him” Harry said as Ron grabbed Blaise’s still hard cock and started stroking it quickly, burying his face in the crook of Blaise’s neck, sucking on his skin, his finger playing with the head of Blaise’s cock, he licked a stripe up his
in the mirror. What the hell was this mirror? What was going on? Draco pulled out his wand when images of him and Potter started looking at each other, his hand shaking when their lips touched
” She shushed him softly and ran her hand through his hair. Theo felt like he was a kid again, crying in his mother’s embrace when he got hurt “Don’t let negative things get in your head”
“Draco?” Draco jolted and looked at Theodore, who was sitting on his bed, reading a Witch Weekly magazine “What are you doing sulking like that?”
“Don’t hold back” Draco whispered “Don’t” He begged, and his mouth fell opened when Harry started nudging his cock inside Draco’s lubed hole. Even with Harry prepping him, Draco still felt the pain when the head of Harry’s cock was in him, Draco leaned back, putting all his body weight on Harry, he looked up at the ceiling, his eyes rolling to the back of his head when he sank down on Harry’s cock
He pointed the wand at his own reflection kissing Potter in the mirror “
“Take me
“I know this is a bad time but can I say ‘
“Okay, we’ll have a girl” Draco tightened his grip on their locked hands and wondered what it’d be like when they have one.
“Arch rivals? What do you mean? We’ve always been best friends” Potter said, his eyebrows furrowed and making Draco even more appalled at the sentence.
“No, Professor, I just think, as a Prefect, I think I have the responsibility of helping everyone pass their exams, especially as the N.E.W.T.s are coming up. I feel that there should be a way for people to help others, and for Houses to be united, like Headmistress McGonagall wants” He asked, standing straight on his feet so Professor Slughorn knew he was serious “And I think it’d be great to pair up each student from each House to tutor each other. For example, this is just coming to me now, I feel that Blaise is a brilliant student in your class”
Theo walked by, whispering the words before sashaying away, Draco glared at him and looked at the small flower vase in the middle of the table. They both didn’t say a thing for the past three minutes
Pansy squealed, dragging Hermione to her spot “You almost stepped on…either of these guys’…stuff”
“It’s okay, she likes to do that” Pansy patted his chest and gestured for him to go. Ron walked slowly to the spot and sighed
Just like how she talks in sex”
“Oh, well, you know, Draco likes it” Potter stuttered, he was going to place the drink down again but Draco took it anyway, giving it a try. It actually tasted amazing, it was pretty fruity and not strong with alcohol at all, which was good because he didn’t like alcohol much to begin with “Is it good?”
“Can you move so I can press on the button?” He asked softly, his eyes glued on the ground
“I can see your face light up when Harry stood up to speak for you, I mean, Ron and I would never do that at the time. But…Harry did. And you looked so…it softens up at the sight of Harry. And then we go back for that Eighth Year in Hogwarts. Do you remember when Harry gave you your wand back?”
“Your skin is tanned, so I’ll use this colour” He said, applying it quickly and moved to the lip balm. He picked up the small jar of lip balm and began smearing it on Harry’s lips
Draco closed his bag and sighed deeply, he could
“Lily, go play!” Draco said, grabbing Harry’s hand and they began running along the beach with Pansy after them
“Yeah, this lady is horny for me, my charms still work” Pansy said and quickly got smacked by Hermione, who was blushing, she buried her face in Pansy’s neck to hide her embarrassment while Pansy just laughed loudly “Come on, let’s go, we had a long day anyway” She wrapped her hand around Hermione’s waist and they walked back to the resort together. And of course, Potter was still quiet on the way back.
“I did
“Are you a seer now?”
” Pansy said, grinning at Ron before looking and clutching on the guy’s robes “Ready?” He nodded and Ron led him through the crowd. No one really paid attention to the guy covered in Slytherin robes and a mask when they were all focus on Harry. Ron quickly pulled a chair with him and walked to the middle of the room, putting the wooden chair down. He inhaled deeply before cupping his hands around his mouth and yelled
“Can we play some new game?” Padma raised her arm and they all looked at her “We’ve all played those games a lot”
talked to him, regardless of what he was wearing. You
” Ron laughed out loud when Harry stared at him “What? Can’t your best mate joke around when you’re in a foul mood?”
“There’s still the
“Well, you know, I was…I was calling the girls…” He began
“Not yet, I’m trying” She huffed, her lips formed into a pout “Honestly, I don’t know why she’s being such an uptight person, she needs to relax a little”
Was Potter out of his mind? Never in his life he has heard Potter calling him by his first name
Draco cried out when Harry pounded in him hard, his hands were on the blond’s chest while he made marks that would definitely show on Draco’s neck the next day, making Pansy squeal like it was the first time she saw it
Draco felt his eyes heavy but he still couldn’t open it, the only thing he knew that he was lying on a bed, with a blanket covering him, an odd scent filling up the room, it was a nice scent. The bed dipped and Draco felt someone lying next to him, their arm draped over his stomach and someone was burying their face in the crook of Draco’s neck, tickling him with their hair.
” Draco took a sip from his cocktail and looked at the Auror lazily “It’s still their anniversary, they’d still want to enjoy it alone”
“Blaise’s loaded, so yeah” Draco nodded in agreement, he knew Blaise was rich, but he has never seen Blaise spending so much money on one particular person. Before that, Blaise has quite a few lovers, most of them would try to make him spend money on them, but of course, he never did. So what made Ron the exception? “He’s never spent it on anyone, just so you know, even his past lovers”
you just
“Stand closer, what are you two doing? Normally, you guys would be like glue” Weasley said, his face looking suspicious, Draco bit on his lower lip and let Potter wrapped his arm around his waist, Draco leaned his head on Potter’s shoulder, smiling cheekily as the picture was taken “
Pansy whined when Hermione spoke to her, Draco grinned at them, maybe he should stop being so happy over little things like this.
“Could be” Draco smiled, applying the same thing he has been doing with three previous guys. It has been four hours, all the preparation were long, and then apparently no Aurors can pose, which led them to a bigger problem, Blaise took a long time for the Aurors to get familiar with the animals, and learned some basic poses. It was like watching statues at first, they were too stiff, even babies could pose better than them, and Draco has worked with babies before.
“You too” He said, smiling cheekily and folding his arms together
’ and he smiled politely when he saw a few Aurors walking out of the lift
Hermione called both of them and kept running with her wife
!” Pansy gave Boot a huge smile when he walked to their spot “Ready?”
“Was I good like your old lovers?”
“If you want to mark me that much” Draco pulled Harry down and whispered in his ear “We can just go back down to the party with your marks on me” He murmured, licking Harry’s earlobe and continued “And your seeds in me. You like that?”
“Okay, maybe sit down on a chair?” Blaise suggested, and Seamus pushed the chair in for Ron, the redhead just turned the chair around and straddled it, and the dragon changed its location, moving to the hand Ron rested on the back of the chair.
“Oh no”
wife thought of this?”
, twenty two years ago, you agreed to be my boyfriend” Draco smiled at the truth, it took Harry a while for Draco to accept his offer “Twelve years ago on this day, you agreed to be my husband. If people ask me what love is, I will say it’s you”
“Just let him process it for a few minutes” Pansy dragged Hermione up on her feet and she ruffled Harry’s hair “We’re going to cook, come and talk when you’re ready” She said, leaving Harry there, sitting on the couch with a cup of tea and new information that the person he loved the most gave his virginity to a guy that wasn’t worth it.
“O-oh, I’m sorry” She said and fled hurriedly
“I got transferred back permanently, I’m going to stay here” He said, touching Harry’s jawline “And the guy, whoever you saw, was just a colleague. I have never been with a guy…after I left here”
Potter said soothingly in his ear, his arms wrapped tightly around Draco’s slim waist, he felt a shiver running up his spine just from the way Potter said his name
” Hermione whispered to her wife behind Draco
“Don’t worry, I just gotta pick another guy then” He replied, rubbing his cheek on Draco’s shoulder “Smith just asked me out, I said no earlier, but maybe I should say yes”
has been walking
Draco felt like he was hyperventilating right there and then, watching this
“We thought, or well,
” Theo stuttered, pointing at the door, and Draco turned to look, and just as expected, he was shocked too. There it was, Neville, walking in with some of the Aurors, and
He spoke, burying his face in the crook of Harry’s neck “
“You finally noticed?” Pansy chuckled, hopping to sit on the table and sipping on her colourful drink “You see, Harry is hot, and of course everyone likes him. You remember how I said there are people who like you but you and Harry are always together, they cannot act on it? Well, the same goes for Harry, he’s a hot piece of cake”
“I’m sorry” He said and Theo leaned on his shoulder
“No, of course not”
“Oh hey, where’s Draco?” The blond heard her voice and started bobbing his head up and down, she didn’t see him. Luckily he wore black tonight, and with the dark theme of the pub, no one will barely notice them, there were enough people humping on each other on the dance floor already
“You like that?” Theo smiled, kissing Neville, slipping his tongue inside the blond’s mouth, he put both of Neville’s hands on his bare arse and got back to stroking Neville eagerly “
you wouldn’t continue”
“Oh, right, after that, dinner” Hermione said “And maybe a walk by the beach at night, if you guys want”
“Can I see you?” Harry asked and got a soft nod from Draco, the blond patiently unwrapped the tie of the mask from behind his head and Harry felt his chest being full, he hasn’t seen Draco for twelve years. As the blond unraveled his mask, pulling it down at a slow pace and with each second that passed by, the urge to kiss Draco became more and more unbearable to Harry. His eyes were the first thing that caught Harry’s attention, grey eyes, still as beautiful as ever, the eyes that got Harry falling for every time he looked at, his perfectly trimmed eyebrows, his cheeks that kept getting pinker each second, his perfect nose that Harry just wanted to pinch, his plump lips that Harry was definitely sure Draco had put some lipstick on. The Auror bit on his lips and exhaled, Draco has such a kissable lips that he had missed so much.
for us, but when you showed up in front of my door, with your eyes teary and your nose red, I knew I wanted to work it out with you, I didn’t want to quit and end it like that. We were arch enemies, then we were friends, and through a long period of time, we became lovers, that didn’t just happen right away, no, some people even think we took too long to realise we’re in love”
“Well, since it’s important enough to discuss while I’m reporting a
“Only if you can win” He smirked and pulled Harry down by his beck, biting his ear gently and kissing the spot under it, it was Harry’s weak spot “
“I don’t know his face”
“Hey, do you have time? Can you help me with this?” Potter elbowed him softly, pulling Draco out of his thoughts, the gentle smile on his face has now become something Draco was getting used to. It’s been almost two weeks here, he has gotten nowhere, Potter still hasn’t forced him to tell the truth, he didn’t know how to either. But he should figure it out soon, he couldn’t get used to Potter’s kind gestures, sweet smiles and loving touches anymore, or else once he returned, he wouldn’t know how to face the real Potter there. Draco nodded at him and started explaining to him about History of Magic, while he could not ignore the fact that he didn’t know how to get back.
” Theodore rolled his eyes and smacked Draco softly “You’ve warned me like a million times now, I won’t. I’ll just…do something” He said and started walking when Abbott got her hand on Neville’s arm. Theodore was surely into Neville now, he was obviously the perfect match for him. Draco smiled, watching his friend making up his mind, unlike himself, he was still unsure of a lot of things, like whether Harry has feelings for him or not.
“Yes, I’m alright” Draco smiled, he has officially been a detective’s boyfriend for five months now, the other one month was how long it took for Harry to finally made Draco agree to be his boyfriend. Harry was very protective of Draco, probably because of how they met “I know, I brought a taser with me,
gets a date with Terrence”
“Nev…are you a virgin?” Theo murmured when Neville buried his head in the crook of Theo’s neck, his hands were clumsy, like he didn’t know where to put it
Draco stirred his cauldron as he kept stealing glances at Harry’s work, he was slower than him, while Draco’s Draught of Peace was already turning red, his just turned pink. When the blond caught Harry grabbing the powdered porcupine quills in his hand and raised it over the cauldron, Draco immediately grabbed his wrist.
I know how to fix this”
I look fantastic”
“You have been zoning out for five minutes” Pansy said “Just…stare at nothing at all, it was pretty creepy, I even finished reading the label on this champagne bottle”
“Harry” Draco said in shock, his mouth opened a bit, Harry guessed he was surprised too, he was wearing his fancy dress robes, next to him was Brandon. Blond hair, blue eyes, robes just as flashy as Draco’s, he was the total opposite of Harry, neat and clean, while Harry put on the black suit he wore every year on May 2
you, romantically and sexually. Why don’t you understand that?”
Draco squeezed himself through the crowd and hoped no one spilled any drinks on him, when he reached their usual booth, Draco took a moment to realise the sight before him.
“Oh, er” Ron said awkwardly “He…bumped into Hannah just a second ago, and they’re sitting at the bar”
“Wasn’t the Dark Lord Potter’s arch rival?”
” Draco said and gave up, Potter was obviously sitting under the sun for too long, he might have had a heatstroke and went mad. The blond lied back on his lounge chair and finally rested his eyes
“Hi, Mione” Draco said and looked around, there were clothes, shoes and pillows lying across the room, Hermione was only covered by her blanket and was drinking her champagne “Er…Am I interrupting something?”
“Do you want to take it slow?”
“Are you saying the truth?” Draco mumbled quietly, his hands touching Harry’s wrists “Are you, are you actually saying this?”
” He moaned when Harry started thrusting him fast and deep, he braced himself on the table, covering his mouth from releasing any more embarrassing sounds. Harry put his hands on Draco’s waist, so tight it could bruise, and kept fucking up into the blond, each thrust was a strike to Draco’s prostate. If Draco ever dies, it’d be from being fucked by Harry too hard and he’d die from bliss and nothing else.
“Open your eyes, Draco” Draco felt something warm shot up his chest when Potter called him by his first name. It still sounded unfamiliar to him, but he rather liked the way his name rolled off Potter’s tongue. He opened his eyes, staring down at the small black box with red ribbons on top in the Gryffindor’s hands “I got you something, open it” Draco hesitated for a while before raising his hand to unwrap it. There it was, a pair of black gloves in the box. Draco’s mouth was opened, he picked it up and it felt soft in his hands “
Draco was doomed
” He moaned, as Harry’s hands were slipping from his waist up to his chest, since he wore a crop top, it made the touching easier for Harry. The Auror played with Draco’s nipples, pinching it teasingly while biting Draco’s shoulder, Draco kept moving up and down. He needed more, he was feeling too much bliss all over his body from head to toes, so much that his knees could give out any second. Draco rolled his hips, hearing a low growl from Harry, the Auror was enjoying it just as much, he knew Harry was still trying to hold back.
“I’m a very sexy dancer” Theo whispered not so subtly to Neville and snorted when Neville started blushing “Aren’t you two going?”
“Oh wow, what a sight, my mum would love to see this” Ron also came to the spot with a beer on his hand and looked at his sister, who was sleeping on the couch now. He wondered where all the students could find all the booze “Beer?” He offered the beer to Draco but the blond shook his head, he didn’t really want to get drunk, he was never the drinker.
“I don’t need it”
” Draco grabbed her hand to stop her from poking him, so this must be how Robards felt when she threatened him “I just, because it’s complicated, Pansy. What if, let’s say I confess to him, we become a couple, and then what? We are too different, we will fight all the time, eventually he will grow tired of me and dump me for another person, and then our relationship will be ruined, and then you guys will have to have
“And…Harry asked me first” Draco’s lips couldn’t help but form into a small smile “He asked me why I couldn’t sleep, I stared at him for so long before answering, I said ‘
” He moaned, the breach was a lot to him, he bit on his lips while Neville sucked on his neck, leaving marks for the next day “
Draco diverted his eyes and wasn’t sure what to say. Turned out it was just some kind of misunderstanding and he didn’t even know.
How…fitting for you guys” Ron commented with a chuckled “Any particular reason for this?”
“Woah there, Draco, slow down. What’s on your mind?” Pansy sipped on her drink, folded her arms and leaned on the bar “Love trouble?”
“You’re okay now” Draco grinned at a First-Year student, a Hufflepuff. She has long blonde hair and accidentally sprained her ankle while running. He ruffled her hair and pulled out a box of Chocolate Frog, bending down and handing her the sweet “Here you go, for being such a strong witch”
thing” Hermione said, winking at him, Hermione has never winked once in her life “Ron told us, and about the plan, and the rings”
here”
“Yeah, so?”
“I still want to say sorry” He looked at her, and if he was being honest, he missed Ginny’s huge, bright laugh when he was back there, she was always fun, only to her close friends, Draco assumed “I can’t say it enough”
“What’s going on?”
“I can read minds” Pansy winked at the guy “And, you can let Draco make up for it by asking him out to dinner”
“That’s good” The chef walked around the tables and looked at everyone’s attempt to make Hawaii’s famous chocolate, the chocolate macadamia nuts candies “I’m amazed that I only explained it one time and you all got it. This will be easy for everyone to make chocolate shaped candies for your loved ones later” Draco stared at Potter, who was melting the chocolate and the almond butter in the small saucepan, to be completely honest, he didn’t know shit about cooking, so he’d just wait for Potter to do it. He turned around to see Pansy and Hermione teasing each other while doing it, he glanced to his left and saw the same girl that asked Potter to be her partner earlier was staring at Potter with the same flirty look on her face
“No, er, no, I got it” Harry said, barely looking at him while trying to sort out his things, as for Ron, Blaise was already handing him the necessities as the redhead kept scratching his head and nodding. This would be torture, not because he hated Harry, he definitely didn’t, but because he wanted to help him, but he shouldn’t.
, I need
“What’s wrong?”
“Er, Ron gave me that” Harry gave him a lopsided grin, scratching his nape “He told me I’m obsessed with your lips, which I’m not, so he just threw the mint in my mouth while I was yawning during the ceremony earlier”
?” He slid his finger off and trailed it down Potter’s body “I can’t wait any longer” Draco planted a kiss on Potter’s cheek before sliding down on his knees, he pushed Potter back against the wall and locked eyes with him as soon as he started holding Potter’s length in his hand. Draco took a deep breath, he licked around the head teasingly, when he finally swallowed it in, he felt Potter’s hand on the nape of his neck and his ragged breath above him, he couldn’t go quite all in, but it was the best he could do, it was Potter’s fault for having such a huge cock. He bobbed his head, sucking in earnest, Draco hollowed his cheeks and heard Potter murmuring incoherently, Draco’s knees were starting to get sore, he slipped one hand down to stroke himself, his other hand playing with Potter’s balls, making the man above him even more pent up
“I’m only doing this because I like you” Blaise chuckled and got out of the booth as well
“Our worlds are different, Harry” He murmured in a low tone “My world is full of…deaths, loss, conflicts. We went through wars, we were on the opposite sides” Draco said, revealing the truth, it was so different. How could it have the same ending? “You hate me, Harry”
“I’m thinking” Harry tilted his head down and whispered in Draco’s ear “I might just put you on that table and fuck you right there” He said, licking Draco’s earlobe, making the blond shiver “I will pour wine on you and I will lick you all over”
beautiful replica of Hogwarts, Draco” Hermione said and he glared at the girls, they were clearly lying to make him feel better
“More-
They talked for what felt like years, about everything, and Draco wasn’t sure why he was so comfortable telling Potter what he felt, his loneliness, his desire to be on his own, his secrets. Potter also spilled out his feelings, and he didn’t have a clue why it felt so refreshing to hear Potter’s stories, to know that he struggled just as much as Draco, and how alike they were. Draco didn’t want to know what time it was, there was something in him that didn’t want their conversation to end.
“Did you just apologise to them too?” Draco turned around, surprised to see Ginny standing in front of him, her eyes still squinting like he was a suspect in a crime
“Er” Draco furrowed his eyebrow but stretched his legs and rested them on Potter’s lap anyway “What are you do-
“I won’t, I know you’re there to make sure” Potter gave him a lopsided smile and Draco tried his best to keep his face indifferent. For some reason, Potter was interested in trying to talk to Draco recently, it was weird, and infuriating
“Call me Draco” He kneeled down and smiled at her, she nodded and gazed at the sweet in her hand lovingly, her eyes twinkled. He wasn’t used to dealing with kids before, but now he was the one saving the sweets his mother had sent him and stacking it in his robes so he could give them out to the young patients here. She skipped away and Draco stood up, turning around to make sure she got out of here without any scratch “
“Oh” The man finally replied and looked at Draco “I’m sorry, I didn’t know, I didn’t see your ring…before” Draco stared at the guy confusedly before looking down on his hand, there was actually a ring on his ring finger now, the blond cocked his head a bit to the side and looked back at the two men in front of him
“Still not over him?” Pansy’s words made Draco jolted and he stared at her
“Oh, I’m sorry” He said, his heart aching a bit but then Harry grabbed his hand
“How is that relevant?” Harry snickered loudly along with Ron “That’s rude, Ron”
“Because I care about my best friend and wanted to see what you were doing”
“Ugh, don’t make me imagine”
“Thank you” Hermione whispered softly to her ear each time Pansy made the same toast over and over again
“Girls
. What the hell is this?” He asked himself, this was probably a language he hasn’t known yet. He saw his reflection in it, slightly different somehow, his reflection looked…happier
“Where’s Harry?” Before he was even aware of his own words, he had already asked them where Potter was, as if it was becoming a habit of him now
“Er, they’re going to…go home and play with their stuffed animals…”
“Fine” He grumbled and picked one out from the second box in Hermione’s hand “February”
“He broke up with me” Theodore sniffled, burying his face in Draco’s white shirt. Theodore was still a bit flirty here as he was in the other world, but it was different there. He has more boyfriends than friends, but no one has ever stayed too long with him, they were all arses “Said I was just a toy for him to play, Draco”
“Yeah?”
“I’m not” Pansy said “Ron said you’d do good for Harry, we all think so, you two balance each other out. Ginny thinks you’re a catch, do you think I’m lying? You know Ginny likes you now, everyone likes you, they honestly think you guys would be married by the time you’re 30” She wiped the wet hair that stuck to Draco’s forehead and slicked it back “We won’t leave you. And…if you guys fight, you
“They were walking in Diagon Alley a few days ago together”
“Alright then!” Ron said, raising his beer glass up “
“Hey, what are those girls doing?”
get more awkward
“Some people are like that” Pansy mumbled in her drink and kicked his leg “So, what are you going to do?”
“Yeah” He said before Harry’s astonishment, he looked up at Harry and continued “I told them about a month ago, and they accepted it, surprisingly, they knew, and they just want me to be happy” He raised his hands up to cup Harry’s face “What you said in there, I…I feel the same, I miss you so bloody much, Harry. Before, I was afraid, I was scared the world thinks I’m not good enough for you, you’re way better than me, and I’ve hurt you, I’m sorry“
“Greengrass? Astoria Greengrass?” Pansy asked and Lucius nodded, since she was the only girl left. Daphne had gotten married to Millicent Bulstrode years ago and they have already moved to France “
“A gentleman,
grade” Hermione smiled “He was always busy with work, we tried matchmaking him but he said no every time. And I
“Hey, what are you doing poking your food?” Pansy elbowed him, moving closer to his spot and whispering in his ear “I heard Weasley and Granger broke up a few days ago, people only found out now”
“You’re smooth” Draco smiled, cupping Harry’s face and leaned down to touched their noses together softly “For your information, I want it too, with you”
“Yeah, I heard” Pansy grinned at the sight of her wife “I’m going to make you a hella big chocolate candy”
!” Ginny exclaimed, shaking Luna’s hand “Can you believe it?”
“See how I’m doing this?” Pansy smiled “I love this girl
“And, er, we also heard Draco dumped Brandon” It was now Neville speaking “Last week, Draco was more mad than sad”
“I do” He mumbled, blushing when Harry kept licking his earlobe, sending shivers down his spine “You know I d—
” Neville groaned “I didn’t, I wasn’t sure if you really like me, I-I was uncertain, I didn’t know how to act, because you act like that, and then the next day you said how some guy just
“Since you didn’t confess” Pansy said softly “It’s time for me, or, us to confess”
“What?”
we arrived when they were already in the room” He complained, when Pansy and him arrived together, they have noticed the clothes on the floor trailing to the bedroom, with small sounds coming from there every few minutes “Should we tell them we’re here?”
! Just
thing earlier. He smirked to himself and pulled Potter by the neck down for another kiss, he licked on Potter’s earlobe and earned a soft growl from the Auror
“Believe me, I’m not” Harry grumbled low when Draco kept teasing him while bobbing himself up and down, increasing his speed after each time, and all Harry could do was stay there and try not to come. Draco fitted him like a piece of puzzle on every aspect, and he was glad Pansy made his friends tie him up and brought him to his party. If Pansy hadn’t done all of this, he might have never got the chance to see Draco again. While Draco was still lost in ecstasy, Harry slowly grabbed hold of his waist and rolled them both over before Draco could even react.
“Really?” Draco asked and Pansy only nodded as they kept walking. It has been so long that he didn’t remember much of it anyway. He couldn’t have collected those, could he?
Draco gasped, he has never told her that, he… “
” Hermione huffed, her lips quirked up into a small smile “Apparate home, do things, we’ll meet up tomorrow”
” The water was low but he still hated Potter for doing that to him
His last year here was a new year for him, he wanted to change, and he started being civil to everyone. Not Potter particularly, he just avoided any encounter he might have with Potter or his friends, he couldn’t come up with anything nice to say, let alone an apology. He wanted to, but it was an impossible thing for him to do.
“Alright, just calm down, you’re like a scared Kneazle right now” She grabbed his shoulder and started talking, he listened carefully to everything she told him. From the start, since he was born, Draco then realised he was in some kind of alternate universe where everyone that had died in his world was all alive, no war ever happened, and everyone was in love with people he never expected them to be in love with. Potter was his boyfriend ever since Sixth Year, they have been best friends ever since they were five years old kids, when they bumped into each other on the street. His father, who seemed to be a kind man in this world, suggested they should have play dates, and somehow Potter’s parents agreed, and they’ve been friends ever since. Pansy was in love with Granger from First Year when they met on the Hogwarts Express, and have been a couple since the Yule Ball, Blaise and Ron were in a secret relationship, the Weasley girl turned out to have a big crush on Lovegood and they just started dating a week ago, and his friend Theodore was also in love with Neville and they have been a couple for almost a year.
“Yeah, okay, I understand” Potter answered with a nod. Draco hummed and stood straight up again, signalling that he was done, but the Gryffindor made no movement to leave “Er, why didn’t you go home for Christmas and New Year?”
“Oh, okay, he can do whatever he wa—
Pansy started marching up to the shore as the pair of married men let their daughter back down on the sand
“It’s an accident” Harry shrugged “Things like this happen to me all the time”
“I can’t believe I cuddle with a Gryffindor.
“Hey, hey” Harry sat closer and spoke “It’s alright, I won’t sue, your boss won’t know, and you’ll be fine”
Draco finally looked at them in the eyes and said it loudly “I felt it”
“And then you did all those things, apologising to everyone but me, I was angry”
“Are you alright?”
“No, because Hermione, Luna and Neville will be the ones pulling the others away” Draco said, looking down at their naked bodies “I can’t believe we just fucked in the Great Hall” Realisation finally hit him and Draco buried his face in Harry’s neck “What if the professors know?”
“What do you mean, Mr. Malfoy?” Professor Slughorn turned around to smile at him while organising the class “That is quite the request you have there”
“I am, him…not so much”
Ah yes, the moment of truth is here
Draco only meant for it to be a normal kiss, but when Potter started sucking on his lips, Draco felt like his heart was going to leap out of his chest. Potter’s arm was on his back, pushing him close so their lower parts touched, he slipped his tongue in and Draco let him, he was surprised but he wanted more also, Draco cupped Potter’s face, pressing deeper into the kiss, letting out a small moan he never knew he was holding. Draco finally pulled back when he was out of breath, their eyes locking to each other, his lips felt swollen, he cleared his throat and turned to look at the other guy
He moaned when Harry finally pushed it all inside and started thrusting slowly. Draco locked his legs around Harry’s waist when he began quickening his pace “
“But luckily no one found out” Neville said, blushes rising up his cheeks
He cried out, stroking himself and coming hard, his body shaking, the carpet needed to be clean immediately “
“O-oh…yes, but-…”
“What?” Hermione asked, looking in the direction Pansy was pointing at
“Don’t you dare touch him”
“I…” Draco murmured, he wasn’t sure what to do. If he agreed, he’d have to teach Harry for Merlin knew how long. If he ran away, it probably wouldn’t be good for their relationship at the moment “Fine” He sighed, sitting back down so Harry could settled on the chair next to him. He opened his book and took out his quill once again, composing himself before he might do anything weird like calling him by his first name again.
“You know what you did to get Harry’s attention” Hermione said with a knowing smile “And, you
by the way Ron’s fine too now, so stop apologising, I think the real reason why you
propose to Draco. The plan was supposed to happen tonight, on the opening night of Ron and Blaise’s restaurant, so Draco wouldn’t expect it, but Harry didn’t know Brandon would get in the way like that.
“No, wait” He cut Harry’s words off and sighed “I…I told my parents about us”
“You don’t?”
“What is it?” Without replying, Harry stood up from his chair and slowly crouching down on one knee, he could see Draco’s eyes starting to widen, his mouth falling slightly open and his fork fell on the table. Harry pulled out a small red box from his pocket and opened it, he heard gasps and small applause around him in the restaurant “Draco Lucius Malfoy…Will you marry me?”
“It doesn’t matter, Miss Parkinson” Lucius said, looking at Ron again “Where’s Draco?”
“Harry still doesn’t know what happened the night Draco confessed” Pansy intertwined her hand with Hermione and helped her catch up with their conversation
Three weeks until Harry’s birthday, so far, they haven’t talked in a week after he played chess with Ron in the Gryffindor Common Room. Harry has just been staring at him a lot lately, making Draco doubt himself. Did he think Draco was up to something again? He was, but it was just to prove whether he was right or not. Draco closed his eyes and breathed out, he hoped he’d be right.
He chanted, his hand sliding down to grab his own cock “
“Looks like your soulmate is tired today” Lovegood said, looking at Draco and he turned around to see Potter snoring from behind, his arms still locked around his waist “Maybe you should take him up to his dorm, it’s a long way to your dorm anyway”
Harry said, and the words that came out of his mouth was way softer than he realised, making Ron nudged him with his elbow, it wasn’t like he did it on purpose, Draco just made him soft.
“Hey guys” She smiled at them “Ginny is too tired from dancing, we got to go”
“Here, let me help you” Draco stood up and removed the cap of the eye drop “Tilt your head a bit, yes” He angled Harry’s face up with his finger and looked at the man “I want you to look at me, okay? Can you see me?”
! I just…” Potter smiled and pulled something out of his bag. Draco’s eyes opened wide, he pressed his lips into a thin line to hide his shock, Potter was holding a bright red chocolate box with a black ribbon on it, and there was even his name on the box, written by Potter, he could tell from the messy handwriting, Potter held it in his hand and bit his lips
? What is wrong with you?”
“Oh, hello”
“Sorry, I had to improvised” Potter gave them a bright smile “What? He’s being harassed by that man, I had to put out all his hopes by saying Draco’s married”
at least that was what she thought. Then she had left early because Hermione had called about something. Since the day Harry chased after him, he had locked himself inside his house, and on their last photoshoot today, he was glad Harry wasn’t there, a part of him
He grabbed Draco’s wrist and stopped him “Why didn’t you apologise to me? After all, you bullied me throughout the whole time we’re here” He said, not letting go of Draco’s wrist but the blond wasn’t going to turn around to see him either “You treat me in the worst way possible, you tried to kill me, and you didn’t have the guts to say you’re sorry?”
Draco's cock pulsed.  "Do you trust me?"
One.  Two.  Three.  Four.
The few onlookers grew to many and soon he had an entourage accompanying him as he finally faced Ollivander's Wand Shop.  A smaller sign below the usual "Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C." read "Assistant Luna Lovegood."  He stared at the sign in disquiet, remembering the last time he'd seen Lovegood.  A bell tinkled as he opened the door and stepped into the dim interior, leaving the gawkers on the sunbaked street.
Remus accepted that, because how could he not trust the man who released him from that prison?
He knew that book.  His own parents had a version for pure-blood babies.
Harry thought quickly on what to do next to keep the beautiful blond in his presence for longer than it would take him to trounce him in chess.  If only he'd charmed his chess pieces to actually play for him… then he might have a chance.  He would put that on a 'to do' list for Ron's next visit.
"Ooh, Harry.  Big league clients," Ron said approvingly.  "I best get back to the shop, let you earn that fat paycheck."  Harry rolled his eyes and with a casual wave, Ron walked out right as the shorter man walked in.
"Considering that your poor excuse for a suitor is actually supposed to deliver us from our current situation, I certainly think
"Potter was freaking out.  He was emanating magic!  He exploded.  Literally.  Wasted a mile of beach."
Pansy shakes her head, blinks.  "Whatever, Potter.  Why are we talking anyway?"  She raises her wand, pauses for a breath, then sends off a zap of magic.
"Yes, and you need to let that settle into your thick skull.  You will eventually have to return."  He reached out and awkwardly placed a hand on Harry's shoulder.  Harry flinched and stared over at Snape with wide, frightened eyes.  Snape pulled his hand away.
Gah!  Sweet, cool water.  It soothed Harry's parched throat like a salve and he wanted more.  But no more came, so he faded once again.
Harry cheered and dashed around, jumping in the air.  Then he leapt into Severus' arms and kissed him soundly, holding him tight.  He took his victories where he could.
"No, I just… Oh… Things in Africa are great.  I've been learning so much from the witches down there.  I just… Oh I don’t know.  I guess I wasn’t ready to come back here.  I haven’t been home yet.  I just couldn’t go there—" she broke off, stifling whatever breakdown pranced imminently on the edge.
"Draco."
Samhain arrived in the bright reds and oranges of fall, and with Severus' charm Harry could feel the flutter of other worlds when he focused his senses.  The veil was thin; it was one of two days where travel between the different dimensions was possible.  If this didn't work, they would have to wait another six months.  What if Draco wasn't there?  What if he'd given up?
.  He never wanted to end this, never wanted to stop.  His throat bobbed.  Tonight, he would have it all.
He hadn't seen Draco in months, but after the war they'd come to some sort of warm camaraderie.  They weren't friends, but they were far from enemies, and he figured that Draco might be the first step to helping him fulfill Rosenbloom's contract.
He stood in the doorway and stared beyond the tallest trees' tops.  They danced, brushing against each other creating a wild symphony as the wind grew in power.
"Tonight on Eyewitness News.  You've heard of the Hero on…"
They'd talked for hours.  He couldn’t believe that Draco wouldn't accept that he was a vampire.  Even though they had had some holes in their Defense classes, Professor Lupin had covered the signs of a vampire that year.  Harry chalked it up to Draco not paying any attention.  Little aristocratic snob.
"Okay Harry.  One more.  Just one more.  This person is really nice, great shape, pretty down to earth."  Hermione's back was to Draco and Harry turned to face her.  Harry looked pained.  He didn't want to hurt his friend, Draco knew, but he also knew that Harry was really, really spreading his tolerance thin for her nosy tendencies.
"Huh?  But… I'm not…"
"I think," Luna says with breathy weight to her words, "that he's trying to replace everything that he's already lost."
Harry inhaled sharply. "Do you mean… that… Snape. Draco…?"
Finally, Draco seemed to have collected his scattered wits.  "Good job, CatBoy.  It appears you've cracked the case of the
"Harry."  He poked his head out the door of the office he shared with Pinkman and Nut, both currently out on assignment trying to track down an acromantula breeder.
He looked up at Harry.  "Do you see anyone here other than you and me?"
"Well, I'll leave you to it.  Remus, I'll watch the shop for you."  Harry waved as he walked back to the front of the store.
"Harry, I'm tired.  I'm going back to the inn."
"Isn't it my turn?" Harry said, pushing himself to his feet and stepping forward.  "He gets all the fun."  His bladder felt weak.  He took another step forward, his heart racing to escape his chest and escape his stupid decisions and escape this fucking Hell.
Draco snorted as he turned to the door and searched for curses. The door pulsed with magic, practically groaned under the weight of it. But they weren’t all curses or warding spells. Intricately imbedded in the molecular bonding of the doorway were containment magics such as he'd never sensed before. There had to be something big behind this door. Bigger than the arch. Bigger than the staff. Bigger than…
"Slop time," the Death Eater called Rowle said.
Remus missed this kind of work. He and Harry hadn't done undercover surveillance together as often as he was paired with Moody or other Order members, but he acknowledged they had a good rapport together. Must have been the hours of slaving over Hermione's notes that helped the two to understand all of the nonverbal cues as the verbal debate over Draco ensued.
Startled, Potter dodged down an alley, and Draco chased after.
"Hermione! Oh Merlin, I totally forgot about her." Harry cringed in guilt. "Remus, you go back. I'm going to stop in to check on her for a bit, and then I'll be home, okay?"
They had to survive and leave Severus behind.
He needed to release the steel in his nerves, the iron wall surrounding his mind.
"Tough case?" Harry asked. He had known Ron long enough to know his friend usually recovered from his anger faster if he had the opportunity to vent.
A tentative hand touched Harry's shoulder, and then awkwardly began rubbing his back.  "Don't give up, Harry.  Please… I'd thought about dying so many times, then you were brought here and I realized I'm not alone.  Don't give up… I don't think I could do it alone."  His words were quiet in his confession, small and so very fragile.
Harry pulled back, his eyes focused on Severus' face which revealed so much in those soft eyes and parted lips, pink and glistening from this kiss.  His leaned in to kiss him again, sucking Severus' bottom lip through his teeth, nibbling, tasting, claiming as he tracked across Severus' skin: his cheeks, his eyelids, the soft skin behind his ears.
"See, that."  Harry pointed at the eyebrow.  "Is that a special vampire power?"
, Harry's mind rattled off prayer after curse, demanding why exactly these things had to happen to him and the ones he loved.
figure out how to escape this sick farce and bust this door open."
"Madame Hexine was certain that this curse came from very old roots, if it isn't very old in and of itself. And she seems to think it cannot be cast via straight spellwork either, unless the individual controlled exceptional power." Draco eyed Harry, a look of contemplation softening his features.
He lay in bed, starting at the wooden beams crossing the ceiling.  It was cold and he'd shivered through the night.  "Potter, I think we need a new strategy," he said to the room.  A head popped up from the floor and looked at him.
Draco took his time in the kitchen, not necessarily hiding, just avoiding the irate Weasel who had at least a half foot on him plus a few stone.
At intermission he was drinking from a bottle of water and had felt appropriately appeased for paying three pounds for it when she'd bumped into him and said, "Ah, Merlin.  I’m sorry," then immediately began to sputter over her slip.
Finally he grabbed his flask, and as he leaned over the newly unclogged sink, he emptied that too. The astringent liquid slid into oblivion, mixing with salty tears as he wailed at the loss of so many years.
"Oh, quit being so elitist," Hermione scolded, glaring at her hand.  As the argument continued, Harry quietly slipped away.
Of course, he realized, it wasn't a striking kind of snake.  Still, he felt it prudent to be prepared. And then the yawn escaped.
"I could call you Harry," Draco said warily, looking at him sideways.  "If you promise not try and grope me again," he said, watching him closely.  The immediate widening of his eyes shocked Draco.
And then the lightening began to strike.
His ears went back and he growled.
His stalled his flight and glanced over his shoulder to stare at the cat.  His hair had fallen into his eyes—though he was so focused he wasn't bothered by the strands blocking his vision.  Tufts was licking his foot and a rumbling purr could be heard all the way across the room.  With a confused shake to his head, Draco left.
Draco set down his fork.  "I suppose.  This isn't a come on is it?" he asked, remembering their last discussion on happiness.
"It would be easier on you if you are on your hands and knees…" Severus tried to explain.
.  And then Draco felt Harry everywhere, on his skin, in his mind, touching his magic and the two fell to the settee, dizzy and blind and
"Patricia, certainly you must know my aid is worth far more than one dinner. And certainly worth more than what this man could offer." Draco's voice hitched, just a hint of a hitch, but it was there nonetheless. Was Draco nervous? Harry knew he must have heard wrong.
Harry did a double take and slowly lowered himself to the seat across from the drawn man.  "Everything you haven’t already told me.  The things you kept from me.  Who else did we have buried in Voldermort’s ranks?  Was Snape always on our side or just playing the best hand?"
While Draco watches Harry, the Captain watches his ship.  And Draco is not the only one turning to Harry. The air about the crew is sharp, tinged with anger and desperation.  This isn't about the war, tonight, this has become personal.  The man stands at the prow of their little boat, back straight, a silhouette against the purpling velvet of the sky, the glow along the horizon.  The bob of Harry's Adam's apple the only hint that everything wasn't in his control.
"Riley was there working with Kogelmann. Protecting him as he searched for something. Underhill was passing intel off to Riley and Kogelmann. Guess what he was supposed to be searching for. You get three guesses, first two don't count."
"Ah, young Malfoy," says the Dark Lord, not taking his eyes from Harry.  "I see you've given up your pacifism to betray me and your father."
Months ago, Harry would have argued.  Today, he just nodded.  Somewhere between humiliation and pain, he'd learned to finally trust the older man.  He blinked over at Snape and was surprised to see him studying Harry as well.
"It's cursed," Harry said.
"Stop struggling. Accept who you are, what you are." The figure stepped forward from the shadow near the wall. It faded as it entered the light from the window high overhead. It continued to come forward, gaining more substance and definition as the light was abandoned for more shadow. "It is the only way. You treat Moony like a cancer. You are Moony. Moony is you. The two shall never be separate. Accept." The figure tossed its head, flipping long hair from its eyes.
"My best and biggest advice is to take nothing for granted and spend every moment you can with your child.  Love your baby like you have never loved anyone before, for it could be the only chance you have at creating something bigger and better than yourself."  Draco saw in amazement as his mother spoke every word that her eyes had grown watery with emotion.  He realized his own had grown moist as well.  He had never understood, never knew how much she loved him.
"Yes, Professor Malfoy," she said as Draco moved by to examine his next student's progress.
Draco guessed at its current rate of growth, it would bloom in less than a week, and then the stamen would hopefully cure Harry where Draco couldn't.
The madness.  It was gone.  Gone from his eyes.  Gone from his smile.  Gone like dew in the morning sun, silently and without any exhibition.
Draco liked him just fine, even if he was a Muggle-born.
Harry pondered this, not just as some empty platitude, but really wondered if there was anything Draco could do.
"Justice."
After he'd completed his list, he grabbed his coat and went to the Floo, only to be stopped by his houseguest.  Harry was sitting in the chair in the entrance room, chewing on his index finger's nail, his eyes wide and seemingly capable of ingesting every little detail.
“So, does that mean everyone…”
“Look, Hermione, we’re not the only happy married couple here” Pansy put up a smug as they approached Draco and Potter’s table
he met someone, well, not really.
“So the war never happened?”
It was unnerving, Draco started to doubt himself, because what if this was a universe where all of his friends got together, but not him and Harry? Draco couldn’t get the uneasy feeling in him to stop. He didn’t know how to patch things up with him, how to apologise to him after what he said, or how to even tell Harry he liked him. How was that even possible? He wasn’t used to expressing this, love, as they called it. Maybe it was a Slytherin thing, he never heard his parents said that word to each other, or his friends saying it with their lovers, or maybe Draco was just emotionally closed off and unable to express it. Now that Harry and Ginny were probably getting back together, he began to think, maybe Harry and him were just not meant to be after all.
“I think you do, actually” She pulled him close and leaned up to whisper in his ear “I want you to solve this, so get rid of that big ego of yours and fix this before
“No, I mean…er, are you going to fuck me in a lift?”
sitting here and almost came over”
“Thank you, mother” He sniffled at her words and gazed at his father “Father…are you okay with this?” He asked and his father finally looked up at him, settling his knife and fork down on their proper spot before waving his hands everywhere in the air, looking like he was throwing a tantrum already. However, there was no sound emerging from his opened mouth. Draco raised an eyebrow and though his father seemed angry, he couldn’t hear what he was saying.
“Hi, coffee?” Hermione walked out from Harry’s kitchen and gave them two cups of coffee “And
“Oh yeah” Harry hummed “Who could she be talking about?” He said, but quickly turned back to grin at Draco “Do you want to go on a date with me this weekend?”
She said and all the Aurors rushed out in barely a minute, grabbing their robes and wands and just left
“Oh” Potter said and looked down “Here” He put the shrimp he just peeled into Draco’s bowl and grabbed another from the plate
” Draco murmured
“Seriously?”
“I can clearly see that” Draco chuckled, glancing a bit at Harry’s abdomen when he bent down while wearing that tank top, he cannot wait to be devoured by Harry.
want me to come help” Ron shrugged with a grin
“You, er, you really mean that?”
“What are you doing?” He asked, pulling the bottle of wine from Theodore’s hand “You can’t drink that much. What’s wrong?”
“I also enjoy it when you get bossy” Harry said, his smile widening and he lifted Draco up with his hands, spreading his arse apart and lined his cock up against Draco’s lubed entrance, since they were sitting in the shallow water, it was like they fucked in a tub. Draco bit back a moan when Harry pushed in, the way he was the only one to be able to fill Draco up was one of the many reasons why he loved Harry. They were the perfect match “Are you hurt?”
“You seriously need to stop buying Rose stuff
“You are very much pissed too, Harry” He said “I can smell the Firewhisky from your mouth” Half of them were on the edge of passing out already, the rest were the responsible ones, holding themselves back, like Draco
“I’m here” Blaise appeared from out of nowhere and put an arm around Ron’s waist “You’re drunk. And Draco, hey, I’m glad you came”
noticed it too” Hermione said, fiddling with her robes “Then I confronted him, he confessed to me”
remember what happened seven years ago? Was this all just a
“That’s because you are, so, I’m thinking you better kick the one laughing with Harry there out before he tries to take your place in Harry’s heart” Ron nudged Draco’s leg from under the table and left quickly. The blond gazed at the guy touching Harry’s hand and balled his hands into fists. Draco stood up and walked to the table next to him with a smile
“Well—…”
“Well, er, I would put my hand on the back of your neck like this” Potter said and did as he say “And wrapped my other hand and place it on the small of your back. And I’d kiss you” The Auror did just so, resting his hand on Draco’s bare back, his crop top was only covering half of his upper body, revealing his stomach. Potter pulled Draco down gently as he tilted his head up, meeting Draco’s lips halfway for a soft kiss. The blond felt that rush again, the same rush he got when Potter kissed him just a few minutes ago, the touch of his lips against Draco, soft and tender. Now that he has the time to really think about the kiss, he found out that Potter’s lips were chapped. Draco opened his mouth slightly, letting Potter slide his tongue in, he arched his back and grind against Potter in reflex, he didn’t know Potter was
“I’m done” Luna said after writing down a bunch of stuff in the parchment and tear it in pieces, folding it up and putting it in her hat “Everyone, close your eyes, please” Draco closed his eyes, listening to her footsteps, it was soft and steady, just like Luna herself. When she put a hand on his shoulder, Draco jolted slightly “
“I’m sorry,
” Harry tightened his grip on Brandon’s collar, he could knock the guy out, but he shouldn’t. He did hurt Draco, he was the one who made Draco sad, he made Draco jumped into Brandon’s arms, just because he avoided Draco. Harry let go and the guy fell back on the ground on his feet just as someone entered the loo.
“Yeah, I could” Potter said, and without waiting for Draco to answer, he started removing the legs and claws of the crab. Watching Potter cracking the crab for him, Draco felt his cheeks burning a bit, the way Potter was so focused on doing it for Draco, the way he flexed his arms a bit while doing it, the way he still looked good in that Hawaiian outfit, Draco feared he was feeling something…
“If Harry doesn’t want it…”
“Please stop talking” He muttered and grabbed the lotion bottle from the table, he squeezed some from his hand before applying it on Smith’s body. For whatever reason, Theo let Smith’s pose half naked with only the wand holster on his arm, he was assigned with a wolf, and for March, Draco didn’t want to know
"Did you incur additional damage to your already handicapped brain when you made the very poor choice to Apparate into my office?  I always knew you lacked foresight, intention and common sense, but this!  I could have been with a patient!"  Fists anchored to her hip bones and black hair drawn tight into a bun affected the guise of a cruel nurse eager to discipline and punish.
"Somehow, I am not relieved.  Remember, he was acquitted by the Wizengamot.  Doesn't that mean anything to you?"  The incredulous look on Harry's face offered Kingsley no assurance.  "Remus, can you keep him in line?"
Remus nodded and Disapparated after a quick good-bye.
s they left his office, quietly clicking the door shut.
him.  Harry stiffened—smothered, trapped, he couldn't breathe he couldn't breathe
No trace of the fear Draco thought he'd seen remained on the boy's face, for he smiled such a beautiful smile it burned away everything but hope and joy and love. Draco relaxed at his unexpected declaration and briefly hugged the boy again then gently let him go.
Fuck it.  He laid his hand between Draco's shoulder blades.
And now he saw something that might bring him that happiness, and he decided he would make his own choices.
“Why would you bring me here?”
If that was all he would ever get, Sirius in his arms, a gentle kiss to the top of his head, Remus would be content, for it was more than he had ever hoped he'd be given.
Looking up from his busy fingers, Harry offered a small, completely hollow smile that Kingsley seemed to buy with full acceptance. But he couldn't keep his eyes on his friend, and they wandered over his shoulder, examining the mug shots of screaming wizards and witches covering the far wall, proclaiming their innocence or laughing insanely about their crime or perhaps their plans for imminent escape. He looked into the black and white eyes of those criminals, begging them to tell him what to say next.
Harry twirled around and there was Draco Malfoy, his clown doll cradled in one arm, something else clutched in his other hand.  His robe sported an assortment of polka dots of ranging sizes the same shade as the doll's blue eye shadow.  Draco's eyeliner was ever present.
He walked up to the magical Muggle doors that slid open on his approach and stood lost and amazed at the collection of
Curious, Draco only nods and wonders what the hell Terry had laced his uneaten ration with.
, along with a few able-bodied pirates and the powder boys who were too young and inexperienced for dueling and wand combat.
"Yeah," he said somberly.  "I thought I could do that Exchange Ritual, but I'm missing something.  I just can't figure it out.  I'm so sorry.  I've failed you… I tried.  I tried."  Harry lunged himself into Draco's arms and cried out into the dying day.  "I'm… so… sorry," he sobbed.  Draco clung to Harry, trying to hang on to life and potential and a vague concept called 'future.'  All soon to blow away like dust.
Remus' Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed, then he nodded his head. He nodded it so vigorously his hair quivered and his grin stretched so wide his face looked like it hurt. "Harry, I would love to run a spell shop with you." He stood and the two men embraced, slapping each other's backs and laughing.
"Well, I guess that will do," Draco said, in an almost friendly tone, at least a tone that didn't suggest Harry was something Draco found on the bottom of his shoe.  Harry’s jaw dropped open, a furrow of concern burrowing between his eyes.
He fell to the floor in relief, sucking in lungfuls of clear, beautiful air.
"Well, he's waiting, I better go."  She twirled around and continued down the steps, her hair bobbing with each bounce in an overly eager way.
Professor Arbormore of the Cairo Museum offered Harry little help.
Tiny sparkles, like the spray of the ocean surf, reflected in the deep purple of the coming night.  Harry loved it up here, sprawled out, alone and quiet on his building's roof, set on the edge of the city.  On some evenings when the air swelled a little thicker or perhaps the Muggle electricity grew a tad dim, the lights from the city seemed faint, almost muted, and the stars stood out in vibrant contrast against the expanse of the universe.
They walked down the hallway, slowly and with care.  Harry had Greyback's wand at the ready, and Draco seemed to have found enough energy to walk on his own.  They reached the door and Snape looked at them each in turn and they nodded.  With a twist of the knob, they burst through the door.
"I think it's this place, Moony. So much magic—" Sirius glanced around, his eyes oddly glowing in the dark room, like a cat's, "—that I seem to be absorbing it somehow to—" he held out his arms in presentation, "—to grow some substance. Or maybe it's 'cause I'm not holding that Darkness within me."
“Potter?”
She stood and reached out for him.  There, this was the welcome he expected.  Rising to his feet, he held his arms out and when she reached back and slapped him, he knew he had finally returned to his friend.
"Oh, Remus. Come on in. Can you help with this algebra?" Harry sounded worried, or annoyed, Remus wasn't quite sure, maybe both.
to illuminate the tunnel. In the faint light, the smooth walls continued for another thirty feet until the darkness enveloped the details.
Riley stood and slammed his hand to his desk, suddenly exploding in anger.  "That's uncalled for Potter, and you know it."
Beaming, Harry said, "I thought you'd never offer. Here, solve these equations for me. I'm crap at it." He gracelessly dropped a pile of papers in front of Remus.
was perhaps a better question, but then something else caught his attention and that train of thought ended.
"Harry?"
"Greg, do you know anything about a magical item at these meetings?" Harry asked, his voice quiet and calm. "An artefact or something unusual. That might have been used on people there?"
It was the oddest feeling to have one consciousness harbored within a multitude of separate beings.  It wasn't anything he could actually explain to anyone.  To see out of scores of eyes, to smell from all directions, to filter out the static of his rat-like wishes and focus on those desires that came from Draco Malfoy.  It went far beyond simple, physical clarification; it was something that stemmed from the soul.
Draco moved back to his corner and Harry sat in his with his back to the metal bars that leached out his heat.  He continued to stare at that little star, their only source of light, and he wished and wished and wished.
"Deal, Draco," Harry said, with his most winning smile.  Draco's heart melted.
"Go back to sleep," Draco said and cast a cleaning charm over them before wrapping his arms around Harry's shoulders and pulling him against his chest.  "We've got a long day tomorrow."
"What is it you want with Stephen?" he asked as Draco crossed the street.
Finally, the world grew more and more solid, clear.  It was still their valley, with the lake and the forest.  He saw the cabin, neat and whole and uncharred in any way.  There was no Rowle, no limp body bleeding from the head.  There were no heroes running from the forest and there wasn't any Draco waiting for him.  Draco was gone.
He turned towards the stairs and ascended, taking one at a time, his wand gripped in his sweaty palm.  The silk wallpaper was peeling and water stains created a mosaic of a map of Europe, or maybe it was the profile of a man with a very large chin.
"I hear Red Beard Riley's in town," a sailor for the
Everyone is there; well not everyone, but a lot of the old gang.  A lot of the DA.  Luna thinks back on those days with a smile.  Before joining up with Harry, those were the best days of her life.  It was the first time she'd ever had friends.

” He babbled when the Auror started thrusting, he hummed softly, feeling Neville’s lips on his chest, Neville’s hand intertwined with his, pinning it above his head, and Neville’s hot cock inside him. His skin was on fire, sweats beading on his forehead, if he bit his lips any harder, he could taste the blood.
“Oh, she…got an emergency” Harry lied, he wouldn’t want to cause the situation to be more awkward than it already was “Have you guys ordered?”
“If you say so” Hannah smirked, reaching over and pinched Draco’s cheek “If I have a Galleons every time you mention Harry’s name, I’d be fucking rich, Draco, trust me”
Hermione yelled to drown the noise and for Harry to hear her, the Auror turned around with a beer bottle in his hand and smiled gently at them coming to his spot “What time is it?”
I’m fine” Draco took a deep breath, putting his hands on Harry’s shoulder and sitting down until Harry was all inside him. The blond began bouncing up and down slowly to get used to the size, even when they have been doing it like rabbits ever since the vacation started, his entrance was still tight every time Harry thrust in “

“Still a tease” Draco smirked, breaking off their kiss and grabbed Harry’s hands, placing them directly on Draco’s arse “Just how bad do you want me, Auror Potter?”
“Alright, it’ll work, I think” Pansy looked down at the elegant golden swan mask which has a shimmery white finish and gold embellishments, with gold-plated metal swirls and sparkly jewels on, she grazed the mask softly with her fingers and nodded at Ron  “It’ll cover his whole face”

Pansy shrieked and glared at Ron “I didn’t know they were going to bail on us tonight”
“Me too” Potter smiled “I like you, so much too, so much that Ron is frustrated every time I talk about you, so much that I—…can I kiss you?”
“Of course I did” He smiled at Pansy’s answer, his best friend led her wife to their table and the music began
