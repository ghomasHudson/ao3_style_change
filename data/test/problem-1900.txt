Molly and her six children stood by the back door of the Burrow, waiting for the mourners to arrive and greeting them solemnly as the group grew larger. It was a private funeral, by invitation only – hence the special portkeys. What with Arthur’s recent promotion, many people had contacted the Weasleys about funeral arrangements, but only those closest to the family and the entire Department of Magical Law Enforcement were allowed.
Harry blushed but nodded nonchalantly. “Snape gave me permission to use magic because of the amount of danger I’m in, as well as helping him out more quickly and easily. The Ministry isn’t any the wiser; it could just as easily be Snape performing all the magic.”
Ron turned towards Harry, who was sitting at the other end of the table, on the side across from Ron. “I’m sorry, Harry. I can’t promise I’ll never be an idiot again, but I can promise to try at least. You’re my best mate, and if these people are who you choose as your family, then I support you and your family.”
Harry sighed and nodded, appreciating Draco’s comforting weight even more as the Slytherin practically crawled into his lap like a house cat. “A little, but I’ll be alright. Severus will be there, and it’s not like I haven’t talked to the Weasleys a million times before.”
Harry let the letter droop in his hand and he ran his fingers over his face. Draco had taken ill again? That was three times in the last two months, no one should be getting that ill that often without someone finding the proper cause for it. He pursed his lips tightly. He needed to do a little extra research, he was sure he had missed something in Draco's personal file that Severus had allowed his to study for his presentation. He wanted to be able to help Draco, even if he had to create a potion from scratch for that very purpose. Judging from the symptoms that Draco had written about in previous problems he was sure that there was a stronger potion and an additional salve that could be used to bring Draco's fever down and to help clear the air that got into his lungs. He just needed another month to brew it, which would eat a significant amount of hi studying time. However, he mentally concluded as he stared off out of his window, if he were to use Draco's illnesses as a means of passing his exams, the studying would simply go hand in hand with the potion. First off he would take one of the potions to Draco and access his responses and then alter the potion accordingly if it did not work.
Draco wasn't aware that he was crying until a choked sob sounded out through his mouth. He sobbed and choked and cupped his hands over his mouth because every emotion possible came flooding to his head. Of all things, he didn't think Harry would ever do such a thing, especially if anyone were to find either of the rings. The risks were too great, the catastrophe it would cause would force them both into exile, or even a prison, and they would lose everything they'd worked so hard to get. He knew it all, it took a while to sink in, but he did. And yet –when he looked into Harry's gleaming green eyes, his toned naked body, and that simple band of pure gold lying in a velvet box, he couldn't help but feel every part of him go weak, almost as though he was suddenly floating in the air. Wiping roughly at his face he dropped himself onto his knees in front of Harry, his cane clattering to the floor as he cupped Harry's face in his hands and started pressing warm, wet kissed against his lips, brow and cheeks and nipping at his throat and mouth. "I'll be your husband Harry! I will, I will, I will!" he gushed through wet sobs as he pressed himself against Harry, their arms snaking around one another and clinging to one another as much as they could. He pulled away, his head dropping down against Harry's shoulder, "W-what am I supposed to do? I can't wear it around all day. Mother would get suspicious."
"Draco, this chocolate nemesis is gorgeous!" Harry moaned as he devoured his chocolate cake greedily. Draco grinned brightly as he watched Harry's old appetite wake-up within his lover.
As they entered the stuffy classroom and settled down to read Slughorn's words on the backboard as the stout main babbled on. That's when the idea hit Blaise. He was surprised it hadn't occurred to him before. He scribbled out a quick note to Pansy and slid it over the desk to her. She frowned over at him and unfolded the note out of sight from Draco who was looking lost and forlorn once again, his pale skin looking sickly in the gloom of the classroom.
As they took their seats on the tram Harry rested his weary head on his lover's shoulder, grateful that they were able to use a tram instead of having to walk. His eyes were half open and staring blankly as they traveled along the promenade, the sun glistening off of the sea and through the long windows. It was truly a beautiful place to be. He was grateful that Draco had gone through all of this trouble for him. He had no idea where they were presently going but he did not mind. He was happy to go anyway as long as he held the food down for the remainder of the evening.
Draco smiled and placed a kiss on Harry's forehead as he went about booking the hotel, "I think some sun and sand will do everyone a great deal of good."
He snatched his lovers hand in his own and drew it to his lips, "Hey, hey, it's alright. I'm here okay? I'm not going anywhere just yet. I know you tried. I'm glad that you tried." He leaned over and cupped Harry's face in his hand and stroked his thumb over the bristled cheek, "I'm
Draco frowned, "You really should learn to call her Pansy, Harry. Even if it's just to me. I'm trying with your friends, you know."
Hermione had been the one to help him charm the shirt after Ron had made the point about the fact that Harry couldn't be around the blonde all the time to protect him. That had given Harry an idea and after a week or so of searching in the library he had found a series of protective charms for garments that aurors would sometimes wear, and despite it taking another week to learn some of the basics, he was more than grateful to prepare a surprise Christmas get away for Ron and Hermione to Switzerland as repayment. He had kept the shirt for another two weeks for 'the right time'. He hoped that Draco was grateful. He had done his best to be discreet. He knew that humiliation was a stain that didn't wash off as easily as dirty dish-water.
Severus shrugged, "I don't see why that would be a problem," he gave a weak smirk, "Besides, I haven't seen Draco this relaxed in months."
"Do whatever you want," he finally submitted unable to deny the obvious lust burning its way through his chest as he looked up into Draco's arousing smoky grey eyes. The taste of his mouth still hot and wet on Harry's lips as he licked them, "Do whatever you want to me, Draco Malfoy; just don't you dare make me regret a moment of it!"
Hermione had offered to go with him to the hospital that afternoon, but he had declined with a small, sorrowful shake of his head. He did not want any sympathy. If he was going to continue living this way then he would need to be prepared for the worst. He'd hung up without a second thought.
"'Aco?" came Harry's scratched voice from his throat. He winced at how awful it sounded to his own ears as he squinted around the bleary room and saw his blonde lover finishing with the buttons on his pajama jacket. "Hmmm what time is it?" he groaned, using the heel of his hand to rub the soreness from his eyes.
"Mhm" came the sleepy response from the bald man as he nodded his head against the headrest, his eyes closed.
"Blaise are you sure this is really worth it?" Pansy asked one late night a week later. They had been meeting up and reading through their textbooks and mapping everything out so that they would be able to brew the potion in complete and utter secrecy.
Draco released his cock with a soft 'pop' and crawled up Harry's body and spread his naked thighs on either side of his lover's. He ground their erections together as Harry's nails raked ridges down his back. He arched heavily into the clawing and felt heat pool heavily between their bodies. "Draco -I -I want to -b-be in you," he rasped as he thrust his cock against Draco's abdomen.
' –he hadn't thought of Draco in that way for a very long time. The heavy shame that weighed down in his chest stayed with him until somewhere in the house the clock chimed eight o'clock in the morning.
It was very late into the evening when he came to the last box, having sent an awful lot of the old papers into the fireplace to burn. They were useless now anyway. When he came to that last box he frowned as it merely seemed to be a hazardous jumble of letters tossed about inside, with no real order to them whatsoever; the only way to tell them in any sort of order was the date scribbled in the bottom right hand corner of every envelope. Realisation bubbled to the forefront of his mind as he recognised some of the untidy, chicken scratch writing that adorned the first few letters.
"Sorry babe," Draco purred softly as he stopped at a cross-roads and walked over the tarmac towards the tram-stop. "Might as well get back to the hotel quickly so that we can get you all warmed up."
Draco didn't answer straight away. Instead he turned his head to the side so that he could watch Harry's profile glow softly in the dying light, the breeze tousling his hair. "I've known that you come here for a while," he admitted with an air of confidence that made the brunette's stomach jolt just a little. "But I thought I'd let you have your privacy for a little while."
He opted to run out and grab some take-away food. Then they could go straight to their apartment and eat it in front of the T.V. they weren't that far from home by this point, anyway. Only about twenty minutes or so. He pulled into a parking-lot outside of the huge, brightly lit florescent McDonalds and nudged Harry awake from his nap.
The night before the trial the Great Hall was buzzing with excitement as everyone else dug into their meal. Potter wasn't eating and Draco had only managed to force down a couple of bites. Watching from his seat at the Slytherin table he watched Potter look up at him and jerk his head slightly in the direction of the doors. Draco have a stiff nod and watched as Potter stood up, made his excuses to his friends and ducked out of the hall.
Where Number Four Privet Drive used to be, there stood the smoldering wreckage of some sort of explosion, far beyond being recognizable as a house. Smoke was rising from many small fires littered in the debris, but all else was still. The neighboring houses had not been affected in the slightest bit, nor did their in habitants seem to be aware that Number Four had been blown to bits.
They both laughed as the portrait of Albus Dumbledore gave a soft chuckle in his sleep. Severus knew all of the past Headmasters and –mistresses only pretended to sleep, while really listening to every word they said. This was his way of giving Albus a hard time, even after the man had left the realm of the living. He missed the old man dearly.
“How do we destroy them? We’ve searched every book we can find, and Hermione has come up with a few theories, but we’re afraid to test them in case she’s wrong.”
The Great Hall stayed silent for a few seconds after Dumbledore resumed his seat, and then quite a loud burst of chatter broke out.
However, Severus also noticed how very determined Harry had become to master Occlumency. The boy was almost passionate about it, and was much easier to teach when he was so ready to learn. If Harry was this receptive in Potions class, the boy might actually be able to make a Calming Draught without melting cauldrons and desks. That particular class was indeed a train wreck.
Harry rolled his eyes, finding it quite amusing that both Hermione and his father had used the same phrasing to spout off that information. Apparently Hermione wasn’t the only one to memorize information verbatim. “Yes, I’ve been told. That doesn’t change the fact that it happened, and I was nearly killed by the bloody castle. My dad reckons the wards might have been altered.”
“I missed you too, you imbecile,” Severus said, though his tone was affectionate, and the extra moisture in his eyes told Remus all he needed to know. He was forgiven, at least for the most part. “Don’t you ever do that to me again, because you won’t be forgiven so easily next time,” Severus said, his expression quite serious.
Remus sighed as he sat down beside Harry, pushing his trunks easily underneath the bed with a single foot. “As soon as I stepped out of the floo at Grimmauld Place, he asked me to go on another mission. I lost my temper and said a few –
Abby shook her head gently as she continued on towards her destination. She had just managed to spare a few minutes to come check on the Malfoy boy; she really shouldn’t have dawdled as much as she already had. She stopped abruptly as she spotted Severus sitting beside Draco’s bed, his head cradled tiredly in his hand. “Are you alright, Severus?” she asked timidly, hoping she wasn’t stumbling upon some uncharacteristic display of emotion on Snape’s part.
No one seemed to be willing to volunteer, probably after remembering the practical lessons with Snape, which were slightly more daunting than what Remus would probably have them do. Harry sighed heavily as he raised his hand, but felt glad that he did in the next instant when Blaise Zabini was the second volunteer. Now he would get to pay Zabini back for threatening Draco, and show him what would happen if he ever cared to make good on that threat.
Remus frowned as he sat beside Severus on his bed, his body pressed close to the other man’s on the narrow mattress. He leaned over and ran a hand through the Potions Professor’s ruffled hair, making it even more unruly. It actually closely resembled Harry’s hair before Severus put his usual charms on it. “It doesn’t matter. Were you dreaming?” Remus asked in a whisper.
“Harry, if you would be so kind as to explain everything that you can, it would be much appreciated,” Dumbledore said as he stepped out of the crowd towards the shell-shocked group of people still standing at the edge of the forest.
Severus sat beside Draco, his robes bunching up around him. He didn’t exactly know what to say, but he knew the truth of the matter. He hoped that would be enough.
“You do have a point, after all…Well, I suppose we can have an Inter-Ministry workings group. After all, there are quite a few of you who work for the Ministry, and we can use that leverage, should we ever need it. Percy, it’s all yours.” Minerva tried very hard not to laugh at the look of self-importance on her former-student’s face.
Harry felt extremely emotional all of a sudden and had to blink back to moisture in his eyes. He never thought he’d live to hear Snape praise his father, of all people. It was definitely a culture shock, to say the least. “Thank you, Professor, for saying that. I still know hardly anything about him – my mum, too.”
Remus took a deep drink of his tea before answering Harry. “It went as well as could have been expected with Voldemort in such a foul mood. He sincerely hadn’t any idea Severus was a double agent until – well, I’m sure you remember. He was torturing people left and right for not knowing the truth either, as if it was all everyone else’s fault that Severus was such a good liar.”
Severus couldn’t begin to think about the utter despair he felt when he saw his son, mixed with the relief that Harry was alive. His anger eclipsed his joy so completely; he couldn’t stand to be around his son at the moment. If he were honest with himself, Severus would know that his anger was a mask, a tourniquet to staunch the flow of his sadness and guilt. However, denial was something Severus definitely excelled at.
“Calm down, Harry me lad! We’ve taken the necessary precautions, we assure you,” Charlie said as he wrapped a heavily muscled arm around Harry’s shoulders and drug him over to one of the sofas.
“It gets kind of blurry after that, because one of the men made me drink something and my vision and hearing got really fuzzy, but...they...they stripped me and...and touched me...”
“You know as well as I do that Lucius has been able to skirt questions under Veritaserum before. I don’t think it would be wise to peruse the Pensieve just yet. What I’d like is to speak with the man myself,” Severus said, pausing in his pacing with a look on concentration on his face.
Remus shrugged, giving Harry a sympathetic look. “Dumbledore’s advice has always been highly valued among the Order members for just that reason, Harry, but lately he seems to be putting too much at risk for gains that we know nothing about. If he can’t be honest with us and lay all his plans out on the table, then why should we be willing to risk our lives for him? It’s just proper courtesy, and Dumbledore has apparently forgotten his manners.”
,” Harry groused, staring at the two plain beds shoved into opposite corners of the tent. “Think Professor McGonagall would count off points if we simply transfigured the two beds into one?”
“We have a problem, folks,” Mad-Eye growled, looking around the table at the group of people assembled, his magical eye swirling madly about.
Shortly after, everyone gathered around the small marquee in the back garden, whispering their final goodbyes to Arthur as they added a single flower to the lid of his casket, each representing a different well-wish to take with him on the next journey. As was tradition, all the Weasley men and Harry (and Ginny, because Molly couldn’t persuade her otherwise) lowered the casket into the pre-dug grave, and reburied it by hand. A headstone was placed flat into the earth, marking Arthur’s final resting place forever more.
“Aren’t you going to tell us about practicing safe sex and all of that rot?” Draco sent the Gryffindor an indignant glare that just made Remus laugh and Severus roll his eyes.
Hermione frowned, her bushy curls crackling with the flames. “I’m guessing you can’t tell us exactly where you are, either? We don’t even know who answered the floo, as they fled the room before we could see.”
Severus noticed the bitter note in Harry’s voice and couldn’t help but share the teen’s feelings. However much Dumbledore gushed how important Severus was to him, the old man certainly wasn’t worrying himself over the Potions Master now. “I’m sure the Order have a good reason for keeping you waiting, Harry, but you’ve no need to worry; I’m fine, thanks to you and Lupin. I would surely have died if not for the werewolf’s quick thinking and your assistance.”
from behind the curtain surrounding the bed to Harry’s left, startling Remus. As he stood up to check everything was alright, a disgruntled Healer flung the curtain back and gave Remus a dark look, his nostrils flaring as he slapped a vial of potion into the werewolf’s palm.
Harry began to protest, but clamped his mouth shut as he father gave him a stern look and left the room to fetch the Defence Professor. He hoped that the dream had not faded too much, and that he’d not imagined what he saw.
“We were wondering if you wanted to switch rooms with Draco. His room is right next to the one Hermione and Ginny are sharing, so we thought you might want to be a bit closer to Hermione and all,” Harry quickly explained, wary of the dark look spreading across Ron’s face.
Hermione smacked her forehead, looking crestfallen and angry. “I should have known that! Why didn’t I think of that?”
Dumbledore frowned as he wiped the dirt from his robes. He looked directly into Severus’ black eyes and contemplated for a moment before nodding. “I will not tell Harry about this. However, I hope that the day will come when you can tell him about it yourself. Harry may still have his aunt, uncle, and cousin, but he needs someone there for him in the Wizarding world as well. It would benefit you both. Alas, I will respect your wishes and keep your act of kindness secret from the boy. Thank you, Severus,” the old man said with a warm smile.
Harry pulled out his wand and gave it a complicated twirl, conjuring a glass of cool, clear water. He handed it to Snape and sat down on the edge of the bed near Snape’s feet. “How’re you feeling?”
Draco slammed his fork down, upsetting the pitcher of pumpkin juice and sloshing the orange liquid everywhere. “No,
Severus walked forward and grabbed Harry’s shoulders, forcing the boy to look him straight in the eyes. There was a spark as Harry’s magic began to get out of control over his anger. “Listen to me very closely, Harry! When you stopped the stone during the warding, what did you do wrong?”
Severus shrugged as he pulled his knees up closer to his chest, resting his chin in his palm, his elbow leaning on his propped up knee. He usually wouldn’t be so blatantly blasé around other people, but he was comfortable with Harry and he frankly didn’t care if Remus saw him so relaxed. “He is fairly elderly and not getting any younger, Harry. It would not be such a surprise if Dumbledore went senile; it would only be a great loss and an even greater problem. Without Dumbledore, I’m afraid the Order would fall apart due to woeful ignorance alone; only a few of us have any idea how to go about things without relying heavily on Dumbledore’s guidance or instructions. It would pose a huge threat to the safety of the Light; that I am sure of.”
As little as Harry wished to be bothered today, he couldn’t find it in himself to brush Ginny off. He already knew this was going to be about Quidditch; it usually was. “What’s up?” he asked lamely.
“You lot be careful,” she told the assembled group as they lined up to use the floo. “I’ll be calling an Order meeting within the next couple of days. I do want Severus to be there, but we have many things to discuss and no time to waste.”
me. I’ll try to be quieter,” Draco said in an undertone, his voice a slight bit frostier than he had intended for it to be. He shouldn’t being taking things out on Hermione; none of his problems were her fault.
“Ok, Draco. The most important part of learning to cast your Patronus is the memory that you choose. In order to successfully cast a full corporeal Patronus, you have to focus on a very happy memory, preferably the happiest memory you have. A Patronus is the embodiment of pureness and is your protector. It will use the power from your happy memory, and project a familiar, the animal that represents your soul. Understand?” Harry explained, getting back into the hang of teaching quite quickly. He vaguely thought that teaching was going to be in his future as a career.
ran an exclusive on Peter Pettigrew’s rise from the ‘dead’ and his confessed betrayal of his once close friends. Sirius Black had been cleared of all charges, posthumously.
“I want you to know that I am not doing this as a favour to anyone; not to Harry, nor Albus, or even you, Remus. I’m doing this because I want to, and because I owe it to Harry after everything I’ve put him through. Besides, you were more correct than I think you realize when you said I needed you as much as you needed me,” said Severus, turning to speak to Harry once more, who looked a wreck after all the crying he’d done in such a short amount of time.
“That’s precisely what I mean when I say it takes practise. In time you’ll learn to be able to keep the shield up without really thinking about it. It will start to become second nature to you, but only if you put in the effort to make it so. Yes, you’ll most likely concentrate on it a lot in the beginning, but that will change. Think of it this way; how do you know your block is still up while you’re sleeping? If you had to concentrate on that shield, you’d never get any sleep. Think about how it feels to pull up that block just before drifting off to sleep, remember that feeling, and try to apply it to keeping the shield up while awake. Does that make more sense?” Draco asked, feeling his own head pounding from re-explaining everything multiple times in many different ways for the Gryffindor. He was certainly being remarkably patient with his thick-skulled school mate.
“At least someone will be searching for you, since Fudge didn’t see fit to put any effort into finding you. Has Kingsley really filed an impeachment against him to the Wizengamot?” Remus asked.
“Are you feeling better, Harry?” Tonks asked as she leaned her elbows on the table, her chin rested on her palm. Her hair was a deep shade of purple today and fell elegantly to her shoulders, framing her pale, heart shaped face nicely.
“You gave us all quite a fright, Harry. I know some of us are taking things better than others. But it seems as though we’ve all been extremely selfish. We’re all so worried about how we feel about everything, but has anyone bothered to ask you how you’re feeling?”
There was silence for some minutes while the three occupants of the dungeon quarters sipped at their tea and glanced nervously around at each other. Finally, when the tea had dried up and there were no further distractions, the Casewitch lifted her quill and fixed the prospective father and son with a sharp look.
Severus snorted as he flicked his own hair out of his face and crossed his arms across his chest. “You wish.”
Lucius didn’t look very appreciative of the comment himself, but he didn’t indulge the Minister in his thoughts at all, instead turning to look at the Headmaster. “The first thing I think should happen is making sure no more of the Ministry’s employees can be put under the Imperius curse. Having our own Ministry plants as part of the Order will help us with that, not to mention having the Minister himself here. The Unspeakables experimentation with the magic stripping potions needs to be stopped as well. Without that potion, these plans become futile.”
the same,” was the first thing that came out of Harry’s mouth, and it was in a properly horrified tone.
“I love you so much,” Harry whispered, running his fingers through Draco’s icy locks, kissing his cheeks and forehead.
Harry beamed and hugged Remus quickly, glad that the man hadn’t warned him off the idea entirely. He knew how important that watch was to Severus. He just hoped he was doing to right thing. “Thanks, Remus. I’ll start talking loudly about N.E.W.T.s with Hermione if they happen to come in while you’re still in there, alright?”
“He said it was too dangerous. What he’s teaching me, it can go very wrong if the knowledge falls into the wrong hands,” Harry said, his tone earnest as he felt Draco stiffen beside him.
That feeling of complete acceptance, of contentment filled him with so much happiness. Knowing he would never have to give either of the people he loved the most up was, to date, his happiest memory.
“Wait a minute. I don’t want everyone jumping into the pensieve and watching that memory, Dad. I don’t…I don’t think
Fred leaned over, looking down the table towards Lucius as George prodded him in the side impatiently. “We’re of Snape’s opinion over here. Professor Dumbledore’s word is a pretty hefty thing and all, but this man was the reason our baby sister nearly died five years ago. How could we possibly trust him?”
“Maybe you should try waking Draco up. Tell him Harry is…er, back. I’m going to check up on Harry,” Remus said as he started to pull away from his husband. He lost balance as his arm was pulled back, and he fell onto Severus’ chest with an ‘
“I love you too, Hermione Granger,” Ron whispered before placing a gentle kiss on Hermione’s forehead. He was glad he finally got over his fight with Harry and got Hermione back. He couldn’t imagine a future without this wonderful woman by his side.
“Fine, you may go on your own, but I will be checking in on you in about an hour, and I don’t want to hear any back talk, understand me? I understand this is all a bit much for you to handle right now, but the last thing you should be doing is pushing the people who care about you away. We’ll give you your space, but you need to realize that we are only trying to help, so stop with the attitude. And no, I don’t have any classes to teach because it’s Saturday, smart-aleck.”
“I did it for you,” Severus whispered against the werewolf’s ear, causing the man to shiver slightly in his embrace.
“On the count of three, Harry. One…two…three!” Remus shouted as he wrenched the lid of the trunk open and stepped back so as not to affect the boggart himself.
“Just imagine how Harry feels, if his death is affecting you so. I’m sorry, love,” Remus whispered, holding his husband tightly to his chest as the man shook and tried to fight off the emotions taking him over. They both jumped as the Floo flared to life and expelled the new Headmistress.
Remus paused and turned towards the young Slytherin, taking a deep breath as he prepared for panic to reign. “Draco, Harry has seemingly gone missing at some point. The alarm has been raised and a castle and grounds-wide search has begun. I need you to stay calm, and stay with me, alright? I may have a way of finding out exactly where Harry is.”
Severus looked up and realized the entire staff room was staring expectantly at him, their excited anticipation of the outcome warming Severus more than he was willing to admit. “I’ve been approved to continue on with the adoption process; I passed the background check.”
“Pensieve memories of the meetings and raids. Because I wasn’t actually giving him the specific information, it wasn’t technically breaking any of the oaths or vows. I was having a hard time separating the memories out, though, because I’m not a very good Occlumens. Once I finally got all of them separated and into vials for Malfoy, I had already been there for more than a week. After that, it took him another week to watch them all, and then give them back to me. Once I had them all back, he began to try to question me without breaking any of the vows or oaths. We actually had fun trying to figure out ways to ask and answer the questions,” Tonks said with a smirk as she sipped at the cup of tea that Remus had passed her.
It was a free period already, and because of his grounding, Harry made his way down to the dungeons to spend the period in his room, revising for the test he had in Potions on Thursday. He sat his book bag heavily on the couch, pulling out his Potions book to take to his room. When he turned to walk down the hall he felt his heart jump in his throat as he drew his wand and brandished it.
” Harry snapped again, stomping over to his bed and flopping onto it, curling himself up in his blankets and ignoring his father as he snuffed out his candle with a heavy sigh.
“I think, Harry, that Albus does not think these bigger plans concern you. He wants you as little involved as possible, and so sets the Order to take care of the rest. He said he had something important to discuss with you, and he could put it off no longer. I expect he’ll be asking to speak with you soon,” Severus said, very irritated himself with the Headmaster. He knew the man was keeping something else from him, something that concerned Harry, and that was almost unforgivable to him.
“What are you laughing at?” Harry asked grumpily, digging through his trunk for a clean set of robes and his tie. He jumped as he felt two arms wrap around his bare waist, but smiled as he stood up straight and felt Draco’s some-what pointy chin lean on his bare shoulder.
“Body bind and blood boiling; he’s going to feel that for a while,” George replied as he and his brother weaved through the many duels, lighting fireworks, throwing fistfuls of Peruvian dark powder, setting off traps and taking out Death Eaters faster than they could even block. They were an unstoppable team.
“I can prove it to you,” Dumbledore said, pulling his wand out of his sleeve. He peered around the room, and his eyes alighted on the small wardrobe in the corner. With a casual flick of his wand, the wardrobe went up in flames. He watched as Tom made a noise of horror and jumped off the bed.
“You know Dad would probably kill you if he heard you walking around referring to him as ‘Sev’ all the time. He only let’s Moony do that, and even that’s a rare occurrence.”
There wasn’t time to both protect herself and Charlie. She could get one spell off before MacNair struck again, and she knew what she needed to do. Tonks heard Charlie scream her name as she pointed her wand at him and cast a shield spell, leaving herself in the open. Before Charlie could reach his wand and before she could cast another spell, Tonks was hit from behind by a spell from MacNair.
Pansy sniffled as she tried to keep her tears in, summoning her wand back to her with wandless magic. With one last pathetic glance at Draco, she turned and led the other two Slytherin oafs out of the infirmary.
Harry was afraid that Draco was going to cry for a second, but instead the blonde launched himself at Harry, latching onto his mouth and wrapping his arms tightly around his neck. Harry kissed back, pulling the Slytherin practically in his lap. He heard Hermione giggle quietly behind him, but he didn’t care. When Draco finally pulled away, he stayed extremely close – close enough that Harry could almost count his pale eyelashes one by one.
“I’m sure there’s one of those bloody things in this house somewhere. Moody helped us clean them out the summer before fifth year, but I’m sure a few more have moved in. We should ask Mad-Eye to find us one again,” Ron suggested from beside Hermione. He had been especially quiet throughout the discussion, and when Harry sent him a questioning look, Ron turned bright red and glanced at Hermione out of the corner of his eye. Interesting indeed…
“How dare you talk that way about my Master?! He is more of a man than you’ll ever be, bitty baby Potter!” Bellatrix shrieked as she pushed more and more force into her Cruciatus curse. Her eyes were blazing, and her hair practically crackled with the amount of magic she was pouring into her wand.
“I know, Dad. Thanks,” Harry said, leaning against his father once more, and closing his eyes as the man ran his fingers through his messy locks. He was so very lucky.
that feeling from the Potions Master to survive. “Thank you, sir. I…You’re right, I don’t want the fame – I never have, and never will. I mean, if it ends up being useful in the war as a sort of propaganda technique, then I guess I’ll use it to my advantage, but other than that, I wish everyone would just let me live my life in peace. Especially Rita Skeeter.”
“What do you mean, Harry? Why can you tell us, but not them? That doesn’t make sense to me,” said Ron, his expression bewildered.
“Perhaps not everything, but enough. He finally figured out that, in both instances, Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback were at the heart of the attacks. Oh, I was given permission to release that information by Kingsley, by the way,” Tonks replied as she refilled her tea cup.
’ before when I was helping Lupin heal all of your wounds after Voldemort had at you. Forgive me for trying to help.” Harry turned around and nodded his head towards the kitchen door as a signal to Draco before entering the kitchen himself.
“I know, love. We will be; there’s no other choice. Harry, if I could have a word with you in private?”
“Night, Remus.” Harry pulled off his trainers and socks, laying them beside the bed and pulling his tee shirt off over his head. As he lay his head down on his pillows, he couldn’t help but feel he had torn some sort of hole in the patched up relationship between Snape and Remus, and it made him feel horrible.
“Minerva is fine, Severus. We’ve known each other too long to mess about with trivial things like professionalism. I remember you’re sorting, for Merlin’s sake!” Minerva said with a good-natured chuckle at the younger man.
While Harry knew he wouldn’t leave, no matter how Sirius reacted, he nodded his agreement. He and Remus performed a wizard’s oath with Severus to send Sirius back after it was all over and then it was time.
That night, Harry took a dose of Dreamless Sleep before bed like instructed. The potion was not tampered with, and it could be trusted one hundred percent, as Severus had made it with his own two hands. That night, Harry had the dream
Remus stepped away from Harry and closer to Snape, his own amber eyes flashing gold in a clear warning sign from the wolf. “No, you back off, Snape. Harry is as good as my son and I won’t let you take this away from him. He deserves to know the details of the Prophecy more so than anyone else, including Dumbledore!” he shouted, his voice shaking in anger along with the rest of his slightly taller frame.
Remus pulled out his wand and conjured a bowl of warm water and a wash cloth. He began to sponge away the dried blood and muck around a few open wounds that he could see on Snape’s abdomen and chest. “He’s alive, but only just. He’s covered in flesh wounds; looks like he was hit with a Cutting hex over and over. I’m sure he has quite a few broken bones as well. Here, take this cloth and very carefully clean around the wounds so that I can start healing them,” Remus said as he conjured another cloth and handed it to Harry. He turned to look at Charlie, who was standing back with his wand still raised.
“But wasn’t Riddle raised in a muggle orphanage? He may be a prejudiced arse, but he’s no stranger to muggles,” George pointed out, his brother nodding in agreement beside him.
Harry was slightly taken aback at not only Snape’s use of Voldemort’s name, but at what the man had just admitted. “A promise to my mother’s memory…?” he asked tentatively as he uncurled his legs and scooted down a bit on the bed.
“Harry, did Dumbledore tell you which Horcrux he was going after, or where it was? We have to find out for sure if he destroyed it or not. If we operate on the assumption that Professor Dumbledore destroyed it and he didn’t, we could end up in serious trouble. They
“Now, now, none of that please. Professor Snape is very good at Defense and is a more than capable replacement for my own teaching. Now I know there was a…
Draco yawned as he scooted even closer to Harry, wrapping his arms firmly around the Gryffindor. “I don’t blame him, Harry. I’m so confused about my father right now...”
Harry snorted derisively and rolled his eyes. “Good question. Let me know when someone finds out, because I haven’t a bloody clue.”
Harry bit his lip, knowing that he was going to have to tell Draco; he couldn’t deny him an answer now. Besides, Draco didn’t know just how very close he was to the truth with his assumptions. “Severus is going to kill me...” Harry swallowed hard and nodded his head slowly, finally meeting Draco’s eyes.
“Right in front of me!” Harry gasped as he cut his father off, sitting up straight as something seemed to click in his brain. “It makes too much sense. Voldemort killed Dad and then went after Mum. He would have had time afterwards to make a Horcrux before going after me, and he wouldn’t care that he did it right in front of me because I was supposed to die. I saw it happen!”
“...To Accept You; Past, Present, and Future.” Remus had no idea what to say. This meant so much more to him than he could ever explain. That Severus was willing to cast aside his feelings towards the people who had made his life as a teenager a living hell for him; it was priceless. He was broken out of his reverie by Severus getting to his feet. He was afraid he had offended the man, but in the next second his breath was stolen once more. Where Severus had stood there was now a rather large, rather sleek black panther, it’s dark eyes immediately recognizable as the Potions Master’s.
Harry felt his heart melt into a puddle in his chest as he floated off of his chair and into his jacket, Draco's arms giving him a loving squeeze as he fumbled with the zip. With a small, tender kiss to his cheek, Harry allowed himself to be gently led from the restaurant, all the while his eyes were flitting back to his left hand and the beautiful ring that now glimmered on it, declaring to the world that he belonged to one, Draco Malfoy. He sniffed and cuffed his nose as he leaned into Draco's warm embrace as they walked casually down the street towards the promenade that was now dusted with the darkening blue sky of the night.
It was painfully obvious to everyone in the room that Lucius Malfoy was a very eloquent, charismatic speaker. If he hadn’t been using money to gain the upper hand when it came to politics, his power of persuasive speech would have gotten him anything he wanted just the same. However, there was a definite intensity in the air that suggested not all of the Order were ready to believe this man.
“He was looking for a Horcrux. He wouldn’t tell me where he was going, and he refused to take me along, even though he had promised to take me before.”
Draco had been whispering with Ginny and Hermione the last couple of days, abruptly stopping any time Harry joined them. It was obvious they were plotting something, and the fact that his birthday was coming up made it obvious that it was something for him. He appreciated the excitement for his coming of age, but he really wasn’t all that concerned about celebrating; they had more important things to worry about.
“Dramatic, that one,” Remus commented with a smirk as he watched Ron continue to fumble around the sinks and taps. With a noise of discovery, the redhead finally identified the right tap and pulled out his wand.
Harry sighed heavily as he stood up slowly, only realizing as he tried to move how incredibly tired he really was. Occlumency really was a pain in the arse – and the head, Harry mused as he rubbed the bruised spot on his forehead where he’d met the cold stone floor. He tried to ignore his Potions Professor as he turned his back to him and pulled his shirt off over his head and reached for his pyjama top. He stumbled as his vision swam in his tired state, nearly sending him to the floor again. He felt a strong hand close over his bare arm and looked up to find Snape standing beside him.
what I’m talking about here; I spent twenty years learning every action and attitude of the people who support the Dark Lord. With the escaped Death Eaters on the loose, I can promise you that Lucius, Bellatrix, Rodolphus, Rabastan, or Avery have her. MacNair or Mulciber may even have been able to pull it off if they had help from someone else. You find those seven, and you’ll find the Auror; mark my words.”
“Apparation is out of the question with the state you’re in. I have an emergency portkey that we’ll have to use. I’m afraid you’ll probably feel plenty of discomfort either way; I’ll try to make it as painless as possible.” Remus bent down and wrapped the cloak he had taken off more securely around Snape’s shaking body. He carefully slid his hands underneath the man and lifted him easily, using his extra strength that his Lycanthropy allotted him. He reached into the front of his robes and pulled out a necklace shaped like a phoenix.
Harry closed his eyes and let the baritone of his father’s voice pull him into a sort of trance. He breathed in a shuddering breath, and breathed out all of the worry, panic, fear, and sadness. He felt his father’s warm, secure arms around him, could sense Sirius’ protective presence as well. He was not alone. He could do this.
“Or else what? Who the hell does he think he is, Voldemort’s poster-boy junior Death Eater? He lays one finger on you and I’ll break every bone in his damn body. He’s the one making the mistake by threatening my boyfriend.”
"Well they're not exactly being ignorant," Ginny stated mildly as she looked over at Harry for support. "I mean, he did do most of the things they're accusing him of."
Harry looked up at he approached the table and the surprise was bright in his eyes. It softened his stormy features for a moment as he swallowed, "D-Draco? What're you doing here?" he asked as he leaned back in his chair.
Draco didn't even pretend to look offended of having a wand jabbed into his leg. Even to this day, after months of progress, there were still the odd group of students who still weren't keen on having 'death eater's' in the school any longer. According to them, it didn't matter that the Dark Mark on Draco's forearm had seared and burned for a week straight after Voldemort's demise and was now just a patch of raw, red skin that had scabbed over and was finally healing. The bullying was mostly being taken care of, but there was still the odd night when Draco would come back into the eighth year common room and with blood running down into his collar from a busted nose.
The list went on with other similar things and just after Draco had written about the last time he had been happy in –even remotely happy –down at the very bottom of the parchment, he went back up to the bullet points, the nib of his quill hovering in his quaking hand before he finally wrote down what he could never voice out loud.
"Lord Malfoy, this is my protégée who I was telling you about last night. He is the only one out of my new apprentices who has managed to surpass the average standards of our work at the hospital. I am going to hire him as a part time assistant after this weekend as he is absolutely invaluable to the progress of our research at the hospital."
Harry frowned as he tore his eyes away from the tinsel stars that glimmered from one wall where they were stuck with a sticking charm. "What do you mean? We can't have another 'first Christmas'."
"That was the best thing ever!" Harry grinned breathlessly as they collapsed into their bedroom, Seeker bounding inside and rolling all over the floor. Draco chuckled, his cheeks glowing as he locked the bedroom door and turned the key in the lock as always. They had just returned from taking the Blackpool Tower Dungeon tour -it was like London Dungeons only scarier! They had even had a surprise ride at the end and the pictures from the 'hanging experience' were hilarious! The previous day they had had a photo of them and Seeker photoshopped onto a sharks back framed, and also the new one from the Tower Dungeons that they had gotten that morning. They had returned to the hotel after a quick lunch.
to get better, Draco. I was so afraid when I saw you on that pier that I –I wanted to be in your place. I wanted to be the one knocking at deaths door. At least then you'd have been able to move on and get a new life. I have nothing without you, Draco."
Draco shook his head with a heavy sigh, "I don't want you to sit around all night and think of an excuse." He peered up through his fringe, "I just want to spend some time with you. I haven't been sleeping well these past few months because of the late nights you've been pulling and I just want to spend time with you. I'm the
With a roll of his eyes, Draco dropped his head back on the pillow, slowly spreading his legs to give Harry easier access. The first finger was a tight fit and made him flushed and uncomfortable. Although, Harry devouring his dick as he did so was more than distracting enough. Reaching out, Draco raised his hips and tangled his fingers in the soft black hair. He slid his knees up over Harry's shoulders to make everything easier.
Draco was clearly fighting the instinct to go back to sleep. He reached out a slack arm and twitched his fingers in Harry's direction, "Come back to bed," he hummed softly, his eyes struggling to stay open
The following morning before breakfast he found a neat little parcel wrapped and tucked under his pillow at some point during the night. It was soft and squished easily between his fingers. He gingerly opened the wrapping and he felt his stomach swirl with emotions. In his lap he was holding his shirt that had gotten damaged; it was soft and fresh, clean and hummed ever-so-softly of magic between his fingertips. Tucked into the breast pocket was a little note. He unfolded it and read the words scribbled onto it;
Harry spread the pale legs even wider, pressing himself flat against Draco as he nipped a trail up his throat, revelling in the soft panting coming from his lover.
"Draco you're scaring me?" came Harry's shaking voice to Draco's ears, though it was more of an echo.
Severus inclined his head, a smirk itching to crawl onto his lips, "Naturally. I'm sure there are a few healers below Harry he would do an excellent job but I can send a friend of mine in to oversee things if your concern is truly that great." His cool dark eyes dared Harry to challenge him. He knew that the young man wouldn't be able to find anything to argue with, and it was present in his manner when he simply inclined his head before hunching over his bowl of yoghurt and fruit. Severus spared a look at Draco and inclined his head over his glass of pumpkin juice. Draco offered him the weakest of smiles that his tired features could offer and Severus accepted it. There was no doubt about it that something had occurred between the two younger men and he was determined to get to the bottom of it, even if did mean getting Harry to see some sense that he was working too much over taking care of himself and of Draco.
With a weary sigh, Draco turned off into their bedroom, ready to kick his shoes off, and stopped dead.
Pansy frowned as she idly flickered through her textbook, turning the pages slowly so as to appear not too eager. She finally settled on the appropriate page and her eyebrows shot up before she gave a smirk over to Blaise. The name of the potion on that page was Amortentia otherwise known as 'The Love Potion'. She was mildly impressed as she skipped the introduction -no one ever read those anyway -and started looking through the basics of the potion. According to the text it would take at least three weeks for the potion to brew properly. It seemed quite extensive for such a simple potion but there was no denying that the Harry definitely had a crush on their blonde friend -as obvious as the four-eyed kid was -and there was no denying that at least SOME of those feelings were reciprocated.
Every grunted word made Harry shiver as he felt himself harden a little through his trousers. He could distinctly see Draco's own arousal highlighted by the flickering flames dancing in the grate. He reached down with his quaking fingers, and –feeling brave –traced a line up the length of Draco's cock through his trousers and suppressed a smile as Draco hissed through his teeth and tilted his head back, exposing his beautiful white throat. "Do you like it when I touch you?" he murmured as he splayed his fingers around the thick length, feeling his stomach knot when he felt the hot, thick heat twitch under his palm.
,' once again the words faded and a new little message reappeared. In the early morning light, Draco held his breath and waited for the next message to appear. '
Something flickered in his chest and he was snapped back to reality, the heat of the sun and the fizzing of the bubbles before his eyes. Panic spiked through his mind and he lurched to his feet, his arms flaying out as the boat rocked under him. How long had he been daydreaming? Was it too long? Too late? It couldn't be –he wouldn't let it be. He wasn't about to give up on Draco and risking the rest of his life without those tender soft moments that stopped him from putting the pillow over his face.
As they sat in their Divination lesson, he discreetly tore out a page from his notebook and carefully wrote a message to Potter. He folded the paper into a little crane and spelled it to fly over the heads of his classmates. He watched as Potter jolted out of his bored, slumped state and carefully unfolded the crane under the table, despite Weasley being practically past out on his textbook.
Harry gasped and threw his head back against the back of the armchair. He was both ready and petrified for this. His body was sweating and tense. He tried to will himself to relax but he couldn't quite get there. It was hard to do when he felt Draco's long slender finger slip inside his body. He tensed, the tongue rolling over his balls trying to relax him but he was hypersensitive to every touch, every breath. He let out a moan as -very slowly -Draco started to work his finger into a rhythm. Harry's mouth fell open and his eyes rolled back as he let soft gasps whisper out into the air. His heart was speeding up as Draco took his dick back in his mouth. The combined sensation of Draco sucking his cock and fingering his arsehole was enough to make pleasure pop in every muscle.
As he made his way out of the hotel and towards the parking lot, he felt a small twisting nagging thought jab at his subconscious. Harry had made a wish that would not only help to clear Draco's name, but disperse of all the rumors that had encircled them for the last several years.
"Perhaps to most others, but I woke with people and bodies in all walks of life every day so don't think I won't notice an unnatural complexion when I see one staring me right in the face."
Draco shrugged, "why not? You're next course of treatment is not until Tuesday morning. I don't see what the harm would do. Besides -you look as though you could use some fresh air. You look paler than me," he reached over and smoothed his hand over Harry's bald head, the lack of feather-soft black hair made his stomach clench tightly.
A variety of emotions was racing through Draco as he helped Harry slip and slide over the linoleum flooring to the wheelchair, where he was propped up like a doll, a small fleece blanket wrapped over his legs, despite it was nearing the end of summer.
Harry tilted his head slightly to one side before sighing and extending his hand out for the blonde to shake, "Do we have a deal or not, Malfoy?"
he muttered under his breath as he glared out of the window at the bleak weather. He had to wait another twenty minutes in the biting wind and cold rain before a coach pulled up on the uneven cobbles and Draco pulled himself up into the cool dryness, shaking greasy rain water out of his hair and scrubbing it out of his eyes. Once he had given his address to the driver, he closed his eyes and listened to the pattering of the rain on the roof above his head.
Potter stopped short as he watched Draco breeze past him and make his way to the stands surrounding the arena. He glanced own at the blonde's arse and then jolted at what he'd done. Shaking his head he called out a firm, "No!"
Harry hummed and curled in on himself tighter. He felt drained and damaged and broken and a part of him thought that maybe this was what Draco had been feeling since the end of the war and it had no doubt gotten worse as the days had progressed and no one had offered him a hand of friendship or even understanding. No wonder the blonde was growing defeated and bitter.
"Harry, love? Are you going to wake up for me?" Draco whispered softly, resting his chin on his folded hands, resting on top of Harry's blankets.
"You've had that look on your face for a while. Something's been on your mind and people crowding around you isn't about to help the problem, is it?"
He had missed it; snuggling up with Harry on the sofa in front of the television, program or not program to fill the whispering silence that encircled them. He pressed his warm mouth against Harry's bald head and then rested his head against the back of the sofa and closed his eyes to sleep.
Harry's eyes were downcast as he nodded his damp cheek against Draco's palms. He blinked up and looked anywhere but at the blonde man leaning so close to him, his head was starting to feel hot and he wanted to let the tears out but why did they have to come
Draco hummed in response before he flicked Harry's cheek, "By the looks of things I gave as good as I got."
Draco stared down at him as if he was confused by the proposal. Soon, however, his expression softened a little and his shoulders slumped in resignation before a dry little smile slid over his mouth. "I suppose if you think it would help me. I mean, you've been right so far haven't you?" he murmured.
Things cooled down for at least another week as the Second Task loomed ever closer. Potter had been spending a lot of nights in the library, sometimes with his reunited entourage and sometimes on his own and staying there long after Madam Pince had retired to bed. Draco convinced himself that he didn't think it was slightly somewhat adorable how Potter constantly yanked at his hair and grunted before dropping his scarred head onto the thick tomes in front of him.
have gotten it sooner. I'm going to stay with my parents and I don't know if I'll want to see you after the six months are up. I have a lot to think through and a lot to sort out. My things have already been sent for and that," he nodded his head towards an envelope in his bedside table, "is for you. You are not to open until you go home and are alone."
"Draco," she stated, her dark eyes challenging Ginny to say something about it. Harry had to bite his tongue to keep from laughing; he could tell that Ginny was desperate to sneer about the whole thing and how Malfoy deserved it. He'd heard the speech enough times in various tones, as had Hermione. "It's utterly ridiculous! He wasn't the only one here that day. I'm not saying people should be nice to him but just leave him alone if they're going to be ignorant about it all."
Draco gave a wry little smile, his first in ages it would seem, "Maybe I wanted to see if staying here could make me feel the magic again. But there doesn't seem to be any hope for me in the regard. Not sure I even know what happiness or merriment is anymore. Or if I ever did in the first place."
Thankfully, that was a niche that Draco could excel in even in his sleep; six months before they had opened for business they had held a function in a nearby hotel to show their potential business partners that they were serious. It didn't take all that long to convince them to continue signing on and delivering their stock and trades to their apothecary. Draco had even managed to get a couple new accounts for private buyers, which would allow their prestige to grow at a rapid rate. And it had. Harry couldn't thank Draco enough for that.
' tucked under his blankets to find some really cheesy chat-up lines to use on Malfoy the next moment he got the blonde alone.
The blonde man slipped his hand over Harry's and squeezed, "Oh, I know." He drew in a deep breath and flexed his shoulder muscles, "So are you going in tomorrow?" he asked quietly.
"Oh? So ... What did you have in mind?" Harry asked. He really had no idea what the blonde man was thinking. Despite the orgasms, his opinion on the sex itself could be completely negative.
Draco didn't loosen his grip on Harry's arm, if anything he tightened it. His face was serious if a little tired. He shook his head firmly, "I don't want you to go anywhere."
The grandfather clock down the hall chimed loudly through the empty rooms and Draco winced that now he would have to leave. He really didn't want to leave the place that he watched his father work on important cases and meetings whilst he'd sat in the overly stuffed chairs by the fireplace and played with a model train. Blinking black the tears that he refused to shed more of since the funeral, he turned his back on the room and closed the door behind him. He leaned back against the door, grasping the head of his father's cane in his hand, before forcing his legs to march him out of the Manor and into the grizzly damp Parisian day. He stepped up into the coach, tugging the collar of his travelling cloak tighter around him, before sitting back against the seats and resting his cane beside his leg, the silver snakes head gleaming in the overcast light.
Draco let his anger slip away, knowing nothing could be done now about his father. Besides, deep down, he knew his father belonged in Azkaban. “Of course I still agree to teach you. I simply wanted to know why; I think I’m entitled to that, at least.”
Severus sat down on the corner of the bed and leaned towards Harry, resting his hand gently on the boy’s leg. “What’s wrong, Harry? You had a high dose of Dreamless Sleep, you couldn’t possibly have had a nightmare,” Severus said quietly. He felt Harry tremble even more violently and started to rub the teen’s leg in a comforting gesture.
“Harry’s Legilimency skills are quite good, actually. He’s a natural at it, he has no boundaries. I would not have him do this if there were any other options, Remus. The only memory I have seen that qualifies for this spell has been removed and is currently being stored in a memory vial. Harry is the only other person who fits the requirements. Do you think that I haven’t considered the risks, that I
“As well as you having to deal with me and my attitude. I really am sorry, Harry. I’ve been such an arse lately, and it sounds like you really could have used another friend through all of this. I’m glad to hear that Remus is back. He’s alright, right?”
“We’ll wait until tomorrow since it is so late already. I daresay you’ll be having the dream again.”
Remus had taken on the task of looking through Severus’ most personal belongings; things that required passwords because they were warded. So far none of them had had any luck, but Remus thought Harry might be on to something. He was glad that the rest of the room went back to their own business when Harry moved close to him, making it clear this wasn’t a public discussion now.
Severus and Remus exchanged an identical look of horrified realization. “He must have a Memory curse on him,” Severus said as he extracted himself from his bed and pulled his dressing gown over the sleep shorts he was wearing.
Harry stood there, slightly confused and just a little suspicious before shrugging it off. He didn’t know why he was being so paranoid, and it was starting to irk him. He took a second to re-strengthen his Occlumency shields, just to make himself feel better.
“...Severus, please calm down, you will only distress the boy’s themselves if they see you in this state.”
“That is not what I wanted, Harry. I’m sorry to hear that. You will not miss another class this term unless mortally injured or extremely sick, do you understand?”
The bathroom tiles were cold as their bare feet travelled across, pausing every few steps while their owners became too impatient. With the flick of a wand, warm water began to flow from the shower head. The glass door of the shower began to steam up and become opaque. As the two men continued their stumbling trek across the bathroom, faint wet noises could be heard echoing off the tiles. Lips met and tongues slid together as hands explored and massaged, soothed and forgave. As they reached their destination, a single handprint was imprinted on the steamy glass, and that handprint was all Harry needed to see on his parents’ shower door fifteen minutes later to know it was probably a good idea to come back later.
,” Harry gasped out, tears still sliding down his cheeks even as he smiled at his new father. He took a deep breath and looked down at the framed certificate once more before looking back at Severus, feeling his heart doing somersaults in his chest.
Harry Potter. Severus looked over to see if Remus looked quite as thrown as he did, and felt his stomach drop as he saw the openly curious expression on his husband’s face. Obviously, they indeed did
“Seems like the buggers are getting awfully brave, just waltzing around in their black robes and carrying their masks around like some sort of talisman,” said Fred with a scowl.
“A bit, but not much,” Harry said quietly, not sure why he was talking about it with Tonks of all people. As down to earth as she was, Harry had become increasingly annoyed with her while she had been guarding him at the cottage. Maybe it had been a combination of feeling the prisoner and being baby sat that made him irritable in the first place, not Tonks herself.
“Call him whatever you feel comfortable calling him. I don’t think that it offends Professor Lupin that you don’t call him ‘Dad’. You might want to discuss it with him, Harry. Maybe he prefers for you to just call him Remus,” Hermione said, matter of fact as she flipped through her Transfiguration book for the sixth time that lunch period.
Aurora checked her watch as it gave a short chime. Harry noticed that the face was not bedecked in numbers, but lunar phases. He saw Remus’ interest pique as well. “Sorry to cut this short, gentlemen, but I’ve got to go pick up the new telescopes I ordered. Pamphlet said they can see past Pluto; we’ll see about that.”
“All of your life you have been afraid to die, but really, you’ve never actually lived. How’s that for irony?”
“I’ve no idea what he was teaching the boy, Minerva. Harry’s been reluctant to part with any details, but I know it was important.”
succeed in finishing You-Know-Who. I worry every day that I’m going to get news that one of them has been killed! I worry about you being in the middle of it all and having this pressure on you of being The Chosen One. I play Quidditch not as a carefree past time, but as a distraction from all the shite going on with the war. I know there are things more important than Quidditch, trust me I do, but I thought that you could use the distraction as well. I don’t know what’s happened to you, Harry. You spend half a summer with Snape and Malfoy, and suddenly it seems like you’ve forgotten who your real friends are. You fight with Ron and push him away, you make Hermione take your side and push Ron away from her as well, you hardly even talk to me or look at me, your grades are slipping because you’re always with Malfoy in the hospital wing, and you’re constantly hidden away with Snape doing Merlin knows what! I don’t know who you are, but you’re certainly not the Harry I used to love.” Her anger had turned to tears as she finished her speech, turning away from Harry and running from the small crowd that had began to gather.
Briggs curled up into a ball with an ear splitting shriek and fell to the floor, writhing as he screamed in agony. Harry let this go on for nearly ten minutes before lifting the spell with a flick of his wand. He gave the man a few seconds to gather himself so that he could kneel once more, taking pity on him so that he could at least die a dignified death on his knees before his Lord instead of a crumpled mess on the floor. “
There was a long silence, broken by the scrapping of Harry’s empty tea cup being placed on the coffee table. “Please don’t call me that,” Harry whispered, gaining a very sad look from Molly and a blush from Arthur. He glanced at Snape and was surprised to find a reproving frown on the man’s face.
” Draco finally ripped himself out of his godfather’s grasp and ran from the room, leaving a shocked silence in his wake.
“You have no idea where he’s being detained, though,” Harry pointed out with a knowing look. His father seemed to be on edge, and that was not normal for him. Even when he was paranoid, he remained calm and collected.
It was a morning like any other in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. The secretaries were dictating to their quills as the filing assistants delivered and picked up files from the various cubicles of the Auror Department. Paper plane memos flew overhead as the sound of quills against parchment, light conversation and quiet laughter was heard. Everything was going quite smoothly, and nothing was out of the ordinary.
“Ah, Tom Riddle. It has not been long enough since last we spoke. As reminiscent an old man as I am, I am here for much different reasons,” Albus responded quietly. As off-putting and worrisome as the situation was, Dumbledore could not let the Dark Lord see his weakness.
“I have been doing some very heavy, thorough research about protective wards ever since the attack on your aunt and uncle’s house. You’ve been placed with Professor Snape as an extra precaution, yes, but we must take into account your safety once the school year is over once more. I came across some very ancient, almost forgotten wards in an old tome I found in Ireland.”
Harry sighed heavily as Draco unwittingly did the same as Remus had done to Severus and grabbed Harry’s hand under the table. He really did not want to discuss this with a room full of people, but if it helped them possibly discover another Horcrux, then he would swallow his fear and do it.
“You would give up everything, Draco, to fulfil some youthful fantasy and run off with a half-blood who’s marked for death by the Dark Lord? The Manor, the vaults, the heirlooms, the name, and
“We will be. Like we planned before; if we’re not back in an hour, go back to Headquarters and inform Kingsley of where we went, alright?”
“It’s not like he has any hair,” Harry pointed out quite seriously. There was a second of silence before both him and Remus burst out laughing, clutching onto each other as the stress and worry all momentarily melted away into fits of giggles.
“What’s this, Hermione?” Ron asked as he pointed to a column in the diagram labelled ‘Wool’s Orphanage – blanket(?)’
“Simply that you help guide Harry through these tough times, and that you’ll always be there for him when he is in need. Something else I might suggest is giving him a sense of stability while protecting him. How would you feel about allowing Harry to live in your quarters here at the school with you? You can protect him better that way, and your relationship can grow stronger with constant contact. What Harry needs is a father, Severus, and you can be that for him.”
“I wasn’t taunting her, Harry. Besides, she’s the one who blushed like a pathetic thirteen-year-old virgin, not me. I was just being nice,” Draco insisted, scowling when Harry smacked him on the arm.
have to do this! Are you out of your mind? Harry is not nearly skilled enough to pull something like this off! He’ll lose his mind!” Remus hissed in a sharp whisper, not wanting to garner Madam Pince’s attention by shouting like he so wanted to.
“Harry, I loved Sirius with every fibre of my being, but he’s gone now, and focusing on his loss will do me nothing but harm. In order for me to come to terms with it, I need to distance myself from him, if only until I can handle it better. I need to move on, Harry, and clinging to this cloak will prevent me from just that. If you want to think in terms of keeping it for me until I am better adjusted, then that’s fine. Save it, and I will ask for it when the time is right,” Remus said as he laid the heavy cloak over Harry’s knees.
Lucius turned halfway and sent a Killing curse at Avery, who was too slow to block it through his laughter, and fell to the dry earth with a dull
He smiled at the Gryffindor Head of House and blushed slightly as the other Prefects caught on to the hidden meaning by checking their own lists. Hermione giggled while Ron groaned.
“Harry...You have not caused a single death. You carry a burden that is not yours, and nothing I have done so far has been enough to convince you of that. The deaths that have happened around you are the fault of those who caused them. The Dark Lord killed your parents, Dumbledore and Cedric, Bellatrix killed Black, and various Death Eaters killed the Dursleys. Not one of them died from your hand. The people who have died for you knew what they were doing, understood the risks – even the Dursleys. I would die for you in less than a heartbeat, even if it was just so that you could live a day longer. You are not alone.
Lucius stood, shocked that his son was indeed completely serious about his relationship with The-Boy-Who-Lived. If it was so important that his son would give up literally
Severus spun around and dropped down to lift Draco up in his arms. Without a moment’s hesitation, he spun and Apparated them both straight into St. Mungo’s emergency room. “I need a Healer!” Severus shouted to no one in particular.
Draco stretched his legs out a bit and ran a hand through his now clean, white blonde locks. “Well, because Sev has always been more academic, not athletic. He focused on his studies in school; how else do you think he became a Potions Master?”
Poppy leaned over and propped up Harry’s pillows, nodding at Snape to help the boy sit up properly. “You’ve not been taking proper care of yourself, Mr. Potter. You passed out from exhaustion. How much sleep do you get a night?” she questioned, not yet giving the boy the sleeping potion.
Harry felt the tension in his chest unravel a little, though he would not allow himself to become excited. There was no guarantee these books would be helpful at all, but it was more than they had been able to come up with so far, and allowing a little bit of hope to seep through the dark disappointment was ok. “Thank you, sir. I really do appreciate you taking such a risk.”
“Actually, I wanted to go up to the Astronomy tower. I know we’re not allowed out of the castle now, but that’s technically still part of the castle, and I could use some fresh air.”
him; end of story. Your father is just worried about you, especially after losing your mum and hearing what happened to you afterwards. He may be a right bastard sometimes, but he does seem like a fairly decent father.
Draco shivered in his godfather’s embrace, his snivelling slowing down only slightly. “He tried to take away some of the memories I got back...I pushed him out, though, so he couldn’t see them anymore. I thought you said he was trying to help me, Sev...” Draco whined, sounding petulant and making Severus’ skin crawl. Then again, Draco had reverted to the age of eight in his amnesic state.
Severus made a disgusted noise as he avoided the stares of the teens and stalked back down the hallway, slamming the door to his bedroom closed behind him. He was in a right state, and he did not need to be around his son while this riled up, lest he say something stupid that he’d deeply regret once he had his proper wits about him.
“I had a conversation with a colleague regarding dreams and the best way to view someone else’s. He explained that viewing somebody else’s dream in a pensieve is not the best way because perceptions can actually change details and warp the original dream. The Dream Orb will record the dream as it is originally seen. That’s why it can only be viewed three times before it will fade, because outside perceptions can change dreams.”
Snape, and it made Harry feel a bit ill at ease. That last sentence alone was proof enough that, whoever this savior was, there was no way in Merlin’s name it was Severus Snape.
Harry glared at the Slytherin as he pulled his hands away from his temples. “Yeah, I think I’ve realized that much, thanks. How do I do it without concentrating so damn much, then? What am I doing wrong here?” he asked frustratedly as he took up pacing in the cramped sitting room once more.
Minerva shared a look with Hestia before she turned her attention back to the imposter. “Why did Voldemort have you impersonate Dumbledore, but not kill him?”
“It’s about bloody time, too. I wonder who will take Fudge’s place, though,” Ron said, waving a fork full of eggs around and almost spattering Hermione’s Potions book with yolk. She glared at him.
hand to be the one that slays him. I won’t have you directing my arm like a puppet master, aiming for me when it’s time to make the kill. This is
“Well, we could make the night better for you, at least. Dobby!” Harry called, grinning as the elf popped in with a large cake shaped like a cauldron. The little elf placed it gently on the coffee table and gave a low bow before disappearing once again.
“She’s dating Charlie, Harry. What if she tells Charlie and he tells Mum? She’ll kill me, Harry. She’ll kill me, bring me back to life, and then kill me again! I know she wants grandkids, but not while I’m barely of age!”
“And what did Weasley say to warrant a fat lip?” Severus asked curiously. Although he knew Ron and Draco would never be the best of friends, he had thought the boys were getting along amazingly well, of course for Harry’s sake. He knew whatever the redhead had said must have been pretty bad for Draco to haul off and actually hit him.
How strange it was, to feel this protective of a boy he had not so long ago loathed with a burning passion. Sure, he had Vowed to protect Harry long ago, before he had even met the boy, but that never meant he felt any sort of compassion for the wayward Gryffindor in the least. Only recently, after reflecting on everything the poor teen had been through in his short sixteen years, did Severus begin to develop and harbour a soft spot for him, if only a bit grudgingly. It was by a series of unfortunate events that he’d ended up being the one to rush to Harry’s aid, but he did so willing – not just because of the Vow, but because he didn’t have any desire to see the boy dead. Disliking someone and wishing them dead were two completely different things, and Severus knew this all too well, what with his ability to see the worst in people.
Harry sighed heavily and agitatedly swiped Draco’s hand away from his hair, sitting up and brushing his fringe back over his scar as usual. “I can’t relax, Draco. Dumbledore is dead, and now I have to find the Horcruxes alone. What the hell am I supposed to do? He never told me everything; I still don’t know exactly what I’m looking for. Hell, I don’t even know if he managed to destroy the one he went after the night he died!”
“Nervous?” Draco asked as he rubbed Harry’s arms, feeling his own heart flutter with nerves. He had wanted to go into the shop with Harry as well, but they had all agreed a group of three people would just be too suspicious. As it was, Harry and Remus were going to enter Borgin and Burkes at separate times so that it looked as though they weren’t associated at all. Draco didn’t like it, but he accepted it.
Draco rolled his eyes and he preceded his godfather into the sitting room, where he immediately spotted Potter reading a Quidditch magazine with his legs curled up comfortably on the couch. “Don’t underestimate his ability to be a prat, Sev.”
Severus rubbed a hand over his eyes before fixing his gaze on a shocked Harry. “As much as James and I despised each other in school, I am not above admitting that a lot of what your father and Black did to me during our Hogwarts yeas was definitely provoked by me. Later on, after Graduation, James turned into a different person; a responsible man, extremely passionate about fighting for what he believed in. Loathe I am to admit it, Harry, you’re father was a good person.”
“I did not trust Lucius at all, and was very much against all of it at first. I fought it, hard, but Lucius started telling us about these crazy plans that Voldemort had come up with to essentially round up all the muggle-borns and use a potion to strip them of their magical abilities and use them as an Imperioused army.”
A full minute passed before Kingsley stepped out of the hidden room behind the bookshelf. He pointed his wand at the decoy version of himself, his receptionist Laurel, and removed the Imperius curse and glamour. “I’m sorry about that, Laurel.”
Harry bit his lip as he too gazed at the closed bedroom door, still feeling like he had caused all the trouble, no matter what Remus told him. “He really pissed you off, didn’t he?” Harry asked quietly. Remus was usually a very mild mannered person, but the way he was talking now spoke of boiling anger.
and perused the front article. He closed the paper and looked around at Draco and Harry’s stunned expressions before realizing what he had said.
“The curse that was killing Dumbledore was placed on a family heirloom belonging to the Gaunt family, passed down many generations. It was a black stone set in a goblin made ring. It was the Resurrection stone all along. The Elder wand had ended up in the hands of Grindelwald, and when Dumbledore defeated him, he became Master of it. He’d had it all these years.”
“Men...” Harry said with a cheeky grin as he looked pointedly at how close the Potions and Defence Professors were standing. He chuckled as he side-stepped Severus’ attempt to cuff him on the back of the head.
Severus helped his son to stand up and made sure the boy could stand steady on his feet. Unnoticed by the parent-teen trio, Ron had run up to Harry’s room and collected the invisibility cloak for him, holding it out with a sympathetic look.
Harry tried to resist as Draco pulled him back into his quarters, though he didn’t fight very hard. “I can’t miss anymore classes, Draco; my dad will have a fit.”
“I do not think it’s necessary for either of you to know, or why it holds any importance in your minds, but fine. Draco, you remember your Healer, Abigail Smithson?”
As he entered the kitchen for an early breakfast, Severus reflected on what had happened the night before when he had walked in on a conversation about himself between Draco and Harry. He had been in a foul mood already due to his aching ribs and being admonished by Harry because of it. Hearing the Gryffindor speak as though he understood Severus’ emotionless demeanour had sent him over the edge. He’d lost his temper with Harry, but even now he could not bring himself to feel guilty for what he said. He had been honest, and that’s something he’d never feel guilty for, no matter how it affected others.
“When?” Sirius asked, meeting Harry’s eyes. The young man looked tired, and Sirius hoped he’d be able to get some rest before facing off with Voldemort once and for all.
“Thanks, Abigail,” Severus said, pretending to read the forms as he waited for the Healer’s reaction to his remembering her. He looked up after quickly signing both sheets and found the Healer smirking at him, her eyes sparkling even in the dim light of the ward.
wait until morning. He had to know for sure if his subconscious was planting disturbing nightmares from fiction, or if he had just regained the most horrible memory of his life. If anyone would know, his godfather would be the one to ask.
Severus rolled his eyes as he crossed his arms over his chest. “Why yes, Lupin, you can break into my home and completely ignore me to get to the boy, of course.”
Harry of course received a book from Hermione about the history of Defensive Magic, which was actually quite interesting as Harry flipped quickly through it. A gift that had him nearly in tears, though, was the collective gift from the Weasley family.
There were many murmurs of agreement as the Order began to whisper amongst themselves, some of them apparently unaware of this detail. All eyes were trained on Lucius once more, and his irritation was starting to show.
Harry had been unable to go back to sleep the last time he had the dream, and after experiencing such a vivid version of it, he was almost sure he wouldn’t be able to get back to sleep. “I can try...”
Harry blushed lightly and tried to ignore the stares, feeling anger rise in him at Ron’s words. “Don’t call him that, Ron! I’m staying down there because I’m better protected with Snape so close. He’s also teaching me Occlumency again. This was the most ideal way to do things – “
Draco immediately felt his cheeks flush pink. He was getting far too hot despite the Entrance Hall almost being completely deserted at this point. He straightened up a little more and looked down at Harry, "Er well I don't know -Would you want it to be a date?"
"Er ... yeah?" she asked nervously, self conscious that the blonde man had heard what she'd been discussing with Blaise. She needed to watch herself. They were too close to accomplishing their scheme, so they didn't need anything disrupting them.
Draco bowed his head. He had been thinking along the same lines but he couldn't deny just how nervous he was to make such a blatant attempt of 'inter-house-unity' in front of the entire school. He'd be the topic of idol gossip again, and that didn't sit too well with him. However, he couldn't deny that the raven-haired boy needed someone to talk to, as he glanced over at the Gryffindor table, and it was clear his friends weren't paying much attention to him to care. They probably thought he hadn't slept well the night before. As true as that was, Draco also knew that he still wanted to talk and get things off his chest.
After the jerk-off session in the library, they'd started taking risks with actually touching one another. Sometimes it'd be a hand on the wrist, leaning a little too closer to sound off chat-up lines in a way that looked like they were hissing and spitting vile words to one another.
Guilt pinched lightly at Harry's heart as he drank in Draco's words, slightly muffled as they were through the fog in his mind. His throat felt tight and dry as he looked as the small meal Draco had prepared for the both of them and instantly he felt bad for taking on longer shifts as the hospital just so that he would be too busy to think about anything other than the matter at hand. He had been running himself ragged and he knew it. It was only when he saw Draco's angelic if slightly damp features that he felt that annoying pinch of his guilt in his chest. It twinged and would soon burn up throughout his chest by the end of the evening. He looked up at Draco and forced another tight little smile. "You honestly didn't have to go through all this trouble just for me," he managed to rasp out as his blonde companion poured him a goblet of smooth, light wine and he sipped at it. His throat instantly felt better. He winced inwardly as Draco pressed his lips against his hair and the warmth spread down through his temples.
Blinking through the blurriness of his own vision, Harry caught sight of Draco sitting by his knees with his hands in his lap and looking into the fire, the light catching in his washed out features and his cried-out eyes. They had both been through a war, two sides of the same coin, and in a way that made them closer than they could be with anyone else. There were things Draco could understand that no one, not even Ginny in her own acclaimed way, could understand. In a way that was a good thing; no one else needed to suffer in the same way they had done.
Harry shook his damp black hair, "No, I took the next week off. I want to spend some time with you for a little while. I have missed you and I want to be there for you. I know losing your father was difficult on you even though it was predated. It's never easy to watch someone you love … slip away from you."
Harry nodded his head. He hadn't been expecting a warm welcome. He didn't deserve even the thought of one, he knew that. But to hear Draco talk down to him like that made his blood run cold. He managed to get his tongue working, "I know nothing I can say or do is going to make anything better," he looked up and fixed Draco with what he hoped was a determined look, "I am going to, though. I'm going to get better. Severus is going to help me. I
With a sigh he hurried up to the dorms and grabbed his trainers before hurrying back out of Gryffindor Tower, the note burning a hole through his pocket as he made his way along the corridors. The castle was eerie at night, so quiet and empty. He froze as soon as he came face-to-face with the door to the Room of Requirement. He was scared of what lay on the other side of that door. What if it was another difficult duel that left him feeling invaded every which way? What he left feeling like shit and never wanting to see -or follow -the blonde again?
He sighed as he fumbled with his key in his lock and pushed his bedroom door open and stopped dead. He blinked in surprise, feeling as though his eyes were playing a trick on him. "What are you doing here?" he asked in surprise, his stomach dropping through his shoes.
"Didn't think of that," the blonde mused to himself before coming to his sense. "So, is there anything you've always wanted to do?"
As he clawed his way closer through the forest of weeds, Harry squinted and reached out for the limp pale hand that was floating aimlessly through the slimy black tendrils drifting lazily around them. Draco's mouth was still open; water would be leaking into his lungs slowly and filling him up. He'd soon bloat and be completely lost to Harry if he didn't get him out soon. He grabbed the flaying cloth of Draco's garments and shifted his dead weight off the sandy lakebed, a few pebbles rocking and clicking together as the lifeless man shifted a little higher, making it easier for Harry to wrap an arm around the blonde man's chest.
"Those were some of my memories from when I was younger! I wanted to draw a comparison for you! This is the first Christmas without Voldemort's, the first without danger around every corner! I just wanted to show you that it can get better and there's no better time to start then now!"
Lucius' cool admiration cut through and chilled Harry right to the bone. He didn't even blink as he sipped from his champagne flute and then inclined his head, "Well it would seem, Mister Potter that you have managed to keep my son chattering incessantly about your pig-headed nature. Alas, when he did inform me of the facts you laid down before him I must admit I was most impressed with the knowledge of someone so young."
"It's a mild variation of a cleansing potions; it's going to cleanse out any bacteria you might have in your lungs. It takes about three hours to complete its cycle and once it's done I can determine if it is a virus that's affecting you or something worse."
Harry looked up at Draco with a tired smile, "so what did Cass give you?" he asked softly, gesturing to the blue bag.
The blonde aristocrat didn't need telling twice. Even when he got a little resistance from Harry it didn't last for long before the moans elicited from the younger man excited him even further. Harry had even started to shift about and unfastened the clasps of Draco's waistcoat and tugged his shirt out of his pressed trousers. Draco felt Harry's teeth grazing his skin and his answering arousal pressing up against Harry's thigh. He craned his neck back and shivered as the balmy air licked his exposed skin from where Harry had lifted his shirt up around his chest.
Seeker was the happiest he had seen him in months as he nudged the door open with his foot and helped Harry hobble into the apartment, a weak, strained smile on his lips. The walk home had been pleasant, the smell of damp earth hung in the air but the usual chill after a storm had not been present. Harry bent slightly so as to stroke Seeker's ears whilst Draco turned and closed the door, sliding the bolt into place as he did so every night. He turned and smiled as Harry went to seat himself on the sofa, Seeker hopping up on the neighboring cushion to nuzzle his master's face and neck. He smiled as Harry ruffled the flanks of Seeker's sleek golden coat. He smiled. It had been a while since Seeker had jumped about so merrily.
"Ahh, that feels strange!" he croaked out as Harry smoothed his hands up the planes of the pale stomach and rocked his hips gently until he was fully sheathed.
The blonde's eyes flickered up and he pressed his lips into a thin line before answering. "Potter and I met up last night. He'd gotten some bad news."
Draco rolled his eyes at that one. He had to suppress a snicker or risk getting a confused look from Pansy.
Draco nodded his head, a little too eagerly. "I'll meet you there," he promised. There was a tense little moment, that ached inside both boys, that could have been easily broken with a gentle kiss. But with a curt nod from the blonde, the moment shattered around them, and they both resigned themselves to going back to their separate dorms.
Once they arrived back at the hotel, Draco told Harry to wait in the lobby. Harry obeyed wearily as Draco walked to the very end of the hallway, made a U-turn and descended a flight of stairs to the bar in the basement. The bar was a simple, manly area designed by Cass himself. There was oak paneling along the bottom of the wall, a deep maroon colour on the walls, a Poole table at one end and a large plasma T.V. at the other end. To the left of the T.V. was a built-in bar where Cass was serving a muggle some beer. He found what he was looking for in the corner by the heater; Seeker.
, and had been identified and described on 24 March and then sent to press. Harry had then informed Snape and together they had begun creating weak vaccination salves to rub of the chest. Initially it was to help stop the disease from getting worse, and in time reduce the risk of it. Naturally, they still worked on creating an all-time cure but for that particular summer the salves and later a mild potion helped many people literally breathe a little easier. Draco had been most impressed that he didn't get breathless as easily, not even from coming up the grand staircase to his bedchamber. He knew he had been right to trust in Harry's judgement.
"I already told you 'no' Mr. Malfoy" she hissed lethally, clutching her clipboard to her stomach. "He needs to be kept in for observation."
Harry felt a heat creep up his neck and he felt his stomach knot in some dread. "Of course Professor," he managed to choke out before draining his flute in one gulp to regain a little bit of confidence. He was escorted across the room to where a group of tall older men were standing together in crisp black dress robes and talking over their flutes. One of them, no doubt Draco's father by the look of the white-blonde hair and pinched expression, grasped a cane in his left hand with a silvery snake wrapped around the head of the walking appliance. Harry had a sneaking suspicion that the cane was more for show than for actually aid the older man.
Draco smiled at the dog snuggled up under a small blanket, presumably one of the children's, and a chew-toy resting beside his head. Turning to Cass, Draco gestured to his dog, "is it alright if I leave him down here for the night? He won't be a bother, I promise."
Harry hummed is consent as he shuffled off of the edge of the bed and fiddled with his jeans, until they fell to his ankles. He stepped out of them and swiped his toasted pyjamas off of the radiator and hastily dressed into them, before crawling back over the bed and shuffling underneath the thick duvet cover. Draco watched as Harry hummed in delight at the cocoon of warmth in which he was now wrapped in. He wiggled around, looking like a huge caterpillar. Draco could not contain his laughter at how adorable his lover looked. "You all snuggly, are you?" he quipped as he stirred the hot chocolate into the milk and water.
"Never, baby," Draco breathed as he run his hands down Harry's body, ignoring how thin his once athletic lover had gotten. He quickly removed his hoodie and tugged Harry's shirt off tossing both off of the side of the bed and proceeded to smooth his warm hands down Harry's body. He nuzzled Harry's throat as he felt cool fingertips touching his own body, his muscles quivering at the tenderness of the touch. Harry's ragged breathing made Draco desperate to kiss every inch of exposed skin on Harry's body. "So soft," he breathed as he fingered the waistband of Harry's boxers, having kicked his jeans off at some point whilst Draco had been sleeping.
Severus sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. "Harry, you cannot leave it too much longer to make a decision. Your health and your life are hanging in the balance here."
Draco nodded his head and edged into the room and settled himself on the edge of Harry's bed, his head bowed to the floor and his knobbly knees poking out from the hem of his nightshirt, "He does but I don't think he'll miss me right now," he murmured as he peered up through his fringe at Harry, "Besides, I don't plan on staying too long." His voice had a tight edge to it, as though it was taking all of his self-restraint to keeping his voice steady. "I just came here to ask you something."
Glancing over his shoulder as he circled back and retreated from the courtyard, he smirked even wider as he saw the dumbstruck look on Potter's face. He was almost out of ear shot when he heard a shocked, "What the Hell Malfoy?" with footsteps hurrying to catch up with him. Taking a sharp detour Draco managed to avoid Potter catching up with him. He watched from the alcove as he saw Potter turn left and right, looking for him and upon seeing no one, hissing out in frustration and actually stamping his foot!
Draco couldn't help it. He glanced down and sure enough, Potter was hard through his school trousers. The sight alone sent blood rushing to his own cock. "I don't need 'accio' to make you come."
Pansy scowled at the sarcasm, "Funny, Potter," her lips wanted to curl up into a sneer but she restrained herself. "I just wanted to know if you'd seen him?"
"Surely that just means that you're madder than I am?" the brunette man asked with a cocked eyebrow.
"AH!" he screamed out, his veins throbbing in his throat as he punched at his legs and chest and stomach. He wanted to feel something other than the crippling desire to curl into a ball and die there. "AHHHH!" he let out another scream, his entire body burning with shame, humiliation and overwhelming sensation that no one had cared enough to follow him.
Draco reached underneath his chair and pulled his satchel out and handed Harry the small wad of already opened letters. "I was reading a bunch of them on the train home. You know how that journey can be. I needed a distraction. It did remind me of that summer a year after it had happened –You'd looked like a changed man. Almost happy, almost at peace with yourself," he commented with a twinkle in his silver eyes.
"I thought you were to be riding with Father and me to the hotel tonight?" Draco asked, frowning a little and looking a little peaky. So much so that Harry was tempted to reach over and check his temperature.
Cass grinned down at the dog, bending to his knees to ruffle the golden flanks, "Oh, he is a beaut!" he straightened up, "So where are you boys' from?"
Grey eyes met green and two hearts hammered in separate chest. "I'm worried about you, Harry." There. He'd done it. He'd admitted at least the tip of his iceberg of worry. It was a pathetic excuse of all that he could have said but couldn't find the energy to say it. He clenched his fingers around the ends of the chairs arms. He dropped his gaze to the floor, not bearing to look into the eyes of the man who had all but vocally rejected him. "I don't think you should work for a while. I think you should stay home and relax for a little while, maybe run the shop with me. You have an assistant; they could take care of things for a couple of weeks or so."
"A puppy?" he had asked her incredulously, almost as though she had lost her mind. She was supposed to be the smart one out of the Golden trio.
"Perhaps," he conceded with a graceful smile, "But at the very least that means that the both of us can live out the rest of our lives together, being mad as one another?"
Nor had he expected to wake up to the piercing wail that alerted him to the arrival of emergency services from St. Mungo's.
Pansy shook her head, "I watched them for two hours this afternoon, and short of sending each other gooey stares when they think the other isn't looking is about as soppy as it got!" She stabbed at her chicken so roughly that her goblet teetered on the table and a few of the first years scooted further away in their seats. She sighed and threw her fork down on the table, "Are you
Draco nodded his head as he slipped a leather bookmark in between the pages and placed the book to one side. "What is it Severus? You seem quite agitated."
"Tyrant?" Lucius supplied with his usual dry chuckle, "Of course I am aware of the rumours and what they print in the papers. However, where my son is concerned I will do as much as I can to make sure he is comfortable. Even if it is for a short amount of time." He eyed Harry's obvious discomfort before sighing, "If you wish for me to convince Severus I don't mind taking on that task, but I would like you to agree first, otherwise there is no point for me to do so."
Harry licked his lips but stayed silent. He didn't know if he wanted to tell Draco what he had been thinking about lately. For the last year, in fact. He wasn't sure he wanted to tell anybody about it, but he knew that people were starting to notice how 'off' he had been in the last couple of weeks. He pulled at a frayed thread on his hoodie -having skipped all his lessons of the day, choosing to do some meditation instead -before sighing and tearing his eyes away from the horizon for a moment.
Draco nodded his head and couldn't help a small smile grace his lips as he fingered his glass and sipped at it, "Despite everything back then I kept them, mainly to track your progress and see how things were doing, what topics I should avoid until you were a little stronger and new and interesting things that I'd need or want to ask about at a later date."
Spitting into his palm, Draco wet his cock and adjusted himself between Harry's legs. He could feel his own legs aching from where he'd been kneeling on the stone floor, but he wasn't complaining. He was more focused on the tight, hot sensation slowly easing down around his throbbing cock as he gently pushed himself into his lover's sweating, quivering body. Their conjoined groans echoed out around the room as Draco slid into him. Harry's thighs were tense and throbbing under his palms as he fully sheathed himself. "Oh God!" he grunted out, as Harry clenched around him. He jerked and groaned as he grasped the brunettes thighs tightly.
As one, they stood up, plates in hands, and moved over towards the Gryffindor table. A wave of whispers followed them but they ignored the voices as they went to sit down on either side of the Gryffindor table. Despite the slight awkwardness, they squared their shoulders and continued to eat and started talking among themselves.
Their dog trotted back over, his favourite book clamped between its teeth. He felt his lips tug into a semblance of a smile before removing the tattered book from the dog's mouth, ruffling it behind the ears as he did so. Its collar jingled at the action; the golden nametag flashed the named 'Seeker' into his eyes. He smiled. Everyone thought that Seeker was named due to his and Harry's love for Quidditch -that had in fact not been the case. They had indeed spent weeks trying to pick a name that didn't sound outrageous or horrible -or horribly outrageous. They had taken two weeks of calling the pup a variety of names, most of which it did not even answer to. The way they had gotten the name for their puppy was indeed a strange story, but not many people believed him when he insisted that was the true story behind the name. Many thought it was due to a sex-game or another ludicrous tale like that.
He waited for the anger to cloud his mind over, but nothing happened. He waited and waited but the only thing that grew was the headache behind his eyes. Why couldn't he get angry about the whole thing? '
"Oh would you just shut up for one moment, Potter, and not be a total arsehole for once this year!" Draco sneered, suddenly not in the mood to be joked at. His fingers clutched his glass tighter as he sighed and dropped his head into his free hand. "Where have you been 'till this hour? It's far too late."
"There's always a reason to calm down, Harry," Draco assured in a controlled voice. He didn't loosen his grip on Harry as he shifted a little closer, his lower back aching from the position he was in. "Listen, if this is bothering you so much why haven't you spoken to anyone about it?"
Draco ignored the question, after having the discussion with Harry the previous night he wasn't up for discussing
"Here we go," Draco murmured to his lover as they stood up and waited for the tram to screech to a halt. Harry blinked through his sleepy eyes and stood to follow Draco off of the tram. The early evening air was so soothing on his suddenly flushed skin as they crossed over from the North Pier and started walking up the high street that led off of the promenade, past the city hall and a few large bank buildings. Draco made sure to walk slow so that Harry did not exert himself before the meal.
The wheels creaked and the coach jerked and then pulled to a stop. Opening his eyes with a soft sigh, Draco struggled out of the coach, paid the driver and then turned his attention to the darkened windows of the apothecary and the apartment over the top. After everything, he simply couldn't let the place go; all the memories good and bad were locked up in there. Plus, he'd gotten used to working about in the shop. Slughorn hadn't minded moving out, he'd found a better place a little closer to the hospital with more room for all of his belongings that had been in storage until he moved.
Harry looked up and smiled a watery smile at his boyfriend, extracting himself from the group hug so he could attack the Slytherin with a hug and a quick kiss, encouraging the blonde to put on the jumper.
Harry nodded, watching as his father ran a hand through his lank hair and leaned back heavily in his chair.  He felt the incessant need to apologize for just how tired his father was, but figured he would be rebuked for it. “So, who’s going to question Malfoy?”
Wormtail, who was slumped down in his seat waiting for the inevitable, suddenly perked up at Harry’s words. He leaned forward as far as the semi-slack chains would allow and extended his hand so that it slipped into Harry’s own, and gave a firm shake. A faint white light lit their joined hands before fading away. As soon as the spell took effect, Harry jerked his hand away and took a step back.
“Are you alright? I thought I heard shouting,” Remus said, his expression extremely concerned as he moved into the room and sat down on the edge of Harry’s bed. Upon closer inspection, the teen looked wretched, his eyes bloodshot and wide with fear, and his breath still much too quick for someone who had just been asleep.
“You told me in Hogsmeade that even if I couldn’t place a gift in my mother’s hands, I could still give her something. I thought the same was true for you, so I asked permission from Dumbledore, and got Professor Sprout’s help in planting this garden. The yellow ones are daffodils, part of the Narcissi genus, and the pink and white ones are Stargazer lilies, part of the Lilium genus.”
“I heard this information from behind a closed door; the Dark Lord was alone and does not know I overheard him talking to himself that night. Nagini was the only living creature with him at the time; I know because I was called in soon after by way of menacing hissing from the blasted snake as it curled around my legs. I don’t really understand what the information means, but it sounded important.”
“Stop it! Harry, it isn’t anyone’s fault. If they’d not decided to go to Diagon Alley, they could have met their end some other way that day. You being there did not kill anyone, so stop. You got
Lucius gave his son a searching look, but nodded his head in assent. “Very well, then. Do your worst.”
Draco grimaced at the idea of sitting on the floor of the loo and having a conversation with a perverted ghost, but he sat down across from her anyways, only because he was finally getting to the good part. “Did you know Tom Riddle, too?”
“What’s wrong?” Severus asked Remus and Draco, spotting a problem where Harry had not. He quickly pulled his wand out and let his eyes travel quickly around the Alley.
“Misdirect?” Harry asked, wondering if that was synonymous with lying. Lying under Veritaserum was impossible, however, hence the name ‘truth serum’.
Lucius Malfoy hardly looked like an escaped convict, except perhaps for some weight loss. His robes were still crisp and graceful, and his blonde hair – so like Draco’s that Harry shuddered – was shining and luscious as ever. His piercing gray eyes narrowed as Harry took a step back, but he didn’t make any moves towards him.
Severus sighed in relief, relaxing into the comforting hand that Remus’ was running up and down his back. His husband was a Godsend. “Thank you, Harry. I promise, you’ll not be going through it alone.”
As Remus rubbed Harry’s back, his eyes trailed over the collection of old Hogwarts text books that Severus had kept for some reason. Every single book from every subject the man had taken as a Hogwarts student was there, but he couldn’t figure out why.
“Hmm yes, just remember that when you’re having to push me around in a wheelchair in Hogwarts. It’s not exactly a wheelchair accessible school, now is it?”
Draco shrunk back down into his seat, his cheeks aflame in shame and embarrassment. His father still knew all too well how to hit him where it hurt. He was sure he’d never be able to shame people as expertly as his father could, though he wasn’t very sure if that was a talent he ever wanted to acquire.
Harry felt his stomach knot up in guilt at the obvious signs of Draco recently crying. He sighed and moved closer to the door, gently pushing on it until Draco allowed it to open all the way and let Harry in. He gathered the blonde into his arms and held him there, placing chaste kisses on his cheeks and brow. The Slytherin went slack in his arms and held tightly to his robes.
Severus sat forward and drew Peter’s attention away from Harry and onto himself. He took a deep breath and prepared himself to hear something he may not like. “Did the Dark Lord say specifically what he was going to sacrifice? Did he mention an object or a location, perhaps?”
“Draco wanted to apologize to you both, but he wanted to do it separately. But that’s a good thing, because I need your help with something,” Harry said quickly, his voice much quieter than he normally spoke.
“Sugar, cream, brandy?” Ms. Brooks asked as she poured two cups of tea, stirring quite a lot of cream and sugar into one.
“It’s a diversion. They’re trying to draw extra security to Diagon Alley in order to slacken security somewhere else. I mean, security in the Alley is already pretty tight after the two attacks that happened there, but I think they’re really trying to draw attention away from something else. They’re planning something big,” George said.
Harry gasped, leaving his lips parted slightly. Should he kiss back, or let Draco decide if this was what he really wanted? He knew getting too involved with the Slytherin in his current state could prove to be a damning mistake once his full memory returned, but he had been powerless to stop the rampaging feelings that they both shared for each other. The decision was taken out of his hands as Draco grasped the back of his head and pulled him closer, eliciting a soft moan from his throat as the kiss deepened.
“If Dumbledore has no qualms about it, I would love to move into your quarters, Severus. Now tell me how the interview went!” Remus insisted as he sat down on the sofa and pulled Severus down with him, grabbing for a cup of tea.
“When I was sixteen, my mother became ill. She was in hospital for most of the first half of my seventh year in Hogwarts, and when I returned home for Christmas hols, she got worse. I was in the hospital watching over her the entire time before she passed away just after Christmas...on my seventeenth birthday,” Severus explained, looking like his mind was in a far off place rather than the dungeons of Hogwarts.
Harry had only made it halfway into the Entrance Hall when he felt a hand grasp his shoulder. He expected it to be his father or Remus, and so was pleasantly surprised to see Draco peering at him over his shoulder.
“Soon, but we need to do a few test runs first. You were able to touch Harry, which means you’re more corporeal than a ghost would be. That’s a good thing, but the real test will be whether you can wield objects as well,” Severus explained, standing up and walking to a cabinet to pull out a tea cup. He then walked around the table and held it out to Sirius, gesturing for him to take it.
Harry began searching for anything that had a lion on it, around it, or as part of it. Most the creatures he had seen adorning anything in the shop were snakes of some sort, of course. He’d even seen a centaur and a griffin –
Harry jerked awake and straightened his glasses as he stood up. He moved towards Snape, who flinched at Harry’s quick movements. “It’s alright, Professor, it’s just me, Harry. You’re home now, you’re safe,” Harry said quietly as he moved closer to Snape.
“Took you bloody long enough,” Draco drawled as he opened his arms and allowed Harry to fall into his embrace. He stroked the messy hair away from Harry’s forehead and sighed. “I’m sorry.”
Harry sighed heavily, extremely glad his best friend was so bloody brilliant. “Yes; well – I think. We’re involved, at least. It’s kind of complicated, what with him not really knowing exactly who I am. He could remember at any time, though, and who’s to say he won’t suddenly hate me because of something he remembered?”
“What? Harry, you can’t be serious!” Draco gasped, his already pale skin tinged with grey as he swayed in the doorway. He had been worried sick about Harry, angry that he had not been allowed to go along as moral support. When they returned and Harry brushed him off, Draco had been stung, but now he understood why.
, Harry had felt as though he had damaged his relationship with Snape, and it would never be the same again. The guilt ate at his insides like a violent acid. Harry shuddered as his father fixed him with an intense look.
“I’m not sure if the orphanage is there anymore or not, but it’s worth some investigation, isn’t it? We’ve got no other leads, and this has a death associated with it that would be perfect for a Horcrux. Think about it; Tom Riddle despised his Muggle heritage, and the orphanage would only stand as a reminder to him. He’d want some sort of revenge, and I’m sure he was not fond of the Headmistress, as she was most likely not fond of him either,” said Hermione with a shrug.
Remus stood up too, sending some of Hermione’s notes cascading to the floor. He looked like he was ready to pull his wand, cueing Harry’s intervention.
sake. I tried to explain everything to him, especially about the adoption and the wards, but he just seems to think you’ve gone round the twist and turned to the Dark Side or something. I think, perhaps, that he’s just jealous and hurt. He thinks he’s lost his best friend.”
“This is where the speculation and guesswork comes in. The Dark Lord did not give me any details as to what his research had provided him, and the Order’s own research brought up a frightening possibility; with your blood running in the Dark Lord’s veins, your mother’s blood-sacrifice may be null and void. As soon as we discovered this, we worked to ward your home with spells instead of just letting the ancient magic your mother had placed there protect you alone. Apparently our efforts were in vain, for the Dark Lord’s followers were able to break through these to get to you. A sort of alarm notified the Order that the wards had been broken, however, and when the Death Eaters realized this, they fled without completing their mission. The force of their spells to break the wards was what caused the explosion to occur, and a massive one it was at that,” Severus said the last part a little quietly as he remembered the state he had found the house in when he first Apparated to Harry.
“Well obviously the Weasleys would be the best option. They already consider you a part of their family, and I know Molly would have adopted you straight away if Dumbledore had let her. They’ll have no problem adopting you and agreeing to the bonding.”
to him, Dad. I never got to apologize,” Harry choked out, finally letting the tears come. He was curled in on himself, but somehow in the next moment, he was in his father’s arms, crying into the shoulder of the man’s robes.
Harry felt slightly bemused by that comment, but nodded amiably as he pulled the covers closer to him. He had not realized that he was fighting the potion until he allowed his eyes to slam shut. It took Harry a little while to realize that that last comment from Snape must have been the man’s idea of humor. He let out a soft chuckle at the pathetic attempt just before his mind shut off completely and he was thrown into a deep, dreamless slumber.
Draco grimaced as he grudgingly followed his godfather into the kitchen. He guessed that this little chat would have something to do with Severus grilling him with questions about where he’d been for the last month. He vowed to himself to never talk about it and would gladly obliviate the memories completely if he could. As he sat down at the kitchen table across from Snape, he crossed his arms over his chest defensively.
Harry dropped his fork and scooted over to look at Hermione’s paper. The headline made his stomach drop and his cheeks burn in anger.
Harry flushed as he looked away from the Potions Master and nodded. He wouldn’t tell, he’d promised, he wouldn’t break Draco’s trust. “I can’t tell you though, Professor. I promised him, I even swore on my mother’s grave. It’s something he needs to tell you himself, I’m sorry.”
Severus easily slid a hand up to tangle in the fine hairs at the back of Remus’ neck, returning the pressure eagerly and, surprisingly, without any qualms this time. It felt good to just kiss Remus without feeling nervous or scared of what might happen afterwards. He had bravely set aside any room for uncertainty the night before. After what felt like days, Severus eventually pulled away, amused at the groan of protest from the werewolf. “Shower, Remus,” he said with a soft chuckle, only slightly aware of how close they still were to each other.
Draco’s eyes fluttered open, blinking blearily up at Harry, his eyebrows knit in confusion. “Harry? What’s wrong?”
“Remus...” Severus whispered, afraid to open the box, but beyond excited for what it could possibly mean.
“Severus! He’s responding,” Abigail exclaimed as she waved her wand slowly over Draco, his vitals increasing very slightly.
“You should have thought of that when you told dad he was insane for siding with Dumbledore about Voldemort’s return. You don’t deserve to say goodbye after what you put him through!” Fred snapped, his eyes blazing with anger. If it was one thing to see Fred or George in high rage, it was another to see them together, mad as hell.
Both Professor and student jumped violently as Dobby reappeared with a loud pop, bringing along their breakfast and setting it up on the coffee table. Severus took a deep breath to calm his pounding heart before attending to his own plate, nodding for Harry to do the same. After they had both eaten their fill, it was time to discuss the things they may be asked in the interview that would happen in just a few short hours.
Harry just grasped his boyfriend’s hand in his own as he closed his eyes against the nausea still plaguing him. He was shivering as the cold of the Dementor still shrouded him like an icy blanket. He opened his eyes as a vial of potion was pushed into his hand; a Calming Draught.
Remus smiled at his husband and pulled him into a quick kiss. “We just wanted to come assure you all that Severus is alive and well, but now he must be getting back to bed. He still needs plenty of rest to recuperate. Molly said to tell you lot that lunch will be ready in half an hour, and not to get too lost in your books and be an hour late…
Harry let out a strangled breath as he shook his head jerkily, signalling that he was definitely not alright. He couldn’t explain how grateful he was when Severus pulled him into his arms, holding him close to his warm, solid chest. Harry clutched at his father’s robes, struggling to keep his emotions intact.
Remus looked up from his tepid cup of tea, expecting to see Severus in the doorway. He had decided to make a cup of tea before seeking Harry out to calm his nerves, but when he went up to his son’s room, it was empty. Perhaps Harry needed some more alone time. Deciding he needed some of his own, Remus had retired to the drawing room, sipping at his tea and staring into the fire, trying to figure out just what he was going to say to Harry.
The matron nodded quickly as she motioned for Severus to enter the main ward and lay Draco on one of the stark white beds, Harry coming up to the side of the bed to grasp Draco’s limp hand. As they waited for the Healer to come through, Draco began to twitch and squirm, and Severus knew what was coming next.
He opened the window of his study and leaned out, whistling into the darkness. It took a few minutes, but a large eagle owl came flying out of the forest which lay beyond the Manor and flew to window, landing heavily on his outstretched arm. He attached the letter and whispered to the owl, “Take this to my son.”
Harry knew his father was trying to make him feel better, but he wasn’t sure it was working all that well. “I think it shows more how much my mum loved me, and how strong her protection was. I would’ve died the night she and my dad did if it weren’t for her sacrifice. That’s what I think about every time I have a birthday.”
“You say that like it’s a bad thing, Ms. Granger.” Unawares to the students crowding around the feuding trio, Severus had walked up on the argument, having heard Hermione’s yelling from down the hall.
Without Remus there to stop him, Harry lunged out of his bed and ran to his father’s side with a sigh of relief. He was shaking with emotion; he’d been afraid to ask about Severus’ fate, as he wasn’t sure he would be able to handle the answer he received. “Dad! Thank Merlin. I saw you get hit by that spell and I couldn’t do anything, I just blacked out. I was so scared; I thought you were – ”
Harry stopped walking abruptly, making Snape walk right into him, as he’d been looking the other direction at Remus. “I have escorts
Harry shifted uncomfortably amongst the broken china and spilt tea. He pulled out his wand and cleared away the mess, trying to distract himself from the situation.
“I will help Lucius with the spying group should he need it, but I had another group in mind, Headmistress,” the Potions Master said. “I would like to head a group on Defensive and Offensive training. Not everyone here has gone through Auror training; there are those who are ill-equipped to fight, and that is the most dangerous thing Albus always seemed to overlook.”
“We’ll have to get everyone’s input on the matter, of course, but I think the Order would be much better organized if people were assigned a set task. Now, what will we need?” Minerva asked as a couple of Order members began to trickle into the kitchen and take seats around the table.
Harry took a moment to think before holding up seven fingers to count them off. “Interrupted concentration, relapse of memory, foreign emotions, lack of blinking, sense of foreboding, quickly shifting thoughts, and strain on your powers.”
Remus gasped, quickly pulling away so that he could look Severus full in the face. He didn’t detect any jest or reluctance, nor had he seen such an open display of emotion on the Potions Master’s face before. A smile spread slowly across his face as he leaned forward and kissed his lover once more, trying to keep his emotions under control.
was a very large, very old book found in the restricted section of Hogwarts’ library. With a Point-Me spell, the tome was found quite easily amongst all of the other questionable and possibly dangerous books. The pages had been recently cleared of dust; evidence of Hermione’s research. It was one of the milder restricted books, but in the wrong hands, it was a very useful weapon.
Dinner was pretty quiet for the start of the new term, but at the Gryffindor table, whispers were being sent down the table along with strange glances and covert giggles. Harry was getting highly annoyed as a group of fifth year girls started pointing at him, whispering to each other and sending him awed looks. Hermione slammed her fork down and glared at the girls, who stopped pointing at once.
“Yes sirs, of course! Dobby will bring Master Harry some onion and cheese soup like Master Professor Snape likes when he is sick.”
“Well, there’s been very little research done on Dementors because of the affect they have on people. The only thorough research I’ve seen was done by a vampire by the name of Claudius Bofinkle. A vampire’s soul can only be captured by its reflection in a mirror, essentially trapping it. Dementors do not affect vampires.  There are very few non-humans that cannot feel the despair caused by Dementors. Lethifolds are another example, but their lack of ability to communicate renders them unable to do something like research,” Remus answered, not sure if Hermione had intended to ask him or Severus, as they were both ‘Professor’.
“You’re welcome, Professor. Hermione, Draco and I had quite a lot of fun picking them out for you,” Harry said with a soft chuckle. They had spent nearly three hours picking out the most intriguing magical socks of all varieties. Some of them would scream horribly loud when they needed a wash, and there was a pair that would change colours with your mood. Harry’s favourite pair by far were the ones that warmed your feet when they sensed you were a little chilly. He had bought a pair for himself as well.
“Maybe he was, Harry. Maybe his instincts were telling him that, despite Professor Dumbledore’s declining wits, it was important to follow his orders anyways. I don’t understand most any of it, so I’ll not comment any further, but I don’t think you need to worry about the rift between Remus and Sev being anything more than a lover’s spat. They’re both much too passionate to let one fight get the best of their relationship,” Draco said with a shrug. He placed a chaste kiss on Harry’s lips, relaxing when the Gryffindor responded passionately, melting in his arms.
At this point even Draco had to admit that maybe those pick-up lines were working after all. He couldn't control his satisfied smirk as he watched Potter dash out of the classroom, when the bell went, as fast as he could. Draco had the same problem but he was able to wait until he got down to the privacy of his own bed before taking his dick out and jerking himself off.
"Have you been to one of his lectures in Calais before?" Harry asked as he drained the rest of his champagne and then set it back behind him on the bar.
Another squeeze to his wrist drew his eyes up to meet Draco's own. "Sometimes you need to confront your fears. Do you know how scared I was seeing your dead body their in Hagrid's arms, thinking that
be fine Italian silk –and ease his breathing before clutching the over-stuffed pillow in his hands. He could take the two steps to the bed and gently ease the pillow over Draco's face, so gently so as not to start him awake too soon. He could wait and enjoy the sensation of playing God –of having a life in the palm of his hand –and relish in it. Then, ever so slowly, he could apply pressure to the pillow, his hands sinking into its softness, and feel Draco's bone structure through the feathers. Draco would realise his air was seriously lacking and start to struggled when he realised the pressure of Harry sitting on his chest, but that was to be expected. Harry could envision the flailing limps, the muffled cries and the short, rapid breathing until finally, everything could become still and silent and frightening.
Draco dipped his head up and down between Harry's legs over and over, taking his lover in as deep as he could without gagging too much. He squeezed Harry's buttocks as he sucked on his head and made the younger man moan and arch into his touch. As much as he didn't mind letting Harry lead on rare occasions, he still needed to have a little control to savour. He felt himself growing harder at the mere thought of what Harry had yet to do to him.
