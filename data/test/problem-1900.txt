“I’ll wait,” he assures her, stepping back against a shelf full of advent calendars.
He pulls out the jar of blackcurrant jam, tips half of it into a bowl and mixes in the dose of Pepper-Up with a spoon. Now all he needs to do is get all of it into Hugo before Hermione wakes up and demands to know why he is shovelling refined sugar into her child. He’s pretty sure she’ll thank him when Hugo stops oozing and screaming.
“It’s not
Harry and Draco are standing among the long grasses in a pool of moonlight, tangled together and kissing desperately. It’s not a first-time sort of kiss, either, all messy and slightly off-balance. It’s a different sort of desperation—slow and intense and full of promise. Harry’s hands are threaded through Draco’s hair and Draco pulls him in tight, fingers slipping under the hem of Harry’s t-shirt and onto his skin. Around them, the vivid sea green and the fierce scarlet are burning, crackling and roaring around them, merging over their heads in a burst of fiery bronze that steals Luna’s breath. Her fingers press into the rough tree bark as she tries to decide whether to dance with delight or run away and ends up doing neither.
“I think he’ll like it,” Rose says. “I’d still like to measure him first.”
“No.”
“Vaguely,” Harry says, piling on the sarcasm. “What about him?”
“Thank you, this is brilliant,” he says, pulling the jumper over his head and turning this way and that to allow everyone to view it properly.
“What are you doing?” he mutters to himself when Potter storms out of the shop and immediately storms back in.
“Thanks,” he manages, almost forgetting why he’s here as he admires Eilish’s spellwork. His clothes are bone dry, including his coat, his cuffs, and the bottoms of his jeans.
“Maybe you’re cross because you work too much,” Harry says, pulling out the photograph of the Scottish landscape and gazing at it.
**~*~**
“What?”
“Ah, yes, so it has,” Harry says, picking it up by the string and letting it twirl around. “Thanks very much, all of you.”
“Oh, that’s what the two of you were doing in there,” George laughs, and everyone within earshot laughs, too, grinning at Harry and Draco until Harry thinks he might implode with embarrassment.
“Hang on, how is it you know about Sherlock Holmes but you haven’t heard of Shakespeare?”
Draco attempts to ignore the warm flutter in his stomach set off by the careless display and instead presses his palm to the side of Harry’s face, relishing the way he closes his eyes and leans into the touch.
“Was it really a whole pound?” he asks Ginny. “I’m not criticising, I’m impressed.”
“I’m in,” Deb says. “I’ve always fancied causing a bit of a scene in Diagon Alley.”
The others laugh warmly and Luna looks around at them, delighted but bewildered.
Startled at how easily this is all coming together, Harry pokes his head into the Burrow’s kitchen, where he finds Molly making pastry and Arthur poking at something rusty and mechanical with a screwdriver.
“You’re lucky you have a sharp mind, Miss Lovegood. If you hadn’t, you would surely have blown yourself up by now, given that you don’t seem to listen to a word I say.”
“Yes, it’s ugly,” Corrie mumbles, and Harry snorts.
She opens the tightly-sprung letterbox and shouts through it, doing her best to avoid having her fingertips sliced off.
George grabs her hand in solidarity and then winces as she grips it hard.
“Why not?”
Harry frowns. “What do you mean by that?”
“My son sells houses,” Ida says, and then frowns. “At least, he did.”
Draco seems disinclined to say any more, and Harry is no longer in the mood to push him. Instead, he looks around at the glittering trees, the Sunday morning dog walkers and the colourful lights strung between each old fashioned lamp post. The sky is clear and the pale sun shimmering over everything seems to make the air taste pure and sweet. The wind slices through Harry’s hair and clothes and brings with it a warm, festive smell that is instantly recognisable.
“It’s a lovely tree,” the woman says, fingers still holding onto her intaglio pendant for dear life.
Mr Abernathy regards her for a moment with bright, intelligent eyes and then mumbles the corner of Harry’s page with his beak. Luna laughs and nudges him away. She leafs through the pages, turning almost all the way to the front of the book, where her plans are laid out in bold strokes of purple ink.
Needle shifts over a fraction of an inch and Harry gives in. He’s exhausted and he can’t think of anything better than climbing into this bed with Draco and sleeping until the morning. Yawning, he strips off his dirty clothes and crawls under the soft quilt, wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist as he lets his head sink onto the pillow. Needle settles himself at their feet. Draco doesn’t stir.
“Really?” Draco asks, recalling scarlet eyebrows and hospital rooms and all that came before this. Them. Everything.
Face heating with shame, Harry pauses to take a deep breath and thank anyone who might be listening that Hermione had not decided to send a Howler.
, he reads.
“Stop it, I’m starving,” Ron groans, and Hermione stares at him.
Harry snorts and the look dissolves. “I won’t. I promise.”
“I know,” she says guiltily. “I’m daydreaming about daydreaming. That can’t be good.”
“Thank you,” Harry says, stomach grumbling loudly. He looks at the drawn curtains and frowns. “What time is it?”
“But you are happy,” she says, biting into a piece of currywurst.
When he walks into the studio on Monday morning and Pansy is already there, he can’t decide if it is a good sign or just an unsettling one.
**~*~**
“Little?”
Luna signs the letter with a flourish and slips it into an envelope, ready for posting.
“So… Shan and Esmee are in their shop serving customers, as are Mr Pike, Jean, and, Felicity from the flower shop,” Draco says, staring at his notebook and pacing the floor of Borteg’s.
“Are you not speaking to me?” Draco asks, and Harry turns, astonished.
“Neither do I,” Draco says, folding his arms crossly. “But I’m pretty sure all of this—” He indicates the mess of bracken with a sweep of his hand, “Isn’t supposed to be here. If we can get rid of this, we might be able to see what else there is.”
“Oh my god,” Draco whispers, eyes fluttering closed as Harry sinks down onto him and stays there, hands resting on Draco’s chest and thighs clamped tightly around his hips. “Just… give me a second.”
“You’re silly,” Rose says solemnly.
Eliza beams and wipes hot chocolate foam from her mouth with her sleeve. Luna sighs.
Needle ignores him, plonking himself at Draco’s feet and staring up at him beadily. Harry opens the letter and leans against the counter to read it.
She turns to them slowly, mouth pressed into a thin line.
For a moment, he just stares at the intruder, awash in a tide of suppressed emotions and responsibilities. He doesn’t want to admit whatever that owl is carrying into the contented little bubble he and Draco have built for themselves, and he wonders if he might just fling the letter into the loch for Angus to deal with. But he won’t.
“I think that while we know as little as we do, it’s prudent to be discreet,” Florean explains.
Florean’s mouth drops open. “You can’t be serious.”
“Oh, shut up,” Harry mutters, smiling. “I mean that… well, you can hardly be doing this for the money.”
“You haven’t got any change, have you?” comes the response, and he moves reluctantly from the fire to the counter.
“It’s not…” Harry stops, horrified by the flush creeping up the back of his neck and his sudden inability to construct a proper sentence. “He likes me, but I’m not… I don’t want to do this, Esmee. You remember what happened the last time, don’t you? And the time before that? And—”
Draco jerks and comes over Harry’s fist, tightening around him and dragging his orgasm through him with such surprising intensity that his knees turn weak and he has to grip Draco’s hips to keep himself upright. For long, breathless seconds, they lean against the tiles, and then slowly fold to the shower floor, facing one another in a tangle of limbs as the hot water continues to hammer down around them.
“Maybe she fell down the stairs,” Eilish suggests, voice much smaller than usual.
“Ooo,” Ron says, looking delighted to have a distraction from his dinner. “Terry’s older brother? He’s a good-looking bloke, Harry.”
“I don’t know,” Harry whispers back, “but you really needn’t bother. I’m happy coming to the wedding on my own and I’m sure you and Hermione both have better things to do.”
“Are we likely not to have time?” Harry asks, shivering and sniffing the air hopefully as the pub door opens and the warm smell of hot chips and beer wafts towards him on the breeze.
Harry stares into silvery-grey eyes at close range, heart hammering against his ribcage. Draco leans closer and kisses him, slowly, fiercely, and something inside him snaps.
“And I’m sure you’d have made him sorry he was ever born, but it’s all okay. Everything’s back to normal and I promise she won’t be able to tell the difference today,” Harry assures. “Unless she talks to one of Draco’s chefs and mentions their knives. Those guys are still pretty mad.”
He doesn’t need to be in love with anyone, he tells himself firmly, tasting raindrops as they drip from the ends of his hair and into his mouth. He has tried, he has failed, he has created disaster after unmitigated disaster. And yes, Draco is surprisingly kind, interesting, and good with children, but that doesn’t mean…
“Charming,” Draco mutters, but Potter grins at him as he pushes past to check on the lizards.
“Hello, Draco,” says Francis, the presenter of the late night show, bobbing out of his own studio and into the one shared by the earlies. “Hello, Pansy. Goodness, you’re early.”
Slowly, the little room fills with other members of staff, each bringing with them their own colours and moods, fanned out around them for Luna to see. Mary Ann, the cook, seems happy and content, clearly oblivious to the dissatisfaction of certain small boys. Sam, the manager, is flickering anxiously as he so often is, but he finds a real smile for Luna as he edges past her to get to his desk. As the chatter in the room rises to an uncomfortable level, Luna tunes it out and focuses on Draco.
“Yeah.” Harry leans on his broom, a slightly sheepish expression edging out the scowl.
“We could... just leave.”
Harry, who has been gazing at him calmly, just nods. “You know where the forms are.”
Harry shakes his head. “No. No, we did all that. This was something different… the last few months, he’s been coming in, and… would you excuse me?”
It is, Harry supposes, glancing at the clock, only half past nine, but Draco has been hidden away since the end of yesterday’s meeting and he doesn’t know whether to feel irritated or concerned. Despite his better judgement, he actually misses the frequent interruptions and the constant flow of bizarre whisky-related questions. It makes no sense that there should be a request to find a signature whisky of all things and then… nothing.
“No one. Everyone’s fine,” Draco says, and then sighs. “I’m not sure how to put this, but Harry and I have come to a realisation.”
“How did I?” Draco counters. “You wouldn’t stop talking.”
“That almost sounds like a yes to me,” Harry cries, glimmer brightening as he reaches over to poke Draco in the arm.
“That’s not what I’m asking.”
“Wow,” Rose whispers, eyes wide.
Harry laughs, tipping his head back on the pillow. Now starting to feel hot and sticky, he swipes his hair out of his eyes and drags Draco down for an awkward but very necessary kiss.
Harry glances at him. “What, even when you were at school?”
“Doesn’t she have protective spells on her till?” Charlie asks, allowing Kingsley to plant both paws on his knees. “The last time I was in Diagon Alley everyone had those big old metal ones that only open with a spell.”
Harry flushes and rubs the back of his neck. “Er… not today. I brought your swan back. He turned up in our shop and I thought you might be missing him.”
“Is this even your day?” asks one of the care-workers, sounding puzzled.
“Possibly,” Draco says, meeting his eyes in the rearview mirror.
“A connection like no other,” Corrie puts in. “You see, he’s in a funny mood this morning and the bus can feel it.”
“Did you see us all waving?”
“Why not?” Luna asks, earning herself a sharp look from Sam.
Heart full of almost painful warmth, Draco reaches out and takes his hand. Ivy shrugs.
,” Draco amends, and there is a twist of heat in the pit of Harry’s stomach, just as Draco kisses him.
Harry puts his finger to his lips and traces the word with his wand. Together they watch the ‘o’ and the ‘u’ change positions and share a secret grin.
“Come on, you must be freezing,” he says, opening the door and allowing a wave of warm, delicious-smelling air to escape into the street.
Eilish clears her throat. “I was going to invite you to my house for Christmas dinner,” she says, sounding disappointed. “My Flora’s coming home and I thought it would be lovely if all of us could celebrate together—all the girls and you and Draco, you see.”
Heart thudding, Harry kisses him slowly, tasting the salt on his skin and stroking his hair back from his eyes. He’s still hard, still aching, still deep inside Draco, but he doesn’t move.
Caroline gets up from her seat on the ground without enthusiasm. “I wish Lori was here.”
“Swimming with the Giant Squid!” Luna calls, laughing as Draco and Eliza come to a stop and stumble against each other with the momentum.
“Is that…?”
“Now there’s an image,” Magnus mumbles. Draco pretends not to hear him.
Harry glances at him. “I take it your father won’t get a copy where he is.”
“I’ll help if you like,” Draco says suddenly. “I have a… well, a gap in my schedule at the moment.”
Harry, who is standing at such an angle that he can clearly see Corrie’s cards, thinks they would all be very interested to know that she has neither an Ace of Diamonds nor an Ace of Hearts. He is also completely unsurprised that her pile of Knuts is the biggest by far.
Draco looks up slowly. “What flagpole?”
“When I get married, it had better be a nice sunny day,” Miss Lister says to Draco, and he nods as though to say ‘I agree, and it’s
The moment it hits the water, it begins to fizz and spin violently, sending vivid turquoise waves out in every direction. Harry watches, fascinated when tiny stars and bits of glitter gush from its centre, snaking their way towards him and sticking to his wet skin. Within a matter of seconds, the bathroom is full of the scent of peppermint, and Harry’s bathwater has turned a beautiful opalescent shade of blue.
“Elegua is…” Harry hesitates, thinking of the flash of heat and Draco looking sad and Esmee’s stern face. “Actually, he’s pretty good. He’s leading me in a different direction than I expected, but I think I might be alright with that.”
Just ahead is the sprawling patch of grassy land where George and Angelina will be married in three days’ time. The marquee lies folded flat in a halo of protective magic, and beside it, stacks and stacks of wooden chairs that he knows Ron is planning to turn orange. Amused, Harry turns back to the house, wondering what Molly is up to with the wedding so close.
Harry snorts. “I think you’re giving me a bit too much credit, Es. I’m not nearly that organised. Besides, you know half of my presents will come from your shop.”
“No,” Draco says and then stops, closing his notebook as the bell above the door jingles and a customer steps inside.
Timothy nods, seeming to grow a couple of inches taller under Florean’s expert reassurance.
“You’re very commanding when you want to be, aren’t you?” Draco says, touching Harry’s face with cold fingers and making him blush.
Harry grins. “I need to speak to the Minister about a poisoned... what?”
“Yes, I really do,” he promises.
“Okay,” Harry says, tunnelling into his blanket and wondering if the Pepper-up will take away this creeping sense of dread along with his fever and hacking cough. “I’m sorry if you get my cold.”
“Best behaviour!” shouts Benny.
“I suppose that would make you Watson, would it?”
“You’re nice to everyone except me. Even the mean people.”
“Is this resting?” Hermione asks, and he shrugs.
Draco sighs. “I am a potential customer, with questions just like any other,” he says airily. “I’m going home now, but I’ll be back.”
**~*~**
Draco frowns. “Carrots?”
“Probably not, then.”
“Have you been drinking again?” Malfoy asks, eyes fixed on the road.
“Can I have a quick look?” Arthur asks hopefully.
Feeling rather exposed, he throws caution to the wind and dashes into the loch, gasping when the cold water hits his skin and forcing himself to keep wading until he is up to his shoulders.
Luna sighs, unable to decide whether she is amused or exasperated. When Draco spreads out on the floor with them and doesn’t complain about the indignity of the situation, she decides that amusement is for the best.
of December, and they will bring you home four days hence. With love and gratitude for all that you do, Eilish, Danica, Ida, Corrie, Audrey and Thora.”
“It’s alright, Mum, I know you were just worried for your favourite son,” George says, basking in the groans from his siblings. “I haven’t missed lunch, have I?”
“I know,” Draco says, and then kisses Harry with such slow, teasing care that his heart swells painfully and he has to wrap his hand around himself and grip almost hard enough to hurt to avoid coming all over himself with a whimper.
“You could wear some of these,” Ron says, lifting his foot to show off a woolly pair of red and white argyles. With a grin, he presses the topmost stripe and the socks begin to emit an off-kilter rendition of ‘White Christmas’.
The crow flaps down from the tree, circling her twice and dropping a small object at her feet. She bends and picks up a small, shiny glass pebble, the kind that people use to fill up old vases and make them look decorative. She fishes a cherry from her bag for him and then polishes the pebble on her sleeve before attaching it to her cardigan with a sticking spell.
“I don’t suppose you want to talk about your hair,” he says, remembering just in time to drop the scowl and adjust his face into a neutral expression.
“With the biddies, I imagine,” Draco says, poking Harry up the stairs and closing the doors behind them. “This will be easier without her, believe me.”
,” Draco says, and his tone is so harsh that the swan retreats to a corner and folds himself into a contrite position.
“You’re very quiet,” Draco says. “Should I be worried?”
“What? Who? Harry?” Draco mumbles without looking up.
It’s fuzzy at close range and without his glasses, but this pillow is all wrong. The fabric is crisper and lighter than his trusty brushed cotton winter set, and more to the point, magpies don’t usually talk about chocolate as much as this one is doing now. Disoriented, Harry tries to roll over but something heavy is occupying the small of his back. He shivers, suddenly aware that he is barely covered by the bedclothes, and the thing on his back lets out a small, irritated hiss.
After being unceremoniously ejected from the bus at around ten o’clock, Harry stands under a hot shower until his extremities begin to thaw out, takes Ginny’s book to bed and falls asleep with the taste of Draco’s hot chocolate lingering on his lips. This time, when he wakes, he doesn’t even bother to tell himself that he’s going to avoid the Knight Bus. Not only does he think he has made a breakthrough with Draco at last, he misses the biddy club and he doesn’t know how to make his house any cleaner without inviting Molly round to inspect it. While he suspects she has both the time and the inclination to do so, he’s not going to ask.
When no one can eat another thing, everyone returns to the house, where they stuff themselves into the living room and play ridiculous games by the fire. To everyone’s surprise, Mr Borteg is particularly adept at ‘Name That Quidditch Foul’ and wins himself a whole pile of Molly’s home-made toffee. Rose climbs up beside Narcissa and watches her sew neat stitches into a little embroidery hoop, and Harry watches from his sprawl at Draco’s side as Narcissa patiently shows her how it’s done. Hermione hold Hugo’s hands as he walks around the room, insisting on touching each person as he passes. She smiles at Harry and he smiles back, full of good food and pleasantly weary. When Needle and Kingsley curl up together at his feet to sleep off their Christmas treats, he watches their slow, contented breathing with quiet envy.
Jean frowns and then bursts into laughter. “One glass! I meant one glass. Don’t you go writing that down, your boss will think I’ve got a problem.”
“Not a word of it, I have been here the entire time.”
This time, Molly does not attempt to impress him with French. Instead, she points to the roast leg of lamb and bleats into Louis’ startled face. Apparently pleased with herself, she turns away, missing Ginny’s smothered snort of laughter and the stream of whispered French that follows it.
“Draco, I hate to break this to you, but there are no cupboards anywhere near me.”
“Draco,” she cries, springing to her feet with no sign of stiffness in her hip. “Oh, hello, Harry, dear,” she adds, beaming at him, but it is Draco who receives her fierce hug and Draco who returns it instantly, wrapping the tiny lady in his arms and mumbling to her fiercely.
“That Molly Weasley is a marvel,” Eilish says with a happy sigh.
“Drama, drama,” he manages, and then stops. “Why are people walloping cods? I can’t imagine it’s good for them.”
Hurriedly, Harry retrieves his cards and attempts to spell away the bent corners. In a flurry of movement, envelopes are distributed around the table and before long, he has a small pile in front of him, each with his name written in green or red or gold script. Following the example of Draco and the biddies, he opens each one, admires the picture and reads the message before setting it aside. Each card has clearly been chosen with care, and he can only hope that his own choices are up to scratch.
“You took it upon yourself to relocate the swan. The swan came back. You failed,” Draco says at last.
Rose laughs and unbuttons her lime green coat, refastening it around her neck as a cape. “Me too.”
Everyone claps as nine or ten people emerge from behind various trees and arrange themselves in one corner of the garden. Each is dressed in multicoloured robes, the men’s sitting just above the knee and displaying some rather impressive calves, and the women’s flowing and swishing around their ankles. In each person’s hands is an instrument—flutes, tin whistles, violin, bodhran, guitar and an enormous, ornate accordion.
“Never mind.” Ron ruffles her hair and leans down to whisper to Harry. “Why, mate? Why would you do that?”
“These are just from this morning. You’ll have to forgive the handwriting, it’s bad enough when he’s not being over-caffeinated.”
Hermione calls it ‘emotional intelligence’, this thing that her two friends and colleagues seem to lack. Both are clever, of course, but this is decidedly not about that. Obviously, Harry
“Elsa,” Hermione says. “The giraffe doesn’t have to say anything.”
“He’s got a crocodile,” Pansy says vaguely, dropping back against her chair and allowing Draco to wheel her out of the way.
Caroline nods, eyes large. “I didn’t mean to, though.”
. “Just let them get on with it,” she suggests, so they do.
Draco laughs, filling the cold air with a sound that wraps around Harry like his fading warming charm.
“Thank you for doing the chairs,” she says, flicking her wand to open the prop chest and then the cupboard that contains the record player.
He clicks on the omnivox as the current song draws to a close. “And she’s here,” he announces, making sure to inject a note of sardonic congratulation into his voice. “Good of you to join us, Pans.”
Mrs Purley scoffs. “Not a chance, love. There’s no quality to them, they’re cheap. As soon as you put anything in them, they start to unravel. Look,” she says pulling gently at the top of the sack and easily fraying the fabric. “You get little pieces all over the place—like that.”
“Do you think the bus needs a mascot?” Harry wonders, inspecting the beetle’s characteristic bristles.
Then again, he is late for lunch.
The sun is directly overhead by the time they stop for a break, leaning up against the cabin and drinking cold water from thick white mugs. The garden is far from tidy, but they have made a creditable start, Harry thinks. All of the stray leaves have been swept and bagged, the earth around the struggling herb garden has been cleared of weeds and detritus, and Harry has begun the mammoth task of cutting back an enormous thorned bush that seems determined to rip him to shreds in the process.
“I know, but—”
“Mrs Next Door had hers up on the first,” she says reproachfully. “Paper chains and everything.”
“Your mother,” Harry says, raising his voice above the chatter of the chefs. “I saw your Borteg’s bottles and I asked if you like the whiskies and she said you didn’t drink them. You didn’t drink any of them. Why would you lie to me? Why would you lie about something so weird?”
“I’ve got money,” he says, digging in his coat pocket. He catches Draco’s eye and adds, “Can I still get a toothbrush for fifteen Sickles?”
“I don’t want to make one, I want to find one that’s… good grief, did you hear that?”
“No, Ginny, love, I’m doing chicken,” Molly says, reprising her dance and pointing at the birds.
Draco lets out a sound that is half laugh and half whimper. “Everything. Table. Armchairs. Biddies. I can’t.”
“Just you today?” Harry asks, letting himself into the quill shop.
As the banging and scraping finally comes to a stop and the utensils are collected by Mary Ann, Luna finds that she can, as predicted, still hear the unholy racket. She sticks a finger in her ear and wiggles it about, hoping to somehow dislodge the ghost of the sound, but it’s no use.
Draco groans softly and pulls away, hands slipping to Harry’s hips. His eyes are dark and hazy and Harry isn’t sure he will ever be able to look away from them again.
Harry doesn’t catch her mumbled spell, but it’s a practised movement that draws the string up from the desk until it rears there like a drunken cobra, then shoots forward without warning and threads itself through each pearl in turn. Finally, the bracelet glows with the purest white light and then clatters back onto the counter, fully intact.
He is still smiling to himself when he reaches Borteg’s and finds Timothy and Draco peering at the poorly-repaired glass.
“What did you do to him?” Harry asks, gently holding out a hand to the swan. It bites him.
“What are they?” he asks, picking one up at her encouraging gesture.
Draco’s mouth flickers at one corner. “You have glitter and tiny little silver stars on your face. I’m not sure how else to put it.”
“I’d like to hear that,” Draco says.
They leave the room in silence. Not a word is spoken as they rise slowly through the building to the topmost floor. Draco’s heart hammers and he flicks secret glances at Harry, turning away when he glances back, feeling suddenly strung out and fearful. The editor, a tall, dark-skinned man in midnight blue robes, flings open the door of his office when they are only halfway along the corridor, and they scramble to reach him before he closes it again, and Draco thinks he might. He looks furious, and in a place like this, there’s no use trying to predict behaviour.
“I’m glad you think so,” she says. “I hear you used to play.”
“That’s where you think it was broken?” Harry asks.
Draco laughs. “My treat. You didn’t look like you were having a particularly pleasant time.”
Draco’s presence seems to fill the space, pinning him into his fold-up seat and forcing him to fight his urge to fidget, to chew his nails and shuffle his feet. He bites back an offer to tidy up the mess left on the table just as Draco glances at him, and when he frowns and turns back to the wheel, Harry sighs inwardly and attempts a more neutral expression.
The cat in question, now leaping onto the dashboard and miaowing loudly at Draco, is the biggest Harry has ever seen, larger even than Crookshanks, and with an elegant bone structure that gives off the impression of fine breeding and great intelligence. Her long fur is mostly dark grey, with sections of pure white under her chin, great tufts from both ears, and whiskers that seem almost comical in length.
“What do you think they’re talking about?” Rose asks as Harry, Draco and Florean walk out into the corridor.
“They are, but Harry said we might be in the newspaper. I thought I’d better wear my newest ones.”
Feeling slightly sick, Draco Disapparates and spends the rest of his afternoon staring at his living room walls. Every time he thinks of going back to the Magical Menagerie, his heart gives a horrible lurch and an unsettling tingle runs down his spine. Pansy would say ‘there’s a surprise!’ and ‘get your arse back over there and deal with it’, but Pansy is not here. He’ll just give it a couple of days.
“Rampant,” Draco supplies, glancing over his shoulder. “Rampant alcoholism.”
“Let’s change the subject, shall we?” Hermione says, much to Harry’s relief. “Rose said she enjoyed walking back from school with Draco yesterday.”
Draco frowns, navigating the bus around such a tight bend that Harry has to hold his breath.
Several hours later, hunger begins to stir and they walk up the hill and through the rain to the Old Trout, where Gertie welcomes them with an ‘aye, youse’re still here, then?’ before disappearing into the kitchen and emerging a few minutes later with two enormous plates of food.
“I take a little break,” she says, shaking out her long red hair. “Please putting your donations in tins by stalls. Thank you.”
“They’re all for you,” Harry says nonchalantly, slipping his finger under the lid. “It is, of course, a box of spiders, but…”
“I was being strident, remember?” Draco says, wrinkling his nose. “I’m going to make coffee. Pansy, behave yourself.”
“Can we talk?” Harry calls.
“Don’t fuss,” Corrie tells her. “What he don’t know won’t hurt him.”
In spite of his bitten legs and fingers, he only wants good things for the swan, and it is far better off here with its own kind than marauding around Diagon Alley, frightening dogs and avoiding edible projectiles. Satisfied that he’s done the right thing, Harry walks back through the park, shoving cold, sore fingers into his pockets and quickening his pace when the nearby church clock chimes three. He makes just one brief stop before heading to his usual Disapparation point, and the striped paper bag rustles happily in his coat pocket as he makes the jump to Ottery St Catchpole.
,” Ron adds.
“All sorts,” the woman says. “Mainly gospel stuff and a few Christmas songs. That’s what they’ve asked for. Oh! You know them, don’t you? Are you going up there now?”
“What have I forgotten?”
“Brunch is boring,” Rose says from the floor. “I love your roast, Granny.”
Harry pauses, taking in the shelves full of yarn and wondering if he might find something for Corrie inside. Five minutes later, he emerges with a paper bag containing a set of decorated wooden needles and a ball of wool as soft as Juno’s fur. In Flourish and Blotts, he picks up a book about endangered magical insects for Ida, and in the shop next door, he finds a baking tray for Danica that can be altered to cook cakes in a whole array of shapes, just with the tap of a wand, and a subscription for Eilish to a ‘Rare Tea of the Month’ club.
“What are you going to sing for them?” Rose asks, crunching into her cone.
“Ooh, those are her favourite,” Eilish says, taking the macaron from Harry and placing it next to Ida’s empty cup with great care. “Her husband used to go all the way to France to get them for her.”
Without waiting for a response, she turns and scuttles back behind the bar, where a small queue is forming.
“I’ll go. I’ll come up with something for Tom to tell everyone,” Sophie says, taking off at a run.
Harry grins. “Yeah, does it?”
“I saw something,” Harry says grandly. He points at the Eye and manages to knock Ginny’s antlers askew. “Sorry.”
“I’m not a bird, I’m a bat,” she tells him, flapping her fabric wings and dropping her lunchbox on the pavement.
“He opens the shop at the weekends,” Potter says. “And I really wish you’d stop calling me ‘Potter’ all the time.”
Harry glances at the shop beside Borteg’s and wonders. “What about her? She never answers her door if she’s not expecting someone.”
“Have you got any Muggle money?” Draco whispers. “Because I haven’t! They’re not going to like it if we just stand here and stare at them.”
“Harry, of course,” Danica says.
“Good heavens,” says the tall woman with the glittering pin at her throat. “You’d better come in.”
He says nothing. She nods, seemingly satisfied.
“Sorry,” he murmurs, and then turns and stalks across the lawn to the house.
“How very intriguing,” Mr Borteg says, turning to Rose as they move on in search of Narcissa.
Luna sips her hot chocolate slowly, allowing the first threads of an idea to weave themselves into being. It would be wonderful for the children to have a piano, and she thinks she might just be able to help Harry and Draco at the same time.
“That will be nice,” her father mumbles, smiling serenely.
“‘Potter and Malfoy’s Secret Love—was their rivalry just an act?’” Draco reads aloud, brow furrowing. “Give me strength.”
“Well, that’s quite exciting,” Harry admits, and Draco smiles. “Don’t you cook? You seem to have quite a fancy little kitchen up there.”
“My mummy died, too,” Eliza says, screwing up her face for a moment. “And my daddy.”
“And how do you know… what are their names?”
“I didn’t realise you remembered.”
“I can see the others!” Benny cries, jumping up and waving. “GARETH!” he bellows.
“You were saying that the homework was bad. Really bad,” he says triumphantly, but Draco just rolls his eyes.
“Chocolate frogs!” yells the little boy in the corner, beaming as the nurse unwraps his package for him. “Am I allowed to eat them?”
Harry groans. “Isn’t that some sort of Muggle-baiting?”
As they head further into the heart of the village, there are signs of festivity everywhere. The shops and houses, made of warm, honey-coloured stone, are lit from within by gentle lamps and strung with multi-coloured lights. The iron railings and neat rows of conifers sparkle with frost and delicate decorations, and in the square, an enormous spruce sits slightly askew, dotted with glimmering bulbs and towering over a traditional wooden nativity scene, the likes of which Harry has not seen since he was a child. Behind the tree looms a black and white fronted Tudor building with its sign, flapping in the wind, reading ‘The Cart and Earwig’.
Screwing up his nose in sympathy, Harry says nothing for several seconds, instead watching the little lines of tension on Draco’s face and the rigid set of his shoulders, silently wondering if finding it all rather stirring means that something is very wrong with him.
“I’m just saying that… well…” Harry attempts, frowning.
“Alright,” Luna says, touching her fingertips to Mr Abernathy’s glass pebble for luck. “Here’s the plan.”
“Can I ask where we are now?” Harry says, stretching as Draco opens the doors.
“Feeling under the weather, love?” she asks kindly.
Draco opens the doors and peers at him through the darkness. “Yes?”
Harry snorts, and then pokes him. “Here they are.”
“I’ve heard he’s very nice to his mother,” Molly says, and everyone turns to her. “Don’t look at me like that, it’s important. You can learn a lot about a boy from the way he treats his mother.”
“What about that other thing?” Draco asks. “You know, the weird one...”
“I’ve forgotten,” Winston says firmly, with such an exaggerated shrug that his elbow bangs into Surya’s and she drops her ice cream straight onto Stanley’s back.
“Of course not,” Harry says, crunching the last of his cone and holding up the notes. “Fortunately, we’ve also got these.”
“What are you talking about?” Otis asks from the other end of the table. “Is it a secret?”
Draco’s smile disappears. “What are you talking about?”
“The what?” Harry asks, eyebrows disappearing under his fringe.
Draco follows him.
“Yes, yes,
“I’ll clean the floor in a minute,” Harry says, suddenly feeling sleepy and not like playing Quidditch at all. The drum of the rain against the window has become soothing somehow, and he can’t think why he would want to be anywhere else.
Harry sighs heavily. “Who is it this time?”
“Not with your words, no,” Esmee admits. “I know you, Harry, and I know him. Why don’t you just tell me what happened?”
“I’m not going to argue with a man who stole from me,” Mrs Purley sniffs.
Mr Borteg wanders in from the distillery to greet them, exchanging a significant glance with Harry before he approaches the desk and asks Rose what she’s planning to create today. He has been briefed along with Draco, and if everything goes to plan today, she won’t learn about anything that she doesn’t need to. Of course, that does mean that progress on the investigation itself is almost non-existent, and despite Harry’s attempts to run into the back room and stare at the charts for a little while every time Rose is particularly absorbed in something, by mid-morning he has achieved nothing but a slightly twisted ankle from tripping over an uneven flagstone.
Harry smiles. “Did you think Rose just turned up on her own?”
“It’s Wednesday the twenty-fifth of May, it’s six fifteen, Draco is late, and here is your news update,” Pansy is telling her omnivox smugly when Draco walks into the studio the next morning.
“Are you serious?” he asks, staring at Draco and blithely ignoring a large group of people as they shuffle past with Madam Malkin’s bags, darting glances and whispering amongst themselves.
“I heard there was a cutlass involved,” he says, and behind Draco, Harry snorts with laughter.
“Shan?” he calls, walking behind the counter and peering into the back room. “Esmee?”
Feeling somewhat restored by an afternoon of enthusiastic carol singing and the ladies’ repeated insistence that he absolutely mustn’t give up on Draco, Harry sleeps well and drinks his coffee in the kitchen as the sky turns from orange to pink and finally a calm, clear blue. Despite the bright winter sunshine and the fact that the snow has all but turned to grey slush in the street, there is a fierce nip in the air, and when Harry prepares to leave the house just before eleven, he hunts around for gloves and a hat.
“Of course.” Harry turns the object in his hands and laughs, recognition hitting him in an unexpected place. “This is Snape.”
No one has definitely seen Malfoy in years. He had stopped appearing in the Prophet shortly after the end of the war and has, since then, seemed to keep his business to himself. Not that Harry has a problem with that, of course. He had been happy enough at the time that his testimony had helped keep Draco and his mother out of Azkaban, and since then… well, he hasn’t really given it much thought. He has caught glimpses from time to time, of course, but he has stopped mentioning those to his friends because all they do is make fun of him.
Harry opens his mouth to suggest that they retrieve their map when Draco taps him on the shoulder and points into the opposite corner of the distillery. Mr Borteg has been busy, it seems. Their parchment map is now tacked firmly to the wall, and beside it sits a desk, two chairs, and a pewter mug full of pens and quills.
“Mr Potter,” she says, eyebrows lifting towards her severe hairline. She glances between the two of them, momentarily speechless, and then grants Harry a little smile. “Well, obviously
Eilish regards the mouse in Harry’s hands with deep suspicion, but the others lean in to inspect it, touching its whiskers and little paws as it remains magically frozen.
Harry grins and ignores him. Arthur emerges from the crowd with a collection of familiar items, which he places on the table with care.
“Vesseur?”
“What about?”
Pansy’s expression turns shrewd. “You’ve fallen out, haven’t you? Some time between that—” She points at the newspaper, “—and this morning, you’ve managed to upset each other. For fuck’s sake, Draco, that must be some kind of record.”
“She’s exaggerating,” confides Danica. “She can see if someone takes the last biscuit.”
“One of my best, I think,” she tells Mr Abernathy, who is pecking around in the long grass.
“What?” Harry asks, hiding a smile when Draco flushes and shrugs.
“Probably best, since I don’t have any money left,” Harry mumbles to himself.
“Oh, god,” Harry whispers, pressing his hot cup against his face and closing his eyes. “That’s not better. That’s not better at all.”
Harry smiles. “More beach for us, then.”
“Nobody said anything about gallivanting, Draco,” Luna says. “You’ll be allowed to go at your own pace.”
“You know what I mean,” Draco interrupts, wishing he’d through to cast an umbrella charm as rivulets of rainwater begin to run from the ends of his hair and into his mouth. He could cast one now, of course, but he doesn’t want to give Potter the satisfaction. “I’m fully aware of how ridiculous this sounds coming from me, but... are you alright?”
Fortunately, George and Angelina’s honeymoon tickets have not been given away, so they take the fat brown envelope and head to the tea shop next door, where they all order hot drinks and buttered toast and examine the contents.
“Too far,” Harry sighs, but he lifts his head at the sound of running water.
“I think she probably was two weeks ago,” Harry says. “She’s had time to think about things, and to realise that she could have done a lot more to help you.”
“I know why you’re here. You’re just like all the others.”
“Long enough to know there’s nothing new on this earth,” Lee says, shuffling back towards the door. “And that this is a bloody awful song.”
“You’ll be big enough to go with them soon,” he tells the little boy, who yawns and winds little fingers into his own curls.
“It’s not Mr Pike.”
“I’d like to be, one day,” Harry says calmly, just as he always does. “I’m not in a rush.”
Rose peers up at him, mouth twisted in contemplation. “Uncle Harry, do you need a hug?”
“And we do not dance,” Draco adds.
“Exactly.” Draco leans in and kisses Harry again, firmly, deliberately, making him gasp.
“Good. Then we are in agreement. The Daily Prophet will run a full retraction of the article and all allegations contained therein. The employees concerned will have their contracts terminated immediately. We will make a copy of this memory for our records and the original will be returned to you.”
“I suspect I probably am,” Mr Borteg agrees, voice dipping into a particularly sombre range. “And what are these?”
“How long have you been there?” he demands, hating the way his voice wobbles.
Officer Kettleworth finishes his currywurst, clearly amused. The second the last morsel has disappeared, Draco flicks his wand and Harry jumps, all at once surrounded by a cool, clean sensation that ripples pleasantly over his skin.
“No, but it’s playing merry hell with my parcels,” Jean says sourly, drawing Harry’s eyes to a pile of boxes tied with stripy string now sitting in a puddle at the swan’s side. “Knocked them out of my hands, it did, the cheeky beggar.”
“I haven’t!” Harry shouts, gripping the metal pole until his fingers hurt. “I haven’t got anything worked out, you idiot, I just fucking hate lies, especially when they’re not necessary. Those women down there—”
“This is it. This is the one.” He clutches the bottle as though Harry might change his mind and demand to have it back. “Thank you so much. You have no idea… I can’t… just, thank you.”
Rose twists in his lap and fixes him with wide eyes. “How did you know about that?”
Harry laughs. “I do think I’m running quite low on fucks these days.”
“They are a credit to you,” Narcissa says, rising to shake Molly’s hand. “I shall look forward to meeting more of them tomorrow.”
“No, the
“Can you do it again?” asks one of the children, and Harry just looks at them.
Harry winces, and sure enough, a second or two later, George yelps. Neville looks at his wife admiringly and she shoots him a shark’s grin.
,” Draco says faintly as Harry nudges him across the lawn towards the lake.
“Why are you so difficult to find?” Draco demands, frantic tone of voice sending Harry’s pulse racing.
“For his ‘signature’ whisky?” Harry asks, sketching derisive air quotes, but Mr Borteg just wanders back into his distillery without another word. “Fine,” he says loudly, uncapping the heavy pen and returning to his notebook.
“Well, Stanley,” he says after a moment, “I think you’re rather talented.”
“I’m so sorry about all this,” he says at the door, and to his surprise, Marius shakes his hand again.
Ron and Harry exchange glances and grin. George heaves a theatrical sigh.
“I think that’s a good start,” Esmee calls after him, sounding amused.
“Oh, that’s a lovely idea,” someone says, and Luna turns to see one of the teachers hovering in the doorway, arms full of exercise books.
“Ooh, do you like him?” asks Benny, abandoning his colouring book and turning from his seat at the table, legs swinging.
“Are you coming to my Christmas play, Uncle Harry?” she asks. “It’s about all the different animals at Christmas time and I’m going to be a giraffe so I have a
“Who wants hot chocolate?” Ron bellows, wobbling precariously on his blades.
“Yeah. But brilliant. There’s Ida, who’s a bit forgetful and really clever with plants, and Corrie, who knits all the time, and…”
“Looks like sack cloth,” Jean says, leaning forward in her chair to get a better look. “I get my owl food in bags like that—they tie at the top. The strings on mine are green, though, not brown.”
Harry laughs and turns to her. “I’m not sure how I should take that.”
“You never know.” The man pauses at the door. “I heard about the robberies, you know. Do you think they’ll find out who did it?”
Amused, Draco lifts his other hand and trails his fingers over the hot, damp skin. His fingertips drag over the points of new stubble and trace Harry’s wonderfully stubborn, if slightly sticky jawline. He’s a beautiful man, all rough edges and electric energy, and the fact that Draco is allowed to touch him any time he wants to remains almost uncomfortably thrilling. Harry sighs softly and Draco kisses him, ignoring the heat and leaning close, threading fingers into damp hair. A feeble wisp of a breeze sneaks in through the window, bringing with it the heavy scent of the brewing storm, and all at once, Draco’s head is full of white sheets and rain-damp hands and the palpable relief of a man who could not open his mouth to explain that he was hot and uncomfortable and fed up with the world.
In the end, he gulps at his wine, sets down the glass, and takes a deep breath.
“No, that was you as well.”
“That’s lovely,” he says, and Esmee beams.
“Right,” Deb says, nodding. “There definitely mustn’t be any biting, but Benny’s right—everyone needs to be on their very best behaviour, and that includes staff.”
Harry glances at Draco, anxiety only increasing when their fingers brush together for a fraction of a second. He takes a deep breath and forces himself to focus.
“Yes.”
“Gravy boat,” he says proudly. “Gravy boat. This is funny.”
Harry frowns. “What if I’d liked him?”
Patrick looks up, making eye contact with both of them in turn and finally settling on Harry.
“I’ve always thought you were funny,” Harry says after a moment.
“The girls will be so pleased that you two have worked things out,” Danica says loudly, reminding Harry of her presence and ensuring that he suddenly feels more awkward than he is really able to cope with at this time in the morning.
“I went to get some extra bacon,” she says, and Ron’s eyes light up. “You two look dreadful.”
“I don’t think you will,” says Otis, who has always been very literal.
In his mind’s eye, Draco smiles and rolls over, holding out his hand to pull Harry into bed with him, laughing as the bus veers around a corner and sends them sprawling in a delicious, tangled heap.
Draco’s eyes darken. The hand at Harry’s waist tightens and then falls away.
“Impressive,” Harry says, pulling at his end and watching the lights snaking through the snow in single file. “I’ve never seen that before.”
“It was brilliant,” Harry says. “In fact, I’m feeling very Christmassy now.”
“Such a lovely Needle swan,” she mumbles, stroking his feathers and laughing when he reaches out and unfastens the strap of her dungarees.
Draco holds out a hand to pull him up and Harry takes it, leaving the worn softness of the chair behind and standing slowly. He doesn’t let go of Draco’s hand, and Draco doesn’t pull it away. Instead, they stare at each other in silence, Harry’s heart beating so loud in his chest that he thinks the biddies must be able to hear it over the sound of their card game.
“Draco, Harry!” Eilish calls, before Harry has time to process that statement. “Would you like a cake?”
“I’m going to go and get you another drink,” Ron says, picking up their empty glasses. “Whatever it is you’re thinking about, stop it. Your only job is to guess the weight of the swan… which would be a very interesting stall at the village fete.”
“He’s had an adventure,” the girl says firmly, and for the rest of the journey, they walk in silence. Stanley burrows against the boy’s jumper, touching the splats of custard with his antennae and enjoying the warmth of his hands.
“I don’t not want to, either,” Harry mumbles, pressing into the touch and reaching for Draco’s mouth. “I want to. I want you.”
“Have you ever met a goat?” Harry says, amused. “They’re not going to come quietly.”
“Is it nice?” Hermione asks, and Harry nods, swallowing with some effort.
Molly abandons her feather duster and draws her wand from her apron, summoning a selection of little tubs before Harry can stop her.
“In your ear trumpet?” Danica says dubiously.
Harry turns to Draco. “You can sew?”
“Which way do you prefer them?” Draco asks.
“I should have known,” Draco says. “Saint Potter… building schools for African children… telling us all not to step on bristle beetles…”
Silence falls over the distillery as they each scan their pages. Harry waits for Draco to complain about his handwriting, which, compared to Sophie’s and Draco’s own, is chaotic and scribbly. To his surprise, Draco says nothing; he just frowns and taps his fingers on his chair arms, occasionally ruffling a thoughtful hand through his hair. When Harry realises that he is doing more staring than reading, he forces his eyes back to the page in front of him.
“Do I have to?” he asks, blinking hopefully up at his towering, pointy-hatted brother.
“I have tons of these things at Sage, which you’d know if you ever came in,” Draco says, turning away before Harry can see his expression and picking up the other end of the string. He attaches it to the lower edge of a windowsill and starts tacking the lights into place. “What exactly is it that you’re afraid of?”
Draco’s eyes burn him. He wants to look away but he seems to have lost control over his muscles to the point that he has no idea how he is continuing to stand.
Eilish grants him a coy smile. “You do court some very handsome young men.”
“Did you have a wash?” he asks picking up his sausage and then dropping it when the hot grease stings his owl-bitten fingers.
“That’s hardly fair,” Harry protests, but Draco seizes him by the shoulders and propels him up the street with surprising strength.
Harry closes his eyes for a moment, and when he opens them again, the pale eyes are still fixed on him with more intensity than he can take.
“Don’t embarrass them,” Esme chides, and then laughs. “I want to do it.”
Without the need for words, they leave the shop and follow a weary trickle of people down to the festival area, where Mrs Purley is handing out a fresh round of tea and attempting to keep Needle from poking his head into every last paper cup. Shan and Esmee are still working away in their kitchen, but almost everyone else seems to have gathered here, leaning in groups against the stalls, sitting on the rim of the fountain or sprawling on the cobbles beside the ice rink, clutching cups that release steam into the cold night.
“Sounds promising,” Harry says, suddenly beginning to feel rather festive.
“Aims,” she reads aloud, and Mr Abernathy stops trying to eat an entire windfall apple in one bite to look at her with interest, as though he hasn’t heard these words hundreds of times before. He’s polite like that. “To spread contentment and joy. To give each of my lovely friends something to smile about. To make their colours glow.”
Harry catches sight of Ron and Hermione in the second row and waves to them. He has a few questions for Ron, but there’s no time now. It’s fine, he thinks, showing the ladies their seats at the back of the hall and smiling to himself. None of them are going anywhere.
“No, not that.” Draco stares at him, eyes bright. “The meetings. We’ve been trying to work out what connects us all—what if the answer is in those meetings? Someone always takes notes, and it’s usually you or me or Sophie. We could get the notes and see if anything has happened when all of our names come up.”
“I’ve done a chicken,” Molly says suddenly. “I completely forgot. Would you like some?”
“You wanted to get away,” Harry says, shrugging, as the rain continues to hammer down around them. “And here we are. Away.”
his entire staff team,” Harry says, dragging the cold air deep into his lungs and then expelling it with a groan.
“I certainly am not,” Draco insists, and then: “Fine. What does that mean?”
“I think it’s supposed to be just the bride and groom on the honeymoon,” Ron says, biting into a piece of toast and wiping his fingers on his trousers.
Hermione picks up the cup at her elbow and sips it gratefully. “Something’s different,” she says.
“You can say it like that, but I think you enjoy it,” he says.
“Because the sky is
“Hey, hey,” Luna murmurs gently. “He didn’t mean any harm.”
“It’s a nice day,” he says, because he has to say something, and Draco’s smile flickers at the corners.
“What’s the matter?”
He looks so stiff and uncertain that all Harry wants to do is kiss him again, but then he remembers the disappearing biddies.
“Sherlock Holmes never wore a deerstalker, either, but you didn’t hear me complaining.”
“How did I sleep?” he wonders, but he can’t keep the stupid smile off his face.
Ignoring the curious glances of the elderly couple throwing food for the ducks, he drops to his knees on the damp grass and sets down the box. Slowly, the swan uses its weight to tip and then clamber free of its cardboard prison, massive wings held in a defensive crown. For a moment, the two of them regard each other in expectant silence, and then the swan strikes a bite at Harry’s trouser fabric and splashes into the water without a backward glance.
“What are you two whispering about?” Hermione asks from the other side of the room.
“Yeah, I’ve got a lot to do today, I’m afraid,” he lies.
“He’s already got one,” Arthur points out.
Harry smiles. At the other end of the counter, Draco takes his drink and wanders over to stand beside him.
They head out into the corridor in silence, stopping whenever someone dashes by or tries to cross their path. After a few false starts, they find Ida’s room at the end of the corridor, check for hospital staff, and then slip inside. Eilish, Corrie and Danica dispel their charms and drop Montague onto the sheets.
When the rain stops and the sun comes out, the shiny particles gleam all over Draco’s skin, making him look ridiculous and magnificent all at once. His undershirt, turned translucent by the water, sticks to his body, and the light, wiry muscles in his arms make Harry want to touch. He wonders what would happen if he just pulled Draco against him, cold, wet skin and warm mouths, rain dripping from the ends of hair and… Harry blinks.
“I found it,” he says. “I was making a cup of tea in his rooms and it was just sitting there in the teapot.”
“You’ve done an incredible job,” he says, reaching for Draco’s hand and threading their fingers together. “All of you.”
“It has to be through the pub,” Harry says, pushing his hands into his pockets and feeling a lick of warmth through the paper wrappings of his Orisha cube. “There’s no other way.”
“It’s in Deb’s schedule,” Sam counters.
“That mouse is going to be spoiled,” Corrie pronounces, and Danica stares at her.
Draco lifts a curious eyebrow but says nothing as they discard coats and socks and shoes, and when they crawl onto the soft sheets, Harry realises that he can no longer feel the chill from the window. His extremities are still numb, hands and face raw from the ice and the night air, but the heat from the copper bowls is soothing against his skin and Draco’s mouth is warm on his and nothing else really matters.
“Yes,” he says, frowning. “Perhaps I’ll go.”
“I don’t think you mean that,” Harry says, confused and careless.
“The singing or this?” she asks, pointing to her steaming tray.
“Fine, thank you,” he sighs, and turns to Draco. “Should I take that as an insult?”
“The toastie was nice… I think,” Harry says, frowning. “Your mother, she’s… she looked at me like she could see my insides. It was a bit unsettling.”
“I don’t think she sleeps,” a gruff voice answers when he shares this thought with Draco over dinner that evening.
His little hands sink into the soft, auburn fur and Kingsley inclines his great head to meet Hugo’s, sniffing him with impressive thoroughness and delivering a gentle lick to his curly hair.
Harry meets her eyes. They’re wonderfully calm. “I’m pretty cross, too.”
“I don’t want to believe this, but it’s right here in black and white,” Shan sighs. “I thought you were decent, I really did.”
He gets carefully to his feet and loops the string around the rearview mirror so that the little Snape bauble dangles neatly below and glares at the biddies through the red curtain.
At two minutes to twelve, all of the children are safely on board with seat belts on. The customary bus-ride singing has already begun. Harry, Mary Ann, Horace and all of the teachers are in place, strategically distributed around the bus to ensure that ‘best behaviour’ is, in fact, taking place. Luna hovers at the driver’s door, watching Sam’s expression as he, in turn, watches the door of the house.
“Do you mean marvellous?” Otis asks, as Serafina smiles gratefully at the tiny girl.
The children pause in their game and surge around Mary Ann, attracted by the upbeat rhythm, but Luna isn’t watching them. She is watching Harry. At first, nothing seems to be happening, and then his glimmer deepens and twists in confusion and she knows that the potion is taking hold. It’s happening sooner than she intended, but there’s nothing she or anyone else can do about that now. As the song continues to waft around the courtyard, the children bob their heads in time to the beat and Harry’s shoulders begin to twitch.
“Distracted?” Harry repeats, amused.
Still, he loves his house and the sight of it as they turn in to Grimmauld Place lifts his heart. He has left the lights on in the hallway and the entrance glows in the darkness like an invitation. The railings at the front of the house are lined with snow, and soon they will be wrapped in tiny festive lights.
“There’s something at the bottom,” Draco says, and Harry forces himself to focus.
“Please don’t give him ideas,” Draco mutters. “Anyway, it’s your turn to take him back.”
After desserts of rich, dark chocolate, caramel and frosted fruits, Draco fetches cups of coffee for everyone and the conversation drifts pleasantly, with everyone too full and contented to talk about anything more taxing than festive memories and plans for the following day. As the restaurant starts to wind down for the night, coats and cloaks are collected and Sage’s guests rise reluctantly from their seats.
“Harry, when you first started telling me about this biddy club, I thought you were suggesting that I join it,” she says, and Harry shakes his head vehemently. “Are you asking me to have them here? At the Burrow?”
“Don’t be, I get an awful lot done,” Danica says. “Baking in the middle of the night is very therapeutic.”
“Oh? Are we going somewhere?”
“He’s living with Draco now,” Harry tells him. “They sort of made friends.”
“Take that swan with you, please. Yesterday it was trying to eat the labels from all the spiced rums,” Mr Borteg sighs and lurches back into the distillery.
“Audrey doesn’t come on Thursdays,” Corrie says. “She comes on Mondays.”
“And I suppose you know where and when that is?” Harry asks hopefully.
“That would be very helpful,” Harry says, already looking forward to his first cup of tea. The soot has made his mouth dry and his throat sore, and the promise of a fragrant cuppa wraps around him as he organises people into groups and sends them on their way.
“No,” Harry gasps, hips jerking as Draco flicks his tongue over the sensitised flesh and begins to stroke him slowly.
William laughs. “Aye, they’ve no done a bunk. They’re Alpine goats, they like to be free range. Happy goats make happy milk, laddies.”
“Lost your tongues, have ye?” Gertie says, and then she is stumping her way over to them and setting down the basket on a wooden table that Harry has just unearthed from the clutches of the thorny bush. “Never mind. I’ve brought youse a wee bit of lunch. Bring the basket back when ye come for youse dinner, won’t ye? Youse’re doing a grand job out here!”
“I’m not afraid,” Harry says quickly.
“I may have been distracted for a moment or two,” Luna admits.
Molly smiles at all of them, seeming to puff up with pride. “Good. Well, George had better get here soon or it’ll be ruined.”
“Now, Draco, before I lose my self-control and get fired,” Harry insists, and Draco kisses him again.
“I was joking,” Draco calls after him as he jumps up and runs into the shop.
Malfoy that night, and not only have I been riding around on his bus every day since but now I’m starting to feel… I’m starting to feel something for him and now we’ve kissed, but according to him, we shouldn’t’ve, and I don’t know what I think but it’s all a bit overwhelming and I probably like him more than I should, and that’s pretty much everything, so… your thoughts?”
“Ah, yes. The Quibbler,” Draco says. He knows very well that it is called the Quibbler because he likes it and he reads it whenever he happens across a copy. He read it last month when he was waiting to have his eyes tested to check on the suitability of the reading glasses that he never wears. They make him look old.
“Hello. Are you following me?”
As he passes the fountain, he realises that the water has frozen completely, leaving the surface solid and the spray caught in mid-spurt, ice arcing gracefully as though captured in a snapshot. There is no sign of the swan, and Harry’s curiosity gnaws at him unhelpfully. Had the little bugger really followed Draco all the way back to his restaurant, and, if so, where the hell is it now?
“My gift to you. You’re sitting in it,” Draco says, crossness fading to exasperation. “Harry, you really are about as observant as a brick wall.”
The magenta wool clashes violently with his orange pyjamas, and he couldn’t look happier.
Reuben and his team are present, as are a proud Felicity and her new fruit-selling boyfriend, and a whole group of pink-robed people from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. In fact, the only person Harry can’t spot is Mr Pike from the Magical Menagerie, and he is so distracted by that fact that Rose has to tug at his arm and whisper that he’s going to miss the kissing.
“You’ve got to stand up for yourself, mate,” Ron says, and then forks an unfeasible amount of beans into his mouth.
“I’m trying to get more experience… with the kids…” he tries.
For a moment, there is nothing but expectant silence, and then Draco seems to shake himself.
“I’m afraid we’re rather in the middle of it here,” Eilish says with an apologetic smile. “Would you like a cup of tea?”
“Stop it,” he says, tugging Harry’s hand away from his mouth.
Rose looks up. “There are different ways. But this week we had to make a tally chart, like this,” she explains, showing him a piece of paper with rows and rows of little marks. “It could be about anything we wanted, so I made it about the shop.”
Harry turns to see all three of them getting to their feet.
“Winter stew,” he reads, admiring the plain typeface and the frill-free description. “Chicken and tarragon soup. Spinach and pine nut ravioli. Slow-roasted belly pork with—”
“Bugger off. I’m here, aren’t I?”
Harry grins. He’s hot and aching and he thinks he might have a better idea. Slowly, he withdraws and rolls onto his side, propping up his head on one hand and gazing down at Draco.
What he finds at the table makes his heart swell with relief and prickly warmth. The lacy tablecloth is strewn with earth, gardening tools and plants. Each of the ladies, including Thora and Audrey, has a long wooden box and is working away with gusto. Even Corrie has put down her knitting needles and is stuffing poinsettias and stripy grasses into her box, which she has spelled a vivid shade of scarlet.
Harry watches, certain that the swan will frighten the dog, and he draws his wand, just in case a swift charm is needed to push them apart. To his astonishment, Kingsley drops down on his front legs with his tail wagging, ready to play, and Needle stretches out his neck to touch his nose with the tip of his bill. Kingsley sneezes and Needle wags his tail feathers before taking off across the tiles at an unsteady trot with Kingsley loping after him. Harry and Draco exchange glances, wands lowered, as the pair reach the limits of the kitchen and then come streaking back, this time with Needle at the rear.

Harry sighs and levers himself to the floor. When he has obscured the bus with a couple of charms that are, to his irritation, not quite as effective as Draco’s, he lets himself back on and hesitates, listening to the clinking and shuffling and arguing coming from the players at the table.
“Am I talking loudly?” Harry shouts as they walk into the Prophet building a minute or so later. “I can’t tell any more.”
Molly rests her chin in one hand and purses her lips. “I’m not a big fan of that family.”
