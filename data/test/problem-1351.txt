"Ronald be quiet!" Hermione scolded "It's just a rumor, I don't know if it's true or not!" "Whats just a rumor?" Harry asked his best friends. He was very confused about why they were talking about Malfoy.  " 'Mione is saying that they are going to let Malfoy back into school!" The red-headed boy exclaimed "WAIT WHAT! He-what-but-can. Did actually you see him?"
Disclaimer; I do NOT own Harry Potter, so I am NOT J.K Rowling ( or else the books would be about drarry and not about Harry fighting Voldemort)
"Hey, we should get changed into our robes. There is just 10 minutes until we get to Hogwarts" Hermione said looking at her watch.  They nodded but before they got up to go to the bathrooms, someone knocked on the compartment door. Ron looked at Harry, then Harry got up and opened the compartment door.
"Thanks Luna." Harry smiled at her. "You are welcome, now if you excuse me, I need to go. Goodbye guys!" Luna left while Ginny sat next to Harry.  For the rest of the ride, Harry sat silently thinking about why McGonagall wanted to see him.
We stare at each other in silence. 'This is probably what Headmistress McGonagall meant when she said that she was concerned of how the other houses' response to Slytherins after the war' I thought.
"Mister Potter?" Obviously, my brilliant mind responded with, "Hmm?" Looking up I see Headmistress McGonagall staring at me with an amused look. "I asked if you could come inside. We have important matters to discuss." She answered, turning on her heel. "What? Yes. Matters are all important to discuss." I blurt out walking behind her and into her office.
Anyways, thank you for actually reading this piece of garbage! I'm going to start writing another fanfiction soon about Severus Snape and the Marauders sooo, yeah.
TRIGGER WARNING: SELF-HARM, ABUSE,RAPE!! If you have a problem with these things and boyxboy relationships, I advise that you leave. Plz tell me what you think! This is my first book so be nice! I suck at writing but I tried my best :)
"GET THE FUCK OFF HIM!" A familiar voice shouted as a ball of red light flashed behind me. Suddenly, Dustin went limp and fell to the floor. I slide down to the floor, bringing my knees to my chest and burying my face in my hands. The people in the bathroom were talking, but I blocked them out. It took me a moment to realize that I was having a panic attack. The cuts on my wrist were getting agitated and itchy so I started scratching and clawing at them.
"Well, when your done with.." He waved his hands at them "..this, get back to the compartment, we want to talk to you about how we are going to celebrate...you now." Harry notice that Malfoy looked tiered and had a few scares on his face. He also had a big bruise on his neck.
Sure, she is gorgeous, and young, and nice, but... I just... I mean, I knew I would never have a shot with Malfoy, but, I was sure he was gay. Especially when we were in 6th year and him and I sat next to each other for a project in potions and I saw Nott whisper something to him, and then Nott moaned and Malfoy's face went a bright red. Ever since then, I just always thought that they were dating, but I guess I was wrong.
"Dra-*hiccup*-co! Where are you my little slut!" Father yelled as he walked inside of the manor. This is the fifth time he's gotten drunk this week. Mother was out at diagon alley and would be back in a few hours, so she wasn't there to help me.
"Hello!" She said in a sweet voice smiling. If Harry wasn't gay, then he would have found the girl very attractive. "I'm sorry if I interrupted something, but I just wanted to say hello!" She reminded Harry of Luna Lovegood.
Then, there was 'That look,' which I get from mostly gryffindor's and ravenclaw's who think I was the reason that their family and their are dead.
On June 1st there is something called 'Operation Pride fall.' Idk if you have heard of it or not, but some fucked up people are going to go threw social media and harass people who are open about being part of the LGBT+ community.
"How are you and your mother? I haven't spoken to you ever since your father was let out of Azkaban." Luna stated as she started to fill up her plate.All six of us continued to talk, all well aware the Gryffindor a next to us are staring at us.
"The eighth year students are to sit at the same table together for all your meals. You also have to share a common room with two students of the same sex." McGonagall stated after noticing me and Pansy staring at the new table.
I stand there, zoning out wondering what McGonagall could possibly want from me this early in the year. Did I do something wrong? Maybe she got a time-turner and witnessed me and my friends doing something stupid, so she called me here to stop me and Ron from being 'Babbling bumbling band of baboons.' Maybe-
Hermione and Ginny were also yelling at Ron and telling him to leave Draco alone. They were all yelling at Ron, until they heard Alex screaming. Harry, Hermione, Ginny and Ron gasped
"And a reckless idiot that, Merlin forbids, ever thinks before he acts." Snape muttered, causing me to pout and McGonagall to cough, trying to hide her laugh. "As I was saying, I want you to try your best to make the slytherins feel welcomed and the other three houses from feeling threatened." The headmistress continued.
"Oh okay, well headmistress McGonagall says that all eighth years are going to share a common room. We will also have to share a dorm with one other person. And we don't have to wear our school robes." She looked around and all of a sudden she had an embarrassed look on her face, and blushed.
Ron bumped into Malfoy on purpose to prove to Hermione that he is still the death-eater prat they went to school with since first year, and probably to get a laugh.
"ZABINI! NOTT! GET THIS GREMLIN OFF OF ME, OR I SWEAR TO MERLIN I WILL TELL PANSY WHAT YOU DID WITH HER DIARY!" They both look down at me with fear in their eyes. Before my father got out of Azkaban, me Blaise, Theo and Alex went to Pansy's house and while Pansy was getting snacks, Theo found her diary and read it out loud in a high pitched voice. Then Blaise started to make a high pitched moan-like sound every time Pansy wrote about Hermione Granger.
I looked down to see that my sleeve was rolled up, and you could see old dried scares, along with fresh red ones. Theo stared at me, and I gave him a pleading look. I saw him take his wand out and whisper a quick spell that hid my scares. The gryffindors looked up at me in disbelief. I sneered at them, and said "Did you really think they were real?"
I didn't believe Malfoy. And I know none of us did either. Not Ron, not Ginny, and especially not Hermione. But, we didn't say anything and continued to walk out of the train. The entire carriage ride I was thinking about Malfoy. I would never admitted that I was thinking about how Malfoy said he loved Alex.
Anyways, thank you for actually reading this piece of garbage! I'm going to start writing another fanfiction soon about Severus Snape and the Marauders sooo, yeah.
Ronald Weasly, Harry Potter's best mate, best friend, first friend, had just punched him in the face.
A/N Sorry for not updating for like, 10 months, but today is my birthday! and since I am in a good mood I wanted to update this trash. How is your quarantine going?
"Did you not hear me?" My father asked, I could tell he was getting angry so I spoke up. "S-sorry Father" I said as I took off my clothes, sobbing in the process. "P-Please don't do t-this f-father" I begged, but he just smirked and pressed his body on mine. His hand grabbed my-
Pansy bolted off me and glared daggers at both boys. "MY WHAT!" She shouted at said boys. They both began to talk about the weather and so-on as I still laid on the ground
She then said a few more words that I didn't bother listening to. At the end, she instructed use to sit down at our tables, while she sorted the first year.
"We have to find her. We need her to know we support her, or him, or them?" Pansy said standing up. We all nod and get up, looking in every corner and compartment and even in the washrooms.
"It's a thing a group of muggles started. They came up with an idea to help with people who self harm. Let me finish," I add quickly when I notice the blonde opening his mouth. "Instead of cutting, you draw a butterfly on where ever you cut, and name it after someone you love." I continue, hearing a small 'oh' from the boy next to me. I reach into my pocket and grab a purple marker I had left in there a few days ago, and ask him "Do you want to try it out?"
Alex came only a few minutes before the Hogwarts express came to a stop. They had arrived at Hogwarts. We all got up and retrieved our bags, when we ran into the golden trio. Well, technically the weasel ran into me.
"Oh, I'm sorry!" She giggled "My name is Alexandra, but you can call me Alex! And... you are?" Harry looked at Ron, Hermione and Ginny. Is this girl serious? By now any other girl would freak and ask if I was single or if I 'looking for a hot girl to shag' Harry though. "Hello Alex. My name is Hermione Grange, this is Ron Weasly, Ginny Weasly... and this is Harry Potter.." Hermione said "Well, it was really ni-" She was interrupted by a familiar voice yell.
"Guys, I don't think we should do this'' The hufflepuff boy stuttered. The girl glared at him, "Shut up Austin! Stop being a pussy, the slimy death eater deserves it." she hissed. I focused my attention back on the guy pinning me to the wall. He looked me up and down, licking his lips.
"Haha very funny! How do you even know who Pablo Picasso is? He is a muggle painter" I looked up at him questionably, finishing up the drawing. Malfoy just raises his eyebrow and states bluntly "He was a wizard, not a muggle. Have you been listening to anything in our Histories of Magic class?" I feel my face heat up in embarrassment as I roll my eyes.
Potter stared at me in sadness and pity. "Malfoy.." he whispered, "God Potter, it's just a joke." I noticed Granger giving me a look that meant she did not believe a single word I was saying. I scoffed, "It's so people feel bad for me, pity me!" I said trying my best to sound believable.
Father looks at me, and I can tell he is mad that I took to long to get ready."Narcissa, take Alex outside and get ready to apparat Draco and yourselves to the platform." Father said curtly. Even though father had gotten out of Azkaban, he was under house arrest for another month. And since he's on house arrest, we are not allowed to use magic inside the house.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy! If you don't get you fat ass over here, you will be late!" Father bellowed. He had recently gotten out of Azkaban, because Father convinced on of the guards to give him his wand back, and he used the Imperio curse on the ministry and got them to shorten his life sentence to only one month. Don't ask me how he got away with it, I am still trying to figure that out.
As soon as my friends and I walked into the Great Hall, I could feel multiple pairs of eyes watching my every move. I looked down and suddenly found the cracks in the floor mesmerizing. Everyone stayed by the doors as McGonagall spoke. "Welcome back to another year at Hogwarts, School of Witchcraft And Wizardry. As you know, we had to have the school rebuilt after-"
I was brought back to reality when I felt weight on my chest. I look down only to see Malfoy repeatedly banging his head on my chest. "Are, are you ok?" he stops what he is doing and slowly looks up at me. I mentally slap myself in the face, 'of course he's not ok, he was almost raped'
"Anyway, take a seat Potter. Like I said before, we have important matters to discuss." I nodded and sat down on one of the chairs in front of her desk. "Recently, a student has reached out to me and shared their concerns for the new school year. She was scared that the occupants of the other houses were going to...act out... so to speak, and hurt some of the Slytherins. I wholeheartedly agreed with the young woman, which is why I am asking you, as not only the chosen one, but a brave gryffindor."
"Are you ok Dragon?" My mother asked. " I'm fine maman, I promise" I said, even though I knew it was a lie. I look at the letter that still lays in my mothers hands. "Whats that for?" I asked my Alex. She looked back at the letter and smiled, "It's a note from Headmistress McGonagall. She sent it to me asking if I could inform all the eighth year students of the new conditions at Hogwarts." She answered, taking it out of my mothers hand. "She only chose me because I sent her an owl a few days ago." She said, answering the question I had yet to ask.
"Well, when your done with.." I waved my hand at them "..this, get back to the compartment, we want to talk to you about how we are going to celebrate...you now." I said turning around "Ok see you later Dray, love you" Alex said smiling "Love you too" I mumbled as I walked away from the compartment.
As we walked around the station, I heard a yell from behind me. "DRAY!!" I turned around to see my friend Pansy Parkinson running to me. "PANSY NO!" I yelled as she tackled me to the dirty and hard cement ground. I tried to pry her off of me, but stopped as I heard laughing. I looked up to see Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini and my sister all laughing. I was sure my mother would have been laughing as well, but she had already left to take care of Lucius.
Harry snapped back to reality as the Hogwarts express came to a stop. They had arrived at Hogwarts. As the four got up and retrived their bags they ran into, none other than, Draco Malfoy himself.
People are also saying that they are going to go out and rape, murder and threaten people who are part of the community.
Ron looked at Hermione with a mixture of anger and pure confusion. "What!?! Why are taking that disgusting death-eaters side?" Ron gestured to the compartment door. Hermione sighed , "I am not taking any bodies side Ronald! Alex seems like a really nice girl, and if she loves Malfoy enough to stand up for him, then he must be worth it. Right? And also...you saw him guys, he looked tired..and, the scars?And when I talked to Pansy, she called him a 'broken boy' and after what Alex said, I think something is seriously wrong with him!" Hermione said looking at us with a sad expression. Harry and Ginny nodded and looked at each other.
I spotted Ron and Hermione and started to walk towards them, still looking around. "Harry! There you are! Where were you after dinner? The professors are going to take us to our new dorm rooms!" Hermione rambled on and on about how exited she was about the new dorms. I tried my best to listen, but my mind just kept think about what had happened in the bathroom.
Draco Malfoy's sleeve was rolled up, and you could see old dried scares, along with fresh red ones. Draco Lucius Malfoy, Harry Potters crush ever since 1st year, was cutting himself....
Granger and Ginerva were also yelling at Weasly and telling him to leave me alone. They were all yelling at him, that is, until they heard Alex screaming. Everyone gasped...
When we're about 10 minutes away from Hogwarts, Ali got up with the note that McGonagall had sent her. "Guys," she started, closing her eyes "I have something to tell you. I-I'mtransgenderanditisdefinitelynotaphasenoraproblem." She said quickly and then ran out of the compartment. We all look at each other, astonished. I had not known she was trans. Yeah, we all knew she was questioning her gender and or sexuality, but...
When I got back to the compartment I was original in, I opened the door to three worried Slytherins. "Did you find her? Is she ok? Does she think we don't want to be friends with her because of her gender, because we are fine with it, right? We're all fine with it, yeah, she should know that!" Pansy said frantically waving her arms around, gesturing to everyone. "She is fine Pans. She was just talking to some...friends..." I say, sitting down between Theodore and Blaise, in front of Pansy. Pansy let out a sigh in relief and we continue to talk about everything, and nothing at the same time.
"DRAY! DRACO MALFOY, I MIGHT BE A WOMAN BUT I WILL NOT HESITATE TO WALK MY FINE ASS IN THERE IF YOU DON'T COME OUT HERE!" A shrill voice shrieked causing the both of us to jump away from each other. "COMING PANSY!!" Draco yelled back as he tried to fix his sleeves. When he finished, he looked back up to me and nodded a goodbye. We both stood up and walked outside the bathroom. There was a long line of the 8th years who seemed to be waiting for something or someone.
In a desperate need to change the subject I ask, "Do you know who's name you want me to write down?" We both look down at his arm for a few seconds before Draco responds with a quiet "My mother, Narcissa. I want her name down" I smile gently at him and nod, writing down her name as neatly as possible.
Harry started to blush madly as Ginny and Hermione smirked and wiggled their eyebrows at him. Hermione and Ginny were the only ones who knew about Harry's big crush on Draco Malfoy. That, along with Ginny being lesbian, (I am making Linny a thing no mater what (:<)was the reason him and Gin broke up. Of course Harry and Ginny didn't tell Ron about them liking the same gender. I mean, when Harry told Ron him and Ginny broke up, Harry ended up with a black eye.
Please tell me what you think about the story so far, I would love to hear your opinions! Sorry for any spelling/grammar errors. I hopefully will get another chapter in by Friday, because of school and homework.
There were already multiple cuts on my arms, a few on my thighs, and one or two on my sides. I started doing this to myself ever since I got my Hogwarts letter. Yup, you heard it right here, I suffer from depression, anxiety, anorexia (Eating disorder) and I am addicted to muggle drugs and drinking. I remember the day all the depression started...
"Snape!? But! I-you! You died!" I yelled. Snape just rolled his eyes, and before he could respond McGonagall did it for him. "Not even death can get him out of this friendship Mister Potter." 'Friendship?' I thought. "Yes Potter, unfortunately I am alive. Minerva just wont let me get rest, no matter here or in the underworld. I already gave you your 15 galleons from our last bet, let me rest after my dramatic death oh my god." Snape added bluntly, though, I'm sure the last part was meant for McGonagall not me.
"I told you Potter, it was for attention not a real thing. So drop it!" Draco hissed, pulling his arms around him tighter. We sit there for a couple of minutes in awkward silence. "Do you, have you ever heard of the butterfly project?" I ask suddenly, turning to look at him. If I hadn't been look at him at that exact second, I would have missed the small head shaking 'no.'
" YOU BROKE UP WITH MY SISTER!! NO WONDER SHE SHOWED UP TO BREAKFAST LATE!" Ron stood up and yelled at Harry in the Great Hall. Harry had just told Ron that he and Ginny were done with each other, they (Ginny and Harry) had already told Hermione, because...well, she already knew that they were gay.
When he opened the door, he saw a girl about his age, with platinum blonde hair, light blue-grey like eyes, she was also wearing a white sweater with a very detailed dragon on it, and blue skinny jeans. She reminded Harry of someone, but he couldn't figure out who.
"We should go. You both have your muggle phones and computers right?" Mother asked. When father was in Azkaban, mother was teaching us how to use muggle devices since the ministry found a way to mix magic and technology. She also taught Pansy, Theo and Blaise and bought them each a phone and laptop.
"I'm sorry Father, I'm coming now." I said as I pulled my sleeve down. I then ran down the stairs with my shrunken luggage. I see my younger sister Alex, mother and father at the door. Yes I have a sister, my mother and I thought if no one knew that I had a sister she would be safer, especially after what happened with my younger brother...
"Ally! There you are! The gang and I were looking for you every where!" The boy came into veiw, he was wearing a green hood,black beanie and black ripped jeans. Then...it hit Harry like a load of bricks. Draco Malfoy... Alex looks like Malfoy! "You can't just get up and leave right after you tell use that you are tr... Why are you with them?" Draco asked looking at the four students sitting in the compartment "No reason Dray" She smiled at him "And I'm fine, I knew you guys would be fine with it." She looked at us when she said 'it'
"Oi, watch where you're going next time ferret!" The weasel barked. I then muttered "Not my fault, you bumped me.." Which seemed to make him furious! As we continued to walk, I felt someone grab my arm and pulled me back. "Merde, pas maintenant. Lâche-moi fouine" (Shit, not now. Let me go weasel) I winced at the pressure Weasly was applying on my fresh cuts I made this morning, which only made Weasel's grip tighten around my wrist.  I noticed Pansy turn around and she got Theo's, Blaise's and Alex's attention  and tried to push Weasly away from me.
(Draco is 10 years old, so he didn't get his Hogwarts letter yet. Also RAPE AND ABUSE COMING UP!!!!!)
"ALRIGHT STUDENTS! MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE!" McGonagall called out in her usual loud teacher voice.
Finally, after looking for about 5 minutes, I found her outside a compartment talking to a group of people. I didn't give much thought to the people in the compartment. I raced toward her and yelled "Ali! There you are! The gang and I were looking for you every where!" I started running to the compartment. "You can't just get up and leave right after you tell use that you are tr... Why are you with them?" I say noticing that I knew the people inside the compartment. Inside, was Harry Potter, Weasley, Ginny Weasley and Hermione Granger. I saw Granger, Potter and Ginerva all star at my neck. I knew the only reason they would do that was if they saw the cuts and bruises covering my skin.
"He didn't have a choice--" Harry continued to argue. He doesn't have any idea what Ron and Hermione are trying to say here. "Voldemort was going to kill his family if he didn't do it. And I told you that he lowered his wand that night. I know for a fact that he doesn't want to kill Dumbledore. I was there."
Claudette's brows furrowed a bit, probably confused as to why the man in front of her is so keen to talk to the higher ups. Harry – getting  the feeling that the receptionist is about to drill him with twenty questions – waved his hand to cast a wandless and non-verbal Confundus charm. He wasn't an expert at such manner of spellwork so the effects of the spell are much more mild than if he were to cast it with a wand. Luckily, the mildness was perfect to disorient Claudette, making her vulnerable to suggestions and persuasions.
If he's being perfectly honest with himself, nothing much is keeping him from resigning from his position and quitting the Auror force altogether. He's only keeping his job because it's what is expected of him, he doesn't really know what to do with his life otherwise, and he's still as determined as ever to track down Draco Malfoy, wherever that git is.
Once again, the letter bore a stamp on the lower right portion of the paper. Harry brought the paper to his face to inspect it closer. It looks like only two flowers made up the illustration: a familiar looking one with large petals and small little ones that might be baby's breath flowers. Harry knows that he's reaching too far into this but he couldn't help but be entranced by the large flowers that made up
Harry stayed up all night to finish the rough draft of his next book. He went through several cups of coffee along with a handful of Pepper up potion vials. Writing was such an ordeal but he got through it with his sanity still in tact. After a short nap, Harry picked up his manuscript and headed to Malfoy's flat via floo.
Harry thought that they were heading back to the blond's house but, instead, they went towards the square. Adhil was swift on his feet and Harry couldn't help but think that if he wasn't an Auror, he would definitely have a difficult time catching up to the Potions Master.
"I don't know. They wouldn't tell us. Confidentiality clauses and all that bull. But if you ask me, I don't really care. We're just glad to have cousin Martina back at her feet."
After jotting down their observations, Harry went back to Grimmauld Place to get ready for dinner at the Parkinson-Lovegood residence. His wedding-slash-housewarming gift for the newlyweds sat on the coffee table in the living room, ready to be picked up before he leaves. The couple refused to accept any gifts immediately after the wedding because they would be off to their honeymoon and wouldn't have time to sort through them. Instead, they told their friends to bring their gifts when they return or to send it to them via owl post.
Finally, Harry flipped to the last document that Parkinson sent him. It was mostly blank with only a single paragraph on it along with the necessary headings, signatures, and stamps that make legal whatever is written on the parchment.
"It's the same symbol. I'm sure of it. I know that this is from Dra-- Malfoy. Here, I'll show you." He insisted, taking out his wand and performing a spell different from the curse detection spell that he performed earlier. This time, it's a spell that exposes any magical signature left on an object. Harry stared at the item that he's holding, waiting for Draco's distinct magical signature to emerge. The room was quiet as everyone held their breaths, waiting. However, after a few moments, nothing happened. Harry's brows furrowed in confusion. He expected the object to have leftover magic on it considering the way the pouch seemed to materialize out of nowhere.
"Say," Harry called out just as Joseph was about to walk away. His voice adopted the same low, grumbling tone of the Swedish tourist that they nicked the hairs from. "My friend and I are wondering if you can suggest some really awesome sightseeing spots? We just got here a few days ago and have already exhausted most of the museums."
"Was." Harry clarified. The blond was done looking at the snow globe judging by how he set it back on the mantlepiece. "He was a Death Eater, yes. But he wasn't really convicted. Only put on probation. He didn't deserve to be locked up in Azkaban."
"I imagine the Unspeakables will have some kind of device like that. Have you tried asking Hermione?"
After that, they were all dismissed. The Aurors and other personnel from the DMAC filed out of the conference room. Harry and Ron followed suit. However, instead of going back to their offices, the two of them headed to Weasley's Wizard Wheezes
"Dark magic." Ron said simply, his face scrunched up in disgust as the substance started to spread on the table. Harry feared that it would try to touch everyone but it seemed to have hit an invisible barrier. Instead of continuously spreading, its edges crawled upwards. When it sensed that it couldn't reach any further, it started pounding on the invisible barrier. With another swish of his wand, Robards vanished the traces of dark magic.
"Good morning, Sir," Auror Felicity Thimble greeted him a little nervously. She's one of the Aurors that Harry assigned to help him with The Missing Wizards case. She and Grunhild are fairly new. They've been in the task force for just a little over three years but they're both talented and trustworthy. Not to mention they can get the job done as soon as humanly possible. "I'm sorry to call you this early but Daisy and I have just finished the reports on The Crystal's staff. You said that the case is time sensitive so any and all discoveries should be reported immediately. May we come through?"
You have suffered alone enough. Your friends have moved on from the war, they too have redeemed themselves. If what Ms. Parkinson said is to be believed, they are now friends with those Gryffindor brats which means the Wizarding World likely doesn't treat them like dirty anymore.
Looking back at the conversation, Harry felt a bit ridiculous. He sighed as he stared at the ceiling of his bedroom, unable to sleep despite having a happy and satisfied stomach. He can count on one hand the number of times he has spoken to Malfoy since the war. It was never a friendly meeting, nor was it an unfriendly one. They merely nod at each other in acknowledgement whenever they meet at the Ministry. The last time Harry had a semblance of a conversation with Malfoy was after he testified for him during the trials.
"The thing is," Grunhild continued. "Their records have been clean since then. They've been good citizens and it seems like they moved here to start a new life. Not to mention, their immigration papers are all in order."
"The other week, I asked you the day and time in which you can finish the rough draft of your manuscript," Malfoy said as he began to pace around Harry's office. "You told me that you'll have it ready by Wednesday at 8PM. Imagine my surprise when the clock struck 8 in the evening and yet, my desk stayed empty."
It turns out that all the Malfoy house elves were sent to Hogwarts to help out. All twenty of them. Harry snorted at the note attached to the file about the house elves ("Don't even think about interrogating them. They are bound to secrecy until he dies or orders them to speak himself"). Aside from that Malfoy also transferred a million galleons each into the vaults of Andromeda Tonks and Edward Remus Lupin. He had also re-instated Andromeda back into the Black family, automatically making Tonks and Teddy part of the family tree as well. This brought a wide smile on Harry's face. The past years have been tough seeing as he is technically the only heir of the Black family but now, Andy and Teddy can rebuild and redefine the family's legacy. With their re-instatement, they are also given back their seats at the Wizengamot.  The Black family, being both ancient and noble, held two seats. Both of which will go to Andy until Teddy is of age. The two Malfoy seats in the Wizengamot, on the other hand will naturally go to Parkinson. However, a footnote written at the bottom of the parchment caught Harry's eyes.
He should've expected this. He did intend for this to happen at some point in time but not so soon. It was too soon. And he was alone in Muggle clothes. No Auror partner. No backup.
"I don't think so. Our wards are very secure and no one can get through them unless one of us permits it. Harry was the first one to arrive via Floo and I don't recall seeing this package on the mantlepiece while we were hanging up the portrait. As for owls, the only owl that we've ever received since we got home is the one from my parents, inviting us over for brunch tomorrow."
This other necklace looked quite similar to the one Pansy is holding. However, their sole difference lie in the gem. Whilst Pansy's was a clear-cut, olive-coloured gem, the one on Luna's necklace was of a deep purple shade; an amethyst.
"You persuaded the Wizengamot to not even put any of them on house arrest, which, in my opinion, Malfoy kind of deserved for letting those Death Eaters in during sixth year."
When he reached the kitchen, Malfoy was already sitting in his usual spot, a cup of tea in one hand and the morning edition of The Daily Prophet in the other. Kreacher was busy directing both kitchen and food items around. A plate of scrambled eggs and toast floated in front of him the moment Harry sat down on his chair. The kettle also poured him a steaming cup of tea.
"What's this for?" He asked, making the man beside him jump a little at the proximity of his voice. He was pointing at a small, dark green bottle with a brown label written in French.
"I see…" Neville trailed off, looking thoughtful. "I've been trying different things to keep pests away from my plants but insectides are usually either too weak or too toxic. I tried making my own batch of insectides but it's quite time consumming. Besides, it will be better to catch the insects. Maybe some of them are potions ingredient worthy."
"As for the rest of you, I'm dividing you into three teams. One team will patrol South Kensington, either under a Disillusionment charm or a disguise to not arouse suspicion just in case our unsub resides in the area. The second team will further investigate the places in which the victims were last seen. Report back any and all findings that you may have that may help us in figuring out who the next victim will be or who the criminal is. Finally, the third team will focus on the remaining open cases that we have. Let me know if you need assistance on the more classified ones."
"Oh-- I think I know who you're talking about," Julia replied. "I've seen her here a few times. She comes at around 5pm and leaves just before closing. She usually looks prim and polished… must be having a bad day. I should really get back to work."
"I'm sorry to hear about your aunt's condition," The receptionist – Celeste, according to the name tag attached on her uniform – said with a sympathetic expression before getting a small stack of papers. "But, you've come to the right place. These are the information pamphlets to know more about our program as well as the forms that you need to fill out for it, along with the list of documents that you need to submit to qualify. It's mostly experimental and for research so we do not guarantee full recovery but so far we have a 95% success rate with our patients."
"Harry!" The cheerful voice of a child greeted him as he arrived at the garden. A flash of turquoise was all he saw before he found himself ambushed by a small figure. The face of his godson, Teddy looked up at him with a bright smile as he hugged his godfather tightly as if they hadn't just seen each other last night at dinner. "You're here! And right on time! Auntie Mione said that you would probably be late again--"
"Isn't that good though? The more time you spend with the creatures, the better you'll get to know them."
"Sir, I would have to ask you to leave the premises if you don't stop harassing our staff." He threatened, his hold onto the man's arm turning into a firmer grip by the second until Harry could see the discomfort slide into the man's features. After a few moments of trying to endure the pain brought by the bartender's grip, the man finally let go of the waitress' arm. Her co-worker immediately went to her side to console her.
Harry shrugged picked up his drink before sitting back and drinking from it. The two of them are now face-to-face, just watching each other. Harry took this opportunity to study the other man's face. Despite his rational mind already knowing the truth, he still couldn't place Draco's name on Adhil's face. He basically has to drill into his brain that yes, Adhil and Draco are the same person. He has to believe it. He finds himself doubting that belief even as he looks at Adhil but he only has to glance down at the Masidec's light blue glow re-affirm those doubts.
"This one is addressed to you." Parkinson clarified. "I don't know what business you have with Draco for you to warrant a letter but then again, we are yet to find out why hippogriffs fly."
"The teaching position at Hogwarts." Harry clarified. "You should take it. It'll be good for you. I'll be fine…Maybe Luna can look over my manuscripts in the meantime while I'm looking for a different editor. But…you should take it. I know how much you love Potions."
Seeing as the investigation of the Manor is still under works, the trio's conversation soon moved into the topic of Parkinson's memory.
"Exactly." Hermione was the one who spoke this time. She let out a sigh before speaking tensely. "And there's something else too… We checked the last few spells performed on the wand. One of them was Fiendfyre...and the other one before that is the Killing Curse."
"You always say that, Potter." Malfoy dismissed his brattiness. "Come. I asked Kreacher to prepare breakfast. Your tea is waiting, Your Specky Highness."
The goblin was right. Despite the thickness of the folder, it held nothing more than basic bank statements. Something that the goblins are allowed to show any Ministry official that asks for it. Anything beyond that would require permission from the member of the family, their solicitor, or their chosen heir. However, they still contained information that Harry found useful.
Well, if it isn't Draco's weakness: Harry Potter kindheartedness and his desire to give so much to those he loves.
Harry was being put off by all of these questions. He was the Auror here. He was supposed to be the one to ask the questions, not answer them. And yet, he couldn't help but speak his mind.
"That's what Muggle technology is about, isn't it?" Adhil replied, setting his notepad down on the counter by the till. It seems like he was done with what he was doing. "To make people's lives better? What's the use of inventing new novelty potions if we can improve what's already in our roster?"
Apparently, Malfoy did more than just take money and transfer the rest to Parkinson. He did so much more than that and, as much as Harry believes that no amount of money can make up for the mistakes of the past, he truly appreciates the thought behind them.
Back then, those eyes looked at Harry with a mixture of recognition and fear. This time, he wants to be looked at in an entirely different way.
"You reckon we can bribe Emilia for the recipe?" Harry pondered after they've both read Hermione's letter. "Or should we just bring them tins of cookies?"
"We were young." He replied then stayed silent for a few moments before taking a deep breath. "We were only children during the war. Our actions were fueled by the desire to save ourselves and those we care about. It just so happens that Draco Malfoy got the short end of the stick and he had to be a Death Eater to ensure his and his family's safety.
"True," Harry mumbled under his breath as he remembered that specific case. "Who would've thought that an old woman would be behind a series of robberies…and for no particular reason except to fulfill a bucketlist."
Harry only nodded. He knew about this. The Cell Cleansing Potion is something that the patient has to take regularly for a span of two to three months until they are fully healed. The average duration currently stands at three months. It was rare for someone to recover at the two month mark. Looking back at the conversation that he heard in the pub back in England, it was the very first time that someone has recovered in just six weeks. Harry still isn't as well-versed in Potions as he would like to be but he knew that while the Cell Cleansing Potion is quite common in terms of brewing method and ingredients, the components itself are volatile and are extremely tricky to play around with. He remembers a conversation that he had with Hermione wherein they talked about how altering the ingredients of the potion – or even just changing its state or composition – can turn it into a poison as potent as a Black Mamba's venom.
"Could be," Hermione nodded, although her face held an expression that says that she's not at all fond of house-elves being used for errands like these. "He can still summon them anytime right? From what I've heard, Malfoy didn't set any of them free."
Before Harry could think further about it, Julia arrived with their order of a basket of fish and chips and two burgers.
Draco doesn't say anything. He just sighs. This is how Severus knew that he has finally won their argument that has been going on for a long time now. The blond just slumps on the arm chair, seemingly exhausted.
"What's that thing on your chest anyway?" Adhil asked, breaking the silence between them. "It has been glowing for quite some time now. Is it going to explode?"
A few minutes into their meal, Harry and Ron heard a rumbustious laugh from the nearby table. They turned their heads to see a red-faced man gripping one of the waitresses by the wrist in an attempt to pull her onto his lap. The waitress was struggling against the man's grip while looking around for help with alarmed eyes. This seemed to be a common occurence in the pub, judging by the look on the other patrons' faces. Some of them only looked at the scene in amusement before tucking back into their meals. All the while, the waitress was still trying to pry herself from the man's firm grip. Ron was just about to stand up and intervene when the other waitress rushed to her co-worker's side.
"I know this box…" Pansy whispered, more to herself than to the others as she inspected the wooden box. From afar, it looked quite plain but if one looks closely, they will see intricate figures faintly painted all over it. The figures were that of different breeds of dragons. From the Chinese Fireball to the Peruvian Vipertooth. However, amongst all of these legendary beasts adorning the box, two stand out the most. While the other dragons were painted small, their illustrations taking up not more than half of a chocolate frog card, the two dragons in the middle seem to occupy most of the lid's area. Pansy frowned as she stared at the snoring figures of a Hungarian Horntail and an Antipodean Opaleye curled up together. She knew what these breeds were because Draco told her about it. Otherwise, she would be clueless due to the fact that these dragons were painted in the same rusted gold ink like the others. They didn't really stand out from the maroon lacquer of the box itself.
Now that it was confirmed that there is indeed magic at play in this hospital, Harry came to an interesting assumption. It seems like wizards and muggles are working together in this establishment in order to treat muggles from ailments that are usually deadly to them. He's still not sure whether or not the operations of this facility is legal but it seems like it is. It's quite difficult to hide illegal facilities in the middle of the city.
In the end, Pansy insisted that they not look deeper into it and they all agreed to let the matter go for the time being seeing as nothing bad happened. It seems like Draco's one and only goal is to deliver Pansy and Luna's wedding present. They all hung out for a few more hours before they all started to leave one-by-one. Daphne and Millicent were the first to go home despite being the last ones to arrive. "Parenthood" Blaise has said with a shrug as they watched the two of them leave. Neville and Ginny were next, saying that they have classes in the morning. They were followed by Ron and Hermione and finally Blaise who winked at the newlywed couple and wished them luck on using his gift. Pansy merely rolled her eyes while Luna laughed.
Malfoy left letters for two people only. Two. For Parkinson, his best friend. And for Harry, his school nemesis. The same Harry that he shared a mutual hatred with for years. The same Harry that he saved in the Manor and who also saved him in return. The same Harry who he helped by throwing his wand, allowing him to, once and for, all defeat the madman who tormented the entire wizarding world for years. Malfoy could've left a letter for Zabini or even Luna. But, he chose Harry. That, in itself, made Harry more than just a little bit determined to find Malfoy and bring him home.
Harry remembered the letter. Malfoy wrote that he would rather die than live another day as himself. He would rather die than bear the name of Malfoy any longer.
"We should go visit a Sqatoo's nest with this next time, darling!" Luna exclaimed excitedly. "Thank you, Blaise."
At around 5PM, Harry travelled via Floo to Pansy and Luna's home with his gift and a bottle of Goblin-made sherry from the 1940s.
"There's only one problem though," Harry said thoughtfully, trying to focus on the task at hand and not at what's slowly creeping into his conscious. "Not a shred of the victims' magical signatures were found during the investigation. There's no signature pointing to the culprit either. The unsub has deliberately wiped their tracks and with utmost care as well."
This time, Harry didn't forget about the Masidec. It now hung on his neck, the cool pendant resting against his warm chest. He didn't want it to be exposed too much because it was still quite fragile so he resorted to keeping it inside his shirt. Its usual hollowed crystal was now filled with what little of Draco's magical signature Harry could extract from the box that Luna gave him. It was so faint that he has a theory that its glow might almost be unnoticeable to the naked eye. He would probably have to be a lot closer  for the Masidec to detect the owner of the magic that it has encapsulated.
It feels like an overexaggeration but Harry felt the world stop when those grey eyes finally looked back at him. They were more beautiful than he remembered them to be.
"Yeah. But Luna often goes away for long periods of time." Harry said, sounding skeptical and a bit nervous. "Her trips can take up to six months."
You are still young, Draco. You've already redeemed yourself. How many medicinal breakthroughs have you had that aided in the treatment of hundreds, if not thousands, of Muggles?
Thankfully, Harry seemed to comprehend what he said. His mouth opened slightly, just enough for Adhil to pour in the potion.
"Auror Potter," Robards greeted him back from the far end of the room. With a nod of his head, he gestured for Harry to sit down on the remaining seat beside Ron. Robards then turned to address everyone in the room. "I apologize for calling you all at this hour but I am sure that you understand the need to locate the victims and apprehend the criminal. We are running out of time and, if our observations are correct, we only have five days before another wizard gets abducted.
"I would need a copy of that, Ms. Parkinson. I would also need a copy of Malfoy's latest bank statements and any receipt that you can find."
Harry got back to the inn in Lyon in one piece. The blinding headache exhausted him but once he stepped out of the shop and into the open air, the throbbing significantly decreased until it fully disappeared. He walked further along the streets of "
The rest of the group exchanged pleasantries with the newcomers, kissing each other's cheeks, clapping each other's back, and, most importantly, handing over their gifts to the newlyweds. These gifts were set on the coffee table in the living room for them to open together after dinner.
"Hmm?" His boyfriend said around another mouthful of biscuits, looking up from the stack of papers that he was going through.
"I think that you want to be found…" the Auror clarified. "For five years, none of us heard from you but then your gift suddenly appeared out of nowhere."
Adhil…or Draco stared at Harry for a long time after the latter's outburst. He was beginning to wonder if the blond even heard what he said but before he can speak, Draco…or Adhil abruptly stood up.
It was an entire arm, from shoulder to hand, rotting and greyish. Its palm was bent backwards at an angle that would be impossible for a living human to achieve. Its fingertips were turning black, the colour starting to spread althroughout the hand. It seems like the preservation charms didn't do their work after all judging by state of decay that the arm was currently in. Harry can handle images of greying flesh but what made him uneasy was the way that the arm seemed to have been separated from the rest of the body. The cutting spells that he knew made swift clean cuts similar to how those machines work in the deli shop. However, the arm in the picture looks like it was forcefully torn apart from its joint. The tendons were still jutting out from the end and the skin had an irregular pattern that resembled roughly ripped paper. That alone told Harry that whoever did this, they did it out of pure rage and hatred.
"Again, Potter. Children. I despise being surrounded by gremlins. Might as well perform a cloning charm and multiply you into twenty speckled gits. Same thing." Malfoy shrugged again, before adopting a more serious tone. "I still like Potions but sometimes we have to let go of things that aren't for us."
"Doesn't that mean that I wouldn't even be able to suspect that Draco and Adhil are the same person?"
"Maybe it'll be better if we check the wards just in case?" Ron suggested, getting up from his position on the floor and taking his wand out.
His hand reached up to cup Draco's cheek. The blond immediately stiffened, surprised at the sudden physical contact but he also relaxed once Harry started to caress his cheek with his thumb.
"Me? Well, I…I helped the mother calm down." Harry answered, looking back at the time when he was just beside the mother winged-horse, patting and caressing the side of its body to get her to calm down. "She got so antsy in the middle of it that we were afraid she was going to fly off. But luckily, we managed to calm her down with massages and potpourri."
"Hello, fuckers!" The group heard a familiar voice yell from the receiving area just as they were about to sit down. Pansy and Hermione both rolled their eyes and looked expectantly at the direction from which the voice sounded.
Years of being read, re-read, and analyzed have worn out both the envelope and the paper quite a bit. However, its message was still readable. The wax seal of Draco's letter was still in tact and that is all Harry needs.
"He went to the shop yesterday and I have a feeling that he knows who I am. Well, I think his subconscious does." The blond continued, his mind flashing with images of Harry keeling over in pain. Adhil's hand went to clutch the pendant hanging from his neck. It was his mother's, given to her by Grandmother Druella when she was still just a baby and she passed it on to him when he was born. The pendant was actually a simple round locket. It was silver and had daffodil and vine patterns inscribed on it. Inside, it held a small picture of him with his parents. Adhil rarely opens the locket to look at the picture. Even after all these years, seeing his once happy family still brings a sting to his chest. Besides, it wasn't the picture itself that is important but the enchantments that have been laced through the locket. These enchantments have brought him peace fo five years. Peace that he finds himself willing to risk to have his friends and remaining family back into his life.
Foxy smirked at him. She has no right to complain about Cadigan smirking at her, Castien thought, when that's basically her only facial expression.
“Isn’t it because one needs to account for the particular ingredients of a potion? Porcupine quills are used in the Elixir to Produce Euphoria, and they can be preserved by adding powdered lacewing flies to an Everlasting Elixir. But if you added lacewing flies to a Draught of Living Death, even in an Elixir, the whole thing would blow up.”
Castien cast his gaze around the station but the platform was obscured by the mist. He shrugged, explaining that “it's always easier to meet in our compartment. I’ll see them when I board the train.”
Castien sat sandwiched between Foxy and Gingko at the Slytherin table during the Welcome Feast. The sorting had been good this year, with a decent number of new Slytherins joining them at the table, and food had been, as always, excellent. He sat back rather sleepily as McGonagall stood and walked to the podium for the Headmistress address.
He raised an eyebrow at her and she huffed, “Yeah, she’s annoying. Can’t believe we have to work together again this year, she’s the Ravenclaw captain and don't get me wrong, the girl can fly, but the way she drills evasive maneuvers seems to me-”
“Stay out of the forest unless you have written permission from a professor and an escort.” McGonagall emphasized, and continued,
“Are you excited for your seventh year?” His dad asked, looking over at the Express with a nostalgic expression. Castien grinned. “I’m beyond excited, Dad, I just…”
“That’s not optional!” He intoned rather sternly, but Castien saw the amusement in his eyes. “Now,” Draco looked around, “where are those troublesome friends of yours?”
“YES FATHER?” Castien shouted back, hoping that maybe, just maybe, if he sounded unconcerned enough, his father would match his mood. The wooden kitchen chair made a grating noise as Castien grabbed it from the breakfast table and dragged it across the tile, positioning it under the fire alarm. He reached up to unscrew it and pop the batteries out as quickly as he could, but - his fingers just grazed the bottom of it. He cursed. Too short.
Class ended with a shuffling of papers and robes and Professor Tally promising to see them at the same time on Wednesday, but only after they had read the chapter on Golpalott’s Third Law, of course. Gingko slapped his shoulder as he gathered his books and made his way out of the classroom ahead of him. Castien looked to Foxglove as she shoved some loose papers in her bag, covered in weird circles and lines and whatever made-up sports stuff helped her win matches. She was staring at Cadigan as she cleaned up her station, chatting with her friend.
Castien has long since decided that waking up at Hogwarts is one of his favorite ways to start his mornings. The Slytherin dorms, which his dad always described as being cold and formal (which he had only seen once during his illegal escapades his second year) had been updated post-war, and Castien found the low, wavy light that filtered in from the lake to be peaceful. He got dressed in his uniform, tying his Slytherin tie loosely around his neck as he grimaced at the morning chill. Nice or not, there was no getting past the chill of living in the dungeons.
Castien shrugged. His father had always been rather overdramatic. He went to the cabinet and brought out the bread to make some toast.
Castien leaned back onto the bench seat and let Foxglove’s voice wash over him. This year would be a good one, he decided, and maybe he and Gingko could push Foxglove into doing something about the crush she clearly had on the Ravenclaw girl.
Hello and thank you so much to everyone who read and left kudos or a comment on my dumb fanfiction!! Ya'll are very sweet and I hope you enjoy this silliness :)
His seventh year allowed him to arrange an independent study, and Castien had spent his summer working towards his post-graduate plans: a magical painting apprenticeship with one of the most renowned portrait artists in Britain.
The Hogwarts Express gleamed in the morning light, the steam which circled the platform catching and refracting the light like a dream. Castien stood with his cart, laden with his trunk, and willed the moment to stay in his memory forever. He felt, behind him, his parents coming up to each place a hand on his shoulders.
Foxglove pushed him on his way out of the compartment and he laughed, dodging her efforts to trip him up all the way to the carriages, which Castien knew were pulled by invisible horses but to him always seemed like pure magic.
“...For your NEWTs this year, we’ll be working towards perfecting a few new potions, such as Amortentia and Felix Felicis, and several Draughts, which you will then preserve with an Everlasting Elixir. It’s essential that the Elixir is brewed to perfection, or your base potion can spoil and you’ll have a hell of a time figuring out which ingredient has gone bad...”
Harry nodded in understanding, packing up his notepad and quill along with the vial of Parkinson's memories.  There's indeed a pensieve in his office. It's necessary for the Investigation Department seeing as their work involves thorough examination of minute details and how they can be connected to each other to solve cases.
Aside from the one placed on the Manor, the monitoring charms and alarms on everything else that's related to the Malfoys are in tact: Draco Malfoy's wand, all of their properties across Europe, the and their numerous vaults.
"No casualties have been reported yet, Auror Potter," His junior informed him. "Auror Weasley is currently investigating the situation along with Unspeakable Granger-Weasley."
"Fucking hell, Malfoy--" He said exasperatedly. "Warn a bloke, will you?  You almost gave me a heart attack!"
The Auror was pulled away from his thoughts of admiring the interior design when a cup of tea was placed in front of him. He muttered a quick thanks to Adhil and proceeded to add two sugars in his tea along with a splash of milk. He hummed at the first sip of the hot beverage. It tasted perfect. Just like how he made it back home.
"The Vanishing spell can be a possible base for a more complex spell." Blaise said from his seat, breaking his own silence. He looked pensive, holding the glass of wine in his hand and staring at the fire flickering in the fireplace.
A little while later, Harry and Draco sat in front of each other in the latter's kitchen with cups of tea on the table in front of them. The way that they faced each other was quite similar to when Harry first went here but it also felt more intimate.
"If Draco doesn't want to be found, you won't find him but still…" She said, her face painted with a tired smile. "Thank you for trying."
"This," Harry gestured to the shelves of potions. "Improving potions. Making them more effective. I thought that you would be making your own potions but you're taking what's already there and making them better."
"You want to be a Magizoologist?" Draco clarified, blinking away the last remnants of sleep. "That's great, Harry."
"Harry! Ron! Good to see you!" Angelina greeted them back with a bright smile. "George is at the back working on the You-Know-What."
"I'm Healer Vartan," They introduced themselves. "I understand that you have some questions for me. I would suggest a more formal venue like my office but, seeing as I am yet to have my first meal of the day, the department's break room would suffice, yes?"
Harry knew that he wasn't particularly powerful. His mind flashed back to the final battle between him and Voldemort. He admits that their connection helped in the latter's defeat but it ultimately comes down to Malfoy. Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore in the Astronomy tower back in sixth year, switching the loyalty of the Elder wand to him. Harry took Malfoy's wand in the Manor. Malfoy took it back while they were in the Room of Requirement. Finally, Malfoy tossed his wand to Harry during the final battle, switching back the allegiance of the Elder wand to him which allowed him to survive the duel with Voldemort and to come out triumphant. The Elder wand cannot harm the person to which it is allied to. If Harry had used Hermione's wand, for example, there's no telling what the outcome of the battle could have been.
Harry took Ron's absence as an opportunity to look around at the patrons in the pub. He picked up the pint of beer that was set in front of him and drank from it, his eyes peering from the rim of the glass as he carefully scanned the place.
," Adhil said once he has gotten over the shock of Harry appearing right beside him. His voice was like velvet and the foreign language rolled off elegantly from his tongue. It almost made Harry blush. "Dittany. Well, a more concentrated and effective formula of it atleast. A small drop can recover an entire leg's worth of flesh and skin in just four hours."
"Is it…a mailing stamp?" Pansy inquired with genuine confusion in her eyes as she picked up the small image and held it up. It looked like a mailing stamp but instead of paper, the image was printed on a tiny canvass enclosed in a wooden frame.
George stepped back from the working table so that the three of them can look at it more comfortably.
I may have lied? Or atleast underestimated my own fic. I thought that I could fit the ending in one chapter but, alas, I couldn't.
"We got a report at around 6AM of a panicked employee at a Muggle convenience store about how his table was doing odd things and that he might be hallucinating." The blue-haired man narrated. "According to the Muggle, the table upon which his radio was sitting on started to turn an strange shade of green and emit a truly repelling odour. We have sent Obliviators along with the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad on-site. They have confirmed that the said table is behaving in an unnatural way and that the stench was enough to send people running for miles in the opposite direction.
"This is a Magical Signature Detecting device. The Masidec for short," Harry explained, ignoring the snort that came from Adhil. "Couldn't we have picked a better name? Sure. But functionality won over creativity. And this little thing is why I'm here, right in front of you, Adhil or perhaps I should call you Draco?"
Pansy chuckled and patted his back. He was just about to leave when Luna called his name and pushed the golden pouch containing one of the boxes into his hand. Harry looked at her, mildly shocked and confused. Pansy raised an eyebrow at her wife.
"Yes, sir," Ron said, trying not to sound sick as Charles unwrapped the paper containing the severed arm. "It's a magical signature detecting device. For now, it can only store a person's magical signature. My brother and I are still tweaking it so that it'll give off a signal once the owner of that signature uses magic nearby. Of course, it cannot be used if the witch or wizard masks their signature."
"Potpourri?" Draco asked, tone filled with amusement as he continued to go through their mail. Harry could almost hear the smile on his face.
"Make yourself comfortable." Vartan said as they went over to the fridge and took out a container of what seemed to be Chinese takeout. They popped it in the microwave and turned back to Harry who was now sitting on one of the dining chairs. "Now, Mr. Potter, what brings you to our hospital?"
This limb was once Pollux Grimbleton's left leg. It was in a similar state as Quinn's arm. As expected, the abundance of electricity and radiowaves disrupted the magic and so it started to revert back to its original state.
"I'll see you tomorrow….prat." He teased. He felt rather than saw Malfoy roll his eyes. Harry chuckled and made to walk out. He stopped by the doorway and turned to face Malfoy who was just about to reach for the Dairy Milk bar. "You should take it, you know."
"Are you sure about this though, Harry?" Hermione's face was painted with clear concern and so was Ron's. Harry looked at them in confusion.
The Auror office was left befuddled. They had no leads, no evidences. The victims had nothing in common aside from their genders and that they all went missing in South Kensington. They couldn't really focus on The Crystal since only a portion of the victims have been in the establishment. Acknowledging the fact that they have reached a temporary dead end, the Auror office have assigned some of their workforce to patrol the area of South Kensington in hopes of preventing any new disappearances. This course of action worked for the most part. Although the Aurors were exhausted due to the strict patrol shifting that added to their already heavy workload, no one went missing in the days that followed. Even Muggles felt the presence of the authorities since Robards coordinated with the Muggle Police to set up patrols as well. However, if one would ask any of the Aurors on-duty, they want nothing more than to catch whoever the culprit is so that they can go back to their regular work schedules.

"Wicked, am I right?" He heard George say. Harry went over to look at what the elder Weasley brother is working at. When Ron first mentioned that he and George were starting this little project for the Department of Mysteries, Harry assumed that the "device" would look like an actual device like a radio, a phone, or even a compass. Instead, he was presented with what looked like an amulet. A hollow looking crystal sphere rested in the middle of a silver plate with its edges inscribed with runes. The amulet itself hung from a black waxed cotton cord.
His mouth suddenly became dry that he head to swallow and clear his throat before attempting to speak but even then he doesn't know what to say. He held up the item towards his face to further examine the tag on it. The pouch only had a small brown tag attached to it. It had no name nor signature. It only had an image, a drawing of a flower. It's a flower so familiar to Harry for he spent the last five years staring at a copy of it imprinted on a wax seal.
Adhil was in his potions lab, stirring the final batch of Better Pepper-Up Potion included in this week's order when several knocks that reverberated throughout his house disturbed him.
"Then don't." Draco said, looking at him straight in the eye. "At the end of the day, it all comes down to you and your decision. You have to stop letting expectations dictate your life, Potter. You'll be happier. Start doing whatever the fuck you want to do. At this time, take a page out of MY books."
A week after that, another missing case was reported. This time, it was someone working in the Ministry. Michael Quinn, 22, a trainee Hit Wizard. Several days passed before he was reported missing. He often skipped training for a day or two but when four days passed and he was yet to be heard from, one of his friends decided to visit his flat only to find it empty. He lived alone and mostly kept to himself when he's at home so his neighbours have no idea where he could be. He was last scene at the Leaky Cauldron, after a night out with his fellow trainees. Not a single soul has seen him after that.
As if on cue, Ron let out a huge yawn. He has been on night patrols for the past week. That along with making sure the Masidec works is bound to take a toll on him.
"Oh, wait." Harry said before taking out his wand and tapping it on the item in Pansy's hand. Slowly, the image started to expand until it reverted back to its original size. Pansy now held a portrait in her hands and Harry smiled at their awed reactions.
"Yeah," Ron agreed. "A witch and a wizard working in a place where two of our victims often go to. Maybe we should do a stakeout, either at The Crystal or at their house."
Harry, Andy, and Teddy were led to their seats by who Harry recognized as Daphne Greengrass-Bulstrode. Her wife was probably with Pansy to help her get ready. He spotted Ron and Hermione who were already sat down as well as Neville, George, Angelina, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Fleur, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, and a couple more of their fellow Hogwarts alumni along with other people that he didn't recognize. Perhaps, they were friends of the other bride from her travels.
Pansy sighed and went back to the  papers in front of her. She loves Draco like family but she truly abhors the fact that he left her with a shit ton of documents that she needed to meticulously read before signing. She glanced at the clock and saw that it was 1:42PM so she poured herself another drink.
Andy and Teddy both still lived in the Tonks house while Harry has been trying to make Grimmauld Place his home. Sirius left it to him and he doesn't want to leave it empty. He wants to fill it with bright and happy memories that will erase its dark past. Harry deems himself successful for the most part. Walburga would roll in her grave if she sees the current state of the House of Black. Gone were the moth infested curtains and the dusty eaten-through carpets, the house elf heads and the troll foot. In their place were curtains made of nearly transparent silk fabric that allowed light to seep through into the now clean windows. The carpet that was spread out in the living room was a gift from Luna from her travels in Saudi Arabia. As for the other items in the house, Harry either destroyed or sold most of them after making sure that they're not cursed. He then renovated the whole place with the help of his friends. Every room is brighter, cleaner, and more welcoming. Household cleaning spells now work properly and Harry doesn't have to scrub fruitlessly for hours on the bathroom tiles to remove the dirt and grime just for it to return to its previous state a few moments later. If he was being perfectly honest with himself, Grimmauld Place started to become "more cooperative" after he was officially named Sirius' heir, making him appear in the Black family tree that still adorned the drawing room. Andy mentioned that it's probably the house finally recognizing him as part of the Black family.
Geneva Gladstone was sentenced to a lifetime in Azkaban with no chance of parole. All of the victims' bodies were retrieved and given a proper burial, any traces of Dark Magic were already expelled from them.
Harry breathed in deeply to organize his thoughts. For now, he pushed the idea of quitting the Auror force to the back of his mind. Instead, he sets out to figure out just why the Masidec glowed in the shop and if his hypothesis about Draco and Adhil being the same person is true.
Harry stepped out of the elevator and looked around. He spotted another reception desk just a short distance away from where he stood.
The previous pain must have been quite intense and the current one starting to amplify again because all Harry did was nod in response and take the bottle handed to him.
"The usual for Hubert." She says with an exhausted sigh. Judging by the way Joseph glanced at the loud man, they assumed that that was "Hubert". Looking at the siblings up close, Harry and Ron could definitely see the similarities between them. They have the same eye shape and color. Their cupid's bow arched in a similar way despite Julia's lips being fuller than her brother's. The Aurors also figured that they would share the same brown hair that Joseph is sporting if Julia didn't have hers bleached blonde.
"I'm talking about the letters from five years ago. The one you addressed to me." Harry clarified. This time he reached into his coat pocket and retrieved a worn-out looking envelope. Its wax seal was already open. Inside, it held several pieces of paper and a small tag. He handed them over to the man beside him.
The two wizards walked along the sidewalks. They passed by the square of Place Sathonay as they headed towards the café on the side opposite from where they came from.
"Healer Vartan--" The wizard behind the desk said in a surprised tone, not expecting the healer in question to appear out of nowhere.
"I'm fine," the blond assured him. He then took a deep breath and finally said the thing that has always been at the back of his mind. The thing that he purposefully ignored for a long time but he can't do that now because they're going back to Britain and they should really get this thing out of the way. "Are…are you sure you're happy here?"
"Of course," The redhead said, already getting up from his seat. "Let me just get some Pepper-Up before I fall asleep on my feet. The thingamajig is with George right now. He's still working on the additional enchantments but he did say that it's safe to use for the most part."
How will he start looking? Maybe go to Lyon? He couldn't just go there without a firm lead. Yes, the city's name may have been encircled in the maps and Parkinson may have talked about it but it was far from being the only place marked. Maybe the other cities have a bigger significance to the Malfoys, specifically to Draco.
"What about me?" Draco asked with furrowed brows, moving his arm to let his head rest on his hand so that he can look at Harry more comfortably.
He felt an odd sense of déjà vu when he entered Conference Room #5. It was like he was transported back to one of their first briefings on The Missing Wizards case. However, instead of the room being filled with Aurors from their department, several unfamiliar faces now sat by the table. As per usual, a vacant seat was saved for him beside Ron while Robards was already up front and ready to discuss whatever it was that he needed to discuss.
"Yeah. Say it explodes, right? Instead of being blown into smithereens and dying, we would just find ourselves in St. Mungos."
There was silence for a few moments. It was then followed by muffled voice and footsteps on a hardwood floor. Another moment of silence. It was longer this time.
Maybe it's going to be about how two people who are so different from each other became friends. How they'll become m--
"That's really so sweet of you, Harry," Hermione said, her face painted with a soft smiling expression, clearly touched by Harry's gift. Harry smiled back, his cheeks slightly heating up at the attention that he's gift was getting. He's still quite glad that he chose to give Pansy and Luna that portrait, to remind them of how much they love each other on a daily basis despite the two of them clearly expressing it since day one.
"Hate to say it but she's right," Ron said, reaching for another serving of food. "If Malfoy really did blow up the Manor and left without a trace – which he did – who's to say he's not hiding out in some far off country right now? Either that or he's dead."
"I was actually wondering if I could talk to any member of the treatment program? Celeste mentioned that Dr. Laurent is not available but is there someone else in-charge that I could talk to?"
That night, he dreamt of that day in Malfoy Manor, roughly five years ago when Malfoy refused to confirm his identity. Silver eyes boring into his, pools of mercury swirling with both recognition and fear.
"It acts like a signal," George replied. "If the person that owns that signature is near, the amulet will glow the faintest of blues. I wanted it to be orange but the spellwork for that is stuck firmly on blue."
It was odd. Harry knew that she was speaking French. Her words were most definitely not English when she uttered them but he perfectly understood each and every word. Maybe a translation spell was active.
The woman continued to fire curses at them but her actions are starting to falter. They weren't as smooth and as quick as they initially were. She's starting to get worn out. Harry and Ron could clearly see this. Offensive spells, especially if they're dark and have the intent of maiming or killing someone, are much more taxing to cast than defensive ones.
Her office was simple, something that one would expect an office would be except for the fact that there are definite touches of "Pansy Parkinson" all over the room. There's the emerald green wallpaper and the elegant green and gold carpet laid down in the middle of the wooden floor. Her deep mahogany desk held certain items like an elegant paperweight that held a preserved gladiolus flower inside, and atleast three expensive looking quills next to a glass ink bottle.
