And so Draco follows him into the cavernous entrance hall. Draco looks around appreciatively. It reminds him much more of the Manor than Potter’s previous house. But it’s not as ostentatious as the Manor, and Draco likes that about it.
“But you want to know the best part?” Harry asked, rounding the corner and reentering the classroom.
“Harry,” Draco says, pulling back. “I’m
“Take care of him,” she whispers in his ear. “And so help me, Merlin, if you hurt him, I don’t care who you are, I will end you.” Harry gulps and nods. Of course, he has no intention of hurting her son. It’s not even a real relationship. And even if it were, Harry prides himself on still being on good terms with all of his exes. Just ask Ginny Weasley.
“Harry,” Draco says. He reaches across the table and takes Harry’s hand briefly. “I’m flattered you think that, but in reality, I’m just good at researching things. Those guidebooks that you scribble notes in? I actually read them. How do you think I knew where to go shopping in Milan?”
“Oh how lovely!” Hannah exclaims.
“It’s too small to get a print from.”
“Okay,” he relented.
“Can you at least show
“Potter,” Snape said as Harry entered his office.
“Yes, Mum said you two were dating,” Fred said, a friendly smile on his face. “But I don’t think I properly believed her until now.
“Yes. It’s a nice lunch. I would wear heels to it,” Pansy said. “Which means that you have to.” She produced a pair of low heels from her bag and held them out to Harry. He frowned but took them from her. He slipped them on to his feet and grew by several inches, which made him closer to his normal height.
“Right,” Pansy says. “If what you’re saying is true, then this is not the place to discuss it.”
“The what?”
“What?”
“Quick question,” he says. Potter stops talking, mid sentence. His mouth hangs open for a moment before he closes it. “Where will you be sleeping?” Potter blinks owlishly at him. Behind him, Draco can see Pansy smirk into her soup. “I only ask because, uh, I didn’t come home last night. So Greg is going to have ideas about how fast our relationship is moving.” He does not add that Greg would be right.
“This feels like a cop out,” he said as he pointed to his chest and conjured a name tag with his wand.
a lot recently, it seemed. He needed to be more careful. Hell,
“Oh, uh.” She glanced down at the paper again. “Ignatius Proudfoot.” Harry released a breath he didn’t realize he had been holding. It wasn’t Tonks, or Kingsley, or Mad Eye.
“Double potions first thing,” he said and he knew that this was perhaps the first time in his life that he was excited to go to Potions class.
“Yes, I have a car.” Potter blinks at Draco for a moment before he nods and lets go of his sleeve.
“Would it help if I?” Draco asks, reaching around to grasp Massi’s erection. As he gives it a few pulls, his hips involuntarily rock, but Massi doesn’t tell him to stop. Instead he says,
“Have a Peppermint Toad, Steve,” Pansy says, handing him one.
“Was what we did in the Honeydukes cellar terrifying?” Draco asked. He seemed genuinely concerned.
“Point taken,” Blaise said quickly, cutting her words off. Pansy smirked at him then glanced behind them at Ron and Hermione. Blaise caught her look and pressed his lips together. Pansy arched an eyebrow at him and he blinked blithely back at her.
“What?” Draco manages to rasp out, ignoring Potter who is looking at him with question in his eyes.
“Yeah, he still thinks I’m a Slytherin fuck up like the pair of you.”
“I would like my Wizengamot appointed solicitor, please,” Wise says.
“That makes sense,” she says softly. “May I ask who taught you?” Draco grits his teeth before realizing there is no shame in admitting who it was.
“Very.” Harry slid his leg over until their feet were touching. It was the least he could do, and at the same time it was the most he could do in the public setting of the classroom.
“What?” Pansy is so distracted by this that she stops telling McLaggen off for his failure to check for magical signatures.
“OK,” he said. “In which case, we will meet outside the Girl’s bathroom on the second floor on Thursday.” Pansy looked skeptical, but they all agreed. And that was that.
“Of course, Susan,” she says. “I’m sorry that I ran away from you earlier.”
“You vouched for me at my trial, but not for him,” Draco says, taking a step towards Potter so that he’s right in his face, looking down at him when he says it. It’s a thing that’s bothered Draco for years: Potter’s double standards when it came to testifying after the war. Potter takes a step back and regards Draco cooly.
“What?”
“Did we want to draw out the rune first and then start the casting?” Hermione asked. “Or just go for it?” Blaise frowned down at the book.
Had he been surprised that Harry Potter of all people would be going to a Slytherin party? Yes. But was he trying to play it cool? Also yes. Colin could be cool. Or he could at the very least pretend until it stuck.
“On a date?”
Hermione looked up at Blaise, her face flushed from exertion and steam, and smiled.
“We should get going,” Draco said, checking his pocket watch. “It’s nearly eleven and we have to get down to Hogsmeade.” Harry nodded. While Dumbledore had
He pulls out his wand and taps his watch as he walks down the corridor. A 3D rendering of London appears above it, centered on where Harry is now. His eyes flick down to the coordinates in his other hand and he waves his wand at the rendering while concentrating on them. The map moves and a small blinking dot appears in a tiny translucent building. Harry prods the image with his wand and the view moves in towards the dot, other buildings and street names coming into focus. Harry scans the surrounding streets for a moment and then nods to himself.
“Can we?”
“That doesn’t mean anything to Hermione. She always likes to remind me that I’m not special.”
“I can’t pretend that I hadn't been worried.”
“So no, we were not having a party.”
“Happily,” Ron said. He leaned down to kiss her again but she pulled away.
Second Year for me to call him Harry.” Draco laughs.
“I don’t know,” he says. “There’s something off about her.”
“Salazar Slytherin added the Chamber of Secrets,” Blaise said, picking up Hermione’s train of thought. “Godric Gryffindor added the lake and the Sorting Hat.”
“It’s so good to see you,” Harry says once the greetings have died down. “It’s been too long.”
“But the Death Eaters,” Draco started to say, but Snape waved his comment off.
“Gin?” Pansy hazarded. Draco nodded. He looked around at the selection for a moment longer and then pulled down a different gin and a few other bottles. Pansy watched with interest as he measured things out and mixed them together.
“Because the Hit Wizards never do that,” Harry shoots back sarcastically. Even after all these years, Parkinson has the uncanny ability to get under his skin in ways that very few people can. (If he’s being honest, Malfoy is included in that list of people). And it doesn’t help that Harry still doesn’t trust her. He has not forgotten that she was the one who suggested to Snape that they give him up to Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts.
“We’re together,” Draco says curtly. Massi shrugs and then flicks his head towards one of the women.
“I feel like I’m in over my head.”
“Thank you all for coming,” Pansy’s mother is saying. Pansy is glowering at her from a couch in the corner of the room. They have moved onto her least favorite part of Christmas Day: her mother’s white elephant party. There are more people here than ever before which means it’s going to last longer than ever before. Pansy thinks she would rather crucio herself than sit through it. But she has to, and so she sits in the corner and glowers.
“But you like rules,” Ron protested feebly.
“Did you want to go home and change?” Pansy asks him, clearly annoyed at having to repeat herself. Draco swallows down the toast and nods.
“Chelsea.”
His mother was standing next to his bed, methodically un-shrinking Draco’s pile of Christmas presents which now sat atop his blankets. When she heard the door open, she turned to face them.
“Or, we will be,” Ron added. “Though I’m not sure I’m up for lessons.”
“You could say that,” Malfoy says. “Yes.” He takes Harry’s hand and leads him further into the room. “Greg, I’m sure you remember Potter.”
“Dobby!” Harry cried. It was almost
you want?” Draco frowns at his watch for another moment before he finally drops his arm. She stares at him, letting the silence drag on.
“I don’t think you were an idiot,” Harry says gently. “I think you were brought up to think a certain way. And you were twelve.”
“No, Harry,” Dumbledore said. “That was all.” Taking this as a dismissal, Harry left.
“Well if you were working with him, you should know where Wood sent it then.”
“Hello,” he says, breaking the awkward silence that has sprung up.
“Right then,” Blaise said quickly. “How about one last round and then home?”
“I never intended for you to do it, Draco,” Snape said. “I was going to step in before you did anything serious.”
“You have experience with that?” McLaggen asks.
“Oh?”
Once Draco’s shirt is gone, Harry leans down again and begins kissing the side of Draco’s neck. He slowly makes his way down Draco’s torso, kissing and nipping as he goes, until he reaches the waistband of Draco’s trousers. He pauses there, staring up at Draco with unconcealed lust in his eyes.
“Right then,” Genevieve says, turning to the make up table. “Let’s make you presentable.” The pair of them get to work, their hands a near blur of activity, and Draco watches in fascination as his face is powdered and lined and blurred and what have you in the mirror, seemingly of its own accord.
“Are they around? I can’t see anyone.” Draco looks around, wondering if Harry can see something he can’t. Perhaps Harry has better eyes for this kind of thing as he has lived with it his whole life.
in a secret relationship, I just snog people in the middle of a party.” Ron felt his face burn at the mention of kissing. He took another quick swig of the whisky.
“I need you to go on vacation,” Hermione says.
“I would say we parade around the castle, carrying his head aloft to show everyone that he’s dead, but he doesn’t have any hair to hold him up by.”
“I am,” she said slowly. “But I'm also not sure what to do with that time. I mean, no offense to Harry or Ron but I doubt they’ll be done anytime soon.”
Well, being alive was nice while it lasted.
“So you’re saying you need to eat first so you can get your stamina up?” Malfoy closes his eyes for a long moment and Harry can’t tell if his is trying not to laugh or if he is trying not to hit him. He thinks he sees the corners of Malfoy’s mouth quirk upwards but he can’t be sure.
“I don’t have much of an opportunity to go shopping,” Harry mumbled. “I get shipped off to my aunt and uncle’s every summer and you must be mental if you think they would let me buy myself new things.”
“Uh,” Ron said. He, like Colin, was awed by wall of liquor. Draco sighed in irritation.
“Thanks.” Potter takes a large sip of the steaming liquid, only grimacing slightly at the heat. He sighs. “That’s better. Now, does anyone want breakfast?” Draco looks over at Pansy who checks her watch.
“Hmm,” Draco muses. “Do I want to sleep with my boyfriend?” He smirks and sees the tension leave Harry’s forehead. “Get your kit off then.” He pulls out his wand and casts and obscuring spell at the window. It can never hurt to be cautious. Then he locks the compartment door and turns his attention to Harry.
“We have the budget for that?”
“That was not what I meant,” he snapped. “Can you give me some privacy please? I'm not quite ready for you to see me without a shirt.” Draco slapped a hand to his forehead.
“Not even a little bit?”
“Drink up,” was all she said.
“Yes, you have.”
“Good luck.” Harry kissed him again and then Draco was gone.
He slowly opens his eyes, convinced that he is hungover. He grimaces as he looks around the room, searching for the glass of water he usually leaves on his nightstand after drinking. His bedside light is still on and he realizes he never turned it off before falling asleep. And then he notices the book, and memories of the night before wash over him.
“But you can see why I might want to redecorate?” he asks.
“Though, I suppose you’re probably busy most nights,” he says. “Major.” She claps a hand over his mouth.
“Like me?”
“Yes,” he says at last. “Yes. This is one of the biggest retail days of the year, and how we perform could make or break us.” The last part is something Big Dick had said to them all the other day but he is not overly concerned that Joe or Luca will be upset by the repetition. He is not even sure they will notice it. He is sure they haven't paid much attention to a single thing Big Dick has ever said to them. “You don’t want people going to Quigley’s over in Knockturn Alley, do you?” Quigley’s Mystical Market is the unspoken main competitor to Flourish and Blotts and the Flourish Team enjoys a mostly friendly rivalry with the Quigley’s Team. Both Joe and Luca shake their heads violently.
“I love you too, Draco.”
“I don’t want to talk about it at
“You did it,” Ron said excitedly. “You bloody
“What?”
, he thinks,
Days turn into weeks, and soon Draco and P Squared (as he has taken to calling Potter and Parkinson) start to feel like a proper team. They fall into a rhythm. Draco reads the Prophet in the mornings and reports on anything that sparks. Most of the time P Squared follow up and leave Draco to cover for Pansy at Flourish and Blotts, but sometimes he gets to go along. He has now been to more formal functions in the past few weeks than he had in the previous few years.
“Harry Potter,” he said, an odd gleam in his eyes. “It is a pleasure to meet you. I’m Horace Slughorn.” He held out a pudgy hand which Harry reluctantly shook. Slughorn’s eyes had barely left his scar since he walked in and it was starting to become unnerving.
“-Yes, invisibly. And now you just let me fuck you on this sofa.”
“That was excellent, Draco,” she gushes. “I’ve never seen such natural talent.”
“I would avoid Joe and Luca if you know what’s good for you.”
“Whisky, port, gin,” Potter recites, pulling each bottle up briefly to allow Draco to see their labels.
“There isn’t one.”
Hermione and Blaise were a few paces back from the body, and so were close enough that Harry could see tear tracks on Hermione’s face. Pansy appeared to have stabbed Voldemort with a basilisk fang, which explained why the Voldemort-thing had started screaming in the strange limbo place, and Ron was standing, holding the sword of Gryffindor casually over his shoulder. But as Harry watched, Voldemort’s eyes started to open. Pansy noticed around the same time as he did, and he knew this because she gave a shriek and started pushing Ron away.
“Well, no,” she said. “Not when you put it that way.”
“It’s the First of August,” Draco says.
“That’s not the point.” Harry crossed his arms and pouted. All of Ron’s logic was making sense. It was infuriating.
“-And you couldn’t resist getting a picture that you could send to the Daily Prophet?” Draco snarled. He took a step towards Colin, but Harry put an arm out to stop him.
“Harsh,” Draco says. “But fair.” Harry shrugs.
“Standard.”
It’s just as Draco is reaching the front door that his own mobile starts to ring. He stops dead, fear flooding through him as he looks at the number calling. It’s the house phone he’d insisted his mother get for emergencies. It’s been programed into his phone since the day he’d gotten it, but this is the first time the number has ever flashed up on the screen.
“Any room?"
“I take it you’re a Weasley,” Narcissa said. Ron nodded.
Cormac’s face lights up in a smile as soon as he sees Pansy and he makes a beeline across the room to sit next to her.
“McLaggen?” Hermione asks. Harry sighs. He had hoped they would have to get into this, but he supposes it
“Correct! Five points for Gryffindor.” Draco kicked him lightly under the table and Harry elbowed him back. Harry was still feeling a bit giddy about the fact that he had told Draco he loved him and Draco had said it back on Saturday, so every touch, be it a kick or otherwise, sent tingles of delight through him.
He looked over at Draco and saw himself squinting back at him.
“Everything!” Helena shrieked. “That I’d stolen it from my mother and run away to Albania. That with her health deteriorating, she had asked the Baron, a man who had long loved me, to find me so that we might reunite before she died. I told Riddle about how I had hidden the diadem in a hollow tree when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest after me. I’d never told anyone that before.” Helena put her head in her hands and began to weep. “He was so flattering," she said between sobs. "He seemed to understand, to sympathize.” She sank to her knees.
“Are you complaining?” Draco asked. He reached up and traced his finger down Harry’s cheek.
“I’m not an emotional support puppy, Potter.” Harry’s eyes widen in surprise and then he gives a short bark of laughter. Draco rolls his eyes.
“You may,” Draco says with a smile.
“What of it?” Pansy asks. Irritation flares in her chest, making her perhaps more fond of Greg than she has been in the past few weeks.
“Nothing,” Pansy says quickly. The house elf reappears at that moment holding their drinks, so Pansy downs the last of her glass of wine and collects the new one.
“And when has anyone done that to you?” Draco asks. His tone is withering.
“Have you not?”
“Well would you?” he asked.
“Yes,” he said. “My mother taught me. She is herself highly skilled.”
“Prove it.”
“And yes, Potter, you can come too,” she added before Harry could say anything. “This idiot already requested you as his plus one for reasons that are beyond me but that I honestly couldn't care less about.” She untangled herself from Draco and instead walked over to Blaise and rested a head on his shoulder. Harry saw Hermione stiffen until Blaise shrugged and dislodged Pansy.
“King’s Cup,” Draco suggested. When the Gryffindors frowned at him, he explained that it was a drinking game.
“What?” Harry was confused for just long enough for Blaise to know he had forgotten their cover story because it
“Are you seeing what I’m seeing?” he asks in a low voice.
“I was delighting in the fact that people might
Harry put the paper down. A picture of the Dark Mark, green and ghostly, stared back at him. He couldn’t look away from it. He knew he should read the article, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He knew what it would say anyway. Or close enough. Muggles killed for sport. Bodies littered everywhere. Carnage. Mayhem. Terror.
,” Harry said. “I’m sorry for trying.”
“Stop that,” he says. “Also when you go to Mr. Malfoy’s house, I would like you to wear the new towel I got for you.” Thus far, Kreacher had been resistant to wearing anything but his filthy loincloth. Kreacher crosses his arms and glares at Harry in defiance. “Mr. Malfoy would prefer a nice clean towel to your current attire.” At once, Kreacher’s demeanor changes. His arms unfold and his back straightens.
They decided to practice Patronus charms as Pansy said the chamber was rather depressing, which was true, even after they had lit the torches. Harry, Ron and Hermione demonstrated their patronuses again and then Harry launched into the lesson that he had taught the DA the year before. Then they paired up and began practicing.
“So, what? I should just walk around the Ministry and look at people?” Draco asks. From his tone, it is clear that he is being sarcastic, but McLaggen perks up at this suggestion.
“You seemed unsure and I didn’t want to pressure you.”
“What?” she
“Kreacher,” Harry calls. There is a loud crack and the house elf appears in front of Harry.
“I enjoyed last night more than I thought I would,” he says. “And I like you two. So is that a yes?” Harry looks at Draco who gives him the smallest of nods.
“It’s a good thing I love you,” Draco agreed. Harry smiled and kissed Draco one last time on the lips before letting him away from the wall. “You’d better not have gotten dirt in my hair.”
Harry did not turn around at the sound of the door.
“Ok,” Harry said, although the idea of having Draco around during some of his most vulnerable times filled him with dread.
“Not really,” Draco says. “Just somewhere with booze and music.”
“Who volunteers to cast?”
“This is amazing.” He turned to Narcissa. “Thank you so much for including me.”
“Fine. Blaise, do a joint costume with me.”
“So my father went to prison because he was caught trying to steal a prophecy?” Harry nodded.
to be where they’re keeping her. He is about to message McLaggen when it occurs to him that if he tells McLaggen, McLaggen is going to apparate over and give away the rescue plot, which would ruin Harry’s plans of Hermione spying for them. So, perhaps against his better judgement - and certainly against protocol - he says nothing and instead starts to figure out how best to get into the building.
“Well if McLaggen has told you about it, there’s not much I need to say, is there?” Pansy puts her hands on her hips and frowns at Draco. “Ok, fine. Harry and I were found standing over a dead body.”
“I know her from the Order meetings,” Blaise whispered back and it was all Hermione could do not to slap a hand to her forehead. Of course Blaise knew who Tonks was.
And that was how Harry came to lead two “Remedial Defense Against the Dark Arts” classes a week. Not that he would dare complain about it. At least not to anyone but Draco.
“For dinner?”
“I can go find him,” Ron offered. He was sitting ramrod straight on the sofa opposite Narcissa.
“Potter,” he spluttered. “I am not wanking myself off with you in my ear.” Though, if he were being honest, the idea of it sent a thrill of excitement through him.
“I’ve been sworn to secrecy,” Draco says quickly.
“I’m sorry?”
“Hey girl, hey,” Blaise said, sidling up to the ghost of the Grey Lady on Sunday morning. She stared at him. He flashed her his winningest smile. She continued to stare at him. “You’re looking very fetching today.” She frowned at him suspiciously.
“So are you going to open it?” Greg asks.
“As I was saying,” Hermione cut in. “Now that we have destroyed most of the remaining horcruxes, we thought it was time to come up with the plan to defeat him for good.”
“Sleep is for the weak,” Seamus insisted. Justin shook his head, but there was a bemused smile on his face. After a moment, he leaned over and kissed Seamus quickly on the cheek.
“Is this what I think it is?” he asked.
They stay at the Leaky Cauldron until they are the last people there. Which is a common occurrence for Draco and a first for Harry. Draco knows this because Harry keeps trying to apologize to Hannah for making her stay so late.
“Yes please.” Harry obliges and turns on his side, away from the blond. Though part of him thinks it is silly - they have slept together after all - he knows that these feelings are not often rational. He feels the covers move and the mattress shift as Draco climbs into bed.
“Um,” Susan says. “May I take your vitals? I get the feeling that I shouldn’t be here for this conversation but I want to make sure you’re alright before I leave.” Hermione leans back on the sofa cushions.
“I dunno,” Harry says. “We bring him in?”
“Charms class is not a euphemism, is it?” Harry asked.
“We weren’t,” Pansy clarifies. “We sometimes let people think we were because it was easier for both of us.”
“What?” Bones asks. She is clearly thrown by the question.
I'm sorry - my schedule has been all over the place! And unfortunately it will continue to be for a bit. I will try my best to keep updating on time!
“Yes.”
“Fine, fine,” Pansy says. “So you didn’t feel like you could call Granger out on protocol. I get it. Moving along. If there is something wrong with her, what do we do about it?”
“It’s an experimental lotion,” Snape continued as though Harry had not said anything. “That I’ve been researching for the St. Mungo’s burn unit.”
“She’s been a little short with Rose, but Rose is two and so she doesn’t really notice.” Ron takes another sip of his tea. “But she’s been a bit more enthusiastic in the bedroom,” he mumbles, his ears turning red. Well that was something Harry hadn’t wanted to hear. He takes a deep breath.
“Then teach us,” Draco said. Harry looked over at him. He was standing very straight and still, his nose in the air. Harry wished he had that kind of confidence. And then he looked a bit closer and noticed that Draco’s hand was shaking slightly. He resisted the urge to reach out and hold it.
“Leave it to me.”
“Unfortunately, in order to find the others, we must first determine what they are.” Harry sat back in his chair. A sigh escaped his lips before he could stop himself. “Luckily,” Dumbledore continued. “We have eight minds to put towards this task.”
“Where were you?” Draco asks.
“Accio Cup,” Hermione cried. They waited for a moment to see if it had worked. “Nothing,” she said. Harry started to push forward through the room again, when he thought about the broomsticks. Wouldn’t an aerial view help? He retraced his steps until he found the brooms again. He held his hand over one of them.
“But I—“
“Now what?” Ron asked. He and Pansy had finished adding the latest potion ingredients.
“Oh,” Hermione said as they reached the marble staircase. “I forgot to ask Dumbledore about some sort of house neutral common area.”
“Snape paired us for those potions,” he said. “And I’m now convinced that he had some ulterior motives.”
” Well, right now Draco’s safety is in jeopardy and he would really rather have his wand.
“Granger?” he hazarded. “How about you?” Hermione’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.
“What about your family?”
“No,” Pansy says at the same time as Cormac says,
“Well, thank Merlin Draco’s room is at the top of the house,” Greg says. Draco forces out a laugh. It sounds awkward, even to his ears. Shit. He’s going to have to get better at this fake relationship business. And, he grouses to himself, he should probably call the black haired git by his first name. Like a normal person and not like school rivals. He should also potentially stop referring to him as a black haired git. Maybe.
“Fuck you. No, it wasn’t.” Draco and Pansy are both now watching their conversation with interest; the Simurgh Society is momentarily forgotten.
“But either way, Ron, I’m not sure all the lower years would fit in here,” Pansy said, ignoring Seamus’s stare.
“Malfoy?” they asked in unison.
He pulls out a piece of parchment, sits down next to the door and gets to work. As he undoes each ward, he notes it down on his parchment so that he can replace it once he has rescued Hermione. This way, he hopes that they can keep up the charade that Hermione is in fact whoever it is that’s impersonating her. It is tedious, slow going work, but so are so many parts of Harry’s job.
“I still fold. You win. I don’t want to go through the agonizing process of slowly losing properly.”
“Fine,” she mutters.
sucking his cock. But then, he is getting his cock sucked so really, shouldn't he be excited?
“That’s wonderful.” Gillian’s voice sounds far away as Draco decides to lose himself in Harry’s eyes. He leans forward and presses their foreheads together, not breaking eye contact and he feels Harry shift in his arms again. Another flash. Gillian calls out instructions and Draco relaxes into the rhythm of the shoot.
“Fair point.” Draco pulls out a pair of tight green trousers and then after a moments thought, also grabs a loose fitting white shirt.
“Yes, team. It means today will be the busiest day of the year. The day when ordinary house witches turn in to vicious book hunting animals, blinded by the need to get their precious children the correct textbooks, and eager to get the school shopping done early. If this were a zoo I'd say run for your lives, but this is Flourish and Blotts and we run from no challenge!” He punches a fist in the air. He feels his shirt ride up his stomach again but he ignores it. He stares around at his team, wild eyed and excited. They blink back at him. Nathalie blows a bubble with her gum and it pops with a loud snap.
“Come on, Greg,” Joe says. “You know you want to.”
He takes a moment to admire the cover, tracing a finger over the gold-embossed lettering. It really is a gorgeous book. If Oliver sent it to him because he thought Draco would admire it, he was spot on. Draco is damn well infatuated with it.
“This still doesn’t mean that you can tell me what to do,” Pansy says by way of congratulations. Draco just grins at her.
“Ok.”
“What?” Draco stops walking in his surprise.
“Do you think it’s the person you spotted the other day?”
“I understand,” Harry says. “Does this mean
“Oh,” Ron said, clearly disappointed that this had not been news to his new friends. And then he realized that he had thought of them as his new friends and he wasn’t sure how he felt about it.
“I notice you don’t hang around with them as often anymore,” Harry said. Draco shrugged.
cold.
“No,” Harry said. “I wouldn’t want you to be sad.” Draco grinned. “But I’m buying the rest of my clothes, ok?” Draco nodded but crossed his fingers when Harry wasn’t looking.
“No,” Draco said fiercely. “You learned important information. The snake’s a horcrux, and other horcrux’s can’t necessarily tell what’s a real one or not. I’m
“Sit,” she instructs, pointing at the two make up chairs in the middle of the room. Draco does not need telling twice. Harry rolls his eyes at Gillian but makes his way over to the available chair. “I’ll be back when you’re both even more beautiful,” she says. “And then the real fun begins!”
“I live nearby. The security owl didn’t have far to go.”
He dreams of driving through country lanes in the Bentley. Driving, and driving, and never getting to where he needs to be, even though he knows he needed to be there ten minutes ago. It’s a nightmare he’s had many times before — so many times that it almost feels lazy. And at least it’s not one of the bad ones. At least it’s not one of the dreams that sends him rocketing awake, heart pounding and covered in sweat. Or one of the ones that his mother tells him he screams through. He hopes those ones stay away. He’s not sure he could live down Potter hearing him screaming in his sleep.
“Really?” Harry asks. “I didn’t think that was protocol.” McLaggen sighs.
“I was never dark and brooding,” Potter says, shaking his head. “I think you had the monopoly on that.” Potter takes a sip of his coffee. He closes his eyes as he does and smiles contentedly.
As it was, the Leaky Cauldron was all but deserted when the pair of them stumbled out of the fireplace. The only two people there were Tom, the wizened barkeep, and an older man who was nursing a glass of what looked like Firewhisky, even though it was only just verging on ten in the morning.
“Pansy, you don’t understand. She used this spell to save my life.”
“That wasn’t a date,” Harry protests. “That was a mission. I mean a date with just you and I and a nice meal that’s paid for by the ministry.”
“Sure,” Harry said. Blaise and Hermione both nodded their assent.
He walks into the bedroom and looks around. It feels cold from misuse. The room has a musty smell, even though Draco can’t see a speck of dust on any of the furniture. If he had to guess, he would say that the room’s decorations had not been updated since the mid 1920s. The wallpaper here is less faded than that in the entrance hall, but is still far from new. Draco can see that it was once a deep emerald green with a woven fleur-de-lis pattern, but the colors are more subdued now. There’s a four poster bed with heavy damask curtains against one wall and while Draco half expects there to be a cloud of dust that arrises from the bed when he sits down, there thankfully is none. While the bed linens are old, it seems that they are at least clean.
“It was so strange, this morning I really wanted to sleep in, but I was interrupted by a
“Because the information is still classified. Once the Reliquary was found, Dempsey pulled us all off of the case, except for you. Most of the Hit Wizards moved on to other things, but the other team I’m on is still working on it, just from afar.”
“Well?” Draco asks after Harry has stared at him for a long moment. “How do I look?”
“Yeah, alright,” Draco said. “Anyone else?” He looked over at Neville who shook his head quickly.
“Does it have to mean anything?” Seamus asked and then realized that was the absolute wrong thing to ask as Justin’s face fell. This was new. Justin had never really talked about their nighttime activities during the daylight before. But clearly he wanted more now.
“Nicholas,” she says and watches as the panic appears behind his eyes. “I don’t know how you expect to get out of this. You were caught redhanded attempting to liberate Flourish and Blotts of some of their most valuable items. We have eye witness testimony that you went to the store days earlier to case the place.”
“I want you to wear this,” Harry said to Draco several hours later. Draco was getting ready to go to the Room of Requirement and repair the vanishing cabinet.
“Special magic,” he says.
“Ok, it’s a deal,” McLaggen says. “Will you swear an Unbreakable vow?”
“It’s like wearing your boyfriend’s letterman jacket,” Harry tried to explain, but only Hermione understood the reference.
“That’s another thing that’s off,” Harry says, sitting up ramrod straight. “Hermione didn’t want to use the Reliquary today.”
“Even Dean?” Ron asked.
“Hi Harry,” he said. Harry ignored him, instead reaching past him to get the flagon of pumpkin juice. “Bee in your bonnet then?”
“Fine,” Potter grumbles. “I will not eat your bacon if you manage to shower and get back here within fifteen minutes.”
“I confund him every now and again,” she says breezily.
“I am not drinking straight firewhisky,” Hermione said as one bottle reached her.
“All I said was we couldn’t stay
“No!” Harry cried in protest and Blaise winked at him. Harry scowled for a moment and then stood up. “I’m going to go see if they’re alright.” He ran down the corridor that Pansy and Draco had gone down, wand also drawn, expecting at any moment to be hit by a wall of water, or to be blown backward by a huge gust of wind, or… something. But nothing happened. Instead, he found himself in a corridor lined with doors, one of which was ajar. He hurried towards it and found Draco and Pansy doubled over laughing.
“We were?” Draco looked so hopeful, his eyes still brimming with tears, that Harry couldn’t speak again, so he just nodded. Emotions flitted across Draco’s face -worry, disbelief, hope, caution- and Harry made his nods bigger.
“Charming.” Pansy rolls her eyes.
so that they can fill the cups as much or as little as they want. Once the waiter leaves, they both reach for the spoon at the same time. Harry inwardly winces. In response, they both draw their hands back, each of them trying to be polite to the other.
“I almost forgot,” Harry said to Draco later, while they were lounging on an overstuffed sofa, nursing a pair of Old Fashioneds that Draco had whipped up. The other couples were in opposite corners of the room, each of them wrapped up in each other (quite literally in Pansy and Ron’s case.) “What did you want to see me after dinner for?” Draco took a sip of his drink.
“Don't make me say it again.”
The volume of patrons has drastically dropped by this point, so Draco spends his time restocking some of the shelves. He is just placing
“Harry said I love you.”
“Fucking Malfoy,” Harry muttered.
“What?”
“Crookshanks?”
“Do I know you?”
“How so?”
“Yes, I think that went well,” Ron said, staring down into their cauldron, now at least a foot away from Pansy. He tried to bring his breathing back under control.
“I still can’t believe you were even considering it,” Draco says. He lifts a hand and runs a finger down Massi’s cheek. “You seemed pretty into me last night.”
“What are you getting at McLaggen? Harry’s my boyfriend.”
“Massi wanted a bit of an adventure tonight,” Draco says.
,” Draco said, scowling at them and crossing his arms. The bald cat was perched on his shoulder, a similar glower on its face.
“I did no such thing,” Draco protested. “In regards to cheating at least.” He smirked and Harry nudged him playfully on the shoulder.
“That can come later,” Harry said. “Maybe,” he amended when he saw the look on Snape’s face. “Right now we’re all aligned on ‘let’s not let Voldemort kill Harry.’” The other two winced as Harry said the name.
“It might be funny for you,” Harry whispered, leaning forward to pull his trousers carefully back up. He felt like a sticky mess, but there was nothing to be done about it until they reached the Hogwarts grounds again. “But that’s the kind of thing that would
“Yes.”
Potter seems to relax more once Pansy’s spinning form has disappeared. He leans back in his chair and stretches, yawning as his arms reach high above his head.
“Hermione,” Ron said. “It’s six drinks between two people. I’m sure they’ll be fine.” She flashed him a smile.
“On the house,” she says. “This beer, however.” She finishes pulling one beer and plonks it down in front of Draco. “You can pay me for.”
“Everything okay?” he asks. Draco nods. He is, after all, well acquainted with his hand.
Draco tries not to feel too hurt about the fact that he gets sent back to work at Flourish and Blotts while everyone else goes off to investigate Swinn’s disappearance. This is how things were before he and Harry had gone to Europe. There is no reason why it wouldn’t go back to that now. Though he had somewhat hoped that after everything he and Harry had achieved in Europe that he would be trusted to go on more missions. But then, he reasons, they haven’t gone through their full debrief with Granger yet. Perhaps then he will entrusted with more responsibility.
“Of course you can,” says an unidentified Hit Wizard.
“Fine,” he says. “You have a point. But it’s different now.” And he lays out exactly why.
“Kreacher is saying you is going to Dobby’s old house. A bad place.”
“Yeah, mate,” Harry said, even though he didn’t really. “Give me all the details.” They were sitting on their respective beds, across from each other. Harry pulled his legs up until he was sitting crosslegged. He leaned down and rested his head on his hands, elbows on his knees - the picture of rapt attention.
“Come on, Parkinson,” McLaggen says. “You know me. I’m a good guy.”
“How would you like to come to a party tonight?” Confusion dimmed Colin’s grin for a moment.
“I hadn’t thought,” Harry said truthfully.
By the time Dobby reached the end of his story, the part where Patterson was dragged into the lake by a sea of undead things after ordering Dobby to take the locket to Dumbledore, the elf was shaking. So, Harry was surprised to see, was Kreacher. In fact, Kreacher was clutching the pillow that Dumbledore had conjured for him like a teddy bear and had tears leaking out of his eyes.
you rescued your sister from the Chamber of Secrets, but what’s to say that really happened. I always thought that was a cover story that Dumbledore used to convince everyone that whoever had pretended to open the Chamber had been apprehended and there would be no more attacks on students.”
“Hello yourself.” Draco shifts slightly behind Harry, letting his arms encircle the brunet more naturally.
“It’s half past midnight.”
And while the whisky has dulled some of the adrenaline from earlier, it has also lowered his inhibitions. Thus, when he crawls into bed, it takes all of his will power not to move over to Potter’s side of the bed and wrap his arms around the man. Because somehow, despite being tired and more than a little drunk, he is wide awake.
“On it.” He hurries away.
“Draco.” Lucius had clearly not expected to see his son inside the castle. His eyes went wide and it made him look, if anything, even more emaciated, emphasizing the circles under his eyes that were so dark they looked like bruises.
“Should we bring Draco?” Harry asks. Hermione frowns. “In case the Reliquary has anything to add.”
“I don’t know,” she said. Neville made a move and Hermione ducked around the foul smelling spray as she lost a point. It instead landed on Ron.
“Is that for me?” He points at the tray.
“Finch-Fletchley?”
“Next up,” Hermione said. “Heels.”
“Damn it,” Harry says.”I wish I knew how to quit you.” The tension breaks.
“He’s probably outside with Harry,” came Ron’s reply.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy.”
“Move,” Harry hisses at him. Malfoy blinks as though coming out of a dream and then begins to run in the direction that Harry indicates.
“-Not attracted to any of the Slytherin boys?” Pansy interrupts. “Did you see them? The only vaguely attractive one was Malfoy, and it became clear to me in our fourth year that the feeling wasn’t mutual.” The elevator door opens with a ping and they crowd inside. Pansy presses the correct floor button and then leans against the wall, facing them both. “Eh, Zabini was decently attractive,” she says, relenting somewhat. “But the pickings were slim to none. And none of the boys in the other houses would deign to date a Slytherin.” She crosses her arms in front of her and glares at a spot on the wall behind Potter. Draco reaches out and rests a hand on her arm.
“Who gave him alcohol?” Blaise asked.
“Or, we could stun him?”
“Ha, same. Though, as I wasn’t the one being poisoned, it’s hard to say how I wouldn’t have been.”
“Yes, well,” Harry said. “It’s Dumbledore. He only seems to tell us things when it suits him, rather than when we might need it.”
There was a general shuffling as everyone made their way to their potions rooms. Harry was somewhat sad as it was the second to last time they would be able to use it. The room had grown on him, partly because of the time he had spent with Draco there and partly because it was a quiet place that was just theirs. This kind of privacy was not something he typically had at school - or at the Dursley’s for that matter. He voiced these thoughts about to Draco after the door had shut behind them (“Stand and fight you lily-livered cretins,” Sir Cadogen had yelled).
“Really,” Hermione said. “Let me just put my book away.” She hurried off and Ron turned to Harry.
“They’re on your tab,” she yells over the crowd and Pansy shoots her a thumbs up.
“Hermione,,” Tusneem says, turning to face her. “I will leave the rest of the details to you for now. I expect a full report before the end of the day.”
Whatever the case, Ron pulled Pansy closer. He wrapped his other arm around her waist and looked down at her. He was about a half a head taller than she was, which meant as he looked at her, he was looking slightly down, and she slightly up. He licked his lips unconsciously and then realized how that must look. Shit.
“Maybe,” he settled on.
“I thought it was just speculation when you told me at the Halloween feast,” McGonagall said. She stared at her skirt and picked a piece of lint off of it.
He winks at her. And then realizes that by winking at her, he was somewhat winking at Potter and that was not what he had meant to do. After all, he’s not allowed to flirt anymore. They’re coworkers now. Potter is in charge of his protection. That, and he’s still pissed off about him not telling him about Oliver.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It is,” Pansy said. But Harry wasn’t listening. He was leaning into Draco, attempting to whisper to him.
“No,” Draco says. “Thank you for telling me.” He runs a hand through his hair, a frown on his face. He can feel Massi watching him. “Fuck,” he says, blowing out the word in a long breath. “Do you think?” He stops and looks at Massi. “Do you think he is dating me just to try to bring down my family?”
“Thank you,” he said. “Why are you giving me this now?”
“Isn’t that why you’ve been working with Potter more often?”
“Is that why you tried to coerce me into sucking your dick at the club?” Massi scrunches up his face.
“Where we can then kill him,” Harry added, squeezing Draco’s shoulder.
“Really, Potter?” he asked.
“I was in training to become a Death Eater over the summer,” Draco said. He stared determinedly at a spot on the booth about a foot left of Harry’s head. Harry sat for a moment, dumbfounded. When he had asked, he hadn’t expected such a frank answer. Suddenly the evening’s trajectory had shifted and he no longer saw them surreptitiously stealing kisses in the corner, but now that the conversation had started, it couldn’t be ignored.
“Yes.”
Draco thinks this must be the worst Christmas he’s ever had. He’s dreadfully hungover and he and Harry are supposed to be at his parents’ house in half a hour. He’s not showered. He doesn’t know what to wear. But those things are the least of his problems. The first of which is sitting upright without vomiting. His head throbs and he allows himself to lay flat for another twenty seconds.
Outside, there were multiple grouped chairs, most of which were occupied. Blaise made a face and started to turn back inside when Hermione grabbed his arm.
“And what would you have done if I had?” Dumbledore asked. This close, Draco could see every line in his face and Draco was struck by how very
anything to be this way. He just was. He supposed it had something to do with his wand, but then the wand chooses the wizard.
“How very British of you.”
“Right,” McLaggen sneers. “Because you’re friends with
“The mirepoix?”
“And,” Draco says. “We should probably also try to find Winola Swinn?”
“No,” he said. And then hoped that it was true. The bald look was not a good one on Draco. There were some people who could pull it off, but Draco was not one of them. But, judging by his father’s hair, he would not have a problem with that in the future.
“Ta da,” Harry says. He drops Draco’s hand and gestures excitedly at the storefront.
He jumps as he feels Malfoy lick the hand that is clamped over his mouth. Harry slowly removes it and they watch as Parkinson taps on her watch briefly before turning back to the back door of the restaurant. She has begun to pull the door open, when Malfoy sneezes. She whips around, wand up and advances toward them again.
“Well,” Ron said. “Probably something like this.” He gestured to indicate their closeness.
“Oh?”
“I should go back to work,” Draco says as he and Harry emerge onto Diagon Alley.
Presently the elf comes back, clutching a tray that holds a small bottle and also Massi’s wand. Massi nods his thanks and the elf departs.
“Right,” Draco said. “Appearances.” And then he disappeared out of the door.
“It’s ok,” she says. “It’s late and we’ve had a bit to drink. I shouldn’t have bitten your head off like that.”
“You started it,” she says. “By kidnapping me on your ice skates.” He claps a hand to his chest.
“I know a lot more about house elves than you think,” Harry says. And his tone says this is the end of the discussion. Draco swallows anything else he was thinking about saying and instead looks around the room. Without furniture, it’s hard to tell what it will be like. But it is large and the walls are painted a nice Gryffindor red. He is about to remark on this to Harry, when he notices that the brunet is staring at a single spot on the floor, and he looks almost as if he is about to cry.
“And I can’t lose
“No need to be mean,”Harry snapped. He pulled his wand out of his pocket and pointed it at himself. “Tergeo.” Draco nodded approvingly and proceeded to do the same.
He reached out a hand and ran it down Harry’s stomach. He was rewarded with a giggle.
, the Reliquary supplies.
,” Harry snapped. “He did break into the Ministry of Magic and attack us.”
“Oh?” Massi is now leaning against the wall next to the sinks, his arms crossed in front of him.
“Well then you know I was fighting his veritaserum when I said that.” She stares at him and he raises his Occlumens shields as he stares back.
“Due to the location. It is the house next to where a previous death had occurred.” He rummages around in his bag and pulls out a sheaf of papers. Pansy shakes her head.
He reaches the junction and throws himself around the corner before skidding to a stop. A line of hit wizards blocks the corridor. He is surrounded. One of them steps forward. Oliver narrows his eyes and glares at her.
“You really don’t like him, do you?” Pansy says.
“How can I help you fine gentlemen?” she asks, grinning.
“He’s old,” Harry says. “And he hates me.”
“No, Ludo Bagman paid them back in Leprechaun gold.” Draco snorts in amusement. “I gave them my Triwizard winnings for the store.”
Perhaps he could just write to his mother and tell her he couldn’t do it. But with his father in Azkaban,
“Where are they, anyway?” McLaggen asks.
“How about,” Draco interjects. “We don’t pretend to break up? I would much prefer it that way.” Harry glances at him. Draco is pale — paler than usual — and he mentally kicks himself. Of course this conversation can’t be easy for him.
“I suppose.”
“Big Dick?” McLaggen asks, not bothering to hide his snort of amusement.
“I should go,” Draco says quietly to Harry, walking with him to the stairs. “Ron doesn’t know I work for the Ministry.”
“Are you on Ron’s side?” Harry asks. He seems genuinely curious.
“I can work with that. In fact, I have the perfect place. And the bathroom stalls are big enough for my other promise tonight.” Harry winks and Draco’s stomach turns over. He had forgotten about that.
“Where were we?” Parkinson asks.
For half a second, Harry wondered if Malfoy could help him with his Occlumency, since he had failed so miserably with Snape as a teacher. But then he realized that might involve Draco delving into his mind and learning things about Harry that Harry might not want to share. At least not yet. Not to mention, there was nothing that actually told him that Draco even knew Occlumency.
“Yes?” Harry had been sure, but now Draco’s questions had introduced doubt.
“The Minister’s tested positive. For the virus.” That Parvati Patil has tested positive for this new disease is news, to be sure, but Draco isn’t sure what this has to do with his leaving.
“And then, well, as you clearly know, Draco’s not that much of a git once you get to know him.”
“It was a little funny,” he says, looking up and smirking at at the brunet. Harry continues to glare, but as Draco watches, the corners of his mouth start to twitch up. “See,” he says. “Even you think it was funny.” Harry rolls his eyes.
“Is he?” she asks. She tries to sound like this is new information, but McLaggen knows far more about things than she thought he did and she’s quite sure he can see through her charade.
“—Protego!” she screamed, even while Blaise shot a well placed bombarda at the wall. The windows shattered inward and they took off running again while the Death Eaters were momentarily distracted. They made it to the swamp corridor and Blaise helped swing them both into the alcove to the side, even as Hermione’s momentum tried to take her into the swamp. They were rewarded a moment later when the three Death Eaters ran around the corner and fell in, head first with a squelch.
“When I had said I was excited to see my future,” Ron said at lunch. “I hadn’t really thought that it might be more serious than just whether or not I made it as an Auror.” Pansy’s vision of Ron’s life had been less dark than Draco’s vision, but not by much. Again, Harry had died, and again Voldemort had worked to consolidate power, but he had done it in a much more insidious way.
“But you’re Harry Potter. I thought danger was practically your middle name.”
“Well at least I don’t seem to think I’m god’s gift to women,” she snaps, leaning forward to glare at him.
“It is interesting though,” Draco says. He holds the book up to Greg. “Feel it.”
“We did almost break up,” Malfoy said. “But then-”
“I could?” Draco starts to say, though his voice is uncertain.
“I remain unconvinced.” She sighed and sat up, taking her feet off the table and stuffing them back into her shoes.
He feels as though he is proving himself to be useful. He has spotted things that neither of the other two have and, of course, he’s the only one who can spark while reading the newspaper.
“That’s it?” Draco asks. “We just drink it?”
“I’m not sure there’s been quite enough of the latter.” Harry leans in so that their faces are inches apart.
“I can’t even escape you on my days off?” she hisses at him.
Later, when Massi is asleep, they hold a brief, whispered conversation. Draco tells Harry what he heard from the patronus and his start of a plan.
“Because you’re wrong,” Pansy says with a smirk. “And I would love to see it you proven wrong in person.” She walks forward and pokes him in the chest with her index finger before she can stop herself. She steps back quickly, irritated by her own actions. No wonder McLaggen thinks about sleeping with her; she seems to flirt with him at every opportunity she gets. Damn his stupid attractive face.
“Good.” They fall quiet and wait for Massi to emerge again from the building. Draco shivers. The night is cold and they left their coats inside the club. It does not help that he is damp with sweat. Harry puts and arm around him, but he can feel Harry shivering as well. But all they can do is hope that Massi will be quick about his errand.
“Who the fuck said we didn’t need you, Potter?” Croaker asks, eyes narrowed.
“McLaggen,” she acknowledges.
“Of course, what kind of Unspeakable do you think I am?”
“Oh, so it’s a party with a secret keeper then?” Joe asks. “You literally can’t give out details? Only the person throwing it can?”
Harry opened his mouth to say something but Snape shook his head, gesturing at Draco. Harry snapped his mouth shut again. He turned his attention back to Draco and watched as his eyes moved behind his eyelids. He wanted to squeeze Draco’s hand, to let him know that he was there, but he was worried that would be as much of an interruption as talking.
“Draco,” she said. “You of all people should know that I take
, each of the founders added their own touches to the castle.”
“I’m not one to judge,” Greg says. “But I would think that if you spent all night fucking, you should probably be on first name terms.”
“Because you don’t want to mess up our potion?” Confusion and hurt clouded her expression.
“I don’t know what I expected,
“Yes, you have. And now all those secrets and all that data are in your head.”
“Like fucking men, you mean?” Massi frowns and shakes his head.
“Very well, I will just change the ownership signatures then,” he says. He waves his wand over the watch face in a complicated pattern and then taps it once. “There. That should do it.” He releases Draco’s wrist and grins up at him. “You’re all set. Welcome to the Ministry of Magic.”
He knew what Ron wanted to talk about. It was a conversation he had been dreading from the moment his lips had touched Draco’s in the tunnel on the way back from Hogsmeade. Draco may have been worried what his father would think, but Harry was immediately worried about his friends’ opinions.
“-Didn’t he die?” Pansy asks.
my fault he died I tried to stop him. But I couldn’t…” she trails off, her lip suddenly trembling. She pulls herself together after a moment and her face turns hard again. “Look, I understand how you’re feeling. I’ve lost partners too. It’s shit. And I’m sorry for being insensitive.”
He stands up carefully, keeping his eyes fixed on the earring on the floor. It is purple and has an ornate bird carved into it. The bird is the symbol of the Simurgh Society, Draco now knows. A Simurgh, the Reliquary informs him (and any good Care of Magical Creatures book would also tell him) is a mythical bird, similar to a phoenix.
“And Potter’s bent too?”
“Welcome to my world,” he said. Draco brought up a hand and massaged his temples.
“Harry,” Ron says. “I know I haven’t been there in a while, but I know the Ministry has sensors.”
“-He’s on my team now.”
“And the Room of Requirement can be whatever you want it to be,” Harry said. “So we won’t mess up any party planning as it will just turn into a different room.” He looked around and noticed that everyone was staring at him. “What? It’s been a long week. I want to relax. And I would like to do it, with all of you.” He extended his arms wide to encompass the entire group.
“So you’re saying the kissing
“Do you need a real snake to speak Parseltongue?” Draco asked. “I can-“
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” he said as quietly as he could, but in the silence of Dumbledore’s office, the sound carried. At once, ink began to spread around the blank parchment and slowly the map revealed itself. They all crowded around the desk.
“Once we get it tidy,” Harry added quickly.
“So are you two friends now?” Harry looked up gormlessly and it was all Hermione could do not to laugh at his facial expression.
“Wait, what?” Harry asked. He was clearly missing something.
“Why don’t you cut in?” Draco asked. “If you like this girl, go get her. What are you waiting for?”
“It’s fine, Draco,” Harry said, reaching out an arm to pull him back down onto the sofa. “I’m used to it.”
“How about Thursday then?” Blaise suggested. “We can have our first training lesson in there.” Harry considered it for a moment before slowly nodding.
been kidnapped, I suggested we go back and let the parents know. But Hermione brushed it off - said that since the Swinns had said they hadn’t heard anything, there was no point in bothering them.”
“Merlin, Potter, did none of your friends teach you the proper spells? I ought to take ten points from Gryffindor just for that. What did you use? Scourgify?” Harry nodded. “And I suppose Poppy gave you a cream for that.” Harry nodded again. “That still does not explain why you are applying it here and now. Surely you could have used a restroom?”
“No,” Draco spat. “Were you not listening when I said I
“Well, I am the owner of Death’s invisibility cloak,” Harry says. McLaggen stares at him, so Harry adds “And with it, I mastered death.”
“To get some,” Blaise pointed out.
“I owe Seamus a beer,” Harry said.
“Would you,” he started and then faltered.
“Oh.”
Draco closed his eyes for a long moment and then his resolve hardened. He gripped the sword harder and then brought it crashing down on the Cup. It sheared neatly in two. The image of Harry gave a loud wail and disappeared.
“How?” But the rest of her sentence is cut off as Greg lifts her off the floor and places her feet over his. They are on eye level now and she arches an eyebrow at him. “This is rather forward, isn’t it?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Ron muttered, rubbing his arm.
“Why not?” Hermione asked.
“It’s a wonder you grew up so normal,” Draco says, adding a hint of sarcasm in an effort to lighten the conversation again. He had much preferred the flirting part of their conversation. He is rewarded by a small smile crossing Potter’s face.
“It takes a lot to worry me,” Greg says. “I’ve seen a lot.”
“Neville’s right,” Seamus chimed in. “If anyone had been paying attention to the pair of you, they would know something was going on.”
“That was my Hail Mary pass,” Harry says. Draco frowns at him, unsure of what the phrase means. “Right, that’s a muggle term, and an American one on top of that. It’s basically a very long pass in American football, typically made in desperation, with only a small chance of success and or time running out on the clock. Which is
“I was going to ask my friend Veronica to help us out,” McLaggen says. “But Potter wants you here just to make sure I haven’t picked anyone untrustworthy. Or someone who is overtly part of the Sim Soc.”
“How many people are you expecting?” he asked, walking over to the bar and plonking his bag down on top of it. Pansy shrugged and extricated herself from the booth the Slytherins were sitting in.
“What was that all about?” Draco asked after Harry emerged from Snape’s office. “You didn’t get in trouble, did you?”
She was oddly disappointed when Harry muttered the secret incantation so quietly that she couldn’t hear what is was, but she supposed he was entitled to keep his secret. When he stood back to let them all into the passage, she was the first to jump in.
“Who does a guy have to screw around here to get a drink?” Cormac asked. He looked up and caught Draco’s eye.
“Thank you,” Draco says.
“Why not?”
“It’s getting on,” she said. “It’s a long walk back in the tunnel and we wouldn't want to miss dinner.”
“Then how am I supposed to kill him?” Harry snapped. “If my blood keeps him alive?”
“So you followed me?” Harry nodded again. “Foolish girl.” Harry took a deep breath and squared his shoulders.
“I can’t believe you just did that,” Harry said. He was holding back giggles as he stared out at the dancing students. No one seemed to be staring in their direction. So perhaps Draco had actually pulled it off?
“Yes,” Draco said. “Because he’s a power hungry asshole who is trying to go about change the wrong way.”
Now where did that idiot brunet get to?
“I’ll teach you,” he says. “It will be a fun, “romantic” activity.” Harry notices that Draco uses air quotations when he says romantic, and he is grateful for that.
His shoes started to pinch his feet and his vision grew blurry. He reached up with hands that were now pale and slender and pulled his glasses off of his face, but this made it worse. Draco was more shortsighted than he’d let on. He put the glasses back on for the time being as without them he was almost entirely blind.
“Oh, Ron Weasley,” Pansy said. “What are we going to do with you?” She reached out and rested her hand on his cheek.
She looks up to see McLaggen staring at her.
“Draco! My favorite employee! My faithful assistant manager! I don’t think I have ever made a better decision than the one I did when I promoted you.”
“I didn’t,” Harry says quietly.
“I was more curious as to whether you had more details to your plan,” Draco said.
“You have manners?” Ron shot back. Draco glared at him until he realized that Ron was joking.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes,” he says eventually. “I mean, if that’s alright with you. It’s just if my parents find out that I prefer men from the newspaper, it is quite possible they will never speak to me again. Of course, that’s a possibility either way, but this fucking book is really forcing my hand now. And maybe this way, my mother will finally stop trying to set me up with various female family friends over holidays.”
“I, uh, threw myself in front of Harry when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named shot a killing curse at him.”
“Good.”
“I mean, yes, but I guess I didn’t expect-” Anger flashed in her eyes.
“Well done.” She reached over and picked her bookmark up and tucked it safely in her book. Then she stretched, raising her hands above her head. The book almost fell off of her lap, but she quickly swooped down an arm and saved it. “Is it dinner time?”
“Mistress Narcissa is not well.” Draco’s knees go weak and he leans more heavily against the wall, before giving up entirely and sinking down to the floor. Potter has made his way out of the dining room, curious, most likely, as to why Draco is talking on the phone in his entrance hall. His eyes go wide when he sees Draco on the floor.
“Snowdrops.”
“Malfoy, shut up,” Harry hissed.
“What do you think?” he asked. Draco’s eyes raked his body and Harry felt himself blush (which was ridiculous as Draco had now seen him naked many times).
“Damn it,” Draco said, looking around the room. “Is everyone here making out but us?” Harry followed his gaze around and had to admit, that it mostly appeared that way. Although, he couldn't tell for sure what Pansy and Ron were doing, as the only parts of them that were not wreathed in graveyard fog were their feet, but the positioning suggested that they were indeed playing tonsil Quidditch.
“And, well, damn hormones being what they are,” Harry started.
“You want another?” Pansy asked.
“Shit.”
“It is precisely that slip that I am concerned about, General.”
“Of course,” Harry said. “It’s being sold to the public. Plus, he gave me an experimental lotion yesterday and it fixed me right up. It was magic.” Ron continued to frown at him. “It was particularly magical magic that did wonderful things,” he added.
“Fine, take it,” Harry says, but he’s smiling. He leans in and pecks Draco quickly on the mouth and then apparates them back to Winola Swinn’s house. It is much the same as Harry had left it, except worse.
“Honestly, Blaise,” Pansy chided. “She’s just shy, you muppet.” Hermione was not sure this made it better, but she didn’t press the issue. Instead she took the shot that Pansy handed her and raised it to toast the pair of them. They clinked glasses and she sipped down half of the measure. She swallowed quickly and finished it, blushing at Pansy’s stare.
“Finally, someone who understands me.” Draco shrugged.
“Can we get off the subject of killing you for a moment?”
“From Beedle the Bard?” Draco had no idea where Dumbledore was going with this talk of a children’s tale. He wanted to know how he was dead but not dead and what that meant for him. And he wanted to ask about Harry.
“-I know and I don’t care.” Draco’s eyebrows slowly rise in surprise. His mouth falls open. Harry still hasn’t looked away and this is making Draco’s heart pound somewhere in the region of his throat. He swallows nervously, snapping his mouth shut.
“I— Ok.”
“Really?” Draco whines. “Now?” He looks at his watch. It’s gone nine.
He tries to run down the stairs, only to be impeded by the alcohol in his system. He stumbles down the last few stairs and falls heavily onto the landing, twisting his ankle on the final stair. His wand flies out of his hand and clatters away down the landing, out of reach. He suddenly feels quite sober.
“We don’t think so. Banks hasn’t heard anything from Dempsey’s office at least. All the conversations he’s stumbled across have been while he’s delivering things or fetching tea.” Pansy nods slowly. She takes a deep breath, willing her heart rate to return to normal.
“Are you asking if you can booty call Draco?” Blaise asked. He made a concerned face as he tried out the words ‘booty call’.
“Nightcap?” Greg asks. He does not wait for an answer but instead trudges up the stairs. Harry and Draco traipse behind him. Once they reach the living room, Harry sprawls across the closest sofa and closes his eyes. Greg catches Draco’s eye and the blond shrugs.
“And by real party, I assume you mean something that as a prefect I would normally have to turn a blind eye to?”
Harry was even more on edge as they made their way through corridors and up the stairs on the journey back to Draco’s room. He was hyper aware of the fact that he was carrying a horcrux in his purse. What if Voldemort showed up early? Could he sense when his horcruxes were nearby? It would stand to reason that he might since they were part of his soul. What would he do if they ran into him?
“Because I know what it’s called and how to get there and I don’t know what’s near where I currently live.”
“Right so how does this work?” Draco asks once they're locked in a stall in the club’s bathroom. Harry puts a finger up to his lips.
“No need,” she says. “Croaker has personally approved your acceptance into the program. Secretly, of course, as you will then progress to Unspeakable training, and, well, we don’t necessarily want people to know about your being part of the Department.”
“It looks that way,” Seamus said.
“What if we just told people we were friends?” he asked. Pansy shrugged and crossed her arms in front of her chest.
“I mean, it’s not like it’s a secret,” he said.
“Oh, fine,” he replies. “Yourself?” She shrugs.
“We’ve been summoned in to the office,” Harry says.
“Would I prefer if this were a real date?” Harry asks. “Yes, I would.” The words are out before he can stop them. Draco’s mouth drops open in surprise.
“Why not test it farther apart?” Hermione suggested. Harry nodded enthusiastically and then sprinted out of the room. He waited until he had run several corridors away and then whispered,
“That
Now there’s nothing left to do but wait for the polyjuice potion to wear off.
“We’re all able to do magic, you pompous ass,” Draco says. Harry narrows his eyes and glares at him.
“Do you have any better ideas?” Harry asked.
He changes the channel once he reaches the end of that segment, choosing instead to listen to music as he gets onto the M25. As he passes, he imagines he can see the tops of the rides at Thorpe Park, but really all he can see are trees. Blaise had taken Draco to Thorpe Park a few years ago and it had been a revelation. Of course, the Draco of seven years ago would never have deigned go to a muggle theme park, but the war had changed many people, not least of all Draco Malfoy. Though he’d been doubtful of the safety of the metal rides at first, he’d quickly found out that they were
“It’s nine thirty.”
“Make that two,” Massi says. Harry nods again and leaves.
“And you just said you didn’t
“So, it’s not as though I
“Yes, Ronald. And I’ve also broken plenty of them in my time here. How many times have we snuck out to see Hagrid after curfew? Or has Harry snuck out to Hogsmeade? Or has Seamus put fire-whisky in all of our mornings’ pumpkin juices?”
“Sometimes I intensely dislike you,” Draco says. Potter lifts one shoulder in a shrug. Draco takes another sip of wine.
“What has been your favorite thing so far?” Narcissa asked, breaking into Harry’s thoughts.
“So it’s that serious then?” she asked Draco.
“Yes, and it’s
The last thing he remembered was jumping in front of the killing curse that Voldemort had leveled at Harry. Was this the afterlife then? It seemed oddly blank and impersonal. He’d thought the afterlife would be more interesting.
“Uh,” Potter starts to say, but Pansy interrupts him.
Every lunchtime, he practices dueling with Pansy, and if Greg ever seems suspicious of Draco’s rumpled clothing (he falls over a lot, particularly the days he spends perfecting an advanced shield charm), Draco plays it off as having visited Harry in the ice cream parlor’s store room.
Sighing, she held out her hand and commanded a broom rise to it so that she could inspect what they would be riding. It appeared to be one of the school brooms, and she wondered how they had been acquired. But then, both Harry and Ron played Quidditch for Gryffindor, so she assumed they had “borrowed” them.
“That’s not what I-“
“We need to talk,” he says.
Harry took off running then, covering the ground faster than he thought he would. As he neared level with Ron, an idea took form in his mind.
He can hear shouts down the corridor and he knows his colloportus won't last for long once they reach the door. His mind casts around for the right person or coordinates to send the package to. He hears a fist slam on the door behind him and he jumps. There is a series of loud bangs as the hit wizards begin trying to break down the colloportus holding the door shut.
“Not an excuse,” she snaps.
Only now Harry has Massi’s trousers undone and is easing them down over his thighs. Massi’s boxers are tented out over his erection, which Draco is half surprised to see that he has. Perhaps he’s not as nervous as he seems. Draco quickly removes his own trousers - he’s done waiting for anyone else to disrobe him - and then Harry is the only one still mostly clothed. Draco makes quick work of that and then begins herding them towards the massive bed. They fall onto it in a tangle of limbs.
“Do you have a better one?”
“If you say so.”
Loathe as Harry is to admit that Draco is right about anything, he starts to find himself having fun.
“Not a chance.” He frowns. “The only thing I can think is that he was part of the original search for the Reliquary after Oliver stole it and he’s still asking around.”
It was the best Christmas Harry could remember, and that was in spite of their Christmas Day plans hanging over him. Perhaps it was because there were more people to exchange gifts with, or perhaps it was because they opened presents while drinking mulled wine (that had been brought to them as a surprise by a furtive Dobby). All he knew was that he felt warm and safe and loved. And the presents didn’t hurt either.
“Why does everyone always say that about me?” Ron grumbled. “I did just as well as Harry did in our O.W.Ls. Or, close enough.” He disentangled himself from Pansy and stood up. A frown crossed his face for a moment, then he smiled and pulled out his wand. “Expecto Patronum,” he cried. A silvery jack russell terrier burst from his wand. It landed on the floor and then ran happily around the room. The three Slytherins wore matching expressions of surprise.
“I did
“That much is obvious.” Draco continues to shuffle though his paperwork, mostly to have something to do with his hands. “To be fair, I didn’t know it was
“You know Greg’s very proficient at getting through those,” he mumbles as Harry grabs him by his hips and pulls him close.
“I’m gay,” he says again. “I like men. Er- in that way.” He should have started with some sort of preamble. But he’s said it now and he can’t go back and start this conversation over, as much as he would like to. Narcissa stands, walks back to the fireplace and rings the bell again.
“Can I help you find anything?” he asks, still sitting on the floor. The woman shakes her head and moves to one of the aisles where she starts perusing. Harry takes the opportunity to loudly say how innovative the book fort is, particularly because it highlights how books can be a shelter from real life when real life gets particularly tough. Because of course no one is going to call bullshit on the famous Harry Potter saying that.
“Mm, yes, that is a problem,” Draco said. They were lounging against a wall, looking out over all the students. Seamus had somehow procured a record player and was DJing from inside the basilisk’s ribs. Most people were dancing. Harry spotted Pansy and Ron twirling in the middle of the group, eyes only for each other. Hermione and Blaise were sitting together at a table, heads close, talking about something Harry couldn’t hear.
“Why not? It’s a party.” She leaves him and walks back to the bar. The previously grumpy house elf is animatedly bowing to Draco. Pansy sidles up to Draco and nudges him.
Images of McLaggen trying to figure out where the Reliquary has gone, because it didn’t end up in the safe house where Wood was supposed to go. Thoughts of “It must be with Potter.” A long stretch of McLaggen following Harry’s movements in his spare time. McLaggen asking Dempsey about the Reliquary investigation and getting nothing. McLaggen reporting back to his mysterious, hooded counterparts (why do all secret groups have to wear hooded cloaks?) that he doesn’t know where the Reliquary is and he’s sorry, but he’s still working to make sure that the Simurgh Society can't do anything. A long memory of the night McLaggen brought Harry and Draco in for questioning. The bodies on the floor. Blood everywhere. McLaggen questioning Draco.
“What was that?”
“Guests?” Draco asked. “Mother, you never mentioned there would be other guests. I thought it would just be you and Aunt Bella.” Narcissa gave him a tight lipped smile.
“Mm,” Draco said, pulling out his wand and taking off their disillusionment charms. “That somewhat dampens the mood.” Harry let him go, rolling his eyes as he did.
“The more I learn about this Reliquary,” McLaggen says. “The more I wish I had one.”
“Um Harry?” Draco lifted an eyebrow and stared at Harry..
“I fold,” Harry said, putting his cards down. They had been less than nothing, not even a pair. In fact, they were so bad, he almost wondered if someone was cheating, but as his hand before had been okay bordering on good, he did not actually think that was the case.
“Are you trying to get me drunk?” he asked. Draco said nothing, but there was a sparkle in his eye that Harry took to mean yes.
“Which brings us to your present.”
“No, it’s worse than that.” Harry’s eyes narrowed in concern. “I have to kill Dumbledore.”
“What would we do without you?” he asks breathlessly.
“Presumably you haven’t needed it your
“How are you Conan the Barbarian?”
“Are you planning on killing me?”
“I heard you joined the Auror force.”
“This is different.”
“He’s wrong, actually,” Seamus piped up. “It’s me. I’m the gatekeeper to the bar.”
“Yes?”
“Really?”
“I’m sure many of you have seen this morning’s paper,” Dumbledore began. His voice was soft, but it carried across the silent hall. “I wish that I could offer you more words of condolence. I wish I could take away your pain and your worry. I wish I could,” he paused and gave a small, sad chuckle. “I wish I could wave my wand and make it all better. But alas, I cannot.
Pansy had a hard time keeping the smile off of her face as she all but skipped to bed. Ugh, she was turning into a Hufflepuff.
“I need to tell you something too,” Draco said. The words came out in a rush. Harry nodded.
“What?” Draco watches as Potter’s eyes go wide. He stops pacing and runs a hand through his hair. “Right now? But Malfoy’s here… She what?… We’re going to have to what?… Quarantine together? Jesus, ‘Mione, I can’t—“ He pushes his glasses up and pinches the bridge of his nose. “It’s really as you suspected?… Fuck, the tests worked?… The Floo network too?… Oh Merlin, I hate that you were right about this… Of course I listened to you… Yes, enough for several months… Really? Them too?… Holy shit.” Draco pulls out his pocket watch. It’s near the time that he should be thinking about leaving. Perhaps he can slip out quietly while Potter is still talking to Granger and avoid the traffic. He begins to put papers back into his briefcase.
Hermione watched their back and forth and tried not to laugh. Seeing them this way put all their previous fights into a whole new perspective. She wondered, not for the first time, if Draco’s obsession with Harry had always been somewhat sexually charged. But now was not the time to wonder about this. Now was the time to help them hide their relationship from the rest of the school, and, more importantly, from the wizarding press. She cleared her throat to get everyone’s attention again.
“Exactly. They can hardly print mean things about me if I’ve literally just saved the wizarding world.”
“What did McLaggen want?” Pansy jumps in surprise and turns to find Greg behind her.
“If you say so,” Ernie said, eyes sparkling.
“A few times.”
“But don’t we both have to be dead?”
“Get stuffed,” Draco muttered.
“Dinner will be ready in about an hour.” But Draco’s already halfway up the stairs now and doesn’t respond.
“English, please. I’m not sure what you just said.”
“Of course. Why not?”
“Yes and no,” he says. Potter cocks his head to the side in confusion. “Well, because I was still in school when I joined, V thought it would be best to keep that fact a secret, so instead of a full mark, I just got a small snake tattoo.” He pulls up his sleeve and shows Potter the coiled silver snake on his left forearm. “This way if anybody asked, I could say that it was a House tattoo, or something like that.” Potter nods. “And then after…” Draco finds he can’t say it.
“And you can do that? Without magic?”
“It’s October,” he said simply. “You might want a coat.” And he reached over and pulled a coat off of the coat rack beside him and held it out to her. She accepted it with an apologetic smile. She swung it around her shoulders and then opened the door and stepped out into the night.
“But—“
“Come on,” he says. “Hermione’s going to do our full debrief now.”
He practically flies down the stairs and then skids to a stop in front of the door. He checks the hall mirror quickly and smooths down a stray hair. His reflection winks at him and he rolls his eyes at it. He tugs his shirt down one last time and then opens the door, in a way that he hopes looks casual and not like he is a giant ball of nerves.
has to kill him?” Blaise asked in a whisper. It was lunch time, and they were hurrying up from the dungeons after their Potions lesson, the six of them clustered together.
“He had realized that there were times when I could see into his thoughts,” Harry started to say.
“Harry, do you have that sketch of Ravenclaw’s diadem on you by any chance?”
He gets nothing for his efforts as the curtains are drawn, but he since he is up there, he holds the broom steady between his knees and pulls out his wand again. More diagnostic tests reveal that the room is heavily warded.
“And what would you know of the life of a ghost?” she snapped. But this time Blaise was prepared. He’d related his first conversation to Hermione and she’d had lots of pointers on how he could improve. She’d even told him about the “Death-day party” that she, Harry and Ron had been to their second year, which was the most exposure she had gotten to ghosts. That was proving helpful now.
“It’s an expression, Draco. But, the point being, I already have a costume picked out.” Draco pouted. He couldn’t believe no one wanted to dress up with
“Wine?” he hazards. “No, screw it, give me what Potter’s having. I mean Harry. His name is Harry.”
“But you didn’t hear it from me,” he said and winked at her. She didn’t respond. She was still processing what Dumbledore had just told her. She made a mental note to watch the pair more closely the next time they were in one of her classes. She supposed that dating was at least better than fighting all of the time, but now she would have the added worry of what might happen if they broke up. Their animosity had been bad before, but how might one of them react to a broken heart?
“Weirdly no.” They gathered up their clothes and Draco led them back to the Slytherin sixth year boys’ dorm.
“It was four years from now,” Harry said softly, wiping tears off of Draco’s face with his thumbs. “And we-“ his breath hitched, but from happiness, not despair. “And we were married.”
“So Thursday then?” Blaise suggested.
Her sister, Daisy, is on Bertie’s other side and Pansy wishes she would just blather on about her busy, vapid socialite life instead, but of course Daisy won’t do that. She’s far too interested in making sure Pansy’s Christmas is hell.
Perhaps the most shocking part of the whole thing was how natural it seemed to them. She chewed her lip. It was only a matter of time before someone else caught on. And then it would be in the Prophet, and then all their lives would be upended, she was sure of it. The gossip column witches were relentless. She would know - they had hounded her sister relentlessly after she had started dating Ulrich Svenson, whose main claim to fame was that he played for the the Falmouth Falcons.
. I’m not sure I would have caught them without the Reliquary’s help.”
,” Dumbledore said. Draco’s eyebrows shot up. Beside him, he heard Harry gasp.
“What’s that? Oh, yes. I suppose I do.” He glances at Potter as he says this. He’s not sure if Potter can hear what Healer Burlington is saying on the other end of the phone, but Potter had just said he should stay, so Draco’s going to assume that the offer still stands.
Harry enjoyed watching Draco open all the different parts of his present. He liked the way Draco’s face lit up with each new item that he unwrapped. And really, he thought, that was the best part of Christmas - making the people you loved happy.
“What if she says no?”
“The house. You wanted to redecorate it, did you not?”
“Before you say no,” he said but Dumbledore shook his head.
horcruxes.”
“How dare-“ McLaggen starts to get up.
“But I remember the ingredients. Mostly. And I know what it feels like to drink it.” Draco released Harry’s earlobe.
“I figured you would know,” Hermione said. “Because of, well.” She lowered her voice. “You know, Draco.” At the mention Draco, a thrill of excitement went through Harry.
“Maybe,” he admits.
In the meantime she peppers him with incessant questions, none of which he even acknowledges. She studies him while she talks. He has a plain face, which must be why he has been so successful at avoiding capture thus far. The only adjective she can think of to describe him is bland. He has mousy brown hair, mousey brown eyes and a mousy demeanor. He is utterly forgettable. And yet Draco had managed to capture evidence of Wise in the bookstore days before, observing Big Dick undoing the security wards. She is amazed, as she always is, at the power of the Reliquary.
“Trying to steal the Philosopher’s Stone,” Harry says. “Yes.”
“Shit,” Ron says. “Can’t believe you got me. I’ll just run and get it now.” Hermione reaches out and puts a hand on his arm.
“I suppose that’s fair,” Harry said. “But you might find him out there?” Seamus nodded absently.
you defeat him?” McLaggen asks. On the other side of the room, Pansy perks up.
“And everyone is waiting on us to bring in the Reliquary.” Harry’s shoulders slump. What he would do for another couple of hours of sleep. Then he straightens and nods.
“I don’t think anyone is going to notice us,” Draco said, voicing Harry’s thoughts.
“Or their fans,” Pansy agrees. “How do you know she was kidnapped?”
“Oh can they?” Harry caressed his way up to Draco’s waistband and then he slipped a finger under it.
“That’s better than me,” Harry grumbled. Draco cocked his head to the side in question. “Thirty first of July.” Draco snorted.
“I do. Or, rather, I did. Now, I’m not so sure.” Draco began to trace circles on the back of Harry’s hand with his thumb and Harry found some of his irritation melting away.
“What does that mean?” Pansy asks.
“-I don’t want to hear it.”
“Is it?” How had Draco missed this? He’s been busy, but surely he hadn’t been
“This is lovely,” Draco says once they’re up there. He crosses his arms in front of his chest and tugs his jacket closed to fend off the brisk March breeze.
He didn’t care about the rest of the students anymore. They were separate, in their own little world. And Harry’s attention extended as far as Draco’s bobbing head and the pleasure that was building as he moved. Harry bit his lip as his breathing sped up. He closed his eyes, concentrating only on Draco. He wanted to reach down and caress the blond’s head, but he was too scared of the cloak slipping to let go of it.
“What do you think?” Massi asks quietly.
“And you do?” he snaps.
“Draco, darling,” she says. “To what do we owe this pleasure?” She walks over to the fireplace and picks up a small bell. She rings it once to summon a house elf, who appears moments later with a loud
“Circe, Malfoy,” Severus said, interrupting the blond. “I don't need the details of your love life.”
“But I was working to get Death Eaters into the school.” It is a thing Draco regrets to this day.
For Harry, it was another almost perfect moment. He was surrounded by friends, in the place that he loved, and enjoying an excellent meal. When Draco leaned over the table to help himself to another helping of roast potatoes and then sat back down with his thigh flush with Harry’s, Harry couldn’t help it. A huge grin broke out on his face. Yes, tomorrow was looming over him and it was a terrifying prospect, but right now he was going to concentrate on the things making him happy.
“I need to know how stupid and reckless either of you might be if the other one gets in trouble,” she says. “How irrational is Draco going to be if something happens to you and vice versa?”
“I meant friends, but I suppose that’s true too.”
“And you kissed back.”
“You promised me you would fill me in when we got home,” Draco says. “I’m holding you to that. And you’re not tied down.”
“Oh,” Hermione says softly. “Oh Harry.”
“Yup,” he said. “You're my bitch.” Draco lifted an eyebrow at him and Harry hurried added that he was joking.
“Me?” Harry asked.
But when Ginny arrives ten minutes later, she is nothing but happy for Harry.
“I insisted Harry was wrong,” Ron says.
“The master called,” Kreacher croaked. He looked around the room, frowning. “But Kreacher does not see the master.”
“Last I heard,” Pansy says. “Switzerland.”
“But I think it’s our best shot at getting the Cup.” And on that, they all agreed.
“On the contrary, I enjoy it.”
“Right,” she says, suddenly coming back to the room. She lays both hands on the table. “We need to get you on the train tonight then.”
“No, I do not believe so. Not now that you have Mr. Malfoy’s protection.” They were interrupted at that point by the Voldemort-baby giving an almighty shriek. They all turned to look at it. Draco’s lip curled in revulsion. As they stared, the thing began to thrash around, its screams becoming louder and more desperate.
“And once you started, you couldn’t stop?” Draco nods and Dempsey sighs again. “That was quite the design flaw.”
“Thank you, Ron,” Draco said. “He also needs more than one pair of jeans.”
So now it is just the three of them in the Cooler. They are discussing Harry’s surveillance idea. Of course, Hermione’s pregnancy has thrown a doxy in the works as Harry refuses to put her in harm’s way.
“Yes, so what is going on?”
, Potter.”
Also fair warning: it gets a little raunchy in this chapter.
“I know you’re the reason Oliver is dead.” His voice is soft and his eyes are hard as he stares at her. Pansy sighs and shakes her head, suddenly serious. Draco feels like someone has poured cold water over his insides. He stops eating and stares at Pansy, not wanting to believe what Potter just said.
“Um.”
“Fine,” Pansy says. “We’ll wait.” She slumps down in her seat. Draco watches as she takes one of the rings off of her fingers and spins it on the table top. She’s clearly put out about Greg and her suggestions of going under cover and now of seducing a mark have him convinced their relationship is doomed. He wishes she would just rip off the plaster. But perhaps she’s waiting until after the holidays. No need to ruin Christmas, after all.
“Thank you.”
“Do you mind if I?” Potter asks, indicating the phone.
He settles instead on continuing to stare at the floor.
“If you are,” he says. He shifts slightly under Harry and sees a spasm of desire flash across Harry’s face again. And he knows he has him. He jerks his hips up and is rewarded by Harry’s raised eyebrow again.
“It’s not like that,” Harry protested.
“In the back,” George says. He jerks his head toward the door that lead to the stockroom before turning his attention back to the patron who is waiting by the till.
“What the hell does that mean?”
“Until you sent him galavanting off to Europe.”
“I meant Hit Wizards. Greg is suspicious enough as is.”
“Now that we’ve destroyed most of the remaining horcuxes-“
“Oh, I love to dance. But up until about five minutes ago, all I wanted to do was sulk and drink whisky.”
“Not on me,” he said. Pansy made an annoyed face.
“No reason,” Greg says quickly.
“Why not?” Anger flares in his chest. He’s perfectly capable of imitating Hermione in an undercover mission.
Also yes, I am posting this a day early. I am traveling tomorrow (for my birthday!), so I wanted to make sure it was posted before then.
“Hannah told me the whole DA is invited,” Dean adds, his face lighting up. Harry grins.
“Yes,” Draco said. “And I thought we would invite Blaise as well.”
“Well, Draco wanted to call you Beaver,” Harry said. They moved to walk single file as they made their way down the stairs to the dungeons, Hermione in the lead.
“Are you ok?” he asked. Harry took a deep breath and nodded. The pain in his head was such that he could ignore it, so ignore it he would. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand and they continued walking. As they neared the set of double door at the end of the corridor, Harry felt Draco grip his hand harder and he knew that Draco was just as scared as he was. At least they had each other.
“So does this party continue after dinner?” Harry asked, changing the topic.
Greg is delighted to learn that Harry has learned the rules of Exploding Gobstones Snap and after dinner they retire to the living room for a lively round. But even after several Manhattans (one of which Greg had to down, even though it had been newly mixed), Greg stays silent on the topic of Pansy. So Draco only has the smile that plays around Greg’s lips as he talks about her to go on. And that tells him that they had a good time together, even if it tells him nothing else.
“No,” Harry admitted. “But it will be fine. We’re almost there as is.”
Draco looked for a moment like he was going to argue, but then sighed and walked through the new door. Harry scurried after him, happy to be leaving the awkward situation at long last. He was quite sure he was not going to get the image of a topless Pansy out of his head for a while, and not for the reasons most other teenage boys might have. But there was no way he could tell Ron about it, because it would likely upset him. But then, perhaps Ron was the reason Pansy was so seemingly sexually frustrated in the first place? Either way, now was
“Or, more accurately, Hermione did and Ron and I watched.”
“I'm not going to use the Honeydukes tunnel,” Draco said.
Pansy picks up her drink and walks towards the back of the pub. McLaggen follows her. Once they are settled in a booth at the very back of the empty VIP room, she turns her attention to him.
“Tell me everything you know,” Pansy says, laying her hands flat on the table. McLaggen briefly lifts his eyebrows, but then seems to understand that this really is a working lunch and that she is here for that reason alone. He nods once.
“I just—“ Draco started to say. He cut himself off, frowning and biting his lower lip. After a moment, he continued, “I don’t want to lose you.” Harry wanted to promise that that wouldn’t happen. But he couldn’t. Harry of all people knew that things could go wrong. Instead, he decided,
“What’s that?” Draco turns back to Harry.
“Oh, don’t tell me you’re going to tease him about this,” Draco said, smirking at Ron. “Say it isn’t so, Weaselby.”
“This is amazing,” Harry says as soon as he finishes his latest mouthful of food. Draco beams at him.
“Magic.”
Presently they reached a spiral staircase and Luna dropped his hand as they climbed it. The staircase ended in a door with no handle and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. Luna reached out and knocked once. The eagle opened its beak and spoke in a musical tone.
“Great,” Ron said. “It’s a date.”
“To Halloween!” Dean cried, holding his shot glass up in a toast.
He ought to have guessed, but Draco was spot on with his measurements. Everything that the blond had picked out fit him like a glove. And looking in the mirror, Harry had to admit that he looked good. In fact, it he looked better than good: it was the best he had ever looked. He walked out to show Draco.
“Do whatever feels natural,” Harry says. Their waiter comes back with the receipt and he spends a few moments figuring out the tip. He is a bit surprised at the total, but then he looks over at the stack of plates that Malfoy has made his way through and it makes sense. As he is signing the check, he feels a hand on his leg. The pen veers off the paper and onto the table as he starts in surprise.
“Can I come in?” Potter asks at last. Draco all but slaps a hand to his forehead.
,” Draco says, even though he himself has.
“Poor lowly Potter,” Draco said, smirking at him. “The pleb.”
“You just wish you were so lucky,” he says, opening his eyes again. “I already told you, not on the first date.”
dining after all.
“So be quieter.” Draco smirked and then leaned in and captured Harry’s lips again. Harry soon realized it was useless to protest. Instead, he tried to move them slowly towards a darker corner of the cellar, on the off chance that an employee came down the stairs.
“They’re perfect for it. No one can walk in unannounced,” she continued on as if he had given her a proper response.
“Yes sir,” Harry said.
“Have you told Pansy?” he asked.
“Should we perhaps add name tags?” Harry’s frown deepened while he thought about it.
“Anytime.” She walks out of the store. Harry wastes no time in opening the door to the Cooler and running downstairs.
“Make sure not to over-mix it,” Ron said.
“I can look after myself,” Draco protests.
“Did he?” Pansy hadn’t been there (for which she is still ashamed), but she’s heard many first hand accounts and none of them seemed to say that Potter had ‘gotten lucky’. In fact, he’d made a long, drawn out speech before Voldemort’s spell had backfired, killing him. From all accounts, Harry had known exactly what he was doing.
“Nothing,” Massi says.
“So, uh,” Blaise stuttered. “Last weekend, so before you and I were anything, uh, Pansy and I.” He paused and tried to swallow, but his mouth was dry.
“You and me both,” Harry said. He resisted reaching out and taking Draco’s hand. Barely. His hand twitched with the effort of keeping it still.
“Don’t let-“ Draco almost says Pansy but corrects himself at the last minute “-Pansy’s sister, Daisy, hear you say that.” Greg looks puzzled for a moment before nodding and Draco is worried that Pansy is going to have to confund him again.
“Show off,” he says. Draco grins. His face is flushed from the cold and if Harry weren’t so upset about being stuck where he is, he would have found it charming. But Harry is stuck and he is frustrated and he’s starting to think that skiing just isn’t for him.
ok; he was just nervous.
“It’s delicious,” Draco said. “I promise.” He was right. Somehow the ingredients blended together in a way that made it hard to taste the alcohol.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Narcissa says. “You’re Draco’s boyfriend.” Harry blushes, touched by their inclusion of him into their holiday tradition.
“And on top of that,” Draco says, ignoring Harry’s comment. “It was Muggle abuse.”
“Oh, you dear innocent boy,” Parkinson says, reaching out to pat Malfoy condescendingly on the head. “The Unspeakables and the Hit Wizards historically don’t get along, despite being in the same department. Dempsey has been gunning for me to bring you in since that damn book went missing so that we could claim you as ours, and I’m sure Saul Croaker has been hoping the same of Potter.”
“I don't know about finally,” Draco says, looking at his watch. “I was only gone for an hour.” Harry waves his comment away.
“Indeed.”
“Malfoy,” Potter says between chuckles. “That’s a vacuum.”
“By any chance, do you have tea?” Draco asks. “Only I don’t like coffee much.” Potter’s eyes leave the bag of coffee and settle on Draco.
“Thank you,” he whispered.
He was starting to lose track of who knew about them. Neville, Colin and now Justin? Blaise and Hermione were right. They really
“Well, long story short, I’m a coward and I begged them to stop, saying I would do anything if they left her alone. Which brings us to where we are now.”
“With enough preparation,” he said. “It might work.” Snape stood, mouthing wordlessly for a moment before he gathered himself.
“What if these books magically shelved themselves?” Harry asks, pulling out his wand.
“Merlin, don’t get your knickers in a twist,” McLaggen says, but he performs the cooling charm anyway.
Harry is no longer sure what he is doing. Or, rather, he is, but his traitorous heart (libido?) is leading him astray. He should be more professional on this mission. He needs to wine and dine Malfoy so that he can learn about The Reliquary. And yet, here they are, having this deep discussion about the War and their childhoods.
“Yes,” Pansy said. They sat in silence for a long few minutes, Pansy grinding her teeth and Blaise trying very hard not to think about the fact that Pansy was still mostly naked next to him.
“Well, at least that explains it,” he said. Draco nodded.
“I hadn’t thought about that,” he says finally. “I guess we’ll have to play that one by ear.” Draco nods. He’s not sure what made him ask the question in the first place.
“Horcrux?” McGonagall sat down and gripped arms of her chair so hard that her knuckles turned white. “Polyjuice?” Dumbledore frowned and turned his head towards Snape.
“I’m about to make dinner,” Potter says. Draco turns to look at him. He’s leaning against the doorframe, backlit by the hall light. “Did you want any?”
, the note read. Harry clapped a hand to his mouth and looked guiltily over at Hermione. She raised her eyebrows and rolled her eyes before returning to her potion.
“But that sounds wrong,” Malfoy says without pause and Harry realizes that it does. And that he has been referring to Malfoy in his head as Malfoy the entire time. Fuck. Should he change that? He tests out the name Draco in his head. It doesn’t sound as strange as he had expected.
“I’ll ask Kreacher and Dobby to help,” Harry said.
“Ron, she gave you a blowjob earlier today. I think that indicates she likes you.”
“Well, what do you want to do then?” Ron snapped. Pansy put a comforting hand on his arm.
Draco stands near the registers, watching as the flood of people moves through the store. Not for the first time he thinks about the flyer up on the wall of the break room, advertising the assistant manager position. It has been unfilled for several years now and Big Dick wants to put a change to that. Draco knows that more than anything, Big Dick wants an official person that he can push unwanted work onto. Draco resolves that if today goes off without a hitch that he will apply for the position. And then he knows that as soon as he has decided that, there will be problems.
“I’m nervous too,” he admitted.
“Harry found a secret passageway that leads from a room on the seventh floor to just above Aberforth’s fireplace.”
“So he can sleep with her and then never contact her again?” Bones sticks her nose in the air. Draco turns to glare at McLaggen, who shrugs.
“No,” Harry said, stowing his Firebolt back in his trunk.
“Not necessarily, but you can cast stabilizing spells, same as you might for a broom.”
“So that’s a yes then,” Greg says with a grin. Draco plasters a similar smile on his face, wondering what he has gotten himself into.
“Divination is a very wibbly wobbly practice of magic.”
“Do you
“Merlin, this is strange,” Draco said. “You as Pansy, I mean. Curves in all the least expected places.” He extricated one of his arms and picked up some Floo powder. He threw it into the fire, said “Malfoy Manor”, and then they both stepped into the emerald flames.
“My roommate, Greg, and my best friend, Hannah, who is bound to have told her boyfriend, And, knowing Ernie, he has told anybody who will listen,” he says because it is true.
“You’ve run out of adventurous places for us to have sex in?” Harry asked.
“That’s not good enough, McLaggen. You say you’re on this special task force, or whatever you want to call it, to prevent another secret group from doing whatever bad things you say they’re trying to do-“
“But why?” Draco asked again. He was not going to let this go. Pansy pulled her shirt over her head.
He gasps as Harry wraps his mouth around the head of his cock, which had taken very little time to get hard. He is briefly disappointed when Harry lets him free, but it is only so that he can shift from a crouch to a proper kneel. Then Harry’s hands are on his arse and his head is bobbing up and down and Draco has to grip the boxes behind himself so as not to fall over.
“We were married,” Harry continued. “And you were an Auror and I was seemingly a chef. Or I owned a restaurant? I couldn’t quite tell. But Hermione and Blaise were married too - I saw their wedding photo on the mantlepiece. And we were happy. God, Draco, we were so happy.”
“Just keep walking around, Harry,” Hermione said.
She felt oddly possessive of Ron. How could she not? They had been best friends since they had all started at Hogwarts. And, in the way of any teenage girl who is friends with a boy, she had briefly thought about them dating. She’d had similar thoughts about Harry, but that was clearly never going to happen.
So sorry for the delay - the holidays were a busy time!
“It was all planned. They recovered a horcrux from Malfoy Manor,” Snape said. McGonagall turned her incredulous stare to him. “Potter was dosed with Polyjuice potion and so appeared to be Pansy Parkinson for the entirety of their visit.”
“Between friends,” she says.
“I don’t think this bet should still count,” Lucius says. “We made it
Not for the first time, she wonders at the decision to send the pair of them into the field on an isolated mission. The timing seems... strange. Particularly as she looks more closely at the papers and an idea starts to form in her head. She pulls the map that Cormac showed her closer to her and stares at it.
“What is this?” Draco asks Lucius, walking up to him and waving the parchment in his face.
“Like hell you are. This is my job.”
“So you’ll show Draco Malfoy, but you won’t show me?”
He felt like his whole body was on the edge of orgasm and each touch from Draco brought him closer. Draco, sensing this, broke off of kissing him for a moment to growl,
“Um, guilty as charged,” Harry says, putting on a mock ashamed face.
“Hi,” Draco said, sidling up to Harry.
“Oh,” the Grey Lady said. “It’s you again.” Blaise winked at her.
“How about you, ‘Mione?” Ron asked. “What are you thinking about for your costume?” Hermione tilted her head from side to side and played with her fruit salad while she thought about it.
“Master Draco?” she asks. “Since when did you have a house elf?”
approved their plan, they still had to use the Honeydukes tunnel to get into Hogsmeade as the gates would still be shut. Harry assumed that it had something to do with plausible deniability.
At the sound, Professor Snape swept into the hallway. He took one look at the mess - Harry on the floor, papers and ink everywhere, and Draco standing against the wall with his arms crossed, looking smug. Harry looked up sheepishly.
“Yes,” Cormac says. “She arrived home this morning.” Pansy shifts her weight slightly, opening her knees more and Cormac takes the opportunity to pull her leg up and over his, sliding along the sofa cushions until his hip is pressed up next to her. He pauses there, his eyes questioning. She nods almost imperceptibly even though a part of her is telling her that this is a bad idea. But that voice is quickly drowned by whisky and hormones.
“It’s ok if you want to have time with your lover.” Draco bites his tongue so as not to laugh at Lovegood’s use of the word lover. “Mine is downstairs.”
“You could always be the Vanessa to my Austin,” Seamus suggested. “You would look great in that silvery mini-dress.” Hermione laughed, blushing. “And Ron could be Dr. Evil.”
“You haven’t finished wining and dining me yet,” Malfoy says with a smirk. “We’ve only done the wine part.”
Presently Dobby returned and Draco spent the next five minutes mixing up the “Draco surprise” for everyone (1 part rum, 1 part tequila, 2 parts orange juice, 2 parts cranberry juice and a squeeze of lime) and handing them around. Hermione eyed hers nervously.
The house is in Islington, so Draco takes the Marylebone flyover and keeps going until he reaches Pentonville Road. Then he slips his wand out of his pocket, taps the car’s GPS system and says,
“I would ask the same of you, but I assume the reason is that it has never occurred to you.”
“Fine,” Draco says. “You fixed me right up. Thank you.” Harry leans down and presses a kiss to Draco’s forehead. “Where’s Massi by the way?” Harry shrugs.
“In which case, Potter, I think you can handle our precious Draco until Tuesday while I get caught up on paperwork and sleep.”
“You can’t.” Potter’s so insistent about this that he grabs Draco’s sleeve as he makes to leave.
“Oh, it’s an old family favorite.”
“If he’s straight,” Cormac says.
“So, not a murder-suicide?”
“Oi,” Ron said again. “I’ve gone shopping with Harry before.”
But it didn't take him long to get over his surprise and instead get very into the kiss. Before either of them could think about the situation much, they were pressed together, hands roaming across torsos and tongues battling for real estate. Until, of course, Harry began to get too excited and instead ran cringing to the sofa, clutching his nether regions.
He feels like he should start some sort of conversation, but his mind is coming up empty. So he sits and twiddles his thumb until the bill arrives. He fumbles in his pocket for his wallet, and his elbow brushes Malfoy’s arm. In spite of himself, a thrill goes through Harry’s stomach. Fuck, but that’s not helping anything. Nothing can happen, aside from what they have to pretend to the rest of the world.
“Veritaserum?” Harry asks. “Are you saying alcohol alone won’t do?” Massi gives him a withering look.
“Liar.”
“Finite incantatum,” he cries and flops back onto the sofa. He scrambles upright and glares at Draco. “I can walk, you know.” Draco shrugs.
“What’s the punch in the face for?” Harry asked.
“Oh dear,” Hermione said. “I’ve seen that look before.”
“Kreacher?”
“Can you close the door?” Blaise snapped. He sounded more irritated than embarrassed to Pansy’s ears. She glared at him. This had all been his idea.
“Are you nervous?”
“Not that we know who any of them are,” Draco says.
“I fucked him,” Draco says and Harry feels like the bottom has fallen out of his stomach. He fights to keep his face impassive even as his heart feels like it is being clenched in a vise. “I’m so sorry,” Draco continues. “It was the only thing I could think to do.” And so Draco relates the story of how Massi had confessed that Draco was an enemy of the family and how Draco had come up with a plan to say that the Malfoys wanted their families to work together. Then one thing had led to another and-
“Is there anything I can do at this precise moment?” he asked.
“He’s got a point,” Ron said. “I’ve been practicing my swagger. I would like to use it.”
After he’d left the kitchen earlier, Draco had gone off to sulk in the library. He’d stayed there for a good twenty minutes, sprawled on one of the tufted, leather couches, as though he were a victorian lady going through a fit of the vapors. Had he been needlessly dramatic? Possibly, but
“The lovely Ms. Parkinson has stayed over quite a few nights now,” Kreacher informs them. Harry catches Draco’s eye, raises his eyebrows and smiles. “I have assisted in washing her clothes.” He lists off their sizes and Draco scribbles them onto a piece of parchment that Harry has pulled out of his pocket. Kreacher then offers to take the bags that Harry is carrying home.
“Oh my,” Hermione said. “What are we supposed to do with all of this?”
“I meant a cover date,” Harry says tersely.
“Correction,” Hermione interjected. “We were waiting either for you or one thirty, whichever came first.”
cursed my dick off, not that I actually did. It’ll heal, though right now it is
“I work here now.”
He makes one last stop at his house to pick up his invisibility cloak. If he’s going to be performing any magic in Muggle London, he wants to stay out of sight. And, he thinks, if the Simurgh Society are watching the location where Hermione is being held, he doesn’t want to be seen.
“You alright?” he heard Ron yell.
“Hermione’s booked us for an exclusive interview with Witch Weekly at eleven. You know, to announce that we’re dating. I imagine they will want to take lots of pictures.” This gets Draco’s attention. He sits up and it is only as he does so that he realizes Harry has brought him breakfast in bed. A tray hovers behind the brunet and Draco can smell both coffee and bacon. His stomach rumbles.
“Why?”
“-Just misled.” Potter puts his wine glass down and leans forward, elbows on his knees. “I mean, who the fuck knows who they are at sixteen? I sure as hell didn’t.” Draco works to keep his face impassive as a flood of emotions - relief, curiosity, gratitude - washes over him.
“You did tell him I’d had my teeth fixed, right?”
“Permanent Sticking Charm,” Potter says with a rueful smile. “Trust me, I’ve tried.” Draco stares at Potter for a long moment. Potter is looking into his coffee like it holds the answers to all the questions of the universe.
“Ew,” she said. “But well done.”
“I’m aware,” Draco says. “But right now, you get to have the monopoly on crying and feeling sorry for yourself.” He pulls Harry back down until his head his resting on Draco’s shoulder again.
“I thought it would be more complicated.”
“Great. Let’s go then.”
“However, the way I see it,” Tusneem continues. “Your work will need to stay a secret. You are far too valuable of an asset for the general public, and more specifically, the general criminal public, to know who you are.” Malfoy nods slowly. He had to have been expecting that. Harry wonders how he would feel if he knew he couldn’t go back to his old life, to his friends, to his job.
Draco and his fellow Slytherins sauntered into dinner twenty minutes later and Harry breathed a sigh of relief. Despite them living in the same castle, Harry wasn’t sure how to get a hold of Draco aside from in person. He wasn’t sure if owls could reach the Slytherin common room after hours, they way they could in Gryffindor Tower. It was something he was going to have to ask about. Instead, he begged piece of parchment off of Hermione, who was surprised to know that he had figured out she always had parchment paper and quill on her, and scribbled a quick note to Draco. He spelled it across the Great Hall and then watched as Draco read it.
“Knew what was coming and was already dying. He would have died with or without you.”
“Mmph, where are you going?” Harry asks, squinting up at Draco in the early morning light.
“I see,” Harry says. Draco catches his eye and gives him a look of
dark magic indeed, and wondering if Potter knew what horrors his library contained. But then, Potter had been brought up by muggles, so how would he know that “Stadler’s Syllabary”, “Unspooling Rituals”, or “Dreams of Force” contained the blood magic that they did?
“I don’t know, but we could go to the one near my old house.”
“You think I can’t handle them?” Pansy asks in a tone that suggests she takes this as a challenge.
“And if we have a proper plan for protecting the younger students,” Snape added. Dumbledore nodded.
“So that’s a no?”
“It’ll come.”
“Oh like that’s ever stopped me,” Draco scoffed. “Harry, it would make me very happy to spoil you, so please let me do it.”
? We only have a few days to come up with something.”
Ron and Hermione have a washer and dryer. When they had moved in, Ron had excitedly showed Harry how all the buttons worked while Hermione had looked on and rolled her eyes. On top of that, the laundromat is much closer to Wizarding London than any of the previous places and it’s also a dingier street than any of the others. Not that dingy necessarily means there are bad things going on, but it seems to be the kind of place where a stray yell or loud noise would not be amiss.
“Seriously? That’s your tactic?” Greg looks sheepish. “Do you even know what my rank is? I’m a Major. You can’t pull that kind of shit on me.”
“Really? You think Dumbledore’s going to enforce homework when we’re working on horcruxes?” he asked.
“No,” Draco forces out. He bites the inside of his cheek to distract him from the growing nausea. He concentrates on compartmentalizing again, forcing himself not to think about Green, but rather to think about innocuous things like what he had for breakfast this morning.
“Harry,” Ron said, putting a hand on his shoulder. “I wouldn’t call my mum’s jumpers ‘nice’. They are comfy, not fancy.”
“Speaking of my friends, can we bring Seamus to the Halloween Party?”
“I would say so,” she says. She stands a short way away from the booth. She crosses her arms and stares at him.
“Did you two have another fight?” Neville asked.
“Ah, crap,” Pansy said. “This means I owe Blaise two galleons. I had bet this would happen much farther into the term.” She walked over to the seating area in front of the fire and threw herself down into one of the chairs. Ron, after a moment’s hesitation, joined them as well, and Harry and Draco sat back down, albeit on separate seats.
“Well, nothing now,” Pansy mumbled. She glared up at Draco.
. And he’s still not over their conversation from this morning. Circe, was that only this morning?
there.
“Don’t be silly, Harry,” Ron said. “The house elves don’t deliver them until Christmas morning.”
“You mean you don’t want people to come into the common room in the morning and find us like this?” Harry asked. He sat up, disentangling his arms from Draco’s.
He sighed and trudged up to the Boys’ Dormitory, pulling off his jumper as he did. He pulled off his tie and tossed it, and the jumper, onto his bed. Then he took stock of himself in the mirror. He wondered if he could get away with just wearing this shirt and trousers. It almost looked like it wasn’t part of a uniform? Except that everyone would know at a glance that that was what it was. He bent over his trunk and rifled through his clothes.
“Very well,” Granger says. “What if you worked at Florean Fortescue’s?”
“—I get it,” Draco says. “It’s so hard to find good help these days.” He flashes Potter a smirk, only to get a glare in return.
“No,” he said quickly. “I just thought you wanted…” He chewed at his lip in concern. She smirked at him again.
“Fair,” he says. They lapse into silence. Pansy’ notices that her whisky and soda water is empty.
“Master Regulus.”
“If it’s a suicide, why are you bringing it up?”
“No,” he says, his words clipped in irritation. “I told you, I think a wizard did it.”
“You know, there are better ways of asking your boyfriend on a night out,” Draco grumbles.
form of transportation,” Potter points out, a sly smile creeping onto his face.
“Why did you stop?” Draco asked. His whispered voice sounded particularly breathy to Harry.
As he tunes back into the conversation again, he hears Potter say, “We could get take away?”
Draco thinks.
Blaise spent all of Saturday trying to talk to the Bloody Baron using sign language that Hermione had taught him. He wasn’t sure if the Baron couldn’t understand him or if he just didn’t want to help, but it turned out to be a dead end. And so he spent Sunday trying to find Helena Ravenclaw instead. He and Hermione finally tracked her down in the fourth floor corridor outside of the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom.
“What’s your theory though?” Draco asked. “I assume you have one.” Dumbledore sighed.
“Why not? Liquor them up and ask them questions. Who knows, maybe there’s another amazing Ravenclaw object that
“I’m sorry, what?” Neville’s face turned bright red.
“Shall we?” Draco asked, reaching out to the door handle. Harry felt a thrill of excitement rush through him. Not even the world’s most awkward encounter had changed his mind about what he wanted to do with Draco. His boyfriend. Even just the word boyfriend excited him. Harry nodded and followed Draco through the next door.
“And you’ve been right before too,” Pansy says gently. She twists her mouth to the side and frowns. Then she seems to come to a decision because she nods her head once. “We’re going to go out there and tell them we didn’t find anything.” Behind Pansy, Draco’s shoulder’s slump. Pansy must see this in the reflection of the window because then she says, “Oh get over it, Draco. You can impress our boss another time.”
“Blaise’s,” he said with as conviction as he could muster.
“Exactly,” Harry said.
“We haven’t gone on a date.”
“Unsafe?” Draco shrugs. “Possibly, but it’s only this fireplace and it was getting hard to remember which of the house elves were and were not already allowed to bring us food from my parents.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Stuff?”
“And we’re still?”
“So,” Massi says, swinging his arms awkwardly. “How does this work?”
“Mm, yes. Same to you.” Draco pressed his lips to Harry’s and they lost themselves in each other for a long moment before Draco pulled away. “I have another present for you.”
“Are you telling me you fucking read it?” Malfoy audibly gulps.
He takes his time unbuttoning Harry’s shirt and when it falls open, he runs his hands down Harry’s stomach so gently that he makes the other man shiver. He starts to move them more onto the bed, but realizes that his shoes are still on. He quickly kicks them off, and then lays Harry down and presses himself flush against him.
As he passed Kreacher, an idea struck him. He pulled Regulus’s locket out of his pocket and knelt down next to the elf.
“Twenty four hours?” Potter nods. “What am I supposed to wear to bed? I’m in a bloody three piece suit.” Potter’s mouth twists to the side as he thinks.
“I don't know, Ron,” he said at last. “I don’t know what to think.” Ron shrugged.
“They were
“Oh,” Bones exclaims, her cheeks turning pink.
“That’s better,” he said, putting them on.
“Who names a wand a Deathstick?” Pansy asks. “Men… Everything is about power and penises.” She rolls her eyes. The others shush her.
“By any chance, would you like to get some lunch?” she asked. She glanced down at her watch. “I know it’s a little past lunch time, but it looks like the house elves have a table spread for stragglers.”
“Precisely.”
“She’s seemed rather stressed at work,” Harry says, backpedaling. Really, right before Christmas is not the time to ask if your best friend’s wife has perhaps been kidnapped and replaced by an imposter. Unless, in fact, she has been, in which case they should try to get her back
“I think they’re new,” Draco says. “Like, it’s updated itself.” The book flaps its cover at him and he nearly drops it in his shock.
All things considered, he feels quite well rested. Or at the very least, he is not as tired as he was the day before, even though he didn’t get all that much sleep. More than anything else, he feels hungover, although the shower did help with those feelings a bit. Potter must notice this, because a hangover potion lands in front of him a moment later. He looks up. Both Potter and Pansy are holding similar potions, which makes him feel a bit better, although he hadn’t thought Pansy’d had that much to drink. Potter raises his potion in a toast. Draco picks his up, motions clinking in the air and then downs the liquid in one. Then he takes a quick sip of his coffee to get the bitter aftertaste out of his mouth. He shudders and makes a disgusted face.
Meet Agents Blond Unicorn, Stinger and Esmerelda in the Room of Requirement (RoR) at 1200 hours (12pm). As discussed yesterday, we will be working on figuring out the remaining horcruxes.
“Right,” she says. “With Harry and Draco that will make seven.”
“What?”
“Hermione said it was good wine,” he mumbles, shoving his hands into his pockets. He turns and begins to pace the length of the living room.
“Does this mean you joined our group costume?” Draco was far more excited about this than he would have expected to be.
“Don’t be,” he says. “I can’t think of a better person to pretend to date.” Draco frowns at him but doesn’t say any more. “Look, should we just get dinner instead?”
“Come on,” Harry says. “Let’s get you into this costume.” He picks up the trousers and walks over to Draco. He holds them out and stands steady as Draco braces himself on his shoulder and clambers inelegantly into them. Then he buttons Draco into his jacket and slips boots onto Draco’s feet. When he’s done, he stands back to look at him.
“Huh?”
“Nice to meet you,” Draco says. He holds out a hand, but she wraps both of her arms around him instead, hugging him the way she had hugged Harry.
“Classic Malfoy,” Ron says with a chuckle. Harry feels a pang of guilt over this as Draco had been instrumental in bringing in the Battaglias, but he has to keep Draco’s cover intact so he doesn’t say any more.
“Preferably somewhere where we can talk without fear of people overhearing,” Potter adds.
They found Hermione in the common room, reading a book. She was so engrossed in it that she did not look up until Ron put a hand on her shoulder. Then she gave a start and looked around, noticing them for the first time.
“Can we go to the VIP section, Hannah?” Pansy asks as Hannah hands over McLaggen’s drink. After the Halloween party, a few weeks ago, Pansy has decided that she likes Hannah and has gone out of her way to visit her at the Leaky Cauldron. They are now comfortably on a first name basis, which is more than she can say about McLaggen.
