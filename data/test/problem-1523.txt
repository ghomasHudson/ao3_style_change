This time, featuring OP Severus that could actually throw like 10 trolls with the wave if his finger, and a George who knows that and wouldn't actually force our favourite potions teacher if he actually didn't want it.
It was nice seeing him be himself after what they had gone through.
"Th - this doesn't mean I've forgiven you for forcing me without telling me anything, just so you know!"
If one paid attention, they could see the subtle strings of magic intertwining, dancing in myrth as the red string between their Souls glowed, unseen by the mortal eye.
Ginny had soulmate in Pansy Parkinson, and they were happily chatting about fashion.
George used  this and started kissing him again, sliding his tongue into his crush's mouth. He found himself unable to break the kiss this time.
As soon as he saw the deliquent, Severus paled and got up, as far away from said ginger as he could. "Weasley! You got detention again?! F- fifty points from Gryffindor!"
Severus told the Fat Lady to bring George to the hallway.
"You aren't planning another prank, are you?" He asked.
When George came into the detention classroom, Severus was scribbling something on a piece of parchment.
me on finding my soulmate."
Deciding to see what's going on, he decided to use Harry's little secret to spy on uncle Sev - this would be interesting.
As he caught a whiff of Harry's smell, Draco spread his white, angelic wings to their full size, which was, needless to say, impressive.
"So you could have easily thrown me off if you wanted to! As if I would actually force you if you really didn't want to!"
the soulmate bond strengthening.
Perhaps because he had been caught the last time and knew that George knew he wasn't truly resisting anyway.
He bit Severus's neck possessively and enjoyed the barely noticeable inhale of his professor. He started undressing them and exploring the raven's body with his tongue while holding him firmly in place. He savored the taste and the way Severus bit his lip to prevent himself from outwardly reacting.
"I'm not. I just remembered promising mom to cut my hair this week. And I can't go on a date, I have detention."
Harry had been dreading that day. When his soulmate told him the previous day, he almost fainted.
He was a virgin, he was nervous and he knew he didn't really have a choice unless he'd lock himself in a windowless room where his mate couldn't get into.
George, ignoring his yelling completely, started stroking in a way that he knew would make the supposedly angry professor go crazy.
"BLOODY HELL -  oh, you're joking."
When he told his Soulmate, Hermione and the Weasley (they discovered Hermione actually had some Black and even Malfoy blood in her, her grandfather being a Squib, so he stopped calling her mudblood,) Hermione got that surprised and then knowing look in her eyes, which got Draco VERY curious.
"How did you two get here without us noticing...?" Severus asked, startled.

Today was the day.
Harry seemed to calm down a little, accepting that he wasn't a freak for wanting this, and he wasn't a sinner.
Draco was stroking Harry's member, the pleasure of it all making Harry close his eyes blissfully. As they came, both felt complete like never before. They fell asleep soon after.
George was already hard, while Sev was still only flushed and looking at him in shock.
"What?! Let me down you damn punk!
"Congratulations."
That day, professor Snape seemed very jumpy. If you as much as stood behind him, he would deduct points, even from Slytherin. Draco, being a Part-Veela, felt a bond gotten stronger around him.
"I haven't-" Severus's eyes widened.
This time, the inhale was on the edge of actual moan, he noticed.
So, there he was.
"Good morning," Harry smiled.
He bit Harry's neck, the gesture being one of the dominants/equals of the bond claiming their mate, spread his poison into Harry's blood, the poison marking Harry as his and his only, would hurt anyone else who would try to claim HIS mate, though not doing anything to Harry or himself.
Severus couldn't hold out any longer and moaned.
As soon as they stepped in, he locked the door and put up a silencing charm around the classroom.
Draco chuckled and agreed before they drifted off to sleep.
And the blush on the professor's cheeks was more than worth the pain of the second hex.
Severus held out for long, but eventually gave in.
Soon, Harry's eyes opened as well, and he blushed when he remembered the previous night.
That was enough to drive George crazy. He prepared Severus' hole and went in, while finally stroking Severus' cock.
Ron, to his own surprise, was fated to Blaise Zabini.
George held his hands up "wait, I-"
Taking out his wand and casting a powerful silencing charm on the room, he licked the Raven's nipple, enjoying yet another sharp breath and biting his neck again, this time more gently.
_____________________________
He was a great friend and a wonderful young man, but at this point, it had to be some sort of a defence mechanism.
The cauldron set on fire, the potion failing for the 5th time.
"Excuse me," he said, quickly going the direction he came from, then towards the stairs.
Which he wasn't enjoying at all. He was defending himself with all his might, yes. His attempts absolutely weren't half-assed at best...
Severus was so startled by his student's unexpected action that the only thing he managed to do was stare at him in shock. Then he was kissed again, the boy's tongue sliding into his mouth. He couldn't comprehend what was happening, first he was driven into the wall by this deliquent and now...
George pounded on his professor's prostate and stroked his cock until they both came.
But the punk apparently thought of that, too, as he somehow grabbed both his wrists with one hand (now failing to hold well, but still good enough to hold for a bit) and quickly took Severus's wand from him, pocketing it and grabbing a hold of his wrists with both hands again.
The boys looked at him, confused, although if one looked closely, they could see the slightest hint of suspicion creeping into Harry's deep emerald eyes.
"And how, pray tell, was I supposed to know? You attacked me out of nowhere,
Suddenly, Draco and his soulmate appeared out of nowhere startling them both.
"WEASLEY! You're wasting the ingredients on purpose!"
____________________________
Simple, Ron was just too dense to
George turned him around and started teasing his butthole, quickly casting a lubrication and stretching charm and putting in a finger. "Hey! W- what... Stop it! Ngh!" Severus tried to will himself to stop the teen, but couldn't bring himself to move an inch.
He started kissing his neck, the barely noticeable sharp breath enough to drive him crazy. He undid Severus's tie, took the hem of his robes and pulled them, throwing them to the floor.
"Why haven't you told me we're soulmates?!"
And George might be as well, though Severus is probably mostly a bottom.
George had plans, however, and didn't linger. He had a prank to make.
When he retracted his fingers, Harry whimpered at the loss, but Draco was already lining his member up against Harry's hole. He was painfully hard, he needed his mate NOW.
Severus blanched. "How-"
The teenager held his wrists firmly, so he couldn't get his wand either.
I know that this is not an accurate depiction odlf Gay Sex.
Like, his whole existence, for example.
He loved Harry, after all.
Severus found himself against the wall. He tried getting to the side, but was already trapped by his student's hands.
George looked at Snape innocently: "Not true, I don't even know what I'm doing wrong all the time."
He was ashamed to face him.
And realised that the 14-year-old me that wrote this made it kinda rape-y which I hate.
Draco was left wondering what happened, when it hit him - his godfather hadn't known whoever he was with was his soulmate.
Hermione, being the genius she was, gave him another knowing look while Ron was trying to beat Draco in chess and Harry found himself unable to spell his hair into submission yet again.
When he went to sleep, his last thought was:
Ron, Hermione and Fred were sitting in the common room when Harry, Draco, George and
In the morning, George seemed to be practically glowing.
But Draco would be there for him. He would guide him through it, and teach him not to be ashamed of his desires.
Harry and Draco were Soulmates, just as Ginny and Pansy were.
Because there is no one accurate depiction of Wizard Sex.
His  brain unfroze.
Draco heard him muttering something about "the goddamned punk" as he left.
He threw his mate onto the bed.
"Well, Severus here is my soulmate," George said casually.
came in.
"Bloody hell, what is this, the ultimate Slytherin and Gryffindor integration?! Why do we all have Slytherin soulmates?!" Ron exclaimed when Blaise told him.
After a while, he sighed again. "You aren't supposed to add the agama skin before the Mandrake leaves. You have to stir them first-" Snape turned around sharply as George grabbed his wrist. "What do you think you're doing, Weasley?!
I couldn't salvage that part without having to write a brand new story but the least I can do is fix my mistakes.

"P... Please..."
George quickly prepared his spell in front of his potions professor's office. He waited. He needed to make his timing perfect. Finally, he heard the footsteps. He started casting, waiting for a second still... And released the magic. Flying fireworks shot through the hall as professor Snape came into view.
"Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it."   (This quotation seems to be from the films rather than the books.)
“The part with the Kraken—it’s like the Giant Squid, only meaner—that part was scary, but the parts with you were, er, good,” Harry said.  “Where I was.”
“Redresser of long neglect,” Draco got in, before Murgatroyd could finish the dreaded word
“The answer to that,”  Draco grinned, “will always be yes.”
“Come with me?”
They nodded and said goodbye, strolling out together, shoulders bumping easily against each other, and Draco wondered if there would always be a head of flame-red hair taking the spot next to Harry’s wild black curls.
“You tell me,” Harry said helplessly.
“That’s called a lick and a promise, Potter.  Go polish off the bad guy and meet me after.  Unless you’re scared?”
for clean clothes. All Draco’s own clothes needed laundering by now.
Harry couldn’t sleep, though.  He kept remembering what his aunt had said.  He knew Draco wasn’t a monster, but he was curious.  He knew the touch of Draco in his bed, and the sound of him, and the taste and the smell of him, and now Harry felt he couldn’t stand it, not to have the sight of Draco too.
They might be all right, then.  Draco grinned foolishly at Potter – Harry – who grinned as foolishly back, ducked his head, said “See you,” and disappeared into his own room.
“Hello,” Harry said.
There was a little line between Draco’s brows, and his mouth was tight.  It wasn’t anger, though – when he was angry his chin came up and his eyes flashed and he became rather scarily articulate.
“You pulled it off pretty well.  You and Hermione might get along after all.”
“Hullo, Arthur!” he called.
Under cover of the child’s squeals of laughter, Draco nudged Potter and said, “Hear that?  A cock-horse.  Perfectly innocent word that happens to have cock in it.”
“No, but I heard you say
But Harry noticed that he’d eaten it all.
Draco was looking at him with a puzzled frown as Harry turned to walk away.
“Typical.  Even opposing Voldemort, Malfoys are self-serving...”
Draco frowned.  Why had he not thought of this issue before, or heard it discussed at the Ministry?
“Nothing would have been the same without him,” Draco assured Mr Banda, who welcomed him and went off to check on the sound system.
Draco supposed that was true.
“I’ll still be your boyfriend,” Draco said. “I don’t care anymore if my father finds out and disowns me.  Let Brown tell the world.”
“House-elves can do amazing things,” Harry said.  “Dobby blocked Platform 9 ¾ once, to try to keep me from going to Hogwarts.”
Harry caught his hand and they watched the tiny lights flash. “Oh,” said Harry,  “I found that poem.  I asked Padma Patil about it.”
And when Lily grew up and was murdered and left behind a child, Albus Dumbledore asked those two to protect her baby Harry, each in their own way.  How grudgingly they agreed.  How bitter they were in their compliance.  She has not seen every detail of Harry’s life, but enough of his distress has reached her that she knows. Lily’s love could shield her son from the most powerful dark wizard of their time, but it couldn’t protect him from his aunt’s neglect or his teacher’s scorn.
Lavender blinked again. She nodded.
“You could try,” Potter said, “if you promise not to harm anyone else.”
“Collecting them?”
The melody grew strained and tense, and then there was a burst of glory, an exuberant sweep of golden sound, a joyous lift, and then a sweet sweet suspension.
Potter snorted, turned and left.
“I don’t know,” I say, and walk away.
“He doesn’t sound so great to me,” Padma said, entering with a tray. “Have some tea and unburnt cakes, Harry.”
But the fiery Abraxans of Mme Maxime’s team dwarfed his small chariot, and when she tried to give him driving lessons on a carriage, they were so powerful that they were difficult for him to control.  He wanted a horse that he could guide with one hand if necessary, so that he could use his wand if he had to.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Er, congratulations?”
“Good, because I’d better not find you eating these.” She turned to Harry as Ron, relieved, returned to his kitchen duties. “They’re fishermen’s mittens. You boil them and stamp on them until they shrink up all thick and felted. Then if you dip them in hot water and put them on, they’re supposed to keep your hands warm as long as you keep them wet.”
It was Narcissa Malfoy.  She could feel his heartbeat, but announced nothing.  Screened by her long fall of hair, she whispered to him.  “Is Draco alive?  Is he at the castle?”
Potter, squaring his shoulders and tossing his head back, hissed at the dragon in Parseltongue. Draco barely had time to cast a protective shield before the dragon spat flame at them and hissed back. Somehow Draco understood the conversation.
“Too far.”   Harry put his fingers in his mouth to coat them and leaned forward, but Draco was turning and pushing back against his chest.
“Harry,” Draco said firmly. “It’s been two months, it’ll hurt.”
“I think I’ve got an extra pair of mittens,” Potter said, slinging on his winter cloak and digging around in the pockets. He pulled out one pair of garish red and gold mittens with his initials on them, and another pair in an intricate multi-coloured pattern, which he handed to Draco.  “Those are new, never been worn, should be all right for you.”
.  All his ingenuity for fixing things had gone into navigating the new difficulties in his daily life, like finding ways to make his chair more mobile so that he could get around the castle. Now, though, he was able to glide to the top of the Astronomy Tower.  He had to think about his family, so he went to look at the night sky.
“Yeah, it’s not like you were importing them,” Weasley said. “I think Malfoy here needs a drink.  Let’s take him out for a pint.”
Which meant the sun was setting and he’d better pitch his little tent. He chose a spot under a tree by the edge of a meadow, had a simple meal and watched the stars come out. Finally he crawled back into the tent to sleep.
“Give me one good reason why I should trust you, Malfoy.”
Draco frowned.  “Come here.  Come HERE, Potter, I can’t get up.”
“This stuff is really nice, and you deserve to be on the receiving end.  One gives massages with the arms and hands, right?  And mine work fine.  Go on, take your robe off.”
“The letter has panache.  How many English words do you get to say that start with a Z?”
“Mira…”
After breakfast he wandered around the castle for a while, looking at rooms of splendid things, and then went outside where he finally found the white bear again.
,,,^..^,,,~
Prompt:
“Your wand.”
“Nah, not me. Nary a Nargle in sight.” Harry grinned. He wrapped an arm around Draco and rested his head on his shoulder. “Nobody here but us Billywigs.”
While she tugged his strands into place with her beak, Draco smoothed her feathers and whispered sweet nothings and apologies and promises, as if he thought it was his fault she’d been gone so long. Rutherford let him.  Normally she didn’t like to be called Ruthie in public, but she was feeling indulgent.
8888888
“This is wonderful news, Draco darling,” Pansy said.
There was a little silver bell on the table.  Harry stood and picked it up. He was a little sore from the long trip, and he thought a hot bath might be nice.   He couldn’t remember ever having one, because the Dursleys always made him wash in cold water.
“By the way, Malfoy – do ravens go gray?”
Draco gave him a skeptical look.  “And demons in disguise.”
“No, the one who was a seeker for Ravenclaw.  The one you moped over at the Yule Ball.  Long black hair…”
“Did she now.”
Merfley frowned. “We must help him. We must have a fun-raising party!”
“I didn’t mean to - ”
“Owls eat gingernuts?” Harry asked dubiously, setting the flowers down to open the window for the owl to enter.
There was some short silky hair on his companion’s head, but other than that…  His hand touched linen.  Bears wore night-shirts?  Harry felt his way down a thin arm, stroked down a side and thigh, and then the linen ended and he was skimming his hand along a human-seeming leg of smooth skin with a light sprinkling of hair.
An hour later, several glasses of quite good wine had managed to loosen Harry's tongue.  “You’re an owl beyond compare, Ignatius.  Such golden feathers.  Such intelligent black eyes. Face like a white heart.  Devastatingly good-looking.”  Mollified, Ignatius let Harry  stroke him.  It was nice.  Harry hadn’t had an owl since Hedwig.
Andromeda, like Draco, was a constellation in her own right.  She had made good her escape, linked up with Pegasus, the flying horse.  Only a few of her stars were visible yet above the horizon.  If he waited, she would wheel more fully into view.
“…Slytherins?”
Potter stinks of fear.
“I know it’s an imposition.  I asked his godfather, but Harry said he has a date tonight –”
Her bright orange eyes stared at him.  This was not Buckbeak, the one he’d had such a disastrous encounter with years ago.  The one he had insulted because in those years, any ally of Potter’s had to be an enemy of Draco’s.  No, this was a different beast, and a fresh start.
“Clock?”
“What was that?”
Harry’s hand sped up along with his breathing.
“Yeah.”  But not enough.  “More.”
“Which is doing what?”
Draco scoffed.  “Who would cancel on the great Harry Potter?”
“I had no idea toads lived that long.”
Harry willingly followed that promise down the path in the night.
Draco laughed.
“She was tortured in my home, Potter.  Rather a serious breach of hospitality, don’t you think?”
Later, when they got up to eat, Draco told him, “I brought you a couple of things.”
“Come on.  Let’s have some treacle tart,” said Draco.
“You missed me!  I’m touched, Potter.  I needed to look at some original manuscripts that couldn’t be removed from the library.”
Just then the rain became a downpour that ripped through the Umbrella Charm and drenched them. “Come on!” Draco said and ran for the house.
“Clearly this is a critical issue that has not received the attention it deserves.  I will certainly speak to the Ministry.  But…”  Draco frowned again.  “Why have you not spoken to me of it before?  This is exactly what a Centaur Liaison should be learning about.”
Draco tried again.  “I’m sorry, Harry.  Staying here – I don’t have work, and it’s hard to keep hiding – not just being a wizard, but being with you.  They think it’s a sin here for men to be lovers, you know that.  All these kind people, but they’d think we were damned twice over if they really knew us. I couldn’t spend three months pretending, and I did want to see Madagascar.  But I thought about you everywhere I went.”  His voice cracked a little.  “I didn’t know it would be so hard.”
“Yeah!” Harry let out a sigh of relief. Talking about this was hard, but flying was, well, easy as flying.
“I wish I could talk with you.  My name is Draco Malfoy, I am a Centaur Liaison, and I would love to know if there is any way I could assist you.”
“I’ve just been with the most wonderful creature.”
“Don’t you?”
Draco slid into his arms, and they were wrapped in an embrace, kissing. Draco made a helpless noise in his throat and Harry couldn’t bear it, he got them through the doorway and down the steps into the cabin until they reached the nearest bed and fell on it.  They kissed and kissed and then made sweet hungry love, little cries of passion drifting out to mix with the murmur of the water and the other soft sounds of the night.
“Come on,” Harry said, pulling him to join the steps.
Potter grinned at him.  “Here, take some lettuce with you.  I think I planted too much.”
The water was cold, and strong currents pulled the sand out between his toes.  The Golden Gate Bridge soared across the water.  Sea birds cried.
“I saw centaurs!” he called to Harry, who was de-gnoming the garden.
And in fact Draco was a fairly good driver. The Vauxhall Wyvern could no longer be considered a speedy car, but it didn’t break down, and they reached the boundary of the old wyvern reserve in one piece. “Now what?” said Draco.
Caught in Malfoy’s gaze, Harry forgot to reply.
So Harry made something different.  When he brought it over, Malfoy was absorbed in his reading again.  There was an inkstain on the side of his nose.
Harry wondered, distracted.  “How long is that?”
“And then sometimes you’re here and fine,” Harry said, his mouth twisting, “and the war comes and snatches you back.”
A fish eagle soared over the lake.
“Dresses like a Slytherin, so what.”
“And this is an injured and thirsty Abraxan. They live on single malt whisky.” The woman removed a Disillusionment Charm with a wave of her wand, and the horse’s wings became visible, one of them hanging crookedly.
“I say we make Harry host the rematch at his place, then.  I suppose you want me to play it out?”
Potter snorted.  He turned and boosted himself up to sit on the window-ledge, legs dangling above the floor.  “Who’s the witch?”
sang a little voice inside him as he gazed at Draco.  He recognized that feeling, from old dreams of being caressed and cared for.
“Malfoy?” Harry couldn’t think what to say.
Still, sometimes, as a sort of warm-up exercise, he’d dash off a few light-hearted lines about Potter and send them.
“You’re taking me to the Y.M.C.A.?”  Harry laughed.
“So I’ll have to go after him again. And you? Will you stay as my partner?”
Potter suggested he talk to Mr Weasley about it.
“Right, bye then,” Harry said, and pulled himself out of the Floo.
Several weeks later, Rutherford flew down from her perch atop a train on the Trans-Siberian Railroad as it neared Vladivostok.  Potter’s signature had become stronger, but it was across water.  Across the Sea of Japan, to be exact.
It took Draco a long time to work out a way to embed Hover Charms into the chair so that he could climb the stairs, and longer still to modify them so that he wasn’t jolted at each step.
“It’s true what he said about my family’s part in the war,” Draco said quietly.
“The Giant Squid?” Draco said, startled. “Did something happen to it? What’s wrong? But how could it be here? It’s enormous.”
Some hurts Lily did not know how to heal, and so her son suffered for them.  “He’s an innocent child,” she wanted to tell Petunia, tell Severus.  “Don’t blame him.”  But they couldn’t hear her, muffled by the Veil.
starts with a Z.”
“So…” Harry said.
Please wake up and make a plan -
“Fine, I’m looking forward to it.”
“Now who’s perverse?”
Malfoy followed his eyes. “The Kraken!” he shouted in alarm, reaching for his wand. Just as he raised it, a whip-like tentacle broke the water’s surface and plucked the wand away.
“Thank you.  Could you write it out for me because I make splotches with a quill and could I borrow your owl?”
“A hippalectryon. Well, I must go.  Father thinks there may be a Crumple-Horned Snorcack down in Withycombe Scruffets, so we’re going to go and have a look around.”
“She’s near Pegasus – it’s a big square - and Perseus.  But you can’t see her right now.  How do you know my aunt Andromeda?  I don’t really know her myself.”
“These things?” said Harry, reaching for the button on Draco’s trousers.
“Yes, do you?”
The first people to come were a family with two small children. Luckily Luna took them in hand and steered them away from the more dangerous beasts. They watched the squidlets change color, tossed the contented Puffskein around a bit, and left satisfied.
“So you brought me flowers?” Malfoy asked, deadpan.  He eyed the small pot in Harry’s hands, with its slender stems of fragrant white bells.
“I want to see Draco, and be with him tonight,” said Harry.  “And I want an apple I can eat.”
See, Potter?  Now you try it.  Away, can’t you?  Find a way. Away.
“The night?” Draco said. Again he nodded slowly. “The next morning, not so much.”
Draco walked to the edge of the pond. He carefully levitated Herman out of the cauldron of water and lowered him into the lake. Herman jetted excitedly back and forth a few times, but then began waving his arms and tentacles frantically. As Draco watched in horror, the little squid began to swell like a balloon inflating. His eyes implored Draco.
But then Murgatroyd became head of the Beast Division.  Murgatroyd didn’t like the Malfoy family, didn’t like the Black family, and didn’t care why Draco had done what he had done in the war years or whether he had changed any since.  Now, apparently, Draco was to be sacked.
“Draco is a powerful and elegant name.”
“I didn’t – it wasn’t me who opened the door.”
“Follow me. The canal’s near here, but it doesn’t look like much,” Malfoy said.  “There were a lot of canals around Wiltshire once.  Not just the Kennet & Avon, which has been restored, but the Wilts & Berks, the North Wilts, the Thames & Severn…  But they fell into disrepair when the railways came in, so a lot of the old inland waterway network can’t be used by Muggles nowadays.  Wuffley can still navigate them, though.”
so much sexy poetry in that language!  Is there anything else you’re looking for today?”
“Come here.”
“There you are, Harry!  I looked for you over by the Quidditch Pitch.  Wait, what’s Malfoy doing here?”
Draco let his fingers follow the trail of hair down, down, into a warm tangle where something was rising to meet his hand.  He stroked Potter’s hot length.
“There’s a wild and ribald assortment of things in the margins.  Warrior rabbits.  Arse trumpets.”
“It’s about four travelers who go to India to bring the first Buddhist scriptures back with them to China.  So it’s kind of related to meditation.”
Luna turned wide eyes on Draco.  “How lucky that we have you as Centaur Liaison.”
“Remus, my friend!  Who do you have here?” said the voice of the South Wind.
Harry shook himself.  This was not the time and place for erotic daydreams. “Thanks for the hospitality,” he said, and picked up the birdcage.  He went to the doorway and called to Gabriel.  When the bird flew to him, Fern trotted after, and watched as Harry put Gabriel into the cage.
A few hours later, the coin around Draco’s neck warmed suddenly against his skin.  He pulled it out and saw a heart traced on its surface.  Nothing else.  He wasn’t surprised when Harry – and Granger, and Weasley – didn’t return.  Not that night, nor the next, nor in the weeks to come.
you want, I’m sure my bride will be willing to show me her domestic skills.  I need my night-shirt cleaned before the wedding.”
Narcissa seemed to notice him for the first time.  “Auror Potter.”  She nodded to him, her face grave.
“Very well, I accept.  I’ll make arrangements to visit the herd in the Forbidden Forest as soon as possible.”
"Oh, Matty, what I wouldn't give for ten minutes with my mum to find out how to be better at this," Harry murmurs to the little one in his arms.
Potter, returning for him.
“Here you are, Gabriel.  Off you go.”
“This could take a while.  I’m going to get us some wine.  Any preferences?”
Draco gazed at him, laughed softly, took Harry’s hand and squeezed. “I’d say Mrs Weasley knew what she was doing.”
“Not very good hosts,” Potter said.  “Or maybe I just don’t appreciate their choice of entertainment.”
“Dudley?” Harry shook his head. “I don’t expect any happy reconciliations there and I sure haven’t missed him. I mean, I suppose if Draco Malfoy can turn over a new leaf then anything is possible, but I think the Dursleys are all just glad to have the magical freak out of their lives.”
“Does it have to be a wizard?”
She searched the shelves and found a copy of
“That will keep,” Draco murmured, moving closer, heavy eyes on Harry’s mouth.
“Not for
Jimmy Cliff was chanting.
“You will see that my family is protected?”
The bear looked balefully at him and then sighed.  “I can’t,” he said.  “We’d better get going if we want to reach the castle before nightfall.  You can get some better-fitting shoes when we get there.  Until then I suppose you can ride again.”
At Hogwarts, students and staff were told that Draco had died suddenly of complications from his injury, and that his mother had insisted on a private funeral at the Manor.  It was strange to think that his friends in Slytherin would believe him dead, but he couldn’t afford to let it be known he was alive, if he wanted to stay that way.
“AARGH!”  Harry screamed.  “I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO WILL TALK TO ME!  I want to go home.”
And now here they were, on a little boat in the middle of China, sailing up to a statue of Buddha so enormous….
“But the being, um, friends with you… I wonder if we might give that a chance here? Just take it slow, go for a walk or have lunch sometimes?”
“He was being gracious, actually,” Draco said, “giving me an excuse for losing to him so often.”
Thoughtfully he reached for the cup of bitter tonic, took another sip, grimaced, and swallowed.
“Interesting,” said Draco.  “What are they like?”
“Much of Britain’s forest land was lost long ago.  There are few places for a centaur herd.  We do not trust that what remains is safe.”
“Want to tell me about it over lunch?  I know a little Italian place in London.”
Harry remained silent, his own wand still out, as he scanned the grounds.
The door stayed open.
“I’m not sure -
What Harry saw on Draco’s face, he felt in his core.
“So you’ve given up living in your home over a bunch of bad juju peacocks?”
“Do Taoist monks have to take a vow of celibacy?”
“But sir, this problem is apparently severe…”
“You said you don’t do magic here either, Malfoy.”
“They don’t deserve it,” Harry said.
Draco took Harry’s hands and held them up to cup his own face, nestling his cheeks against them.  “Maybe you should learn to find your way by touch.” He was drawing Harry’s hands over his chest and down his sides.
Harry had gone to the Forbidden Forest, walking to meet his death.  Voldemort raised his wand, opened his mouth, there was a flash of green light, and everything was gone.
“I wish I could understand what you’re saying.”
“Preventing a crime against a Hippogriff, apparently.”
“Oh – I didn’t realise how late it is - I’d better let you go,” Potter said.  “Saturday night coming, I expect you have plans.”  Draco didn’t, but he assumed Potter was excusing himself to go get ready for his own date.
“Come over, Harry!  We’re reading
“Are you the laddie who ought to have had him?”
Malfoy nodded to her.
People drifted out.  Draco stood.  “Don’t you go,” Harry said.
“Yeah,” Harry said, and they grabbed their shirts and stumbled up to a private spot to Apparate.
“I finally heard about that book you wanted from the Czech Republic," Padma told Hermione. "It should be in next week.”
“Spiders,” Draco gasped.  It was the understatement of the year.
Perhaps he should visit his mother.
“Charm?” Draco looked at Harry. “What’s the name of this charm?”
“Just enforce them,” Harry finished bitterly.
“Well, you still haven’t finished, Mr Resurrection.  It wouldn’t hurt you to be a bit more selfish this time around.  Don’t let the bad memories win.  You know better, right Potter?”
Harry looked after them, and then turned back.  “Draco?”
Draco’s hips twitched.
Gabriel circled back, and the cat made another jump and pirouette.
“Or else what, Malfoy?  Are you going to wap me from on high?”
“I know more than enough about Malfoy already, thanks.”
It had been so long since anyone had touched Harry's face.
“Where’s the youngest son?” the bear growled.  “That can’t be him.”
Draco smiled a little and gave Old Timer another biscuit.
“Yes, because I was on my way to learn all kinds of magic, and it was my first trip without my parents.”
Draco appeared to relax slightly, to Harry’s relief.
^(OvO)^
“But that doesn’t explain why he was so weak – he was practically sliding to the floor.”
“Have you had your cat since she was a kitten?” Harry asked.
So Draco let himself be persuaded, and Potter was actually right; it was a bit like balancing on a broom, and it was fun.  But odd, because there was no vertical motion. It made Draco want to go flying.
“Fine, then, lift your shirt,” Draco said, and began dabbing gently at the cuts left by the tentacle barbs. Harry couldn’t help a hiss of pain. Draco murmured something absently in a low soothing voice and started to smooth the salve over the cuts. It felt cool and had a pleasant herbal smell. He bandaged the cuts deftly.
“Kastania,” she said.  “Goodbye.”
And he swept his cloak around Potter’s shoulders. On its midnight blue background, the constellation he was named for gleamed silver.
Rosemonde had pulled them high, high up, and the sound of the battle was covered by the wind rushing in their ears.  Wind and soaring and sunshine and a kiss in Harry’s arms.  That would do.
Harry loosed his hand and Disapparated.  Draco smiled after him.  From the corner of his eye he saw a gleam of yellow-green light blink on and off in the garden.  He laughed again in quiet wonder.  “Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee, Harry Potter.”  And Draco went home.
She is back in the Great Hall at Hogwarts at her first day Sorting Ceremony, watching from her new place at the Gryffindor table as Sev is sent off to the Slytherins. Lucius Malfoy, cold and pale and gleaming with his prefect’s badge, pats him on the back as Sev sits down with them.  Lucius catches Lily’s intent gaze, and his mouth moves.  Lily has no trouble reading his disdainful lips.
One day, as he was sitting on a park bench scratching Wombat behind the ears, Draco was surprised to see Harry Potter walking towards him.
It was a relief to have a plan and know where to turn for help. Harry renewed the Stunning Spell on the Mooncalf, adding one for protection and one to keep it hidden while he went to get help. Then he Apparated to the coordinates Luna had given him.
“No! I mean, that’s not it… it’s just…” Draco stammered. “I just meant it would be good to have company. To be with someone who understands. After you’ve been through a lot.”
“That’s right.”
“Do you think Teddy would like a dragon kite?” he asked Harry.
“Hush, you.  I’m trying to be romantic.”
“All right,” Harry said, and then Malfoy had paid for his order and gone.
Harry’s
“No – want to see you -” Harry swept a pile of papers to the floor, turned Draco around and hoisted him onto the table.
“Hands?”
“Oh, smooth line.”   Harry was still laughing, which broke up the kiss a bit at first, and their noses bumped.  First sober kiss in the full light of day.  But he felt a giddy confidence, backing toward the bed, tugging Draco along.
“I’d have done the limbo,” said Kingsley.
In the evening, waiting for sleep, he paged through it, looking for Wystan Hugh. He found W.H. Auden, and a poem.
“I never meant – and you hadn’t exactly been standing around innocent, you know.”
Over the next few weeks Æthelflæd proved to be an efficient Healer, although not very sociable. She set the Niffler’s nose properly, re-ignited the Fire Crab, and taught Draco to brew a potion for the Augurey’s throat and ointment for Old Timer’s eyes. She fixed up a cottage on the grounds to live in and spent a lot of time with the Abraxan, working with its wounded wing.
“And you were on it too.”
“Mmm.”  Something complicated and painful flickered on Potter’s face.
“Well,
“Well, now that that’s settled, do you want some lunch? Merfley and I made some soup last night that turned out rather well.”
Harry didn’t have the patience for climbing stairs at this point.  He Apparated them into his bedroom.  They fell on the bed and finished getting rid of clothes.  Then he felt Draco’s palms cup his cheeks, fingertips lifting the earpieces of his glasses.
“How is she?” Draco asked, not daring to meet his eyes.
They flew around for a while just to explore. Draco came face to face with a ridiculously cute tree kangaroo, and Harry was startled when he nearly collided with a huge butterfly.
“Statues of a goddess?  In Greece, or somewhere?”
Harry smiled back and yawned.  “Er, I’m really tired.  Maybe I should go.”
“He scared it off with a Patronus.”
“It is.”
8888888
“You blagger!” Harry laughed over his shoulder.  “Comes of all that cheating at Quidditch.”
Inside me, curiosity fought with the uneasiness that spread through my body. It felt terribly intimate to be here. To be able to watch
You’ll rip off my arm,” Draco growled, but was ignored by Harry. It had taken him two more classes to find the courage to grab Draco’s arm again and drag him away. By now it was late afternoon and they were in an abandoned classroom that Harry had never seen from the inside. Apart from a few tables and an old blackboard, there wasn’t much to look at anyway.
It was a wonderful day; the brightly shining sun made the entire student body of Hogwarts cheer with joy. Early in the morning they had all gone to the Great Lake, had secured themselves places in the warm sun and were now swimming in the lake or playing magic ball games on the shore to pass the time. An ordinary early summer Sunday in Harry's eighth school year.
Later, Harry is in the kitchen doing the dishes half by magic, half by hand, Ron is sitting at the kitchen table talking about a selection of cots and how much argument potential it holds. Hermione and Draco have already retreated to the drawing room, which Harry takes as a good sign. Draco refrains from smoking when he is around Hermione, and Pup is equally fond of the two of them, so he is probably getting his daily dose of cuddles right now.
It wasn’t easy, neither for him nor for Draco, but it felt good when they were together. Harry’s
He rises wordlessly and crosses the room with firm strides. Everything has been said, there is nothing more he can give Draco.
! But please not Parkinson! Or Granger... Oh Lord, not
It was quiet. Night fell peacefully over Hogwarts and made sure that even the last students snuggled into their beds and closed their eyes. Everyone except Harry, who, after looking at the Marauder’s Map, once again slipped over his invisibility cloak. Barefooted, he clumsily made his way to the fifth floor to the luxurious Prefects’ Bathroom. Under his arm, he carried his wand and the book in which the words of salvation were written. Hermione had given it to Harry in the evening, but as they had been late for dinner, Harry hadn’t seen the Slytherin and ultimately had no opportunity to announce the joyful news.
"You can't cure the curse without knowing what it is, can you?" Mr Potter asks. He no longer seems upset, just contemplative.
" Draco buried his face in his hands and seemed to be going through some kind of inner crisis.
"Draco," Mr Malfoy greeted his son composed and stopped at the head of the table between Ron and Harry. His attention, however, was entirely focused on Draco.
Following his new plan, Harry continued his kisses on Draco's neck, shoved the shirt up his back as well, positioned Draco's body so that the blond lay on his stomach and kissed his way down his back. He took his time, caressed every centimetre of the warm skin and enjoyed the thin line between lust and tenderness. Draco melted under his touches like butter and Harry gratefully absorbed every sigh.
"Deal!" Ron said instantly and held out his hand to Draco as if to seal it with a gesture.
The curse said Draco would be able to
The bathroom next to the office should be free," Harry said, glancing at the crowded bathroom adjacent to the dining hall.
Right?
"I have nothing for you," Malfoy replied scornfully. "As you may have noticed, the earth has orbited the sun a full five times without my presence. I'm as involved in what's happened as you exhibit decency. That amounts to a zero for both of us, in case your rotten brain hasn't figured that out yet. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't answer the Aurors' questions."
"Once upon a time – All right, I can't take this seriously. I'll just tell you... normally." Harry bit his tongue to keep from laughing, the beginning had already gone rather poorly.
"I will be frank," Kingsley starts after Harry has described in brief the course of the last few months. "By no means do I wish to interfere in the affairs of Auror Headquarters. I trust Mr Robard's judgement entirely."
“Do come in Potter.  It will be all right, you’ll see.  Have a seat, I’ll take those for you.”
^(OvO)^
A popular picture-book in Slytherin  families.  I liked the colorful ones.”
“Hmm.
The owl tactfully set Lavender’s letter down nearby and flew away.
“It’s your birthday in the summer, isn’t it?  We could get you a bird.  You used to have such a beautiful white owl.”
“Yeah, but I didn’t think you actually
“Ride me,” Draco said, his heart in his mouth.
“No, I just didn’t get much sleep last night.”
The woman raised her brows slightly. She was one of the Patil twins, Harry realised – the short hair had thrown him off. He guessed it was Padma; he didn’t remember Parvati being much of a reader. But what was she doing here?
“I still want a concert.”
Draco nodded. “Or go flying?”
Draco cast a careful spell to make the cauldron transparent so that Herman could see, and with Merfley carrying it they walked around the grounds to find a suitable site.
Draco thought dubiously of various Hogwarts classmates born the same year – Vince, or the once silly, pretty Lavender Brown.  He had no wish to speak ill of the dead – whom he had so recently tried to join – or of the scarred and determined survivors, but.…  “If we're all so clever, how our professors must have rejoiced, when a whole troop of us entered school at once.”
Draco looked away, blushing. “You saw a side of me that other people haven’t.”
He exhaled hard.  “Right. I shall return tomorrow to resume my duties as Centaur Liaison.”
I rode an invisible horse for you,
“Who was Weasley playing against?” Pansy cut in.
“Oh, we’re forgetting the other present,” Harry said.  He pulled a soft yellow mitten out of the wrapping. “Wait, there’s only one?”
She turned on Draco.  “Don’t laugh at Harry just because he’s a little shy.  You should get out more too, young man. ”
Draco smiled.  Potter had been curious about his French broom, and he’d always wondered about Potter’s brooms.  Once a Seeker, always a Seeker, he supposed, and a Seeker looked for different things in a broom than other wizards and witches usually did.  He’d love to try out Potter’s, to be honest, but that was such an intimate thing to do….  Draco gave himself a mental shake.
“Willie, Norman, Hortense, Bruce…” Draco supplied.
Honey.
There was a confusion of kissing and peeling off clothing.  “Bed?  A bed is good,” Draco said.
“It was a very insipid garden party.  I was bending over to tie my shoe and avoid eye contact with a tiresome person, when there was a rustle in the ferns and she attacked my foot.”
Malfoy sat back, considering.  “Maybe your ears are at different heights.  That’s all right, I can adjust them.”  He began to reach for his wand, but Harry was faster.
One didn’t survive the Dark Lord without learning how to keep memories locked away.  Draco banished that one, took a deep breath and knocked.
So Harry gave her the golden apple, and at night she brought him up to Draco’s bedroom, where he lay sleeping.  Harry gave him a little kiss, to wake him with a nice surprise, but Draco still slept.  Harry called his name, and shook him, and called to him:
“What?  You think I can just go back there?”
. His hands slid beneath the sheets, stoking the fire of a passion long dormant. A cry tore out of him as he came. He lay panting, and then dropped into a heavy sleep.
“Can I see it?” Harry asked, and immediately blushed – where had that thought come from?
“And he didn’t like how you treated him.”
“Uh, yeah, I enjoy your scintillating repartee also.”
“Um, I don’t think it’s supposed to come to that point, Draco.  I think you’re supposed to keep them calm.  So they let you get to the honey.”
Malfoy stirred.  “Want to get dinner here at the restaurant?”
Draco was floating.  Harry licked the tender skin on the insides of his wrists and elbows, and waves of delicious sensation lapped at Draco, rocking him gently.
Hermione made a face at him.
“An ambiguous model of moral behavior,” McGonagall had said.
But Harry just looked anguished and shook his head.
Draco held back a sigh.  “Perhaps shorter lines would help?
“You have time to figure it out,” Andromeda said. “It must be quite a culture shock to be back here after living in such a different place. And yes, we missed you, but you must have had your reasons for leaving. You’d had such a weight of expectations on you for so long.”
Harry might have collapsed on the floor, but Draco wouldn’t let him.  “Bed - much more comfortable - I’ll take you, not far.”  Harry was too hoarse to protest.
But Draco was answering somewhat stiffly, “Of course not.  But clearly, courtesy would’ve been wasted on you.  And you were no angel yourself.”
“Flesh, bones and blood vessels are more easily healed.  Nerves are much more complex. In this case, the most productive thing for you would be physical therapy for rehabilitation and some emotional counseling.”
“I believe I could do well as a Goblin Liaison,” Draco said quickly.  “I have an interest in finance, and…”
, he realised,
Draco strode into the forest, trying not to wonder what Longbottom and Potter might be doing together.
“I got a new kind of massage oil, want to try it?  Got time now?”
She smiled coyly at him.  “Maayong aga,” she said in a sweet voice. “Kamusta ka?”
“Greg’s actually quite good at predicting the weather, so I think the skies will be clear for a while. “
“He’s too proud to read translations.  I’m not.”
He pictured Malfoy, beautifully rumpled and less dressed.  Oh.  Hot.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said.  “I don’t understand your language.  But hello.”
“Oh, that’s much better,” Padma said. “I approve.”
Then he saw the bulge in Potter’s shorts, which seemed to grow as he looked at it.  Potter was trembling.
Jimmy urged him.
“And does he receive poems?”
The bear was pacing back and forth now, talking in an agitated tone.  “They’ll slander me.  People do, they’re very unfair to bears.  They’ll try to turn you against me.  They will, and you’ll leave me, and I’ll never…  I’ll….  I’ll be…”  He flung himself down on his belly and covered his eyes with his paws.
“Those centaurs have never talked to anyone from the Ministry, why should they start now?”
He was queuing for a hot butterbeer (there was a nippy breeze) when he heard, “
“Don’t be absurd, Malfoy. you know what I meant.  No one’s held that post for ages.  You’re being made red-“
They were both breathing heavily with the intensity now, hips rocking together, and Harry needed more, needed to feel all of Draco’s skin against his own, some coherent part of him aware that coming in his pants like a teenager wasn’t exactly what he wanted for their first time together.
He heard himself almost growl in frustration, and Draco said, “If you even think about tearing it, there’ll be hell to pay,” before somehow undong the whole thing one handed, and pulling Harry to sit up so he could tug his t-shirt over his head.
who tried to take a photograph through one of the front windows, was allegedly transfigured into a goat for her efforts. Ms Emmensworth declined to comment for this piece: rumour has it that she is still unable to complete a sentence without bleating.
“I did tell you to put them in boxes,” Hermione pointed out.
was not given access to the third and fourth floors of the house, privately I knew Draco wouldn’t mind me having a quick look.  The master bedroom on the third floor is skillfully done: while the inviting queen-sized four-poster bed, clearly one of Draco’s iconic hand-crafted pieces, is the main feature of the room, my eye is immediately drawn to the way light from the large south-facing window creates a beautiful interplay with an intriguing piece of artwork on the wall, which appears to be an authentic Georgianna Moonstone.  It sits perfectly in the space, not dominating but drawing one’s eye: it’s almost disappointing to see it juxtaposed against the pale gold paint, though this contrast is by no means as incongruous as the burgundy armchair in the corner.  While the classic Phoenix Tear lamp floating above does help to create a very cosy reading area, I can’t help feeling that Draco may have let deference to his Gryffindor client override his normally unerring sense of colour in this instance.
Hermione shuddered.  “Ron, your pronunciation is atrocious.”
“It’s a bit unusual for couples to talk about marriage when they’ve only been together for a month,” Draco tells me.  “At some point, maybe.”
Malfoy lowered his voice slightly.  “Also, since you’re here... Pansy’s out of house arrest now and trying to use me to get a permanent position at
There is a traditional, somewhat archaic, pureblood hierarchy of guest rooms, with which I doubt you’re acquainted. It’s less clear in Muggle-built houses like yours, but it can be helpful to know where to start, and which floors are likely to house which visitors.  Dare I ask which room you’ve selected for yourself, and how you’re getting on with that?  Or are you sleeping in the drawing room, as you reportedly did during the war, and avoiding dealing with the bedrooms entirely?
“Which means I can interpret it however I like,” she pointed out, “and it reminds me of Harry.  How did the song go, again?  ‘His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad, his hair is as dark as a blackboard’... those colours are here, and here, and there, and it shines like you.”
Draco had got rid of the gas lamps, denouncing them as ‘more trouble than they’re worth’.  He’d refused to deal with the Muggle power companies, and somehow found a legal way to dismantle and banish all the gas pipes throughout the house, replacing the lights with magical sconces that came on with a warm glow when you walked in and got brighter or dimmer with a wave of your wand.
Ginny.  Shit.  Harry banged his forehead against the wall a couple of times, then dashed the rest of the way upstairs.
“The house misses me?”  At that point Harry knew he had Draco’s attention.
Harry wanted to tear his hair out.  “You know what, I’m just going to find somewhere to stay tonight and come back tomorrow.  There’s no point talking to you when you’re like this.”
Potter,
“I’m pretty sure dozens of letters and sixty Galleons’ worth of chocolates tick some of those boxes, and he’s still not budging,” Harry pointed out, finishing his sentence over Ron’s choked whimper of, “You spent
“Jealous.”  Draco made that one word sound like a mouthful of broken glass.
Harry let Draco push him back onto the bed and climb on top of him, and this was far, far better than before, feeling the weight of Draco’s whole body pressed against him, but it still wasn’t enough.  He started trying to open Draco’s shirt, but the tosser always wore these expensive faerie-made things with stupidly tiny buttons.
“I’m happy if you’re happy,” Ron recited dutifully.  “If it’s possible to be happy with...him.”
He made it about two steps before somehow – did he Apparate? - Draco was in front of him, arms folded.  “I’m not trying to be pushy.  But this thing with Ginevra – I don’t even want to call it a friendship – is making you miserable, and not only does that make the mood in this house oppressive and uncomfortable for me, but also -” Draco paused, put his hands on Harry’s shoulders to stop him from pushing past and running away- “every time you come home you just seem sadder and sadder, and I can’t sit back and watch anymore.  She’s holding you hostage, and you deserve better.”
“You don’t need to apologise for that,” Harry said, holding Draco’s gaze.  “That was years ago. You
Even after so many years, Harry couldn’t help squirming a bit inside under Hermione’s scrutiny.  “Other than a Time-Turner, I’ve no idea.  I’m sending the owl down a few times a week, but she always comes back in a terrible mood with the letters still sealed.   I really need him back urgently now. The upstairs shower doesn’t work properly unless he’s in the house.  He spent so much time renovating the bathrooms that the whole plumbing system likes him best.”
Avid followers of
“Potter,” he said, finally turning his attention to Harry, “thanks for writing.  Mother’s very pleased that I’m ‘starting anew with some good influences’, and I’ve been relieved to have someone to talk to other than the house-elves.  Not that your grasp of grammar is much better than theirs,” he added with that familiar smirk, but he didn’t sound entirely malicious, which felt like progress to Harry.
“Well, yeah, but we’re talking about the world’s biggest drama queen – this is part of some plan to get himself back in the news. He’s probably Parkinson’s mystery source, too.”
Sirius’s pictures,” Harry said defensively.  “We’ve talked about that.  Photos of family and friends are much better than pointless artwork.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said abruptly, moving away.
“Relax, Granger,” he said, “Sapphy was terribly excited to come.  She’s learned all kinds of new recipes from the French elves, and I think she gets bored cooking for just Mother all the time.”

“By all means,” said Draco, muttering some incantations over the box.  “So you don’t break them,” he explained in response to Harry’s quizzical look.  “I should have a couple of chairs for you to test out by Thursday or so - but if you show up at this time again, I can’t promise not to embed stinging curses into the seats.”
“Sorry,” he said, and Draco tugged him into another intense kiss.
As I move on, I am even more surprised at the second room on this floor. Perhaps it is intended to be an office of some kind, but even so it’s unexpectedly Spartan.  Like the bedroom downstairs, its walls are gold, and its furnishings are all handcrafted in luxurious hardwoods, bringing an air of maturity to Potter’s own design sensibilities.  These are limited, however, to a chest of drawers, a bookshelf, and a desk, above which are numerous pictures of Potter’s friends and family.  My intention to peruse Potter’s reading material is sadly cut short by the menacing movements of a wooden stag figurine, which appears to be patrolling the shelves.
Harry grinned. “Aha, so you do think I can pull them off!”
,” he told her.
Harry knew he could capitalise on this.  “Yeah, actually.  Maybe I’ll tell you about it if you give me a hand with the house in London I inherited.”
Malfoy - murtlap essence worked; you’re a genius!  Why isn’t it in any of the cleaning products already?  That would’ve made my life easier.  I’m trying to use the living room fire more for the Floo but the network defaults to the kitchen. Is there a way to change that?
Harry wasn’t entirely listening, but he gave himself a pass because Ginny had been saying the same thing in different ways since they’d sat down.  “I’m listening, Gin, but -”
Yes, but not narcissi.  She will not see the humour in that.
By Pansy Parkinson
Malfoy laughed, and it actually sounded genuine.  “I’ve been saying for years you’d have been an excellent Slytherin.  Go on, then, what’s this favour?”
I am on the edge of my seat.  “Care to clarify that for my readers?”
“Oh,” said Hermione, rather loudly.
Harry put up with a whole hour and a half of being catcalled and ogled every time he got out of his seat before he called it a night.  He told Draco to stay on if he wanted, but he insisted on heading back too - “Just so you don’t get mistaken for a rent boy on the way home.”
Clearly Harry wasn’t meant to hear that, let alone be able to interpret it, so he chose to ignore both the remark and the weird fluttering feeling in his chest.
Harry waved him off, “Oh, you know, just... a bad evening. I’m gonna make some tea and head to bed I think, do you want a cup?”
“It is rather nice, isn’t it?” Luna said, walking up close to take a proper look.
“And I hate that she makes you come home looking ten years older.  What happened?”
They reappeared in the living room, Harry clutching Draco’s arm for balance.
Hermione frowned thoughtfully.  “That’s very insightful, Harry.”
“You know him better than we do, mate,” Ron pointed out.  “Though I remember at school he used to get those massive packages of sweets all the time, have you tried that?”
Following months of intrigue, Draco Malfoy today made a statement announcing that the renovation of historic Malfoy Manor is now complete.  He called a press conference at the gates of the sprawling grounds, which have also been given a new lease of life.  Malfoy, pictured today (right), and following his sentencing last November (left), appears to have matured a great deal since that last public appearance. His physique suggests that he has undertaken much of the work on the premises himself, and his manner is very much that of the head of the household, a vast difference from the scared child we remember from his trial.
“You have?” Harry interjected.
“Lovely’s a strong word,” Ron said, but he grudgingly let Malfoy shake his hand.
The stately architecture and high ceilings lend themselves well to this lustrous palette, and the simpler – but no less exquisite – furnishings serve to accentuate the grandeur of the house while also creating a more approachable atmosphere: it certainly stands apart from most other historic pureblood residences. However, while I myself was pleasantly surprised to witness what the Malfoy family has accomplished, it remains to be seen whether the wider magical communities will be accepting of what some are calling ‘the rejection of a noble heritage’.
with this insight.”
He was rewarded with that beautiful, soft smile, and leaned in for a long, deep kiss.
Not that Harry knew the first thing about art. He’d just picked a painting that felt right and looked a bit like Draco’s favourite, ‘Eclipse in Jade’, and then hoped like hell it would fit in the smaller bedroom.  It didn’t, really, but Draco had messed about with measuring charms for a while and then announced, “Sod it, it can be its own feature wall,” before letting it take up almost the whole space opposite the bed.
above your bed.”
Well, that was… interesting.  Harry hoped his face didn’t show how thrown he was, though when he took a second it did make a lot of sense, actually.  “Well, if  you do decide to, y’know, bring anyone back here, that would be okay,” he said lamely. “I mean, it’s your home too, now, I guess, and it’s none of my business, obviously, if that’s what you want to do.”
Lovegood, showing great courage and poise for one so young, claimed, “Draco hated watching us being tortured, and was sometimes physically sick when he was forced to stay in the room...  When [You-Know-Who] told him to hurt us, he clearly didn’t want to, but only did what he was told because he was threatened, too.”
Ron jumped - Harry thought Hermione must have kicked him under the table.  “Well, you definitely won’t be getting back together if you’ve got him skulking around.”
“Potter,” Draco said coldly, standing up so they were eye-to-eye, “Go fuck yourself.”  He walked over to the fireplace, took a pinch of Floo powder, and stepped into the flames, heading for his mother’s house.  Every movement felt like a punch in the gut to Harry, and the worst thing was that he absolutely deserved it.
Malfoy waved his wand and a box flew over to land - unnecessarily heavily - in Harry’s lap.  When he opened it, he saw a stack of incredibly detailed miniature dining tables, each one not only a different type of wood, but different in style and detail, right down to the tiny carvings.  He picked up a particularly intricate example and held it up to the light.  “Bloody hell, Malfoy.  These are incredible.”
One must also ask, with the end of his year-long house arrest imminent, will Draco Malfoy and his mother be enjoying the fruits of their labour?  Or is Mr. Malfoy’s reference to the residence simply as ‘The Manor’ a sign of more change to come?
“I know that; it’s the
“An astute observation, Weasley.  However,” he paused for a moment, as if composing himself, “my mother was very keen for me to invite my school friends, and I think we all know that’s a fairly small number.  In all honesty, I probably know you three a lot better than most, which is thoroughly depressing.  Greg’s here somewhere, probably near the buffet, and Blaise Zabini, and Millie Bulstrode, but that’s about it.  Most of the others from our year understandably declined to attend.”  Malfoy looked tired for a moment, and oddly sad.  He glanced back at Ron. “I hope the pathetic wreck that is my social life makes you feel a bit better about spending your evening here.  Enjoy the party.”
Draco’s eyes widened, realisation starting to dawn.  “Harry, what did you do?”
I try to stay composed so I can gather all the facts, but even to someone who’s known Draco for such a long time this news is entirely unexpected.  “How would the two of you define your relationship?”
Harry tried not to laugh.  It had been like this ever since Draco had moved back in: he suspected that in a matter of weeks, everyone they knew would have been forced to traipse up the stairs to Draco’s room and admire his painting.
“Dramatic,” Ron said, trying to disguise it as a cough.
“How did he do that?” Zabini asked in awe.
Ginny didn’t reply, just grabbed her bag and stood up.  She paused, as if she wanted to say something, but in the end just squeezed his hand, hard, and was gone.
“Because, as much as I adore you, I’m not sure it’s the best idea to tell everyone we know about this before we’ve even been together for a day.”
“Why wouldn’t you be able to touch me?” Harry asked with a frown.
Thankfully Hermione intervened at that point.  “Well, moral questions aside; Padma, Parvarti, Lisa and I had lunch the other day and looked through some of the
“You love it, too.  Harry gave it to me,” he tells me proudly, “as a grand romantic gesture.”
When they finally broke apart - Harry was proud of them for finding the willpower to stop before things got too far, though he still found himself having to remove his hand from up Draco’s shirt - everyone at the table was staring.
“Do you really think that because Pansy was all over me when we were fourteen my loyalty is going to be with her?  After all the time I’ve spent complaining about how much she’s tried to exploit our friendship?”

Harry eventually spoke.  “Malfoy looks good, doesn’t he?  Less - pointy.  More grown up.”

are calling me a ‘design prodigy’ so I must have done something right,” Malfoy said lightly.  He seemed to be working really hard to be polite to Ron - Harry had to concede that his friend wasn’t making it easy.
“That’s brilliant, thanks, Malfoy.  You’re a lifesaver.”
Ron just shook his head and looked back at Harry.  “What about when you want Ginny to move in?  You can’t just have Malfoy swanning about the place.”
“Well done, Malfoy.  Ten points to Slytherin.  Though I’ve got to say, after lugging this thing through Customs and the Portkey Bureau, not to mention trying to find this place, I’m hardly in the mood to throw myself at your feet.”
may have been totally right about your arse.  It doesn’t make it any less ridiculous that you - war hero, respected Ministry employee - spent most of tonight getting smashed, in hotpants.”
“What about you?” Harry asked.  “Are you seeing anyone?”  He couldn’t picture Malfoy bringing any snooty pureblood girls back here, not until the place was completely finished, but he didn’t relish the idea of trying to eat his breakfast while Pansy Parkinson sat across the table passing judgement.
“For crying out loud, Potter.  No, it is not the first time I’ve slept here.  Yes, it is a pain in the arse.  However,
“It’s your tradition,” Harry pointed out.
“I know many pureblood families would shy away from destroying so much of historical value, and some auctioneers with whom I’ve been dealing have said as much – but unless you were present during the atrocities of the war, it is impossible to understand how much the Manor’s previously proud history has been irrevocably tainted,” Malfoy announced.  “I really wanted to tear the whole thing down, but its status as a Grade 4 listed building of magical heritage – as well as centuries-old warding spells – preclude that.  We know many members of the press and public are curious to see how much the Manor has changed, and so we will be inviting a select few to a Halloween Ball to commemorate the end of the Wizarding Wars and mark a new beginning, not only for the Manor but also for the Malfoy family.”
on chocolate?”
“But we don’t support him.  Do we?” Ron asked.  “I mean, I’m all for him admitting he was on the wrong side, but he was still a prick at school. Just because he’s reformed or whatever on paper doesn’t mean he’s suddenly a good person.”
“Turn it into a masterpiece of modern wizarding design?” Draco finished for him, with no small amount of pride.
Harry winced. “At least that’d help me stay awake.”  When he got to the door, he turned round.  “My chairs aren’t that urgent, you know.  Try and get some rest.”  He didn’t need to look back to know that Malfoy was totally ignoring him.
“You need a grand romantic gesture,” Luna said, totally seriously.
“I just threw the salad together,” he confessed, “Draco borrowed his mum’s house-elf for the rest.”
, in which our fashion experts turn their well-trained eyes on Draco Malfoy himself!).
Something soft crept into Draco’s expression, and Harry almost had to look away.
Malfoy sighed dramatically and pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Potter.  Do you have any idea how many unbelievably wealthy and influential people have requested my services so far this evening?”
They were at the fifth pub, pleasantly buzzed (and totally exhausted) when Harry realised just how bad an idea this was.  It wasn’t only the fact that Sneezewort was a terrible microbrewery-cum-garden that made its own beers, inspired by commonly-used potions (Harry would rather be drinking drain cleaner than Skele-gro Stout): he was also having a very hard time keeping his hands off Draco.
“You want him to move in.” There was no expression in Ron’s voice, which Harry knew was a very bad sign. “You’re going to ask
Harry was torn, as he pulled Draco back down, between wanting to get his hands and lips on every inch of skin and the need to look into Draco’s eyes, kiss his lips, reaffirm that this was actually happening between them; and every time they made eye contact, Draco was smiling that rare, fond, beautiful smile.
“I don’t know what you want to hear.  I don’t know if anything can excuse what I said.  What I do know is that I was wrong, and I’m sorry, and I miss you.  The whole sodding house misses you!  And I’m certainly not going to be able to make amends if you’re hiding all the way out here.”
The awful painting of Sirius’s mum was finally gone too, replaced with a mirror that was very critical of Harry’s hair but overall much more pleasant, and also made the entrance hall feel bigger.
See you on Thursday.
Harry caught Draco’s eye and grinned, but for some reason Draco’s smile didn’t quite reach his eyes, and he looked away first.  “What can I say? This house adores me.  I’ve certainly changed things for the better round here."
“Ron,” Hermione said patiently, “we’ve talked about this.”
Harry knew he was still blushing, and was thankful that Draco had decided to punctuate his instruction with kisses against Harry’s collarbone rather than looking him in the eye.  Somewhere between the thought of doing
Harry wasn’t really paying attention to the rest of the table, though, because now Draco was focused entirely on him, his gaze flicking down to Harry’s lips, and how they had thought they could keep this to themselves for even a few hours was beyond him.
“It’s
On the fourth floor are the two final rooms; one of which is clearly Draco’s bedroom, judging by the snakes present throughout the decor and the warm grey walls - though this has widely become a trend in design circles, it was of course pioneered by Draco in his unforgettable transformation of the Zabini family’s summerhouse.  I am somewhat surprised to see the room so sparse, empty but for the luxurious bed with matching nightstands, and a wardrobe worthy of any member of the
Draco tightened his grip on Harry for a moment.  “I must admit that I’m impressed,” he murmured eventually.  “I was a little afraid I’d have to spend most of tonight nursing you through some kind of sexual identity crisis.”
Also, Kreacher’s the house-elf you’re thinking of - he went to work at Hogwarts and became a sort of leader there in the Battle; I think he quite liked feeling important. I felt bad asking him to move back here by himself after all that.
With that, Malfoy headed back into the crowd with a dramatic swish of his robes.
at all, actually.  It didn’t matter who’d spoken to the press.  You were looking for a reason to distance yourself.”
P.S. If you want to escape the brocade, I’m going to the Leaky after work with Ron and the rest of our team as well as Hermione, Luna and their lot - you should come down.  Lisa might be there too; I know you two love getting drunk and judging people’s outfits.
“You… are the most ridiculous, infuriating, wonderful person I have ever met,” Draco said eventually. He leaned in closer and murmured, “I’d already forgiven you, you know.  The chocolate was more than enough.” Then, so quickly Harry wasn’t entirely sure he didn’t imagine it, Draco pressed a firm kiss onto his lips, before opening the front door with a flick of his wand and striding inside, with the painting following him obediently.
P.P.S. You do not have five million bedrooms; you have eight.  If I can renovate a sprawling mansion with multiple whole wings (not to mention the grounds), you can sort out the Black house without unnecessary hyperbole.
“It’s not fair.  And it’s not exactly what I meant.  I’m making such a mess of this.”  Harry ran a hand through his hair in frustration.  “If you’d read any of the letters it would help; they were a lot more articulate.”
Harry cracked up at his spot-on rendition of Ron, who had refused to come and look at it for the ‘millionth time’, and even told Hermione, “If you love me you’ll keep me company down here: I’m starting to think you and Malfoy are going to run off together and move into some poncy art gallery.”
“‘I wish he was mine, he’s really divine; the hero who conquered the Dark Lord’,” Draco finished, nearly dissolving into hysterics.  “That was such a good day.”

Harry nodded, and went to sit down.  He’d never seen Malfoy really working before. Well, he’d been involved in the design plans for Grimmauld Place of course: consultations, unnecessarily complicated ‘mood boards’, fabric samples, all of that; but it was different from seeing the man actually breaking a sweat.  Manual work was far removed from his image of the aristocratic Draco Malfoy, and therefore rather unsettling, but oddly mesmerising.  Every movement was careful and deliberate, but clearly well-practised, and Harry was really bloody impressed to see the bits of wood transforming into actual furniture - beautiful furniture, at that.
“Draco’s right,” Harry agreed.  “In fact, I’m tempted to send an owl to Pansy Parkinson right now and invite her to do that Grimmauld Place special edition, solely in honour of this painting.  Maybe
Draco just laughed, and Harry found himself laughing too - had he ever felt this joyful in bed with someone before? - stopping only to gasp when Draco pressed a proprietary hand onto his dick.  Draco’s expression turned more intense, and he squeezed again with a smirk before bending down to pull Harry’s pants off completely.
“Nutters, both of them,” Ron said from across the table.
No sooner had they stepped into the - admittedly impressive - entrance hall than they were accosted by Draco Malfoy himself.
Harry brushed his hair back and sighed.  He felt as if they had the same conversation every time he saw Ginny.  “I know you don’t get it, but it feels like the right thing to do.  Yes, maybe part of her does want us to get back together, but I can’t just refuse to see her.  We’ve been friends for a really long time.”
Harry thought he knew all there was to know about Draco, so it was exhilarating to learn that kissing the side of his neck made him inhale sharply, and that biting his ear elicited this choked-off gasping noise, which may have been Harry’s new favourite sound in the world.  Even though – or perhaps, precisely because - they had spent years trading slurs and insults, there was something especially thrilling about Draco’s familiar cut-glass accent muttering swear words under the onslaught of pleasure.
“Nice?” Draco replied, with barely concealed irritation. “It’s beyond nice.  It’s a masterpiece.  It’s possibly one of Moonstone’s greatest artistic accomplishments to date.”
Harry tugged him back by the sleeve. “Um, for what?”
When the Wizengamot handed down the sentence, representative Elphias Doge stated, “While we cannot deny that Malfoy made the choice to become a Death Eater and follow in his father’s footsteps, it is clear that the full implications of this decision were beyond his understanding as he was not yet of age.  Indeed, many adult wizards might well have acted in the same way, had they been threatened with torture by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.  We must not take Malfoy’s actions lightly, especially as there is no dispute that he gave Death Eaters access to Hogwarts School, but we must also remember that he is still very young.  To sentence him to Azkaban would be to remove any opportunity for rehabilitation.”
“So do you,” Luna added calmly.
“I’m trying to narrow down the curtains for Greg and Millie’s nursery, and you are a welcome distraction.” Draco put down the sample he was holding and looked at Harry for an uncomfortable moment.  “You look like hell; what happened?”
“I could have gone to Sunday lunch at the Zabinis’ today,” Draco announced with a long suffering sigh. “They appreciate me.”  But he poured them all another glass of wine, anyway.
She stared at him, clearly trying not to cry, and he felt awful that one of the toughest people he knew had been reduced to tears by his words.
“I can see that,” Ron said miserably, eying the arm Draco had draped around Harry’s shoulders with distrust.
Don’t make any unsupervised changes before then, please.
“Think what you like, but
devoted readers, is the relationship between Draco and Potter.  In all the years I’ve known Draco, I’ve witnessed many conflicts between the two of them, and many of our mutual friends have confessed to me that they’re concerned about the unusual friendship.  “When the two of them are together, they bicker constantly,” one source told me.  “It’s exhausting really; feels like we’re still at school.”
“Correction: the kind of thing I’d have done six bloody years ago! I thought we were past all this childish nonsense; I didn’t realise I still had to work every day to prove myself worthy of the great Harry Potter’s trust.  I’m your friend, for Merlin’s sake!  Not to mention that you’re providing the roof over my head.  What possible motive could I have to make up some hateful story and try to sell you out? I don’t even know Ginevra; we barely make small talk when she comes to visit you.”
Malfoy sighed but couldn't help a smug smile slipping onto his face.  “If you think these are good, just wait until you see the final products.  Carpentry’s my speciality, you know.”
Something suddenly clicked in Harry’s head.  “Like the Vanishing Cabinets.”
“I’m not insane, Ron.  And I haven’t asked him yet; I wanted to know what you thought first.  Not that I couldn’t have guessed.”
Witch Weekly Homes!
“I suppose you can’t ever know what’s going on behind closed doors,” Derek tells me.
Eventually, Malfoy lowered the chair down onto the ground and cast some protective spells before banishing it gently into a corner.
Harry knew his shock must show on his face. They’d been ignoring this, this
“Work smart, not hard, Granger,” Draco said smugly.  “I just tore out that part of the wall and had it replaced.  Great Aunt Walberga’s sitting in Gringotts with some of the portraits from the Manor, probably having a lovely time.”
Harry sipped his wine and stared at the door.  He knew Draco was right about Ginny - and so were Hermione, and the guys from work, and Pansy sodding Parkinson… even Ron, though he only spoke up when his sister had particularly annoyed him - but he wasn’t ready to admit it to himself.  He’d loved her so much, back then, and he
“Don’t worry,” Harry interjected quickly, glaring at Draco for springing this on them.  “I can just sleep in a different room.”
Some part of Harry eventually found the wherewithal to ask, “Shall we take this to the bedroom?”
“All those people staring at you, and making those remarks.
Draco, infuriatingly, just raised an eyebrow.  “I assume you’re here to beg me for forgiveness.  With lavish gifts.”
“Even if that’s the case, you didn’t have to be quite so nasty about it,” Hermione pointed out.  “I never thought I’d say this, but I miss having Malfoy around, especially on pub nights.  He’s the only person who’s even remotely useful at the quiz.”  She put down her mug and looked at Harry.  “Have you had any more ideas what to do to solve this?  Clearly you need a new approach.”
“I’d much rather keep my hair back while I’m doing that, you know,” Draco said with no real reproach.  He pulled off his own underwear, and Harry took a moment to admire the view before tugging Draco back down on top of him so they were pressed together, skin on skin, from head to toe, and this was what Harry wanted, not quite as good as Draco’s mouth - how could it be, really? - but amazing in its own right; every inch of him against every inch of Draco, perfectly matched.
“That makes sense,” Harry admitted, “I haven’t really got my head round it yet.”
Malfoy’s glare deepened.  “You were made to be an Auror, you know.  The rest of the population would say it’s too early for you to be questioning me like this.”
Harry’s jaw dropped.  “Malfoy, that was nearly thirteen hours ago.”
When they eventually broke apart,  there was a kind of awe on Draco’s face and Harry knew his expression was the same.

“Fun might be a bit much.  But the catering’s definitely a lot better than at Ministry dos, I’ll give you that.”  To be fair, Harry had no choice but to concede that point, with a drink in one hand and his third plate of dessert in the other.  “I do know, though, that if you were in my shoes you’d have asked for a few favours before accepting the invitation.”
Before Draco could reply, Sapphy appeared with a crack.  Harry never would have pictured himself as a dinner party person, but with her as guest-chef and dining tables that felt a bit too big with just two of them, he actually didn’t mind hosting every now and again.  Draco had to stay well away from the kitchen, though: his last and only attempt to cook something more elaborate than a stir fry ended when he launched a tray of potatoes across the room at Harry, yelling, “This is nothing like Potions, you absolute bastard!”
“Um…” he said articulately, watching Malfoy’s smirk grow with every second of silence that passed.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco said with a yawn.  “I’m a delight. You love me.”
“Draco,” Harry murmured, nudging him with his elbow.
“Yeah, maybe,” Potter says, smiling at Draco.
“Well, there’s the first fashion victim of the night.  What on earth happened to you?”  Draco stood at the end of the table, one eyebrow raised at Harry’s oversized DMLE t-shirt and undersized athletic shorts.
“About eighteen hours ago,” Draco admitted.
“Not that I don’t want to - because I very, very much want to,” Draco replied, stroking Harry’s cheek, “but are you sure?  You’ve had a stressful evening, and I understand if you’re not ready for anything else right now.”
Hours could have passed for all Harry knew as they stayed locked together, sometimes taking a moment to stare at each other in affirmation, but mostly just kissing each other as if it were as essential as breathing, trying to get as close as possible. Harry felt that maybe, if they did this long enough, it would somehow make up for all the time they’d lost by pretending this heat, this tension between them wasn’t there.
“Of course we have, Harry,” she replied, as if it were perfectly obvious.  Harry was amazed that the urge to run and hide was only now setting in.  “Now, Ron, be nice.”
Malfoy answered after a couple of moments, looking rumpled and exhausted, and Harry immediately handed him a sickly-sweet mocha.
The press release stated: “St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries is delighted to announce that the Malfoy family has donated their estate in Wiltshire for us to use as a residential facility.
“Steady on,” Potter says, “it’s a bit soon to be talking about marriage, isn’t it?”
“I was just going to pick up something for dinner,” Harry said.  “I assume you haven’t eaten.”
“So what?  We’re friends, and it was funny.  Besides, if you want to talk about being famous; the main reason
Harry gasped, overwhelmed by the sensation.  He found himself muttering, “Fuck,
Malfoy smiled, though it didn’t quite reach his eyes.  “Oh, please.  I know you must feel terribly put upon by being dragged out at all sorts of events, but I’ve seen how many petits fours you’ve put away, and I also witnessed you, Weasley, and Zabini actually standing together and laughing.  Part of me does regret for your sake that this soiree is happening today, but you must admit that you’ve had fun.”
“Really?” Draco asked, and Harry shook his head.  “You’re an unbelievable idiot sometimes,” Draco told him affectionately.
Don’t you have a house-elf for that sort of thing? I seem to recall Mother being especially fond of it.  If you do insist on cleaning them yourself, you should be using a squeeze of murtlap essence in your solution.
,” she added, though the glance she shot at Harry indicated that she definitely did.  “Draco’s a simple person, really.  He craves attention, and he loves to be loved.  I’m sure you can come up with something.”
“No, you can’t,” I agree.  But, as you know, dear readers, you can always rely on
Draco threw his hands in the air.  “Okay, fine, a bit of both. I don’t like when she marches into this house as if she owns the place saying she’s ‘just popping in for chat’ and then kicks me off my spot on the settee for hours, and I certainly don’t like how much anxiety she gives you just by showing up, but that’s hardly grounds for a smear campaign.”
Harry wasn’t surprised that no one argued with her, and he didn’t have the energy to fight his corner against all three of them.  “Well?” he asked, “What should I do next?”
This is the single greatest thing anyone has ever done for me, was what Harry thought.  This is the first time in my life I’ve ever really, truly had my own place and it’s perfect.
Malfoy tried to glower at him, but it was clear he was too tired to muster any real hostility. “You brought me a pain au chocolat, if you recall.”
“But it’s not the same.  All the photos are ruined now; the players won’t fly properly where the paper was ripped.”
, and last spring’s runaway success,
“Really?” asked Malfoy, clearly intrigued.
“Too much information, mate,” he heard Ron say in a strangled voice.
“It’s only for a week,” Draco insisted.  “Thanks, you two.  This will make everything much easier, especially as I have to get people in to replace half the walls, yet again.  Why did everyone in the family think Permanent Sticking Charms were a good way to decorate?”

will be the first to hear when wedding bells are in the air.
“Art is not pointless,” Draco replied.  “If you think that, you just haven’t been exposed to the right kind.  I love my mother more than anyone else in the world, but if I had to choose between her picture on my wall and something by Georgianna Moonstone, it would be a nearly impossible decision.”
“This is really happening,” Harry found himself muttering, as if still unsure, and Draco’s only response was to nod, whisper Harry’s name, and lean in to kiss him again.
“Actually, he’s invited quite a few people from school,” Hermione interjected.  “I must admit, I’m not dying to go back to that place – but I’m also incredibly curious to see how it’s changed.  Not to mention how much Malfoy’s changed.  We all received his apology letters; I think it’ll be good to show that we support him if he’s trying to start afresh.”
have been dying to see inside Harry Potter’s London residence, formerly the home of the esteemed Black family.  At the end of last year, it underwent a complete renovation at the talented hands of Draco Malfoy, who even moved into the premises in order to fully oversee the project.
“Why do you always make it sound like I don’t have a choice in any of this?”
Harry could barely speak, just shook his head.  "I told her how I feel, and I really think she got it.  I’m not sad, not really. I know everyone seemed to think it was ‘meant to be’ or something, and it definitely wasn’t - but I’ve closed the door completely, now, and it’s hard.  I suppose my future’s really all up to me, and this just makes it even more obvious that I haven’t got a clue what to do with it.”
Talking to the pair, however, they dispute this.
Focus, he thought.  He tried to take an interest in the heated argument Draco was having with Hermione about house-elf living quarters.
“Good,” said Draco softly.  “Same.”
Harry tried angling his head to see what she saw, but to him it still looked like colours and shadows and spaces.
Luna stopped and looked between Harry and Draco. “It’s good that you two are together again.  When it was only Harry here, the energy wasn’t right, and it’s not just because of all the Nargles you’ve got in the plants downstairs.”
“It’s not like I was prepared for this, okay?  Next time I’ll do laundry before I let you accost me,” Harry said defensively.
“You’re home early,” Draco commented from the sofa when Harry Flooed in.
“That is a bit of a shame,” Draco confesses, “because the fourth floor was looking wonderful.  There is far better light for the Moonstone downstairs, though.  Since Pansy’s already been nosing around, I suppose we can allow some photographs now.”  (See next page for our unique peek into Harry Potter’s bedroom - you’re welcome, readers!)
“I can’t believe…” Harry began.  “I mean, this.  That was… You...”
Draco tilted his head to one side, clearly pondering all the possibilities.
Before the two of them could descend into a petty argument, Hermione said, “It’s fine, really, Harry, it’ll be nice to have you back for a bit.  I’ve got a big presentation due for the Centaur Collaboration Committee on Friday so won’t be around much I’m afraid, but at least Ron will have some company.  You might have to battle with Crookshanks though; he’s adopted your old room and you know how he is.”
Today, the youngest Malfoy also received a sentence of house arrest, in his case for twelve months.  Many expected Draco to be sent to Azkaban, following reports that he was instrumental in aiding You-Know-Who in his efforts to invade Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1997, as well as participating in the torture of prisoners at his family home.
Malfoy couldn’t contain his amusement.  “Your acceptance is touching, Potter.  Thanks.”
He fumbled with Draco’s fly, and once again Draco took pity on him and undid it himself, climbing back off the bed to pull his trousers off and tugging at Harry’s, raising an eyebrow at Harry’s ratty old boxer shorts.
Draco seemed to consider his response carefully, opening his mouth a few times before finally saying, “Of course I’m happy.  I’m one of very few people in the world who knows exactly what Harry Potter likes in the bedroom.  I’m going to make a fortune from

“Merlin, why does everything he does have to be so dramatic?” Ron moaned.
Draco was clearly pleased with his response.  “You didn’t do
“Because every time she calls, you answer.  Every time she Floos in, you stop whatever you’re doing to spend time with her.  It’s admirable that you’re trying so hard to do the right thing, but where are your feelings in any of this?  You’ve cancelled work drinks more than once because she showed up out of the blue, and been really annoyed about it, if you recall.  In fact, you and I are meant to be having Muggle film night this evening, in case you’d forgotten.  I got the only white wine you like and everything.”  Draco folded his arms and pouted like a child who’d been deprived of his favourite toy.  It would have been funny had Harry not felt so horribly guilty.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “It’s pretty self-explanatory.”
“What. The Fuck. Is this?” he ground out.  Draco, the slimy bastard, looked genuinely confused for a second as he picked up the magazine.
tradition,” Draco corrected him. “Merlin knows why he started inviting your lot.”
Harry’s team laughed uproariously, and Harry tried to keep his face firmly planted on the table until they’d stopped talking about it.  He chanced a glance up at Draco, who was clearly trying to find a balance between wanting to laugh at Harry’s expense and wanting to be on his side. The traitor chose the first option, but not before passing a pint Harry’s way.
Potter,
“We worked closely with the Malfoy family throughout the recent redevelopment of the Manor, and are pleased that the changes to the residence will enable us to provide living quarters, teaching spaces, gardens, and many other state-of-the-art facilities.
“Oh, thank Merlin.  If you want me to Incendio that entire outfit I would be glad to.”
At least, Harry reasoned, Draco knew how to win over his colleagues.  They hardly ever made Death Eater comments these days - and Harry was willing to be the butt of the joke (pun intended, he thought miserably) if that was what it took.
Ron shook his head.  “I thought you and your friends were different, ‘Mione, but maybe all women are obsessed with houses and nesting after all.”
, our source claimed, “Harry and Ginny have been friends for a long time, and Ginny still dreams of them spending the rest of their lives together.  She’s been making a real effort; going to visit him as often as possible with their packed schedules, and even giving him a season ticket to her games.”  They went on to allege, “Ginny’s been so intent on getting him back on the same page that she’s been bringing love potions with her on their dates in the hopes of slipping some into his drink.  She thinks a few sips will help him remember just how great they are together, and their genuine love and connection will take it from there.”
, your number one source of celebrity news, to see whether she gets her man!
Draco hit him on the arm lightly. “Harry, don’t be a prick.”
Then Draco reached down, too, and it was cramped and awkward and wonderful as they jerked each other; eyes fixed on one another, wrapped so tightly together that Harry couldn’t tell where he ended and Draco began, and suddenly it was all too much. He tried to tell Draco that he was coming but he couldn’t form words before his orgasm overtook him, but it was okay because Draco was crying out and shuddering against him, too, and he could feel them both shaking until the pleasure started to subside and reality crept back in around the edges of his awareness.
It had to mean something, though, that every fibre of his being would much rather spend the evening getting slightly pissed and listening to Draco Malfoy’s commentary on Muggle cinema.
Harry couldn’t curb his instincts when faced with the cold, aloof version of Malfoy he used to despise so much, and snapped, “Why do you think I’m here, you idiot?”
For a long time, readers of
Harry felt as if his heart were going to beat its way right out of his chest.  Somehow it was different to hear the words themselves, even though Draco had already sort of told him.
“No one answers.  We go in, super cautious - the guy may have owled us but there’s still some dodgy shit going on down in Knockturn.  Harry’s all, ‘Aurors, come out with your wand in the air!’  The whole place is dark and covered in dust sheets, really suspicious, like.  Then suddenly there’s this scream like a banshee, and this thing falls on Harry, like out of nowhere.  When the lights finally come on,  Harry’s lying in the middle of the floor with this massive Kneazle sitting on his chest, and he’s covered in bright green paint!
Pansy’s trying to get a promotion at work and says the ‘only way’ is if you let her do an exclusive look at Grimmauld Place.  Apparently everyone wants to see inside your house - she tried selling it to me on the grounds that it’ll drive up my business, but I’m swimming in clients and it’s your home.  What do you think?
Harry was acutely aware that  he was just standing there blinking like a moron.  The place was such a nightmare that finding somewhere to begin seemed impossible, not to mention the fact that he’d assumed Malfoy would need a lot more persuading before he had to work out the logistics.
Although Draco wasn’t doing much flying or anything near Harry’s punishing training regime, he was still really bloody fit.  The manual parts of his job were paying off especially, Harry observed, because Draco had very nice arms.  He didn’t think he’d ever paid attention to anyone’s arms before… but then again, he hadn’t ever paid that much attention to another man’s body before.  When he thought about it, though, his girlfriends had always been slim and athletic, too; perhaps he had a type.  If he did, Draco was the perfect example; all pale and lean and gorgeous.
“I don’t know, actually,” Harry said.
“He’s been quite nice in the letters.  I mean, still... I dunno, snarky?” Harry shrugged. “But when it’s directed at other people he’s actually pretty funny.”
Draco’s face closed off, and he suddenly looked too much like the horrible, entitled little boy he’d worked so hard to leave in the past.  Harry felt his stomach sink.
“Was it his conscience, or was he just bored and splashing around his dad’s cash?” Ron wondered aloud.
“When I asked him to move in, I really didn’t expect us to get along this well,” Potter tells me. “I just thought it was ridiculous that he was travelling to and from his mum’s every day when I had so many spare rooms so close to his work.  But I’ve got to say, it’s worked out brilliantly.”
Hermione smacked Ron on the arm, hard, and Harry didn’t have to admit that he too had spent some of Sunday poring over the pictures of the unrecognisable Manor, wondering whether Malfoy could use his newfound decorating skills to get some of the more stressful paintings out of Grimmauld Place.
“‘I want it to be like Gryffindor Tower,’” he said in an unerring impression of Harry. “Warm, cosy, you know?  With, uh, pictures of my friends, and my parents.  I haven’t really thought much about it beyond that, sorry’.”
“Oh, I don’t mean it like
“I didn’t
“I suppose we do bicker sometimes,” Draco admits, “but there’s nothing malicious in it at this point.  I imagine us more like an old married couple.”
Harry’s embarrassment returned in full force.  “It’s a bit much, really, but Luna kept going on about grand gestures, and I know you’ve wanted this - well, something like this - for ages.  It took a lot of negotiating but it’s yours.  Kind of a gift to the house, too.  I figured maybe it’d start to like me as much as it likes you.”
Her eyes widened.  “What?”
“This is what I get for trying to be nice,” Draco complained.  “Maybe I should go back to being a total prat to you.”  His voice changed to the sneer Harry remembered from school.  “Of course I love myself, Potter; what’s not to love?  I have a marvellous job, excellent bone structure, two living parents, and a bigger penis than you.”
between them for so long that sometimes Harry was sure it was all in his head. He just stared at Draco, watched as he licked his lips, swallowed, and repeated, more confidently this time, “I can make you happy.  If you’ll let me.”
Luckily, they were sitting next to each other, so it was easy to press their legs together under the rather cramped table with no one raising an eyebrow, but Draco looked especially gorgeous in the afternoon sunshine, and some of his shiny blond hair had come out of its ribbon on the walk over from the Leaky. It was taking all Harry’s willpower not to reach out and tuck it behind his ear: he absolutely couldn’t do that, though, because if he did he’d end up caressing Draco’s face, and then kissing him, and then trying to climb onto his lap and finish what they’d started this morning, before they heard Hermione’s shrill voice from the Floo downstairs telling them off for being late.
Pansy Parkinson, attempting to reinvent herself by writing freelance gossip columns while living out her own house arrest, reported that items from Malfoy Manor had started to show up in auction houses across the country, and even in some of the more reputable establishments in Knockturn Alley.  The Greengrass family purchased a handcrafted self-playing piano at great expense, Pansy claimed, in hopes of securing a marriage between their youngest daughter and Draco Malfoy.  It shocked much of pureblood society to hear that they’d been turned down flat, but at least the Malfoys threw in a triptych of priceless tapestries woven from Demiguise hair to soften the blow.
“Do you think at any point in the last day I’ve been able to think clearly enough to come up with a PR strategy?” Harry retorted.  Even Draco flushed at this, and Harry felt vindicated that he wasn’t the only one dying of embarrassment right now.
team, have been not-so-secretly hoping that the couple are once again heading towards their happily ever after.
Since its completion, neither Draco nor Potter have been willing to allow the press to see inside the house: Amelia Emmensworth, a former reporter for
“Not really, sorry.” Harry shrugged.  “We always end up getting Chinese so I zoned out after the first five or six options.”
that, but…”
Draco lay down, still smiling, and stretched like a satisfied cat.  “I think I left my wand downstairs,” he said eventually, gesturing between the two of them  “Do you mind?”
“Tom says there’s a hen party coming in later,” Draco said casually. “At least they’ll get to enjoy
Harry could feel himself blushing, and Draco sighed with exasperation, but then smirked at Harry as if in challenge.   Harry felt himself grinning back, wondering if he was really going to start snogging Draco Malfoy in the middle of the world’s worst beer-garden.  When their lips met, it was to a chorus of shrieks and catcalls from their friends, and Harry didn’t care one bit.
“Granted.  And Ron?”
“Partly because I haven’t been around the wizarding world much for a long time.  I ran away from reactions like that.”
“Something is afoot,” Draco said.  “A-foot or a-fin.  The Anggitay and now this.  Maybe an ichthyocentaur will turn up for me to liaise with.”  But the water was still now.
“Do I know you?”  Lucius asked, turning to Harry again.
him.  We’re friends.  And it’s a research trip, at least partly….”
“Again – what kind of coffee do you want, Malfoy?”
Draco’s exhaustion was beginning to catch up with him.  But there was one more thing – what was it – Snape.  “What happened to Professor Snape, Harry?”
Harry told himself.
Malfoy drew the pen from his lips where he’d sucked the tip.  “As you like.”  He placed it upright on the parchment, where it began to write.
Potter looked around as if he expected to see the Giant Squid of Hogwarts rise up out of the pond or crawl across the lawn.
Andromeda left as soon as he arrived, but she had a meal all prepared for Teddy and him, so that was easy enough.  After they ate, Teddy wanted to fly around the garden on his toy broom, so Draco watched him and gave some pointers until the light waned.  “Time for bed soon.  Let’s pick out a bedtime story.”
These days Potter’s hair might be the color of a very chalky blackboard, but his eyes were still brilliant green.
he told himself.
“I didn’t say they make
They regarded each other for a long time, and then the bear turned to lick its fur, reminding Harry of a cat whose dignity has been slighted.
“I’m not an Auror. I found an injured Mooncalf and Luna told me to bring it here.”
Potter didn’t say anything. Draco forced himself to look up.
“Don’t worry,” Harry said.
“I think the school would be best for you.  You’ll soon be better.”

Potter looked back, eyes serious.  “Talk to Dumbledore.”
“Because I don’t want to make a mistake my first day,” said Teddy.
“To meet your millipedes?”
8888888
don’t seem to work in these rooms.”
“Relax, Malfoy, I’m sure it’s back there in the Forbidden Forest with my body.”
“Thanks, Ron, but I can’t at the moment.  Soon, though.  It’s great to see you.”
How did it start?  Perhaps when Lily held a fallen flower in her hand and found she could make the petals open and close, delighting their mother.
“Good afternoon.  Do I know you?”
“Not bad, except on the holidays.”
“Yeah and they eat wolverine stew!  And she has a dogsled and the dogs’ names are Melvin, Louise, Phoebe, and – and –”
“I am sorry about what happened, Potter.  Allow me to buy you a pint.  There’s a nice wizarding pub not far from here with a riverside garden.”
The beast tilted one head in a puzzled way.
“I don’t doubt it, dear, but what caused this turn-around?”
Draco’s chocolate frog jumped from the wrapping onto his shoulder.  Bemused, he brought his other hand up.  The frog hopped onto his palm and then leapt up to – kiss his cheek?! – before bounding away.
Draco gave him a sharp look.
“Yes,” Harry breathes back.  He breathes – he lives.  And in return for the news of her own son’s life, Narcissa lies to Voldemort so Lily’s son can live.
Slightly unnerved, Harry opened his eyes and pushed his glasses back up his nose until they felt normal.
Next morning the North Wind puffed himself up to a great size and carried Harry high up into the sky.  They rushed along so fast that when Harry glanced down he could see stormy waves crashing in the ocean.  He was a bit worried that they’d cause a shipwreck.
“They’re called pongololos.”
8888888
Draco was taken secretly to Grimmauld Place while they tried to decide what to do. He met his cousin Nymphadora for the first time.  She was so utterly unlike either his mother or aunt Bellatrix that he wondered what her mother could be like.
“Not our country, not our problem.”
“Give me my glasses, Malfoy.”
❄     ❄     ❄
8888888
Harry tried to rouse him, and called:
“I – thanks.”  Just because the quiet would be such a relief, Harry told himself as he followed Draco back again.  He spent awhile bunching up and tying off the areas of net that had holes in them.  When he had finished, the net was so shortened that it was a bit hard to tuck in around the spare bed, but he didn’t want to mention it.  Feeling awkward, he decided the best thing would be just to go to bed.  It was dark already, and Draco was reading by candlelight.
She pointed to a mean-looking red-eyed troll with no nose at all.
“You know,” he added once his mouth wasn’t busy elsewhere, “Zambia’s not far from here, and they have zebras there.”
Harry shook himself.  “Enjoy your coffee.”  But when Malfoy eventually left, the cup was still full.
When Harry arrived at their agreed upon meeting place, he saw Draco pulling up in the vintage car. “Are you really going to drive this?” Harry asked.
Prompt:
wouldn’t have left
“Mmm, good question.  Let’s find out.”
He was thrashing on his bed, lost in a nightmare.  Draco rolled up and caught Potter’s hand.  “Potter!  Wake up.  It’s just a dream.  You’re all right, stop screaming.”
“I don’t really care who your parents are,” Potter said.
“Who’s the wrong sort?” Teddy asked.
Harry was dubious.  “So you’re going to become the Prince of Cichlids?”
“Mount Emei is famous for its monkeys.  They’re Tibetan macaques.  They’ve been known to throw people’s cameras down ravines if they don’t get what they want.”
Back home at Grimmauld Place, he barely had time to make a cup of tea when a barn owl was tapping on the window with a note.  The handwriting was elegant, the message infuriating.
“—know much about them?” Draco asked. It was back, that longing for connection with Potter, for acknowledgement.
“What was wrong with the food at school?” Harry said. “I loved it.”
“Really?  Why does she do that?”
“Really?”
Draco showed them the shirt with the three spots of candle wax that Harry had let fall, that sad night in their own bed so long ago and far away.  “Let her just wash three spots out of it.  For I’m sure the one who can wash my night-shirt is the one I ought to have, and I’ll marry none other.”
“Mmmm.”  Draco plus Ron equalled a problem Harry didn’t see a solution to.  Maybe Hermione could help, but she had even less cause to like Draco.
“So you have to be prepared to sing to that beast every time you go in there?” Draco asked.
“Yeah, ‘cause she gives the kid a moose call!  And she takes books to the gold miners!   Books about kittens and pirates.  And cowboys.”
Harry shook his head.  Hermione squeezed his hand.
“Always.”
“Excuse me,” he said, handing it back to her.  “Is it Padma Patil?”
They said their goodbyes and Ron and Hermione walked off, Hermione giving one last curious look over her shoulder.
“I’d be happy never to have to eat another mushroom again,” Harry said.  “I had enough of them in the Forest of Dean to last me a lifetime.”
“I’m a bit – tired – but perhaps it’s as well we don’t wait.  Go ahead, then,” Dumbledore said.  He looked like he could barely stand, what was wrong with him?  Even his eyes were falling shut.
They landed on a mountainside, somewhere snowy and moonlit and quiet. The air smelled like cedar. Stars twinkled in the frosty air.
“Um – I’m an English teacher.”
“No fish, then, that’s good.”
The dark jarring notes returned louder and more threatening, but the melody of determination, now stronger and joyful, broke in, building to a crescendo, sustained, triumphant, and then releasing in small sobs of relief, a gradual diminuendo, some somberness, but finally peace.
“It means your true friend, the one who understands you deeply. There’s an old Chinese story about a statesman Boya and a wood-cutter Zhong Ziqi. Boya was playing a zither by himself on a boat at night. He was thinking about the mountains as he played. The woodcutter heard the music from the shore, and exclaimed ‘Ah, this music is as majestic as a mountain.’ Then Boya thought about rivers as he played, and Zhong Ziqi said ‘This music is as vast as a great river!’ Boya felt that Zhong Ziqi was the only listener who truly heard and recognised him.”
“I would never forget Sweetie-pie,” Harry murmured.
Longbottom wished him luck, and turned toward the door to the groundskeeper’s hut.
“Oh, we have to see them then!  Your work’s almost over here, right?”
– like, oh, having someone
“What’s up with him?” asked the new owl after Draco left.
An interesting exclamation for a Gryffindor, Draco thought.  “Has this sort of thing happened to you often?  Snakes in the pipes?”
“Thank you, I am quite proud of them, I admit.  They are bred for power.  Come visit me in France, and perhaps we can teach you.  It would be an honor to instruct the descendant of Aurore Chevalier.”
“So,” Potter asked, “this gentle fellow, what else do you know about him?”
Potter gasped.
Lavender smiled. “Thanks! It’s been a lot of work but it’s fun. Do you want me to read your tea leaves?”
“Just curious.”
He stumbled over to the other bed, and sat down.  Just before he took his glasses off again, he noticed a pale hair on the blue pillowcase.  It made him think of Polyjuice potion, and as he lay down and finished tucking the net around himself, he wondered vaguely what it would be like to look in the mirror and see pale straight hair, grey eyes, an angular aristocratic face.  His mind’s eye filled in the rest of the lean body he’d seen emerge dripping from the lake that morning.  He turned his head against the pillow, pulled the sheet over him, smelled a faint, indescribable but pleasant scent.  He dropped off to sleep.
“This chair will greatly increase your mobility,” the healer said.  “You can even Apparate in it.  Be sure to renew the Cushioning Charms often, to prevent pressure sores, since you’ll spend so much time in it.”
Lavender came in. “Oh, my potion, wonderful! It was so helpful last month. Will you stay and have a cup of tea?”
Probably true.  “I never gave it back, did I?” Harry said somewhat guiltily.
“Actually it was sunny there,” Draco couldn’t help saying.
“I call it love,” Harry said. “That power you know nothing about.”
“I’m soaked too.” Draco stood and grasped the hem of his own jumper and tugged it over his head, shaking drops of water out of his blond hair as he emerged.  Harry stared at the pale chest and then flushed and looked away as Draco took off his boots and started pulling down his trousers.
“Hello Harry! Hello Draco.”
He crossed the street to meet Ron and Hermione, who Harry hadn’t noticed coming from the other direction.  As Harry watched dumbfounded, Draco bowed slightly to them both, took a deep breath, and began to sing.
A breeze was pushing dark clouds across the sky as he opened the gate of his reed fence to see, sitting on the porch with the cat on his lap, a smiling Draco Malfoy.  Harry’s jaw dropped.
Harry had found a Muggle teacher in London and taken lessons, and adapted a Muggle CD player for their flat.  Sometimes they went back to Paris on short trips to the jazz and blues clubs.  Harry had improved enough that he didn’t automatically use
“Huh – huh –” Draco panted.   The monster growled, too like a werewolf, and Draco shuddered.  Then he had an image of his mother, steely and self-contained.  He pulled himself together and sang the first thing that came into his head.
“Well – we were pretty evenly matched, but my broom was faster.”
That’s when Lily started using the violet perfume her mother used to wear.  The light, fresh fragrance seemed to keep her mother near.  When sorrow seized her, Lily would press her eyes shut, grip something to steady herself, and breathe.  Her mother’s love was rooted in her heart, and nothing could dislodge it.
Draco recited quietly.
“Hello, boy,” Potter said, holding out his hand. Old Timer ignored him.
“You are a force of nature, Harry Potter,” Draco said when they’d caught their breath.  “Here’s part of a poem I learned.  It’s another by Dafydd ap Gwilym, but no knobs in this one.  This is you.”  He leaned over Harry with shining eyes and recited.
“What are hamentashen?” Lavender asked, and soon she was jotting notes about cookie dough and the merits of poppyseed versus apricot filling.
“Is this true, Gabriel?” Harry asked.
.  But that hex - I’m surprised you knew anything that dark.  Where did you find it?”
“The one with the wyvern on it?” the snake said in a rustling voice. “I can tell you that.”
So he tried to make them true.
It might have been a good suggestion, if Draco weren’t uneasy about thestrals and afraid of hippogriffs.  But he could hardly admit that to Potter, who seemed to make a habit of riding on beasts that would terrify any sensible person.
“We have to finish the book first!”
“With that hex, in the bathroom, sixth year,” Harry clarified.  “I didn’t know what it did.  And I thought you were going to Crucio me.”
The chief wizard, a small austere man resplendent in brocaded silk, agreed to help Rutherford after the tournament.  He pointed out an inconspicuous spot high in a corner of the sumo hall where she could perch. Rutherford settled in to watch the ring-entering ceremony.
Potter’s face filled with concern.  “I’m so sorry.”
But on this day, Draco was sitting cross-legged on the floor with Old Timer’s head in his lap and a worried look on his face.
The beast’s third head hit the ground with a thunk.  It snored.
“Well, she is damned intelligent.  And on the whole, it’s a relief not to have to pretend otherwise.  Come on, boyfriend, I’ll buy you an ice cream.”
“I’m not sure,” Harry said. “Glad to see my friends, and you and Teddy. Amazed how much he’s grown. Sorry I missed so much of it. Not sure what to do next.”
After a moment Malfoy shrugged and undid a couple of buttons at the top of his robe.  He pushed the collar aside, revealing the tip of a thin scar that began just under his collarbone.
“My favorite cousin is a Wizard-born Muggle. She went to Muggle schools and told me what she studied.  She liked literature classes.  I borrowed her books, and went on from there.”
“I am so sorry, Herman, are you all right?” Draco asked anxiously. “What went wrong? The pond should be clean, I just filled it with fresh water.”
Draco was temporarily distracted from answering because Harry’s lips got in the way.  “You like my mouth on me,” Draco said, emerging from the kiss.  “What’s more, you like my mouth on
He was shaking when he arrived at his flat.  He’d forgot that his position was supposed to be a joke.  He’d forgot that he wasn’t expected to make a difference.  He’d forgot that Draco Malfoy had nothing to offer.
^(OvO)^
“Going somewhere?”
She would not be able to track Potter while she was agitated, so Rutherford caught a vole to calm her nerves.  It had a piquant flavor, perhaps from the herbs it ate. French food truly was good….
They discussed it some more. In the end, they found Luna was happy to show Merfley where the Mooncalves danced by moonlight, and the two of them watched quietly and practiced under Luna’s Muffliato and Disillusionment Spells.
“Did you make friends with each other on the train?”
“My mother used to sing me songs about the moon,” Luna said. “Because of my name. I could sing them. It might be soothing.”
“Theobromancy,” Draco answered absently, gazing at the card he’d unwrapped, a portrait of a harassed-looking teenager with unruly hair and a lightning scar.
“Ready to turn over?”
Draco, squeezed between Harry and a young woman nursing her baby, merely remarked that it was lucky neither of them was tall.  There was little leg room, shoulder room, or any other kind of room, but they were better off than the conductor, who had no seat at all when the bus was full, and contorted his body into whatever limited space was available.  Children sat on laps, packages lay underfoot, and a few chickens flapped their wings disconsolately under the seats, legs tied together to prevent escape.
The more uncertain Harry sounded, the more confident Draco felt.
“He’s quite sweet. He had to go back to Thailand but I think Neville is there visiting him now.”
“What kind?”
He tied the note to the owl’s leg, stood pointedly at the window, and said, “Go.”  With a disdainful and equally pointed glare the owl flew off. He supposed he had just been rude to an owl.  Well, it was a Malfoy owl, it deserved it.
“I’m going to try to reschedule it,” Harry said.  “For lunch at my house next Saturday.”
“That’s certainly true.  And you say this is a problem in other countries?  In Britain too?”
“Poems, stories….”
Draco would have asked about this puzzling statement, but Harry’s eyes were lost in some unhappy place.  Draco shifted slightly so that his fingers brushed Harry’s.  He felt an electric tingle at the contact.  Harry glanced up and smiled at him, and something hummed in the air between them.
He went the other way at the first fork in the path, and walked for quite a distance (humming, in case Fluffy was about) without seeing anything more than some Bowtruckles.  A few times he called out, “Greetings to the centaurs of the Forbidden Forest!” feeling rather foolish since he never received any reply.
But before he could complete his analysis for Galaxy Zoo, she jumped back onto the keyboard and the screen went dark.  She was always discovering computer settings he knew nothing about.
Harry started to worry, and mentioned it to Hermione when she called.
“It’s only happened once to me,” said Draco.
Light was already fading from the sky; winter afternoons were short. Coloured lights twinkled in the distance. “Look, there’s a Christmas Market!” Harry said. Suddenly he was hungry. “Want to get something to eat? I’ve got some Muggle money on me.”
“Oh yes.  Give me your glasses.”
When Harry turned back, Malfoy was making his way over to a seat by the window. He gazed out, an unguarded, bleak look on his face. The steely light of an overcast winter afternoon fell on his angular face with a harsh beauty.
“Let me,” Harry breathed, and tugged at Draco’s shirt.  Draco let him.  His shirt came off and his scarred chest was laid bare.
“What, Snorkacks?”
Oh.  Draco hadn’t known they weren’t together any longer, although that could explain why he hadn’t seen her here visiting Potter.  But she wasn’t who Draco meant.
“I’ll bring the wyvern billiard stick, it may be a specialised wand in disguise. You should be the chief wyvern charmer. Bring every wyverny thing you’ve got.”
“I believe she is Rhiannon, riding from the Otherworld on her pale magic horse.  Her first name was Rigantona, the great goddess.  They called her Epona, the horse goddess, on the continent.  But the statue left out her birds.”
Harry asked, “Didn’t you ever want to just go far away and start over?”
back to me?  Is my pronunciation off?”
He lit the candle and drew back the sheet and saw Draco lying there, just as pale and fair-haired as when he was a white bear.  His eyes were closed, but Harry could see the pointy chin and nose and sharp cheekbones he’d so often touched or kissed or felt nestled against him.  Draco’s night-shirt was open in the front and rumpled up around his waist, so Harry could see his skin and limbs.  And whether he was handsome or not, he was Harry’s dear one, and Harry couldn’t stop looking.  He thought he couldn’t live if he didn’t give Draco a kiss there and then.
“Fresh…? Actually, he was in salt water before,” Harry said. “That’s why it stung so when it hit my eye.”
“What’s the Giant Squid doing way out here?” Harry asked. Though he might just as well ask what he and Malfoy were doing out here. Wherever here was.
“You’re not going to cheat me out of those riches!  Not when we’re finally going to be repaid for all our care of you, ungrateful wretch!” cried Uncle Vernon.
Malfoy’s eyes lit up.  “You’re on, Potter.”  He turned off the Souper-duper with a flick of his wand, disappeared briefly into the bedroom, and returned in flying robes, carrying his own broom.  “Lead the way.”
“It doesn’t?”
Meanwhile it was hot and the students complained that they couldn’t concentrate.  Harry flipped through the English textbook looking for something that might hold their interest.  No one wanted to work on grammar, himself included.  He found an excerpt from the novel
As the bus jolted to the side of the road to load and unload passengers at Nathenje, food vendors rushed up to the windows.  “Hungry?” Harry asked, looking out the window to see what was offered.
“Talk to Dumbledore, he can help you,” Potter said.
“You were having a bad dream.”
“Eep!  Eep!” said Harry.
Malfoy’s voice, at the end, sounded subdued, bleak even.  What had the war looked like from his side, to have changed him so much from the maliciously cocky child of privilege that he had once been?  Through Harry’s memory flashed a quick succession of moments – Draco sobbing in a bathroom at the murderous task that was beyond him, trembling as he confronted Dumbledore, helpless as Voldemort turned his home into a torture chamber, choking with grief at the death of his friend Vince.  Trapped by family allegiance and bad choices, desperate, terrified.  His courage, it seemed, had come afterwards – to look clearly at the past, to try moving in a new direction.
“I agree, but no one knows how to remove it, and it’s rather dangerous to try.  He took that secret to his grave.”
Draco flinched.  He couldn’t help it; his mind flashed to Fenrir Greyback with his curving yellow teeth and stench of blood.
“All right there, Malfoy?”
In a flash of silver, a stag Patronus leapt through the trees, startling him and the dog both.  Draco heard Potter’s voice emerge just before the apparition vanished. “Sing, Malfoy!”
₢⦿͡ ˒̫̮ ⦿͡ꀣ
“He’s more polite than he used to be. But he has the oddest delusions about wyverns. I can’t figure it out.”
“With Nott.”
“Yeah, go pummel Malfoy with some snowballs for me, Harry,” said Weasley.
“No worries.  We haven’t finished yet.  Not by a long ways.”
“It doesn’t really matter,” Draco answered with a humourless half-smile.  He turned to look at Harry, then squeezed his hand.  Before Harry could ask what he meant, Narcissa Malfoy stood in the doorway.
Mercifully, the song changed.  The new music was encouraging.
“Albus,” Snape said with pain in his voice, and clasped Dumbledore’s hands in his.  Then he placed the tip of his wand at Dumbledore’s chest, and with a look of bitter grief whispered,
Not much time left.
“How is Goyle, then?” Harry asked uncomfortably.  Crabbe and Goyle had been goons, but inseparable.  “Did he go to Europe like the other…”
^(OvO)^
Draco let himself into their ground floor flat.  Harry was in the living room, curled up in his stocking feet in an armchair by the window.
Draco paused on the threshold, studying him.  “May I come in?”  Getting no answer, he took a few cautious steps inside, closing the door behind him.  Harry stood, arms clenched across his chest, refusing to look at him.
“Anggitay?  Never heard of it.”  He turned dismissively back to his papers.
There was no sign of recognition on Lucius Malfoy’s face as he looked at Harry. “Good afternoon.  Do I know you?”
He wondered who might have rumpled Malfoy up that way.  He wondered how it would feel to rumple Malfoy up.  Just gently.  Smooth that frown out.   Bring some color to his cheeks.  His lips.  Make his eyes flutter shut and his mouth fall slack and his breath come panting, gasping
There was chaos at the castle – a huge battle being fought outside on the grounds.  Not only wizards but giants, centaurs, suits of armor, spiders – general pandemonium.  Rosemonde whinnied to the silent skeletal flying horses.  Draco looked for Harry but couldn’t see him.  He and Rosemonde circled over the battlefield. Jets of curse light shot everywhere.
Harry smiled affectionately at his friend and then was overtaken by a yawn. “Sorry!”
“Are you alright?”
He came in sight of a narrow bridge.  There was a sign, “Beware of Monkeys.”  Harry saw a group of tourists cross, snacks and sticks out as the monkeys approached.  He tightened the straps on his pack so the animals couldn’t tear it off, and headed to the bridge by himself.
“Any fruit?”
Being stuck in a lift was not, itself, dangerous.  But alone with Harry Potter?  Hostility ended long years ago, but other feelings Draco preferred to hide.
, remember?”
“Divination by frogs,” Draco explained.
Rutherford looked dubious, but bore the unsigned message without complaint and returned empty-taloned.
he insisted, leaning his head into a surprisingly tender kiss, hooking a leg around narrow hips, rocking against another body in the dark.  But it was the scent of – Draco – flavoring the rising smell of sex, the taste of Draco’s mouth and salt of his sweat on Harry’s tongue. Harry’s skin sang, his body electric with touch.
Gabriel turned and flew toward them, lower this time, and again the cat leapt up, nearly touching him.
Lily feels her son’s need of her, hears the infant’s whimper.  She draws near, sees the head of unruly black hair bent tenderly over the blanket-swaddled baby.  Her husband James, once wild Marauder, has turned awed father.
One evening Potter came in cheerful from a trip to Hogsmeade.  Draco hadn’t gone, as the chair was still difficult to manoeuvre, though getting easier.
Draco began to pillage other poems for inspiration.
a juvenile at that time, Potter. Not someone old enough to have access to Ministry stationery. Hmm. Was this letter your idea of revenge?”
In the stillness after they finished, Draco rang the bell again.
Startled, Harry turned, but he was, as so often these days, alone. Too often, Hermione said. Maybe she was right, if he was hearing voices in his head.
Harry pounded his back for him and brought a cup of coffee to wash it down with.  When Malfoy had composed himself, he turned to Harry.  “Say that again.”
A chill fell and the clouds seemed to boil up high and black in the sky.
Did Potter mean to invite him to the theatre to watch a play?  To which show, and why in the afternoon?  Or maybe he meant a date to play Quidditch.  At least, as much Quidditch as two Seekers could play together….  Draco had a vision of Potter flying, his cheeks ruddy from the wind, his eyes sparkling and his hair wild.
“Do you want something to sit on, Potter?”
“People make mistakes,” Harry said quietly.
And that’s how Harry found himself traveling back to Malfoy Manor on the Knight Bus with a veterinarian who spent the whole trip looking out the window, a sleeping Mooncalf, and Luna teaching him lullabies about moonlight.
Draco watched with pleasure as Harry took out the mouthpiece and fitted the various parts of his instrument together.  Harry’s love affair with the saxophone had begun when they had gone to France together after the war.  Draco had needed to take Rosemonde home, thank Mme Maxime and say goodbye to his colleagues in the Reseau.  Harry had wanted to see where Draco lived at Beauxbatons.
“Ignatius is never afraid.  He’s just – prudent.”
Madame Pomfrey appeared in the doorway.  “Good, you’re awake,” she said.  “I don’t think you should try getting up for the bathroom yet, so I’ve brought these.  It’s easy to Banish things afterwards.”  She had a flannel, a towel, soapy water in a basin, and a bedpan.  Draco’s face turned hot.
“So what’s your plan – snacks, or sticks?”
“What?”   Harry had the sensation of playing verbal Quidditch against someone with a faster broom.
“Too many clothes,” Draco gasped.
“This is a slow song, Potter.” Draco tilted his head.  “Are you even listening to the words?”
“Here is Herman!” Merfley announced, holding out the cauldron full of water. Inside floated a greyish squid about three inches long, regarding him wide-eyed.
“I don’t think that net’s safe,” Draco said, breath coming a little quickly.  “You’d better come under mine.”
“That’s the goddess Kamadhenu.”
“So you took her in?  That was good of you.”
With Malfoy, though, flying all out was as natural as breathing.  No one else on the pitch had ever mattered the way Malfoy had.  Now the old animosity was gone, but the fierce pleasure was still there, even when, on their third go, Malfoy caught the Snitch.
Harry supposed that the Malfoy library would have a lot about curses.  The Black family library at Grimmauld Place certainly did.  He’d inherited books that practically growled when he went near them – so he generally didn’t.  But he was distracted by the other thing Malfoy had said. “Do you mean if he weren’t married to a Veela, you’d …?”
alliance, Potter.  Nobody’s trying to set up another Dark Lord.”
I am admittedly impressed that this piece was selected by Potter. It seems he does have some good taste after all, and it clearly goes beyond art: I’m sure our readers will agree that he has excellent taste in men, too!
had a new story every week about Harry’s supposed conquests? He could only dream of having the energy to get through that many girls.
“I wasn’t… I mean, I just made the connection myself.  I know you’re not, I dunno, using your powers for evil these days.”  Harry winced inwardly.  He couldn’t trust himself to make conversation with anyone this early, let alone Malfoy.
“That’s rubbish and you know it.  You just don’t want to commit to me.  You’re scared of marriage and kids and being a grown-up, but you don’t see that it’s another adventure for us to go on together.”
In an unexpected twist at the Wizengamot today, victims who were detained and tortured at Malfoy Manor spoke out in favour of leniency at the trial of young defendant Draco Malfoy.
She wiped the tears from her face and lifted her head up - Harry was proud, if he had any right to be, that everything they’d been through hadn’t diminished her strength.  “I just… it all seems so perfect, in my mind.  Like our future’s mapped out for us. I know it feels like ages ago that the war ended and you had to suddenly be an adult really fast, but it wasn’t.  We’re only just starting to figure out who we are and who we can be together, and I think you’ve been too quick to write us off.”
“It’s not dramatic,” argued Draco, “I just want my efforts to be fully appreciated.”
“That’s not funny, Ron,” Hermione said.  Harry gave Ron a weak smile, because it actually would’ve been funny if he hadn’t felt so rubbish.  “Also, Harry, I did some research to make sure, and even if it’s an outright lie Pansy’s source is protected, and so is Pansy - she’s very clear that everything’s ‘alleged’;
Draco started laughing and Harry looked at him, confused.  “‘Getting your head round it’ was one of my many exciting bedroom plans,” he clarified with a smirk.
“I really don’t want to go into that now.  You said you were here to talk if I’m ready, and I’m not ready for anything except a good night’s sleep.”  Harry turned from the room and started towards the kitchen.
Harry paused his perusal of the room for a moment to look at Draco.  He was talking more than usual, clearly nervous.  Harry almost laughed - there was no way he wouldn’t love the place, but it was sort of funny to see Draco so anxious, and he thought he’d leave it another minute or so before he allayed Draco’s worries.  He was also far from annoyed about the Dreamless Sleep: his nightmares had been news since he was a teenager and he was hardly going to make a fuss about something that could actually help.
“Why did you sleep here?”
“It seems to me that Pansy must really want that promotion.  It’s nasty stuff, but I don’t know what you expect at this point.  She’s probably still mad that you won’t let her into the house.”
“I’m sorry.  I can stay, if you want?  She’s made reservations, but I can tell her I had plans already.”
“It’s brilliant,” he said eventually.  “Really, I don’t have the words… I knew you were good but this is… how did you know exactly what I wanted when I did such a rubbish job of explaining it to you?”
I’ll try and drop by if I get these mood boards done - I would love to gouge my eyes out to avoid all this hideous fabric but will try to hold off so I can critique some fashion faux-pas for Lisa.  The sacrifices I make for you people are immeasurable.
No offense taken: in fact, I doubt Weasley could ever convey the level of disdain I would feel if you invited me to stay in a house riddled with pests.
“There’s a magical gallery at the Tate Modern?” Harry asked, feeling hopelessly uncultured.  In his defense, he hadn’t been there since a particularly terrible primary school trip, when one of Dudley’s friends had knocked over a very expensive vase in the gift shop and blamed it on Harry.  Uncle Vernon had gone through the roof when he saw the bill.
“I think he likes it
“All right then, Harry.  I’m considering accepting your apology… but first, I’m dying to know what’s in that package.”
“So before we go to the right place, Harry tries to Vanish all the paint off his robes - but he’s in such a state that he accidentally Evanescos the entire lot!  Had to slink back into the office practically starkers and nab what was left in the spare clothing bin - not that there was much choice there, obviously!”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Honestly, Ron, it was all being blown up out of proportion. If you were locked up in a house where you’d witnessed people being tortured, wouldn’t you want to clear it out a bit? I think it’s a perfectly reasonable reaction to trauma.”
editor Xenophilius.
“Harry, tell her.”
to find out.
Harry laughed, relieved and surprised.  “Almost as bad as the Auror department making me come in for seven in the morning.”  He checked the time again, and stood up to gather his things as the Tempus charm reminded him that he had to be at work in eight minutes.  “Can I take these with me?” he asked, picking up the box of tables.
Malfoy shuddered.  “You know full well that I retracted that statement the moment I laid eyes on the place.  No one should be sleeping in the master until I’ve had an army of house-elves in to do a deep clean, and I’m still stuck on the first-floor bathroom right now.”
“You look like hell,” he said, unthinking.  “Did you sleep here?”
“Oh, forgive me, am I inconveniencing you?  Has this been more or less torturous than the time you thought I’d sold you out to the papers?”
A few hours and an ill-advised amount of champagne later, Harry found the courage to catch Malfoy alone.  “So, um, I was wondering if you could do me a favour,” he started, before he could chicken out.  As soon as the words were out of his mouth he regretted them, especially as Malfoy’s lip curled in a familiar disdainful gesture.
“That’s just it, Gin, we
“Potter, Weasley, Granger, welcome. It’s lovely to see all of you,” he proclaimed.
“Oh,” said Harry, “I hadn't even thought about that.”
“Articulate as ever,” Draco observed.
“Harry, do shut up, please.”  Draco must have got closer while Harry was talking - well, babbling - and he put his hands on Harry’s arms, holding him in place, while he looked him in the eye and asked slowly.  “Are you trying to tell me that under that brown paper is an original work by Georgianna Moonstone?”
Draco frowned for a moment.  “First of all, you and I both know that Pansy’s right about Ginevra’s motives, even if the love potion stuff is total rubbish.  Second, if you’re accusing me of something, you’d better have some grounds to back it up.”
“A bloody nightmare is how he is,” Ron added.  “I put some Quidditch magazines in there for safekeeping and he tore them up and put the pieces in a giant pile on the middle of the bed, just to mock me.”
He pushed his hair off his face and forced himself to look at her.  He knew that he owed her a proper explanation, something definitive and final, as much as he hated the idea of hurting her.  “We’ve already tried and it’s not right between us.  Our lives, our jobs, everything - they don’t work together.  And neither do we, any more.  I thought we agreed on that.”
“I don’t want that,” he said.
“Shut up,” Harry replied, turning to kiss him.  “You’re going to be even more insufferable now, aren’t you?”
“I assumed you’d want to keep using this one, so I tried to clear it out a bit,” Harry said, manoeuvering an impossibly large trunk full of shoes into the corner of Regulus’s room.  “I hope you don’t mind sleeping on the same floor as me - I know you said I should be using the master bedroom but it still smells like hippogriff, and I’m just more comfortable in Sirius’s.”
“You’re lucky this place is so crap,” Zabini pointed out.  “If there were any photographers around, you two would be toast.”
There had been silence for a while after that.  Harry knew, because some deep - and incredibly annoying - instinct made him scan the papers for any mention of Malfoy now that he was back on the radar.
Harry stared at her.  “Gin, I’ve spent most of my life living what was mapped out for me, and it didn’t make me happy, a lot of the time.  You and I were best together together when we were friends, and I reckon if we carry on like this, we won’t even be able to salvage that much.”
This week, however, as a close personal friend of Draco Malfoy, I was granted exclusive access to the house (along with our trusty photographer Derek!), and even an interview with Potter himself.  Potter has refused to respond to any of
,” with no real idea what he was asking for other than for this not to end.  He reached one hand down to push through Draco’s hair, pulling it out of its tie so it fell loose around his face.  Though his eyes kept trying to close with all the sensations racing through him, all Harry wanted to do was keep watching: the sight of Draco, messy and gorgeous, sucking Harry’s dick with single-minded focus, just turned him on even more.  He was practically hyperventilating, hips thrusting up into that warm, wonderful mouth almost of their own accord, and just when it was all getting to be overwhelming Draco sat back up, and Harry practically whined with disappointment.
“How did you get round the Permanent Sticking Charm?” asked Hermione, clearly impressed.
Last week they made a rare public appearance together, sharing a cosy dinner at Diagon Alley’s popular vegetarian bistro, Dittany + Snowdrops (see p.74 for an exclusive voucher offering 5 Galleons off your meal!).  Although they claim that they are now ‘just friends’, we know that our readers, and even some members of the
“I love you, too,” he whispered, tentatively.
Harry suddenly realised that he was still holding onto Draco’s arm, standing far too close, and Draco had just - sort of - said he thought Harry had a nice arse, and Harry couldn’t tell whether he was feeling warm from the alcohol or from something else entirely.  He opened his mouth, with absolutely no idea what he was going to say next, when a chime came from the Floo and he and Draco sprang apart.
While officially
To be honest, Harry did think it was beautiful.  The colours were rich and vibrant, but it had enough open areas to balance the intensity.  The artist’s signature moonstone-infused pigments seemed at first glance as if they’d been splattered on at random, but when you looked from different angles the areas where they glowed softly were clearly careful and deliberate, to create real depth.
“Ginny and I aren’t getting back together, Ron,” Harry said for the millionth time.
Draco’s residual laughter died down, and they all looked at the picture in silence for a moment.  “Hold on, I’m starting to see what you mean about it reminding you of Harry,” Draco said eventually.  “It’s a successful piece, but you can’t tell how much of that is deliberate and how much is a happy accident.  To the untrained eye, it’s also a complete mess.  That sums him up, really.”
“Believe me, I’m over it,” he murmured reassuringly,
He heard Draco exhale and pause for a second before walking towards the fireplace and muttering the charms to lift the wards and unlock the Floo.  “Ginevra, nice to see you!  Harry’s just popped to his room; he’ll be down in a second.”
requested two full size dining tables this week, and it took me till eleven last night to get your samples ready.  And it’s a good thing I did too, since you’re here so bloody early.”
“The Black house?”
Harry Potter’s evidence during the trial itself may also have come into play.  On the record, he gave damning testimony about Malfoy’s role in the prior invasion of Hogwarts, but also claimed, “When [Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley and I] were brought into Malfoy Manor, he refused to identify us to his father, to save us from being handed over to [You-Know-Who].  The whole time we were there, he was completely terrified.”  When questioned about Malfoy’s role in the Battle of Hogwarts, Potter stated, “Malfoy was clearly hiding from the whole thing...he even told his friends not to kill me.  He may have said it was because [You-Know-Who] didn’t want me dead, but it was clear to me that he was in over his head from the beginning and wanted no part of it.”
Only then did something in Harry snap, and he was leaning in and suddenly he was kissing Draco Malfoy – holy crap, he was kissing Draco Malfoy – long and hard and deep, and somehow his arms ended up round Draco’s waist, pulling them even closer.
Harry could picture it, and she was right, it did scare him.  He imagined standing by her side, seeing their children off on the Hogwarts Express, hating the fact that they were old enough to leave, because now he’d be alone at home with Ginny.  Ginny, the supposed love of his life, who didn’t want to hear about his job because she found Auror work unnecessarily dangerous after their experiences in the war. Ginny, who didn’t want to meet his colleagues for that same reason, but forced him to have dinner with all her teammates, which he hated, because they were always on strict athletic diets and only wanted to talk about tactics.
“Yes,” Harry replied, glumly.  “I spent a fortune in the Honeydukes Gourmet section.  He kept the gift but didn’t read the letter.  That was three days ago and I’ve still heard nothing.  Before that I even tried to ask Narcissa, but she sent me the most polite and beautifully handwritten ‘fuck off’ note I’ve ever read.”
“You mean the Malfoy Wing,” Draco put in, smugly.  “My family have been patrons of the arts for generations.”
“He’s the Malfoy whisperer,” replied Ron, giggling slightly over his Pepper-Up Pilsner.
Harry laughed, slightly indignantly, but Luna didn’t.  She just looked at Draco intently.  “What’s it like to the trained eye?” she asked.
“Well, I do, you know.”  Draco brushed back a lock of Harry’s hair, which promptly flopped back over his face.
Harry’s immediate instinct was to try and hide from the scrutiny, but there was nowhere to go, and it was reassuring and terrifying all at once to see Draco looking at him as if he were a three course meal, his eyes darting between Harry’s face and Harry’s dick, indecisive.
Speaking exclusively to
I’d also recommend keeping the fire lit as much as possible while you’re there, even if you’ve got your Floo closed to visitors, because the fireplace may start to take lack of use as an insult and be deliberately uncooperative.
know each other inside out any more.”
?” Ron put his pint down and gave Harry a stern look. “Since when were we replying to him?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said automatically, but Malfoy waved it away.
‘Rear of the Year’ in action in those shorts. Did they come from the Aurors’ clothing supply or a prep school’s spare games kit?”
“Hah, I told you so!” Ron crowed. “He’s got hundreds of ulterior motives for having us here.”
“I highly doubt it,” Draco muttered, and Harry thought - or perhaps just hoped - he could hear some affection in Draco’s voice, and decided to go for it.
He was getting close again now, and he wanted Draco right there with him, so he reached one hand down between them and curled it around Draco’s dick. The angle was awkward, and Harry was vaguely aware that he had no idea what was doing, but he didn’t let that bother him as he followed his instincts, touching Draco as he would himself, and he was rewarded with gasps and a litany of, “Please, please, please...”
Ron seemed horrified at the fact that Harry and Malfoy were having a relatively friendly exchange: he was looking from one to the other as if they were a couple of giant spiders playing tennis.
Harry was unintimidated, and passed the bag of pastries over by way of an apology.  “Yeah, okay, that too.  My shift starts in half an hour and you said you’d have the kitchen and dining room stuff ready today, so I thought I’d see if you were in.  I’m on patrol so I’ll be knackered by the time I’m done.  You did sleep here, didn’t you.”  It wasn’t a question: Harry could see pillows piled onto a sofa in the corner, and Malfoy’s shirt was crying out for one of Molly Weasley’s extra-strong ironing charms.
“The owner’s staring at us as if we’re a bunch of nutters, so I ask him about the emergency owl and he says he never sent one.  And then Ron and Terry come back round shouting that Harry’s walked up all cocky and everything - but got the wrong shop!
Draco sighed dramatically.  “Have I become so predictable in my old age?  Fine, Chinese it is.  Let me Apparate us; you’ve had more to drink than I have.  You know, because of the shame and embarrassment.”
“The hospital houses many patients suffering from the long-term effects of spell damage and other maladies, especially in the aftermath of the Second Wizarding War, and our Healers have long asserted that many of those would make better progress outside a strictly clinical setting.
Draco kept his head resting against the wall, but turned it towards me and opened his eyes. They were the same eyes his mother must have seen in the memory. "Since when?"
She nods. "Still, Potter. Letting go is a viable option."
The most plausible seemed to be that in my desperation I had clung to every spark of emotion I felt for Draco. It was undeniable that Draco was a desirable man and affection, in its most ripe state, was best expressed through physicality, like a kiss.
"Oh, shut
Dark hair, green eyes and round glasses. Even the lanky figure of a malnourished eleven-year-old boy fitted like a glove.
Draco's reputation preceded him. And Harry was not sure what to make of it.
With a theatrical sigh, Harry settled at the Gryffindor table opposite Ron and Hermione. He was tired.
"Draco," Harry murmured and struggled to break off the kiss. Draco's eyes were filled with hunger and impatience, a pleasant shiver rushed down Harry's spine. "Ready?" He just had to ask, it seemed wrong not to ask. And maybe he needed a little shove in the right direction, a sign from Draco that Harry was doing well so far.
"Harry Potter, also known as
ready!"
"I'm sorry," was the first thing that left Harry's lips.

Harry does not hesitate for a second. "In a way, it's still your wand. You can use it if you like."
Draco sighed, squeezed Harry's hand gently and walked a little faster, probably to catch up with the others, to avoid the subject. "No, I wouldn't. Not if it's something serious."

made a huge mistake. And then there was the bet."
“Lonely without your friends?”
Jimar snorts in amusement. "That much was to be expected."
"So we can fly?"
A good deed for Malfoy and Parkinson. And therefore a good deed for himself, too.
The next morning Harry woke up neither from unpleasant heat on his chest nor from annoying alarm beeps. Yawning and stretching, Harry looked around the small room. A few rays of sunlight fought their way through the gap in the curtain and illuminated the room, in Harry's bed lay a blurred white blob, Hedwig, he definitely had to stop her from sleeping in the bed. Harry fumbled for his glasses on Draco's bed stand, he lay in Draco's bed after all and then took a look at his phone display. It was a quarter to eight on July 31st. Harry put his phone aside again and concentrated completely on the body lying next to him in bed.
It takes a moment for Harry's brain to be persuaded to do its usual work and for realisation to prevail. Hermione's words make sense and coherently fit together with the memories he still has of the evening in Jimar's flat. Even the stone he discovered suddenly strikes him as logical. "Was he ... Is he free?"
“Because he looks like a fish and acts like a spoiled princess,” Ron said out of nowhere. While Harry had to bite his tongue hard not to shout at Ron that Draco was nothing of the sort and Ron simply had no sense of taste, Seamus nodded contentedly; the reason seemed to be enough for him, even if the explanation for Draco's new nickname was even worse than what Harry would have thought of if he would have gotten to it.
? No, that wasn't the right word, more
Instead, the mood was cheerful, the others talked about past horse-riding holidays and birthdays that had been celebrated at the farm. Ron told them about the first birthday he had celebrated with Harry, and how the little boy had been so happy about a self-made paper airplane Ron had made that he had cried all day after it sank in a stream. Harry rolled his eyes and reminded Ron of how he had regularly hidden behind Harry to escape his first girlfriend. "
Harry does not sleep a wink the following night. Too many unanswered questions haunt his mind, nesting there without an invitation. Not even the potions that usually help Harry sleep peacefully when the nightmares prevail manage to calm his aching head.
Draco's eyelids fell shut and the grip of his hands loosened slightly. Otherwise, he remained still. I scooted closer, completely following my intuition until I was sitting next to him leaning against the wooden door, my shoulder snug against his. Loneliness and sadness did not mix well, so I tried to take at least one of the two feelings away from him.
“I suppose that’s the expensive booze?” Draco asked disapprovingly with sarcasm dripping from his voice, as soon as Harry sat down opposite him in the half-dark corner on a shaky chair. Harry grinned cheekily, he didn’t know much about alcohol, but enough to know that this in front of them was
Inside him, determination battles down his guilt and he frantically makes a decision at that very moment.
Draco was silent for a moment, which made Harry stare at Draco’s breastbone. He didn’t want to ruin the mood, but he hadn’t lied completely. Draco
The room is clinical and bleak, which seems to be a common characteristic of the rooms in this part of the hospital. Only a steel table is placed in the middle of the room. On each of the oblong sides stands a chair that looks as uncomfortable as it is, which Harry realises promptly when he sits down on it. Otherwise, the only noteworthy detail is the harsh white lamp above the table, which casts strange shadows on the white walls. Harry would have bet his life savings that the walls function similarly to those of Malfoy's room. The nape of his neck tingles uncomfortably. He knows he is being watched and cannot help but wonder if Malfoy feels the same at any given minute.
Other memories had shown Malfoy actually apologising. What was interesting to me were the people he chose to seek this forgiveness from. Most of the names had been unfamiliar to me, but there were a few among them that I had recognised. He had written a letter to Luna and Dean – or rather sent them a letter. He had written on piles of stationery until he had brought himself to send one of them.
