“So very sorry. Truly, I am. Everything that happened to you because of me… I wish I was a better father to you, but I can only try and do better from now on. Draco, I hope you accept my apology. That would mean everything to me.”
“What do you mean?” Lucius asked coldly, and took a step closer to him. Draco tried to cough a few times, but it’s really no easy feat when you’re tied and upside down, so he spluttered rather than spoke.
What? This wasn’t what he expected at all. Where was the sneer? The cutting remarks? The know-better-than-you, the have-you-begging-for-mercy and the fat-chance-of-ever-receiving-it? Where was
that Potter shouldn’t be there, that this was wrong, but he was too weak and insubstantial to do anything about it. With a little sigh he took a chip and pushed it in his mouth.
Draco stared at the transformed mattress, lumpy and thick and covered in the most Gryffindor of reds that ever existed. The mattress which used to be a rug, on which Draco wanted to sleep. Potter made it into a bed. He made it into something worthy of a
for him – Harry wanted to buy him an island or something, probably, but Draco was adamant on this instead. He had to use all he had to make it happen, though. (“So I’ll have another episode, so what? It’s not like there’s even much you can do when it happens.” Oops. That’s another score on the ‘hurting Harry’ board. Draco hated himself for a whole speechless minute after that, and for the rest of time, forever).
but a hand on his shoulder in triage proved otherwise. Draco knew who it belonged to without seeing. He couldn’t open his eyes, anyway. Exhaustion, or maybe something else, more sinister. It didn’t really matter. Draco didn’t want to fight anymore — he was so tired. He just wanted to rest. He was never really much of a fighter, always running away scared, not fit for… This, he wasn’t fit for this.
“I know,” he assured her in his calmest voice. It was still a bit difficult to speak to such a large audience, even though they were all people he knew, people he cared for, even.
He took him right there and then, again, half on the sofa and half on the floor. Draco didn’t even fret; he let the long fingers stroke him, the body above his pin him down. The pain stopped being of any consequence, both in his body and his mind; he didn’t care anymore, didn’t care about anything. Right here he was wanted and he was loved and he was
. It was unbelievable, really. He begged Draco for them to come here. How could he be such an idiot? How could he be so incredibly stupid? And now because of him, Ron and Hermione in danger too – what are they going to do with them, what will they do to them – and suddenly all the hate and anger that filled him disappeared, all the pain forgotten, for all he could feel was utter panic. He had to do something to save them. But what? What could he possibly do, wandless, outnumbered? Now that even Draco wasn’t on their side?
. But there was something about the picture which somehow managed to catch his attention. It was a portrait of a young man, smiling at the camera, turning his head sideways with a knowing grin. He was mildly handsome, perhaps, if one likes this sort of pale complexion and blond hair. He looked nothing like the Macnair he had known, who lived in the Manor during the second war. He looked like no one Draco had known. Still, there was something… not entirely familiar, but… Draco squinted. It wasn’t his eyes, they didn’t seem recognizable, so light a blue they neared grey. Nor his mouth either, the cheeky little grin, the way his lips upturned more on the right side of his face. No particular feature looked in any way familiar, but there was something there still, something – Draco didn’t know. Something.
Potter took it as the rebuke it was, very rightfully so in Draco’s opinion, and got up too. He can’t be saying things like that to him. He can’t say he doesn’t want to date, and then list Draco as one of the reasons why. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t right and it wasn’t fair and he will not stand for it. His pout, Draco hoped, made it clear enough.
“Mad? Why should I be mad? I’m never mad at you, darling.” The word ‘darling’ could not have been more venomous if Voldemort himself had said it. A shiver ran down Harry's spine.
There was a brief silence. “You really do seem upset, Malfoy. what’s eating you up?” Harry asked, watching the Potions Master walking around the room. When his eyes returned to his partner, he was surprised to see the look in the grey eyes.
Oh well. Obedient to the end, Draco shrugged and picked himself up mentally. Appealing as the thought of barricading himself in Potter’s bedroom was, the library wasn’t such a bad idea. Draco only glimpsed at it until now, but if he looked a little closer he was sure to find something to enjoy. And if the term
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to – but you can’t leave here, which is a bit of a complication, and… I don’t have enough magic to – “ the end of his sentence was swallowed by another boom from outside. A flash of green made his eyes look sickly-colored. “Draco, I’m sorry.”
He was able to do it because it was for Harry; he needed to do it to make him happy, and Draco would do anything for him, that was pretty much a given. He could even say no, it would seem. Repeatedly. Quite naturally. And if he was able to do that just then… maybe it was something he could do, in general.
Draco zoomed right back to the present, because this fucking predicament could wait. What he needed now were words. Words were important. He needed to find them, and he needed to convey his message clearly, because Harry was seriously not getting it. “Do you really think I could be living with Him for four years and not know He’s Grove? I’d know straightaway. Harry, he… even when I thought he was dead I dreamed of him basically every night. Even when I was in full denial mode. I’d know him before he said a single word, even if he looked nothing like himself. It’s not – it can’t be him.”
In the end Draco went with a witch called Natasha, who had kind eyes and a very slanted smile and who drew the most beautiful, delicate sketches. He didn’t show anyone the design they had worked on – they sat together for two hours straight making it – and by the first of September he went over to her studio and had it done. He was shaking slightly when he returned, and Harry was on him in an instant.
And Draco felt the nausea rising in him, he was going to throw up again, he was going to be sick all over the place – “Harry, he – he – there’s – “ but he couldn’t form a sentence, he couldn’t make it into words, this indescribable dread buzzing within him.
“How are you feeling?” he asked as soon as he was able to let go. Draco looked at him with a hint of a smirk which made that previously swollen heart even larger.
The bastard took him by complete surprise. Draco’s carefully crafted answer (if by carefully crafted one could mean ‘half-arsed and incredibly inadequate’) was taken right out of his lips. He expected Potter to be angry. He thought he’d yell, curse, demand an explanation. An apology? He didn’t see that one coming in a million years.
listen to whatever rumbling confession the man wants to fake, and since there was no possible chance in hell he won’t use it to tear Harry to pieces – what could Draco do? How can he stop this, how can he protect him? What could he do to ensure Harry’s life isn’t shot as well as his, that he can leave this interview and still be able to close his eyes without having to see it? How can he keep him safe?
. What he let them to do to them both – what he let them get away with – it was far, far, far more than he could ever forgive. And yet… looking at him now, at this boy, at the man sitting on that damned chair, at the four guards in their thick cloaks – seeing the whole picture – Draco realized he’d been looking at it all wrong. He was blaming himself for something that was truly, completely, entirely out of his hands. How could this boy be at fault? Just look at him. He didn’t know anything. How can anyone hold him accountable for what these – these
Oh, damn her to hell. Draco told her that absently, completely not on purpose. How when he was alone and had his eyes closed he used to see Grove, or his father’s face, or Harry’s smile, how he never knew what was coming. He didn’t have the chance to figure out what he’d see recently, since he was
– Draco saw his own eyes nearly popping out of his narrow head, he saw his pulse beating wildly in his naked throat, and he wanted to scream his horror but he had no voice anymore. He wanted to crush them all into paste, he was so angry still – surprisingly so, for the boy was far too stunned to feel anger anymore. He did, now, adult Draco. He felt so angry, so disastrously angry, and it was almost enough to make him think that –
“You’re right. Then I’ll… do your laundry for a week. I hate doing laundry, was never any good at it. Sounds good?”
“Your – “ Harry tried, lost. He’d heard of shape-shifting dragons before, sure, but… the man didn’t really seem like one. He was too
Harry blinked and glanced behind his shoulder. The simulation was truly magnificent. It really felt like they were out on the street, and not in some deserted classroom in the castle. He could
– what could it possibly signify, that He marked him on purpose? That He created this thing between them? It changed nothing. Draco would have been His either way, and they would have ended up right here. With Grove alive and David dead. With the ringing sound back, so loud in his ears he was going mental. With nothing making any sort of sense ever, ever again.
“Uh-huh. So that means it’ll pop up directly with my mobile number. Here, press this one, right under where it says dial. It’ll be a second…” then suddenly a loud noise almost made him jump to his feet, some sort of terrible music, but Potter remained very calm. He opened the bedside cabinet’s drawer and pulled an angry, buzzing rectangle, similar to the one in Draco’s fingers. He pressed a button. “Hello?”
How could he stand against those beseeching green eyes? He was never strong enough. “All right, fine. You better get some more sleep, then. I’ll go ask Kreacher to make you something to eat. Last thing we need is for you to get food poisoning from my cooking…” the end of it he was muttering to himself as he already made his way downstairs. The elf was in the kitchen, busy making chicken soup (damned chicken, why was it always chicken) and some sort of dark-leafy, lentil dish that actually didn’t smell too bad.
“You used to be so much better at lying,” Potter hissed, and if that wasn’t true… “Draco, I – look, I know it’s not my place. I’m not going to tell you what to do. I can only say that if that’s what it did to
“Mad?” Draco was bemused. “Why would I be mad?” Surprised to see him, yes. Pretty sure he’s hallucinating due to lack of sleep, yes. Out of any hope he ever had for him, yes. But mad? He was never mad. He didn’t have the gall to be mad at Potter.
“Nope, I’m pretty sure, I checked twice. This is your future. believe it or not, it’s coming your way. You're going to be happy and healthy and content. Nothing you can do about it.”
, a deep voice inside him hummed, and all of Harry’s body ached for it. Malfoy. He wanted it so much he was scared.
going back there alive… he somehow swallowed the entire Pygmy Puff that settled in his throat and grunted something like, “Yeah?”
Harry's first and childish response was to do with how Malfoy's face seemed to disagree with his words, but he swallowed it down with much difficulty. “I – seriously, it’s just not right.”
“Gods, Potter,” Malfoy said a little shakily, running his hand through his hair. “One might think this wasn’t your first time.” Harry just smiled and buried his face in the groove of Malfoy’s neck.
alone anymore. Umm, Draco? Iron curtain? He rubbed his eyes as if he can make the images disappear. He needs to extend the reach of his curtain, to cover everything up until now. Maybe up until two days ago, when things started crashing out of orbit and the world stopped making sense because of Potter. Bloody Potter. Of course it had to be him.
, his Harry, and he suddenly knew what that meant. Draco closed his eyes, for if ever there was a time to concentrate, it was now.
The green eyes did not look persuaded. “But how can he know how you feel at all times? Is he some sort of psychic?”
Malfoy didn’t ask for further explanations about the wand incident, so Harry gathered he'd already heard about it. From his father, most likely. His father that was one of the hooded figures in the mocking crowd when he was forced to fight on a broken ankle. “But you –“
“Nope. I reckoned they knew enough about your position. But even if they did, they wouldn’t use it to get revenge on you. Once this is all over and done with, and you’re stronger again, we could try and arrange an arena for you and Ron to fight in. But he won’t do it unless it’s fair. You know it.”
“Yes,” Malfoy mumbled, getting up slowly. “It’s… better already. Thanks.” He lowered his head, as if it was unbelievably hard to say the words.
“You bloody well – wait, what’s all this?” Draco must have died for a second, for his heart literally stopped beating. He could see the picture crystal-clear in his mind’s eye; a duvet and a pillow laying on the rug, forgotten.
“I don’t know about that. I always thought a family was about loving each other and taking care of one another. Not endangering and neglecting your family members to their fate.”
“Draco…” he was saved from having to come up with a response, because the door opened and Ron and Hermione burst through, having finally received his note.
“Retribution, you say?” Harry pointed his wand right at the boy’s chest. He was so close to him, he could feel Malfoy’s breath on his face, but the blond didn’t pull away. “Are you going to make me pay, or will you send your auntie to do the deed? Or perhaps, big old Voldy?”
“I would like you to meet with him regularly to ensure he remains on track. And in the more general sense, watch over his behavior. If you see anything out of the ordinary, I urge you to inform me. I am saying this in your presence, Draco, because I do not want this to be a secret. If you’d like to help your mother’s case, as you claimed repeatedly, you shall report to Harry. You said you are willing to make sacrifices. I am not usually convinced by words alone.”
“Yes, it’s… I’m so sorry. What I said was so outrageous, so untrue, and I’m ashamed of having said it. I blamed you for things that are so entirely not your fault, and called you – I didn’t mean it, any of it. I know you’re not trying to control me, or any of the awful things I insinuated. You’re… you’ve… I’m so grateful for everything you’ve done for me, everything you – “
When Malfoy spoke he was a little startled; he began to forget he wasn’t alone. “So just out of curiosity, Potter. You’ve never drank before. How many other things have you never done?” He must have been far more sober than Harry, because he couldn’t even consider answering in so many words himself. He merely made a vague ‘hmph’ sound and threw his hand in the air. “That’s not an answer.”
“Well that’s a relief,” Harry said, a little distracted by the way his silvery hair reflected the fire. He coughed a few times. “Did you speak to him about, er, sending a letter to your mum?”
Her hair was its signature bob, and it flew in every direction as she shook her head fondly at him. “Stop whinging, I'm here now. You don't need anything else – I’m a genius at plan-making myself. Learned from the very best, and I’ve carried on your legacy with pride. We'll do it together. I can help.”
With a scream of anguish he tore out of the memory, throwing himself head first at the carpet, only narrowly missing the table. He heard Malfoy saying something in the distance, but he wasn’t able to comprehend. Harry had to take a moment to calm his tense body before he could straighten up and resume his seat. Malfoy looked at him with utter concern.
, only His, and it was too dangerous a line to cross. He did not forget the night on the groats. Thoughts turn into words that turn into actions, and he could not, and was not going to, betray Him for his life.
Fright buzzed in his abdomen. Draco could hardly even pay attention to what was going on around him. Gabriel and Potter talked about something silly or another, and all the while Draco tried very hard to think. Something bad, it was something… something important… then he gasped, audibly enough for everyone to turn to him immediately.
“Harry,” Draco was startled by the pleading in his tone. He didn’t know what Harry wanted him to say. He had no idea what he even meant by all this.
“Can I kiss you?” Potter asked sheepishly. Draco wanted to give him the entire world, but all he could offer were his lips, crashing hot and heavy on Potter’s unsuspecting face. He took it well, though, and within a second he returned the kiss, panting slightly. It must have been torture for him, but Potter didn’t move an inch, just stayed right where he was. Draco wanted him so bad he could die with it right here and now. He bit Potter’s lower lip gently – gods, to have
Draco only had about a second to look up when he heard the first whistle. By the third his eyes were filled with tears of hatred, but there was nothing he could do as his body was already gearing to get in position; his knees gave out from under him and his hands reached forward. In a matter of seconds he was on all fours on the floor, shaking with loathing.
There was something in his tone that made Draco desperate to go near him, and so he leaned purposefully against the doorjamb. “Yes. Soon.”
“We have done that before, certainly.” A thin smile slanted towards him, making Harry’s sigh a tad less anguished.
He didn’t reply; rather, he gently rapped the gargoyle and the spiral staircase appeared. Waving his hand towards the boys he let them get on then followed suit, the stairs taking them upwards. They paused at the door to his office and Malfoy took off the cloak, appearing flushed and terrified out of thin air. He looked at the old man, and Harry could swear he was shaking with fear.
He approached slowly, gingerly. Potter still looked paler than his usual self, but his breathing was deep and sound, and his face relaxed like he was really just asleep and nothing had happened. There was something very innocent about Potter’s sleeping face, very unguarded, and it hurt like a fucking Crucio to see. Draco found himself shaking again. Potter almost died tonight, and he had no idea what the hell happened. He could still be in danger. Someone could still be out to get him.
“Or else, what? You’ll attack me?” Harry snickered. He stopped abruptly when the Slytherin’s wand shot straight to his nose. “I see you have your wand today.”
Harry followed Filch without sparing a glance back to the blond walking behind him. He led them to a rather dark room filled with pans from the infirmary which they were to clean without using magic. Harry sighed and handed the caretaker his wand, watching the other boy doing so reluctantly. Apparently Filch was concerned they will start brawling again, but not enough as to actually stay in the room with them.
It was meant to be his job, wasn't it, to keep Potter away? The whole reason He had to leave, trusting the mission to Draco? And if he failed... he had no idea what will happen, but it had to be bad, couldn’t ever be anything but.
“Fergus, will you please?” He asked in a tone far more polite than Draco would have imagined Him capable of. What was even more remarkable was that Grove just did as told; immediately he stepped forward and grabbed Lucius by the sleeve.
Perhaps it was the command, perhaps it was how he couldn’t stand it anymore, perhaps it was something else, but he didn’t stutter this time. “Who made the potion?”
It took some time for him to fill them in on all the details. Draco remained silent as he spoke, and the other two made the occasional remark of shock or disdain. At last he was finished and looked at them all, draped as they were in silence. Hermione sat with her chin in her hands, looking thoughtfully into the fire. Ron’s eyes were fixed on Draco, who refused to look at any of them and kept his glance on the rug. Harry ran his hands nervously through his hair, waiting for someone to say something.
He wasn’t exactly surprised, but still he gasped when the hand found his cheek and the slap turned his face red. “You are out of order, boy. You will not speak to me in this manner.”
It was so good to see the blond shift uncomfortably, all flushed and embarrassed. “I wouldn’t go that far. But I – fuck it, Potter, fine, you big softie. I care about you too. All right? Are you satisfied now?”
“She said it was on them, on the Ministry and the Wizengamot and all of them. That they were the reason you’d… well, you know, we all thought you killed yourself.”
“It wholly depends on what you plan to do with this bed.” His grin got wider, but then he gasped as if remembering something. “Wait, Potter – shouldn’t we practice first?”
cruel voice never ceased for a minute in his head. He got no sleep, only brief moments of restless shut-eye. He got no respite. He got fucking nothing, only the constant, mind-numbing, infuriating bickering. Back and forth and back and forth he drove himself crazy, and it took all of his strength to somehow carry on. The line was so thin between sanity and – the other option – and Draco had terrible balance. He was standing on it with one foot only, flailing hysterically. He’d fall, he was going to fall, and nothing will break it, ever!
“You've done it before with Snape, so you know what it's like when someone is trying to invade your mind. It is a highly disturbing feeling, one that your every instinct will fight against. But you must control yourself, for instinct alone cannot help you.” He took a deep breath. “You must concentrate. The general aim is to quieten your mind, to ease your thoughts. Once you achieved that, you will be able to block anything. You would be able to do Legilimency, too.”
It took rereading this paragraph three times before Draco realized he skipped two pages that were stuck together. He tried to sigh again, but it turned into a massive yawn. Maybe if he just closed his eyes for a second – it’s not like he’s actually going to fall asleep, he’d never be able to –
“Gods, Potter, stop apologizing,” the Slytherin scratched his head with discomfort. “It’s becoming a nasty habit of yours.”
This was absolutely the most amazing feeling he ever experienced. The warm channel was so tight around his cock, and Harry was attacked by a staggering urge to push all the way in. He had to be all the way inside him. To get to that place that Draco liked so much... But as he moved to go in deeper, he heard a slight grunt underneath him.
“I – “ he seemed a little helpless all of a sudden, and Draco’s heart lurched. “I’m here to help you. I always will be. What I said that night was… I didn’t understand, not really. I had no idea how difficult it was for you. I had no idea what he was doing to you and I – I screwed up. But I’m not leaving. Not again.”
A cry; Draco could see in his mind’s eye Bellatrix running and disposing herself at the tall man’s feet. “Master, please – they tricked us, Potter and his friends – “
“I… it’s not… there’s no…” words weren’t so reliable recently, and they failed him yet again. Draco thought about trying sign language instead, but he couldn’t come up with anything even near what he wanted to express. The core of it was a pulsating, thrumming
going on. Ever since they went to that Scottish cliff – ever since that… well, long and highly unusual physical contact between them – Potter acted off. It should have scared him out of his mind, but the jumble of feelings in Draco’s gut wasn’t dominated by fear. Sure, it was there, it always was. But there was also a sort of… anticipation? Excitement? A deep-rooted desire? Which of course led right back to fear, so there you have it. Draco wanted to shake the thoughts out of his head, but Potter would start asking questions, and the first rule was always trying to avoid that. The night ended on a bit of a sticky note, lingering and heavy, and Draco was beginning to feel extremely anxious about his careless offer.
“I don’t know, mate. He could have lied to you. He could have told you a very different story if he wanted. If the most important thing to him was to protect the truth so he could keep his mum safe, he could’ve just blabbed about something else and distracted you.”
“It’s really very sad, Harry, I agree with you, but you know that the only thing we can do now is go to Dumbledore. What else are you suggesting?”
It was only slightly longer than the last, and all the while He kept staring right at him, gobbling him up in his entirety. Draco felt so small against these eyes. So small he could probably roll into the pocket of his shirt, now lying on the floor, and disappear forever. The longer he was watched, the smaller he got. By the time He was done, Draco was no larger than a thumbnail. Lowering his gaze to the floor he bent his head down, and was rewarded by a soft kiss to his temple.
Improbable, but all right. He can wait. He will wait all night if it takes that long. It’s not like he’s got anything better to do than lie here on the floor, shaking, sobbing like a maniac. He’s got the entire night to fuck up with his head, and then a forever of nothing, so what are you going to do about it? Are you really going to let him be? Are you really going to let him suffer in peace?
“Who fucking asked you to?” Confusion couldn’t compete with real, bubbling fury. “Draco. Look at me.
She shook her head disbelievingly. “Oh, I dunno. Maybe when you started pretending I don’t exist. When you made every possible excuse not to see me.”
Draco gasped when the rod entered him, it hurt exactly like he remembered, only now in twice the force. It tore his flesh apart, and he was dying with it, but –
When Harry pulled away to look at his face, the grey eyes were filled with tears. He tried a smile, but Malfoy wasn’t going to indulge him like that. He frowned instead. “Are you really sure about this? You really want this? Me?” Harry had to laugh.
“Just you wait,” Bellatrix spoke very softly, and he could barely hear her above the general uproar in the room. “Just you wait until He gets here. You will pay for all you’ve done to my master. He will make you pay.”
In the end, inevitably, the clock struck five, and Draco had never been less thrilled to leave the suffocating shop. It was a cold night even considering it was the end of January, and as Draco closed the door behind him he found that he simply cannot take another step. A deep sense of foreboding swirled inside him, and his fingers were shaking when they brushed stray hairs out of his eyes. There was only one thing for him to do, really, but to bring forth his limbs in order to do it seemed impossible. With a grunt he leaned on the shop door, pressing his forehead to the frozen, steadying glass.
It took far too little time until he found himself standing in the familiar hallway in front of the very familiar door, his head still spinning and the feeling of destruction inside him high enough to be critical. This was… wrong, it felt every kind of wrong there was. It was stupid, so fucking stupid, but it was his only chance. Standing here in the hallway made it even clearer, how awful it was and how much he needed it. Standing here, shaking, terrified. Standing here, sure only about being unsure, hating himself so much it burned and frantic to get it over with. In front of the door, why does it always have to be a door… but this wasn’t some black ministry-issued door, this wasn’t the way to the unknown
“Yes, according to the Old Ways. You can guess it doesn’t mean much – naturally witches and wizards continue to learn throughout their entire lives, and their potential grows accordingly. But this sort of thing still goes strong in places like the Ministry. Did you ever ask yourself why no one can be granted a seat in the Wizengamot before they turn thirty-four?”
Malfoy got up, still fidgeting with his bag, and slowly made his way to Harry. It took a long moment before he looked up with a deep breath. “Potter, I wanted to talk to you about last night.”
This is nothing to do with you, who you are or were, all right? It was all to do with him. All of it. He took advantage of the vulnerable place you were in, and – did you believe me? When I said I didn’t blame you?”
Harry turned his gaze to the fire. He was silent for a moment, trying to find the right words. “It was… easy,” he said, then immediately blushed. “I mean, it was natural. And brilliant. Oh, Christ.”
“No, no, I’m trying to, it’s just… level with me here, currently, are you wearing two different socks, or an actual pair for a change?” Draco’s tone was very flat.
“Dumbledore showed up in a Death Eater attack?” Harry turned to him, surprised. “Didn’t think he’d do that.”
Potter smiled warmly. “Good. Now let me just – Accio duvet and pillow!” within a few seconds the items he called zoomed into the room and crashed in an untidy mess on the mattress. “Sorry, I was never very good with the placing – Hermione says it’s to do with the wrist, but…” he shrugged. “All right? is this okay? You think you’ll be able to sleep on that?”
Something hot and painful started in his chest, and Draco really didn’t have the time to get into it, since he was preoccupied by being fucking terrified. It was coming, and he didn’t like it. He wasn’t ready. “It’s not like I can do magic with my wand broken in two.”
Harry laughed and ran his fingers through the silky blond hair. “I dunno. I kind of like bad jokes. I think it’s a big part of my charm.”
“I didn’t really know what to think of it at the time. I knew he couldn’t – take me, not in that sense, that he wasn’t human enough for that. But I could feel he wanted to… I didn’t know what to call it until Azkaban. I don’t know what it is about me, but I keep attracting the – “ he paused then, horrified at what his traitorous tongue was saying. How
Potter mulled the matter over for a few seconds. “Okay,” he said in the end in a dark tone. “I will drop it. I won’t do anything about those arseholes, and they will keep on raping people and destroying more lives. Is that what you want?”
“Yeah, I’m knackered. Long night. Say, you’re handy with potions and all, aren’t you? Why don’t you brew me a – what’s it called, a Deathless Elixir or something?”
“No.” Harry took a step closer, and his trainer got instantly and unfortunately soaked. “No, not silly. I’m so glad you came up. That storm, when I first saw you? I mean, if you hadn’t been there to – and it’s not just that you probably saved my life. If you hadn’t come up, then I’d never have…” He felt a flush rise up his neck and settle in his cheeks. “I never believed in magic before.”
this. But he didn’t, he didn’t, and he just stood there like an arse until he randomly selected one without looking. It didn't get any better afterwards; every single item in his cart was a struggle. Then, to his horror, he arrived at the checkouts, only to discover they had all been automated.
“I’m not on duty here. I do enjoy it. Probably too much, to tell you the truth.” Potter flashed his white teeth, and Draco’s insides did a funny little number in his belly. “Ron and Hermione keep asking me what’s going on. I think they think I…” he blushed, damn him,
Draco would have smiled, but his face was frozen. Feathers that combusted into flame on his open palm. Thorn apple, vervain, fluxweed. A river snaking till forever.
Draco. You know, my one good shirt? The one I needed for the meeting tonight with the Swedish Prime Minister for Magic?“
forgiveness? “No, I’m sorry. I said I was sorry first.” It may have been a childish reaction, but Draco never claimed to be much of an adult.
The kiss was warm and sloppy and comforting, and so was the rest of the evening. Potter was unusually quiet, which would have been concerning if he didn’t have that silly grin of his splashed all over his face. He stayed very close, always at Draco’s fingertips, and though they didn’t touch at all afterwards it was still something. They said nothing as they ate the untouched Indian lunch and drank pumpkin juice and stared into each other’s eyes, and Draco wanted to die, but only just a little. No, wait, that wasn’t true. He didn’t want to die at all. It was only that this was the most alive he’d been in forever, and it was baffling. He was
he? The last seven years of his life were a lie. Everything he thought he knew was a lie. And the ground already slipped from under him once, he’d already lost everything he had before, and to think it was happening again – it was just too much.
Potter laughed, a strangled little sound this time, and rubbed his eyes. “Oh, I’m afraid that’s old news. We split up a little after that. Sorry, I thought everyone knew. I didn’t realize you were... I thought you knew.”
There wasn’t much consolation in trying to believe that, but Potter sounded so sad, and Draco had already agreed to hurt himself. “All right, then. If you think it’s best.”
“I hate you, maybe, yeah. But that’s not… all of it. I still care about you, even though you’ve hurt me. And I don’t want anything bad to happen to you. I don’t want you to get hurt.”
, Draco admonished, flicking now-cool water in both hands. No, no, fucking no. He was not going to go there, not now, not after last night. He needed to strengthen the iron curtain's hold, for it was slipping. Draco dove under the water and forced his breathing to calm back to a normal pace. He didn’t need to think about that night and what he lost, because He made it all right.
. It was confusing and a little too much and to be honest, he wasn’t at all sure if he liked it. But in his dreams, He always returned. Sometimes He’d be covered in blood, brown eyes morose, and Draco would feel so impenetrably
“You’re – you’re bringing him here? The Head Auror?” Draco felt faint. He was barely even awake yet, and it was far too early for his world to fall apart. “Here?”
“It really doesn’t make any difference. I don’t care about him anymore. I don’t care about – “ he stopped, but Harry could hear the word
“What is it, Malfoy?” he asked in his deep voice, getting to his feet. “How did you shake him so fast?”
“You’re an absolute arsehole,” Draco said truthfully, the first thing that came to mind, then rested his head on Potter shoulders. “And… yes. Thank you.” They both fell silent.
“It’s not even just that. It’s not like it’s all so far in the past – I’ve… you have no idea, Harry. You don’t even know what I’ve done to
“Absolutely not,” Mother sneered. “I believe privacy is a value people still hold dear, is it not? Can I not have this one place to complain about you in peace?”
It was too much of a stretch, and he was so weak. “Do not tease me, Father. I am in no state to bear it.”
“No, of course not. Harry Potter and his bloody saintly comrades would never hurt a fly, would they? Defenders of the poor, protectors of the broken, forever true and brave - but I must be more lowly than a fly, so pray tell, what do you want from me? I’ve already handed myself to you on a silver platter. How much further will you torture me with this? How many more indignities will I have to endure?”
“What are you talking about?” Harry needed to yell to get his attention. “I never asked you to do any of these things! I never asked you to grovel!”
It was too terrible. Looking at his father’s face, the first man he ever loved, Draco could tell himself wholeheartedly that it was too terrible. And he had all this anger in him now, all this hate, almost unrecognizable but still very much a part of him. He didn’t know where to shove it. He didn’t know what to do with it. Draco wished he could make it stop somehow, somehow, but it will never stop. Lucius would always have that look in his eyes, he would always be demolished, and Draco would always be the one who wrecked him. He was never going to get past it.
Harry had to take in a lot of air before forcing his voice into something not dreadful. “So, fireflies, you say?”
. As if that’s the way it works. He couldn’t much comment on that, though, for he lacked the right words, so he focused on the other part. “Come off it, Potter. You knew exactly what to do. You managed to kill him in the end, didn’t you? and you did that all by yourself. Just you and Weasley and Granger.”
Draco snorted with very little zeal. “Incredibly sharp on your part, but unfortunately that isn’t enough. Many inmates get beat up in prison. It doesn’t mean I told you the truth.”
Draco didn’t know what to do. Talking about – that – still felt perfectly impossible, but avoiding it would not get him anywhere with this bastard. He took a deep and unhelpful breath. “Maybe I didn’t want to live in the wizarding world anymore. Maybe I opted out.”
“Do you ever wonder – “ he started, but then broke off, unsure if he wants to continue with this line of conversation. Malfoy seemed to have caught on.
If Draco doesn’t get Him soon, he’ll be in deep trouble. And all this time he had this Potter substitute, and the taste of it was only getting sweeter, the place it filled in his heart warmer… this was dangerous, dangerous territory.
All in all, it was shaping to be another disastrous evening. He sat on the carpet in the dark again, watching the cloudy city sky become heavier and heavier. He wished for rain. Rain, or snow, or something, just not this bleary weather, flat and cold and uncaring. Sighing miserably he curled into a ball and prepared himself for another night of total destruction.
Him by his actions – nope, he wasn’t brave enough to try and imagine what would happen. Best not to, really. It took a moment until he realized everybody was looking at him.
Harry sighed. He didn’t want to say anything, didn’t want to admit it even to himself, but he was too tired and too perturbed to deny it. “Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really. I don’t really know.”
But then Macnair took a step back and looked away, and the scream between Draco’s ears stopped. He wasn’t dying. This was – whatever this was, it wasn’t killing him. The realization hit him so hard he missed at first when He spoke, and made Him – for the second time at least that night – have to repeat his words. “Will you be good, Draco? I’m going to release you now.”
“Just ideas, Potter, don’t fuss about it. You can be certain nothing of the sort happened. Greyback was just being a little… overzealous, I suppose.” He gave Harry a very cold look.
“How does it make you feel?” Harry asked, curious. He could see the pale face in front of him getting a little more colorful, and the effect was quite pleasing.
Draco stared at him, gobsmacked, very much out of his damn mind, and for a moment he couldn’t tell. There was so much – so much darkness between him and them, between now and then, and he was so lost in all of it that he couldn’t be sure about anything. Is it possible that all this time… all this time, the man he followed, the man he trusted… the man who lied to him… could it be that the man he
him. Potter thought he was worth his time, if nothing else. Potter had a purpose for him. And that had to bloody do it, had to be enough, so Draco forced himself to look at him. “What did you bring? Please tell me it’s not pasta.”
was going on here, but he thought he got a pretty good sense of it. This was all a set-up, all a part of the plan. Draco fooled him, again. And Harry let him. What he planned to do all year – the evil plot of killing him – he never abandoned it. No; what Draco did was just somehow manage to convince him he had. Just so he could stab him in the back again. Just so he could sell him out to Voldemort.
The carelessly thrown words (“I should have just let the Aurors get you. After everything I’ve done for you, all the trouble I go through – honestly, I don’t know why I bother”) which were later taken back (“I love you, Draco, I love you so much, I’ll always protect you, I love you…”). Hiding in the cupboard (hiding. As if he could hide from Him.
Draco hit him. Hard. “Gods, Potter. Your puns are even worse than they had been. I think I’d have to send you to a crash course in proper joke making.”
“You got that right, ferret. That slimy father of yours can’t help you from Azkaban, can he? And even your loyal companions abandoned you. You’re all alone but for us now, so you better play nice.”
Draco exhaled the deepest sigh of his life. Fucking Potter. He rubbed his cold cheeks in his hands for a moment. “Fine. You can come to the flat and see for yourself.”
The worried expression did not lessen, but Potter’s lips moved in a beginning of a smirk. “Among other reasons. So… You want to tell me what’s up?”
said it wasn’t right, that it would only make Draco even more unstable, not knowing, and perhaps He was right. Still, if Draco could, he would carve these memories out of his heart with a bloody knife. Even if it was the most painful thing in the world. Even if it would kill him.
“Draco, I’d like you to meet the man who raised me. This is Fergus Macnair.” But of course, that was not the name Draco had known him by. Shaking his head hysterically, Draco closed his eyes, then hurriedly opened them again. He didn’t know which was worse.
“I know,” Draco raised an eyebrow. “I’m a goddamned present, Potter. You should know you're incredibly lucky.”
“Maybe he is trying to help,” Harry said, although he didn’t much believe it himself. “I mean he was a friend of your father’s for years. Maybe he’s being a total arse to you, but still holds some affection towards her, or something?"
“I really wish you’d stop saying that,” Harry shook his head, pacing restlessly. “I don’t suppose there’s a back exist, is there?” Draco affirmed there was not. “Damn. I – damn.” After three rapid tours of the space he sat back down next to him, for the first time looking right at Draco. “I didn’t plan for this. I didn’t – I’m sorry, Draco. I don’t know what to do.”
Malfoy let out a cold laugh. “He didn’t believe me when I said I’d offer the information freely, I’m afraid. He only tortured me enough to break down my guard so he could read my mind without disturbance. And then just a little further, perhaps for the fun of it.”
Draco sighed. He knew what guilt and self-laceration felt like, whatever it was Potter thought he was doing. Then again, on second thought, this was nothing like his situation, because Potter didn't deserve this. He was the last person on earth who deserved to be punished. “It won’t help him, you know. You being miserable. It's not what he would have wanted.”
Wordlessly Harry lowered to the floor and sat, cross-legged, in the doorway. “I wish I knew what to tell you, too.”
Well, right now, there were two: he had to remain unseen by the tall lady, no matter what. He knew all too well what would happen if she saw him. If she approached. Gods, if she spoke to him… Draco dashed to the back room, cursing himself for his stupidity. He should know better. Damn it, he’s been warned.
Getting dressed was hard with the way his hands were shaking (it wasn’t really a shocker that after yesterday, his tolerance for surprises stood at a staggering
“A what?” Draco asked, blushing slightly. He recognized it as a Muggle reference, but that was about it.
“And was it really? An accident? Just a fall?” Draco’s eyes opened and zoomed right to Potter’s face, lip curled in disgust.
Draco looked, really looked this time, and he saw it in Harry’s eyes – not shock or surprise, no anger or resentment, only love. Harry trusted him. For the first time in his life, Draco felt like he deserved to be trusted. He wished so hard he could be a shield, to protect Harry from this somehow, any way he could. His arm was pure agony, and he had to act now. Draco concentrated all his love, all of him – for he knew now, he knew who he was, finally – into this one spell. It would probably be the last he’d ever cast. When he gave Harry another look, it was a goodbye. With a sudden jerk he threw himself forwards towards him.
, and so it was doomed to begin with. Oddly, it made Draco feel that much better. Because he knew without a doubt there could never ever be something between him and Potter, he felt much freer to act… the way he did with him. To talk to him. To smile at him, heaven forbid. To tease and ridicule him. Fuck, he probably felt freer with Potter than he ever did with anyone in his life. It was bewildering.
his. Draco squinted his eyes and tilted his head. Could it be that Potter knows who he was? Could Potter maybe tell him?
and that felt very near impossible too. And now he was faced with it, full on, all of it, and just – how was he meant to be able to undo all those years? How was he meant to understand, really understand? How was he meant to…
life Draco had been practically a toddler, and so he didn’t have much experience. Most of what he did see were hard, cruel things and delight was as rare in them as was compassion. And Potter – Potter was filled with them both, and even more. He was everything good Draco never had, and at this point it didn’t even matter that his heart was torn or that he was His or that he was not even a complete person. Draco realized that it was far too late for any sort of precautions. He was long gone.
“Shh, it’s all right,” Harry crooned, and the wet cloth disappeared. “It’s all right, Draco. You’re all right.”
“No more than usual,” Malfoy shrugged. “Crabbe and Goyle are pretty quiet again now. It doesn’t seem as fun for them anymore now that I’m not injured. Those bastards really liked to watch me squirm.”
Hogwarts. He was at Hogwarts. This was the infirmary, and that woman over there was Madam Pomfrey, and Harry was there because he won, he fucking did it, and they made it out alive.
“Of course I can, I can and I do. And – you know what? I think you love me too. Maybe you won’t say it, but I think you do.”
“I’m not. I'm dead serious. I was just about as close as I was ever going to get, and then… I… well. Decided to try something else first.” He shrugged and took a swig of his drink. This was not a safe subject, but he was getting quite lightheaded now. The blurriness of the beer was starting to rub off on the world around him. Draco found it oddly calming.
Draco opened his eyes in alarm, hyperventilating, wanting to be dead, wanting to be dead. Please, please, anything would be better than this, please. He knew then, he knew He’s coming for him, that He’s coming back to claim him – He’s coming – and please, please, please…
Only then did he realize what he actually said, and Draco would have ripped his stupid head off his shoulders for that. In a quick motion he got up and deposited himself on his knees in front of Harry, grabbing both his hands for emphasis. “No,” he said, simple as that. “Harry, you’re nothing like him.”
Harry nodded, head sinking to the back of the armchair. “Thanks. Really, guys. Thanks for looking out for me tonight. I’ve… I don’t know if I told you how much I appreciate you two.”
“Oh, Potter, you have no idea, do you?” the hand left his body and Draco breathed his relief. He was a little too stunned to think coherently, and when the spell released him he nearly fell flat on his face. Instead he managed to fall to his knees, somewhat gracefully. That felt familiar. Not the kneeling necessarily, but the gracefulness of his actions. “He isn’t even the boy you used to know. He has been broken, Potter. Completely broken.”
“Oh yeah, I never told you, but until I was eleven my bedroom was the cupboard underneath the stairs. Fun place, really. Lots of spiders. I think it’s a part of the reason I'm quite good with tight spaces.”
“Draco, you’re going to have to work a lot harder than that to push me away. I’m sorry, I know it’s not… maybe not the reaction you wanted out of me, but to be fair I don’t think I can do anything else at the moment. I just care about you so much. Can that be enough for now?”
It came to him like another slap to the face. Draco jumped to his feet and tore the freezer open, dragging a bag of groats back to his corner and proceeding to spill its contents on the floor. Then he took all his clothes off, one garment after the other in what must have taken an hour at least, until he was naked and shivering with cold. Then, with a vicious pleasure that came from the sheer humiliation and the petrifying fear, he lowered himself onto kneeling on the still-frozen grains, feeling them scrape and tear his skin. It was extremely painful, and the longer he stayed there the worse it would be. Draco shivered even wilder, cold and bare and so very anxious, hoping that these drastic measures will relieve the terrible ache he felt inside. He closed his eyes, in his mind repeating the words he said a million times over, in his waking hours and in his dreams.
“You should get to be over it, you know. The winning side. I thought… I don’t know why, really, looking at it now, but I thought it’d be easier for you.” Damn, that was the wrong thing to say. Potter’s face became so serious, so fast.
Everything in him stopped still when the doorbell rang. For a moment Draco was scared out of his wits, but then he reconsidered – Potter, it was Potter, he came for him! It was very fortunate he’d been kneeling, and therefore it took him some time to be able to stand; if he hadn’t he would have run to the door and flung it open in a heartbeat. As it were he had to drag himself to the door bit by bit, and that was enough time for the person behind it to speak. Draco’s jaw dropped open and his heart froze over in fear. It wasn’t Potter.
thing was just mind-boggling, and Draco forgot. He simply forgot. So when Potter moved to drain the spaghetti he didn’t remove himself straightaway, instead stupidly turned into him, seeking the lost contact. Which would have been fine, had the palm of Potter’s hand not landed on the small of Draco’s back and pressed, accidentally, exactly on the spot in the center.
“Well? Satisfied with your inspection?” Draco asked as he parked himself in front of him, looking anywhere but in Draco’s eyes. “Is it to your liking enough, or will I have to find another flat in order to please you?”
“What!” to be fair, he was probably only trying to test Harry. Never in his life would he imagine he’d say that, though.
“No,” Potter shook his head, and he raised himself a little on the bed. “No, you shouldn’t – not on the floor.”
“I forgive you.” He said it simply, honestly. Harry thought his heart never felt so full. They stayed silent for a few more seconds and watched the grounds getting whiter and whiter, the light flurries twisting in the air.
, before it hurts too much. There was no other choice. He should be happy about it, actually, because Harry was going to live. So, yay. This was him being happy. He was happy.
“Ugh, enough with that smugness already,” the Slytherin said, disgusted, even though Harry was quite sure he wasn’t showing any signs of his feelings. “Yes, you’ve fucking won, are you happy? I am going to your precious Professor. I am going to deny the Dark Lord his wishes. But I’m not doing it for you, and it doesn’t mean you saved me, so wipe that grin off your stupid face.”
He knew he had to be careful. All the while they were talking his father bore into his mind, and Draco had to be sure he is only giving out things that were safe enough to display. He sighed. “I've not seen you since you’ve been out, Father. I needed to discuss the plan with you. There are some – details that require your attention.”
This was another set of bad news. “Well – maybe you should stay here then. I guess there’s no point taking you further into danger. Just stay here and stay hidden, okay? We’ll get everyone back here and ready to go in time.”
“Enough with that bullshit, Draco. You’re the only one in charge of your life. So all along you were just trying to get me off your boyfriend’s scent? Consider your job done. I won’t go after him, all right? I thought I made it clear before, I wasn’t going to chase anything to do with that man you killed, but here. I won’t go looking for your boyfriend. You’re free to go.”
“He wouldn’t care about that,” Potter shook his head fondly. “He would like to have one just because he’d probably find the wretched thing
“No!” she tried to seize the letter from him, and Harry didn’t even notice how it was glowing now, almost blinding. “Harry, stop, it’s a trap – “
“Lean on me,” he said, and Potter’s eyes rounded even more. “Come on, you prat. You look a little peaky. Probably shouldn’t be out of bed yet.”
Grove wasn’t his worst nightmare (He was). Grove wasn’t his biggest fear (He was). Grove was the one who did all those things to Draco, physically, but he was nothing but a pawn. The person behind it, the person who dreamed it all up, the person who ordered it – that was all Him. Everything, all of it, it was Him, and Grove was just the man he played to get it. Just a man who was scared to go back to the prison where he was too well known, where he was probably being beaten and abused. Just a man who was scared. Who actually came here today
“But you killed him months ago, why did it only happen now?” Ron asked, his voice muffled, and thankfully Draco was spared an answer because Mother was on it.
, it made him nauseous. “You don’t need to… I appreciate the effort, Granger, but I know I’m not worth much. For this, erm, research,” he clarified when he saw the horror on Harry’s face.
“Nah, saw nothing. I was going to – your flat – “ he stopped for a cough or two, and Draco presented him with a glass of water from the bedside cabinet. After drinking his fill he continued; “was lucky I managed to get up the stairs. You – Draco, you saved my life.”
“Listen,” Harry said, his voice trembling. “I will help you, all right? I’ll do what you want me to do. But you have to let Draco go. I’ll do what you want if you let him go.”
“Did you hear about the attack yesterday?” Dean’s voice asked somewhere to his left. “At the Muggle residence in Kent. They say that if Dumbledore hadn’t shown up, many more would have died.”
He looked back up at his face. “Potter, can I – “ then stopped, bit his lip and shook his head. Come on. This shouldn’t be so damn difficult. Not everything always had to be so difficult.
He tried to laugh, but it only came out as a dry cough. It was the exact reverse of a very familiar situation. Only usually, he was the one begging… “Do you truly mean it, Father? You love me? You would die for me?”
“Are you fucking serious, Malfoy? Comparing these men to Voldemort? The darkest wizard who ever lived, the one who killed hundreds of people? Fucking
; it was perfectly impossible for him to do so. Talking about Azkaban was hard enough when it was just Harry, and he only gave him the barest of details. And talking about Him – well, the mere thought was a riot. He could never do that. He could
“If you run into my father – “ he whispered to him as Harry went through the unpleasant experience of having his skin melted off and reforming in a different shape tightly on his bones, “you have to be very careful. Tell him Snape gave you permission to come, and immediately find an excuse to leave. If you remain too long with him he’s bound to figure out you're not me. Harry – “ he paused when the transformation ended, and he was now staring at his own face. The real one twisted with discomfort. “You have to remember your Occlumency. He will certainly try to invade your mind. And just – be extra cautious, all right? I don’t know what he'll do when he sees you. Me. If you cannot evade him, take Granger, apparate to Dobby and leave.” Harry nodded distractedly and tried to give him a reassuring smile. It was weird to have to use a different face than his own.
“Why did they do that to you?” by the way he sounded Potter was dangerously close to crying, the danger lying mostly in that if he started, Draco would surely break. His fighting tactics were superb. “
, but Draco let it slide. “Gorgeous. You might have to wear that every day from now on, I’m afraid.”
“Yes, it wasn’t hair He used,” Draco said bitterly to the rug. “It was very clever, actually. A very particular way to train me. Every time I – pleased him – “ oh gods, oh gods, oh
“At least now I know how pancakes taste,” he said and pushed the plate away from him. “And when I’m able to eat again – let’s say in about a week’s time – I would love to have them again sometime. You are quite the cook.”
to the one who really did, and he wasn’t exactly doing that either. Basically, he was screwed on all fronts.
“Yes, but he didn’t even try to lie! He told you everything straightaway. Almost like he wanted to tell you.” Hermione looked at Harry like that should mean something to him.
“Oh, I might, but Voldemort sure won’t,” Harry said, and he could swear he saw something moving in the shadows on the pale face.
Trying to answer proved impossible, because his mouth was clammed shut. Draco felt like he was falling, though his feet definitely stayed planted right there on the floor. Already he felt sick to his stomach, like he was going to throw up, although Merlin knows when was the last time he ate.
“‘s fine, I’ll just put on the invisibility cloak and slip out, no one will notice.” He was anxious to get out, now; the closer people will be to finishing their meals, the closer they’ll get to Dumbledore’s speech. And it was of utmost importance that he wouldn’t be here for that; his shaky feelings, the residues of the burning detestation, were utterly frightening. He couldn’t take the risk – something told him that if he stayed any longer, he might try and do something stupid.
Silence thundered between them for a second. “You don’t seriously mean you want to stay with him, do you? After what he did?”
The shaking of the head was becoming chronic. “It was never just you. Bond or no bond, Draco, the things they did to you were… honestly I have no idea how you came out on the other end after everything, how you were able to take it so well.” Very generously, he ignored Draco’s scoff. “He didn’t need this last bit of magic to affect you. He had years of physical and emotional abuse, and that was far more than enough. You have nothing to blame yourself for. Do you hear me? You didn’t do this. It was my theory, after all. You kept telling me no, and I kept pushing, and…”
One look at Harry snoring was enough to make him discredit the theory. Harry wasn’t Him. Harry wasn’t trying to take control of him, he wasn’t trying – in fact, he wasn’t trying anything. Harry left all of it completely, entirely to him, all of the decisions, everything. Harry wanted nothing more than for Draco to be happy, Draco knew that. And
“All right, three now,” Neville said, and Harry wondered when he became the leader of their little team. He didn’t mind it in the least. It was great to have someone else in charge. “I think I can make out one – Malfoy, do you see it, behind the trees over there? Ernie, Harry, do you think you can cover – I will get the other one by that bench.”
The evening sort of fizzled out after that, but it wasn’t all that bad. Potter washed the dishes by hand (and refused to let Draco lift a finger, the annoying git), then made them tea which they drank while chatting about nothing in particular. Both of them were pretty exhausted, perhaps more mentally than physically so, and it didn’t take long before Potter suggested they retreated back upstairs. Twenty minutes later, clad in Potter’s pajamas and teeth brushed, Draco sat down on his mattress and looked at the other man doing the same on his.
Now he did chuckle a bit. “All right, Malfoy, I think we should call it a night. I don’t think I can take another total emotional breakdown like that. I’ll see you next week?”
“I won’t hurt you,” Harry hummed in agreement. His voice was smooth and sunny too. Draco exhaled heavily.
“Just that… you’re not actually dead yet. And you don’t have to be. I know it must have been an unbelievable nightmare, and I’m not saying I know how to fix what’s happened to you. But it doesn’t have to be a choice between my life and hers anymore. You can have both. Draco…” Harry drew a deep, shaky breath. “You're not dead, so you can’t have died in vain. You’ve been through some terrible, terrible things, some of them because of me, some of them for my benefit. I never meant to hurt you. Look, you don’t have to make this decision again. I'm making it for you this time. I'm going, whether you’re coming or not. You can join me if you will and we’ll try and get her together. Or you can stay here if you’d rather. I’m not just doing it for you, Draco. I’m doing it for me too. I have to try this, even though it may not work. I have to try.”
“That’s brilliant! Congratulations!” he tried to be excited for them, he really did. But the doubt at the back of his head was nagging all the more forcefully, and he couldn’t very well take it much longer.
“I can honestly say I never did. I didn’t even know that was a thing.” Potter gave a low whistle. “Wizards have some messed-up rules, let me tell you.”
“It’s – well. I didn’t mean to overstep, all right? But I needed to – and I mean, everybody would know soon enough, so many people saw you. And I thought you would prefer it if…”
“It would appear you have. I wonder what on earth could possibly upset the great Potter so.” He gave him a look that made him shiver to his core. “And where is your potions partner?” he asked, making Harry’s eyes widen and a beginning of a gasp to escape his lips. How did he know?
“Come on, work doesn’t count and you know it.” Potter stretched luxuriously on the bench, still keeping a good distance between them, the considerate prat. “You need to spend time outside-outside, too. I know it’s scary, trust me, I get it. But no one can do anything to you, all right? You’re safe. I’m here.”
“I need to know what it’s doing. I need to know what of this is the bond, and what’s just… me. I need to know if when I want to – I need it to know what I want. I spent years not even fully realizing it was there, and now He’s gone, and I don’t know what’s what anymore. Please, I don’t want to beg, not for this. I just… have to know.” He bowed his head down and willed himself not to cry. “I need it to know who I am now.”
. Draco let him get this far, he let him fall far enough down the rabbit hole, until he thought he fucking loved him, and that was just unbearable. How could Draco do this to him? How could he betray him like this, day after day, spinning his web of lies and tricking him into it? How could he be so fucking selfish? He was leading him on, and he knew it. Draco has been lying for months, and Harry had no clue, and it wasn’t fair. It just wasn’t fair. He knew what he needed to do, what he should have done ages ago, just not how to do it.
“Potter, you must know – I understand you have no reason to believe me, none at all, but I am telling you the truth. I admit that at first, I only became close to you in order to trick you. But then when you – opened up to me…” he shook his head, and Harry wasn’t sure if he’s strong enough to hear the rest, but he remained quiet nonetheless. “You’ve changed everything, Harry. Everything. I was honestly, truly defenseless against you. I fell for you, which was the most idiotic thing I've ever done, but it couldn’t be helped. I am so, so sorry that I hurt you. You have every right to hate me, to despise me. But know that the way I felt about you was true and strong and real. It was the best thing that ever happened to me.”
“No, but it’s going to be on your body,” she said with a gentle smile. “I just thought – if you’re going to get a new mark, then it’s time you actually chose it for once.”
Draco shrugged. “For fun, I guess. It was all very amusing to him. He’d sometimes quiz me till I passed out cold, or until I was in tears begging him to fuck me. Then he’d let me give him his bloody blowjob, and we could finally get on with our day. At least he wasn’t one of the guards who wanted me to apologize.”
Draco gave a tiny groan and the room went silent. He tried to swallow, but his mouth was so dry. His “Please” was his tiniest yet.
And it wasn’t even the worst part yet. There was so much work to do, so much to prepare before then. Draco had to find resolve within himself and he quite frankly had no idea where the fuck it could be. He needed to strengthen the battlements and arm the troops and ready the bloody attack, but his faith in himself was as tiny as a button and he could never find buttons when he needed them.
He sat up straighter. Something felt painfully familiar, and it set everything in his head in motion, almost like he was waiting for this cue. As if he'd known something, for a long while he'd known something, and now it was finally going to unveil. His thoughts were running so fast in his head, it hurt. “When you said – when you said you killed him several times – “
The motion stopped and Draco’s eyes tore through him like silver arrows. “Harry, you can’t. You can’t risk yourself like that. Please, you must listen to reason. It’s not safe for you.”
“You’ve not – for goodness’ sake, Draco, would you quit lying? At least to yourself? It’s exhausting just to see. And whatever it is you’re trying to prove –“
Literally, everywhere he looked; the whole world seemed so tender and alive and alight. Everything was real, and he was here, so he had to be real as well. He could send his hand out and touch it; leaves and flowers and grass and ants, it was all there, it was all there. He cried so much and so hard he felt sick. This was it, this was the world, this was
Furious with himself, he started striding back towards the cottage. Harry made him memorize the area map, so he wouldn’t get lost, and besides the trail was spelled to guide him should he ask for help. Stopping to catch his breath and rubbing his face Draco took some damned gulps of air, hating himself,
There was a desperate sort of quality to Draco's voice, the same kind that throbbed in Harry's cock, he suspected. Without much ceremony he trailed his finger down that pink hole, and then he was... God. Inside him.
“I do. I really do. I’m never going to – I don’t ever want to hurt you, Draco. Ever. It’s the last thing I want to do. And I can’t tell you how proud I am of you for standing your ground, I’m beyond happy about that.”
“Then you know what might happen,” Hermione said, tense on her seat, sending worried glances to Harry.
But then he raised his glance to meet Malfoy, and was wholly rattled. It became clear to him in a moment that yes, he did trust him. Not only trust; he needed him, wanted him. If Malfoy thinks it's for the best… and he did have a point about meeting Voldemort in the end… he sighed.
Potter, Potter who cared about him so much he had tears in his eyes – Draco had to stop himself from wailing. “Potter, I’m so sorry. For everything. I’m so sorry.”
had got him down, that he won’t fight anymore. They were wrong. They were bloody wrong. He was Draco Malfoy, and he had a plan, and it was working, because he was still alive. They were wrong.
of explaining to do, you half-arsed, sorry little drab. Come on, get some drink in me, we have plan making to get to. Plus, I can give you all the best gossip from the last few years. You will not
“Quiet now, Potter,” Lucius said tersely. “We shall deal with you in a minute. The Dark Lord will show you the true meaning of respect.”
Warning: torture ahead. I know I did warn you guys, but that was *such* a long time ago, I thought we could do with a refresher. Well, here it comes...
. Now that he was here, finally at the place where he belonged, he didn’t need to put himself through all that anymore. He didn’t have to see the faces that were almost imprinted on his inner eyelids. He could be free once more.
A brief moment later and Draco was actually able to look inside. There were some potion ingredients, rare and probably illegal, carefully tucked in little tubs. There was a ring Draco hadn’t ever seen Him wear, golden and smooth. And there was a small glass bottle, full of a red substance that Draco’s crumbling brain took a second to connect to anything. For a second – a wild, wild second, a silly and wild and impossible second, and with complete disregard to what Grove had said, Draco wondered if it might be His blood. If maybe, after all, He didn’t plan to leave Draco magic-less for life. If He wanted him to have this, to have the option, if He wanted to help him. Then he noticed the tiny emblem on the glass, the miniature drawing of a dragon, and the moment passed. It was his blood. Draco’s own, which He kept to make the potion every year, and to make the poison for Harry. Another tool He used to control him.
Harry was throwing punches left and right, but there were so many of them and they had magic; Harry’s attempts were feeble and frankly pathetic. Draco looked everywhere, frantic, mad, but the flat was small and packed, and he couldn’t escape it anyway. He missed his bracelet so much it was a physical lump in his throat. Not that he particularly wanted to die, not necessarily, just... he needed the soothing jingle of the metal. He needed to know it was in his hands. He needed... damn it. He needed the choice.
Harry looked over at the Slytherin, who seemed like he’s shrinking continually into the chair. It couldn’t have been clearer that he wished the ground would open up and swallow him whole. Harry had an uncomfortable feeling in his gut. “He didn’t do anything yet, Professor. You can’t punish him for considering to do something in order to save his and his mum’s lives.”
. He was going to have to pay for this one. Draco wondered again about how he was meant to have loved Potter, and if that made him mad too. Graceful and mad. Not a terrible start.
Potter looked like he was about to argue, but then he sighed and nodded. “I had a pretty normal day, yeah. Some paperwork to fill in the morning, very boring. Chased this bloke around who was selling illegal potion ingredients – by the way, did you know the flower you keep in the shop is classed as a grade C dangerous plant?”
could they? He was just sitting there, Draco. Like he never did anything wrong in his life. Like he never forced an eighteen year old to his fucking knees so he could – could – “
Maybe it was odd, but this hug didn't hurt as much as he thought it would. It felt right in a way that Draco couldn’t really comprehend, and he wasn’t too interested in trying to. He placed his head in the crook of Potter’s neck and breathed him in until he almost suffocated. Potter’s shoulders shook, and Draco held him even tighter, even closer. Oh, gods, being held like that… being so close… Draco’s fear was stuck in an endless loop, and his elation was free to gallop all over the place. He needed, so much, and Potter just gave it to him. He held him so, so soft and so, so hard, and it was exactly, exactly, exactly what he dreamed of and thought he’d never have. When they broke apart after what must have been an hour or two, Draco saw that Potter’s eyes sparkled with tears.
Draco didn’t think too much about Gabriel after seeing him that day. All his thoughts on the subject were a dead-end, and there was no point tormenting himself with useless, unanswerable questions. The more time had passed, the less Draco was certain he was even correct. Maybe it wasn’t the man he’d seen in the flat. Maybe it was his Muggle twin brother. Hell, maybe it was someone else with uncle Rodolphus’s eyes. In any case, he had no idea what the meaning of it all could be, and Draco was pretty used to just letting things go.
That damn smile had his heart at max speed. “I don’t think you’re a master chef, I know it. Master of toast, if nothing else.”
“I missed wearing robes,” Draco admitted in a half-whisper. He caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror, looking like a wizard again, looking like a person. It was uncanny how well he wore that look. Almost as though he never stopped being either of these things.
think about Harry, and it somehow made it impossible not to. He was alone in his cell-cage, and naked, and it was cold. Draco wanted nothing more than to curl into a ball and disappear. A tiny, miniature ball, too small to be noticeable. He wanted to be nothing.
“This – this is where you practiced, last year?” He asked in a horrified tone. Harry saw his shoulders sagging.
“Ready, yes. As ready as I’ll ever be.” Draco zoomed on the video of the corridor where Potter wasn’t showing, thank fuck. He could picture him well enough. The man had to try on seven
“What brings you here tonight, Harry?” he supplied his question with the familiar x-ray piercing look that Harry so loved and feared, and that was more than he could bear. He nearly exploded as he landed on the seat in front of him.
The green eyes lit up. “You have no idea really. I am an amazing cook. Wait until I’ve made you a proper dinner once, then you’ll see. I’m sure you won’t be giving me a nine then.”
“Draco,” he said, a little hesitantly but gaining confidence with every second. “Draco, look at me, please.” He wouldn’t listen. Harry sighed and put a hand on his arm. “I’m sorry, but there’s one thing I disagree with. Please, would you look at me for a second?”
“Professor,” he murmured, shoving Ron aside. He caught the other boy’s eyes for a second, and could see he felt the same as Harry: utterly lost.
Draco knew why they brought him here, yes. It was because they were sick, sick people who had far too much power and didn’t miss any opportunity to show him that. He didn’t say it, though. He wasn’t
But he didn’t. Instead he heard someone else scream, a hoarse and low voice which made his already frozen body freeze all over again. They were torturing somebody
“Fucking – this, what you’re doing right now!” he pointed needlessly at Harry’s flushed face. “Stop being so good! I can’t take it, Harry! You can hurt me in many ways, but this is just too much! Please, I’m begging,
“I thought it was you in the beginning,” he admitted softly. “I thought – because I heard your name, and it rang in my head, clearing the fog. I thought you saved me.”
“Draco…” the exasperated sigh was frightening, but Draco still couldn’t think coherently enough to understand.
“I love you, Sir,” he whispered in a tight little voice. That earned him a kiss, deeper and hotter than the fires of hell. When it was done he was bruised and bleeding and happy.
that Draco had, and to give it away would be to surrender it all. Give in and perhaps Harry would lose, too. And he still loved him, Gods be damned, he loved him and although he was about to throw up in earnest he could not do this to him. He couldn’t. He just couldn’t. It had to be worth it...
right there in front of him, his face calm but his breathing telling, all ragged and heavy. Draco remembered the first time Harry knelt with him, how incredible it felt, how he didn’t believe it. Didn’t think it was something he could have.
Harry was too stunned to say anything, so instead he grabbed the pale face in two hands and forced him to still. “Malfoy, look at me. Look at me.” Reluctantly, the grey eyes found his. “I don’t know what in the craziness all that was, I have no idea what’s happening tonight, but it doesn’t matter. I know this isn’t exactly what either of us had planned, but this is what we have now. And I won’t exchange this, or you, for anything else. Okay?” Harry pulled him tight against his chest. “Forget about the past, you mean everything to me now. Everything.”
, but my partner is a right git who just loves to know everything, so he told me it’s actually called something else in the UK. Got to tell you it felt pretty good to hit him with a random fact of useless trivia back – I meant to thank you for it, actually. With the whole… I kind of forgot.”
“He has been living with Mother and me ever since my father was sent to Azkaban. He was assigned by the Dark Lord to watch us.”
“Precisely,” Draco didn’t bat an eye. “Glad we could resolve it so quickly. And on other news... Do you think it’d be all right if I went back to the flat for a few hours?”
On his own, on his own. He was all alone. Alone was not good for him, that had been established before, and now he was alone. Alone and no one will help him. Alone and expected to serve, for the rest of his life, as the New-Dark-Lord’s pet. Not the worst fate in the world, he’d told himself before, but also very much not… But no one was going to stop Him. No one was going to do anything. Draco was alone. And if so, if he was really alone, then it was time for him to stop being such a bloody coward about it. It was time for him to look, here, on his knees, here where he could both know and
was. Draco could only stare at the ceiling and wish to be able to believe that one day it won't hurt anymore.
“Believe what?” Potter chuckled, following him into the kitchen and plopping down to a seat in his usual familiar way that annoyed and exhilarated Draco so.
“All right, calm down. Here, drink this.” He slid a glass of water from gods-know where towards him and Draco drank it obediently. “Good, just... yeah, drink that.”
“Weasley. Granger.” Malfoy gave each of them a quick look, then brought his eyes back to the carpet. Harry could see him tensing up, and considering the events that transpired in Potions class, he felt a little apprehensive. He wasn’t sure if Malfoy was going to be angry, if he’s going to fight or just say nasty things. Instead, Malfoy looked like he was resigning to the fact his punishment was starting early. He walked even more slowly and sat down at the very edge of the sofa where Harry was perched, keeping his head down.
. Draco could not stand it; it physically hurt somewhere in the empty expanse that used to be his chest.
although he was quite certain Harry had tried to explain. What was going to happen now, what will be the next hit, what will happen to him?
The Slytherin snorted and looked at Harry. “A plant. How great. Something else to take care of. Stop it, Potter, you’re smothering me.”
“Oh no, I think I hurt little Hawwy’s feelings!” She let out a mad cackle. Her voice kept growing nearer, and Harry was well aware he didn’t know the way out.
“All while keeping him alive,” Draco concurred. “Because thanks to me, He had Harry in His pocket as well.”
Malfoy grabbed him by his collar and pulled Harry towards him, getting their faces quite close to each other. “No, you will not,” he said softly, and Harry’s heart was almost bursting right out of his chest with the speed it was going. He had to take some quick, shallow breaths, as his brain seemed devoid of oxygen all of a sudden. A jolt passed through his entire body as Malfoy let go of him, and he slunk back into his seat, flustered and hot.
“Ernie, one of them is coming right at you!” Harry shouted, looking to the edge of the room where the Hufflepuff stood. Ernie didn’t need to be told twice; he bolted towards Neville, and now they were both stranded pretty much in the middle of the room behind the desk. The last two figures were making their way towards them from either side, and now was the time to think fast. “Malfoy, we need to help them,” Harry gave a shout, and started searching for ways around. “Here, I can go behind that bench, and you can run from the other side and we’d get them both at the same time. Ready?”
“Oh, I don’t know if I’m – well, all right, I am good. It’s actually Mrs. Weasley who taught me how.”
Harry laughed a little, but it was pretty forced. Malfoy gestured him into an open doorway on the top floor. “You said that Voldemort wasn’t there all the times that Greyback attacked you. Does that mean it happened more than once?”
And nothing kept happening. It was highly unlikely and honestly just bizarre, but Draco was not grabbed by the hair or forced to his knees. He wasn’t kicked into a slobbering mess. He wasn’t attacked with the most vile of mentions. What the fuck
There was another soft chuckle which made Draco visibly shake. “You must learn to complete your questions, my Draco. It’s becoming tiresome.”
“Oh,” his heart went a lot faster now. It’s not that he didn’t remember, exactly, not that he forgot, just that all the stress made the information a little less accessible. “The bond. Of course. You thought – have I been…?”
Draco couldn’t tell anyone what happened upon their return, since he had no choice but to dash to the bathroom to throw up approximately all he ever ate in his life. Or at least that’s how it felt; he just hurled wave after wave of scorching, burning, livid relief. He didn’t know what to think, so he just stopped thinking altogether. His mind was empty. He was empty. (He was free). He was –
“Yes!” Draco cried out. Didn’t Potter understand? Didn’t he see what this meant? That everything he thought he was able to do, everything he thought he got through, it was all rubbish. He couldn’t handle anything, couldn’t do a bloody thing right because
The pain in Malfoy’s voice seemed to unlock something in Harry’s chest. “He was my godfather, you know,” he managed to say in a strangled sort of voice. “He was my dad’s best mate. He’s helped me through so much in the past two years, I really don’t know where I'd be without him. And then he was just… gone.”
And gasped in surprise – not only that the rug was transfigured back into a mattress, but it looked completely different. It was quite evident Potter had spent all this time working on it; he looked exhausted, but the result was very pleasing. It was pretty even now, thick and comfortable looking, and the bedsheet covering it was a Slytherin green. “Ta da,” he said happily, eyes shining with joy. “What do you think?”
This was stupid. Draco couldn’t stay in the stream; the water was rising quickly, impossibly so, and soon he’d be up to his chest in it. The most absurd part was that he knew what he had to do. He could not stay in the middle, for here in the middle he was neither calm nor safe. Here in the middle he was falling – floundering –
, Harry accused her of being neglectful (“I can’t be the only one who’s worried, don’t put all that on me!”), and Draco said some ugly, ugly things he regretted immediately and hated himself ardently for (“I’m so tired of feeling like a prisoner, Harry. Please. Please.”) In the end, there was nothing for Harry to do but buckle (“You kept saying, you kept
It won't. Draco was… maybe he didn’t really know who he was, after all. Maybe he really was nothing. Maybe he was useless, a cracked eggshell, a steaming pile of shit. It didn’t matter. He was useless, but it won’t stop him. He was eggshells, but he could fight.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked in a strangled kind of voice, but when Harry sucked on his lower lip, he opened his mouth and let Harry’s tongue in. Harry kissed him gently, smoothly, and soon he had him gasping for air, his eyes relaxing to their normal shut-state. With a quick decision, Harry’s hand sent to Draco’s semi-hard cock. He pulled at it in slow strokes, making Draco shiver underneath him. When he got his member fully erect, and Draco slightly heaving, he started moving again.
“Sometimes,” Potter shrugged, toying with his fork. “Sometimes I think it was so much easier when there was just one source of evil, you know? You cut the head of the snake, the body is dead. But now… nothing is as terrible, maybe, as big, but it’s just… you cut a little snake’s head, five more pop up. It’s exhausting.”
“I’m not drinking your blood,” Harry said vehemently, and it was almost enough to make Draco’s lips slip into a smile.
“It’s not all right,” Draco said, or tried to say. Anger was a welcome respite from breathtaking fear. “The exercise is worth shit, Harry. It doesn’t help.”
, but the name of his previous Head of House did stir something in him. He was too agitated to really perk his ears, but he raised his head an inch.
When Pansy asked him to rewrite her public statements for work, he assumed she did it because she took pity on him. Being the only one he could (try to) speak to about the ever-raging war in his head, the only one who knew him whom he didn’t betray by admitting how sometimes he still missed Him, how torn he felt at times, how he didn’t want – she knew just how miserable he was. She didn’t do it because he was any good with words or even halfway eloquent; she simply felt sorry for him.
“No, I don’t know him, but I know he loved you. He was your godfather, wasn't he? He broke out of Azkaban to save you from Wormtail. And he died to save your life that day in the Ministry.” Draco read so much about that incident after his father went to prison for it, he felt almost like he had been there in person. “So no, I may not know what he wanted, but it certainly isn’t this. Unless he was a fucking sadist, which would of course alter the picture completely, I find it hard to believe he would take any pleasure in you suffering that terrible place every single night.”
Lucius walked fast, and Draco didn’t have time to look around for signs of Harry. He didn’t have to look too far for Granger, however; as they walked upstairs he nearly crashed into her head-first. Her eyes landed on him initially, and she expelled a sigh of relief. “Ha-llo, Draco,” she caught his terrified look and quickly diverted. Draco measured her in a glance; other than a small red cut on her collar, she seemed fine. He nearly shook with relief, until he heard the cold voice at his side.
Lucius was very quiet. He almost seemed like he was waiting for something, and Draco knew it couldn’t be anything good. In the meantime, the Polyjuice potion was wearing off – how long do they have before Weasley’s hair will resume its ludicrous red color? Draco tried to search for Dobby in the corners of his eyes, but couldn’t see him. He could try and search for him in his mind, using that magical bond that once held them as a unit, but not with his father watching him like that. Right now, he could only hope the elf is still here and will be able to retrieve them before it’s too late.
Draco would have probably stayed on the floor much longer if it wasn't for the note. It took some time – perhaps an hour, perhaps longer – but in the end he did let his eyes wander around the room, and right there on his pillow he saw a piece of parchment he did not notice before. Curiosity (plus the painful need to think of
“How are you?” he asked a little stiffly as he sat on his sofa next to the boy. “Did they – er – try anything else?”
He couldn’t breathe; pulling ferociously at Harry’s shirt he brought him down as well, so now they were both kneeling under the Ministry like this was something people did. It was just… Draco didn’t know how to handle it, any of it. Any fucking part of it; Harry being terrifying, Harry almost making a deal with Grove,
Lucius laughed, a cold and detached sound that was completely humorless. “You thought he was your friend, didn’t you, Potter? You thought you can trust him.”
“No, it’d be best with you,” Harry muttered, and it was the truth. He couldn’t picture someone he’d rather do it with. Malfoy nodded again.
And thinking straight seemed imperative, now. It was almost ridiculous; he’s been with Him for four years, in London for three, and the amount he knew was close to nothing. How is this possible? He was in the building during their meetings. Damn it, he was in the bedroom. Had he really heard nothing to explain this? Can he make no sort of sense of it? And all the while, Daniel – a man for whom Draco felt an uncanny amount of emotion, for some psychotic reason or other that he was most certainly not going to go into at the moment – all the while Daniel was, if not in danger, then at least being fooled…
Potter was quiet for a moment, and Draco waited, letting his words sink in. He knew it would be difficult to hear, even more difficult to accept. He almost regretted saying it because he was so fucking terrified – but Potter was currently the only person that existed in the world, and Draco would hurt himself if he needed to, if it would help him. Potter who saw him. Who
when he himself was in shambles. In an instant Draco knew what made him so angry, furious even; it was that Potter was
“Please, Professor, you have to help me. I need to hear everything that Malfoy told you that night we came to see you. I need to know if –I can trust him.”
“I’m okay,” he shook his head. Could not take anything more from him, ever, ever again. He was already weighed so far down. “You had a decent enough meal? Weasley outdid himself yet again?”
“I think in the beginning it was because of my father,” he admitted then in a voice that was closer to a whisper. “My Head Guard was his warden when he broke out, back when Dementors still roamed the place. You can imagine his joy to have my father there again, to be able to punish him for causing so much trouble, for bringing slight and scorn upon him. And then when they got me… it was a dream come true. What better way to punish proud, detached Lucius Malfoy than to completely tear apart his only son and heir?” he took a sip of his water then clenched his hand right into a fist again.
“I just wanted to… Well… listen, I think there is a lot of – well there’s some – “ Malfoy was so flustered, it seemed like he had no idea what he was saying. “I – fuck it, Potter, look. I’m just so, so confused with everything that’s going on right now. I… I don’t think I can do this at the moment.”
Bloody Potter said Narcissa saved his life in the war. Draco didn’t know that. Or maybe he did, at some point, and just let himself forget because it was easier. During the time they spent in house-arrest before their trials, they didn’t speak of anything related to the war. Not of the Dark Lord, not of Lucius already rotting in Azkaban, not of the terrible things they have seen and have done. It was becoming quite clear by then that Draco will not be able to escape prison, not with the heavy sentences everyone was getting left and right. So they spoke about flowers and gardening and about how the changing of the seasons affected their plants. They talked about their favorite fruits and how wine tasted different when you’re sipping it on a lazy summer’s day in a garden in Provence. They spoke of light, frivolous things, as if they’ve lived light, frivolous lives, and Draco found it oddly comforting and infuriating at the same time. He wanted to shake her, to ask her everything, to
“You are? Even though you know what this means?” he asked in a tiny voice, so small Harry wasn’t sure he didn’t imagine it.
Harry would have laughed if he wasn’t completely drained of energy. “Right, it’s the room. Not our crappy lives or the very heavy emotional baggage we carry.”
“That’s the one, yes. Are you saying you didn’t actually marry her? I seem to remember it was all the rage back then. You couldn’t open a single newspaper without seeing pictures of your engagement.”
Oh, that. Draco forced himself to close his eyes and breathe for a full minute before he was able to answer in anything but a shriek. “Yes, I, er… I think I remember that.” It took another minute until he could concentrate enough to give an actually relevant reply. He tried to picture that day, and his anxiety took him there no bother; there he was, lying on the cot with the lime-green curtains all around him. He could almost, but not quite, smile. “I was told I fell from a great height. The Healers who treated me concluded it was an accident, and since most of the damage was fixed at St. Mungo’s, there was no official inquest.”
“Ah, I’ve faced him before, it’s really not a big deal,” Harry felt his smile becoming wilder by the second. “I’m not scared of him, and I’m not scared of you.” He pushed his wand into Malfoy's chest, making him gasp again. “You can’t do anything to me.”
“Please,” Malfoy said urgently, and Harry was a little alarmed to hear the sudden change of tone. “Please stop it. Not here.”
. The room spun into a sickening spiral and everything was blurry and dark. For the longest time he could not even pick out a single detail of the world around him, and had serious concerns he was blind. But after a while the panic and shock died down a little, and he was able to discern some things. Draco saw the desk, heavily scratched, only slightly better off than the wardrobe which was almost ripped apart. Even the door was covered by long gashes made by large, sharp instruments. He knew what made them, but was unable to access the information at the moment. Most of the things he had known were resting beyond a thick wall of ice. He did not know if he would ever regain them. He did not know if he would have the time.
. How he couldn’t even come up with adequate adjectives because he was so extremely tired after not having slept in about forever. That could maybe explain why the curtain was so unstable that Saturday. The mild
Draco wasn’t sure how he felt about that, but perhaps it was a little much to expect him to come up with anything decisive anytime soon. “Right. Okay. And – do you know what… what’s going to happen to me?” he tried not to look directly at Harry, so he wouldn't accidently trigger him into breaking the law on his behalf.
The noise in the room kept growing louder and louder, so much so that he could actually register it beyond the high-pitched ringing sound in his ears. He gave it no mind at first, although it did disturb him on some level. He did not like the way he was being looked at, either. Being in this cage made him feel like an animal in a zoo. He remembered the story Harry once told him about the snake he unleashed on his cousin before he was eleven. Thinking again about Harry safe in the castle, Draco could relax. He closed his eyes and shut himself off completely. Let them do what they want, it did not matter. As long as Harry and Mother were fine.
“Slow down, boy,” he smirked, his other hand sending to Harry’s thighs to hold him in place as his tongue returned to swerve and suck around his cock. Harry brought both hands to his face, one covering his eyes, the other running through his hair, his breath hot and ragged. He pushed his thighs further apart to allow Malfoy more room, and that was all he could do before he sunk into that incredible, unbelievable feeling that coursed through his entire body. He had no idea who he was anymore, what was happening around him; only the mouth around his cock as Malfoy pulled more and more of it into his mouth; only that warmth that was shaking his very core, the tightness in his lower belly.
“Harry,” Harry said, and for a second it didn’t make sense. “I’m probably as dumb as I look, yeah, but you call me Harry now, remember?”
There was a merry fire blazing in a brick fireplace, sending flickering light around the expansive room. It was decorated heavily with a thick tapestry that was splattered with gemstones and seemed both extremely expensive and tacky. It wasn’t beautiful; the tapestry was so dirty, the gems were dull. Armchairs and sofas were spread in front of the fire, old looking and a little torn in places, so heavily coated in dust it was hard to say what color they were. On one of them, close to the fire, sat a figure. When the door opened it turned towards them, giving them a look of surprise.
Only years of practice stopped him from throwing up the soup still warm in his belly, but it was a very near thing. In the short time since he’d seen him, Draco very much forgot all about his encounter with Potter. There was only enough room for Him in his mind. “He – what?”
Of course, since he really wished for it with all of his heart, peace was just not going to happen. Draco wasn’t the type who got what he wanted in this life. The door opened within a fraction of a second from when he finally got back to resting his knees and three chattery ladies came in, far too chipper for his liking. He couldn’t help but sneer at them.
“I kissed you,” Draco said, his horror mounting extremely fast. “I kissed you, and you didn’t even want to – “
“Why are you asking for my permission? I’m not holding you hostage here. You're free to do whatever you want.”
“Is it not conventional then, to slash heavily into your opponent when you have the upper hand, and burn them with a spell when they have it? Is not conventional what you call using
“Don’t say that… come on, we do have a chance, you must believe it – have faith, son!” Lucius was imploring him in a way that was highly amusing, had Draco been able to feel amusement atop the immeasurable pain and the bewildering anger.
He looked away. “All right. I – if you’re sure about this, fine. But… are you? Sure?” Draco might have been wrong, but it sounded a lot like Harry was begging too. Hardening himself he shook his head.
“Stop it, Ron,” Hermione said quietly, measuring amounts of dried leaves into the cauldron. “There’s no point making empty threats. Neither of you are going to do anything.”
“Er, no, I don’t think so. Come on, you know I have far too much money for my own good. I don’t want to become a spoiled little arsehole, sitting on his money and doing nothing at all. The trick is to spend enough of it while you’re alive, to remind yourself you're still living.”

By the time he was finished he’d lost so much blood, he fainted. Then when he awoke he dragged himself to his corner, made himself strip and kneeled until the middle of the night. He was already lost, so perhaps all this punishment was futile, since nothing could really redeem him now. The way he felt when Potter was around was definite betrayal. Draco hung his head down in shame and bit his lip until it bled. He was betraying Him, and it was so much worse than bad. He couldn’t possibly punish himself enough, though. Not by himself.
