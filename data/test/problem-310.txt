Harry shrugged a shoulder:
Ron was honestly surprised to see the ease with which Draco scooped Harry up into his arms and stood. Veelas were damn strong, apparently.
And all it took was another second for the two of them to burst into loud, raucous laughter.
Harry was falling.
Sam's brows were lifted when she looked at him again, his mouth forming an 'o'. Narcissa wasn't surprised, there had been rare few who knew just how much they had loved each other.
Draco paused, worrying his lip for a second. Was he okay in there? Did Draco have any right to intrude?
was glowing. Actually glowing. A soft golden glow fluttered outwards from him, outlining him like a saint.
Narcissa sighed deeply once again, her heart heavy:
He was fucking
Hannah sighed:
Harry took a few steps closer, until he was within arm's reach and stopped. He needed to allow Malfoy to recognize his presence there with both scent and sound, since Harry was sure that Malfoy couldn't quite see him properly yet.
"It looked like all the fight he'd geared up with left him in one fell swoop and then he just apologized. Just like that. It was rather genuine—I was touched, like I said." Potter then stopped and bit his lip. His expression went slack and something warm swirled through his eyes for a moment. "I must admit though, the hug I didn't expect."
"It's—fine, I guess?" He didn't know how to reply though, resulting to awkwardly rubbing his neck while attempting to articulate a more eloquent response.
"Yes well, that was disgustingly Gryffindor."
"Chess champion." She simply stated and Draco just nodded, accepting the point.
"Just tell me—Just tell me what you want—" Harry panted above him, green eyes shining, alight and mesmerizing, cherry red lips from kissing quirking into a relieved, slack smile.
Ginny had never recovered out of the love.
Was that better or worse? Draco wasn't sure, but if the sick, icy feeling in the pit of his stomach was to be trusted, it would only make everything worse than it already was. The blonde wanted to burst into tears and wanted Harry to be there to hug him, like he always would when something happened, he'd just hold Draco and not ask questions.
the idea of people seeing that he had someone to love him, someone devoted to him.
and no one knew what to fucking
Harry's stomach swooped out his body. He couldn't see Draco's face, but Harry could pretty accurately imagine it.
As if reading his mind though, Draco turned around to face him, his eyes puffy from crying but glazed from lust.
"Shove them in a room together. On the next full moon. Harry's transformation won't be nearly as violent or painful if he's able to connect to his mate." Her eyes flittered to the scar on Ron's neck for a second.
"You absolute
but to tell you—" Draco snapped waspishly.
"Thank you Kreacher. Since we'll be returning to school in a little over a week, could you also get the supply shopping done for us?" Harry shook his head, cleared his throat and spoke once he realized that the silence had grown expectant.
Harry went cold and stiff as the implication sunk into his very bones.
"Well?" Lucius pushed.
Draco was nodding, the pinch from his face smoothing away.
He had to do—something—There—
When Harry opened the door, his heart jumped to his throat as two Arurors in crisp red robes came into his view. He hastily stepped out and closed the door behind him. One of them squared up and spoke:
Draco said by way of greeting. Oh yeah, here it comes, Ron braced himself.
Draco snorted:
—there's nothing you could give me to do it."
Because Fate hated Harry.
Harry rubbed a hand down his face, his chest feeling hollow.
sting you. The door will open when all the questions are answered fair and square.
come over tomorrow cousin Draco?" Suddenly Teddy piped up again, quite impatiently, promptly reminding them both that he was still there, rendering Draco just a teensy bit guilty for forgetting.
If that was the case, then it made sense that
Harry’s lips lifted upwards the tiniest bit as he kept looking at the sky. “Can’t sleep either?”
The excruciating pain in Harry’s scar morphed into a dull ache when he saw the Captain standing at the end of the alleyway, fighting with the people in black robes.
“Pfft if it would've been up to me.” Blaise’s voice was unmistakable as he too entered the door with Pansy by his side. “he would still work here.”
“Your position is good, you just need to move your body in line with your sword, move as if the sword is an extension of your arm.”
“I need a little bit more than that to do a proper check.” She rolled her eyes, again. Rolling her eyes really did seem to be something she rather enjoyed doing. “It really would be best if you would just take your top off, I promise I won’t jump you.” She spoke the last part of that sentence with extreme exhausted sarcasm, as if to make clear that she would much rather do anything
“In my mind she does, now chop chop, the ball is waiting!”
A fraction of his scars was out in the open, the wind touching his skin freely for a split second before Harry hurriedly rolled his sleeve back down.
Luna’s voice was overshadowed by a louder, more impactful one. It was Eduardo. “Harry! You leave us for half an hour and you almost die, definitely seems like something all of us could pull off.”
“Oh that? That’s just the Captain; Draco Malfoy, he can be a real pain in the arse, and either has one of two moods: grumpy or slightly less grumpy. You probably would do best avoiding him, he can be kind of scary.” Even though Ron spoke about the captain in a negative way, Ron's tone was still somewhat admiring, his eyes looking to his leader with respect.
Harry felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him as he recalled the events that happened earlier, pinching the bridge of his nose. “He told me about Riddle and the map on his desk.”
“Loony, can you go downstairs? We need some extra rope for Neville,” the first voice asked, even though it seemed like less of a request and more of a command.
“Oh by the way, Captain?!” Ron yelled once dinner was almost over. The captain turned to Ron with one sharp movement. Ron continued, “We need to make a stop on shore soon, the supplies are running low. Again.”
exactly was on the black piece of cloth, but it was clearly a pirate flag nonetheless. He cast his gaze down again and pinched the bridge of his nose tiredly, wondering when it was all going to simply stop.
So um I know it's a bit early, but how do you guys like the premise so far? I personally loved planning ahead and thinking what I was going to do with the plot and development, but I'm truly curious as to what you as the reader thinks (since it's a bit of an unusual concept hehe)
"Only one other as far as we know and that's Riddle." The Captain's face scrunched up in disgust. "He likes to show it off too, doing things that others can't." His voice was lower when he spoke the next sentence, his eyes softer in intensity as well: "He does the exact things that you don't and never would. He kills. Just because he can."
Luna smiled. "You should go to the infirmary, Pansy is all excited to meet you." Her eyes twinkled. "Although you may not want to tell her that she's excited, she can get quite angry you see."
And the storm answered, rumbling in the sky ready for Harry to use.
When Harry frowned, Luna seemed to take notice. “Get it? Em? Short for Emerald? Because your eyes are the colour of emerald?”
He was pondering this over as he was making his way back to the Gryffindor common room, he had purposely taken a long route back, not ready to face his housemates just yet. The Yule ball was a masquerade ball this year and practically all of his housemates - with the exception of Ron that is - already had a partner
Next to the purplish forks he also had a tiny lightning bolt scar carved into his forehead that was usually hidden by his wild black hair.
meet again rather soon. Harry didn’t know and at this moment it didn’t matter. Quickly, Harry left the Amortentia behind, walking into the city of Valencia on his own.
The Captain got straight to the point. "Did you see a man in your mind when the men in black robes attacked you?"
“Why won’t you show me who you are?”
It was beautiful and heart wrenching at the same time, as the lightning seemed to mourn with Harry about all the things they'd been forced to do with that power.
“Calm down.” The Captain took a small tentative step closer, maybe without even realising it properly. “It was a dream.”
you to live.” Blaise kept walking forward, as if
he had done it. The Captain wasn’t anywhere to be seen not even on the sterncastle deck where Blaise was steering.
Truthfully speaking, both masks were beautiful, but naturally neither of them was ever going to admit it, this was a matter of principle.
Luna didn’t answer, instead she looked at Harry with a strange glint to her eyes. “Can you please come up with me? I mean I do really like to play hide and seek, but I can’t leave you here.”
“Will do… only… how would I contact you?”
“Mcgonagall doesn’t say ‘younglings’,” Ron supplied drily, catching onto what Ginny was trying to do.
use his new bed that night, though, as exhaustion overpowered his senses, making his eyelids droop.
“Great,” Harry said, still feeling a bit incredulous. This was strange to say the least.
“Such wise words, yet again, spoken by the great Harry Potter.”
“It was, and to know that it wasn’t all just dreams, to know that it was real… to know that
"Come on in," said a voice drenched in a Spanish accent from behind the door. "I can hear your hunger."
The man snickered as he took another step backward. “I believe we will meet very soon, Harry
The crew around him didn't seem to notice Harry's conversation with the storm as they ran around.
man - Harry realised - started emerging from the flames, wearing the same grin he had in the dream.
“Okay, Dorian,” Harry said, softly smiling. “Is that a promise for me to hear about your real name then?”
Zabini
that he didn’t pay attention to
cuss words then?”
Ron opened his mouth to reply, but was quickly shut down by the Captain putting his hand up towards Ron’s face, signaling that he’d heard enough. “Nevermind, I don’t want to hear the excuse, what’s the nearest place we can take harbour? Blaise?”
“Yet I am trapped on this ship aren’t I?” Harry asked, exhausted, he realised he was done, he didn’t want to go from one prison to the next, he would rather be eaten by sharks at this point.
“I suppose that’s logical.” The Captain’s voice was softer than before, and he was still looking at Harry, although his eyes were less intense.
The table was completely silent for a second and Harry himself didn’t really know what to make of that statement. He didn’t have much time to think about it though as Eduardo - ever the conversation saver - launched into an intricate session of small talk with Neville next to him. It didn’t take very long for the rest of the table to follow suit, and suddenly Harry was listening to Luna listing reasons to be careful of Tirifules, which apparently were a breed of seahorses that crawl into people's ears to fog up their memories.  It was rather enjoyable really: munching on his chicken while listening to Luna’s airy voice talking about what possibly was utter nonsense. It was by far the most interesting dinner he’d ever had.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “What are we eleven?”
Neville frowned in some form of concern, it only wasn’t clear who this concern was directed at. Himself? Harry? The crew? Harry couldn’t tell.
Thanks for reading ! I have exams this week and a part of next week so I might not be able to post as much as I usually would, next to that my betas are having issues planning, so it might take a bit longer to upload, but I
Anyways, you've probably had enough of my rambling, I hope you have an amazing day/night and I'll see you next time :))
Harry barely had time to prepare before Blaise suddenly latched out, his lean blade missing Harry’s face by a hair's breadth. When Blaise lashed out again, Harry clumsily held his sword up to his face as his only defense, the harsh clank of metal against metal echoing through the light night air.
“No Em, not like that, please try really imaging it
“Well,” Harry said, tying his snake mask around his head in the same manner. “your robes really do match your hair, I’m sure Lavender will love them.”
“At least it matches your eyes,” Ron said smugly about Harry”s mask, as he wrapped his own lion mask around his head, tying the red strings together in a knot. They were getting ready for the ball and Harry’s nerves were dancing around in his stomach.
The scars would light up whenever Harry used his powers or when he would feel something intensely, and naturally, now that he felt so incredibly anxious, his scars lit up in the faint fleeting way that indicated fear or nervousness.
“Loony where are you?! We need the rope now, the storm is setting in!” Another voice from the main deck echoed through the vessel.
“Did Draco say anything else?” Luna cut Ron off.
Harry didn’t say anything in response, instead he simply waited.
Hi, I, yet again, am back for a bit hehe. Enjoy!
“Pfft Ed, don’t be so sentimental, land in sight will always be great, I promise you that Harry,” Ron said rolling his eyes.
“Afraid not,” Ginny said, fake seriousness taking over her features. “The ball starts in five minutes, the great hall is waiting younglings!”
It was Zabini.
Just when Harry wanted to pull out his sword he was grabbed by the shoulders by one of the people and dragged away into one of the alleys. The people’s robes were black as they all wore strange masks, each of them covered in an eerie gleam of white. The person that had grabbed him by the shoulders was now holding Harry’s sword and turning it around in his hands.
“Sorry Captain that was probably me,” another voice said, both of their voices were unnaturally loud.
you to live.” Blaise kept walking forward, as if
“And I’ve come here to… ” He paused to pant a little more. “to… ”
to. He couldn’t be trapped
Suddenly there were hands on his shoulders and a hand pressed over his mouth, abruptly stopping Harry’s ragged breathing completely. Grey eyes were piercing his, never looking away, the Captain’s woody musky scent all around him. “Calm down.” The pale hand on his mouth was forcing Harry to slow down his breathing.
“Well do you?” Harry asked again, this time more pressing.
, I’ll shut up,” Zabini was addressing Malfoy before turning to Harry yet again. “I’ll leave you alone now Harry, see you at the ball, don’t forget your mask!”
He heard the dreaded sound of someone coming down the stairs and with every light step Harry’s heart seemed to leap, trying to run away from his chest.
“Is it okay if I take you back to the ship?” The Captain asked, gentler than Harry had ever heard from him before. “I promise it’s safer there.”
“Yeah,” Hermione said, skeptically looking up from her book. “And the only reason you didn’t is because Harry was reminded by
Have a fantastic day/night !
"I hurt you Ron, I could hurt someone else. I could hurt Draco. I won't ever take that risk again." Harry shook his head stubbornly. "Come on now." He sat down onto the floor and leaned against the wall behind him.
"Alright, alright. Just—tell me what's wrong, for the love of Merlin."
Harry stopped breathing as he watched—this moment felt so fragile, he was terrified even breath would shatter it.
"Thanks for the heads up."
Draco blinked and stared at the thing on the table after it hit him.
She was also surprised to report just how many questions about Harry Malfoy asked her on a daily basis—had to be at least a dozen per day. He never ran out of things he wanted to know.
Ron chuckled and waved her off as he toed off his boots and slumped into the couch:
Harry ran a hand through his hair and tugged on it harshly, desperately trying to think of an alternative. He didn't really have that much time—a few hours at best before the repairs were done and the repairmen left.
"I wanted to solve the issue of the office first before addressing that, and now it's solved." Harry shrugged, looking effortlessly graceful.
They were all beautiful, but Harry had his eye on a particularly timid, snow white one. It was pretty shy around him at first, but once it warmed up a little bit, it was quite the little bugger.
Draco felt so hyperaware, he felt as if there were a hundred eyes on him—he glanced around. There weren't. Just a couple of secretive glances and even more secretive smiles.
After that night, the days seemed to melt by seamlessly, slowly bleeding into months until the day came they were all boarding the Hogwarts Express to head back to their school and start their 6th year.
to your partner." He said it casually, but his leg was bouncing. "Besides, you look like you've got it all figured out, or you
Harry looked up into the higher branches hoping to find the answer and saw—
"You're soft," he reiterated with a smile and watching Draco's face go slack, his words long lost, eyes growing wide as he processed what just happened.
"Well? Which one of you wankers fucked with my office?"
"Good. That's good...I asked Ron to let me stay behind, didn't want to wake you..." He was rambling in his still not quite cognizant state, a yawn interrupting his sentence. He looked about ready to collapse again and Draco had to do something to ignore how his heart skipped a beat. So he insulted him:
He practically heard Malfoy stiffen up like an utter prat.
Maybe—It wouldn't be as bad as he initially thought. Just maybe.
"Yeah, pretty much."
something dark, who the fuck knows how the remains of the Mark lingering would react or what it would do to his magic.
Once it was done, Harry rennervated the repairmen and left them to finish the work, then fled back to the attic, where he found Draco staring blankly at the trapdoor from which Harry emerged from his spot on the bed, seemingly lost in thought.
"Indeed. You really think it'll work?" Draco bit his lip, a cant of fear tainting his mood somewhat.
All the things Harry knew about the blonde, the good, the bad and the downright horrific, it was earned.
"It wasn't only me, Mrs.Weasley." Draco pointed out, but she didn't let up, so he sighed and gave up the battle.
and it wasn't
He was shaking.
"I figured as much after aunt Walburga screeched at me from her portrait."
or ya know,
And his staring and observing had lead him down a rabbit hole he couldn't crawl out from—ultimately, Harry had a proper crush.
Harry winced violently, his jaw going slack while a freeze came over him. He'd heard the news. After Lucius Malfoy's lifelong Azkaban sentence for his crimes in both Wizarding Wars, Narcissa Malfoy had been under house arrest when her heart just gave out from loneliness and heartbreak.
Hermione sat frozen in shock.
He set it up and climbed his way up, setting up excessive Lumos charms to stick to the ceiling, illuminating the entire attic.
Harry loved Ron, but he didn't exactly trust him not to say something stupid or provocative, so he wanted to interfere, but before he could, Ron proved Harry right.
And where the hell would they go?
Everyone turned to look at Draco oddly, though he himself had no idea what was going on really.
"Right now." A voice drawled behind them, then Draco grabbed Harry's hand and kept his stride, pulling Harry along with him.
Why was he so
"I fucking
someone got it." He mumbled to himself, still grinning wide.
Not even when they poured vinegar down his open wounds.
As soon as they were about to pass each other, Pansy stepped forwards, automatically pushing Harry backwards , and Hermione stopped on a half-step, essentially swinging Draco straight into Harry.
Harry picked up the next question:
Casting a quick tempus, Draco was shocked to find it two hours after work ends. Was he left alone here? Did Weasley just—abandon him overnight?
Harry briefly considered the Weasleys, but he couldn't do that to them or to Draco.
"Why not? The war's over, you've apologized, I just figured that it might be good. To move on."
"Look, it's fine, just leave the writing portion to me since you're obviously just a disaster on legs." Potter waved it off easily when he pulled himself together and continued writing like it were nothing, but that snapped Draco out of his reverie enough to elbow the raven in protest of the words.
Draco's eyes shone, he leaned closer, his minty breath faintly ghosting over Harry's face:
you're
Malfoy closed off again and Harry feared it would go back to how it was at the beginning, but then—Then the line of tension bled out of Malfoy's shoulders:
"The last time I...cried, in front of someone else, is well, when Sirius died...And by myself...well, I think it was back while I was living with Dursleys."
didn't want such responsibilities during his last year of school. While he was able to forgive Malfoy for everything he'd done and said through some growing up and perspective shifting, he didn't feel as though things were okay enough for him to be obtaining such a level of control over him. Or any level of control over anyone, for that matter.
"Oh yea...We should go home..." Potter agreed easily and stood up, eyes still droopy and face slack.
He supposed that was something to be happy about.
"I want to have you at least once." His voice broke with unshed tears as his mind processed the fact there really was no way to pull Harry free from here—not even magic could save it this time. This was all he'd get. All
Harry shut him up with another kiss, "You love me."
Yes, it was true that Harry couldn't quite tell how he'd become a nanny for a Veela, but he'd come to realize that he most definitely could and would and simply just plain
"I've captured Harry Potter." Malfoy announced to the room and pulled up Harry's fringe, to flash his scar to everyone. "I'm willing to hand him over." He continued, voice calm and collected, a feat Harry was frankly proud of him for accomplishing. "On one condition." He finished.
to hear it from Harry.
There it was. The gnawing need to kiss the idiot in front of him. Draco briefly wondered if Potter knew what he did to Draco's insides when he talked all noble and forgiveness. If he didn't, Draco would be damned before he ever let him find it out, so he deflected back to the topic at hand:
Draco still only stared.
Malfoy stopped—stared.
If Harry didn't know better, he'd think Draco was flirting.
"Okayyy, but what do you want me to do about all this?" Godric half shrugged. Never in his lifetime
"Right. This is done then, yea? I'll go back to Diagon to find a repair service. Please don't put yourself in mortal peril while I'm out." Harry continued speaking, his voice promptly snapping Draco out of whatever staring daze he fell into.
But, these were Ron and Hermione. He could tell them anything. They wouldn't take advantage.
"Potter, you don't have to put on this whole show of—whatever it is, if you don't mean it. Trust me, you won't hurt my feelings."
Draco wasn't in any of the still upended bedrooms either.
Harry was even more horrified by hearing that. He felt the blood drain from his face and his skin grow prickly and icy.
Harry nodded and put a hand on Draco's knee, smiling his approval.
"I don't really cry much by myself, Merlin forbid in front of anyone else, I'm not much of a crier...The last that happened was..." He trailed off, sounding just as weak and unwilling to speak of it as Harry felt. "...The bathroom." He finally muttered out, and Harry still couldn't bring himself to look at him.
he accepted the call, and there was nothing able to stop Draco from surging forwards and yanking Harry up by his shirt to kiss him anymore.
"The fuck happened to your skin?" Ron leaned closer to inspect it, but then a spike of tension pulled Draco taut.
He spoke in a jumbled rush, knocked Draco's hand away from his cock and squeezed the base of it mercilessly.
"Malfoy. I wasn't kidding when I said you'll leave here all disfigured, cut it out." Harry opted for concern, he figured Malfoy wouldn't take well to being laughed at currently.
He should not be doing this, he knew that much. If those idiot Aurors had done a better job of looking for his oaf of a husband, he, a civilian, would not have had to drag himself through these damp, musty caves.
"Sorry I used it, but I just—I know you're probably pissed but I just—couldn't stand by and watch—"
Harry could hear the flap of Kreacher's ears from how violently the elf nodded:
He had
"Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life."
And that, was absolutely delightful to watch.
"The bond that you and my descendant were engaged by." Grimmauld spoke and snapped Harry out of his musings. "On his end it was a mere amatory bond, however on your end it was a wedded connection, because you fell in love so after the bond was conceived."
"What?" He muttered before he could think better of it.
Goodness, he was
Kreacher furrowed his brows:
However, Harry apparently really didn't know better, but he trusted Ron and Hermione's judgment. They were convinced Draco felt the same. So, this could very well have been some sort of flirting. In that case, he wanted to see how far he could push it and what kind of reception he'd get out of the blonde.
After the third time, when a litany of folders attacked him and smacked him around, he called Robards in to inspect his office for all the curses and jinxes that were undoubtedly placed on all of his things.
unless something changed.
, it caught me off guard."
"Right." Draco finally sounded. "Easier than I thought."
Harry's mouth dried.
Even still, even despite the fact he knew all that, he couldn't help but doubt.
"Grimmauld place!"
"Yeah. Can't believe it." Harry replied, sounding a bit dazed.
Malfoy finally turned around in his chair and stared at Harry, though it felt as though he was attempting to stare through Harry's skull into his thoughts.
Ron said nothing, he'd suffered enough of Draco's ramblings to know it was a rhetorical question.
The raven sighed but nodded dejectedly.
Malfoy just curled into him more though, and just breathed against him, and Harry let him. There was little else he could do but wait it out and hold him. Who knew how much shit he'd endured before Harry arrived? Besides, Harry would be a liar if he said he didn't enjoy hugging Draco.
They certainly did in Harry's.
"Not nearly. Why did you
Then again, if they stayed here, where exactly would they both sleep while the repairs took place? The upstairs was completely thrashed, there was no room that was left spared enough to be sleepable in.
"I'm happy—that you two found each other."
What Draco didn't realize, is that he didn't
"Fuck you. What do you
He saw Draco nod and swallow, then lean back against the chair and cross his arms across his chest.
Harry's heart warmed, but he scrunched his nose up in obligatory disgust.
Ron wanted to laugh hysterically, it was the
Draco read the next question:
listening!" the raven pouted and Draco just pinned him with the 'yea, right' look.
Harry's heart caught in his throat. It was true—he'd insidiously realized one night that being angry and spiteful was only damaging him in the long run, only clouding his mind and feelings, keeping him shackled to all the past hurt and trauma. Everything he always dreamed of leaving past him. During the war, the battling and running for his life and all of his friends' lives—he dreamed of one day standing proud and being free.
Potter didn't seem particularly bothered either:
"Harry?" Draco finally croaked, still blinking into the ether.
I can't believe it. I'm proud of you Malfoy."
Malfoy's voice was gentle when he spoke, a mercy Harry loved him so much for granting:
do is try to get Draco to ask Potter out, however she couldn't outright push
Malfoy breathing came in short pants, and Harry needed to stop him before he got stressed enough to start molting again, because after yesterday, it was important he doesn't fall under that sort of duress again for a little while.
Draco remained cross for the entirety of the first month, no longer even accepting to share the bed with Harry, which Harry understood and kept to his own space.
It had not gone unnoticed to Hermione that Pansy Parkinson was hanging out an awful lot with Harry lately—Harry had told Hermione that Pansy was a good friend once he gave the friendship  a chance.
Pansy had pressed a hand over her burning face—She was humiliated in Draco's stead. He was
They'd spent a full year studying and training in the art of bonding spells, their types, applications, strengths, duration—everything, and well, they were the best in the business.
"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard someone do. Harry seriously has strange ways to seek attention."
Malfoy accepted the cloak when Harry straightened up, but his face was twisted with clear disdain.
As he adjusted, his eyesight slowly focused on Harry, hovering above him, looking like a fucking
Ron was shaking his head, when Hermione continued talking:
it required some serious mental gymnastics and yet—yet it turns out it didn't really in the end. Potter told Teddy the truth, he
As he did so, he bumped into Ginny, who was wearing the same dazed, blissfully happy expression as Harry.
Malfoy nodded, and suddenly looked incredibly
"If it was anything like the one Slytherin speech I received before, I'm glad I didn't have to hear it."
Kreacher levitated Draco over onto the bed, and Harry stared down at him while he thought. He figured it would hurt, right?
didn't want to use the bloody thing, he didn't know how powerful the shock it would deal Malfoy was or what kind of potential damage it would do to him—he never planned on employing it unless he absolutely
"Salazar! Haven't seen you in a while, old chap. How's it going?"
He unlocked the heavy basement door and stepped in, grimacing at the sight of Harry panting and boneless on the floor, in torn clothes.
Draco grabbed the powder and disappeared before either of them could see his wrecked expression.
Harry left with a skip in his step.
Harry shrugged:
Harry threw his arms up with a huff:
Harry rubbed his neck. He didn't really think it would be noticeable, but then again, Hermione noticed everything.
aren't you funny?"
So he instructed her to mumble a fake Latin word passed off as a hex and he'd time it so to press the canceler and get Draco down and out of the situation, even though his magic was fine and there was technically no need to press the button.
And well, if such a reason did exist, Draco was
Lilly perked up:
After reading through the manila folder, Draco closed it and placed it flat on his desk:
"Coward though he is, I suppose we must repay him." Lucius continued, and that one sentence managed to snap that tiny modicum of self control Draco had been gripping to. He was far too terrified for Harry's life, far too grateful to him to let
he had no expectations nor burdens upon his shoulders.
"Do you want me to answer that or would you rather I pretend I don't know the answer?"
"I definitely wouldn't have been raised with the Dursleys." Harry spoke, perhaps too fast, but it was true.
Draco tipped his chin downwards as he discovered the same imprint of Harry's heart in Harry's own eyes, and Harry went cold and still—the world around him stopped, time itself, everything frozen in this single moment. He tilted his chin higher and then—
Since then, Harry hadn't really ever
Draco could scream himself hoarse before all the words ran out, but there was no one to listen. Ron couldn't bear it. Hermione even less so. Pansy plied him with false reassurances. The world certainly didn't care to listen. It kept fucking spinning, as if it had any
Harry took a deep breath and chuckled nervously:
someone's magic, as if they were just a lab experiment and nothing more.
It was such a relief to hear Ron had thought about everything the past month of school and came to different conclusions since it was his disapproval Harry feared most. He hadn't even realized how tense he'd been about Hermione and Ron's positions on the matter until just now when they'd told him in no uncertain terms that they supported him and wouldn't stand in his way.
Because Harry—the fool—was head over heels in love with Malfoy, and was doing precisely
The girls decided it was time to up the ante.
But she'd give him a chance nonetheless.
His eyes rolled into the back of his head, and he collapsed upon blacking out.
Draco breathed slowly, and sat down upon the grave.
Lucius's face crumbled—Narcissa couldn't find it in herself to feel sorry for her words all the same.
Harry took a few deep breaths, he needed enough oxygen to process this.
however, turn you over to the Ministry if you call me that ever again." Harry muttered, a coil of frustration in his chest as he joined Malfoy at the table. He
Lucius arched an eyebrow:
If it was possible for a person to look shattered at the same time as incredibly enraged, Draco looked it to the 'T'.
Draco crumpled against Harry's chest with a low whine, his head falling back onto Harry's shoulder.
Draco was like a very small child, or a puppy.
He hated being the one to leave his best friend in pain and chained up like an
He looked up at Draco to find Draco already staring at him, with such an intense, forlorn expression that Harry couldn't deal to dwell on currently.
has to take care of you."
He slowly shook his legs out and stood up, walking over to where Kreacher was checking Draco over.
Narcissa sighed long and quiet—averting her gaze pierced with profound sadness—as she twirled her wand to summon some parchment and a quill.
Kreacher popped in and was immediately repulsed and horrified to see the state of Harry. Draco didn't give the elf any time for anything:
Draco scoffed:
"Would you like to be famous? In what way?"
Did Draco think something would change when they returned to school?
Harry quickly moved on, before the heaviness of the moment settled in too deep:
It was a necessary risk regardless.
After Harry's death, the entire Wizarding World was thrown askew. When they had his funeral—buried an empty coffin—half of London was there to send him off. The Ministry had nearly fallen apart, and everything had to be reorganized.
Harry keened long and low in the back of his throat as he came undone inside Draco just as his knot began to let up.
And pretty much all of them, Ron included, raised their hands.
"I—like them." Draco continued, softer this time, seemingly fiercely determined to make Harry feel better somehow. "That fight—it made me feel something, back when—" He shook his head. "Bottom line is, it's fine, stop looking like a guilty kicked puppy and help me with these fucking cramps."
The powers that be did not like Draco.
They'd gotten into yet another fight...
Harry rested an elbow on his knee and dropped his head into his palm. This was really it, the only option he had. Accept this task and obtain an uncomfortable level of obligation towards the Ministry and an even more uncomfortable level of control over Malfoy, who would probably kill him in his sleep for this, even though it was just as stupidly forced onto Harry as it was onto Malfoy.
Granger gaped, all her nerdy love of learning on clear display for everyone to see.
"Oh my god, look at Malfoy." Ron snickered and nudged Harry under the table with his leg. "He looks so
"Hey Ron, mind if I borrow a shirt—" His words died when he saw Draco in the kitchen.
"Oh you think this is
"Of course Weasley. I sort of need him whole anyways." Draco wobbled a smile, and earned himself a few uneasy chuckles.
"You haven't deserved it yet." Draco's smile was criminal.
"Mate! Of course not! We've talked about this a lot, and we know when you love someone you just do. It doesn't matter if it's Malfoy. It's a little unconventional, but you've practically been living with him for a while, so obviously you must know something we don't."
Ah, and just like that, the spell broke.
Harry felt bludgeoned to the head.
"It's physical contact." Draco suddenly spoke, snapping Harry out of his thoughts. "It settles the bond a little, it probably registers that as a prerequisite of sex."
Harry felt lightheaded from the thought his feelings might be returned. Draco had to like him at least
And he looked ashamed.
If he was being perfectly honest with himself, that last one was the most likely answer. It was perfectly logical that Malfoy plain and simple didn't want contact with Harry, which Harry would have to accept.
Harry hadn't slept in about a month now.
"Slander! Lies! Just you wa—"
Draco Malfoy we're talking about here after all.
"Don't fucking stop it now, it's obviously helping—" Draco acridly muttered over his shoulder, voice a sigh.
"And that's when he forgave." Kreacher simply replied.
Which meant that Harry would have to let these people leave and file a report, but he and Draco would have to be gone outta here before the Ministry sent someone in. Without a doubt they'd arrest Draco and release Harry of his duties on account of Harry being irresponsible and allowing Draco to be destructive when he had the means to prevent it, take the device off him and either haul Draco back into Azkaban or find another handler for him.
Harry knew that. He'd known for so long.
He read the next question:
"Right." He nodded, but then fell short. He didn't know what to say anymore, he didn't know what to
spending this entire party pining in a corner." Hermione snapped and passed off the butterbeer to a charmed floating platter. She grabbed his arm and dragged him onto the dance floor, despite his continuous protests. If they had to do this the hard way, then they would, but she wouldn't let the night end until they both saw just how much they meant to each other.
It made Harry float.
"I'd ask about my future.." He huffed humorlessly. "If I even
while."
"Are you going to say anything, boy?" Salazar tilted his head to the side after a full minute had passed by.
"Harry, you know I can't do that. This is my job here, I can't abuse it, I'm sorry."
What Harry figured was the more likely case here, is that they came to pester Malfoy, even though he'd been released fair and square and was for all intents and purposes under Harry's custody now.
Malfoy wasn't letting go of him either.
Because the address Potter had given him was not his own, it was Weasley and Granger's address.
Draco dropped his hands, tears gathered at the corners of his eyes even as he rolled them:
, and
Harry didn't pay him any mind. Instead he centered himself and imagined Draco. He imagined his posture, his lithe frame climbing up to a pale, aristocratic features and soft as down platinum hair. He let the mental image linger deep in his mind for a moment, before he twisted on the spot, holding his breath as he apparated.
"Why?" Hermione leaned forwards, brow furrowed. She'd attempted to talk to Draco multiple times over the course of the year, but he always fidgeted and attempted to hide behind Harry, so Hermione gave up eventually, though she was determined to give non-verbal cues that she did not hate Draco and had found it in her to forgive him. Ron had been more pushy, he wanted to cultivate peace for Harry's sake though he attempted it rather violently by yelling Draco's name in the middle of the Quidditch stands and running up to him to start a Quidditch debate, which only resulted in Draco walking quickly—
Hint sufficiently taken, Harry now had no idea what to do with it other than find some way to let Malfoy know he'd got it. He'd have a meltdown later over what it meant and didn't mean.
Harry nodded—that made sense.
"Yes, exactly. I don't think we can pull it through somehow though." Ginny reflected his own thoughts from earlier and Harry bit his lip. He rubbed a hand down his face:
He didn't push it any more than that, just left Draco to his robe sniffing and stood.
"How the fuck do I get him out?" He almost tripped over his own words.
"In our second year Harry was
He shouldn't be so shocked, it was just that the two of them hadn't had a decent conversation prior, so it came as just a little bit of a surprise to hear this. Especially from Malfoy, whom Harry had never really pegged as particularly caring of a person. Though it wasn't as if he knew Malfoy very well either.
"I just don't like it."
he wants to tell you kept him up at night, I barely got him to settle in." Potter wrinkled his nose fondly and Draco bit his lip, casting Teddy a conspiratorial look:
A brilliant, beautiful smile broke out on Harry's face, so happy and carefree in a second that Draco's heart hurt.
"Yes—quite madly too, seeing as it was strong enough to mangle their bonding." Ginny hummed thoughtfully. Things with Tori had been slow and tentative, painfully so, but they'd gotten through it somehow.
I am a
did Draco just run out of the house as if the devil was at his heels, and
"What are you--?" And then it hit him.
"Yeah, alright, makes sense."
"Got you."
Ron nodded with a huff:
"I do apologize, but I don't actually have much control over my dreams." Harry finally deigned to speak, carefully attempting to lighten the situation, hoping Draco might get past his hurt and anger and start talking with Harry again.
she could channel a bit of Gryffindor.
Harry figured he could spare him:
Pansy and Blaise snickered simultaneously, when Blaise answered:
back there, you know?" Tori smirked faintly, though it was more sympathetic than anything else.
Draco stopped—he looked horrified:
Harry grimaced at himself. Had he really not noticed any of this?
"Oh yea! That one's my favourite, because it means even heroes need help sometimes, no one is strong all the time. And I like that, it's true I think."
"Everything—If I hadn't had my friends by my side, I'd have been dead long ago." Harry assuredly answered. It was the one thing he never doubted. He'd be lost without Ron and Hermione.
"Harry, I know things haven't been pretty, but—"
"Welcome
"We'll be in Hogwarts then." Draco pointed out, chewing on his bottom lip. The one Harry kissed. Harry shook his head to clear it.
Ron made for the Fireplace. Usually, the DMLE kept the Floo locked and warded, but the Aurors were keyed into the wards. He did his best to imitate Malfoy's poncy accent as he answered:
When he witnessed Harry's
"You'll leave here completely disfigured if you keep this up." Harry pointed out, but Malfoy's glare shut him up. It was sad to see really, how much of himself Malfoy felt the need to hide and lie about.
Harry's eyes stung from the brightness of the space around him. He looked down at himself, then all around himself and saw—absolutely nothing but white.
"Do I get any details?"
and his hair was messy—Draco couldn't stop fucking staring.
Ron grimaced just at the mere sight of the blasted things.
Draco arched an eyebrow as he fumbled around to get some coffee inside him. He wasn't a functional human being until he'd had at least one cup.
Well then.
Harry pushed the bite aside and read the next one, eager to drive the topic away from Malfoy's mysterious love that wasn't him:
is Harry shaking like a leaf and stammering uncontrollably?" Hermione deadpanned, crossing her arms across her chest.
"…My apologies. I'll make it up to you." Draco muttered with flushed cheeks when Harry held up his torn shirt for Draco to see.
Potter sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose:
should I trust what Malfoy says? He hates Harry, he likely put Harry in danger himself!" Ronald defended, throwing his arms out.
Malfoy finally asked, voice mellow.
"Not too sure if you know you did it yesterday, but you called to me." Harry's grin widened.
It was the first time someone had received the story with a blank face and Harry just
"Yes, we have." Harry nodded, but didn't bother to elaborate.
drinking again, if she had anything to say about it.
Usually that was a very good thing, however, when it came to all the darkness and pain that ate Draco up inside, it was like a stab in the gut.
"You're doing good-
himself. We've
The guilt burned like a
Ron only managed to nod as they made to follow.
Draco arched into him, sharp shocks of pleasure pushing him to jerk his hips up into Harry's, delighted at the answering erection he felt there.
When the faint sickness of Apparation passed, Draco realized his parents had Apparated them into Diagon Alley, in front of an old, dusty all night open pub. They marched in and picked a table shoved into the farthest corner, warding it to heavens, so that no one would take any note of them.
"Yes, Harry, I suppose I will."
"Potter—" Draco reached out for Harry, eyes wide and swimming.
Malfoy just kept glaring at Harry:
Harry was honestly surprised how
"Nonsense, come in." Narcissa spoke up from behind Draco and startled the three of them.
that one time—
famous, well, rather,
"What? Why are you looking at me like that?" Harry decided to give an out of this topic by poking some fun, which he found always worked well to diffuse tense situations such as this one.
Worked like a charm.
In the research he'd done with Ron and Hermione on memory spells and such before they'd left for Australia to find her parents, they'd found plenty of spells that could alter memories without harming the individual overall or outright Obliviating them. Some were irreversible, others reversible, but there was a vast selection.
And Harry couldn't take that from him, even if he felt as if his stomach acid was clawing its way up his throat by letting Draco's state run so unstable and his magic go so unchecked. Even as he wanted so badly to step in and pull him away, to protect him, to calm him down.
"Hey Harry. I'm home."
Malfoy didn't ask, but the unspoken question was naked on his face so Harry indulged him:
The blonde almost rolled his eyes, but he knew it would hurt Harry if he did so, so he just huffed and pouted, taking a deep breath before he started to press in, sure he was going cross-eyed into delirium as he entered Harry in a long, slow slide.
She rolled her eyes:
After a tense, glowering silence, Narcissa and Malfoy were marched into the room, shackled and shaken, looking just as distraught as Malfoy had when he'd first pounded on Harry's door.
Malfoy burst into a fit of laughter—that had Harry's breath hitching, how unrestrained and merry it sounded.
"He said it wasn't me, that he couldn't recognize me. Right in front of all the bad guys." Potter's voice floated over to them and Draco startled a bit, turning his head to find Potter leaning on the doorway, arms crossed across his chest, his expression something that could be described as fond, if one was so bold. "Isn't that right Draco?"
"You really think anyone will buy that?"
"Say, Teddy, why don't tell your cousin Draco why that's your favorite story out of all I've told you about him?" Potter suggested, seemingly content to just sit back with a cup of tea and listen to Teddy talk to Draco.
Potter spared him the trouble though:
"I don't know." Harry spoke softly. "It isn't fair."
Ron's horror freshened anew, while Hermione didn't look particularly surprised:
They never found his body.
the same, but looking at him
"..Come to think of it..he's been staring at Harry a lot more, though he's been doing that since we were eleven so I guess that's why it took me so long to notice...Pair that with the rest of the story and....
When the results popped up he started reading through all the names,  looking for something interesting that might catch his attention. Draco was wont to be picky so he assumed it would take a while, but not long after he actually came across something interesting.
"I—I want to—" Before Harry could finish his sentence, however, their door burst open and a furious McGonagall stepped into their dorm.
Harry dared a glance at Draco and stifled a groan. He looked—well, he
"You can." Harry smiled, and that was all the incentive Draco needed to lower his head and kiss Harry.
"Thought as much." Hermione shrugged. "Ah, who cares?"
"Why do you—why do you still hate me so much..?" Harry suddenly broke the silence in such a pained, small voice that Draco had to clench his fists not to run to him.
People had been giving him and Draco dirty looks as they stood together, but Harry ignored everyone even though he really wanted to hex them into oblivion. He felt Draco shifting his weight behind him, hovering close by, eyes downcast.
And it was then that the
By the time Harry had managed to quell Ron's outrage at the fact Harry was rooming with Draco, make sure the Ministry had properly informed McGonagall of the magic canceler, found Draco and then navigated his way through to their dorm, the sun was already setting, and Harry was beyond exhausted.
Draco knocked, the hustle and bustle behind the door ceasing when Weasley opened the door. He appeared just as surprised as Draco felt to find him there, but then shrugged and invited Draco in.
Harry smiled fondly:
at it, effectively shattering it into a million pieces and causing a great snap and crash of ceramic cracking violently.
"Hate to interrupt you guys, but Harry, you've finally done it. You've finally managed to go and break my best friend after seven long years of trying and failing." Blaise called to the group, whom all turned towards him.
He should sleep, tomorrow is the first day of classes.
"Oh we are? Oh that's good—I'm so glad we're wrong—" Harry exhaled long and loud, smiling wide for some reason, looking immensely relieved.
"I see, alright. Well, there's many things I'd like to change, but one year isn't nearly enough time to do that, so I suppose I'd do something I
"I know it's a lot, let's just talk." And like that, Harry sat next to Draco and sidled as close as he could get before he leaned in and began to talk quietly enough no one else could hear him.
Harry swallowed a grin. Ah.
"Not to say he didn't have it coming, because he absolutely did, but that was cruel, even by my standards." Draco muttered into Harry's hair, holding him tighter than earlier.
Said blonde krup was just as lost though, so Harry took solace in the fact that they were both, in fact, hopeless idiots.
"We had an agreement, Draco. I won't go around protecting you, but! If shit got out of control you'd let me use the damn canceler." As he spoke Harry tore the thing from around his neck and tossed it on the bed Draco was standing next to. "But just then you all but begged me to let you keep going, and you'd have never forgiven me had I actually went and used it." Harry was panting by the time he was done, heart bleeding frustration. Draco hadn't said a word but his expression had spoken so many volumes. His had eyes pleaded with Harry to let him.
He conjured up some lube onto his fingers, rubbing them together to warm it up, reaching down to press a finger to Harry's entrance.
The part that had bugged Draco the most during the announcement at the Welcoming feast a few hours ago was the fact all Pureblood students in attendance would be paired with a Muggleborn or Halfblood to help them along.
"It is true that Master Harry is not angry anymore. But Master Harry used to be angry, at everything, everyone. Master Black too. Especially him. But one night two months ago, Master Harry sat down and wrote everything he was angry about. He wrote for hours and hours, until the sun went up. His hand was cramped. Then he burned all of it. He watched it all burn and told Kreacher he finally felt free."
Now, touching a Veela's wings was an honor a Veela only permitted their mate or a Healer if the need was dire. Anyone else that tries never ends up having a good time, but currently the need was dire so Harry had no choice but to brave it.
"When we alter it, it can't kill us anymore, can it?" Harry prodded, suddenly feeling seven pounds lighter and at least several IQ points smarter.
Ron told him a lot about what it had been like while he was away, and Harry's heart broke when he heard what his friends had gone through without him, especially Draco, who seemed to take it hardest.
"Draco, I give you Hannah, Dean and Ron."
He had half a mind to drag Draco over to Harry's right now, but he couldn't do that, Harry had most likely fully transformed by now and would have Ron's head if he brought anyone into close proximity.
For a few seconds, Malfoy blinked in confusion as he stared at one of Hogwarts' founders, then his brows furrowed and his expression grew enraged.
Oh for
Since he would only be altering a very specific part of their minds, he needed a precise spell that would target only the intended part of memory. With that in mind, Harry was able to think only of one that would suffice.
Harry just nodded:
Zach was squirming at his desk, it was plain he was
"Haven't you heard? I'm the Golden Boy." Though Harry chuckled, it sounded empty.
The girls let go and hurriedly disappeared in the crowd—before the two got their bearings enough to yell at them.
Sweet Merlin and Christ.
Was he even aware he was emitting the call? Harry knew it was possible that, though in most cases, Veela were very conscious of the fact they're offering to be a mate, like it happened to Harry, sometimes, the Veela wouldn't consciously make the decision, it would happen of its own accord with the person they wanted.
"You could've gotten killed son." Lucius snapped, voice more frantic than he likely would have wanted.
Harry continued in a small voice.
to offer to be Harry's mate. To call to Harry.
would jinx you? We aren't children anymore—the Tripping jinx is for babies."
"Well—not
He wouldn't step on Draco. He promised to not go around protecting him, but—he did have a caveat to use the canceler if things got dire.
"Clever." Harry murmured.
Harry shook his head to clear it then took his obligatory three drops of Veritaserum, before answering in the same predictable pattern as he always appeared to:
Because Harry
"You will be in detention for as long as it takes for you to repair the window you shattered. As Mr.Potter notified me about your situation at the start of term, he will be joining you, to make sure everything goes smoothly."
Harry sighed. He knew exactly what Malfoy was implying but he wasn't sure how to explain to the arse that he simply didn't plan on antagonizing anyone anymore ever again.
Potter knew so much, but then again, the arsehole did stalk him through a full year of school, so Draco didn't doubt that he'd found ways to gain information he wanted.
Harry—
Draco flushed and sputtered, but Granger just snickered and patted him on the back before drawing her wand.
Then Harry realized that that really wasn't supposed to be his first concern in the situation. He was strangely okay with the position they were in though.
Which was when he realized he couldn't move his left leg.
"Oh." He intoned, very quietly. "They weren't here for the noise, were they?"
and squeezed tightly afterwards.
When all of that was done, he left Draco on his own and ventured out to go find the closest Repairs service in the area. The excuse he'd worked up in his head for the state of things at home was that Grimmauld was so old the wards went wonky and ended up damaging the house. He was half sure any half decent magi-repairman would see straight through the lie, but Harry hoped he might be able to draw out some of the admiration people seemed to feel for him and use it.
Harry was left contemplating this. He was still hard and in pain, skin prickling with need, but looking at Draco didn't feel like he was drowning this morning, the way it usually did. So, there was some truth to Kreacher's statement that the bond wasn't as restless, but, Harry didn't understand why. His brows furrowed as he struggled to understand it. From what he knew, the only way to settle it is to have sex, but—
Ron raised both his arms in a placating gesture:
It was an experience Harry really did not want to repeat. The pale splashes of skin among his own on his right arm still itched sometimes.
Malfoy nodded and considered:
"Mother is—
"Yes! And they're very
Harry was wondering whether it was legal for a person to be so beautiful for a moment longer than appropriate. Then he chuckled:
Draco pulled his mother in for a hug. He was so grateful to have her by his side with a father like Lucius:
Harry did that to him, made him
"You'll get an heir either way." She pointed out calmly and took a long sip of her tea. "But you'll only get your son's happiness one way."
Speaking of, how
"As much as Grimmauld is feeding into Harry, it is assimilating his magic into itself, because it can not forever keep him there on its magic alone, it would run out eventually, so it needs to merge with him."
Another positive thing about you...hm...I guess how earnest you are—it's sickeni—" He hissed in pain as he got stung again.
Harry was surprised to see this to be the case the first time it happened, though he knew why it occurred. He was in love, and he supposed that being forced to tell the truth, he wouldn't want to kiss or marry anyone else that was offered to him, so it made sense. The issue Harry had with this though, the fatal flaw that unhinged everything, was that Harry was in love with Malfoy himself.
Harry bit his lip, urged Draco to continue. He did, his voice shaky:
likes you Harry." Hermione was nodding along.
"Yeah, I guess you're right. I feel guilty pushing it that far though, yet at the same time, I want the idiots to be happy."
"Do you think they're..." Malfoy's voice was cut and bitten in the wind whipping around them as they flew, but Harry could understand him perfectly well. He leaned forwards so that the other would hear him:
Ron hid a smile as he left the room.
"Merlin Granger, how have you kept it together with him all this time?" Draco couldn't help but ask. From the stories he'd heard and, well, seen, considering how much time he invested in staring, Harry's day-to-day was incredibly hectic.
It was just...Harry would walk in, and Draco would clam up for no reason at all. He'd start feeling all shy and fluttery and there was no rational explanation for any of it.
"I'll tell him you said thanks...in your own, weird, roundabout way." Weasley snorted.
He stretched up and tossed an arm around the back of Potter's chair, pointedly glaring daggers at Pansy.
He was here.
Draco hadn't stopped crying through a huge smile and a pillow clutched to his chest while he watched Harry the entire bloody week. It was as though he finally felt emotions again, no matter what they might be, that he would cry then laugh then just blankly stare and Ron couldn't have been happier to see it.
So Malfoy loved someone. Another guy. Somehow that hurt worse than when Harry believed that Malfoy was straight as a pole.
"I just love him s'all."
Sighing fondly, Harry picked him up best he could, trying his best to not jostle him around too much. He turned around to face the still gaping crowd and scowled darkly at all of them, instead focusing on Ron.
Potter hesitated for a moment, but then shrugged and answered her anyways:
"I'll hex you?" Malfoy tried, but all his pretense of being serious dropped and he huffed: "Bloody hell, when I was turned into an animal." He gave up and puffed it all out.
Draco nodded:
It was bittersweet and very underwhelming—the way nothing really happened, though Harry knew better than to expect anything to come off it, they'd only really taken the job so they could see Draco and Astoria again anyways, but it still ached a bit.
The light was living—it breathed around him, swelled like waves past his skin, an inexorable force that existed in infinite stretches around the raven.
Harry just shrugged:
"You say that as if it's some sort of prize."
"Yeah, alright." Malfoy muttered, though he didn't say anything else. He yawned instead.
"What?" Potter grinned as he affected mock offense.
Pansy and Hermione stopped in their stride and looked at each other—exchanged a silent conversation.
Last night there was none of it, Harry realized. He supposed that the moment was too private and emotional in order for him to register if his body reacted in any type of way, but regardless of that, it seemed that touching helped.
“Yes,” the Captain said curtly.
would be so excited about him waking up. Instead of asking about that, Harry asked something else, though, something that seemed more pressing. “How long have I been out?”
The captain looked at Luna as if she was properly insane. He and Luna seemed to be in a staring contest, talking with each other through their eyes in some way, until the captain seemed to give up, tiredly rubbing his eyelids with his fingertips. "Fine keep your street rat Loony, but don't come running to me if he can't survive the sea." Anger flared in Harry's chest as the captain spoke the words so disinterestedly. No one should treat death so indifferently. Before Harry could recoil, though, the Captain spoke up again. "I don't have time for this, we have a storm to challenge. I want all hands on deck!" the captain yelled the last sentence, making it clear that he was addressing the whole crew.
“We’ve been waiting for you,” one of the people said.
Harry snickered warmly. “I already hated you, you were never very nice to me. Doesn’t mean that can’t change if you would want it to.”
Blood was gushing from the black robed man’s mouth as he slowly seemed to open it to talk. He directed himself at Harry, not paying any attention to the Captain’s sword hovering above him. “Don’t believe for a second that you’re safe, he will come back, stronger than anyone you’ve ever fought before.”
.” Eduardo winked. “Just go already.”
“Of course Captain!”
“Great hospitality here,” Harry answered rolling his eyes.
And for a moment, Harry forgot what they were talking about as his gaze slid downward, straight to the stranger’s lips. Harry wasn’t really thinking as he placed his hand onto ‘Dorian’s’ face and softly, so softly that it barely counted, kissed him.
Harry took a final step closer, now he was standing so close to Malfoy that he could feel his hurried breath on his neck. “Malfoy, do you really like me?” Harry asked softly.
“Oh yes, he’ll be happy to see you,” the person with Harry’s sword said.
left and wasn’t waiting for him to come out. He would leave soon, just a few more minutes.
Harry's felt his eyes widen: he never really stopped to think if there were others like him, he had just always
Until…
A breath, a burning city, one man slowly arose from the flames: the skin on his face was pale and his nose seemed to have burned off, leaving only two gaping holes in his face to breath through.
Harry shook his head, trying to properly register what just happened and started to, yet again, walk back to the common room, only this time, with completely different thoughts than before.
Harry smiled. Of course it was, he must’ve summoned it when he was afraid.
The smiled was back on Eduardo’s lips. “Yes, of course I’m sure, the Queen knows I need help feeding you idiotas every day.” He turned towards Harry, the delighted twinkle of excitement in his eyes. “C’mon Harry we have work to do, the food is waiting.”
Harry hated that he was right, he had nowhere to go until they would reach land again, he would have to wait, hoping that the pirates would keep to their word.
Harry smiled slightly, the fragments of his nightmare threading on the borders of his mind, and walked over to Ron and Neville.
“Hey Potter!” Blaise yelled from the side of the quarterdeck, pulling Harry out of his thoughts.
"What? No, he doesn't control the lightning, in fact, you have already fallen victim to his powers previously."
“You know-,” Harry started before getting cut off by loud banging music and people yelling.
“Oh, just shut up and kiss me already you mumbling nuisance, I’ve been waiting way too long for this.”
Harry turned around at the sound of the voice and wasn’t surprised to see Blaise there, a grin taking up half of his face, teeth shimmering in the hot sun, and his sword hanging threateningly from his belt.
“Wow,” Harry muttered, his voice still raw.
“Well for starters,” another voice came from behind Pansy and Blaise. “he could get you lot out of the doorway.”
Harry would always accept, letting the bolt run through his veins and letting it curl around his body in twists and turns, careful to avoid shredding his clothing, gentle and oh so powerful. Infinite power as far as Harry could feel, his eyesight growing white, a sign that his eyes had taken on the same colour.
“I don’t have one,” Harry eventually lied in a small voice. Names were precious and he wasn’t ready to give away his just yet.
“The rest of the crew will be here soon, so you can serve the food,” Eduardo said.
“Harry! Mate!” Ron came running towards them, breaking Neville off in the middle of his sentence. “Welcome back to the world of the living I should say!”
Once Ron had unfolded the gangway, ready for the pirates to get onto land, Harry heard Luna call out for Harry. She came running for him, bolting past everyone in a hurry.
Harry’s content smile turned sad as he thought of Lily Potter, the only person who he’d ever seen as a true mother, how he missed her.
Harry smiled slightly at Ron’s rambling, the guy didn’t seem so bad, certainly not what Harry had expected pirates to be like.
"Ah boy, it's no problem, soy Eduardo, the cook here, and you must be Harry," the man said, his smile genuine and never faltering.
to work on, but-”
The first and last time.
“We have to go,” the Captain said. Harry suddenly wanted the cold on the Captain’s face to disappear.
, I think we’ll be fine.”
The Captains face visibly
Blaise turned around and walked back through the crowd, clearly expecting Harry to follow, which, since he was rather interested in answers himself, he did.
There was a ship with its gangway out in the open, ready to be walked on, ready for people to enter the ship.
“You can also stay hidden there if you want. I myself always fancy some hide and seek.” She walked towards him, her feet barely touching the ground, and crouched in front of the barrel. “You’re quite the special one, aren’t you? My name is Luna by the way, even though everyone aboard this ship calls me Loony.” A small smile graced her lips at the mention of her nickname. “What’s yours?”
Luna didn’t answer, instead someone else spoke up, “First of all it’s not ‘this ship’, it’s the Amortentia, and second of all you can always just get off at the next harbour when we stop.”
The Captain’s face froze at the use of his first name and he slowly leveled a stare at Harry. His eyes were so full of disdain that it was obvious that Harry had made a mistake. “No.” And with that the Captain left the cabin, leaving Harry to stare at the door to wonder about what had just happened.
Luna came walking onto the quarterdeck, two little knives dangling on either sides of her belt paired with a long engraved sword on her back.
His legs moved automatically, jumping over obstacles and running through crowded pathways.
Harry’s eyes flew open as his thoughts seemed to return. The brightness of the sunrise was
-Amber
The air was filled with the smell of tomato and herbs, making Harry's empty stomach rumble, reminding him that he hadn't eaten in a full twenty-four hours.
He felt bewildered and his eyes scanned his surroundings in a panicked frenzy.
As Harry looked at where the tall man had disappeared, he saw that the skies had grown dark, despite it being afternoon.
“To what Nigel?” Harry asked, urging the boy to get to the point.
"Oh Loony, would you please stop that, he's not a bloody toy you know," the Captain hissed at her, but even though his tone was sharp and sarcastic, his eyes looked different from when he'd seen Harry before, his eyes held a certain glint of wonder in them, while looking at Harry, as if seeing something that he’d never expected to see. "So," the captain continued, still looking straight at Harry. "Our Em turns out to be the one and only Potter, how fascinating."
Immediately a grumbling noise came from behind the door, the voice unmistakably the Captain's. "Blaise I swear to--" The Captain's words trailed off as he saw Harry standing there, his eyes growing wider. "You're awake." The statement sounded like a breath, the volume barely above a whisper.
Luna guided Harry up the stairs, his eyes still wide from shock. It was only when he reached the top of the stairs that he noticed that the ship had long been set into movement, swaying on the endless Mediterranean sea.
Enjoy the chapter !!
Have a great day/night!
“Come in to my humble workplace Potter,” Pansy continued when she stepped inside, she casually lit a torch hanging on the wall, yet careful to stop the flame from burning the ship down. Harry walked inside, the smell of herbs immediately hitting him.
“Isn’t it beautiful?” Eduardo asked from his left side. “Your first time experiencing the land in sight moment is always the best.”
Harry did just that as he leaned forward, the thought of tasting random food handed to you by a stranger being somewhat dangerous not even crossing his mind. His senses were overwhelmed as soon as his lips touched the soup, the soft taste of the tomato combined with the sharp taste of the herbs made for an amazing experience on his taste buds. "It's good!" Harry said excitedly as he finished the spoon that Eduardo had given him.
“Oi!” The man yelled from across the packed square, breaking their tension filled stare.
come easily to him, of that Harry was convinced.
“Okay,” Ron started as soon as Harry arrived. “we need to give you some kind of job here aboard the ship, Captain’s orders.”
The city unfolded around him as he heard Spanish being yelled from his left and right. The streets covered in an orange hue as he tried to find his way to the center.
will have a lot to say about it.”
“Mhm,” Ron said, gaze still incredulous and pinned on Harry. “right. Totally. The next thing you know, we’re all dating Slytherins and I’ll be dating Parkinson.”
They sung and danced until their feet hurt and their throats were sore. Harry felt free for the first time in a really long time, his hand still tightly held by Dorian. The way Dorian smiled: soft and full of wonder made Harry’s heart soar and even though he couldn’t quite place if it was because of the warm energy of the evening, because of the hand in his or maybe even both: Harry felt happy.
The question went unanswered, the thundering of the storm easily overpowering the meak sound of Blaise's voice.
Blaise threw him a sword, and Harry barely caught it in time, the hilt scraping his shoulder. “Yes, don’t use your powers,” Blaise said, the grin still plastered on his face.
The world around Harry had grown very quiet apart from the buzz in his ears, but he was used to it, it was home, the only real home he would always have.
“Finally looking for the infirmary huh?” It was Pansy, sounding rather annoyed. Harry began to think that that just came natural for her.
Eduardo showed him how to do simple cooking tasks and made him cut and stack the vegetables, before telling Harry to throw them into a large pot. The kitchen was hot: steam coming from the pans, combined with the pressing warmth from outside; the temperature was almost unbearable, sweat beading on Harry’s forehead as he was cutting what seemed like his hundredth batch of vegetables.
Harry couldn’t believe what he was seeing.
It was only seconds after Ron had spoken that he felt a pair of pale arms wrap around him. “Em! We were so worried! You should’ve
Harry slowly stood up, not finding the power within himself to reply: his head was spinning, and his mind felt foggy. He didn’t understand what had happened, at all. Who was that man that kept showing up in his head?
Harry slowly moved from the edge of the forecastle deck and sniffed the air again, eager to find out where the smell was coming from. He slowly opened the hatch that led away from the forecastle deck to the main deck, then he walked down the stairs and onto the main deck. There were a lot of pirates there, running around and attending to their business, completely ignoring Harry as they went.
When they dropped off the soup bowl and bid their goodnight to Eduardo, Eduardo just winked and smiled at Harry before shooing the both of them out of the kitchen with a bunch of rushed Spanish curses.
The next hour was filled with Ron excitedly rambling about every part of the ship: showing Harry everything on board and talking with a fond tone to his voice about everyone that was present, laughing about the crazy adventures they’d been through.
“Look at my desk,” the Captain said, the inclination of a command in his voice. “What do you see?”
When he
Suddenly the fire inside of Harry flared again, almost swallowing him whole in his anger.
“Christ Potter, calm down. You almost knocked me off my feet,” Pansy said, stumbling backward with Harry’s sudden movement.
going to understand at some point. With that she turned around and left for the sleeping quarters, the ruffles of her blouse gently waving in the night’s breeze.
Shit.
Harry didn’t get a chance to touch the food during dinner, running around doing chores, not getting a moment of rest. The pirates around him were laughing but not necessarily at him in particular, just everything and everyone, taking the piss out of each other and even their beloved sea, enjoying the light topics of conversation that flowed seamlessly. Harry even found himself slightly smiling when Ron burned his hand on a piece of chicken, Neville laughing quietly next to him and Blaise rolling his eyes playfully muttering something that sounded suspiciously like 'Greedy bastard' under his breath.
Harry looked down at the hand with wide eyes, not sure what to do.
name you’ve managed to remember is the wrong one.”
Harry arched a brow in confusion and Eduardo took notice, his smile growing a bit wider. “You really don’t look like you want a pirate's company right now. If I may be so blunt, you kind of look like
“Because you won’t like it. Because you will never look at me the same. Because I’m scared.”
bail on you.” Zabini leaned in closer. “Maybe even a few threats were involved.”
“A golden line… ,” Harry murmured, mesmerised by the way the line moved.
trying, it’s just that nothing seems to work.”
Harry took a step closer to the Captain. "Riddle?"
Harry didn’t have time to answer as another voice suddenly joined the conversation, the voice was all too recognisable to his ears, even though he’d only ever heard it once before.
“Not you too!” Ron cried out.
Ginny ushered them both out the common room hastily and kept following them until they were well down to the great hall, before joining Neville as his date.
“Ehm Ed? I think you’re crushing him,” Ron said, softly, softer than Harry had ever heard him before.
“Mhm, yeah, the sorting hat really wanted to, said I could accomplish great things there. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I was actually placed there.”
name, right? Right?
“Right,” Harry said skeptically as they walked up the stairs to the forecastle deck.
Harry was so busy running
, quickly! They’re going to be here anytime now!”
“What you experienced,” a voice said, the crew splitting like the red sea to let the person who had spoken through. “was very much a near death experience.” Harry had expected that it had been the Captain speaking, but instead it was Blaise, his voice serious and dangerous in a way that Harry hadn’t heard from him before. “And contrary to popular belief: we
Inside it smelled of musk and wood, not at all damp like you'd expect from an enclosed space at sea. Currently they were walking in a narrow corridor - if you could even call it that - passing two doors before they headed into the third one. Behind the third door there was an office space: there was a big desk at the end of the room, a map sprawled out over the table, on the walls there were other maps all with different designs, next to that, there were also various tools that Harry didn't recognise, but looked like navigation equipment on the hard wooden desk.
is going to happen to me
"Thank you. Really." He started off simple.
"There's lots! My favorite one though is the one about how you were very brave and saved his life."
It was up to Harry now. To accept or reject the offer. Harry wanted to hoot with joy until he was breathless at the prospect of being loved by Draco,
Harry reached up on his tip toes, his fingers brushing the clasp protruding from the nook in the drywall. He gripped it best he could and yanked lower, bringing a trap door down with a rain of dust and debris. Goodness that place up there hadn't been used in years now. A ladder slid out from resting against the trapdoor and clanked to the floor. Harry had to take a moment to wipe his glasses, before he could see again. Once he adjusted the ladder, the raven made his way up into the attic, pulling his wand to send a Lumos up there.
Draco flushed some more and ran a hand through his hair, chewed on his lip:
"Thought so. Toss the cloak over the both of us and go, don't worry about the wards, the Invisibility cloak makes us invisible to detection."
When Potter opened his eyes again, his gaze was clear and steady.
The bond really was a bitch.
"Fuck off Potter." He snipped coldly, then clambered off the bed and disappeared into the bathroom.
Draco ended up in Azkaban anyways.
"Kreacher!" Draco shrieked at the top of his lungs while Harry screwed his eyes tightly and panted raggedly, casting his mind away from the debilitating pain. At least attempting to.
Slowly, the door opened, just barely. Barely enough for a silhouette of a person to squeeze through. It clicked shut.
Draco finally moved and pet Snowflake, a small jolt travelling through the both of them. Snowflake's demeanor changed as the bonding spell connected, he immediately curled tighter against Draco's palm petting him. He didn't squirm or protest when Draco picked him up to peer closer at his vest.
that Draco's part of the bond was untangled from Astoria's, it surged in a completely different direction, desperate and frantic—it rushed Harry, to snatch him and pull him in. Harry only had a split second to react as he opened his eyes and let go of Draco, cut off the connection between them and forced proximity into a wall. However as the bond had been flowing towards Harry—it slammed into the empty space and unsettled the air into rippling into a shockwave that flung Harry off his feet, straight into the wall behind him.
He couldn't bring himself to.
ourselves and play a game together." Pansy Parkinson had snapped one evening in the joint common room in their 8th year.
Oh. Harry stood up from his desk with furrowed brows and looked at Malfoy over Zach's shoulder. His heart froze for a moment when he realized that Malfoy looked panicked. Wide eyes, tremors going through his hands. Did...something happen again?
Then the bond activated and sort of forced them into opening up and interacting more, to make bearing it all easier, and Harry got more than his fair taste. He was addicted.
"What have we got today?" Ron inquired and sat down. Draco sounded disinterested—he always sounded disinterested, in everything around him:
"Anyhow, I suppose it's my turn then. Well, seeing as you've shared a memory that has me in it, it seems only fair for me to do the same. However Potter." His glare hardened. "You aren't allowed to crack even the tiniest of smiles, otherwise I'll..." Here he trailed off, and Harry really wanted to know where he'd take that threat.
It was a matter of whatever little dignity and pride he still held to himself after everything.
Ron patted his shoulder sympathetically, though he knew better than to say anything.
Harry checked:
He couldn't. Never again.
Draco hesitated, but Ron spared him the trouble:
"Damn my good manners." He muttered and gave in, much to Hermione's relief.
He couldn't believe they'd completely skipped talking to him and Tori about it and just went ahead and
After coming to a sufficient result, Harry shuffled until he could lay down comfortably, his arm still around Draco, and Draco's still around him.
Harry lifted his head to see what's up, and swallowed when Pansy stood over him, hands poised on her hips.
"No, no. Ron, I don't want—I don't want Draco to see me like this, c'mon."
They'd be out of the attic by tonight.
after the last incident.
dumb!
He'd thought something like this might eventually happen, things had been entirely too peaceful for far too long. A full month without
Malfoy didn't miss a beat:
. So much porn. Maybe it wasn't only porn on there, but most of what they ended up discovering was gay erotica.
Draco swallowed his heart and started slowly talking:
"Draco's a Veela." He finally broke the words across his tongue.
Once Draco forced himself to recover from the realization that he found a grown, adult Potter cute, he was able to fold his arms across his chest and arch an eyebrow at the other man. How the tables have turned. And it only took a decade and a war for it to happen. Weren't Gryffindors stubborn?
"Since my
Harry held up his hands in a calming manner, about a thousand bricks falling from his shoulders now that he'd managed to wake the blonde up:
"Yes."
"Wha—
he is your best friend." Potter deadpanned. "Besides, even if I were willing to tell you, I wouldn't do it for free, knowing the risk to my health." His eyes gleamed in the most conniving of ways.
to speak so cryptically—because he fell in love with Draco after they bonded, the bond was different in him, it was an actual marriage bond, while on Draco's end it was still just the same lust bond.
Harry shook his head:
He'd always been a creature of habit, he'd carefully plan and plot his every move, every word. He always had a plan and that had been good enough. It worked. It got him to where he wanted to be for the most part.
Draco, however, thought about his father,
Draco had stayed entirely silent, but his breathing shifted slowly to a shallow panting, that Harry wouldn't have exactly noticed if he hadn't been paying attention. The blonde was leaning ever so slightly into Harry's hands and the raven held his breath as he moved over Draco's biceps, pressing into the cramps there.
Draco threw his head back and laughed, but he still didn't roll off Harry.
"Please stay awake—" It was a panicked plea.
"We're going on a date next week." Ginny sighed dreamily. "When are you two going?" She asked Harry—who only then realized that he hadn't set any time with Draco.
Harry was astounded, when Malfoy managed a smile back, as if he completely trusted Harry, but his nerves eased at it all the same.
He stepped closer and realized the deep red piece of Auror uniform had been snagged on a branch and  torn, now just flapping about in the breeze.
to say the least.
"Er, sure."
This was it.
"Isn't there any other way?" He pleaded desperately, heartrate kicking up anew, as the full scope of the situation dawned upon him rapidly. Harry had to stay here. Forever. Draco would never see him again. Oh

Once Ron ended up dozing off too, Harry decided that he'd take his suffering somewhere else, and quietly snuck out of the compartment, making his way into Draco's.
he'd always fancied a more affable mood.
"Didn't we do this like...a few questions ago?" Harry mumbled, then shook his head. What did it matter. He'd never tire of telling Malfoy everything he liked about him anyways. Even if it was buried under a hundred false pretenses and faked indifference.
"Would I have invited you if I still cared about that?" His face was radiating honesty, he looked no more worse for the wear for saying it either.
was why Draco didn't allow the CMC agent called in to handle him, but he did let Harry close...
The bloody bed was too large—Honestly who needed beds this large—
Any doubt Harry felt boiling at that resounding verdict cooled away, melted, the longer he spent picking out emotions out of Draco's eyes. It was clear, now, there was nothing to obscure it, the adoration and warmth.
Lucius furrowed his brows:
By the time they were done putting Grimmauld back to mostly rights, it was already deep into the night and Harry was bleary with exhaustion. It almost didn't feel real, that he'd have to sleep in the same bed as Malfoy if he wanted to get any rest at all. He wasn't even sure how it would work.
"We're bonded." He finally managed to sputter at length.
let's just continue and get this over with Potter." Malfoy started then stopped—huffed—and deflected the subject.
finish that fight! I think I demonstrated pretty well what I have to say!"
Just as Harry opened his mouth to protest, Pansy continued, dismissing him completely:
Or maybe Harry was obsessing again and overthinking everything.
"Kreacher is surprised the Masters lasted this long." Kreacher shrugged, not looking penitent at all. "The bond is particularly strong between the two."
love? You know Hermione would have never done it on purpose.."
Harry blinked and shook himself bodily, letting the thoughts banish themselves.
"I know." Harry nodded solemnly—because he did. He'd spent the last three years of his education falling in love and pining for the same guy who never wanted to be in the same room with him, let alone something else.
"I'm Sam." The boy said, bowing his head a little in respect.
"Hello Malfoy, err, you seem surprised." Potter stuttered and scratched at the back of his neck.
They didn't really talk at all during the work, but Harry felt as though this silence was better than the one between them previously. It wasn't thick or awkward, it was just—there, neutral. Which was fine. Better even. Still cold and odd though.
He followed Draco to what would most certainly be his death.
"I'm sorry Harry, but in this case I don't think so. Their minds and magic, their
“I didn’t almost die,” Harry said, his voice quiet. It was true: he didn’t almost die: he had had a few vivid hallucinations, a slight panic attack and then he had fainted into the Captain’s arms. Nothing too close to death, unless you counted the people who had dragged him into the narrow alley, but they didn’t seem to want to kill him, they had wanted to kidnap him, just like so many others.
“Fine
Harry groaned as he slowly opened his eyes, looking straight into a freckled face.
. There were only two doors on either side of the main deck: one leading to the galleys and one leading to the stairs for both the forecastle deck and down onto the orlop deck, so logically Harry had no idea where exactly to go next.
It might not have been Harry’s most clever moment: running onto a ship, but he had already decided that he would hide here until he could be sure that the man really
“Yeah, I think I do… ,” Harry trailed off, not sure how to explain.
Luna, however, seemed unaffected as she moved to give the rope to a tall man, who immediately after he'd received the rope began climbing up towards the crow's nest that was seated on top of the main mast.
Have a great day/night!
At first glance he couldn’t see any, but upon a closer look he saw that rope was indeed stacked in a pile in one of the even darker corners of the ship.
Eduardo quickly let Harry go while shoving a packet of food and some coins into his hands. Harry smiled softly at him as a sign of thanks.
Blaise grinned, his white teeth shining like a shark's when he'd just spotted his prey. "I was just about to say the same thing, Draco."
“You’re truly overreacting Ron,” Hermione said from his left. “It’s a masquerade ball, Harry may not even recognise them
insecure about showing his scars, - the people aboard all already knew who he was, it was impossible to miss with the light show he’d given yesterday - but still, he couldn’t help but feel terribly bad about it, sweat beading on his forehead.
“Are you sure that I’m the right person?” Harry asked, still confused, but slightly relieved that Zabini hadn’t, in fact, meant to ask him. Who in Slytherin could be in their right mind to want to ask Harry? They all hated him. Who could it possibly be? Parkinson? Bulstrode? A shudder went through him as he briefly considered Goyle to be an option. Maybe it was someone from a lower year?
Eduardo dropped his wooden spoon into the pot of soup. “Finally!
Neville’s excited yell sounded from above, the sound of his voice so strong that it was even heard in the galley. “Land in sight! Land in sight!”
Ron grinned. “Well just put some clothes on and meet me on the main deck, we have loads to do today.”
Nigel began to shake his head frantically. “No,” he said. “No, he was asking for someone else, Blaise said that the person was too afraid to ask you themselves, he also said that you would find out who it was on the night of the Yule ball, if you accept that is.” He seemed to think things over in his head, as if checking that he said everything that Zabini had told him to say.
side and enough distance would remain between them.
“No, I think he was about to maybe, about why he was tracking Riddle, but Neville cut him off.”
Harry could feel it before the lightning reached for him, the buzz in his ears, the sheer exhilaration pumping through his veins.
Zabini turned to face Malfoy and smiled a seemingly innocent smile. In how many ways could the bastard possibly smile? And why did they all somehow seem cunning?
Harry gulped and looked between Neville and Pansy panicked. “Four days?! Are you sure?” It seemed unnatural for someone to be knocked out for four days, especially if, physically - like with Harry - there was nothing wrong.
“There you go,” Pansy said rather indifferently once his shirt was tossed on the floor.
Harry walked among the buildings, he made sure that his sleeves covered his scars before he left the ship, he couldn’t have the cycle of someone seeing his true self repeating again. It would be too dangerous. Harry kept mostly to the busiest streets, going into narrow deserted alleyways was a recipe for disaster, especially if you were him and a simple shove of his sleeve could cause him to be in grave danger.
Harry was confused, that was his name wasn’t it? He had been called plenty of names before but this was his
So, as always, what did you think? I just finished planning the entire plot, so that probably means I'm going to continue writing this?? It's really strange because mentally I'm already at the end of the story but I still have to write practically all the JUICY stuff (because trust me: there WILL be juicy stuff).
Another glare from Ron. “Thanks Harry really, I hope you get eaten by your Slytherin date.”
"Blaise, I swear to the heavens, I will gut you if--" The lanky blonde haired man, that had answered this Blaise person, also stopped mid-sentence as he saw Harry standing there, frozen to the spot.
“I haven’t been able to sleep for a while now, yesterday was the first time I slept in forever,” Harry said, as he let out a soft yawn, knowing that if he would try to go to bed now he would just be stuck with his thoughts all over again.
Harry shrugged and took another tentative step closer. “I just really
The places where the lighting hit the waves kept coming closer to the ship, trying to reach their target.
Harry slowly rolled his sleeves up, revealing the purplish scars running up and down on both of his arms, and even though he couldn’t see them he knew that the scars also ran over his back and neck, making him immediately recognisable. They looked as if Harry had been struck by lightning, forks reaching over his skin, forming curious patterns.
“Ouch Eduardo! English idiotas?! That really hurt,” Pansy said, walking by with faux hurt written all over her face.
“Will do,” Harry answered laughing. “I hope that you will give your date much comfort tonight.”
Until suddenly he remembered again: “I am Harry Potter.”
“Right,” Harry said, still confused as to why Nigel was telling him this.
Harry softly padded out of the sleeping quarters and left for the quarterdeck, realising only as he stepped onto it that someone was already there: rays of starlight hit the person’s light hair, reflecting it, making the person almost seem as if they had a halo surrounding their head. It was beautiful, but it was also clearly the Captain, making it a slight problem.
Harry knew he had struck a nerve when the Captain eventually replied, his eyes shifting from Harry back to the night sky. “No.” The word was direct, making it clear that this was an out of the question topic for him.
The man behind Zabini really was breathtaking, even though his mask allowed Harry to see practically nothing of his face, the mask still perfectly carved out the man’s high cheekbones and piercing grey eyes that Harry seemed to recognise vaguely but not enough to properly place. The man was also tall and lythe, pretty in an almost feminine way.
When Harry didn’t answer, she
"Yes, Pansy said I had to talk to you about… everything."
Before he could properly register it, Eduardo had already dragged him out of the galley onto the ship’s main deck. Surprisingly about half of the crew were gathered there intently staring at the ocean. Blaise, the Captain and Luna were all on the sterncastle deck where Blaise was steering, the Captain was talking to him in a rushed manner, while Luna stood there almost ominously staring at the horizon.
“Potter listen, this really isn’t my story to tell, and even if it’s true that I could, that doesn’t mean that I should. Please talk to Draco about this matter.”
know though: it all happened because of his stupid scars.
Suddenly a shadow moved through the stark light.
Harry wanted to scream out in frustration.
When the Captain’s reply came it was cold. “You get used to it.”
hadn’t lost the man, so, Harry picked up his speed again and took a left, running along the seaside, his feet hitting the paved road harshly. A small voice in his head reminded him that the docks would stop at some point, it wouldn’t lead him anywhere, it was a dead end, but Harry didn’t listen, desperate to get away.
Harry recognized the voice that had spoken, it was the first voice he had heard on the ship, and apparently it was the voice of the ship's Captain.
Harry nodded and rose from his spot slowly, taking the empty soup bowl with him.
The wood started folding in on itself, revealing a gap with a big hollow space behind it, the gap was so big that two people could easily fit through at the same time.
"Ah Loony, finally, give the rope to--" A dark boy had been talking but stopped mid-sentence when he saw Harry, his eyes growing wide from surprise.
Harry opened his mouth, but his mind was empty: no letters or words forming in his head and the more he tried to think of his name the emptier his head seemed to get.
“Christ Pansy, leave the man alone, I know you’re the doctor on board, but do you really have to go all ‘health investigator’ on him?” Ron asked, glaring at Pansy. Harry couldn’t help but feel relieved at Ron’s interference, he didn’t know how exactly to explain him being underweight properly, plus his lack of sleep and he didn’t particularly feel like trying.
He softly grabbed the railing and he felt the Captain’s eyes on him for a second before they directed themselves back at the night sky. The sky was clear and stars were lit up, seemingly dancing their way through the night sky, like little lights lighting up the dark, flying high above them in wonder. Harry hadn’t seen stars like this before in his life: he had always lived in cities, hiding in deserted buildings or running under the prominent street lights that blocked out the stars above. To see stars so openly now was a true wonder and it would be a lie to say that he wasn’t in pure awe.
Ron seemed to barely hear her as he was still unflinchingly staring at Harry. His eyes locked on him with a stare of complete confusion. “I mean mate,” he eventually said, voice softer than before. “I managed to ask Lavender last minute, but if you want we can look for someone else for you to go with, I’m sure there’s
there, coming from above, seeping through the wooden planks that separated two floors of the ship. In the space Harry was in, he could see barrels, just like the one he’d hidden behind, stacked up against each other, all on their sides to be balanced.
“But you don’t anymore,” Neville said excitedly. “Come Harry, I’m sure everyone will be happy to finally see you again.” He grabbed Harry’s wrist and pulled him off the doctor’s bed and in the direction of the door.
Harry was just about to follow Eduardo to the kitchen when a hand suddenly grabbed his shirt. He turned to the person who the hand belonged to. A girl with short dark hair, piercing blue eyes and pale skin stood before him. “There you are! Why did no one immediately instruct
What he didn’t notice though, was that even though the streets might be busy, some people on the streets could often be seen staring at Harry, and with every street that he went into, there were more people on his trail, following him, almost seamlessly.
Harry lifted his brows in surprise. “You think that Ron is jealous?”
Harry knew all too well how his arms, front, back and even neck were covered in one big lightning trail. It was as if the lightning had used him as a conductor: gruesome purple forks covering his back, branching out over his shoulders and neck and from the shoulders reaching further down his front and arms.
Harry didn't know if the Captain would tell him everything that he wanted to know, but everyone on the ship had alluded to the Captain knowing more about Harry's encounter with the man on fire.
"Oh that, that is my famous tomato soup." Eduardo moved to a large steaming pan and stirred around in it, eventually taking out a spoon of soup. "Here," he said, pointing the spoon at Harry. "have a taste."
“Someone you know too well,” the stranger answered, sadness filling up the edges of his voice
She made no intention to move when Harry didn’t answer yet again, instead she remained in front of the barrel, patiently waiting.
“I slept?” Harry asked, genuinely confused. He hadn’t slept in ages, especially not in times like these, times when he wasn’t extremely exhausted.
And from the corner of his eye Harry could see the Captain studying the sunrise as if looking for answers.
The light was way too bright for Harry’s eyes, blinding him as soon as his eyes opened to a slit.
Ron put on a playful look. “No,” he said as he put the back of his hand in front of his forehead as a fake dramatic gesture of distress. “Please don’t, not the
Malfoy’s eyes grew a bit wider and then he said, as if he couldn’t help it, “Haven’t you heard Potter? Mean and bitter are my specialities.”
“The only thing you have to do to relieve the pain is kill that woman,” the first shadow said.
Harry smiled almost bitterly. “It’s fine Neville, maybe we’ll see eachother again, maybe we won’t, only time will tell.” It felt wrong to finish his time on the ship with such an open ending, but there really was no other way.
“Neville can wait,” Harry resolutely said, taking a step closer to the Captain.
(See the end of the chapter for
notice, it was already too late. The people were circling him, taking in more and more space beside Harry. Making him feel trapped, which ultimately, he was.
“Yeah,” Neville started “the Captain said, and I quote: ‘He might be supernatural, but he still has to work not to have his arse thrown off.’”
"Yeah sure!" Ron yelled back before turning to Harry. "Is it okay if I leave you here mate? I really have got to go, Blaise will kill me otherwise."
Pansy shrugged. “We’re pirates, we don’t play by the world’s rules of honor. We bend the rules to fit our standards, besides they shouldn’t have tried to invade our ship in the first place.”
Nigel ran towards him, out of breath and panting. “I ran all the way here from the dungeons,” he breathed.
Harry shied away from Luna's touch, remembering all too clearly what others had done to him after inspecting him like that.
The whole crew had gone ominously quiet now, Luna slowly retracting her arms from Harry. The pirates shot each other a few
“Come on, I’ll lead the way,” she said surprisingly cheerfully.
“You two are positively hopeless,” Ginny said as she saw Ron and Harry standing in front of an empty basket, that previously, had contained masks. “I just knew that you two idiots weren’t going to buy yourself some proper masks before they were all gone. It’s the bloody night right before the ball, and you only go looking
A breath, a burning city, one man slowly arose from the flames: the skin on his face was pale and his nose seemed to have burned off, leaving only two gaping holes in his face to breath through.
The pain in Harry’s scar got worse as the voice in his head deepened, getting more twisted.
Harry had been determined to see the sunrise and he wasn’t going to back out just because the Captain was here. Luckily, the Captain was standing on the very left of the quarterdeck looking in the direction where the sun was going to rise, meaning that Harry could just stand on the very
the desk?”
Neville took Harry to a room where beds were hammocks up on each other in rows, some were already in use by snoring pirates and other were still empty. He pointed Harry to one of the empty spots.
“Well,” Ron said, shrugging. “It could’ve been worse, we could’ve gone looking tomorrow night, five minutes before the ball.”
Harry smiled and gave a short nod, to which Ron replied by giving him a grin and leaving the forecastle deck in a hurry.
“He crept into my mind?!” The anger seemed to leak out of Harry’s voice. “He used me?!”
Eduardo had finally allowed Harry to sit down the moment that the Captain
The sun painted the sky in beautiful colours, the soft breeze circling around Harry, making the temperature pleasant even with all the clothes he was wearing. And even though he was stuck on a ship filled to the brim with
As they stood by the railing of the deck, looking over the sea, Harry noticed the figurehead that stood below the bowstrip: it was a golden woman, standing proudly with the scale of justice balanced in her hand, smiling as she seemed to weigh the amount of justice, the hand that was not holding the scale was wrapped around the front of the boat itself as if protecting the ship by means of the justice in her other hand.
“No idea,” Harry said, shrugging. “They haven’t shown.”
The rest of the crew, even the people he didn’t know that well, waved at him with some form of remorse on their faces. Harry couldn’t exactly pinpoint it but it almost was as if the crew had hoped for
Harry looked back at the map, this time analysing, instead of in awe. “Is it a tracking method then?”
“I suggest you talk to Draco about this,” she answered, her voice cold.
“Oh yeah, definitely, I know what it feels like.” Dorian seemed to frown underneath his mask, but made his frown dissolve before Harry could look at it for too long.
Lavender arched one perfectly tamed brow, all the while still ignoring Ron, who was groaning and plucking at his robes beside her. “Well they better hurry up then, you’ve got to dance soon.”
It was another night of Harry working for Eduardo and Eduardo as always was yelling ruthless commands at him. Tonight was the night that Harry was to eat with the rest of the crew and he didn’t know how to feel about that: eating with pirates did not seem like something he’d want to comply with, but then again, everyone on board except for Blaise or the Captain perhaps had been okay to him, not really barbaric in any way, so, he had decided that it couldn’t be any different from any other interactions that he might’ve had with the crew beforehand and to just go along and see where it would bring him. He was stuck on a ship with them anyways.
“Erm, yes? Isn’t that okay?” Harry asked.
The Captain shrugged. “I don’t know.”
“The man-The dream-Not again-I c-can’t-I don’t know-I don’t-”
“Do I really have to spell everything out for you? Yes Potter, it
see some things.”
Em, being so passionate about something that you want to fight to achieve it, that’s the art behind sword fighting, nothing more nothing less. You’ll learn to grasp that feeling sooner or later, today is just not that day and that’s fine.” Both her smile and voice were completely devoid of judgement, reflecting an utter confidence that Harry
The beginning music of a waltz slowly started up and people in the hall began stirring.
“Zabini told me that I would find out who you were tonight,” Harry said, smirking slightly as he leaned in closer to the stranger.
Ron nodded. “Sorry that we couldn’t tell you ourselves mate, it really was the Captain’s story to tell. It must be quite a shock to have that Riddle bastard suddenly in your bloody mind.”
He knew that he wouldn’t get a wink of sleep if he were to go to bed now or at any point of the night for that matter, sleep never
come in. His eyes scanned the room and rested on Harry as the Captain’s eyes narrowed. “So.” the Captain said. “look who finally came to eat with us, the one and only: Harry Potter.” The tone of the Captain had not been admiring in the slightest when he had spoken more sarcastic and cynical, as if he was rolling his eyes on the inside.
It was the man from his dream.
“Pirates?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Come,” she said as she started heading straight for the galleys.
. Not now. He didn’t have to look around to know that the man was following him close behind, pushing aside the same people that Harry had pushed just moments before.
“Okay so who wants to give our new mate a tour of the ship?!” Blaise yelled, waiting for an answer.
Ron seemed out of breath: he was red and panting. “Just a-just a-,” he started before following his not finished sentence up by laughing almost manically and throwing his hands up in the air.
Was he—there?
"But—"
Her smile faded, however, when she saw the Golden Trio behind him:
"What do you mean? Isn't it done already?"
"He means that in the name of professionalism and respect, we do not openly discuss that with anyone but the couple themselves. If the couple wants to discuss it with you, Mr.Malfoy, then they will do that."
"I wanted to at the very least be present when my fate was sealed."
but Pansy had a fucking point. Harry never thanked Malfoy for saving his life, Malfoy never did the same, they never apologized to each other for anything they did in their past years, they just ran away like bloody
"—desire for each other after some time passes from the bonding." Kreacher finished.
And that's exactly how it had played out.
Harry was a little pleased he'd managed to surprise the other, but ultimately, he meant it. He
"You like me, Potter?" Draco asked at length, voice suspiciously wobbly.
Harry knew the counter-spell.
"He showed me the severed heads of my parents."
things that loving someone came with.
She just didn't expect it to be that
Draco swallowed heavily and considered all this, tamping down on the onslaught of emotion threatening to overwhelm him. If Harry wasn't physically here, but he was alive, did that mean he could have ended up in some sort of different—dimension? Plane of existence? Did such things even bloody exist?
Harry was still confused.
As soon as the blonde stepped over the threshold however, the music...
This programme was going to be absolute shit and make his life so much worse than it already was.
"Of course, we wouldn't have turned to you if there had been a better way, but Harry, as you know, there aren't many people who would—"
"Yeah, really. The Hat wanted to sort me into Slytherin, buuut—" Harry trailed off with a lilt in his voice.
"Guess our plan's botched then, huh Pans?" He murmured, disheartened.
Harry gritted his teeth and took a few even breaths, and Ginny took over then, because if she hadn't, something would've exploded somewhere. She appeared equally as offended on Draco's behalf though:
And all Draco could do was
Kreacher wrought his tiny hands together and shook his head more insistently this time:
"That's how long it takes for the bond to accept the alteration of the ritual." Kreacher simply said.
"Right—What can I do?" Harry swallowed and cleared his head, mildly suspicious that Draco was letting this go that easily. It wasn't him like to let anything go easily. It was practically in his blood to complain.
"And what am I supposed to infer from that?" Draco arched an eyebrow. It was all well and good if it was just an offhand compliment, but Draco wasn't stupid. Things with them were far too loaded for offhanded
He had no idea what the bloody hell happened after it all.
"Still, you are going to have to gain some weight back mate." Ron piped up.
"I won't live with myself if you end up returned to Azkaban. I'm trying my best to prevent that from ever happening, it's why I butchered those people's memories Draco, but you can't go around busting arses, you have to work with me here. You know how precarious your situation is, don't give the Ministry reasons to think you're more dangerous than they already deem you." Harry concluded then dropped the washcloth off to the side once he'd wiped all the blood away. He let his fingers trail over the slash on the blonde's forehead, his touch just ghosting around the skin there, then he slowly moved his hand to inspect the nick on Draco's bottom lip. Harry didn't even realize how intimate his touch was, so clinically focused on making sure it wasn't particularly deep or damaging.
much to the girls' delight, he leaned back into his chair, resting against Draco's arm.

And when Draco pleaded with him to move, Harry did. He made love to Draco for so long, it felt like
Ron startled that Saturday as the line holding between Draco's flat and his own began to ring and tug.
Harry chuckled alongside Ron, and they left for work.
So hellbent was Harry on hiding his own feelings, in his conviction that Draco would never love him back that he completely missed or ignored all the stares Draco sent his way through class and meals. They didn't really sit together those times, just kept close.
Draco was silent for a few seconds, before he spoke so quietly that Harry almost missed it:
He lost a couple of minutes to it, when he heard footsteps approaching. It must be Harry finally arriving. After another moment the door opened and—it wasn't Harry. Of course it wasn't. It was Ron—Draco's new partner, after Harry die—after Harry left.
, I don't really want to...yknow...
sane, not around Malfoy anyways:
He pushed himself up with a slow wince and sat up, head still spinning a bit. He blinked a few times and his vision focused. Draco was by his side, staring at him with wide eyes and trembling lips.
Narcissa was kneeling next to Astoria while they inspected Ginny, Lucius seemed to have been blasted a few feet too, caught in part of the burst.
There was nothing Harry could do however, just so, he blacked out.
Was—Was Draco in pain like this as well?
The raven sighed and rolled his eyes, then sat up, bringing Draco up with him:
"I can?" Draco asked in a quiet, stricken voice that warmed Harry's very bones. He pressed in closer, tilting his head up.
It was only when Harry's feet were on solid ground again that the weight of the situation hit him in its grappling entirety. It was all well and good in theory back in Surrey, then up in the air, but another matter entirely when they were crouched behind a copse of trees and bushes on the Malfoy grounds, the house looming above them.
"But--"
"I'm busy tonight." Draco murmured. He considered placating Ron with a
the bastard
, there's got to be another way--" Malfoy tried one last feeble time. "I don't want you to die..." He admitted, voice tapering off into a whisper.
Indeed.
When the elf popped into the attic, Draco's eyes trailed over towards them.
Ron slapped him on the back far more forcefully than was strictly necessary and grinned wide at a bewildered Pansy:
be you." She told him.
Harry thought about it carefully before speaking:
"Come now, there's little need for petty lies between us now is there?" Harry laughed, low and comforting and Draco breathed deeply for a second.
Kreacher stared up at Harry, then dropped his head and acridly muttered:
Draco felt horrible, just looking at the heavy shackles, he couldn't
"I'd say my answer is about the same as yours."
Narcissa waited a few moments before she deigned to reply—she had thought her husband might take this approach and she would not have it.
"Hey, c'mon on, it's alright, don't cry now, it's your birthday, it's okay baby.."
When Draco arrived to work the next morning, he stopped dead in his tracks. Potter was standing...on a chair...with the rest of the department gathered around him and Weasley attempting to coax him down. But Potter shook Weasley off and cleared his throat:
He couldn't waste time now, timing was always imperative in cases like this one.
Think, think,
One was done, now just to finish off the woman.
"I have no
The doors to the room shut and locked, the wood shimmering. They heard someone bang on them from inside, then scream in pain.
Narcissa hesitated for a moment, considering this. All she'd said thus far was more or less general knowledge, nothing Sam wouldn't have found out if he just dug up old papers. The rest of the story however, it could be used. Against her, though nowadays that hardly mattered. Against her son, now that,
"You are not wrong."
Harry swallowed thickly. Ron
"Not by their own fault." Potter shrugged equally as casually, but there was something....
And that the lightning did.
“Oh! You’re here!” As Harry turned towards the voice he recognised the tall owner slightly, remembering how Luna had handed him the rope. “I’m Neville by the way,” the boy said. “Ron asked me if I could come get you.”
The Captain rolled his eyes. “Of course you see a desk Potter, but what is
"Sure," Harry answered.
Slowly she shifted her eyes from the shirt on the floor to Harry’s upper body, and as she murmured a soft ‘Save the Queen’ under her breath Harry knew that it wasn’t because he was so incredibly good-looking.
Harry kept very still, not moving and not knowing what to answer to that question.
After Harry had finished his bowl of soup he kept looking at the sky, enjoying the warmth on his face, thoughts swirling around in his mind, creating a storm of emotions: he’d done and felt a lot today, too much for Harry to truly comprehend.
Blaise looked at the way Harry had wrapped his fingers around the hilt of his newfound blade and his smile widened, covering practically half of his face in a toothy grin.
Lavender stared at him for a moment, as if measuring if he was taking the piss. “The opening dance? All the champions of the triwizard tournament have to open the dance with their partner by means of a waltz? Mcgonagall told us like three weeks ago.”
“May I?” Harry asked his date, in a perfect reenactment of what Mcgonagall had taught him, while extending his hand.
from him, somehow. It seemed slightly out of place for this many people to feel remorse over him taking his leave, but Harry brushed it off, it wasn’t important anymore.
Harry loosely clenched his fist and knocked decisively on the wooden door.
your arm, pretend like it has been there just as long as your lightning has. I know it’s hard, but please try.”
HI welcome back ! I'm going to continue this fic for a bit because i've planned and written ahead, I hope the people that actually enjoyed the last chapter (I appreciate you a LOT if you were one of them) also enjoy this one !
Harry didn’t like thinking about his past.
Harry felt rage flare within him. “Why do I have to ask the Captain? Why can’t
Ron’s mouth was still opened in offense until Harry nudged him with his elbow. “Yeah,” Ron said through gritted teeth. “Thanks Ginny.”
And as Harry looked down at the paved road with each stone that passed his eyesight seemed to grow darker, until eventually: the darkness was all that was left.
“Rule number one: never lower your sword before battle is over,” the Captain said, looking way too smug.
know that, right now, the lightning couldn’t do anything to help.
like you tonight, it got me thinking, maybe I like it when you’re not only mean and bitter to me. Maybe I like the vulnerable part of you.”
, his head was seemingly trying to split into two. Harry couldn’t help but crawl up into himself. What was happening? And why was it all happening so quickly after one another?
. He couldn’t stand the stealing and killing that pirates were notorious for and even though Harry hadn’t seen them doing any of those things, he still knew to be wary. Besides, Harry thought as he remembered Lily’s death, he couldn’t have these people undergo the same curse that everyone else that he had ever been around had been forced to suffer. He couldn’t drag them along in the game of cat and mouse that everyone seemed to want to play with him.
Harry softly took Dorian’s hand into his and as he sung along to the swelling music, Dorian wrapped his hand tightly around Harry’s as if trying to imprint the feeling into his mind.
Malfoy’s head snapped up to face Harry. “What?”
Naturally Harry followed him, he rushed past various dancing people who all shrieked when they were pushed aside in Harry’s run. “Sorry!” Harry yelled.
Harry quickly changed his clothes and walked out onto the main deck. Ron was not hard to spot, his red hair glowing in the light as he was animatedly talking to Neville.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t know,” Harry said, curious.
Harry stayed silent, his anger boiling inside; coiling in tight knots.
"Blaise," the Captain addressed the dark haired man yet again. "I believe it's time we set sail to Robards, don't you?"
Ron and Harry looked at each other at the same time, horrified, both immediately reaching for the same one of the two masks, as the laughter of Ginny and Hermione rang through the common room.
He sat up sharply, his senses suddenly alight and his breathing fast.
Luna nodded and diverted her glare to look back at the sea, she looked even more distracted than usual; her brows arched.
“To ask you to the Yule ball,” he eventually spilled out in one long breath.
Neville had already closed the door behind them and was rambling about where they’d be going next, seemingly in such a good mood that Harry didn’t have the heart to stop him. “We’ll be arriving at Robards soon, so you woke up just in time. Robards has this-”
“Riddle,” the Captain said bitterly.
Harry grasped his aching forehead as the exhaustion that always came with meeting the lightning set in. Lightly he rubbed his eyelids, and smiled contently, momentarily forgetting that he was on a ship in the middle of an ocean with people that he didn't know, but who definitely
Harry nodded and started placing plates on the table, putting the large pan in the middle. The exact moment Harry was done with the plates was when the first people started walking in.
“Yeah, I guess, still feels a bit weird though, doesn’t it? You leaving in such uncertainty?”
Harry smiled and nodded, happy that Eduardo had called him Harry in a normal manner, instead of by his full name in a tone filled with admiration. "What's that smell?" Harry asked after a moment of silence.
he was going.
“Did he now?” The stranger said leaning in closer to Harry as well.
“Wise man Potter coming up with yet another clever reply I see,” the Captain said. “You heard me.”
Neither of them had looked at each other for the whole duration of the conversation - if you could even call it that - but Harry didn’t mind this, he wasn’t ready for the Captain’s glaring intensity and he was far too enraptured with the stars to look at him himself. “I don’t think I could ever get used to it, not after living in the city and knowing what you miss out on by not seeing this.” Harry spoke softly as if he would chase the stars away if he spoke too loudly.
“Hey Eduardo,” Ron said. “Have you already met Harry?”
“He’s making it hurt isn’t he?”
“Why does it do that?” Harry asked as he pointed to the gap in the wooden wall, the same gap they’d just stepped through.
“Nigel?!” Harry questioned as he recognised the voice, he didn’t know a good reason for the boy to be so frantically looking for him, even better, he didn’t know
It made a strange kind of sense: the way Riddle had apparently crept into his mind before, creating the almost
“You hate me now don’t you?!” Malfoy asked, his voice choked up.
It was only when a man’s wide eyes got stuck on Harry’s arm, that Harry noticed that his sleeve was the tiniest bit rolled upward, revealing something that he had purposely hidden. Revealing something that betrayed him and everything that he was capable of.
and never
The Captain took a step closer, his hand twitching: as if wanting to reach out but not quite knowing how. “Yes,” he eventually said, in a soft voice. “He always tries to find your weakest spot: he
Before Harry could properly retort, Luna spoke up: her voice always soft, barely audible above a whisper, but oh so strangely powerful, demanding all attention, it was eerie really. “Oh, so that’s why you were so nervous today, now I get it!”
Harry and Ron shared an alarmed glance. “Well,” Ron said. “your Slytherin date better hurry indeed, otherwise we might have a problem.“
Harry wanted to angrily spit out ‘countries’ but before he could, he registered that there was something profoundly
Pansy gave him a look that would’ve launched a shiver over Harry’s spine if it wasn’t for how distraught he was.
Before they could think about it for much longer, someone yelled a loud, “Look!” And it was immediately clear what the person who had yelled had meant, because far below the horizon, in the distance, a large patch of land was to be seen. For now all that they could really see was a kind of blurred yellow spread of land but it was enough to send the crew into complete excitement and as Harry looked up he saw how Neville was changing the black pirate flag to that of a normal merchant’s ship.
The land was slowly getting closer and by the time Neville had fully descended from the crow’s nest they could already make out the buildings that were positioned near the coastline. As they started gaining in on the city the cheers of the crew started growing louder next to Harry. The excitement to set foot back on land was so apparent that Harry could practically taste it.
“I won’t, ever!” Harry said through gritted teeth, groaning as the pain grew by the second.
“Guys! We-” Ginny came barging through the door but stopped dead in her tracks when she spotted Ron. “Don’t you look just pretty Ronald!”
“As far as mystery dates go,” Harry could feel Lavender’s warm breath in his ear and saw the man’s eyes narrow slightly as this sight. “that’s not a bad one,” she finished as she went to stand at Ron’s side again.
Harry squinted, trying to properly look at the man without being blinded by the fire behind him. “Who are you?!”
Harry couldn’t help but let out a breathy laugh. “Yeah, definitely.”
The Captain spoke up thoughtfully, a hint of doubt to his voice. “I need to show you something.” He walked to the big desk at the back of the room. Harry followed him slowly; the anger still too present for him to properly focus on what the Captain had said.
“Right,” Harry said as he rubbed his eyes. “Thank you.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Thanks Ron, but really, it’s fine, I already said I would go.”
just tell me?”
When she let go, the first thing Harry saw was Blaise’s grinning face. “I think you’re going to see us sooner than you think, personally, I’m rather looking forward to it.”
Harry lowered his sword slightly in frustration, they’d been doing this for so long now. “I
“Yes Ronald,” Hermione hissed. “I think Harry made that fairly clear with the words: ‘I’m going to the Yule ball with a Slytherin.’” She pinched the bridge of her nose. “Now the rest of the school knows as well, congrats.”
Harry could practically
“So,” Nigel said, tone nervous, as if he was a messenger afraid to be killed. “What’s your answer?”
One thing he
Harry folded his sleeves back down, covering the scars again. He turned his stare back to the horizon, but now that he’d started thinking about his past, he couldn’t distract himself from his thoughts anymore.
The stranger rolled his eyes behind his mask. “Just call me Dorian then, we’ll see about my real name later.”
When Harry
“Don’t worry Em, you’ll be safe here. this is the sea, no one can trap you here.” Luna glanced at the infinite turquoise waters that were stretching out below the horizon. “At sea everyone is free,” she added with a smile, her gaze distant.
Blaise's serious demeanour had disappeared, now replaced by one of his signature toothy smirks. "I'm afraid you're on your own from here on out, just knock on the door and he'll probably let you in, I think."
was the Captain and only stopped when Harry and he were mere centimeters apart. “Come,” Blaise said. “I believe it’s time you and the Captain have a
Neville shrugged. “It’s just a house innit?”
real illusions. The way the fire had always circled around him in the dreams ominously: threatening and intimidating, too much of a threat to be real.
“Hi there! Like I said, you don’t need to be afraid… ,” she trailed of, seemingly thinking about something. “You don’t need to be afraid Em.” she smiled while saying the last word.
Without a second thought Harry bolted over the gangway straight onto the main deck of the large ship, he ran without thinking pulling open door after door and running down stairs until he couldn’t anymore, desperate to get away from the man who was trying to trap him.
“Oi mate! Over here!” Ron yelled as soon as he noticed Harry, waving frantically at him to come over.
Harry could see the man who had spoken now: tanned skin, dark glistening eyes and a playful smile on his lips.
“Who in the name of everything wicked left the gangway unfolded?!” A voice laced in a thick posh British accent sounded from above, immediately waking Harry’s fear once again.
“There was a man-” Harry looked around frantically as if looking for the man on fire. This was when he spotted his surroundings. “I’m here?”
