: you are one of the most intelligent people I know and the day I stop being in awe of your skills and knowledge of potions … will probably never come
: if you had a narrator who like tells your story while u live it, and you are the only one who hears them, would you rather the narrator sounds/talks like your mother or like pansy?
. It is probably my favourite fic ever, it's so. damn. funny. and it will make you fall in love with all these idots all over again.
: but that was more of a ‘wow we both miss cedric lets drown our sorrow together oh wow this did n o t  w o r k” kinda thing
I'll write a longer end note, but first of all, ENJOY THE CHAPTER. You deserve it after waiting *looks at the date* a billion years.
: Remus Lupin is much more than a werewolf, you know. And the fact that he’s a werewolf does not make him a lesser being.
can’t understand it, then it must be complete nonsense anyway. And if we can’t find a solution, we will simply apparate to the house of those muggle relatives of Harry, magical signature be damned.”
Dumbledore sighed, but he held his head high, meeting the werewolf’s stare. “It was the safest place for Harry. The blood wards –“
: So, Harry. Before we get to today’s topic, I would like to actually talk quickly about you, since your childhood is one of the reasons you are so interested in  the topic of the integration of muggleborns, am I correct?
He would die here. If he didn’t die from starvation or exhaustion, then Voldemort would step through one of these walls and would kill him with a single flip of his wand. He would never avenge Sirius death. He would never safe his friends. He would never see Ron again. Never see Hermione again. Would never again eat too much of Molly’s cake or correct Arthur’s assumptions over some stupid muggle toy.
The tall man nodded at the older wizard, his scowl becoming less prominent. “Albus. May I ask what was so utter important that I had to abandon my potion at a very sensitive stage of the brewing process?”
The man took a deep breath and let the wolf in him take over. It rumbled happily at being allowed to run during the day. Remus let the wolf run through the forest, faster than any human would be able to. It had taken him a long time, but he had finally accepted the wolf as part of himself instead of thinking of it as a disease he wished to burn out of his body. Not many people understood the relationship between a man and his wolf. They thought he was a completely ‘normal’ person who was simply overcome by violence once a month. But instead he could always feel the beast at the back of his mind. During the day and with the full moon still two weeks away, Remus had complete control over the wolf. He could use its instincts and and its strength, but he stayed human. It was a small compensation for loosing all of his humanity every single month.
: I …. Never thought I’d say this but thank MERLIN we are in a chat with the slyths instead of the huffs
There's only one new user name but it's super obvious so if you don't guess that, that's your personal problem.
: I read your business proposal and the first five monthly editions of the journal, and all of it is incredible
: there are two charming aurors and an official from Child Protection Service in my office for you and young Harry I belive
“Well, that was quick.”, she commented and countered her brother’s annoyed glare with a quick wink. “Mum wouldn’t tell me anything until you were there too, so let’s go. I just hope they finally found him!"
: can u believe our life was paused for like a year bc someone didn’t have their priorities straight????
His mother let her fingers slide through his hair soothingly, a habit she picked up whenever he was distressed and they were alone. Draco would never admit it to anyone, but he loved the feeling of her fingers caressing his head, smoothing out the worried lines on his forehead.
: im some kind of dog probs because u are way smarter than I am and so I think everything you do is amazing
: sounds like smth a rich person would tell a poor person to kame them keep quiet about the inequality of the system smh
: and then I learned that harry potter had almost died bc he thought he was the most qualified person in the castle to stop The Heist Of The Century
Remus kept silent, still focusing on Bellatrix. He had known about the wards around Malfoy Manor, thank you very much, and he had also known that he would trigger them. But he had been forced to get as close to the mansion as possible to search for any sign of Harry or at least the boy’s magical signature.
“It’s possible because he will accuse me of taking you from him. The Bond will recognize his anger at loosing his heir and will want to give him the chance of confronting me about it.”
, Harry repeated sarcastically. He tugged at his hair, leaving it in even more of a mess than its normal state. Just like his life. Find his mate? What the – why did stuff like this always happen to him?
I hope you liked this chapter as much as I do! I'll try to answer all comments I have left unanswered in the next two to three days, but I already read them all and I can't tell you all how happy they make me!!! And look at all the kudos, like when did this even happen????
Ron opened his mouth, no doubt to say something rather disrespectful without thinking it through. Luckily, Hermione spoke up faster.
Just… just tell him to hold on to Ms. Granger, yes? And for Merlin’s sake, stop forcing the boy to take Potions, you’re making both him and Severus miserable. Ron doesn’t even want to be an Auror anymore, though I’m not sure “Professional Memer Hell Yeah” is an acceptable alternative.
. Well, of course I think so. They do have a disadvantage. I didn’t know how to hold my wand – Ron, if you are listening, stop making that face immediately –
: (already omw to the kitchens getting some of That Good Stuff for mione so she forgets how awful we all truly are)
“It will slow us down, Mione. It’s bad enough that we can’t use any bloody magic, but if we start out without any muggle money as well…”
Ron nodded, his face set with determination. “We can pack a few things and be downstairs again in five minutes, Mum. Then we can floo to wherever Harry is right now.” He smiled at Hermione. “There’s no way we let that idiot out of our eyes for the rest of the summer.”
It went on and on. Harry screamed his anger at Snape for tormenting him for years, all because he reminded him of his father. He growled as he remembered the Ministry and how they either tried to control him or treated him like a criminal. He felt utter betrayal as he thought of the other students of Hogwarts, who were always quick to judge him, but took several years and Voldemort laughing at them to believe him. He wanted to punch Draco fucking Malfoy in his face for always making sure the whole school laughed at him. He even wanted to yell at Ron for abandoning him in fourth year.
: I already made a study plan, but I wanted to ask if you can give me any pointers on which topics in transfiguration will be most relevant
I'm SO sorry for the wait everyone, but this last week was really draining and I was not in the mood for comedy at all.
There are, and I am so sorry to say this, not many memes in this chapter. This has been very much inspired by my actual  workplace, and I started out wanting to write about Fudge and somehow made a wrong turn in the very beginning and went on a quest to Make Y'All Love Percy Weasely.
Your daughter truly is a delightful student to teach, and she will have every career path open to her after the finishes her last school year.
: yes but working as a mind healer has been forbidden between 1746 and 1985 bc many treatments rely on the use of legilimency and occlumency
The bird had come back in the morning. It didn’t seem to be afraid of the human sitting in the middle of the forest. It also appeared to be very busy, collecting all kinds of small branches and fallen leaves. Harry observed it, oddly reminded of his friend Hermione. She also appeared to be busy all the time, always researching something, having new ideas and running around. And she always had the need to solve every problem in the exact same moment it occurred.
I love all of your comments and I reply to all of them, so come talk to me! :D And I can't believe this fic has over 100 kudos, how is this my legacy.
They also reminded me of the fact that maybe I should explain how the fuck 15yo Harry somehow defeated Voldemort (and horcurxes exist in this AU - I know, I was surprised to). I had no plan for this, when I started this story, but I somehow came up with an explanation which (imo) makes actual sense. There will be references to what happened in the story, but I thought I would give you the whole explanation here in the notes, so the story makes more sense.
, like making brooms fly and letting food appear from seemingly thin air. But he had never thought about how magic itself looked like, or if it would even be possible to see it.
. Where he had stood not even a second ago was now only a smoking black patch of burned grass. The wolf growled and Remus threw himself into an apparition. He reappeared behind Rodolphus and managed to again avoid being hit by the other’s
The phoenix continued singing quietly as if he wanted to reassure Harry that he wasn’t alone. But he never looked at him directly, and Harry started to get an uneasy feeling about the whole situation. He wished he had a mirror to check on his appearance because he really didn’t
I’m actually ridiculously proud of that explanation and – not gonna lie – I think it’s hilarious that I managed to come up with it for something as stupid as a cracky chat fic which is basically 50% memes. But here we are ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
how is it that this is THE FIRST YEAR since Harry Potter started to attend the school with NO DISASTERS happening, and / t h i s // is the year we have decided that maybe, keeping the parents updated is a good idea?
I am afraid the esteemed members of the Wizengamot love nothing more than the sound of their own voice. I have adapted and am now using two quick-notes quills.
In the meantime, I would love you forever for any kudos and comments you want to leave here. You can also yell at me on
He knew that he should stand up, find a way to get to the Headquarters or the Burrow and tell everyone that he was fine. He should do so many things, but he was still so tired. The raven-haired wizard blinked lazily as he enjoyed the warm sunlight on his face and the clear air around him. He wasn’t even hungry or thirsty anymore. Did that mean he was dead?
The snake stopped in front of him, her head swaying slightly with what Harry recognized was her way to shake her head.
: kay so she just called me  a g a i n  and this is wild, she tracked him down and he’s just hanging out in this dirty bar making bets on flobberworm races
“I know, darling. And I’ve never been prouder of you than the day you entered my room and told me that you would never follow that madman. I would have followed you gladly, no matter which path you would have chosen. But now I will walk along, at your side and I will do so with my head held high.” She took a deep breath and raised her wand, leaving it directly in front of her face as if she was about to fight a duel. “And that is why I will do this, Draco, with joy in my heart. I don’t care about the consequences; I know this is the right thing to do.”
Dumbledore seemed to collect himself and stood up. Immediately the attention of the whole room was focused on him. He took a second to make sure that his voice would be strong instead of shaking with the uncertainty he was actually feeling.
: if only u were smart, good at potions, blond, sarcastic and a good quidditch player favorably a seeker
: and like if you don’t want to answer that’s fine and if it makes stuff awkward, just ignore it, okay? And it’s okay if you say no, because really, why would you say yes????
: what is his favourite food? I do hope he like treacle tart, because Harry is joining as well and I won’t deny him his favourite food
: harry I just got an invitation to a joint family dinner between us, the malfoys and the weasleys which we are supposedly hosting
As Mr. Seamus Finnigan’s Head of House, I am writing you in regards to his feedback for this school year. Hogwarts has decided to introduce this evaluation as a method to increase transparency of the education system and your son’s development.
: u trying to tell me that IF you WERE dating him already, u wouldn’t lose ur cool on the first fucking day and just propose to him like the loser u not so secretly are???
It could change, but it's more likely that if I end up having more ideas for this """verse""", I'll make this into a series. But who knows, anything can happen.
: during that time I got a valentine’s card and I KNEW it was a joke because who the fuck would ever actually like “snivellus”, right Black? But I had ZERO friends and I was desperate and I allowed myself to hope
: “sweetie I know you think ur kid has some kind of …. “talent” but compared to my scorpius he simply ain’t shit, Susan”
I’m sure Theo’s excellent development is very much thanks to your immeasurable efforts as both his teacher and his Head of House.
: I almost cried when I saw ur dress today sweetheart I will continue til the world knows I won at life
Apparating directly onto the small staircase that led to the front door of Grimmauld Place 12 was difficult on good days. Remus was not having a good day and he groaned in pain as he slammed down onto the stairs with a rather horrifying crunch of his bones. Breathing shakily for a few seconds he proceeded to ignore the blinding pain in his left leg and pushed himself up, raising his left arm to open the door. The first time he felt nothing but thin air between his fingers and the wizard had to lie down for a few more seconds to gather the strength to reach up again. On the second try he managed to grab the door knob and his breath turned into pained gasps as he used his whole body weight to turn the knob and open the door. The old door creaked as it opened and Remus dazedly thought that he had never heard something as beautiful as that sound.
I will probably continue to add fics to this verse. I love it too much to stop. But I also want to give myself the freedom to do that whenever I want, so they will all be individual fics instead of a multi-chapter fic.
: thanks! Obviously he loves books but when we met him and Harry it seemed as if he also likes music a lot?? Do you think he would like one of these music boxes which can play both wizarding and muggle music for christmas??
: and it got worse bc you dunked voldie into the shadow realm and now snape is weirdly laid back and I swear I saw him smile once which… no
: I give you pointers for Christmas presents for Sirius and Remus in exchange for pointers for Draco and Severus
The old wizard regarded Fawkes’ empty stand with a thoughtful frown, trying to match it to the explosion of magical power that he could still taste in the air. If even the Malfoy boy had sensed it at Severus’ home, it must have been even stronger than he had realized. Of course he had to consider the fact that as a pureblood, Mr. Malfoy was very sensible to magical power, but it was still rather disturbing.
damage was a Hufflepuff. His name was Hinggings, I think, and he is suspected to have broken into almost a million muggle households all over Britain. Obliviators hate him.
: I mean what if it doesn’t work out with you three and im stuck in the middle because obv I love you two but I have this weird hate-turned-into-respect-turned-into-feeling-weirdly-safe-and-kind-of-calm-and-at-home thing with snape and I don’t want to loose that but I don’t want to loose you either
: Wow sevvie when are you going to admit that you are too afraid to fuck up the chance with those two idiots to even try in the first place?!
Dumbledore gestured towards the back door of his office. Together they walked down the hidden staircase which led directly out of the castle. On their way down, the Headmaster explained the sudden wave of power being released freely into the world that he had felt before.
Harry had never considered himself a very powerful wizard. He was talented in Defense, yes, but that didn’t make him powerful. Some of his classmates were much quicker at learning new spells or at managing difficult and complex casting. Even when he had fought with Voldemort he had never really used
: Interesting. Can you give us an example of one of these things children of magical parents know, which muggleborn children are not aware of?
: do u want to meet up tmrrw and find a really aggressive tree and then convince it to donate some wood to me so I can make it into a broom??
: … the time u are taking to answer this tells me that you are way less chill about this than you are pretending to be
He turned towards Molly. “Molly, Arthur, I know this will be difficult for you as you both love Harry as if he was your own son. But it is absolutely necessary that neither your son Ron nor Miss Granger nor any other friend of Harry hears about this. They can’t know about him disappearing. Their worry and immediate search for their friend would alert Voldemort and we can’t risk that. Do you understand?”
“It must have been exceptionally powerful magic, if Draco could feel it all the way over the country at our home.”, said Snape slowly.
: there are some wizarding communities in like Germany, Norway etc were the classifications are less strict and they are further advanced in mind healing than Britain
Anyway. My internship is over, I'm back home, and I finally have time to open a fucking word doc outside of work. SO.
A sudden soft thrill made him look up and he gasped in surprise as he recognized the source of the noise. “Fawkes”, he whispered, staring at the phoenix in awe. He had always been impressed by the beautiful fire bird and it felt good to see someone familiar. He stood up, finally able to move with new energy. After satisfying its need for release, his blue magic had pulled itself deeper inside his mind, silently watching and always ready to help him.
Ok so it's been like... a year. And I'm seriously sorry for that. SO MUCH HAPPENED (I wrote my bachelor's thesis, graduated, been working like crazy, started my Master in Management, and so much more) and I basically had no energy left for anything creative.
Thank your for being patient with me, and for all your comments and kudos! As always, if you liked this chapter but don't know what to say, just leave a quick "Teachers Deserve Better tbh" and I'll know you liked it ;)
: but tbh i'm still freaking out about this like 5 min ago I was so ready to give this all up bc I wanted to be the Mature One, but now we are u know actually doing this and it's very overwhelming but I am ready to date the hell out of you like so, so ready
Floo Emergency Services. Works with every random fireplace (or just an Incendio to a stack of wood), no actual floo connection needed and the service is 24/7. Misuse is fined quite heavily.
She shook her head and lifted her hands. “I’m sorry, dears, but it’s not possible for you to visit Harry just yet. The poor boy is hidden in a safe house and is still recovering from his wounds.”
I hope you liked this chapter as well, srsly your comments and kudos are giving me life so pls keep them going thank you bye <3
I'm really happy I managed to post this while it's still monday... Exams are upon me and I'm kind of loosing control over my life a little bit. Two weeks of this mess and hopefully I'll come out of it alive.
: I bet the Huffs/Raven chat is just… wholesome memes. We are the problematic™ memes and shitposting
Also, have I mentioned that Fudge has been calling me by my first name lately? To appear nicer, I assume. Unfortunately, he thinks my first name is ‘Wes’.
: So correct me if I’m wrong, but all the mail you get is read by either Severus Snape, one of the most feared professors at Hogwarts and one of the best Potions Master in the world, Sirius Black, the only person who ever escaped Azkaban, and Remus Lupin. A werewolf.
: are u kidding?? I actually got a kiss on my cheek for introducing you to memes and making lucy’s life hell!
Madame LaBlanche, the pleasure is all mine. But, ehm, I am afraid there was a bit of a misunderstanding. I am the
He held a sigh inside of him, not letting it out. He wasn’t some kind of stupid schoolgirl, wasting away while waiting for his savior. His lips formed a cruel smile. Well, maybe he was a schoolgirl as he was indeed waiting for the world’s savior to stop being a fucking coward and come back.
Blue eyes met black ones as Dumbledore glanced at Snape. They were the only ones in the room to know about the prophecy, the only ones who knew that there was no chance of defeating Voldemort without Harry Potter.
: just…. I couldn’t keep up my pokerface, and then I wanted to just walk away quickly before I started laughing
The potion master took a sharp breath. He could hear the hidden fear behind Dumbledore’s words. He silently considered the meaning of this while they continued to search for any trace of the source of the magic. If another powerful Dark wizard or witch arose, the chances of the Light side winning the on-going war was becoming even smaller.
: u never heard this from me but snape REALLY likes compliments about how smart he is and stuff. Not about his appearance he gets defensive and closes off, but he knows he’s smart and he likes to hear it.
Next to him the grass shifted again, and then he could feel the snake coil up on his chest. She stared at him as if she expected him to suddenly jump up. He bit his lip and sighed.
Next chapter will probably be up on saturday because while this group chat is not actually cancelled, my sense of responsibility and common sense priority setting have been cancelled for quite some time now.
I feel like I'm gonna end up with a ton of headcanons bc of this fic and I will use them all in my Actual Fanfics.
: sending two toddlers in a raincoat and telling them to pretend to be harry potter has less potential of ending in a catastrophe tbh
Thank you for all your nice comments!! It's so funny how so many people say that 'this isn't what I came here for but I guess I'll stay' and they 'didn' know if I'd like this but I love it smh'. You are just as confused as me, I have no idea how I ended up here either! :D
: “no one else is allowed to talk shit about my family except my family and damn do we talk shit about each other”
, as no natural light could reach into the cell. The white light of his wand seemed to recoil from the darkness for a second, before it slowly started to reach into the corners of the small room.
: second of all I don't know if I am supposed to rebel against the casual possessiveness or be charmed by it
If you didn’t have a good breakfast, you should at least have a rich lunch, Percy. Please take care of yourself.
: u take every single emotion and yeet them at whoever youre talking to and break the dinner table in the process
Dumbledore nodded. He noticed that Snape called it ‘our home’, including Mr. Malfoy in his sentiment. Obviously the arrangement that had been made was expected to last.
: Well… it’s not like I knew that I was a wizard. I just thought weird things happened around me a lot.
: ok forth of all there’s nothing “””obscure””” about the usage of the predecessor potion to the original Pepper Up potion in the painting of magical portraits in the 17
The cell was small, measuring maybe four square meters. The walls were made from some rough kind of stone, but he couldn’t see the color, as it was completely dark inside his prison. It was cold, and the air was heavy around him. The only noise he could hear was his breath, his heartbeat, and the low hum of his own voice.
: When I was a student I was loud, obnoxious and in one case, a bully. Most of all, however, I was terrified. I was terrified of being sorted into Slytherin and I was terrified of being a Gryffindor. I was terrified of loosing my friends and I was terrified of going home for the holidays. I was terrified of becoming someone I was not, and I was terrified because I actually didn’t have a clue who I was in the first place.
: in third grade I had an argument with Lucius during the winter holidays and I lost my only friend for almost three months
He took a deep mental breath and surged back into the whirl of his power. The dark blue waves still waited for him, regarding him with new interest. Harry hesitated for a second before he tried to reach out to it. Around them the strings of brilliant green magic moved with new energy. Harry felt like taking a step forward into the the dark blue water in front of him. It seemed to tug at him and ask him for permission to do… something. To do what? The answer was laid down before his inner eyes and he stared at it for a second, hesitating again. The permission to be angry. To let himself feel all the injustice, the fury and the rage he had suppressed all these years. He could feel his magic wait patiently until he made his decision.
The snake swayed a little bit more strongly as if she was shaking her head. She was also laughing at him again. Harry wondered if he should feel a little bit offended by that but decided against it.
: I TOLD y’all that sev introduced my father to reality tv and also to those shitty singing and dancing competitions
: but it also feels a bit like taking a big breath of air after holding your breath for too long yk?
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR COMMENTS. I enjoy reading them so much, you wouldn't believe it. Keep them coming, folks. As usual, if you liked this but can't think of anything to say, just C&P "Percy Weasley for Minister 2020" and I'll know you liked it :D
EDIT: none of u little shits told me about that random kyle meme thrown in between the lines where it def didn't belong i trusted u i trusted all of you how DARE YOU
: He’s super nice and he knows so much about magical theory that both Severus and Sirius are lowkey terrified of him, so there’s that.
I'll answer all your awesome comments tomorrow, I promise!! Also the new ones on "There's a meme for that". Reading them all makes me super happy, so if you like this chapter but can't think of a comment copy&paste this: "Dragons just be like that sometimes" and I'll know you liked it! :D
Dumbledore interrupted him, shaking his head. “No, Mr. Malfoy, I’m afraid I can’t discuss this with you. But I am sure Severus will tell you everything he can after he’ll return.”
: I don’t even remember all the times you and ur funny little friends publically humiliated me, but if you think I’m falling for the same shit joke again you are fucking wrong
: I will be civil to you and the werewolf because I have come to genuinely care for Harry and I know you two are important to him but
: Not for a muggleborn! I thought potions were like cooking for the longest time! When you cook a meal, it often doesn’t matter in which order to put the ingredients into the pot. Or what kind of knife you use. You also don’t need to constantly clean the knife, because everything gets mixed up in the pot anyway. I was never taught all these things because – as you say – for someone who grew up with magic, or for someone who has a natural affinity to potions, these things are obvious. They weren’t obvious to me.
And he sobbed with rage as he thought of Voldemort. He didn’t deserve all this shit. He didn’t deserve being marked by a power-hungry madman at the age of one. He didn’t deserve being part of that stupid prophecy. How was it fair that he had to fight for his life every single year? How was it fair of adults to rely on him to safe the world? And how could nobody understand that he. didn’t. want. this. He didn’t want to be famous. He didn’t want to either be treated like a hero or treated like an outcast. He simply wanted to go to school and live his life like everyone else. And Harry felt so damn angry that everyone seemed to think it was their right to demand this of him. It was his own fucking life, and sometimes he just wanted to leave and never look back. Let them all solve their problems without him. If Dumbledore was so powerful and all-knowing, why couldn’t he kill Voldemort? Why couldn’t they find another hero, someone who fit their image of what he should be like.
: I was also told to tell you that there better be a theme because weddings without a theme tend to be a ‘melting pot of clashing colours’.
I'm still kind of in a daze because for some reason????? Germany didn't suck????? at the ESC???? so I can't think of anything witty to say in these notes. Also I just realized that this title kinda suggests that this story will only have 7 chapters but I assure you that there are more than enough memes for this to go on a bit longer.
“No. I’m sorry, but Harry needs to rest. He is safe and he is recovering, with the best healers by his side. I’m sure he would let you stay at his side the whole time – but right now it’s best for him to simply rest. You will see him when you all go back to Hogwarts, surely.”
Narcissa Malfoy stood close to the fire place, seeking out its heat in this unusually cold night. She wore a light, white night gown and a silver dressing gown above it. Without any make up and her hair falling loosely around her shoulders she was still a beautiful woman. She seemed to belong to a different kind of world, a world with balls that lasted long into the night, with the best food and the most important people of the country swarming around her. A world where they were still living at Malfoy Manor. But that wasn’t their world anymore and now Narcissa Malfoy was standing in this small living room, relying on an old friend to protect her and her son.
: fifteen minutes ago u tried to break up with me before we even started the relationship and now you are already killing me oh lord
Other people. How long had it been that he had seen another person, heard another voice? Harry didn’t remember. There was no way for him to tell how much time had passed since he’d been thrown into this hole. A few days? Weeks? He didn’t remember eating anything while being here, and his mouth was painfully dry because of the lack of water. How long could a human survive without water? Surely only a few days? So he couldn’t have been here for a very long time, could he? But maybe the Death Eaters had cast some kind of spell, which kept him alive even without any food.
: I know we made jokes about it before, but there is lterally no one here who wants to see you broken
The meeting with the prime minister took place last week Wednesday at 3pm. Unfortunately, your afternoon tea with Secretary Moncreaux took place at the same time, and therefore I met with the prime minister on my own. I’ve given you the protocol of the meeting on last Friday.
Harry Potter wasn’t the kind of person to hum. He actually found it quite annoying. But here in this silent, black hell, his own voice was the only thing keeping him sane.
: ok let me just say that I really like being ur friend too and I kinda wish I had given you that handshake back in 1
Really tho I had no idea this fic would involve so much plot. Where did it come from? Where does it go? Nobody knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (least of all me, tbh)
: u trying to tell me u were together with Harry „I’m not obsessed with him, Blaise, his hair is just so ugly it’s forcing me to stare at it the whole day“ Potter and u didn’t tell me?
: listen theo you might be my son and I love you but I will Actually Ground You Outside Without Books
Draco had hundreds of questions running through his mind but he kept silent as he watched his mother close her eyes. He could feel her gathering her magic and the fine hairs on his arms stood up when she opened her mouth.
: so then severus seemed to … pause for a moment, and then he stared at me and said “Sirius is a dog. Remus is a wolf” and then he looked quite horrified and whispered “I am a damn furry”
Any errors are my fault, you guys, there are no beta readers here and I'm way too tired to check for any mistakes.
: lisTEN if YOU grow up KNOWING you’ll probably be in moRTAL DanGER this year AGAIN because it hAPPEnS EveRY YeAR then you L E A R N some stuff
: Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard and they say he could be a 5.1 maybe 5.2, Volacipmert was probably at the same level
. How it wanted to raise him up in the sky and how it wanted to hurt the people who hurt him. His magic was part of himself, but it also had a will on its own. And slowly but surely Harry got the feeling that the blue part of his power was pissed off. It was angry at Voldemort and his Death Eaters, it was angry at the Dursleys, it was angry at Snape and it was angry at Dumbledore. Harry could see how it wanted to find those who had hurt him and hurt them back. It scared him. How could this angry power be part of himself? How could such… hatred be something he was supposed to trust?
So many questions and the chirping bird was only one of hundreds of noises surrounding Harry Potter. There were other animals disturbing the silence of the forest, and even the forest itself seemed to whisper whole stories with their rustling leaves and branches.
, he whispered. The thought of returning to reality, of facing all the problems and duties waiting for him, was scaring him. For the first time in many years he was completely calm. Giving up his rest seemed to be an impossible sacrifice.
I feel like this chap needs a warning bc here u are expecting some stupid chat fic with dumb memes and instead im gonna hit y’all with the feels train right into your faces.
: but I never told you that bc he’s still a Slytherin and he’ll get his revenge no matter how much he likes me
to answer the question: albus has agreed that the head of houses have to send an “end of term” feedback/evaluation to the parents.
: can you believe how many fangirls are thinking about just straight up AK’ing themselves right now?
Harry thought about closing his eyes, but he was afraid of loosing the light around him. After so many … weeks? … spent in complete darkness, the sunlight seemed to burn his eyes. Still he continued to stare into the sky, unable to believe that he was out of the cell. He wasn’t sure if he was dead or still alive. If he was alive he had no idea how he had escaped. If he was dead… well, at the moment it troubled him less than it probably should have. But after spending so much time in despair and praying for everything to end, he allowed himself to relax.
Your daughter is terrifyingly competent with hexes, and she’ll either be a professional Quidditch player or take over the world.
There are some new names here. They are pretty easy to recognize out so if u want to figure it out on your own just read the chapter. There’s a complete user name guide in the notes at the end of the chapter if you prefer knowing them beforehand.
: u never even killed him it was more like a lucky accident and in the end it was totally the void who killed voldeshit
: but with his furry problem and me still being under medical surveillance and no stable income we def won’t get it through before next summer
: its not like you have immense magical power and the most sway over public opinion out of anyone living in Great Britain right now
curse at the werewolf. However, before the curse could leap across the clearing to hit Remus, the air started to vibrate with a sudden energy, causing the red spell to simply fall apart mid-air. Everything froze as the three enemies felt the wave of magical power roll over them, leaving them breathless. But it wasn’t the sheer amount of power that caused the werewolf to forget the situation he was currently in. It was the familiarity of the magic that almost made him tear up. The human’s mind didn’t understand why it felt so familiar, but it still frantically tried to locate the source of the magic. The wolf however, howled excitedly as it recognized the sudden presence of the long missed pub. But he quickly grew agitated when he realized that the wave of magic was already fading without a trail to follow. The human and his wolf desperately tried to catch the scent of the painfully familiar magical signature again, and by doing so they forgot their surroundings for a second too long. A second Bellatrix Lestrange used to cast her favorite curse once again. This time, the curse hit its target.
Draco shook his head slightly. He couldn’t really explain how he had experienced that rush of power. He had felt powerful magic before. During his fifth year the Dark Lord had frequently lived at the Malfoy Manor and he still shuddered whenever he remembered the foul feeling of the madman’s magic. He could feel Dumbledore’s magic whenever the old man actually used it to do great things. But this… this had felt differently. He had not only felt the magic, he had
who wrote me a goddamn novel about her Shitty Week and I'm honestly floored that you chose me to share that with. I hope you like this chapter, sweetheart, and I hope you feel better <3
Your daughter is a delight and I’m sure she’ll make her way. She’s more in tune with magic than anyone else I know.
But honestly, I love the whole fic, and I am so incredibly happy to see that others love it just as much! So have fun with this one, and remember: time passes between and during chapters. They are talking about Christmas here, and the first chapter was maybe the day after the school year started :)
Harry suddenly wanted nothing more than to close his eyes and dream. He wanted to not have to make this decision. But then he remembered the cell and the fury he felt during the first days of his captivity. He remembered feeling helpless and suddenly he felt the overwhelming desire to never feel like that again.
: I’m pretty sure the centaurs filed a complaint about discrimination when the idea of hippogriff racing came up a few hundred years ago
: Well. This is of course something which has developed because of the unfortunate past of the house. It is proven, that Slytherins are more probable to turn to criminal activities. It’s in their nature.
Draco sat up straight at the mention of his father’s name. He glared at the letter in his mother’s hand and then looked at her worriedly. “You already read it?” he asked.
Excitedly they opened the door and were greeted by complete darkness and a foul smell. The Potter boy wouldn’t have had to relieve himself as he hadn’t eaten any food, and a spell made sure there was enough clean air for a human to survive, but it still stank terribly. Nevertheless the two men were grinning madly. Today was the day their Lord would finally kill the boy, and his reign over the wizarding world would finally begin. They had waited a very long time for this day.
Hermione shrugged. “I have some money with me. And although I still don’t like the idea, I suppose I could ask my parents to send me some money as well. Enough for two train tickets to London. Right now our biggest problem is the spell to hide our magical signature.” She stared at the book in utter betrayal. “I just don’t understand what they are talking about here. In one paragraph they mention a potion, and in the next one you are supposed to cast two spells at the same time and with the same wand! That doesn’t make any sense!"
: bc while I think my mother would give great advice and stuff, I would never be able to have sex ever again
The snake had to hiss rather loudly to win back the wizard’s attention, and the fast swaying motion of her head showed her annoyance.
: well, he tells her that he’s in the office and he tells me that he’s sick. So that’s a point for cheating. But he’s also really stupid and would have been caught months ago if he had an affair
Thank you all for your patience and your comments (I'll answer them tomorrow I swear)!! I still can't believe how many people enjoy this silly piece, and at the same time, I can't believe how emotionally invested I am in these characters.
: if my legacy is bullying the chosen one into educating himself so he can use his status to educate the public, then I’m fine with that
Harry groaned quietly. The words of the snake didn’t make any sense to him and he was far too tired to try and figure out the meaning behind them. As far as he knew he only had one pair of eyes and not even those were doing their job correctly. Though now that he was thinking about it – the Death Eaters had taken his glasses too. Without his wand and without being able to see clearly he had been truly helpless. But right now he could see everything crystal-clear… better than he had ever seen the world around him. Slowly he lifted his right arm and let his fingers slide over his face. No glasses. A sudden sense of invasion of his privacy shook his body. Someone or … something had changed his body! Of course he had never liked his poor eyesight, but he hated the thought that something had changed his body without his consent.
: I can distinguish every single person who might enable or hinder my path towards total domination by. their. footsteps. I know their habits. I know their secrets. I KNOW EVERYTHING
Today is/was a national holiday so I'm feeling better, and I will give you all a new chapter for all your kudos and comments and your support in general!!! So enjoy~~~
The green flames in the big fire place suddenly roared up, until they were easily at a man’s height. They only died down as the wizard which had appeared amidst them took a step forward, leaving the harmless fire. Severus Snape was scowling at nothing in particular as he shook the dust from his black robes. His hands were still clad in dragon-leather gloves and it was obvious that he had indeed been in the middle of brewing something.
I am quite ill and won’t be able to come into office before lunch. I trust you can attend the meetings in my stead.
: He has one of the strongest patronus I’ve ever seen. He loves teaching. He doesn’t care how clothes look like as long as they are soft and warm.
I really hope you all like this chapter cause I LOVED writing it and I got to introduce the teachers’ group chat and I’m so proud of Lucius’ user name so… yeah :D Lucius and Narcissa are giving me LIFE everyone.
Harry chuckled. The mental image of Snape walking through the forest and picking up flowers was the funniest thing he had thought of in… probably weeks. Then his face fell. If Dumbledore hadn’t found him even though they were in the same forest, then what was he supposed to do? He looked down on the snake, his brows furrowed as he tried to understand what was going on.
: wellllllll its amazing that u make it for him for free, severus and we are both really grateful!!!
Together they quickly ran down the narrow stairs and into the small living area of the Burrow. Instead of scolding them for running inside the house, Molly greeted them with an exhausted smile. She gestured for them to sit down and with a quick wave of her wand, three cups of hot chocolate hovered in front of each of them. They all took the cups but none of them drank any of the sweet smelling liquid. Anxiously they stared at the older witch.
: You grew up in the muggle world, right? That must have been difficult, knowing you are different from everyone else.
leave a comment below! If you can't think of anything but want to tell me that you liked it, post "Malfoys do it better". ;D
So the last few weeks I basically rotated between working, writing my last assignment for the semester and preparing for my internship abroad. By now I arrived at where I will live and work for the next two months and I am familiar with my flat and I met most of my colleagues and started working here, but it’s still A LOT and I haven’t really been on AO3 in like a month and I haven’t opened Word outside of work and I WAS BUSY YOU GUYS.
: well the important thing is that you never have to go back there and you can start leaving all those horrible memories behind you
Btw Draco sends a pic of his chat with Sev to the Group Chat. The "picture" is marked with simply "------" at the beginning and the end bc let's be real, I'm way too lazy to actually make a picture of a fake chat or smth like that.
: Boy-Who-Lived-To-Be-Powerful-Enough-To-Potentially-Betray-Us- So-Everyone- Better-Start-Hating-Him-Again
Harry stared at the snake, trying to fight the image of the Sorting Hat deciding which students were ‘stupid’ and should be send into the Forbidden Forest.
, he asked excitedly. He couldn’t wait to see his friends and tell them about all of this. Hermione would go crazy about the possibility to learn so much new stuff, and Ron would probably declare the whole thing “creepy and also kinda awesome”.
Dumbledore quickly threw some floo powder into the flames of his fire place and called out the name of his loyal friend’s home. He waited anxiously, but managed to hide his surprise as the green flames formed into blond hair instead of black one.
“Of course, Remus. I understand your need to search for Harry and I would never force you to betray yourself.”
: listen we could pretend we haven’t like watched each other for six and a half years ok but I know your fav colour is silver and ur fav food is caramel ice cream but u pretend it’s bertie botts beans bc for some reason u can smell which ones are good and which are horrible and u like to see ur friends suffer
Now excuse me while I am streaming the Idol MV by BTS and cry about loving myself bc damn it we all deserve to love ourselves <3
spell into the man’s chest. While it wasn’t the intended use of the spell, it did its work very effectively. Rodolphus was thrown off his feet and almost crashed into his wife several meters behind him.
as if he had been starved almost to death. He felt... healthy. Sure, he was still a little bit tired, but he didn’t feel as if he had been imprisoned for a long time. It freaked him out. Maybe his magic had healed him, just like it had corrected his eyesight? Or maybe he had died and was a ghost. A ghost with a really bad sense of self-conception.
I hope you like the way the story is going so far. Just to warn you, there are going to be quite a lot of POVs. If there are any questions, any suggestions or if you need to tell someone about that awesome sandwich you ate for lunch today - feel free to comment :)
: Thank you for these… insights. Ehm. So, looking back at your first year at Hogwarts, do you think muggleborns have a disadvantage compared to those children who grow up with magic?
Some general stuff: I will update every Monday (or at least I'll try). English is not my first language, so please excuse any mix-ups of American and British phrases. If you find any unintentional grammatical experiments - please tell me.
Harry thought about that for a little bit. He had been hurt badly, yes. But he had been hurt before, hadn’t he? So why was he still feeling like he was floating in the air, somewhere between taking his first breath and never breathing again? Why was this time so much more difficult?
: maybe im planning to move to the NORTH POLE where everything is freezing ANYWAY and then who needs a bloody freezing charm?!?!?# nOT ME
I don't even know if some of this will be funny to you. But I kind of love this chapter, because I got to play around a lot. There are a lot of new formats (emails, calls etc.) and I really enjoyed writing this :D
: ok so what do u think would win in a fight: a troll the size of a flobberworm or a flobberworm the size of a troll?
: you have to tell everyone three facts about urself: two are true and one is false. We have to guess which one is the lie
: u know that somber as shit slow ass nod u give someone when you meet their eyes during a funeral to convey the appropriate level of resepct and grief you (should) feel in that moment???
The werewolf continued to stare at the Malfoy Manor for a few minutes before turning away in disgust. The building stank of Dark magic – strong enough that he could still smell it miles away. Severus had told them about You-Know-Who staying there regularly, but he hadn’t expected the stench of his corrupted magic to reach so far. He gripped his wand tighter and turned his back to the mansion, walking deeper into the forest. Harry had been kept captive in the house for one and a half months, but Remus couldn’t feel any leftover trace of the boy’s magic. Of course Harry hadn’t had the chance to use his magic while being in the cell, and if Severus was correct then You-Know-Who still had Harry’s wand. But how could the boy have escaped without leaving any trace of magical signature?
. It’s the only fic I read this past month and it’s super cute and funny and it makes me want to watch the 3rd season of Queer Eye although the second season only came out like yesterday.
I hope all of you are healthy and safe, and if you are having a hard time with this Corona BS, I hope I made your day a bit better.
), but more importantly, 2. YOU NOTICED I FUCKED UP. Fucking Ron mentions Percy and Oliver being together in the Meme Fic Part 1 (honestly, how is this my life), and I forgot about that. I'll correct that at one point... soon... for now, just know that yes, Ron knows, and yes, he accidentally spilled the tea in the Gryff/Slyth chat, but he also somehow kept them all quiet. So yeah, thank you!!!
: mom asked him when he’ll bring home a gf or bf and he just sat there for like an hour and then whispered “I just really like dragons”
: Harry tried to improvise and change around steps of the instruction to be more efficient. When you cook something, that makes perfect sense.
: listen bro I know you have that thing™ with snape where he’s kinda disappointed you ended up being James’ son and not his own
I would still prefer receiving pictures of grandchildren with a few less teeth and claws, but at this point, I’ll take what I get.
: do we really need to learn by heart all the properties and antidotes to every single ingredient we every even heard of???
: The highest level is generally believed to be a 5 but it can be surpassed by wizards with “Lord status” (an outdated and not scientifically testable term imo)
: ive never seen batdad smile so openly than on this picture. Wait is there a picture of ur adoption,
: Nothing I could say would be as terrifying as what my wife had to say, so just be aware that I won’t hold her back.
: yesterday the smith tried talking to batdad outside class and snape just … y e e t e d himself out of the window
THANK YOU for all the comments and kudos!! I read all of the comments and reply to them so come and talk to me :D
Dumbledore’s voice was warm, but his eyes were set on the married couple with an intense focus. Molly simply sobbed into a big handkerchief her alarmed husband had handed her a few minutes ago, but Arthur Weasley met the Headmaster’s look. The red-haired wizard nodded slowly.
put up last summer??) and when we asked him how he did it, he just said that Dobby (the house elf, the one with the cookies) had taught him. Apparently, he can apparate at Hogwarts too. He thought everyone else thought it was impossible because they didn’t ask a house elf to teach them. As if it was possible for us mere mortals to learn to copy house elf magic!!! He didn’t think it was anything special, I believe his actual words were “What? Like, it’s hard?”
: lol dad literally said ‘don’t play with my heart like that’ and when I told him I’m serious he took out a pre-written list
: so we are all super tired and have back pains bc we all slept in the living room, but we are all also great
Draco shrugged, a gesture that was entirely undignified for a Malfoy. “It’s not the nightmares, if you worry about that. It’s… I can still feel it. The magic.” He shuddered but it wasn’t fear that he was feeling. It was a wild kind of joy as if he was waiting for something amazing and beautiful to happen. Which would have been less disturbing if he had any idea
. He felt silly just saying the word. Soulmates didn’t exist, the whole idea was stupid. Stupid enough to be send into the Forbidden Forest and left there to die.
The wolf led him deeper into the forest, around them more shadows than sunlight. He tried to find Harry, a part of his pack, his pub. The wolf could feel his human worrying about the pub and knew it was in danger, so there was nothing more important to him than finding the lost boy. But no matter for how many hours he ran, he couldn’t find any trace of his pub. There was no scent clinging on trees, no footprints on the earth and no sense of the boy’s magic lingering in the air. He growled in frustration as he felt his human take over the control of their shared body again. He hadn’t found his pub yet and didn’t want to interrupt his search. But he knew that his human could use magic as well and that he as well would try to find the pub. So the wolf stepped aside, lying down in the back of his human’s mind, waiting for his turn again.
: in every other aspect hes been very supportive of me, and he’s the only one who defended me when I came out
: 62% I guess, but don’t ever try to protect my  f e e l i n g s  again by not telling me something about my potions
He would never see Hagrid again. He would never again run through the corridors of Hogwarts, his home, and he would never again receive a stern look of Professor McGonagall for being late for class. He would never fly again. He would never see Remus again.
Am I obsessed with Queer Eye and has my English inner monologue adapted Jonathan Van Ness’ fabulous way of talking???
: Well. Ehm, Harry, first of all in the name of our team and all our listeners, it’s great to have you here.
: - or how to write with a quill. There are so many things children who grow up with magic just know because they experienced it every single day, but I didn’t have all that knowledge. And nothing really changed since then, you know, most muggleborn first years are still just as clueless as I was.
this has basically nothing to do with the plot of the series (I still can't beleive there's a plot), this is a stand alone oneshot but I was too lazy to create a new story.
: Well, but as a muggleborn that wouldn’t have made such a difference for you, would it? Why would muggleborns care about Slytherins?
My name is Percival Harrington, and I’ll be your host for the next two hours! Now, I’m sure you’ve all heard about the special topic we’ll talk about today. Or maybe you just don’t care, because all you care about it today’s guest! I wouldn’t fault you for that haha –
The breathing of the two men started to become erratic as they realized that they were the only ones inside the cell. There was no sign of the Potter boy ever being there. Panic clouded their minds as they turned towards each other. They knew that they wouldn’t survive delivering the news to the Dark Lord. It would have been foolish to attempt to flee from their Lord’s rage though, as it would simply lengthen their torture.
I live for you kudos and comments so please nurish this black void while I am waiting for the next BNHA episode. Having to wait for both anime and manga updates is a nood tbh.
: You are an incredible man, Severus, and you deserve everything. You deserve someone who loves you and your passion for potions, who loves your snark and can see the way you care so much about your students. Who honors the sacrifices you made during the last almost twenty years. And I understand if you don’t want to give me or Remus another chance, but I beg you to think about it once more. And if you choose to reject us, a decision we would respect, I just ask of you to reject our current selves, and not the stupid, ignorant school kids we were back then.
: “id be terrified by these people if they weren’t my family but they are so I guess their ability to murder you and make you disappear with no questions asked is… kinda cool?”
All the best, take care of yourself and remember to continue to collect things which make you smile.
“I must say that I am surprised by your… sensibility to that outburst of magic, whatever it really was. I felt it too, of course, but it was a sudden wave, quickly upon us and just as quickly gone.
But did I also manage to somehow finish the essay during my work and submit it an ENTIRE hour before the deadline??
“Well if we are already awake at such an awful hour, we might as well discuss the letter Lucius has sent to me this morning.” she said, her voice dangerously calm.
also #tbt the last chapters: harry smh agreed to do a live interview on the radio bc he's a disaster like that (happy late b-day to my son btw) and harry and draco smh think inviting the malfoys, the weasleys and harry's new fam into one place at the same time is A Good Plan.
: also various African wizarding tribes use a variation of the legilimency spell which doesn’t work with our wands and is really fascinating
Snape nodded, keeping his head high as they walked quickly towards the large forest. He had never shared the other’s fear of the creatures which lived hidden in the shadows of the trees, not even when he had still been a student himself. He was confident in his ability to defend himself, and had spent many nights wandering through the forest, collecting rare herbs for his potions. Except for full moon nights, of course. Those he spent behind locked doors, but that was nobody’s business. Snape couldn’t help but shiver as he entered the forest this evening, though, with the other wizard by his side. Somehow the forest seemed to hold his breath, as if every magical creature inhabiting it was waiting for a storm to come.
Lupin was still staring at Dumbledore. “How could you leave him at that terrible place anyway?! You knew all these years that they were treating him like dirt! So many times I offered to let Harry stay at my flat for the holidays…”. His voice broke at the end of the sentence and nobody dared to speak while they all waited for the answer of their leader.
: maybe he’s here to approve Harry’s adoption process?? You all know about that why are you making such a fuss???
Hermione found her voice first. She looked at Molly with wet eyes and the older witch felt a stab of pain as she was forced to lie to the girl or, well, young woman she considered her daughter. “Is he well? Where did you find him? I want – we want to see him!”
A blood red string came out of the tip of her wand when she said the last words of her Bond Oath and it slowly coiled around her wand arm. For a second it seemed to tighten almost painfully, but then it sunk into her skin, leaving behind a pattern of what looked like red vines on her skin. It would forever mark her as the breaker of her Marriage Bond to Lucius, but she would wear the signs with pride.
Anyway. I have this really bad habit where, when I haven't updated for quite a time, I ignore the fact that I have a profile on this site. I will still use AO3, but I can't stand even looking at my profile name, because I feel guilty for disappointing y'all. But now I have a chapter, so I allowed myself to look at your comments (WHICH I WILL ANSWER. EVERY SINGLE ONE.) and ... people. My people. The only reason I'm not crying is because I'm at Starbucks right now.
She shifted again, and this time she slid over his eyes, forcing the young wizard to close his eyes. Again he was surrounded by darkness, but this time he wasn’t alone. The heavy, warm weight on his eyes seemed to ground him, and Harry hummed contently as he allowed his body to relax again. Around him the noise of the forest seemed to soften until there were only mere whispers disturbing the silence.
: thinking about my uncle and my aunt spending ten years in azkaban for knowingly endangering a magical child
He had seen a sign of Harry and he would find a way to follow it. He didn’t need to spend a single other miserable night in these forests, and with that knowledge he threw the
: no YOu listen FATHER we both know a Good Fucking Tango when we see one so you better admit that maria has been CHEATED on, she should have fucking won and that hoe Lucien is a fucking fake ass talentless bitch like just bc Lucien sounds like Lucius and Maria has better hair than u you can't just disrespect the art of dancing like that!!!!!
: you went into a research marathon about something ridiculously obscure again and forgot to study for your actual classes didn’t you
Most of the Order members nodded, but some seemed to be rather discouraged. Moody spoke up, his gruff voice speaking out what many of them were thinking.
: why is there a video of you completely drunk, telling me that your name is “Oll-Olli-Oliiiiveeer” and you have a quidditch game tomorrow?
there are some new Huff and Claws characters here, because they kind of took over. If you want to know who's who before reading the chapter, look at the end notes :)
: we also have to write mcG and tell her how I will obviously take over the world WITH my quidditch career
Harry was tired. He had tried so damn hard to be the hero everyone expected him to be. He had lost so many people he had loved and now he was lying in a pitch black cell, waiting for his death. The young wizard couldn’t help but feel angry for a second, because why couldn’t anyone safe
: he often attac, he sometimes protec, but most importantly, he always thought Harry Potter is a snac
He sent a note at 8:15. Barely over twenty minutes, but I am a man of my word. I’ll transfer the galleons after lunch.
Harry felt slightly offended on behalf of the whole mankind, but he had to admit that the snake had a point. Nevertheless, he forced himself to ignore the remark and concentrate on the important matters.
My sense of responsibility has not yet returned meaning I have not opened my essay draft for my Eco Phil class but I am able to present you a second chapter.
: I only said he would snap, I didn’t say it was because Harry had already asked him out and he wanted everyone to know
: I’m saying every person is responsible for their own choices and the fact that a centuries old hat has decided an eleven years old student’s uniform should partially be green should not make that child evil in the eyes of society.
Listen, this is the last one of these damn letters I had to send, I saved Neville’s year for the end because I
Hello Mrs. Fudge, this is Percy Weasley speaking. Your husband has mailed me, saying that he won’t come into office before lunch as he feels quite sick. You mentioned that he’s left already, so I assume he has returned to you safely?
Hermione sighed and closed the book. “The Order members will find out about it immediately, you know that. And then they will know that we want to search for Harry. As if it is so surprising that we don’t trust them to find Harry without us – when did they ever manage to do something without us?” Her voice was bitter, the strain of worrying constantly for weeks obvious in her face.
Before he had the chance to even try to drag himself inside the house, a female voice suddenly cried out his name.
He could almost feel the impatient huff of the snake above him and convinced himself to at least try. He once again let himself drown in the blue and green waves that was his magic. The wizard surrounded himself with the pulsating power, trying to comprehend it. He felt a little bit silly, treating his own magic like another human, but it made his task easier. He could feel his magic perking up when it realized that it was the sole center of Harry’s attention. He almost gasped when he was suddenly swept away by its power. For a second he panicked – it felt like being held underwater by strong waves, with no way to get to the surface and take a breath. But then he felt a curious poking from the magic around him. Even while being completely surrounded by it, he could still breath freely. Harry calmed down and tried to open his mind towards his magic. The dark blue part of it seemed to calmly study him in return, while the green part jumped around him in excitement.
