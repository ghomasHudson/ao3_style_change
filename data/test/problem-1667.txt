The hat once more sorted him before even being put on Malfoy’s head. Draco, who had told his friends this would happen, snorted at their reactions.
"I know… our families have a history." he started, and Weasley’s glare came back "But it doesn’t mean we have to continue it."
His mother turned his way "It’s fine even if the hat place you in red." she smiled, but it was clearly forced.
"You know why!"
But she nodded so it was all good.
"What-"
"You left a bad impression on that kid. Oh, expect one time! He just wanted to be in the same house as his friend and already knew that was red even thought the boy hadn’t been sorted yet."
He had never met a person like Potter before either. His childhood friends all came from families like his own. Their parents were friends, and that’s how they met often enough to grow closer. They all had lots of things in common. The way they lived, the things they ate, the places they would go on holidays.
"You’re one of the reason he avoids that house."
"Potter, I’d like to talk to you in private."
Good son he was, Draco did as he was told. Wondering what was happening while taking off his pajama. Maybe it was just dreaming, but it was weird for it to be such a precise memory. Starting to dress up now. Yes but it was a recent memory, so that’s just, um… him processing the previous day? He vaguely remembered a conversation about dreams they once had with his godfather. About how they’re more than just short scenarios to help you pass the night, but in fact had a very precise use. Most of it escaped him. Looking at the mirror now to brush his hair.
"Maybe. But it would be funny!"
"Seriously, just leave, you’re stressing me out!" Weasley tried again.
"Am I… difficult to approach?" he asked out of nowhere.
In the boat, Draco looked at the stars one last time. He was so gonna teach Harry all that he knows about them! It will be fun!
The usual conversation didn’t sound as boring as before. This was good to have something familiar to go to when all went wrong.
They sent him off then, and as Draco advanced into the train passageway, he thought this had been the best morning so far. Even if he hadn’t eaten. He got to his friends, hearing familiar chatter. And sat down between Greg and Vince today as well.
"Wow, good luck making friends at Hogwarts. You’re gonna need it." he said, rolling his eyes.
"Alright…" Granger said slowly, looking at them all suspiciously "Whatever is going on here, just keep an eye for the toad, yes? And bring it back to Neville if you find it!"
The train was too loud for him to relax. He wasn’t sure anymore why he came here. All this just to get messy hair… great.
They waited with him at the station. Because Draco hadn’t been able to eat anything in the end, his mother asked an house-elf to prepare him a bigger packed lunch for later in the day.
Silence, for a moment.
He didn’t know how the next seven years would have gone without the time loop, he thought as they entered the castle, but he was glad now it had happened. Sure, it wasn’t an experience he wished on anybody, specially not on himself to live yet again, but… he’d made it!
If only Potter hadn’t rejected him. And for a Weasley, too! That was way too embarrassing, the memory of it made him squeeze his eyes shut and turn around in his bed like the pain he felt was physical. His muscles itched, heartbeat too fast, and bones shaking. Draco thought he would need to  crawl out of his body to be able to calm down. Which was a disturbing image.
Yes, today was the day. He’d go as far as to ask the idiot in marriage if needed!
"Madam Malkin’s shop" Draco supplied.
"Well, I’m bored." Draco decided to be honest "Also, Potter, we already met before! Was the ice cream good?"
"Alright, officer." Draco sighed.
"How rude!" said Granger to Longbottom, who nodded in agreement.
"Even yellow?" teased Pansy.
"Why? You’re Harry Potter."
"Ha… ha…"
He told his friend group that the hat wouldn’t even touch him before making his choice, making him the fastest first year to be sorted that day. Pansy laughed like he was being ridiculous. Blaise asked if he wanted to bet on it. And oh, of course Draco would! What an easy one to win!
Draco chuckled as he brushed his hair. Well, probably not, that would be going too far.
She crossed her arms now "Have you ever heard of treating others with decency? Neville was very worried! And I know how to have fun, thank you very much!"
Draco slid under his sheets. Whispers around him. Dark room. He sighed, almost scared to fall asleep. But it would be fine this time. Had to. This had lasted long enough and he wasn’t really upset anymore? Actually, he had quite a good day, all things considered! So he closed his eyes.
This couldn’t keep going on like this. A strong flow of embarrassment took Draco by surprise. He felt like he was about to cry, so he got up and left.
When he recognized Granger’s big puffy hair walking pass their door, he left the compartment.
"Ok… can you leave now?" asked the Weasley, rude as ever.
"… Guess not. We’re gonna make a weird group though."
"Right."
"Wow, way to brag! So sorry we’re not as rich as you!"
Potter had been raised by muggles. Which couldn’t have much more money than the Weasleys judged by how they chose to dress him. That had to be why, at least partially, the two of them had made buddy-buddy so fast.
"Have you seen a frog?" she asked.
"Hm-hm." came Draco’s reply.
"Yes, sir! Should you be red, then? As a treat? Since you can’t seem to be able to live without the Potter boy."
"I’d prefer green, to be with my friends. But honestly? I don’t care much anymore."
At least he could breath now.
They agreed with him and started talking about something else. Without asking Draco to leave! Oh, he was so gonna yell ‘ah! You see!’ to the hat tonight! That will teach him to believe in the students more!
The conductor’s cabin, uh? Trevor sure had an adventurous soul.
Draco sat down on the stool, ready for it to be done. But this time the hat actually fell on him. Uh?
The WORST day!
"Um, yeah." he finally replied.
"No worries, we’re good this time."
Draco heard her scoff as he turned his back to them, but it didn’t matter anymore. His first mission was done! Now, to the much tougher one to beat… actually, he was the one who needed all the luck in this moment!
"Funny. At least no one in my family cut people in the middle of a sentence." he said, and when Weasley opened his mouth in shock "It’s called having manners. You should try it."
"Like all your family, we know." Weasley rolled his eyes.
The boy sighed. "Nothing really. I just… want the sorting to be behind me and get to class already."
"Toad." Longbottom corrected behind her.
The mood got sour so fast. This time, though, Draco didn’t find it in him to blame Weasley for it. Because he was right. Ugh, it did pain him to acknowledge it! But not many had what his parents got for him. And even those who did couldn’t always use it right. So yes, Draco was lucky.
His father was proud no matter what.
"Jealous? Want the attention all to yourself then?" talking in this position felt weird, as Draco’s chin moved in his hand.
Weasley threw his hands up "Ugh! Fine, I won’t say anything! Or not much. But I don’t trust you, so… stay here."
"Of course."
"Draco." his father said, placing an hand on the boy’s shoulder. "Don’t forget to send us letters."
His mother voice woke him the next morning. She had to call a few times until he finally opened his eyes and stretched in bed. Something felt strange, and it took Draco a moment of looking around his room to figure out what the problem was.
"Duh!" almost yelled Pansy.
"Yeah, um…" he licked his lips "Sorry for what I said. About Hagrid."
He breathed to steady himself before opening the door with "Hello there! My name is Draco Malfoy."
Weasley coughed.
He huffed under the pressure his son’s tiny arms were capable of inflicting.
This time he ate his breakfast. Participated in the boring old conversation. Pretended to be excited for his first day. Hugged his parents at the station. Met his friends.
"Children…" his father said, sounding annoyed. But on the corner of his lips, just there, Draco caught the discreet smile.
… Or could it work? He was still musing about it while eating breakfast.
Familiar conversation went on. It was strange to know in advance what someone was about to say!
Draco smiled "Of course." he said, softly this time.
"How come?" asked Potter next to him.
So they had to wake him up when the train arrived at destination.
"Well!" he said standing up "I have better things to do! You two are boring."
Silence.
"… Yes?"
A murderous look was the reply. He quite liked when Wealey was silent for once.
"It’s true. Potter will be sorted in red."
They were all searching for air after a while and when the exhaustion got over them, they called it quit. For the night. Round two tomorrow!
Anger tainted Weasley’s face red. Draco didn’t find it funny anymore. Instead, he felt bad. Why was this part always going wrong!
"No, I..." started Draco.
"Toad!" she repeated. "Neville lost his toad."
His father looked at her in shock. Draco was conflicted. On one hand, he was glad they didn’t repeat the same boring conversation, and it was nice of his mother to reassure him even if she wasn’t aware of the real problem, but on the other hand… he had to side with his father repulsion on that one. No way he’s accept to be red! Yuck!
"This is gonna be our room for the next seven years." simply said Draco. As a fact. But also as a revelation.
"Really! Glad to know I’m a celebrity." he said before sitting down next to Potter.
Well, that was an embarrassing thing to admit. Should he lie? Not a big lie, just… make it sound less ridiculous. He was tempted. But something told him not being honest there could break all he worked so hard to create between them.
Draco got dressed again. Brushed his hair again. Ate with his parents again. But this time he barely reacted when they talked to him.
"Manners." his father reproached him.
Once that was done, he left them behind and walked back to Weasley and Potter’s door. Knocked first. To be polite. But didn’t wait for an invitation to enter. Let’s not exaggerate.
"I can’t stand that guy!" Weasley said, pointing in Draco’s direction.
The conversation continued on, greens staying in the reds compartment for most of the ride, no matter how many times Weasley tried to chase them away. Draco had a lot of questions to answer. Genuine ones, smart ones, usually coming from Blaise, and as time passed, more and more silly ones.
"Why?" Draco asked. "It’s literally the first time we met."
Ah, well. He did change enough things so it wouldn’t be too boring, at least. So could he complain, really…
But Draco was determined. So when Granger’s hair passed by the door’s window, he got up swiftly and rushed to her and Longbottom.
"Heard you ask around." he hoped would work with their schedule. If he said that before they had even started… well.
"Toad." Longbottom corrected behind her.
"I already lived today."
"WHAT?!" yelled Pansy, before she fell laughing over Blaise again.
Weasley was turning red already "You…!"
"Yeah." said Vince "With us you’re cool, but for everyone else you act mean."
Draco couldn’t wait. So he went to sleep.
"Do you plan on keeping the act up at school? Please say yes, it’ll be so funny!"
"This is brilliant!" said Vince, shaking from silent laughter.
Draco’s loop day was already a pain to go through, so he really didn’t want to imagine how it was like for the hat who didn’t even have legs to walk around.
Draco stayed with the two of them for a while more, almost scared that leaving would bring them back to case one. But it couldn’t, right? So, eventually, he excused himself to join his main group. Last quick promises to talk more at school and he left the compartment.
"If you don’t end this tomorrow I’ll make you red."
"Hope you’ll figure it out soon. Hey, if tomorrow isn’t actually tomorrow, let me sort you somewhere else, yeah? You’re not even opposed to blue, come on!"
But was it really sad? He wouldn’t call himself a fan of the predicament he was currently in. Draco really hoped that was the last do-over. Knowing everything that was about to happen, and everything people would say, really wasn’t as fun as some seemed to believe!
When Harry’s name was called, the room got silent, and the poor boy looked so scared by the reaction. He walked to the stool like he was about to be punished. Draco held his breath for a moment. Would the hat place him somewhere else? Since Harry had the possibilty of being green…
"Are they all gonna be greens?" asked Ron.
"I’m disappointed." said the hat in his head.
Draco stood up then. Looking at all their faces, one by one. "Follow me." he said before leaving.
He sighed. Looking around was the same scene. He remembered the families, where they were, the easy to guess dynamics, some of the conversations he overheard. It was so boring. Unless he did something, nothing will change then?
"Touching… well what about blue then! You never minded this one. Come on, say yes!"
"Uh, I do, actually!" Weasley spat.
"Toad!" she repeated. "Neville lost his toad."
"Shut up! And go away!"
Granger started explaining the ceiling and he tuned her out. Then his name was called and he rushed to sit on the stool.
"You’re needy!"
"Are you alright?" asked his mother before placing an hand on his forehead, checking his temperature.
What.
Both Harry and Ron laughed at that. Jackpot!
It had been the worst day, Draco thought in bed. Around him, excited whispers from the other students. Talking about the castle, the houses, and what class they were most looking forward to. The dorm room was dark but not so quiet. Everyone too happy to fall asleep just yet.
Draco crossed his arms and closed his eyes with a ‘hmph!’ in mock anger. He wasn’t mad at his friend for being honest, since he was the one who asked it. But Pansy made him think.
Draco couldn’t help but laugh at that. He had meant to tell him before, but thought of keeping that ammunition in case Weasley was getting more annoying later. Yet he couldn’t blame Granger of stealing his line, because the blush growing on Weasley’s face as he scrubbed his nose with his sleeve was a hoot. What a tragedy for a red head to grow the same shade as their hair!
"Talk about something they like?" was Vince’s idea.
Draco laughed. While he hadn’t meant for this all to happen… she knew him well. A Malfoy never gave up the opportunity to flaunt.
They separated at the lake, and found each other again in the castle.
Blaise smiled "Pansy..."
"Uh, well..." the boy started "I don’t know really, but red could be nice?"
"Stupid Weasley..." he murmured on the way back to his friend group.
"What’s with you?" asked Vince next to him with a curious tone. No trace of annoyance or real concern. He liked that about Vince.
Pansy laughed, of course. When does she not?
Draco chuckled aloud. "Tomorrow for sure. Otherwise I’ll run away or something." he thought.
"Hm..." was all he could answer, staring at his plate.
"It’s such a shame that first years aren’t allowed their own brooms..." Draco ignored the other boy.
"Excellent!" Wealey found his voice again. "We’ll be together!"
Feeling cheeky, he told them without stopping "I’m the one who kidnapped Trevor. Follow me if you want to see him alive."
Back to the dorm, though a different one, Draco sighed in the dark. Last time, come on!
The red head talked about candy and Potter’s face illuminated. A smile growing on his face as his friend listed his favorite sweets and what they were made of.
When it was time for departure, his mother brought him in a hug.
The boy greeted him with a nod. Everything was fine. He could do it.
Well. Not for him, but. Technically still.
"Ugh!" Draco paused, remembering how upsetting it all was "He’s befriending the last Weasley as we speak."
"I can confirm!" came Blaise’s voice "It’s the feeling you already went through a moment."
Draco joined in with a laugh and sudden energy. Finally he could be part of the good mood that night! He learned that the other boy’s name was Theodore. Never before had he cared enough to ask.
“The other option- the
Harry stood in place, absolutely furious. The rain running down his face and dampening his hair added an intensely dramatic effect. “You need to leave. Right fucking now.”
“Exactly.”
His father’s funeral was still fresh in his mind, even though it had been months since the event happened. It was something that would be fresh in his mind for a long while. The casket that held his father’s lifeless body burned into his brain, the smell of the lonely graveyard, the tears that ran down his mother’s face.
up for running. His stomach barely had any food in it, his injuries were still not fully healed, and he was severely out of shape. The first reason was sort of on him, and the second one he couldn't control, but the third reason was a good reason and there was a really good excuse. He
He was about to open his mouth and say whatever came to mind first, when his Mark sent a bolt of pain throughout his entire body. He had no choice but to grasp his arm tightly. He now felt it
Draco got up off the floor and made his way over to Harry. Whatever was bothering the Gryffindor, Draco wanted to fix it immediately.
He thought about her words and decided to head up to the library at some point to research more about it. “I guess it really is the only plausible explanation, though. Do you think that’s how I was able to create those images in my head, you know the one where I saw myself hugging my mum and dad, and standing in front of that mirror…” Of course, he didn’t tell her anything about Harry.
He thought perhaps Harry wasn’t able to hear him over the loud sounds of rain and thunder, but Harry did turn around that time. Draco was grinning, hoping for another snogging session, but Harry was most certainly not grinning. He had this look on his face, a look Draco couldn’t decipher. He looked, sad, almost, with maybe a tiny hint of anger and… disappointment. Draco wasn’t sure, though, Harry had never been this hard to read, he always wore his heart on his sleeve, which was one of the things Draco loved about him.
In all honesty, it was the least of their problems, so he decided not to add it onto his growing list of worries. If he came across the slide and wall again, maybe he would do something to fix it, but it truly seemed like a problem that could wait to be solved after everyone was awake.
Draco turned around and started to walk away, hearing Blaise tell Harry that they would
Theo had been the first boy he had ever kissed. It was during Sixth Year, at a time when Draco was lost in his darkest thoughts, mind cloudy and in a deep trance.
Once it was off, he could feel Harry’s fingers lightly touching him; whereas Draco had lustfully ran his hands across Harry’s chest, Harry did the complete opposite. Eventually, Draco just couldn’t look away anymore, and he found himself staring up at Harry who was admiring every uncovered inch of him. He was touching the Sectumsempra scars littering his torso, eyes glittering with unshed tears.
“I already got what I wanted,” Drys stated, a little too confidently. “Look around, my boy. I’ve accomplished what I’ve wanted to accomplish all along. Now, all I have to do is play a game of dueling, which is honestly going to be quite fun.” His eyes were full of so much hatred and pride. Draco wondered if his own eyes ever resembled anything close to Drys’s. He hoped not.
Drys rolled his eyes. “Alec was the one to make the fake. But it was my idea.”
She huffed, crossed her arms over her chest and said defensively, “You
“Malfoy? Are you awake?” Potter asked.
He also noticed that there was no warm presence by his side. He frowned and turned to his other side, waiting to catch his eyes on Harry’s sleeping body, when Harry also wasn’t lying on his other side. Harry was, however, standing up at the edge of the pavilion and looking out at the rain, no doubt getting drenched.
could be back?” The last part came out in a whisper.
“This is just all so surreal,” Draco murmured. “I mean, this year, this cursed year-- I would never have thought something like this could happen to a person like me. I always had Pansy, but you, Harry, you were different.”
going to come to Hogwarts, but I felt like today was a lot more productive than yesterday; I feel more prepared. Even if I didn’t figure out how to cast the spell yet.”
“Times up,” Drys shouted, startling Draco.
Potter glared at him. “I never had the most, how would you put it, enlightening upbringing. And no one talked about anything related to sexualities during my years at Hogwarts. Like ever.”
He hadn’t even noticed Madame Pomfrey fussing over him from the other side of his bed, checking his vitals. She pushed a potion vial to his lips once he and his mother were done with their quick little chat, and he felt it go down his throat; feeling sleepy and less achy already.
“Is this okay?” Harry asked. He was quite nervous, and was failing at trying to hide how shy he really was.
He had no desire to watch a woman who was so loyal to the light side, so protective of children, have to deal with and clean something made of pure dark magic, a mark that represented the
If this had been the first or second day hanging around Harry, Draco would have started yelling at him. But, over the past week, Draco had grown to enjoy hanging out with him, and knew if he started screaming at the Chosen One, all the progress they’d made with each other would be completely ruined.
Harry chuckled. “So, you really
Potter looked like he was going to say no. Draco wouldn’t blame him. Why would Potter do anything nice for him after Draco treated Potter so horribly for years? Also, Potter probably planned on skipping Transfigurations. If he walked in with Draco he would have to stay and endure Professor Wynn and his swooning.
“We saw you leave, mate,” Blaise said calmly. “We wanted to check on you.”
him. Had Potter lost his mind?
(This chapter is my longest yet with almost 9k words. I hope you enjoy it)
He had made extra attempts at avoiding the Mark whenever he took a shower and got dressed the past week; although it wasn’t like he
“Hey.” Harry rested his hand on Draco’s shoulder once more, and the contact eased some of the anger out of him. “You don’t know that for sure. I know you had those visions, or whatever, and I’m only going off of what you told me, but I honestly don't think Sunday is like an omen of death.”
He was halfway to the restrooms when he felt a hand circle around his wrist, luckily the right one. He turned to see that the hand belonged to Harry.
“You’re clearly not! What do you need? How can I help you?”
Draco cleared his throat. “Go on.”
“Pain in arse,” Draco offered.
apologize to them? And from what I’ve heard, a handful of others too?”
They started walking along the path once again, keeping their pace slow. Except this time Draco felt that something had changed. Some line had been crossed, between the two of them. The tension that was there before, was gone. The walk back to the castle was filled with comfortable silence this time, only broken by Potter almost slipping on a patch of ice and Draco laughing hysterically at him.
His mind was filled with one recurring thought and that was: Harry. There was absolutely no room in his cluttered brain to think about the fact that it was Thursday, and the next day they would finish brewing their potion.
Draco took a deep breath. “Thank you. Thank you for doing this for me, and for being so kind. Merlin knows I deserve it after- after everything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
“The Garden of Mystics,” Draco said absently.
“I know because I’m quite good at herbology. I actually paid attention in that class, unlike some people.” Draco raised his eyebrow at Potter. “They’re called Anemonlea.”
“Yeah but it was a good idea. It’s good to be prepared for a fight. Not that I think some scary figure
The lightning, rain, and thunder did not help with concentration either. Every single minute, it seemed to be getting louder and louder, and Draco wondered if that was even possible.
“Okay, well,” Draco panicked. “It’s just- in the middle of the night I woke up and I could tell you were having a nightmare. I wanted to- to make sure you were okay.”
Harry was taken aback. “No!
Blood was spurting out incredibly fast, and every second he wasted, Harry was more at risk of… becoming seriously damaged. Not dead. Death wasn’t even in the cards for Harry, because Draco would make things right, and if anybody was fated to die, it would be
Thank you to everyone who's read this story so far! It seriously means so much to me. Thank you all!
. No other questions asked.
Trying to block out all of Drys’s words swarming around inside his head, he continued to feel around on the ground for his wand, and to his amazement, he finally felt the familiar wood, and immediately put back up his shield, just before Drys hit him with a curse. He stood up, casting a quick glance over to Harry to make sure he was still okay, before returning his attention to Drys, who was still explaining everything.
I hope everyone is doing well and staying safe!
Stuck in an old, abandoned broom closet that was. On the seventh floor. Where nobody went.
That was when she apparently noticed the pool of blood that was all around them. She sucked in a breath of air at the realization, and then her eyes very obviously traveled to his left arm. She tried to hide her shock at seeing the Mark, but she did so very poorly. He self-consciously brought his arm up to his chest, holding it tightly, and staining his robes with blood, however it wasn’t that obvious since the color of his robes were black, with only a hint of green accenting the Slytherin emblem.
other visit here, I didn’t get a close up look at my book. But now, I can see clearly that someone had obviously replaced the real version with a fake.” Snape did not seem concerned about that fact
Draco brought his volume down an octave, but he was still the same level of ticked off. “Here’s what we’re going to do. I’m going to come out of this bathroom in a couple minutes, you’re going to leave me alone, and we’re going to sleep.”
to accompany
Draco was pretty sure he stopped breathing. He absolutely did not want to have this conversation. So much for not having to worry about anything. He looked down at his left arm, and although he had on long sleeves, for the first time since he’d been awake he felt something tight wrapped around his arm, under his sleeve. He guessed it was probably some sort of bandage. But, that meant Madame Pomfrey had fucking wrapped his arm up, and she had probably
“You had a concussion, a few cracked ribs, and multiple chest injuries-” Draco took a sharp breath at the diagnosis- “but I have healed them all. Do not worry. What you need now is rest.”
“Ooh, let me see!” Pansy exclaimed, looking at the letter that was now in Draco’s hand.
“Hogsmeade. C’mon, let’s go.”
“It’ll be fine. No one will ever know.” Potter started walking in the direction of the Hog's Head. Draco wanted to shout after him, “Now look who’s splitting up from the other?” But he didn’t. He reluctantly followed after Potter, who was now pulling out his wand and casting a series of opening spells on the Hog’s Head front door, trying one after the other until one would allow them passage.
So far, all of Saturday he and Harry constantly looked at Theo’s spot on Harry’s map, and so far, Theo hadn’t moved even the slightest inch.
After their time spent together in the kitchen, everything went downhill. Draco had known after their shared moment that they could never be together, in a relationship or just as friends. Things were just too different now that the Curse was over, and normal life was settling around them once more.
Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had had so much fun in a single week. Probably before he had come to Hogwarts. The past week had brought more enjoyment to him than the last seven years of his life had. That thought was certainly depressing, and made him even more aware of how fucked up his life was; more concerned about making others miserable to make himself feel better, rather than going out and having genuine fun with genuine friends and making real memories that weren’t based on being a bully.
“So, what are we waiting for?” Asked Harry, clearly anxious to try the frighteningly steep slide, that would possibly move its position any second. “Hold on, are you still hurt?”
to him, hit him pretty hard. “You’re talking to me?”
Both his friends' faces turned sympathetic in less than a second.
“Please don’t be dead, Harry. I need you.” Draco pressed a soft kiss onto the top of his head. “I can’t do this without you,” Draco sobbed. “Please, please wake up.”
“Do you miss him?” Draco inquired.
“I just wanted to give a proper goodbye, before the Aurors come and snatch me up,” Narcissa responded lightly, putting one arm around his shoulders.
. I have a blade on me, and I will give you that blade to cut Potter open wherever you like, as long as an ample amount of blood ends up on the blade. You will hand the blade over to me, and your family lives, along with everyone who is currently under the sleeping curse.
Well, it wasn’t so much of a necklace as it was a chain with a piece of something red dangling on it.
“Draco, look,” Harry said, glancing in the opposite direction of Draco.
The Room of Requirement provided a set of new, clean clothes, which consisted of jeans and a jumper, (his usual attire), and Draco pulled them on hastily, ignoring the horrible burning in his forearm. A burning more terrible than usual. It was slightly easy to ignore the pain, however, since the pain over losing Harry, because of his foolish mistakes, was even greater.
Potter blinked. Draco rolled his eyes.
The man laughed again. Draco fought the urge to use the killing curse on him right then and there. “Why, of course,” the Figure said, “Where are my manners? We haven’t even been introduced yet. Silly me.”
“Alec, are you jealous?”
“It’s a load of bullshit.”
Because his father had died. Because- not that anyone else besides a few Aurors and McGonagall knew- that he had indirectly killed his own father when he killed Drys.
Draco snorted. “I didn’t even ask for this party. Pansy planned it all.”
almost like they were expecting Draco to pick the “wrong” choice.
He was about to attempt to fall asleep when he heard rustling coming from Potter’s bed, and watched as Potter turned over onto his other side to face Draco. He could tell that Potter’s eyes were open if he squinted, and Draco hoped Potter couldn’t make out his own eyes staring right back at him.
“On my way to continue my search for you, Drys sent me a vision and told me to meet you at the edge of the forest.”
to see him? Dumbledore
“I’m guessing this counter-spell was not strong enough. The witch or wizard who cast this barrier probably made sure it couldn't be broken by some first year spell. Besides, if we get the potion done in the right amount of time, and wake everyone up, the adults can work it out,” Potter reassured.
. No matter what you did that evening with Drys, no matter how intentional or unintentional, I’m pretty sure it all cancels out.”
rule.”
Anyone could have seen his battered, destroyed Dark Mark (that, despite all the scars, was still visible). He still had on the bandage wrap that Pomfrey had given him, but his mind supplied to him the worst possibilities:
Harry sat up a little more, and Draco tried to carefully hold him down, but Harry wouldn’t cooperate. “Draco, this man- this man-” He coughed again.
“Ha.”
“So, being famous isn’t what you imagined it would be?”
, Draco screamed at the figure: “Show your face. SHOW YOUR FACE YOU COWARD!” Which did not do any wonders to his already charred throat.
Blaise punched Theo smack in the side of the head, his fist made of iron and his expression void of any emotion except for pure anger.
Drys was standing impatiently behind Alec, his arms crossed and a firm expression set in place. He whispered something to Alec, and although Draco couldn’t hear what was said, he’d bet it had to do with something along the lines of: “Hurry. Up.”
“Draco! Happy birthday!” She squealed. “So, what do you think?” She used her free hand to gesture at the grand space that could probably rival Malfoy Manor’s ballroom.
, the next thing he knew, he was getting
She kept on smiling, which was infuriating yet comforting.
Just as he was ready to start casting the same spells he’d already said over and over again until one of them stuck, a charm came to mind. One he knew that if cast with the right emotion or strength, it would work wonders.
Potter went on, “You could have just waited for me to show up. I would’ve been your partner if you’d have just asked.” His voice was soft now, and sounded very understanding.
“Well, we- as in Potter and I- found this book of yours.” He held out the book so that Snape could see the front cover, and he nodded his head. “I was wondering if you could tell me what the writing on the cover meant.”
Fury rose inside of him for allowing himself to trust a
duel.
Potter went back to searching through the book that was in front of him. Draco did the same. They had spent hours in the library, with no such luck finding anything relevant to sleeping curses. Draco thought it was stupid that they hadn’t found anything yet. Surely there had to be books written on sleeping curses or something closely related.
Draco had specifically told her he didn’t want a huge birthday party, however, Pansy couldn’t
Harry’s face
“Uh, that’s not the Restorative Potion,” Harry pointed out, a look of befuddlement on his face as he examined the potion vial in Draco’s hand.
It had really taken Draco by surprise, that he hadn’t had a vision; he’d prepared vigorously before going to bed for another message from the hooded figure. Waking up from a dreamless sleep had been a nice, but certainly odd and suspicious, surprise. Potter also had no nightmares again. He’d told Draco that himself when he asked if Draco had another vision.
He looked back at Drys, who was masking how truly terrified he was, and opened the door to a group of people in black cloaks and silver, gleaming masks.
“So, you’re saying, I’m a good person because I reluctantly followed a Dark Lord and wanted to puke every time I was forced to torture someone? Then, yes, I guess I am a great person.” Draco’s tone was bitter, and he was starting to become more angry every single second Harry spoke.
“This is great,” Draco said, grabbing his plate from Harry and sitting down at a table in the middle of the kitchen. Harry sat down across from him.
He watched as the Death Eaters and Drys killed all of the Purebloods in Hogwarts, wanting to
“So, you really don’t mind everything?” Draco asked skeptically. He hadn’t really wanted to change their lighthearted discussion. “Everything that happened over the span of the Sleeping Curse? All the messed up shit I did?”
“But if something horrible does happen tomorrow, aren’t you… scared?”
“Hold still, a second time.” Harry brandished his wand and cast
“I was too scared!” Draco cried. “I told you last night that I hadn’t changed, and this is what I was talking about! I blindly followed another dark wizard, Harry! And I didn’t even have the courage to ask for help. Looks like the war hadn’t taught me anything.”
Potter was still a git. He was still an annoying, self-righteous Gryffindor, with atrocious hair. Draco still did
“That’s what I just said, yes.”
He turned Snape’s book in his hands, feeling the texture of the leather and smelling the scent of dust and old books. He had placed a good amount of trust in that book to provide them with the right potion for the sleeping curse’s cure. It had done

to cause a target to disintegrate.
Much to Draco’s surprise, Potter nodded his head and started to walk in the direction of the Transfigurations classroom. Draco followed him.
He had been lucky enough that throughout the past two weeks, he had done a significant amount of walking and running, so he was able to run a long distance without feeling the need to be sick.
“I do know other spells. You remember I started The DA in fifth year, right? I seem to recall
“Would you like to talk about why the two of you aren’t speaking at the moment?”
Potter stood back up, and so did Draco. “You are
Another eventful revelation in his first week back was that he was no longer being picked on by Theo or any other student or teacher. Theo tried not to make eye contact with Draco at all, which was refreshing. Blaise really did a number on him and his group.
“How about you, you know, take one thing at a time. Focus on the funeral first, or focus on fixing things with Harry. You don’t have to do both.”
“This past summer. The same day I met his dad, and the last day. When Hogwarts opened back up again in September, Drys left the country. He was in grief, I’m guessing, and had to get away from England. Kind of shitty to leave Alec behind, which is probably why Alec behaves like he does to everyone; his dad fled the country without him.
“In the best possible way imaginable. From the moment there was a hint of friendship between us, it felt different and unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before.”
He felt a couple tears falling, but he knew it was due to the galaxy and stars and everything extraordinary holding him. He felt home. He felt home for the first time in years. Even if he was sitting in the cold, the snow making his trousers wet and icy; he couldn’t care less.
After a whole fucking day and two nights of
Draco knew all too well. His past was something that haunted him day after day. “I know.”
“Draco, is there anything else you wish to tell us?” Dumbledore asked politely. He had this knowing look that Draco hated.
“Are you that nervous?”
Draco eyed him skeptically. “So, should we get going, then?”
“Highly doubt that, but it’s a nice thought.”
They couldn’t fuck up.
He was studying the bandage wrap, picking at the material, when he heard Pomfrey’s door open again. He looked up, and Pomfrey had poked her head out through the door crack. Bringing one hand to cup her mouth, she spoke softly, “I think he likes you.”
“Please don’t tell me that you carried me up to the castle, or something,” Draco added in.
about Harry. His heart burned every time he thought about how much he wanted Harry, but no matter what Harry could say to him, Draco knew deep inside that Harry shouldn’t be affiliated in any way with a Death Eater, and a murderer.
Draco craned his neck so that he could look directly at Harry. At Harry’s red nose and cheeks. At his dorky yet lovable glasses. At his ink black hair. He was thinking that Harry was beautiful, and that Harry truly was brighter than any star in the world.
“Harry,” Draco breathed, aware of how close Harry was to his lips.
Draco shook his head, confused at Harry’s sweet response. “But I thought you hated me? I mean, I bullied you and your friends. I was- am. A-”
He wanted to ask him what had changed, and what had prompted him to act closed-off last night, but he decided against saying anything on the subject. He, unlike Potter, was not nosey and did not need to know every aspect of Potter’s life. Even if he really, really wanted to know what had bothered him so much.
“You don’t know that! What if the potion we’re brewing right now ends up not working! We have a week and a day until next Sunday, we-”
“Good to see you, Draco!” Elizabeth said happily as he sat down in the seat across from her.
Draco had to accept that was the best he was going to get out of Drys. “Alright, then.”
Darkness surrounded him, circling around him like it was about to feast on its prey. It stopped as quickly as it started, though, and Draco was transported to a room in a house. It instantly reminded him of the room he would always go to in his visions with the Figure, but that room had been worn down and completely destroyed.
The rest of Hogwarts was woken up, and although some were upset their friends were found dead, most rejoiced at the idea that they never had to feel lesser at school or anywhere else. It was a new era.
” which made a large cloud of smoke appear in front of him, and Draco started coughing while swatting away the fumes.
Harry’s face softened. “Yeah, I did. Thanks for asking about it.”
“The paper was due the next day, and I had spent days writing the paper; I did not want to rewrite it. So next day in class when Professor Vector was collecting our assignments, I told her I had already handed mine in a couple days previous. It wasn’t hard to believe. I usually get my work done early. All she said was a quick little, ‘Oh,’ and scurried off. She’s terrified of me and I don’t think she wanted to spend more time talking to me than she had to, so she never even brought it up again. I’m pretty sure she gave me an O for the paper, and I never had to complete that assignment.”
“Let’s try some then,” Harry stated. He opened the book to a random page and Draco stood up, wanting to see what spell Harry was looking at. “
Obviously, Harry would never return those feelings. Draco still hadn’t even had the guts to apologize for all of the horrible deeds he had done to Harry and his friends. He was still lying to Harry about plenty of things.
“Just go and
Draco looked up at Harry in that moment, disregarding whatever Pansy was saying. Harry was talking to Granger and Thomas. His mouth was curved up and his eyebrows were raised as he babbled on about who knows what. Draco was the only person to recognize that this appearance was an act; a fraud. Harry had that same not-quite-here look as he did before the Curse. He was talking to his friends, enjoying his meal so it seemed, and yet Harry was in another universe, far from the one Draco and everyone else was sitting in.
Once he reached the top, he tried the door handle leading to the office, and found that it was open. He sucked in a breath, and pushed the door inward, walking into a spacious and neatly decorated office that was definitely suitable for a headmaster, or headmistress.
When he turned back around to stare at Harry and suggest they should get going- it was almost twelve o’clock- Harry immediately lifted his head and looked away, embarrassed. He had been looking in Draco’s direction when Draco had been turned around, and he wondered what Harry could have been doing that made him so sheepish. It was like he had been caught doing something he wasn’t supposed to be doing.
“Yeah. Sleeping arrangements,” Draco responded, also for about the hundredth time.
Draco wanted to tell Potter to go on without him, but he knew Potter wouldn’t allow that, as a result of his weird paranoia that some shit was going to happen to either of them if they were separated.
The Death Eaters, save for Draco, got their own cruel punishment. They were forced to obey all of Drys’s commands, but were all fully aware of the evil they were committing; killing their own blood. It was a punishment that served them right, Draco thought.
“But I
“Potter. What are you looking at? I feel like I’m going blind.” Draco said at last.
“I do have- uh, one question. For you.” Potter turned slightly in his seat. He was obviously embarrassed about something. And this time it had nothing to do with him crying; his tears were long gone by now. “Did you ever have a… boyfriend? Or whatever. I honestly thought you and Parkinson were a thing.”
“Maybe he’ll even get another scar on his face, one to match that ugly thing on his cheek.”
They’d fallen asleep pretty fast, their arms wrapped around each other, Draco breathing in Harry’s scent as he drifted into lovely dreams, dreams that he never wanted to end. He hadn’t remembered having a nice dream since… fifth year. Maybe even third. Who knew.
He then made the short walk to the door that led to her sleeping chamber. He rapped on the door, a little too harshly, but he was really starting to worry;
Draco couldn’t decide if the world knowing was a bad or good thing.
Potter let out a low ‘ugh’ sound, and turned away from Draco. “You know I realized that, thank you.”
“No, no the song is great. Different than any other song I’ve heard, but great nonetheless.”
“So? Anything?” Harry asked, looking from Draco to the open window.
He leaned in to press his lips to Harry’s, his eyes fluttering closed, when his lips touched Harry's cheek. He opened his eyes to see that Harry had turned his head to the side right as Draco had been going to kiss him. Did Harry regret what they had done last night?
“You’re going to be just fine. I’ll get us out of this.” He didn’t know if he was trying to reassure Harry, or himself.
Draco moved his gaze to his lap for a couple of seconds, trying to ignore Harry’s piercing eyes. “Alright.”
Apparently, Alec had fled the scene sometime after Harry had already started to carry Draco up to the castle. Authorities hadn’t been able to find Alec until around the week Draco had been conscious in the Hospital Wing, playing games and chatting with Pansy and his mum.
he said, walking towards the noise.
The idea that him and Harry were now
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now, that wasn’t so bad, was it?” Drys said. He started walking towards his son.
“Drys gave me two options. I’d sort of known about these options ever since he talked to me through the vision, but not really. The first option he gave me was that I was to willingly cut your skin--to procure your blood. The second option was that I refuse to cut you and my family dies, the school stays asleep forever, and I would be directly blamed for these things.”
Drys definitely looked intrigued. “Go on.”
McGonagall finished speaking, and she walked up to Draco, looking down at him with a smile. “Welcome back, Draco.”
“You don’t have to do anything you’re uncomfortable with,” Harry said reassuringly.
He arrived at Defense in a haze, it hadn’t even seemed like he walked the rest of the way down the corridors, it was like his feet had just carried him, while his mind had wandered. He noticed that Pansy had already taken a seat in their usual spot, in the back of the class, and he went over to join her.
“Oh! Yeah! Yeah. Ready,” Harry said, pocketing his wand and grabbing his bag. “But before we head to the Garden, I wanted to make a quick stop to the Room of Requirement. If that's okay with you.”
He also realized, what Harry had told him in the Garden of Mystics the night they had danced, was that Harry was trying to find sophrosyne too. He was trying to find that missing piece that was left out of him, trying to find happiness in the world after the Dark Lord. Draco now understood, he was trying to do the exact same thing.
Draco had blinked, not fully comprehending what was going on. “Oh.”
“Shit. God- I’m- I’m sorry. I didn’t realize-”
“Hi, Professor.” Pansy tried to sound nonchalant, but failed.
Harry was looking at him like he grew another head, and Draco honestly couldn’t blame him. He realized half way through his shitty apology that it
Not that he was going to leave this room. He was stuck here. On the ground. In the back of a dark classroom that no one used, except for on Fridays. Pansy might start to worry after a while, but she would probably believe Draco fell asleep in the library, and wouldn’t check on him until morning. And when she would come to the library, to find Draco nowhere around, she would trace his steps back to the therapy classroom, to find Draco dead, in a pool of blood, the Dark Mark very much apparent on his pale skin.
“I did what had to be done, and I know you already know this, but you did too. If you look at it in a certain perspective, Drys was just as bad as Voldemort.”
Back to answering Draco’s original question, Drys said, “Your blood that I had procured from Alec, who brought it to me at the edge of the forest the night before I cast the sleeping curse, allowed me to keep an eye on everything you were doing, along with allowing me to bind the Death Eater’s through the Mark under my rule, of course. It was basically my own crystal ball. I could see through your eyes.
Hopefully Alec isn't too annoying for an OC. But he's an integral part of the story I promise.
“That’s the part where I’m angry with you. I had to ask
The whole class openly gaped at him.
McGonagall was speechless, her eyes watery and a small, genuine smile still plastered on her face. She got up from her seat and walked over to Draco; he was a little bit taller than her, he realized.
This time around, Draco was prepared, and turned to look directly at Harry, smiling a huge smile. Harry did the exact same thing, and he wondered whether Harry had actually read his mind. Or, maybe, they just thought alike.
“Yes. Now, get me out of here!” he snapped.
“But, we should get started. The sun is almost setting.”
Without any type of warning, Drys lifted his wand arm, pointing it right at Harry. Draco was almost too stunned to move, let alone think, about what was going to happen as Drys started to mutter something under his breath, his expression now a look of murderous glee.
Draco had gotten himself stuck in a broom closet. Draco could feel his cheeks burn and he mentally cursed his pale complexion.
But, when the hood was completely off, and the man’s face was perfectly visible, Draco realized he had no idea who the man standing before him was.
The Death Eater at the front of the group looked down to read off of a piece of parchment. “Are you Drys Kaspian?”
“That is so unbelievably easy for you to say,” Draco drawled.
Draco couldn’t think of a single reason why he, Draco, should be concerned, he was living his fantasy. He’d kissed Harry Potter. His life was basically complete.
When he finished eating most of his food, and set his plate aside, he had to admit he was feeling sort of tired. He was getting settled in his bed, ready to try and sleep when he felt it. A faint burning feeling coming from his left forearm. Draco shook his head, he knew he was imagining it. He had felt similar feelings ever since the Dark Lord had perished. The burning was a figment of his imagination; his trauma. However, he thought to himself,
Draco marveled at Harry. “And how do you know this? You’re the last person I would have thought would know the layout of the castle.”
but let Draco hold onto the book.
Draco heard the door behind them close.
was when he knew his life was complete.
“Thanks for sitting down with me to talk,” he said genuinely.
first name as much as he loved hearing his own name come out of the other boy’s mouth.
The rest of class went by in a blur. They had worked on Orchideous spells, which allowed the caster to conjure flowers. Draco had been paired up with Pansy to practice them. He hadn’t paid much attention, he’d been preoccupied watching Potter laugh and joke around with Kaspian. It was like their whole head-to-head confrontation hadn’t even happened, and they were best mates again. He had tried to reign in his focus, but his eyes were drawn to Potter. Pansy had snapped her fingers in his face several times and had scolded him saying, “Stop drooling over Potter’s arse and focus your attention on
“Er-” Potter started, then stopped, and said, “Thanks.”
“No. Well, he sort of talked. It looked like it was taking a lot of effort for him to speak. He said he didn’t want to come here, and that he could just go back to his dormitory to heal the rest of his injuries.”
“I trust you.”
Okay, so maybe what Draco had added on wasn’t the best setup for Harry to
Madame Pomfrey huffed in annoyance. “Fine. You have five minutes! No more!” She then stalked back into her office and shut the door.
“If you can, try to escape. Run as far as you can. I’m guessing the wards Drys put up are going to be taken down soon-”
The thought chilled Draco’s whole body.
because that was how he imagined the event really was in his head. But obviously Harry was doing the favor as a… friend? Maybe. A nice friendly gesture to show he was thankful for Draco’s help. Not a date in the slightest. “Never mind. Let’s go, then. Shall we?”
Draco checked the time using his wand, not for the first time in the last ten minutes, and saw that it was finally eight o’clock. He perked up, and lightly tossed his book on a table as he walked over to Harry. “Are you ready?” He didn’t have to explain to Harry what he meant.
It was all Draco’s fault.
fault for the death of hundreds of wizards.” Drys cocked his head to the side. “So, it’s a simple choice, really.”
His wand was held firmly in his hand, the Dark Mark on his arm stinging and calling out to him, but he ignored it. He briefly remembered that it was pointless carrying around his wand, as he was not allowed to cast any defensive charms, but it wouldn’t even come to that if he could find Harry before something terrible could find him first.
Though, Draco supposed, his name wasn’t much better. At least his name meant dragon, which was sort of cool.
Harry picked up the
Draco and Potter both let out a collective gasp at the sight. Whatever Draco was expecting to happen to the rock Potter had thrown, it most certainly wasn’t
Draco hadn’t even thought of the possibility of a third outcome: the potion not working at all. Creating nor life or death.
He had never told McGonagall that people constantly attacked him. She definitely knew, though. From the times he sported a black eye and from bruises that were clearly visible. She had once even come over to where him and Pansy sat in the Great Hall and asked if students were bothering him. Pansy had shot him a look that said, ‘just fucking tell her the truth,’ but Draco had shook his head and told McGonagall that he was fine. The Headmistress had said to tell her if anyone ever did bother him, because no one deserved to be attacked.
“Oh.” He wasn’t sure where Harry was going with this.
“Whoa. What happened to being nice to each other?” Draco asked. He was genuinely concerned for Potter at the moment. He seemed tired and full of irritability.
A bright burst of magic lit up Snape’s book, and they finally broke their eye contact. The book was slightly shaking and words were being inscribed across the blank page that was laid open; it was like an invisible hand was writing the words. The words were written in neat cursive, almost similar to Snape's print, and the color was bright gold. A neat contrast to the faded tan pages.
Potter shook his head. “It is weird. And I couldn’t even begin to form an answer for you. I’m just as clueless.”
Before he even registered what he was doing, the metal object- which he now identified as a blade- began cutting through Harry’s forearm. There was so much blood, and Draco knew he would have been sick from the sight had it not been that his worries had mysteriously left him.
“Yeah?”
“Trust me, it wasn’t intentional. I was on my way to see if you were awake, and I ran into them on the stairs. Granger asked me if I was on my way to see you, so I told her yes, and she said she would come too,” She explained.
he heard a noise. It did not make the situation he was in less creepy, that was for sure, as he was in the darkest part of the castle, by himself.
“Alec’s blood made it so that I could surpass McGonagall’s wards myself, but not the Death Eaters. Like I said, I needed Harry’s blood to break the ward as a whole. I didn’t really have a need to actually step inside Hogwarts, though, since I could just see what you were doing through your eyes.
His heart clenched at her words, and he could sense that his eyes were starting to get watery. He still needed to say something to her, though. Something that was going to take every ounce of courage in his body to say.
Draco looked down at the ground. This was exactly the kind of discussion he was trying to avoid talking about. Dark wizards. The Dark Lord. His role in all of it.
“STOP!” Draco yelled, getting to his feet and standing directly in front of Harry, hopefully shielding all of Harry’s body.
“I miss my dad, and at the same time, I hate him. I don’t even know if I should go to his stupid funeral coming up.”
He wanted to blurt out that, no, he really hadn’t saved Harry’s life; he’d almost taken it away. But Draco
McGonagall eyed Draco, her lips in a firm, contemplative line. Her hands were intertwined together, laying on a blank space of desk in front of her. “I see,” was all she said.
And although the only sounds to be heard were their breaths, and the splashes of the fountain, Draco could’ve sworn he heard music playing from somewhere, space, or time.
“I want to be friends.”
“Nope, I’m fine. Night,” She admonished as she disappeared down the hallway.
Draco looked out the closest window to find that it was, in fact, sunset. He’d lost track of time.
Alec scoffed loudly. He looked almost ethereal, leaning against a huge tree, the rain almost blowing past him and the shimmer from the wards hitting the side of his body. “Just do it already!” Alec shouted at his father.
“Nothing, Potter. Uh- that’s a good idea, yeah. Let’s go then.” Draco did not want to go to the Room of Requirement, but he wasn’t going to let Potter see his cowardice. That room would surely bring back many horrible memories that he didn’t want to recount. Nevertheless, there wasn’t any other option they could think of, so it would have to do. Draco could be brave. He could withstand the dreadful memories it would most likely bring him.
“There’s just too many Goddamn things to think about,” he muttered spitefully.
Once it was completely off, Harry threw the used bandage somewhere on the opposite side of the room, and peered down at the bare Mark. His fingers were carefully closed around Draco’s left wrist, and from what Draco could tell, he was just taking it in, studying it with his eyes.
His tears were starting to become sparse, from the lack of… whatever produced tears in one’s body. Draco honestly had no clue how tears were made or what they came from, not that he would ever need knowledge about that particular subject in his life.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” she sighed, “As you said, I’m not that well rounded on curses of any kind, and even the wizards and witches who do study Unforgivables and the like have never found out why Mr. Potter wasn’t killed that fateful night. Your best bet is to talk to Potter himself.”
him into the tight, dusty space, with the door slamming to a close as he stumbled into a shelf.
Pansy still hung out with Theo, even though she knew Draco and him were no where close to being friends, or even friendly to another. It didn’t really bother Draco, he knew she had been friends with Theo for a long time, longer than she and Draco had known each other. Pansy still chose Draco over Theo’s company though most of the time, and that thought made Draco smirk.
It was the most gentle kiss imaginable, no rushing, no force; just pure, soft, love. Harry was treating Draco like he was built of glass, too. He couldn’t help but think that the old Draco certainly would have never tolerated any treatment where he was viewed as delicate. But now, it felt more than comforting, it felt like he truly meant something to someone.
Everything was crumbling down fast. The worst part was, it was all his fault.
They sat in silence sipping on their own Butterbeers at a small table. Draco made sure his seat was far away from Potter’s, and Potter did the same. After a while, Potter got up and made his way to the back room, trying to find something edible to eat. He came back about five minutes later with his arms full of a basket of assorted fruits. (Why the fuck did a pub have assorted fruits?)
“To the stars through difficulties,” Draco spoke quietly. “It’s a beautiful Latin quote. One of my favorites, actually.”
Draco spoke a little more softly, seeing that Potter was clearly heading into a state of distress. “We’ll fix this, Potter. Don’t worry. With my smarts and your recklessness, we should be unstoppable.” Potter laughed. Draco hadn’t meant it to be funny, he was only stating the obvious, but he was glad for Potter’s laugh. “Let’s say we do have thirteen days before something absolutely horrible happens. We figure out a counter spell from some book or whatever to save everyone. Simple. All we have to do is look for the right book. I’m sure we can manage that in thirteen days.”
Draco heard Harry shout an almost inaudible “Ugh!” as he presumably left the door, hopefully realizing Draco wasn’t going to let up and say anything.
“No, I just- just trust me.”
“You’re right.” Potter followed Draco’s lead and packed up his possessions too.
Harry looked slightly uncomfortable, but he was mostly filled with relief at the notion that Draco wasn’t harming himself.
You’ll get into serious trouble!”
Harry was being incredibly gentle, taking his time and looking up at Draco to get his reassurance to keep on. Draco found it hard to believe he’d ended up with a man this thoughtful and caring, let alone that man being Harry Potter.
Slowly but surely, he started to distance himself from his area of the room and make his way back to the door. Luckily, Robins was still helping Theo while Blaise and Davis were whispering and laughing to each other.
However, in an instant, Harry pushed him out of the way, making Draco stumble a bit. Luckily, he didn’t fall over again.
He touched the missing part of the mirror, and everything around him crumpled away.
She immediately brought herself back to a standing position, wiping her face and sniffling.
He didn’t have much energy to talk to her, and everything still hurt very, very much. He just hoped she knew some healing spells.
up to something.”
. How could you not care?”
Tuesday, after waking up awkwardly next to each other, they’d gone about their day as usual, except instead of spending every second crowded in the library, they made sure to spend a good amount of time in the Garden of Mystics, where they talked and laughed and just sat in the beauty of the garden.
The song seemed to fill the room, and while the Garden felt freezing a couple of minutes ago, it now felt scorching hot. Or maybe that was just Draco’s cheeks burning up while he watched Harry move to the music, a look of euphoria on his face.
There were no windows in the kitchen, but Draco guessed stars were starting to shine through the sky as it turned dark. He hoped he and Harry would be able to share another moment under the stars together sometime.
Draco pictured the memory vividly in his mind, slowly calming down the panic that had arisen in him.
The radio was placed on the edge of the water fountain, and Harry let go of Draco’s hand to go fiddle with the buttons again.
, I won’t judge you. I went through the same war you went through, if it’s flashbacks or-”
“Everything alright over there?” Slughorn called out from behind his desk. He seemed to only be addressing Potter.
Draco Malfoy was stuck. Quite literally.
“So, uh, sleeping arrangements…” Potter said, for about the hundredth time.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was so close. Draco could feel his quick breaths on his face. This was it.
