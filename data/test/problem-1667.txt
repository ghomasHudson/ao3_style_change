"Yes," Snape said, with a sharp nod. He opened a drawer in the nearby table and dropped the marble into it, just as a House Elf appeared with a tea service. The elf looked at the parchment-strewn surfaces around it, and then at its tray. Moving the tray to one hand, he snapped his fingers, summoning a table just large enough for the tray and a few well-positioned saucers. With a bow and a squeaked 'your tea, sirs!" he vanished, leaving the tea service behind.
Harry was eager to agree. That Snape had asked him rather than Draco probably meant he had news to impart in private. Unless Harry was missing something about Slytherin offers. Harry looked at the challenge in Snape's pose and thought of Gentian. Was he supposed to ask for something in return?
"Yes, I am. Do you think this place can manage pheasant? Perhaps if they send someone out to poach it...."
"Has he lost interest?" Ron asked, just a little too eagerly. Harry responded with a rude gesture, which made Ginny laugh.
"I think the Dursleys left you more or less immune. It's a problem with people who were abused as children--"
At breakfast on Sunday, another school owl, nondescript except for being rather small, brought him a note on a rolled piece of parchment.
"I don't CARE how pretty she was!" Ron shouted. "You can't just-- just shag someone because you want to
you have an ally." Snape's eyes flashed up as he understood. Harry continued anyway. "An ally with some portion of Dumbledore's favor, some sway with Gryffindors, and more of the community trust. Also, many opponents will underestimate my guile, and how far I will go to win. Isn't that better than another Slytherin?"
Draco was carrying a covered platter of little tarts and cakes, so rather than bumping him off-balance, Harry stuck his tongue out at him. Draco smirked, and began setting out the treats for that evening's gathering. The pastries were glazed, or adorned with swirls of brittle chocolate -- dark, creamy white, tinted -- and tiny jewel-like berries.
Harry bit his lip to restrain a snigger. It was only funny if they could stop it. "Try a sentence," he suggested.
Remus rolled his eyes.  "I'm glad to hear it, but that will hardly reassure--" belatedly, he caught himself -- "my friend."
Snape nodded. "Exactly. That defense was -- and always has been -- complete nonsense. Someone who needed to be brought into line with threats would not be made a Death Eater." He raised his head. "However, a Death Eater who
"So we all get to see how other people think. You can ask Gilbert, but I think it's even better for the Slytherins, because their house is more the
Malfoy frowned. For a moment, he looked almost familiar. "Are your Gryffindor friends treating you decently?"
"If he was lying, why not make it all more what he wanted?" Harry objected. "Why tell me about the Muggle father at all?"
Ron shrugged. "Not this year, really, but last year was...." With another shrug, he trailed off, and Harry nodded.
Draco nodded. "Thus the presents -- just like you have to live there, they have to give you a Christmas present each year, so the spell believes that you are family."
"Look," he said shakily. "I know we went through this before, but this isn't an obligation. You can live here until your trial, not letting me touch you, and I'll still treat you well, and it won't change my testimony in either case, and--"
This time he got to see the purse of Cartwright's lips.  "It is relevant to the investigation," he said, "that before slaughter, the birds must be --"
"Oh, hush! I was teasing. Lie down, now." In a quick flash of pink tongue, Malfoy licked her lips. "I want to see how you like it as a girl."
He dared a glance at Draco. He had his forehead resting on one spread hand. Harry couldn't tell if his eyes were open or shut.
He clung as tightly as he ever had to any hope, his eyes closed against fear of tears, breathing in the scents that clung to his godfather's shoulder-length hair.
Ron was quiet as he, Harry, and Neville climbed the stairs to Gryffindor. On the second landing, Harry nudged him.
"Of course," Snape answered blandly. He brought over two glasses. "With gin," he said, setting one on the table in front of Harry, "and without."
Harry smiled at the parchment. He penned a quick reply, addressing it to "Remus" and explaining about his contract with the twins, and their cooperative use of Polyjuice potion. When it was finished, he sealed it and headed off for the Owlery. Halfway across the common room, he was interrupted.
Professor Hecksban produced a plain river rock from his bag. Draco could not transfer the curse to it, nor could Harry.
After two dances, Linnet laughed that they would cause gossip if they shared a third so soon, and Harry found himself looking for another partner. Now that he was thinking of it, he could see how certain girls passed near him and lingered, swaying slightly while they smiled on the dancers, and it took little more than a cough to turn their eyes to him. Draco left the room with a girl and her parents, and Harry ignored it with a foxtrot.  He couldn't do all the flourishes of the people around him, but he didn't step on the girl's feet, and she looked happy when he finished. After bows and thank yous, he looked around for something to quench his thirst.
"One death, two bizarre disabilities. And from Malfoy's file, I think some curse effects may be more subtle."
Turning his face to the side didn't stop Draco from keeping his eyes on Harry. "I have something better," he said suggestively.
After comparing Harry's strand to Linnet's, Gilbert's, and Draco's -- Millicent refused to display hers -- Astoria made her choice. "The clear one," she said, touching it. "No one else has one."
To Harry's amazement, the Slytherins did, indeed, take notes. Snape pointed out to Harry that 'cordially', while generally indicating good will, was a mimicry of the official invitation, and therefore non-committal. Draco observed that acknowledging that Harry's ancestors had previously attended Malfoy events was somewhat of a concession, while the oblique mention of Harry's maternal line a reminder of his blood status, and as such, a tacit insult. Snape wondered if it was significant the Narcissa not mentioned her own line, the House of Black.
"Yes, exactly." Draco said smoothly. "His experience is primarily with stone, as he worked in Egypt for three years, but Harry and I have been doing some Shaping with Professor McGonagall, and Harry has an affinity for wood, as he said."
After he left Knockturn Alley, Harry still felt like the grime of it was clinging to him. He needed to go somewhere normal, he decided, and settled on Flourish & Blotts. He could get a book on far-seeing or possibly something on hexes. As he entered the shop, he wondered where he could find information on Red Caps. Draco's theory on their usefulness made sense; he
"You don't have one?" Draco tilted the box into the light. "Look. The carvings would glow if there was something in it, which would be a parchment with someone's name, and possibly a time."
It was written in plain black ink and neither addressed nor signed. Harry thought that was just as well. Oh fuck. His erection was returning at the thought of Malfoy after more of that potion: pretty, soft girl-Malfoy, spreading her white thighs with eager curses. Harry shifted a hand down his stomach, tempted to deal with his problem then and there.
"As for subtlety," Pansy persisted, "I have a question about your account of the events of our second year."
"We were thinking of adding fifth-years this term, though we haven't discussed it yet. Is he discreet enough? I mean, without Babbling Draught?"
Blaise glanced at Draco, and then looked down. "The curses could be layered by time," he said. Harry watched people look at him expectantly. Blaise rubbed his forehead, hiding his face for a moment.  "Instead of an overall strategy, I mean -- just one target on top of the previous, as circumstances changed."
"Ah." Harry wasn't quite sure that he understood the distinction. He himself, he decided, was moving towards that line, but he was under very special circumstances. He wasn't sure he would trust many people who knew Dark Arts.
"Look," Harry hazarded, "I don't have any idea of how magical sex-change works, but I saw you had potions books.  Shouldn't there be a charm for that?"
"Mm. I'm not bad with healing charms. A necessity, really, considering our line of research. May I check it?"
Instead of letters, what fell by his plate was Hermione's Daily Prophet. Harry had gone back to his eggs when she let out a little cry of dismay.
They had arrived at the headmaster's office. For a moment, both regarded the gargoyle uncertainly. Draco broke the silence.
"Lift the glamour!"  he hissed, fumbling in his bag for his invisibility cloak. He knew he had brought it -- he always brought it -- but he didn't set it on the top anymore.
Hermione poured a little from the carafe into a wine glass, and tasted it plain. Her face scrunched together at the bite of quinine.
"You'd have to ask the Aurors. I saw it in front of K-- Auror Shacklebolt, and he took it as evidence." Harry made a face.  "Not that I
would do nothing behind his back. "Anyway, that didn't matter. It was her secret, not mine, and she didn't want me to tell you. She's afraid of you, and I can't blame her."
"Oh." She sank to the sofa. "That's a problem. Are we sure that International Cooperation is affected?"
"No more than you." She had stopped working on his trousers to encircle his erection in one hand. "Oh. Yeah."
"I...." Harry swallowed hard. He had seen himself in the mirror, and he seemed to be almost the same person. But somehow, here, he had taken to assaulting Muggle girls for kicks .... with Malfoy as a voyeur, it seemed.
At the list of names, Harry relaxed. He nodded. They couldn’t just pull out the ones in Dumbledore’s group and not give a reason. He wondered if any of them had left the school to help with the hunt for Aunt Petunia.
"If you loose the challenge, you get a larger bead," Parvati suggested. People were nodding, but Harry remembered how Draco had rejected the idea of majority rule earlier, when suggesting how colors should work.
"Oh. Well, exaggerated." Harry shrugged. "Though we did overdo it sometimes. Especially me, I suppose."
"Oh, yes you do. You're an absolute mess. When was the last time you left your flat before coming here? Interacted with anyone but customers?"
"And far better than orange," Draco agreed. He took a quick breath, let it out, cleaned under his nails, and then added another scrunch to the cloth.
Dropping the claw hastily into the potion, Harry took up his wand. As soon as the claw tipped below the surface, he put out the fire below the cauldron.
Despite that resolve, washing and dressing were slowed by looks and touches and kisses and promises of "later."  When Draco, who had insisted on going first, opened the door to the larger seventh-year Slytherin boys' dormitory, the occupants were still in bed.
"Never, I expect."  Snape crossed his arms over his chest. "Now, Harry. Two causes of winter blooms."
, as we know he isn't involved," Cartwright argued. "He was negotiating the purchase of a bitch during one of the sales, and this is his location during another."
Whirling to face him, Snape glared. "Petulance does not become you, Mr. Potter," he hissed. Harry froze. Snape stepped closer.  "It makes you remind me far too much of your father ... and not a little of my former master."
if any of those things are true! I lived in a cupboard, and then a locked room, and then at a school -- the best, most wonderful place I've ever lived, but it's still a
"Oh, there's not always time for setup," Draco objected cheerily. "Anyone else want wine? It's a nice Vouvray."
Draco arrayed himself on the middle sofa, near to Linnet, in a picturesque sprawl. "As we're dining with him," he remarked, "it hardly seems worth hiking up to the third floor and back."
"Okay." Carefully, Harry let go of the teacup. That was as good as he was likely to get about Draco, and better than he'd expected. "I've ... I've studied a bit-- a few spells -- well, one, mainly -- of Dark Arts."
He sighed. "All right. You're probably right -- but it's not Slytherins, I think, just a month of hiding from everyone."
it -- the practical parts -- out in the world. I mean, I might want to learn to cook without Aunt Petunia dictating terms, and you might want all your meals to be elaborate House Elf creations. I might want a dog that can jump on the sofa.  You might have a dozen sofas that are all priceless heirlooms, at least one of which vaporizes dogs." To his relief, Draco's grim expression actually broke at that. Harry smiled anxiously back. "You'll want your manor, and I might want a flat in a town, where I can meet people when I walk to the park, or the local, or to a grocer's for the paper."
"Even if." He sighed. "You obviously can't take care of yourself in anything subtle, and if someone matters to you, you ought to trust me to take that into account." Sneering, he took a seat. "Has
The street was quiet, except for their panting breaths.  Harry helped Draco to his feet, and they kept their arms around each other.  With the Weasleys, they stood in the suddenly quiet street, looking warily around. A few shreds of bubblegum, an abandoned knife, and a displaced chunk of flint were the only signs of the battle. Harry saw a curtain edge flick down in the nearest house. He let out a shaky breath.
Awkwardly, Severus crawled over to him. Without preliminaries, he took Harry's cock in his mouth and began loosely to move up and down. It was wet and hot and nicely deep, if not at all nuanced. Severus went until he was gagging, then moved up, caught a breath, and started again. Harry began to develop the uncomfortable feeling that he wasn't enjoying it at all.
Seamus hissed an urgent warning for silence, and Harry looked up. Yolanda was crossing over to them, Sammy trailing reluctantly behind her, his face red.
"Rescuing you," Harry answered. Draco's body was soothingly white as he parted the blanket to slip back into bed -- nothing at all like the bruised and torn creature that Harry had pulled his robes over with his teeth after the Death Eaters had left him to die.
When they left for the Transfiguration classroom, Draco's hair was messy in back from lying in Harry's lap. Harry couldn't bring himself to mention it, and have Draco comb away the reminder.
"Yours!" he cried, and this time the more senior members of the group flinched as it left his grip. The bottle arced towards the stone wall. Ron dove to intercept it. Cornelia tackled him. There were thumps and shouts, but Harry managed to get his shield between the shattering glass and Ron's outstretched hands. He couldn't do anything to keep Ron's face from smashing into the floor.
Remus reached out a hand over the table, and Sirius took it in a tight hold. Remus nodded. "He had. And it was painful in a way that darkened a significant portion of my life.  However...." He shrugged. "I understand what he was trying to accomplish. I was certainly
it before either. And I'm better when I don't think too much. Anyway, the Stupefaction hex hit him as he was moving forward, so he fell over. And Snape had apparently caught up, because curselight from
"I trust you can take care of yourself," Snape said coolly, and he pivoted sharply and strode off, leaving Harry hoping the Skyberries had survived the exchange unbruised. A hand settled gently on his shoulder.
His spirits lifting, Harry smiled back and went to fetch milk from the cold cupboard before he started the kettle. He drank his own tea black, and it was easy to forget Draco's milk when he was tired.
Draco gasped at the second lash, but then caught himself. "You have control. He doesn't want-- Ah! -- to see it. Gods."
"Er..." Neville straightened. "I suppose it depends," he said, with more composure than Harry would have expected. "I'll tell you at the end of the evening, shall I?" With that, he turned fractionally towards Linnet, the room's only other occupant, and Harry had to move quickly to introduce them. By that time, the Ravenclaws were in the room, and Sophia was presenting a wide-eyed blond girl with a placid smile as Luna Lovegood.
Harry crawled up Draco's limp form, kissing here and there as he went, and lingering at Draco's neck while Draco caught his breath.  He lay back, and Draco curled over him, a leg splayed comfortably over Harry's thighs. For several minutes, they lay there, just breathing.
Draco, however, had other plans. By the time Harry joined him on the platform, he had a sixth-year girl by his side. After a moment of confusion, Harry placed her as the girl that had been with Zabini and the aggressive boy -- Cecil something, or maybe something Cecil -- last spring.
The visit was unremarkable in any way Harry could define, but he could see how Remus was watching Draco, even while the Quiris charmed him. In return, Draco watched him, but had little to say afterwards, except that Lupin had been better to him as a person than to him as a Slytherin student.
"It was a means to determine if my concern was warranted, and I gave you a warning that should have been sufficient if it was not. Quite honestly, I was more concerned about the Dark Arts."
They had reached the end of the things Harry had agreed to talk about, and he had managed to keep from saying that Sirius was an animagus, even though that had been harder than he had expected. He hoped Tonks gave him the antidote right away.
"He's in all my classes except Symbology, on Tuesday and Thursday," Harry said. "But I have that slot free -- the second lesson after lunch -- on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and he's in Ancient Runes, then. Could we meet just before the last lesson of the day?"
Confused, Harry turned and looked at her. "Why on earth would I?" he asked, surprised into normal volume.
"For a few minutes," Harry said. "Then we talked about your mother, and then about Death Eaters, and then he had me practice casting spells with his wand."
Luna beamed. "Oh, that's easy! I admire Professor Snape's creative precision, although I think it's a pity that he mostly uses it to insult people."
Still, he whispered the words. Malfoy would change back in two hours at the most -- possibly less if he'd significantly diminished his dose by spitting at Harry. This, Harry decided, would be a good time to leave: no foolish attempts to talk, and Malfoy still a pretty, half-familiar girl. The string of awkward questions in the back of his head could stay there. When they met in class next week, Malfoy was even less likely to want to acknowledge this than he was.
That left Harry trying to find a way to ease the tension, while not being boring. That probably meant choosing something outrageous that he had done himself.
There was a tickle of motion across his collarbone as Susara, coiled comfortably around his neck, raised her head.
Draco sniggered. "It was half to rile the Professor, but yes -- I'd know my Harry from a kiss. The last one was awful. I knew something was wrong right away."
"So she creeped you out too, huh?" Harry asked. "At the end?" He had recognized where they were, now -- between the shed and the bushes at the edge of the park. He pushed his way out into the sunlight, Snape following behind him. A vaguely familiar woman stared at them, wide-eyed. "Crap!"  he said at a whisper, looking down at his robes.
The professors glanced at them in passing, but Snape’s warning glower was the closest it came to interaction, at least until Petunia’s stiff form had rocked down onto a cot, legs mercifully obscured by Snape’s robes.
He shrugged. He could feel his form about to take hold, and had to stay alert through it -- he didn't distrust her, really, but he didn't
"Exactly. It probably did. But what mattered more to us at the time was that in return for Mother's concession, Professor Flitwick let you go to the Quidditch shop with me, and I bought you a book on the basics of the game, and on the First of September, I waited for you at Kings Cross."  Draco's mouth quirked. "
Angrily, Ron looked up. "Drop it, Harry," he said sharply. "I know my limits. I'm not the best you've got. Ginny's been faster on her broom for at least a year. I'll just have to settle for being the second Weasley not to make the house team."  He grimaced down at his book. "Me and Percy. Ugh."
"Draco?" Harry asked. Narcissa's girlish humor had drained his indignation to mere annoyance, and the strain of wandless magic was belatedly making itself felt. "Want a go?"
"Of course I did," Draco retorted placidly. "I can buy a shrinking chess set whenever I wish; replacing Harry would be impossible."
Draco nodded, and turned the bowl halfway around. "Are you going to help?" he asked Harry before starting his strokes again, and Harry, belatedly, began to darken the stone. As practice, he let the color flow into Draco's manipulation of the marble, so that it spread out in smooth curves like ripples.
"Hm. Because I don't like you looking like you might find an evisceration mildly amusing. Do you think you're done?"
"A few weeks ago, yes. I was surprised to see him presented in April." Snape hesitated. "However, I was far more surprised to discover that he was unwilling."
"Not if you stay back." Snape's voice was muffled by the fabric. "The fumes will have warmed enough by the time they reach you. Now wait. This stage requires my concentration."
For a long moment, she held his gaze, but then, without visible reservation, nodded. "All right, Harry. I trust your judgment."
Draco cleared his throat. "So," he said firmly.  "Everyone is to be on their best behavior next week."
"Right. He's angry at me, and altogether furious at Slytherin." Which was inconvenient in more ways than one, Harry thought.  Ron would no doubt relent after a week or two, but the brewing would have covered for the curse that he had cast. Draco would know he couldn't meet the Quiris after making that potion. "On the other hand, he can get over things just as abruptly as he gets angry. Maybe I should prepare the potion anyway."
"Of course. Ill-supervised Gryffindors."  Draco's voice had crept up to a quiet conversational level. Harry nudged him.  "Think she was told something?" he said quietly.
"You two should come," Harry said coaxingly. "What if I take you down there tomorrow? No, not tomorrow -- I have a meeting with McGonagall. Wednesday. I can introduce you to people."
"Yes, of course. He had started to prepare him the previous summer. He spent much of August instructing Draco in Dark Arts."  Narcissa sighed. "Including, I am afraid, at least one of the Unforgivable curses. When Draco had ...
With another replicated stroke up his own cock, Draco One brought Harry to the brink of orgasm -- again.
"Here," Draco said again, taking both of Harry's hands and tugging as he folded his legs under him. On the ground, he shifted from having both legs to one side to crossing them in front of him.  Harry was disappointed to see that they were barely smudged, but he arranged himself to mirror Draco's pose.
Harry stopped with one cuff done, trying not to stare or to growl. "Probably," he admitted. "Maybe less if you were happy about it."
Blaise moved close. "The pure metals are often useful in isolating component substances of a potion, for the same reason that they're not good for most standard brewing. Pewter is not only strong, but magically stable, while individual substances may have an affinity or discordance for an element such as copper."
"But ... but ...  Hermione!" Ron stared at his erstwhile girlfriend. "You couldn't really -- You're joking."
Harry was laughing as they climbed into a waiting car -- an old grey banger whose mere presence must have given Uncle Vernon fits. Lupin, to his surprise, climbed into the driver's seat.
"Right," Harry answered, restraining his sarcasm to a twist of his lip. "Which is why Seamus is protective of me."
Snape drew himself up. "As the two of you have had your sport," he said coldly, "I thought that I might be excused."
"Professor Dumbledore informed a select group of ...  allies, after your parents' deaths. He felt it was critical information, and should not vanish should he die."
Narcissa gasped, and then finally tittered behind an upraised hand, the sound artificially bright. "Could you really? You didn't think of it in time?"
he had done to the formula, or what effect it was supposed to have. In theory, this was to not prejudice Harry and Draco's observations. In practice, Harry knew it to be another variable in the balance of power between them. He could send Snape back to Azkaban with a few choice words, but Snape could poison him at any moon ... if he became so miserable that he was willing to die himself.
"Er, we don't know any? But Madam Pomfrey taught Draco a cleaning charm, and Snape made me ask Remus for a book--"
When Harry woke again, his friends had left. Judging from the light coming in the windows, they were probably in lessons. Susara was coiled under his shirt, her head resting at the edge of his collarbone.
"Not guests," Harry objected. "It's everyone's room, not just ours. But yeah, the light strip had a bunch of people looking at it."
"Unfortunately." Draco reached out and touched the tip of Harry's nose. "We should wash up before dinner, and before
Harry shrugged, trying to look neither hurt nor concerned.  "Well, I enjoy your company. Let's leave it at that."
"That's a theory!" Draco brightened at the thought. "That might even dovetail with Aunt Andromeda's one. Perhaps that's
The next few days went by swiftly. Now that Millicent was better with glamours, Harry met her only on Tuesday and Thursday, for the walk down to Hagrid's, and on Sunday, for brewing. Sometimes he stayed to socialize during her lessons. They'd tromped out to change two salt licks the week before, and had some fun tossing bits of meat to the thestrals.  Millicent still couldn't see them, so it was a different experience for her.
"All right, then." Despite her posture, he held out his hand, his voice steady as his heart began to race. Had Sirius been caught? Killed? She looked horrified.
"Switching the apparator slows tracking," Sirius volunteered, with a grin. "Remus will lay a trail that would make a fox green with envy, and then he'll join us." He led the way in the door, ducking to clear the lintel, and into a little room.
"Why would they, though?" Ron asked. "Minister Ramsley has been trying to get support for tracking down Death Eaters, right?"
, but anyone who knows the password will be able to change them with a touch and the name of the color."
"For flexibility in shedding and assuming humanity," Snape said pedantically, but Draco's response was not academic.
"You'll help even people who have wronged you."  He turned to Snape. "However, it would be a reasonable precaution."
Friday's gathering was the most relaxed so far.  Apparently feeling less formal after the Quidditch players' early departures the week before, people trailed in over the course of an hour. When everyone was there, they took a minute to confirm the last week's nominees.
Draco blushed. "I realized that I've-- we've stopped--" He swung his legs down to sit up. "Because we cannot go places, we're always with friends or down here. Only our sexual activities are ones that we could not indulge in the public mixed house space.  I don't know what to do about it."
She put out her hand, and Harry, although conscious of each lost inch between them, still extended his arm in one steady motion. His dread spiked as her fingers closed around his wrist.
-- she hadn't waved, or even looked up -- but it didn't seem unlikely, so while he didn't wait, he dawdled, taking a book that was in danger of falling out of Sammy's bag, and then handing it back, and then fussing a little with his own. They weren't three steps down the corridor before Hermione burst out of the library.
"Of course it is, silly boy!" Her sparkling smile softened the words. "And a pleasure to see you, too, Jules. House means nothing here."
Harry drifted off and dreamed he was in an Aethonan race, and winning, the wind whipping in his face as he crossed the black lake, but it turned out he was on a Hippogriff, so they were going to disqualify him, and someone sent Grindelows shooting up from the lake to rip at his legs as they fell, and it burnt, and there were ribbons of blood, and –
"Yes, but--" Hermione's harsh exhalation was warm against his neck. "I don't want to be invited out of laziness. I sometimes worry that's all this is; I'm the girl that he
"Until next time you can't wait a few hours!" she retorted. Her face softened. "I should be back in my room anyway, as you pointed out last year."
"What?" Harry looked at the dragon, which was now crouched facing the cave entrance. "You can't do that! It has moving parts!"
"You fixate too much on Mr. Parkinson." Snape twirled his wand idly between his fingers. "I doubt that was their concern. The Dark Lord's vengeance is not questioned, whomever the target."
"Hm." Harry knew better than to be directly reassuring when Draco sounded so fragile. "I do like you hot."
"Well, the ball itself, yes, though only some of it seemed that way." Harry looked back down the stairs. "Look, want to go somewhere and talk about it?"
"I had inadequate time." Draco hesitated.  "I also thought it inadvisable to do so alone. You say yourself that cursebreaking is better done with a partner."
For a moment, Dumbledore was silent. When he spoke, his voice was querulous, as if he were puzzling over the matter. "You have never expressed any affection for your mother's relatives."
"Um..." Harry looked between them, searching for any sign that this was an elaborate joke. "That was real, too?"
"Good morning, darling." Narcissa's smile lasted through turning from Draco to Harry, and he murmured an awkward greeting. He was saved from having to make conversation by Draco, who gestured at her work as they sat.
"An appreciated accommodation, but still not what you were instructed to do. It would have been better if you had waited."
"That he'll do some unspecified thing for me at some unspecified time in the future. Nothing to worry about."
Hermione looked. Harry thought she might ask about Draco's scenario placing him as the buyer. "Is it possible Professor Dumbledore made a similar mistake?" she said, instead. "In Harry's--" She stopped at Draco's contemptuous sniff.
"All right enough to tell me to go away and let him sleep," Harry answered. "You know he doesn't always have breakfast on weekends."
"There are many spells which block off or enhance feelings in yourself or others -- jealousy, anxiety, recklessness, caution -- almost anything but hatred or love."
has agents throughout Europe, I realize, but you might be safe in South Africa, or Hong Kong, or Canada, or any number of other places where a British man might comfortably reside."
That shocked Harry out of his disappointment. "Lose? How can we lose? They followed Draco to your office!"
Harry stared at her. After a few seconds, he started to laugh. She joined him. "All right," he said. "I'll talk to him."
"Right." Seamus scooped his robes up off the floor and dropped them on still fastened as far as he bothered with on weekends.  "And I know you didn't eat
Snape snorted. "Your negotiating is as clumsy as your brewing, Potter. No, a school broom will suffice. I need frost-cleared Skyberries, but they won't be actively evading you." He looked Harry up and down. "You have your cloak already, for some reason...."
Millicent spat out the answer like a challenge. Hermione stumbled back. Her eyes widened, and Harry didn't think it was entirely from hearing Millicent use a word like "regimen."
"It's a Muggle fairy tale. There's a beautiful princess who is cursed to unending sleep, and to get to her and break the spell, the prince has to cut through brambles that grow back as he chops them.  I think he has a magic sword in some versions." Harry shrugged. "In others, he's just more persistent and faster than the ones who couldn't make it through."
She snorted. "True enough." Her body tensed, but she held her position, wand pointed away, as he clenched his teeth through the change, trying not to double over from the pain. In a few seconds, it had passed, and as he caught his breath, she slipped her wand into her sleeve, slightly hampered by not being able to see it. "Okay, Potter. Let's go inside."
"They won't. They have tried once and failed.  Whoever was watching will be more attentive now, and will have allies." He frowned. "Or do you think it was a feint? Are they trying to draw Sirius out?"
"May I ask a question now?" At Sophia's nod, she sat up straight. "You said, 'of the House you have most disparaged.' I don't think I have."
"Okay." Harry put an arm around Draco's shoulders and surveyed the room. The ivy had grown another several inches while they had talked, giving the rock pile the air of a scenic ruin.
Tuesday, when Harry's NEWT Potions lesson went until lunch, Professor Snape had him stay after. The look he got from Hermione was more warning than sympathy; Draco, his lips tight, tucked her arm in his to lead her politely away. Courtly attention from Draco, Harry mused as they departed, still tended to disarm her.
Draco demonstrated that he was listening by bursting out laughing. After a moment, so did Blaise and Gilbert.
"Naturally, these attacks would be upsetting to you, as they are to most of those who knew them -- indeed to any stranger with a sense of decency -- but they are not our first priority. We will do the best that we reasonably can. I have asked that no one risk his or her life in the effort -- although some of the old crowd may find that difficult to abide by."
"Today, we begin work on elementary Healing Potions.  You should all have read Chapters 1 and 2, and pages 58-65 of Chapter 3...."
"Oh!" Harry laughed. He shook down his beads and extended his arm. "Just about these. Let me tell you...."
"I saw you were back," Harry answered, "but it wasn't a good time." At a directing wave from Dumbledore, he settled in a chair by the fire. Dumbledore moved into the obliquely set one.  "But, yes. I did notice you were gone after the first attack on the graves. Are you managing the protections?"
"Not tonight," Draco said coolly, extracting his own cushion. "It will do no good to have you make a decision you don't understand."
"God, I love you," Harry said fiercely. "More than anyone can imagine." Wordlessly, he Summoned Draco's favorite blindfold -- the soft one lined with rabbit fur from Draco's first mindful kill -- from the bedroom.  For the moment, he set it on Draco's back, between his shoulder blades, as he contemplated Draco's clothing. It was sexy, having it bunched up like that, but it was also in the way, and he didn't want to need to assess the risk of strangulation while he played. With a soft unfastening charm, he undid Draco's buttons, and then spread his shirt to the sides, preserving the half-dressed look without all the awkwardness.
Draco nodded again. He hadn't expected Potter, who was all thunder and lightning and storm clouds, to be so sweetly reassuring to his boy. His plan was lost behind a fog of wondering if he might be kissed.
Harry shrugged, but relaxed enough to sit down. "Even if that's true, I don't believe you're surprised."
Draco undid the top fastener on his robes and straightened. "Oh, I don't think I mind." His fingers moved deftly down hidden hooks, making his robes gap over shirt and tie. There was nothing particularly special about either, to Muggle sensibilities, but they were sexy by virtue of usually being concealed.
Harry laughed. "Harry will do," he said smugly, and after a few transitional licks, went back to sucking Draco's cock, keeping his hand in place for a few tighter pumps.
They sat in silence for a moment, not quite looking at each other. Across the table, Neville was pointedly focused on spreading marmalade on toast, and Ginny was making little soothing motions at one or both of them.
To his embarrassment, Mrs. Weasley looked up just at that moment and their eyes met. He pretended they hadn't, and walked for the stairs, although he had intended to have lunch, and ignored his name being called behind him.
To Harry's surprise, Draco did not retort that Ron had already agreed to it. "There is one other option," he said instead.  Harry found his tone overly light.
Further down the field, he saw the Gryffindor contrivance get in a solid hit on Bulstrode. The secondary force of the explosion sent her flying backward. Crabbe stopped to stare, and was the next target. Nearby, Morgenstern changed her jacket to a soft mauve, and Vaisey turned his black. Harry was glad he had warned his team about possible color changes; this was going to be interesting.
There were a series of glances and shakes of heads. Luna raised her hand timidly, just up by her ear.
"Perhaps you had them by proxy," Draco said, striding quickly away from the walls and any potential open windows. "The second floor girls' bathroom?"
"Excellent. Nymphadora requested that I inform you that your mother is unharmed. However, she is now at Auror headquarters providing a description of the attack, so don't expect a response at home for a few hours."
Sunday, a number of the Slytherins left lunch early. When Harry saw Millicent crossing the floor after the others, he made his excuses and followed. She wasn't in sight when he stepped out of the Great Hall, but the blond Slytherin first-year girl was with her usual friend, just about to descend the stairs into the dungeon. Harry didn't remember the boy's name, but the girl's was hard to forget.
"Ha! Was that what that was about? Half the class was staring, and Neville had to look around and find me in the room before he stopped looking alarmed."
"You could have just said I was too sexy to ignore!" With a laugh, Sirius bounded up and through the curtain. For a moment, Remus hid his eyes.
Ron seemed to be considering it. He looked at the walls to either side, and then at each of them, his brow scrunched. "We're still here?" He shifted slightly away from his sister, who squeezed his hand, and then let it go. "Wait,
"Thank you," Draco said. "I'd like to try being your lover. I don't, though, want to be anyone's secret."
"Yes. And I had to live with Draco and Snape and Lucius, as someone Snape had raised from his eleventh birthday, and who was a complete
"We'll just make sure they're not first."  Sophia straightened in her chair. "I'll start. I've admired Ginny Weasley since last year, when I saw her walk up to Smith in the corridor, when he was trying to browbeat Sarah into going to Hogsmeade with him
Gilbert leaned forward. "You tricked a Slytherin?" he asked incredulously. He looked over at Draco. "Is that true?"
Harry picked up the rhythm. Malfoy seemed happy with the sensations now, and he thrust faster and harder, feeling his arousal building.
She sighed. "I know. At this rate, it will be Sunday afternoon before I can get to my N.E.W.T. revision."
"Yeah, I saw that." Harry sighed. "I actually tagged your folder as a potential pattern of harassment, if it helps."
* In a Wednesday night extra-credit Cursebreaking session, Draco is attempting to break some curses his father set on a Pensieve between Draco's defection and the trial.
He didn't. Draco had said she was a neutral, but that didn't make her an ally. He didn't doubt she could get a good deal of money for betraying him. On the positive side, money didn't seem to be what motivated her. He thought over everything she had said, trying to get a grasp on what did.
"I suppose I'd better get my shopping done today, then," Harry said lightly, trying not to show his relief.
-- they could have been hurling shoes at each other.  However much he tried to picture that, he instead found himself picturing Hermione undressing Malfoy, or wrapped up in one of Malfoy's shirts. It was on the second time through this vision that he realized he was picturing
Snape sniffed at Harry's astonishment. "Why shouldn't I? It's similar to brewing potions, except with fewer Flobberworms."
"Hi," Harry said. "I know you just woke up, but it's evening. Is curry okay? I have tikka masala, and biryani, and three kinds of bread. Oh," he added casually, "and a decent wine."
Harry was up early the next morning, with the squirming feeling in his stomach that usually preceded Quidditch matches, not a meeting with a friend. In the Common Room, he saw Sajid, and Davey, and Yolanda -- who gave him a cheery wave, but didn't leave off her conversation with Evie. He was surprised how many people were about at this hour, and even more surprised when Hermione, rather than emerging from her room, came in through the portrait hole.
He tried to catch up to her discreetly, but she was taller, and moving with an open stride, and two flights down, he was barely closer to her than he had been.
"He was hard when he came to you. You might not have been able to see, but I could. So he might not admit that he wanted your attentions, but logically, I have to believe that he did."
"I can't see that he'd care," Zabini retorted.  His look grew more wistful as he studied Harry. "But maybe he does for you."
Harry shrugged. "He's still the sole heir, right?"  He recalled how he had gone to Gringotts polyjuiced as one of the twins. That hadn't been a problem. "The goblins don't care."
People began to look at each other and whisper, and Draco crossed the room to settle between Harry and Ginny. "Budge over, love," he whispered.
After the door closed behind them, Snape shook his hair back, shoulders settling, and set off at a brisk walk. Harry had to jog to catch up.
Harry nodded absently while counting in his head. He had only a fortnight, and he expected to be hiding for some of that. "What could you teach me?"
"No, no!" Harry exclaimed. "No, let's see -- this is for falling asleep in the library, and--" He ran a finger over the beads looking for something else harmless -- "and
"I can't really hear how it sounds," Harry admitted. "To me, it just sounds like sort of hissy English."
"Yes! The hedge would vanish before us as we left.  Well, if it worked with a man. I mean, it might require reproductive sex. It works for a man if the heir is a woman."
When he arrived at breakfast early enough, Harry had taken to looking over Hermione's shoulder at the morning paper. When he didn't, she would usually pass it to him between morning lessons. On Monday morning, when the post owl dropped the rolled
"Quite," Snape said, momentarily haughtily. "Though when I ran into Mr. Bulstrode, while shopping during the summer, he was apologetically friendly -- without actually apologizing, of course. I suspect he was not as displeased as his wife."
As Draco had instructed for the morning, Harry was dressed in the most informal clothing he had brought.  Not that that it was precisely normal, he thought, looking down at the pristine jacket, shirt and trousers. Upon consideration, he realized that it wasn't exactly unusual now, either; Draco had changed him in that way. He was looking at the door, wondering whether to venture out, when he heard a knock.
smoke." He looked off into the distance, his expression somber. "I don't suppose..." He shot her a quick, guilty look. "Um, that Ron stayed in this one?"
"Hm. Targeted variation of the Cypher charm?" Harry vaguely remembered the name from second year, but he wasn't sure he had ever cast it.
"Good," Sirius said with a sharp nod. "A quiet baby is trouble later, or so well-meaning ladies used to tell your Mum."
Draco sighed dramatically. "Dear Merlin! Come sit down and tell me what happened. It was Millicent's impression that she had Hermione's sympathy."
For a moment, Harry thought Snape would strike him down with the Cruciatus curse. The professor stretched up and breathed out through his teeth.
Snape drew himself up. "It does, however, mean that outside of school, he is subject to no one else's whims. We discussed this with Professor Dumbledore,
"Because then no one wins," Ron answered, pricking Harry's finger neatly. "And I want Harry to win, of course."  He moved Harry's hand back and forth as he doled out drops of blood, as if he were dealing cards, or counting down who was 'it' for a game. Harry didn't think he was much more affected than he had been by the early divination.  Probably this was going to be the 'beer and sunlight' sort of reaction.
“He offered it like a sweet; a secret family curse – one he would pass on to me if I applied myself.”
"14th July, Nineteen-ninety-seven, special meeting of the Wizengamot, Special Inquisitor Cabot presiding. The Wizengamot will now hear this case."
Ron blinked. Harry set a hand on his shoulder. "Don't worry about it. No one expects you to lie. Just let me see you safe back to the dormitory, okay?"
The laughter of the Slytherins had a touch of hysteria to it, as if he had said something dirty. Hugh hissed at Daphne, who was hanging on his words. Pansy ignored them to glare at Harry.
Padma was next, and used "I've never raised my hand in a lesson when I didn't remember the answer yet."  She, Hermione, Hannah, Blaise, and Luna colored beads a dark teal.
"Well, he knows that you took me to the seer, of course. If you're willing to consult with me on divinatory potions, may I let him know?"
"You're so hot," he whispered. "May I...?" He didn't finish the question, but instead nudged Draco onto his back, and began to kiss down his body. Draco moaned.
He went looking, but again, he was disappointed. The charges had stemmed from a raid on an escort service which was known to play both sides of the law. All the individuals they had made payments to were charged, but only a few of those charges stuck. Malfoy, in particular, had insisted that the bank transfer to him was in payment for cosmetic potions. There had been nothing to indicate otherwise, and the charges had been dropped -- no, allowed to expire. However, the red stain of an index charm marked the conclusion, and touching that pulled the corners of two other sheets out of the stack. One was the sale of a cursed tiepin that Malfoy claimed he had not realized was in the lot of items offered to an estate dealer. The dealer likewise protested innocence, and -- again -- the charge was dropped. This time, a curse breaker had testified that someone not affected by the curse -- i.e., a member of one of the old British wizarding families -- could easily fail to notice it. The other was a second application -- this a recent one for testers in Questionable Substances, rejected by Angelina with the note "will not be able to uphold a professional image."
Harry chuckled. "Okay. Um, do you think that made it easier for random people to believe you'd been working for him?"
Harry hesitated. That was a point. "Recognize, yes," he said. "Know to keep their kids in, though? To not walk alone daydreaming, with a wand to be grabbed?"
"Oh." Ron blushed. "Well, Bill was home for Christmas, and he came over to visit a couple of times. Spent an hour holed up with Bill and Mum -- don't know what that was about -- but after that, we all went out and tossed around a Quaffle. He's not bad on a broom!"
In contrast, Harry's shrug was pure nonchalance, dismissing the issue.  "You can compete just as well with women, I'm sure."
Harry snorted. "Right. Look, come in, will you? We need perfect coil springs, and mine always flatten somewhere."
but that put him in mind of the Imperius Curse, and he forced himself to wake, determined to deal with whatever danger threatened.
He sighed dramatically. "Really! In any sensible world you'd be a Ravenclaw. Everyone says so. How do you manage to be a Gryffindor in three?"
Draco laughed slightly and leaned into him. "Oh, you did pretty well. Just need training up, I think."
"Back to the Cauldron?" Harry suggested, and Draco nodded agreement. Tonks brought them to a private grate and flooed ahead.
The room was silent. Suddenly afraid that he had said too much, Harry looked nervously at Tonks. To his relief, she smiled and gave him a little nod. "Well," she said, "
The first arrival was actually Ron, who stumbled awkwardly to a stop just past the end of the corridor. Harry looked over from contemplating the ivy-covered rock pile, and for few seconds, they just stared at each other.
Harry clamped his mouth shut, squirming with the answers that wanted to come out -- at Darkmoon Den, with Remus Lupin--
The ground was soft as carpet under his front foot. He felt that before he saw the roses. They climbed an arbor in midsummer glory, soft white against glossy green. The ground, when he looked down, was thick moss, soft and springy beneath them. Draco held his hand.
The crowd around him fell back, and Hecksban was there. He was clever -- couldn’t he help more? Hermione was arguing now. “No spells,” Draco shouted, and Hecksban moved from advising to commanding, and Hermione …
Stroking his beard, Dumbledore nodded slowly. "Clearly, these short segments -- left for me anonymously, as I said -- were intended to paint you in a bad light." His visage darkened. "However, I can think of no context that would ameliorate writing Voldemort's true name in the Slytherin Common Room."
"Hm. One of that group is, and another is Wizard-born -- I don't know details beyond that. The others -- two brothers -- have a Muggle mother and Wizard father."
As Harry watched, his mouth descended to Malfoy's cock. Harry watched his tongue lick up it, and his lips closed on the tip, pushing down further once, twice, three times before he lifted his head.
She leaned back against her desk, hands gripping the edge by her hips. "What do you think I should do?"
"Hm." Millicent's small eyes darted from person to person. Harry wondered what she was evaluating. Seamus had the fewest beads, with one, but Blaise and most of the girls had only two. Draco was only missing only the green he gave to Harry, giving him five. Cornelia, Gilbert, and Harry had three.
Here's a nice long chapter for you! The next one may not be as quick; the scenes as plotted need reordering, and I also intend to start posting Blood Magic.
"What Harry is not saying," Draco drawled, as they crossed into the dining room, "is that we practiced that technique only with a marker hex."
Draco stepped towards him. "And we might, you realize, find reasonable compromises to all those things, even were they all true."
Harry felt cold again. He could know any number of people that Shacklebolt would not expect him to. Gilbert, Linnet... He was suddenly aware that more people had dark hair than not.
Harry threw himself at the man and wrapped his arms around him, only the barest thought going to keeping his wand pointed away from them.  "God.
"No, and not all of it works," Harry said, leading Ron and Draco around the curve and into the wide space beyond. "It should be twice as bright as it is, in here. I need someone who can figure out the charm work to fix the one on the other side."
"Yeah, but what if I just take a flask of polyjuice and leave for the day? I can go the zoo, or something."
Listening to them together, Harry wasn't sure how he'd missed their connection. Of course.... "I haven't seen much of you together."
As it turned out, Ron was not only out of bed, but out of their house. On the landing above the fourth floor, Harry saw a flash of red hair above, and, when he turned back for the next flight, Ginny and Ron coming down. Ginny scowled when she saw him.
Harry frowned. "If Dumbledore's people lose track of her.... Well, possibly. But I get the impression that protectors as staying as close as they can, considering."
"So, we don't actually know if I know this, because casting it at the wall doesn't do anything." Harry was sure of that. He didn't feel any different.
By the time he had finished two cups of pumpkin juice and one of water, three slices of toast, an egg, some mushrooms, and a rasher of bacon, Harry felt almost normal, except for when he moved his head too quickly.  Hermione was another issue. She was friendly, but so ready to agree with anything he said that it made Harry uncomfortable. Fortunately, no one else was paying them much attention. Ron was sitting some distance down the table, ignoring both of them, and Ginny was with him, apparently in a huff. Seamus and Parvati were talking to each other, and glancing over only now and then, perhaps to be sure that Harry was eating. When he was full, Harry excused himself and left the table. He wasn't at all surprised to have Draco catch him in the hallway.
"A Snitch, with randomization and evasion charms presumably deactivated. It's also a portkey," Tonks replied.
She spilled black sludge into his mouth. It was slimy, but tasted like lemons, and someone else was walking through the wall, or what had been a wall, before wall, person, and the legs of his chair began to spiral down into a tunnel of fog. He floated away.
"You know what we should do?" Parvati said brightly, forestalling the need. "We should play some sort of parlor game, for getting to know each other better."
Ignoring the things confessed to Tonks in that exchange, Harry pressed on. "So, I suppose what I really want to know is what Hufflepuffs value," he explained. "What did you admire in each other?"
"Right, that! He showed me his name like this."  Harry wrote on the hearth in front of the Slytherin fireplace:
"Sirius! His father -- Lucius -- is trying to disinherit him! He's risking a lot more than he's comfortable with, and he's worked with Hermione, and he
"Stop him! Do you love me or don't you?" The second spiraled into and out of Draco's head, making his eyes glow briefly.
After a breakfast that he stretched out as long as he dared, Harry found himself heading back up the stairs to Gryffindor tower. He hoped that Ron was out of bed when he got there.
Draco tsked and sat regally in an armchair. "Yes, spellfather. We were tremendously impatient for your charming--"
"Just resting," Harry claimed. He hadn't done anything to get ready for bed, after all, except for discarding his clothes -- well, some of them. He curled up to struggle out of his t-shirt. "Wow. I'd planned on something a little more...."
He sat when Harry did, setting the notebook -- actually a folder, Harry saw now -- carefully on his lap, and then pulling off his gloves.  "Now tell me -- Malfoy Manor? Why were you there?"
"Oh dear!" The corners of her eyes wrinkled, betraying the smile she covered with one hand. "None, fortunately." Shyly, she glanced down. "I'm sorry I made things so hard on you. I should trust you more."
Harry smiled, even as he prepared himself to argue. "So your point is that I should accept that I don't get a list of names?"
good," Draco said softly. At the praise, Harry tried to stretch a little further, but he couldn't get much more than the head into his mouth, even though Draco continued to hold that down. It wasn't entirely one-sided -- with his free hand, Draco had reached back and was rubbing Harry's erection through his clothing -- but it was painfully awkward. Draco kept him straining there for at least another minute before tilting forward on his hands. Relieved, Harry dropped back and took him deeper. It still wasn't the best angle -- the end bumped bluntly into the roof of his mouth, and it was difficult to keep his teeth out of the way -- but at least it was easier on his neck.
Carla and Hannah had moved to the loveseat between Neville and Ginny’s small sofa and the larger one that Millicent was sharing with Cornelia. That side of the room seemed a bit too Gryffindor to Harry, but as he scanned through, he decided that was partially due to a protective buffer around Dean – Seamus was with him, of course, so he and Parvati were there, rather than on a mixed sofa with Padma, and Ron had sat on Dean’s other side.
Remus had to smile at that, even if it was a bit ragged at the edges. "So it does. Hm. Or perhaps our place via the Shrieking Shack. Can you take three Side-Along Apparations, Harry? I'd like to muddy our tracks a bit."
Arched back, eyes closed, he heard Draco starting to follow and forced his eyes open to see. Draco's hand was a blur on his cock, and his mouth wide open.
"You're cheery today," Hermione commented as she took a helping of carrots. "Was the visit with Professor Snape just to discuss your official project?"
"Great!" Harry exclaimed, much to his embarrassment. "That is-- I was afraid I wouldn't know anyone." He wondered if Draco had realized that and invited some of their mutual friends for his benefit.
Hesitantly, he opened the door. Tuktuk's golden fur shone in the light of the magical window, and she turned in the air as she jumped lightly down, ending with the tuft of her tail quivering above her maned face. She trilled querulously. With a moan of relief, Harry went inside.
Harry found himself starting to grin. Parvati reached across the table to catch his hand in a tight squeeze. Students who had been unaware of the request began to murmur to each other.
"Yes," Hermione said. "That's the second time you've lost focus, and we just sat down. You liked my chicken tagine, last I knew."
. The new Minister for Magic, Gilbert Ramsley, had appointed him as Special Inquisitor, within weeks of Ramsley taking over from Fudge. The post reminded Harry of Crouch, which did not incline him kindly towards Cabot. To the Special Inquisitor's right sat Minister Ramsley, and to his left, Amelia Bones.
"Even before..." She looked away, to the darkening window. "No, perhaps not. I was thinking of Andy -- my former sister -- but I think Sirius and Regulus were close as well."
in Malfoy's dormitory. They were close together, this time, facing each other, with the labels sometimes overlapping. He scowled. After several minutes of frowning thought, he threw on his invisibility cloak and set out for the kitchens.
Draco set his spread fingers to his forehead. "It was my understanding," he said, the precise words muted by his hand, "that you resigned the Quidditch team captaincy today?"
He laughed, only afterwards realizing that she had tensed at her own cheek. "All right," he said. "But only because I think this is costing us good people."
"I see." Draco crossed his arms over his chest. "So whilst I am heartsick over this, you are not certain that you love me after all."
sorry," he said sincerely. "I'll try to think ahead more, rather than sending you out all the time. I do need the silk, though, and I have N.E.W.T.s and E.F.T.T.s to revise for, you know." He punched Draco encouragingly in the shoulder.  "Just think! Next year, I'll be gone, and you'll have a boy to run errands for
"Ah, but it can be a symbolic birth -- the birth of a spell, of a plot, of..." Draco stopped and shrugged. "Anything."
"But if he's the top boy in our class, that doesn't matter so much, does it?" Harry retorted. "Especially if the headmaster is pleased with him now."
The defense questioned Dumbledore as to who had cast the Cruciatus curse, and while he said that he believed that it was Lucius Malfoy, he of course had not seen the curse cast. Draco had already been on the floor of his office before he had caught his first glimpse of the interlopers. He did use that word, and Harry, for the first time, began to appreciate the potential value of the trespassing charge.
"You may have seen me working with Professor Dumbledore during the rebuilding last spring.  Combining forces for Transfiguration is a difficult matter ... but easier if the people involved have an affinity for each other. Rather than attempting to imitate Mr. Malfoy's talent, then, I suggest you balance it.
By mutual agreement, they shifted to align their bodies more effectively. Malfoy rubbed against Harry's arse with long, deliberate rocks of his hips.
"Right. But I'm close. I know who the professors are. I know who you are, although I can't--" He spoke through Malfoy's gasp -- "I couldn't tell you an actual story about us; I just have a general sense of it. And I don't remember any sex other than last night."
"No. Um...." Harry looked at the passageway, but didn't hear anyone else coming in. "I'm sure you've all seen that rot in the Daily Prophet about how Vold -- Tom Riddle -- that's Voldemort; I've decided to use his real name -- is attacking my parents' graves so he can place some kind of curse on me." The room fell silent.  Harry pressed on. "Can't be done. However, he might be able to do me some damage through my mother's sister, who's alive -- that's according to Snape and Hecksban both."
Harry rolled his eyes and squeezed Draco a little. "Maybe if you found a more private spot for your snogging sessions, you wouldn't need to be offended by random passersby."
They cast dusting spells on every section of the entry and meeting space, and sent the dust deep into the piled rocks that filled the passageway beyond. Afterwards, Harry tried conjured water and a scrubbing spell on an area of the wall.
"But it may help him to feel included," Draco argued. "Let's. Not too much, as you say; I wouldn't want him to feel tricked. I'll make a carafe, and we can pour off most of the less expensive cognac to leave here, and then bring enough for each of us to have a glass."
He looked steadily back into her anger. "Of course.  Harry's life depends on defeating the Dark Lord. Ours as well, as known allies."
Harry smiled. "Yeah. You are. Show off for me. Elegant lady, tart, whatever. Want to see you stroll."
things. I don't think she's ever had to think about anything more important than House points or meeting potential husbands." She stooped to pick up a stick and began tapping the side of her thigh with it as she walked, as if she were riding a distracted horse. "I'm not saying Draco doesn't love you -- he does, of course, but Slytherins can value a move that benefits their side, even at personal risk. If we were really all about every man for himself, You-Know-Who wouldn't have half the followers he does."
Dumbledore's eyes widened. A moment later, the corner of his mouth turned up in a smile. "Of course you do, Mr. Potter," he said, placing a hand on Harry's shoulder. "And I will see to it that you get one, although it may not be one you can relay to everyone that you left breakfast with this morning."
Draco shrugged gracefully. "Possibly. They do decrease my options in some ways, but they expand them in others -- I doubt there is any other way I would have the headmaster's trust -- and that is arguably of more current value than the option of using Dark Arts." He shrugged. "Though I rather miss sitting with Severus in the evenings, even if we hardly said a word to each other.
By unspoken agreement, they moved to sit down, with Harry leaving the pear tart behind. He sat in the middle of the comfy sofa, and was surprised to have Blaise take the end that Draco didn't. Perhaps that had blown over. Hermione levitated another large sofa into place across from them, just a few feet away, and dropped into it straight across from Harry. With only a wry twist of her lip, Millicent sat beside her. Ron was the only one who looked uncomfortable as he took the remaining place across from Draco. He set an arm around Hermione, to tug her close -- and perhaps further from Millicent, Harry thought -- but she absently twisted free and leaned forward to view the bottle that Harry was pulling from his school bag.
"Well, and something about the way he made it end went wrong. Believe me, I was utterly passive all night. Draco was terrified."
is why we don't get anywhere!" Harry said hotly. "You think it's a virtue not to negotiate or compromise, or even to figure out
"Oh, it would most likely survive. They're not as affected by Wizard magic as we are." Ignoring Harry's scowl, he smiled disarmingly at the Professor. "But it would offend Harry, which might cause more trouble than setting off the curse, at least with people around me to help."
After putting on the Hexacles, Justin didn’t speak, but he let out a sharp little hiss, as if he had been burnt. He returned to his desk in silence, and began scribbling notes as soon as Susan stepped away.
With the slightest of shrugs, Gilbert, behind her, met Harry's eyes and smiled. Harry felt his shoulders settle with relief. He hadn't realized how tense the isolation had made him.
"As Head Girl and Head Boy," Draco said, "we represent the students in general, as well as the two houses most closely tied to the matter."
Eric laughed. "That was a month before I started Hogwarts, and I think they were relieved they didn't have to keep coming up with reasons for why I was going away, and why he couldn't come to London for my school shopping."
"Horsyr's, I think. It's not permanent -- she just wasn't sure they'd be safe where she was traveling, so she only took the older two, who have more control and are easier to conceal."  He bit his lip for a moment. "And she said Cheefi didn't want to leave me.  I may regret it, but I had been missing them in advance, and she asked me in front of them, so of course I jumped at the chance."
He had nearly finished the answers that were due the next morning in Potions -- which were not entirely untouched earlier, despite what he had told Ron and Hermione -- when the door opened. Seymour, his shoulders set back as firmly as a warrior's, led in a reluctant-looking Ruthven. Harry wanted to help, but thought he might be a hindrance.
Harry felt a hot flash of anger at the memory of the two labels overlapping at their forward edges. "How does he kiss?"
The offer knocked the breath out of him as effectively as a Bludger. It was generous, he knew. It was also, most likely, a negotiation with Draco through him. He shook his head.
"I think even the first years can learn," Harry said, although he wondered if Dean was talking about himself, at the end, "but not in a vacuum." He shrugged. "Or maybe I'm not qualified to say. I never believed the Dursleys, because that would have meant believing I was inherently an unnatural, disgusting person...." He bit his lip. "Maybe I did believe that, when I was very young, but --"
"Snape is going to kill me," Malfoy muttered to himself. More audibly, he added: "Yes. I'll explain that it was an emergency."
."  The man gestured vaguely to the side, where Harry could just spot the brilliant blue of Linnet's gown. "With those schoolmates you were speaking with?"
"If you were not both my students...." Snape's voice said.  Harry wondered if he would mind. Later, maybe. Before he could decide, the door clicked shut.
The man's eyebrows, which were thick and tangled, came up. Harry got the feeling that they didn't do that often. Indeed they descended back into a scowl almost immediately.
"But Harry has a point," Millicent said. "Here, how about we just don't ask questions about the war?"
"I think Mudbloods are rather interesting," piped up one of the fifth- or sixth-year boys. The one next to him twitched.
Professor Dumbledore chucked.  "As I said, she is quite old-fashioned, and I say this as someone many years her senior. But she was a girl, once, and her experiences then, perhaps, reinforced this idea of waiting for the one you would remain with."
"I'll move back a little for you, shall I?"  Draco murmured, inching up so that his bollocks were nearly out of reach, but his cock looked perfectly positioned. Harry couldn't really see what Draco was doing, but he could feel the soft play of his mouth, and he moaned as he took Draco's cock back into his own. Jutting down at this angle, he found, it was easy to take deep -- if anything, too easy. He didn't think he would have been able to keep from choking if he wasn't desperately horny. Draco, at least, seemed to have dropped his leisurely play, and as Harry moved faster, he kept time, the warm grip of his mouth squeezing up and sliding down Harry's shaft. He whimpered too, which always drove Harry mad, because it was Draco being
Dumbledore looked gratifyingly startled, and Remus almost abashed. Harry was impressed by the craft of that lie, and had to work not to show it.
Draco's eyes closed and his color heightened. "I... Yes. I'd want him to hear you command me, though. To know it was
It could have been worse. Harry hazarded a look at Dumbledore, whose face was impassive, while his past self continued to talk. "Then he rearranged the letters -- I don't know how to do that -- to say 'I am Lord Voldemort'. Told me he wouldn't use the name of his Muggle father."
Draco tsked. "If it was easy, the magic wouldn't be strong. You'll have to work at it, but I'm confident you can manage."
"Calm down, Potter, will you?" Draco pushed his hair back. "Harry. Have you considered confronting Dumbledore? Tell him it's Hogwarts or nothing? Or the Weasel's place, if you'd rather."
"Not yet." Harry sat up in his chair. "I did get the list of approximate questions, though, after classes today -- I was called to Dumbledore's office, because I had to sign a contract for it. They're what we agreed on."
"As I expect you have surmised," Dumbledore said, his eyes twinkling over his spectacles at Harry, "Auror Tonks is a trusted associate of mine. She has some matters to discuss with you, and you may be frank with her about all things -- even those you might normally be reluctant to share with the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Furthermore, I have already given my permission for an invitation she intends to extend, so you are free to decide that matter upon personal merits alone."
"We'll get to Two. Anyway, she saw what I did with the sword, and heard what I said, and said afterwards I seemed a little disoriented, but that made sense. Harry Three did know about Horcruxes, though, and knew exactly what he was doing in a tent in the woods, and she thought he was me, until he started demanding to know what she had done with his cigarettes."
Harry made it back to Gryffindor an hour before it was time for dinner. Carrying the bag everywhere did feel ridiculous. When he spotted Ginny over by the window, talking to Cornelia, he went over to join them.
Hermione winced. "I don't think that's all of it," she said reluctantly. "The chromatic monocular is showing a very spiky luminescence in the solution I isolated in iron.  I don't know what it is yet, but it's definitely magically active."
that you are playing with so cavalierly, and a student in my house." Snape leaned close enough that Harry could smell fish on his breath from breakfast. "As Madame Pomfrey related her suspicions about
He turned his back to her, apparently thinking her harmless without the wand. Arching up, she reached above her head and seized the hilt of the sword. In one move, she lurched to her feet and at him, swinging wildly.  She saw his eyes widen in alarm and his arm come protectively up, even as he fumbled for the wand he had just put away. With a sickening crunch and jerk of her grip, the blade hacked into his arm and then rebounded in a spray of blood.  His shriek of pain cut off without warning.
He paused at another picture of their mysterious young man, and then shook his head. He was distracted; this was someone else. He had darker, curlier hair, and a rounder chin. But even as Harry listed the differences, he saw what had caught his eye: that fleeting lost look, replaced by hard scorn. Hair color could be changed even without magic, and glamour or creams could soften the lines of a face. Mannerisms were harder to change, especially ones keyed to emotion.
"Why not?" Susan interjected. "We have a pact to conceal ourselves from Muggles; why shouldn't the Fey conceal themselves from us?"
Harry considered it for a second. The glasses had been quite small. His hand tightened on the arm of the chair. "No thank you."
"Would you?" Harry teased, sliding his thumb in. Draco took him too often to need this much care, but Harry didn't want to let him up, just yet.
Draco snorted. That, he could believe. "You're still responsible for getting here on time," he said, deliberately looking Thornton over.  "I don't see any sign that you hurried."
On Sophia's other side, Hannah shifted, pulling her hair a little more in toward her face. "Um, we've
you can compliment me on it." He wiggled back against Harry as he spoke, which was reassuring. Harry took two steps back. The current branch was apple, and almost to the low end of the mound. A pile of four- to six-inch sticks next to that would probably be more flowers to fill small gaps.
"Of course not!" Harry decided that he shouldn't let on about Snape. Maybe Dumbledore might have chastised him with it? "I was
"Will it happen, though?" Ruthven asked.  "It's always been restricted. Why would Dumbledore do that now?"
"Yours," he said, his face flushed red, one hand twisting in the sheets while the other worked his cock. Or maybe it was "more." Harry was too far gone to ask, and when one of those hands reached up to twist at his right nipple instead, he cried out in surprise and fell past thought, hammering forward and roaring as he came.
"You were still in the Great Hall," Harry snapped back. "I thought it could wait until this afternoon, since we have plans anyway. I was hardly going to talk about it in the corridor."
They continued on, more eagerly than before, cleaning sections of wall until the floor was slick with water and they had to vanish it or get their socks wet.
"Course," Harry answered, standing up. He grinned at Seamus, who was trying unsuccessfully to muffle a laugh, and Parvati who was managing an almost convincing concerned expression. "Catch you two later."
While dishes were appearing, Harry looked up at the high table. Snape was there. It took a moment before Harry realized what was wrong; Snape was in the headmaster's seat. Maybe some things about this world were like his own. Though now that he thought about it, he hadn't heard anyone mention Voldemort, by any of his titles. He wished he had thought to look at the
"And then they found a game to play with his clothes, sir!" Dobby beamed. "And now, they is happy, sir, playing with Master Malfoy's clothes."
She frowned for a moment, thinking, and then surprised him by smiling at him. "That's really quite clever."
Harry thought he would have liked to have seen that -- Draco in bare feet and robes. He had the urge to demand that Draco remove his boots immediately, but decided it would be too distracting.
"I think I've been cursed," Harry said. Certainly he must have enemies here, even if they weren't the same ones? "I don't exactly remember things."
"Well." Malfoy stood up and sashayed across the room, the robes swaying with every roll of his hips. Harry could see the lines of his legs clearly through the gauzy fabric. Malfoy had more leg than was decent, possibly even before he had strapped on those silver stiletto heels. He turned at the far wall and posed. "So what do you think? Am I gorgeous?"
Millicent twisted away. When she spoke, her words were slow, as if she was still thinking them out.  "Sometimes people can get past a thing, or
"I see," he said finally. He looked around at his matching sofa and chairs. "I'll need to change some of the furniture.  It's a little too formal, I think. The banners still seem like a good idea.  You'll probably need to help me with the food."
Harry raised his torso, but couldn't help staring at Draco's soft trousers while he held that position. With the concealing drape of his shirt gone, it was obvious that Draco was hard beneath them. Harry felt a surge of panic. What if he didn't know what to do? What if he didn't like it, after all? He shook harder as he reached to touch. He had intended a caress, but it was with more a grab when his hand closed on that cloth-covered shaft.  Despite that, Draco closed his eyes and arched in apparent bliss.
"And Harry?" Seamus said, as they started down the stairs. "If you have a moment, what with trying to protect Muggles, Slytherins, firsties, dangerous magical creatures, and damn near everything else, you might take some care for yourself."
"Look," Harry puffed, "Uncle Vernon doesn't like strangers. Especially our kind. Or even, you know, Muggles that dress weird."
He had met it as a joke, but she turned away, shoulders slumped. He laid a hand on her back, settling it into the thick wool of her winter robe. "Hermione?" he whispered.
"More wandless magic?" Harry wasn't sure about doing that while staying still, but that reaction made him understand what Snape meant. If he had been the one petrified, would he still have been able to cast?
"I'm sorry," Ron repeated, his cheeks darkening as he spoke. "I ... I didn't expect you to be so -- you should have had a mirror!"
She was interrupted by the headmaster getting to his feet and tapping on his juice glass for silence.
Harry took a quick breath. "Can I curse Nott?"  he asked. "Not Theodore, I mean -- his uncle. If I can try to trace Voldemort through my blood, can I curse Theodore Nott's uncle through his?"
Hermione sighed and rubbed her eyes. "Harry... I don't know enough to say. You'd need to know who cast it. You'd need a proxy for the caster. You'd need some sort of reparations or reversal -- and again, for that, you need to know the circumstances of the curse."
Her head came up with a choking cough. "I'm sorry -- Did you just refer to the Head of the Pernicious Activities Division as 'Kingsley'?"
"You'll be fine," Draco said firmly.  "Harry will get you past everyone and up to your dormitory, and guard you until the visions stop. They're not real, and if one is, he'll protect you."
"It started with Draco, I think. The Slytherins do it fairly often. He says when the lake gets churned up by a storm, the common room gets chilly, at least in the corners away from the fire." Harry grinned. "I told him that's why the tower has no corners."
"Hm. Babbling Draught, I'd say. Pansy, darling, would this happen to be the glass that you offered my boyfriend?"
Hermione nodded, frowning. “We still probably should, just to let people know you’re all right now.”
accept, and then you come in and say you want to hide there for August, and I'll ease up on something else to compensate. If it's part of the contract, even vaguely, we can bind them to secrecy."
Harry wondered. He wanted to be closer. Cautiously, he stole into the room and moved behind the bed, aware that the bulk of it would help hide any slight gaps that he might cause in the cloak. Malfoy had leaned his head back and his eyes, focused forward, were closed to mere slits. Harry wondered when Hermi-- Eugene was going to fuck her-- him. Shouldn't his hand slide further up, under that tousled mound of sea foam gossamer? But no -- the wand followed again. This time, Harry was close enough to see short, light strands tumble from its path. It took him a moment longer to deduce that Eugene was using a
"Lucius was furious -- and, no doubt, terrified of retribution. He leaped forward to begin the portkey trace even before He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named shrieked at him to do so."
"Ah." Tom scratched his head, as if uncertain how to fit this information into his concept of Harry Potter -- or, Harry realized belatedly, he might just be wondering how a household managed without a fire.
Thinking about that, he was surprised to realize that he had been gone less than twenty-four hours -- possibly less than twelve. At the stairs, rather than choosing between up and down, he crossed the landing to the window. The pale winter sun was still straining towards its midday peak -- so it was more than twelve hours, but not by much. He set his school bag -- which Auror Tonks had returned to him in the Hospital Wing -- on the windowsill, and drew out the
"Indeed, it is damning with faint praise. I expect I am 'better company' than a Blast-Ended Skrewt, in that case." His eyes raked Harry up and down. "Put on some decent clothes, Mr. Potter, and I will escort you to our meeting."
“Yours, I believe,” Snape countered. “Perhaps it would be educational for them.” Black straps shot from his wand, binding Aunt Petunia’s arms and torso to the table.
He also, it seemed, had the sense to not try to make conversation once they had left the room. After a long, silent march through the corridors, Harry stood in Dumbledore's office, watching the man draw a familiar Pensieve from an equally familiar tall cabinet.
"Draco has been a bit under the weather, but he will be fine. He eventually found urination painful enough to consult Madam Pomfrey."
Harry didn't think he would have stood for that himself, but perhaps Draco would. He seemed to be wavering. Behind him, the fire flared.
When the bowl was set just so, Ron lifted the vial and looked over at Harry. "If this is poison, you'll avenge me, right, mate?"
"Of course I love you." Harry ignored Justin's huff, and the following sound of a light slap muffled by fabric. "That's why I'm helping our Professor see what's wrong with you." The third sent a bloom of spell-fire from his head.
than the Imperius curse, because he made her speak Parseltongue, and that would be like making a Squib do magic. Really, she didn't open the door --
"Exactly," Harry said, making Ginny and Ron twitch. He thought he had been expected to argue the point -- as if the Slytherins would be offended! "And Parvati -- your opinion of Ron and Hermione's relationship should probably not have gone beyond them. If you simply
Harry wasn't sure. "It isn't entirely unusual to for me to have a boy pinned, or vice versa. I mean, I've done it to you before."
With a strange, high sound, Draco nodded. He undid the last front button, and then his cuffs, and dropped his shirt carelessly to the floor. With a showy arch of his body, he pulled himself up onto the bed, and then squirmed back until he could reach a pillow and pull it under his head.
Harry didn't consider himself paranoid, exactly -- more alert to his surroundings. While packing up his Potions equipment after the first lesson of the term, he saw someone moving unnecessarily close to the table he had shared with Draco, and he directed enough attention towards that motion to see Pansy drop something flat in his bag. A note, he assumed. When Hermione approached, he paid less attention.
"Don't be alarmed, Mr.  Potter, if the colors are a bit odd. That's just the clearing potion doing what it ought."
Gilbert smoothed the brown waves of his hair as he looked around. "My turn," he announced. His gaze locked on to Harry. "I've never had a family member who was a Death Eater," he said levelly, and sat back.
Harry tugged Draco a little closer to him. The room had no seating intended for two, so he had settled on a carpet on the floor with his back against the base of a stuffed chair, and Draco was sitting between his legs, leaning back against his chest. Draco sighed and relaxed further into Harry's embrace, and Harry stretched forward to kiss him.
With a flourish, Hecksban drew out a pair of Hexacles from his day-glow bag. “But wait until you see it with these! We can detect, perhaps, a hint of
place myself in such a precarious position." Draco's eyes flashed as his lids lifted, his demeanor of ennui changing to sharp focus as he looked back at Harry. "My challenge: I have never attacked without the best weapons at my disposal."
to refuse, so he pushed back that niggle of guilt as Snape slunk forward, moving to stand beside Draco. Harry saw his lover looking up through a mist of pale lashes, not too melted to be intrigued.
"Oh. Well, he's the closest of us to Dean, and Dean's Muggleborn, and had a bit of a fit about me liking blokes, you know.  It's nothing big, except that we share a dormitory." He glanced to the side, his mouth brushing blond hair. "Not like Draco and Nott."
It wasn't safe, he realized. Malfoy had chosen the place and the time; it could be an ambush. On the other hand, he couldn't bear to say no.  There must be a way to get around that. Maybe if he left a note -- no, that wouldn't do if it was an ambush. If he sent an owl changing the place, and then spied on Malfoy approaching to make sure he was alone, that might work. He would have to be on his guard, of course, and keep his wand to hand, and he definitely shouldn't try the potion until after Malfoy had changed from it, and not then if the doses were in separate phials....
"Would you lift those skirts a little?" He licked his lips as Eugene's hold tightened. "Show me your sexy legs."
"Well, at least one of them did. I've heard that Pettigrew's been spotted, but don't tell anyone. Oh, and both of you should know exactly what I told them...."
"We were fighting about Draco," Harry said, almost wincing as the words left his mouth. He didn't remember if they had admitted to a fight. She didn't look surprised, though.  "And Professor McGonagall -- well, she doesn't want me with him either.  She'll side with Ron."
Linnet began working on her bead immediately, but Draco, who was next in the game, just rolled his two between his fingers, looking down at the clear glass. After a few seconds of this, he looked up.
Harry spent most of the next two days thinking about what to ask, not just of the Seer, but of Snape. He had expected Snape to return at night, but it was ten o'clock on Monday morning when he heard the front door slam violently closed, and then, equally violently, slam open. Aunt Petunia shrieked. He ran to the stairs, his wand out, only to find his aunt cowering in front of Professor Snape.
Ron had knelt down to touch the shimmer of residue. He pulled the cuff of his jumper down to rub at it; Harry didn't know if he was trying to clean it up, or to polish it like a mirror. "Will my hair be like that when I'm old?" he asked.
"No, of course n--" Harry hesitated. He stepped back towards the stairwell so he could look up and down it. "Let's go for a walk," he suggested. "This is already too ... we shouldn't be talking here."
He snorted. "That hadn't crossed my mind. Here --" No one else was near. He pulled her into a window embrasure at the landing. "Let me show you."
"Hush. Just for a minute." Malfoy moved out of the way to pull Harry's trousers off, but then came back. "Okay," she said, "no distractions, this time. Concentrate on how this feels....."
He turned on a tap, releasing steamy water and the scent of jasmine. For a few minutes, they just sat on the bench, watching the water fall and the steam rise. Harry wished they could take their clothes off and slide in.
“Is everyone ready?” Professor Hecksban asked, his classroom tone stopping the conversation there. Draco hurriedly stepped back, taking his place beside the Pensieve. “So,” Hecksban continued, “we now know the nature of the top curse. What might Draco do next?”
is not a threat to you, at least physically. Her guests, however, most certainly would be. Not all of them, but many."
"God." Harry leaned forward into Draco's lips, letting that soft welcome soothe his anxiety. He wondered when kissing Draco had changed from an exciting danger to something that grounded him with familiar love. The muddled sound from the doors opening was too familiar to distract him, but the stinging hex on his back was something else. He yelped, but twisted, his wand dropping into his hand.
Someone squealed. Harry's eyes went from barely closed to squeezed shut. With a warning brush of contact, Draco lifted his head, and Harry opened his eyes.
"One moment!" Draco called back, as Harry grabbed him. "Fuck!" he whispered. "We forgot a silencing charm!"
"Dean," Harry said sharply. "No. She's fine." He spoke with more confidence than he felt. He had met Linnet, but he didn't know her well. He would have preferred the neutrals that he knew better.
Harry felt his walk loosen to a swagger, but he really couldn't help it. He crossed the room through resuming conversations. The weather had added to the winter crowding, and Hermione, beaming, squeezed over to give him space on the sofa.
"Well, yeah. I mean, what if it's...." He couldn't say 'something that will get me sent to Azkaban.' Draco stepped in for him.
"Come in," he said, gesturing to the sofas and chairs clustered nearer the windows. "A House Elf brought the furniture this morning -- it's not covered with fur or anything."
Ron nodded and moved to the floor in front of the table.  Harry sat across from him. Ron was a little less mesmerized by the scrying potion, this time. He still stared at it from the time it left the flask, but he put the flask down on his own, and when Harry offered a dagger and his hand, he knew what to do without prompting. Harry didn't find waiting for the knife any easier, but it also wasn't worse. He stayed still, and Ron milked out drops of blood -- five, this time -- before releasing him.
can work on changing the form of your base material, while you change some other aspect. For example, he might spin broken glass into a window, and as he forms it, you color segments of it. Or he might make a screen of wood, and you turn some panels of it to glass. If you wish to do shaping as well, there is the shaping of two things around each other, which is how some of the highest quality tools are made."
"Among other things," Draco said sharply, "it was obvious to an uninformed observer that something was wrong with her. Had you hoped to get Harry in trouble?"
Octavius didn't know -- or shouldn't know -- that he was under investigation. The only way it all made sense was if Octavius was guilty, and Malfoy was involved.
"That must have --" Harry had no idea what he'd been going to say. Draco had his hand in Harry's trousers and wrapped around Harry's cock, and his brain wasn't bothering with anything else. "God."  It took him a few fumbling tries to get enough access to reciprocate. "Not enough."
Blaise sat back, stroking his chin as if he had a little beard. "Hm. Well, that would certainly speed up getting acquainted."
He hesitated, remembering that she mattered to him. "Not any you haven't broken yourself," he answered cautiously. It felt more wrong to lie to her when she couldn't catch him out.
Draco nodded. "I could almost certainly explain what I had done far more clearly and completely. You, however, are rather better than anyone -- the professor not excepted -- at
Ron pointed. Harry almost dropped the leaf. A voice in the back of his head pointed out that he had better not want a lover, because he had been carrying both tokens, and it hadn't helped.
"I think so," Harry agreed. "Draco was good at shaping to begin with, but he's far more precise, now. And if I work in minor transfiguration during the shaping, it usually sets it, so the change is stable."
"Draco and Potter. To what do I owe the pleasure?" He stepped aside, obviously not expecting an answer -- or at least not while they were still in the hallway. As they sat, the door closed firmly behind them, he lifted his head. "Go ahead, Draco."
"Yes, of course," Harry said, stepping up to extend his hand. Tonks shook it firmly, giving him a friendly smile above the contact.
Severus sounded incredulous. Harry felt his shoulders tighten. "He wasn't fully corporeal, so it was all he could do," he explained, "and he did try to, well, win me over."
"Ah." Draco plucked a grape from the plate between them. He rolled it between his fingers as he spoke. "Both of these methods involve potions." Disturbingly suddenly, his focus shifted from the grape to Harry. "Could there be more direct means that are outside my spellfather's purview?"
Still, no one fought, and they all agreed, in theory, that the room was a good idea. With an agreement to discuss further invitees later, the group dispersed early. Harry tried to quell his disappointment as Draco prepared to leave with his housemates. If they had been alone, Draco would have at least kissed him goodnight. He took a step towards him, and Draco turned.
"No. Well, not really. They were arguing with Professor Horsyr, last spring, about will and desire being the same thing, while Draco and I were waiting to talk to her -- and waiting, and waiting -- and I eventually said the difference was that they weren't frogs yet."
The voice helped him look away. "Er ... thanks, Sir."  After the first awful swallow, his head slowly began to clear. It was reassuring to think that his dizziness had not been entirely emotional weakness. Harry tried not to look at the bowl again, but the motion of the Seer lifting her flask drew his eye. She tipped it over the bowl, and a muddy liquid flowed out of it and dripped down to collect in a green-grey puddle in the dark blood. With her wand, she stirred the air above the bowl.
"Well, um, yeah." Harry heard his voice come out tight with anxiety and forced a more casual tone. "I mean, that makes sense, right? So we're both right."
for news. He looked at Ron, who gave him a nod, and they got to their feet and waved a quick goodbye to anyone who was looking. Across the room, Draco stood also, and preceded them to the door.
"He had memories from Theodore Nott -- anonymously left, but I could tell they were from Nott, because I
"Draco, please explain to the boy how he is expected to behave," Snape said, rising to his feet. "I have a detention to supervise in my classroom."
Ron nodded, biting the inside of his cheek. Harry thought he was earnestly trying to remain regretful. "All right. I can do that."
mean that." He looked nervously at McGonagall. "He didn't get in that sort of trouble without me to instigate it. Not that I
Everyone else seemed to have left the room, fortunately.  Harry found a wand on the table beside the bed, and lifted it. It had a bright, wicked feel to it, like an eager knife, but when he waved it, sparks shot to the ceiling. Some of them still hung there as he got up and went around the curtains to the wardrobe set at the foot of bed. The brass plaque on the door was long and bright. Etched into it was the name "Harry J. P.  Prince". He stared at it, his stomach twisting.
"Draco would do it," he said. "And if you're enjoying me as much as I think you are, he's the one you need to win over." He kissed Severus again, quickly. "You seem to be holding
enjoy that, and it doesn't mean anything's wrong with you, and I brought something to show I'm sorry for not trusting you."
Harry snorted. "I want to know what's up with Nott, of course." Determined to be reassuring, he nudged Draco. "Join me?  He'd like that, I bet."
"Of course not," Draco said easily, sitting up and reaching for the cup. When it was in his hand, he stopped, the vessel half-lowered, looking past the stem at Harry.
Draco laughed. "The thought did occur to me. At any rate, don't mention the girls' bathroom when you talk to him. He's only guessing, and it would confirm the guess."
Harry grinned. "That's what you want to do first?"  he asked, raising his eyebrows. He turned and sealed the door behind him. "Here?"  he asked, leaning against it. "Together?"
when I told her your father had attacked us and Harry. She stalked back with me, floated his unconscious body out the manor gate, revived him in the drive, and told him this was socially unacceptable behavior, and a violation of her hospitality, and that he was not welcome in her home until all parties had received an adequate apology. He replied that he would never apologize to a, quote, 'dirty mongrel like Potter,' unquote, and she set the wards against him to his face." He sighed. "And if it had ended there, the tale would be an amusing one. However, we must speculate that he brought the Dark Lord news of the attempt, thus letting him know that it had failed."
"Where have you been?" Draco demanded, when he ran into Harry coming up the stairs from Snape's office. His face darkened, and he frowned. "Never mind," he said, before Harry could speak. "Come for a walk with me."
"Yes, but it was restitution by abasing himself, really, wasn't it? I mean, teaching was beneath him; he's always thought so, as far as I can see.  And for all his scheming, he never takes what he actually
"Really, I'm not stupid!"  Harry caught himself and sighed. That was exactly the sort of response that he could not make at the trial. "
"I've finally got it," she muttered, not lifting face or quill. "How it all fits together. I need to get this down before I forget."
"That's it, Mr. Potter," Pomfrey said, her voice loud and close. "Straighten out so I can examine you."
"Ah. That makes more sense." Draco perked up a little. "Now that I think of it, that may explain your claim that he tells you more when I'm not present."
Harry bristled. "I am going, and I'm glad of the opportunity. And you can't say what is worth it to me."
"That's too bad!"  Hermione exclaimed. "Although, I suppose they'll be glad to be back with other Quiris -- they seem lonely -- or at least very eager for company. May I come here on my own while they're still around?"
Draco looked away. “Entirely Dark, physical in effect, and intense enough that I expect that it would
Malfoy's lips tightened as he thought. "Hm. I'd been thinking you as girl, but maybe not tonight. Both girls, again? You liked that last time."
He took his wand out and flicked it towards the door in a detection spell. Nothing glowed, but he cast a general privacy charm to garble their words outside the room. Ron's brow furrowed as he watched.
"Oh." McGonagall studied the bead as if it might confess on his behalf. "And you were given this by a Hufflepuff?"
"Oh, just got called to Snape's office," he said casually. "No clue why, though. I have just about enough time to run up to Gryffindor first."
"I'm going down Knockturn for potions ingredients, and there's no need for all of us to do it. I'm already picking up a few things for one of your housemates. Want anything?"
"I.... Right," Ron said sheepishly. "I should have realized that -- that it would be unpleasant for you, I mean."
"What a disgrace you are to Slytherin," he commented. "You sat at the Dark Lord's table, through entertainments of torture and death, and you behaved. Nothing so outré will happen here. Do you require murder to feign civility?"
"He might be feeling more charitable if you hadn't disappeared for the evening," Seamus said mildly.
"I will inform her that you will not return until tomorrow," he said. His hand was cool on Harry's shoulder as he passed, leaving Harry alone with the Aurors and Fawkes. For some reason, all he could think of was Draco, and how now he couldn't explain why he had lied about having had anal sex.
"Good." Her expression softened as she looked across the aisle at him. "You don't need it, anyway. You'd be an impressive student, if you just applied yourself."
"It does not suit your complexion, sir," Gilbert said, flicking the hair to one side. Cheefi froze, and for a moment, Harry thought he had objected to the touch. Then they heard a warning knock at the door -- not the dungeon door, as Harry had expected, but the one to the second floor. Harry wondered if Draco was keeping the dungeon entrance a secret.
. But he needed to work out where he was and what was going on before he stumbled into something dangerous. Could the wish have mistakenly sent him back to Hogwarts?  But he was
"Mm." Harry stroked his hands along the taut muscles of Draco's arse. "There might be other ways to release it," he whispered.
"Well, yes. For, you know, size and shape." To Harry's embarrassment, someone sniggered, but a moment later, Hecksban nodded.
"Shh." Harry lowered him down to the sheepskin by the bed, and settled him on his side, intentionally displaying his front to Severus.  "It's all right." He was already fondling Draco, covering his erection with long strokes. "Is this what you need?"
Harry did not draw his wand as the door opened, but he could see Hermione's hand at hers. Draco was the first to enter, and he held the door open for the girls. Pansy, behind him, was looking grim. A stride into the room, she stopped.
been avoiding her, really, but he had been ignoring her a lot, and now that he thought about it, he remembered how horrible that it felt to be ignored the year before. He didn't see her in the library, and after a quick look around, he walked out again, Madam Pince's glare warning his back, and went on to the official mixed-house space.
"Well, Ravenclaws were no problem," Harry said awkwardly. "One of my housemates has a Ravenclaw twin."
"As education," Draco said promptly. "He does need to be here, but it doesn't need to be unpleasant -- or no more unpleasant than his own prejudices make it."
Draco was still asleep. The light of the fire flickered across his face and chased his pale hair with gold. Harry watched him mumble in his sleep and turn his face from the light. Smiling, Harry pulled the curtains just a little bit back out, to shade Draco's eyes, and then waited for him to settle.
"It's almost impossible! I'd have to be revising five hours a day, in addition to doing assignments! So if someone else led her through the critical thinking part -- like helping her make a list of all my known activities -- Quidditch, and my Transfiguration project, and so on -- they might be able to convince her that it was mathematically impossible."
Shamed, Harry looked away. Yes, Ron had taunted him, but he had just attacked, like a child with no self-control at all.
"Oh, you are eager. Any other day -- but I really need to fuck you, Harry. Nothing else will do." With an impatient huff, Draco swung one leg to the side. "And you're far too much at liberty. Roll over."
"But the new place!" Harry interrupted excitedly. "That shop they want to buy! It won't be ready to use yet. They'd still ward it though, right? Because they'd want to protect their secrets and the things that they're moving in, and it would be perfectly
Draco raised his chin.  "And that the Clarkes are from similar politics and of higher status can only help. I expect her mother will talk to
"They assumed that in my world too," Harry said.  "Because they wanted to. I bet it's the same here."
“I think there is another,” Hecksban said. “However, it is much milder – possibly not even a true curse. It could be as harmless as a tracing charm against theft.” He looked at Draco. “So, Mr. Malfoy – do you have a plan?”
him," he answered sharply.  "It may have been Rodolphus Lestrange who murdered my father, but I know damn well who told him to." He bit down over his lower lip, drawing it free in a long scrape of teeth on skin. "He's going to have Nott kill someone tonight."
Afterwards, they lay together, sprawled in a loose embrace, until Harry's charm began to fade and the floor grew hard. Sighing, Draco pulled his left arm out from under Harry's neck, and Harry his right leg from under Draco's left.
"Are you going upstairs?" she asked, keeping the question vague, although no one appeared to be in earshot.
"Not necessarily." Kingsley's head tilted to the side. "I know it's late, but I finally worked down to the notification of the Malfoy boy's release into your custody this morning, and I just wanted to make sure he hadn't done you in."
"Certainly. There are advantages to both avenues.  Smoked, it will both take effect faster and wear off faster, which I had thought would help him avoid detection."
"Exactly. It is not common knowledge that they are now nullified by extensions to the magic that prevents Apparation. Theodore was expecting you to vanish from Slytherin and reappear in some other place -- no doubt one that he believed you could not escape from."
Dumbledore laughed. "Ah, yes! I had not considered it in quite that light." All trace of reproach had vanished, leaving his manner as cheerful and guileless as he had seemed when Harry first saw him. "Well.  Let us return to your original question then, shall we? I have not forgotten, and I hope that by now you would know that my word is good. The first week of school, however, seems a bad time to implement changes, and several of the professors were none too happy when I introduced these ideas last spring. After everyone has settled in, I will bring the matter up again." He smiled. "I must tell you, Professor McGonagall's support will be much easier to come by if you and Mr. Malfoy manage to stay out of trouble."
"Huh." Blaise shrugged. "All right. You're a special case, but you do see what I mean? And it's tempting to support You-Know-Who, because in theory his lot wants that I'm a pureblood to count for something, but looking at what they
"Oh." Hermione sat back. Harry, conscious that it was better not to push her, let her think. "I -- I imagine-- Well, like the official space, this should be accepting?"
The scheme worked. Malfoy was alone when he started up the stairs, and he was still alone when he walked into the room.
"Right. So I've been told. It's not my fault Slytherins are paranoid." Still, Harry couldn't help but remember how amused he had been when he had heard about Nott casting curse detection charms at his underwear. He hadn't exactly been in a hurry to make it clear.
Severus turned back from starting down a faint path. "You expected a Seer to receive you in the dead of night?" he asked, his eyebrows rising.
"Tedious, though," Draco protested. "Even Severus isn't always there, and regardless, he can't abide the Quiris, so I've taken a room up the corridor from his."
Draco shrugged. "I have no reason to think it wasn't. When I asked Vince, he confirmed that they'd woken up in a broom closet, after eating some floating cupcakes."
He expected that if anyone had arrived before him it would be Draco, but it was Ron who was waiting on the blue sofa. The fall of dark green ivy set off his red hair almost as dramatically as it did Draco's blond.
," Pansy corrected, her nose wrinkling. "It is widely said that the Weasley girl opened the Chamber of Secrets herself, under the influence of a Dark artifact." Her voice grew drier. "
Harry wanted to reply immediately, but he held back.  Draco would not approve of him meeting with Bulstrode, he was certain, so it would be better to have that done before he replied. However, there was nothing to keep him from an immediate visit to Darkmoon Den.
"Thornton," Draco said scathingly, "leave strategy to your elders. Extra practice is of no benefit this late, and extra rest is."
"I'm sure she thought that sufficiently vague to be harmless. She is less subtle than some." He gestured Draco to stand. "We will discuss the other divinations later. For now, I must use my grate."
Harry sighed. "Hermione and I are ... not comfortable right now, let's say. As for Ron...." He shrugged. "I
He told himself that all that had been his decision, and he wouldn't take it out on Hermione, just for doing what she should.
"I think it was Peeves," Julian said, then quickly swallowed the potion. "A Fanged Frisbee came out of nowhere, just as a group of us were going down the stairs. Everyone was trying to duck it, and Vere, the idiot, pushed in behind me, and I fell into the trick stair."
Narcissa was probably referring to the motif of the heavy silver utensils by his plate, or perhaps the arms of the chair, on which he now noticed carved serpents twined about, ending head to head near where his hands would rest.
"Fair warning," Tonks said. "Since you've been unconscious, you may not have cleared out all the Veritaserum. I suspect the Inquisitorial supply is a little stronger than ours."
"Oh, Harry," Remus said softly. Harry thought he hadn't meant to. Harry stood still, trying to compose himself. His throat had closed up.
Millicent nodded. Harry studied her for a moment. "I'd love to end it first," he said, "but we still don't have photographs."
"What my aunt was trying to be," Harry explained. "She failed at it so miserably that I never saw the point. You kept it all working though, didn't you? The perfect host."
Sammy shook his head. "Not that I know of," Sammy said. "When I did accidental magic, my parents thought I was lying."
That wasn't anything like he had feared, but it still seemed heavy-handed. He also couldn't be sure it was entirely safe for
"Hm." Snape looked down to where he was running his fingers along the edge of the small table by the bed. "Another thing about which I am curious, Potter...."
too ill to argue with yet," Draco said pleasantly. "Now, I had better go. Those potions are headed our way."
"Really. There are a half-dozen people who say they saw you leaving Slytherin this morning." Her small eyes glittered. "Is it true that you can nullify Portkeys?"
"No. Narcissa Malfoy adds some sort of peace potion to the champagne, so that people are less likely to fight, at least physically. It's apparently pretty well known, and a few guests avoid it, but mostly people go along. I suppose it's polite. Anyway, the idea is that I didn't drink it, but most of the people around me would have, giving me an edge. I also had a ring that let me sense anyone near me drawing a wand, but that wasn't as useful as I expected. It heated up so often that I stopped noticing it. Oh, and don't tell anyone about that, because the potion we made it with isn't entirely legal."
"Of course it matters!" Draco retorted hotly, sitting at the other end of the sofa, his arms crossed. "Image is important."
In fact, it was nearly half an hour later when Hermione finally joined them. As they had planned, Harry and Draco started explaining what they were working on for Cursebreaking, and then, once she was fascinated, Harry suggested that they find someplace more private for a practical.
. My life here is still controlled. I don't know what I want -- what I'll like -- out in the world."
"What?" Ron asked, staring at him with honest confusion. "You know, if she's going to run a household, she won't have time to be after the neighbors about humane treatment of ghouls, or whatever her cause of the month is." He sighed. "Mum says she'll settle down once she has a baby to focus all that energy on, but I don't know."
think of it as a skirt. Recalling Draco's unease the night before, he followed his knock with calling, "It's Harry."
Before Harry could formulate an answer, Draco had stepped in front of him. "Since my lover has a highly generous nature and several appallingly obvious weaknesses, and the two of you are capable of getting people to
Nott nodded and sent Harry -- or perhaps Draco -- a vicious look. "Well, Draco used to be around the common room most evenings, but in December, he started going missing. He'd be gone almost every other night, and we found out later that he was meeting Potter. They both stayed at the school over the Christmas holiday, and when we came back, it was even worse -- sometimes he'd be out well into the night, and come back smelling of alcohol. About a month into term, he started saying negative things about his family. I think it was to impress Potter, you know -- that he was too well-bred for Potter and had to play that down. In March, we started seeing him with more vulgar students, even--"
He hadn't accomplished anything he had intended, but Draco couldn't help feeling that he had got quite a lot -- enough that a retreat was not unthinkable. After all, at any minute, the real Creevy minor might come bounding up the stairs.
She was focused on Draco, but Harry answered first. "Well, to some extent. I mean, I stayed brave through the Dursleys, so yeah, I'd probably stay brave through anything."
"I'm willing to give it another try," Ginny said. "If it gets nasty, we should either stop, or ban some people from playing."
Narcissa sighed. "Let's put the matter aside for the night. Do you know what Cursebreaking will cover next term?"
"Well, let's see," Blaise said, stretching back. "Brilliant, beautiful, helpful.... I can see why he might tolerate a little protective disapproval. Though I presume he doesn't care about her looks."
"Right." That put Harry on the spot. He plowed on. "So, um, I think I shouldn't learn any more Dark Arts now. I thought maybe we could go back to that wandless magic idea?"
like you know you can trust me! You didn't tell me about Malfoy Manor, you didn't tell me about this--"
Harry laughed, relieved that his Draco was neither a virgin nor vastly more experienced than he was. He reached a hand out to trace the side of Draco's face, encouraging him to turn towards him, and Draco sighed, just as the Draco two worlds back had sighed when he was ready to drop another layer of pretence.
He managed to evade Hermione during the afternoon and through dinner, but he wasn't sure what he would do after that. He didn't have anywhere to go other than Gryffindor. He and Draco had agreed to not meet that evening, as they had spent most of Sunday together, and he really needed to finish his Charms work. Maybe she would be too busy studying to notice when he came in.
"This is at the Avalon Club in London. His mother inherited the Nimbus fortune, and they both breed show Krups, competing at the European level."
"No. It's not that, it's--" Ron blew out a harsh breath. "I already saw more of Voldemort than Harry, didn't I? Besides, scars are the past."
"That? Haven't you seen Ron's?" He held a hand several inches past the tip of his own wand, making Draco snigger.
"How?" Harry asked. "I mean, I'd love to, but I haven't the faintest idea what to do. Madam Pomfrey--"
Afterwards, he and Draco went up the stairs together, and by silent agreement, to Harry's room. "You know," Draco said, as the door closed behind them, "if you want people to consider you to be the dumb warrior, you're doing a very good job."
"I wish the younger ones wouldn't gossip about you.  It's not as if they can't speak to you in the common room. Do you see how they're staring?"
Harry looked around. He was in a small, single-bed hospital room, and he wouldn't be surprised to find that the windowless door was locked. "Why I am here?"
Harry nodded and took a shaky breath.  Malfoy's beauty was a bit more intimidating when it was too far away to seize.  "I think you must be the most gorgeous person I've ever seen. Sexier than any natural girl."
After a long moment, Snape nodded. "It is possible.  I will sound her out." His expression darkened. "Now, about marking Theo's wall...."
it." He raised an eyebrow at Harry. "She isn't my father, darling. I am expected to make the most of my considerable talents, not to prove that no one else has any."
I beat him, and while he's probably already told Voldemort, I don't want it being public knowledge that I can cast a wandless Stupefaction hex."
He stepped back, and regarded his work with obvious satisfaction. "How's that?" he asked. He gestured around at the other, empty shelves. "More subtle than flowers, but softening in the same way, I think."
"Right." Harry cleared his throat. "Someone could do better at trials, of course. I mean, I need to choose the candidate who's best for the team. But you should get in some practice."
Draco rolled his eyes. "A special event. With a restriction to children who would be in my year, the net had to be cast a little wider."
Harry wanted to go to Remus -- and Sirius! -- right away, but after he had eaten, he forced himself to spend some time planning his visit. While he helped the twins set shelves into place in the front room, he examined the idea, thinking about what could go wrong. Sirius, he realized almost immediately, had not sworn to secrecy. Mulling this over, he found himself unable to believe that his godfather would betray him for taking matters into his own hands and leaving. If he kept his head and sounded sensible, he should be able to trust Sirius.
"Um ... toilet?" he asked. He had been lying down to ease the pressure on his bladder; standing up was painful.
This time, Harry was expecting a comment, and did not react to Seamus saying "Harry's got a rather steady stroke, hasn't he?"
"Hm." Astoria actually got up from her seat and came to the other side of the coffee table in front of Harry's couch. She was still wearing her Chaser's robes, although the green hue was only obvious on the side of her that faced the fire. Away from it, they were darkened to near black by the dim light. She slipped a finger under the strand of beads to lift it. "Linnet," she said. "Show me yours as well."
Remus grinned at the bird. "He is with me, and safe.  I will return him to Hogwarts after breakfast tomorrow."
"She was already with child from one of her brothers," Pansy said, "and as she never married, passed on the name to her son."
"No. As far as can tell, he only asked because he thought it would be Draco, and thought he'd be embarrassed."
"Of course not! We were talking about Andromeda." Harry looked away from his godfather's glare. "When I didn't recognize the name -- 'Regulus,' I mean -- she said, 'so you really
"Calm down. I don't. It's in the Shrieking Shack. But Ron, think!  The Contrivance match -- we can paint a diluted solution on a modified bludger -- one that only goes after players in green."
"I've been doing my best to ignore it. I mean, I know about Zabini. No one can do her best if she's thinking about dying all the time."
"Many of the spells were purely physical in nature, and for those a mouse or spider -- transfigured to provide the proper anatomy, if needed -- sufficed. Others we left at targetless casting, although I agree it is not the same.
Biting his lip, Harry thought back. He didn't think Draco would disrupt that alliance based on what had never been full disapproval. "I bought it for him. He paid me back, but I--"
"I was just seeing if I could," Harry explained again, although it seemed rather silly now, with Cheefi chittering at him and grooming his hair.
explanation.  Mum was busy protesting that I couldn't go away to school; she's not a boarding school sort of mum, really."
"No! It's--" She looked uneasily around. The teams were listening now. Draco had his hand clenched tight around the arm of Cecilius, the other Beater, holding him back. "What business is it of yours?" she said angrily. "I'm not
Dobby's ears quivered, and he bounced up and then bowed deeply. "Dobby will be bringing ivy to not-Master Malfoy," he said happily, and with another sharp crack, he vanished. Draco flopped down on the stiff velveteen sofa as if he had just run twenty laps of the pitch. Harry thought he knew how he felt.
Harry was sure he'd heard the term before, but couldn't place it. "Sorry. Though at this point, I'll need to wait until the hovering stops."
Hello all! I haven't been reproducing the original posting dates on every chapter, but this one is right -- this chapter is new! Enjoy!
Harry lifted the bottle slightly. "Would you like some? It's not as good as usual, but it's not bad."
Snape's voice shook slightly. Harry had realized how difficult this situation was for Draco, but it had not occurred to him that Snape, despite the resentment of years of hidden opposition to Lucius, might also be similarly torn. Indeed, Snape kept his gaze on Narcissa, like a dog waiting helplessly for some sign of belonging.
"Well, not all the time. Last night was strained though. I thought a glass per person might ease the atmosphere for getting acquainted, so I was planning for three nights of that, perhaps on successive Friday evenings." He frowned. "Maybe twelve bottles would be better."
"You too," Harry said. He couldn't think of anything more personalized, not when his mind had suddenly leapt to thoughts of Sirius. There must be news! There must be good news, or she and Professor Dumbledore wouldn't be so cheerful, would they?"
Draco smirked and took a sip of his drink. "As it happens, I cleaned up the decayed remains of a forty-two foot basilisk with a Bone-Burning curse. Before, I might add, Harry and I started to correspond with each other, which was before we started to associate with each other, which was before we were close enough that I would have considered believing anything of the sort, had I not seen the evidence. The thing you need to understand about Harry is that the most outrageous things happen to him; the only lie he has any proficiency in is false protestations that he was studying quietly at the time you are asking about."
"Whatever you want," Ron said, before Harry could answer, and he turned back to Harry. "So. You were fooling around with Dark Arts."
Harry was not sure if everyone who took Julian’s metallic bead would have done so before the exchange, but it was taken by more people than passed on it, including half of the Slytherins.
were close. The people who attacked you are not above dismembering Dudley in front of your eyes. They sent me a man's head at Christmas."
Harry nodded acknowledgement. He wondered if Dumbledore knew about this arrangement. Probably, as he had wanted to host all of Draco's floo calls.
Rolling his eyes, Draco sighed. "Harry," he said patiently, "the point is to engender trust. If we bring her in on a secret, and then say we were deceiving her about it, that will not--"
Harry stared. He didn't think he had been especially subtle about tailing around after Cedric at the end of his fifth year, although the older boy had at least been decent enough not to embarrass him by noting it and turning him down. He certainly hadn't been trying to hide his admiring looks after Trent, last autumn.
"Supplemental reading at my discretion," Harry said firmly, trying not to be distracted by the incredulous looks of the kids behind her.
"But I didn't offer him asylum?" this other Harry questioned, obviously finding the thought incredible. "I don't understand how Sirius could change that. The split must have been earlier."
, but not what we did. I told him I couldn't, so we worked with neutral spells, but then he wanted me to observe a couple of Dark curses."
Snape leaned forward.  "Understand, Lupin, that she has burned most of her bridges. She still has her social standing as a pureblood lady -- including with Death Eaters' wives -- but the Dark Lord is doing her a favor in ignoring her ... and she is willing to risk that fragile cover for closer ties that may help her survive his fall.
Well, that was certainly vague, Harry thought, and it had a tinge of disapproval that he disliked. "I was with Draco," he answered boldly.
The loops of her body flowed over his skin with the eager hiss, and she raised the front of her body to look him in the face.
“We were just saying that we hoped this week would be calmer,” Harry said, as if that explained things. Perhaps it did. “Though I don’t think it’s likely.”
One by one, students in the lesson began to breathe again. Draco's quill scratched lightly over a page in his notebook. He shifted his arm back in invitation for Harry to read.
Draco frowned. His hand drifted over to touch Harry's. "I don't think so. I think that I'll find the best resources for that at home, so perhaps it should wait until after Christmas break."
"You need to learn. You need to be able to delegate.  You need to rely on your friends where and when you can, and even on the staff,
Turning, he seized Harry's arm, and before Harry knew what was happening, he was being squeezed unbearably by the inward force of Apparation. When they popped out on the other side, Harry stumbled, tried to catch himself, and crashed into a bush.
His aunt was twisting her upper body against Snape’s restraints, but was still below the waist, whether due to damage or more precise magical restraint. Her legs were still a mess, but responding to Madam Pomfrey’s spells by roughly scabbing over. She began to still. He couldn’t see the rabbit; someone had covered it with a dark cloth.
Draco's eyes flicked over the page. "Yes," he said boldly. "She replied to my letter this morning, via Severus, rather than an owl."
He stumbled out into the low-ceilinged kitchen of an old farmhouse. The beams over the stove were black with the smoke of centuries, and the mingled scent of stone and cooking was solid and warm. By the window, Tonks was talking with an older woman. They looked over at Harry's arrival, and Tonks waved. Draco stepped through behind Harry. Immediately, he started over to the window, snagging Harry's arm in passing. Harry suspected that he had wanted to look outside, not to socialize, but the view was of a walled garden that could have been anywhere.
Ron entered first, and Harry's worry deepened that they weren't together. It helped that Ron came straight towards him.
"Yes, exactly." Draco turned to Snape. "Much of the formal divination has not been useful, but when he is in that state, his side comments have all been frighteningly accurate." He scowled at Harry. "Except for that one about girls and boys--"
She regarded him curiously. "So, isn't that contradicting yourself? If it makes no difference to their character, what's there to know? Why ask?"
Severus, apparently tired of standing, threw himself down into Draco's heirloom Louis IV armchair. "How gaudy. Is it the ceremonial cat of Gryffindor?"
Harry was tempted to run straight down to room fourteen, but he didn't want to show up smelling of the Knight Bus and the artificial scents of Petunia Dursley's air freshener. Draco valued appearances, and if Draco was going to tell him to leave, he would at least do it with regret.  Instead, Harry bathed and dressed as nicely as possible, in clothes he had bought while in Hogsmeade with Draco. He chose the loose-legged black trousers, and the silk shirt that had once been red and gold, but was now green, black, and gold. Susara flowed reassuringly around his neck before disappearing under the silk to settle around his arm. When he checked the clock, it was quarter to seven already. He went back to the mirror, and tried to decide if he was ready for dinner with Draco.
"But what if they didn't?" Harry burst out. "Yes, I hated losing, and I hated even more not getting to
"I know." Harry held on to Draco and wondered when that would pull him in two. "You just ... you talk about it like it makes
"Since I haven't told you not to, yes. It's going to keep you that much open until I take it out." Harry slid a connector down the two wide snaps that came from Snape's waist. "And this will help it stay in while you suck me." In a quick fall to the side, he was on his back, displaying a blood-dark erection. Deliberately, he stroked his hand up it, holding tight over the head for a moment before lifting his hand away. "Come on. Do it now."
Albus Dumbledore," she said firmly. "In a known and warded house. Sorry, but this wouldn't be the same."
"Yeah, well." He shrugged. "I got a lot better at Transfiguration last year, when I was going over things with Draco."
Harry shuddered. Did he need to die then? Could he only win for others by losing for himself? Ron lifted his head, sanity flooding down his bloody face.
"She was keeping an eye on you, as I asked," he replied with smile. "It's not quite having eyes in the back of my head, but close enough." He focused on Julian. Wondering if the boy had been hurt so Dumbledore could approach him made him feel ... not guilty, he decided, but protective. "Are you all right now, J-- Devary?" he asked. "That ankle looked pretty bad."
"When Draco started school, he was, of course, in my house," Snape said, his attention finally shifting to the young man at Harry's side. "I began to communicate with Lucius again, as teacher to parent, although we had largely fallen out of social contact in previous years."
"Here," he said finally. He took a deep breath and opened his eyes. "To our first year of adulthood and our last year of protection; to working and playing together; to victory."
"Of course not. Dumbledore will spring it on me right before, I'm sure." Harry hesitated. "I plan to be gone before then."
Harry laughed, and was about to reply, but a movement ahead caught his eye. On the path from the castle, just where it rounded the pitch, was Remus Lupin, frozen in mid-step and staring straight at them.
A flight of stairs down into the dungeons, he encountered a complication. Draco was coming up, and they spotted each other simultaneously. Harry slowed, but so did Draco. They met on a landing.
"I managed to get in some greenhouse work over the last few summers," Neville said quickly. "I found a way to breed soothable Mandrakes, so they can be repotted -- and even harvested -- without aural protection."
"Yes. And Gryffindors will assume he is being unfair, which can only benefit you. To my room; I'll help you write the letter; we'll get it sent and then have some fun." Draco started forward again. "Oh, and ask for a few Caladrius feathers and some coltsfoot, as well."
"Ah, but the counterpart to manners is the insult of dropping them," Snape replied, sneering at the boy on his sofa.
The seconds it took them to cross to the mat were nearly unbearable, even with Malfoy's hand on his hip. Only that grip kept Harry from dropping immediately onto the wool-stuffed canvas. He had the thought that this must be Snape's bed, but that wasn't enough to turn him off. Before he could do more, Malfoy had pulled him around by the shoulder. They stared at each other for a moment.
"Hm." Draco set down the marble on the table.  As it spun up into a snifter under his wand, Harry pointed at it, catching Dumbledore's attention. "The marble was the portkey Nott tried to take me with. After Snape was finished with it, he gave it back to me."
"Right!" chipped in the wizard who said he'd kill himself if he had to talk to a House Elf. Harry shot him a glare.
. Harry hadn't expected to recall his feelings at the time so keenly. "I just -- I haven't talked about this since, really. But it was
Susan sighed. "Would've, if I'd thought I'd get away with it," she said wistfully. "Now and then, Aunt Amelia wants to show off extra family."
Harry wrapped an arm around Malfoy and half-hid his face in his hair. Of course he would! "Hardly seems fair to Ron."
"Oh." Harry felt his face heating. "Well, I didn't realize, then, that the wizard-raised students weren't as bothered by it, mostly, and--" His voice caught.
Still looking rather disapproving, Remus stood and opened a drawer in a small table. "Your letter," he said, handing it to Harry. "I'll tell Professor McGonagall that you received it, shall I?"
"I remember," Gloria said. "I spent all of first year thinking you were an idiot. You wouldn't answer even the simplest questions."
He tucked the shirt in and added a belt, for appearances. Knotting a Slytherin tie shouldn't have been any different than knotting a Gryffindor one, but the green flashed oddly in his vision, and his hands shook. He sat for a moment to breathe and look at them, and it was then that he saw the scar.
"No. But I met Sajid doing as you recommended -- talking to more people in my house, I mean. I don't have much in common with either of them, but they don't have much in common with each other either."
Harry shrugged. "Yeah, but I wanted to obscure my own purchases. So I bought his stuff, and Millicent's, and mine."
"If you use it constantly, yes, but the proscription is more that true gargoyles are rare. I'm not planning to take it all term -- just for a few key sessions and for N.E.W.T.s."
"I stormed off in the middle of your party! I left you with an unconscious guest and Esmée still trapped by the bushes!"  Harry ducked his head. "Does she hate me?"
awake.” Draco rolled over. The skin around his eyes was puffy and bruised. If Harry had slept badly, it looked like Draco had slept not at all. Tentatively, Harry put an arm around him. Draco tensed.
She shook her head. "Through that mess? I'll just apparate, thanks. See you in September!" With a grin and a clap of collapsing air, she vanished. Harry left quickly, locking the door behind him.
"A rupture of blood vessels in the brain. Or heart failure. Or failure of some other vital organ or function, like breathing."
After multiple attempts, she frowned. "I don't know what's wrong. All I can find is a nosebleed hex."
"Yes, but people sometimes say that -- or even think it -- when they're not. Sadly, you appear to be right." She reached for the phial. "Let me take more, and I'll give you a massage or something, while you recover."
"We'll need at least that to complete research on the first potions, and I suspect at least a weekend to make them."
-- although Gilbert won't yet admit it -- and I think Devary would love to be. You should work on him. Ruthven Kent, who wouldn't have willingly spoken to a mixed-blood at the start of the year, is now playing games with them in the mixed house space. Astoria is rather fascinated with you as well." He laughed slightly. "Miss Gentian LeFay! Though she's at least of a liberal family. How did you end up owing her tutoring?"
"Is that so," she said mockingly, not even making it a question. She wondered if she should point out the map to him.
On Saturday, there was snow, but it turned to rain before amounting to much. Harry was relieved that he wouldn’t have to stay in and miss glorious, harmless battles of snow, but he felt guilty as his housemates sighed.
"I don't think it counts when people answer for each other. He doesn't really know, of course, even if you both think he does."
"No, I can't, and I told them not to take what Slytherins said at face value -- but that it might be worth talking anyway."
Still, Harry appreciated the care they were taking. The rabbit wasn’t a real creature with a past or a family; in class, it would be turned back into a stick.
"Yes. As in 'save the Welsh Green! Limit Muggle encroachment on the habitat of our native magical creatures!'" Harry made a face. "The idea was to add a potion that damages female fertility to the water supply -- initially in key areas, and then extending the reach all over Britain. Snape had calculated a fifteen percent resistance rate, so the effect would be enough to reduce the population substantially in a generation, even with immigration changes. And I -- well, my analog -- had little notes in the margin: 'present as a humane means of achieving necessary population control' and so on."
"Before your friends show up...." Zabini's head lowered in stubborn uncertainty. "Have you got what you said you would?"
"Yeah. They were pretty good about it. Gave me Polyjuice Potion, even, so I could get out a bit." Harry glanced around at them. He didn't want Ron to start talking about Bulstrode. "So, has everyone decided what they're taking? I want to pick up Cursebreaking. I've skimmed through the text a bit, and it looks brilliant."
"Of course not!" Quickly, Draco looked away.  "I mean," he said, "I was too old for hide-and-seek in the gardens, then. And I had things to learn."
"The conniving bastard. 'Delusions of persecution' indeed!" He raised his head to look at Harry. "I can't believe he had the gall to try to cast
At a flicker of motion, Harry looked over. The sun on Greenhouse Four made a mirror, reflecting a wavering Professor Snape, tall, thin, and dressed all in black, but with a ridiculous wicker pack held to his back with brown leather straps. Beside him, the mirror Harry Potter looked distressingly short, but the red and gold in his hat, and the red lining of the hood hanging behind him, added color to the black of his cloak. At every other step, a leg of his worn navy jogging bottoms -- weekend wear for what he had expected to be a day of lounging around Gryffindor staring at textbooks -- flashed briefly into sight.
"The important ones."  He'd answer questions about the lightning bolt only if asked. It wasn't connected. That was just the color that was easiest for him.
"Yes." Draco rocked in, using his heels to lift himself up. Harry grinned and thrust faster, getting an easier slide. He had ignored Draco's cock while he needed him to relax, but now he reached down and took it in his lube-slick hand. The half-soft shaft stiffened as he slid a loose grip up and down it in time to his thrusts. His control, now loosened, began to tumble down like a landslide from their combined pleasure. Draco, fortunately, responded happily to faster and harder, requiring no check. In short order, he was climaxing hard, and Draco wailed and followed.
"Grant, Samuel" was sorted into Gryffindor, requiring Harry to return his attention to the Sorting. He clapped for the boy, whose cheeks burned pink as he crossed the hall to the cheers of his new housemates.
The three boys maintained their moods for the walk down: Sammy cautious and distant, Jeremy moderately pleased, and Rob bouncing with excitement -- except for occasional puzzled looks back at Sammy. From outside the stands, Harry could hear other players, but no one was high enough to be visible over the walls. He led the kids up to the seats. Being the tallest, and in front, he was the first to come in sight of the players -- Jason and Lindsey were in the air, and Cornelia on the ground, pinwheeling her arms in a warm-up exercise.  As the boys emerged into the open air, Harry looked back at Sammy. His eyes widened, and his mouth fell open, and he came to the present moment in an instant.
"Indeed, Mr. Potter." She flicked out her wand and close the door. "I am afraid I must ask you some questions. Come here, please."
And he was obligingly gentle. Too obligingly, Harry decided, after a long time of a gentle twist of two, then three fingers. He couldn't say it wasn't good; he wasn't even bored, really, but the strain of
"Well, then! Let's give him a bit of intrigue, shall we? I fancy a walk in the garden -- I'm told it's unseasonably marvelous!"
Draco's cheeks raised in an unguarded smile. "Not at all. We just need to be sure that the Gryffindors believe that you are in change, and the Slytherins believe that I am."
Slowly, Malfoy relaxed, sinking limply down to the cushioned floor, and Harry found himself doing all the work. He didn't mind. When he looked down at Malfoy, he got back a sleepy, contented smile that was as strange on his old enemy as the girl bits.
"Of course," Draco said. "An admirable goal. But for the well rounded witch or wizard -- let us say the clever Hufflepuff or brave Ravenclaw -- at what cost? What stagnates when you are isolated with those who share a trait you would express anyway?"
"Idiot," Hermione said fondly. For a moment, she was silent. "Though to be honest, I hadn't thought you'd done that yet."
"What?" Draco asked, confused. Cheefi moved to him, climbing up on one shoulder and wrapping his tail across his neck to the other one.
"There was very little blood in the first ritual," Harry said. "Just a few drops, but he predicted Nott would murder someone that night, and he did."
Draco headed for the counter at Slug & Jiggers, stopping in annoyance when he saw another customer already there, slowly explaining a problem with the selection of beetle wings. Damn Octavius anyway! He had expected to have two days alone to work on some brewing, and now he was expected to not only attend some overwrought opera, but to do it with a new appearance. He could only come up with so many of those that were convincing. He wondered if Octavius knew that he sold potions and intentionally disrupted his brewing time to keep him financially vulnerable. While the customer in front of him droned on, Draco considered that possibility and what it would mean. That Octavius was delusional, probably. He wasn't that important anymore, and uncertified potions wouldn't make him enough to get by -- not unless he specialized in prohibited potions, and he wasn't about to risk that.
"Oh!" Draco's eyes widened, and then narrowed.  "I still plan to have a talk with Severus about this."
"Or a Hufflepuff," he suggested, forcing a lightness he didn't feel. "You'd appreciate diligence and care, I think."
"Ah, I see."  Dumbledore refreshed his own tea while he considered that. "Yes, formal robes would be best. Your school robes are not really appropriate, and Muggle clothing might enhance the mistrust of those members who will be inclined to treat Lucius Malfoy leniently." His raised an eyebrow at Harry. "Do recall, however, that I am allowed the eccentricities of my age. Your own clothing should be more sedate, as befits the solemnity of the circumstances."
He looked hesitantly at Eugene. Hermione wouldn't take that well, and he doubted changing sexes would change Eugene's opinion of sex by extortion. Not to mention he had only the vaguest idea how that might work.  Still, it
"You're both...." Eugene stopped there, apparently unable, for once, to think of a word. He crawled forward to work a hand under Malfoy's skirts. He was shaking. Harry felt a bit neglectful.
"And it was envious," Parvati said shakily. She had curled her legs up next to herself on the sofa, and paused to blow her nose. "That
"Pretty much," Harry answered, feeling his cheeks stretch in a grin. "Don't hit me in the same place, and I should be fine. And--"
If any of the Gryffindors blamed Harry for losing the match, Ron, Dean, Ginny, and Jason were keeping them off. The constant affirmation was making Harry queasy. He kept seeing the look on Millicent's face. He had been humiliated, and had wanted to hurt her, but how much had she changed, by now? If he didn't meet her tonight, was he messing up the rest of her life?
"What's up?" she asked, as soon as they were clear of the building. She made a face. "Is it about the match?"
"Still," Ron said, "if we could have something that means each of them separately, that might be worthwhile."
Draco hesitated, and then dipped his head in a nod. When he followed, it was more actively. He didn't even pause in front of his room. Harry was pleased.
On Sunday, Millicent met him by the greenhouses after lunch, and they went into the secret tunnel under Greenhouse Four, and followed it down to a place where it widened out. The Tripwire charm that Harry had set before leaving on Tuesday was still in place, showing that no one had walked there since they left. He disarmed it temporarily and set down his bag.  Millicent helped him fill the storage containers they had brought in when setting up.
He understood. "Gryffindor. We've been friends since first year. My last name is Potter. Sirius died when I was fifteen. We think Ron is still alive."
"There," he said. "I don't dare even kiss here, but there is my love for you." He laughed slightly. "White for purity, you know -- perhaps Mother will think we are
Harry put down his fork. It was suddenly difficult to swallow his food. He got it down and cleared his throat with a mouthful of tea. "I am not interested in speaking to Mrs. Weasley," he said stonily.
"About why he agreed last night ... I'm not sure. He looked alarmed for a second, but I wasn't sure if it was because you were right, or because he thought I'd believe it."
Although rolling her eyes, she smiled. "How very like you." She hesitated. "I should be researching."
"Potter," Pansy said derisively, "I have never in my life heard a more absurd fabrication. You can't expect anyone to believe that, no matter how many points Bumblebore mysteriously awarded to you. Besides, it was common knowledge that--"
As soon as Harry had stopped being able to speak, the squirming returned. He found himself on the floor, Tonks standing over him, her wand trained on the disarmed Auror Mason.
Draco, whom he hadn't seen since Friday night. What if he was missing because something was wrong? What if he had been injured, or called home?
"Decided to be decent about it." Eugene's mouth twisted down. "Get back to Gryffindor, now, or I'll have to take points."
Malfoy felt his lip curl in disdain. Why couldn't he pretend to cooperate? It shouldn't be that hard -- just think of the Auror as a professor -- but this was
Anger spiked hot in Harry as he stood. He forced himself to put back his memories before speaking, afraid that he might otherwise storm out without them.
Draco shivered under his touch, but his voice was light and precise. "Just that you don't see the full glory of it all at once. I was hoping to evaluate the effect."
, but he realized immediately that was paranoia. He had been gone all last night and all morning, and some people knew why; there would probably be gossip, even without what had transpired at last night's gathering.  Curiously, he looked around for Uncommon Room members. By the window, Seamus raised his eyebrows. Harry grinned, and Seamus rolled his eyes dramatically before turning back to the grey rain. Neville was watching Seamus rather than Harry, his brows furrowed. Checking by the fire, Harry spotted Hermione, and next to her, Ron, who turned away, reddening, as soon as their eyes met.
me. I need to avoid Dark Arts anyway, at the moment, and I have too much schoolwork to use up free time getting drunk."
Draco undid his tie with great deliberation, running his fingers sensually down the length of silk at the end of every untraced loop, so that Harry's mouth went dry and he had to suck his lips in to moisten them.  With a smug look, Draco strolled forward, the length of cloth stretched between his hands. Harry waited. When Draco cast the loop of silk over his head and behind his neck, and then used it to draw him into a kiss, Harry all but melted.
Draco felt his eyes widen. That was worse than he'd thought. And he couldn't imagine how Weasley's mind worked. First year boys were more like girls?
She marched them all, Draco included, through the Gryffindor Common Room and into her room. People stared, but anyone who started to speak shrank back from her glare. As the door clicked shut, she pivoted to turn that glare on them.
"It's all right," Harry murmured as Draco rinsed the shampoo out and started a second round of it. "We'll take care of you."
"And if you'd got past where I was casting, you would have been really hurt," Harry snapped, even as he tumbled to the floor to help. Ginny was doing the same on Ron's other side. "So no being angry at Cornelia."
Holding on to the bar, Harry scrubbed at his legs. "Agreed. After all, it's not as if we're in hiding."
Amused at being the expert on something so unimportant, Harry leaned back in his chair. "Has multiple tails, usually flat -- the whole thing is milder than a whip, on average, but they vary a lot based on the weight and width and number of the tails. Oh, and the length of them. And material -- all of mine are some sort of leather."
They looked at each other. "But don't ask a Slytherin, right?" Sammy said. Yolanda looked despairingly at him, her thick, dark braid swinging with the motion. Harry met her eyes and gave her a quick smile.
Harry probably should have gone back to Ron and Hermione's place, but his stomach was twisted in knots, and he didn't think he could. He sent a message saying he was all right, and that his friend would live, and he returned to the Ministry with the override charm for Miranda's locker.
"I'll interview him," he said easily. "I need to give a report to the headmaster anyway, and you certainly don't need me breathing down your necks." He winced as the words came out. "So to speak."
Harry nodded, and looked around the room. There wasn't a desk or table anywhere, but there was a low sort of platform near the wall.  Pulling his shirt on, he headed over to it. The room still wanted to cooperate, he decided, because he had never had such an easy time transfiguring something so large. He turned a few cushions into chairs, and he and Malfoy sat down, just as if they were in the library, except for that they weren't glaring daggers at each other.
"Not at first. He became suddenly pushy; I thought he had been going a little too far with Dark Arts. But
to do so. People used to think the sun orbited the earth. That something was once widely believed does not make it an indisputable truth." His proud manner faded to something more sullen as he twisted his heel against the stone floor. "And perhaps they wouldn't be as united as it seems. My mother seems increasingly less dedicated to the idea of pureblood superiority the longer my father is away."  His face twisted. "Not that I expect any half-bloods to show up in my list of potential wives."
it." He cleared his throat. "Okay. I've never worried about leaving school at the end of the year. That's it." He took a bead and rolled the smooth glass between forefinger and thumb, wondering what color or pattern could possibly express life at the Dursley's -- dismal and monotonous, but still nothing like safe. Finally, he turned it dishwater grey with flecks of red deeper in, but he wasn't sure what they stood for. Pain, perhaps, but anger was stronger. A touch to his knee almost made him flinch. He forced himself to stay still and look. Hermione had reached across Ron's lap to lay a hand there. Shaking off his embarrassment, Harry looked around. Draco, Millicent, Luna, Neville, and Caradog had taken beads. To his surprise, Seamus was holding one as well.
He waved the matter off. "Anyway, we need an explanation for your predecessor's hostility to Muggles and Muggleborns, and a cover for any confusion on your part. I was thinking the Imperius curse."
Lunch with Snape bordered on pleasant, and afterwards, Snape insisted that Harry share his escort back to the trial. While they were crossing the public room, however, a familiar figure moved to intercept them.
He finally managed to speak. "As long as you have adequate protection." He nodded at Mrs. Malfoy, including her in his consent, but spoke to Draco. "Enjoy your lunch."
Severus was clumsy at that too, but acquired direction from example. Harry murmured his pleasure as their lips parted.
"Let's move it a few inches further out," Harry suggested. "That shouldn't be obvious from the door."
Weeds were competing for the space where the Devil's snare had been.  Malfoy strolled along the line, surveying the jumble. On the uneven ground, Harry had to stay well back, so Malfoy would not hear him twigs breaking and rocks shifting under his feet, or notice the bending of grasses.
Harry snorted. "My aunt and uncle did, minimally, but only because Dumbledore made them keep me. They hated me, hated magic, hated my parents...."
"What? Oh, no -- he settled on a formula you can drink. He thought the fumes might make it out into the hallway, and didn't want to move someplace more remote."
"Yeah, I remember." Harry turned to wrap a leg around Draco. "I couldn't process anything. It was all ... why is he bothering me? And you were all over the place."
"He has not yet made a report in person; indeed, he has scarcely been present. The death of Mr. Parkinson has left us both rather busy, and in different ways. However, that is not a matter for you. More to the point, I am encouraged that your skill is growing to accommodate your power."
"Mm." Draco bent his head, and with a delicate flick of his tongue, skimmed the exposed slit of Harry's cock. Harry thumped back onto the mattress.
"Mr. Potter." Tom nodded, rather distantly, Harry thought. "Mr. Malfoy says he should not be seen with you in public, but suggests dinner in his room, at seven."
She smirked. "Not precisely, but I think you get multiple beads, rather than one. Shall we say three?"
Back already, is it?" Without waiting for an answer he turned to Snape. "I'll take him from here," he said. "Get inside, boy, before the neighbors see you."
To Harry's relief, they had arrived at the archway that marked the entrance to Snape's rooms. Before Draco could say more, Harry revealed the door and rapped the gargoyle knocker smartly against its plate. The gargoyle stretched out its wings and bared its fangs, but didn't bite. It knew Harry by now.
"Stop by again, if you like. And earlier, when I said you were doing well? I would recommend either of you for an apprenticeship." From a desk drawer, he took out a thick, narrow packet, and handed it to Harry. "Look these over, and let me know if you're interested."
, that would be why.  Actually, considering I didn't get a flood of 'huh?', I might have accidentally put it back in draft mode at some later point.
"Oh, those research notes are earlier," Draco said hastily. "But yes, that was the connection. Harry's blood is in Voldemort, through it would have been more useful if the transmission went in the other direction. But still, blood is one of the strongest bonds, and--"
Harry couldn't concentrate enough for schoolwork. Even his Defense Against the Dark Arts reading, which he had thought fascinating while telling Narcissa about it, blurred into disconnected phrases. After an hour, he gave up and pulled out his notes on the Death Eaters and other Voldemort supporters, adding his own observations from the Malfoy ball. When he came to Mr. Parkinson's name, he put a line through it. That left him staring at the parchment, feeling sick again. He created a new section, "Supporters killed by V." and put under it "Howell Parkinson" and "Regulus Black." He would need to ask Snape if Mr. Parkinson had actually been a Death Eater.
Snape's expression did not soften, but he inclined his head a fraction. "Why does this suddenly concern you?" he demanded. "Explain.  Did you know Auror Peggleton?"
"I believe we could be done," the headmaster said, rising. Harry stood as well. "Some day we shall get to actually socialize again -- or to have those wandless magic lessons."
The witch's house was a grey stone cottage with larkspurs blooming by the gate. An enormous grey cat greeted them just as they stepped onto the garden path, and wove between Harry's feet, purring loudly. The door opened as they reached it, and Snape pushed forward to enter first, his wand drawn.
"Mm," Draco said happily, a moment later. "I knew there was some reason I allowed you to rescue me from Fenrir."
