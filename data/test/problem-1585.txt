Breaths a HUGE sigh of consolation and slumps to the ground weak kneed in relief.
Tom folded up the paper, amazed that Dumbledore had kept it quiet as long as he had. He read just enough to know now was the perfect time to whisper in the right ears about Dumbledore rein at Hogwarts. If he so badly failed the boy hero, had he failed in other area unseen behind school walls?
Narcissa gathered up some simple healing potions and organised the house-elves to pack multiple containers of Harry’s special food for Severus to take back with him.
As for his fame, yes, it had grown with his statues as the second person to ever live through becoming an Obsurical. But Harry wasn’t worried. Draco had a good handle on it. He had proven himself to be extremely apt at manipulating the fame to Harry's best interest. Between that and the star-crossed lover’s thing, Tom had leaked to the public the worse Harry had to suffer was some sappy looks thrown in his direction from mostly the female population. Nobody felt like they had the right to come up and disturb Harry any more. Which pleased him immensely.
Narcissa was summoned. She was one of the rare fully qualified dark healers and her help was vital. She had taken a long look examining him before telling them the bad news. Healing Spells both Light and Dark worked by using the person own magic and body resources to power them. While Harry probably had enough magic to a least get him out of the critical stage, because of how malnourished he was there was no way that his body would be able to handle even the simplest healing spell. She had laminated that there were no more Cughtagh’s left as they could sing spells into a healing web. Something that provided all the energy and magic that the body could not.
“Right. But even if we weren’t family it shouldn’t of happen because?....” Sirius said leadingly
“Madam Pomfrey said you can go down to breakfast with us but then you are to come back and she will be keeping you for half the day before she decided whether to let you go or not,” Hermione said.
“And did it work?”
“May I kiss you?”
“Merlin Harry, look at your toes!” Draco exclaimed loudly. Harry stopped mid snarl and looked down at his bare toes, wet from the morning frost in bewilderment.
The red eyes blinked and broke Harry from the spell, he turned his head and looked around hoping to find something to help him but nothing had changed. It took him a long moment to realise that Voldemort hadn’t said anything else and wasn’t attacking him. Harry looked back to see Voldemort surveying him contemplatively.
“Harry, what happened yesterday?” Ron asked in a whisper leaning in close. Even Hermione looked interested. Harry looked around and while no one was paying them much attention there still were students passing them as they walked to the great hall.
“They are not meant to come off. These are both a gift and a claim of ownership from my Eros.” Harry looked up surprised.
“I am a Gryffindor.”
Harry wiggled feeling the cold stone scrape across his back and the rough fibres of the robe burn his naked skin where it wasn’t protected with clothes. Still, the sensations didn’t make him cease his movement. He knew worse was coming. He would be thankful for these tiny annoyances soon and wishing that this was the only problem he had.
“I see, this is most troubling,” Dumbledore mussed, “You said Voldemort didn’t attack you because you were too skinny? And he wants to talk with you?”
Draco had known that Harry was important and not because of any of that boy-who-lived crap. His instincts had been telling him so right from the start. And Draco had done everything he could think of to make sure he was involved with Harry. And alright he could admit it now, some of his pigtail pulling had been a bit harder than necessary, and yes there were one or two instances where he had gone way too far. But he had been a kid and desperate. He hadn’t understood why he needed Harry’s attention he just knew subconsciously that it was important.
Severus turned to see both the Malfoys standing in the doorway.
“That’s not what happened!”
They were the only one's present, once Pomfrey had stuck her head out and seeing who it was waved them over before disappearing once more into her office. None the less Hermione cast a silencing charm and Harry dully recounted what had happened. Not looking at either of them keeping his face pressed up against the window.
“Whoa, whoa, Shite” Sirius blurted out alarmed and shot off the bed to kneel in front of Harry, grabbing his arm. “Don’t hit yourself Pup alright? We will work this out.”
Padfoot refused to move from his spot curled around Harry.
“Ah, yes, I’m afraid the paperwork is getting quite out of hand. Still needs must. You’ll let me know if things change?”
Harry looked shocked at Tom’s blunt reply then grateful that he hadn’t sugar-coated it.
“Which makes him exactly like every other parent out there,” Tom concluded.
Blaise waited impatiently in one of the Malfoy courtyards. Draco normally invited him around much earlier in the summer, but they only had a month to go before they went back to Hogwarts. If they went back. Blaise had heard that something like ten percent of the school students had not renewed their tuitions for this year. What with the mass petrifications in his second year then the werewolf teacher and mass murder attacking the school in his third and now a student dying in a school organised competition. More and more parents were reluctant to send their children when the chance of death was rising each year. His mother had asked him what he wanted to do. Blaise had begged off, giving her a reply until he could talk with his friends. He didn’t worry about his schooling he knew his mother would organise tutors for him and the chances of getting a better education with them than at Hogwarts was high. If all his friends were going back, then he wanted to spend time with them. He missed the company of other people his age during the summer. He heard a noise and turned around.
She stroked his hair, smiling down at him. Harry could feel Draco completely relax and he leant against his mother’s leg. It was the first time they had voluntarily touched in months. Harry knew it was Draco’s hindbrain finally placing Narcissa back into parent category and not a potential rival. Logically Draco knew better, but his Eros instincts didn’t listen to logic. As both Eros fussed over him Harry glanced across the room where Tom and his dad were sitting out of the range of fire. Tom slightly raised his mug in a salute and mouthed the words ‘well played’.
Of cause just because he didn’t have Hedwig didn’t explain why he had not received a single letter all summer. Not one of his friends had written nor had Sirius or Remus. Harry was half wondering if it was another house-elf but figured his friends would have come to see what was going on when they didn’t receive a reply having already been through this once before. Since no one had been around Harry could only conclude that it meant this wasn’t the issue. Unlike second year this time, it really was that no one was writing to him. Harry couldn’t help his bitter feeling towards them all. Now more than ever he needed someone to be there for him and yet now was the time when the Light failed him the most.
There was nothing better than a story of star-crossed lovers, schoolboy rivals that slowly overcome their enemy for each other forced to see each other in a new light during Harry’s recovery. It had everything it needed. The hurt/comfort aspect, mated for life, overcoming the odds and a tyrant to be together. All helped along by the fact both Draco and Harry were quite good looking.
“If I have created it successfully it should bring back more of your homo sapient features whilst leaving the Serpentes ones alone.”
The old man wasn’t looking so good. Life on the run, with your allies, all locked up, and the populace turned against you didn’t seem to agree with him. He was thin, skin sagging, all his hair was brittle and someone had hacked his bead off to just under his chin. His once blinding bright and garish clothes were dull, faded and worn.
Harry wasn’t surprised when he wasn’t let out of his room come morning. Petunia tutted at the sight of him. This meant his face was too bruised for him to be put to work. Couldn’t let the neighbours see him in such a state. He lay on the ground angled so he could watch the clouds floating by. Fingers soothing rubbing against a leaf he found in his room.  At midday, his door was unlocked and Dudley entered to room.
He had said what was needed in simple points and then even better he had promised Harry that he could ask questions whenever he wanted, not didn’t force him to respond straight away. Another point in Snape’s favour is the fact he didn’t dump this on Harry then run off to do other important adult things. He had stayed and told Harry this awesome story song thing. Something that no matter what else happened Harry wanted to complete, he wanted to know what happened next. Also, he had no idea that Snape could sing or that he would have such a great voice.
He turned the water on as hot as it could go then stepped under fully clothed. He aggressively pulled off his top and pants and threw them into the corner then scrubbed his skin with soap until it was red raw. He stepped out and roughly dried himself ignoring the painful sensation of the cores towel against his sensitive skin. With practised motions, he got dressed and headed back out.
Harry on the other hand said nothing. Severus waited patiently perhaps Harry was trying to compose which question he wanted to ask in his head? But minutes passed and nothing was said. Severus frowned slightly, there was a chance that Harry didn’t understand, so Severus try to clarify it for him.
“I just can’t understand how so many atrocities happened right under my nose and I never noticed.”
“Yes, I did,” Voldemort look steady back at him.
“What!” Sirius barked.
Voldemort flicked his wand and the ropes disappeared from around Harry. The sudden loss of restriction made Harry fall to his knees, hands automatically outstretch to stop himself from falling on his face. His arm started to bleed again and his leg shot agony up his spine as the fall reopened the wound he had gotten in the maze. Harry grunted then shot his head up convinced this was some trick, but Voldemort had backed away and was standing out of arms reach, the hand holding his wand was lowered to his side. He turned and began to walk away pausing by the slumped form of Wormtail.
“Yes, there is,” Severus took a deep breath and reminded himself that not only Gryffindors could be brave. “I want you to engage in sexual intercourse,” He ignored the knowledge that he was flushing as he talked.
“What are we doing out here?”
re reads chapter.
Tom wrote out another quick message placed it with the rest to be sent off later that day. He planned to help whip up the fires of outrage for what happened to Harry. It would not only help get Dumbledore out of the picture but open up doors for Tom to put measures in place so that another young magical child would not suffer what Severus, Harry and himself to name a few had gone through.
“Alright, so tell me what does this particular potion do?”
“Its good to see you, Sirius,” Harry said.
“Harry, stand up on the table will you so everyone can see you unhindered.”
“Eighteen if it is an adult asking. If it’s another kid, then both of them have to be at least sixteen.” Sirius said firmly. Harry bit his lips, then figured Sirius would want him to ask if he wasn’t sure about something.
“My son,” Severus answered in what was becoming their personal ritual.
There came a brief knock on the door then Dumbledore's voice came through.
“Twat, it’s my fucking house,” Sirius muttered to Harry as people picked themselves up and headed towards the kitchen. “A bloke shouldn’t fucking need permission to use Merlin dam magic like he was still a weak willy school kid. Wanker.”
“Ok, um, your forgiven?” Harry said bewildered.
“Hmm, True, but neither did James.”
“I’m concerned that Draco may push for a physical relationship. Harry is not ready for such a thing at the moment. And depending on what he went through at the hands of the muggles he might never be ready for one.”
“No one wants you?” Severus asked trying to clarify. This was what Harry was objecting to? Not any of the frankly overly possessive claims?
“Sorry, I don’t know what came over me.”
“Brewing helps me centre myself, my Lord. And experimental brews are the best for getting my mind back to where it needs to be.”
Tom bit down on Severus’ shoulder as he gave a last thrust as he emptied himself inside. The sensation of both Tom’s release and the bite was enough to tip Severus over into coming for the second time.
“What!”
“Draco?”
The Author hopes that they managed to entertain their readers even if they did shove cliff hangers at them and have random surprises pop out of them. If the readers walk way saying they enjoyed it then the Author will be satisfied that all their hard work and effort didn’t go to waste.
Lucius sneered at the mention of the muggles but otherwise was content to let his wife talk.
“Come, Harry, it’s time we were off.”
The second the door opened, Harry shot through and belted towards his room. Once inside, he slammed the door the hastily slid under his bed curling up in the furthest darkest corner. His eyes glued to his door, waiting to see if anyone would come after him. By the time the sun set, Harry’s entire body had cramped up, but thankfully no one had come through the door. Not wanting to draw any attention to himself, Harry soundlessly slid out from under the bed and opened the wardrobe. He pulled out two pairs of uncle Vernon’s old socks and the quickly slid back under the bed.
“Don’t worry Harry, we are here for you and the adults will make sure you-know-who doesn't trick you into a trap,” Hermione offered and Ron nodded.
Harry was getting desperate for some water by now his room was a heat box with the sun shining down on it and no air coming through the window that had been glued shut. His mouth and cheeks were still sore from the hits from his uncle. But Harry’s mouth was as dry as a desert He could barley unstick his tongue from the roof and he had stopped swallowing a while ago as there was nothing for him to swallow. His lips were cracked and even though it was baking in his room Harry was no longer sweating. He knew he needed to get some water into him and this was probably one of the quickest ways to go about it. So he got to his knees obediently.
“Bollocks. Oh Pup, if you want to do something to make me feel better, all I need is a hug.”
Drawing back from the embrace Lucius turned to the reports, they instantly screamed questions at him trying to get the best soundbite for their newspaper. Lucius held up his left hand his right was still being held by Narcissa. The crowd quieted to let him speak.
Draco couldn’t articulate just how pleased he was. He sat in the bed with Harry’s head in his lap as he slowly stroking his hand through Harrys hair. As far back as he could remember Draco had wanted someone to belong to him completely. He wanted them to give every aspect of themselves to him and him alone. He had dreams of this fable person who was Draco’s. One who he could show off to others and have them look upon him with envy. And they would be right to be envious for Draco would give them the best of everything and in return, they would choose Draco over everyone else.
“No, Blaise? I guess it is going to be just the four of us for dinner then,” Narcissa said. “The Dark Lord also has business elsewhere tonight.”
“What?”
Draco snorted, then composed himself. “Do pass on my well wishes.”
Severus knock once on the door then entered. Tom looked up from the paperwork scatted all over his desk. The potions Severus had been creating had done their job and now the Dark Lord looked like his human self with his dark hair and brown eyes once more in place. The only snake traits he kept were a hint of scales on his skin. Internally he still had the snake’s ability to see in inferred and their incredible sense of smell.
Harry walked back to 4 Privet Drive in a daze, He snuck through the backdoor and leaning over the kitchen sink began to gulp down water trying to wash the salty taste out of his mouth. That really wasn’t so bad, he tried telling himself. It didn’t hurt at all besides from a mild ache of stretching his mouth and holding it open. And going by the grunt pig noises Dudley made he enjoyed it. Which means he won’t mention anything to Vernon.
Gaunt chest
Author checks on their Glitter and butterfly stock. They are running very low. Author bits lips nervously then check on where they are in the story.
Harry screwed up his face in disgust at the thought and shook his head.
“Everyone take their seat,” Dumbledore cried out, stopping the two Gryffindors from any further remarks.
“Is he transformed?” Severus mouth asked as his brain was too busy absorbing this new information.
“Sirius,” He asked.
“Are there any clear ones?”
Harry nodded.
“May I be excused?”
His dreams were vague but terrifying, there was no defined shapes everything hidden behind a thick smoke cover but his heart pounded in fear and dread crept up behind him, while guilt clutched his ankles pulling him down. He shot up in bed a scream strangled in his throat.
“Yes, he has also never taken better care of himself nor stood up for himself more than now. My unbiased option is that being a father has improved Severus life for the better.”
“I think not Headmaster,” Fudge drew himself up. “I have much to do and no time to listen to an old man's waffling on.” He placed his bowler hat on his head and stalked out of the room in wounded dignity.
Pauses at the non response from the crowd.
Harry didn’t bother pointing out that he didn’t want to do this either, just it was better than the alternative.
“Harry, Sirius in here please,” Dumbledore poked his head out again, commanding. Sirius sighed but headed in that direction, still holding onto Harry. He shifted so his arm wrapped around Harry’s shoulders instead. Harry didn’t want to let go of his godfather either, and so kept close to the only adult he trusted.
“I need Pettigrew alive for the trial!” Harry screamed back.
“Open your mouth Potter” Dudley crowed. Harry looked at the fat penis flapping in his face then up at his obese cousin. With the threat of future violence held over his head like the sword of Damocles Harry opened his mouth.
“I see,” Severus could tell this was something Harry wanted but was feeling unsure about. Severus prayed to Merlin that he didn’t say the wrong thing and take this joy away from him. He could see Draco watching him from the window seat and Sirius head was peering through the glass.
“Yes, Harry. It’s normal for a bunch of boys to bond by roughhousing. We did it in Slytherin all the time.” He said, his hand moving from the back on his neck to run through his hair
Draco shivered theatrically it was cold but not that bad, however, Harry’s entire body was trembling.
“That was the good news, I’m afraid. To live through becoming an Obscurial was a miracle, but it left its mark. They are both animalistic at the moment, with no higher brain thoughts happening at all. There is a chance Harry could slowly make his way back to us. The same cannot be said for Sirius. The magic around him is unusual, and I don’t fully understand it. But I can recognise enough to know that he will never reverse out of his Grimm form.” Severus sighed, such an act of unselfish sacrifice done for the betterment of Harry, wiped clean any debt and lingering animosity he held for Sirius.
Silver eyes narrowing in determination Draco strode back to his room. He had a plan to create to get him into the wing search it for whatever was calling him and get back out without anyone else being the wiser. He didn’t want to piss off his parents or push the Dark Lord, even if he was behaving like a reasonable person and not the tyrannical maniac his parents had told him stories about. Draco sat down at his desk and pulling a parchment towards him began to plan pulling all his Slytherin cunning to the test.
“You will, or else Dad is going to hear about all the perverted gay things you having being getting up to.”
Dumbledore looked down at Harry.
Severus stared at Dumbledore for a moment. “The war effort? Not the child’s health and safety?”
“I cast Finite Incantatem and other reversal spells on Mr Potter while he was unconscious,” Dumbledore said firmly.
“What?” Severus said.
"I know, I know, look I tried alright. I used the strongest super glue there was and the only bits of lightness or fluff I could get to attach was the roof quidditch and kissing scene."
“Don’t be a stranger now, I still expect you to turn up to our monthly card game.”
“He's mine!” Draco snapped at Severus and then bared his teeth. His sliver iris was glowing so brightly they were making their own light.
~ Come Nagini we are done here, ~
“Then speaking of unusual I would like to take this moment to apologise.”
“The two of them are wondering the remote moors of Scotland. I believe they will accept my presence again since I gave them gifts, but I worry that introducing a second person may be too much for them. The last thing I want to do is frighten Harry off, or Merlin forbid turn him back into an Obscurus,” Severus explained to Draco directly.
Dudley smirked down at him knowing that he had won. He released his grip on Harry arm but tighten his hold in his hair
“Because the next step is entirely up to you. I have enough information that I can make an educated guess at what happened. More relevant is the fact that I personally don’t need to know any more. I’m satisfied with what we have. You on the other hand may wish to know without any doubt what occurred or you may decline to want any more than this. It's your choice.”
He wrapped his hands around his torso trying to hold himself together. It felt like he was stuffed to breaking point with surging emotions but he had to hold them in. Lock them up tight. Dumbledore explained pretty clearly that he was to grow up and stop being such a baby about things. He was fourteen years old for fucks sake, why in the hell did he want someone to stay with him during the night. They were right, that was for little kids only. Sure, he had a bit of a rough day but you don’t see other boys asking for their parents to sit with them. His dormmates would tease the shit out of him for wanting it and they would be right to. What, was he some little cry baby wanting his mummy?
Tom went back to his paperwork leaving his Serpent to think in peace. He had heard it said that most people abhorred doing paperwork but it appealed to him. He had always loved the subtle movement and how a slight change or adding a simple punctuation mark could completely change the meaning of a document. Strategy games had always had a siren call to him. Right from his boyhood. He was unsure when he changed from moving from the shadows and working the long game, to the brutish blunt force monstrosity he was before his downfall. But he believed it had something to do with the number of Horcruxes he had foolishly created. For once in his life incompetence had benefited him. Somehow Wormtail had screwed up the resurrection potion just enough to give him his sanity back without making it impossible for him to rise at all.
And while Dumbledore scrambled to maintain his position. Tom would work on Lucius release. He had smuggled in an anti-Dementor ward the second week of Lucius’ imprisonment. It was the same one they gave to all the guards to wear. It would keep the worse from him, but he would still feel some aspect of the Dementor’s aurora. It was enough to help Lucius keep his sanity, but he would still live in absolute misery.
He knew the order was working for the Light and therefore were the good guys. But he had just been ripped violently away from both his mate and the first home where he felt safe and care for. So, he was clingier than he would normally be, especially around this crowd. He knew he should feel safe here, but he didn’t. Besides, from Sirius, there was not a single adult here that he would trust. They had not proven themselves to him, and as far as he could see that just treated him like a normal child, patting him on the head and not believing anything he said or they saw him as a hero figurine. Made to look good, but not good for much more than that.
Draco lifted the cover and revealed three bowls. One had Draco’s breakfast, One was filled with mixed berries and the last was a special dish with a porridge consistency that everyone had been giving to Harry. It was filled with high energy; high nutrients and it was helping Harry recover from the lack of proper food. Harry sighed soundlessly. While it didn’t taste bad it was very bland. It barely had any taste at all. Which meant that Harry was disinclined to want to eat it. What compounded the issues was even though the amount was quite small, Harry was being fed it somewhere between six to eight times a day.
“Yes, more!” Severus demanded, pulling Tom back to him. The second kiss started where the first left off. Never in his life had Severus being more in a position where he wanted to submit to someone completely. Yet the way Tom was drugging him with kisses, the slow exploration even with Severus body screaming hurry, hurry, more we need more, filled Severus with the desire to offer every inch of himself to Tom. Certain in the knowledge that all of it, even the ugly or unsure parts would be safe in Tom’s hands as he both protected and filled Severus with pleasure.
“Al…”
Bletchley tips her chin at the sight of Harry, a flicker of amusement crossing her features as she watches the group of girls and Louis pester Harry, demanding him to explain them everything…
Scorpius shakes his head, giving Albus an incredulous look. “We didn’t – I didn’t fuck him,” he says quietly.
Potter gives an agreeing sound. “And the traces of magic in her body?”
He never closes the curtains, Albus notes. Except now.
“Albus?” Quinn asks again. “Can you repeat your answer?”
Quinn nods at Draco and Potter, before continuing, “Miss Granger-Weasley said that Travers’s book had been destroyed by her cousin’s joke products, and thus she had felt bad for the girl, having heard what had happened during the New Year’s party. She had lent her book to the other girl, knowing she didn’t really need it for school, and would have it back once Travers had ordered a new copy. Granger-Weasley went to pick up the book from her own trunk, and brought it to Travers’s compartment, approximately one hour before the train arrived Hogsmeade. Granger-Weasley had then seen James giving her brother Hugo Granger-Weasley joke products like the ones previously mentioned, and had confiscated them before returning to her own compartment.”
called me. Not you.” She says pointedly. “I know you probably came here with firebolts glued under your shoes, but you could have informed me,” She says, almost hisses, giving Potter a disenchanted look.
“No, I didn’t.”
...The final chapter (and the one with most of the smut, of course) !
The Fat Lady gives him a grim nod and opens, giving him permission to enter the Gryffindor common room – his home for seven years.
Harry walks silently along the familiar path towards the front doors of the school. It has been quite some time since he last visited the place; it was probably Teddy’s graduation, he reckons.
“It feels like I know you,” She says very quietly, taking a step towards him. “Like we have a connection.”
“Of course, you do. Why would you let the Aurors do their jobs?” Potter says sharply. “Should’ve known this is what she meant,” He continues, grumbling under his breath.
Albus sees James lifting his brows and quickly looking away.
“In a backwards order; Locking spell, Vanishing spell, Levitating spell, Vanishing spell, Summoning spell, Duplicating spell, Colour Changing spell; all performed during that particular day,” Draco says, reading from the report.
Thirty minutes before the train reached Hogsmeade. Something Rose hadn’t clearly remembered yesterday, when she had been asked the very same question. Harry frowns, knowing that he needs to go over the details again with Malfoy
Draco rolls his eyes at Potter. “Oh, please,” he drawls. “A four-year-old could cast a simple
Albus’s brows lift up. “That! I mean
Albus clears his throat and starts to tell every detail he can remember to Quinn, who looks quite calm and friendly. He starts from the point when their father brought all the children – including Scorpius, who had spent his holidays at the Potters – to the station. After saying their goodbyes, he and Scorpius went to other direction than Lily and James; to meet their Slytherin classmates. Albus tells Quinn how he, Scorpius, Julian – whenever he wasn’t patrolling the corridors – and Cecil spent the better part of the train ride together in their compartment. He explains how he went to change into his robes, one to two hours before the train reached Hogsmeade, and when he came back, his compartment was empty. He tells Quinn how he assumed his friends were all changing into their robes, but when none of them returned, he went to look for Scorpius.
Harry nods, just as there’s a knock on the door. Quinn flicks his wand to clear the table while Harry goes to open the door. Ginny marches inside, a hint of a scowl in her expression, still undoubtedly steaming after what Albus had told Quinn, and somehow, deciding it is Harry’s fault. Which Harry thinks it kind of is, but it is not like Harry had any say about the matter. He didn’t choose to be the Chosen One – that was all Voldemort. All his life, he’s tried to stay away from the spotlight, and Ginny knows it as well. Harry knows she will eventually calm down and apologise. He just hopes she will do so sooner than later, as they really need to go over the circumstances of Albus’s situation together, and do something about it.
Moonstone grimaces, putting his cup down. “Boyfriends – no, I’m afraid I do not know about her past relationships, nor the nature of her relationship with Mr Riley. But as for friends…she seemed quite close with Miss Westen,” He says, and then his expression changes into a contemplative one.
Rose lets out a long, weary sigh. “Oh, Albus…” She whispers, and then, Albus feels her fingers curl against his waist, her forehead pressing against his back.
Albus, his father and mother sit at the teacher’s table opposite to Quinn. The professors sit behind them around a small round table.
And again, Rose goes through the trip, almost exactly like she had explained it the previous day. Except, the only difference being, that Rose had met with James and Hugo before she had met Travers. Harry frowns a bit at that, but as Quinn continues the questioning, it is apparent that Rose had merely mixed those two events, after being very nervous about her questioning. What she tells now, Harry thinks, matches to the times James had given them; some time after five.
Harry’s brows lift up at the words, and he doesn’t miss the sudden stiffness on Malfoy’s back.
“I trust my son. I do not believe he’s done anything to aid Travers’s death,
Quinn watches him carefully. “Were you acquainted with Miss Travers?”
Moonstone gives him a grin and flicks his wand to send the teacup to Harry, who sighs with content after the first sip.
“Nothing’s going to happen, Al, I kno –”
He can only hope it will not affect the inspection in any way. He thinks Malfoy is controlling himself quite well nowadays, but Harry still fears that what happened between them, destroyed the little improvement that Harry thinks has happened to their professional relationship during the past two days.
According to Scorpius, he had talked with Travers on the train, where she had threatened to spread rumours about Scorpius and Albus being… well, more than friends – which doesn’t make any sense to Harry. The two of them have never appeared to be interested in each other romantically, at least not in front of Harry. Why had Travers even made such a threat? Scorpius had told Quinn, that he had no idea why Travers had said such things, but Harry can’t stop feeling that perhaps Scorpius knows exactly what the reason behind Travers’s threat was. Did Scorpius feel threatened by something else the deceased girl knew? Would that have been enough for Scorpius to act? To harm her?
The Malfoys walk out of the room after fifteen minutes, after Malfoy stiffly informs Harry that he will be at the crime scene. Slughorn leaves too, and then it is just Harry, Quinn and Smith.
“Hey Gin,” Potter mutters.
The walk towards the school is a silent one, with Draco walking alone behind the group of Aurors and Weasley. He wonders why Potter’s wife has not joined them.
“Yeah. He is,” Scorpius says, and frowns slightly, before putting the book on the nightstand. “Tired,” He mutters, and pulls the covers over him before flicking his wand at the curtains.
“Did Miss Travers interrupt your – eh – intimate moment?” Quinn asks next.
Potter looks at his notes and clears his throat. “Nate Riley spent part of the journey with Travers, and the other part of it with his friends. He saw Travers having an argument with Albus and Scorpius in the corridor, participated in it in order to end it, and afterwards had an argument with Travers in a compartment. Both incidents were left unmentioned by him in the first questioning last night,” Potter says, looking around the room. “Riley explained today under Veritaserum that he had been jealous that his late girlfriend had still had feelings for Albus, and had been embarrassed about his argument with Travers, and thus had not wanted to mention the events. He told us under Veritaserum, that the last time he saw Travers, was in her compartment, where he didn’t see any books. Riley had left after Travers had intended to change into her robes and had asked for privacy. Riley had returned to stay with his friends for the rest of the trip. It was approximately one hour before the train reached Hogsmeade.”
Albus takes a couple of heaving breaths, and stares at his friend – who looks…rather pale, actually. A bit nauseous. The dorm is otherwise empty.
“I don’t know. Maybe I am...” Scorpius says absently, not looking at Albus.
Albus’s throat is suddenly dry, and he has trouble of swallowing. He has trouble of breathing properly. “Hmm?” He manages to ask, summoning a look of indifference to his features.
that, boys,” he says, giving both Albus and James a sincere look.
Potter levels him with a serious look. “Because I think there’s more to the story.” Potter says, not moving his eyes from Draco. “He didn’t really give Quinn a reason for Travers’s threats, and I have a feeling that he knows exactly why she threatened him.” Potter says, and Draco thinks the saviour’s gaze tells him enough: they want to know if Scorpius had done something to prevent Travers from fulfilling her threats.
Albus sits alone on the side of a silent courtyard, listening the distant voices of laughter, chatter, and goodbyes. Many parents have stopped by at the school to see their children, after the Headmistress cancelled the lessons for the day. He reckons that what went on the last three days, had been quite stressful, for many people – the students, their parents, the teachers – and that it was probably only sensible to let everyone take a moment before resuming to normal.
“What?” Potter breathes, a frown taking place between his brows, his eyes clearing. Then, as it did in Draco’s mind, it happens also in Potter’s. His eyes widen slightly as he realises what exactly is transpiring between them, and how it all ends if they allow it to happen. “Oh.”
happened before. He hopes it isn’t the case this time. “I hope not.” He says quietly.
Harry gives him an agreeing nod. “That is right,” he says and clears his throat. “We simply need to know everything that happened on the train, to help us find out if there was someone who was involved in Miss Travers’s death,” Harry explains coolly.
Still the man in front of him regards what he has just said as shocking news. He wonders, how Potter can be so…so bloody naïve? How has he managed to close his eyes and not understand his own popularity?
Harry is aware that Moonstone only knows Harry’s history with Malfoy from their school years, and nothing else. But still, the look Moonstone gives Harry, makes him stumble in his steps. Makes his cheeks flame.
He then glances his notes again. “I also took a blood sample and analysed it; there was an unusually high dose of sedatives in the girl’s bloodstream,” Draco says, and looks at the others.
Quinn nods at him. “Why did it take so long for you to get back at her?” Quinn asks carefully, and glances at Harry. “Albus and Miss Travers did break up at the end of September?”
, Harry thinks.
Harry nods slowly. “We will continue tomorrow, by questioning Miss Hazel Scott, Miss Westen, James, Albus, Rose and Scorpius under Veritaserum,” he says, chewing the inside of his cheek. “Unfortunately, we cannot let any of the students go yet, since they are all witnesses – as well as possible suspects – in a murder investigation.”
Harry lets out a weary sigh and briefly closes his eyes. “Look, Gin, – “
Riley frowns a bit. “I’m not sure,” he mutters. “Maybe forty-five minutes before we arrived to Hogsmeade? Could have been less…” His eyes widen then, and he gives both Harry and Moonstone a horrified look. “You don’t think I had something to do – no!” He says, standing up, looking furious.
Draco knows there’s something else, however. He knows his son – there’s something Scorpius has left unsaid. And that something, Draco thinks with a mild concern, will be revealed the next day.
Draco stares back numbly, wondering what the bloody hell has his son done? This is a fucking nightmare, he decides.
Quinn nods, “Tell me about your train ride…”
Potter stands up, a small smile on his lips as he glances at Draco. Potter gives Draco a once over, and Draco feels his throat working a couple of more times than necessary as a result.
He mulls over the two questionings from the past hour and a half, and neither Westen nor Hazel Scott saw Travers after the row between his son, Scorpius, Riley and Travers. Both were naturally asked, had they any knowledge of Travers’s death, had they themselves been part of it, or if they knew anyone, who was. Questions, which Harry knew would shock the parents, as they did Riley’s parents, and Mr and Mrs Scott the previous day.
Albus takes a look around him, seeing the shocked expressions of his classmates, before he quickly starts to locate his siblings and cousins in the Great Hall. He needs to see that they’re all there, that they are not…not the –
Albus rolls his eyes inwardly, wondering what exactly Riley has said, since he thinks it can’t be anyone else. He remembers that neither his father or his Head of House has confirmed that it actually
Julian shrugs, glancing at Albus. “Yeah. Fine. I’ll get my books after breakfast,” he says and leaves without saying anything else.
Fungbury shoves Ron, but grins at him all the same. “I see you haven’t.”
“Don’t, Hermione,” Harry says tightly, knowing that this is not the time to be desperate. This is the time to act. “I’ll take twelve then,” Harry says after a quick thinking. “Peakes and Figg are on call – they can cover the Office,” Harry states, already waving his wand to conjure a messenger Patronus.
Albus notices that Scorpius has been doing the exact same thing.
The food and drinks appear onto the side table, and Potter gestures everyone to take a snack, before Quinn continues.
“Al…” Ginny says quietly, her voice weaker than Harry has heard in a long time.
– as in Albus’s and Scorpius’s, since Scorpius spent his holidays with Albus’s family, while Scorpius’s father was abroad for work. Well, it was mostly Scorpius with Albus and his siblings, since Albus’s mum was called to some emergency business trip right after Christmas, and his dad was working half of the holiday, and spending almost the other half with James at his Quidditch try-outs – Albus begrudgingly admits that his brother is a rather exceptional player, and probably will make a contract with one of the teams in the British League.
Smith manages to look even more uncomfortable. “There was…a dispute, between James and Miss Travers,” Smith continues quietly.
Last but not least ;)
The man in question chews the inside of his cheek before he speaks. “Never mind. I’ll – I’ll see you later, yeah?”
“Did you tell them?” She asks suddenly, her voice lower and even more threatening. “Did you tell our children about our separation?” She seethes.
The book moves to the centre of the table, and opens, displaying the inscription Draco showed Potter less than hour ago. Draco watches silently as Potter sets his jaw and takes a deep breath.
“Ginny and I…we’re getting a divorce,” He says quietly, fixing his eyes at the floor. “What we have –
“Been lifting weights, Fungbury?” Ron asks with a teasing smile as he slaps his old workmates on their shoulders, sharing quick grins with them.
Harry thinks it over. “What kind of student was she? Miss Travers?” He asks.
Potter lowers his hands back to the table, a small grimace on his lips. “Yeah, they should. We were supposed to tell them, during the holidays,” He says, pushing his glasses back to rest against his nose, his fingers and eyes back at the bottle again. “Work came before that, I suppose.”
Riley looks contemplative, but sits down again.
“There’s a Locking Spell…but…I cannot detect any Unlocking Charms,” Potter states, glancing at Draco.
“Why did you have sixth year books in your trunk?”
Their conversation quickly moves to Quidditch, and to the final matches of the season between the Hogwarts houses. An hour later, their group has finally emptied their plates and returned to their common room to take care of their homework. It is not until later that night, when Albus has retired to his bed, that he remembers the argument between Scorpius and his brother. Albus decides to find out what is going on, and decides to confront Scorpius the next day.
Albus needs one look at the fifth year Hufflepuff’s terrified and ashamed expression to know it was her who had lied about Albus’s whereabouts on the train. He grits his teeth and steps into the room after his mother and father.
Harry sighs wearily, pulls off his glasses and rubs his face. “Bloody hell…” He mutters, feeling awful. What must the Weasleys think of him? Had they even known that his and Ginny’s relationship had not been working for a long time? Had they known that they barely spent time together, and only when their children were at home? Had they known that Harry and Ginny were basically roommates, long before Harry had met Draco at the pub that night?
James returns to his seat, and lazily looks at Quinn, who smiles at him.
“Potter. Long time, no see,” Moonstone says steadily.
“May I have your attention!” McGonagall speaks loudly, her voice higher than usual.
The hall is filled with anxious voices, whispers, murmurs, silent crying, nervous shifting and frightened gazes. The prefects from each house, all twenty-four of them quickly make their way to the front, towards the Headmistress and most of the professors.
“She did.”
“And if Travers hadn’t interrupted you?” Albus asks darkly.
“They will start with Scorpius, proceed with the Scott girls and then Albus, then Miss Westen,” Scorpius’s father says stiffly. “The Aurors are waiting for Miss Westen’s parents and your mother to arrive,” he adds to Albus after seeing the curious look on his face.
Quinn gives Albus a thoughtful look, and is silent for a moment. “Why do you think your brother invited her there? To the party?”
“Scorpius spent the train ride mostly with his dormmates; Julian Flint, Cecil Parkinson and Albus Potter. After changing into his robes, one to two hours before arriving to Hogsmeade, he met Travers in the corridor, where she unexpectedly started to threaten him. Scorpius thought that she had still been upset about what had happened at the party, after James and his friends had mocked her.” Quinn says, and then switches a parchment, and scribbles something onto it with his quill.
Harry lifts his brows in curiosity. “Oh? Where was she hoping to get assigned?” Harry knows that all main departments accept research assistants; a position, where one does have the possibility to move up in their careers, depending on the results of their assessment, and the chosen career path. Peele and Walter had both been research assistants for the DMLE at first, before applying to the Auror Academy.
“Don’t bother, James,” Albus says firmly, swallowing hard. He doesn’t want that – that blame – he doesn’t want to be a reason for something, whatever it is. He shakes his head, feeling his eyes stinging. “Don’t do anything for my benefit.”
“Sir,” Keir mutters, nodding at him as he steps inside the room.
He doesn’t know anything about the incident, and he hasn’t really seen anything that could help with the inspection.
Both Quinn and Smith leave the room for a bit – Harry knows that it is merely to give Harry and his boss some privacy, as they will both need to return soon back for Albus’s questioning.
Hermione shakes her head. “Apparently the girl’s friends found her in the compartment. No one was there, and nothing out of ordinary happened during the train ride, according to them.”
“Not even though Scorpius himself has said it had happened?”
McGonagall nods. “You may certainly question them in the company of their Head of House, but should there be a need for more
Of course, he has thought of the possibility of a set up – and had spoken about it with Hermione the previous night, after giving her an update of the situation. It could be possible – that someone did this to harm Harry, Hermione, Ron and their families. Someone could’ve done it for multiple reasons; to hurt Harry or Hermione – who are both in respectable and high positions at the Ministry; to hurt their children, because they are the children of the ‘golden trio’. But by whom it would’ve been done? The people who had seen their children in contact with Travers, were from different houses, different years, different families – yes, some of them were Travers’s friends, but they too were questioned under Veritaserum. Had there been a setup, it would’ve come up. Harry’s sure of it.
“A what?!” Harry gasps, taken aback. “No. No, no, no…” He says, stumbling backwards a couple of steps. “Is it – who is it?!” He asks, almost hysterically. His mind is reeling;
been at his son’s questioning, and he himself had thought that Scorpius had left some things unsaid.
As Ginny lets out a croak of incredulity, Harry, however, feels that everything is starting to make sense, even if the ‘sense’ makes him groan inwardly in exasperation and concern.
“There has been a death on the Hogwarts Express.”
Draco lifts his brows in question. It’s about time. He makes an unimpressed noise. “And I thought you brought me here to merely stare at the walls,” he drawls.
Quinn clears his throat. “Tell me more about your relationship with Miss Travers. Did you stay mad at her, when you were separated? Bitter? Sad?”
He grabs one, and then glares at Quinn. “Are you all taking the piss out of me?” He demands, his expression bordering desperate.
weaker, trust me.”
Harry swallows uncomfortably, trying to not be bothered by the way Malfoy’s sharp eyes track his every movement.
Albus lets out a weary sigh, feeling edgy. The bloody waiting is killing him. He needs to see his friend and ask what happened. He needs to talk to his father, so that he can ask if Scorpius is in trouble. He wants to walk up to the Scott sisters and Westen and demand from them if any of them lied to the Aurors, and put Scorpius in this mess in the first place.
“What is it?” Harry asks sharply, watching Moonstone carefully.
Harry gives McGonagall and Neville a tight nod. “I’m meeting with the crime scene investigator shortly, and will report to you after I’ve searched and examined the train and the…the victim. I can give the parents a status report then, but we might not know much at that point. Anything else to add?” Harry asks from his former Head of House and classmate, forcing his voice to stay calm, even if his heart is thumping wildly. What exactly will he find in the train?
Hermione lets out a long, weary sigh as soon as she stops in front of them. “Thank Godric we can soon put this behind us,” she says, her tone distressed. She then eyes both Harry and Draco with a scrutinising look.
The Headmistress watches everyone with a grim look. “Then, Mr Potter,” she says, addressing Albus’s father, “I believe you may proceed after breakfast.”
James’s gaze snaps to his mother; he gives her a deep glare. “You don’t even know what happened!” James says heatedly, “She embarrassed him! Broke up with him one morning, with a new boyfriend already, in front of the entire school, just like that!”
Lily looks at him carefully. “So, it’s happening, then?” Harry detects a mixture of dread and panic in her eyes.
out of line
Harry clears his throat and fixes his gaze at Riley, who looks back with reserve. “Mr Riley. Why don’t you tell us about the train ride? Start from the beginning,” Harry says, his voice stern, but his expression kind and approachable.
“…Just Harry’s fine,” Potter mumbles against Draco’s lips, pushing his tongue inside Draco’s mouth, as soon as Draco opens it to argue him.
Moonstone’s worried expression very slowly turns into an amused one. “Malfoy, right?” He says, giving Harry an odd look just as Harry starts to walk towards the door.
There are suddenly shocked gasps and murmuring in the Great Hall.
Harry follows him obediently, knowing that it is for the best, that, he ought to focus on his job, and not fucking Malfoy into his mattress, however tempting it sounds in his mind. Perhaps, if he somehow manages to solve this puzzle, there will be a time for that, later.
The woman gives Potter a sharp nod. Draco takes note that everyone else watches the situation intently.
Then, there’s a sharp knock on the kitchen window, and Harry nearly tumbles to the floor, as he jumps to stand up. He frowns and looks at the watch on his wrist; it is almost midnight, and Harry thinks it is rather late to owl someone. He walks into his kitchen, his throat tightening slightly as he sees the eagle owl standing outside of his window, a very familiar, condemning look on its eyes, as if knowing what Harry had been about to do in his sitting room.
to work alongside with mourning parents, but also knowing how important it is for them to see their child. And Draco didn’t always think like that… It was Scorpius, who made him like this, made him feel…compassion, apparently.
Scorpius looks a bit stunned, but then his expression clears into an indifferent one. “How kind of him,” he says, his voice polite, but the meaning behind his words not as so.
Not that he had been expecting anything else. What happened the previous night, had been a mistake – something Harry should not have let happen, regardless of how much he had wanted it to.
Moonstone stares upwards, as if trying to remember the occasion. “They were…talking about someone. Names were not mentioned, but it seemed that Mr Riley was upset,” he says, giving Harry a steady look. “But that might not mean anything.”
Albus stops in his tracks, and glances around him; the hall is empty. The classroom where Albus and the others were questioned by the Aurors in the middle of the hall is now closed, and Albus reckons the voices carry to the hall from one of the rooms around the corner.
However, the desire is still tingling in his groin, not lessened by the sudden wave of pain. He gives his lap a rueful look, before surrendering into his need, the craving and longing that have filled his chest not disappearing as Harry presses the heel of his palm against his prick.
Quinn is there, as are Slughorn, Moonstone and the Headmistress.
There are several students murmuring in every table.
Riley nods slowly. “We were, um…” He glances at Harry and Moonstone, before quickly looking at the floor, “snogging, in a compartment. And then Jenna…she was distracted,” he says with a deep frown. He moves his gaze up to meet Harry’s, who studies carefully his features.
“Constant vigilance,” Harry warns his Aurors a moment before they are whisked away from their Headquarters.
Malfoy suddenly chuckles. Harry lifts his brows at him, feeling a tinge of irritation, but quickly realising the man is not amused by what Harry had said, but by something else.
Then, the blonde wizard gives him a sharp nod and turns on his heels without a word, sweeping his robes at Harry as he turns away and walks out of the Great Hall, his head held high.
Draco arches a brow at him, forcing himself to not let his eyes drop down to Potter’s outstretched wand. “How kind of you to point it out, Potter,” He hisses, and then takes in Potter’s mixed look of anger and confusion and realises something. “Didn’t our beaver-toothed boss tell you I’d be here?”
There’s a short silence as they start to walk along the corridor on the third floor. Albus watches Scorpius carefully. “So…should I tell them how strangely you’ve been acting since the train, or not?” He asks simply, as they turn a corner in the hallway.
Scorpius flinches, and glances at Albus. “But you were there as well.”
Draco lets out an impatient noise. “As expected. Did you not listen as I said that magical signatures are quite personal?” He says with a crisp voice.
Their father looks utterly bewildered. “What are you talking about? What – what fifteen minutes of fame?”
“No offence my Lord, but as you are not my newly discovered son you do not fit the requirements for the situation at hand.”
“Good boy, try and get some sleep now.”
“What on earth was that?”
“Severus, this is a delightful surprise. Is there anything I can do for you?”
Severus watched as Harry began to stir slightly. He should be waking up within the next couple of minutes. Green eyes fluttered open and looked blearily around for a second before Harry began to take in quick gasping breath his eyes sped up flickering around the room in fear.
Severus was in a bind; Tom was too good a Legilimens for Severus to lie to him. But he also didn’t want Tom to think that Severus expected such actions now that they were in a relationship. Severus was more than happy with the amount of attention Tom gave him already. To ask for more would be the height of rudeness. Severus still had trouble believing Tom wanted to spend time with him at all, let alone do all the other things.
He heard a faint noise and glancing up Severus froze, not daring to even breathe. The gaunt black shape of a monstrous dog climbed the ridge on the other side of the plateau where Severus knelt. Ice-cold fear slid through his veins as he glimpsed the Grimm’s eyes. Madness was too tame to describe what he saw in them. Insanity didn’t even come close to hitting the mark. Severus could not adequately explain the raving lunacy derangement that it contained. While Sirius survived Harry’s Obscurus he had paid a hefty price of his humanity and sanity to do so.
Harry made an unsure noise and for the first time, Draco dropped his attitude, focusing completely on Potter.
Sirius gave a single wag of his tail then disappeared into a swirl of black cloud that shot across the grounds, heading to the floor to ceiling windows of the blue sunroom.
“But what am I going to get change into?” Harry asked
“Harry, why don’t you go have a shower, we brought you some clothes and we can talk after alright?” Hermione said kindly.
“Of course.”
The Order was still looking none more franticly than the mutt and the wolf. But they could not find Harry in the last two weeks of the summer holidays and were no closer to finding him now. Which didn’t mean that they got to stop. Dumbledore had every sorted into shifts according to their work and family commitments.
“Not yet, but he is in the process. Hopefully, now he had Harry in his arms and can see that he is no longer in any danger Draco will slow down otherwise he is in for a painful night. Growing wings and opening the emphatic sense is better done over a week then all at once.”
Smoke rose out of the cauldron so thick and dark that the figure that ascended was all but hidden from sight. They were nothing more than a vague shape towering over them.
“Sorry,” Harry croaked at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good boy,” Draco praised. He slowly repeated the action whispering praises as Harry kept his eyes closes and let Draco fed him. Once the bowl was finished Draco rewarded Harry with a strawberry. He smiled as his mate gobbled it down then opened his mouth demanded for another which Draco indulged him. Draco found himself whispering praises and sweet encouragement down on Harry who soaked it up greedily.
Stomps off muttering sourly to themselves.
“I just wanted to say, I am so thankful to be back with my family. And I pray to Merlin that the Wizengamot will see justice done in poor Harry’s name.” Lucius bowed his head and the flash of cameras went off again. “There will be no further comments at this time.”
“My Lord?” Severus ventured.
“I just mean, who wets the bed anymore? That's something only kids do?” Harry hear Ron say.
“Generally, my Lord that’s referring to traumatic memories.”
“I want you to fucking listen carefully to me ok?”
“Skinny little runt isn’t ‘e I’d though the savour ‘ave more muscle and stuff.” Mundungus mused.
“I knew you were gay for it.”
“Right, I’m off, I’ll see the pair of you on Monday. Count with me only a week to go till the Christmas holiday.”
“He could have Stockholm syndrome,” Hermione spoke up while also raising her hands.
Petunia shooed him all the way until he was outside then she closed the door. Harry sat down on the step wincing in the glare from the sun and reluctantly shoved his feet into the sneakers. He hated wearing them, especially during summer as his feet always feel like they were cooking in mini ovens. It wasn't helped that the shoes were more duct tape than any other material. Still, it was better than burring his feet on the hot tarmac when he was fleeing Dudley and his gang. Speaking of which he had best be on his way before he was caught.
Lucius nodded again as he took potion in the spot Harry had suggested. He struggled to keep the shock off his face. There was a lot more going on in those daily visits than the board games the Dark Lord played with Harry.
“Oh,”
“Pomfrey, can you please check your stores and write a list of what you need to stock up on, for I fear we will be in desperate need of them soon.”
“So, you want to share your firewhiskey with someone you love, right?”
Harry grinned weakly. Ever since he had met him, Sirius had a potty mouth. It was something other adults had tried to get him to stop. But Sirius had told Harry he had enough on his plate to worry about. He would not add watching his language just for other people with delicate sensibilities.
Narcissa and Lucius had been watching the going on’s but now that everyone was settled, they went back to the long hair care session that had been interrupted. Severus sighed sadly. Now that both Eros and their mates were distracted Tom had no reason to continue to brush Severus’ hair and he would stop any second now. And yet Tom did not stop he continued taking a small section and brushing it until it gleamed then moving on to the next section.
Harry rose and walked over to Lucius side, drawing his wand. Lucius gave him a brief look of startlement before nodding his head. This was where he belonged. Protecting their Eros.
Both Harry and Draco looked across to see Snape get out of his bed jerkily tie his dressing-gown close before leaving the room. Harry looked up at Draco unsure if they were in trouble or not.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t know.” He babbled pleadingly.
“I’m not!”
She gave him a long look before nodding and heading to her office.
Harry had gotten up when Narcissa had brought out her wings and he was now standing in the middle of the room swaying slowly. He was looking at Narcissa and Lucius, but when his mind was clouded no one knew just how much he was observing. Suddenly animating, he walked over to an empty couch and pulled one of the cushions off and holding either side of the big squishy square staggered over to where Draco was sitting. He dropped it at Draco’s feet.
“Indeed, I trust Draco will do just as splendid a job on my nails as he did yours.”
“As you can see our plan to rescue Harry was successful.”
Dumbledore stood up from the head table and the whole hall fell silence far faster than it ever had before. Everyone knew something had happened at the end of the tournament and they all wanted to hear what the Headmaster was going to say. All except Harry who felt dread creep up his legs and twine around his body.
Harry perked up at this and started heading back.
Rock-bottom had been hit last chapter, no where to go but up from here.
Harry just stood there not moving or talking, staring blankly as various members of the Order came up to him to say their farewells. It was only when Sirius came over and wrapped him in a bone-crunching hug that life came back to Harry. He wrapped his arms as tight as he could around Sirius ribs and held on with all his might.
“Any time,” Draco promised. Sirius pressed up against the other side of Harry and sandwiched between them Harry felt the last of his tension drain away. Together the three of them stood in silence, letting the peace of the morning soak into their bones as they watched the sunrise.
Padfoot was curled up at the end of his bed, once Harry moved, he padded up the bed and bathed Harry face while Harry wrapped his arms around him burying his face in the beloved fur as he clung to him. The feeling of holding onto his Godfather was the last straw he burst into tears crying hysterically. Padfoot whined worried squirming even closer. Harry had no control over his body, he was trembling all over and the tears were coming so fast he was completely blind. His chest hurt from the strength of his crying; breath hitching as he struggled to inhale. The feeling of helplessness only compounding the situation making it worse increasing the cycle. It got so bad that Harry’s lips began to turn blue.
The door opened again, Draco came in, followed by Harry who was holding his hand. Tom felt Severus stiffen slightly, he knew it stemmed from Severus’ appalling lack of self-esteem. He still struggled with the fact that Tom was not ashamed in any way to be seen with him. Tom deliberately didn’t release him and after a second Severus’ body relaxed once more.
Sirius sigh sadly.
“There doesn't need to be a trial, it's obvious what happened, Black must have been working in cahoots with Pettigrew and the two of them tried to finish the job they started in Halloween. They killed one boy but missed the second.”
“I’m glad it’s you telling me. You understand. Where someone else wouldn’t get it.”
He gave Draco a friendly one-armed hug, then did the same with Harry before heading off to the Floo room. Harry liked the hugs he got from Blaise but was still hesitant about what was acceptable friendly behaviour. He had a feeling that was one reason Blaise had suddenly started greeting and departing with hugs. So, he could both see and feel what was normal.
He bit his lip as the abasement of the act whelming up once more and he shuffled around the corner and into sight. Both of his best friends had shut up and were not talking once he reached them. Harry noticed from the corner of his eye that his bed had been stripped and all the linen was gone.
And Harry found himself swept off his feet as his godfather clutched him tight. There were ugly mutters as people squeezed past, but Sirius paid them no mind. When he released Harry his eyes flickered down and caught sight of the torc. Instantly Sirius placed his hands either side of Harry’s neck and barked out a word the Harry recognised was Enochian. The backlash of the spell threw everyone but Harry and Sirius off their feet.
“Ok, but not every black hair man wearing glasses is going to have hair like this,” Harry said, pointing to his head.
In the past, Draco had thought that if he turned out to have the Eros gene and transformed that he would be spending all his time having sex with his mate. Yet here they were starting the fourth day and they hadn’t even kissed. Or done anything at all remotely sexual. What was weird was Draco while he loved Harry completely didn’t feel the need to do anything along those lines.
Tom stood up when Severus entered the room and wrapped his arms around him, greeting him with a chase kiss. Severus cheeks pinked, and he ducked his head, still not used to the easy affection that Tom gave him. But he made no more to leave the embrace nor refuse the attention.
“Ah well no I don’t,” Severus said admitting defeat.
Speaking of benefits the bedroom door creaked open and a slivery blond head poke in. Harry still had no idea how the hell it was that Draco was his mate. Having being raised muggle he was still a little hazy on the whole Mate concept. The Malfoy’s had been very understanding and had even lent Harry a couple of books on the subject. Two of them were just general overtures but the last book was on what it was like to be a Mate of an Eros. As Harry had read it a lot of it had sounded well kind of demeaning, like Harry’s position was nothing more than a doormat. A weak will idiot who was led around by the hand. He wanted to talk to someone about it but he was too afraid to bring it up to Draco or his parents. He didn’t want to turn Draco away from him. He might have only had Draco’s attention for the last three days but Harry was already well and truly addicted. He would do anything, be anything to make sure he got to keep it. Including being a doormat if that was what Draco wanted.
When he went home, it was with the information that he would not be going back to Hogwarts and neither was Draco. He kept the information about Harry to himself. His mother nodded and penned a note to Narcissa to see if she would be interested in combining lessons for their sons so they wouldn’t be fighting over the best tutors.
“I warned you” He growled and grabbed Harry by the hair he yanked him up to his feet. The next thing Harry knew something leathery was placed over his mouth and chin, straps going both on top of his head and behind it. Vernon was pulling the straps so tight Harry could feel them digging into his skin. He tried to cry out but there was no way he could open his mouth. The most he could do was whine in his throat. The noise seemed to please Vernon who had a nasty grin on his face.
“Wait, Pettigrew has been kissed!” He asked alarmed. “No, he can’t be, I need him to free Sirius.”
Harry took a deep breath; he would get nowhere by caring on like a kid chucking a tantrum. Severus had told him multiple times that all he needed to do was speak to an adult and help would be on hand. Harry had been highly doubtful of this, but circumstances being what they were, he was rapidly running out of choice. He took another breath and wrapped his arms around his middle fingers clenching around the opposite wrist. Merlin this was tough. He knew he needed to say it but it was so hard, his inside was twisting with anxiety. He opened his mouth, then closed it again when his throat closed up. Closing his eyes, he gathered together his courage and placed his shaky trust in the adults.
“I see, are you sure that’s what you want?”
The combination of the spells left Dumbledore writhing on the floor in agony as it afflicted his body with multiple curses. He had lost three of his limbs plus most of the fingers on his remaining hand and for some reason both his ears and nose. Tom could see the remaining flesh bubble and splitting.
Mr Malfoy inclined his head. Harry looked down for a moment, this meant Mr Malfoy was in the same position as Harry. Here was someone who he could ask his question to and not feel silly because Mr Malfoy would understand completely.
Harry gritted his teeth in frustration. Ever since he had returned Narcissa had been hovering over him due no doubt to the fact she missed her mate. But Lucius was still in Azkaban, as per Tom’s plan. Now in theory Harry had no problem with two Eros wanting to pamper and spoil him. Unfortunately, what happens, is one starts, and the other come to join in. Then their territorial Eros instincts kick in. And it ends up being a verbal battle where they were viciously polite to one another, hiding their barbs in well-bred conversation. And Harry would end up with no pampering, just two people sniping at each other over his head. Draco had his wings out constantly. Most of the time they were folded down his back, they would puff up and spread a little every time Narcissa got too close to Harry. She was in the same boat, except that her wings were constantly agitated without Lucius being present. It was only that they loved each other that Draco and Narcissa hadn’t ended up in a territorial battle.
When he arrived, he was met with a semi frantic man who had snapped at him to stop grovelling and get rid of the foolish mask and to follow him at once they had a life to save. Voldemort had told him he placed a stasis spell the second he arrived but it was already crumbling at the edges. That was quite disconcerting as it meant that the person in the stasis spell was in an extremely critical condition.  the spell couldn’t stop death’s embrace. Not even one done by someone as powerful as the Dark Lord the most it could achieve was slow down the damage and increase the amount of time the healers had to work.
Harry paused as silently sat down on the top stair. He had spotted Voldemort heading towards Snape on the bottom floor and knew that the banister would keep him out of sight whilst still being able to hear their conversation. He knew that it wasn’t at all polite or nice to spy on people like this but as far as Harry was concerned this didn’t count.
“Fuck! Harry No!” He blurted out, pulling Harry off him.
“He had artificially messy hairstyle that no doubt cost quite a few gallons at the barbers to maintain. I have been informed it was quite the rage.”
Determination filled Harry, he wanted to get better and to be able to move on from this. What better way than to do it for someone he loved? This was perfect it was killing two birds with one stone. Harry got to do something to make Sirius feel good for a while and he got to work on overcoming a trauma from his past. Harry gently pulled the blankets off them both, then slid down the bed. He carefully reached out and nudged Sirius top leg slightly so he could get access. Then with hands he tried to stop from trembling, he slowly parted the slit in Sirius pyjamas’ pants and pulled out his penis. Harry took a deep breath, taking a moment to look at it and realise the sight of it wasn’t that scary. It looked pretty similar to his penis, just that he was looking at it from a different angle. Feeling more confident, Harry opened his mouth and got to work.
He was in Knockturn Alley’s oldest pub. It had no name but was the most popular place to meet with contacts or offer your services. Like everyone else there, Tom was hooded and had cast a concealment charm so that no one could see under his hood. He had just finished his meeting with one of his spies when the door pushed open and of all people, Dumbledore staggered in.
Following his Eros instincts, Draco rushed outside. And sure enough, Harry was standing on the grass lit by the pre-dawn light. As Draco hurried over to him, he could see inky blackness swirling around Harry’s leg before forming into Sirius Grimm shape.
“Daddy?” He questioned.
Draco was still pretending to be reading his book and not fretting over what his mate was up to when Harry came back into the room. He had a comb in one hand and a jar of oil in the other.
Blaise hummed neutrally and got up.
“Sleep, my beloved. I will wake you when it is time to leave.” Tom whispered, putting some of his magic behind the suggestion. Severus slowly blinked once, then closed his eyes, falling into slumber. The exhaustion catching up to him now, he wasn’t moving and crashing over him, dragging him under.
By the time they apparated outside of Privet Drive Harry had stopped himself from making noise but was now panting in fear. Everything was far too bright to look at and all sound was muffed, like he was listing from underwater. Dumbledore had been talking to him to the whole time since they left Grimmauld place, but Harry had not heard a single word.
Harry stepped out of the shower and looked at his body critically. The care, special feeding schedule, and exercise plan he had been following for the last four and a bit months were paying off. He no longer looked like a walking skeleton. You could no longer see every one of his ribs and his arms and legs no longer looked like bones covered with skin. He was still an ugly stick figure, but better than before. He would not force Draco to touch his disgusting body, even if it had improved. There was a long way to go before he would be worthy of having Draco touch his bare hand against Harry’s skin.
The pain of countless eyes boring into his nakedness felt like acid burning through him one layer at a time. No one was laughing or sniggering, and yet humiliation and mortal embarrassment flooded through him. He had gone so long not allowing anyone to see his mutated body, and now he had to show it off to a room filled with people. He had not allowed those who had cared for him to look, and now that choice was being taken from him. Bitterly he wished he was still with the Malfoys, with Severus and Tom around. Everyone there was very firm about respecting other people’s choices.
“Harry!” Severus snapped would this child never stop asking questions?
He didn’t have a chance to alert Dumbledore before he had to go. He knew the elder wizard had been quite alarmed at how successfully Voldemort had been hiding and growing more and more concerned with every day that had passed without Severus being summoned to his side. This wasn’t the normal modus operandi for the Dark Lord and with nothing to give them a hint of what his next move would be it had left them floundering in the dark.
“You hid it? Wow, thanks. No really thanks, you do not understand how much this means to me.” Harry said.
He eventually fell into an exhausted sleep. But no respite was given to him in his dreams. Instead, he was hunted, tortured, he killed Cedric and other innocents until their blood ran like a river and swept him off his feet. Only to dump him before Dumbledore who shook his head sadly turning away from him.
Harry grabbed hold of Severus’ hand and half guiding half pushing got Severus onto the cushion at Tom’s feet. Splotches of colour rose in Severus cheeks as he sat stiffly. When weighing up fulfilling Harry's request verse his dignity, Harry always came out on top. Still, Severus couldn’t look anyone in the eye, sure that he would see them mocking him. He had thought that Lucius position had looked quite nice but would never assume that he would be considered to be in the same position with Tom. Tom wasn’t an Eros, he didn’t have any interest in wasting time in such a manner.
“Come with me, I want to show you something,” Mr Malfoy said rising from his chair and heading out of the office. He took them to a gallery and then pointed at a painting in the corner.
“I think that Severus has had enough choices taken from him. And that he has earned the right to make up his own mind whether he wants to spend any time with you or not. You would be doing him a great disservice if you decided to make the choice for him, even if you believed you were doing what was best,” Tom said. “Have hope I know Severus is of the same mind as myself, that is that we firmly believe that the child should not have to pay for the sins of their parents. Since knowing he is a father, Severus has second-guessed himself, had sleepless nights worrying, been befuddled and turned around.”
“They hold our leashes,” Lucius said reverently. “We are there to fight for them. To enter into battle in their stead. We give ourselves to them completely And In return, they love, cherish, worship and treasure us. They let us know when to fight and when to relax. We can put all our worries and fears into their hands and let them take care of us.”
“Sir, please don’t send me back there. I can stay with Sirius in Grimmauld place or the Weasley’s or anywhere else. I'll won’t be a bother I promise just please don’t make me go home.”
Harry bit his lip knowing that Voldemort spoke the truth.
Harry Potter stalked towards him; his green eyes blazed with power. His glasses amplified the feral look being shot his way. Blaise backed up even more. He was Slytherin, there was no way he was taking on someone who could outwit a dragon. Not even for someone pretty as Draco. Yes, Draco was his friend, but Blaise knew his strengths it was every man for himself. Harry Potter spent the whole of last year proving he could take on people three years his senior and beat them all. No way was Blaise going to challenge him for anything. For a midget, Harry had some balls and skills on him.
There was some cheering before Mad eye Moody spoke over the group.
Draco paced restlessly through the Manor. There was an itchy bubbly coming from within him and he had been feeling like his skin was too tight. He had been avoiding the guest wing ever since the Dark Lord took residence in there as per his parents' instructions but something had changed. For the first month of summer he had no desire to head in that direction but a couple of nights ago that turned on its head. Draco couldn’t describe it, but it was like something was calling out to him. It wasn’t a scent or sound or anything that he could register with his five senses but still, he knew something was calling to him even if he couldn’t say how.
“Doesn’t this make you gay too?” Harry pointed out.
Tom looked at him critically then replied.
There were cries of wounded pride from the group and even Dumbledore reprimanded but Sirius wasn’t having any of it. He continued to cuss and curse as he led Harry out of the room and up the stairs.
“Oh,”
It was purely by chance Tom found himself in the right place at the right time.
“Oh,” Harry felt such a deep residence within him. That, that sounded perfect. Harry had always been a fighter and he knew he always would be. But to have someone else deal with his hated fame and leave him with only the concern that they were safe. Harry couldn’t think of anything he wanted more. It was exactly what he was looking for without even knowing it.
Dudley pushed Harry off him as both Piers and he hastily pulled up their pants.
Harry also didn’t understand why Hermione couldn’t stay if Molly was. It was this that threw him enough that he was no longer sure what was acceptable and what was not. But he no longer thought he had the right to say that he didn’t want to take his clothes off in front of all these people. Hands shaking, he slowly removed his clothes, watching as each item of clothing that had been tailor made just for him and for the first time fitted him properly was burnt to ashes before his eyes. Until he stood before the entire room without a stitch of clothing remaining.
“Have more inter-house activities.”
Readers at the end of the chapter: "........!!!!!"
Lucius became disarmed and forced into magic damping cuffs. Moody taking great delight to make sure they were on as tight as possible. The one bright point was getting to watch as Harry sunk his teeth into the restraining hand Dumbledore had on his shoulder. Dumbledore ripped his bleeding hand away and spelled Harry in unconsciousness, and Lucius knew they were done for.
“Come, Harry,”
Dudley grabbed Harry hair with his other hand and pull until Harry was stretched out between them.
The crowd puffed up pleased and nodded to one another. And reassuring their neighbours they had quite the eye for this or that curse.
“What’s that smell?” Ron asked scrunching his nose up in disgust. Harry could smell it too the sharp acidy sent. A second later it clicked what the warm wetness around his groin area and the smell meant and Harry face burned.
“I shall take Harry back to the Dursley’s today,” Dumbledore informed the Order at the breakfast table. Harry froze, surely, he had heard that wrong.
Draco looked down at his mate who was lying so trusting against him. It filled him with happiness and pride. His empathy had been slowly opening along with his wings and Draco had been getting random moments where he could feel what Harry was feeling. But when they were touching like this he could feel Harry completely. Once Harry’s negativity faded away Draco reached out with his free hand and grabbed the spoon from Harry breakfast.
“May I?”
He hadn’t seen Harry so far this morning, but that wasn’t an unusual thing. Sirius came out to snarl at him as soon as he apparated as per their normal morning tradition. Once he saw it was Severus, he had stopped making noise but had huffed in annoyance and returned to the tent.
Tom took pity on him, and after giving his hand a friendly squeeze, let go. Severus looked at his hand perplexed it now felt bereft, like it was missing something important.
Utterly humiliated Harry slid out of the bed. The air blew against the soaked area making the skin around his penis break into goosebumps. He took the offered clothes and shuffled off to the showers feeling the sticky wet sensation clinging to him. Bile burnt his throat and the acid of self-disgust swirled in his stomach.
“Mum’s gone to the shops. I'll let you out to use the bathroom but you have to pay me.”
None of his reading however had prepared him for the way he would feel as Tom slowly undressed him. The sensation of his broad hands doing a long sweeping glide over each bit of skin as it was revealed. To say nothing of the way his heart fluttered as Tom asked permission before each new piece of clothing. When Tom wasn’t whispering “May I?” he was drugging Severus with deep kisses.
Harry watched the pair of them for a couple of strokes, then nodded happily and walked back to Draco. He took the oil back then blinked suddenly huge pleading eyes at his mate as he reached out and touched Draco’s wing. Harry made a hopeful noise. And Draco laughed.
Harry nodded. He looked away and silence slowly settled over the room. Shifting slightly Draco looked to see what had so captivated Harry’s attention. He was gazing at the muscle on the arm Draco had been feeding him with. Draco couldn’t help puffing up pleased. He subtly flexed his forearm as Harry watched.
This was his son, Merlin dammit, and he would no longer let others control how either of them lived. They had their chance, and they blew it. It was time Severus took his rightful place and raise his son as his own.
“There will be some of Mr Weasley’s clothes available for you in the bedroom you both share. You may get changed into them after the examination.”
His answer seemed to calm the child somewhat as his breathing settle and he clumsily sat up. Severus wordless handed over his glasses and watched as Harry put them on.
( Author plans to end chapter with Harry shredding the leaf. Cackles madly........ Stops and looks over the supply of glitter realises they do not have enough to blind all their readers when they come after the Author with pitch forks..... Mutters sourly and adds on Severus bedside vigil.)
Harry shot up, smashing his head on the underside of the bed. He collapsed back down and ripped the gag off as he rolled to his side and vomited. Nothing but bile came up, and it burned Harry's throat and mouth as it left him. He could feel that his pants were soaked, having pissed himself in fear. Still gagging and crying, Harry pulled himself out from under the bed. He stood up on weak wobbly legs and slowly stripped out of his clothes. The sun was just beginning to rise, so Harry had enough light to find new clothes to change into. He cleaned himself up the best he could with the soiled one, then hid them under his bed. He would pull them out and add them to the wash when Petunia made him do the laundry.
“What?” Severus said legitimately shocked. Harry had been with the Malfoy’s for almost two months. Surely to Merlin they had noticed the boy’s disappearance before now!
Severus hadn’t even paused for a moment before revealing something he had never told anyone before. That his maternal grandfather had been a Cughtagh. And while he had never met him, he had performed tiny healing songs before and had them work. Narcissa and the Dark Lord had stared at him in astonishment before Narcissa leapt onto the news. She said that she knew how to weave a healing web although she didn’t have the necessary equipment on hand. Voldemort had taken over then and had gotten a list of what was needed. He then summoned an elf and had sent it off to his personal catchment to raid it for what was required.
A glint of gold caught Harry eyes and before he could think about it Harry found himself blurting out
Severus glanced back at the Grimm then flinched with shock. Sirius was staring directly at him, his silver eyes burning brightly and lips pulled back over wickedly sharp teeth in a silent snarl. Heart rabbiting it took a long moment for Severus to calm himself to see that Sirius had come no closer. Had not moved at all. Due no doubt to the hand still holding on to his ruff. Harry had his head tilted back looking at the sky humming tunelessly and swaying in the non-existent wind. Slowly his head lowered, and he stared aimlessly in Severus’ direction. After a moment, his eyes focused on Severus form. He looked at him with no recognition and mild curiosity.
my business to everyone,” he says with a shrug.
On his way to the school, Harry had met James at the Quidditch pitch, where the boy had been flying laps, looking somewhat unfocused. As Harry had asked if everything was okay, James had merely waved him off, muttering something about school stuff. He had asked James, if he wanted to talk about the questioning that would happen later in the morning, remembering how shocked James had been the previous night after Harry had informed him of the matter, as well as asked if he and Ginny could attend the questioning. When James had stayed silent, Harry had continued to reassure his son, explaining once more that it was only to clear his name off the table, as he had been witnessed having a dispute with Travers during the holidays, and because he had left his compartment for thirty minutes towards the end of the train ride, and unfortunately, Rose could not say if she had been in his company exactly that time.
Sirius gave a sigh and Harry felt him relax, glad he had been right that this would help he continued and a moment later he felt a hand stroking his hair. Harry gave a please hum, he loved having someone run a hand through his hair. He didn’t think he would get any pleasure out of this besides being happy to make Sirius feel better, but the hand didn’t stop its clumsy stroking, sending pleasant tingles down his spine.
Shaking, Harry got to his knees, “I don’t want to do this.”
The reporters surged up at this once more, shouting their questions. Both Malfoys ignored them, and with the help of some Aurors who escorted them out of the ministry. Once free Narcissa apparated them both to the safe house. They wouldn’t open up Malfoy manor until the trials for both Lucius and the Order were all officially done.
Harry slid down the door, horror filling him, and tears began to fall. He knew it; he knew that act was perverted and wrong. His instincts had been screaming at him, but like the foolish brain-dead idiot he was, he went ahead and did it, anyway. He must have completely misunderstood what Severus was trying to teach him. Fuck, he shouldn’t be allowed around people. He should be locked up, so he didn’t attack someone else. The fact it was done in his misguided attempt to show affection was no excuse.
“A faggot, you must be. You keep calling out the boy’s name waking me up every night. I reckon that makes you a faggot.”
The court session opened with three Aurors being escorted in by their colleges. Amelia Bones stood up and began to talk. The beginning of it was political waffling that every court opened with Tom didn’t bother to pay attention to it. The charges were read, the most interest been entry without a warrant, false imprisonment, and aiding and abetting abuse of a minor. The crowd muttering darkly before it came time for the accused to defend themselves.
He did consent to drinking a cup of tea and slipping an apple into his pocket for later. There was a chance he might become hungry at some stage today and he had been squirrelling food away since he was five years old. There was no way he could break the habit now.
Harry didn’t want to be a burden, the last thing he wanted was for Draco to come to his senses and find himself a different mate. Someone who was actually worthy. So, he picked up his spoon and started to eat. Draco beamed at him happily and Harry squirmed. His insides feeling warm that he had pleased Draco.
The adrenaline was fading from his system and his body started to shake teeth chattering as a cold wave swept over him.
Tom snorted to himself. It was completely ridiculous, but the public would lap it up. And Draco would flourish under the attention, wielding the power of their reputation and putting it to good use. And making sure Harry didn’t have to worry about it. Harry would finally get the support and encouragement he needed. Not just from those who knew him personally, but from absolutely everybody he asked.
Sirius took him to his bedroom and got Harry some of his own clothes. He then left Harry alone in the room to get changed. Even though the clothes swam on him Harry was extremely grateful. He didn’t want to wear Ron’s stuff. Once he was done he let Sirius back in and took a grinned when Sirius both locked and warded the room keeping all the other busybody out. He even added a sound charm, so they didn’t have to listen to either Molly’s scolding or Dumbledore lecture.
“Why have you not asked to view my memories?”
Severus knew he had bombarded Harry just as he awoke while he was still trying to get settle and felt bad about it, but he didn’t want to waste any time on useless pleasantries as he knew himself well enough to know if he could find a reason to tarry he would do so and one thing would lead to another, the next thing Harry would do something that annoyed him and in his pride, he would refuse to apologise to someone who owed him an apology and so on and so forth until months or even years would pass with Severus never admitting his wrongdoing. Not wanting to head down that path he was resolute that the pair of them would take this new beginning and start off on the right note.
“Yes,” Draco replied, pulling out a see-through bottle. At least it will be nice and subtle.
“Some, but not to this extent.”
He had been through so much over his lifetime, but he couldn’t be happier with how it had turned out. He had a mentor and guide in Tom, loving family in Lucius and Narcissa. A constant, faithful companion in Sirius. And most of all, he was blessed with a perfect Father in Severus and his brilliant mate Draco.
Not wanting to make this second conversation between them to awkward Tom placed the Go board down on the table that was placed between the two armchairs and began to set out the pieces. The sight of which had intrigued Harry enough that he had lost the tense frame he was in and was now watching him with mild curiosity.
– it hasn’t been working for a long time now,” Harry mutters, licking his lips. “She’s been living in her own flat for the past four months. She’s dating someone new.
Albus’s father clears his throat loudly, “I think that’s enough!”
With a sigh, he trudges upstairs into his bedroom, shucks away his Auror robes, and proceeds to take a long, scalding hot shower, determinedly keeping his mind blank. After washing up, he puts on a loose t-shirt and his tracksuit bottoms, and hesitates for a moment. Knowing that he needs to eat first, before his mind takes over and before he starts to go the case through in his head in order to write down the report his boss is surely expecting on her desk by the next morning, Harry walks quickly back downstairs to the kitchen.
“Yeah,” Harry murmurs, his eyes already flickering to the parchments. “Oh, Peele?” He says, remembering something from earlier.
“Hold on a second, Albus. I’ll be right back,” Harry says and walks up to Parkinson.
Scorpius watches Albus’s silent conversation with his brother curiously, before speaking, “So, either a Hufflepuff or a Ravenclaw,” he says.
James clears his throat and looks up at Quinn. “Yeah,” he mutters, swallowing hard. “After that…I gathered everyone together, and – um – basically told her that she was a daft cow to not realise we were taking the piss out of her – that she had to be deranged to even think we’d invite such a slag to party with us,” James says very quietly, looking everywhere but at Harry, Ginny or Quinn.
Potter moves to the door, trails a hand over it, feeling the magic in it, and frowns.
Air leaves Harry’s lungs, and he swallows hard, his head still spinning. He feels relieved that his children are alive, but terrified as well, since someone – a girl from an old Death Eater family was found dead. He knows it could get ugly. “What do we know?” Harry asks simply, gritting his teeth, forcing himself to calm down, and to do his job.
Albus hastily retreats to an empty classroom behind him, and manages to close the door just before James rushes past it towards the Great Hall.
James swallows hard and gives her a shrug. “I don’t mind if mum and dad are there.”
“You wish to use Veritaserum?” Malfoy asks blankly, his jaw hard. Harry lets out a small sigh, but Malfoy continues, a hint of a sneer on his expression. “Tell me, Potter…is it
“Whatever,” Scorpius mutters, resign in his voice.
But he is not there, now. Albus moves his focus to Scorpius and his classmates. “We need to do something,” Albus states, chewing the inside of his cheek, watching his friends with what Scorpius has identified as ‘the reckless Gryffindor gaze’ – and teased Albus mercilessly about it, telling his friend that it must run in the family.
Draco doesn’t really listen, and instead flicks his wand to gather his stuff, and then stands up knowing that if he doesn’t leave now, he might say something he could regret later.
Albus processes his words. “And if I didn’t? If I wasn’t hurt? Would you have regretted it?” He asks blankly, his eyes moving over James’s anguished face.
Albus swallows hard, and looks away from Rose, trying not to think how many times Scorpius has given him the same gesture, and how many times Albus has thought nothing of it.
“Hey, mate,” Ron says, a bit stiffly, stopping in his tracks. Harry sees the worry and dread in his eyes.
After a moment, Harry pushes back his glasses, and leans back to look at her.
Neville grins at Harry through his worried expression, while McGonagall gives him a wry look. “I do not have the time to remind you that we are in a first name basis, Harry, but may I say, that we are the ones who are glad to see you,” she says in her strict way, although Harry can detect relief in her tone.
what goes on in his friend’s mind. But he doesn’t have to see to know exactly what.
James clears his throat, and Albus can feel his brother looking at him before he speaks. “There are… um… some people, who… make advances at Albus because, well, basically because he looks like you. Like
“Okay, thanks. Then, I suppose, meet me at the Three Broomsticks, let’s say…” Potter mutters, checking his watch, “in three hours. If you’re done by then, that is?” He asks, giving Draco an inquiring look.
Two hours later, he’s somewhat finished, at least for the day. Harry decides to review the report in the morning before sending it out to Hermione. He will be working the next day, of course he is, but he also needs a good rest, and that definitely means he will not be at the office at the hour Hermione is expecting Harry’s report. He leans down against the sofa, his head falling to the backrest, feeling heavy. Harry stares at the ceiling, his mind still in the case: still going over the details, still checking that he has seen all the clues, that he has paid enough attention to the evidence. The result was clear, Harry is sure of it, but he still needs to go over the case in order to let it go – something he had to learn to do, as years went by and all his cases and all the people that were part of them, were all there, stuck in his head.
“Yes. Mrs Potter is there as well,” He says calmly. “We’re ready when you are.”
McGonagall gives Harry a small smile. “I have faith in you, Harry. I know you are doing everything you can. I merely wish we could already put this behind us.”
Albus’s eyes flick over to Julian, who is the only one left in their dorm, save for Scorpius and Albus, and is in the middle of rummaging his trunk.
Harry grunts his reply, as he does to the next nine Aurors, who sit along Keir, facing the front of the class. Smith and Quinn take their places next to their partners, as Harry flicks his wand to close the door with an added silencing spell.
Albus shakes his head. He can’t believe he just said that to his father, and also – why would his father even be shocked? Surely, he himself has encountered similar people, being the actual Saviour.
“Did they concern Scorpius?”
Scorpius’s eyes snap back to his eyes widened with surprise. “W-What?” He breathes.
misses his own bed, opposed to this lumpy haystack.
Their father discharges Albus and James and tells them to go have breakfast, and adds that Albus and Scorpius will be questioned first, as both of them have a free period in the morning. James’s questioning will be after lunch, and Rose’s after her afternoon classes.
“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” Albus asks, heatedly, cursing inwardly for letting himself fall into his brother’s trap once more, as the smug look on James’s face only intensifies.
Scorpius listens quietly, seeming almost relieved to not be taking part in the conversation, and only looks somewhat amused as Albus tells the others a very colourful version of their New Year’s party. Well,
something to confess. Him being private about his life has now spurred you on, and you’re certain he is hiding something!” Ginny rants.
” Harry mutters, and immediately, the stone wall opens up into a passage, revealing the large, underground room, resonating a greenish light both from the round lamps and the lake.
“Your oldest son organised a party during New Year’s Eve, and Miss Travers was seen there,” Smith says, looking very uncomfortable.
, was speaking on Draco’s behalf during the trials after the war, making sure Draco and his parents stayed away from Azkaban. What Potter
Harry continues, and gives them both a stern look. “I’ll meet you in the morning, okay?”
He stops in his tracks, forcing away the nausea and the ache in his chest, and looks at her. “You okay?”
He thinks of Hermione and Ron, their distressed expressions, the gratitude in their eyes as they told Draco how incredibly thankful they were that Harry was okay, and that Draco had helped him. He remembers their shocked looks when Draco informed them with a crisp tone that Harry had decided to perform an experiment that nearly cost his life.
Albus chuckles, involuntarily. “We’re best friends?” He says, somewhat bewildered by the question.
Draco’s eyes flicker to Granger, who looks mildly surprised and moves her gaze away from the two men. He looks back at Potter and nods, thinking the Auror has most likely figured out that Draco is still peeved about the New Year’s and wants to apologise for it.
Draco nearly dies, gasping for breath, as Potter starts to jerk him off in swift motions. Potter brings his mouth against Draco’s, kissing him urgently, sucking and licking his lips, biting them.
The door shuts with a click, and Malfoy stares at Harry, a somewhat contemplative look in his eyes. He then clears his throat and lifts his brows inquiringly. “Potter?”
“Distressed,” Rose says instantly. “Because most of her things in her trunk were covered in the Permanent Colour-Change Ink by Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes,” she continues, “Which can be removed only by their Guaranteed Five-Second Ink Removal potion.”
for a long time.
Harry exchanges a look with Quinn. It should not be possible for Albus to lie under Veritaserum.
Harry is utterly amazed and taken aback by his fourteen-year-old girl. He’s astonished how bright she is, how – how mature she is, as well as surprised by her insightfulness. At the same time, he feels mortified, that Albus…that Albus had known so long. And hadn’t said anything to Harry or Ginny – or his brother or sister, for that matter, until yesterday. But he
But, what he wants often does not happen. Which is clear, as his brother plops down to sit next to him on the bench.
“Mr Malfoy. Scorpius.” Albus’s father says simply. “Come in, please.”
“You saw her?” His father asks curiously. “When was this?”
Ginny lets out a shocked breath, gaping at James. Harry is similarly stunned; he stares at his son, feeling horrified, and wonders who is this boy and what has he done to Harry’s good-mannered son James? Because until now Harry had been sure James doesn’t speak like that about others, or treat others like he apparently had.
Quinn glances around the table before resuming back to his notes. “He had asked Travers to leave them alone, but the girl had warned Albus to stay out of it, threatening to expose Albus’s secrets to the other students,” Quinn says, his face slightly red.
“A student has been found dead on the Hogwarts Express. Jenna Travers. We do not know much, but as we will be investigating a school with several hundreds of inhabitants, it should be kept in mind that it is possible for a murderer to hide amongst them. We will move with a Portkey –” Harry says, his voice trailing off as the mentioned travelling method – a long thick rope – appears next to him with a loud crack.
James looks stunned, almost frightened, and he shakes his head slightly. “I don’t – I didn’t –” He stammers.
As soon as the door closes, she jumps on him, pinning him against the door, before her lips come crashing against his, their teeth knocking together.
in Scorpius’s character, compared to his father. Something, Albus thinks comes from Scorpius’s mother’s side. No, even if the father and son look like one another, they still have very little in common otherwise.
Harry would have liked to marvel the atmosphere in the room, study the portraits - especially the one of Helga Hufflepuff holding her famous cup - and sit by the fireplace in one of the very comfortable looking armchairs, but he had a job to do. Harry’s eyes sweep over the students in the room, meeting mostly frightened expressions. His eyes stop at a group of three; a girl with tear-streaked face, a boy who looks shaken, and another one with a haunted expression etched on his face.
“I saw her on the train,” Albus says when James finishes with his summary.
Harry whispers to Malfoy’s lips.
“Only hours after her death, there was an unusually high dose of sedatives in Miss Travers’s bloodstream.” Harry explains wearily. “We received a confirmation later, that the potions cabinet at Miss Travers’s home was missing vials of Calming Draught. Three to be exact.”
Cory narrows his eyes at Cecil. “Unlikely. The train doesn’t take in outsiders. There are wards to prevent that sort of thing…”
Malfoy gives him mild sneer. “Quite fascinating, your kissing methods – I actually can’t feel a thi –”
“What – what about Miss Travers?” Albus’s father asks after a short moment. “She was one of those people, then? But…but you thought differently of her?” He asks. When Albus says nothing, their father turns to James. “The dispute at the party was about Albus?” He asks, apparently putting two and two together.
McGonagall lifts her both hands up. “Everyone, sit down!” She orders with a loud and harsh voice, before she continues, “And for the love of Merlin, please calm down!”
Peele laughs and nods at him before he takes his leave.
When Zachary and Cory – who had both stayed at the school for the holidays – snigger as they explain every amusing event that took place there; how sozzled some of the teachers were at Christmas dinner and how they tried to hide it from the students, how they managed to beat a group of sixth and seventh-years in a
As soon as he’s in the confines of his own room, Draco takes in a long, steadying breath, and presses his hands against his eyes. What in the name of Salazar was he thinking? In which scenario snogging Potter like his life depended on it, and letting Potter wank him into the brink of an orgasm is a good idea? Suppressing a groan of frustration, Draco quickly disrobes himself, and slips into the lumpy bed, making sure his wand is ready to wake him up early in the morning, and willing his somewhat painful erection to go away. He needs to get a grip. His son’s questioning is the next morning. And Potter is still…
Quinn looks at Harry, helplessness flickering in his eyes, asking with his gaze if they should continue, or if they should somehow try to figure out if Albus is lying.
Potter gives Bones a bemused look. “James?”
He trails a hand through his hair. “Yeah. I just want to get this case figured out,” Harry mutters, his mind whirling, and thinks bitterly how he’s not any closer figuring out what happened to Travers than he was three days ago.
Potter stammers something under his breath, and then they both seem to realise that the room is empty of Aurors, but Draco is still there.
Harry lets out a weary sigh, brushing his fingers through his messy hair. “I know…” He mutters, staring into the distance. His sons are both, more or less connected to Scorpius.
Scorpius shakes his head. “No. I told Albus I wanted to be by myself, and I went to search an empty compartment, where I stayed for the rest of the trip. I saw Albus at the carriages the next time.”
However, as he walks across the Entrance Hall, he can hear his name uttered in a sharp whisper.
“Potter.” Draco says mutedly, appearing to Harry’s side.
He shivers as he thinks of both.
As soon as Albus and Scorpius walk into the common room from their dormitory to meet the many anxious faces, they see Slughorn beckoning them to him. Albus shares a look with Scorpius, before they walk up to their Head of House. Slughorn tells them that the Headmistress wants to discuss with both of them before they’re allowed to head for breakfast, and says that he will accompany them shortly, after giving instructions to other students. Slughorn also tells them that the Aurors have cleared the school to be safe enough for students to have their meals in the Great Hall, attend classes and mandatory appointments, but that all other hours the students are expected to stay in their common rooms and dormitories, until the investigation is finished.
Potter stares at him for a bit, before he nods and takes his leave.
Hermione grimaces. “I was dreading you’d say that…” She says, leaning against the wall, watching upwards at the ceiling.
Albus nods. “Yes, I did.”
“Are you all right James?” Ginny asks quietly, as they step outside the room.
Potter still watches him with incredulity, but then – and Draco really tries not to smirk as he sees it, but fails brilliantly – Potter’s expression changes, at first into a deep contemplative frown, before the utter and terrified shock takes over his features.
The village is empty – there’s only Ron, Berrycloth and Fungbury. Harry tells Ron that everything was well with his children, and that they haven’t yet made any breakthroughs in the case. He tells Ron to turn in for the night, who does so albeit reluctantly, and asks if Fungbury had managed to get them rooms in the village like he asked earlier. He had, and tells Harry that Malfoy is already in one of the pub’s private meeting rooms, waiting for him.
Albus suppresses an eyeroll, suppresses the urge to throw something, or trash something. “Yes,” he says with a clipped tone. Trust Rose to see everything, even though they don’t sit at the same table.
Albus frowns at his friend, feeling that Scorpius is acting very strangely, and has been like that since the train. “What is going on with you?” Albus asks, shifting closer to his friend. “Are you…are you upset about what happened? To Travers.” He asks, even though he knows it cannot be that.
Both Albus and Scorpius give him wary nods. Albus's mind whirls:
Harry thinks the other man must’ve been there, in the compartment, for several hours.
Granger pops in right as Quinn and Keir retreat to their rooms, and Potter starts to give Granger a summary of how the investigation is proceeding. Draco packs up his notes, ready to leave the meeting room, but is stopped by Potter.
“What do you
Draco wakes up to his wand buzzing next to him on the nightstand. He blinks, taking in his surroundings; he is in the Three Broomsticks, in one of the small rooms upstairs that Susan Bones – the landlady – kindly arranged for him and the Aurors.
. The rage inside Albus also makes him perhaps a bit ill-mannered, as he reaches Scorpius’s bed with a couple of long strides, grabs the book and throws it forcefully across the room, before turning back to his friend, fuming, his fingers curling into tight fists that he barely can hold against his sides. He wants to throttle Scorpius so badly it nearly makes him dizzy.
They briefly go through each of the questionings again, go through the wand inspections, along with every possible oddness Prone has seen in the Marauder’s Map, but Harry feels that there’s nothing new. He tells his Aurors, that most of them will be leaving the school the next morning – all but Fungbury and Berrycloth; who will be stationed in the village, as well as Keir and Quinn; who will be stationed in the school.
“Tell me you whole name and birthday, Rose,” Quinn says steadily.
Granger leaves the meeting room sometime later, bidding good night and informing Potter that the Weasley clan has left to their homes.
Albus actually slept with the girl.
Quinn nods. “Good. Do you know why you are being questioned again?”
“What is it, James?” Harry asks, stifling the urge to check the time – he is on the clock, as they say, and he really hopes that this is important. “I need to get going soon,” he mutters.
along with the basic magic detection spells.”
“Potter.” Draco murmurs, looking ahead. The other Aurors seem to be minding their own business. “Isn’t – ” he clears his throat. “Is Mrs Potter not joining us?”
Hermione gives him a nod. Then, she lets out a long sigh. “The Minister needs an update,” she says with a small grimace. “I have to go back to the Ministry.”
Harry has mixed feelings of his eldest’s career choices. While he is thrilled that James aspires to be a professional Quidditch player like his mother was, he also thinks that James might be wasting his talents on other areas for a handful of years in Quidditch. Harry knows James is very bright and his grades are outstanding, even with all the mischief he has been up to during the school years. Harry thinks James could do almost anything after Hogwarts.
Albus shrugs at Quinn. “Yeah. She – um – I thought she actually wanted to be with me, but apparently, all she wanted, was to fuck a copy of the Chosen One and brag about it afterw– “
“We should head upstairs,” Potter mutters then, looking away. “I need to be at the school before breakfast to talk to the Headmistress…”
Harry taps the barrel two from the bottom, middle of the second row, with the rhythm of ‘Helga Hufflepuff’, as McGonagall instructed to his Aurors, when Harry had been visiting the crime scene.
“Sit down,” their father grunts, and waves his wrist to summon three chairs to them.
Albus quickly closes his mind, schools his expression into a blank one, before nodding at his friends and walking closer so his other house-mates cannot eavesdrop them. “Is Scorpius in dorm?” He asks stiffly, glancing at the direction to their dorms, suppressing the urge to grit his teeth together, forcing to stay expressionless, thinking that his friends would probably follow him if they’d think something’s not right.
Potter takes in a deep breath and then nods at Keir, who sits on Draco’s left.
Another wave of gasps and shocked sounds fill the hall.
Two more to go, Harry thinks. Perhaps Smith will manage to question all of them before midnight.
Albus glances around the room, at the four-posters decorated with green silk hangings, and sees no sign of Zabini, but sees Scorpius, slumped on his bed, leaning his head against the headboard, while reading a book.
“Because she is in love with me.” Albus says simply.
It is not long until Albus’s mum arrives, giving him a tight hug and telling him he has nothing to worry about. Albus doesn’t know how much his parents have discussed what Albus told his father before breakfast – if anything – but Albus sure as hell is not going to say anything now.
The Marauder’s Map.
After his final word, the hall explodes with shocked sounds, with urgent discussions, with several, raised hands. And Harry nods at each of them in turn, answers each of the questions calmly and steadily, until the next one.
Why bring worry and trouble to others if nothing is certain yet?
“We know it’s someone from Hufflepuff, dad,” Albus adds, arching a brow at him.
After asking Scorpius to confirm his whole name and birthday, Quinn continues, “Tell me about the train ride. You arrived to King’s Cross with the Potters, yes?”
“Yes. That would be – Quinn, you can take the lead,” Potter says, his brows furrowed, sounding somewhat absentminded.
my son?”
Potter thinks kindly of his son, and he knows that Auror Quinn will report everything to his boss nevertheless, he gives Potter a curt nod. “No. Go ahead.”
“It was different.” Malfoy suddenly says, not looking at Harry. “When Astoria lived. Scorpius was different,” he says simply.
He realises Potter is waiting for him to answer. If Draco has visited the place after he had attended the school?
Rose leaves with Ron and Flitwick, towards the Ravenclaw tower, while Hermione stays close to the door, her gaze at Harry.
“Good evening,” McGonagall says to Harry, Moonstone, and the Aurors. She then turns to the man and woman. “This is Auror Potter, who will be leading the investigation,” McGonagall says, gesturing at Harry. “Auror Potter, meet Mr and Mrs Travers,” She continues, as they all stand up.
“Who was it?” Scorpius asks silently, a blank look in his grey eyes – a look that almost makes Harry take a step back, as the boy in front of him reminds him painfully much of his father.
Scorpius’s father looks at Albus’s mother. “Potter,” he says, his voice blank and face expressionless. He then turns to his son, his features softer. “Let’s go. I’ll take you to your common room.”
“Hermione…” Harry murmurs, feeling ashamed that she knows.
Keir and Quinn trudge behind him, murmuring quietly as they approach the school. Harry left Berrycloth, Fungbury and Ron to the station and Hogsmeade. His friend was not pleased, but understood that he could not really provide them help in taking statements at Hogwarts, as he was no longer officially an Auror – and Harry insisted that he would be most useful at the village, which he knows like the back of his hand. Harry still promised Ron to check up on his children. And his brothers’ children. Which Harry thinks will probably take at least an hour, since there are so many of them.
Draco hums thoughtfully as he inspects the girl more closely, waving his wand slowly over her frame, performing more diagnostic charms. “Yes, I know.” He doesn’t see Potter, since he has his back on him, but practically hears the way Potter rolls his eyes at him.
the two of them talking about in the train before Albus got there? “Why were you talking to her?” Albus asks, his curiosity piquing as his friend stiffens slightly.
Albus crosses his arms and looks away. When he doesn’t say anything, their father turns to James. “James?” He asks, his voice still filled with confusion.
The thoughts and the feeling fade away, and then, Harry is calm again, thanking Merlin that his own children are in one piece. He looks at Draco from the corner of his eye: the other man stands stiffly in place, his posture perfect, his face expressionless, but his eyes – his eyes watch the grieving parents who have lost a child, and something close to compassion flickers in them. Harry knows he must be thinking of his son.
Draco quickly checks the others; Keir still looks grumpy, Bones’s expression is as blank as it has been since she walked into the room, Smith looks like he has a permanent grimace on his face, and Berrycloth seems like he is somewhat worried.
Scott looks troubled. “Can I…could I speak with you for a moment?”
“Oh, I haven’t, trust me,” James says, a smug and knowing look in his expression, as if he’s realised something.
Harry sighs. “Obviously something happened during the train ride. We just need to hope that it is something we can handle,” He mutters sullenly. “Anything else?”
” Harry says, grimacing slightly at the name of Ginny’s boyfriend. Mark the Genealogist.
knows.
They watch the crowd on the other side of the hall in silence, as their boss nods rapidly at the Minister for Magic while two of his secretaries write down each word. There are likely putting up a statement for the press. They watch at Mr and Mrs Travers who discuss with the Headmistress in the corner, looking both detached from the people surrounding them and overcome by grief. They watch and acknowledge, as one by one, the Aurors come to say their goodbyes to Harry, before returning to their homes and the Ministry.
“You tell
Apparently, Travers left soon after the uncomfortable incident, and James and his friends stayed up until the early morning hours. He doesn’t mention the alcohol, and to Harry’s embarrassment and relief, Quinn doesn’t ask about it.
Rose nods. “I did. I picked up a book from my trunk, and went to bring it to her, to her compartment.”
Draco arches a brow at him. “All magic ought to feel different, if cast by different people.”
Quinn nods. “And as James is of age, you will need to have his agreement again to be present during his questioning.”
Potter nods, glancing behind him at the door, a calculating look in his eyes. “I wonder…” Potter mutters, and then stands up to wave his wand towards the door, to inspect the magic placed upon it.
Quinn puts his notes down. “Rose will be questioned again tomorrow under Veritaserum, as she is quite possibly the last one to see Travers alive.”
Scorpius clears his throat and pulls a book from the shelf on the nightstand and straightens up, facing Albus. “Nothing. She was just –” He shrugs, “– saying something rubbish about you, I suppose.” Scorpius mutters and nudges Albus’s foot with his. “Now stop conquering my bed. You have your own,” He grunts and Albus slowly stands up to let Scorpius lie on it.
Draco clicks his tongue. “
Albus shakes his head, his back still at Scorpius.
Harry and Quinn are having a quick bite to eat in the classroom they’ve been using for questioning the students, and simultaneously going through the results of the morning’s interrogations.
Auror Quinn grimaces. “It appears, there was also an argument on the train – “
“Good morning, Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter,” Fox says steadily, his sharp gaze moving between them. “I believe we have the same direction?” Albus and Scorpius stare at him blankly. “To see the Headmistress?” Fox adds.
His contemplative eyes move across the girl, the pool of blood on the floor, stopping on the edge of the bench, and then flickering to the blood-stained book. He hums thoughtfully and steps closer to the girl, watching curiously at the girl’s posture and the way she seems to be squeezing her wand in her hand.
Riley stands up shakily, looking rather overwhelmed.
He gives Gryffindor to Bones, Slytherin to Smith, Ravenclaw to Keir and then heads towards the kitchens and the Hufflepuff common room with Quinn and Higgins.
on purpose
Harry nods, “Then I will inform Quinn that he should proceed with questioning our sons tomorrow,” he says unenthusiastically, and stands up. Malfoy follows his example. “Um. I’ll talk to you later…back in the village,” Harry mutters, feeling quite uneasy, and out of his skin.
Albus nods, lazily. “Scorpius calls me Al. Not…not Potter.”
Zachary gives his friends an indifferent shrug. “I could hardly miss it,” he says airily, his eyes glinting slyly, “…not with Thomas holding it so preciously up…”
Potter clears his throat, looking quite embarrassed, as he stares hard at the plush, green rug. His mouth moves twice, but no words are coming out.
“Oi! James!” Albus yells from the hallway at the bottom of the stairs, keeping his fury in check.
Potter puts both Berrycloth and Fungbury to night watch, to patrol the streets as there are several concerned parents staying in the village along with the regular population, making the air around them somewhat tense.
All air leaves from Harry’s lungs.
Scorpius sighs. “Don’t leave, Al,” He says quietly.
Quinn gives Potter a helpless look. “It didn’t involve
When Draco doesn’t say anything, Potter lifts his brows, “Malfoy? Want me to pass on a message to Scorpius?”
Albus sighs, and finally looks at his friend. Scorpius is watching him with both beseeching and desperate look in his eyes. He looks so pale, so… vulnerable, that Albus nearly flinches. He can’t even remember if he has seen his best friend like this before.
“So, the wards were not breached by outsiders,” Potter says expressionlessly. “Neither the driver nor the trolley lady saw anything out of ordinary.”
“ – What are we doing?” Draco asks, his voice hoarse, panting, gritting his teeth against the waves of sharp pleasure as Potter’s hand against his cock jolts slightly.
Quinn then glances at Draco, and
“I ask for prefects from each house, as well as the Head Boy and Girl to step forward for further instructions,” McGonagall states, and then turns briefly towards the other professors, to exchange words with them.
Draco is mildly surprised by Potter’s behaviour, since he himself is bursting with the need to insult the specky git. But apparently, they are adults now, and capable of focusing on other things as well. “The blood on the book and bench are hers, in addition to what is spilled on the floor. No traces of dark magic,” he says, before turning back to continue the inspection, crouching closer to the girl.
“Naturally,” Harry says. Merlin, he hopes it will not go to that – Veritaserum or Legilimency, that is. “Is there anyone else besides the Prefects and Head Boy and Girl, we should talk with? Anyone, who was in close relations with Miss Travers?”
uncomfortable. He thinks he could have handled this better…
Both Scorpius and Albus watch carefully Harry’s every move. Harry cannot confirm it, he knows, since the information cannot be passed on from the Head Auror to his son and friends – it needs to come from the Headmistress, or from the Heads of House.
Draco wonders what Potter had wanted to ask. What exactly does he want
Harry sees the narrow-eyed look Malfoy gives to Quinn.
Harry arches a brow at him. “Oh? How have I changed? And can I use your fireplace to floocall Hermione?”
my best friend, because of you!” He yells, feeling nothing but frustration and rage towards the witch.
They both stop and stare at each other expectantly.
“I felt bad, because I heard what had happened at the party, how – how cruel James had been,” she says, and Harry wants to purse his lips, since, yes James had been
?” Scorpius asks threateningly, and Albus hears a sharp intake of breath.
, they step into McGonagall’s office.
Malfoy lifts a brow at him, and then sighs, cleaning his skin with a conjured napkin. “I could use the Quick Quotes, but I quite hate it when it mixes up my words and makes me sound like an infant,” He grunts, and then cleans his fingers with a wordless spell.
Julian chuckles, “I mean, you should’ve seen him! Zach hit Thomas straight in the nose!”
Bones’s brows furrow slightly. “Mr Longbottom was not sure about the specifics,” she says, glancing at her notes. “According to him, they were seeing each other during the previous September, but hadn’t been spending time together moving towards the end of the year.”
“McGonagall floocalled me and the Minister only moments ago – I came straight to you,” Hermione says, her voice shaking. She starts to pace in the middle of Harry’s office. “I need you to go there, now,” She adds hurriedly, and even if she hadn’t been giving him the order as Harry’s boss – the Head of the DMLE – Harry would’ve gone there with or without approval.
Draco finds himself staring at Potter, who stands there, on the top of the stairs, looking windswept, his cheeks red from what Draco assumes is the cold air outside.
“Would you like me to give you a few?” Draco drawls with a pointed look.
Harry lets out a sigh, leaning back on his chair. “After Albus?”
Lily stifles a laugh next to Harry, who gives his daughter an inquisitive look. “Something to add?” He asks from her, but Lily merely shrugs back, walking away from Rose and Ron, leading Harry towards the Quidditch pitch.
“I dunno…” He mutters, slumping into a chair in front of Moonstone’s desk, feeling like a seventh-year student again.
With a little shake of his head, he suppresses a grin before accompanying Hermione and the Minister for Magic.
and not quite so much anymore.
Harry’s thoughts move to Albus; there’s so much…resentment in the boy, that Harry is only starting to realise it. And he thinks that a lot of it is directed at, not Harry himself, but, to
” Albus says forcefully, covering his face with his hands. “Leave me alone.”
to do? He clenches his jaw and forces the question out, right as Potter opens the door to his room.
Harry shrugs. “It was all right. But it’s good to be back here,” he says, and then grimaces at the stack of parchments scattered over his table. “Not to this, though. I was away for one week, and actually had problems locating my desk today from under all this.”
“I know.” Scorpius says faintly, staring hard at the bathroom door, his expression closed.
He is breathless with fury when he finally barges into his dorm room.
Harry’s insides jump slightly. “Do you want it to happen again?” He asks, somewhat surprised by his boldness, as well as his voice, which sounds lower than it had been.
Their group is completed when Zachary sits down on Cory’s other side. They quickly start exchanging their holiday stories, and Albus tells the others about their Christmas.
“How’s the family? How’s Ginny?” Moonstone mutters from his desk, where he is rifling through a stack of parchments.
Moonstone gives Harry a wry smile. “The Law Enforcement.”
And Draco thinks it is all very dull, until Bones pauses and gives Potter a calculative look. “One of them, Mr Longbottom –” and Draco barely suppresses a flinch;
Harry shakes his head to her, before inclining his jaw at Quinn, perfectly aware of the scowl he receives from Ginny in return.
Moonstone gives both Riley and Harry a scrutinising look.
this?!”
Harry continues through the door and slams it closed with more force than necessary after hearing a silent snort behind him. He
“Why?” Albus asks, his voice quiet.
A while later, the questioning has ended, and after fifteen minutes of excruciating silence, after Quinn has confirmed that the potion has worn off from Albus; Quinn, Smith and Slughorn make their excuses, leaving Harry and Ginny in the room with Albus, all three of them in uncomfortable shock.
“Scorpius told us that Travers had been threatening him without reason and had claimed she was going to tell their classmates that Scorpius and Albus were romantically involved,” Quinn says, his cheeks tinging slightly with red, and Draco wants to roll his eyes at the prude Auror.
Scorpius didn’t know the actual reason why Albus was avoiding him, no… because – how could Albus tell him, that after he’d hexed his brother for snogging Scorpius, Albus had realised that he himself wanted to do the exact same thing?
“Kissing. Touching each other. Intimately.”
He sighs, drinks the last of his tea before standing up and exiting the chamber, and goes to retrieve his belongings from his room upstairs before their departure to the school.
it. But still, he cannot stop wondering. He cannot stop worrying over him.
Naturally he’d thought about the scar-headed man before the pub, but had always dismissed those thoughts almost immediately. Draco doesn’t usually waste his thoughts on unavailable people, except, apparently when he has lowered his guard due to an excessive amount of alcohol.
But we need more information. We need to show that Rose is innocent, as well as find out if she has seen anything that could help us solve the case,” Harry says promptly. “You know this, Hermione,” he adds softly.
His father looks stunned again, and then demands that Albus explains everything that occurred during the train ride. Albus does, although he decides to leave out how weirdly Scorpius has acted since, as it might not have anything to do with what happened to Travers, even though the small voice inside Albus’s head kind of tells him otherwise.
Scott blinks, her lip trembling. “I thought you…”
Draco takes a step back, giving Potter the most dubious look he can summon, “No. I don’t want you to – to
Quinn nods slowly. “Did you go straight to your own compartment after leaving Miss Travers’s?” He asks.
Harry can’t stop wondering what is going on in James’s head, and why would his son risk everything he has worked for; a promising career in one of the Quidditch teams in the British league, as well as his future with Charlotte. He doesn’t blame James, for making a mistake – Merlin knows Harry has made them himself, even throughout his adulthood. He can only hope that James will not make decisions he’ll regret later in his life.
Albus shakes his head firmly. “No.”
Draco suppresses a much needed eyeroll. He lets out a slightly wavering breath, slips his hands off from Potter’s hair, lowering them, and takes a hold of Potter’s wrist, before pulling Potter’s hand out of his trousers, irritated at himself because of the feel of loss. They disentangle, and look away from each other.
There’re footsteps coming closer to them, and both Albus and James turn around to glance behind them.
But then, as Albus sees the people outside the classroom they are heading to, he realises the answer to his question at once.
Weasley – and Draco sure as hell is not going to start addressing her as ‘Potter’ within his own mind since wouldn’t that be confusing? – shoves Potter hard. Draco has to give it to her: she seems strong, and fiery. But Potter does have more muscle in him than he did in his school years – not that Draco has been looking
Potter looks away, his brows twitching. “Sure.” He says and then nods his head at the door in the middle, on the right side of the hallway. “It’s that one,” he continues, and then gives Draco a strained smile before moving past him, towards the end of the hallway.
me?” he asks, his voice filled with incredulity.
McGonagall seems satisfied. “That will do. The students are still in the Great Hall. Is it safe for us to move them into their common rooms with their Heads of Houses?”
He walks into the Great Hall and sees Scorpius sitting at their table with Julian and Zachary, keeping his eyes at his plate while their other two friends seem to be in the middle of a discussion opposite to him.
“Whatever happens between Ginny and me, we are both still going to be in your life, like we always have. And in Albus’s and James’s,” Harry murmurs, hugging Lily tighter against him. “Even though your mother and I will not be married nor live together, that doesn’t mean that we don’t care for each other.”
“Hermione, calm down,” Harry says with a hard tone, giving Hermione a squeeze on her shoulder and glancing at Ron and Rose. His friend gives him a strained smile, and an inconspicuous nod. Harry focuses on Hermione again. “I know it doesn’t make any sense right now,” Harry says very quietly, “You know that I wouldn’t suspect any of our children, because
James scoffs. “Can’t believe you just said that…Well, fuck you, Scorpius.” James grunts, and Albus can hear him walking in the room, towards the door. “I need to go…I need to find – find Charlotte…”
A shuddering breath leaves his lungs.
opened up to a girl he had been dating at that time.
Scott sniffs and swallows deeply, looking at the floor. “I’m – Merlin, I’m such a fool…”
Albus looks away, his lips pressing into a rigid line.
As soon as the door closes behind them, Scorpius falters in his steps, and Albus realises the reason for it a second later, when he sees Scorpius’s father, Mr Malfoy sitting in front of the Headmistress’s table – along with – “James? Dad?” Albus asks, and then frowns, “Rose? Uncle?”
Harry groans, stretching his back as soon as Quinn leaves Moonstone’s office, accompanied by Mr Woods. They have ten minutes before he ought to come back with Mr Riley. The boyfriend.
Albus’s brows shoot up high on his forehead. Since when has James called him ‘
