Innes scowled at him but after a few tense moments he turned and stomped back to the bar for more to drink, pocketing his wand with one last glare at Draco as he went.
started to show them her parchment, which was full of lists of things such as flowers, music, and a prospective guest-list.
They have another drink each, the silences falling a little less awkward whenever the conversation stops flowing.
“Ouch,” he croaked out loud, even as he tried to move his fingers, to locate his wand, to take stock of where he was. The room he was in was unfamiliar, grey slate stone with heavy blue drapes blocking out the morning’s weak sunlight.
“Has anyone given him trouble?” Harry didn’t know why it was important to him to know that Draco was happy enough, and was being treated fairly – perhaps his guilt and embarrassment over Innes’s slander earlier had stung him more than he’d realised.
“No, Isla, I can’t. I have to get to the practice, remember?” Still not meeting Harry’s eyes, he turned to the woman who had come to the door to help pull her daughter off him.
and hadn't stopped him and saved us? The bullshit I used to spout, the disgusting beliefs I was raised to think were normal... the conversations I had, the things I did or turned a blind eye to... when it’s all you ever knew, it takes a long time to completely break away, even though you know it’s wrong.”
“Will they find him?” Rhona whispered, her eyes darting about the four corners of the garden, as if expecting to see Yaxley manifest next to Draco’s compost heap.
Harry pressed his lips together, but resolved not to interject again. He was reasonably certain that Oliver Wood, whom Harry had bumped into the previous weekend in Diagon Alley, was the reason Marcus Flint had been in a good mood and in such great form lately. But loyalty to his old Captain’s privacy kept Harry’s mouth shut. Not that Flint had tried very hard to be discreet; his hand had certainly found its way into Wood’s back pocket when he’d joined them in the street easily enough.
“No,” Potter said calmly, shooting him a long look. “Not at all. I was just remembering how smart you were, how well you did at Hogwarts, in Potions and stuff. It seems like a great thing to do, being a Healer, but difficult. Hard work.”
“Don’t tell me that’s it,” Draco couldn’t help but tease, when Harry sank down onto his chest all sweaty and spent, panting for breath. “Don’t tell me that’s all that the cock I’ve been fantasizing about for almost a decade can give me...”
“Well, then,” Innes agreed, as he led the way down to the beach and prepared to apparate towards the nearest of the tiny islands.
“You won’t like visiting us in Adharmuir, then,” Harry pointed out, before he laughed when Narcissa made a disgusted noise.
that had happened, the old man had refused to say, and still did to this day. Draco, a specialist of creature-induced injuries, had been called out to this windswept little island and simply never left.
fault the fireplace had heard five instead of nine, but Innes used the delay to beat him to the bar and order two glasses of scotch, leaving Harry to collect his luggage.
As luck would have it, just as he left the cottage, Potter came dawdling out of Jock Fraser’s front gate, with a half-eaten crumpet in one hand, staring down at a piece of parchment and not looking where he was going.
Her mouth fell open, and someone else in the room audibly gasped. They were all staring again. Realizing there was now nothing else for it, Harry cleared his throat. Bloody Innes.
“It was him or you,” Draco whispered, his face ice-white. “I couldn’t let it be you. And Innes agreed.”
Draco slowly let go of the door and it closed quietly behind him. His grey eyes were fixed warily on Innes, but they flicked briefly to Harry and widened even further in surprise. Innes stepped forward, and Draco reached into the folds of his sage green robes to withdraw his own wand, his movements slow and precise.
His mother was in the kitchen, writing something on a scroll of parchment by candlelight. She stood to give Draco his unfinished meal, and serve a portion for Harry, kept warm with a charm in the oven.
Draco let himself into his warm cottage and headed straight to the fridge for the bottle of Sauvignon Blanc that his mother had sent from her home near Sancerre just a few days ago.
like to know is who reported the sighting of Yaxley. It must have been someone in this community, but they did so under anonymity. Please, make yourself known to us if you’re in this room – we have questions that still need answers, if we’re to move fast. I’m staying upstairs, in room 4, should anyone want to speak to me.”
“Remember, apply immediately as necessary and leave it on for ten minutes, then wipe off the residue with a cold, damp cloth.”
Draco headed upstairs to the room he’d converted into a laboratory and checked on the cauldron in which he was reducing a potion into a burn-healing paste. That would do for Mrs. Stewart, a single mother of four, whose two-year-old boy Magnus had developed a habit of sneezing flames as he came into his magic. It would pass, but for now the paste would be ready tomorrow – Draco would take it over to her before he opened the clinic. Her children were sweet kids, polite and funny, but a handful. Her prick of an ex-husband had run off with a Muggle hairdresser from Mull a year back, so Draco tried to make life easier for her whenever he could.
The wind off the sea had chilled his skin, and he felt raw, shaken and shivery, even as the heat from his home seeped through his robes.
“They’ll marry next autumn,” Potter carried, his smile so soft and happy that Draco couldn't quite bring himself to sneer or be nasty.
Draco’s face fell, but Harry had known all along, since the second he woke up, that if Innes wasn’t with him it was because he’d gone for Yaxley. He was already shoving back the thick blanket to get up.
Potter was smiling at him, something almost mischievous to the quirk of his lips that made Draco’s pulse quicken. There was a disturbingly large part of Draco that was tempted –
“Don’t worry, Malfoy,” Harry drawled from above him, as three fingers slide into where his cock had just been. “You think I don’t more in store for you? You’re not the only one who’s been waiting on this for ten years...”
“Now that we don’t know who saw him, or when, or where, we’ll have to do a full tracking sweep of the whole island.” Potter rubbed at his forehead, over his scar. “Means you’re stuck with me a bit longer.”
Draco froze as Harry was admitted in a flurry of wind and ruffled hair, his smile a little sheepish.
“Toe-rags,” the woman grumbled. She tightened her grip on her smallest child, before properly returning her attention to Harry.
“What happened?” He went straight into Healer mode, dropping down next to Potter and checking his airway before he cast the charm to keep his breathing even. Potter’s robes were red-stained with blood, a gash on his side the source.
Thinking back on it, after another long sip, Draco didn’t know which of the two of them had been more shocked to see the other. What disquieted Draco even more had been the split second of – what had it been... Merlin, surely not pleasure? – that had shot through him, when he had clapped eyes on Potter.
Whatever Potter had done that day in the chamber had worked. Draco and his mother had been released the next morning, though his father would have to wait longer for his freedom. They’d fled the country immediately to the safety of their family in France. Draco had trained as a Healer in Paris for four years and had resolved to never set foot on British soil again.
"Present," She smiled kindly at him. Merry shook with silent laughter and kept her hand over her mouth so she didn't laugh out loud. Snape sneered at her but continued on with attendance. He started to talk about his rules for class which was just him saying to not be an idiot.
"No," She mumbled. She ran into the room to avoid them but Dudley grabbed her by the hair. She yelped in pain and stumbled back with Dudley's hand still in her long hair. Piers groped her flat chest and snorted when he couldn't grab anything. She whimpered when he dug his nails into her chest.
"Now put your hand over the broom and say 'up!'" She shouted. The group was a choir of 'up's and maybe a few swear words. Harriet watched everyone before she even looked at her broom, no one had got the broom in their hand yet.
"You know Potter," Harriet whipped her head towards Malfoy who also jumped at her sudden movement, "It's bad to show you others that you were fake crying. It would have been better to have them underestimate you and think that you are weak."
"Potter, Harriet," Called out Professor McGonagall. The whole hall burst out in whispers. The Headmaster sat up as if he couldn't wait to see what house she got in either. Harry took a calming breath and moved her way through the students in front of her. They gasped and gave her room quickly. She felt sick to her stomach when she sat down on the stool facing the whole school. She stared at her clasped hands in her lap until the hat was set onto her head. He covered her eyes completely. He said nothing and when he started to talk she jumped a little bit.
"Well, maybe I should just talk to him before we meet up so he doesn't think that I hate him," Harriet shifted and popped a normal muggle jellybean in her mouth. She made a face, she forgot she hated jellybeans.
"Look Albus," he relaxed a bit which made Albus become hard and stiff, Slytherins don't show anger so they are known to relax before striking and poisoning their prey. "I'm a reasonable man, but I do believe what you are doing is quite illegal."
this took way longer to write, wayyyy longer but anyways there will probably be 3-4 more chapters to the first year which will be quite long and hefty <3 <3
"Harriet stop!" Merry sat next to her and patted her hair. Harriet flinched at her hand coming near her but tilted her head so Merry could pet her. Merry doesn't know why Harriet flinches so much, she still gets a bit stiff when Merry hugs her. Merry never questions the topic of her home life, she fears the answer she may get. "They will love you, I promise! They aren't bad people, I know they are seen as bad because of their political power but they are nice people."
"Come on!" Pansy shouted at the two. The two girls raced to the combined group of Ravenclaws and Slytherins.
"Good job though Harry," Marcus ruffed her hair and yanked her into his side when she was about to fall from his force. She giggled loudly and slapped his arm playfully. Daisy picked up Harriet in a big hug and kissed her cheek lightly.
"Of course, I will take extra, extra, extra care of her," Ms. Figgs promised. Harriet handed over Minerva to Ms. Figgs.
"Hello Harriet, I'm Narcissa and this is my husband, Lucius," She turned to her quiet husband who was observing the small girl in front of him.  Draco's mother stepped forward a bit and seemed to bend down a bit, more to Harriet's level. Narcissa held out her hand for Harriet to shake, Harriet gently shook her hand while hiding a bit behind her blanket. Narcissa smiles very kindly which surprised Draco, neither of his parents aren't that kind to strangers right away.
"He is a very beautiful bird," She cooed and petted the bird when it flicked its head towards her. It cooed and seemed to like being pet.
"Hello sir, I'm Harriet Potter," She shyly offered her hand. He smiled kindly and shook her small hand.
"These several years are going to be very interesting with you, aren't they?" She laughed. Harry just laughed back.
"I really don't know!" Harriet cried out, tears rolled down her face. She was a freak even here, the Dursley's were right, she was a true freak.
"What's wrong?" He walked up to her with a soft voice. He rested a hand on her shoulder, Harriet made a wounded noise. "What happened?" He asked a bit louder, wanting to know why she was crying.
"I'm just saying why would muggles believe in a fat guy who creeps into people's houses?" He stated.
Harriet was sitting up in bed just listening to the wind outside, the snow was falling heavily. There was a thud outside, Harriet also jumped out of her skin. She was very close to waking up Draco right next to her in fear. She saw the reflection of shoes stop at Draco's door, her heart seemed to stop all of a sudden. She held her breath and tried to hid under the covers but still watching the outline of feet. The feet soon left and Harriet's heart was still frozen as well as her face. She heard Riley's voice right after the feet left and she let out a held breath. Riley's voice seemed to calm her, it must have been Severus checking to make sure they were asleep and not being loud. She put her hand on her chest to calm down her heart rate, she cuddled into Draco's warm figure to try and calm herself down more. He shifted more closer to her also, still asleep, mostly wanting more warm contact.
"Do you have their schedules ready now?" The third more silent and scary girl asked blankly to Snape. He scowled at Harry even though she did absolutely nothing. He went back into the door and quickly grabbed their two schedules. He shoved the parchment papers towards them and turned to leave with Riley following.
"Professor," Is all Harriet said while staring at the cat who seemed a little annoyed that not a lot of students are in the class. Harriet frowned, she has seen this cat before. She gasped when she remembered.
"Because my family is dark." He sighed, he already knew why. He must deal with people not trusting him a lot due to his parents.
"What do you guys want to do before dinner starts?" Merry asked the large group of first year Slytherins while looking at her phone. She saw Harriet jump and get excited but say nothing.
"But nothing," The house elf flinched in fear at the elder wizards tone, "Since her guardians said no such thing, she has the ability to spend the Holidays who she chooses best. Good day." His robes swished as he left and his cane clicked satisfiedly, the house elf was whimpering in fear of being hit. Dumbledore stared at nothing in particular for a while after the dark wizard left. Potter let someone else do the arguing, maybe she wasn't as cunning as he thought?
"I like it down here, I like this coldness," He hissed softly and nuzzled her neck. Harry almost tripped on nothing which made Merry snicker and hold onto her arm. They came up to a weird looking door. They took so many turns and twists down here that Harry knew she wouldn't get out tomorrow without getting lost. The door was almost invisible because it matched the walls but it was more black. The blackness of the door blended in with the shadows near the door. Harry knew she was going to forget where the door was.
"As do I, and most other Purebloods," Merry sighed, "There is a lot of interbreeding between Purebloods to try and keep the purity of magic."
"Was it what Ron said?" Merry pushed the hair out of her eyes comfortingly. Hermione nodded and some more tears escaped. Merry hugged her tightly and whispered comforting words.
"Mom asked Mr. Feose if he could join us on Christmas," Merry slipped in as she grabbed some last minute things.
"Come on, we have to get to the Great Hall so you can eat," Merry laughed, wiping away some of her own tears.
"It takes a lot of knowledge, patience, and magic ability to create a new element like metal by only using one of the 4 elements in this case fire." Harry nodded understandingly. The professor looked like she wanted to say more but didn't. Harriet soon calmed down after everyone got back to their own needles.
"What does that mean?" Harriet had forgotten her book and was more interesting in learning more in-depth about the pureblood culture, whenever she read it on her own, she was always confused.
"Come here, you little witch!" Screamed Piers. Everyone in this town basically knows she is a bit odd but only Dudley's closest 'friends' know truly about her. One kid dashed to the side so she had nowhere to run. She ran up to the side of the house and stared at the wall, ready to accept her fate.
"No Cedric we didn't!" Merry answered sarcastically. There was a scream from the bathroom, shit. Harriet ran into the bathroom.
"Yeah, it's on my trunk. The blue box," She pointed to her trunk at the end of her bed. He walked to it and examined the bottles. He nodded in thought again and closed it softly.
'Wait no, he could get in a lot of trouble with the Ministry if they find out and they will,' She said in her mind. She wouldn't ever want anything bad to happen to Mr. Feose.
"I don't know, some boys are weird and gross but others are really nice and smart," Harriet really never thought about it before.
Sorry for the basically 4 month disappearance, a lot of horrid things happened in life and I was not motivated at all to do anything for a really long time, especially to write for this because I was so overwhelmed by this story. This took a long time to write and I wanted to focus on where this story can go and I realized I set it up so wrong, it wasn't how I wanted it, it's all fixed now and I have a really good idea on how first year and second year will go and I believe it's quite good. So hopefully you guys will enjoy how I'm going to progress this fanfic and its overall content :)
"Even though a house elf could blow you over," Merry laughed. Harry's lips twitched in annoyance. She always had a hard time when people commented on her, mostly her body. They say, knobbled knees, short, wild tamed hair, freakish scar, too pretty to be smart, flat chested, too boyish. She dealt with the Dursley's picking out every single thing wrong about her to the point where she is very insecure when anyone says remotely anything about her. She knows to not care about what anyone says about her but when they say it directly to her face, it hurts. Harry knows Merry didn't mean it in a bad way but it just hit a sore spot with her.
~A snake!~ Hissed Autumn ready to pounce. Millicent pet Autumn to calm her. Willow was too busy biting her dragon to notice the snake.
Her Aunt grabbed her by the collar of her shirt which was also Dudley's, "That's it!" She shouted loudly into her face. She dragged the small girl downstairs who had a hard time walking down the stairs when being dragged roughly. She walked around and headed towards the entrance of the house which made Harriet start to cry a bit, she didn't want to go outside. She hadn't eaten any breakfast and she was going outside already. Why wasn't she going to eat a big breakfast like Dudley?
"Would you like to see your bank information?" The goblin pulls out another piece of parchment. He showed the parchment to her after she nodded.
"I really don't care about looks as long as they are nice to me and others. And I guess not smart really... but mature I guess. Like they don't do or say anything stupid. Book smart is different from street smart. Like you," Flint looked at her quickly, "You once said that you have a hard time in class but I can already see that you know a lot the real world and you know when to say something and when you shouldn't."
"Tired from working two shifts but better now cause I saw you," He taps her nose while she blushes. He is a very attractive man, 19 years old, even Harry can see that.
"No but Harry could probably use a spell to find him," Merry offered. Neville looked at Harry who smiled at him and squeaked while blushing bright red. He refused to look at her again and only looked at the ground.
"Well people seem to find Cedric Diggory to be good looking," She shrugged, he was alright. She didn't seem to think boys were all that important.
"I'm alright, I slept quite well. Thank you again for letting me stay here." Narcissa smiled again at Harriet's soft voice and quiet demeanor.
"Yes ma'am," She said while pouting. Aunt Petunia just scoffed at her and shooed her away. Harry thanked her and went out the front door. She looked around the neighborhood and saw that Ms. Figg was not home. She knew that Ms. Figg was a squib, she had a floo in her living room. Harry smirked as she walked over to her house. She walked around to the back and found the back door not locked. This neighborhood was very safe to the point where most people didn't even lock their front door. Harry walked into her house while stepping over some cats at the door. The cats didn't even seem like they cared she came in as she shut the door. She walked slowly to the floo and opened its gates with shaking hands. She turned around to see no cats have moved at all.
"Hello!" Yelled an old man as he jumped up from behind the counter. Merry screamed and jumped back while Harry just stared at the man's wild hair. Harry was told about Mr. Ollivander and his ways.
"Here you go," Harry giggled and offered the toad to Neville. He blushed and took his toad slowly. He made a wounded noise when their hands accidentally touched.
"Will be 2 minutes," He informed and sat across from her. They talked about some potions until a knock came from the fireplace. Harry jumped up to open the gates.
"Dudley and Piers," Was all she said. He slid a bowl filled with cookies over to her and left. She almost finished a whole cookie before he returned with a vial.
"Well I better get going," She sighed and picked up Beetlejuice who slid under her blouse. They had 10 minutes to get on the train.
Draco sighed and took a bite out of a chocolate frog, "Fine." He ate the rest of the chocolate frog and he jumped up excitedly, "It's time to get ready!" Merry grabbed Harriet and dragged her to the bathroom attached to Draco's room. Merry put some concealer on Harriet and darkened up her lashline. Merry put on a more natural look with light foundation and light brown eyeshadow. She also put on pink blush and bronzer. Harriet put on her own mascara with little problems. Harriet put her glasses back on again and didn't even bother with her hair, she quite likes her hair messy.
Merry didn't want any awkward discussion to come from Harriet's treatment of Dobby, so she came up with a distraction, "Harriet is the starting seeker for Slytherin even as a first year." Dobby scurries off in fear, Harriet promises to herself that she will attempt to be friends with Dobby.
Hopefully, you enjoyed this filler chapter about the rest of her classes, next chapter will be about flying and midnight mischievous. This chapter was supposed to come out earlier so the whole troll in the bathroom would be out on Halloween but for some reason, random events came up that I had to go to so sorry that it won't be on the exact day
"Blaise probably has been having his ear being talked off for the last 10 minutes," Pansy laughed. The other girls laughed in agreement. Malfoy really seemed to be the talker in the group. As the girls started to get closer to the open field, Merry tugged on the back of her robes to make them both stop.
She heard deep chuckling from above her, "Sorry about that. Achilles likes to cuddle." She looked up to see Marcus, she blushed when she made eye contact with his dark brown eyes.
"Eek!" She squeaked and jumped in her chair at the loud noise. After the smoke cleared, Seamus's face was covered in ashes and his feather was also ashes.
"I expect my students to come to class on time," She pressed her lips together in a line, reminding Harry of her Aunt.
"Oh, alright," Harry huffed. They walked into the classroom to see most of the Slytherin's already in the room but only two Gryffindors, Hermione and Neville. While Merry sat down and pulled out her phone to text who knows, Harry waved at Neville shyly who waved back blushing deeply.
"Right after Snape lectured us about how we would hate the consequences of sneaking out," Merry sat up, mouth opened.
"Who's a good little pud-pud?" Harriet giggled. The cat licked her hand happily and licked the milk off of her whiskers. Harriet stood up while holding the cat very awkwardly and walked over to Ms. Figgs house. She almost tripped over her large, baggy pants and the cat almost slipped out of her small hands that were covered by her large flannel sleeves. She stumbled over to her house and knocked on the door with the cat slipping out of her grip.
"It will be just fine," Merry assured her. The train started to slow down and squeak to a stop. Kids rushed out of their compartments excitedly. Harry got up and straightened her uniform, she has never been this nervous before in her entire life probably because this was the start of a new life for her.
"Just letting you know," Merry leaned in towards her, "I'm definitely borrowing these later." Harriet laughed and shook her head.
"Hogwarts Express!" She screamed. The wind and green fire whipped around them as ash twirled around their feet.
"Of course darling, I will take care of her for now but I will need to give her back to her original owner," She tried not to laugh at Minerva glaring at her.
"They will be fine Cara," Mr. Feose patted her back. Both kids waved at them for the last time and disappeared into the train. They talked about their summers as they went to find an empty compartment. They bumped into some older kids, Harry collided her head into one of their lower chests.
"Should we eat again? I'm hungry," Cara said. They ate at a diner which Cara had a salad, Merry had some pancakes, and Harry had a cheese burger and some fries. Harry and Merry giggled watching Merry's kitten named Willow as she gnawed on some fries. They talked about dragons riders.
"I still wanna be with you, you are nice to me," She nudged her nose into his neck as he calmed her.
She will walk the earth, have knowledge beyond a god, have talent beyond even the meaning, and magic beyond magic itself.
Before he could ask if she was alright, she said, "You owe me one, I don't quite like getting random goop all over me." Harriet glared at Ron and Seamus snickering at her word chose.
"But it's not their fault," Harriet frowned. The three older girls just shrugged in lost of answers.
"Wait, but Merry is a pureblood? What about Vincent or Gregory, aren't they also purebloods? Or Blaise?" Harriet frowned, this was super confusing.
"Harriet, you are the best of our year, you are definitely smarter than me," Harriet chuckled a bit at that, "Why do you think you're weird?"
"Thank you Mr. Dobby sir," She thanks him gently. Dobby's huge eyes start to water and his ears fold in a bit, she starts to apologize in fear she never meant to upset him.
Harriet shifted awkwardly and looked down at her feet, "I was wondering where Draco and Merry were, I was looking for them. Sorry for bothering you." Her face was warmed from embarrassment.
Harriet woke up to the sun shining into her room, she stretched and was confused when her hands and feet didn't hit the walls of her cupboard. She opened her eyes timidly, she was alone in a large room. She sat up and looked around, oh it's a Draco's room. She wondered why she woke up, it seemed so early. She flicked her wand and the time glowed in the air, it was 7:12 am. Even though she is used to waking up early but she is getting better about sleeping in a bit so she doesn't wake up the other girls. No one was in the room with her but she was sleeping in his bed, the three of them must have crashed after their little quidditch match. She caught the snitch first before Draco or Merry even saw it. But for an odd reason, her scar has been burning lately, more than usual. She really wants to tell someone like Merry or Riley about the pain but she doesn't want to be selfish nor a bother.
"Harriet, what do you seem to have here?" Her voice shook with laughter seeing Minerva in this position.
Her Aunt forcefully opened up the small cupboard under the stairs, Harriet looked at it confused. Was she supposed to clean it? It was quite dirty and full of dust, there were cobwebs everywhere. Her Aunt threw her in the small cupboard casually and carelessly like she was only a simple coat, her head hit the wall and she whimpered at the sudden pain. She sat on the floor and looked up at her Aunt while she was crying.
"Have you already made notes for this class?" Merry said like she was slightly scared to know the answer.
"You what!?" He shouted back while motioning her out of the floo. He made her tell him everything. After she finished, he just sighed and shook his head.
"But you were so excited for the candy-," Harriet gasped loudly, "We missed confusing people with our costumes!" The group was planning on wearing different house uniforms to confuse students and professors.
She burst through the door and walked up to her Aunt who was cleaning dishes, "Auntie! I drew a picture!" Her Aunt looked at her blankly and when she saw the picture of a small brunette with three other people. Each being labeled by their nicknames. Petunia said nothing but took the picture. Harriet's heart was going at a fast rate, she hoped she liked it. Petunia walked carefully over to the trash can and tore up the picture with no words, Harriet gasped and held back tears. She hated her picture, she promised herself that she would do better next time to make her Aunt happy.
Today was almost 11 years after her parents died, October 31st. She was only 5 months old when they died. She remembers the event like it happened 10 minutes ago. She remembers her parents' last words and their screams. She remembers his face and his words to her before he cast the killing spell on her. Harriet kissed Beetlejuice on the head and let him wrap around her arm. She threw the covers off of her and went to the bathroom. She threw off her wet shirt and underwear and hopped into a cold shower. Beetlejuice slithered on the wet floor excitedly, he loved shallow water. The cold shower washed away her sweat and woke her up, made her feel like she could start new again. She spent a long time in the shower before she got out and contemplated going to classes. She whispered a spell so the time would appear, 6:32 am. Breakfast opens at 7 am on weekdays even though classes didn't start till 9 am and 7:30 am on weekends. She really didn't feel like going. She sighed heavily and looked at herself in the mirror. She looked terrible, bags under her eyes with red eyes. She sniffed and rubbed her nose, she didn't even know how to explain how she was feeling, she felt like nothing. Harriet sighed and let Beetlejuice curl around her arm and lick her face. Harriet sighed again for what seemed to be the 10th time, she laid back in bed and closed her eyes which were burning with tiredness. She dozed off and on curled up into a ball with Beetlejuice curled around her arm still.
Harry was going to say something to him but Snape sneered at her again, "Why do you have a potion book? More importantly a seventh-year potion book?"
"Come on now, you need a whole new wardrobe for both wizarding and muggle right?" Merry took her arm and lead her through the sea of older witches. Harry nodded.
"Hey," Draco bumped their shoulders together, "Why don't we go fly around, I have my own Quidditch pitch."
"Oh hush, at least your hair isn't dead anymore," Merry brushed through her hair. Merry finished with her hair and changed in front of both Harry and Pansy. Harry could never do that, she can just feel their eyes on her body that was once bruised and broken. Pansy started to brush her teeth at a different sink. There were six different sinks and six showers. The showers were just a gray curtain to cover the shower, that is not a lot of privacy. Soon everyone was laying down to sleep. Harry shut her curtains after saying goodnight to everyone. She pulled out her phone to see that it was 10:30. She watched some cartoon comedy that just ended up confusing Harry. She checked her phone again, 12:23. Harry pulled back a curtain to see everyone asleep and someone was snoring lightly, probably Millicent. Harry tiptoed to Merry's closed bed and pulled back the curtains slightly.
Harriet gasped loudly, how did she do that?! She just saw their entire conversation and felt every emotion. Lucius Malfoy was calm and angry at the same time while Dumbledore was... well it felt cold and nervous. She definitely has to make note that she should never mess with either of them, especially Draco's father because he seemed quite scary. She just thought about how their conversation will go and then she suddenly could see it and feel it. It was kind of like those weird dreams where your body wasn't there but your mind was. Harriet wondered how else she could use this newly found power.
"Hi Riley," She nodded at him shyly. Merry went to hug Severus while Draco hugged Riley, Riley seemed to give longer hugs while Severus gave tighter ones. After Merry hugged Riley, Severus and Harriet made eye contact. She nodded at him which made him raise an eyebrow again and nod back in acknowledgment. Riley patted Harriet's shoulder and squeezed it lightly.
"When the teachers hand it off to the troll experts, they will kill it and sell its organs for an expensive price!" She should know, Mr. Feose told her how expensive they are and how they kill the ones who are lost and can cause destruction.
"Was it magic or did you just suddenly know?" Merry's eyes were wide and her arms gesturing everywhere.
~I wish to sleep,~ Beetlejuice hissed as his head poked out. He flicked his tongue to taste the air and slithered out with the help of Harry.
"Open up!" A girl's voice shouted urgently and she pounded on the door. Harriet was the first to jump up and answer the pounding. She used her magic to light all of the candles and shut off the television. The first years groaned in confusion as they awoke suddenly.
"I studied most of the courses for 7 years and I have probably read half of the books in the Wizarding World," She giggled.
"Sir, if his meeting is all about you being concerned because you are afraid of me turning dark just due to who I hang out with, I think we are done. And I'm not trying to be rude sir, I'm really not."
"I have to agree with Merry, this is a major compliment from Slytherins to just give you the position without having you try out," Daphne nodded.
"Today is the day that Harriet's parents died, that's why she is feeling down!" The first years gasped all together, they had completely forgotten! With their pureblood parents, most had to not grieve nor celebrate the death of you-know-who. They simply forgot what even happened on this day because they were taught to forget.
"Well then you have to explain to Snape why you weren't in his class," She rang out as she walked away. Harriet's eyes widened and quickly packed up her things.
Nothing. She did it again. Nothing. She did it harder. Still nothing. She looked up and looked for Flint's eyes. His eyes were equally confused. She pushed again, using her shoulders this time. Still nothing. Harriet rubbed her face tiredly. She felt her broom twitch, her heart jumped. Dear Merlin, please don't stop working now. She looked up to at the Teacher's area. Riley looked extremely worried, Snape was saying something under his breath to himself. She studied the movement of his mouth, he seemed to be chanting something. Also, Quirrell seemed to be doing the same thing. Her eyebrows furrowed in confusion. Her broom seemed to twitch at sudden movements but only slightly. She grabbed onto it, fearing the worst. She grabbed on at the right moment because her broom suddenly took off. The crowd gasped as it took her at odd turns and sudden movements. She looked up at Snape and whispered a fire charm. Fire lit his robe, Riley shrieked and stood up. Snape jumped up and patted the fire out. Quirrel fell out of his seat which meant her broom stopped moving but its last movement was throwing her off her broom. She squealed quietly and gripped onto the broom with one hand as she hanged.
"You just don't want to make a fool of yourself by not knowing where to go for classes," Merry snorted.
"Ewww!" The girls squealed. The day soon ended with Merry and Harry promising to text each other as soon as they got home. Harry used a floo to get back home to Mr. Feose. She was greeted with black gates. She knocked on the gates.
"Now get on but don't take off, that is for a different date," She explained which made students moan, they wanted to fly properly.
"Oh yeah, right. Let's go," She picked up her bag and looked again at him. He was still staring at her which made her want to stare back, but she had to go to class. So she looked forward and exited the Great Hall feeling his eyes on her as she walked out.
"Yes?" Mr. Feose said while drumming the tips of his fingers on the counter. She just gave him a look in return.
Harriet gripped her broom tighter and bit her lip nervously, "Yeah you are right, but I'm still really nervous."
"I would love to sit by you," She giggled which made him blush harder. She sat down and looked behind her to see the rest of the Slytherins making dramatic faces at her sitting by the Gryffindors. She tried not to laugh at their faces. She looked at Hermione who was staring at her, probably wondering what she was thinking.
"Albus, this is not the time for small talk." He stopped in front of his desk, house elf beside the man.
Harriet heard the door open again and she turned away from Marcus and his friends talking to look at a sharp looking man. He had deep cheekbones and his hair was perfectly set, even more than Draco's. His eyes flickered onto her emerald ones, his stare burned into her. She looked down shyly and turned back to Marcus, she shuffled closer to him and shivered knowing that the man was still looking at her back. Marcus noticed her move closer to him and he wrapped a blanket around her. He flinched when he saw the reason why she shifted closer to him.
"Anguis," Jason snarled at the door which opened immediately. Harry smiled because she knew anguis was Latin for snake. They walked in one by one.
"I'm Oliver Feose," He said. He wanted to add that he was Harry's guardian but he was not legally so he didn't want to raise questions.
"Just know that I never mean to hurt you or insult you. Just tell me to stop if I ever make you uncomfortable. And if you ever need anything, ask me. I know I'm not the best friend in the world but if you tell me things that I can't read from just looking at you, we can make any situation better. Okay?" Merry smiled brightly at her. Harriet nodded her head quickly not wanting to spill more tears in front of her.
"Your hair needs it," Merry smirked. They spent over an hour in the washroom on her hair, strengthening it, moisturizing it, fixing the dead ends, the whole works. Pansy came in to make sure they were still alive.
"Good Morning Ackerson, Jennings, Bloom," Riley smiled to them while Snape sneered at them silently.
"We just have to be by our parents for a bit then all the kids come up after," Draco promised. Harriet nodded and they said bye quickly before leaving her alone. She waited around 20 minutes, just eating pretzels and some chocolates from Draco. She really enjoyed the chocolate he bought her, it was super sweet and creamy. She soon became super restless so she opened up Draco's door and looked down the hallway. No one was near. She bit her lip, wondering if she should leave or not.  So she stepped out of his room and started to walk down the hallway, she followed the loud noises and laughing coming from a large room. Her heart rate quickened at remembering Merry's warning but the curiosity was killing her. She found a darkened open doorway and stuck her head in nervously. She gasped when she saw everyone in the ballroom, everyone was either in fancy robes or expensive dresses.
"Just watch some Netflix," Merry pulled out her phone and handed it to Harry. Harry searched until she found a show called A Series of Unfortunate Events and started watching it out loud while Merry did her hair. Harry went through two full episodes which took two hours until Merry was done with her hair.
"What do you have planned?" Merry looked at her in wonderment and slight fear. She just smirked and went to her trunk. She dug out two potion bottles and handed one to Merry.
"Has Harriet texted you yet?" Theodore asked which gained everyone attention and all looked at Merry impatiently for the answer.
"Good evening first years, I hope you had a pleasant first night. I am Professor Snape, you will address me as sir. I am the Head of the Slytherin House if you have a problem come to me. Slytherin's are known for keeping things to themselves, if you have a problem, tell either Ms. Farley or Mr. Zang, myself or an older year that you trust. I beg of you to not go everywhere accusing people without evidence. Do not charge at the first sight of conflict. But if you fear that someone's life is in danger, please notify me immediately. I expect you to get at least average grades and not make your house look like Hopefully, you will learn how Slytherin's properly act quickly by looking up to the older years," His voice was very sharp and direct. Nobody dared to interrupt him.
"I- I- I," She stumbled out, tears started to build up in her eyes but she didn't want to rub them. If she cried would they make her warm milk like they did for Dudley? Would they let her watch the tele for an hour?
"To some people but I don't think so," Merry calmed down Harriet who was quite nervous. "I don't think it is wrong, I think that love is love no matter what. Also, gay marriage is allowed here."
Merry pointed to the two kids playing chess, "That is Ernie Macmillian, he is a Hufflepuff in our year." The blond boy looked up curiously when he heard his name, he smiled when they made eye contant and he waved shyly at her with a rising blush on his face. She giggled lightly and waved back. "And Hannah Abbott who is also a Hufflepuff in our year." The blonde girl smiled and shortly waved at her, Harriet waved back kindly. Merry introduced everyone else, most people would look up at her and smile at least. There were two random older Ravenclaw girls because their parents dragged them along and one Ravenclaw boy who was a 7th year whose father has high political power in the Ministry. There were also a few Gryffindor's but there were all older like in their 6th or 7th years. No one didn't even look at scar, not even once. The two Slytherin prefects were there, they talked to Harriet the most out of everyone there. Gemma, the girl Prefect, seemed so relaxed while Jason, the boy Prefect, kept chuckling and seemed so amused about the topics Harriet talked about. She felt a brush of fur on her hand which made her jump a bit.
After that Headmaster Dumbledore dismissed the first years so their head of houses and Prefects could introduce themselves and go over rules.
Harriet pushed her backpack more onto her shoulder and walked faster. She was running late to get to school because it was the day her parents died and she wasn't in the mood to even move. She quickly ran to class, attempting to not come in contact with Dudley and his gang. She quickly threw her backpack down and sat in her seat quietly. She listened to the older kids talk about what they are going to do for Halloween. Most talked about going trick or treating or some were going to parties with their parents. Harry really didn't understand either, she didn't have parents nor has she ever went trick or treating. Dudley always went with his 'friends' all of the time, he would always come home and rub how much candy he got in her face. She never took any candy because she almost got her hand cut off the last time she tried to eat some food when her Uncle wasn't looking. The teacher came in wearing a witches costume. Harriet secretly wondered if real witches wore those type of clothes. The teacher took the whole period talking about a scary Halloween story about how witches took the life out of children to make them younger. Later to bring justice, the villagers burnt the witches to death. Harriet shivered in her seat, it seemed so brutal to burn the witches alive. Dudley and Piers were whispering and smirking in front of her, that can't be a good thing.
"Most people in charge really don't think, they think about themselves or only look at one type of group which creates a biased. They have a hard time thinking about others or what will be best for society."
Draco stood up, "What do you need, Rosier?" Harriet was surprised at his tone, it was demanding and cold. Nothing like Draco's normal warm voice.
"I copied it off when I was in the Ministry, this is the prophecy. This is your destiny and future. This is you." Harry began to read.
The two girls made their way out of the dungeons while their school cloaks and wands. Harry also took Beetlejuice along so he could see his home for the next 7 years.
Draco walked into the room, "What are you two talking about? How stupid Rosier is?" He grumbled as he fluffed the pillows again.
"Slytherin because you would gain the most. You could learn, make friends, still be brave, value your own values, change minds and conquer whatever is in your way. Slytherin will help you on your way to victory, to conquering everything and anything, learning so much that people fear you. You will do excellent in Slytherin," The hat moved a little on her head ready to yell out her house. Even though he basically told her what house she was going to be in, she was still scared. Merry was her first friend, she wanted to be in the same house as her. "Slytherin!" The whole hall was dead silent, she was going to puke. Professor McGonagall took the hat off and silently congratulated her with a slight smile. Harry smiled back and thanked her. The whole hall was still kind of stunned but the Slytherin table burst out in cheers and clapped. Harry jumped off the stool and quickly walked to Merry who looked so proud of her. Merry saved a seat for her which was right next to her. Harry smiled as she saw her own robes turn into Slytherin colors. She knew she made the right choice. They hugged and laughed as Harry dramatically sighed.
"So what do I have to learn?" She looked up at him who was twice her size and height. He explained it very briefly and had her get on her broom and fly around for a bit.
"Sort of, I substitute classes at Hogwarts if needed and also help students tremendously with planning for life after Hogwarts. I teach in another wizarding school that is more old fashioned like Druids or Sorcerers/Sorceresses. It also is available to highly advanced Hogwarts students who want to take some extra classes. I teach Majoring in the Art of Caring For and Training Dragons and Multiple Other Beasts or as my students like to call it 'Dragons Class'," He chuckled.
"I was just so excited you were here, that's why we ran up here like toddlers right away," Merry laughed. They were smiling brightly as they shrunk their trunks, Harriet grabbed a blanket she got from Merry's mother for an early Christmas. Merry told her mother that Harriet likes soft things and she loves cuddling with anything. Harriet cried when she got her first Christmas present and it was a meaningful present, it even had a Slytherin crest on it which she loved. They walked downstairs, Harriet almost tripped on her fluffy blanket that she was carrying. Beetlejuice, her snake, was around her torso which hides him due to her large Slytherin sweatshirt. Harriet didn't know how to dress up to meet Malfoy's parents.
"You are always welcome here Harriet. I can see why Draco likes you so much," She chuckled into her hand.
Merry chuckled, "Are you better now sweetie?" Harriet nodded, which made her unruly hair go everywhere. Harriet gave up on making it straight then curly, too much work in the morning. Plus she liked it when it was messy, it annoyed Pansy a lot. Her contacts were also itchy lately so she has been wearing glasses lately, they were big rimmed glasses with a black frame and some gold on the side for details. Merry refused for Harriet to wear her old ones, saying they looked horrid on her. Her glasses also annoyed Pansy, saying the glasses distracted people from her vibrant green eyes.
"NO!" Screamed the bushy haired girl. The toad flew over Neville and the girls' heads and into Harry's open hand.
Just wrote a little chapter cause I have to study for 3 quizzes tomorrow even though it is 11pm now. Anyways hope ya enjoyed <3
~Tis was a dream, nothing more. Don't worry young one~ He hissed and nudged her cheek. She wept into her pillow and also dug her nails into the pillow. Beetlejuice hissed calming words to her as she tried to calm herself down. When she had her breathing under control, she wiped off her face.
"We will introduce you to everyone when they all get here," Merry explained, she motioned Harriet to go join her on the floor full of blankets and pillows. Harriet grabbed her book for comfort as well as her fluffy blanket and sat a bit away from the main circle, not wanting to get too close. The twins sat across from her, perfectly side by side. Draco sat to her right and Merry sat to her left, in some sort of protective way. A few more people entered, more older, Harriet turned to see Flint with a few of his friends. Flint was off to the side, not seeming to be leading the group. Harriet kept her head down, not wanting to make eye contact with everyone but she was relieved that she would find out everyone's name quite easily in the exchange of her own. Several others entered Draco's room in the span of about, all of them were entering in smaller groups of only one or two. All seemed to become visibly happier and more relaxed coming into the room and seeing everyone sitting down. Some were already starting to eat some food that Draco most likely had the house elves get earlier, the older kids were off on their own on some chairs that they transfigured from some of Draco's books. While Harriet was at awe from the level of transfiguration it took to preform that action, the kids more of their age sat near them, most likely all at Hogwarts still. Some were reading or doing homework that they snuck in, a pair was playing chess and the odd twins were playing a clapping game with their hands.
"Yeah, it can get a bit boring by all of the parents talking about businesses and other pureblood tasks."
"Sit down please," Gemma smiled at Harry when she saw her innocent, questing eyes looking around. Harry blushed and smiled back. Merry practically punched her arm to make her look at the glass part of the common. Harry gasped, you could see a huge squid and bunch of other fishes go by. It was so pretty and magical. The water seemed to glow and glitter. One wall ahead of them had a roaring fireplace with a painting of some sort, maybe some famous wizard. The wall to their left was filled with bookcases and antiques which made Harry perk up in excitement. There was a crystal chandelier above them and the room was decorated very well with furniture and other antiques. It was still dark in the common room but definitely brighter than outside. They all sat down, Harry again was in the middle of Merry and Draco. Draco was ranting on about how every single ancestor on his blood line was in Slytherin. Blaise was sitting in an armchair near Merry mocking Draco silently which was making everyone laugh even the Prefects. Harry couldn't laugh because Draco was only looking directly at her. He really seemed to be trying to impress her. Suddenly a door slammed open that was not the entrance, everyone but Harry jumped. She was used to slamming doors and worse. It was a very pale, tall man that was wearing all black robes. He has shorter, straightened black hair that seemed to be greasy. He also had pitch black eyes that looked a bit weird to Harry. He had an emotionless face and body which impressed Harry, she had a hard time hiding her expressions.
"Thank you sir, for taking time out of your busy schedule to tell me what is wrong and what is right," She sassied him lightly while giving off an innocent look despite her words.
That night Harriet was the last to fall asleep, Merry and Draco fell asleep as soon as their heads hit their pillows. Merry seemed to take up most of the room in Draco's large bed.  After Harriet got up to calm herself some more, Draco just curled up against another pillow and slept quietly. Harriet was sitting near a window, looking at Marcus's gift to her. She undid the red ribbon slowly, she was curious to see what he got her. She slid off the cover and gasped when she saw the necklace, it was a simple chained necklace with the Slytherin crest on it. For some reason, holding the Slytherin crest in her hands made her eyes start to tear up. She rubbed away her tears, not wanting to cry over a gift. But seeing that crest, knowing that she truly does belong in Slytherin where this necklace proves how much she belongs there, it creates a overwhelming sense of pride and happiness. Even more than when she got her Hogwarts letter or when she caught the first snitch, this was her very own symbol that she belongs. That was more than she ever could ask for.
Harry was once more up an about, albeit, slowly and painfully. During the interim before he could move enough to complete tasks, he got a meal once a day, for each of the 3 days that he rested. It was miraculous that he was even up to begin with. He likely shouldn't have been, as every movement was still excruciating.
Harry took notice of these details while making it seem as if he were simply enjoying the music. It stopped for a moment, which caused Harry to look at the man again. The guitarist seemed shocked by the scar on Harry's forehead. The boy looked down, pushing his glasses up his face and pulling his fringe over the blemish.
In his sleep he had nightmares about Vernon, and about being left by close friends he didn't have. He had woken up multiple times in the night, feverish and in tears. One thing that perturbed him above all else, was the dream he had.
At this Harry lifted his shirt to reveal Delphinium wrapped around his torso. She had momentarily forgotten about the snake, she was too absorbed in revealing to Harry the infirmation he'd been denied. Harry spoke again to the snake.
Nonetheless, this was a task that would take him a considerable amount of time. His only tool was the bucket, and a single weed would result in dire consequences. He hissed after listening for anyone who could be listening.
"He- he- he beat me. With a belt." Tears began to stream from his eyes. The glasses wearing woman felt her heart drop.
"Get back, you fools!" Harry screamed, throwing them away from the pile. The banging hadn't stopped, the desks were slowly but surely being moved away from the heavy steel door. Harry forced them back into place, looking around the room for more heavy objects to secure the entrance.
"You'll learn in time. You should rest more, I'm going to make some food." Remus stood, the chair he'd been sitting on scraping across the floor. He walked over to the door, opening it slowly.
"Shit..." Then he spoke up. "Right, erm, just a second!" Thhe werewolf walked briskly to the kitchen and opened then shut a couple drawers, finally finding what he was looking for in the drawer next to the refrigerator: a bundle of napkins he'd grabbed from various sit in restaurants around town. He walked over to the restroom door and knocked softly.
"I should have known." His expression changed to something inscrutable. "Might I ask how you came to possess such a snake? I'm not sure I've seen anything like it."
The serpent dipped her scaly head forward slightly, and flicked her tongue; a sign that she was excited.
She poised herself lazily, her remaining mass that couldn't be lifted coiled around her. To Harry, she almost seemed like a human sitting with her legs crossed. The thought amused him, he relaxed slightly.
his scaled companion spoke. Harry gasped quietly and lept a short distance. He turned to face the serpent, still unsure whether or not he could believe what he was seeing and hearing.
Harry Potter was six years old now, and his sweet innocence was already bleeding away to bitterness. He hobbled forward through the small garden, on his thin legs that had only enough muscle for him to walk and work; he was searching for weeds, without gloves or tools of any kind. He didn't even have shoes on his tiny, dirt caked feet. The summer sun beat down on his back, which was barely covered by the tank top that used to belong to his grotesquely fat cousin. The shirt hung loose off the malnourished frame, exposing more skin to the burning rays of the season. It also exposed a patchwork of bruises, a lattice work of scars, and a battlefield of small circular bruises that pock-marked his torso.
Numb. That is what he felt. If you could call numbness a feeling. All of his senses felt dead except for being very aware of his aching body. Green, emerald coloured eyes lacked their usual brightness. As if the transparent body of a crystal had somehow become slightly opaque. A glossy lusterless film had formed over his spirit.
He needed to come up with something soon, Delphinium has been warning him more and more often of Vernon's malicious intent. They both grew increasingly concerned about Harry's safety. He needed a second opinion. Harry touched his fingertips to the lock on the door.
So, this chapter is short due to having been written years ago. If I'm to continue the story I will have to get back in the swing of things. Apologies!
"I will not, you are dismissed. You're disrupting my duties." He glared at her from beneath his brow.
He had managed to maintain his hold over a considerable percentage of his pawns in the ministry. But his grasp was shakey over most of those he possessed. He personally had only those most firmly in his palms personally searching for his most important piece in the game. He had one saving grace amidst this debacle, the muggle prime minister.
Harry walked toward that end of the alley, a grim expression on his face. His eyes were filled with rage and fear, his uncle flashed across his vision. He walked past the man who had tried to violate him, into a part of the alley that was definitely not visible from the street.
Soon he noticed that he was getting extremely tired, and his nausea was not extending beyond only being caused by pain. He felt faint, and lightheaded. His head began to throb.
The bearded wizard spoke as he picked up one of the objects, a small replica of a quidditch broom (a prized gift from another messy haired student, long gone). "I have been wondering where you've been, Minerva. Care to tell me?"
"Where would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?" He asked her another question, trying to stump her. Hermione again raised her hand
"Yes I will see you later Ms. Potter, I hope you have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year," Some twinkle in his eyes was back but not fully.
"Yes I am," Harry blushed and played with her hair. She would play with her skirt or the buttons on her blouse but she had nothing to show off to impress him like Merry did. But she could impress him with her intelligence! Could her intelligence impress a Hufflepuff?
"I mean I have a sore throat and my eyes really hurt," That was more from her nightmares but she didn't want to say anything.
"Hogwarts does have an impressive library, no one has ever read all of the books in the 7 years they were here. As for the Quidditch players," He laughed. Harriet and Merry laughed back. She liked this professor, he is nice and funny. He also is very easy to talk to.
"Welcome to Hogwarts, I except your journey here was good," She had a very crisp voice. "I am Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor and you are about to enter Hogwarts. The four houses are Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, and Slytherin. I expect you to behave and study hard throughout your 7 years here" It was obvious she didn't like Slytherin and loved her own house. Otherwise, she seemed perfectly fine, just on the strict side. "I hope you get into the house you want." She went to close the door again but she finished with, "I think it is best to straighten yourselves out while I am away," while staring at a redhead's dirty nose and some others messy robes. She left which made many students sigh in relief. Students straightened their hair and robes nervously. Harry just stared at the door emotionless. She really didn't know what to feel, happy, scared, nervous. She was feeling so many emotions in her life it made her chest hurt. Merry was playing with her skirt and Millicent was tugging at her hair. The door opened again and she motioned them to follow her. The large man walked aside McGonagall. Harry looked at the roof which was filled with stars and candles. Page 184 paragraph 3 explains the ceiling in Hogwarts: A History Harry remembered. The bushy haired girl from before was saying the same thing out loud which earned her a few glares from the other students. But she didn't say the page or paragraph which made Harry puff out her chest proudly. The other older students didn't seem to care about the first years at the front of the hall. A hat that seemed to be made out of rags was on a stool. The sorting hat, Harry smirked, she already knew how they were going to be sorted unlike all of the other students. The redhead with dirt still on his nose was grumbling something about twins and a troll. The hat sang out,
"Both Hogwarts?" he said in a raspy voice which made Harry shiver. Merry just nodded and gripped onto Harry's arm tighter.
"Yes you do," Mr. Feose whispered back. His heart was breaking because he knew that she would probably never seen her godfather. He continued to rub her back as she cried softly.
"Draco is with his father, they went to a store down the road to go grab some last minute supplies for the Christmas party tonight. And Merry was grabbing some snow outside to hit Draco with when they come home." Harriet giggled at her statement. "Would you like to have a cup of hot chocolate with me?"
"So you can see your friends and not feel as bummed out during the Holidays, plus Flint will be there," Merry sang out teasingly which made Harriet blush lightly.
"I don't know," Harry sat back down. A few more hours passed with Merry on her phone and Harry and Millicent reading.
"The stomach of a goat, pregnant female goats are the best for the most powerful and most useful bezoar, sir," She made direct eye contact with him, already knowing that he appreciated when students didn't question their answers.
"Same here," Merry laughed and grabbed her hand. They skipped to a store which was labeled Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. in gold writing. Merry walked in first, dragging Harry behind her. No one was in the room so they let their eyes wander around the shop.
"She must feel so miserable," Pansy cooed, ever since they met Pansy felt the need to be like her older sister and always protect her. Even if she never shows it.
'Humans, please I want an owner who will give me milk and a ball of yarn,' The kitten meowed. Harry cooed and put her finger in the cage which the kitten licked and nibbled on.
"You can sit," Narcissa smiled. Harriet sat across from her quietly, trying to take up the least amount of space possible.Harriet sat across from her quietly, trying to take up the least amount of space possible. "How are you, Harriet? Did you sleep well last night?" Harriet tried to calm herself, Narcissa seemed quite nice and her voice was super soft. Harriet wondered if this is how all mothers are, Cara, Merry's mother, is always nice to her also but she is quieter than Narcissa. Narcissa is seeming to put in extra effort for Harriet to be calmed, Cara always knew when Harriet needed her space or quiet time.
Her teachers never said anything, they always were curious when they saw new bruises every day. They wanted to say something. They really did. But in the small town of Little Whinging, everything must be perfect from the people to lawns to the school system. Having an abuse case in their small town will ruin their reputation completely, so they have to keep their mouths shut even if a few kids suffer greatly.
"Feel better Harriet, I will write a note explaining your absences so you won't get into trouble. If you need something, don't be hesitant on asking. I'm always here to answer questions and help others," He patted her head and let himself out after saying goodbye to everyone.
"Eat a bit before we leave, you need your strength," Pucey gestured to some fruit and bread. "You are more than ready for this, you will be fine." He patted her head softly. The group ate and talked, Harriet felt really welcomed here. They all treated her like a little sister which made her chest warm up. Was this the same feeling when she thought Flint was kind of cute? If it was, does she like Flint? In what way does she like him? She doesn't have time to work this out, she has a game to win.
It was the end of the day and she was trying to rush out of school so she didn't have to deal with the other kids. She quickly walked onto the school courtyard and trying to calm down. Dudley and Piers probably weren't going to do anything anyways.
"Okay, you promise that you will take extra care of her," She pouted and swung the cat around a bit.
The man laughed which sounded like... well Harry didn't know how to explain his laugh. His laugh was beautiful like the rest of him.
"Better! Friends!" She swung open the door to reveal everyone which made Harriet yelp. "Wait shit did I scare you? Shit sorry!"
"Yeah, I eat a lot," Harry joked while faking a laugh. Merry didn't notice her fake laugh and laughed along.
Harry walked slowly to Mr. Feose's shop, wanting to disappear. She always has wanted to disappear but the want to prove the Dursleys' wrong overrode that want. She is very determined to prove to them that yes, she is a freak but she is so much more than that. Do you ever have thoughts that go like, 'I could kill that person and it would be like nothing happened'? Well, Harry had those thoughts a lot, they mostly came after one of the Dursleys' would hurt her. After her Uncle or her Aunt beat her, and after Dudley and his friends would make fun of her or beat her. Even though Harry has these thoughts, you have to understand, she is completely innocent. She would never want to hurt a fly. It is funny that people say that phrase, they are so innocent that they wouldn't even hurt a fly. Honestly, to truly be innocent the phrase should be they are so innocent they wouldn't hurt the person holding a gun to their head. That way it shows true innocence, not wanting to hurt anyone even the one planning your death. The definition of innocent is to not hurt or harm even though the definition changes in different mouths. It takes a lot of will power to not harm the one planning your death. So that is what Harry is, innocent. She does not wish for them to die, in her eyes, every single life is worth living, even the Dursleys'.
Everyone looked very scary to her, everyone looked so powerful and wise. She hid and watched the elegant people talking and dancing, it had a very odd feeling to it which gave Harriet the shivers. The ballroom was stunning, it was emerald and marble stone with jewels everywhere and a giant chandiler in the middle of the room. Lucius was talking to a group of powerful men in dark robes, Narcissa was laughing with some other housewives. Riley and Cara were talking to Mr. Feose? Mr. Feose isn't a pureblood by any means, nor should he hold any politic power. Riley was sipping his drink lightly while observing him like a true Slytherin, steathy and gathering information before striking him with a question which would destroy Mr. Feose's composure. Cara was frowning at him and Mr. Feose was chuckling carelessly. Harriet continued to wonder why Riley and Cara were talking to him until she saw a flash of purple, it was Merry dragging Draco to what Harriet guessed to be another doorway. She also saw some other younger kids depart from their parents who were deep into conversation. Harriet quickly ran from the ballroom, watching out for anyone. She ran back into Draco's room, she bent over panting with her hand on her chest. She flopped onto Draco's bed and grabbed a book that she was reading from that afternoon, she read only a few sentences before there was a knock on the door.
"Not since last night and that cookie," Mr. Feose always has made her eat 3 meals per day no matter what. He always would rant about how important it is for a growing young body to eat properly. This way she doesn't have malnutrition at all but she does lack vitamin D. He makes her take some vitamin potions that makes her very healthy and her bones stronger.
"It's not dead, just knocked out!" Harriet explained. She quickly thought of a place for the troll to go, in troglodytarum agri which is a cave where most trolls live. She shouted a travel spell and the name of the cave, the troll will arrive unharmed and should wake up in 20 minutes. The troll disappeared with a loud pop.
"She set the match on fire and when the flames died down the needle was just there," Merry said excitedly. Other students turned towards them and started to whisper. Harriet felt the world close in on her slowly and started to panic.
"This way!" Shouted Gemma which led them going downwards on a moving staircase, while it was moving! All of the students gasped and looked around excitedly. The staircase shifted into place which made the kids scream a little at the sudden movement. They walked down the stairs and walked all of the way to the dungeons. It was very dark and cold down here. Harry was used to the cold and dark in her cupboard so she was going to be fine. Beetlejuice poked his head out of her collar.
"Maybe just wear a nice sweatshirt and some nice pants," Merry offered while she applied some lipstick. Harriet got up and went back to into Draco's room to see him laying down blankets and pillows. There were a lot of snacks in the room now, Merry came out and grabbed a cupcake from the tray Draco was setting down. She ate it while Draco was running around trying to sort everything. Harriet just stood out of the way trying to understand what was happening. Harriet grabbed a sweatshirt and a pair of jeans to go change into. After she changed, Merry changed into a plain purple dress with black shoes. Draco then changed into emerald robes which made his silver hair stand out.
"Thanks," She smiled at Merry. "I probably will shower tomorrow morning," Harry told her while putting away the soap in her trunk at the end of her bed. Some girls were talking about some love show and others were talking about classes. Harry took out a baggy t-shirt and some shorts to sleep in. She also grabbed her toothbrush and some night moisturizer. She went across the hall and changed out of her Slytherin robes. She changed and brushed her teeth. Someone knocked on the door when she was putting on moisturizer. Merry walked in with a bunch of hair product.
"We?" Harriet looked up from the floor about to slide down a secret passage that leads to the outside of the dungeon.
Harriet giggled, "You can call me Harry, but Morning Neville." He nodded shyly and turned back to his Hogwarts: A History copy. She noticed that Hermione was staring at her, more like glaring a bit. Harry smiled brightly and waved excitedly, trying to make a new friend. Hermione seemed confused by her waving but smiled back slightly in return before reading again. Harriet nodded to herself, she really did want to have lots of friends in this school. This was a chance to start off new. She sat down by Merry and looked over her prepared notes for the lesson. Mr. Feose had multiple lesson plans for each class so she prepared notes and objectives to learn. She also wrote down key ideas and events from the wars.
"I don't want to take his position though, maybe I can get out of this," Harriet really didn't want to ruin his dreams.
"Well usually everyone in our Slytherin year, Pansy, Blaise, Tracey, you already know the rest. And Flint, Pucey, Warrington, and Montague. Also Farley and Zang, the two Slytherin Prefects. The Carrow twins, Flora and Hestia, they are 3rd years. Sullivan Fawley is a Hufflepuff who is a 2nd year, his parents have quite a powerful position in the Wizarding world. Hannah Abbott and Ernie Macmillan are both Hufflepuffs in our year, both of their parents work for the Ministry." Draco knew so much about families that are purebloods, he looks like he could list off purebloods.
"Yeah, I guess," She murmured and curled back into a ball and sighed heavily. The girls all shared a weird look, wondering why she was acting so weird.
"How do you fall asleep then? I always have to take sleeping pills to fall asleep cause I'm a very light sleeper. So I need a really strong pill to knock me out for the whole night," Harriet chuckled, she found sleeping in a room with other girls very odd for some reason. She was too used to quiet nights alone so hearing people shifting when they sleep or making any noise in general really put her on edge. Therefore she became very restless and she needed a higher dosage to keep her asleep all night.
"I knew you were, that is why I wrote them," Harriet opened her mouth in effect. Merry pushed her elbow softly into her forearm and clicked her tongue. Soon all of the Gryffindors piled in a few seconds before the bell rang. The students sat there for a few moments but the teacher came in, a ghost.
4 hours later after countless clothing and accessories were thrown at her to try on, they were done shopping. Merry's mother had a nice warm smile but tired eyes. She was very skinny and had her light brown hair in a messy bun. Merry was very excited to try things on just like Harry. Harry was really into the dresses she bought, they were mostly to her knees and were really flowy. Merry also made Harry buy a crap ton of makeup which Harry was less excited about because she never had an interest in makeup. Halfway through their shopping, Harry forgot that she hadn't said her name. It made Harry almost to start crying when putting on a robe that complete strangers were being really nice to her. When the three were satisfied with what they got, they went to check out and bought everything. Harry wore out an emerald green dress that went to her knees and black converses. A new lady was at the counter and checked out everything. Merry's mother wanted to buy Harry's clothes but Harry said she had the money. Merry's mother was about to make Merry say goodbye to Harry but Harry suggested lunch after seeing Merry looking really torn. The three went to some shop for sandwiches and ice cream, Merry sat by Harry while her mother sat across from them. Harry really liked Merry and her mother, they were really nice and seemed to really care about her. Merry was ranting on and on about this place and the food. Merry ended up ordering for Harry because Harry trusted Merry's opinions. Merry proved that she had good taste in clothing and makeup so Harry trusted her to have good taste in food. Merry and Harry were bonding the whole time on their journey, talking about celebrities and Quidditch. They had become friends over the few hours spent together.
"I'd rather cry," Harry whined. Millicent was reading again, Harry figured that she was reading an adult book. Beetlejuice was sleeping in a ball in a corner and Willow was still fighting with the plush dragon. Autumn was on Millicent lap still and still slightly glaring at Harry. Merry sprayed some weird liquid in her hair to make it wet. She brushed her hair and kept spraying until it was flat. Harry used her magic to flatten it because she knew that the liquid and brush would do nothing to her hair. Merry heated up her wand and wrapped a piece of hair around her wand to curl it.
"Lady Merry of the Baxter Household, it is nice to meet you," Harry bowed her head in respect. Some purebloods can be very offended if you don't address them right. Merry just waved her hand.
Cara chuckled at the children's excitement, "But behave you three." They almost ran up the stairs while the adults gossiped and drank tea.
"Freak", Her Aunt called from the kitchen. Harry quickly folded and put the letter in her back pocket. She gave the rest of the mail to her Uncle who just scoffed at her. Aunt Petunia knew that her letter would be coming and was trying to prevent her from going. But oh was she wrong, Harry was going to Hogwarts no matter what.
"Potty!" Crap. Dudley and his gang. She walked faster and ignored their taunting calls. "Potty!" They started to run fast towards her so she started to run also.
Harriet sat down across from her and in between Pucey and Flint. Shit. "Bit nervous," She mumbled and smiled nervously.
I feel like I have to explain this chapter a bit, I always have wondered how Muggle-borns (or in Harry's case half-blood) handle being in the muggle world which portrays witches as evil. So the Muggle-borns or Harry grow up thinking witches and wizards are bad but then they find out that they are one so what do they do? They have to be afraid of themselves and have the thought that they are evil themselves. I tried to have Harriet feel this and also have the abuse from Dudley and his gang be included to really show how Harriet felt as a kid with magic. Plus the reason why Piers harms her is not just because he is a kid and rude but because he is also taught magic is evil so Harriet is evil also. Hope this cleared things up a bit
"I'm not mad, don't worry. I heard that you are really good, you will be amazing," He smiled at her.
"Cedric is a head boy, he is supposed to be searching the halls for students," Riley nodded at the ashamed Hufflepuff and raised an eyebrow at the Slytherins.
"Wolfsbane is more common in potions because of the rubbery texture of the plant absorbs the potion better than monkshood which has a more leathery texture but otherwise they are the same plants, just different names," She rambled on. Snape seemed impressed by her advanced answer.
"So no," She clicked her tongue, "Alrighty then." She sipped her pumpkin juice with her eyes wide open. Flint slapped Pucey upside the head.
"I mean if you are really good, then you can catch me!" Merry shouted and took off again. Harriet laughed at chased her into the night. They flew until their lungs hurt and their cheeks hurt from laughing. If only they could see the person watching them in the dark.
"Low-grade fever of 99.4, nothing too serious but we just have to watch that so it doesn't go up," He muttered to himself mostly. "Have you taken any painkillers lately?"
"I should have your wand before you start Hogwarts but for now I must get to work," He grabbed the parchment and disappeared. Harry and Merry just stared at each other until they bursted out laughing. They both exited the store crying from laughing so hard.
"I know, I know," Harriet giggled, "I am glad." She went to grab her plates of food and sat down next to Merry while Draco sat down next to her.
"Oh and this is Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle," Malfoy introduced them because they were too busy eating. But they looked up and waved at her when they heard their names. She smiled and waved back. They finished eating until they had to sing the Hogwarts song. The older years and other Professors looked really sick and strained.
"Let's go sit down for a moment," Merry's mother said. Merry's mother had trunks for both of them and multiple other supplies like potion kits and even a broom for both of them.
"Good morning," Harriet said sweetly like always. Her Uncle was never in a good mood in the morning so it was wise to be on his better side if he had one that is.
"Thank you Harriet!" Hermione ran up and hugged her. Harriet was frozen for a moment and then hugged back. "You saved me!" She wiped away her own tears.
"Like people were disowned, affairs happened, people were murdered," Merry shrugged, "Mother really never explained it too well, something just happened to make us less pure."
"Oh! I heard about that school, it was once called Bloodworth School of Dark Arts and Curses. It once was a school that was meant to teach the medieval druids and sorcerers about how to kill and torture muggles like King Uther Pendragon because of the purge."
"I studied for 7 years how to make a perfect potion every time. I know how to brew almost every potion known to the wizarding world. You can have this book back anyways, I know how to brew everything in it," She got up and handed the book to him. Severus is never the one to show emotion but she completely surprised him. Potter's daughter knew and actually liked to brew potions?! Impossible! He was about to bark at her about where she got the book but Riley spoke first.
"Let's go find an animal," Merry said between giggles. They both walked to the store holding each other up still giggling. The store was filled with owls that hooted loudly and cats that had more than one tail. They lazily walked down the aisles until Merry squealed excitedly.
"Thank you, that was very helpful Draco," She smiled, "I didn't expect you to explain so much to me, thank you very much."
"This is your washroom and this is your dorm," She opened the dorm to the left of her. "Breakfast starts at 7'o clock on the weekday and 7:30 on the weekend. Classes start at 9'o clock and as Snape said your schedules will be handed out tomorrow at breakfast. Don't worry if Snape seemed a little... well you know, he cares deeply about his students even though he doesn't seem like he does. We all do care about each other, other houses really don't like Slytherin so we have to stay together. I really do hope you find this place like a home, it may take a while but it will come soon. I hope you sleep well and make this your home for the next 7 years," She smiled at the girls. Harry decided that she really liked her. With that she left, leaving the girls to pick what bed was theirs. Harry chose the bed in between Merry's and Millicent's. She sat on her bed, it was so elegant. The blanket was a very thick, emerald green quilt and the sheets were emerald green silk. There were three pillows on her bed and there were silver curtains made of a thick material. There was a snake carving above head of the bed that had emerald eyes and a silver body. She really liked it here, it was cold and comforting. There also was a roaring fireplace near Daphne's bed and Tracey's. There were desks next to every other bed and there was at least one nightstand for each bed.
"Thanks," Harriet smiled back. Daisy flew back over to her original position when Marcus scowled at her for not practicing. Harriet for some reason thought back to Merry and her's conversation about attractive boys. Mark wasn't bad looking, what do people even look for in guys? Smart? Kind? Selfless? Patrick was quite shy and Derek seemed to hate everything. Pucey though was really nice to her and always liked to pat her head. Flint also was very nice to her and liked to ruff her hair. They both always went up to her and talked to her even when they weren't playing Quidditch. But Daisy also did that, could girls like other girls? Her Uncle and Aunt always said things like faggots and homosexuals burn in hell. Would she burn in hell if she fell in love with a girl? Harriet had to ask Merry some questions about this later. She looked up and made eye contact with Flint, her chest burned a bit and her face flushed. Why was this happening? Is this what it is like to have a crush on someone?
Harriet nodded her head, her eyes feeling a bit warm at the idea of her being welcome, "Thank you," She almost whispered while looking at the ground blinking rapidly.
"First years over here, first years over here!" The booming voice ordered. The three girls made their way over to a lake with dozens of small boats and a very large man.
"Thanks for being entertaining," Flint chuckled. They walked to the Slytherin common room while talking about Quidditch. He said the password and opened the door for her. She thanked him and went up to her dorm to put away her broom.
"Her name is Autumn," Millicent said when seeing Harry's stare at her cat on her lap. Autumn is a very fluffy orangish cat with a weird nose. She seemed to glare at Harry.
Harry walked downstairs with a smirk on her face. Her Aunt was still attempting to get her Uncle's attention.
"I won't be so sure about that," The four gasped and turned to the destroyed entrance to see Riley and Neville. "I am sure that Slytherin's were the first escorted to their common room." He crossed his arms and tapped his foot.
"Shall we go visit the others?" Riley smiled at the small group, Draco led the group with Merry and Harriet right behind him. Once they entered the adults all said their hellos and got their hugs from each other. Lucius clapped Severus on the back while Riley hugged Narcissa and Cara gently. Riley and Severus both sat on the couch across from Narcissa and Lucius. Riley gave Draco a few presents to pass around which were from both Riley and Severus. The adults talked about... something but Harriet couldn't really pay attention since she had several well-wrapped presents in front of her, they were for her and only her. She smiled to herself as she held a small present in her cold hands. She heard a click and she looked up to see Narcissa taking a photo of Draco opening his first present which was a warm turtleneck, still a bit too big for him. He smiled at the camera and held up his dark green sweater proudly. Harriet got really excited to open up her first present, well her second since Cara got her that fluffy blanket which she cuddled with last night. But it would be her first present on Christmas, her heart beat faster as her and Merry opened up their first presents together. Harriet tore the wrapping nicely while Merry just ripped into it. She heard another click from the camera and looked over to see that Merry got a necklace which she put on immediately and thanked the Malfoy's. Harriet delicately opened up the box to see a makeup thing, she took it out and Merry helped show it to the camera and Harriet smiled on instinct. The camera clicked again to show it was no longer going so Harriet looked at the makeup thing more closely.
"I was scared," Harriet sniffled, she was quite cold since she slept on the floor the whole night. But she can curl up in her bed tomorrow in her own room, right?
"Sorry guys, I warned him that Hermione was here but I didn't know you were here," He hung his head in shame.
"Afternoon," She said dumbly, not knowing what to say. He just grunted in reply and turned to Riley.
"They were very interesting. Thank you so much!" Harry said while bouncing on the balls of her feet. Ms. Haack chuckled as she checked in the books. Ms. Haack always had a soft spot for Harry. She knew Harry lived in a bad home and it made her heart ache to see Harry be so grateful over the littlest things.
"She said to bring food," She smiled. "But we have to stay there the entire time cause I told her that Herbology was canceled..."
'Loyal... Brave... Willing to fight for loved ones... resourceful and determined also though. Hmmm. I know just where to put you!' A voice in Merry's head appeared. The hat sang out 'Slytherin!' Merry smiled and walked casually to the Slytherin table. When a student got sorted and walked to their table, their black robes turned into their new house color robes. Soon Millicent was called up, she got into Slytherin also. Harry kept track of who was sorted where in her head so far.
Dumbledore was humming lightly and sucking on a lemon drop while messing with papers on his desk. There was a knock on his fireplace. He called in and waited for the visitor to come to his desk. The clicks of shoes, the patter of small bare feet, and the swishing of robes told him immediately who was in his office.
"Morning Harry," Slick said, that's his nickname from Harry. He slicks back his black hair out of his eyes and wears really silver, shiny clothes.
"Harry, I know what happened to your parents," Mr. Feose blurted out of nowhere. Harry choked on her pizza.
"I assume you are Harriet Lillian Potter," He said as a statement. Harry nodded and took a seat when the goblin sat down.
"Are we waiting for Severus and Riley?" Draco asked while he started to sort out the presents by the person. Harriet noticed there weren't as many gifts that Dudley received under the Christmas tree. Narcissa nodded her head softly while Lucius was whispering in her ear about something.
"Since my parents were murdered," Dumbledore flinched at that part, it seems that he hasn't gotten over her parents' death. To be honest, she doesn't think she has even gotten over it. "So?"
"But I want to stay here," Harry pouted, she really liked the library and how nice and quiet it was.
"Someone betrayed them, Peter Pettigrew. He was a deatheater, a follower of Voldemort. He craved power and control. He protected your parents and their secrets but he told Voldemort where they were hiding. Voldemort was Tom Riddle's name after he became insane. Followers that followed him when he was sane were killed but he gained followers when he was insane. He promised them different things like power and respect. Your parents wanted a man named Sirius Black to be their secret keeper but Black said it would be too obvious so Pettigrew became their secret keeper. The official documents that changed your parents' secret keeper were not writing yet so when your parents were murdered Black got the punishment. He is your godfather, he is your guardian. But he is in Azkaban for life due to your parents murders and 13 muggle deaths which Pettigrew is responsible for." Mr. Feose waited for Harry to ask questions because he knew that she would have lots. Harry just stared at the ground with tears rolling down her face. Mr. Feose got up and sat beside her, rubbing her back. He was going to start talking again but she beat him to it.
She looked up at Riley who smiled, "Only Professors and Advanced Healers can get ahold of those books, even those books are quite rare for Professors. Snape and I know a few people," Riley smirked.
"Come on Harriet!" Merry shouted. Harriet got up to where she was and suddenly Merry took off. Harriet followed and somehow ended up in front of her.
"Okay, that's good," Harriet let out a breath relieved, "We probably should go eat breakfast before the others get worried."
"What," Merry ordered back. The one who ordered them to stop looked at Merry amused. Harriet looked at Merry in fear, they could easily break them in half with their bare hands, no magic needed! The one who ordered them had black short hair and brown eyes. He also had a nose that looked like it was broken many times. The boy next to him had dirty blond hair and light green eyes. He looked more friendly than the rest of them. One boy who looked the oldest was half asleep and definitely was the tallest and biggest. He growled at her when he saw she was making eye contact with him. She continued to stare blankly at him which seemed to amuse him. The last boy was in the back completely bored and wanted to leave. He looked, even more, scarier than the one who ordered them to wait.
"This was made before your parents could put his name on or Severus Snape's name," Harry nodded because Mr. Feose talked about both Riley and Severus before but he never mentioned them being close to her parents.
"It is my favorite movie," Harry giggled. Merry started to pull out some makeup from her bag which made Harry groan.
"With you, now hurry up so they don't get suspicious," Merry sat down behind her waiting for her to go first.
"Will be here in 3 minutes," He states and grabs a cookie. The two eat cookies and talk about the new shipment of snakes they will be getting. Mr. Feose was not surprised when he found out that Harry could talk to snakes nor when he found out she could talk to all animals and in every language. He still wasn't surprised when she found out she could change her hair and body into anything she wanted from a lamp to another person. He didn't even seem to care that she can change her voice either even though like 3 other wizards could do this throughout all time. That is why Harry loves him so much, he doesn't care about her having a lot of power nor her name.
"Get cleaned up while I," He sighed heavily, "Clean the storage," He grumbled and turned dramatically. When the storage door shut, Harriet turned to Longbottom and stopped crying. He jumped at her sudden movement and his eyes were filled with worry.
"Wow I'm surprised that you wanted to sit this far back, you usually want to sit by the professors," Merry laughed. Harriet just smiled and pulled out her prepared notes. Draco started to rant about how his father taught him all about this subject. Harriet was polite and nodded along as he talked while Merry glared at him.
"Nah he was doing more than undressing if you ask me," Liam snickered. Cedric's jaw dropped while blushing. He quickly ran away from them. Both girls giggled and blushed from hearing their conversations.
"I'm glad. I prepared some potions for you," He went into the back while Harry sat in a chair by the fireplace trying to calm herself. He came back with several full vials. She grabbed the 4 she knew she needed to drink right away. She downed all of them and immediately felt them take effect. They filled out her body and made her face have more color. She sighed when she could not feel her ribs and her lips and cheeks were warm again. She lost a lot of weight in the last month but these potions would reverse the last month of not eating. Mr. Feose set the other 2 down by her on the table, they had to be taken with food.
Harry coughed and took a step back, "I'm Harry." The other girl gave her a weird look and turned to leave with her nose up. Neville thanked her again and followed after the other girl.
"Oh yeah, I should probably get there early. He probably doesn't want me to be late," She got up, "Wish me luck." The girls all wished her luck as she left the Great Hall. She walked down the corridors to the empty field, looking at everything around her. She heard an annoyingly loud voice, Draco.
(also I changed Harriet back to having green eyes, glasses and unruly hair because I felt like I was stripping her from truly being 'Harriet Potter' like I have a hard time imagining even Harry Potter differently because his green eyes, glasses, and unruly hair give so much to his character and I felt wrong for changing that in the first place)
"Why?" She cried and curled up into a ball. "Why do people hate witches so much? I don't think I am evil, am I?" She whimpered into the cool air. Why do the witches always have to be the villains who love to kill and eat children? She doesn't want to kill or eat children. Witches are always the ugly one too. Was she ugly? Maybe, she does have a weird scar on her forehead and she was quite knobbly. Maybe the whole world hates witches, maybe it was just some social norm. Hopefully, one day people will accept people with magical powers. Until then, she had to face the fact that others would not like her. She needed to learn that others won't take care of her so she will have to take care of herself.
Flint laughed loudly, "Don't worry I can take it." He ruffled her hair gently while Derek tried not to laugh at the sight.
"Where is your snake?" Merry asked her. Harry eyed both cats again and let Beetlejuice come out of her blouse.
Harriet was only 5 years old and still had a hard time walking and talking. She mostly just mumbled and stumbled her way through life.
"No don't worry its fine, let's go," He tapped the weird stone griffin with his wand a few times and whispered 'Lemon drops'. Well for Flint, it wasn't really whispering, it was more like low, deep talking. He walked her up, she tried not to blush with him in front of her. He knocked on a door, the door opened by itself. They walked in, with Flint in front and Harriet hiding behind him. The office was very bog and filled with knick-knacks which Harriet may or may not wanted to play with. There was a bird off to the side by a big wooden desk, she walked towards it to get a closer look at it.
"Ms. Potter!" He said abruptly, trying to make her jump but she didn't. "What would you get if you add powdered root of asphodel and infusion of wormwood?" He sneered. She could see out of the corner of her eye that Hermione raised her hand way up in the air and practically stood. Snape ignored her and just looked at Harriet waiting for an answer.
"Not that I know of, but if you don't come back I'm sure one of your friends will grab your stuff," He smiled. Harriet gave Merry one last nervous look before she left.
"Wait!" Draco shouted which made everyone turn to him when Merry started to climb up the girls' stairs. "Us boys can't go up with you or the stairs will collapse." The boys all frowned in sadness and frustration.
"I heard that you don't feel well?" Riley set his box down and opened it up, it was filled with potions and other muggle supplies like bandages.
"This is a key that will fit into all of your vaults and no one else can use it except you and the keys are now erased," The goblin pulled out another parchment.
"What were you afraid that a tsunami of toads would come?" Harry giggled, she knew how to control the spell to only make the wanted item to come to her not all of the items that are named what she wished. The other girl just pressed her lips together.
"Oh my fucking goodness! You actually did that!" She fell next to Harriet, laying her head on her shoulder crying from laughter. Her teammates landed and clapped. Flint grabbed her open hand and yanked her up in one go.
"We just got a new series of mystery novels this morning," Ms. Haack said excitedly as she held up three books. Harry gasped as she examined the book covers. Ms. Haack gave the books to her to look at. Harry slowly grabbed one of them and turned to the back to read the summary.
"Should we go get books?" Merry asked while putting her bags and kittens stuff in her trunk. Harry did the same with her bags.
"History of Magic," They turned a left turn into a group of older boys. Harriet let a little squeak escape her mouth. "Sorry!" She turned her head to the ground and started to step aside for them.
"Yep," Harriet popped the p and turned back to her notes. She pulled out her book and turned to the first page. The pages were filled to the brim with annotations and little fun facts. Also, there were a few little doodles which always made Harriet smile. Mr. Feose would doodle in her book when she was trying to study.
"I have insomnia so I can drink this and sleep for only 10 minutes and get 10 hours of sleep," Harry explained and downed the potion. It tastes like water but slightly orange. Mr. Feose always makes sure that the potions she takes never tastes bad. Merry slowly took the potion still weary. They climbed into the bed and quickly feel asleep. Harry slept for 10 minutes while Merry slept for 12. Harry woke up stretching, feeling completely refreshed. Merry woke up the same way and looked over at her.
It hadn't occurred to the boy that Remus would find out about the previous night in such a manner, and it dawned on him how horrific it would seem to any other person. He had essentially committed an atrocity. With a shaking voice, the older man spoke.
Her finger tips tingled as she proofread her letter and folded it to fit into an envelope. She sat for a moment, contemplating her next actions. She feared being caught if she responded immediately, and didn't want Dumbledore to investigate her attempting to be stealthy. What to do?
It's interior was similar to that of a 40's American diner, with cushy red leather booths, and chrome accents. Everything was colourful and had character. There were a few patrons also enjoying their first meal of the day, a family of four, an elderly couple, and the busker that inspired Harry the other day. He spent the short while simply absorbing his surroundings.
Harry froze up a little, his nerves were on alert. He tried to maintain his friendly exterior. "I just, found her one day. We kind of became friends somehow."
He felt as if his chest were being crushed underneath the weight of a car. The pain was sharp and dull at the same time, his chest cavity felt like a vacuum; a cold, empty sensation permeated his body. The grass beneath his knees seemed to sag from his weight, nearly giving way to dark cavernous depths. He felt all alone again.
Harry froze and stared at Lupin, sniffling, tears still flowing. "What do you mean? How do you know?"
Minerva couldn't stand the tension anymore, hastily placing her quill into its inkpot and grabbed the letter. She grasped it in both her hands, the envelope creased and deformed in grip. The edges of the letter quivered as her hands shook, her heart pounded thunderously in her aching chest. The elderly witch drew in an unsteady breath, steeling her nerves, before she slipped her right index finger beneath the fold of the yellowed envelope. She dragged her finger along the edge, tearing the paper and allowing access to its contents.
"Oh, thank you." Harry cautiously took the plate, noticing that the food was only somewhat warm now. Remus walked toward the front of the flat, grabbing his guitar case along the way.
The masked child was taken aback. He thought for a second before replying, "I'm afraid I've forgotten."
It was very sparsely decorated. A couple of picture frames hung from the walls, curiously they all seemed to be animatedly moving. From his position on the couch he wasn't able to see who the subject of these moving photographs was. Across from the couch sat a small television set. Next to Harry sat the remote, which he picked up and pressed the power button. With a click the television came to life with a news broadcast; said broadcast covered Harry's escapade from the previous night.
It was settled. The moment that aggression prone pile of lard made his move, Harry and Delphi were gone.
"Re- Remus?" Her voice trembled, she was confused. What urgent message could an old student possibly have for her? She quickly unfolded it, anxious to read the news.
"Hello! How are you today, young man?" Hid voice was kind, and possessed a wizened eccentric energy.
Throughout the exchange the newly revealed witch watched with suprise and a hint of horror. Harry was a parselmouth?
Nary an inch of his skin wasn't covered in a shade of red, purple, blue, or yellow. The only sign that he had a shred of life in him were the shallow breaths he tried to take, his lungs wouldn't inhale. He felt like he was suffocating. Like his lungs were full, but he needed more air, he couldn't exhale. Suddenly, his ability to breathe returned to him, like having a heavy boot step off his ribs.
A few weeks had passed, and Harry was busy washing dishes in the early afternoon. He'd been practicing his magic as much as he could, every solitary moment he had outside of his cupboard. Strangely (or not) he found himself with more time alone (with the obvious exception of Delphinium, whom he'd taken to occasionally calling Delphi) since Dudley hadn't gained back the nerve to provoke him. Regardless, progress was slow and tedious. He had much less trouble accessing his magic now, though he still struggled slightly. The most pertinent issue was controlling the flow, and getting it to behave as he wished. Which currently meant using his magic to move objects in whatever way he wanted.
The complex wasn't extremely large for a prison, but it was definitely a considerable amount of ground to cover for a ten year old boy. He would have to infiltrate administration first, which he assumed would be nearby to the prisons main entrance.
"You see, I had noticed you'd visited the boy during a lesson, again. I decided to shadow you." The edges of his eyes wrinkled as they narrowed. The witch's heart stopped. She was afraid to speak, she felt the blood drain from her face. He continued to speak.
"You're welcome." Remus shut the door and waited quietly beside it, hearing the rustling of paper through the wood paneling. His mind wandered to what he'd discovered that morning. Images of the edited and blurred viscera flashed across his eyes. The wolf leaned against the wall as the toilet flushed. His chest felt tight, he pressed a hand to his mouth. What had Harry become?
"A mother's love? What has that to do with anything? Are you talking about your baseless hypothesis, in which Lily Potter miraculously protected her son from the killing curse (post mortem) using love? That, is why you insist on him staying in that dangerous environment?"
"Yes please." Harry relaxed against the back cushion of the couch. His eyes ached at the sunlight coming in through the curtains windows. The aching wasn't anything he couldn't handle though, so he looked around the room.
It was the serpents turn to be suprised, him give her a name? Some emotion rose in her body, like she was happy to have been offered this thing she'd never had. Nor knew that she had wanted, at some low, unconscious level.
Soon he walked out of the restaurant, his belly felt awkward and bloated. Though he was satisfied and happy. In his hand he clutched a plastic bag, which contained his food.
The man allowed him access to very intimate affairs within the muggle community of Great Britain. Access to news all over the country, an ear to the door of all government operations.
He was too exhausted and anguished to cry anymore, or move. Everything hurt too much. He just laid there for the rest of the night, and much of the next morning. To him, nothing could cause him more pain than he had just experienced. He had much to experience.
"I want a list of their Identification and cell numbers, every one you can manage." Harry demanded, Bernard rushed into the backroom, visibly sweating and shaking. Harry watched him hurry to a desk, on which sat a bulky desktop computer.
"Little... Slut!" Vernon managed to choke out before he felt immense pressure on his groin. He groaned aggressively as he felt his genitals be eviscerated. Next his hands were torn from his throat and forced against the walls in a T-pose. Out of the corner of his eye he watched his hands compress until bones splintered, and the flesh popped open, finally splattering like fleshy cysts.
"Grading assignment, planning lessons. My normal duties, what else?" Her face maintained its stern, gentle look. Except her eyes glinted with an air of innocence.It wasn't exactly a lie, those were things she needed to tend to. But it was a lie in that, those weren't things she planned to do tonight. What she really planned to do was plan her schedule for teaching Harry in secret, regardless of whether or not she or anyone else was granted permission to train him.
"She's an older woman, but much younger looking than me, I assure you. Wears glasses, very pretty face. Sharp features. Grace of a cat I'd say, when she walks." He talked about her as if she were a good friend. At the mention of cat-like grace, Harry almost tensed up. He had to remain calm, and not express anything that could tell the man he knew the woman he spoke of.
"Lookin fer these?" The fat one held something in Harry's face. His glasses. He made a weak attempt to swipe them away, but they were pulled out of his reach too quickly for him to register at the moment.
Harry smirked beneath his mask, with a wave of his hand he flung the two aside into a wall. The collision knocked them unconscious. They both more than likely had either a concussion or broken bones, so they were incapacitated. As he walked past them he confiscated their weapons, he twisted them apart with his magic. Useless pieces of steel and plastic clattered to the floor.
Harry was so absorbed in learning about his achievements that he hasn't noticed Remus returning from the kitchen. Harry was slightly startled when he saw Lupin standing beside the couch, plate of food in hand. His expression was that of horror, which deepened when a footage of Harry running down the halls. The costume was easily identifiable as the one he had found Harry wearing.
Hello! I'm very happy to see this story getting some love! I appreciate those of you who are sticking around to read it through to the end. Some of you have been wondering why Albus is such a dust bin of a human being in this story, and I'm sorry to say that won't be revealed for a considerable length of time! But, I will say why I've decided to write him as such. I wanted to make him more of an antagonist, instead of the ambiguous force for good that he was in the original IP. Sadly, he will not be a "for the greater good" kind of character.
"You could call it that, mister." Said Harry, trying his best to not let his distrust leak into his tone. He looked up toward the sky, he wanted to explore as much as possible before he had to return to Delphi.
Dudley's droogs chuckled at the jest. Harry's readyness to run was all that kept him from rolling his eyes in such a way that if they were bowling balls they would surely get him a strike. That is to say, he was extremely unimpressed. He was also extremely fucking scared. Harry saw the other boys very obviously begin shift their weight to begin the impending chase. Harry took off as if he'd just heard a starting pistol, and he was going for gold. Except in this case, gold simply meant escaping his tormentors relatively unharmed.
They stared into each other's eyes for a moment. The prisoner knew Harry wanted something, but felt himself unable to speak. There was something foreboding about the raven, a vengeful aura emanated off of his heavy black cloak. Time seemed to slow for the both of them, as Harry lifted his hand and flicked his wrist.
Harry darted around the corner of the house, and saw his chance. There was an ivy riddled lattice fence on the side of the house, there was no way the larger boys could follow him up, he would be safe on the roof. Sadly, he would never have the chance to take the roof as a haven. He was weak and small, this made it hard to climb. Dudley and his gang had enough time to reach the lattice before Harry could reach the top. Too bad Ol' Dudders had a wad of fat in place of his brain, as he bagan to try and follow his cousin. A bad move on his part, as he was only a few feet up (shaking the lattice quite a bit as he got there, making Harry's own climb all the more difficult) when the whole structure began to tilt away from the house. Dudley's fall was so small his rotund form managed to land on it's feet. Harry was not so fortunate.
"Yes. You can see where the issue lies. This is quite serious, Minerva. The consequences for this could potentially be extreme." A glint in his cunning, steely eyes told her he had more to say.
The older male's genital area erupted into flames. He attempted to writhe and scream as fire incinerated the clothing covering that area and made it's way to the sensitive organs held therein. Harry felt an indescribable sense of euphoria as he watched the man in agony, flesh bubbled and seared as it burned into organic slag. He felt momentarily tempted to release his grip on Charles' throat, just to hear him wail and scream. He held onto his resolve though, not wanting to risk any attention from anyone who could be walking down the street.
But his magic was not his current focus, and neither was the shrinking pile of greasy crumb covered porceline plates in the sink. No, Harry was focused on the feline observer he had on the edge of his vision, outside the window and sitting on the wall. The animal had been there since a few days after Harry and Delphinium's official allignment. It was a peculiar cat too, as he'd thought he saw white goggle like markings around the eyes the few times he'd let it come into center view. He wanted to maintain the illusion that he was unaware of his beastial stalker.
The bespectacled woman didn't know how to respond, she couldn't exactly rebuke his words without displaying desperation. She huffed quietly, and crossed her arms loosely. Her posture verges on defeated. She closed her eyes and mulled over what had just happened. Perhaps this should be taken as a small victory? This thought crossed her mind before she opened her eyes to see Albus patiently staring at her, subtle, yet victorious smile just barely visible beneath his long grey facial hair.
Shots of the destroyed cell block panned across the screen, and clips of interviews with officers and other staff intermittently interrupted confused takes of the carnage. Censored pictures of injured officers and the bodies of Harry's various fatalities popped up. In the corner, a kill count hovered. It was separated into multiple categories: prisoner fatalities, officer fatalities, prisoner casualties, and officer casualties.
I am here, my fated return! Sorry for the long break, I was in a deeper rut than I realised. But now, I'm back to writing this fic, and hoping everyone enjoys it! But I will give a warning, updates may be infrequent. Though I will do my best to have a net chapter out at least once every two weeks. So, happy reading!
Harry stared at the list in his leather gloved hands, each of the few dozen felons was listed in cell order. He would be able to do this quickly, and efficiently. He had to anyway, if he wanted to get out of here. He had no doubt that there were more entrances somewhere else along the block.
It took Harry 10 minutes to eat just a few bites. An abnormal feeling began to creep into his head, like a fog obscuring his thoughts. Something was wrong, each breath felt thick. His eyes rolled slowly in their sockets. He slowly became more sluggish and laboured. The world dissolved before him as unknowingness consumed him.
Remus seemed to shrink a little. "I understand, Harry. I don't want to push it, but I hope you can come to let me in some day." He started walking toward Harry, who flinched. "Relax, I just wanted to give you food."
He took a deep breath, and quickly came to regret that decision. The raven's ribs exploded with pain, groaning with pain, he clutched his chest. Another mistake, every movement felt like being struck with a brick. Wherever his skin came into contact with (or worse, had pressure placed on it), sent screaming pangs of agony through him. Tears streamed from his eyes, and it took all of his effort not to vocalize his suffering. Just as much strain was exerted to not begin hyperventilating, and risk even more pain.
He held up his hand again, and snapped. The homeless man's left leg spasmed as a muffled cracking sound emitted from said limb, Harry had just broken his femur. He slowly repeated the process with each major bone in all four limbs. At one point Charles lost consciousness, Harry jolted him awake by bumping the man against the wall, only enough to hurt. The man groaned intensely as his injuries were agitated.
"I'll be back in a second. Get to it" with that, Harry walked to the front of the office. He caught the employees attempting to remove the desks from the door.
He was pulled from his thoughts by his being placed on the worn couch in the living room. He looked up Remus sighed and flopped onto the couch beside the boy. The worn leather sagged under the wolf's weight, and the floor creaked strenuously beneath them.
A few people murmured before digging into their purses and wallets, offering a few bills and coins of various values. Harry took these and pocketed them, thanking each donor profusely. He continued to perform magic, each time his gathering increased in size, until an hour later, he had a crowd of 20 people gathered around the street corner.
"Depends, what does your friend look like?" Harry did his best to maintain his image of childlike ignorance.
He broke into a sprint to his first cell, running out of the prisoners reach. They were rioting in their cells, asking who Harry was, and what was happening. Some made ineffectual threats. All of them were standing pressed against the bars. He soon came upon his target, he didn't bother to read the name. He only cared about the prisoner ID, which was displayed both across the back and front of the prisoners uniform.
"There's more to your visit than relaying your discovery of my transgression, isn't there?" McGonagal asked.
Her tone was wary, almost urgent. Harry didn't answer, he didn't want to risk the stranger hearing him. He almost jumped when the aged man spoke to him.
Said Harry as he sat on the last step in front of the door. Anxiously, he combed his hand through his messy hair to calm his nerves.
The small child clenched his jaw as stabbing pain rippled through him, he sat against the wall of his cupboard waiting for the snake to strike or do anything. He closed his eyes tight, waiting for his reptilian visitor to make it's move. A moment passed before he cracked his eye open, to see the snake poised before him in a rather non-threatening stance. Or as non-threatening as a snake could display for a visually impaired four year old.
The same fog clouded his consciousness as he regained it. Harry was only cognizant enough to realise that he was no longer in his cupboard. The walls of this new location were covered completely in white plastic sheeting. The raven attempted to push himself into a sitting position, only to find his hands bound behind his back. There was only enough clearance for him to lie flat. His feet and legs were bound together also, only enough for him to spread his knees a bit wider than his shoulders. Harry shuddered, he noticed that he was not currently clothed. Everything laid bare.
Harry lazily waved his hand, knocking her blade from her hands. He limped slowly past her now cowering form, to the front room. As he passed he glared at Dudley, who seemed about to yell at him. His words never left his mouth as he caught Harry's eyes.
Harry and the serpent traveled until they couldn't that night, taking care to stay off of main roads, and remaining in the shadows. The young wizard knew Petunia would call the police, he heard sirens soon after he made his escape. He traveled as fast as he could, but both Delphi and his violated rear end made swiftness impossible. He couldn't keep track of where or how long he was traveling, every second felt like an eternity. His body was all but numb, which made it easier for him to endure the endless trek.
The open window behind Dumbledore let air gently circulate through his office. The currents so gentle they didn't perturb the flame of the candle fully illuminating the parchment before him, until suddenly a gust of wind sent the flame sputtering slightly more. The old man listened intently, the flapping of wings told him of an incoming message.
Harry felt the numbness fade into a smoldering hot ball in his chest as he watched Vernon sit there in his ecstasy, covered and sweat, slouching lazily whilst sitting on the floor. Harry's emerald eyes squinted and twitched with fury and shame, magic flooded through his veins like a tsunami.
Two weeks and three days later, Harry sat in his cupboard, boredly awaiting his meal for the day. The night was setting in, and all of his chores had been done. No reason for him to be allowed to wander or entertain himself. He heard the telltale clicking of the lock, Vernon dropped a tray of food in front of Harry, spilling some of the food onto the tray. Some water splashed from the cup.
His torso was especially tender, which was unfortunately the place that Delphi preferred to take up residence. This made her annoyed, not with Harry, but with his "guardians."
"I'm going to do everything I can to remove you from that environment, you hear me? I promise," She told him, her voice filled with determination.
Most of it was older architecture, cobblestone streets, old sidewalks, slanted and uneven buildings. Elements of newer structures were patched in, and became denser in certain areas. He assumed that this was because of those areas proximity to more major and densely populated cities.
"No! Please, Uncle, please!" Harry cried. "Wai-" He choked as Vernon pressed his palm to Harry's throat, while holding his jaw in place. Harry tried to turn away, poinlessly, while Vernon taped his mouth closed.
His breath hitched in his throat, the bittersweet taste of whatever Vernon drugged him with coated his palette as a memory. Tentatively he took a sip, swishing it across his tongue, searching for any abnormal flavours. He found that it tasted like water, nothing to it other than the sweet minerality of filtered hydration.
He became a little too absorbed in his thoughts as he came upon the entrance to what he thought was his alley. He only barely realised anything was different until he tripped over a pile of trash that hadn't been there before. He fell clumsily over it.
Minerva McGonagal had just returned to Hogwarts after another session with Harry, it had been a few weeks since their encounter in which she discovered his injuries, he was doing much better mentally. Though it was obvious the event would have lasting effects on his mental state. He seemed more anxious and wary than before.
Harry flinched, startled. Had the snake just spoken? No, it couldn't have. Dudley must have addled his brain so horribly as to cause auditory halucinations. These thoughts ran through his head, albeit, in words more fitting of a small child's vernacular.
McGonagal sat at her desk, grading essays she had received that day. Two stacks sat on either side of the heavy dark oak surface, each about nine centimeters in height. One ungraded, the other graded; between them sat the essay she was currently grading. She glanced at the unopened envelope at the edge of her desk.
The man looked sad for a moment, before a small smile returned to his scarred face. "Needed something to occupy myself with while on the road. Besides, some songs remind me of old friends."
The small crew of boys stopped several feet from where Harry was in the garden. His thin body tensed, he knew he was a moment from danger, he was fully prepared to begin sprinting for his life.
"Please place your hand on mine, make sure it stays still, no funny business!" The man made a sound of affirmation to Harry's command, and complied. Under his breath, Harry muttered a transfiguration spell.
Harry walked up to her and crouched down, offering his arm for her to climb on. She made her way up the limb and made his shoulders her resting place. They felt something pass between them, The Raven shivered. He wasn't sure what had happened, but a deal had been made between them. Something deeper than a simple allignment.
Remus expression changed to that of deep sadness, his forehead wrinkled, brows furrowing, and his mouth formed into a frown. "Unfortunately you're wrong there, Harry. I know exactly what that is like. It's horrible, and I have to live with it every single day."
He knew full well that he couldn't simply break into a prison wearing his street clothes, or show his face. Especially considering he was definitely a wanted person. He'd murdered his uncle after all. Harry remembered a shop that sold costumes a few blocks away. He would gather what he needed from there.
He stalked the aisles and the racks of clothes, examining masks and cloaks, etc. After approximately 10 minutes, he found something that he fell in love with.
He yelled again as the object pulled out and slammed back into him roughly. The pain slowly faded with each thrust, until each was just a throb amongst a dull ache. His fear was gone after a few minutes. Replaced by numbers and apathy. Emerald eyes faded and glazed, unseeing, though there was nothing wrong with them. He could hear Vernon huffing heavy breaths, pleasure was evident in his gasps and groans. Harry felt meaty palms and fingers roaming his skin, groping his private areas, along with wherever else his uncle could reach.
She swiftly slithered off in search of a weakness for him to exploit. Harry sat in wait for a short while, at least 15 minutes. When the serpent returned, Harry felt like she bore bad news.
Images of what he'd done to Vernon plagued him. His bruised throat. Mangled hands, a bloody pulp, with irregular bone fragments spread throughout, tendons twitching and pulling at nonexistent digits. Eviscerated and emasculated crotch. Bloody pulsating intestines spilling onto the cold, dirty concrete. The adipose tissue around it a dirty yellow, a myriad of clumps and bulbs. So much blood flowed slowly across the grey and brown floor of the dank basement.
Twenty minutes had elapsed since Harry and Delphinium began their search for every weed they could possibly find, when Delphi sensed a new presence. Something unsettling. She alerted Harry of this disturbance, something on the air. A vaguely malignant magic lingered nearby.
"I can still try to understand, Harry. It's not the same, I didn't go through what you may have, but I can relate to other things."  Remus started to stand. "Please, let me in?"
He looked over, an expectant expression on his face. A moment later, McGonagal appeared from down the way. He walked toward the fence, noticing her troubled expression as they approached each other.
They worked together for Harry to get into the scarred man's arms without causing much further pain for the former. They made their way to the living room of the flat, where Lupin shakily placed Harry onto an old and worn leather sofa. It wasn't a very comfortable piece of furniture, the cushions were worn and sagging from age along with use over time. Though, the leather was worn and supple in a comfortable way, preventing it from sticking to Harry's skin.
He couldn't tell how long Vernon continued to hump and grope him, but eventually he slowed down, his breathing becoming more laboured. Harry breathed in sharply as he felt something warm and slick ooze into his belly. Vernon stopped his motions and one else behind the child breathing heavily. Harry felt relieved as he felt Vernon's member slip out of him. He watched as Vernon trudge off to the side and sit down, his penis half erect and covered in thick fluids, including blood.
He decided to not stray from the older areas, hoping to avoid being spotted by police. He couldn't hope to escape being pursued by cops, especially if they had vehicles.
He looked over at what had hit him, a small steel bucket. His eyes quickly flicked over to the origin of the vessel as an angry voice began to berate him.
The raven's body stiffened to stone when the plastic that lined the wall rustled to his left. Vernon shuffled in through the curtains, he himself was also naked. His round, flabby body flustered in the dim light above them. The plastic crinkled beneath his feet as he walked toward Harry saying, "So you're finally awake, mongrel."
He never got an answer, as Harry quickly turned and ran to his next cell. He got very much the same reaction with each encounter. It was almost monotonous, running from cell to cell beheading those who ever dared touch a child sexually. He did this all while terribly aware of how many seconds closer he got to the resident police force storming the cell block.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw a familiar tabby cat loitering by the fence gate. Deep green eyes scanned around, searching for his tormentors before approaching the cat, and following her. She kept looking back toward him, her large eyes conveyed a deep sense of curiosity. This was most likely directed at Harry's languished pace.
Remus sighed and rubbed his face with his hand. He hasn't been able to buy that recently, money was tight, he'd barely had the money to pay his bills and some groceries. He muttered under his breath to himself.
"Coming!" Came a tired sounding response, followed by a hurried shuffling to the door. The brown haired head of Lupin poked through, his face tired and slightly flustered. "Yes?"
"I think so." Harry slowly began to eat the food. It wasn't much, some cheap pork sausages from the local deli and a bowl of microwave oatmeal. A few minutes into his breakfast he realised an issue: how would he use the toilet with his injury?
Harry didn't know what to think. Possibilities upon possibilities swarmed through his head like angry hornets. He could go anywhere? Do anything? He had been with the Dursleys his entire life, this house was all he knew. These people, they gave him everything he had. Not that he was grateful, they took almost as much from him as they gave. They couldn't even be bothered to feed him enough, he was wire thin compared to Dudley, who seemed to get rounder and larger every week. Leaving. It would mean freedom. Absolute freedom.
Harry jumped as a cold substance dripped down his backside, and began struggling intensely as he felt fingers prodding at his anus, slithering the orifice with the cold slippery fluid. Tension and fear continued to mount. Another strike to his head made him sit still.
There stood Vernon, still as a stone. Somehow his flabby lard bloated body seemed stiff and tight to the core. The fear and shock of having been caught shook Harry to his core, breaking his connection to his magic. The plate shattered on the floor.
Harrys thoughts continued for a moment, each question spawing more like beheading a hydra made of queries. He realized that, despite her limited knowledge and lack of valuable terminology, what little she could provide was however invaluable at the moment. She could prove to be a valuable ally for the time being.
"Sir, you! Please, let me amaze you with a magic trick! You won't regret it!" Harry flashed a smile, and flourished his arms dramatically.
Harry glared at Lupin, feeling indignant and angry. "You have no idea what I've been through! What it's like to go through what those men have done! They deserved to die!"
Terrified green eyes widened to the size of saucers as his uncle raised the belt above his head, muscles tight beneath the fat. Harry almost didn't see the belt come down upon him. On impulse he raise his arm, feeling the momentary pressure of the leather strap before it burst into searing pain that streaked over the surface of his forearm. Harry cried out in pain and clutched his arm to his chest.
"How could you understand? You don't know what it's like; to be hated for what you are, to be misunderstood, to be used... abandoned." Harry continued to cry, he didn't mean to open up so much. The stress of everything was finally breaking him.
"Forgive me, Headmaster, if I'm not one of the ministry's drones who will believe your prattling based purely on your authority."
Albus' smile twitched quickly into a frown, but resumed a confident and subtle smile. He placed the model broom back on her desk, taking the time to position it as it had been before. It irked her that he touched her belongings so lackadaisically; He thought he had her against the proverbial ropes.
Delphi did as she was told, as she descended Harry returned her to full size with a whisper. Bernard yelped as the huge snake approached him, cowering further as she bound the man in her scaly and muscular body. Harry walked briskly toward the records associate. Harry did his best to disguise his voice.
"Who the bloody hell?.." the man stopped and stared when he saw Harry, taking time to let his eyes roam over Harry's loose fitting clothes. The boys shirt was hanging off his shoulder, exposing part of his chest. The vagrant also noticed Harry's lack of shoes. A familiar expression formed within his eyes. Harry felt the hairs on his body stand on end.
The began to lose confidence in her assumption when he stopped a few feet from her perch, and stared at her. His face etched with a quizzical look. After a moment he spoke.
He turned to face the main entrance. Further ahead there was another officer, asleep at his post in a small cubicle where the controls for the gate were located. He didn't want to bother attempting to figure out what opened the doors, he would be attracting attention either way. He just needed to be rid of the guard in the booth. The masked child flicked his finger in at the man, launching him at the wall, putting him out of commission.
The bright red lettering that read "URGENT" filled her with dread. The alarm caused by the note wasn't something she needed, as Harry Potter had been missing for two weeks. The anxiety surrounding his disappearance had burst a vein in her eye, a rosey red splotch bordered the iris of her right eye. Her every nerve urged her to tell everyone around her of the news, but everything was being kept quiet. Dumbledore threatened her job when she had objected to the secrecy, it had become a habit of his, to threaten her at the slightest sign of rebellion. Slander, imprisonment, death. All sorts of things she couldn't risk him going through with.
The man picked up the cigar and inspected it. It seemed quality, and smelled fresh, and hadn't even been trimmed yet. The tobacco leaf was completely intact.
When he awoke it was very early afternoon, and the street was as empty as it had been since he woke up. He decided to wander the streets again that day, exploring stores and loitering about. He considered buying himself a new outfit to replace his tattered and oversized hand-me-downs.
"Maybe I should help you on your way, boy." He said, barely bothering to even try hiding his malevolent intentions. He started moving toward
Soon, Delphinium slithered through her port hole in the wall. Her alarm and fear was almost palpable, her aura impressed that upon him without words or expressions.
The man seemed to struggle more as Harry flattened and smoothed the papers, making him more curious. Harry couldn't have been prepared for what the sheets revealed. They were physical documentation of the man's sinister past, horrible acts performed by one Charles Crocker. Harry learned some new words, such as sex offender, child molester, and sexual assault. Now he knew what to call what happened to him.
"Your concern seems so great, I may as well involve myself. I still have yet to decide if removing him from the Dursleys' care is paramount to his survival." Dumbledore said this in an almost mocking tone.
Harry thought for a moment, he'd never had the chance to name anything before. Really he never learned many names, only those of The Dursleys and the various plants he tended to on the daily. Petunia had taught him some of the scientific labels of some of the garden plants. He supposed that he would have to use one of those.
Five days later Harry was mostly healed, though his ribs still ached slightly and the back of his skull throbbed dully. Despite having generally recovered, the snake had never left him; nor had it lost her ability to speak. He found out her sex when she'd mentioned wanting to mother many offspring, she was insistent on the existence of magic and their ability to actually communicate. So she spoke at almost every opportunity in an effort to convince him.
"It's my job to know your name. Though, just about everyone in the wizarding world knows your name. You're famous after all."
Harry shook his head a bit, prompting a questioning look from the man carrying him. The glassy, green eyed child didn't want to allow himself to sympathize with Remus. He couldn't risk it. So much could go wrong.
Harry made his retort, adamant that what was happening was merely the result of nearly having his skull split by his fat cousin plus his brain dead friends.
Harry had no clue how much time had passed. At least an hour, but likely more. He started to feel an ache in his chest that wasn't from physical injury. This ache was emotional. He was alone. Unwanted. A freak. A mangy dog, needing to be beaten away. He felt as if he should die.
came a hissing sound from the boy's torso. Delphinium had taken to wrapping herself around Harry's stomach and chest when they weren't either outdoors or in his cupboard. It served to be a good hiding place for her, as Harry's malnourished frame and extremely loose clothing left plenty of room for her to lie almost unnoticable. She made him look almost like a healthy child wearing oversized clothes.
And with that, she was gone. A cracking noise went off like a silenced pistol. Which was loud, but not so much as to alert the entire neighbourhood. Harry was left with one question among the others that had spiralled into his head.
She would ignore the depressing new information for now. Her current goal was to allign herself with him, to take advantage of this rare and awesome opportunity. With the boy on her side, she would live long and possibly raise many a clutch.
He quickly changed into it, and set out, electing to carry Delphi upon His shoulders after realising the reducto charm would make her small enough to be easily shouldered for long periods of time. His destination: The Thornwell Mid Level Security Prison.
His heart was pounding, a mix of terror and exhilaration filled his body. There were less footsteps behind him now, they didn't know where he was yet. As he ran, he spotted a camera in the corner of a hall. He was sure to be located within a minute. The raven soon came upon his destination, only to find the door locked. Not a problem for him.
He stepped deftly through the rubble, and ran off toward the cell blocks. Eventually he came up to the barred door that separated it from the rest of the facility. He heard more footsteps gaining down the hall behind him. He quickly unlocked the door, and slammed it behind him, willing the locking mechanism to twist until it would remain locked, but inoperable via it's respective key.
Mcgonagall stared at Albus Dumbledore, incredulity showed plainly on her face. The moment she reappeared at Hogwarts she'd virtually attacked him in his office with inquiries on what he planned to do, along with a much more concerned and furious version of "I told you so." She knew for a fact that putting Harry in that environment would result in his being abused. The only part she was wrong about was the level that the abuse would be at, which was to say, much worse than she'd ever imagined. She hadn't known sooner because, well, you can only discern so much information on a child's situation from afar.
"Alohomora!" He said, as he grabbed the handle. The door was slightly heavy, made entirely of steel. Entering and closing the door behind him, he looked around for something to blockade the door with. There were several desks that he tossed against the door in a pile.
As Mcgonagall appeared back in her office one day after a visit with Harry, she found she had an unexpected (and wholly unwanted) visitor there. Albus stood in front of her dark wooden desk, inspecting the items that lay atop it. A small collection of books and nicknacks organized pleasantly about the surface, framing  her workspace where papers were carefully spread about.
Harry was thrown onto his back again, barely registering his ribs shifting again. His ears rang, he swore he could hear laughter too. He tried to look for his assailant, he noticed his vision was blurry. The familiar pressure of his glasses was gone from the bridge of his nose. A large shape appeard in his faulty sight. Dudley. The motherfucker. Harry felt new pressure on one of his legs, it quickly became painful.
“No one walked away from Voldemort,” Draco agreed, staring into the fire. “Even the memory of him haunts. Couldn’t truly escape or walk away. No one walked away, not then, not now. Except you.”
Draco ruddy Malfoy reappearing to snatch Harry’s attention after all this time… something was going to go wrong, Harry could practically taste it.
Draco pointed to little dot of a sea-cave off the western coast. Innes and his boss exchanged a long look, and a nod, before the head disappeared without a word, the flames orange and normal once more.
After a long squeeze in greeting on his shoulder, Ron cleared his throat and eyed Harry with something akin to nervousness.
“Who called it in? There’s your answer, boy,” Innes said through gritted teeth, wand sure and steady and pointing at the chest of Draco Malfoy.
So Potter kissing him, gentle and soft, fingers feather light on the back of Draco’s neck, was far from unwelcome. Draco sighed into it, let himself enjoy it, stepped closer and slid his arms around Potter’s trim waist.
But no. No. There was no way a shag was worth the undoubtedly ensuing drama, not even with stupidly attractive Potter.
“If I can be of any help,” Draco murmured, feeling bad for him, weirdly. “Let me know. The sooner you find him, the sooner you’re out of my village. So, you know, I’m hoping you find him quick.”
They were interrupted by the arrival of their food – more scotch, and a plate of haggis, neeps and tatties for Innes, who tucked into it with such gusto that Harry tried not to stare. He instead took a long sip of his own scotch and speared a green bean absently with his fork. His salmon looked temptingly well-cooked, but he wanted to finish processing what he was thinking out loud before he got too distracted by his food, or his throbbing head.
villages you’re keeping me locked up in any longer! Do you know how hard it is to get a Chilean red wine here?”
“No,” Potter agreed. “I don’t want to drink without eating, though. And I’m shattered, I need the energy.”
Harry showed her a photograph of Yaxley anyway, the man scowling up at them insolently from under dirty, scruffy hair. She gathered her children to look; they pronounced the man to be ugly and a poo-face, but insisted they hadn’t seen him.
“Hey, Draco.” Potter said, laying aside his files and settling back in his armchair, looking completely at ease.
Harry headed up the stairs, rolling his eyes again. He left Innes’s bag on the bed of the room that looked over green but rocky landscape to the east, and claimed the better room for himself, which had a view of the little village lane below as it ran all the way down to the raging sea.
“Oh for fuck’s sake, Draco! Innes could be in trouble!” Harry didn’t know how to feel. Fury, fear and betrayal all circled each other in his stomach, as he struggled to stand.
Whatever the weird tug of a feeling had been within Draco, it had quickly been chased away by suspicion over the presence of the Aurors, and anger that Potter’s partner had denounced Draco in front of the whole village, no doubt damaging the respectable name he’d worked so hard to make for himself the past few years. It was grating. Draco worked his ass off for his village and the neighbouring communities, and then some stranger comes charging into
The door to the inn opened then and in the next instant Innes, who had been facing it, was on his feet and pulling out his wand. Harry leaped up to mimic him out of instinct, upending the table as he did so, his salmon sent flying.
“I guess so,” Potter allowed, as they stopped at Draco’s door. “We always were kind of similar, you and I. It certainly feels good to choose for myself, to dictate on my own terms how my life plays out.”
“Well, I figure since I’m sticking around in the village, we might as well be okay with each other, if nothing else.”
Too scared to look down at Potter, Draco pulled his prone body up onto his lap, and levitated him out the door and over the road to his clinic, not dropping the spell until Potter was on the hospital bed. Then Draco pulled on his Healer robes and gear and bent over the wound.
So of course, he’d wound up here, in this little village on Iona, which had to be the tiniest and most barren island in the world. The new Minister had brought about some sort of legislation that insisted at least one Healer be present in every magical community in Britain. Draco, still a British citizen, had been subsequently dispatched to this village, Adharmuir, when old Mr. Guinne had gotten a krup bite nastily infected with runespoor venom.
Innes scowled so heavily that Harry thought his eyeballs might bulge right out of their sockets, but he went stamping off to finish his rounds all the same.
It was well into the afternoon by the time Draco could at least head home from the water’s edge, his stomach growling from hunger, with sand all through his robes and the scent of blood and antiseptic still stinging his nostrils. He’d cleaned and healed the deep wound to Darragh’s leg easily enough, but it was a frightening thing, a hippocampus so close to the island. He’d quickly fire-called the Department of Magical Creatures from the McIntosh’s cottage to corral the creature safely away.
“How good of him, Mrs. Campbell. And I'm sure he'll be happy to have it, it looks very warm,” Harry smiled over his tea-cup, and took another huge bite of scone.
“You’ve found him?” Draco gasped, even as he hunched over Potter, touched his cold face, his stupid hair, the undamaged skin of his ribs above the bloody wound.
But, it seemed, all was well enough. A disinterested looking bartender barely glanced his way as Harry lowered his wand and looked about. The common room at the Adharmuir Village Arms was well-kept, and he shook the soot off his robes as the fireplace spat out Innes in his wake.
The woman merely shrugged and headed to the door. “All anyone here wants is peace, the doctor included. You and your drunken oaf of a partner downstairs best catch that Yaxley, put him away and be off. Best for everyone.”
“Sorry, hello. You’re one of the Aurors? Healer Malfoy mentioned you were in the village. I’m afraid I haven’t seen any strange men about, and the children would have told me if they had.”
“Malfoy, were my instructions somehow unclear?” Yaxley didn’t move an inch, just ignored Harry entirely, kept his dark eyes fixed on Draco.
Draco chucked the little boy she held in her arms under his chin and was away down the front path before Harry could even wish him good morning. By the time Harry turned back to the door, the woman was staring at him questioningly.
The curse had caught Potter in the side, but the damage wasn’t anything Draco couldn’t heal. Still, his hands shook a little as he prepared the potions to clean the gash, stave off infection, and repair his patient’s body. He applied them far too liberally, one after the other, but it was better to be safe than sorry. Then he dosed Potter with a draught to make sure he slept through the night without waking, and left him to rest and heal.
All this time in the wizarding world and Harry still hated the feeling of floo; the lack of control as he spun and the crippling nausea and dizziness it induced. Not being able to have his full faculties about him when whatever fireplace he was using spat him out at what may or may not be his intended destination…
He’d considered charming his way into Malfoy’s bed. A good, quick fuck might be just the thing to get this developing (returning) obsession out of his system.
“You don’t need to look so worried,” Harry told him, helplessly, as anger took over the other man’s features.
Draco apparated as soon as they were past the boundary stones, taking them to the wet, windswept coastline to north-west. He gestured at one of the rocky, tiny islands out on the water just ahead.
Harry’s boss Gawain Robards laughed as though it was a particularly funny joke when Harry grumbled that he’d rather fly to the Inner Hebrides than use the floo network to get there. Heck, Harry would
“Is it like that for you, being an Auror? Pour yourself into hunting down the bad guys and keeping too busy to let anyone hound you over being the Chosen One and asking for a play-by-play of all your battles against Voldemort.”
But as they sat down together for fish baked in herbs and lemon, paired with a sweet white wine, there was a sense of gratitude between them.
“We’ll go door to door in the morning. Start at the east of the village, work our way west to the coast. Whoever this ruddy anonymous source was, that little shit Malfoy or someone else, we'll turn something up. We
The anticipation, almost a decade worth of it, had Draco’s blood boiling, his voice shaking, and his movements lacked anything even remotely akin to finesse. Potter was just as bad, prepping Draco with trembling fingers, his eyes dark with need as he watched him whimper and wriggle.
!” Draco sneered. “I’m sick of you being here! Can’t you stop wasting time lingering outside doors trying to touch me and just bloody find him?!”
Harry’s voice was so strained that it took Draco’s lust addled brain a few long moments to comprehend what he was saying. By the time he caught on and opened his eyes to watch, Harry’s own eyes were shut in delight, his lips parted around his gasps as his body locked up at the apex of one last thrust.
It was mid-morning before Harry and Innes finally got out onto the street the next day. A fire call to Robards had descended into a three-way yelling match as they’d all vented their frustrations – Harry at Gawain for not warning him about Malfoy’s presence on the island and at Innes for being such a jerk the previous evening; Innes at Gawain for sending him on this mission with the ruddy boy who was ruddy in love with ruddy Malfoy or something (“
“Harry, I’m sorry. I had to. My mum... he said... if I didn’t hide him, he’d send people after my mum! He knew where she lives!”
Having finished his houses before the little strip of shops in the centre of the village, Harry headed into the general store.
Draco was sure Tavish didn’t even like him all that much, so it was kind of nice to know he may be willing to go head to head with an Auror for him.
“I can’t. I swore an oath,” Harry kissed Draco again, even as he reached up to untangled the fingers curled around him, intending it to be goodbye.
“Sure, yes, please,” Potter sighed, gripped his unruly hair in frustration and squeezed, then let go with another sigh.
“I’m not worried about the cleanliness,” was the haughty response. “I’m worried that there’s almost definitely no alcohol.”
It was Rhona who had insisted on anonymously contacting the Aurors. Draco hadn’t even known she’d done it until he’d walked into the pub to two drawn wands and Harry Potter’s stupidly attractive face and tense eyes.
Draco woke on Sunday feeling weirdly disappointed, and wasted half the morning shuffling about accomplishing nothing, unable to focus. The two figures he’d seen leaving the inn bright and early had headed out of the village and were unlikely to be back all day. Pretending it didn’t bother him was draining. But what if they did find Yaxley? Even worse, what if they didn’t?
“Anything of note?” Innes gestured to the file as he dropped into the chair opposite Harry. He never read the case notes if he could avoid it, and usually just made Harry summarise the important bits, citing his own skill and experience as far more useful than anything ever written in ink on parchment.
It was the small hours of the morning, after they’ve napped and showered, when they had clattered back downstairs hand-in-hand.
“Well, he’s been here about two years, since he finished his Mediwizard training in France. The village hasn’t had a healer in a long time, but it’s one of the new reforms, a Healer to every magical community. He showed up one day, settled in, opened up his practice and that’s been that.”
“I won’t apologize,” Draco informed him, even as he guided him up the stairs to the room he’d claimed. “I can’t. I had to get to her, to protect her. I told you and Innes everything I could. But I’m very, very sorry he was killed.”
He took it with a long sigh, steeled himself with a brief few seconds spent remembering Potter, last night, his hands, his mouth...
And that other prick, Potter's partner, clearly hadn’t believed it in the slightest when Draco’s former arch-enemy had protested his innocence. At least Rhona and Isobel, his secretary, and her husband Tavish, had stood up to defend him.
“She saved my life,” Harry’s eyes were gentle as he spoke, his voice low. “She could have given me up, and I’d have been killed immediately in the forest. But she lied, to protect you, so she could get to you, to save you.”
“The island is tiny, and this village is a single lane, with a population of under fifty,” Harry muttered with a shake of his head, not taking his eyes off the flames. This wasn’t enough to go on. He had a sinking feeling that in a few days they would have trawled the island top to bottom, and they still wouldn’t turn Yaxley up. “How do we know the target hasn’t moved on? He surely hasn't been able to stay in the vicinity.”
“Harry,” Innes whacked him a bit too hard about the shoulder to get his attention. “Barkeep here owns the place. Alasdair MacKinnon.”
His room was fine enough – a double bed, a writing desk under the window, an armchair before the fireplace, and a small en-suite bathroom adjoining. Harry tossed his files onto the desk and dropped down into the armchair, rubbing at his aching eyes. Fucking floo. Fucking Innes.
Which was exactly when Draco shouldered his way outside, shaking off a little girl who was clutching at his steel-grey robes. He came to a halt, eyes wide in surprise, with his chest mere millimetres from Harry’s outstretched hand. Harry could feel the warmth from the bare skin of Draco’s throat on the tips of his fingers as it emanated from him.
He was still procrastinating, watching the white waves rolling in the distance, when Draco threw the door open and barrelled straight into Harry’s chest. The slightly taller man yelped and leaped back like he’d been burnt before Harry could even react; his medical bag held out between them as if to ward Harry off.
“Yaxley. He attacked you. Innes brought you back last night, half dead. Didn’t I explicitly tell you to be careful?”
The common room was warm thanks to its roaring fire, a low timber-beamed ceiling and cozy armchairs. Harry settled at the bar next to Innes, pulling a face as he downed his drink. That earned him near-identical scowls from the older men.
Almost a week later, and Draco had managed to bring some semblance of order and tidiness to the house. It wasn’t small by any means, so he and his mother quite happily occupied separate wings and usually only saw each other for meals.
The bang of the door flying open startled Draco so badly that he almost leapt clean off his stool at the pub.
Ron made appearances in the evenings, chipper and chatty, insistently talking about anything other than work.
“Right,” Harry squared his shoulders. “Stay here, I can’t let you come any further. You’re a civilian.”
It would be ready in the next 24 hours, which was good – his client was impatient, and Draco wanted the stress of it off his shoulders. Nothing was worse than customers who expected to be handed a rare concoction immediately, especially those that required a long, slow and careful brew like the
“To bed. Right,” Draco croaked in agreement. “Just... find him, be careful about it and then clear off, thanks. So, adding you to the mix, with your propensity for trouble, is a damn headache that I don’t need. Find him, clear off
“Good day.” Harry launched into his usual spiel of explaining who he was and why he was here, but two young boys barrelling from the house and crawling between his legs to shoot across the lawn brought him up short.
Malfoy. Healer Malfoy is not under suspicion in any way. We’re not here to do anything other than find Yaxley. Healer Malfoy was cleared of all charges five years ago, and as far as I’m concerned that’s the end of the matter.” Harry glowered at Innes as he spoke, who sneered right back at him.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered to Innes’ lifeless form, as he curled his fingers in the fabric of his cold, wet robes. “I’m sorry.”
As they watched, the boys came to halt just before these markers, standing as close as they possibly could without crossing the boundary and turning to smirk at their mother.
It had been ages since Draco had last gotten laid, so he wanted it as frantic and fast as Potter could manage. The sensation – as Harry got the message and pulled out a little to press his knees to the bed for leverage, then set an even more gruelling pace – was incredible.
“I’m an Auror. It’s my job! My partner is out there, alone, and I don’t remember a damn thing about where we were when Yaxley attacked! Draco, there’s a life at stake here! If you knew information all along, why did you keep it from me?!”
From out of the bay window Harry could see that it was now dusk outside, and the single cobbled village lane glowed orange as the street-lamps flared to life. There was what looked to be a general wizarding supply store on the opposite side of the street, with a display of cauldrons and stirring-rods in the window. Next to that was a grey stone building, two-levelled, with a sign over the door Harry couldn’t read, and then what looked to be a grocers. On this side of the road there was an apothecary and a book store on either side of the inn. All the rest of the buildings in the village were houses; quaint, white-washed cottages with thatched rooftops and window boxes bursting with colourful blooms and fragrant herbs.
With that, she turned back toward the stairs and headed down, hoping her role as Harry's teacher wouldn't be cut short.
She tracked down a spell that existed in the restricted section of the Hogwarts library, the "Body Double Spell". It created a corporeal "clone" of sorts that lasted for a specific amount of time based on the caster's proficiency and the complexity or quantity of commands/knowledge. It took Mcgonagall two months in order to make the spell last for an entire lesson whilst also teaching with a limited ability to help outside of the lesson plan. To compensate for the lack of ability to answer all questions a student may have, she told her students that she would be available on weekends and during free time to give extra assistance.
Tears welled up in the corners of his eyes, he felt as if Delphi was the only one he could trust at this point. Was it safe to let anyone else in?
Harry's eyes showed his internal conflict. He felt so alone, he didn't trust Remus, no matter how much he wanted to. Everything in his heart told him that he could only be hurt by allowing the wolf a place in his heart.
Vernon attempted to scream through his restricted airway as a slash appeared along his wrist, very close to his mangled hand. Harry took a few steps forward, hand still pointed at his uncle, his thumb and middle finger tips together. He twisted his hand sharply as he snapped his fingers. A crack sounded through the concrete room, reverberating in a morbidly satisfying way.
Hey guys, I just wanted to give an update to say that this fic is going on hiatus for a while. Hopefully not more than a couple weeks, but we will see. Do not fear though, I wont be abandoning this fic anytime soon. Too many hours of work have gone into it.
He wondered about what he would eat, he had no money. He wanted to avoid begging. What avenues did he have for getting essentials? He contemplated this as he walked along the street. He heard faint music nearby that pulled him from his musings, and drew him in that direction. Turning a corner, he saw the source of the noise: a man playing his guitar. He strummed out covers of popular songs Harry had heard on the radio with the acoustic instrument. In front of him lay an open guitar case, as Harry neared the musician he saw a small collection of coins and bills. A young woman standing next to him tossed in a few pounds. The man gave her a grateful smile, which she returned before continuing on her way.
"Check it please, show that I have nothing hidden in the sheet." The man did as asked, and confirmed: absolutely nothing.
The stranger seemed disappointed, but over more than just Harry not having seen his friend. "Hm, well that's quite unfortunate. My apologies, young man. You have a nice day, and thank you for the assistance!"
Vernon stood above him, they had neared the end of the hallway. His broad shoulders heaved with breathlessness. His belt hung limp from his hand, the leather made astoundingly pliable from it's extreme use just a moment before. He stared at Harry, who was sobbing and hiccuping with agony, with a smoldering rage.
Tears streamed from his eyes, and the broken boy sobbed as much as he was able, without disturbing his bruised ribcage. Mucus dribbled from his nose, and spittle leaked from his mouth as he cried. What was wrong with him? What was so wrong with him that he deserved being beaten within an inch of his life with a belt? Why was his magic so vile, and disgusting to them?
"You can speak to serpents?" It was more a statement than a question, but it demonstrated her suprise none the less. Harry fixed his gaze on her, his brow furrowed and a slight frown appeared on his face.
He had transfigurwd several objects, levitated several more, and summoned fire in his hands. At one point he did a short dance with Delphi, pretending to be a snake charmer. By the end of the hour, the sun was nearly finished setting, and his crowd has dispersed, heading home to their families and pets. His performance had accrued a bit over 40 pounds!
He sat there for another moment, unmoving. He started to look around, he was in the basement of the Dursley house. His clothes had been tossed into a corner by the stairs. He got up and stumbled over to the little pile, and clumsily pulled his garments on. Then he slowly, and painfully climbed the stairs, and busted through the door. The sound of it slamming against the wall startled Petunia who was cutting vegetables in the kitchen, whete the basement entrance was located. She brandished the knife at him in defense.
"That is the safes possible place for Harry to reside until he has to begin his schooling. The enchantments placed by his mother made sure of that." His tone was assured, verging on arrogant.
The sounds of muffled crying emenated from an unassuming cupboard underneath the stairway of one number 4 Privet Drive. The contents of said cupboard, a milk crate which itself contained several mostly empty bottles of now curdling milk, some uselessly thin blankets, large amounts of dust and insects, and the source of the traumatized screams: a child. Harry Potter sported a very recent addition to his sweet, innocent face, an angry and lightning shaped gash that ran down his forehead. The gash still had pinpricks of blood beginning to bead in the deep crevices of marred flesh.
Due to it not being a busy morning, his food arrived with relative swiftness. Before him was placed two plates with more food than he remembered being fed in his life. On one, a stack of three thick Belgian style waffles, their exterior was crispy golden brown and steaming slightly. A generous dusting of powdered sugar coated the stack. The second plate had two large chicken legs on it, both fried and crispy to a deep golden brown. Their surfaces were craggy and well coated with fried flour and spice dredge. Then, next to his plate of waffles was set a pitcher of syrup about twice the size of a shot glass.
"I've known your name since the day you were born." Said the guitarist, his tone hinted at bittersweet memories.
The voice grew louder, but his torment continued. A very clear memory of his cheek being stroked so tenderly by that hulking mound of fat that posed as a man.
She didn't turn back to look at him. He sank to his knees, and looked sadly as she turned a corner and was gone. He couldn't process what had just happened, his forehead wrinkled, his mouth hung agape. The obsidian haired boy felt a tightness in his chest.
"I went to Hogwarts with them. Your father was one of my best friends; he... helped me through many things." Remus looked away, his heart aching.
Today he was finally being released from his prison under the steps. He needed to check for the hole he supposedly left on the side of the house using some freak act of "magic." Harry was back to weeding the garden, slowly and painstakenly he pulled the unsightly plants from the ground while the spines of their leaves bit into the callouses on his palms and fingers. He took a tenative glance up and around, checking for his cousin and his goons, or the she-devil ironically named after a beautiful product of evolution, Petunia.
"Yeah," Harriet sighed nervously, she started to pack more books into her trunk in order to go to Draco's. Merry shifted awkwardly, Harriet needs to know a lot of things before she should go to their Christmas party at the Malfoy's.
"But enough of them, let's get you two a wand. And remember the wand chooses the witch. Merry you first," She gulped and moved forward slowly. In under 5 minutes, Merry had her wand, 10-inch elk wood with unicorn hair core which was good for charms and hexes.
"That's fine, just know that I will always accept you and love you no matter what," Merry held her cheek. Harriet sniffed and scrunched up her face, about to cry. "Oh shit, don't cry, you will make me cry then!" Merry laughed and hugged her tightly. Harriet cried into her shoulder, she couldn't believe she had such an amazing and accepting friend, maybe life was repaying her from her terrible past. She was so glad she had Merry in her life. Merry rubbed her back until she stopped crying.
"It is supposed to show your power in numbers most people are in the 1000's but the highest is 2000. Your power can't be put into those numbers," The goblin explained.
"Just promise me that you won't go to the party where the adults are going to be, just stay with me and Draco. I don't want to see what will go down if you meet the wrong person," Merry rubbed her eyes, somehow she got so attached to this precious girl. She would do anything to keep her safe, Harriet has been through so much and she doesn't deserve any more pain.
"Dean Thomas," He saluted her with two fingers. She giggled at his gesture which made the boy smile triumphantly. The bell soon rang which signaled class was starting. The professor Flitwick took attendance which he fell out of his seat, well off of his stack of books, when he called her name. The class laughed as she ran to help him up.
"Thank you," Blaise whispered to her because she freed him from Draco's long rants. Blaise quickly left to escape Draco.
"Okay, okay, sorry," He apologized. Harriet pushed him aside and delicately said a knockout spell which sent the troll to the floor.
"This is Willow," Merry had Willow in her hands. Willow was nibbling on a stuffed dragon that was almost the size of her.
Slytherin: Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, Theodore Nott, Pansy Parkinson, Millicent Bulstrode, Merry Baxter, Travand Daphne Greengrass
"I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even put a stopper in death," He drawled on in a monotone voice. Harriet shivered at his speech, she was very ambitious to learn how to do everything he just said. He walked in front of her and Merry's table and dramatically stopped.
"If I can't reply in the muggle world, I guess I have to reply in the Wizarding World," She giggled quietly and made her way downstairs.
"I know but we can do next year, I promise," Harriet cuddled into Merry while Draco pouted. They ate candy and crisps that the girls had for dinner and silently watched the movies. The group watched different Halloween movies while avoiding the ones with witches to avoid debate until they started to fall asleep. Everyone was asleep by 6:30 with the room dark except the light from the television and the slight light coming from the window which was a view of the underwater lake. Harriet snuggled into Merry more with her arm around her waist and her head on her shoulder. Merry yawned and opened her eyes and say Harriet snuggling into her. She smirked as an idea popped into her head.
Harriet couldn't move for a week when she looked through some of her Uncle's papers, but she was only 7 years old. She was curious, her eyes always had to look at everything. Examine everything around her, her eyes sparkled with wonder and amusement at even the simplest things like ducks walking around the park or when the toast popped up. Petunia noticed as time went on, Harriet's eyes started to fill with fear. Her eyes would look up briefly as they wanted to see the world and explore but the fear of being hit scared her so she stopped looking at the world with such big round eyes. Eyes just like her mother, so vibrantly green. But... at times, there are sparks of mischief, mischief never was in the eyes of Lily. Lily's eyes also never had fear in them nor as much curiosity in them, but every time she saw Harriet eager to read a book, to dream and wish that magic existed, she only could think of Lily. Lily, her sister who always got all the attention and love. Her special sister, the important sister. She ruined her life. She was neglected because of those big green curious eyes, those same green eyes on the little freak only made Petunia suffer even more.
"Hey," Merry's voice was very calm and soothing. "It's okay, I didn't mean to scare you." Merry reached out to brush her hair back that was sticking to her face. Harriet flinched and took a step back. "Breathe," Merry told her calmingly. Harriet closed her eyes and focused on her breathing, not wanting to have a panic attack on her first day. Once she calmed herself down, Merry asked her if she was okay.
"Oh come on, you aren't really wanting to wait 2 weeks before we can properly fly," Merry gave her a look.
"I think we need a new feather over here professor," Harriet said. Dean threw his head back laughing which led to the whole class laughing at her comment.
"I think they are nice," Harriet pouted and looked down at her broom. Merry tried not to laugh at Malfoy continuously getting struck out with Harriet.
"Today you will be taking notes," He walked up to the chalkboard but turned around when he heard no one take out their notebooks. He looked at Harriet for a bit with her already prepared notes but said nothing. "Why is no one except Ms. Potter prepared with her notebook ready?" No one moved. "Take out your notebooks," He scowled which made everyone get the clue and started to take notes as he explained proper cauldron care and how to not blow up the entire classroom. Harriet frowned a bit when she realized they weren't going to be brewing today. He explained how 2 class periods would be for preparing while the last class period at the end of the week would be for brewing the potions. Merry seemed a bit bored by all of the rules but Harriet knew the rules were necessary for safety. It seemed like Harry thought wrong, potions seemed like it was not going to be a flop of a class.
