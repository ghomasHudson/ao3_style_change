Harry walks into the great hall the next morning with Seamus and Dean on either side of him, Seamus on his left with his arm wrapped around his shoulders and Dean holding his right hand. He sits in between them, his eyes immediately finding Malfoy, who is sat next to Parkinson. Seamus follows his gaze before looking at Harry. Harry didn't say who he was talking about last night but he knows know that Seamus just figured it out.
"Thanks, I think so too." He says and Harry sees Hermione raise her eyebrows at him whilst he rolls his eyes.
Harry isn't entirely sure how long he spends crying in the forbidden forest. All he knows is that it's dark and there's no one around. Also it's cold. Really cold. Fucking freezing. Harry hadn't realised how cold he was until he stood up and tried to walk back to the castle. His teeth are chattering and his entire body is covered in goosebumps. He rushes back to the castle and goes straight to the kitchen.
"What do you think I want to do?" Draco whispers and Harry smiles, his mouth still next to Draco's ear so he can't see his expression.
"What's up mate?" Ron asks and Harry rests his foot on the wall next to him, bent at the knee, and leans back against the pillar behind him.
"Harry I know you feel guilty about the war but starving yourself isn't helping anything." Draco says in his ear and Harry freezes, which makes Draco realise what he said. Well there goes the plan of getting Harry to tell him himself.
"For fuck sake Potter would you stop being so bloody stubborn?" He asks, exasperated, and Harry finally turns to look at him.
Harry decides to go for a walk, having been in a warm room for almost 2 hours and needing fresh air. The grounds are pretty vacant considering most people are in Hogsmeade, so he strolls along the river. He sees Malfoy sitting against a tree, scribbling away at what Harry assumes is an essay, and he admires the way the sun illuminates him making him look like some ethereal being. Malfoy looks up, and Harry moves his gaze to the mountains in the distance, hoping Malfoy didn't catch him staring.
"Was that intentionally Morse code?" He whispers, and Harry nods, he didn't think Draco would know Morse code but God is he glad he does. He wants to leave. He's been in the hall for nearly half an hour and he's starting to want to go into hiding again.
"You should talk to someone, Harry. Even if you feel you can't talk to Miss Granger or Mr Weasley." McGonagall says, and Harry nods.
"That's nothing, Potter. Don't worry about it." He says as he takes the bag off of the woman at the til with a smile and a thank you.
"I'm guessing he's gonna be in here a lot then, huh?" Draco looks back at Harry and watches him breath peacefully.
"You've got yourself a good team there, Harry." He did notice Weasley glaring at him the whole time they were practising but he can't deny she's good.
"Thank you." He gets up and walks out the kitchen, thankful that almost everyone is in the hall eating. Harry's not sure what to do now. He can't go see Hagrid again, because he told him he was going to eat, and he doesn't really want to talk to anyone. Harry makes his way up to his dorm and grabs Sirius' guitar. He hasn't played it at all since being back. Harry looks at it for a second, running his finger over the S.B  J.P  R.L carved one on top of the next into the back of the neck, and smiles slightly before frowning and looking at his bed post. He walks over and looks at the J.P carved into the base of the post and smiles slightly. He noticed it in second year. Ron's has S.B carved into his, and Seamus has R.L. It didn't occur to him it could be his dad. Harry runs his finger over the neck of the guitar again before picking it up and leaving the dorm. He makes his way up to the one eyed witch and slips behind it undetected before making his way to the shrieking shack.
"Mate what are you doing?" Ron asks and Harry doesn't know what to do. Everyone is looking at him and he hates it when everyone is looking at him and Draco and Blaise are just waiting to see what Harry says but Ron and Dean and everyone is looking at him expectantly and he can't help it. Before he can stop himself he's looking into Rons head again, seeing the conversation he had earlier with the rest of the guys, and takes a shaky breath in as he leaves his mind.
"Which means my godson is your second cousin or something." Harry says and Draco looks up at him, confused.
"Well done! You did so well!" He says and Harry smiles slightly, pulling Seamus and Dean into a hug.
"However if you and Mr. Zabini are wanting to spend time together as you are now friends then by happy coincidence you will also have to spend more time with Mr. Malfoy."
"The usual." Harry mumbles, deciding not to mention Malfoy. At the thought of the blonde his eyes drift over to the slytherin table and immediately find the pale face he was seeking. Harry notices that Draco is looking straight at him and looks kind of annoyed and, is that Jealousy?
"Oh my god you fucked." He says slightly too loud and Draco is glad he had the sense to cast a suppression charm so those around can't hear.
"Oh do not apologise, that was badass." Blaise grins appreciatively, "But I'm bored of this party so lets go find something else to do, yeah?"
"I just don't want her to worry." He says and Harry turns his hand over and grips Dracos hand in his.
"Okay class." Professor Slughorn announces and Harry winces slightly. He has a headache and that isn't helping. "Today we start our paired projects. I will pair you up with someone who will be your potions partner for the rest of this term." He says and Harry sighs. Whoever he gets best not be chatty because he might kill them.
“You smell of broom stick wax and treacle tart and cinnamon and the forest. You smell comforting and warm. You smell like hope and light.” Draco says into Harry’s neck and Harry throws his arm over Draco’s waist.
"Potter I don't know where I'm going." Draco mutters and Harry almost rolls his eyes at how ridiculous this scenario is.
"Ron, since we've been dorm mates me and Draco have kind of called a truce. We aren't at each others throats anymore." He says, almost laughing because that's not true, they're at each others throats more than ever, just in a different way.
"What?" He asks, concerned for a second before he sees the look on her face and realised she just caught that interaction.
"Did you..." Blaise trails off as he looks at Harry. "Are you okay?" He asks, seeing the subtle redness of Harry's eyes and he's seen Draco like this enough to know that this means he's been crying.
”I wanna paint your nails now.” Pansy says with a mischievous grin a while later, and Harry raises an eyebrow. He’s been involved in Hermione and Ginny’s makeover sessions one too many times to know that, according to both of them, he looks hot as fuck when he has his nails painted, and the one time he gave in and let them do his makeup they said he was the hottest guy they’ve seen, so this could end one of two ways.
"You may go, Mister Potter. But if you change your mind you are welcome to come back and ask for some." She says and Harry nods, trying to ignore the fact that Malfoy and Blaise watch him carefully as he walks out of the hospital wing.
"Harry?" He hears a voice behind him and turns to see Ron a way down the bridge. He nods in recognition before turning back to look at the lake. Ron walks over and sits next to Harry on the railing.
"Come to the party. I mean, I don't really want to go, but I can't get out of it, and you being there will definitely make it more bearable." Harry bites his lip.
"You're gonna kill me, love?" Harry's eyes are sparkling with amusement, and Draco huffs under him, stealing a kiss.
"Ah, brilliant! I must say, Harry, I am very impressed with your work this year. Your last essay was impeccable. I couldn't fault it. I hear your other professors agree with me." He says, sifting through some parchment on his desk before handing harry his last piece of homework which has
He expects the Gryffindor to make a sarcastic comment or glare at him like he usually does. He doesn't expect him to just stare into Dracos eyes as he pulls his shirt over his head. Wow that was attractive. Harry has a dark green dragon going up his side, the tail trailing all the way down to his waist band and disappearing below it and the top of it going up to just below his nipple, the outline of the dragon is in thick black lines and his tail is mainly black. The second it's exposed the dragon's wings expand and his eyes open and Draco sees that they're a silvery gray colour. So it's a magic tattoo. Draco then takes in the rest of his body that he can see. There's a big scar above his heart, probably from when he was hit with the Avada Kedavra curse for the second time, and the rest of his body is littered with scars from the war, and there are other very faint scars that Draco assumes are from his cousin. He looks back at the tattoo and feels the urge to touch it, so he slowly reaches out and brush his finger along the dragons back. It looks content and curls up, bringing it's wings back into its side, but most importantly, he feels Harry's chest jolt slightly as his breath catches when Draco touches him, and Draco can feel his soft skin and his muscles.
Harry falls asleep, and Draco continues carding his fingers through his hair. He still doesn't know what's wrong with him; Harry was lying on his lap for an hour before he fell asleep and he didn't say a word. He just sighed and frowned and Draco tried to ease the frown away but Harry was clearly thinking about something important because until the point he fell asleep he looked conflicted and stressed. Draco wishes Harry would talk to him about whatever it is that's going on, but he knows he shouldn't pry. Draco watches Harry sleep, his eye scanning every part of Harry's face, and when he's sure Harry is deeply asleep he lifts his hand, the one that isn't carding through Harry's curls, and softly traces Harry's face with his index finger, running it along his cheekbones, down the bridge of his nose, across his jaw, and ghosting it over his lips before finally resting it on Harry's chest and gently rubbing small circles there. Harry looks so calm when he's like this, and Draco loves it. He loves the way Harry's lashes brush his cheeks, and the way his frown settles as soon as Dracos fingers touch his skin, and how Harry's lips twitch into a small smile when Draco brushes his fingers over them. Draco wonders, if he ever kisses Harry, will his lips twitch into a smile then too? Draco hesitates, his index finger pausing against Harry's jaw. He doubts that will ever happen.
"It hurts. Surviving hurts. Living hurts. The guilt hurts. No one else got to choose. So many people died and they didn't get to come back." Harry's never told anyone this before and Draco can tell from the look in his eyes.
"We should probably head back up to the castle." Harry whispers and Draco nods slowly. Harry accio's their clothes from downstairs and stands up before pulling his clothes on whilst Draco does the same. When they're both dressed they make their way out of the shrieking shack and back to the castle.
"Do you really- I don't know if I- Do you really think it's a good idea?" He asks and McGonagall looks at him for a second.
"Oh, er, okay. Thank you." He says and Pomfrey smiles. He's still not okay with Dean, and he's not been looking forward to going back.
"Yeah. I used to watch your name. You used to pace a lot, and when I'd see you wandering around the castle I knew you were up to something." He says, squeezing Draco gently so he knows he doesn't mean anything by it.
"Memories." Harry says, grabbing Dracos hand because his own are shaking. He's finally going to be able to know what his parents were like and the kind of mischief his dad and Sirius and Remus got up to. He's going to see a version that isn't jaded with hate like the one he saw from Snape.
"Lovely. Get up, both of you, the quidditch game starts soon." Hermione says before leaving the room.
I'm sick again! Who's surprised though, really? :') I went to Cornwall (It's beautiful and if I wasn't so in love with London I would deffo live there at some point in my life) and it pissed down and I got sick so there's that.
"Whatever, Malfoy." Harry mutters, taking a step away from him and walking towards the door, but Draco grabs Harry's hand before he can reach the door handle.
"You look great too." Draco's eyes travel across every inch of his face before settling on his lips, and Harry gets the hint. He leans forward and closes the gap, pressing a soft kiss to Draco's lips.
"Well, I can give you some calming draught, but Harry I don't want you to become reliant on it. It seems to me you have not properly processed all of the things that have happened to you. Which is understandable, considering just how many things have happened to you. You haven't really had time to. Having such a big weight placed on your shoulders when you were so young, along with everything else, has not been good for your mental health." She says and Harry feels a tear fall down his cheek. He knows all of this, but hearing someone else tell him he's so messed up is hard to hear.
"Potter you are in no position to tell me no." Pomfrey says, walking back over to Harry with some water. Harry glares halfheartedly at her as he takes the glass.
"I'm not sure, Rhys..." Harry trails off, stopping just in front of Draco and meeting his gaze, and Rhys nods.
"You're a lot easier to break than I thought you would be." Harry mumbles, looking straight into Dracos eyes.
"I had people asking me too, cause 'you dorm with him you must know who it is.' apparently people don't care if I have a dark mark as long as I let them know who you're fucking." Draco says and Harry pushes himself up so he's lying on his front resting on his forearms.
Harry shifts his head slightly, burying his face deeper into his elbow as a small, quiet whimper escapes his lips. Draco bites his lip before an idea hits him. He only hesitates until Harry whimpers quietly again, before placing his right hand on Harry's back, drawing patters lightly over the soft t-shirt, his left hand not stopping it's movement through his hair. Harry stops whimpering and relaxes slightly, and Draco releases a breath he didn't realise he was holding as he continues running his fingers lightly across Harry's spine.
"Harry dear how are you?" A woman asks, and Draco tenses next to Harry. Harry just smiles at the woman.
"It seems when your parents knew Voldemort was after them they saved something for you, or, should I say, multiple things."
Okay so I wasn't really sure how to end this tbh and I might change the end if I get a better idea but I didn't wanna drag this out any longer than necessary so I hope you like it :)
"Thanks, the thing is for the essay we need to write about the origin of the spell but I've had a lot on my mind and I wasn't really paying attention during class and I will look it up later but just to get me started would you be willing to give me a brief overview?" Draco asks before adding, "I don't want to bother you but you're genuinely the best in our year and the professor is so busy." He bites his lip nervously, genuinely concerned this won't work, but Hermione just nods understandingly.
"Because I know you, Draco. I know there are a lot of things you'd love to do to me. But cursing isn't one of them." Harry summons every last bit of Gryffindor courage as he says this, because honestly he could be completely wrong. Draco gives in and grabs Harry's waist.
"So we just need to go flourish and blotts?" Harry asks, looking at Draco. He notices that Draco is sitting up straight but he's holding his butterbeer with both hands and looks uncomfortable and Harry frowns.
Draco spends all of saturday looking out for Harry and trying to get him alone, and the first opportunity he gets is when he sees Harry walking into a classroom no one ever uses after lunch, looking a mixture of sad and annoyed. Draco gives him a few minutes before walking into the room. Harry is sat on a desk with his foot resting on the chair in front of him. He's staring out the window opposite him and honestly Draco has to remind himself how to breath because Harry looks so damn beautiful with the way the sun is shining on him making him look like some sort of god.
“Oh my god.” Harry mutters, bringing a hand up to his mouth, suddenly feeling like he’s about to throw up. Dracos eyes widen too.
First update of the new year and IT'S HERE!!! THE MOMENT IS FINALLY HERE! IT HAPPENED, THIS IS NOT A DRILL, I REPEAT THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!
"He's got a lot of siblings. I'm sure he's just busy." Draco's frown deepens, but before he can question it any more Harry stops walking. "We can apparate now." He says, squeezing Draco's hand, and Draco needs to think for a second so he can focus on apparating rather than the hand in his and who it belongs to. He would really rather not splinch them.
"Or a shirt with his godfathers face on it." Draco jokes, looking at a stand in the shop with 'the chosen one' t-shirts on. Harry shoots a playful glare at Draco and Draco chuckles.
"Oh, I er- I actually have plans tomorrow." He doesn't really, not officially, he has therapy and then he does plan on spending the rest of the day in Hogsmeade, he just wants to be there with Draco. Wants to take him on their first date. Wants to forget about the past and the future and just be teenagers for a while. Not sure he can do any of that without people figuring out they're together though.
"Yeah, er..." Harry thinks for a second before smiling slightly. He starts strumming a few chords and Draco watches his face as he seems to relax.
Blaise enters the hospital wing and looks over at Harry's bed to see him fast asleep, one arm across his stomach and the other hanging over the side of the bed. He looks somewhat peaceful for the first time in ages and Blaise smiles slightly, hoping Harry is actually getting some decent sleep for once. Blaise sits in the chair next to Harry's bed and after a few minutes Harry starts whimpering. Blaise watches helplessly for a minute before Harry whimpers and his eyes snap open with a gasp.
"Thought it would be a nice surprise. You should definitely try out for seeker though." Blaise says and Draco bites his lip as they sit down at their table.
"Okay." Blaise says, not wanting to force Harry to talk, and Harry is shocked slightly but continues with the work, thankful that Blaise isn't prying.
"You alright?" Blaise asks, and Harry shakes his head, resting his head on Dracos shoulder. It takes around 5 minutes for people to stop watching him, and Harry closes his eyes and listens to Blaise, Draco and Pansy chat as they eat lunch.
"Okay." Draco is looking at him in that way that makes him feel gooey again, so he leans forward and presses a quick kiss against Draco's lips before squeezing his hand again.
"Is he playing quidditch?" Seamus asks and Neville looks out the window towards the quidditch pitch.
"Hey," Seamus runs his hand through Harry's hair, "Harry it's gonna be okay." Seamus whispers, and Harry meets his gaze again and the two look at each other for a minute before Seamus gets a probably crazy idea. He slowly leans forward, giving Harry the opportunity to stop him, and presses his lips against Harrys. Neither of them have romantic feelings for each other, no matter how many jokes they make or how much they flirt or how many times they hooked up during fifth and sixth year, but this is the only thing Seamus can think of that will stop Harry thinking. Harry responds to the kiss by gripping Seamus’ shirt in his fists as Seamus deepens the kiss.
"I see a therapist but I'm still depressed. And I feel empty and tired and I don't know what I'm doing. I can't remember the last time I ate. And I'm so tired. All the time. And I don't know why I keep trying. And I just want to give up. But sometimes..." Harry trails off.
”Really?” He ties his hair in a ponytail all the time, and he does a bun often too, or just uses a headband to push his hair out of his face, but he’s never done any intricate hairstyles because he mainly does them for convenience.
"I'll try." He lies, pressing a kiss to Draco's cheek before picking up his backpack and leaving the carriage, giving Draco's hand one last squeeze before getting off the train.
“I never thought about it. But, I guess you’re right.” He says softly, staring into Draco’s beautiful gray eyes.
"Mister Potter when was the last time you had a decent night sleep?" She asks, immediately noticing the bags under his eyes. Harry shrugs.
"Really? I have to wait til dinner to find out who it is that took my fuck buddy away?" Seamus asks, pouting. Harry chuckles and leans close to his ear.
DADA goes fast, considering it's Harrys best subject, and his next lesson, transfiguration, goes by quickly too and before he knows it they're having dinner. Once everyone has eaten, instead of going to their dorms like usual, they wait around.
"Oh, just picturing you two together." Seamus says and Draco blushes a deep red which makes Harry smile slightly. Draco is far too adorable and innocent considering his messed up past. Just as Harry is starting to feel horrible about Dracos past and all the stuff he has been through, Pansy walks over.
Harry presses a kiss against Draco's hip before standing back up and kissing a blissfully relaxed Draco. Draco grabs Harrys top lazily before deciding he is genuinely offended by how many clothes Harry is wearing. He grabs the hem of the top and pulls it over Harrys head before letting his eyes rack over his body. He has seen Harry shirtless many times, but never in this situation. He looks over the scars covering his chest, his eyes lingering on the one above his heart caused by voldemorts second killing curse, and the one directly below his neck caused from wearing the horcrux. His eyes travel down further as he admires how beautiful and toned Harry is, before noticing the bulge in Harry's joggers. He's a lot more nervous than Harry seemed, but the fact that Harry is just stood there watching him with a loving look on his face, not rushing Draco or taking the piss at how nervous he is, it makes Draco braver. Draco bites his lip before slowly pushing Harry's joggers and boxers down.
"Okay, mount your brooms and get airborne." Harry says and he takes off and hovers in the air expertly, watching as everyone takes off and hovers in front of him, looking for people that are weaker flyers. A bonus of flying around all summer is that Harry is better at quidditch than he ever has been before.
"Thank you Draco." Harry murmurs, curling further into Draco's chest and Draco grins because even though petty feuds are the least of anyone's worries the fact that Harry called him Draco made his heart beat speed up slightly.
"Maybe they knew you would find out when you saw the memory. Maybe they wanted to wait because Harry lets be honest there was never a good time to tell you you almost had a sister. It would have broke you. And Sirius and Remus knew that if they told you then you would have gone after Voldemort the second they mentioned it and they wanted you safe. Your aunt probably didn't want to bring it up." Hermione reasons and Harry shrugs, taking a bite of toast.
"How ya doing, Georgie?" Harry asks, wrapping his arms around George tightly. After the war him and George really bonded, especially as he was staying at the burrow for the first half of the summer. They were both broken and Harry was pretty much suicidal. George was the one that helped him.
"Doubtful considering you haven't eaten in days." Blaise says, concerned, and Harry frowns, staring intently at the potion. The only person who has shown even the smallest ounce of worry for Harry and he's Blaise Zabini, best friend of Harry's 'enemy.'
"Bad day. I er, I don't really wanna talk about it." He whispers and Draco nods, accepting that Harry wont say anything. Instead he just squeezes Harry's hand and presses their foreheads together as both of their eyes drift shut.
"What about Draco?" Harry is about to talk about the book, but then he stops himself. Does he really want Blaise to know he knows? Blaise might tell Draco, and Harry wants to be the one to do that. If he ever figures out how to mention it, or if he ever get's Draco alone.
"No, Hermione. I'm mad because you told him things I told you not to tell anyone. Why did you tell him I live in constant guilt? You told him I wish Voldemort had succeeded? You're the only one that knows that for a reason, Mione." Harry says and Hermione frowns.
"Well mainly I don't see the point. But I- Also I- I just... I don't think I deserve it." Draco frowns but doesn't say anything, and Harry continues. "I don't know why I'm alive, but I know I shouldn't be. And I know there are so many people that should be that aren't. I know I've told you all this before, sorry, I just- I don't know, I guess I just don't see why I deserve to live a good life when so many people don't get to. The food on that table should be there's, not mine." Harry finishes, looking down, and Draco shuffles forward until he's sat cross-legged right in front of Harry.
"So you're in love with him. Is that a bad thing?" Hermione asks quietly and Harry bites his lip and looks over at Draco to see him watching him with a small smile and that small smile answers the question better than Harry ever could.
"Don't be, honestly, I deserved more than a punch. But seriously you're the smartest person in our year, and probably in our school, besides we're only a few months into the year. Don't stress too much, it'll just exhaust you." Draco says and Hermione raises an eyebrow.
"Why have you been distracted?" Harry asks, he's been curious since Hermione mentioned it earlier, but the way Draco was just looking at him kind of confirmed her suspicions and Harry has decided that if it's true then he's going to tease the fuck out of Draco until he breaks. Draco raises an eyebrow and Harry smirks.
His friends, surprise surprise, still aren't looking for him, so he manages to make it back to the library without anyone trying to talk to him or lecture him. When he gets there, however, he isn't actually sure what to do. He can't read again, he's been doing that all morning and it clearly isn't helping anything, so he decides to draw instead. He sketches the way Malfoy looked when he entered the hospital wing, in pain but trying to look strong, like he still doesn't want to show any weakness. Which is understandable. But it still breaks Harry's heart because he hates seeing Malfoy so vulnerable. He was always so confident.
Harry walks in to potions 5 minutes late, and whilst Professor Slughorn doesn't say anything, Harry feels Ron and Hermione and Draco watching him as he walks over to his seat next to Blaise. Harry is well aware he looks like shit. His hair is a mess, he's wearing jeans and the hoodie Draco gave him last night, and he has dark rings under his eyes. He all but collapses into the chair, and Blaise pats his hand when he rests it on the desk.
Harry sighs and rests his head against the pillar behind him, shutting his eyes. After a few minutes everything goes Dark and he opens his eyes to see George standing in front of him, blocking the sun.
"Please just go." Harry can't bring himself to speak, so he projects his voice into his friends heads so he doesn't have to. Once he's done it they look at him in shock before giving in and leaving, and Blaise and Draco look at Harry in shocked confusion.
"In all honesty I sat with him the first time intending on thanking him for speaking on mine and my mother's behalf. And to apologise for the part I played in making his life harder than it needed to be. But I didn't know what to say or if he'd want to listen, so I helped him with potions instead. I kept trying though, but every time it would just end in silent studying and now it's just a habit." Malfoy says and Hermione nods.
"But I almost killed you, and I'm technically the reason her husband is in Azkaban. And I'm the reason-"
Draco walks up the stairs to the astronomy tower and breathes a sigh of relief when he sees Harry. He hasn't been able to find him since he left the library 4 hours ago. Harry hears footsteps approach and knows who it is immediately.
"Well he can't be in the castle. We've searched every floor 3 times. He must be somewhere else." She says before sighing, silently cursing the fact that they don't have the map. They know Harry still has it, but they don't even know if he brought it back to Hogwarts with him.
"That and he has a thing for you." Draco says and Harry takes a deep breath, reaching out to hold Draco's hand.
"Yeah well it looks better messy." He says, not trying to deny it because there's no point. Hermione grins at Harry and wraps her arm around his waist.
"He is pretty." Harry says as Draco blushes deeper and looks at Harry, and George chuckles slightly.
"Not really." Harry breaths and the hand stops moving, as if Draco's noticed he's still doing it. Harry whimpers and moves his head, trying to tell Draco not to stop. It seems to work because he starts moving the hand again.
"No, I need to write an essay for Study of Ancient Runes." She says, bidding them farewell before walking off towards the library.
"Come on, he'll get over it eventually. He's just mad that we used to fuck about. He probably thinks we still do." George says and Harry sighs.
"You okay?" Harry asks quietly and Draco almost laughs because he should be the one asking Harry that.
Ron smiles at him when he walks into the classroom, and Harry nods in recognition, avoiding Dean's eyes for now. He's still not sure he's forgiven Dean. Harry sits next to Pansy, on the table behind Draco and Blaise, Blaise in front of Harry and Draco in front of Pansy, and half way through the lesson he gets bored and starts to draw. He sketches Draco as he can see him now in the corner of his parchment, and he notices Pansy watching him, transfixed, so he quickly sketches Blaise too, even though it's pretty much just the back of his head.
"That must be one special person." Harry mumbles, wondering who Draco thought of that has that affect on him, feeling kind of jealous of whoever it is, and Draco keeps his eyes on the wolf.
"I-" The room is dark, the only light from the moon shining through the window above them, and Harry can't help but wish he could lean forward and kiss Draco. "I'm really hoping being with you will help." Harry whispers, and it's not only because he doesn't want to have nightmares, but because then he'll have an excuse to sleep with Draco every night. Draco strokes Harry's cheek again softly before smiling slightly.
So it's 10:15am and I'm at work. Got in half an hour late cause I had a blood test this morning (big up the NHS). I currently feel so sick like genuinely could throw up any second and I've got an awful headache and I really want to go home but I feel bad going home cause we're so busy but I can't focus on anything so I decided to post a new update cause that makes sense. But yeah I really hope my manager clocks on soon and sends me home cause I am not doing good.
"No. The consequences would be unimaginable. I mean, I'd probably get kicked out of school." Harry laughs, genuine and loud, burying his face in Draco's neck as he laughs with him.
Harry slumps back into his chair and opens the book. As he reads he notices someone has drawn small constellations in the margins of the book and Harry finds himself paying more attention to them than to the actual words. Harry walks to the front of the library to where Madam Pince is and checks out the book, and when he gets back to his table he sees another book on his table that definitely wasn't there before. He puts the astronomy book in his bag before picking up the new book. He's surprised to see it's a muggle book, Pride and Prejudice. The copy is old but pristine, no bent corners, no marks on the cover, and no cracks in the spine. He knows it's old, however, because the pages are slightly worn which shows its been read a lot. It's definitely well looked after. Harry frowns at it, wondering where it came from. The Hogwarts library doesn't hold many muggle books, and this is definitely not one from the library, it doesn't have the Hogwarts stamp on the inside of the cover. It's a beautiful copy, and Harry hasn't read this book yet. He sinks into his chair and reads for an hour, until Hermione shows up to make Harry go to lunch. Harry grabs his bag, keeping the book in his hand, knowing he's going to read it during lunch.
"Come on darlin." Harry says, grabbing Draco's hand and pulling him up off the bed before pulling on his shoes and grabbing his bag before the two of them walk to transfiguration.
"Lets just go to bed." Draco says quietly and Blaise nods. They both crawl into bed when an idea idea strikes Draco. He waits until Blaise is fast asleep before climbing out of bed quietly and grabbing Harry's book and a bit of parchment, before he writes a small note.
"He wont, Draco, cause you're right there." Blaise smiles at him and Draco takes a deep breath before pressing his forehead back against Harry's.
"Harry we were worried about you! What have you been doing?" She asks and Harry, who is warming up nicely, gestures to himself, briefly waving his hand at his body.
"He asked why I got the Draco Constellation and I said I just have a thing for dragons. Oh and he told me about his childhood!" Harry says and she raises an eyebrow questioningly.
"Potter. I need to see you in my office later. Come by after your last period." She says before handing him his timetable and walking away. Harry sighs as he walks out of the hall, not bothering to wait for anyone. His timetable says his first lesson is at 10am, so he has an hour and a half until class. He rushed up to his dorm, has a quick shower and pulls on his uniform, instead of wearing trousers he pulls on some skinny jeans, before grabbing his bag, which his sketchbook and reading book is in, and making his way to the lake. He sits with his back against a tree trunk and looks across the lake at the mountains in the distance. He takes out his sketchbook and a pencil, muggle objects obviously he's not going to faff with a quill and ink, and starts sketching his view, going into so much detail, detail you wouldn't even notice in real life unless you sat there studying the view for hours on end, and an hour and a half later Harry has the perfect sketch.
"Okay." He whispers, pecking Draco again. "Have you done anything like this before? I don't wanna hurt you." He asks. Draco blushes and diverts his gaze from Harrys eyes to his shoulder as he nods.
"You don't curse people when their back is turned." Draco says when he realises most people are looking at him in shocked confusion. Harry smirks at him knowingly and he sees Hermione smile when Draco blushes slightly.
Draco feels relief wash over him at the sight of Harry but frowns at his actions. Is he always this closed off from Granger? They always seemed so close. Granger looks kind of hurt by his actions so Draco turns to her, mutters "Ill make sure he's not dying" to try and reassure her before following Potters lead and heading upstairs.
"I don't think so Teddy. Nanny Dromeda will be better by then and you'll be with her." Harry says, "But, I am going to give you your present now." Harry says and Teddy grins.
"I'd feel a lot better if you weren't sat on the edge of the tower." Draco says and Harry laughs through his nose.
"I don't think Harry's here." She says and Ron wonders how many people know Harry sleeps here and if they think there's more to it than that.
"I wasn't going to hand you over. I wanted you to win." Draco says and Harry smiles and moves slightly so he can kiss Draco's forehead. He decides not to talk more about how fucked up both of their lives have been, so instead he presses his forehead against Draco's and takes a deep breath in.
"I knew something would happen when I left your room and you were lying on his lap. Tell me what happened?" She asks and Harry chuckles, explaining how their kiss happened and their conversation after it, gushing about how cute Draco is.
Harry and Draco went back to bed after their kiss, just lying next to each other in silence with Harry's arms wrapped so tight around Draco and his face pressed into Harry's neck. Harry is stroking Draco's back softly, and he can feel Draco's smile pressed against his skin, both of them just basking in the fact that they're in love. Harry's still scared though. Still terrified because yeah loving Draco and being loved by Draco is amazing, but it makes it real, and it means if anything happens to Draco then it's going to hurt so much. It would have hurt anyway, but before, when he didn't know that Draco loves him, he could pretend he hated him, and he had nothing to lose, so it lessened the pain. But this is so real, and to lose this now, Harry is sure it will kill him.
"Nah I'll do it." Harry says before standing up and moving further down the table to sit next to Rhys and Will Cameron, one of the new Beaters, who is in sixth year.
"Phase two. Nice or nah?" He asks and Draco looks thoughtful for a second and Harry decides he needs to do something quick or the second years will be gone, so he grabs Draco by the collar and presses him against the wall.
"I don't think your dorm-mates will like it much if they find a snake here." Draco says and Harry shifts away from Draco slightly before lying down, his head in Dracos lap. He'll blame exhaustion if Draco questions him.
"What, I need a reason to hug my boyfriend?" He mutters against Harrys neck and Harry can feel Dracos face burning red as if he's blushing. It takes Harry a few seconds of wondering why Draco is suddenly affectionate and embarrassed before he clocks.
"I am sure. As for you, Mister Zabini, you also do not need to write it. I know you have been caring for Harry so I will allow it." He smiles warmly before walking over to the next pair, and Blaise looks at Harry.
"I have something for you. I was instructed to wait until your 21st birthday, however we both feel it would benefit you now." She says and Harry raises an eyebrow.
It’s Friday. Draco still hasn’t worked up the courage to interact with Potter apart from looking at him longingly or in concern. It’s driving Pansy and Blaise mad.
So this fic is now done! I hope you enjoyed it and all that. If you did go leave a comment or kudos or both if you're feeling super great and if you really enjoyed it maybe share it with people you know, like your best friend, your mum, your nan, or your dog. I reckon your dog would love it. Okay I'm rambling because I'm literally at work sat at my desk right now and I really don't want to do actual work things and typing this makes it look like I'm working so hey, its a win win situation. Although I am definitely gonna post this with this rambling all over it and you're still reading it so maybe its a win win lose situation cause I feel so sorry for you reading this okay I'll stop anyway thanks for reading love you <3
"He asked why I'm talking to you now rather than them. I looked into his mind. I didn't mean to but I couldn't help it. I saw what he thinks and I saw what the others said." Harry whimpers and Blaise shuffles closer to Harry so his side is pressed against his, hoping it will provide some sort of comfort.
Harry sees Ron and Hermione entering the great hall and decides he can join them now. Harry quickly looks himself over in the mirror to see if he looks as shit as he feels. He's wearing some skinny fit grey joggers and a plain white t-shirt as he couldn't be bothered with his usual skinny jeans this morning. His hair is a mess as usual and it sticks out all over the place and Harry makes sure it covers his scar, which just brings more attention and staring, before looking the rest of himself over. He looks tired, as usual; He has nightmares every night and never gets more than a few hours sleep at most. He makes his way to the hall as fast as he can without full on running and slow down as he enters the hall, Hermione automatically catches his eye and a look of relief flashes across her face.
"Alright. I'll come." He says and Harry grins just as an announcement sounds telling the younger years to go to their common rooms.
"I'm fine. I'll see you in potions." He says with a small smile before walking back to his table and continuing his essay.
"I'm glad you're talking to someone, Harry. Even if it isn't us." She says and Harry turns his head to look at her. The second they lock eyes Harry has to force himself not to wince. All he can think of when he looks at her is hearing her scream in Malfoy Manner.
Harry holds his breath as Draco pushes the door open. He's nervous, for obvious reasons, but he was also kind of worried about coming to the manor because of what happened last time he was here. Walking into the entrance hall now it feels completely different. It feels homey, rather than cold and empty, and there's pictures spread across the walls and there's rugs on the marble floor that stop it being echo-y and feeling too big and too empty. Draco is telling Harry what each room is as they pass, and Harry is trying to listen, but he only picks up half of what Draco is saying because he knows with each step he's getting closer to Narcissa Malfoy and there's a lump in his throat and he's almost certain she doesn't like him.
Harry and Draco follow Hermione into flourish and blotts and look around the shop whilst she buys her ink and quills, and when she's done they start their walk back to the castle, shopping bags in one hand and a hot chocolate that Harry insisted they all needed in the other.
There are more people than usual watching the Gryffindor team practice today and when Harry finally manages to escape the questions and get to his dorm room he flomps face down on his bed, still wearing his quidditch gloves and holding his broom, letting out a muffled 'URGH.'
Harry puts his book on the bedside table and motions for Draco to sit next to him. Draco bites his lip nervously before he sits down and Harry rests his head in Draco's lap. He does this with everyone, apart from Ron, because it's comforting and they always end up playing with his hair which he loves. Sure enough Dracos fingers immediately start threading through his hair. Harry is now lying on his back and his right arm is thrown over his stomach. He stays silent and Draco frowns down at him.
"What's up?" Seamus asks, resting his head on top of Harry's. He knows why Harry's sad most of the time, but he asks anyway in case there's something else bothering him.
"My boy's growing up. Tell me everything." He says, pushing Pansy down the bench so he can sit next to Draco. Pansy glares at Blaise and sits on Dracos lap.
"Okay well his name is Michael Burns. He can come to you or you can go to him, however is best for you."
"Open the window." He says quickly, and Neville jumps up to open the window just as the broom flies through it at top speed.
"What you said last night. How I'm a part of your life. How you're definitely a part of mine now. Have been for the past 7 years, really." Harry's voice is laced with sleep and his eyes are focused on Dracos and Draco is smiling slightly. "I need you now. I rely on you. And I know that's not fair on you. I was thinkin' bout how we used to fight all the time, and now we don't, and I like that." Harry sighs, his eyes running over Dracos face before returning to his eyes. "You look so peaceful when you're asleep, and you're so vulnerable, but then so am I." Draco is kind of lost for words, but it's okay because Harry isn't done. "I-I'm scared." Draco frowns as Harry's hand grips the back of his shirt gently.
Just a short little chapter cause this didn't seem to fit at the end of the last chapter or at the beginning of the next one. Hope a little bit of Harry/Kreacher wholesomeness cheers you all up on this sunny day and I hope you all have a garden/balcony that allows you to enjoy the weather whilst maintaining lockdown and social distancing rules <3
"See you tomorrow Malfoy." He says as Draco leaves the room, and the second the door is shut Harry gets started on the new tattoo. A gray wolf on his right pec, stood on a mountain with the full moon behind it.
"She worries more when she doesn't hear from you." Harry says softly and Draco looks him in the eye. Harry slowly leans forward and kisses Draco softly and when he pulls back Draco's blushing like mad and has a really fucking adorable smile on his face.
"These things were given to Mr Black for safe keeping, who gave them to Mr Lupin when he figured he would be sent to Azkaban. Mr Black and Mr Lupin added to it, too." McGonagall says and Harry frowns.
"Thank you, Professor." He says before walking over to the Gryffindor table and sitting beside Hermione.
"As do you, Narcissa." Harry returns the hug. "I, er, I don't know if this is, like, okay? Kreacher said this is what Sirius used to wear and now I kind of think it's probably not a good idea." Harry says, and Narcissa smiles.
"Go and get some rest, Potter. I'll give you a week to think it over, but I'll try and think of someone else just in case you really don't want to."
"So... Mother, you know I've had this..." He gestures vaguely with his fork, "thing. This feeling, I guess. For someone. Since I was 11." Narcissa's smile turns slightly happier.
"I'm sorry, Harry. He asked me about our DADA work because he was distracted and didn't take notes and I said you're the best at that class but you've been distracted too, when I finished explaining the work he asked if I was okay and then he asked what's wrong with you and I didn't mean to tell him everything but I'm so worried about you and you're roommates and I figured if he knew he could keep an eye on you for me but I just kept talking and I told him more than I intended to." She rambles and Harry bites his lip. He knows it's not Hermione's fault.
"I smell like home?" He asks and Harry nods, smiling slightly, the extra courage the fire whisky is giving him is slowly lessening but it's still there for now and Harry is going to take advantage of it.
"It's okay. But if I have to watch you play the least you could do is not die." He says and Harry chuckles.
"You think you're confused. You should have seen his face when he came to me earlier." She chuckles, running her fingers through Harry's hair.
"Okay sarcy, has something happened?" She asks but Draco can see Harry perfectly from where he's sat and he's talking to Hermione with the cutest smile and he's eating and Draco wonders what they're talking about but then Harry bites his lip and meets Draco's eye before turning back to Hermione and he doesn't have to wonder. He is worried why Harry looked so worried then though.
He follows her up to the headmasters office in silence and sits down when she gestures to the chair opposite hers.
"He's showing you that your dad and his parents were good people." Draco says to Harry and he nods, watching as Sirius and James sit side by side on James' bed, backs against the wall.
"Harry, you really think Malfoy would behave like that unless he had some sort of feelings besides hate for you?" She says and Harry frowns.
On the bright side I started posting a new fic that is not Drarry but it is my first Hargrove fic so if you're into that then go check it out and if you're not then check it out anyway please thank you love you lots <3
“Hey, Draco.” He calls softly, rubbing Draco’s side where his hand was resting, and Hermione almost squeals because they’re so cute and Harry is the sweetest thing and she’s so proud.
"Pretty sure Blaise planned for this so..." Draco nods in the direction of the cupboard and Harry sees Blaise appear with two brooms and a snitch.
"Especially when you spent all of summer talking about how pretty Draco is." George says and Harry shrugs one shoulder.
"You don't smell like fire whisky anymore." Draco mutters against Harrys neck and Harry shivers, his neck is one of his sensitive spots.
"We should get going." She says and Harry and Draco agree so they start the walk to Hogsmeade together, Harry walking in between the other two and occasionally brushing his hand against Draco's subtly so it looks like an accident because Draco hasn't been to Hogsmeade since before the war and he really doesn't want to be here.
"Maybe you are." Draco says, reaching for the book, and Blaise holds it out to his side so Draco can't reach it. Harry bites his lip to stop himself from laughing as the two of them struggle for a minute. Draco eventually gives up with a sigh.
"But we both know that's not true. Would you rather I didn't tell Seamus?" Harry asks. He probably should have spoken to Draco before telling the school about his love life.
"I love you," Harry starts, and it still baffles them how they can say that now, "But loving people hurts, and I'm scared you're gonna leave, or something's gonna happen to you," Harry takes a shaky breath in, "I don't think I'd survive that."
"Okay, do you want anything? I can give you an anti dizziness draught but I shouldn't really do that until we're certain what caused the dizziness." She says and Harry nods slightly.
The picture isn't just of Teddy, it's of Harry holding him. Harry is wearing ripped skinny jeans and black boots with a tight white t-shirt and he looks beautiful. His hair is a mess and he has a bandanna tied round his head and the way he's smiling down at Teddy is incredibly sweet. Teddy is a very cute baby, smiling widely up at Harry, even Draco can't deny that.
"If it hurts then tell me and I'll stop." He says, trying to ignore how good it feels to have Draco surrounding him.
"That went well." He smiles, and Harry leans over and kisses Draco's cheek before resting his head on Draco's shoulder.
"Oh... Well wasn't that thoughtful." He grins and Harry presses his lips together and glances at the book which has the note tucked inside it, not answering Blaise because yes it was thoughtful but knowing Draco cared enough to actually bring Harry something that would help him makes his stomach flutter. Blaise looks at Harry for a few second before a knowing look spreads across his face.
"Luckily I'm not dating Voldemort. And they're just gonna have to accept the fact that I love you." Draco's eyes light up as a blush spreads across his cheeks.
"Doesn't matter what other people think, Harry. What matters is that you're okay." Harry nods, knowing he's not okay at all.
"Not that we're together, just that I've had the biggest crush on you since I was 12." Draco blushes and Harry grins.
Draco watches Harry cautiously, knowing he's zoned out and wanting to make sure he's not going to have a breakdown in the middle of class. Harry looks over at him after a minute or two and Draco mouths 'you okay?' to him and Harry nods, smiling slightly but not looking that genuine. Draco raises an eyebrow and Harry sighs before looking back over at Professor McGonagall.
"Harry James Potter you really are clueless. Draco's been distracted. He got me to tell him about why you're upset and he tried multiple times to help you. He came to me to ask about you and the way you were acting because he's worried about you. He cares about you Harry." Hermione says and Harry frowns at her before sighing and lying down on his back and putting his head in her lap.
"I, er- whenever I think about something that happened, something that fucked me up, I write it down." Harry explains and Draco looks up at Harry before looking back down at the book.
The room doesn't fall silent like Harry was expecting, but the people nearest the door turn to see who had entered, and they stare in shock when they see Draco Malfoy hand in hand with Harry Potter. Harry immediately regrets coming, but he knows he can't leave now, and he knows he's here for Draco, because Draco asked him to come with him. He squeezes his hand and stands up straight, and tries to be polite when Mrs Zabini walks over to greet Narcissa and Draco.
"Too slow." He murmurs, leaning close. Draco growls lowly and grips Harry's shoulders, pushing him back until he's pressed against the wall opposite.
"So shit then?" Seamus asks softly and Harry nods. Seamus and Dean glance at each other sadly before snuggling closer into Harry. Neither of them say anything when Harry drifts off to sleep, and when he starts to get restless and upset in his sleep they just hug him tighter and hope no one else in the common room notices. When Hermione and Ron arrive in the common room, an hour after Harry did, to see all three boys lying on the sofa asleep they just sigh in relief at the fact that at least Harry is letting someone do something to help him.
"You know, it's not smart to argue with someone that could kill you in your sleep." Harry chuckles, rolling them so he's on top, and pressing a kiss to Draco's lips.
"It wasn't him saying it's disgusting or wrong, it's just him saying he doesn't want us to scar him, which is basically him giving us his blessing. Even though he still doesn't actually know and thinks I was joking. I told him we called a truce. He asked if that was it and I said no we’re also dating and snog all the time." He says, smiling because Draco is now blushing so dark. Harry grins when Draco fails to reply to that and moves so he's standing behind Draco, resting his hands on the railing either side of Draco, his chest pressed against Draco's back and he rests his chin on Draco's shoulder.
During the rest of breakfast things go surprisingly normal, all things considered, and as they leave to go out and sit by the lake during their free period, Harry holding Teddy on his hip and Hermione playing with him with a teddy bear McGonagall gave him, Harry finds himself actually quite excited. He never really gets to spend time with his godson and even though he's only 18 he loves Teddy like he's his own, just like how Sirius loved Harry like he was his own. Besides, Harry owes it to Remus. He did so much for him and the fact that he actually entrusted him with helping raise his own son means so much.
Harry wakes up at 6am and sighs, sitting up in bed and running his hand through his hair. He lets out a big yawn and stretches before climbing out of bed and pulling on some joggers and a thin hoodie along with his converse, deciding to go for a run to keep his mind at bay.
Harry walks out of the castle rather than up to his dorm or to the library, walking until he reaches the edge of the forbidden forest. He would usually sit against an outer edge tree and look at the view, but today he decides to keep walking deeper into the forest. He approaches a clearing and his breath catches in his throat when he recognises it. There's a lake right in front of him and he stumbles forward, to the edge of the water, suddenly feeling sick. He falls to his knees and takes a shaky breath in, placing his hand on the floor where he once stood to save Sirius and looking across the lake. He can see the exact spot where Sirius nearly died, and he can see it happening. The memory is playing over and over again in front of him and he can't bring himself to look away. After a while of watching that moment he hears a rustle in the leaves just to the right of where he's looking as a Stag enters the clearing and Harry can't help but breath a laugh as tears stream down his face at how much of a coincidence this is. Harry takes a few deep breathes, trying to calm himself down, before slowly standing up and making his way to the other side of the lake, lying down exactly where Sirius had done, and looking up at the darkening sky through the trees. There's a cold breeze blowing across him and it's making him feel numb as he's just wearing jeans and a t-shirt and he isn't sure if he cares enough to go back to the castle or cast a heating charm, so he just lies there.
"I have your Constellation tattooed on my back. Of course I have feelings for you, dumbass." Harry says and Draco smiles brightly before leaning down and connecting their lips. Harry feels actual sparks the second their lips touch and he wraps his arms around Dracos waist, Dracos right hand tangling itself in Harrys hair and his left hand resting above his constellation in the middle of Harry's back. When they finally pull apart for air Dracos eyes are shining brightly.
A few more Gryffindors have arrived over the past 20 minutes, not all of them realising there was a Slytherin curled up on the sofa, but those that do took one look at Harry before realising that if they say or do anything they'll have to answer to the chosen one. Something that no one want's to do.
"Okay, guess I'm staying here then." He says and he takes Harrys hand who pulls him down on the bed next to him.
"You're impossible. Girls will automatically love a guy 50 times more if they know they're good with kids and if they love children. The second you sat Teddy on your lap your attractiveness went off the charts. You're the boy who lived twice and you love your godson, and you're not half bad to look at. Everyone knows you're the whole package and now they find you irresistible. More so than before." She explains as a group of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff 6th years walk past. Harry sighs, deciding he can't cope with this much attention, and Teddy shouldn't have to either.
"It's too late! You had your chance. How could you do this to me? What about the children?" He asks and Harry sighs.
"I did, but in a jokey way, just to see what his reaction would be." Harry says and Draco shifts his eyes from Harrys biceps to his face.
"Potter!" He turns around and sees Malfoy walking towards him. When he catches up they both continue walking to Harrys room.
"What?" Harry asks, not able to focus on anything other than the fact that not only did Voldemort kill his parents but he killed his little sister.
"Have a think about where, you can figure out how often later. And he's been security checked and everything will be confidential. He has family members who are wizards, however he himself is a muggle, meaning he is not aware of what happened in full but he is aware of who you are and you will be able to talk to him about magic." Harry nods.
"Mister Potter sir." Winky says in shock as Harry enters and he smiles slightly at her as he walks over to the sink.
"Dude we are gonna kick Ravenclaws ass tomorrow, don't worry." Ron says and Harry smiles slightly because Ron is always so good at hyping up a quidditch match.
"When I first learnt how to produce one I used the memory of when I found out I could leave my Aunt and Uncle. Then it was Sirius; I found out I had a godfather and wouldn't need to go back to the Dursleys; I finally had a good family. That didn't last long. After he died it took me a while to be able to cast a Patronus again. During the war, when I was walking to the forest, I had the resurrection stone, and I saw my parents and Sirius and Remus. They spoke to me, and they've been my happy memory since." Harry says and Draco smiles slightly at the reminiscent look in Harry's eyes.
"That's hot." He groans before deciding to actually stop teasing Draco now. He grabs Dracos right hand in his left and moves it so its next to Dracos head so he can still lean on the bed and his other hand travels down Dracos body. He casts a silent, wandless charm, which totally turns Draco on, to cover his hand in lube before pressing a finger against Dracos hole and rubbing circles around it slowly. Draco gasps at the contact and leans into the touch which makes Harry smile. He kisses Draco as he pushes his index finger slowly inside Draco. Draco gasps into the kiss and Harry looks into Dracos eyes to make sure he's not in pain.
"You know why. I don't eat much and Hermione likes to make sure I actually go to meals." He says and Draco watches as his hands run through Harry's hair.
"Well we never agree. I'd quite like to take this moment in." Draco breathes in deeply, his eyes closing, and Harry just watches him with a small smile on his face before gently pinching Draco's side.
"Mine was for you too." He says and Harry smiles before blushing when he remembers the wolf on his chest that he can feel curl into a ball. Just as he's about to mention it there's a bell and Harry realises they have defense against the dark arts.
"Harry." Teddy says in his adorable baby voice and Harry smiles slightly as Teddies hand wraps around his finger.
"McGonagall needed him for something. He's missing this class but he should be in History of Magic." Harry nods and looks at the parchment between them. He immediately stops reading after the first sentence.
"I'm afraid so. Potter, I feel it would be good for you to know, They we're planning on calling her Iris, to carry on the flower theme with your mother and aunt." She says and Harry smiles slightly.
"Potter I'll hex you." Draco warns and Harry knows hes only using his last name to try and revert back to their fighting daytime selves as opposed to the night self they were a few seconds ago.
"I can try but I'm not making any promises." He says, his voice showing his nerves, and after a second Harry grabs Draco's arm and pulls him closer so that Draco is pressed against Harry's back whilst Harry just grips his arm tight. Draco's shocked at first. The only times they've ever made contact since being made roommates at the beginning of 8th year was when they were fighting, and they haven't said anything but insults to each other. Draco debates pulling himself away from Harry, calling him a name and taking the piss out of him for crying; but Draco knows all too well how much the war fucked him up, he can hear him crying at night when Harry thinks Draco's asleep or he hears him having nightmares or waking up with a gasp or a chocked sob when he has particularly bad dreams and Draco always wants to hug him until he's better. Now he has the chance. Draco gets the impression Harry doesn't have anyone to tell him it will be okay, he's always the supportive one, not the one being comforted, and Draco likes the idea of being that person for Harry. So instead of pulling away he just sits behind Harry, pulls them both down so he's spooning him and wraps his arms around him, burying his head into Harry's neck. He lets Harry cry like he obviously needs to and holds him tight.
"I told Seamus." Harry says and Draco nods before noticing the way Seamus is looking between him and Harry and frowning slightly.
"Try again." He whispers and he's standing so close to Dracos side that he almost can't focus. Draco says the spell again, his mind full of Harry Potter, and this time a few sparks spit out of the end of his wand before a huge beautiful gray wolf erupts from the end of his wand and stands in front of the two of them.
"Well you look great." Hermione says but Harry sees concern in her eyes. He nods slightly as a thank you and spends the rest of the evening silent. All through dinner he doesn't interact with anyone and spends most of it reading, managing to finish his book, and he knows people are watching him or looking at him with worried or concerned eyes, so it's really not a surprise when Professor McGonagall asks to talk to him after dinner.
"I'm sure he will forgive you." She says. "Now go and eat something. I mean it. You're loosing too much weight." She says and Harry smiles guiltily.
"Are you?" He asks instead of answering, and Harry shrugs. He can feel McGonagalls eyes on him and he fears if he doesn't eat something she'll make him go back to the hospital wing.
but he also knows how hard it is, so he just winds his arms around Harry and presses their foreheads together.
They sit in silence for a while, Draco looking at Harry and Harry looking out of the window, neither of them saying anything but just basking in each other's company.
"How so?" Harry shrugs, promptly ending the conversation and leaving Draco wondering what that meant.
"Then they'd be whispering about how the great golden boy, saviour of the wizarding world, is fucking a former death eater." Draco points out.
"Because it's your name." Draco says, blushing, after a slight pause, and Harry grins, grabbing Draco tight and kissing him hard on the lips.
"Yeah, I know." Harry says before sighing, pausing for a second and moving so he's lying on Draco's lap again. The scene is exactly the same as it was earlier, except they both have exceptionally messy hair, not that Harry's hair is much different, and their lips are slightly swollen. Dracos hand immediately threads through Harrys hair when he rests his head in his lap again and Harry sighs in content, lying with his eyes closed.
"After the trial she told me to keep in touch, and she likes to know how I am, and how Teddy is. She knows the war kind of fucked me up, so she likes to make sure I'm coping. Which is probably why she's concerned that you're not writing to her." Harry explains and Draco sighs.
They sit in the common room for an hour or two, Seamus and Dean trying their hardest to cheer Harry up before Hermione decides a different approach would make Harry talk to her, which he does. They sit on Hermione's bed talking for an hour, about anything they can think of. Harry trusts Hermione and they always have secret conversations together, so he knows she won't tell anyone and she won't judge him. At around 11pm Harry decides he's exhausted and just wants to sleep. He bids Hermione a good night before going to his dorm.
"That and the fact that you over-exhausted yourself." She says sternly and Harry shrinks into his pillow. He knows she's right but he doesn't need Draco and Blaise to know how fucked up he is. Pomfrey sighs and leaves the potion on his bedside table before walking away and Blaise looks at Harry.
"You're not getting out of this." Blaise says, smiling slightly. Harry sighs but rolls his eyes and holds out his hand, silently accio'ing his broom, which flies right into his hand within around 15 seconds.
"Okay Potter." She looks at him for a moment longer before walking away. Harry makes his way to the hospital wing and sits down on the edge of his bed. He's not tired and he doesn't feel dizzy, he's just fed up. He misses Sirius. He wants to listen to Remus and Sirius tell him about his parents and the things they got up to, he wants to see his parents, he wants to hug them. He needs a hug. He reaches over the side of his bed, into his bag, and grabs the resurrection stone from the inside pocket. He lies back in bed, the stone grasped firmly in his fist, and closes his eyes.
"You're mad because you think Malfoy was flirting with me." She says and Harry rolls his eyes before looking back over the lake. It's kind of true but he can't let her know that.
"Missed you too." Harry yawns, with Draco in his arms his mind is willing him to fall asleep, safe and protected, and he's so tempted to give in. "You sleep at all?" Draco's voice is soft but concerned, how it is when he knows the answer and he doesn't like what it is.
"But that's when Harry got all dizzy and looked like he was going to pass out so we took him to the hospital wing." Blaise finishes and McGonagall nods.
Harry sighs as he rounds the corner quickly and ducks behind a statue, watching as the group of fifth year girls that had been following him walk past, trying to find him. He thought after the war everyone would leave him alone, but apparently he's more popular than ever. He broke up with Ginny a few weeks after the war as they both decided they preferred their relationship when they were friends as they had been a lot closer, like brother and sister, and it was easier to be friends without the added stress of a relationship, and ever since then nearly every girl, and a few guys, Harry sees seems to be either flirting or staring. He's sick of being the center of attention.
"Well yeah you but you've also been talking about how you would absolutely fuck him and how hot he is since you were 14." She chuckles and Draco blushes, glad the people near them are loud enough that they drown out their conversation.
"I'm joking babe." He says, leaning close so his lips are almost touching Dracos. "There's no way I'm sharing you." Harry murmurs against his lips and Draco wraps his arms around Harry's waist as he presses their lips together.
"Let's take them to our dorm so we don't disturb McGonagall." Harry says, he knows once he watches one he'll want to watch them all, at least 5 times over. Draco agrees so Harry closes the case and casts a wandless, silent charm to make the case and the pensive float ahead of them. They walk to their dorm without being interrupted, its nearly midnight now so everyone's in bed, and Harry places the case on his trunk and lets the pensive float in the middle of the room.
"C'mon Potter, he's had a thing for you for ages. Blaise said when you practised together it was ridiculously obvious." Draco is pouting again by the end of it and Harry grins.
"So she knew I had almost killed her only child and she still saved me?" Harry asks and Draco grabs Harrys shoulders, forcing him to look at him.
"Well I would quite like to eat." Draco says, hoping Harry will agree to go to lunch. Harry pouts and Draco shakes his head with a small smile, standing up.
"Don't be sorry, son. We'll always be here for you. We are so proud of you. Keep the stone, Harry. Use it if you need us." He says and Harry nods. He knows he can't keep them here for too long so he says goodbye. Just before he lets them go, however, Fred pulls him into another hug.
"Am I wrong?" He asks but Ron shoots him a glare from his place next to Dean and Seamus stops laughing.
"Harry?" Blaise asks and Harry sighs. Blaise won't lecture him as much as McGonagall, probably, but he could still have done without the interruption.
"Alright!" Seamus and Dean call from Harrys right as they stand up, and every conversation stops at once.
"I slept in a cupboard under the stairs until I was 11. My aunt, uncle and cousin made me do everything for them, I never really had much to eat and they only gave me my cousins old clothes to wear, which were like 4 sizes to big, at least. My aunt resented me because I guess she figured I'd be a wizard like my parents and she was jealous of my mum or something. My uncle was verbally abusive and my cousin used to beat the shit out of me. The only reason I was allowed the spare bedroom is because Dumbledore made them treat me better, but they still triple locked the door every night and they put bars on my window. The only reason they stopped abusing me is because they found out my godfather had been to prison for murder and they were scared of him." Harry says and Draco looks over at him in shock.
"Alright guys, we've practiced our arses off the past few weeks and we are ready to destroy Hufflepuff." Harry says and everyone agrees as they walk into the middle of the pitch. Harry walks to the center and shakes hands with the Hufflepuff captain, Zacharias Smith, before mounting his broom and rising into the air. He sees Teddy on Hermiones lap as she points him out to him like she did in the practice, and Harry also sees Draco watching him intently.
"Hey buddy, I missed you." He says softly and he hears a chorus of "aww" from some of the girls around him. He bites his lip nervously looking back to Hermione and Ron.
"You going to be okay?" Harry glances out the window, spotting Kingsley waiting for him, a few feet away from Narcissa Malfoy, before sighing and turning back to Draco with a small smile, trying to look like he's being honest when he says yes. "I'll write to you." Draco promises and Harry nods.
"You okay?" Blaise asks and Harry nods. Blaise hesitates for a second before nodding, and him, Draco and Pansy leave the hospital wing. Harry knows they're waiting just outside the door, which makes him feel a bit better.
"They probably knew about the memories. Probably wanted you to find out from your parents' memory rather than from them." Draco offers and Harry nods, leaning into Dracos gentle touch as his hands run through his hair.
"Thanks." He mumbles as he walks past Harry and out of the store cupboard, his arm brushing Harry's on the way out and both boys feel a wave of butterfly's in their stomach. Harry grabs the scurvy grass and the rest of the ingredients before returning to his table.
You lot are so cute by the way, thank you for all the get well soon comments, I'm still not 100% but I'm getting better <3
So I'm not sure how many chapters this will be or how long it will be between each chapter is posted, I was going to wait until I had at least a couple ready before I started posting it but if I don't post the first chapter soon it will be deleted and who has time for that honestly, not me :') Anyway I hope you like this fic and I'm sorry if it takes me a while to update, I'm nearly 20 years old and I'm v v busy <3
"You can, you know." He says softly, and Harry frowns, looking down at him, having previously been staring out the window.
"I know it hurts, but- do the positives not outweigh the negatives?" Draco asks softly, "Because I can't imagine a pain bigger than losing you, but I also know that being with you and loving you is definitely worth whatever pain might come my way." Draco says, a blush spreading across his cheeks, and Harry breaks out into a small grin because damn Draco is cute and yeah this is so worth it.
Harry and Draco decide to tell Blaise first, mainly because he shares a room with them most of the time and he probably already knows. They figure the sooner the better, too, so they only wait until the next day. They're sat on Draco's bed after lunch, cross legged and facing each other, knees pressed together, talking about nothing in particular but holding hands, Harry playing with Draco's fingers again. Harry is telling him about Remus and Sirius, and Draco is looking at him like he hung the moon in the sky. Blaise enters the room quietly, but smiles when he sees the way Draco looks so entranced and happy and just so damn in love.
"They know. But it doesn't matter. Not to them. Not to me. The world isn't split into good people and death eaters, Draco. We all have both light and dark in us. What matters is the part we choose to act upon. You had no choice in the war, Draco. You did what you had to in order to survive, to keep you and your family safe. You're a good person, Draco Malfoy." Harry says, and Draco buries his face in Harry's shoulder.
"Going back to my dorm. Going out with the team tomorrow. Ron and Hermione and Seamus and Dean..." Harry pauses, blushing slightly. "Malfoy." He admits and Blaise smiles slightly.
"If 13 year old me knew what was going on now he'd probably die of shock." He says at Draco's questioning glance and Draco laughs.
"It will be." Draco confirms, wrapping his arms around Harry's neck. Harry takes a deep breath, wrapping his arms properly around Draco's waist, pressing his face into his neck.
Blaise finds Harry sat on the bottom step in the entrance hall fiddling with a book in his lap, his eyes red, bloodshot, and puffy, and he walks over and sits next to him.
"You can sit down, you know." Harry murmurs and Draco blushes before sitting in the chair next to Harry's bed. Harry tilts his head to the side, still feeling very dizzy and nauseous, but so he can see Draco. He looks worried and it makes Harry's heart flutter. Draco is watching him carefully, as if Harry is about to fall apart any minute. Harry whimpers after a few minutes and starts to feel overwhelmingly hot, and Draco frowns just as madam Pomfrey rushes over.
"Your handwriting." Harry says and his voice is quiet and nervous but Draco hears a hint of determination as if Harry has been wanting to say this for a while.
"Morning, Zabini." Harry replies just as Professor Slughorn starts the class. He tells the class what potion they need to make and lets them get started.
"You're kind of beautiful." Harry says, eyes full of love, and Draco closes the gap between them, and Harry immediately puts his hands on Draco's waist, feeling the soft velvet under his fingers.
"Winky, would you be so kind as to get Harry some lunch? And then make sure he eats it. He doesn't have to eat it all, just as much as he can."  Winky agrees and McGonagall nods, satisfied, before leaving. Harry sits and eats half of the soup he's given before thanking Winky and leaving the kitchen, intending on going straight to herbology, despite being 10 minutes early. However as he walks past the entrance to greenhouse 2 a hand grabs his arm and pulls him into it. Harry frowns and looks up to see Seamus.
"I get it. I was a death eater. I fought on the wrong side. They lost people. We fought in a war, what's a couple of hexes in the corridors. I deserve worse." Draco explains sadly and Hermione shakes her head, placing her hand on his upper arm.
"Harry you need to eat." Harry shrugs and steps away from the bench, not even bothering to answer before he leaves the hall. All he wants to do is go to his dorm and sleep, but Malfoy will show up eventually. But there is one place no one will think to look for him. Instead of turning right and going up the stairs he turns left and walks out of the castle.
"Anyway, I didn't do that. So I'm just gonna say it straight cause I'm not about the grand public gestures or cliche moments." Harry pauses and his eyes travel over to the Slytherin table and land on Draco, who is looking at him nervously. He nods ever so slightly and Harry suppresses a smile. The hall is dead silent, but Seamus and Dean are still standing with him and when Seamus knocks the back of his right hand against the back of Harrys left Harry snaps back to reality. Harrys eyes find Dracos again and he sees Draco take a deep breath.
"Draco only has 2 blushes. When someone mentions how in love with Harry he is or when he has to talk about him and Harry. And since Harry is right here I guessed someones talking about them fucking." Pansy says and Harry looks at Pansy, intrigued.
"Thank you, professor." Harry says as more students filter slowly into the class. Harry walks back to his desk and sits down just as Blaise sits next to him.
"Bit clingy." Harry mutters, but he's joking and he wraps his arms tight around Dracos waist anyway. Draco smiles and buries his face in Harry's neck and Harry wonders where all of this affection came from.
"I notice you're reading Jane Austen." McGonagall says and Harry nods again, watching with curious eyes when she stands up and taps her wand against a bookcase full of wizard books. The bookcase disappears and is replaced by a different one, and McGonagall looks at it for a while before picking up a book and bringing over to Harry.
Quick question... I'm kind of at a loss as to how I want Harry and Draco to get together, like, I've got SO many ideas, I just don't know which one to use and I need your opinion please!!!
I'll try and keep updating regularly but honestly my mental health is so messed up rn (despite your lovely comments that make me feel appreciated, seriously I love them and you) so I don't know what's going on.
"I'm gonna go to the library, gotta get some DADA work done and write a letter to Andromeda." He says, figuring they want some alone time anyway. He stands up and grabs his bag, flinging it over his shoulder and crouching down.
Harry goes for a run for the rest of period 3 and although it was only a 40 minute run he sprinted most of the time so he's panting and aching when he finally stops. He walks into the hall nervously, and walks straight to McGonagall.
"No, really, use mine." He doesn't want to admit it but seeing Harry sleeping so peacefully was so reassuring that he doesn't want anyone to interrupt him, and Ron's sure he was so peaceful because Malfoy was there.
"I said we should make our way to the kitchen." Draco says, eyes concerned, and Harry smiles slightly.
"Harry I am willing to give you some calming draught, but I can't give you too much. It will last a few hours, but then you will be back to how you are now. You need to decide if you will be able to cope once the draught has worn off as you will no longer be used to this." She says and Harry sighs. He knows this too. He knows if he gets rid of the thoughts and the fear and the pain for even a minute the second it comes back it'll be twice as bad.
"You're lucky you don't have to worry about my parents hating you." Harry mutters jokingly and Draco rolls his eyes.
"Okay." Draco says, shrugging his shoulder slightly so Harry sits up. They let go of each others hands whilst they stand up, and as they're leaving the hall Harry links their little fingers together and he knows how this looks, he knows what everyone will think and assume, but he doesn't really care. The entirety of Slytherin already think he and Draco are together as they know Harry spends almost every night in their dorm, so it's not like this will shock anyone. They probably expect it.
"Go to sleep, Harry." Blaise whispers before carefully getting out of the bed. Harry's asleep in minutes.
They leave for herbology half an hour early so there aren't that many people in the corridor. Harry sees a couple of second year Hufflepuffs further down the corridor and smirks before turning to Draco.
"I will allow you to go for a run as long as you are in the great hall for dinner." She says and Harry smiles.
Harry is visibly nervous when they appear outside the Zabini house. Narcissa offers him a warm smile and squeezes his arm, and Draco grabs his hand. Harry returns Naricssa's smile before turning to Draco, who also looks nervous.
Draco sees George sat with his hand on Harrys leg and frowns, walking closer and hiding behind a pillar so he can hear what they're saying. He knows he should trust Harry but George was looking at him weird and he's curious.
"Have a seat, Mr. Malfoy." McGonagall says, sitting at her desk. Draco sits in the chair on the other side of the desk and bites his lip nervously.
"I mean I'm the guy that bagged Harry Potter. People are gonna hate me. Then again they hate me anyway." He says and Harry frowns.
"Okay, well done everyone. You all did really well. I'll post the list on the common room bulletin at some point so keep a look out." Harry says before dismissing them and walking over to Dean and Seamus, who have just put the bludgers away. Seamus wraps his arm around Harrys shoulder.
He runs back to the castle and by the time he's back in the castle he's breathing heavily and has to slowly walk up to the common room. He showers and changes into some joggers and a soft hoodie before grabbing his sketchbook and a pencil and settling in a comfy armchair by the fire, starting his sketch of Malfoy and how he looked when he was looking at Harry earlier, glad that none of his friends are here to question him about why he missed dinner. Harry isn't sure where his friends are as he didn't see anyone in the dorm room, but he's so relieved that there's no one giving him concerned looks or asking him how he is that he can't bring himself to worry.
"Call me Michael. Now, where would you like to have our first meeting? Anywhere that will make you more comfortable?" Harry shrugs.
"Been thinking." He says and Harry realises he's gonna have to try harder if he want's information from Draco.
"Yeah. Tired. You can, er, you can take the book." Harry says, pulling the book off the shelf and holding it out for Blaise to take, and Blaise knows he's lying and he also knows that none of Harry's friends are here and none of them ever manage to cheer him up, so he knows he has to do something.
"Instructed by who? And why 21st?" He asks. It could have been Dumbledore, but what would he have to give him?
"You can sit down, Potter." She says as she enters the office. Harry sits in the chair closest to him. McGonagall is silent as she walks round her desk and sits down before looking at Harry for a few minutes before sighing.
"Don't give anyone the stone, Harry. Not Ron or George or Ginny. It will break them. Tell George I love him." He whispers and Harry nods.
"You smell like vanilla and a flower I don't know and some sort of wood, kind of like a broomstick but not quite, and a little bit like the air outside when it rains and you smell comforting and you smell like home." Harry says softly, looking down at Draco, and Draco is basically glowing.
"Not being funny mate, but what the fuck happened?" Harry asks as he walks over to Ron, making sure he's in between the Slytherins and the Gryffindors when he releases the spell. One of the slytherins casts a spell at Harry, which hits him in the back but doesn't do much damage, and Harry turns around, looking royally pissed off.
"Harry, I don't know why you're surprised. You knew you had to hold your breath for an hour in fourth year and didn't try to figure out how until an hour before you had to do so." Hermione says and Harry rolls his eyes, shoving a chip in his mouth.
"I'm fine, keep going." He says before kissing Harry again when he hesitates. Harry continues pushing his finger in until it's fully in and he lets Draco adjust before pumping his finger in and out, curling it slightly until Draco grips Harry's forearm and hand tightly and lets out a loud moan. Harry smirks against Draco's lips; he loves that he can make Draco make those noises. He continues to brush his finger over Draco's prostate and it's not long before he has 3 fingers in Draco, continuously hitting his prostate which is making Draco shake with pleasure as a string of 'fuck, Harry, fuck, fuck' leaves his lips.
"Alright, you stay here and I'll get the ingredients." Blaise stands up and Harry still isn't sure what they're actually meant to be making. Are they making a pepperup potion? Or did they just have to write about it? He doesn't remember this essay being set. Slughorn walks over and Harry looks up at him.
"How did you figure it out?" Draco asks after a few minutes of avoiding Harry's eyes, settling them on the wall opposite them.
"Basically you can just talk, get everything out there, spill your brain, and I'll listen. I wont interrupt you. I might ask questions but if you don't want to answer them then that's fine. You do not have to say anything you don't want to, however it is generally best if you tell me everything on your mind rather than keeping things to yourself." Harry nods.
"I've spoken to Professor McGonagall and a few healers from St. Mungos. We think you have PTSD, Harry." She says softly and Harry looks at her for a second before nodding. It makes sense. Sirius told him that he had PTSD when he was in Azkaban, about the war, and then when he got out of Azkaban about being in prison. Harry recognised his symptoms from when Sirius would tell him about it.
"You are a person Harry. You bleed and you cry and you feel. And you were made to do things no one should have to do, and you had expectations of you that no one should have of them. But the war is over, and you're alive. And- I'm glad you are." And Draco doesn't know what else to say but Harry then holds him tighter and rests his head on Dracos shoulder and maybe he doesn't need to say anything else.
"Yeah please. I know people know I have it but I don't really want them to know what it is and stuff." Harry says and she nods in understanding. When they're changed Harry and Ron take their brooms back to their dorms and Harry goes to find Hermione who said she'd wait in the library. He walks in and finds her in the back corner sitting with Malfoy. This is an interesting turn of events.
"So Harry, how was trying to work with a baby and a Malfoy?" Ron asks as Harry lets Teddy sit on the bench next to him, holding the bear that had been in his bag.
"Er, yeah. Being forced to dorm together kind of forced us to." Draco jokes and McGonagall gives him a knowing look.
"Hey buddy, I missed you! Did you have fun with Hermione?" Harry asks before turning back to Hermione.
"I never hated you. I hated how no one hated you. I figured you would be a spoiled brat cause you were the chosen one, and it pissed me off." He says and Harry smiles slightly.
"Hippogriff feather." Harry murmurs and Draco doesn't even know if the fat lady heard him but she opens anyway. The common room isn't full but it's not empty either, there's around 12 kids sat around working or chatting, and when Draco enters the common room they all watch him carefully, until they realise he's supporting Harry, when they promptly mind their own business.
Draco leaves to get ready as he didn't bring any clothes with him, and Harry sighs the second he's gone. He knows being vague isn't going to help anything, but he can't bring himself to tell Draco outright what he's so afraid of, because if he does, Draco might realise he's right and leave him.
"What makes you think somethings wrong?" Harry asks and Draco feels the sudden need to punch Harry in the face for being so fucking stubborn.
So the next few chapters are quite short like I usually like to have at least 1000 words per chapter and the next few are around 800 but they end where it makes sense that they end so you know, you win some you lose some.
"Then just stick with the others. Not too closely though cause Rhys definitely has a thing for you." Blaise says and Harry raises an eyebrow.
"You're the reason we're not in Azkaban with him." Draco interrupts, he stops walking and turns to look at Harry properly. "You're the reason I'm alive." He says, soft and caring, and Harry smiles slightly, looking into Draco's eyes.
Also fun fact I've been super sick again (what else is new) so I went to my GP thinking I have another chest infection and she said I have a virus (just like a common cold) but she thinks I also have asthma which... I mean it makes sense but surely they could have figured that out before the age of 20?? Anyways now I'm starting to doubt if I actually had a chest infection in December so I probably took antibiotics for no reason which sucks. And I have to have respiratory tests at some point to see how shitty my lung function is so thats fun
"Actually it reminds me that not every one looks up to me like I'm some sort of hero so yeah, when we're fighting too." Harry admits quietly and he opens his eyes and looks up at Draco to see his eyes focused on Harry. Draco feels trapped in Harry's gaze and takes a deep breath.
"Malfoy I have known you since we were 11 and never have you been like this. You woke up and asked how he was, you came with me without question. I mean I could be leading you to your death but you came with me cause I told you Harry needed you." Draco looks conflicted. Yes he loves Harry, but this is Harry's best friend and he feels awkward admitting it to him.
"To visit Harry." He says back just as quietly, not wanting to interrupt the lesson he was a few minutes late for.
"Draco he notices you anyway." Pansy says smirking. They're making their way to the library after potions and when they get there they sit at their usual table.
"What have you done?" Harry asks, half because he wants to know how much he needs to stretch Draco not to hurt him but also because seeing Draco embarrassed is cute and he wants to know what Draco has done.
"Wow, a Malfoy rendered speechless." He teases and Draco looks up at him, his eyes shining with what Harry is hoping is love, and his chest swells with joy.
"What does it feel like." He asks. He knows you can only feel someones magic if they are really powerful because it has a bigger and bolder presence in the person.
"You look incredible too, Pansy." Draco says before lowering his voice, "I'm still not sure this was a good idea."
"You're welcome, Draco." They stand a stare at each other smiling for a few seconds before Harry talks again.
"And then he was all 'well I think we should break up then' and I was like 'fucking finally' cause you know I've wanted him to break up with me for like 5 weeks." Pansy says and Draco rolls his eyes.
Harry is holding Draco's hand like his life depends on it. They're sat in a carriage on the Hogwarts express, Harry next to the window, Draco right next to him, and Blaise and Pansy opposite. They've been on the train for an hour, and all of them can see that Harry is not okay about going home. He's leaning his head on Draco's shoulder, listening to Pansy and Blaise talk about some party Blaise’s  parents are throwing over the Christmas holiday that they are both obligated to attend. Draco and his mother are invited too, and Draco is trying his hardest to get out it.
"No. You're cute." Draco blushes and envies how Harry can just say shit like that without so much as blushing.
"Okay fine. But I'm not letting it go." Draco says so Harry knows he's going to keep trying. Harry bites his lip. He's still confused as to what happened between Hermione and Draco, surely she wouldn't just tell him this without him asking. Maybe she was rambling; she does that a lot. But why were they talking in the first place? They hate each other. It did look like something was going on between them. Harry sighs and sits up. Draco frowns up at him and puts his hand on Harry's hip.
"As if you could find a better keeper." Rhys says just as the final few arrive. Blaise, who had been watching the interaction between Harry and Rhys closely and not liking it at all because they're far too close and Draco is his best friend and he really would love it if Harry and Draco got together and if Rhys gets in the way that won't happen, moves so he's next to Harry before addressing the two teams.
"We turned up for practice and the Slytherin team was there too and apparently they had arranged a joint practice."
"I'll see you later Potter." He whispers before leaving the room. Harry takes a deep breath and grabs his bag before rushing to DADA.
"You sure you want me to come with you?" Draco asks and Harry nods. They both lean into the pensive and fall until they're stood in a front room. There are pictures covering every surface of so many faces that look so familiar but a lot younger. A young James, Sirius, Remus and Peter are sat across 2 sofas.
They chat through tea, Narcissa asking Harry and Draco questions, about school, how they started talking, how their relationship developed. Those questions made Draco blush but they answered them all. She asks Harry how he's been, tells him he's always welcome to come by the manor if he gets lonely at Grimmauld place on his own. Says he's always welcome to come by for a meal, stay the night, stay a few days. Tells Harry he doesn't have to be alone. Harry has tears in his eyes as he thanks her, squeezes Draco's hand under the table to stop them falling, and Narcissa smiles at them both and tells them for the umpteenth time that she's happy for them. After tea Narcissa tells them she has some business she needs to attend to, and once she's left the room Draco turns to Harry.
"You're always gonna have me." Draco whispers, and he means it. Even if Harry doesn't want him, as cheesy as it sounds, Draco's heart belongs to Harry, and there's nothing he can do about it. Harry shakes his head.
"I don't know. I had a bit of a freak out in history of magic, and herbology wasn't the best." Harry shrugs and McGonagall nods.
"So George really did knock some sense into him." Draco says, kind of bitter because he just wants Harry to tell him what happened between the two.
Harry waits until the last minute to get on the train, and he manages to find an empty compartment to sit in when he's finally said goodbye and thank you to Kingsley. He spends the entire ride to Hogwarts reading. He read a mix of both wizard and muggle books over the summer, and he's even read every textbook he needs for 8th year. Right now he's finishing Persuasion. Out of the corner of his eye he sees people walk past his compartment, looking at him as they pass, he see's his friends walk past, pausing outside his compartment as if contemplating whether they should enter, before continuing their search for a compartment. Harry knows how he looks. His black hair is still a mess, but it's grown and can now be pulled into a bun, granted its small and some of his hair falls out of it. He's lost some weight but gained some muscle because of his /probably excessive/ exercising so he now has an impressive 6 pack and some decent arm and leg muscles, so he knows his body looks good, but he has bags under his eyes that are darker than the onyx ring, passed down by the Black family for generations, that he has on his right middle finger. He is glad his friends didn't come in and try to talk, he doesn't know what to say to them anyway.
"Okay, okay, I'm sorry, I'll drop it." Blaise says and Draco sighs, looking back down at the potions essay he can't finish yet. He knows Blaise means well but he really wants to talk Harry and make him feel better and hopefully make him fall in love with him but he's so scared of doing anything wrong or messing up or making Harry hate him.
"Really. The world isn't split into good people and death eaters." Sirius says with a knowing smile and Harry nods.
"Not great. He's not exactly thrilled that I'm dating you but I think he's more mad that I told George before I told him." Harry explains and Draco sighs.
So this chapter is quite short but, like, not to brag or anything but I really like it so... I hope you do too :)
"I'll see you later, mate." Harry squeezes Ron's forearm gently in a way he's hoping says thank you. Ron nods to show he understands before leaving the room, knowing Harry is going to be looked after.
"I meant it though." Draco says sincerely just as Narcissa appears to let them know it's time to go.
"It's okay, Harry." He leans up and hovers with his face above Harrys and brushes their lips together. Harry wraps his arms around Dracos waist and rolls them over so he's on top. He kisses Draco on the lips once before moving down his body, kissing over the scars scattered across his torso, his eyes filling with tears.
"He's meant to be with Andromeda, what's he doing here? Is she okay?" He asks as Teddy's hands grip his shirt and he stands on his lap to look at Hermione.
"Sirius' cousin Tonks had a baby with Remus and they made me his godfather. He's like 6 months old now. You should come with me to visit him next time I go." Harry says and Draco look unsure,
When Harry wakes up it's to Draco sleeping soundly. The sun is shining in streaks through the window behind him and it's causing a soft glow behind him and he looks so peaceful and beautiful and Harry decides he's going to tell him. He's going to tell him exactly how he feels, and he's going to tell Draco how much he needs him, and then it's going to be up to Draco to say whether he feels the same or not. Which he doesn't, and then he's going to feel too weird to be around Harry, and then Harry will feel awful and he will have to stop sleeping with him, and then Harry's going to have to go back to having nightmares every night and he won't be able to cope with that, he knows he won't. Then it's settled.
"Worried about me, Draco?" Harry asks and he means it as a joke but he sounds curious and sincere as he says it. Draco is quiet for a minute.
Harry isn't sure how long he's been lying on the floor. He knows there's a few little stones digging into his back and lying on solid ground isn't comfortable in the slightest but it somehow makes him feel close to Sirius. In this clearing in the middle of the forest everything is peaceful all of a sudden; Harrys brain has finally stopped to breath and all he can hear is the rustling of the leaves from the wind and a few creatures that are walking around the forest. He can't hear or see any person or reminder of the war or his past apart from the clearing he's in that no longer saddens him, but instead makes him feel close to his godfather. The stars are shining bright against the black sky and the light from them filters through the trees and Harry thinks it's one of the most beautiful things he's ever seen
Draco walks over to Harry with a confused /and definitely not at all concerned/ expression on his face.
They decide to start tomorrow morning, as they’re both very tired, so they leave the stuff where it is, strip to their boxers and climb into Dracos bed.
"How you feeling?" Dean asks softly and Harry shrugs, pulling Deans arm further around him and burying his face in Seamus' neck.
"Is it about telling Ron?" Draco asks nervously and Harry shakes his head. Blaise was fine with it, and Pansy accidentally found out when she walked into the boys dorm room as Harry and Draco were kissing, and she was beyond happy for them. Harry knows Ron will take it well.
"So... she not even gonna acknowledge the fact that you're lying on me?" Draco asks and Harry looks from the closed door back up at Draco.
"I didn't mean to interrupt..." Draco says and Harry shrugs. No one has heard him play before, apart from Kreacher and Sirius, who taught him, and he's not sure how he feels about it.
"Thank you." He rushes to his dorm room, knowing it's empty, and drops his bag off before taking off for his run. There are students on the grass outside who watch him as he jogs past them, but Harry ignores them and keeps running. He has no idea what to do now. Ron is going to expect him to talk to him now that they've made up, and so is Seamus. Harry really doesn't want to talk to them. On Harry's second lap of the grounds he hears footsteps behind him and looks to see Rhys running behind him.
Thankfully nearly every student is in their common rooms or already in their dorm, so his walk back to the Gryffindor common room is a quiet, uninterrupted one. When he gets to the common room, however, he hears people calling him from all over the place, and he has to keep his head down and not look up until he's in his common room. It's empty when he gets there, which he figured would be the case, so he changes into some slim fit black jogging bottoms and an old t-shirt (again, one of Sirius') and takes off his combat boots, swapping them for trainers, before putting the book from McGonagall on the bedside table and shoving his wand in his pocket. He ties his hair up into a small very messy bun to keep it out of his face before he takes off down the stairs and through the common room. He jogs down the many stairs and once he's out of the castle he breaks into a steady run, deciding to run along the lake.
"Well, I tried anyway. He didn't want help." Draco mutters, before explaining the bathroom situation.
"Oh I will. You gonna sit down, Draco?" Draco blushes slightly before sitting on the chair next to Harry's bed.
"Draco, dear, I have listened to you talk about Harry Potter for 7 years. I have been preparing myself for this moment since then." She jokes, and Draco smiles.
"Seriously though." Blaise says and Harry shrugs, looking past Blaise and out the window. It's raining but not too hot. Perfect running weather. And Harry would kill to be able to go for a run. But alas he's stuck in the hospital wing until McGonagall lets him go.
"Okay, Hermione, Ginny and I will check the quidditch pitch. You three go check the forbidden forest. Send up sparks when we find him." Ron says and Seamus raises an eyebrow.
Harry stands him on the floor and passes him his present. Teddy unwraps it and sees a toy broomstick, much like the one Sirius gave Harry on his first birthday. Teddy excitedly climbs on and starts riding it round the room whilst Harry watches him happily. The broom only hovers about a foot off the floor so if he was to fall off of it he would be fine, besides, the floor is covered in thick soft carpet so it's a soft landing. Harry sits on the floor, cross legged leaning against the front of the sofa, and watching Teddy fly around catching the snitch Dumbledore left Harry in his will.
"Okay if I join you, captain?" He calls, panting slightly, and Harry thinks for a second. They can't do much talking as they run, so why not.
"For Ravenclaw, Jamie Dorling, Hufflepuff captain is Tara Freeman. Slytherin captain is Blaise Zabini, and Gryffindor captain is Harry Potter. I ask you go to your head of houses to sign up, and not the captains. I repeat, if you try to sign up by going straight to the captain you will not be allowed to tryout or be accepted onto the team." The second McGonagall stops talking people start talking excitedly again. Harry's friends look at him, a mixture of surprise and concern on their faces. Harry forgot that he didn't tell them about being captain. He just shrugs one shoulder and the second they are dismissed he makes his way to the library.
"I just want to everything to stop." Harry whispers, his voice broken and quiet since he hardly uses it, and Seamus' eyes turn sympathetic as he looks at Harry. He turns his body towards Harry and places his hands on his shoulders.
"You wanna talk about it?" Harry shakes his head before pulling away and looking Draco in the eyes. He can't say it out loud, but he thinks he'll be able to let Draco read it. Harry reaches under his pillow and pulls out his notebook before handing it to Draco.
Just then the memory changes and Harry frowns. Lily has a tiny bump and James looks slightly older, but they’re both sat on the sofa again. Sirius walks through the door, holding a very young, around 14 months old, Harry.
"He said he misses his godfather more than he misses his parents because he didn't know them very well." Draco says and McGonagall nods, looking thoughtful. After a few moments of silence she seems to make up her mind.
Harry sighs again and lets his eyes scan the Slytherin table. He immediately find who he's looking for. Malfoy is sat with Pansy and Blaise, listening to something Pansy is talking about but not really looking interested. He looks good as usual today; He's wearing a white shirt and some slim fit grey trousers, both of which hug his body in all the right places. He let his hair grow long after the war, not too much, just above his shoulders, but it's long enough to be pulled into a gorgeous messy bun but also looks sexy as hell when it's down. Harry realises he's staring and quickly looks away, directing his gaze to the table. He knows he has some sort of feelings for him, he's had a crush on him since 3rd year. Hermione is the only one that knows about his feelings for him. Harry told her just after he spoke on Draco's and his mothers behalf at their trial that he felt something for him that wasn't the usual annoyance. Everyone assumes Harry is straight because of the Cho and Ginny thing, but hardly anyone knows he's actually bi.
"Bring this one and we can have some fun." George winks at Draco before turning around and leaving, shutting the door behind him.
"If that's who you want to tell, then yeah." He says, giving Draco's hand a squeeze, and Draco nods.
"I can manage not being a prat for a few minuets." Draco mutters trying to lighten the mood and Harry tries to breath out a laugh but his heart's not in it and he just sounds tired so Draco just pulls him closer.
"Not really, no. Can you- I need you to come with me." Draco gets up immediately and pulls on a hoodie that Ron is 100% sure belongs to Harry, grabbing an extra one for Harry, before following Ron out of the dorm.
They sit by the lake, leaning against a big tree trunk and chat casually as Teddy runs around chasing birds Hermione has conjured and giggling. After a while Harry gets kind of sick of the fact that people keep purposely walking near the trio and staring at Harry and he swears it's happening more than usual. He voices his concern to Ron and Hermione expecting them to say he's imagining it and that he's probably too tired and stressed, however Hermione just laughs.
Harry wakes up at around 4am with a cry and breathing heavily. He takes in a deep breath before sitting up, wincing when his head spins. He looks to his side to grab the glass of water there and frowns when he sees his book. He grabs the book and reads the note that was on top of it. He's slightly confused as to who left the book. It has to have been either Blaise or Draco but he's not sure which one it was. Blaise makes more sense, but Harry would like to think that Draco is that thoughtful. He decides to read until madam Pomfrey comes over at 7am to check on him.
"I was telling Ron about Iris." Harry says and Draco nods, rubbing the back of Harrys hand because he's still not okay with that topic.
"Everything. Well, not everything. Me and Draco, how you and Hermione know. He isn't happy about it." George frowns and places his hand on Harrys knee.
"Hi." Harry says and he sounds tired and he looks tired and Blaise wonders if he's slept at all. Blaise walks over, Draco following behind him, and he sits on the end of Harry's bed, kicking his feet up so he's lounging.
"People assume I'm strong. They think I'm a hero. If they found out I have a therapist then they'll-"
"You need to promise not to make a big deal out of this because it honestly doesn't mean anything and you also need to swear not to tell anyone." Harry says and Hermione grins.
Draco is walking to lunch when he sees Harry for the first time since potions. He's leaving the hall that leads to the common room as Harry enters the castle, and when Harry sees him he walks over.
Instead Harry just alternates between admiring the view and admiring Draco as he writes. They sit there for half an hour before Draco finishes his essay. He knows Harry has been watching him, and the way he's sat so close their shoulders are touching meant he could barely focus, but he wrote a probably average essay and that'll do.
"A few years ago Dumbledore made Snape teach me cause Voldemort kept looking into my head and putting things there or trying to find information and I had to stop him doing that. Also cause then I could look into his mind and find out what he was planning or where he is and stuff." He's never told anyone that before, and McGonagall sighs.
"Mate, are you sure you're okay with this?" He asks and Ron looks up again, rolling his eyes, and he doesn't look mad at all.
"Around middle of August. A few weeks after I moved out of the burrow." Harry says and Draco bites his lip.
"Feel your magic in your body. Picture it flowing through your veins. Now imagine it intertwine with the happiness that person makes you feel and let that fill your body." Harry says and the way he says it makes Dracos heart flutter.
"Harry, my boy, are you coping okay? Is the workload too much? Do you need additional help? I noticed you didn't take notes today."
Draco wakes up first, as usual, and the first thing he notices is that his legs are tangled with Harry's. They've woken up like this a few times and it always makes Draco's heart flutter. He opens his eyes and checks to see if Harry is still asleep. Harry's face is mere inches away and Draco can feel his breath, deep and even, signifying Harry is still asleep. Draco leans back a little bit so he can look at Harry properly and smiles when Harry tries to pull him closer again, his grip on Dracos side tightening as he does so, and Draco blushes because now his entire body is pressed against Harry's save for their hands which are linked in between their chests. Draco forces himself back only slightly to prevent Harry from pressing against a certain part of his body that, if Harry would have woken up, would have led to a very awkward and uncomfortable conversation. Draco has found that he's had to avoid Harry seeing or accidentally touching that certain part of him a lot since they started sleeping together, but what he doesn't know is that Harry has the same problem. Harry's hand moves from Draco's side, falling so his arm is wrapped around Draco, and Draco freezes slightly when Harry's eyes start fluttering open.
"No. But I've never done it on 5 people at once when I'm in the middle of an emotional breakdown before." Harry mutters, his words slurred.
"Just glad I could help." Draco whispers and a piece of hair falls into his eyes and Harry brushes it out of the way, loving how soft his hair is.
"Yeah, I went to get him last night and I thanked him, cause he's looking after Harry, and, well, he didn't technically say it, but I told him I know he loves Harry and it's obvious and he just said he wanted to make sure he was okay first but like, it's so obvious."
"Come on. I think Kreacher took your stuff straight up to my room." Harry feels a lot less stressed now, so he squeezes Draco's hand and lets him lead him up to his room.
"Oh, and I'm hoping now that you're talking to Malfoy you're gonna do something about the being in love situation?" Ron asks and Harry rolls his eyes.
"We should probably move then." Draco says quietly, still breathless, but his arms wind further round Harry's waist showing that he really doesn't want Harry to move either.
"See you later Harry. Malfoy." She says before leaving the room, shutting the door behind her, and Draco frowns after her.
An hour and a half, and 5 (and a half) friendly games of quidditch later, both teams land on the grass out of breath and laughing their asses off as Will and Glenn, the 5th year slytherin chaser, argue about who fell of their brooms in the coolest way when they collided midair, both of them crying with laughter as they reenact it. Harry is laughing too, and although he's feeling joy he still has his usual depressing thoughts. Ginny doesn't know where this side of Harry came from but he's more himself than he has been in months and she really hopes it's not because of Blaise.
"Please don't- dorm." Harry mutters, and Draco really doesn't want to go to the Gryffindor common room but he knows Harry wont let him take him to Pomfrey so he sighs, half carrying Harry down the corridor. They get to the painting and stop.
”Alright then, how do I look?” Draco asks, both him and Harry looking over at Blaise and Pansy to see them already watching the two of them.
"Yeah, I just got distracted. Sorry love." Harry says, starting to walk down to the kitchen, and Draco frowns slightly but walks with him, squeezing his hand.
"So you've been here the past 2 days?" Draco asks once Ron has left, and Harry turns back to look at him.
"And what were you doing there?" She asks. Harry is fiddling with the drawstring on his joggers and he isn't meeting her gaze.
"I'm gonna need you not to be a prat for once." He mumbles and Draco doesn't really know what to do so he just moves slightly closer to Harry's side.
"He's Harry Potter, You think he's not gonna get some?" Pansy asks and Draco glares at her. He doesn't mind Potter getting some, he just wants it to be him he's getting it from. Pansy knows exactly what he's thinking from the look on his face and she smirks.
"This is my spot, Draco." Harry says, knowing Draco will get what he means, and by the look on his face he does.
Draco realises after an hour that he should wake Harry up so they can sleep in an actual bed and not on the sofa. He leans closer to Harry and moves to his ear.
