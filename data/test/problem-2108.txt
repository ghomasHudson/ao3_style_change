“I’d pick you.” Harry answers without a second thought, and Draco widens his eyes and looks away. He does that a lot, looking away – and Harry grunts. He didn’t realize what that could mean, he thinks that maybe Draco is thinking that Harry asked him on a date, but it wasn’t that. If he could choose anyone in the world to spend time with, he would choose Draco. He doesn’t know why.
“Each wand is unique, so I’m afraid you cannot have another vine wood and dragon heartstring wand anymore. I’m sure we’ll find one that will suit you even better, though. Things have changed since you’ve entered my shop seven years ago.”
“Right.” Harry says, but he has a feeling that Malfoy is lying. He doesn’t say anything, however, and the hours pass uncomfortably, their silence thick.
A coward wouldn’t reply to Potter’s note. But a fool would, would he rather be a coward or a fool? Afraid he could end up being both, he decided not to reply to Potter’s note, but to show up in the Leaky Cauldron the next day. He didn’t want to be a coward or a fool, and replying could make him feel like a fool, at the same time that not showing up was cowardice.
“What do you like about me, Potter?” Is what Draco asks, and Harry is taken aback, he doesn’t know what to say.
“Have you given back Malfoy’s wand? It’s no point having it now that you’ve fixed yours, right?”
“What?”
, they just used to be the one thing that made you stand tall. But you aren’t standing anymore.
.” He stressed the use of Potter’s last name, trying to get the world back to normal.
Harry stood there, still, not daring to breathe too loudly because it could ruin the moment. Draco had closed his eyes but Harry knew he wasn’t sleeping. He breathed heavily, though, but Harry knew.
They walk towards their room in silence when Malfoy suddenly stops.
, so I went to him after the battle, I looked straight into his eyes and I said:
“Harry.” He says softly. “Harry!”
I dance around my room and I put my hands  on my own shoulders and I pretend that that’s you there, dancing with me, you run your fingers through my hair and I feel myself blushing. You touch my lips, and my closed eyes see how your green eyes lock with mine and they see how you smile. I always open my eyes eventually and when I do, all I see is the empty space inside my arms where you should be.
He started to enjoy the cheap soap smell. Maybe Potter didn’t even smell like that and the room was only trying to make Draco feel something familiar. It didn’t matter. He was calm, and he was safe and Potter was breathing and so was he.
Should he reply? What would he reply? He admittedly wanted his wand back, but he couldn’t just hope that Potter would give it back so easily. That made no sense. It ought to be some sort of test.
“Yes, but please don’t ask anything that makes me have to deal with feelings.”
“Azkaban.” He breathes out, reaching out to Harry. He rests his head on the crook of Harry’s neck, he can feel Draco’s warm tears on his skin, and wraps his arms around his shaking body. He’s still holding the letter with one hand, the other clutching desperately on the fabric of Harry’s shirt. “Harry, he will stay there forever. It’s life imprisonment, and this time The Dark L– I mean, You-Know-Who isn’t alive, so there’s no hope for him ever getting out…”
“Took him where?” Harry asks, getting closer to him.
He takes Draco by the hand back to their room. It’s cold inside, he had forgotten the window open. He closes it and goes towards the fireplace to lighten it, and when he turns his back he sees that Draco joined their beds together. He meets a smirk on Draco’s face and sits by his side, under the blankets. He feels warm hands finding his, Draco gets closer, resting his head on Harry’s chest.
“Walnut and unicorn hair, springy, 12 and a half inches.” He said, handing over the first wand. She held it, but nothing happened. “Not unexpected! Try this one: cedar and phoenix feather, rather rigid, 11 inches.”
“They –“ He says “They took my father.”
“Are you kidding me?” Draco starts, grimacing, but Harry cuts him off.
“Say what you like about the moment we’re in right now.” He asks Harry, turning his head to face him.
Harry sighed and tried to remember a song. He thought of nights at the Grimmauld Place when Tonks and Ginny would set the record to play Weird Sisters’ songs and there was one in particular he quite liked. He started singing softly.
When he came back with Cedric’s body on his arms and telling that the Dark Lord had risen again, I held my breath, I knew what was waiting for me when I came home. I tried to warn him, I tried to get him back, to get him to me again, but of course he refused. That’s how it was supposed to be, everything about him made it impossible for him to ever want me – and still, I loved him. For every single thing that he was.
“I guess I’d write a book.” Malfoy says “And I’d go to somewhere warm. Perhaps Greece.”
Draco didn’t know how long they stood there, but he was the one to break apart. Their breaths still matching, he looked into Potter’s eyes. They were so close. And it wasn’t really Potter. It was an illusion. That’s why Draco kissed him.
“A school with a lot of teachers that live here.” Harry argues, “I’m certain they have wine. Or firewhisky. Or gin. I have always wanted to prove gin.”
“If you want, but also your biggest secret.”
“What are you doing here?”
He sits under his favourite tree, where he, Ron and Hermione used to come during sunny evenings to study. Well, who did the studying was mostly Hermione. Harry looks over at the surface of the lake, he can’t figure out why he had left Draco by himself, but there’s something full of anger inside of him. He can’t help but to feel that Draco is somehow fooling him, it’s like he had answered far more questions about Draco, as if he had been way more honest with Draco than he was to him.
The Yule Ball came and I knew he wouldn’t ask me, but I imagined how it would feel to have those green eyes glued on me as he asked me, how it would feel to have his hand wrapped around mine. I heard him telling to Weasley that he’d rather have the dragon again than to ask a girl to the ball and my mood lifted – Draco meant dragon after all.
“I like your sense of humour, your socks and your hair.” Harry answers when he makes up his mind.
It’s almost midnight and Malfoy hasn’t returned, Harry is more worried than he should be so he decides to get his Marauder Map to try and find Malfoy. His well-trained eyes find his spot almost instantly, and Harry runs off towards the empty classroom Malfoy is currently hiding in.
(See the end of the chapter for
You were never mine, but I’m yours. You don’t exist anymore, but I’m still yours. And If I were there when you died, I would have thrown myself in front of you. I never thought I’d die for anyone, but I would die for you.
Malfoy’s laugh echoes through the room and it’s so alive and Harry cannot see his face because he is on the couch as Malfoy reads on his bed but it doesn’t matter – Harry can picture his face laughing and the tiny wrinkles that appeared around his eyes, and that dimple on his right cheek that Harry knew he would completely deny that it exists.
“I don’t know, Malfoy.” Harry answers “I guess I’ve never had too much time for dreaming.”
It was the fourth year and he’d face that ridiculous Dragon. For a split second, I thought he would die. And that terrified me, I didn’t know why, I was at the edge of my seat and then he wasn’t dead – he was incredible, I couldn’t take my eyes off him. That was when I realized that I loved him, but perhaps I had loved him ever since the beginning.
Malfoy’s smile is small, and Harry knows he understands.
“Miss Granger!” He said, taking a step towards her.
“It’s not my biggest secret that I like blokes.” Draco laughs, “Maybe my biggest secret is that… Ok, Potter, let’s play a game, alright?” Harry feels that Draco has turned around to face him, and he decides to do the same, the blanket on their laps now.
“I’ll tell you three lies and one truth. The truth is my biggest secret.”
“Like I said, none of your business” He replied sharply.
“Having each other’s backs.” Harry answers “And for you?”
“Tell me something you have dreamed of doing for a long time but have never done it.” Harry asks before Malfoy can say anything.
“Now that you have died and
“No.” Draco got away from him “It’s not you. You’re not the real Potter.”
“Right,” Harry snorts, “Tell me an embarrassing moment of your life.”
Malfoy is overall a very quiet person. But sometimes, Harry notices, he sings to himself. He starts off just humming a few songs, but then it develops and he is singing songs with full lyrics. He has a nice voice, Malfoy, a little lower than Harry would have thought, but it is nice to listen to. Always on key, Malfoy sings a few songs that Harry recognizes, a few tunes from the Weird Sisters that reminded him of Ginny at first – but then they didn’t. Malfoy makes those song his own. Harry even starts singing along after a while, and Malfoy looks puzzled at him. Harry shrugs, Malfoy shrugs back and they start singing together, their voices blending nicely as if they had always been meant to.
“Potter, you studied Divination, didn’t you?”
And I wanted to hold him tight, to tell him he’d never lose me, I’d always be his and no one else’s and perhaps that was a side effect of my desperation, yes, perhaps I was just clinging to the only light I could see but the truth was that there had never been a light so bright as him in my life. He blinded me for everything else.
“I’m well. Rebulding. What can I do for you today?”
“Potter?” He says after opening the door. “What is your dream power?”
I was such a fool back then, falling in love for you in that way. I knew we could never stay together, I knew you wouldn’t look at me feeling anything other than hatred but I couldn’t stop my fifteen year old heart. It loved the way your hair glowed on the sun, those messy locks glittering with the light, your smile flashing from across the room. Never to me, though, but not even the self-centred person that I am could care about that. You were so warm, warmer than everything I had ever known.
so, it's finally complete! thanks for waiting this long, and i hope you all liked it. kudos and comments are always appreciated <3
Draco had read that note a hundred times. His brain had memorized every single detail of Potter’s handwriting, but he still couldn’t wrap his head around what that
“Happy new year, Harry.”
“Your opinion matters more.” Harry replies, his gaze on Draco is hard but he can feel that the other boy is ridiculously uncomfortable.
“Friendship was something that I always wanted, because Dudley didn’t let anyone be my friend. And when I finally got it, I couldn’t let go.” Harry answers “Friendship is like being a part of something. Something special. And you are at home with them, even if you are far away from home. Even if you don’t have one.”
Draco Malfoy, he could understand why. Garrick had been locked up in his cellar for months, but Draco had never been cruel to him. Scared eyes, brought him trays of food with generous portions and warming charms. Garrick knew that the Dark Lord was forcing Draco to use his wand to torture, but their cores could not be corrupted. He saw Draco grow thinner and weaker. One could lie to their family about their true nature, but could not lie to their wandmaker.
“Malfoy, I am real.” He said, “I was outside trying to break in and then the door opened for me.”
“It was during the 4
“Well, I’ll be on my way then,” Draco said. “Have a good day, Potter.” He strolled out.
“Yes, but don’t remind me about that.”
Potter stood still for a moment, but then he sort of patted Draco on the back and it was so unnerving that Draco started hitting him with his fists, but with his head was still buried on Potter’s neck and that was so stupid and Draco was feeling so tired and so drawn out of energy that he started sobbing.
We were at his house, it was warm, the light was dim but it felt comfortable, I was dirty and cold, he was there clean and warm, and he looked at me. He was so close. His thumb brushed under my eye, it caught a tear, my heart was swelling, he was getting closer…
“I have asked you that, you git.”
“I don’t know.” Harry says “I think I’d try to be with my friends as much as possible. I’d travel the world. I’d play Quidditch and I’d go to a Weird Sister’s concert –“
“What?” Harry answers half-asleep.
“Do you ever think of how would the perfect day be?” He asks.
“Well, sure Draco, but at least give me my wand. It’s a bore tending the garden without it.” She complained.
You don’t exist anymore in this world. Everything around me is a void because nothing remembers you quite like I do, nothing has you anymore. Your picture is just a faint memory, and it mimics your smile and your eyes but it doesn’t have you in it anymore. You aren’t here. You aren’t here with me.
Well, obviously, he had kissed Harry Potter, but
"I took them all. Are you making sausages?"
Malfoy was not looking at him, and was, in fact, staring at the photo. "Thank you, Potter."
"Oh, God," Harry said hoarsely. "What happened?"
Things only grew worse from there. Harry tripped over his own feet on the way to the fireplace, dropped his favourite mug, and watched it crash onto the floor, spilling coffee everywhere. He spelled the mess clean and cast an absent Repairing Charm on the mug, but he'd really wanted that coffee and hadn't the time to make another pot.
"I cheated."
Harry's frustration welled over. "Why?" he demanded. "Your
"You blokes a couple?" the driver asked, glancing up at the rear-view. "Don't worry, I'm progressive. Me nephew's got 'imself a man an' 'e's all right."
The two rivals relaxed slightly and Hermione began to chant. Harry waited until the proper moment and then picked it up, adding his voice in a counterpoint. Draco joined in next, adding yet another layer. Finally, Ron chanted in a fourth cadence. The words of the spell quickly charged the air and Harry felt a growing energy begin to crackle within their small circle. They continued the chant, building the power until Harry felt the hair begin to stand up on the back of his neck. The pressure became almost painful.
When he reached the security counter he took off his hat and dropped it onto the countertop. "Hold onto this for me, won't you, Mrs Dearborn? I'll be wanting it back, as I'm rather fond of that one."
Rosier's wand twitched to him. "Sit. Down." Eddie sagged into the chair. Tears slipped from both eyes and he seemed to be choking.
"Murdered? That was an accident. The whole building went down due to a stray Muggle missile. He was killed with eight other people."
Draco pressed a kiss against his temple. "Goodnight, Potter. The Weasels' room is down the hall and around the corner from mine. I'm certain you'll find it."
He didn't have much time to reflect after that. The matron seated him at a small table and then each person in line walked up with something clasped in their hands for him to sign. Usually it was a copy of his book, but sometimes they had photos or even clippings from newspapers. The first person in line was a blond man who grinned at him and placed the book before him gently.
"I am not!" Affronted won and Harry puffed himself up to protest his wholesomeness.
Harry wanted that smile back. And he wanted to keep it there for a very long time. He wanted it with an intensity that surprised him. "Well, then, we'll have to try and make this
He mentioned it.
Draco fought to keep the smile from his face. He had thought it would take him weeks, possibly months, to woo his way into Potter's bed. Now that he was here, he had no intention of being easily ousted.
when Harry was in danger. It was a curious thought. "I saw you cast one, though. Glad you finally found a happy thought."
Harry snorted. "Certainly not. I can barely tolerate reading the paper. I certainly wouldn't write for it."
Rather than pointing out the fact that Blaise had been the one wanking, Draco allowed his shoulders to slump as he hitched a half-sob. "You're right," he said, spinning the words into a high tone dramatically, "I'm a terrible person." He stood and walked quickly to the fireplace. "Forget I was here."
Eddie's voice became a whisper. "Harry. When you come back…"
"Great idea," Harry said and kissed him again. That occupied them for much longer than it should have. Harry couldn't seem to get enough of kissing him and Draco didn't seem to have a problem with it. Finally, however, Harry became conscious that his erection had grown painful and the friction of trousers and jeans between them was not at all satisfying. "Clothes off," he murmured.
"Yes, but not
"Yes," Draco breathed. He rose slightly to tug at the buttons, but Harry tugged his wand from his sleeve with a determined grin.
Mulciber's voice sounded again, but Harry ignored it, focusing only on Draco. Harry released Draco's legs and snatched at his shirt front, pulling himself between Draco's knees until their foreheads touched and their breath mingled.
Potter's tongue swirled over the head of Draco's cock.
"It involves a case." That was obliquely true, Harry rationalised and then he winced because that word would definitely not cause Eddie's rage level to decrease.
"Not once," Harry countered. "Where is Hermione?"
"Are we still going away this weekend or are you planning to cancel because of this
"As you wish." Quartermain strolled out. Draco maliciously hoped the lift malfunctioned and slammed the bastard around until he resembled mincemeat. He filed the idea away for future consideration.
Later, Harry toyed with Draco's ultra-fine hair as his head rested on Harry's chest.
Draco strolled inside and noted that, despite the rustic name of Shepherd's Farm, the place had size and elegance to rival Malfoy Manor. The exterior grounds contained stables and barns and carefully tended vegetable, herb, and potion ingredient gardens, but the house itself was a marvel of tasteful furnishings, rich carpets, and an excess of marble and crystal. Draco paused and allowed a moment of nostalgia to wash over him. How long had it been since he'd been home?
"All right. I'll take the lead and you cover me. We'll go in the front by the stealthy method of knocking on the door. It will be faster and less alarming if this turns out to be nothing. And Greta knows me."
he had agreed to the stupidest wager known to mankind.  Oh, right, because he had never imagined he would lose.
"So, Draco," Arthur said, "I hear you are working at the Ministry now."
"But Muggles can't see dementors," protested Timothy Clark, the youngest Auror in the room. He was a rookie, but his partner was a grizzled veteran and treated the boy almost like his own progeny.
"Angelina Johnson?" Harry asked.
"Great! I'll expect you in the morning. Got some new stock that hasn't been unveiled yet."
is that we have no idea what to do with them once we have them. Your beloved Patronus Charm does nothing but drive them away. Why lure them in only to scatter them again?"
"It was Dennis Creevey."
"It might have been something dangerous."
"Who the hell would go to Irkutsk?"
Harry swore again and sped forwards; he caught Malfoy with one hand. Malfoy's broom spiralled away, falling through the clouds. Harry's arm nearly wrenched from its socket and his hand was slipping, still damp from the moisture he had flown through. He allowed them to drop, pulled towards the ground by Malfoy's added weight.
"Here."
Malfoy shook his head. "Not for me. I'd been trying since sixth year. This was my only option." He shrugged. "Anyway, Potter, it's been nice working with you." He grimaced. "Not really, of course, but… Well, I rather liked being an Auror." His grey eyes, clear and honest for perhaps the first time since Harry had known him, shone with regret. And then the moment was gone and Malfoy was taking the broom from Harry's hand. He straddled it. "Goodbye, Potter."
"My, yes," Draco said in a purring tone. "If he's half as good in the sack as he is at ridding the world of evil… Well, can you imagine?"
Harry woke before Draco, who was sprawled at an angle across the bed, taking up quite a lot more than half of it. He had also kicked off nearly all the coverings, most of which were stacked on Harry. The rest were on the floor. Harry smiled and unburied himself.
"How old is he?" Harry asked. Draco let go of his hands and leaned against the stone next to him.
With that, Draco went out and Harry returned to the library. Hermione was already surrounded by open books. Ron sat at a small table in front of a game of wizard's chess.
Thursday, 1.1.2004
"I'm… not... strong enough," Draco repeated, but a strange expression crossed his handsome features and his pale brows drew down. "Fuck, that's not right at all." Draco reached out and grabbed Harry's shoulder in a grip that was nearly painful. "There is something else, Harry, something I can't re—"
He focussed on Draco's clothing to avoid meeting his eyes. Draco's Auror robes had been unbuttoned to the waist to expose a plain white vest beneath. Only twenty more buttons and the robes would fall open completely, ready to be pushed away from broad shoulders…
Blaise flashed a bright smile. "Draco might not know where he is, but he always knows where you are."
Harry’s bed was only welcome for a short time, and then he found himself tossing and turning, replaying scenes in his mind that could only come to a bad end. He heard Draco walk up the stairs and then the sounds of him preparing for bed and climbing into his futon. Harry wondered vaguely how comfortable it was and made a mental note to seek out a better mattress. Draco hadn’t complained, but then, he hadn’t complained about much at all, other than silly things that would mean little in the long run.
Harry carefully slipped off the last of Draco's clothing and paused for one final appreciative glance before dropping to his hands and knees to crawl between Draco's legs. Harry lowered himself until his chest pressed against Draco's erection. He slid upwards, trailing his body over Draco's hot shaft in a languid movement, relishing the velvet feel of it against his skin. Draco groaned and tucked his hands into Harry's hair.
"May you," Andromeda corrected. "And yes, you may."
She nodded. "Let us know if Eddie's coherent enough for visitors. We'll drop in as soon as he's awake enough to appreciate company."
Draco reached in to the dark space and encountered a piece of parchment. The note was barely legible, obviously having been written in a hurry.
Harry's hips shifted upward, unconsciously driving himself deeper into Draco's hot mouth, but Draco's hands clamped abruptly onto his hips, stopping that nonsense. Harry whimpered and his fingers dug into the thick fibres of the carpet, desperately seeking purchase in an attempt to hold himself still.
Harry drifted his fingers through the silken hair at Draco's nape, just below the waterline. "Yeah, I think this should be a vital part of bath time from now on. If Pansy is moving in, does that mean you'll be staying as well?" Harry tried to keep the question casual, but his heart froze up in anticipation of the answer. He'd been serious in the mirror room when he'd told Draco he didn't want him to disappear, but we wasn't certain if Draco's reply had been given in the same spirit.
"Of course I will. Someone has to be there to identify Rosier."
Draco nodded. "Pansy always knew, of course. It amused her to role-play as my girlfriend. I think she secretly enjoyed the power she possessed, not only knowing that she kept unwanted female attention from me, but also shackled any attempts by boys to get into my pants. Everyone in school thought I was straight, and taken." He shrugged. "I've always known my role, regardless. I shall marry and carry on the Malfoy name." The last was recited with a twist of bitterness that he couldn't hide.
Draco smirked.
No sign of Caesar. I'm sending a Patronus to Kingsley and going in.
She gave him an exuberant hug and Draco could not remember the last time he had seen her so happy. Potter had apparently been true to his word.
"Of course he's in danger," Tonks said dryly. "Every time he opens his mouth someone wants to put a fist in it."
"We can fit a dozen people under this."
The moment they stepped from the Floo into Harry’s flat, Draco headed for the hallway, intending to climb the stairs and lie down for a nap.
"And when did you decide to it was okay to call me Harry?"
After years of playing chess against Ron Weasley, Harry could hold his own on the chess board. He smirked when his white bishop bludgeoned Malfoy's rook until it crumbled into a pile of miniature bricks.
"The trail ended," Potter said. "They must have Disapparated again."
"We've set out some false leads for him to follow. He will snap at one, and then we will have him." Shacklebolt's confident tone was beginning to grate on Draco's nerves. Rather than prolong the torment of speaking to him any longer, Draco entered the room and spun in a slow circle.
"Read, write, speak. Yes, fluently. The benefit of a classical education. Lucky me to have tutors every summer."
"I thought you might want to take Roderick home," Neville said to Harry in an odd tone.
“That’s because everyone already knows he likes boys, Harry,” Hermione explained after his rant.
"I started to think I was in love with you," she blurted, Gryffindor to the end. Her cheeks were pink.
Seamus threw a sofa pillow at him. "Have a gay sex party. Godric, idiot, the
Despite the fact that the statement validated his own words, Harry felt a surge of disappointment. He tried to ignore it as he forced a return smile. "Are you going to let us into the bedroom anytime soon?"
Weasley nodded. "Yeah, she went to the Department of Mysteries to help them with some research thing. Cho stopped in this morning and asked her personally. Hermione sent me a memo." He puffed up proudly as Draco shot to his feet and Harry gave him an alarmed look.
"It's the weekend, Potter. Take some time off and do something non-heroic."
that had gripped him the instant Malfoy had walked into the room.
"He's loaded, hot, and actually seems to like you. What more do you want?" Blaise added another spoonful of sugar to his tea and yawned.
"Maybe it's aliens!" Paul shouted dramatically.
"Crazy," she repeated, "Like… dementors crazy?"
"Drink?" Draco repeated. "Libation? Beverage? Liquid refreshment?"
"Of course," Draco said airily and proceeded to explain how, which eventually led to a yelling match and Harry sank into a chair to massage his aching temples. The argument was nearing the name-calling stage when Harry finally stood up.
Harry gave his fingers a twitch and the wand sailed a short distance and rolled beneath the chair that Eddie was bound in. The man seemed to visibly relax.
Draco rested his head against Harry's shoulder and heaved a great sigh. "Merlin, I needed that."
Breakfast was a unique affair. McGonagall’s surprise announcement of the previous night was nothing compared to the news she imparted during the morning meal.
Draco rolled his eyes and walked into the other room. He leaned close to the door. "I'm fine. I don't want to talk about it."
"Is all that Malfoy land?" Harry asked following the dark blot of the forest with his eyes. It looked as wild and untamed as the forest at Hogwarts.
Malfoy made a sound of disgust, but he immediately lifted his wand. "
"What happened?" Harry asked, shocked at her venomous tone.
to think about alternatives, okay?" Harry gave Hermione a stern look.
would probably accuse me of lascivious behavior," she said and her voice rose toward the end.
"Next time, remember?" Draco replied. "Which will probably be in about… fifteen minutes, if your stamina is a match for mine."
Despite Harry's willingness to sleep the day away and awaken naturally in Draco's arms, a Patronus was more effective than any alarm at forcing him to sit up and grab for his glasses before remembering to Summon them from downstairs.
After leaving Kingsley's office, Harry headed back to the Auror Division and dropped in to Seamus Finnigan's cubicle. Seamus was just finishing up a report, so Harry waited until he rolled it up and tossed it into his Outbox, where it vanished with a tiny pop.
"You shan't," Malfoy said and kissed him.
Harry quickly backed away, holding up both hands to ward off Draco, who had obviously finished discussing his new servant. Harry tried one last time. "Draco, that is blatant manipulation. You can't just turn someone into a… a human house-elf."
"Fine, as long as you agree to be my date at said Ministry parties and similar functions."
"You're right. I might just carve the answer out of Malfoy's hide when I catch up to him. You may not know where he is now, but I'm betting you can find him. Are you a wagering man, Potter?"
"I detest being bedridden," Malfoy grumbled. His grey eyes sharpened and he looked at Harry speculatively. "Do you know anything about falcons, Potter?"
Harry had no idea what to say. He'd rehearsed such a conversation a thousand times in his fantasies, with every variation from indifference to hurt anger. The reality of the situation made the breath seize up in his lungs, and his fingers shook on the bookmark in his hands.
"Don't need that. Need DMLE. And Level One."
, Harry thought. Such assignments probably would have continued if not for Ron's conference and the dementor situation.
A single desk sat beneath the window, lit with several magical globes that hovered over the desk. Three of them brightened when Malfoy entered, casting a brighter glow over the desk, which was strewn with papers, books, and scrolls. Two comfortable-looking chairs occupied the space before the desk, and Malfoy gestured to one as he walked round to take the primary seat.
After that, he wasn't certain what to do. They seemed fine, merely asleep, so he went to the kitchen to make a fresh pot of tea. Anything to keep from sitting at the bedside wringing his hands with worry.
"You… What?"
Harry swallowed the mouthful he'd been chewing. "Delicious. Who was Jacques?"
Harry narrowed his eyes at being lumped in with Rhonestaadt. The man did not even seem to want to be in the class. Most likely he was only hanging round in order to... Harry looked at him more closely. It was entirely possible that Rhonestaadt had only taken the class in order to dig up dirt on Malfoy.
"With finesse, of course. I have pretended to have a change of heart. I'm feeding him information and in return he is learning to trust me. As a side benefit, it won't hurt a bit to have someone of Potter's status on my side. Think of the things I might learn during post-coital bedroom talk." Draco smiled like the Cheshire cat and shook his head. "Just the thought of it makes me all tingly inside."
Eddie had been about to speak, but his mouth slowly closed and then opened again. His wide eyes flicked to Harry and then back to Draco. One more prod of Draco's wand seemed to deflate his resistance.
Malfoy leaned across the table as far as his bonds would allow, as though imparting a dark secret. "Because Fenrir is planning to kidnap a child. Given his particular history, I assume the victim will be between six and eleven years of age. I also suspect it will be the child of a Ministry employee, since I've spent the past few days analysing the data."
Lastly, his thoughts kept returning to Malfoy’s words.  “I’ll be watching.”  Harry had been going spare trying to think of what Malfoy might consider worthy of punishment.  Insulting Slytherins?  Bumping Malfoy in the hall?  Acquiring house-points for Gryffindor?
"It's similar to a Memory Charm, but we're not trying to modify your memory. We're merely trying to recreate it in detail and observe it."
“You heard me. Move in with me. I mean, you already spend most nights here anyways, and now that the rest of the wizarding world knows there really isn’t anything stopping us.”
“Harry! I wasn’t expecting you today!” Andromeda wandered over to the fireplace and greeted him with a warm hug.
“She’s working on a new proposal, actually. Something about restructuring departmental classifications. It sounded really good when she said it.”
“Harry,” Draco murmured, walking back to the bed and slipping under the warm covers.
“There’s Veritaserum in the soup!” she exclaimed, with the air of someone yelling “Eureka!” You could hear so many spoons clattering down at that exact moment, it was almost comical.
“Potter. Thank you. For speaking at my trial, and my mother’s. I- I can’t imagine where I would be right now without that.” His voice was low and genuine.
“I, uh, don’t really know,” was the best he could come up with.
Harry was exhausted just thinking about it.
“I forgot about the badges!” Ron said excitedly.
He snapped back to life. “What? Oh, he didn’t put his name in.”
Andi raised an eyebrow at him from where she was frying mince. They’d become quite close through their mutual love for Teddy, and she could always read him far too well. “What about him?” she asked sweetly.
“Oh my fucking god Seamus, I am extremely in love with you,” blurted Dean Thomas from just down the table. Harry and Ron shared confused looks, whilst Hermione just rolled her eyes.
“Oh good, Potter’s here. I was hoping for some kind of drama tonight,” said Pansy.
“It’s quite apparent. You did make a rather big fuss about it.”
Harry was surprised at how much he had changed. Draco seemed to really want to help people, and he was shocked to discover how much he actually enjoyed being in the Slytherin’s company when insults weren’t being hurled. He stuck around for a cup of tea and biscuits after dinner, enjoying the atmosphere.
“How’s Hermione?” Harry asked.
“Uh, yeah,” Harry continued feebly. “And I guess that I... um, kind of feel the same way about you.”
“So? Did you get it?” she squealed.
Draco scoffed. “I’ll say. The only thing overshadowing your tardiness is those god awful robes. Really, did you find them on the floor?”
Draco gave in and smiled at his boyfriend. From close up like this, Harry could spot a shooting star streaking over the shoulder of his robes. “So, what brings you over here?” he asked.
Draco gave the password to enter the Slytherin common room, still dazed.  He clambered through in a manner devoid of his usual grace, and was immediately accosted by Pansy.
“We made the first page of the Prophet.”
Harry had paused in the doorway.
Draco saw red and he nearly leapt from the chair, but he forced himself to remember the purpose of his visit. He relaxed back into his seat on willpower alone and smiled, even though it felt like the false grin on a caricature of death. "My father is not a topic open for discussion. We were talking about how you were made aware of the location of the safe house in Wales."
Croaker smiled lazily and nodded at Harry. There was something about the man that made Harry uncomfortable, although he felt that way about
Harry admired his pale lashes and then took the tray and set it aside. "Sleep now. I'm going to rest in the other room and then I'll go out and get you some potions and some more food. And here, put this on your bruises first." Harry handed him the jar.
They sat in the living room of the tent and Harry tried to assimilate Draco's plan.
Seamus had given him a commiserating pat on the shoulder and then they had all taken turns in the bathroom taking photos of their dicks and sending them off to the Cock Critiquer before they could sober up enough to change their minds.
Potter grinned and Draco went upstairs. He climbed into bed and dreamt of cloud beasts with green eyes and black hair.
Harry cursed the interruption for a long time before making his way back to his office.
Potter lounged on a black motorcycle parked on the other side of the street. His eyes were fixed on Draco with an intensity that nearly took Draco's breath away. Bloody hell, Potter had changed. He wore a dark green shirt similar to the Muggle t-shirt Draco wore. It was pulled tight across the corded muscles of Potter's shoulders and accented his biceps.
Draco sighed with disappointment. "You yell at everyone, Potter. It's a Gryffindor trait, I believe. I see I shall have to get my own revenge."
." Additionally, his Auror robes were ruined. He would have to drop them off at the Magical Uniform Assignment and Repair Department and face the censoring stare of the Head Seamstress.
"Good," Hermione said and gave him a sturdy clap on the shoulder. "Off you go."
Weasley barked a laugh. "You're dreaming, Malfoy. We're not fetching anyone. You'll talk to us and you'll do it now." He pulled a vial from his Auror robes and placed it on the table.
Watching him, Draco was struck with an epiphany. He suddenly realized exactly what he'd been missing in the past three years. Passion. In the past three minutes, Draco had experienced uncertainty, anger, pride, superiority, curiosity, and interest. It occurred to him that he'd missed the rush and interplay of emotion that had always plagued him around Potter. Bloody hell…
"Harry," he corrected.
Ron muttered under his breath, but he pushed open the door and barged inside, wand ready. Harry followed him in and stopped short, uttering a startled word.
"Don't bother," he said dryly.
"Well, you bolted before you were finished, and I thought you might like to continue where you left off," Draco said carefully and then smiled, because truly, the look on Potter's face was priceless, for all that it lasted a mere moment. After that single instant, his gaze became positively predatory and Draco felt a slight thrill of alarm. Potter slid off the sofa and actually
"Servants' entrance?" Harry asked loudly.
"We're not in that big a hurry," Harry growled, keeping Draco at arm's length. "We can fly back by broom, if you absolutely insist, but we are not Apparating. I nearly lost you once, I won't risk it again."
I've been trying to compile evidence against Jacob while keeping Ron from having a meltdown. Hermione's birthday is in ten days and as usual he has no idea what to do for her, which often results in him sitting in a chair in my office, near hyperventilating. Normally I try hard to help him out, but this year I'm pretty preoccupied wondering how to keep Malfoy's friendship as the case against Jacob starts to look worse and worse. I had to tell Hermione about how he provided me with Dreamless Sleep, which caused her to give me that sad/disapproving look she wears so well. She said he most likely did it to have blackmail material against me. I need to think about that.
fuck me," he said and went out.
A shout tore Draco's attention from the dead Auror and he cast a
things, and then sleep."
Bloody hell.  He had fucked Harry Potter.  He shoved his hips forward experimentally, driving his cock deeper, and felt Potter quake beneath him, obviously still sensitive.  Draco’s hands moved gently over Potter’s hot arse, earning a moan.
Draco viciously stabbed another hapless vegetable, imagining it was Stanton's smug face. Thank Merlin the bastard had fucked off to Belgium before Draco could hunt him down and remove a couple of extremities, or he might now be lamenting the quality of the food in Azkaban. Thoughts of murderous revenge had entertained Draco for months, and had led to him starting his cock critique column. Stanton had been a fan of taking photos of his cock, and Draco had posted several of the worst ones in the magazine with scathing reviews, knowing fully well that Stanton had a subscription. It gave Draco a warm feeling when he thought of Stanton reading about his pathetic, Troll-grade cock. Honestly, it was the one thing Draco didn't miss about his ex. Stanton's cock had been somewhat on the short side, and leaned sharply to the left, which had always bothered Draco's sense of aesthetics. Coupled with wretched picture-taking skills and the fact that he'd been a selfish wanker in bed had left Draco with plenty of ammunition with which to destroy him.
"Oh, shove off, he's still got his pants on," Parkinson retorted.
Harry practically gaped at him, astounded that Malfoy would make such an admission. "You, too?" he blurted before he could stop himself.
Second was Malfoy’s permanent smirk.  Harry supposed it was the same smirk the bastard usually wore, but now it seemed far more secretive and knowing every time Harry caught sight of it.
Harry opened his mouth to explain, to make excuses… something.
Eddie was not understanding.
Harry's breath hitched with a quick movement of his chest and then he was gone, stripping to bare skin before easing over Draco again. His hands touched Draco everywhere, sending tremours through Draco's nerve endings—God, but his skin was sensitive! Harry's mouth teased his again—a lingering, precious delight of a kiss—and Draco could not decide what was better: the kiss or Harry's hand between his legs. After a moment, Harry stopped stroking long enough to apply more cream to Draco's tight opening.
Draco sat back on his haunches, but he kept one hand on his beloved Harry as he sat up. Harry looked at him worriedly and Draco sighed happily as his eyes took in the cute crease that formed on Harry's forehead when he made that gesture. Draco wanted to kiss him again.
"Portable CD player," Potter said. "Sometimes Muggle technology beats magic."
"To the best of my knowledge," the doctor replied.
"You plan to purchase my clothing for this venture?"
"I know," Draco whispered. "It's all right."
Saturday, 31.1.2004
Harry shook his head vehemently. "Hermione, I never went to the library as a child. I don't think the Dursleys knew about books. And Malfoy is a pure-blood. His innate condescension automatically draws Muggle attention."
Harry hopped down onto the book and tipped his head as if studying the photo of the identical white bird. The avian creature in the picture flapped its wings and opened its beak soundlessly. Harry chirped.
"Did you kill him?"
He took the Floo to the Ministry and then went to his office to see if anything urgent had arisen. His Inbox was empty, since he was technically still on leave. He sent a memo to see if Kingsley was free. He was, so Harry went to his office and detailed Malfoy's information and suspicions regarding Rosier and Hermione. Kingsley advised him not to tell anyone else, since they had no way of knowing who was financing Rosier's operation. It could have been anyone, even those with ties to the Ministry. There were many opponents to the House-elf Freedom Act, and only some of those had been vocal.
"I don't know! Maybe it does! No one told me!"
"For now. He needs to get to St Mungo's, but first he needs to wake the fuck up and tell me how to drop this circle." Malfoy speared him with a silver stare. "Do you know how?"
"Sorry, Harry."
"My mum brought me here once for some sort of history lesson, I believe. Back when it was safe to Apparate. As if I cared about Irish history." Draco laughed. "I think I was eight. I remember being bored out of my bloody skull."
Harry lay back with a groan, knowing he was blushing again. Draco's words had left him with a discomfiting tightness in his throat, damn him. Harry was thankfully  distracted by Draco turning him on his side and pressing his body against Harry's back once more.
gay, Seamus." After the words slipped out, Harry wondered how to stuff them back in, because both Seamus and Dean stared at him as though he'd suddenly morphed into a Crumple-horned Snorkack. "Um…"
She disappeared into the crowd and Harry heaved a put-upon breath, immediately drifting back into his ennui. He began to sidle towards the door, heedless of Hermione's warning. He planned to escape at the earliest opportunity. Harry had nearly reached the portal when it opened and an elegant figure strolled in, arresting Harry's motion, as well as his ability to breathe.
"I didn't want to wake you." He felt somewhat cowardly about it now, truth be told, but his bedroom door creaked and he hadn't wanted to awaken Eddie. He'd also been too tired to think rationally and the sofa had looked welcoming and comfortable. "And I was exhausted." He still was, actually, and wanted nothing more than crawl back into bed (or even sprawl on the sofa) and go back to sleep.
Finnigan gaped at him. "How—?"
Draco took him back to the room where they had nearly died and they both looked at the empty cask. It occurred to Harry that they must have stopped the killing spell, otherwise Draco's first spell with Mulciber's wand would have destroyed him—not the test Harry would have chosen.
Harry's lovely mouth twisted into a moue of disapproval and Draco took several strides forwards and hungrily took Harry's lips with his own. His hands moved over Harry's body and dragged the shirt from his waistband. He pressed his palms against Harry's skin. Bloody hell, he tasted so amazingly good…
"Good. I just need to pen a quick message to Pansy in the event that Shacklebolt refuses to let them join me. Potter is a potential connection to me; Blaise and Pansy are a sure thing. I don't want them harmed."
Draco awoke feeling warm and contented. He tried to open his eyes and was rewarded with a lancing pain that drew an involuntary groan from him. Still alive, then. A movement beside him led him to deduce that he was also in a bed, and someone had just sat down next to him. That someone placed a cool hand on Draco's brow—the universal way to check for fever.
Draco did not seem to have any difficulty focussing. He pointed with his wand. Harry followed the direction of the movement and squinted into the fog. For long moments he saw nothing, and then he picked out a shadow, backlit for only an instant as it passed over a streetlamp.
Ron flushed. "I meant an Auror, or something. You know, someone trained to deal with dangerous situations?"
"Malfoy, your secretary said Harry was—"
"Damn you, Potter, I didn't want to come yet."
Draco glared at the large woman in the portrait. "Let me in," he snarled without preamble.
The word
"The vases are quite clever, actually. They contain a central chamber with a thin membrane separating it from the outer chamber. A simple spell releases the membrane and causes the two substances to blend. Rosier's intention was for the Blood Suffocation Potion to mix with Sulfuric Acid to produce an immediate and deadly gas cloud. The Weasley potion instead mixed with pure water to produce a brilliant shower of sparks. I assume it was fabulous?"
"Do you have biscuits?"
Jacob didn't reply last night,
he demanded for the nth time.
Tuesday, 13.7.2004
Draco crossed his arms and smiled. "All right, Potter," he drawled. "Whatever you say." Harry glared at him suspiciously and Draco laughed. "Seriously. Let's fly to Cork and you can decide from there. It isn't far."
Once in Gryffindor Tower, Harry's footsteps plodded up the stairs to his room. He froze when he saw a small, flat box sitting on his bed. He rushed over and shoved it surreptitiously beneath his pillow before Ron noticed, thankful that his friend had been walking behind him. Ron was intent on locating his Potions book and ignored Harry anyway.
After long moments of listening to a tinny ringing sound through the speaker, a voice issued forth with one word: "Yeah?"
Draco reached Weasley, who lay half-buried by stones. Draco gripped him by the lapels and hauled him partially upright. "Weasley," he growled, "are you alive?"
Curtis Laigle opened the door and gaped at him.
Harry snorted. "Everyone has happy thoughts. We just need to find yours." He cocked his head and looked at Malfoy critically. The man was rich, gorgeous, and pampered. How hard could it be to find something in his past that had made him happy? He had seemed pleased enough at Hogwarts, tucked between the bouts of petulant rage.
, walking out of Flourish and Blott's with Hermione. Photo-Harry laughed and Hermione gave him a poke on the shoulder. It was such a commonplace scene that Harry could not even recall the specific occasion. Had Eddie taken the photo?
"Bloody hell," Harry snapped, "why did I even think this would work?" He spun on a heel and stalked from the room.
"There is a chair at the Pasty Pudding marked with a deep scratch that they never bother to repair. Affix the plans to the bottom of the seat with a Sticking Charm. Someone will fetch them."
"Ze tables 'ave turned," Malfoy said in a terrible French accent. His hand pressed both of Harry's wrists onto the bed and his mouth seemed set in a permanent amused smile of which Harry highly approved.
Harry froze for a moment, panting, and felt Draco's hands gripping his thighs. Harry took a deep breath and began to move, lifting himself and dropping back, burying Draco deeper and deeper with every stroke as he watched Draco's gleaming body beneath him.
"Or you'll be sorry next time you come eat at our place," George added in a warning tone.
Draco saw Potter becoming more and more obviously alarmed and he signalled Pansy with a minute toss of his head towards Rosier. She strolled over and inserted herself next to Rosier, and really, the man would have to be dead not to spend a few minutes admiring her assets, while Draco excused himself to use the loo.
"Honestly, one can never trust an evil spell to measure properly."
"I can't get over it! Not this time!"
"Come on," Harry said and headed over. Night was falling, but if they hurried, they might catch the last vestiges of sunset.
"Too dangerous to handle on your own?" Harry snapped.
"Exciting. I'm off to train two rookies in proper Apparition stealth."
"I didn't say that. I will share my suspicions the moment I can give you something more than vague possibilities. I don't need you running around in a panic."
lips touch something that untold foul Muggles have pressed their vile mouths to."
Bloody hell, the stuff tingled wickedly, but in a very pleasant manner. Draco would huff a breath over his back every so often and Harry understood why Draco had been so wild before. Harry began to fear retaliation. Draco worked on his arms and then eased his way to the center of Harry's back. He massaged the balm into Harry's arse, though his long fingers stayed away from sensitive areas, even though Harry's legs were spread wide and he was plenty hard again.
"Bloody hell, Malfoy, you okay? You look…"
Friday, 20.8.2004
Three years ago, those words would have been true, but lately Harry had been wondering if he knew anything about anything, especially in regards to how he felt about just about everyone ever. “I don’t even know you, Malfoy, and I’m tired of trying to speak Italian. Come and sit down. I’ll even let you insult me.”
It had been the wrong thing to say, of course. Draco's grey eyes, warm and soft with passion only minutes before, flashed with fury. "That bigoted, narrow-minded dead man was
Malfoy shrugged. "I hate myself most of the time, anyway. Come and dance with me." He gripped Harry's hand as he left the stool, tugging him to his feet.
to extend an olive branch of friendship.
“Don’t think you’re getting out of it,” Hermione warned. “This will be good for all of us. We need some cheer.”
"We believe he might be in danger," Potter said.
Draco pushed himself to his feet and picked up Crabbe's wand. Draco had dropped it during his angry tirade. A few flicks and swishes later and he was free of the chains and in possession of a different, and far more receptive, wand.
Draco glanced down at Weasley and then smirked at Crabbe. "I might have need of this one later. You're not getting in, Virgil. Cut your losses and go."
"More than anything."
Harry bit back a number of retorts. "Nearly useless," he admitted. "How was your
Harry glanced up and met Malfoy's frigid stare. He had apparently heard her, and either disagreed or wanted her to remain silent. For a moment, Harry thought he would deduct house points from the both of them, and then had to smile as he wondered what sort of points Malfoy planned to deduct. As Malfoy pointed out a minute adjustment in one of Henrietta's photos that would have brought the image into greater symmetry, Harry decided it wasn't the proper to time to ask.
"Did you sleep?" Draco asked.
"If you'll come with me, madam, I'll take you to Auror Headquarters where you can await word of your husband. We have sent someone to look for him and you may be able to help with that."
Harry cleared his throat. "Hello. I'm here to look into your available classes."
"Drowning, I think." His voice was quiet and subdued—so utterly un-Malfoy-like that Harry looked at him sharply. The proud shoulders were slumped and rain dripped from the tips of his nose and chin into his lap, unnoticed. Something was obviously bothering him.
Malfoy shoved Mary forward and leaped aside as the doors began to close. Harry cursed and sent three more spells at him, but scored only a hit on Malfoy's upper thigh.
Harry did as Ron bid and it was only a short jump onto the platform. When it started to descend, Ron scooted backwards until his weight cancelled Harry's. Draco went next, and Harry hopped to the middle portion of the lever whilst Ron stayed where he was. The three of them balanced carefully.
“Twelve!” Draco said and smacked him again.  The next three blows were similar, delivered upon different parts of Potter’s bare arse.  Potter whimpered with every blow and thrashed upon Draco’s lap.  His leaking cock smeared wetness over Draco’s leg.
“I don’t know what sickening spell you two are caught in,” Theo Nott said loudly, “and I don’t care. But can we get on with whatever we are supposed to be doing so that we can go back to our dorms? I have studying to do.”
Harry laughed. "Yeah, I thought I could buy a couple of lights and start taking great shots."
Sunday, 31.10.2004
"Into the light, Malfoy, where I can see you."
"You just don't want any more bee stings."
Draco placed his teacup on the counter, and then took Harry's away to join it. "Now. I believe you mentioned something about practice?" He moved into Harry's arms.
Potter flushed. "Of course you are. That's not…"
for six months?"
Turnabout is fair play, I think. I visited Malfoy in his office this afternoon and brought him off through his trousers. He pretended to be miffed, but that dazed, very happy look in his eyes negated his petulant complaints. At least I won't be fired alone.
"Er… I don't know. Is this a social call, or professional?"
" and "
"Do you like Mercury Horowitz? She's my favourite, next to Oliver Wood." Niall held out the action figure.
The unreality of it sustained him for the space of six heartbeats, while the pounding of his heart sounded overly loud in his ears. Their lips pressed together, not moving, barely qualifying as a kiss, more a smashing of lips, really. But then Malfoy moved. It was a tiny movement, a shift, or a sigh, or possibly a fluid shiver. Whatever it was, it caused Malfoy’s lips to shift against Harry’s, to leave a ghost of wetness, a mere hint of flavour, compounded by the feel of Malfoy’s breath wafting over his face. The combination was electrifying.
He started to speak, but then remembered that Malfoy had ordered him not to.  He weighed the consequences of his captor's annoyance against being spanked with a
“Gloves,” he said redundantly.  “You’re wearing gloves.”
"Every last one of them. I despised those creatures. My father doted on them. He could watch a Muggle being tortured without batting an eye, but I saw him nearly brought to tears when the Dark Lord incinerated one of his favourite pets." Malfoy rolled his eyes. "They were nasty and territorial and would chase me about the garden when I was small. I hardly went outside until I was old enough to hex them. Father never forgave me for disliking them. It was one of many points on which we disagreed."
"Tonks will sleep until dinnertime if I let her," Remus said. "And then she wants to stay up all night long. It takes a toll on an old man like me."
"Every night. It's great for the gluteus maximus. You should try it."
"I apologize for my behaviour at the Quidditch Gala. It was unconscionable."
He stepped close to Potter again and took his left bicep in a tight grip as he drew his wand with his left hand. Pansy grabbed Draco's arm.
The male Slytherins wore cute Santa dresses, bright red, with white fur trim edged in large bands of gold. Tiny halter vests covered their torsos—barely—and jaunty Santa hats with white and gold tassels perched atop their heads. The lone girl Slytherin had grown antlers and also wore a harness with bells.
“You saved me from being trampled by oversized treats?” Harry asked stupidly. Malfoy nodded. “Why?”
"I suppose, yes. We're always together now."
, Harry's brain supplied unhelpfully.
Harry tugged at his tie for the fifteenth time and wished he knew a spell to keep the bloody thing from flopping sideways. Whose bright idea had it been for him to wear a bow tie, anyway? Oh yes, Hermione's. He shot her a glare from across the room, but she was in a discussion with Kingsley that involved much arm-flailing and drink waving (and probably featured house-elves or goblins) and did not notice him. Harry quickly looked away before Ron caught his eye. Harry did not want to be blamed for aiding and abetting in Ron's escape.
"A very short bath," Harry agreed with a grin.
"Do you happen to have a camera?" Malfoy asked in a sly tone.
"You read Greek?" Harry asked in surprise.
"Lay off, Hermione," Ron said in a bored tone. "Can't you tell he's in love?"
. Right."
Dinner at Hermione's was awkward tonight with the three of us talking about everything but Malfoy. I could tell they wanted to ask, but I brought up details of the nogtail case and interesting facts about Denmark every time they opened their mouths. Frankly, I'm done with Malfoy and don't want to talk about him again.
"Mulciber."
, he noted, eyeing the tracing of hair that led from the waistband to the edge of the photo,
This has been my quietest birthday since my Dursley days. Malfoy said he'd originally planned an outrageous party that would have been so flashy and glitzy I would have loathed it, but "of course I had to go and spoil his plot, as usual" so we had a small gathering at mine, instead. I'm glad St Mungo's let me out, at least, although my healer was adamant about coming over and ransacking the place for any residual Dreamless Sleep. I should be grateful she's concerned, but mostly I'm annoyed. Malfoy kept watching me during the party and I'm not sure what to make of it. Thankfully, Jacob had to work. I'm not sure I could have tolerated him in my current state.
His attention returned to the photo and he studied it with a critical eye. He had thought the natural lighting would add drama to the photo, but the critique was right, it seemed too harsh to add any sense of romance, and the strong lines of it pulled the eye to the top of the frame. He sighed.
"That's great news!" Ron burst out.
"We have an agreement, so I will remind you to keep your
"Damn you, Harry, what have you done?" Somehow, Harry had saved him. Harry and his goddamned… what did Hermione always call it? His "saving people thing." Even when people did not
Although he had never thought about having sex with a man before, now it seemed he could think of nothing else. He pictured Malfoy pushing him up against the sink and cupping his cock with a hand. Harry thought about fisting his hands in Malfoy's hair and pressing biting kisses into his throat.
, which would have been a disturbing thought if his world wasn’t centred on his erogenous zones and his overwhelming need for release.
"Financiers, plural?" Hermione sipped at her tea. She looked more uncomfortable than Malfoy, even though she sat in her own favourite chair across from him.
Harry smiled and leaned into his boyfriend for a kiss, avoiding the camera slung around his neck. "You're terrible."
Draco grinned hugely. "Do you like it?" he asked seductively.
Two doors led from the room and Malfoy strode to the right-hand portal. "In here, Potter."
" Harry threw himself between Draco and Ron, just in case, and he grabbed at Draco's wrist to stop him from doing anything else unexpected. Draco did not resist.
Potter frowned. "There is a World Wizarding Museum?"
Harry did as bid, padding across the room in his bare feet, and wished the place had some form of carpeting. He stopped next to Malfoy, who smirked at him, looking more handsome than ever before. Harry decided that cock sucking had a remarkable effect on someone’s attractiveness.
ooOoo
Days off are going to be rare for a while, so I'm savouring this one. Going to play charades at the Burrow and watch George try to slip experimental sweets into Ron's drink.
"Gryffindor luck."
Reddish tiles lifted off the nearby roofline as Clark's Patronus exploded from the end of his wand. Malfoy shouted, the words lost to Harry, directed at Clark. Harry watched with horror as roofing tiles and larger bits flew through the air towards Clark, who paid no attention, lifting his wand in victory as the dementor fled. Harry was too far away to assist. He felt like he was flying through heavy syrup, battling the wind as he watched Malfoy fly at breakneck speed towards Clark, who hovered in the path of the falling debris, oblivious. Malfoy cast a spell; it deflected some of the roofing pieces, but not all.
"Always. You got that Portkey handy?"
With a light step, Draco left the panting Gryffindor behind.
"Isn't that what you're going to do?"
"Malfoy?"
Harry gazed at him over the rim of the cup. Steam spiralled up and fogged his glasses. There were so many answers to that question. At first it had been simple attraction, but now it was the way Draco smiled, the way his eyes lit up when he talked about tea, the way he sat on the sofa with his bare feet curled under himself, the way his eyes narrowed and his teeth nibbled his lower lip when playing chess, it was his laugh, and his blond hair forever catching on his lashes…
"Praying won't help you, Potter." Draco laughed.
"A friend. Should I be jealous?"
Harry assessed the situation. Two of Crabbe's people stood between Harry and a clear shot at Crabbe; Quentin Quartermain's Levitated body hovered behind them, and a small sound indicated that Quartermain was coming out of the Stunner.
"My surname. I should have told you before. A shipment of what?"
"You are in protective custody. I would like to assure that you remain here."
Harry looked skyward. The dementors had broken up and were drifting away. The other four Aurors circled lazily, casting Patronus Charms at stragglers. Harry picked up his broom. They would have to patrol the area carefully for some time, to make sure none of the creatures dropped down and attacked unsuspecting Muggles.
) and more kissing until they finally pulled away, shock and lust mirrored in each other's eyes.
"Happy thought, happy thought," he muttered and let his broom fall, luring the dementor after him while Harry collected his thoughts. He remembered the time they had been at the Leaky and Ron had laughed so hard he had shot ale from his nostrils. "
"You can come down to Wheezes and take photos of the stock, Harry," George offered. "If they turn out decent, I can use them for advertising. Paid, of course."
"Homosexual, yes." Draco said it quietly, with a glance at the other tourists, all of whom seemed lost in their own admiration of the view. He moved closer to Potter, knowing Muggles had an even worse outlook on males preferring males than most wizards.
~END~ :D
"Incendio?" Rhonestaadt muttered and Gladys tittered. Henrietta made an affronted noise and patted Jason on the arm.
sound that Harry found strangely comforting.
"I don't know. There is something wrong about this, Harry. Maybe we should…"
"I know. I've had to buy six of them already." He would buy a dozen more if it meant he could see Draco Malfoy naked. The vest was still a problem, though. He lifted his wand.
"I'm sure you will," the man replied dryly.
Saturday, 11.9.2004
He heard Malfoy scramble over his thigh to slide between his parted legs. Malfoy placed both hands against his burning, flaming arse and pulled his cheeks apart roughly. Malfoy’s breathing sounded ragged and loud as he knelt behind Harry, looking at his most intimate place, probably
Harry reached into his robe and pulled out a silver flask. He unscrewed the cap and offered it to Malfoy. The silver eyes flicked to his.
"I, um…" Potter coughed and then pulled a wand out of his sleeve. Draco blinked, but allowed no other expression to mar his features. "I'm using yours. Sorry I never gave it back."
Unfortunately, "Old Jackson" had died during Bellatrix Lestrange's escape from Azkaban. Harry supposed it was one reason Malfoy had been adamant not to accompany him. He was related to some former inmates, mad or not. Many of the guards would know that. Regardless, Harry planned to repay him with an early morning visit. If he wanted a report, Harry would give him one, weekend or not.
Monday, 16.2.2004
Two Ministry officials were talking with Rosier and Draco sidled near enough to overhear them discussing the rain, a familiar, if dull, topic. He moved closer to Wells-Barton's wife, who looked as though she would rather be anywhere else on earth.
Harry scowled, but he looked away. He thought about Eddie and Draco's previous words.
Draco's smile widened as if he sensed Harry's thoughts—which he probably did. He stood aside and gestured at the front hall expansively.
"Yeah. And the thing is, maybe I don't want to quit. Maybe all this shite you've stirred up recently has made me aware that there are still horrible people out there, people that need to be stopped."
"A young woman, who appeared to be about nineteen with amazing thighs, according to him. Obviously, the perpetrator has a goodly supply of Polyjuice and isn't sparing in its use."
he yelled and cast. The dementor halted and floated where it was for a moment. The Aurors circled it warily.
"I was wrong. We're not on your side." Zabini's tone was derisive and the hex he sent winging towards Quartermain was just shy of lethal. Harry knew he should step in and stop the fight, but if Quartermain really planned to turn over Malfoy, then it might be best to allow Zabini and Parkinson to incapacitate him. Assuming Malfoy was still in the facility somewhere.
"If I do not have a cup of steaming hot, very strong, tea in my hand in the next five minutes I might actually hex a hole into that wall right there and hurl this desk through it."
“Visiting some distant relative. Or my parents are. I escaped, at least for the afternoon.”
"I suppose I should have taken that off."
"Who was that?" Ron asked beside him. "Where is—
"You hate kids?" Harry guessed.

"If you will observe closely, you will see that I have placed a slowing spell around it." Mulciber chortled. "Wasn't that clever? And very difficult, as you can imagine. The spell in the chest has been released, but it is expanding slowly—oh so slowly—outwards. Giving someone time… to… stop… it."
the cock critiquer." He shook the magazine. "I can't believe this!"
There was no response, so they walked carefully into the room, weaving between the mirrors. Most of them were self-standing, some on huge frames reminiscent of the ancient mirrors separating vast walls in Malfoy Manor, whilst others were shorter and two-sided, swivelling on pivot points rather like the lever platforms in the room they'd just left. Others simply floated in place, taller than Weasley, and each of the larger ones were separated by smaller mirrors, from handheld bits of floating silver to long curtains of Galleon-sized glass held together with strands of chain.
This has been a really eventful day and I'm not sure where to start. Jacob Martinson has disappeared. This happened early in the morning when we went to pick him up for questioning. Of course we went to Malfoy next, who said he hadn't seen him in a few days because they had broken up. THEY HAD BROKEN UP.
Eddie kissed him again and Harry relaxed into some light snogging, firmly pushing Malfoy out of his mind. They were still kissing when an owl tapped on the window.
Draco's pulse raced as Potter's soft lips nibbled at his. It figured the bloody Savior would even kiss fabulously and then it clicked—whoever had been in Draco's bed had
"Damn straight. Those bloody well
"Harry… Pansy told me the same thing. That Eddie was involved in something. She didn't say what."
Draco pulled out his wand and spelled the ties free. Potter immediately snatched up his glasses, left the chair, and bolted for his clothing across the room. He seemed as skittish as a wild deer. Draco watched lazily as Potter dragged his apparel back on, not even bothering to clean himself up--probably because his wand still rested in Draco's robes. It amused him to think of Potter returning to his dorm splattered with his own come and reeking of sex. He debated keeping the wand overnight, but knew such an act might be a deal-breaker for Potter. Draco instinctively knew he needed to find exactly the right balance to keep Potter in the palm of his hand.
"You look good," Draco said.
The door opened into mirrors. Rows and walls and windows of mirrors. Draco had expected it, but the sheer number of them was still something of a shock, or perhaps he was finding it difficult to think at all after Harry's kiss and strangely moving declarations. Honestly, Draco hadn't felt so giddy since his seventh Christmas, when he'd opened a particularly long package to find his first broom within.
, he told himself.
Before their lips could meet, a bang from the kitchen startled them both and Harry pulled away, eyes wide.
"Potter has been searching for a month. Do you really think we're going to find the answer in a couple of hours?"
"Top secret, I'm afraid. Shouldn't take long. You'll be home by supper, probably."
"Nice, isn't it?" she asked as she placed the tea on his desk. Before he could reply, she had scurried out.
Draco halted when he was close enough to touch Potter by simply leaning forward a centimeter or two. "Why did you kiss me?" Draco countered.
Harry forced back a laugh. "What about your second kiss? Or third? Surely you've had… you know?"
Potter followed Molly into the kitchen and beckoned to Draco. Arthur brought up the rear of their little train. The kitchen was large and dominated by a huge table. Ron and Hermione were already seated; Draco internally bemoaned the fact that he couldn't refer to Ron as "Weasley" when he was surrounded by so many, and that Potter would probably prefer he call Granger by her first name, as well.
Seamus pouted at him. "Dean."
"Crawl back into your serpent holes and leave business to your betters."
"Well, I am brilliant, I admit. Where is your lube?"
"You're a barrister?" Paul asked, eyes goggling. Angelique erupted into a fit of giggles. Tremaine approved of her laughter—it made her breasts jiggle in a most becoming fashion. "I didn't know! I am honoured to be in your illustrious presence! How does one address one of your esteemed greatness?"
Curtis shrugged. "Didn't seem that important. We never ran into dementors and in the rare instances we needed them for communication, Draco compensated. He's a master of improvisation."
Potter captured his lips before he could speak, and his hands caressed Draco's scalp through his hair. Hell, who would have guessed that would feel incredible? Meanwhile, Potter's mouth was doing amazing things. He sucked on Draco's tongue, making his traitorous mind conjure images of Potter sucking something else. That something else was hard as marble, and drew a sound from Potter that thrummed through Draco's blood like a primitive howl.
Savior of the Wizarding World—and take control in the process."
There was no immediate sign of a struggle, so Potter Aurored off towards the kitchen whilst Pansy lit the fire with a burst from her wand that nearly took out the surrounding bricks. She raised the hem of her robes to disclose her sodden shoes and stockings. Draco retreated from her sullen glare and hurried after Potter, who'd stepped out the back door. Draco noticed the footprints an instant after Potter sprinted away from the chalet, following the disturbed snow into the trees. Draco raced after him.
Harry did what he always did whenever he felt conflicted; he went to see Hermione. To his surprise, he exited the Floo to find her living room in chaos. All of the furniture had been stacked into a large pile in the centre of the room, and then apparently covered in books.
Harry broke the kiss by gripping both sides of Draco's head and pushing him away forcibly. His eyes were glazing over again and his lips were wet from Draco's saliva. Draco groaned and dragged him closer, pulling Harry hard against him. Harry avoided his lips—barely—so Draco attached his mouth to Harry's smooth neck, instead. He slid his tongue over Harry's jugular and sucked lightly.
He stepped out onto the pavement and part of him wished desperately that Potter would not show. His eyes scanned the Muggle-infested street hopefully, a hope that fluttered and died, because Potter was there. Draco stopped short, barely recognizing him.
"After your wicked treatment of me, Draco, lad, I've decided to make you my willing slave, after all. It will be nice to watch you crawl. You'll beg for every morsel of kindness from me and I plan to treat you like the lowest dog as you sicken and die of unrequited love for me, pleading for the kind words I'll never give you." Her green eyes were quite mad and Draco felt a distinct sense of horror at her words, especially when she held up a small vial with a bright pink potion inside. She shook it teasingly. "Yes, Draco, dear. A love potion. Fitting justice for a Malfoy. How many hearts have you destroyed, you handsome devil? It's time to return the favor."
"I should probably find out what that's all about. May I use your Floo?"
Harry reined in his annoyance and let the comment pass. He was secretly glad for the reprieve; he hadn't yet made up his mind about whether or not to turn Malfoy in for his inability to cast a Patronus, or at least have him removed from the case. They were fighting
Hermione's expression was priceless and Draco laughed again.
Draco relaxed again. "Oh good. I knew he would like his box once he got used to it. Silly bird."
"In the interest of time, we will go over only a few of those remaining." Malfoy flipped through the final two of Rhonestaad's photos and all of Harry's to stop on a shot belonging to Henrietta that was nearly all leaves--an extreme close-up. He pointed out the visual interest of the photo, which was quite good, as well as the primary flaw--a large grape marring one edge of the image--and then told them about cropping and how it could be best utilised to extract the excellent parts of a picture and leaving behind the rest. "Separating the chaff from the wheat, as it were."
"Couldn't we just have some more auspicious occasions?"
"That was ages ago and I know you didn't mean it." Seamus held the bottle up next to his face and crooned at it. "He didn't mean it, sweetie."
"Time to go," Draco said with a hint of amusement.
"Who knew that your hair could get even worse?"
"What are you doing?" Pansy hissed in his ear as Potter wrenched himself out of Draco's grasp with a glare.
They manhandled Potter ahead of them until a portion of Crabbe's group clustered together. Draco saw Quentin Quartermain climb to his feet near the entrance tunnel, holding one hand against his temple as he blinked at them.
"For your photography class. There is a room available above Charlemagne Shoes. There are loads of windows that let in natural light, plus some interesting old brickwork around the fireplace. Which is connected to the Floo Network, as a bonus. I checked."
"But—"
"How does that work?"
"Did anyone contact Malfoy's mother?" Vic asked.
"Care to trade wands?" Draco held up the wand he'd been clutching earlier. Harry hadn't got a good look at it during their shambling walk up the stairs. He smiled broadly, seeing it now.
"I'm getting McGonagall," Weasley muttered and bypassed Draco like a shot. Longbottom and the other two Gryffindor residents followed, leaving Potter to his fate. So much for Gryffindor courage. Idiots.
"We need to run.
Brad smirked at him. "Looks like you might not be going home alone tonight."
"You may pass."
Malfoy reached out and clamped his hand on Harry's bicep with a nod. "Take us there. I have a list of Johnston's friends. We can start with them."
“I once mentioned that you needed to be shackled to a bed, Potter.” Malfoy pointed his wand at the sofa, which elongated and changed until a large four-poster bed stood where it had been. Harry felt a jolt of something that was not quite terror, especially when Malfoy called, “
"How long do you think it would take Hermione to read them all?"
I caught up on reading case files this morning and had dinner with Ron and Hermione. At least she agrees with me about training wizards and witches at a younger age with some sort of primary school. Ron says it's up to the parents to give kids guidance, which set Hermione off until they were shouting at one another. Some things never change.
Draco grinned wickedly at the memory and his gaze warmed when he looked at Harry, who blushed as if on cue. Draco nearly laughed aloud. Hermione's sharp gaze passed from one of them to the other, but Draco doubted even she could put those limited clues together. He could see her filing it away for future reference before turning to Harry.
"Not yet. I'm starting to think we have irreconcilable differences. Especially in regards to my job."
Maeve moved closer until her lips were near Draco's ear. "You're a fine specimen of a man, Malfoy. Maybe I should place an Imperius Curse on you and turn you into my willing slave." Her hand trailed over Draco's chest and down his abdomen. "Or perhaps a love potion."
"Easily done. Is that all?"
"He sent me a
Harry's libido leaped at the words and the resulting images slammed into his brain. Holy fuck, the thought of Malfoy on his knees… Harry was rapidly losing control of the quickening length in his pants, which hardened further as Malfoy's hand glided closer to his crotch.
Draco lifted his hand absently and murmured the usual spell before he remembered himself. To his surprise, the salt floated into the air and zipped into Molly's hand. For a single, heart-stopping moment, he thought his magic had inexplicably returned.
Wednesday, 25.2.2004
"Hardly blackmail. I plan to teach you to cast a Patronus."
Harry backed away and then turned and exited the room at a quick walk. His heart pounded and he leaned against the bannister for a moment before heading down the stairs. What was it about Draco Malfoy? Harry had never been so attracted to Eddie. Not ever. Nor anyone else that he could remember.
"Fine." The final gate clanged shut and Malfoy spelled the leather hoods into a small trunk and then slammed the lid. "Did you learn anything worth reporting, or did you just come all the way out here to annoy me?"
"A little help would be nice!" Harry yelled.
, you mean," Draco retorted with a glare.
Harry shrugged, not willing to answer. Basically, it killed dementors and pretty much every other dark creature Draco used it on. They had argued about Draco's use of deadly force time and again, but the only resolution they had ever reached was name-calling. Harry would label Draco a bloodthirsty, soulless, insensitive, malicious tyrant, and Draco would retort that he was a candy-coated, idealistic, naive, asinine nancy-boy and that would be the end of the discussion.
"Happy Christmas, everyone. You all seem to be particularly pleased with yourselves this evening."
Malfoy made a humming sound of agreement and kissed him.
"Two."
"Then allow me to jar your memory.
had been invoked, Draco crawled out of bed and headed for the shower. Somewhere between the shampoo and his third conditioner, Draco decided Pansy was right. He would forget Potter and concentrate on Mark.
Harry took the photo listlessly, unwilling to let her know that he didn't plan to attend. He supposed he should at least talk to Draco and find out if he was going at all. Harry brightened. Maybe he could talk Draco into skipping the event and going somewhere else. Like the Prefect's Bathroom…
"Of course not. But I will need his help in setting up. You don't expect me to decorate forty-two chairs on my own, do you?"
Bloody hell, you're a sight! Hermione!" Granger threw herself at Harry and clung, nearly dislodging Draco, who held more tightly, refusing to be dislodged. He and Granger exchanged pointed stares.
"No. I have no way of knowing who to trust. Someone hired Crabbe and they might have half of St Mungo's on their payroll."
? The former Death Eater?" Harry was dubious. "I thought you captured him right after the war."
"Larch," he replied. "It was a bit tricky to use at first, but I think it likes me now."
"When you pretend that your blatantly illegal activities are inconsequential."
Potter decided to be honest. Draco didn't mention it, however, as Potter obediently took hold of the bars.
His own fingers and palms moved over Draco's skin, recalling the silken feel of it, remembering the sensitive places Draco loved so well. His fingertips teased the Sectumsempra scars, silently begging forgiveness for the hundredth time, and Draco's lips were on his again—sweet, so sweet.
Their footsteps rang on the pavement as they walked. Draco thought the sound was decisive, confident, and not at all hesitant or nervous. Of course, the echoing, not-quite-in-synch clomping could not really be assigned an emotion; it was simply a sound, after all, and yet it comforted him all the same, despite the fact that the echo was muted due to the pelting raindrops.
"I'm off to greet the guests, then." Malfoy waved at Ron and Hermione and traipsed out. The Auror at the front door let him out and Harry followed close behind. "Careful not to tramp on my shoes, Potter. They are difficult enough to walk in."
"That's amazing!" Tim cried. He reached out to touch Harry, who took wing with a piercing cry and went to land near Victoria.
Their second attempt at intimacy had resulted in Ginny laughing softly and cupping Harry’s traumatised face in her hands. “Harry, my darling,” she had said. “I’m afraid you are dreadfully gay.”
~~o~~
Her stare turned sceptical. "Current events."
"Are you?" Malfoy's tone of amused disbelief rankled.
.  His cock jutted forward, fully hard.  His arse felt like sticks of fire had been laid across it and he panted hard as he waited for the next blow.
. Potter's hips thrust forward again, earning a distinct whimper from Draco that nearly shocked him back into his right mind… until Potter kissed him.
Harry found himself shaking with rage and had to physically control himself from stalking into the room and… and what? Hexing them both? He took a deep breath to calm down.
Draco suppressed a smile and six sorts of sardonic comments, because he felt rather touched to be trusted with such a sacred item. It was a massive statement, to Draco's thinking, and felt something like a thank you for potentially saving Granger's life.
The man chuckled. "I think you lie. Enjoy your last few minutes, Malfoy, although I suppose that isn't really an option. If Crabbe should allow you to live, however, and you continue on your current path, I will hunt down and destroy everyone you ever cared about. And that is a promise." With that, he turned and departed. Draco spent the next few minutes alone, reflecting on the strange conversation and wondering how the hell he would get out of this mess alive.
Draco's hand dropped to Harry's wrist. Harry glanced at him in surprise. "Don't," Draco said in a low tone. "It isn't necessary." Strangely, the warm touch had the opposite effect. Rather than calming Harry, he was suddenly annoyed at the whole situation. He wanted Draco, who was determined to marry Astoria Greengrass and have little Malfoy heirs and make his dead father proud. It was foolish to act like he had anything to lose.
Harry frowned. "A wicked
Quartermain blanched. "They should never have let you out."
"You're-- You're gay?"
"Terribly sorry. I'm a bit of a butterfingers." He shifted from foot to foot, and something about him reminded him of Neville. Hogwarts Neville, not current competent Herbologist Neville. "I'm also pants at Repairing Spells."
Draco shrugged. "As you wish."
Instead of making another trip to the door, Harry cast a Patronus and sent his stag galloping through the wall and off to Kingsley. When the afterimage had faded, he sat in growing silence until he thought anything might be better than staring at the table in order to keep from studying Malfoy. He attempted conversation. "So, what have you been up to since Hogwarts?"
"You did?" Harry and Zabini spoke as one. "When?" Harry added, wondering why Draco hadn't mentioned it mere minutes earlier.
"So sure," he growled and then dove back in, tasting Draco more firmly and exploring his mouth until they were both gasping. They kissed for so long that Harry's jaw began to ache and his mouth felt raw and bruised. Even then he didn't want to stop. Draco was an amazing kisser. Harry's glasses had fogged up, skewed sideways, until finally he had yanked them off to toss them somewhere on the end of the couch.
His stomach growled, reminding him that Potter had worked through lunch, sending Bertram to fetch them substandard sandwiches and weak tea from the Ministry canteen. Draco was famished. Likely Potter was, as well, but he wasn't Draco's problem. Draco opened the pantry door and mentally sorted through his cookery books. He was too exhausted from his earlier physical endeavours to bother with anything labour-intensive. A simple vegetable frittata should fill his needs.
"Fine," Malfoy snapped. "But if she hexes me, it's on your head." He reached out and took Harry's hand. Harry clasped it for only a moment before using it to haul Malfoy out of the chair. He used a bit more force than necessary and Malfoy ended up nearly plastered against him. They stared at each other from a too-close distance for several heartbeats and then Malfoy dropped Harry's hand and gave him a push. "Shove off, Potter," he said, but both the push and the words were playful.
"I thought about you every day," Harry admitted. "Every single day."
Harry spent possibly too long wondering who the hell he knew named "Chang" because Draco pinched him again.
"Well wishes?" Harry asked and jerked his chin towards them.
Harry smiled. "Yeah." Harry had lost the waifish thinness he'd acquired since the war, but if he kept eating Draco's cooking, he'd start to look like Dudley. "Where do you suppose everyone went?"
Harry resisted the urge to cup his testicles in horror, barely. "That spell should be on the list of Unforgiveables, honestly."
tea, but I like it. And I'm still learning what I like and what I don't. This one I like." Harry took another drink and felt the warm liquid soothe its way into his system.
They appeared before the front steps of Malfoy Manor.
"These things," Draco growled and crawled between Harry's legs. He lifted the waistband of Harry's pants and pulled until Harry's thick, rigid cock sprang free. "Fuck," Draco said on a breath, and Harry hoped to hell that meant he liked it, which seemed to be the case as Draco's head descended and then his lips wrapped around it.
"Can we go for a walk, Uncle Harry? Cousin Draco says it will be fun."
Draco shook his head. "Never mind Roderick. He is my problem. What do you want to know about Mark Birmingham?"
"After you fell asleep, of course. Your snoring kept me awake."
I'm so bloody tied up in knots I can't even think straight. (Oh wait, I'm not straight. Har de har har.)
He continued through the meadow and walked through the wooden gate that bisected the low stone wall. The place looked quaint and well-tended with a shorn lawn, bright flowers, and ornamental plants. A wisp of smoke curled from the chimney; someone was definitely home.
Unwilling to think on it anymore, Harry decided he'd better get back and start planning his weekend with Eddie. Perhaps he could come up with a way to broach the subject of the photos. Maybe Eddie would have a perfectly rational explanation.
Draco's bare back was smooth and unmarked, curving down to the amazing perfection of his buttocks that Harry had admired on more than a few recent occasions. Draco's legs were still encased in the trousers he had worn beneath his dress robes and his feet... were clad in shoes.
Malfoy swallowed all of it, sucking and lapping at Harry until every last drop had been consumed and Harry’s tingling shudders lessened. He fought to stay on his feet. His legs were shaking. Malfoy’s hands gripped his hips, ostensibly to keep Harry in place. He belatedly noticed that his hands were tangled in Malfoy’s blond hair.
"You are so efficient. An absolute peach. Don't you just adore her?" Malfoy beamed at her and she blushed and waved her hands at him.
Parkinson finally appeared, looking surprisingly practical in sturdy-looking robes and low-heeled boots. The black embroidery on the midnight blue robes gave evidence of the quality and cost, but at least she wasn't dressed like a flash shop clerk.
Ron's expression was stricken as Harry backed away. Ron held out a placating hand and his voice was pleading. "Oh God, Harry, I'm so sorry—I didn't think— I was just so angry…"
A few deep, steadying breaths helped him move the idea from the realm of impossible to that of vaguely plausible. He glanced at the frittata, which had cooked to perfection in the still-hot pan. Draco slid it onto a plate and carried it to the dining table. His thoughts were awhirl.
"That's very generous of you," Harry's lips twitched into an amused grin.
Draco began to feel like he was being herded. The rustling had grown louder and came from both left and right. He considered turning around and going back the way he came, intentionally provoking a confrontation, but the knowledge of his current weakened state made him pause. Truthfully, he felt much stronger than when he had first been deposited in this place. He still wasn't fully recovered and probably wouldn't be without a decent meal and a good night's sleep, but at least he no longer staggered, nor needed to rest every twelve minutes.
Malfoy sighed and stopped nibbling on Harry’s neck. He tried not to feel disappointment.
"No! I heard something in the kitchen so I went to check it out, and then I came straight up the stairs—they must have exited through one of the other rooms!" Cho disappeared and Harry gave Greta a weak smile and squeezed her hand before leaping up and tearing after Cho, who slammed open the door nearest them and ran to the open window on the other side of the room.
"What are you doing?"
"That is not helping," he muttered. "Not helping at all."
"We'll start with the safe houses nearest to London and range out from there." Harry suspected they would recognise the location when they found it by the strength of the wards. It would be obvious the moment they tried to get inside.
The walls of the room were deep violet, but the pale wood, cream carpet, and multi-coloured upholstery and pillows kept the room from looking gloomy. In fact, it felt homey, lived-in and comfortable.
"Do you have any idea who it is?"
The lift opened onto a far different décor than the one they'd left. Opulent carpets covered the floor of an octagonal room. Several archways led outwards, probably turning into a warren of mazelike passages. Shacklebolt led Draco through a left-hand archway. The walkway was lit with wall sconces and covered in tapestries, but the air was cold. They passed several doors and then descended a curving staircase to halt before an iron-barred gate. It opened with a spell and Draco tried not to feel anxious as it ground closed behind them. The place was beginning to feel less like an oasis of protection and more like a prison with every step.
The shadows were lengthening and the thickening clouds threatened rain when Malfoy finally locked away Gavin and cocked a pale brow at Harry. "Are you staying for dinner, then?"
Draco nearly shivered when he thought of the potential there. Potter was… well, he was damnably attractive, and powerful, and rich, and socially perfect, but then there was Mark, who was also damnably attractive, possibly powerful, and rich, and socially acceptable, and… well, Draco was relaxed and comfortable with him and he simply
"Where is Ron?"
Harry nodded and refrained from mentioning that Draco had been an obnoxious, spoiled brat as a child.
"I wouldn't dream of defiling such a sacred object. Why are you cooking?"
"I love it when you look at me like that," Draco said huskily and his lips parted to show brilliant white teeth.
"What?"
~~~~*~~~~
Harry's lips were still perfect, though, where they touched the rim of the cup—pink and kissable…
Potter drove his hips forward and Draco cried out again as Potter was completely, deeply buried. "Oh shit, did I hurt you?"
. Why, indeed? He couldn't admit that Malfoy was helping them to catch evildoers. Hell, it sounded ludicrous in his own mind. "He was trying to get some information about a friend of his. A friend in Azkaban."
"No happy childhood memories, then?" Harry asked gently. "What about holidays, or your birthday?"
"I thought he was planning to come as the Ghost of Christmas Past. From that Muggle book," Harry said.
Ron had left his brothers' shop after breakfast and flown back to the encampment, hoping the others had not left. He was relieved to find the tent still standing and dropped his broom next to the other two before ducking inside. He'd expected to find someone in the living room, but it was empty. Ron heard a sound from the kitchen and discovered Harry tapping his wand against a teapot with one hand and yanking at his hair with the other. Harry seemed to be muttering and preoccupied. He did not notice Ron, who ducked out quickly and wondered where the hell Hermione had gone to. And
"I can only say I'm sorry so many times." Draco's voice was quiet.
The word stung. Draco hated to be called manipulative. Even when it was true. "I am not manipulating anyone, Potter."
"Because I want you. I want to see you naked, and I want to touch you. I want to taste your skin. I want your cock in my mouth." As Draco spoke he worked the rest of the leather through the metal buckle. When the belt hung free at last, Draco's fingers moved to the button of Harry's trousers.
"Absolutely positive." Draco barely moved his lips. Louder, he said, "Oh my, I need to tinky! Hand these out for me, won't you, darling? I'll be right back. Nature calls!"
, not you."
"Yes, Potter. A book. Have you ever read one?"
"For Merlin's sake, Granger, snap out of it!" Despite his words, Harry noticed that he looked a bit flustered by Hermione's words.
—and at least if he went to the Ministry he had a chance of seeing the git in order to convince himself his musings were utter madness. And also to persuade himself that seeing Draco Malfoy in leather trousers would not be erotic in the slightest, despite the fact that it had seemed ridiculously so in his last dream.
"Draco Malfoy?" Repeating the name for the third time hadn't given Harry any clearer understanding of what Malfoy wanted.
, Consuelo. How is that document coming along?"
"Yeah." Harry smiled back. "Hey, I have an idea. Do you want to come with me?"
"Nicely played," Draco said next to Harry, who glanced over at him. The grey sunglass lenses had gone dark in the sunlight and Draco's eyes were invisible.
in a repeating litany. Without thinking, Harry lifted his wand and cast a Locking Charm on the door.
Harry bowed politely and bypassed her, heading for the edge of the garden.
He felt Draco remove his glasses as he settled back into the cushions. Draco's hand squeezed his reassuringly. A spot of cold touched his temple—Draco's wand. Draco's voice began to chant softly, lulling him into a blissful state of calm. Harry listened to the voice when it started to guide him back to a specific memory.
In the end, Draco could not think of a graceful way to extract himself from Maeve's enforced kindness and he unwillingly handed her his clothing through a crack in the door before sinking into a steaming hot bath. He was far too uncomfortable to spend his usual "ludicrous" amount of time in the tub (as Harry would put it) so he merely scrubbed until his skin gleamed, washed his hair (even though it wasn't necessary) and climbed out.
"He died in the war. We had quite a nasty one over there, you know."
Last night was a huge mistake. I can't believe I actually invited Malfoy over for a late dinner. I can't believe he accepted. I can't believe he wasn't with Jacob and I really can't believe he didn't see the fucking doe-eyes I was making at him all night because a relaxed, friendly, and casual Malfoy is even sexier than an uptight, suspicious, workmate Malfoy. I managed to cook pasta and veg without burning the house down, and strictly kept away from alcohol by watering my drinks down to the nearly unbearable level. He finally asked what I suspected he wanted to ask earlier - why had I so urgently sought out Jacob on my return from Dubai? "Merlin, Malfoy, I wanted some Dreamless Sleep and couldn't reach my regular healer, what is the bloody problem?" I even Summoned the vials--feeling a twinge at the small quantity remaining--and he seemed satisfied. I told him I was not interested in Jacob and he quirked a brow at me and asked "What if Jacob is interested in you? After all, you are the Chosen One." I chucked a piece of bread at him and told him he was being stupid, because who would want me when he could have him? He preened at that and replied that I was quite right. I still can't quite believe I admitted it. Hopefully he thought I was joking.
It was a relief. He had half-expected Draco to disappear from his life, never to be seen again. "I need to get back. I have another few minutes. Scheduled."
His breath fogged the air between them, and felt extra-warm against Draco's cold face. For a moment, Draco wondered why Potter wasn't fighting to free himself. It almost seemed that the surrounding snow had frozen them in a moment of surreal timelessness.
"Damned buttons," Draco said and trailed his lips and tongue over Harry's collarbone while his fingers caressed Harry's ribs. Harry made a breathy sound that made Draco pull him in until their bare torsos touched. Harry's flesh was warm against Draco's chilled skin.
Harry conceded the point… nearly. "
"Merlin, tell me we did not do what we did last night."
"Like the Ministry?" Ron offered.
Forty minutes later, Harry was back at home, grumbling and packing an overnight case full of t-shirts, socks, and spare underwear. "Denmark. Bloody hell, nothing ever happens in Denmark." Once packed, he triggered the Portkey and was whisked away.
Draco had received an owl from Pansy in early November requesting an escort home. Draco had nearly turned it down, knowing how Harry would react to the news, but she had also mentioned something vital that she needed to tell him. Draco knew Pansy well enough to know she did not use such terminology lightly.
"You were getting on well enough in London! What happened?" Not that he really wanted a repeat of that sort of "getting along."
Harry lifted his hand in an awkward half-wave. "Hi."
Harry blinked for a moment and then scrambled away from the bed. "Goodnight, Draco," he said softly. He strode to the door and paused only once to look back. Draco hadn't moved. Harry opened the door and fled.
"Don't worry your pretty, pretty head about it, dearie."
Harry shook out the card and then turned it over in his hand. "What does who want? This is blank. Was there another message?"
Greyback snorted and threw another branch on the fire. Clouds had begun to roll in whilst Harry had called the others and a gust of wind swept through the cave, sending a shower of sparks up towards the ceiling. Harry used the distraction as cover to move quicker, sidling around the two newcomers to get close to the boy.
Teddy leaped to his feet and danced up and down. His hair changed colour every time his feet hit the floor. "Oh yes! Can I? Can I? Can I?"
"Is anything wrong?" Potter asked, levering himself up onto his elbows.
Draco finished tying and got to his feet. His legs were ridiculously long, Harry noted, and fit. One "fashionable" slit in the fabric showed a glimpse of hipbone. "Yes, the same ones we saw in the shop. I must admit, they fit rather comfortably. And they make my arse look amazing, don't you think?" Draco pivoted and turned and cocked his head over a shoulder as if to catch a glimpse of his own arse and Harry could only stare and nod. The rear view was even more astounding--the denim hugged Malfoy's arse like a second skin and they were almost too short. Harry thought Blaise might have picked up the feminine version by mistake. "They are somewhat tight in the front, however," Draco continued. He started to turn and Harry fled to the kitchen, knowing he would never be able to witness that sight without betraying himself. His face and neck burned with heat and he thought about dunking his head under the sink faucet to cool off. Instead, he picked up a kitchen towel and fanned himself wildly.
Draco nearly forgot to breathe and his fists clenched, but he allowed Potter to slide the black t-shirt up and over his head. Potter stepped back and Draco felt his cheeks flame as Potter's gaze slid over his bare torso. After a moment, Potter walked around him in a slow circle, as though evaluating a prized animal. Draco's neck flamed, hot and prickly with shame, but he dared not speak.
"You never know. Besides, I'm sure you'll have just as much fun teaching some stuffy matron about lighting and perspective, all whilst imagining a luscious cock spread out waiting to be photographed."
Crabbe marched over and snatched up Pansy. Draco knew without looking. Pansy was vocal when she was upset, and the current high-pitched tumble of invectives, slurs, and vengeful promises would have made Salazar Slytherin proud.
Harry's voice was a barely audible whisper. "Then it's a good thing I'm nearly dead."
"I promised I wouldn't." Harry suddenly felt like they were back in school and he had forgotten to take notes in Transfiguration.
"What's for breakfast?" he asked.
A soft-looking blanket was folded atop the wooden chest at the foot of the bed, so Harry snatched it up and shook it out. He draped it carefully over Draco, who made a muted sound of approval. Harry was about to escape again when he saw that Draco's eyes were open and watching him. To Harry's amazement, Draco's lips curved in a smile.
Harry spent a few minutes stomping around the gazebo and throwing random, ineffectual hexes, and then he went to find Hermione. Eventually, Ron would make it home, and then he would have answers.
Narcissa laughed, an odd sound in the quiet room. It echoed slightly and she replaced the glass on the table before seating herself once more. "Not literally, of course. I only meant that Draco strongly feels the need to live up to his father's standards, more so now than he had while Lucius lived. It is a pity, at times. I think it keeps him from being truly happy."
Wednesday, 24.11.2004
Draco carefully caressed his way down each of Harry's legs, pausing only to lap at the tender flesh at the backs of Harry's knees, nearly sending him into spasms and causing Draco to chuckle maliciously. He already knew every reactive spot on Harry's body.
Harry and Hermione went over several books and began grouping them by order of usefulness. Ron helped for a while and then gave up and went to play a solitary game of wizard's chess at a corner table.
Truth be told, Draco had been rock-hard by the time he had finished reddening Potter’s arse.  The mortified hero had nearly escaped before Draco had recovered enough aplomb to stop him.  On a whim, he had suggested a rematch with higher stakes.
"Excellent. Now, let's see that Patronus."
that by the time he'd recovered his ability to think straight, Malfoy had been down the stairs and gone. Harry had tried reaching him by Floo and owl for nearly an hour before giving up.
"Yes, and I came to rescue you. I'll take you to see your father now. All the bad men have been taken care of."
"Works better as a body cream, actually."
Draco's hands were already busy removing the rest of Harry's clothing. "Yes. I've spent the past few days thinking of all the things I would do to you when you got here."
A smile threatened to split Harry's face in half. He thought it might become his new default expression.
Malfoy was still there, of course, glaring and smirking, and lurking in the halls like a thin spectre of his old self, shadowed on two sides once more, although Crabbe and Goyle had been replaced by a hulking fifth year student named Smead and a thin but evil-looking sixth year they called Bark. Smead seemed to enjoy the sound of his own voice and chattered incessantly, earning an irritated stare from Malfoy at least six times an hour. Bark said nothing, only nodded obediently at every word Smead or Malfoy uttered while slurping on a seemingly endless supply of licorice whips, which left his lips, tongue, and sometimes teeth an unpleasant shade of purple-black.
"Oh, but you did! Now I can purchase all the fancy teas I like, and mix my own concoctions, and never have to worry about straining the leaves through my teeth. In fact, you have quite the selection here." Harry bent down to peer at a row of glass jars that lined Malfoy's countertop. The labels had exotic-sounding names like ASSAM and OOLONG and LAPSANG SOUCHONG. "What do you recommend?"
After a minute or two of hissing her name, Hermione’s face appeared in the fire.
"I can't. I rather like her now," Draco admitted and managed not to smirk at the way Harry's jaw tightened. "She's been bloody useful with this little project of yours. We nearly have a workable solution."
She rolled her eyes and dropped the empty carton onto the table before picking up another—this one Draco's nearly finished noodles—and sprawled into a nearby chair. Instead of explaining, she made an impatient hand wave reminiscent of casting a spell and gestured at the card.
He set the tray aside and sipped at his glass as Maeve did the same.
"I see your fan club is still intact," Malfoy said.
She backed away quickly, trying to be silent; on the verge of panic. It all made sense—the searching looks, the quickly silenced words, the shared glances of amusement, the…
things just to get to know you and you turned out to be even more amazing than I'd thought with your bloody tea and your laugh and your chess-playing and historical book collection and crystal vases and brilliant, gorgeous
"Yeah, okay. Just be careful."
Draco could not speak through the rush of emotion. He gave Harry the gentlest kiss imaginable. It was possible, just possible, that he loved the damned Gryffindor, too. Of course, Harry would have to work to pry that information out of Draco. He wasn't about to offer it up like some Hufflepuff.
Draco ignored him. He tried to ignore the music, but the soft tones had a catchy beat and a sensual undertone that Draco liked more than he would have expected. The last dim vestiges of sunlight faded from the sky and gravel crunched beneath Potter's feet as he returned to stand next to Draco.
Draco shook his head. "All of your friends are here. You're not alone now. All of these people—they are making me a bit claustrophobic."
. Draco only had a moment to give thanks that Harry wasn't with them, and then Crabbe was marching towards them with a determined stride.
Harry shook his head and chuckled. Vic laughed, Rocco rolled his eyes, and Draco and Brady each cast one more practice spell before declaring they were both ready.
He was still in shock that Malfoy had kissed him at all. The first time had apparently been part of a joke, but the second? With no witnesses? Still, it could be a Slytherin trick and Harry tried not to be too hopeful. The kissing, though, had been amazing.
His attention sharply left Malfoy the moment he spied the dark stain splashed all over the carpet beneath the chair. A small pool of coagulated blood lay on the wood at the edge of the carpet. It was a grim reminder and Harry forced down a bout of queasiness tainted with guilt. He took a shaking breath and went into the kitchen to prepare a cup of tea. He knew he was going to need it.
SHIT. Christmas is in FIVE DAYS and I still don't know what to get for Malfoy. He already has everything! I barely know what to get Ron! Shit shit shit I am fucked if I don't get him the perfect thing. Except not literally, because while he's perfectly willing to give me oral sex at the drop of a hat, even in Flourish and Blott's (bloody hell, I couldn't document that here because we were nearly caught and I almost had a fucking heart attack) he still won't have full-on sex with me, which is fine, it's great. I wish I'd never made that comment about Jacob, because I fear Malfoy is never going to get past it. He's made a few snide remarks about fucking people only when he has
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but when the time came he ordered a scoop of chocolate and one of cheesecake, so Harry went traditional with vanilla bean and a second scoop of the mascarpone and fig. It was tasty, but unusual, and he preferred the familiarity of the vanilla.
"I know."
and all that." Harry reached up and curved his hand around the back of Draco's neck and pulled him into a kiss. It was soft and gentle and barely a press of lips to lips, but when Harry leaned away and took up the Floo powder, Draco's eyes were huge and enigmatic. "Hex me later?" He tossed the powder, yelled, "Hogwarts!" and stepped into the flames.
"How is the Weasel?"
It was nearly closing time when Draco Malfoy crashed back into Harry's life. It had been a quiet night up until that point. Harry had gone to an out-of-the-way pub with Neville to catch up on news of Hogwarts. Both of them had been incognito, with Neville nipping from a bottle of Polyjuice Potion throughout the night. He was nearly as recognised as Harry, much to Harry's amusement, and when they were together they were often hounded for photos or autographs.
"What are you talking about?"
Malfoy's half smile disappeared. "You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Not yet. And some things you need to learn for yourself. One day you will trust me, and then you will believe me when I tell you things that you don't want to hear. Either that, or Eddie will slip up and you'll figure him out on your own. If he survives the night, that is. I'll be in touch, Harry."
Harry turned away, confused and mortified. That year had been awful for both of them, he had to admit. Not exactly happy-memory-inducing. Getting desperate, he asked, "Your first kiss?"
A pounding on Draco's front door announced the arrival of Mark.
Harry was. Frankly, he was terrified. This entire thing was madness. What the hell was he doing, letting Draco Malfoy do… whatever he wanted? He had to be crazy. Malfoy’s father worked for Voldemort, the mad wizard determined to kill Harry at all costs. Putting himself so completely into Draco’s hands was beyond stupidity.
"Here?" Draco glanced around.
"Um… what is the next thing we need to search for?" Harry asked. He searched for the correct keys on the keyboard and wished he'd listened more closely to Hermione.
Parkinson sank into a soft-looking chair and nodded. "Greg did a lot of soul-searching after the war. She seems much happier now."
Malfoy's grey eyes softened into genuine amusement and Harry's heart gave a curious beat-skip.
“Nice legs, Zabini!” Ron yelled clutching Harry’s arm as they raced around the corner. Zabini really did have nice legs, Harry admitted to himself. But he wished he could have seen Malfoy’s. For the amusement value only, of course.
Or he could just take down one last mark and
"That's not important, is it?" Harry winked and took a drink of his Firewhiskey. He wasn't drunk, having spent most of the evening nursing two bottles of ale.
Harry and Hermione both stared at him.
"Any number of reasons. Fenrir is a fairly loyal employee when given the right motivation, as evidenced by that whole Dark Lord business; he's fairly talented with a wand; and he's utterly unscrupulous. Also, he has a thing for children."
"Why didn't you just tell Kingsley? Why drag me into this?"
"Point taken, Harry. No more Granger-baiting. Just for you."
“Oh, Merlin, whenever you say, whatever you want,” Harry cried, thrusting his hips back desperately and nearly screaming when something inside sent a spike of pleasure shivering through him.  It was nearly too much.
"Harry? It's his day off. You need something?"
"I'm fine," Draco said, even though the burn was now like a searing blade across his skin, reaching out miniature fingers of heat to claw and scrape at the surrounding areas.
They fell into a rhythm and Harry found the manual labour to be actually cathartic. She had been right about the spell; it took a particular flourish to get it just right. A foot-wide section tore off in a long strip and Harry felt like crowing with satisfaction. He glanced at Hermione, who had started on the wall opposite his. He knew it was stupid to be so competitive, but he was determined to finish his side before she finished hers.
"Come in, Annabelle," Malfoy called, still watching Harry.
Harry shut his eyes and swallowed. He took a deep breath and lifted his hand to push against the gate, half expecting it to contort into a caricature and speak, but it opened before he could touch the metal. He frowned, but walked inside. His feet crunched on the gravel path. Every step seemed to conjure another memory, but the one he kept returning to was the one where Draco Malfoy had looked at Harry's face, with his father's desperate demands ringing through the room.
"Sleeping on the sofa now? Really?" Eddie cracked three eggs with a spell and they dropped into the sizzling skillet.
"Potter's earned his glory, which is more than I can say for you. Shacklebolt trusts him implicitly, and yet it seems the
Harry grabbed Malfoy's elbow roughly. "Come along, Persephone. We need to go and speak with Hermione now."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ o ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco went back to Harry, who leaned his way. "I've never seen you chummy with Seamus before. What's up?"
Harry frowned at the picture. Surely it wasn't that terrible? He wondered what Seamus and Dean's had got, but wasn't curious enough to ask them. Instead, he dug through his house until he located an old camera, went to the bedroom and wanked for a bit, and then took another picture.
"I'm sorry," he said sincerely. Malfoy's shoulder moved against his as he shrugged and Harry wondered what Malfoy would have been doing if he hadn't been ordered to sit here in the rain. Probably drinking champagne, eating rich food, opening gifts, and dancing merrily at Malfoy Manor.
the Ministry."
"It's not like that! She doesn't care about none of that. She wants to run away. Elope. But I know her father will hate us, will hate
~FIN~
Rosier edged into the light, hanging back so that Draco could just make out the dark point of his wand, held in his right hand. "Don't try anything stupid."
"If this is your way to avoid cleaning up, Ronald--"
"Research isn't always difficult."
"Draco, just tell me."
Harry thought about it and tried to remember how it had looked pressed against Eddie's throat. "I'm… I'm not sure. It was dark wood, a bit gnarled, I think."
Potter grinned. "Yeah, okay, you got me there. But when do you think he'll strike?"
"I… need your help," he said lamely, forcibly suppressing the urge to plead. He couldn't blame Harry for hating him. If the positions were reversed, Draco would feel the same. Hell, he would probably have thrown Potter into the street without giving him the chance to open his mouth.
Though he felt the knife in his heart twist with every rise and fall of Draco's chest, Harry sat and watched him sleep until the shadows in the room lengthened and the fire burned itself out.
Harry blinked at him. "Now? But it's early."
"It's only natural that they want your expertise," Eddie had said. "No doubt they'll continue to ask for your services for years to come. It will be your choice whether to wean them off slowly or make a clean break."
It was cosy and well-kept. Even though it grated on Draco's nerves to admit it, he could not really find fault with anything. The furnishings were traditional and much to Draco's taste—mostly pale oak upholstered with muted fabrics in earth tones.
Draco stumbled on a clump of grass and slammed into one of Crabbe's people, a solidly-built woman who reminded him of Millicent Bullstrode. She shoved—even more Millicent-like—and Draco staggered against Harry, trying to catch his balance. Harry caught him and they were locked in a frozen embrace.
"What are you talking about?"
"So he looks good on paper—"
"Honestly, Harry, do you think I'd be bloody foolish enough to wait? Anyone could have intercepted that message and lain in wait for us. Or it could have been a trap. Naturally, I went to confront him immediately."
"Yeah," Ron added, "last I heard, Magical Games and Sports was on Level Seven. Not much call for Unspeakables from people who sell
"Yeah, Harry, all work and no play, you know!"
"Fucking with his body?" Draco asked bluntly and let his eyes slide over Potter's tense form. His legs were long and lean beneath what had to be a perfect ass, although Draco could not tell because of the dark cloak. Draco smiled and imagined peeling those clothes away from that delectable body. "He is terribly hot, isn't he?"
"I'm so sorry, Harry," Draco began, but he spoke over Draco, likely not hearing him at all.
"and shoved the tip in the direction of Crabbe's astonished stare. "You have to mean it," his Aunt Bellatrix had once told him, and by the fucking Founders of Hogwarts and every damned wizard ever born, Draco meant every bloody syllable at that moment, uttered through blood and pain.
Green eyes flashed up to lock with his every so often as Potter moved up and down. His hand moved from Draco's cock to his testicles and back to his cock, while the other stroked Draco's hip, thigh, and ribs in continuous movement, as if he were trying to touch everything at once. Draco pushed a hand into Potter's hair but was careful not to force any motion; Potter was doing just fine on his own. He seemed to have no gag reflex, taking it deep enough that his nose brushed Draco's abdomen with each downstroke.
Draco never discovered what his alert state would save Crabbe from, because he snapped his head forwards and snatched Crabbe's wand with his teeth, holding tightly enough that he feared his molars would crack.
Draco cast a nearly soundless Cleaning Charm and smirked at the hard length nestled against his arse cheeks. "Forget it, Blaise. I already told you you'll never fuck me. Feel free to go take care of yourself elsewhere."
Draco's eyes were wide and shocked. "Potter. You—
She frowned, but settled back into the chair and closed her eyes. She was pale and blond and seemed incredibly frail. Harry glanced at Curtis, who jerked his head to indicate a short hallway. "We can talk in the baby's room, if you don't mind."
Harry laughed aloud at Malfoy's petulant tone. "I'll make it worth your while."
Malfoy smiled at that, faintly, but it was there. "As you wish." Before Harry was ready, Malfoy spun, crouched, and cried, "
"You want me to cast a Patronus based on my happy feelings for gingerbread?"
"Greg is in Pembrokeshire. Come, Pans."
Harry wrinkled his nose. Home renovation was not his favourite thing. Other than installing heavier curtains to cover Mrs Black's painting more permanently, he had not done much to Grimmauld Place. Of course, he was rarely there, thanks to his job.
I nearly ran into Malfoy and Jacob snogging in the break room at St Mungo's. I ducked out before they saw me, and then had to count backwards from 100 to keep from hexing something. The glass in one of the pictures on the wall broke - note to self: I'll need to replace that. I have to get over this raging jealousy if I'm going to be friends with Malfoy again. Still, it was the first time I'd seen them together and it feels like a white-hot trident in the stomach. Why did I have to fall for the git?
Harry's arms wrapped around him tightly and his breath panted into Draco's ear. Draco's hands dragged over Harry's sweat-slicked form.
A long, lovely line of torso was mostly in shadow, but lit along one gorgeous, off-centre line that highlighted every curve of muscle along its route from one dark nipple to the delicate curve of bright red cloth. From the edge of cloth, the eye was naturally drawn to the swell that rose up until it burst free only to be covered modestly by a sweep of hand. Draco wanted to knock the hand away, to feast upon the luscious cock only barely exposed. He wanted to taste it, and to link his fingers with those shown, and draw them away more gently.
For once, Malfoy seemed to have nothing to say. His grey eyes were wide and unblinking and Harry felt a surge of satisfaction that he'd at least got even for the mind-numbing shock Malfoy had induced in him the night before. He'd been so astonished at Malfoy
the Ministry?"
~~o~~
"Hmmm?" Harry asked in bemusement. Broom and owl cage were on the ground, forgotten, and Harry's hands were tangled in Draco's hair.
"What would that be, exactly?"
Hermione set the papers on a nearby table. "I'll read these a bit later. It's time to eat."
And then Harry was there, standing before the well and watching Draco drop down into the darkness. He felt a momentary lurch of unreality when the memory of his annoyance was overlapped by a sudden rush of pride followed by fear—his current feelings were clouding his memories.
"You might actually die, or feel like you were dying."
Draco sat back in his chair and licked his lips, imagining he could still taste Potter there. He felt like laughing at himself, because irony was a strong presence in his life. Draco had lusted himself into having a crush on the man beneath the red silk, and foolishly allowed himself to have a similar crush on Potter. Obviously his emotions were getting out of control, possibly due to an extreme lack of sex.
"I should—" Potter finally managed, but Draco hushed him.
"Smite Conference?" Tim asked.
With the judicious use of Stingers and Patronus Charms, they managed to drive the creatures a fair distance from the Muggle parade. Harry gnashed his teeth with frustration. The whole plan had hinged on the effectiveness of the Unspeakables' spell. They were hopeless to do anything now other than drive them away. He scanned the area, looking for the two Unspeakables, but they were nowhere to be found; probably already heading back to the Ministry to report.
As Ron clapped him on the shoulder and uttered his thanks, Harry looked over the fence into the dark night. One way or another, it was time to talk to Montoya.
"Fine. I will." With that, Harry spun and marched through the living room. He walked quickly, half-fearing that Eddie would run after him and stop him with pleading and kisses. It had happened before, but this time he didn't want it. He snatched up his wand and clothing, grabbed a handful of Floo powder, and yelled the phrase that would take him to Grimmauld Place. Once there, he set the wards to keep out everyone, dropped his clothing onto the floor of the hallway, and made his way to the kitchen. He needed a bracing cup of tea, perhaps laced with brandy.
"Look, I know you have little reason to trust me beyond everything that I've done for you and the fact that I'm inherently trustworthy, but everything is going to plan. Rosier is completely relaxed and self-satisfied—honestly, he makes a better Wells-Barton than Wells-Barton. Did you notice?"
Malfoy had returned to Rosier's side and as Harry watched he jabbed an elbow into Parkinson's side. There followed a quiet argument that Rosier seemed to find amusing, until Parkinson gave Malfoy a venomous glare and stalked away. Malfoy leaned close to Mrs Wells-Barton and spoke. Both women laughed and Rosier's speculative gaze travelled over Malfoy, who had turned away from him.
Harry's jaw tightened. Ever since the library incident, his interactions with Malfoy had been stilted. Between them, they had a decent-sized list of upcoming events to stake out; Harry had added them to the map at the Ministry and solicited ideas from the team as to the best way to keep an eye on all of them. They planned to lurk at most of the events, but a few happened on the same day, which necessitated splitting up the group.
