Potter blinked down at him, all long lashes trembling with curiosity and green, green, green as the fields in May, and Draco nearly lost himself in the sea of jade bordered by inky spikes, delicate as his own downy feathers. Those eyes—that face—that odd little half-grin-not-scowl he affected!
Elder Futhark Runes
“Spare me, luv,” Pansy said, huddling closer to Theo. “Darling, would mind putting out my eyes temporarily? And perhaps casting a decent warming charm on my feet?”
“Tell you what, I’ll pass it over to you after supper, Potter. In the Library, at eight sharp. Meet me there.”
She stared at him. Cross-eyed. Sideways and squint-eyed.
It may've been that.
In any event, Draco wasn't afforded the luxury of a spare moment to make any sort of move to call for aid, not even from an old friend. His foals were wildly recalcitrant, the Bees were irate and misbehaving and half of his precious films of the pretty nebulae had been ruined in a silly mishap and had to be reshot and recast, causing several more nights of mostly lost sleep.
Oh, bloody hell. Oh, for Merlin's sake. His bloody nose was now adding insult to injury—conjuring up the intoxicating smell of Malfoy, right out here by the breezy Lake side, where Harry had been positive he'd be fairly safe.
"How—long?" Malfoy was insistent; he couldn't possibly go any deeper into Harry, but he did, impossibly. "How fucking long, Harry? Tell me!"
Thankfully it seemed to be working again, the knob. At least partly.
"Pardon?" Draco's eyes widened. "Have
Speaking of, damn Lucius to Hades for placing his own son and heir in this cruelly uncomfortable position! And damn that scurrilous git Potter, as well, for rendering Lucius's heir helpless, supplicant before his super-Saint Potter trainers, terminally goo-goo-eyed and lacking his usual Malfoy chill all 'round!
"Of course I've not asked him!" Harry was appalled. "What do you think I am—a masochist?"
said; I don't even remember what it was now but you can't possibly take it seriously—you can't! And I'm trying to apologize to you, sincerely; I've been trying to find you in person to say it for ages now, if you'll only just hear me out, Harry. I bloody well owl you every damned day and I never hear back; don't even know if you've gotten them! I'm trying, Harry, alright? Give me a bit of a break, will you?"
!"—it took, he'd do it.
“Malfoy? You alright?” Harry looked up from his impressively cluttered desk with a startled glance. “Come on through, will you? Tea? You look horrid.”
Words—nothing but words, but ever so shattering.
preventing you from poking your head through his floo, is it?” Mills went to the door, pausing to shoot Harry a fond glance. “Though I imagine you’ve had your hands full enough, in your off hours.”
“Then why, Potter, are you in such a rush to duck and run, may I ask?” Draco drawled, his stance relaxing a scant millimetre or so. “It’s not as though you’ve anything to fear from me.”
Ron stopped in his tracks, causing the Huffle giggle-gaggle behind him to pile up in a flurry of squeaking limbs and pigtails. Then they sorted themselves out and streamed ‘round, wide-eyed and giggling.
“Mm-hmm, yes, please,” Harry said happily, the skin around his striking eyes crinkling up. He darted forward, pulling Draco into yet another quick one-armed hug before leaving go and turning toward the hearth. “Red, dryish, and don’t break the vault on it--I like it cheap and plentiful, same as the old days. Don't waste your decent cellar stuff on me, please. In fact, stop by that Tesco's on the way over tonight and pick up a couple bin ends, won’t you? We’ll likely need them both. Yes, definitely, once you see for yourself what’s been happening with Grimmauld.”
Such a fool, she…but then so was
Morning, noon and night Draco saw the damn Nursery suite and each time it seemed to be even more insidiously inviting, somehow.
“Cheers,” Harry replied, taking what Draco handed him, and they both got on in peaceful silence with the unshrinking of the takeaway and dishing out from the multitudinous cartons.
Draco scowled. Yes, he supposed Harry was sufficiently quick to deny Draco's stupid suspicions. But mayhap not quite fast enough to roust out all the seeds of darkling doubt that had sown themselves in Draco’s questioning mind. Though, on the other hand, Harry never, ever lied to Draco.
“No,” Draco admitted, heaving a sigh and slumping down off his elbows. "I know you don't." He let his head sink back into his favourite pillow and stared up at the canopy, ignoring his mate's still clingy ankles, still snugged up against his own. It was...distracting. “I suppose I'm not, either. Not really. Well…” Draco shook his head, fretful. “Maybe a little, but maybe that’s me being miffed with me.”
"Yes, well. She is a bitch, Hermione, no matter what you say! This is my heart she's breaking into bits, the little twat! Just by breathing! Wish she's sod off somewhere—choke on that gaudy stone she's got, then."
"I know—but is it the one he wants us to find, Harry? That'd be the crucial question, least to me. He's not exactly given over enough clues, has he? Barking Toad eggs are used freely, for one. Kneazle fur from a male calico is another—all common as your average armadillo ichor, really. Both have been listed for every damned Potion we've found so far.
"Hey!" Harry protested, feeling the need to quibble. Or at least vie for a modicum more of
"Uh?" Harry gave his companion a dubious look. "Wotcher, Draco?"
It had been his fault, he reckoned. It usually was, somehow.
"Mr. Kringleshanks! Yes—well, we were just going to ask to try those on. See—all right, Draco?—those in that red box, over there. With the rubies set in. That's okay, isn't it?"
The meal accomplished, still mostly in companionable quiet--except for Draco briefly regaling Harry with Teddy’s latest adventures in model-building with squashy bright-coloured materials (Harry had been in some emergency meeting at the Ministry and not able to be home at the time)--they each sagged back into the cushiony comfort of the sofa Draco had insisted also brought over from his study in the Manor.
"Yes?" Draco cocked a brow, tapping a toe tip lazily. "Further clues to report, Auror Trainee Potter?"
. I mean, I don’t know how it expects me to produce children without one, do you? I'm not signing it up for that as a singleton. I know my limitations, believe me.”
Gawds! Merlin's saggy behind! It practically fused his eyes blind, the horror of it. Weaselbee's naked freckled cock and Granger's equally bushy brown muff—right there before him, bobbing up and swooping down—naked! Nude! Starkers!
“Stay” is what he’d like to say, if he’d his druthers. He’d say it every morning and Draco would—if things were different than they were. He’d like to add a whole litany of suggestions as to what they could get up to should Draco stay, after. He’d a filthy fucking mind, Harry discovered—and that by accident only. By nature of a ‘Eureka!’ epiphany out on the pitch, as he watched Draco’s thighs cling to a broom one fine day.
“Al…right, Draco,” Pansy responded, after an extremely drawn-out and pregnant-with-a-full-litter-of Crup-puppies moment, during which Draco never took his attention from Potter’s fluid chase after the pesky, irresponsible Snitch. The Ravenclaw Seeker—silly git— wasn’t even in sight at the moment, having been left well behind when ‘the’ git flew upwards in that tight spiral—Potter, Draco would bet a thousand Galleons, would lay hands on the piss-ant uppity Snitch in a matter of seconds. It was a moment of finesse; he could almost taste it. “I suppose you wish to stay, then, for whole damned duration. What
His Father's hands were making some rather arcane and nasty gestures over that word. Draco didn't like the look of the one two-fingered flip, either.
with me!"
"Oi!" Draco heard faintly behind him, the anxiety and surprise in the beloved voice clawing residual trails across his bruised heart. "Git, what in Hades are you doing? Come back here this instant!"
“Shut
Harry shrugged. He wasn't so sure of that. After all, he'd just dropped the other boot—well, more like an entire cobbler's shop—and nothing too terrible had happened.
. If Harry were here, he'd deal. But Harry was not…clearly.
Fortunately, the twilights of May were long, lush and slow in coming.
“Hmm. Harry, Draco. Have you considered just giving them what they want, you two? I mean, it’s not the end of the world to have a child.” She thumbed over her shoulder, smiling, indicating Ron amusing Rosie out in the back garden, clearly visible through the glass doors leading out to the welter of assorted greenery. She narrowed her eyes upon Draco in particular, and smiled toothily. “For example. Pansy is always telling me you dote on the twins, Draco, and I know you’ve been incredibly good with Teddy; Andromeda never stops singing your praises. Rosie is head o'er heels for you, always, and don't think I don't realize that feeling is mutual, alright? So. I’d think
“Fuck Peesely,” Draco shot back nastily, disregarding Harry’s instinctive flinch and look of disgust. “When will that Veritus wear off, Potter? That’s the real problem we have right now; the report can go hang. How long yet?”
! They burn!"
“No.” Malfoy sneered, looming. “You’ve had ages. Tell me now or I hex.” He aimed the tip of his wand right at Harry’s Auror badge, eyes narrowing to dangerous slits. “Oh, and? Have I mentioned recently just how much I utterly abhor your habit of concealing your all too frequent injuries? Or your damnable tendency to shrug off all your brushes with death as if they were but paltry nothings? Because I feel I should remind you of this peeve of mine right now, Potter. Talk!”
"Hardly!" Draco scoffed at them, scowling. "As if, Weaselbee. No, I'm here because you two are total nit—"
Draco doggedly kept on to the meat of the matter: establishing a favour owed. “And I—ah, well…I suppose you may borrow my copy, Potter, if you promise not to dog-ear the pages nor damage it in any way. Overnight, only. I can’t exactly spare it for long. I’m opting for a career in Advanced Potions, after NEWTS.”
. Yes, yes—it was, just as Father ranted—particularly
"Bird? What bird, mate?" Potter arched a wary eyebrow, cocking his head enquiringly. "Are you sure you're sleeping enough lately?"
Draco smiled gleefully but restrained himself from sticking his tongue out at Weaselbee and saying 'So there!'
"You know," Parkinson was tapping her chin rapidly with a scarlet lacquered fingernail, her dark eyes alight, "we can tart him all up and round up some eligible Sixths for the panel."
"You can," Harry insisted, pursing his lips and wrinkling up his nose, as if Draco were dense as a thicket and just wasn't twigging something so obvious. But to him, only him. "You must. We're over with, Draco. Have been. Old news."
"Darling, really." Mumsy had tightened her perfectly polished fingernails—both sets now and set firmly upon both of his papa's rearing shoulder. "Be still." A straining Lucius was abruptly hauled back from the Manor's Floo fire. "Shut it now; there's a dear. Let Draco handle his own life for once."
“Potter?”
eat like an actual adult does at dinner time but that you’re still somewhat peckish and I’ll tell you something better instead.” He glanced pointedly at their coffee table, where he’d slung the shrunken packets of takeaway. And smiled grimly. “Yes, indeed. Something very nice, Potter. Potter.
He and Harry might even be able to duck Father's inevitable fury, simply invoking a solid shield of Malfoy nappies. A bit of appeasement for the old git, perhaps? A diversion, at the least.
"That's a lie!" Draco lunged stiffly forward, hands first, desperate and incensed. It was such a lie, the worst ever! "I do
-crackity—
It would be sure to cost him, too. Waiting patiently for however long it took, when all he wanted was to have Harry as his own. But...but. It would be worthwhile, yes. Better to handle it properly that risk—
"Ohgods!" Harry swore, as Malfoy ran a hand down his sternum and his robes and the shirt beneath fell open. "Please!" he said again, and clutched at Malfoy's wide shoulders. "I want—ca-can we?"
"No worries," Harry grinned widely at her, profoundly relieved he'd not have to perform a Wronski as well as the damned Hygieian. He saw Luna nod acknowledgement out of the corner of his eye. "Happens all the time, Ichika-san; we're accustomed. Carry on, then."
"M-M-Marrying m-m-me?" Draco attempted again to spit it out. "You, Potter? M-Me?"
, Harry! You hated it here. You couldn't wait to leave!"
Harry glanced instantly away, eyes moving about the room but barely taking in the smudged scrolls stacked by the bookcase, the hat rack adorned with a few random Muggle jackets and caps or the artificial beams of late afternoon light filtering through the dusty blinds shading the Magick’d window.
Draco snogged him; instantly reeled him in right in the middle of the shop, wrapping his arms all the way 'round Potter's slighter form, engulfing him, and stuck his tongue right down Harry's throat, forcing back those last few words, cutting off the terrible word 'if' at the nub, silencing it thoroughly. There was no 'if' involved—no! Potter
Gods, but Malfoy was gorgeous!
Silence was all he got in response. Dreary, awful silence. One dull thud of his heart; two; three—would this moment never end?—and his heart beats were getting faster, as this rather indescribably awful sensation swept through Draco's body (one part shame, one part terror, two parts or more, even, of excruciating embarrassment). What would Potter say to that? What
"Oh, gawds almighty, you really
"Still and all…it
“Some Muggles think the claviform symbolized Woman,” Luna remarked idly, her expression serene. “In the motherly sense, I suppose. Logically enough.”
Harry found his feet, shedding assorted sundries as he came, weaving just a bit. Draco raised a chilly eyebrow and observed the mess the git was inadvertently creating, all over their nice tidy parlour.
"You're sure of that?" Harry seemed highly dubious, despite the serene stillness. "She might come back. I've had her sneak up on me before, you know, when I was least expecting it. You mustn't take anything for granted here, Draco—
"Yes," Draco sneered, disgruntled just thinking his new 'improved' Nursery. "And I'd very much like it to fucking
Gift to: kitty_fic*
“What? No!”
That sent Potter into peals of laughter, which was exactly what Draco intended, and he allowed himself a wicked grin as he slathered the lube carefully 'round Potter's not-quite-virgin arsehole. The pucker was delicate and pink and Draco could've lavished hours on it, enticing Potter into quivering, breathless readiness—indeed, inducing him to come, without ever touching his cock—but they didn't have hours.
"Are you baffled, Potter?" Malfoy's voice—another one of Harry's inner pitfalls of want-need-lust—sounded quite close to his one ear. "We don't want that, do we?" Git had dropped down his knees when Harry wasn't noticing and was sharing a good half of Harry's rug, arse situated not a hand's-breadth away from the fist harry leant upon for balance; a bony hip budging his familiarly and knuckled hands planted on either side of Harry's half-raised shoulders. He was effectively trapped. "Don't be. This is pretty easy to follow, what happens next."
“Oh, er. Really?’ Potter looked to genuinely interested. “That’s good, Malfoy. And, um—thanks, yeah? Nice of you to offer.”
"Oh." Draco blinked right back down at him, the level of his concern spiking abruptly upward once more. “Um, you can’t?”
"Yes, so sorry, Longbottom, no such luck," Pansy echoed, sneering. "Now, as to when we schedule this debacle—I was thinking Saturday next, in the Room of Requirement."
"Here, but why here, Harry? The wards," Draco breathed out, still staring about him and feeling shocked shiteless, not really minding his ex-boyfriend's words because his ex-boyfriend's old house was so incredibly different. Like the flat, actually, but also

“What?”
"Like this, then," Malfoy murmured, and fingers tickled at the hollow of one of Harry's hips. Cloth vanished and he was naked below Malfoy's descending school robes and shivering at the sudden kiss of air over his skin. "Just like this, Potter. Open wide for me."
"Oi!" Harry, startled, lost his little puzzled half-grin. "What're you on about now, Draco?"
"But I might've guessed." Draco shrugged slightly, his hand sliding to Harry's nape. "If I'd thought."
"Ahhhh…." Weasley sighed Draco's way, a long exhale of stymied tension releasing that had him flapping a hand pointlessly, gesturing acceptance of the bloodlessly sane judgment his girlfriend had brought low upon their hapless host. Hermione caught the hand, clasped it and glared at Draco hard enough for the both of them, all business, brown eyes sparkling challenge.
He incanted the lovely spell that simultaneously stretched and lubed; Draco shivered in reaction to it, his stomach rubbing queasily across the faded plush of the divan.
Draco opened his mouth to suggest certain other not-quite-as-well-known ways of calming the overwrought that Potter taught him, but then folded his lips tight-shut immediately. No point in irking Mum, as well. She could handle Father, being the consummate Slytherin; she could handle damned near

it was. Is."
“Too right,” Harry murmured back. “Shhh!”
"They do, " Potter nodded wisely.  He took a deep breath, straightened his posture. "Right. And, as it happens, and remember I’ll likely have to kill you if you breathe a word to anyone, even your own mum, I’ve been triply promoted since, direct from the field." He shrugged casually, sending the fine fabric creasing across his shoulders and torso, as if this were nothing, just a trifle noted in passing. "Before you even ask, Mysteries operates a little differently than most departments, alright. So...Don't ask, mate. But it's why I'm here now. In Ancient Runes Head Office. It's mine, you see. I'm the Head High Muckity-Muck Thingie. The boss."
Nott only smirked.
Harry didn’t say further, his face gone quite still and grave all the sudden.
"And Longbottom will fall upon the Sword of Gryffindor in a fit of wounded pique—I know, I know, Potter," Malfoy groused. "I've heard your reasons before; they still don't impress me."
, idiot."
"Oooooh, Draco!" his heart-mate growled, trailing sloppy kisses across Draco's disappeared part and all through his marvelously mussed tendrils of curling fairer-than-fair hair. "Oh, my love, you're so—so—beau—Ahh! Ah-
A Resounding Success!
“Shut up and watch the match, you two. And don’t ask stupid questions. It’s called school spirit, for your information. And we Slytherins had better be making a show of it.”
"Hmm," he grunted. "Not so sure about that. Though, I don't hear anything," he added in a low mutter. "A'tall."
ready!"
"Come on, Potter," Draco whinged. "A game." He nudged Harry's shoulder. "Play, play, play a game."
There it was, though. It filled Harry's lungs with the aroma of a thousand flowering Edens; it caused his normally sturdy knees to buckle and his virgin arse to ache hungrily. The fringes of his daily life were entangled intricately within that awareness—there was, very simply, no easy avoidance nor escape of Malfoy. If there were, Harry didn't want to know about it, anyway. Wrong
Harry shifted, settling his nicely suited bum back against the edge of his desk and flapping a careless hand at the rich furnishings.
"And each duo will come up with some sort of game that's original—"
; this is all your brilliant idea!"
: They have much to teach one another, Potter and Malfoy, and particularly about sharing. Thank Merlin for the existence of re-dos and sandwiches.
"That's true, mate, sorry," Thomas horned in. "I've had the pleasure of being consulted as to how to unlock Harry's wards—not that you can, mind you. Not that anyone can."
“Yes, well, ta. It's definitely an improvement over the hole in the wall I had before."
“Oh, yay. Rah, Potter,” Pansy waved a bobble on her balaclava apathetically. “Rah.”
"Do," Malfoy added, and did the 'looking down his aquiline nose' thing that always irritated the Weasel immediately.
"So?" he asked, shrugging again. "I say we wing it. Works for me."
He turned back to his best mate, frowning in a very dampening manner. Ron was eyeing him speculatively, chewing. He opened his mouth but Harry forestalled him hastily.
Harry could relate.
“Mind!” Draco barked, catching Harry by the shoulder in a strong one-handed grip, just in time to prevent him from tipping sideways. “Idiot. Merlin, you were, weren’t you? Trying it on with me, acting as if nothing worth fussing about with had happened, you sneaky git!” he hissed, glaring and righting Harry on his seat with a gentle shove on the bicep. "Unconscionable!" He pulled back, standing up tall and straight with an irritated huff. “I swear, Potty-head, one day I really am going to--”
"But, Hermione—you don't follow, do you? Astoria's a girl, alright. Looks like a bloody carthorse but she's got girl bits. It's hopeless, alright? Completely."
Weasley were loitering conspicuously in the Hogwart's entryway, glowering and brandishing wand tips furtively under cover of their robes as they paced. But they

"Did—did I?" Harry turned back abruptly so their noses banged together. He blinked furiously at both the minor pain and the major bewilderment that swamped him. "Look, er—what exactly

"I'm not really sure…I mean, what the feck? Is this a joke?"
“I…see.” Pansy’s tone was unnaturally grave. “Certainly, darling.”
—and then a roar.
Harry heard in his head. He jumped two feet straight up, startled. That was…Draco? He was hearing Draco, clear as a bloody bell?
Harry's expression went blank, as he considered briefly the consequences of grabbing one of those perfectly cobbled loafers: a twist of the ankle would send Malfoy tumbling down atop him…and it might be considered an accident, his inevitable rough grope. He'd give most anything to get his fingers on that arse, even a thorough hexing by a brat of an ex-Death Eater. Malfoy smelt so very good, it was heady—intoxicating.
He Summoned one. It floated about their heads, a neatly pressed and monogrammed offering to good manners. Harry simply stared blankly at it, red-eyed and silent, stone still as if Draco had Petrificus'd him instead of only shouting a little and providing the git a chance to blow his snotty nose.
He was not best pleased.

“Hmm,” Harry nodded his understanding. “It is the same in Europe and the UK, and don’t even ask us about Africa or the Middle East. Too many Muggles; hard to keep track of the bad apples amongst them. Not when our business is fending off the bloody Wizarding rotters. But, no,” he added, shifting his gaze over to Luna. “I see nothing that a few simple Conservatus castings won’t fix. Shall we?”
"Harry, you're not thinking at all sensibly," Hermione remarked, calmly flicking a page over. "Now that we've all settled down and got ourselves sorted out finally I'd expect Malfoy also has some spare time to spend on his personal life. He's seventeen, isn't he? No—eighteen, now. Look, give the gi—man a chance, will you? He's a looker, at least. Nicely built—not hard on the eyes. And you! You should be having some fun, Harry. No more of this pointless obsessing and emoting! Bloody
"Oh! Ah. Really? You think so? Father would actually…with Harry?…eventually?"
“Well, yes, Pansy,” Draco nodded absentmindedly. “That’s how you do it, to stay astraddle when you’re cornering. Not that you’d know that, seeing as you despise flying.”
been list—"
There was heard a high-pitched squeal from Draco as he came, in torrents and torrents, and an answering gurgle-gasp-'GAH!' from Harry as he also ejaculated, his cock shimmying, his leaky arsehole clenching and releasing. Spunk flew, far and wide, in a spray of motile freewheeling tidbits, decorating texts that explained Dragonology and texts that delved into the Mysteries of the Sphynx. Their book bags, their quills, even their abandoned chairs: all were spattered with a fine spray of Wizarding come—which, somewhat extraordinarily, shimmered in a shade of aqua-blue-violet.
"Don't be a wet blanket, Harry," Malfoy snapped. "I didn't say we have to do it all at once, did I? I mean, we can start off right now, but that doesn't mean everyone's forced to pair up and get jiggy by tomorrow, either."
“Lessee? You like my dick up your bum, maybe?”
at all—"
“I have,” Luna smiled. She rose to her feet, casually stepping back into her shoes and spelled her cup clean with a lazy wave of her wand. “Here you are, Millicent. Harry, if that’s all?”
"We'll play a game, Potter," Draco grinned in return, his gaze promising all sorts of creativity behind those Charmed hangings. "Just the two of us."
"Well, then—you have to let me, Harry," Draco had told him. "I want to do it. I wanted to give you one of my own; that's much better—"
," he repeated, insistently. "If you can't be civil, then you need to take yourself off. I won't stand for it. I told you."
“Really?” That smarmy set of horribly well-bred features went all twinkly-evil as Malfoy leered like a common perv. “How much time is there left, did you say? Can we? Go again?”
Draco blinked at him for another endless second and then cast down his glinting eyes, focusing furiously on the hollow at Harry's throat, where his pulse beat like a frightened bird.
-go; to keep, to hang on to, no matter
“Oh! That,” Harry nodded wisely. “That 'Condition' you mentioned and then didn’t have the opportunity to tell me about, at dinner. I was wondering about that…” He cocked his chin inquisitively, a glint of reproach in his gaze. "You know, you could have said something a great deal sooner. It's been a week since I heard a peep out of you, git."
“Erm, pardon; to what advice do you refer? Tell me.”
“Bother you, would it?” Harry, despite the distraction of being pinned to a surface that was only dubiously clean, and despite the most definite violation of his privates by a slimy great Slytherin who mocked him wherever he got a chance, was very much back in control of himself. He smirked at the git who scowled at him. Tightened his sphincter like a noose, too, just because he could. “Being…contained, Malfoy? Hemmed in, even?”
Yes, he'd tidied his person up a bit but he was nothing like his usual. A blind man could see he was laboring beneath a heavy weight. A deaf man could hear the unspoken 'please' which flavoured every syllable out of his mouth. He might as well say it aloud as much as he could manage; what did he have left to lose by begging, by playing the cur Hermione named him? If he was to be the dog here, he'd be the terrier, the one who always ferreted out his rat?

“Nnnngh!”
And—above everything, even his own ingrained Slytherin nature, compelling him to protect himself—Draco wanted
"Harry—Harry, come home with me," Draco interrupted, fiercely. "Don't talk about it. Just. Please—please just
"Don't bet on it," Thomas murmured. "Look at Malfoy."
“Oh…kay, Harry,” she said. She looked at him for a while longer, as if it were something odd, his theory concerning the largest body of water he knew and Malfoy’s bloody hair.
“My cock hurts, it’s so hard, wanting you, and my thighs are cramping from staying still, not taking you—and you’re beautiful and I hate and love that you are—and I’m in so deep, I don’t care—“
Not on, not on, not
“Well, bollocks—onna—bleeding—stick!” he gasped, waving off the cup. “M-Mal—ack! Hargh!”
"I…hope you like it," he managed, poking the spellotape on his. "I mean, it took me a while, looking…"
“Yes,
. I was more than provoked—and don't you dare tell me what I can and can't do, Draco Malfoy. Just leave now, like I keep asking you to. Go away. Get out, you!" Harry snapped his teeth like a mad dog when Draco pressed closer.
"Arrghh!" Weasley was still hovering, and the rest of the Common Room was watching curiously, always ready to focus on the famed Potter-Malfoy rivalry and attendant altercations. "You're both seriously sick-making, you know that? Do, please, stop already. Get a room."
"Or gloves," Draco continued as if Harry hadn't squirmed in his seat and blushed at all. "The perfect gift, aren't they, for the man who seems to have everything?"
“Um, mate?” Ron wrinkled his brow at Harry and for a moment appeared as genuinely concerned as he claimed to be. “Alright?”
"Oh, yes," Harry mumbled, tongue inserting itself in the seam between thigh and groin, newly revealed now that boxers had joined Draco's sleep pants, carelessly flung off to one side of his spread legs. Harry was between his knees, head buried against Draco's springy blond shot hairs, and snuffling like a pig rooting truffles. "Say my name, Draco. Say 'Harry', luv—I'm not just Potter, am I?"
"Oh!"
When the heroic git licked at Draco's cock—all along the underside, slowly pressing the flat of his tongue against the throbbing vein…and then softly, teasing, moist lips trailing over the swollen head as if it were a lolly, presented for his pleasure, Draco nearly shrieked his annoyance—his arousal.

. No, and you really must excuse me now--I need--I mean, I
A pleasant one, rather, to go about creating.
"Well…ahem…th-thanks. Super, Mum." Draco heaved a tiny sigh of relief; perhaps he could yet escape his uncomfortably antique seat without further maternal grilling? Maybe? "I will, then, Mum. Take it with me. Thank you."
"Oh, no! Bosh. Excuse me, Dream Harry; a moment whilst I--just--make--certain. Once more."
"Love you, too, git."
That was a bit of an alright, Harry being a reluctant early waker. Or rather, he would struggle up from the usual nightmare and lie huddled fœtal in his bed, not shifting, not stirring, but with eyes wide open, drying out, and staring into space, caught up in the wish that the grey light of dawn would function as a great eraser for his troubled mind. Time would pass, like treacle dripping, and the sky would lighten at the dorm windows: four o’clock, five o’clock, six. Then he’d fall back asleep finally,
gasp, but it wasn't an issue—Draco seemed just as excited as he, really. "
"Sorry about that," Potter said casually, after a minute or two of companionable walking had passed, side-by-side, knuckles brushing now and then. They were nearly to the village; Draco could see the church spire ahead and the familiar flags flapping desultorily in the morning breeze. It carried an underlying chill—no doubt due to the snow lying still on the nearby mountains—but it was still pleasant.
It was really rather…fascinating.
Draco, a perplexed and befuddled young Wizard, returned her approving stare for a long moment before dropping his chin and balefully regarding his own long legs, crossed at the ankles demurely. He was, he decided, experiencing a high degree of mortification. Mum was actually taking a personal interest in his unconventional light o' love, an act of kindness no normally frosty Malfoy matron would even remotely consider—but then, hadn't it been demonstrated that neither he nor his redoubtable Mum were 'normal' Malfoys?
“Cheers, then,” Luna smiled, throwing up the scattering of sparkling floo powder. “Ottery St. Catchpole!”
“We chat rather regularly about you, naturally, and of course about Harry, most recently. Which is unusual in and of itself for her Ronald and my Blaise, as generally it’s only ever them blabbering about what the kids get up to and then Quidditch matches. Oh, and sometimes mother-in-laws. Very touchy subject, mother-in-laws.”
“And you’ve not, gaol-bait." Malfoy leered, wriggling his hips about in a scandalous fashion. "Puppy! Nor will you, not for another month or more. Which makes me the elder and wiser of the two of us, I think. Certainly I wasn't the one who landed us both in the suds this time, now was I?”
Just this…scant meetings in-between cases and the occasional feel of Draco's palm spread at the small of his back in the Ministry lifts. As if by accident, should anyone be looking at them.
“What? Since when?” Draco demanded, diverted from his own troubles. “Mum, he’s not said a word to me about that. Well, it's more he's not said a word to me about
"Yes, you git," Harry chuckled, from his vantage point high up over the grounds of Hogwarts. He peered about him. Draco was nowhere in the Castle, so he must be elsewhere—and Harry could practically feel him close by. "He does indeed like the shagging! And your bloody cock!"
If that's what—"Ah! Ahhh,
"You're damned right, Potter, it
…Which was how it came to be that rudesby Granger and the lump of a Weaselbee sat upon their contrary arses upon a sofa in the Room of Requirement, propped with popcorn, pretzels, salted nuts and an ever-full pitcher of pumpkin juice ('And butterbeer for Ron," Harry had added, smiling, ''cause likely he'll be wanting something stronger, yeah?')
reasonable limits. And he, though he was immensely proud of being 'the one' Harry came home to, the man Harry relied on when all chips were down on the table, was not at all happy with this bloody
Draco growled possessively—wordlessly—and shoved Harry over, a quick arm and wing sliding 'neath his head and back even as the tables were turned. He found himself laid out flat, Draco hustling between his parted thighs, tearing Harry's clothes off as he went with talons flashing. Shreds of cloth were flung hither and thither.
He fingered the pendent Harry had given him for Valentine's whilst he waited for Lucius to regain speech. It was somehow immensely helpful in restoring his disturbed inner equilibrium: a tiny golden snake, with emerald eyes. He'd gifted Harry with a whole new wardrobe and the latest model Nimbus in return but hadn't felt as though either was really effectual in demonstrating his happiness with having Harry in his life.
"So dreadfully sorry," Draco told the Lake water skimming his toes as he dipped down, lower and lower, his slow dolorous wing beats carrying him far too close to the wavelets lapping the shore.
"Pfft!" Draco snorted. "Even Pince has to sleep some time, Harry—poor old dragon."
“Sure, mate,” Nott nodded carefully. “Whatever.”
gits. Gits, gits, gits!
Millicent took herself away, banging the door behind her and leaving Harry to briefly contemplate the possible alternate Eidwazian paths of Portkeying to Lascaux or journeying all the way to Peru...or perhaps, just perhaps, sticking his head through the floo and hailing his old mate Malfoy. Perhaps nipping out for a spontaneous pint at Draco's local? He cast a glance at his office clock, which was grand and impressive and read just after half eleven. Surely even the sleepy old codger who ran it had bestirred himself by now and likely poor Draco was as fatigued of sexual-appetite inducing food as he was?
what Harry should've expected all along, this Malfoy disease he was afflicted with so rudely. Served him right, didn't it? A sort of comeuppance?
Draco could still hear Harry’s chuckling echoing in his ears as he rushed through a very rapid version of his usual morning routine. Truly, it wasn’t much more than fifteen minutes before he entered the drawing room in search of Harry.
"Me too, guys." Goyle reached for his wallet.
," Granger interrupted, jumping into the show the three of them were evidently putting on for the delectation of all the rest of Hogsmeade-goers. She was also apparently unable to keep quiet even if the topic was none of her bloody business, Draco thought privately, but she at least didn't haul off and slap Draco silly. Or hadn't, yet. Time would tell, he supposed. "You know it's only that we care very much for you, being your mates, and we're—well, to be brutal, Harry, Malfoy here is certainly the very
“Ta, and yes. Cheers, Boss. Have at it. But in a fun sort of way, naturally.”
Oh, but his Harry was ever so fit—and ever so fanciable! Draco, entirely derailed by manly beauty and awestruck by a clear gaze that seemed to pierce right through his heart, was certain he couldn't possibly be more ecstatic it was Harry his Veela Fate had chosen for him. Ah, to marry Harry and spend a lifetime in the git's company would be all the good things life could ever provide him—and more! Certainly he'd a job of work to do before him, a task that would consume years, restoring the Malfoy name to some sort of respectability, fashioning himself into a person Harry could be proud to have on his arm—but if Harry was with him, all along the way? Oh, bliss!
interested. Painful, yeah?
"Not a
It was the Veela, too. Those wings, that scent—that intensity of desire, as if there was nothing else that existed for Draco Malfoy but Harry Potter. Harry didn't kid himself. He might not be as susceptible as everyone else was, but Draco Malfoy was already someone special. He took up centre stage in Harry's brain—always had.
That is, if the dorm were home and his mattress his safe house and Draco his refuge—well…
“Exist to keep you awake and aware, Archmage Potter, and up on all suits whilst you’re Head and on premises,” Millie replied sedately, a glitter in her sharp eyes and edge to her smile. “As it should be. Bye-bye, now.”
me," Potter ordered, insistent now, and his eyes were on level with Draco's reluctant ones, and Draco's lashes could only shield him so well before Harry's stare pierced through. "Tell me, please. Draco. What did you want to say? Because I want to hear."
"Tomorrow," Malfoy repeated grimly. Thrust up with a sideways grind and Harry groaned his absolute surrender, the scant inch he'd held back in fear collapsing before Malfoy's demand. He slid slack into arms that gripped him tightly, and he'd not noticed this before but Malfoy was firm all over—a bloody rock he'd been ruthlessly castaway upon, and as obdurate. "Harry, tomorrow—and the next day—and the next."
"Look, er, Potter," Draco began, shifting uneasily from one foot to the other. "I, um."
“Oh, shut it,” Harry said fondly, stepping back at last out of Draco's personal bubble. He grinned, a bit cat-in-the-cream, his eyes sparkling with amusement behind his stylish specs. "Don't take the piss, you. I like my new office, ta very much. It's nice, right?"
"Confused? Poor Potty."
It sprang apart at the seam, the paper, too soon for his liking, and he saw a glimpse of velveteen-covered box lurking beneath. Cufflinks, maybe? Last year had been a tie tack, discreetly carved with the Potter family crest. Tucked in the mug box, like an afterthought.
"…Two."
Above all, Draco was sincere. Slytherins could be, when it was important. Look at Pansy: she’d sincerely apologised to the git for trying to rat him out to the Dark Lord and had been forgiven, the bint. Before everyone on the whole Great Hall, too. It had been very impressive and touching.
Harry's eyebrows went soaring up in wonder, even as the fingers were joined by a third, all twisting.
“Mad, mad as a Humdinger, utterly barmy as fuckall, entirely skint of grey matter, what the fuck's
“Good.”  Hermione smiled, pleased. "It's best if you understand that these aren't malicious acts against either of you. More a matter of survival, I should think, at least from the perspective of your houses. They wish to thrive once more, and you're the available vessels. Means to an end, that's all."
"Ponce."
“Hermione, I think our lad here might be sickening for something,” he remarked ‘round his breakfast, contemplatively. “Awfully distracted lately, our Harry; went right off to sleep last night over my new
"Come on—spit it out, Malfoy," Potter urged. His lips were on Draco's temple at present, and he'd tugged insistently at Draco's neck and shoulders to get him to bow his unwilling head down those crucial inches so that they could rest there comfortably. Draco fought the increasing need to simply bury his crinkled forehead against Potter's collarbone and let him have his way. Potter always did in any case; the berk was an unstoppable force of nature. "Talk to me."
“Urghh-gah-gah-gah!” Ron wheezed and gasped, flinging his large body over and about the platters of breakfast foods in some form of ‘dying swan’ dance. “Bleeeech!”
Utterly reversed, in fact, to a mirror image of what they'd been before. One day he was metaphorically drowning in Dark Lord-inspired guilt and terror and literally choking on his own blood from where the git's spell had sliced him open, the remains of his weak tears salting his wounds—indeed, had almost perished from that spell--and then the very next moment he was snogging his greatest enemy—and ruthless attacker—in the corridors and empty lecture halls and loos of Hogwarts, as if he'd been born solely for the purpose of doing so. And--this being the kicker, the icing on his pudding--being repeatedly assured by the school's ancient, doddery,  and entirely too knowing Headmaster that he personally didn't have to die or murder or poison anyone—that

"No," Draco agreed, equably enough, "you wouldn't. There's no one here, Harry. Nothing to hear. Nada, nyet,

, the title read, in faded golden lettering,
"Then tell them," Malfoy muttered, eyes fixed blankly on a dusty old Weird Sisters poster someone had permanently stuck to the opposite wall. "And be very clear as to your intentions, Potter. I'll not be played."
"Naturally. There's no harm to it, Draco, dear." His Mum reached out and offered up a tiny pat to his fisted hands, clasped in his lap, apropos perhaps the uneasy scowl flittering across her son's expression. The fingers of one tense were pried open and she pressed the box into his damp palm before sitting back with a quiet sigh.
“Unngh!” Harry rolled his eyes at it and then visibly struggled to stay focused on his looming blond menace. “Stop trying to distract me, Malfoy—it’s not going to work!”
“Departmentally, Harry?” Luna cocked a brow at him. “Alright there?” She glanced about her, smiling dreamily at the Picasso. "Here, rather. You know."
"Please-please-please!" Harry returned the hiss thought tight-clamped teeth, the edges of them pinching his lower lip. "Oh!"
"Isn't it sweet?" Harry prodded at him, tickling Draco's perspiring ribs. "They're so in love it's gross, yeah?"
"You. You know we are," Draco pleaded. "You
He and Harry: partners. To the death, through the life, and beyond. Forsaking all others, and happily so!
"I mean, I still want you—you're really fit, Draco. That's not changed," he gabbled. "The way you—and we're sort of compatible. I mean,
"Lev-levitate, er? Um, levitate corporum!" Harry cried out—and they swooped up, achieving a slow steady spin above the library table.
"Yessss," Harry moaned. "Alright, stop saying that—you're correct, okay? But that doesn't matter in the slightest, Hermione! Git still wouldn't look my way, not like that, at least, even if I landed on him naked and gift-wrapped in Galleon notes! He's all set to marry that Greengrass bint—somebody blah-blah Slytherin's younger sister, I think. Dora? Dymphna? Whatever."
you're…? You're…?"
What had he to lose, anyway? Loneliness? Lack? Fear?
Harry tarried not a moment more; his Patronus galloped off, misting through his office door. Snatching up a handful of powder, he tumbled through his floo and nearly straight into Draco’s arms.
"Nope," Draco huffed. He raised his chin and glared down his nose at Harry. "Not at all. We invent the game this time, not follow someone else's guidelines. Totally different."
"He'll laugh his sodding arse off, Hermione. It's me, remember? Me and him—we don't mix, damn it. Oil and water. Piffle feathers and veronica root. Whatever. You know how it goes."
Harry grunted. But didn’t look up from the battered old book he was perusing intently. Nor did he make the slightest effort to hand Draco the telly wand.
Finnegan, and Thomas, and Merlin knew who knew what other ex-Gryffindors were involved in this cozy little in-ex-House debacle, but Draco bet it would amount to the whole pitiful lot of them, one way or another) to be his bosom buddies. His mates, his pals, his extended family. It was an after-effect of the war, Draco figured, the way Harry felt about these people and in a way it had worked to his decided advantage. Harry had such a huge heart, under all that lousy grooming and careless manner.
"As a matter of fact, Mister Malfoy…my extended family just happens to specialize in the very thing! How…fortunate, isn't it?" Floribunda trilled. "I'll direct you."
“Fucking hell, Draco, you obsessed arse,” Theo growled. “Up yours with Potter’s broomstick, then. Perving on Potter while we freeze and burn.”
“Potter,
"No! You're
“Yes! Yes, you are, Harry Potter!” Scowling, Draco stamped his foot, which only produced an annoyingly muffled thud from the plush carpet. “Or--Or maybe you’re not Harry at all? Blaise, is that you? Are you pranking me again? You bloody bastard!”
.  And now Draco was a mere shadow of himself, a moored ghost. Voiceless and void.
“Malfoy!” he snarled, his voice chock-full of warning. “Gitface, he’ll be back before we know it! You want to end up doing this up on Astronomy Tower? Do you? You know how fucking chilly it is up there, even in bloody June? The wind, Malfoy—the wind!”
Draco was a bleeding aberration: a Malfoy who wore his heart on his robe's sleeve. And if his own Mum could provoke this sort of unbalanced response merely by poking her nose in his private affairs, Draco was in far deeper shite than he'd realized.
. Wouldn’t either—not now. No reason to. The Dark Lord was no more!
“Three,” Hermione continued entirely unfazed, though she quirked a quizzical brow at Harry’s hissing, “this an unusual situation in and of itself, what with the sort of Magical sentience we’re encountering here making itself known so overtly. It’s extreme, abnormally so. Draco’s correct, I think; it’s an Ancient Magic at work, insidious and deep. I’ve no doubt in my mind at all that previous generations who’ve dwelt at Malfoy Manor and Grimmauld Place have never even questioned to what degree they were influenced by their homes when they made their personal choices as to whether to have children--or not. They just sort of did it, went with the flow, and didn’t suffer any existential crises about being manipulated by a smart stack of brick-and-mortar--”

"And you'll wear it? Not take it off?" Potter seemed very uncertain.
The blur of Draco's hidden thoughts were all at once golden-and-silver; they bloody sparkled with brilliance. Harry felt a great wave of what could only be the essence of 'happy', crashing across the conduit the magical ring had laid open.
“It’s nothing dire, really,” Potter insisted, giving Draco’s forearm a fond pinch. “Or rather, it’s nothing that can’t be managed, I’m positive. Nobody’s dying, no one’s Cursed, there’s no real damage...yet. Jera, Draco. But it’s also something we can get to, right? After supper. Yours, too. I've not forgotten for an instant you have a 'Condition', Draco. No fear.”

“Pfft! Huh, you're still here, then," he remarked sharply, whipping his sleeve back down his abused arm and casually taking up his mug again. "Not a dream." He wafted it at Potter, lips curling upward in a cynical smile. "I do actually see you standing here before me, in our flat, on a Saturday morning, in the flesh, proposing brunch at a café, although that’s bloody unheard of. Potter, are you feeling quite the thing?”
, Pans! His foot clipped the hoop, there! Just now! And he didn’t even blink, the git! Did you see?
"Jealousy, twat," Hermione announced, "is counter-productive." Ron huffed, nodded again—sharply, smugly-at Draco's mumbling confession, his cheeks mottling faintly red with stifled ire. Draco paled, impossibly so. Had he said that last out loud?

"Draco?" Harry, clearly perplexed, regarded Draco with huge green orbs behind kiss-smudged lenses and a succulent mouth pinkened and damp from their oral activities. "Draco? What's that you're mumbling at me now? And get up off the floor, dolt—it's likely filthy! We were snogging, remember? Why'd you stop all the sudden?"
"Oh fuck!" Silence. Dead silence and then Harry swallowed noisily, the first—the only—sign of a crack. One he was instantly, hastily patching smooth again, flinging out his words like a scatter of verbal gravel. "I can't—you're not. Wait. No. No, it's like this, alright? I lied, that's all," Draco was informed briskly. He watched narrow-eyed as Harry threw up his hands in a defeated gesture. "About loving you. It was a fib, a dare, from the very start—a means to an end, Malfoy. My mates bet me, dared me to have you in bed, show you what's what. And it wasn't anything much, just…well, maybe Ron's got a little lingering resentment, but Hermione doesn't. Well, whatever, they knew I thought you were fit. And George said I should go for it, see if you'd play. So, yeah." Harry shrugged. "A total fabrication, all of it, nothing more. I wanted your body and I wanted to show off I had you, a bit. Famous Malfoy, on a string. Prove I could—that's it."
Draco inhaled sharply, standing quiescent in Harry’s grip, and gazed down at him in all seriousness, his expression returned to bland but his eyes glittering with a firestorm of emotions.
"Mum!"
Their old jest had the distinct ring of truth to it, Draco decided, feeling ominously perturbed. Harry was still clad in his Unspeakable robes, though they were unbuttoned and flapping about his legs as he busied himself with retaining both wine bottles and his glass while sidling in a polite crabwise motion towards the doorway. Draco frowned at the tense set of his friend's shoulders, at the feverishly brilliant glitter of his eyes, and even at the fact Harry had momentarily forgotten again the wonders of magic and was absentmindedly trying to juggle all that liquid-filled glassware. Huh! Clearly Harry hadn’t had a moment to himself since he’d arrived home and, if Draco knew his friend’s regretfully overcrammed work schedule, he’d been terribly late even departing the Ministry this evening.
says. It'll be fantastic, you'll see."
Right, then. Off he went.
"Potter—now! Get that damned ring on your damned finger right this minute!"
"Go on, then." Granger was coaxing him, in an imperiously impatient manner. "What exactly were you doing, Malfoy, to set Harry off like that?"
a convivial evening out with friends—
"I don't see how?" Patil whinged. "Really, Draco, Harry's right. We've done that, or something similar, when we put on the play and then the burlesque and ran the stalls for Hogwart's part of the Fair."
"Hrrhn." Ron nodded along one last time, rolling his eyes at Draco as Hermione marched over the hearth and threw ash at the floo, taking him with her. And then, finally, he addressed Draco, reluctantly, just before she dragged him bodily into the gout of lime flames. Well, growled, more like. "See you 'round, loser," he said flatly, with a hint of teeth. "Don't go mucking this up and force me to come back here and
“How so?” Draco demanded sharply, downing the remainder of his wine in one gulp. He coughed, raising a hand to cover his mouth politely. “Pardon.”
And private.
"No."
Pronunciation – yair-ah
It was as if Harry's calling card read 'Hero, Available Upon Demand'. Draco secretly rather admired that altruistic streak of the git's, as it did get things accomplished in a heartbeat, when Harry chose to pursue them: that brash energy, that brilliant charisma—but, alas, there

"Why should
. I won't have it. I'm not giving you up, Potter."
"You…" Draco shook his head slowly, eyes widening at nothing much in particular. Maybe the mantle, actually, with its dearth of pictures of the two of them. At home—at the flat—there were pictures of he and Harry everywhere, on every surface. "You're not serious." He rocked back on his heels, as if to align with a world suddenly shaken and upended. He inhaled sharply, gustily, and blew out a ragged breath. "Bite your tongue, Harry. You don't mean it."
"Yes," Harry grinned, triumphant. This was brilliant, this. He couldn't have imagined better if he'd schemed for a thousand years! "I am here, thanks. And yes. The answer to your proposal is yes, Draco Malfoy. I would be honoured. I hereby accept. Thank you—the ring is lovely and I'll always wear it as a sign—of—

“You’re sweet, Harry,” she said, leaning precariously across the tabletop and dropping a quick buss upon his scar. “And my perennial favourite Wizard, as always. Ta, then.”
"That's right, Nev," Finnegan added. "The Game has begun."
“Oi!” Draco gasped, shocked to the core. "What?!"
make your life miserable." With a significant glance at the hulk of a Weasley beside her, she amended, "Pardon.
“What is?” Harry asked, smiling as he sat himself down, stripping off his Ministry robes as an afterthought and slinging them round the back of his chair. Kreacher had thoughtfully resized the usually large dining table down to a far more intimate proportion. Harry leant forward and topped up their glasses from the bottle hovering at the ready. "My decor? My carpet choices?" There were only their two seats and barely room for the crowd of covered silver salvers on the polished surface. He lounged back, grinning sassily at Draco. “Drink up, mate. There’s so many things you hate about me, Draco. I've quite lost track. Which one is this?”
"I said to listen, Potter!"
“--and now I just can’t--I just--
Draco shivered and turned his head sharply to the left, examining the carved stone of the Witch's arm with great interest. The Witch was constructed of a grey marble—no, surely it was basalt, similar to the Hanging Stones he'd seen at Merrivale during a family outing there. Or, perhaps a metamorphous rock of some sort; granite? In any event, it was fascinating, what one could learn from intense observation to detail.
“Feel how mature I am? And I’m just quivering in my boots, Puny Potter,” Malfoy chuckled, pressing his naked cock against Harry's bum crack. “
He was accustomed to all that; it was Malfoy’s head that interested him.
"Doubted." Draco felt more than heard the tiny gulp, the bitter puff of air against his cheekbone. "You doubted me. You, of all people."
Besides, Malfoy might stroll by and see him and then sneer. Well, Malfoy might sneer anyway, but why hand him ammunition?
, a Malfoy! And you disregarded every rule of Purebloody Courtship, Harry. I have to make it right, somehow; don't you get it? Now, listen and listen well—"
"Pfft!" Hermione snorted, daintily, and remained behind the fastnesses of her book. "No, it's not," her white teeth clacked with a snap behind the ruffle of pages. "But...same end result, Harry. Nothing—a big fat heap of nothing. Now do be silent, please. If you're not planning on doing anything useful and to the point to solve your problems, as it seems you are totally set on, you can at least be quiet about it. I need this information for Creatures.

Then Harry’s best mate took a long lascivious lick over his half-consumed sage-and-onion banger, with a great deal of unnecessary tongue showing.
"That's it, exactly," Draco nodded courteously. Floribunda might look like a Hufflepuff—Hades, she might very well
“Mmpgh?” He waggled his eyebrows at her when she persisted in looking expectant. “Hmmph!”
“Fuck, no,” Draco snarled, elbowing his way forward so they were neck-to-neck, shoulders pressed tight, both of them glaring dangerously at the gaping maw as it opened. “Make room, git. In this together, remember?”
Like a burr under his saddle. It tickled away at him, at his consciousness, day and night. He was attracted, he was smitten, he was caught and
"Right. Spill, Malfoy. What's the real reason for this? I know you're up to something. Tell me," he coaxed. "It's more fun if you do, you know."
"He will," Harry sighed, inconsolably. "He'll laugh me right out of the room—he'll laugh like a Howler, I know it. I can't possibly, Hermione. Don't even ask it."
! and Harry could care less if the blasted thing killed him.
“Huh,” Harry grunted, pouring the larger part of his coffee down his dry and aching throat, even though it was still on the verge of scalding. It was spoon-dissolving strong and very highly caffeinated and that was exactly what was needed. “Not surprised. Shes’s a hard goer, has a lot of spirit to her, but still. Bit much when you’re not accustomed.”
“Er, some water? Juice?” he offered, snatching up Ron’s empty cup. Ron only glared at him, blue eyes blazing.
Finally parsing, Draco shot to his feet without even really seeing that his mug was free-floating, only aware in a very distant way that Harry had suspended the bloody thing with a spell, stopping it from splashing him all down his fresh robes and the sofa. He stood, valiantly striving not to wobble, and gaped wildly down at Harry.
, NARCISSA!"
"No!" Draco gathered his magical core, concentrating. The duplam penetratum wasn't easy and he'd need all his remaining attention—which wasn't much, given how Harry's skin undulated across his own. It was like holding a Harry-houri, a sensual wisp of liquid quicksilver desire. He clung, gripping harder to spine and to buttocks, changing grasp to upper arm and to nape. "No, it's all wandless. Just say the spell, Harry. And, er...trust me."
"Pfft!" Harry looked away abruptly, shifting his narrowed eyes elsewhere. "Important? 'Our lives', you say? Is it now, Draco? Typical of you, pulling out the emo card. Getting all wet when it suits you. But no." He rocked back on his heels, clearly skeptical. "I can't say as I'm interested. Not anymore. Go tell your tale of woe to someone who cares. Go sob on your pal Zabini's shoulder—I'm sure
"Sorry—really, I
“Stop talking!”
Not that Draco hadn't come to truly appreciate Lovegood (
. For I am well and truly fucked. Here goes nothing."
So did Potter, who had his mouth on Draco's neck, vampirical. Draco's starched high collar had been unbuttoned and his tie loosened, his school robes shoved aside so that they were sliding off one shoulder most awkwardly and Potter, the engineer of Draco's current highly unkempt appearance, was nibbling at him.
It had been his eyes that had gotten to Harry in the first place. They'd followed him. Everywhere, always, all the time. And the persistent lusty dreams he'd been having, interspersed within the more familiar nightmares. Sex in midair—fucking Merlin! And then the voice. He'd spent years hating the very sound of that voice, all smarmy and better-than-thou and nasty. To hear it without overtones of anger and underpinnings of blind hatred was a bleeding revelation.
Harry nodded frantically, blushing scarlet in the dark. He could literally feel Draco staring holes into him, grey eyes like searchlights illuminating his likely gormless expression, his betraying colour, his utter lack of self-protection. He shut his eyes tight for a moment, staving off the cool composed invasion of that gaze, only to blink them open to a visual feast: the swathe of pale hair, pale skin, pale everything that was imminently poised for flight.
," he began again, the casual endearment deliberate, but got precisely nowhere. "Dad,
"Sheesh! Shut it!"
“Is it,” Draco asked carefully, cautiously reaching out to cup Harry’s shoulders with long pale hands, “something I might want to hear?”

"Draco? Draco, do you even hear me? Draco!"
Harry stuck his hands in his hair, ruffling it up into a charming disarray. He’d left his specs off and his eyes were huge and still a little haunted.
idiot Harry, for placing himself solidly in these sticky wickets and driving Draco completely spare in the process!
"But of course, dear. That, too, is only fitting, to present your objet d'amour with a Malfoy ring and especially our departed Maman Cecilie's. You should begin as you mean to go on, yes? A most lovely gesture, that, and I'm sure your Harry will appreciate as such. He strikes me as the sort who would adore the history of your Grandme're's ring. She was a most fascinating person, your grandmother. We all adored her, darling—and especially you and that old arse Abraxas. But, Draco?"
"You're being a complete wet blanket. Pitiful," Hermione reproached him, shaking her head sufficiently send all her curls bouncing. She'd straightened her bushy hair into a wavy fall that was particularly attractive, but the Lake air only caused it to go frizzy again, Harry noticed. "You're stuck in a rut and you need to be out doing something positive about it. And I'm not going to help you if all you can manage is whinging!"
“I do," Harry said firmly. "That
"D'you—will you—please?" he gibbered, wrapping all his limbs about Harry in an effort to keep to the subject at hand. "With—always—me?"
Besides…now he had a viable goal of his own for next Slytherin practice. He’d duplicate that final move of Potter’s. The one with all the curlicue bits and the spirals, like a Wronski but not. Bloody well perfect it, because no way was
Stay, Harry repeated, and maybe-could be it was not a soundless whisper or the waft of passing lips over flesh this time.
“Serious?” Draco echoed incredulously. “You be serious, Potter!”

“I-Ssss-Ssss-I-Nnnn-Geee!”

"I don't think you've anything to be worried about, Draco," Harry murmured ever so discreetly into his companion's shell-like ear. No one noticed, as they began to gather about the unfortunate Longbottom and his faithful teddy.
will purchase the other; it's only proper."
, then?" He shrugged sharply; it became a body-length shiver. "You just admitted right out all you wanted from me was a fuck, yeah? And not just one, either. A whole series of lays and a frigging whore on your arm. Decorate your bloody life with Pureblood, was it? Show off to your friends how you can own one, just like, with a snap of those fingers. But, it's just…it's just pretty pictures, Harry. Just the packaging, the outside, that's all you wanted—that's all you saw, too! And you say
Draco gasped, poised to duck. Poised to swing sideways and lunge, to grapple his true love to the carpet if he must, anything to put a halt to the monumental hexing firefight that might erupt between them at any moment.
"Yeah, well. More like two, I should think," Harry nodded, and Draco, being assiduously polite, silently inclined his head as well. "We'll catch you up at luncheon, Hermione. Get us a table and er, have a good time in the meanwhile."
. Draco shook his head at Lucius' flushed cheeks and fearsomely heavy scowl. He wasn't fool enough to escort his beloved anywhere near his childhood home
"Doing it up a bit too brown, Draco," Harry glared. "I get the point."
"Right here, git!" he announced, and promptly took over Draco's lap. "Arsehole! Bloody yes, you snot-nosed git-faced-cowardly yellow-bellied git-of-all-gits!"
Draco, coming to himself with a snap and start, recalled exactly why he was in the midst of making an utter arse of himself, here on the cold flagstones of the enemy Common Room. Potter was ever so his! His, his, his! Undeniably and no one must forget that! The ring, then. Right! He needed it. Needed to ensure it was attached to its proper place in the universe: Harry's finger.
"Which she never did, because Pans doesn't, so then I had to use it—wear it around, like some ponced up prat, just to—"
, Harry, you can't just lay about and endlessly complain. I won't stand for it—I'm rather surprised
Harry smirked some more at Draco, rather nastily in the dim light. It made him look feral, what with those eyes of his. He set his teeth in a baleful flash and tapped a toe on the filthy pavers, toe tip running the spent fag-end into a filthy smear.

"Um—um, really, mate?" Weaselbee had found his tongue at long last but was redder than any conceivable shade of red in the normal spectrum. He'd steam issuing from his ears, practically, and he was swallowing hard, and so often his Adam's apple bobbed like one of those floats on a fishing pole. "Must—
“Nrgh.”  Draco sagged into the nearby wall. “Merlin!”
Harry breathed out, a long exhale. And Harry stood and waited with him, thankfully. Didn't startle or struggle or fight him; just let Draco be…and breathe as well. They only just stood, like statures of themselves, doing naught. Excepting their chests, faintly heaving, and the quiver to be seen in two sets of finger, grasping, gripping, holding fast. Neither shifted nor showed a single sign of wanting to do so. Where they were was a place, not merely a day in a year in a life. Sacred, perhaps, because of it. For Draco at least.
“Draco!” Theo shouted. He whacked the back of Draco’s knee, hard enough to smart.
"Well, we could just ask Pince. In fact, why don't we? Save heaps of time, asking. She still about, Draco?"
Blast Potter for having interfering mates. Draco hated being

All except for that one 'right' person...who was so clearly all 'wrong' for Harry. Or at least completely, miserably
“At last!” Theo agreed.
"Oh-My-Fucking-MERLIN!"
Flustered beyond reasoning, Draco shouted out the first thing that came into his head, going all hot and then cold, totally feverish; one thought and one only had entered his mind and he clung to it, like a Nargle to its favourite mistletoe sprig:
"Here, come on. Sit. Talk to me. How are you really?"
"Say 'Draco'."
want you to be happy, mate. Each to his own and all that.”
“Dunno. Go off on holiday, maybe. We’ve a house on the Riviera—nah, that’s far too hot and humid, in August. Spain—Spain is nice enough. Breezy by the sea, at least.”
“What? Make what worse?” Harry demanded curiously, bustling 'round his desk and skirting the Runes detritus to grasp at Draco’s leading hand and give a good hearty shake, then pulling him firmly into the room proper. “You--you're so. So
He peered about, setting his two bottles down on a side table so as to free up his hands. Slowly he spun on a neat heel, searching for signs of life. Or, at very least, recent occupancy. But, no. The familiar withdrawing room was welcoming, as always, but depressingly empty of his quarry. A silver salver with an uncorked bottle of wine--a much nicer vintage than what he’d brought with--and two gleaming glasses stood at the ready on the credenza. A tiered tray of Kreacher’s infamous nibbles-and-bits was placed next to it. The hearth logs flared back up into a cozy, crackling fire behind him.  Yet his erstwhile host was absent.
"No."
“Arrghh! Merlin!” Harry moaned, horrified. He felt ill, really, and clutched his middle to show it. “
"Pfft!" he huffed contentiously, arriving at Harry's side with a flap of fine lawn shirting. "You'd think they never heard of live porn, Foureyes!" He tilted his chin mockingly at them as Harry grasped his bare hips and yanked at them gently, guiding him into position so his stomach lay pressed close over the spine of the couch. Draco's gaze narrowed upon the lost look in the Weasel's common blue eyes as he descended gracefully onto the cushioned tufts of upholstery. "Hmph!" he jibed. "Are you certain you've reached majority, Weaselbee? D'you grasp what we're doing here? Because you'll draw flies with a mouth like that—"
His Mum smiled at him, clapping her hands to summon Twimbly. He popped in, was given his instructions swiftly and reappeared bearing gifts before Draco had even fully digested the idea that one day his shitefully poor excuse for a pater might actually approve of him.
Lovely. No—fucking gorgeous. Like everything else about the maddening git.

"Draco!" Potter said, quite insistently.

nesting, with three downy chicks under her great striped wings, and he could understand exactly why Harry didn't want to call her away from the duties of motherhood. Harry was an utter slob for little fuzzy helpless beasties, the prat. "You could've used Ethelred. He's only sitting 'round on his great duff, the useless git."
"Eihwaz
, damn it! He'd a life to save. His own. "And I'm not moving one fucking inch, Harry. Right damned here, Harry, in your face, in your Merlin fucking home until you agree to actually talk to me—till you agree to come the fuck back with me to the flat—our flat! This isn't
"Nurgh?"
"Oh…oh? Draco—alright?" Harry poked his boyfriend, worried.
He muttered darkly, his lips turned down at the corners. Malfoy might smell like heaven but sometimes Harry felt like hell, sod it. Bloody Gryffindor possessiveness—damn his House for being territorial!
Harry cast them a derisive glance, Draco's pitiful fingers. So he curled them up, making tight fists as he folded his arms across his chest, not budging a step towards door or hearth or any exit, stalling where he stood. For, if he could do nothing else, he could wait this out, give Harry time to regain his temper. No—bloody well find a grip on reality. Their reality. Because this was nonsense; tosh, every bit of it: the fight, the way Harry wanted him gone, even Harry's mates, visiting him to chivvy him along merely from some misguided sense of grudging do-goodery. Fools. Bollocks. It had never been necessary, none of it. Love didn't disappear in the blinking of any eye. Certainly
“You arse!”
want a baby,” Luna announced cheerily. “With Rolf, I think. He’s quite acceptable. Oh, and I need to find another place to live, I also think. Dad’s got this inopportune habit of surprising us. Perfectly alright, really, but Rolf’s a bit spooked.” She tapped a reflective fingertip to her chin. “Hmm, perhaps two. Babies.”
Ron, Harry reflected later, was amazingly pragmatic these days, now that Voldemort was truly offed. It was a small blessing Harry had come to count on. But Hermione was exactly the same as she always was.
told me what exactly happened, back there. Or what the Healer said. Talk, then. I’m your partner, remember? I rather need to know, don’t I?”
, Son?"
is the fun? I see nothing funny,
“Git! That’s all I need, damn it! He’d looking, Hermione!”
"Of course I mean it!" Draco was quite indignant now that the first hurdle was cleared. He'd deal with his own Head and Dumbledore privately; no need to worry Potter with details.
"That's funny." Draco blinked at the floor, strewn with the litter of bachelor living. "What you said, just now."
"Shut up! Fuck me already, Malfoy!" he commanded, flinching even as Malfoy held him helpless and spread and jammed two fingers into his quivering arsehole. "Fuck me now and fuck me hard, but fuck me!" Harry babbled on, for who knew when this dream night end? He wanted the very utmost out of it in any event, whatever was happening. He'd not thought it could happen, and it might not be, actually, but who cared? It felt real enough. "Fuck me!"
, when his poor body went into instant shock at the sheer aroma of Malfoy and then, too, at the sight of that sleek hair—and those steely amused eyes—and of course that tall, elegant frame silhouetted against the various scenic vistas of Hogwarts? It was passing strange, Harry had concluded, that when he'd finally and truly fallen for someone seriously, he'd fallen for that git. Smashingly hard, natch. Par for the course; it absolutely had to be Malfoy—Malfoy!
a working wand besides—thanking you kindly. Can cast quaerat just as well as you can—
Parkinson and Nott, not so much.
Draco, caught with his mouth partly open and halfway into the yawn he couldn't quite control, unfortunately gulped in surprise, nonplussed, and ended up falling into a little coughing fit.
, Harry! Good boy!"
"Oh! Yes, Potter—sorry," he grinned. He tightened his loose hold on Potter's hips and buttocks—and such firm ones they were, and ones he'd plans for—
"Yes…and?"
It was a nasty pattern Draco couldn’t help but notice, especially now they shared a flat. Harry was a bloody workaholic, worse even than Draco--or even Hermione, which was saying rather a lot. Of course, he had an immensely demanding position and he never seemed to actually leave it behind him, even if he’d departed his actual office. He ended up every night upon the sofa, too often sunk in the abysses of work he brought along home with him to pay much attention to Real Life happening around him, no matter how good his stated intentions were. Thus Draco was of the decided opinion it was a decent thing he could and should do for his good friend, to remind him firmly of those little necessities. Proper meals, and social commitments, and the like. Breathing, perhaps.
“…Urgh!” Ron popped his head over the massive metal toast rack, chewing furiously and peering at Harry as he’d developed two heads, without prior warning to the dailies. “Lake water, eh, mate? That’s—that’s bloody poetical, Harry.  Daft, but poetical.”
Draco looked to Potter's expression to see if it was alright, but Harry's eyes were shut so tight his dark brows were wrinkled, the lashes damp, and he was wincing and biting his lower lip nearly through.
But underneath the bubble of rage was the cold swell of a long-fought resentment. Draco didn't even know quite how to define it, that sick, low sensation; he just knew it was there, lingering, and that it got in the way sometimes.
"Um," Draco replied, all eloquence fled. He attempted a tiny nod, instead.
“Mmm.”
"Hmm. Like that, is it? Well…"
"There's some Witches from Beauxbatons I know," Bones offered up. "They might come over, if I write to them."
"Ew!" Draco did his best lemon-eating impression. "Nothing of the sort, Weasley—calm the feck down, would you? Always jumping to conclusions, and half of them arse-backwards."
"You mean, for this weekend?" Potter, it seemed, was also strangely breathless, or at least he sounded so to Draco. "Tomorrow, right? Gods! Is it a Hogsmeade weekend already? I've lost track, really—been so preoccupied lately."
"Like that, do you? Want some more?" Harry nodded and Draco began working up his throat, nipping it and matching each little bite with the thrust of finger, till Harry was moving restlessly about underneath him, his breath coming short and sharp in the quiet of the room.
"Dra—oh!"
"Harry," Draco murmured gently. "I love you. You talk too much, but still…I do love you. Now, do it and get it over with, 'cause I'm about knackered and my knees are shot to Hades.
"Come now, Draco, darling!" Narcissa squared her shoulders, apparenly taking it upon herself to jolly her son out his fit of nervous sulks. "Did you not ever consider that I might wonder? It's been years now, my sweet, you've been talking up your precious Potter. Years."
Luna blinked at him, long and slow, like a friendly cat. Smiled fleetingly, raising her glass in mute acknowledgment.
Harry cycled through that syllable a few too many times for anyone’s liking all the while doing a very weird thing with his body, by shoving hastily at Draco’s chest whilst tangling his bare legs completely about Draco’s pajama-clad ones. For a split-second Draco could only mightily boggle.
She sipped her coffee carefully, blowing upon the wisps of steam rising up from the blackest, hottest, most evilly caffeinated brew the Brekkers Stall Witch had available.
The Eights dutifully nodded. Ernie snored loudly, which counted as their agreement.
"…Awesome." Draco nipped his boyfriend's swollen lips. "Love you, Harry."
"No. No, okay. Right."
“Of course I do!” Harry informed his fingers fiercely as he jammed them together. They made a lumpy mess on his lap, all jumbled like that, but he didn’t care. “I mean to say, ah. You’re my partner, Malfoy. Right?”
"And what might they be, pray tell?" Potter's lips lifted only far enough to drift over to Draco's one ear. There they hovered, tongue tip teasing the lobe. "Your wishes? I'm curious." Harry sounded far more teasing than actually curious, truth be told.
"Shite!" Harry murmured, scowling. "There's never a good time to talk over—"
"The fifth of June, Mister Malfoy," Madam Pinkstone smiled, "first thing, in the morning post. Yes, I've got that. And you'll be requiring the other special orders all at once, and those delivered all to be delivered to Hogwarts as well, yes, but on the morning of the fifth?"
Dark. 'Specially for a love brew."
“B-But, Pans!” Draco stuttered, clutching uselessly the yarn Pansy had summarily thrust at him when he’d tumbled through the parlour floo at Parkinson Hall.
“Hermione! Make him stop!”
"No!" It wasn't. Harry was familiar with lust. With want and fancies and sexually-based attraction. Certainly all of these were present, right here in this room they shared the cost of renting every other night, like bloody clockwork. "No—that's not it."
Which had changed greatly in a matter of days, at least for Draco.
“Um, wishing…”
, Harry. Just fucking look."
—she'd never have him—not like Draco did.
A tiny snitch fluttered fretfully within when he at last revealed the contents to darting eyes, cracking the finely wrought hinge the barest bit to peek.
“Hmmm,” his mother hummed soothingly, maddeningly nonchalant and waving off his question with a careless flutter of fingertips. “Maybe, maybe not; who is to know with Harry, yes? He's made for a perfectly adequate godfather all these years.”
Harry grinned at him. They’d a good fifteen minutes before Snape might show his hooked nose in the Lab,
," his mum snapped, teeth flashing. "Give over. Do."
But it didn't. Perplexingly enough, it didn't.
Draco shook his head in the negative and occupied himself discreetly glancing about, feeling more than a little impressed. Potter's new space in the Ministry was capacious and decidedly elegant, a far cry from the claustrophobic cubicle his friend had been assigned when he'd begun his employment.
"Yes. Alright."
“No.”
Draco shuffled forward and bloody well sat his bottom—more like he collapsed—on a convenient wingback. A brand new armchair, which most definitely hadn't been in Harry's scruffy old sitting room the last time he'd been. So much had changed and so very quickly in his life—in Harry's—and apparently that included the landscape of the décor.
"Profs!" shrieked Neville. He scuttled behind a grinning Thomas and a snorting Finnegan for cover. "No Profs!"
unexpected flights of child-sized hobby-horses down the stairwells and painfully abrupt showers of monogrammed silver rattles and tiny booties during breakfast.
"I-I'm very sorry, Harry," Draco mumbled, coming up from his knees in a rush, his face paler than the finest all-linen pressed parchment, "for assuming you—you'd want—this." He scowled, looking anywhere but the face that was his joy. "Me. I'm sorry. I apologise. My mistake," he bowed just the barest amount, head and neck only: a mockery of his usual inbred arrogance; a gesture that was as strangely formal as Draco now felt. The camaraderie they'd shared, the closeness—it was ended. "Please excuse me. I really—I
"That's right!" Malfoy growled, white teeth a banner valiant. "Take me, Harry. Take all of me, Harry—beg for it! Say my name, Harry!" His gaze was cruel and sharp and wild; Harry melted.
And, gods, but Harry's body was so hot, so searing hot, even through their clothes, and it was like dancing naked on the lip of volcano, how they used to feel for each other, almost palpable but hovering just out of reach. How it was just there—within a hand's grasp, if only he could manage some lift, a little boost—a ounce of mercy. Just…a dream of mercy on Harry's part and they'd be fine again, Draco knew. And how hard they were still, hips mated, what with Draco's cock gouging a little dent in Harry's midriff and the both of them panting away in each other's faces as if oxygen were in short supply and the world burning down round their ears, unnoted.

"Yes!" Draco howled. "He
“Oi, Malfoy! Draco
"Well…"
“Baaaaabeeeee carriage!”
“I don’t think it’s merely that, Draco.” Pansy stopped her eternal knotting, and stared off into the middle distance, frowning. “I don't believe so at all. Neither do any of us, any of your friends, love. We're none of us blind nor lackwit, you know; it's crystal he's arse over tits for you. And I do know that he’s made a choice already and now you have to decide for yourself.”
"Oh-my-Merlin-there—right there….yesss," he moaned, flopping about on the ridge of the sofa back. The tufted buttons dug into his abdomen; Harry's prick reamed him harder than hard. Draco loved it; adored it—could never
Um…why did that leave Draco feeling so…very…uneasy?
Unbound.
your life."
"…Draco?" he added, hesitantly, when his companion did nothing more than sigh and stare fixedly at Harry's offering.
“Oh. Right, okay,” Harry huffed a weary sigh, deflating. “My fault. Sorry, sorry. I didn’t open any more Owls or check the Floo after four p.m.; we’d back-to-back meetings via the International floo till eight o’clock and then I had a mountain of--ah! Right, sorry, enough of my nonsense. I really can’t tell you the details of it all anyway. It was just--just bloody work, as always. And it’s just my bad--again!--and I am honestly sorry for snapping, Malfoy. Alright?”
With gusto.
“What?” he demanded. “ I don’t see the problem here, guys. Go on, eat your breakfast. We’ll be late, otherwise.”
"My sister, Cordelia, just happens to have this perfectly darling little shoppe over in Characteristic Alley? 'Thee Olde Sweetest of Scentes of Truest Love Shoppe', she's named it. Isn't that just the most adorable thing ever? So...ah, just
“Well, you could have said something!” Harry scowled darkly, closing his book on his forefinger with a peeved little thump. He twisted about to face Draco full-on, ripping his specs off his face and rubbing a hand over a set of clearly tired eyes. “Gah. I’ve been holding off supper for ages!”
!" Draco snarled darkly, glaring for all he was worth. "This means the papers and confronting my parents and your bloody interfering mates and everyone we know—did you even think, Potter? About what you were doing, putting me on the spot? I could kill you now, you know, and the court would acquit me. Crime of passion, they'd call it, and I'd go scot-free!"
"Mmmm-aahhhh! Watch it, Harry!" Draco gasped when Harry was bit too enthusiastic—but he did nothing to prevent it, either, the ravaging of his bared chest by teasing tongue and flexing lips. "Missed—you—too—you-great-prat! Mind the teeth, now! That smarts, you little prick!"
Pity? Gods, no. Silence, dead silence, all emanating almost palpably from the man Draco loved and all he got for the gift of his admission was a set of very green eyes trained on him, forensically. Never blinking, never shifting, as if he were an insect tracked in on the carpet. Draco shuddered, flinching and blinking fast against the encroaching blankness that was life without Harry.
"I'm not a wimp, Harry, not like you. I take life's opportunities as they come and make use of them."
"Well…" Hermione grinned at her book slyly, "no argument there, at least. Carry on, then; it's your funeral."
"Ah! Ah-
"Oi! Oi, Hermione!" he called out. "What in the blazes does
"H-Harry! Harry, wait!"
Draco shivered abruptly, and wrapped his scarf more carefully ‘round his throat. It was chilly. Well,
A flash of light, brilliant as Malfoy's hair and as blindingly pure as the molten grip of his wide-open gaze.
“Verrrry attractive, though,” Harry remarked, returned to thinking aloud. “Fancy.”
"No?" Harry licked the porcelain ear he'd just breathed into with reined-in passion. "You seemed a bit, oh—I don't know—jealous, perhaps?"
"Not at all. It's entirely beneficial. Vincit omnia veritas, Draco—'the truth conquers all'. In fact, I cannot think of a more…fitting…way of officially beginning your relationship with your Harry than by offering him this particular ring, Draco. You'll see."
"Little prick. Love you, too, Potter."
Courtship for a Pureblood was a serious matter, after all; Draco was as aware of that as he was of his own very lengthy pedigree. Even when it was for love—
"Where you
The aromatic whiff of Malfoy striding past him caused Harry to stumble blind into perfectly stable objects, objects such as corridor walls and work benches and plush, forgiving sofas; it created a maelstrom in his chest and throat that rendered him both gurgling with hot-tongued lust and stammering with barely swallowed-back desire. It was a dangerous thrill assailing him in a precarious perch: the scent of Draco's robes, his verbena hair, even his bloody leather bookbag—a crisp scintillating odour that lent a keen edge to every word that Malfoy spoke to him in passing or—and this was contrarily odd but to be expected, as it was
"Harry."
"Oh gods, Harry," Draco blushed scarlet, then paled. "Look, do me a favour? Never mention it. Never again. Not a word. Please?"
"Better to be cruel to be kind in the end than allow him drag on like this, Potter," Draco whispered. "Always hoping. That hurts." His lips were light against the ridge of Harry's scar. "Look to your littlest Weasleyette; don't you dare tell me with a straight face that she didn't suffer whilst you were off fucking about. Not to mention what I went through—"
"Oh, we're doing it," Draco affirmed grimly. He and Harry exchanged worried glances and then turned their eyes steadfastly ahead, focussed upon the grand double door that stood at the very end of the very much longer-than-it-ever was- before corridor. "Never fear."
"What's what?" Harry sighed, peering down at the tiny font on the pages his partner had flipped the book open to. "Hell, Draco, I can't even make it out. Gibberish."
"Well," Draco returned, snippily, "You've certainly wasted enough time already, just getting here, haven't you?
"What did I expect?" Harry sighed, grabbing up floo powder. "You're helpless without me."
“Thank you, thank you kindly, ladies and gents!” Ron, meanwhile, toasted his unappreciative audience with another sausage.
you see what I’m seeing here, Ron? Because you’re struck blind if you can’t. No head for detail.”
(Thinking desperately of that one singular look in Draco’s eyes that one particular morning, and of the star’s light rippling above, and of the glitter of the sea off Clovelly on bright days, and Harry casts steadfast and sure.)
This morning would be a good one, then. Hermione might scold him for being belated but Harry wouldn’t care a fig for it. He’d sail through his day on a tail wind and nothing would touch him—impervious. Complete.
aware Hagrid's actually planning to administer us a written test tomorrow? He let it slip at luncheon! He practically never does that!"
fault, is it?"
brill, wasn't it? Told you it would be."
He nodded over at the hair in question, well established and actively being shiny atop the git’s pointy head. This should be screamingly plain to see, the striking similarity between the waters of the Giant Squid’s abode and Malfoy’s dratted follicles.
“Super! That’s—that’s—really—just! Wow, you know? Damn, but I wish we were playing this week,” Draco mourned, as Potter banked deftly and peeled off. “I should so be out there right now. These Ravens haven’t got a tinker’s prayer against him.”
"Draco Malfoy, you're an unmitigated arse," Hermione informed him from where she sat plumped and prissy-faced on the centre of the double-wide ottoman, twirling her wand like a bloody baton and she an anti-cheerleader. Ron nodded, crammed in next to her, one leg tucked up, one half-falling to the carpet but still tall and broad and ginger, oddly sphinx-like. He'd his arms crossed and Draco eyed his muscular forearms warily.
Well, sod them! Draco decided, and barreled off into an excited recap. He had to share his glee somehow and they were right there to take t eh brunt of it, the gaspers.
"I—but—you—" Harry got out before that tongue claimed his again, and gods-Merlin-fuck but Malfoy was anal about these things. He wanted what he wanted, it seemed, and he wasn't stopping till he got it. No choice but to give in then, as every other part of Harry begged his last lingering bits of good sense and healthy sense of self-preservation to do. He didn't understand; no, he didn't. But…but maybe he didn't need to?
"Fine," Harry shrugged it off stoically. "You do that, love. We'll schedule the formal execution first thing after our honeymoon. I've booked a Portkey to Romania so we can visit the dragons at Charlie's Reserve—you love them, right? Dragons? And Charlie says the local hotel's very posh there—the accommodations include a suite and a complimentary breakfast."
. Because
"Wanker!" he'd scolded and proceeded to adore his tie-tack. Wore it always, and not so much for the Potter crest as for the fact that Draco had given it him. "Sod you."
Such a very mundane thing, a day spent wandering the local town, sampling its wares and offerings. (Salazar, the Third Years were the ones who got worked up over a Hogsmeade weekend,
“Excepting you
"You," Harry sniped, face fox-narrow with matching fury, chin tipped in heady challenge as he stared straight into Draco's eyes, "won't have a choice in the matter. Don't, in fact. I've already left you, haven't you noticed? Been gone, weeks now I've been gone. I've. Left. You. Draco. Got it? It's a simple enough concept if you'd just
Malfoy cocked his chin, the one Harry longed to gnaw on, and sent Harry a long slow inscrutable look from under his smoke-tipped pale lashes.
"Ready or not, here I come," Malfoy snickered, but it wasn't evil—more gloating, but in a good way. Harry couldn't give a fig. "Harry Potter. Hope you're ready for me, now I've finally got you where I want you," he chuckled and Harry glared at him nastily—if only for taking up all their precious time to talk about it.
"Well?" Granger prompted, cocking an eyebrow. "You were saying, Malfoy?"
"No—no!" If nothing else, ever, than Draco had to let Harry know he didn't doubt. That he wouldn't think to—that he couldn't bear to, not now, nor in the future. His life was built atop this rock-solid foundation; there was nothing and no one else in the world for him. He couldn't conceive of having another person see him like this—open and spread and vulnerable, waiting, wanting—he didn't wish to.
"Harry! That's
! I have it!"
Drinking down his second cup, he contemplated popping down to the Manor, but changed his mind mid-consideration. While his family home might have a new target--the quite randy and excessively determined-to-get-themselves-knocked-up young Scamander couple, who were all too likely shagging themselves blind in the Drawing Room even as he mulled over the idea of nipping by--it was yet pursuing a quite subtle but secondary campaign to convince its Master that offspring of his very own blood-and-biology were an absolute necessity. Subtle, as in not quite so horrendously blunt-edge as before but still ghastly insidious and unrelenting. Of course he knew his own home and of course his own home was every bit as Slytherin as any one of its current and previous owners, really. But Draco was just a tiny bit concerned that maybe he was being somewhat swayed. Just a wee bit. A smidge.
So very, very good; all he'd ever wanted.
Harry's heart was likely to stop. Certainly it banged against his ribs like the very dickens. Next year! Next year—and the year after that—and on and on, till forever.
“Right. Fuck,” Harry growled, yanking the first of the scrolls toward him and abruptly deciding against all of it. "
“He always makes me wish--just a little, mind--me and Gin had worked out, after Hogwarts. Or even Ollie; he’s always been such a nice chap. A few kids would’ve been brilliant, maybe. Maybe not, though.” He humped a shoulder, huffing out an impatient breath, nostrils, and slung a fast palm through his hair, ruffling it. “There was uni, and then my career here--" he gestured about his office--"and of course I knew I'd be immediately posted, erm, abroad. For quite a long time." He waved a hand, looking uncomfortable. "So, I suppose I can say it, you know? Wanting kids? But it wasn't ever even a serious thought for me. Children aren’t exactly an option, right? Not with my job.”
"Oh-gods-Draco!" Harry whimpered, and let himself be gone, be carried far and away and conversely clamped fast and immobile and filled with a boundless heat and great gouts of salty fluid. He was taken, and glad of it. The relief was immense.
Or rather, what he'd already given, freely and of his own will.
“Oh—er, Malfoy…um, what?” Potter did pause in his determined trot out of DADA, though, and that was the important thing. Better yet, his execrable choice of companions had preceded them, swept away by the rush to luncheon, and it was too late for Potter to call them back to his side. “Yes?”
It went on seemingly endlessly, and Harry’s blood thrummed through his veins with a sustained burst of adrenaline, his heart feeling massive and topsy-turvy-tilting in his chest. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed Ichika-san flagging, her cheeks--pinked by the winds--paling, her broom drifting down uncertainly.
Courage was dry, dull, dreadful stuff, like stale biscuits. Draco choked it down, even mindful. Concentrated on the art of looking as earnest as he felt. Perhaps if he tried it on long enough, it would take.
Draco Malfoy was threatened! He was actively being menaced by a twit with demonstrably more Spell-dyed blonde hair than brain matter—and boobs like bloody cocoanuts!
If Draco peered and squinted, turning his chin at an angle, just so, he could make out his mother's hand gripping his father's shoulder quite tightly; restraining him, apparently, from striding straight through the Floo and throttling his only spawn-and-rightful heir astride the elegant flames of pretty Slytherin green. If beloved Mumsy hadn't cast a partial damper on this paternal shite-storm already, then Merlin knew, it was looking to be a rough few moments coming. Nasty, even.
. As if Draco were a slowtop and didn't get it the first time. As if Harry was the arsehole he was acting like. "Take yourself there and go."
“Shut it, arsehole,” Harry snapped, immediately fraught. It wasn’t like that! Ron was a git of the first order! He was so humiliated he could curl up and blow away! “Shut it right now!
“Mmhhph?!”
Their cast continued all through, unabated, the showers of magic thickening in the air and settling like invisible rain into the undisturbed dusts and sediments below. Already the Lines looked fresher, more potent, as if the magical rain had infused them with new life and clarity. Harry began to pant near the end of of it; he’d not been joking when he’d said it was hard work, the Hygieian, and he knew they’d all be exhausted by the time they went straggling back to the quarters they’d been given at Castelobruxo.
"Fucking make me—mmph-ngh!"
“Um, no, actually—“
Pansy and Nott exchanged a quick, meaningful glance, all the while edging their respective bums away an infinitesimal distance on the reserved bench they all shared.
. Something about Amortentia, and how Draco hadn't actually brewed it. Something about perfume, or cologne, actually, and how it was really only
“Well…” Harry tapped a fingertip to stubbly chin in serious thought. “Hmmm, now that you ask….”
: H/D
"Bring!" roared the elder Malfoy, his pale face so red Draco rather thought he'd implode on the spot. "The!"
"Hnnhh…umm, well..."
"Oh. Um." Harry grinned at him, and life was good. "Sooo. Like we'll pretend I never saw any of that, then?" All balance was instantly restored and Grimmauld Place would make a nice house to let for a little extra income because it was crystal clear Harry and Draco wouldn't be living here. "I see how it is. Scaredey-pants, Malfoy. Coward; afraid of a few feelings. Fine, then."
"—ections, honest and true. A symbol of our coming Bonding. As I'll always, always—"
“Oh, Malfoy,” Ron crooned passionately, his honest, open, wouldn’t-hurt-a-fly expression taking on a decidedly faux-lustful glaze. “Oooooh, my Slytherin Sex Machine! My Ice Prince! Do let me pet your beee-you-tif-all hair, Draaaco darling! I want to touch it; wanna’ run my fingers through it, you great sexy git! Ooooh! So silky!”
"Harry, don't say for me to go." Draco took contrary heart at the lack of movement. He wouldn't think of what else it might mean, no. He ventured forward, by tiny degrees. "Don't say you hate me, okay?"
That was--Draco blinked reflectively over the thought--if Harry could be convinced to ease up now that he was the actual Head of Department of Mysteries. Firming his chin, Draco resolved that this would indeed be the case. His mate had had nearly two years solely devoted to his career, gallivanting off with next to no notice and disappearing without a trace, and it had definitely paid off for him, position-wise, but now it was past time for him to relax, perhaps even lounge about on his laurels.
“What? Wh-What??!! The fuck, Draco!” Harry shouted, leaping to his feet as if he’d been Jinxed. “Where do you even get off, saying that? You--you fucking poser! It’s not like you’ve got anything to show for yourself either, you know? Don't you dare accuse me of what you can't even manage to do yourself, git-for-brains!”
“Well, I do!”
"Harry?" The pale brows were beginning to crinkle into a fretful pucker. "Harry, you
biggest turn-off
"Ack!" He caught himself up again, gasping. "No, sorry! It's more...well. It's just caught up with me, what you said. Just now. You're truly home to stay? Not going instantly off again? That’s fantastic, Harry. I thought you were having me on, I really did.”
can, speccy boy. We're completely alone here; trust me."
Harry regarded the ring on his finger nervously. What was this all about, then?
“No, of course I don't! Why would I ever? Yes, Mum, sounds grand. Go on, do.”
"No I don't." Draco sniffed haughtily, using the bannister to haul himself along so as to arrive all the faster. "I just know my own limitations. That's the point of this exercise, actually.
"Pardon?" Harry looked startled. "I didn't realize--"
things to you! I can retaliate, Malfoy! And I will!”
“I see it, Harry,” Luna replied, coming to stand at his shoulder. She raised her wand, clasping his larger hand in hers. “Ready?”
And even if the prime enemy’s most evident Quidditch strategy was apparently ‘to go ‘round in barmy circling spirals till everyone else on the field vomited from the transferred dizziness’. With grace and with a brilliance of form Potter moved on a broom, yes, but still in a very vomit-inducing manner.
tell. I'm left only with the sorry likes of you to talk to, more's the pity.”
Breathless and needy, the hot blood coursing through every swollen capillary, Harry surged up mindlessly to meet his chosen match—the single solitary Wizard who slotted into his every gap and crack perfectly, filling them to perfection, seamless and smoothed over. His reluctant love—his beloved nemesis.
“Hmmm,” Harry shifted closer, snuggling. Of all things, he liked that particular note in Malfoy’s voice the most—more even than his cock, more even than his snogs, no matter how devastating. It was funny, that Malfoy needed him. That he didn’t mind showing it, either. “Yeah? What’s it, Malfoy?”
That, Draco heard loud and clear. He scowled at them, at wit’s end.
“Alright, then. It'll come as no surprise to you, darling, that Hermione and I’ve been chatting, now and again. Wee Wizards play group, you know?” She shrugged nonchalantly. “In fact, Ronald and Blaise have also been chatting. Wee Wizards is thrice weekly, thank Salazar, and their Rosie also attends.”
“Oops, sorry, darling!” she shrugged. “My consultation time is ended. Blaise and the girls are flooing home as we speak. So sorry to rush you out, darling, and do give Harry my fondest regards, but I’m afraid--”
“I am,” Luna replied, both hands clasped about the base of her wand, her broom gently shifting to-and-fro beneath her bum to keep her balanced as she flew hand’s free. Harry and Ichika-san swiftly followed suit, each one of them pointing their wands at the tip of Luna’s. “Are you?”
“Strong words, skimpy Scarface!” Malfoy exclaimed, but he did shove his cock far enough up Harry’s bottom to finally poke his prostate.
.  That should cement his reputation as a highly regarded young astronomer amongst the Muggles and Draco did so love to work smart and not hard.
try, I promise."
"…Sorry," he murmured, glancing away, for he knew he was mucking up, more than a little. Time for the dénouement then, the killing blow. "I, uh—I brought you this." He popped open the tiny box and rare gems and diamonds blazed in the reflected firelight, dazzling both of them momentarily.
“Witch!”
“Bollocks," he said, slipping them on again and peering over at Draco. "Tell me, why is it so difficult to find time for basic things like eating? Maybe even sleeping?”
"Right, right," Draco shrugged, "fine. You track her down if you need to. I'm not so sure she'll even be useful."
Adrian Brie-Pucker was a dapper young Wizard, with dark hair and a smallish frame, like Potter's. Even his hair stuck up—also like Potter's—but his eyes were a pale, washed-out blue-grey. He did, however, boast of taller blond male Bond-partner, which for some reason left Draco feeling nauseatingly fond of them both by simple association, and Pucker was 'the' known supreme master of dessert-oriented confection.
“Wasn’t there long, though," he informed Draco's grudgingly enquiring eyebrows. "Just popped in and let Millie know I wasn't available this entire weekend. For a change, what?” He chuckled jovially, causing Draco to gently set his back teeth in an effort to maintain passivity. "So, long story short, here I am, mate"--the oblivious one gestured cheerily, grinning--"free as a bird, right? So. We should take advantage, yeah? Go somewhere, do something. Fun. Have some of that."
“Whew! Yokatta!”
love you—" This didn't seem to faze Harry as it did Draco, though. He blushed all the more, all of him.
are we here again, Draco? Exactly?”
"You don't care for me, you never have. Not really. Not that way it matters."
"Erm…what?"
Of course Potter caught him.
"Really," Draco admonished him blandly, observing with his arms crossed languidly before him, "I wouldn't bother myself. She's definitely gone."
"Yes, Ron," Harry cut in wearily. Draco only rolled his eyeballs. "It is and now we'll prove it to you. Right, so…ready, everyone? Let's go."
, Draco's voice was musing,
"What? What, Hermione? You deny it? You think I'm joking? It's Malfoy, remember? Highly unlikely, okay? Not happening. Chalk—cheese—hmm. I might be hungry."
"Get—off—me!" Draco growled testily, having been the one who'd taken the brunt of their abrupt expulsion from Sexual Space. "Killing—me—here! Ca-Can't
Malfoy. It had been a Proper Courtship, even if accomplished at light-speed.
“Same again, right back at you!”
“Hah! Fuck you both. And let’s go now, alright? It’s bloody cold out here. Cease your dawdling.”
"Isn't your sister on the market, Ron?" Finnegan asked curiously, "I heard she was looking for an older man."
,” Harry said sourly, thinning his lips. “Well,
Harry shivered. That
"Umm," Harry sighed as two fingers roughly twisted into him, as Draco didn't wait for a reply. They knocked up against his quivering prostate almost immediately and he jolted into an arch of sheer bliss. "Umm, yessss…that's—that's brilliant! That would be—precisely—brilliant, Draco!"
Sometimes Ron really was eerily intelligent. It was almost scary.
"One hundred
But…he'd have to wait till after dinner to dole out Potter's punishment, actually, because, as Head Boy, Draco had to appear at dinner in the Great Hall: prim, proper and stiff-upper, simply to mind the lesser Years and manage general decorum. Even if he was rendered spitting with furious ire at his beloved idiot Gryffindor for contributing to his current debacle—or nursing a head-splitting migraine, after.
"Ready?" Malfoy wasted no time, grinding his thighs against Harry's; his dick was like an iron bar trapped behind the thin woolen weave, a bludgeon designed to carry Harry away to some new sensual horizon he'd never even dreamt of.
Likewise, Harry was no longer considered the utter Gryffindor Innocent of Sixth and Seventh Years, having played about a good bit under the sheets (and in the Quidditch Hut, the Library and many of the abandoned classrooms) in early Eighth term (and not merely with the other Eight Years, natch!) He'd a bit of a developing rep as a player with hearts, but then who wouldn't want to be shagged by the Saviour, even if it was only a one-off? His reputation had really only been improved by the hint of 'Bad Boy', all 'round. This pumped up aura of his, of course, included the excited whispers of the Sixies and Sevensies as to the size of his tackle and the brilliant use put thereof. Malfoy, contrarily, though he maintained his unsullied reputation as a true Slytherin Shag Master, was far more chary of spreading his attentions than previously, and kept them confined to the members of his Common Room. If he'd a choice, too, he always picked upon Potter to be his partner in any match or challenge proposed. Thus, it was always Potter and Malfoy paired up whenever anyone proposed a game of anything. At all.
“Ack. Ahem!” Draco cleared his throat abruptly, scowling. Catching Snitches and conversing with Potters was not at all the same thing; there was no equitable equation implied. “Silly prat—it’s not that big a deal, really,” he told himself aloud. “Do the same for anyone. Knowledge is power; everyone knows!”
"Yes, what sort, Malfoy?" Granger wanted to know, and even Zabini tore himself away from her clavicle long enough to peer about the circle of faces, mildly curious.
“Alright. Yes.” He swallowed; his throat and mouth were deathly dry for some reason, so he hastily took another sip of wine, toasting Luna right back in as cheery fashion as he could manage. "Thanks, though."
"Bonding!" mumbled Lucius. He growled it, next: "Bonding! BONDING! BAH!"
"No," Harry had replied decisively, his whisper marginally louder than Draco's and overriding it. "It's better to have something fresh, Draco. Something that's ours."
Draco looked up defensively, meeting his friend's skeptical gaze.
“My brother,” Millicent announced darkly. “Is now officially a teenager, at just the thirteen. Or so he's informed me. That’s quite enough for me and Mum, Hars. He’s all about the Muggle devices and hanging about intersections along Diagon with his puerile little mates and generally making a nuisance of himself. My wits are at bitter end. As is my small store of patience.”
It left his groin feeling hot and heavy—swollen, as if ripe. It sent his life blood in a crazykart race through his over-worked veins. It rocked his Gryffindor sensibilities into a Hufflepuff reel, dizzy and breathless in its choppy wake, and then jerked him after it as deftly as a hapless puppet on a twisty string. All the fine dark hairs prickled wildly on his nape in gleeful static when he chanced to see
“Alright then,” he smiled, and went back to his scrambled eggs and fried tomatoes.
loss.
-Pott
Quidditch fan could inform them history had been made this afternoon—that last and decisive chase after the Snitch of Potter’s was one for the record books!
“Ah…I.”
“Oh.” Harry stilled, though he kept his hands where they were. “Right.” They were very close, which wasn’t in itself unusual. As Aurors they were accustomed to sharing tight spaces at times; it was nothing new. But it felt differently even so, to Harry’s mind. “Fair point.”
Draco meanwhile had shoved, nudged and yanked Harry about six ways from Sunday, even going so far as to climb atop him.
"Right," Harry nodded. "Uh—see you, Hermione. Ron," he repeated and finally the two of them moved on ahead, to Draco's great—and unspoken—relief.
"No. No."
It was a most excellent sofa, Charmed to match any décor and enlarge or shrink, firm or soften, all according to the circumstances and wishes of the people inhabiting it. Harry had fallen into its welcoming embrace the moment it was placed in the drawing room of their very nice flat and not made not a single solitary objection to any of the other furnishings Draco insisted were necessary for his comfort and well-being.
"Incorrigible!" Harry snorted, leaning across to give Draco a light biff on the top of his uncombed head. "Do stop. I'm fine, I tell you. I just want to go out, alright? See some sights, perhaps take a stroll 'round that flower market you've mentioned. Might you not fuss at me and instead just come along with? I really am starved. And thirsty." He cast a mournful sideways glance at the teapot. "You drank all the tea, Draco."
"Oooo, Harry!" he moaned, sagging back against the heaped up pillows. "Gods!"
sake, Malfoy, find him and talk to him, you pitiful prat. Make him see reason; go down on your knees if you must. Apologize, if nothing else! Tell him you didn't mean it, that you'll do anything if he'll just come back. Lie through your teeth, but do it!" She stomped a small foot at Draco, who jumped, twitching. "Or bloody well die trying. Because you'll wish you had, if Harry's not happy. Again—
"Of course you didn't, Harry," Draco snapped. "I never got round to all the gruesome details, did I? We were far too busy getting trollied and gawping at the brothel
But it never shifted, Harry's studied mask of indifference. Harry only stared up at him, lip curled, and maybe his eyebrows shaded to cynical and his nostrils flared the tiniest bit, but that was it. "Fuck you, Draco," he said flatly. "Get off me."
"What?" Draco was momentarily taken aback...until he saw the sparkle in Potter's eyes and his exceptionally sharp ears caught the faint murmur of a student body gathering up its mass to move towards dinner.
Draco huffed.
It was a decided pleasure, really, to be no longer in residence. And the homesickness he’d dreaded feeling had completely failed to materialize.
"What?"
"Er—what?" Harry piped up. "Why're you two talking about me? I'm right here, aren't I?"
"But—
) had forced them into more constant company.
"Uh-huh," Draco nodded. "We can use levitate corporum and then—
"Ah! Ah,
“Fancy,” Theo added, in a monotone. “That.”
"Come on, then. Sit!" Draco beckoned sharply, fingers miraculously still unclenched, and the horribly
"Harder?"
"Well..." Harry tapped his chin with a considering forefinger, "maybe. I mean, the mandragora he talked about in Lecture today was helpful—at least we've narrowed it down. Shredded, dried, only use Tibetan pure. That's here, right enough—and so's the bile of an albino grasshopper. On the right track with those, at least—oi!
"Nhh," Draco mumbled—steady neck-chewing tended to distract him righteously—"um, ah! Oh, right there—that's it. Ahhhh...I dunno—I, really, Harry—can't see it—they'll just..."
“Second,” Draco groaned, despairing, pressing his hand across his eyes and shutting them tightly, so as not to in any way be forced to look at the git he was talking to. Correction: attempting to address rationally. “Is, it’s bloody two o’clock in the morning. You woke me out of a sound sleep. Wailing and flailing, completely incoherent. Third, I was never truly angry with you and I’m fucking insulted you think I was--”
He'd admitted to himself, hadn't he—and now to Hermione and Ron. He'd…feelings…for Malfoy. Honest ones, that went well beyond just smelling the git—or jumping his bones at first opp. But...ohgods! But—!
, Malfoy!”
"Indeed, I suppose I must confide I am…ah…pleased with this turn out, son." His mother's lips quirked in wry amusement behind the gold-leafed rim she peeked over. Draco sat up in a hurry; his mother seldom waxed lyrical concerning his actions, no matter how much she truly adored him. "Your choice is rather more than merely acceptable, darling—even I cannot deny your Potter is a bit of catch, these days. A very fit young Wizard, Draco, and really quite, quite above reproach in the marriage stakes, upon consideration. A champion, as they say. Excellent potential for a future Malfoy."
“It’s a casserole, git,” Harry smiled widely, all glinting eyes and canines. “What?” He blinked slowly at Draco, as if he were as innocent as the July days were long. “Did you think I’d cooked something willingly? Oh, no. Kreacher just goes on with sending them over and I just go one with casting reheating spells them when you’re not paying attention."
"No, no, no, you've got it all wrong, Harry."
Draco tentatively popped his head through unfamiliar office Floo and glanced curiously about him.
"Fuck you, then. Arsehole." Harry's eyes went a poisonous hue. And when his hands settled on Draco's upper arms it wasn't to grip them with love and adoration, it wasn't to squeeze them fondly as he'd used to do, days and days ago—an eternity. He shoved harshly at Draco, who dug in his heels and didn't shift.
“Worse than the Mark, right," Harry prompted gently after they rounded two entirely unexpected bends in the apparently straight hall and then carefully navigated a sudden small fountain. It was a cherub, set about with assorted greenery.  "Yes, this is decidedly wonky, alright. Well, go on then. What happened next?”
Draco pursed his lips, tilting his head quizzically as he reached out a hand to tug the top folder over to his side of the blotter.
"Get off me, you lout!" Malfoy didn't; he did the opposite, actually. Harry panted at the weight pressing him inexorably down into the sand.
Draco snorted, instantly offended.
!" he huffed. "There! Just—just there!"
Had to be, or he'd end up as spare as Draco claimed he was. Or as stupid.
In all that lovely P&Q he’d even managed several hours concentrated effort on his latest submission to
“Whaaaat?
“It’s not that!” he heatedly informed his kneecaps. "It isn't."
last week," Harry continued on, unheeding. This particular offense of the world in relation his Malfoy-infested heart was a huge one; he was rightfully pained by it. Gossip about Malfoy and other people was simply horrid; should be outlawed, really. "Ginny said and she follows the Society pages, you know, and
he even bothered. Greasy old git was awfully lax, now that he was free of the Noseless Terror. And so was that stuck-up berk Draco Malfoy, for that matter.
"Get on the bed, then," he ordered, and quickly clambered on himself, snapping his fingers to fill them full of lubrecant. Potter might blather on about only having half-an-hour, but Draco would take his time with this.
"Well..." Harry sighed. "It has been some time. Quite a while, now I think about it."
“Now, now,” Harry said in a soothing manner, turning to give Draco a reassuring grin although he kept one wary eye upon the entry. “It’s still for babies; it can’t all that bad. Just let me have a little look inside now and we’ll see what can be done. You can’t let it chase you out of your own home,” he added sturdily, hand turning the large brass knob gingerly. “You’ll see; we’ll soon sort it out."
“Erm." Harry raised his eyebrows so far up they practically disappeared beneath his flopping-forward, entirely too perverse fringe, the silvery lightning-bolt wrinkling in clear confusion. "Yes? I did--I am?”
Something snapped inside Draco's brain. Maybe it was the last remnant of the hold Voldemort had tried to place upon his young heart, or perhaps it was the silent shattering of a million idiotic misconceptions; who knew?
bloody shouting to fucking well
"I—You—erm," Harry, feeling as though he ought to say something, no matter how gormless, attempted it, spluttering. He felt logy and quiescent; if Malfoy wanted it, Harry wouldn't be at all averse to being plundered as he lay, here on the lake shore, on the edge of the wild. "Please!"
He was forced back down upon the creaking mattress, lips parted pointlessly in nebulous question, eyes seeking any light at all that might shed some upon this complete and utter reversal of fortunes.
Come to think on it, though, Potter, as Draco well knew, had quite a decent neck on him for such a stubby berk. Nice and long, and well set on his shoulders. Shouldn’t hide that—it was an asset. Likely he’d look good framed in a pullover similar to Draco’s, and in the same green, too. Go along with his weird-coloured eyes—surely not a natural shade, that. Not Charmed, though—git had been glaring at him with those same toad green eyes since First!
cheers."
Draco went stone still, face tightening into a bland mask.
Harry eyed her suspiciously and took a large bite of his sandwich, in part to buy time and in part because he was famished. Grimmauld’s alien alterations had unfortunately included a change in the fare Kreacher offered up at meal times and a constant cuisine of bon bons, champers and--oddly even for Kreacher--jellied eel pies was not a diet Harry felt he could thrive on.
Draco trailed off, gesturing vaguely with the remote. Potter did not reply, as such. He turned another page instead, scanning it so fast Draco half expected his silly toad-coloured eyeballs to start spinning.
"Oh," the pale eyebrows soared, "I'm not being snide, Potter," and the white teeth flashed. Harry closed his eyes briefly against the lust-love combo that sloshed through him like battery acid. Malfoy chuckled, obliviously amused. "I was just taken aback, a little. You…surprised me."
The urbane and cosmopolitan—yet somehow unexpectedly sensitive and intuitive—Narcissa Malfoy sipped her Oolong daintily, briefly closing her delicate eyelids in admiration of the wafting and elusive aroma of steamed jasmine-scented leaves. Sighing lightly, she placed her cup upon its paper-thin saucer with a decided and deliberate 'clink!' Those finely plucked eyebrows, so like Draco's, drew together in the teeniest, tiniest of puzzled frowns. Her expertly reddened lips pursed as she cocked her head and stared wide-eyed and guileless at her sole offspring, ostensibly astounded at his gawp-and-huff reaction to his mother's perfectly sensible reaction. Her son scowled in return, lips thinned disagreeably.
“Gods, how I hate you,” Harry informed him out the side of his mouth, under cover of the sporadic clapping. “Like I hate peeling shrivelfigs, Ron. That much!”
, Harry!"
managed it by dusk fall, thankfully, and Draco took advantage of the golden opportunity to snog Harry quickly one last time, directly under the two Gryffindor's wrinkled-up noses (in horrified disgust, no doubt; Draco curled his own upper lip in stiff irritation and heartily wished them both to perdition), before they all headed off to their separate common rooms.
"Next time, Draco, wait for a reply, alright?" Harry smirked, drawing back and favouring his idiot fiancé with a superiour stare. He felt he'd a right to; not everyone could shut a Malfoy up so thoroughly when one was in a full spate of temper—nor would everyone care to, either. It took a special kind of Wizard—a real Hero—to accomplish such acts of bravery. Clearly, he and Malfoy were meant for one another. "It's not done to leave without one, dumb arse!"
"Love you, prat," Harry slurped his way up and off Draco's rigid dick with an audible pop, staring intently up at Draco's face. He gripped Draco's kneecaps, squeezing them comfortably, spreading them wide—and Draco allowed it, wide-eyed and intent on that gaze. "I love you so much, Draco. Please don't doubt it."
. Poor little girl. Wanting—and
Harry, scowling and shifting about uncomfortably in an effort to avoid her knowing smile, whacked his head on a flat stone hidden under the wool. Naturally and of course, but that was exactly in line with all the other irksome, painful little mini-crises that had occurred to him ever since he'd realized Malfoy was the direct cause for his raving case of the 'hots'. He'd entered a whole new realm of accident-prone since that fateful moment. Afflicted with Malfoy-itis, he was nothing more than a walking disaster zone.
Snogging as if he would die if he didn't, Harry proceeded to halt all the silly thoughts and notions occupying Draco Malfoy's whirling head.
Harry—
“Cruel!” Harry interrupted. “It’s downright mean of you. I’m under Veritus, you arse. Of course I want to tell you the truth. I generally want to anyway; I don’t care much for lying.”
“Shan’t,” Millie said promptly, pausing at the door to smirk wickedly over her shoulder. “I, unlike you, am blissfully free for the rest of the day. All the shite on my desk is now properly processed and placed promptly on yours, Boss Man, which is as it should be. I’m off for a relaxing shop, actually. Agent Provocateur's Diagon is having a clearance on racy lingerie and I don’t want to miss it. I only stayed to ensure you ate something other than eel pie and chocs. Can’t have you expiring in your first month on the job, can we?”
"Couldn't," Harry mumbled, lips brushing Draco's collarbone. One deft hand snuck up and began unbuttoning the silk-knotted frogs that clasped together the high neck of his tunic. "Floo's broken, too, and I didn't think to Owl you till it was late—and then poor Ernestine's nesting. You know how it is."
. Draco outright hated bloody sharing, though he'd learnt not to let on too, too obviously—at least, not to Mister Brilliantly Oblivious.
"Just, you know. With our houses carrying on the way they are.  It's too silly. Separately. And now, I mean, and not--not years ago. It's not important, though. Tell you the joke later, alright? If I even remember; if it even is a joke. You know me, finding things funny when they're actually not, right? Anyway, Harry. We'll catch up as soon as we're able, alright? If it's not this evening, then some other--”
“It’s just his hair’s…that peculiar colour—and very different,” he explained seriously. “It’s unusual, is all. Not even Luna’s hair is quite like it…though I s’pose she’s the closest. In, er, hue. Maybe they’re related. Everyone else is.”
to me for a moment. Hear me out."
“Kill me,” he implored of Hermione, clutching her sleeve imploringly. “Kill me now, please!”
“No clue,” Harry replied shortly, reseating himself before his horrible blotter and whipping out his quill, a distinct air of the business-like and professionally keen pouring off his aura. “Bugger’s gone off the map, damn him. However--”
This was so ruddy important to him—this was all the remainder of his life at stake. He wanted it to be perfect. Perfect timing—perfect ring—perfect in every way. Harry simply must respond favourably—there was nothing else to it! But all the urgency in the world did not a blasted thing for Draco's faltering ability to enunciate clearly at that precise moment—or at much above a croaky strangled whisper. Harry leant closer, puzzled and apparently having trouble hearing him.
"Harry--" Draco began. Trailed off, abruptly unsure how--or if--he might continue.
Draco wasn’t scoffing. He was vaguely aware that Harry had become one of those people who knew rather a lot about rather a wide array of things. A sort of Jack-of-All person. It wasn't really a surprise to him. Harry had always been a quick study and Draco was fairly certain he’d have been a much better student at Hogwarts if he’d a half a chance to study. He’d certainly excelled in Runes at Flamel. Along with quite a few of the lectures they’d shared and several extracurricular courses.
"Stop saying that! Stop saying 'no' to me, Harry. Look at me, alright? Just
"What?" Brown poked her head up from where she was doodling across the bottom corner of one of Dean's sketchbooks and giggled. "You mean like 'Let's Pretend'?"
, which was one of Harry's favourites. And consumed his share in solitary splendour, too…cursing all the while.
"Obviously, Malfoy."
“Wait. No. A moment, if you please.”
Potter grinned against Draco's throat, that secretive twitch of the lips he had, a smirk which should have sat oddly on his features, really, but didn't. Draco knew this because the rapidly heating and quite damp skin of his abused throat registered the movement of Potter's mouth. He sniffed in response and elevated his chin sharply; he didn't appreciate the unsolicited amusement, especially when this business was already sufficiently uncomfortable to broach. Perhaps entirely too uncomfortable. Perhaps some other time and occasion might be better?
Narcissa batted her lashes at him, all innocent maternal love overflowing in bounteous waves. It was highly unlike her.
He gestured at the tray as he retrieved the perfectly prepared mug of tea Harry had left him. “What’s all this then? I thought we were going out?”
It was a bit horrible, all of it. The transformation. The feeling of being a stranger in his own home, being poked and prodded about by an unseen but powerful force.
"Idiot!" Harry exclaimed, and halted his spin. There! The tiny hillock that rose from the far end of the Lake—the one he'd discovered quite by accident when he'd first flown on Buckbeak.
Only worse. Bit imposing, really. Definitely not in the slightest bit normal.
"Oh! Ooooh!"
With a few judicious twists of the Bakelite Muffling Knob, his Father's historic rant was but a dulled hiss of static, and Draco watched in discreet quietude as his sire's lips moved furiously but without much more than an infuriated murmur carrying over the distance. Though Lucius's arms still waved wildly about, along with his positively not-grey hair. Draco, happily, only caught every three words instead of shuddering through each single high-pitched virulent syllable.
Draco chortled, a little louder now that he, at least, was positive they were alone. He leered a bit, leaning toward Harry and winking familiarly.
Despite the drawl, Draco's hand flexed convulsively above the small box, as if he were about to grab it, to take it to him and rip away all the concealing paper and bow—to expose it to his surgical gaze and his precise, calculating mind, and give him free leave to conjure up all manner of humiliating ideas as to why his friend—his partner and his shag buddy—would hand him a piece of very expensive jewelry for Christmas.
"Clearly you're
'Here' was the Place, the one Harry had been handed down from his dead godfather. The Place which looked ever so much…so much improved than when he'd been last, that glorious day Harry had moved out of Grimmauld and into their flat. At first glance he could see that, just staring blindly about. At second glance, Draco's eyes widened as they really starting taking in the sights. Things had definitely changed, and in such a short while, too.
So quiet it was in main room of the Caerphilly Cheese Canteen—that alarmingly trendy new 'hotspot' for the younger Wizarding set, conveniently right off Diagon in the newly updated Knockturn, or so the reviews read—a single brass fondue ladle hitting the floor would've been deafening. But no one so much as inhaled, nor swallowed their neatly apportioned chunks of fruit or sourdough. No melted cheddar dared drip and shatter the breathlessly overflowing silence—which was how Harry heard that little break in Draco's voice so clearly. That hitch, that telltale gulp, as if exiting a loo—
"Huh?" It was all Harry could do to keep his attention from straying. Malfoy sounded so serious, so intent. He was entranced more by the tone of words than the actual meaning. "Er?"
Harry nodded instantly, though not quite certain how he was to go about that. The post-Voldemort Ron Weasley was a bloody firecracker. Highly volatile. He jabbed at his friend’s ribcage for starters, using Hermione’s elbow tactic.
“Look, just please, please cease with all your idiot yowling, Ron,” Harry pleaded, two fingers going to his aching sinus. That made his specs slip and he irritably straightened them. “Because, you know, it’s really not like that and I don’t need you up my nose this early, arse. I’m only, only observing—that’s
“Yes, of course you may, silly twat! It’s been a full month already; I’ve not seen you at all!  More, probably. Never mind all this"--he waved carelessly at the ominous amount of paperwork surrounding him--"it's totally normal. And--and why the
Over nothing much in particular, too—a weedy, moony-eyed waitress and a stray Floo number dropped in Harry's in passing. Nothing that mattered, not really. Not as if it didn't happen all the time and to both of them, for chrissake!
, either. There was only Potter—had always been Potter—would
“No, it's definitely settled, Hermione," he said after a long moment. "A toast to your native ingenuity, oh Brightest Witch!” He raised his glass in salute, enjoying her slight blush. "See? Harry's stopped sulking already. Good man."
They browsed through the bookstore, Draco retrieving and paying for his package, and then went off to Zonko's, where Potter did the same, looking quite pleased with himself. With the parcels shrunken and time on their hands, they wandered about Honeyduke's for a good half-hour, purchasing a great deal of chocolate in various forms and, for Draco, several bags of the hard boiled green-apple sweets he liked to suck on when he was writing essays.
“I know,” Harry sighed, rising to his feet and sweeping a heap of scrolls aside. His blotter had not improved in the past few days; often he could barely make out the very nice gold-leaf imprint round the edges. “But Eihwaz is the primary message. Transitions. Off with the old, in with the new, all that. So let’s consider, right? What’s no longer benefiting us, Luna, Mills? What do we need take a new view of? Departmentally speaking
He buried his nose in Harry's hair, raising a not-too-trembling hand to smooth back errant tendrils.
"On the count of three, then," Draco mumbled, a fingertip still soothing down an errant curl to the brightly shaded ribbon. He'd not touched Harry's gift beyond that, as if it were something terribly dangerous—a magical cabinet he'd no interest in opening. "Alright?"
He flung himself out of his clothes, not caring that he left them all over the floor. Shoved on his pajamas with little care and dove beneath the duvet as quickly as he could, spelling the sconces out as he went.
want to be caught doing.
"But—but it's so sudden, Draco," Harry protested. "Um, really very sudden. Are you sure?"
"Malfoy," Potter turned to him when they were at last finishing their purchasing, and nodded toward a crooked, half-hidden alley a block or so down the High Street. "Come on—you haven't seen all of Hogsmeade till you've seen Kringleshank's Emporium. Let's go there next."
"Ah, darling!" His Mum trilled a gentle laugh in Draco's direction, obviously delighted over Draco's hectic facial blotches and attendant fluster. "You're asking for Maman Cecilie's ring, are you not? Well! Why have you not simply come out with it before now, darling? No need for all this obfustication, Draco. You could've simply Owled me. I'd have sent it off to you immediately."
“You say ‘more,” Draco prompted, his hands tightening infinitesimally upon Harry’s shoulders.
Not always love, true enough, but certainly feelings—quite strong and persistent ones.
"Because—because I find I—I cannot c-continue to exist without—" he forged staunchly onward, gathering his Malfoyness about him like an impervious cloak of assurance and all the while aghast: at his feeble words, his foolishly pink face—and the stupid Veela wings that came ripping madly out from his robes unexpectedly, creating a huge fuss and flutter—and so much extraneous noise! Hades, he could barely hear himself speak above the windy rush of feathers—no wonder Harry was having troubles! "You. Potter. I mean to say, I—I love you—you, always, and I would be most honoured if you'd accept this token of my affections—"
"Well, I found one, just now," he jerked his fair head. "A spell that'll help us do it. Back there in the stacks. Up for it, Harry?"
“Are you,” Draco cut him off pleasantly enough, smiling still in a way that conveyed absolutely not a single shred of sincere good humour, “implying that just because a minor cast a Veritus Charm upon you it’s not a serious matter? Is that it?”
"Shut
Draco sighed, planting kisses round Potter's hole.
“Yes, git,” Harry smiled. “Whatever you want. I’ll go—be happy to. I think I’d like it, actually.”
, please! I've suffered enough, thanks!"

“In fact, I ought to be off making badges, just like Mal—“
had sprung up from but it had hardly mattered—he liked it, and it had wonderful advice. Likely a passing shy fan had slipped it in his unguarded bag—maybe a Ravenclaw, even—but Harry couldn't be arsed to care about that. He was thankful, of course, for their kindness but then they never let up on him, did they?
"Draco?" Potter prodded again, quirking up a dark eyebrow and pursing his lips. "Alright there?"
"You aren't," Draco gulped, because this was alternate universe stuff, this concept; totally foreign, "you aren't...by any chance…asking me to m-m-marry—"
"If you
people—the sick sort, who couldn't resist pulling a joke, no matter what the circumstances? Like those twin Weasels—but no; Draco would've noticed. He knew Potter far too well at this point. Comfortably well, with the ease of a very old friend.
"I'm telling you, it's the same thing as the Talent Show, all over again," Bulstrode sighed. "Really, Draco, I thought you were as smart as Granger, here."
company's enjoyable, Harry, I'll never—"
"Well, Harry, then you'll just have to give up on him, won't you?" She shrugged the whole of his problem to the side off-handedly, raising her pert eyebrows in patent mockery. "Since you so obviously have already." Also the leading edge of her very look book, which covered the topic of magical arachnids, their various webs, silks and useful venoms, including—or so she'd informed Harry not twenty minutes previous—a fascinating in-depth essay on why exactly Wizards—or most Wizards, Ron being the notable exception—treated them with great care and more than a passing affection. "If you're already convinced you've lost, that is. Give it up, then."
Harry, Draco noted, looked pretty confident. Of course, he’d had some little success with quelling Grimmauld’s own declaration of ‘House Knows Best’, the lucky bugger, but even so, his control over the Place was a bit spotty. It may've been merely that Harry hadn't an ounce of spare time to truly set it to rights, but Harry's Ancient and Noble manse still rather more resembled a bawdy house than the home of a highly respected Runes Archmage. Too, Kreacher and Hermione had both reluctantly admitted Potter was ultimately fighting a losing battle. Draco had made sure to consult them--discreetly, of course. He eyed Harry suspiciously. Gryffindor bravado was not going to get him his old familiar Manor back, no. But a Harry Potter fighting tooth-and-nail for his friend? Now, that was an entirely different cauldron of flobberworm spit, and Draco was gambling on it.
"Anyway, Malfoy," Harry very firmly attempted to steer their conversation back on track. "I like what you're doing here for Nev. Let's get him settled first, alright?"
“Shag, actually,” Harry corrected him. “But snogging’s a good start, so yes. That too, definitely. So, ah? Are you game?”
Draco shook his head sharply, sending his fringe flying into his lashes. “Want to, actually. Owe it to you and it’s only fitting. You should be prepared.”
This is a place of death, of danger, ancient and strong, but it will not bleed over nor stain the world Harry and Luna and Garambeau love and care for, not on this night.
Harry, when he and the rest of his group are returned to their rudely interrupted meal at De Oude’s house in the The Hague, is bound and determined to dig the blasted pebble out of his shoe and make a rune of it. His own, and it will be charmed to be a lion. A lion man, wand raised high. With a snake picked out of star-marks, perhaps, a glittering spiral encircling Harry’s lion rampant.
Draco spun about, turning his back on the Picasso and meeting his old friend's eyes again but this time from what felt to be a far safer distance. Potter had always been far, far too sharp for a Gryffindor. And it paid to be wary when one was unfortunately now committed to talking about difficult things. Such as stupid old manors which acted out in defiance of their master's express wishes and how he, personally, wasn't exactly in the market for an infant. Now or possibly ever, really.
"Too late, mate," Nott announced. "It's started."
see what's in front of my eyes, too. Likely better than
—that horrid photo spread of Harry as the Wizarding World's premiere bachelor—and a vaguely ribald caption. Charmed, though, and nicely, to stay always full of his particular brand of tea, just the way he liked it: very stewed, two sugars and three creams, stirred lightly. No lemon.
Well—Potter was firmly herded to his by his glaring lieutenants, but then that was obviously the jealous ginger git's doing. Draco sauntered, as he was wont to do after a particularly satisfying sexual experience, and crowed inwardly over the horrified looks on the Mudblood's and the Weasel's faces when they finally caught sight of the matching rings. He'd quite forgotten to spell them in the haste of their pell-mell return to the Castle. Draco shrugged the oversight away—they'd have to know sometime and it may as well be official, as it
be enough, now! Remember your Little Issue, dear. Brandy, my dear; yes, that's the ticket. Or Calming Potion and brandy--even more efficacious, my sweet."
"Er?" Harry asked the empty room. The fire crackled. "Oh! Oh, fuck! That sod—that git! What is he thinking?"
"And test it out on our own, in secret, and then present it to the group," Malfoy went on doggedly. "And then, if it's amusing, we'll all play it. It'll be fun."
—a—minor, Malfoy!” Harry shrieked quietly. “I’ve been fully emancipated since last year, dickweed. And I can just as easily go find Seamus, if you going to be like this. I’m sure Dean will let me borrow him. He can finish me off if you can’t be bothered!”
Ever the little gentleman, Harry glanced first at his distressed female best friend.
“You silly arse, what are you doing?” Draco asked, blinking strands of softly wafting black strands out of his lashes. "Ridiculous Potty."
"I—Harry. No!" Draco licked his lips. Blinked away a bit of lint that obscured his vision for moment. That was what must be making it blurry. "That's. Tha-"
!" he cried out, and spurted what seemed like a second tremendous load of spunk just as large as the first, straight onto the stinky, sweat and lube-soaked fabric of the sofa. "
attention—if it couldn't be Malfoy, at least let it be a person who cared for him, willing to hear him air out all his venting of emotional doldrums! "I'm not convinced I've lost, Hermione! I just don't believe I can win. That's different! Not at all the same thing!"
“Alright, mate?”
"Yeah, mate," Goyle chimed in, raising his glass.
“Oh, no, but thanks all the same. I really cannot manage another thing; I'm so sorry. Another time, I promise. However. Since you insist, then.” He regarded his friend gravely. "There is actually a specific reason I called, yes. It is to do with the Manor, yes, just as Hermione told you, but it's not a curse, so much. It's a condition, rather."
"yes, you are. And make me, then."
But Ron sang out despite them, his volume rising as he picked up the rhythm of the decrepit nursery rhyme, used to torment unfortunate children the world over in some form or another.
…Of course, none of Draco's good intentions nor well-meaning, honourable tenets regarding Courtship would prevent him from possibly AKing Harry himself, right this instant, or so he concluded, staring down upon the slight form of the bloody ridiculous Golden One.
"And I don't care to. I won't allow it. You're not permitted to leave me, Potter. Never."
-fuck
! went the Quaffle!
Draco didn't wait for the nod; he had two fingers in and was scissoring away, his gaze trained on Harry's face going slack under his rapid but careful ministrations. Draco got his hand on Harry's cock and stated pumping away, smearing the clear precum around when it welled up; giving the foreskin a teasing lick and suck here and there. Soon enough, Harry's prick had swelled to a lovely reddish-purple at the bulging tip, and was hard as marble statues down the length of it. Draco eyed it avidly. Harry was well-hung; in proportion, naturally, but thick at the base of him. Draco salivated a bit, licking the tell-tale moisture away from his parted lips at the last minute. He'd rather wanted Harry in him, as well, but they hadn't enough minutes left as it was.
Draco hesitated uncertainly, eyes widening as he took in the heaps and stacks of Owls and envelops, scrolls, texts, rocks and whatnot not only on the desk itself but also stacked haphazardly to either side of it.
"If I tell them, they'll have us Bonded before we can say 'Bob's your uncle', Draco."
"I don't know what you mean!" he snarled. "I haven't! I've not done anything to you, Malfoy! Nothing recently, at least. 'Cept maybe save your arse in DADA yesterday—remember that?"
"Yes, of course, son. Still, as I mentioned, Harry at least will lend you a sympathetic shoulder in my absence, dear one; you  really ought at least Owl him--oh! Speaking of? Have I told you we’ve been invited to stay with an old school friend of ours on her lovely large yacht? She keeps it in Monaco, right in the harbour. UnPlottable, naturally, given the amount of Muggles, but still, it should be quite, quite the Season in the Wizarding district. I'm afraid I'm vastly looking forward, darling. This has been exactly the sort of holiday I was hoping for, after that unfortunate business with your father. I do hope you don't blame me for making my escape, dear one. I am, I confess, feeling an entirely new Witch these days."
"Not daft," Harry grumped, staring down at their two separate arms, each decorated with the same piece, the same protective charm, and it seemed Draco had sprung for the engraving too, because his snitch had a tiny HD inscribed on its belly. "Just…just," he shrugged, because he wasn't saying it if Draco wasn't saying it. "You know," he muttered darkly. "You know."
"Well, I don't but maybe
“Better, though? The best you’ve ever had, right, Potter? Isn’t it?”
Harry sighed, peering closely down at The Flower from his broom, squinting through his goggles. His flying leathers creaked and squeaked as he shifted his seating, pointing his wand tip carefully so as to accurately trace the long stem and looping leaves of The Flower. Luna and Ichika-san hovered at either side, each occupied with examining various other sprawling figures marking the arid Nazca plateau.
"Harry. What is this, d'you think?"
, the silently sitting telly, the very dust itself. Nothing a Charm couldn't remedy but who cared? Who really cared? "Fuck
“Oh! No, no, it’s nothing like that,” Harry said quickly, having surfaced from whatever reverie he'd fallen into, staring off into the middle distance like he'd been. “I do really like this flat, honestly. It’s...well, it’s hard to put it into words?”
He stomped fully backward into the floo, snatching at the powder jar they kept close by and dumping a cloudy shower of it over his neatly combed head in his haste to escape. Potter’s voice stopped abruptly, cut off as Draco was nearly instantly whirled away, though last Draco saw, his stupid mouth was still open and stupidly flapping.
Those wee ducklings, all golden and fuzzy, paddling about their wee painted pond and quacking happily. Egads.
"Idiot," Draco snarled fondly. "Don't do that, arse. I've told you!"
And his hapless hand, reaching wildly to stay Draco—to keep him present and accessible.
Bloody Draco Malfoy had not been the slightest surprised by this new avid Harry. Oh, no. The arse only laughed up his sleeve and made smirking faces at him whenever Harry complained of the assignments he’d piled upon him. But he’d also helped him revise, just as he’d quietly aided poor Ron when he'd had to complete his final slog through uni-level Potions to obtain his desired degree in Forensic Magics. Yes, Draco was a bit of a contrary arse, but he was also a bit of a poser, too. Always playing it cool and then being just right there, helping a mate out, no fanfare about it. The utter git.
," Potter amended, glaring meaningfully all 'round him. Brown kept hers downcast; Malfoy flushed faintly. Granger twiddled her wand in a meaningful fashion, staring 'round the group. "As agreed, right?"
“See if I care.”
Not that he’d ever let on that he’d…noticed Potter. Oh, no! He could just imagine Pansy’s reaction to that! Not a pretty picture!
"Thank you, ma'am; that'll do nicely," he agreed, albeit through clenched teeth. "Tell me; is there any sort of family discounting available? For Very Large Orders? And have you relatives who handle photography—or whatever else is required for an Engagement Celebration? Um, cakes, perhaps? There should be cake. We'll require them, I think."
well past ten, yes? And ten sharp's when she usually shoos us all right out. Can't wait to dive into her yellow fuzzy slippers and her sherry bottle."
"Oh, yes." His Mum was tapping a long fingernail against her chin, bobbing her intricate coiffure ever so slowly, her eyes bright with speculation. The fond maternal smile had slid subtly into what Draco perceived as a rather evil and reptilian grin; she seemed entirely too highly intrigued with this topic, his Mum, and Draco shivered over it. Nothing about that expression boded well for his peace of mind. "Mmm-hmm. I see now, Draco. You know, I find I do completely understand your quandary, darling. Really, you must have had a particularly difficult time with it, all these many years at school attending with him. As it was of course Potter and not just any old Tom, Dick or Harry, correct? But naturally instead, ah, the Harry." She waved a white hand at him, reflexively shooing off all other potential contenders for her son's affections. "Couldn't have been any other boy, though—really, no. No, no, no—not remotely a possibility, not now I consider the entire picture. The Slug Incident, dear, and then the mudslinging you complained of so bitterly, not to mention all those Quidditch games you forfeited, darling…why, it's almost as if it were Fated, dear. How very…sweet."
"Circe. Don't look now but this has gone all skew-whiff, Harry," Draco breathed quietly, doing his best to ignore the Manor's antics. "Deucedly odder than breakfast-time, this is."
“Oh! Right on, Hermione,” Draco said happily, a great more enthused about life than he’d been for some time.  "The Manor will like that, very much. A willing victim. Yours, too, Harry. There's bound to be some couple out there in Wizard-dom who really craves that genuine brothel experience. Takes all sorts, right?"
coming, my baby Gryffling, you meant to say, right?” Malfoy insisted. “Maybe—right—
"Come a little closer, why don't you?" Draco leered, feeling quite rakish.
Probably never had anything of the sort, Draco decided loftily, being terribly poor and brought up by those godsawful Muggles. Probably didn't own a single valuable thing to call his own—well, except that Cloak of his, and his broom. Draco had wondered now and then—hadn't dwelled on it—but he'd wondered if Potter might not appreciate some sort of gift. A remembrance. Certainly, Draco was wealthy enough to see his way clear to purchasing a little something to signify their budding friendship, even if Potter wasn't. Likely he'd never even think of such a thing, being Muggle-raised, so Draco would need first to educate him concerning the finer points of gifting amongst Wizards. It was quite an involved and symbolic process, Draco recalled, his mind wandering for a moment, until he recalled that this was not at all what he'd intended.
After graduation. After he'd had a chance to show the world he was a proper candidate for Potter's paw.
Harry jerked his head in the affirmative, biting his lips to keep them from flapping on about precisely how much ‘better’ all his feelings for Draco were now. “Mmmrgh!”
"Alright, Malfoy," Potter replied cheerfully, nodding. "What'd you have in mind?"
“Oh bah,” he testily informed the Nursery every single morning. “This again? Look here, I’m only twenty-five, you know. And no real prospects, either, so you’re a bit out of touch. This is so not happening. Please, give it a rest, do.”
, in the absence of this cold, chilly figure perched on the very bitter edge of the mussed bed.
“Ngh.” To all intents and purposes, Draco was still very much asleep. Logically and ergo, he was…staying. In fact; demonstrably. Like a dog in its familiar bed, like a ship in safe harbor. A tower rooted to its land.
"What. Is. That. Infernal. Gryffindor.
"Can't do any harm, not at this point—and he might very well change his mind over the Greengrass girl if he knows you're the one sniffing after his heels," Hermione went on sensibly, ticking her fingers over in time. "It's possible, Harry—admit it. Draco likes power and you're a powerful chap, even with Elder Wand put away. There's advantages to being you—to having you to claim a bloke as one's own. He likely knows that; he's no fool."
That it didn't matter if Draco's arm was Marked, or that his own father was a criminal and incarcerated in Azkaban. That it was purely incidental he'd tried to murder Dumbledore several times and had very nearly succeeding in harming unto death any number of other, innocent people, including Potter's best mate.
“Oh!” Harry beamed at Draco, eyes alight. “I guess that’s it, exactly! I suppose I’ve missed that too, that feeling. You know what?”
"Daft. As houses—no! We're both daft as Lovegood's Nargles, Harry. That's all I was saying."
[B O O M]
It was three weeks to the dreadful Tuesday later Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger staged a sort of intervention. In Harry and Draco's flat but not with Harry present, naturally (he'd moved out, on Day 254). Only with one Draco Malfoy, the recent 'ex'. He'd stayed, ever in denial, ever hopeful. Counting days and moping something fierce. ('Pitiful', Zabini called it, the insensitive lout.)
"Should have guessed?" Harry asked, carefully, because really—could the two of them actually be that much of the same mind? Over this? "That I'd—that you would—what? What, Draco? What odds? It's not like its so obvious…is it?"
"Ple-please!" It was a blink and half, no more, as Malfoy reared up, dropped trou and lining his cockhead up against Harry's smeared and waiting arse, the lubed fingertips traveling from sphincter to dick without pause, spreading the slime of sex. 'Oh-gods-AHHH!"
has published our schedule of public appearances over the next week or so, before the actual ceremony—we can celebrate with everyone that way-and then your mother's handing all the details of actual Bonding. She's just consented, via Owl, before you came down to breakfast, so it's all settled but for the shouting. A June wedding is what every Malfoy betrothed has aspired to, these thousand years—so
And indeed, how he

Like this evening. When they’d been sharing some really brilliant time together. Draco had been under the impression things had been going really very well. Matey, like the old days.
, particularly. Want that. Although Grimmauld seems to have developed different ideas, if the décor and diet are anything to go by.”
"Potter, I don't want to waste much time here," he warned disagreeably, suddenly feeling terribly uncomfortable. "We've all sorts of places still to visit, remember?"
“Really, Ronald,” she observed mildly, sending her boyfriend a mild sort of glare on Harry’s behalf and shaking Harry off easily. “You are a pea brain, aren’t you? Never know when to leave off. Can’t you see Harry’s narked? Oh, and Harry—pass the juice, will you? And ignore Ron.”
, a book that had rather mysteriously appeared in his bag one afternoon, recently. Didn't know where
“Unspeakably so,” Harry nodded mock-dolefully, kicking back idly at a sagging stack of papers and whatnot set beneath his desk. “But now I'm home we must spend some quality time, and soon. So?” He cocked a hopeful eyebrow, wrinkling the faded silvery tracing of his old scar.
"Right, sure thing..." Draco tilted his head to focus severely upon his idiot Gryffindor boyfriend. The one who had great plans but sometimes neglected the finer details. "And how, exactly,
please-and-thank-you!"
Harry felt it on an array of levels; without and within.
Potter smirked at him. "That's better, Malfoy. Now you're with the programme."
“Eeensy-weensy, tiny, baby, wee Potterette.”
“Oh, stop, Malfoy.”
"Clearly," he added. "Thinking, I mean."
"You daft fool! Must you always be aping me?" But he was laughing, openly, and the sight of it drew eyes and mutters from the other sippers and chatterers. Harry blushed scarlet, staring down at his box because he'd nowhere else that was even remotely possible—and if Draco continued to look like that, with that expression of laughing wonder, Harry would throw caution to the winds and be scrambling 'cross the table, snogging him for all he was worth.
The classroom was a bloody furnace; his cheeks were scorching. Draco pressed a trembling hand over his heart and inhaled slowly through his nose.
He looked carefully at his friend, an odd pang twinging in his chest when he was met with an inexplicable small silence on his mate's end. It was, he realized unhappily, more than a tad hurtful, the idea that Harry might not particularly relish sharing quarters again with his old uni roommate. But he'd certainly never, ever indicated anything of the sort...had he?
us, Harry! Get up! Get up
“Puny Potty!”
“Huh! You wish!”
“Oh, it is, believe me,” Harry exclaimed fervently, whirling about. He galloped back to Draco and grasped his forearm, his wine glass and the bottles finally--thankfully--cast aside and sloshing along merrily behind him.
Granger's bright gaze slid over to Draco's face before she turned away for the final time and for a second he felt much as he had when Aunt Bellatrix was teaching him Occulomancy: like a beetle pinned to wall by tiny poisonous darts. It was quite clear to him then that she trusted him not at all and it was only Harry's specific request that kept her from hexing him quite as nastily as Weasley git so obviously wished to.
manage to clue in eventually, you know. Auroring will suit me to a tee, thanks, so bugger off about my career. But…you were saying?"
“Um.” Not in the least offended, Harry pensively scratched at the slight stubble just blooming visible on the side of his lean jaw. “Thing is, about that? No, actually. M'not, so much. Had to stop in at St Mungo’s Spell Damage. Sorry about that, though, me taking so long over it. But I’m fine. Mostly. They say. Or will be.”
"Are you two," Longbottom leaned forward hopefully, releasing his bear, "breaking up, maybe?"

Draco narrowed his eyes and cocked his chin, regarding his beloved mater suspiciously. “No,” he replied flatly. “Why should I, Mum? What’s Harry going to do about the situation? Come and be all heroic and scold it soundly? Chant Runes at it politely and request it cease-and-desist? Hardly!”
Prompt: #335 for kitty_fic* see below.
And Harry exulted—silently, secretly. Because that meant
‘Just Harry’ rolled his eyes in a very Pottery way and Draco fully relented, giving up on the notion of it not actually being Harry before him. But only slightly. If it really was Harry, then he was still banshee-shit
"Draco?
“So…” Draco breathed out a huge sigh, shoulders slumping. “You’re saying just do it and to fucking Hades with the consequences if it all goes to shit? If we were to end up hating each other--or just...just be indifferent? Not even mates anymore? I don't know if I can bear it.”

With a simultaneous sharp slash downward and the left, they ended the Negatus, tearing it to harmless shreds, and then continued their flow of amplified casting on the upswing, sealing the affected glyph with Protectives and Conservators Charms. Luce would be by to ascertain all was well with it at a later time, naturally, being the resident Archmage.
“Perhaps it does, for them,” Harry nodded, casting carefully so as not to damage the adjacent artworks. “Though they view it through a different lens than we do. There, Luna! Do you see the Negatus? Luce was correct; there’s damage been done here. And deliberately.”
™ lip-gloss he'd discovered on one of Harry's shirt collars of an evening and he absolutely would not tolerate Harry ditching a quiet dinner at home with his partner to plod over yet

, yes—the word described the effect brilliantly. He wondered why he’d never noticed that specific quality of, er, ‘prettiness’ before, in relation to the git.
“Yes, so?”
"Ye-yes…ah! Wait—one sec. Gotta say the other—hah!"
Harry was as bent as Draco was, the sod, and admitted it, no excuses. He just happened to be horribly…atrociously
There was a tiny pause, internally and externally. Harry could practically feel Draco's mind, ticking over.
"You're joking with me, right, arse?" He laughed, almost helplessly. "This—this is some sort of prank…maybe? Because I didn't quite catch all of what you were saying, Draco—but—"
Draco could swear he heard Harry's teeth gritting over that last…and then the world thankfully fuzzed out and Draco Malfoy, Headmistress McGonagall's contentious choice for Head Boy and a known ex-Death Eater, tough as they come, came as close to fainting dead away as a Malfoy ever did, his elegant person dipping and swaying and approaching the Reparo'd flagstones at top speed as he tottered and stumbled.
“What the bloody fuck?” Harry gasped, clutching instinctively at Draco's arm.
Then they’ll go away, just as quietly all of them, back to whence they came--HQ, Spain, the Alps, the Baltic, Down Under and all sundry parts of the globe--and Harry?
even when that barmy-brained, Nargle-snuggling naturalist bloke Rolf What'sit and good old daft Looney Lovegood had had what amounted to some sort of peculiar Ravenclaw version of a lover's tiff in the middle of his and Harry's dining room during their inaugural 'let's meet each other's friends, again, and manage to be civil this time 'round' supper party.
Harry, Draco was proud to say, though he wouldn’t ever, really, not to his face at least, was a very good egg, and damned good Wizard to have at one’s back in a tight corner. Draco honestly adored the idiot and would very likely duel to the death any fool stupid enough to plot harm against him.
“Pity,” echoed Pansy, faintly. “Oh, yes.”
Indeed, but of course he wouldn't have thought of his current situation in those terms of Pottery inevitability. It was the very last thing that would ever cross his conscious mind, he and Potter. Together—an item? Absolutely not. Never in a million years could he have imagined the odd twists of fate and fortune combined that would lead to him—Draco Malfoy—being utterly enthralled with him—that ginormous git Potter!
"Draco!" Harry looked momentarily taken aback at Draco's vehemence. He scowled, just a bit, and his gaze turned cautious. Judging. "Draco…really! Uncalled for, alright? She's just…she's a bit at loose ends, now. Spare a little pity, yeah?"
Draco folded his lips thin. This was more than enough, this whole ridiculous tiff. It had gone far enough, and he must needs put to a stop to it. Anything he needed to do, he would do.
"Harry."
was. As he'd
Adamantly, the Manor retaliated at every instance of Draco’s adamant denial.
"Yes. First off, you were hysterical, pretty much, and you were crying. You despise crying, idjit. I had to make it stop. What did you want me to do? Silencio? Stifle you with my hand? I rather think not! I’m not some fucking abuser. Shock value, however, is proven to be helpful--”
“Of course, Mum; I’m listening." Draco sat up straight abruptly and nodded dutifully, recalled to his vaguely uncomfortable present. "Every word. Yes, I promise I’ll Floo him. And I'm sure he wouldn't ever, Mum. He's likely run off his feet, settling in. Now what was that about the Prince’s cousin? Oh, another distant Black relative...ah, right, right. Fascinating, naturally. Yes, yes, of course. Please tell me more.”
Harry didn't care—couldn't care about much other than what he was feeling. It was ungainly, maybe even uncomfortable, his position, but Harry could care less than snap for all that. Here was all he'd been gagging after for months now, laying comfortably atop him, drowning all his senses. Who gave a flying fuck whether Malfoy had actually come for him or for Hermione's religiously accurate notes?
Draco’s face darkened. “Yes, and what’s so different about that? It’s basically the same story here, Potter.”
…It was only later—significantly later, when he’d retreated to his bed and closed his curtains—that Draco realized he’d spent a rather a long period of his day justifying his own excitement to himself, and all because Pansy and Nott had been nothing but their usual arses over being dragged along to a Quidditch match. Not even a terribly interesting match, either. The only item of actual interest had been that bloody…Potter?
“Ick,” Hermione nodded. She returned to applying even layers of jam and butter to her toast. Harry returned to viewing Malfoy, like an Auror would.
Next time, he vowed to himself, and Summoned more lube with the charm every Wizarding teen learnt at puberty.
"Huh!" she huffed, bobbing her head. "Well, I don't think so, Harry. I think of it as an opportunity. But then…"
Reaching round a hand to the back of the marvellous settee, he tugged Harry’s terribly gauche but oddly warming Cannons souvenir-size rug down and arranged it around his legs where’d he stretched them out. Glancing over at his still vaguely frowning flatmate, he chuckled softly. “Hmm, sorry. Uncalled for, that. Want some warmth, you? It’s large enough for two, this terrible thing, I’ll say that for it. Ugly as a Banshee’s arse end and blinding to view but definitely large enough.”
“Hmmm,” Malfoy hummed, and re-commenced the steady, assured rocking he’d interrupted himself earlier, and that only just to play with his pet Gryffindor. “You’ve a point, Puny Pothead. I’d rather keep my bits intact, yes. But...I just must ask: what about you, little Harry? Are you scared of the big bad Slytherin dick? Because you’re hardly enticing me nicely to finish the job, shrinking Gryffling. I expected some youthful enthusiasm—a little more energy, here, as befitting your astounding lack of years. Begging would be a pleasant thing—I’d like that.”
"Mmmm, no," Harry pressed his swollen lips against the side of throat that warmed his cheekbone, his scarred forehead; nibbled gently at the fragrant skin while he was at it. Draco's naked body shuddered beneath him. "M'here, aren't I? Can look after you now. Will."
“Yes, absolutely.” Theo smiled. “That’s it, Parkinson—you tell him.”
“Oh, Merlin, Mum,” he moaned over the floo to his mother, who was living permanently at large, and currently gallivanting through Tuscany with Blaise’s newly widowed mum for company. “It’s been a month now already. What am I to do?”
And then that snog—oh, it rated very highly on Draco's personal Snog Scale, to date. Pity it was the very last of them.
Or perhaps it was the stylish yet devilishly safe new play areas he’d discovered randomly distributed around the grounds during his morning and evening constitutionals. Sand and shallow waters in the one sunny place, a perfect array of what Draco immediately knew were ‘climbing trees’ in another shady glade. The child-sized maze made of honeysuckle and thornless yellow roses in yet a third, all a’flutter with beneficent, non-stinging insects. The mini-broom arena, the play castle, the nearly perfect replica of a Muggle play yard.
"Hmmm." Hermione nodded.
"Pfft. It's a bed, isn't it, git?" Harry poked him in the ribs, which incidentally sent him staggering off-balance towards the item in question before he regained his feet. "And it's
"Ah?" He gulped nervously. "M-Mal-ur?"

onto Draco's limp ring finger, snogged Draco's damp, perspiring brow fervently and very fast—
He was a git, still. A beautiful git, the light of Draco's life sort of git.
“Okay now?” Apparently any qualms Harry may’ve been experiencing were not something he felt he should be sharing with a Draco quite clearly teetering on the brink. “Alright, Malfoy?” he prodded. “Ready for this?”
“Ack-ack-urrr-argh!”
"No!" Harry seemed completely freaked out that he even asked that, and Draco's pulse settled down a bit in relief. "Gods,
“Huh,” Ron snorted, attacking guerilla-style from Harry’s other flank. “And you
"I…erm." Draco blanched, entirely nonplussed. His Mum was a terrifying lady, sometimes. He'd often suspected the same but he'd not time to spare for being terrorized in this exact manner at this exact moment; he had a mission driving this strange Happy Famblies tea party. Which he should be about accomplishing before they both washed away on wave of Oolong and maternal empathy, he and his scary Mum. "A-About that piece of heirloom jewelry I mentioned, Mother? Could we possibly get back to that? I really am in need of something both Malfoy and valuable, you see. Er—and today, if at all possible. I'd like to carry it back to Hogwarts with me, Mum. It's, ah, rather…rather urgent."
!" Draco was fierce and belligerent. He turned his entire torso, bearing down upon his companion. Harry's crushed hand was deftly transferred to Draco's free one; the arm wrapped 'round his shoulders shifted abruptly, drawing the whole of Harry tight up against a naked chest that heaved, incidentally compressing his one nostril with every other thud. "Shut up and listen!"
of yours, Draco! He's well out of bounds! Lamentable!"
"Wouldn't have offered it it were," Millie said smartly, making feet for the door. "Must beat the early rush, though. Cheers, Hars. Back in a tick."
"Oh, shut up!" Harry snarled. "Fine! I'll send a Patronus; see what she says, but don't blame
Harry shifts, resettling his feet, finding comfort in the sound of Garambeau’s gusting sigh, solace in Luna’s humming. They are three together, and there are multiples of three gathered, and no one is alone, nor would ever be allowed to be. Not here.
