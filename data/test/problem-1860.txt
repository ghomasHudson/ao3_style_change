As one the two of them rose and handed in their third paper each. With a slight nod to the other, they walked into separate booths for their third practical.
“I hear congratulations are in order,” Severus said with a grin as he stopped by The Pack’s section of the table. “This does not mean you can slack off, however.”
Tobias sighed. “I did have a break. Madam Greengrass made me lay down for fifteen minutes and have a cup of sweet tea and a scone while she checked me over.”
“Well, Mr Riddle, I must congratulate you on finally escaping the old man’s clutches – Even if it has taken you five long years to do so.”
Tobias calmed down under the soothing hands of his intended. Looking into Draco’s eyes, he nodded slightly at Sev, then towards his office. Draco nodded and escorted Sev into his office to administer a calming draught. Looking a Millicent and Pansy, he eyes flicked to the back of the room where Lavender was still strutting.
“We’d better go home too. I will talk to you tomorrow, Severus.” He nodded in Remus’ direction and left, Draco following him. Before he stepped into the flames, Draco looked at Severus and Remus.
The boys laughed and interrupted her. “Of course we want to have it here. We picked the night of the first because it is a new moon, so Remus can attend, and we’d like it to be in the moon flower garden.”
Without a word, Severus handed over seven rolls of parchment to the diminutive older man and turned to look at the last person in the group.
“He said that as long as it doesn’t kill me it is permissible, and then went on to say not to bother wasting food on me, just water me once a day. He also mentioned that if at any time any of them realised what a fine looking specimen I was and wanted it, they could have it with nothing to fear from either wizarding or muggle authorities, as I was going to die before I said anything.” He slowly brought his eyes down to lock his green eyes with Voldemort’s red ones.
Still in silence, Draco softly kissed Tobias’ forehead, eyelids and cheeks before he drew him into his arms and placed a gentle, teasing kiss to Tobias’ lips that made the raven-haired youth’s knees collapse. Holding him close, Draco nuzzled into his cheek.
Draco crept into the room and pounced on Tobias, kissing the breath from him. When he pulled back, he paled when he found himself face to face with a snake stunned in the middle of a strike. Tobias put the snake on the ground before nodding to Remus, who re-enervated it.
Severus and Draco exchanged semi-amused looks, but even they had to admit that the potion would make it worse. Leaving Tobias to sleep, Severus and Draco returned to the main school building, still slightly in shock. Realising the time, the two Slytherins split – Draco to go to the Slytherin commons, where he would need to inform The Pack as to what was going to happen, and Severus to go to Dumbledore’s office to tell him his ‘other master’ was calling.
Remus flinched. “Ouch. So basically Neogennito called Lucius a pathetic, brown-nosing psychosomatic parasitic idiot who surrounds himself with those stupider than him in an attempt at making himself seem intelligent while those who work with or for him have myxomycetal sludge for brains.”
“You wanted to ensure that you caught everyone at once,” the man on his left said with a half-smirk.
A man that he didn’t know approached him. “I believe that is a question to ask the Headmaster, since it is his job to report those matters.”
Remus stood and slowly made his way to  his slightly trembling mate, taking him in his arms. “You’ve been strong for so long due to me not doing my true duty to you,” he whispered into Severus’ black hair, “But that stops right now. I don’t know how I’ll do it, but I will prove to you that you don’t need to hide yourself from me – never from me.”
It had been during one of these meetings that their Lord had walked in carrying a letter. There was to be a marking ceremony set for the week before school started.
“And you want one of us to pretend to be him so that you can use him for a plan to ensure life for you and the Lord is easier.”
Severus and Lucius threw their heads back and roared with laughter. Tobias’ face fell and he sat, sighing. Thanatos appeared and sang softly, trying to relax his human. After he had settled onto his master’s shoulder Tobias indicated those around him to gather closer.
“Well, there are eight family titles that we hold between us Draco,” he said slowly. “I think it is time that we bring a few of them out of the shadows.”
“It would make it easier for the seventh ears to be done now rather than last since it is NEWT year for them,” Ariandra responded, “though I wonder why we didn’t do them first.”
Various voices from students in Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin made sounds of agreement at the statement.
“Because you are the only person in this entire country other than a Weasley that will piss Tobias off when he is this temperamental.”
“Shh, Harry. Shh. It’s all right. You’re safe here. You’re with me at Snape Manor.  You are in one of my guest rooms. You have nothing but your owl here, which is why you are not dressed under the covers.  I’m sorry, but I had to undress you to clean and tend to your wounds.  I healed what I could, but there is a lot I cannot heal without time and proper nutrition.  I can remover the bands ay your throat, wrists and ankles, but not until your body is well enough to handle the return of your magic, and not by myself.  Do you understand?”
Tom stood in Tobias’ doorway and watched him sleep. It had been nine nights since Tobias’ troubled nights had been bought up and the boy had spent every night since sleeping with the stuffed dragon and the shirt Draco had worn that day. Each day he wore the shirt from the night before as he worked in the library and on the work Severus had for him to do. He had finished that work three days before and since then had taken to teaching Lucius how to cook. So far he had managed to perfect mixed berry pancakes with strawberry yoghurt sauce and was on his way to being able to make a nice lightly spiced rice and chicken salad.
Tobias opened his eyes with a smirk only those beside him could see. “Showtime,” he muttered just as one of the other patrons of the café they were at ran back into the shop yelling about Death Eaters.
Tobias smiled sleepily as Draco carried him to their bedroom. They’d had a wonderful bath with a very tender love session half-way through, which Tobias knew he’d have trouble forgetting. He jumped slightly when Draco placed him on the bed.
Tobias bowed slightly. “Yes, Gran’mere Rowan. I am the only heir of all four of you. My mother was descended from Gran’ther Godric and Gran’ther Sal. My father from yourself and Gran’mere Helga. There is only one other heir at the moment, and he is my adopted father, Tom Riddle. Both my parents were killed when it was discovered they were spies of the dark.”
An unknown goblin walked into the room with a large covered tray that he placed on the desk between the three of them.
Those years nodded. Tobias addressed the seventh years. “You will be given different bribes and threats – mainly in regards to your N.E.W.Ts. DO NOT BE SWAYED BY HIM! Remember that Slytherins look out for their own. He will want you to spy on me, find out who my father is and whom I’m closest to in the house. Answer with a sneer and ask him if you look like you pay any attention to his golden boy. Make it seem as if you believe me being in this house is a plot of his to get someone brave enough – or stupid enough – to spy on the snake’s pit.”
After Draco left, he practically ran back to his desk, a grin on his face. Just wait until his Lord, Remus, Lucius and Narcissa hear about this!
Harry laughed, bowed slightly and walked to his room to shower, leaving behind a smiling Draco and a grinning, spying Severus.
If anyone in the common room noticed the single crystal tear making its way down his cheek, they didn’t say anything as they surrounded their Lord and his mate.
Amelia smiled when she stepped into the room holding the last two students to examine.  She had purposefully left these two for last because not only were they the reason for this occurring but the other members of the council had requested to be present for the last one.
“Sally-Ann,” she corrected with a small smile of amusement. She had given the bonded couple permission to call her by her first name an few weeks previous and the blonde teen was still struggling with it.
Vincent looked up at the blonde girl, hazel eyes littering intelligently. “Allow me to take you to your seat my Lady,” he said in a soft voice.
“I’m sure he will be delighted to hear that,” Grapplefang replied snugly, watching with pride for a member of his clan as the young man sipped at a milk-like drink and moaned softly in appreciation. “You said you have a business proposition for Gringotts? What does it entail?”
He sighed softly. He knew that there was nearly three weeks till their bonding and that for two of them, he and Tobias wouldn’t be allowed to touch, speak or see the other. He was worried because neither of them had slept alone since the night they were announced to the Death Eaters. He would be staying at Prince Manor with Severus, while Tobias stayed at Riddle Manor with his father.
“Normally when someone scowls at you constantly you feel as though they think you are a waste of space,” Tobias drawled in a how-stupid-are-you tone.
Minister Fudge looked on with some confusion. Severus sighed. “Just what we need. First thing today was hormones and now he has morning sickness.” He shook his head, “at least I can make a potion for the morning sickness … I think.”
Draco silently counted to three before Pansy and Ginny squealed in delight. “We’re going to have a Neogennito in The Pack!”
“Luna is Pack,” Draco stated with a shrug as though that explained everything. “She is just as important to us as we are to her,” He frowned thoughtfully. “Is it only your blood that she needs or can others donate theirs to her in case she needs it fast?”
“It’s only been four days and he’s already cleaned all the sitting rooms, re-organised the kitchens, scared the house-elves out of the kitchen on a morning, cleaned and organised his rooms, made the chambers I use for torture into a playroom for the Death Eaters and has scared me out of my office while cleaning, organising and completing MY paperwork!”
“I’m here to check up on how the young ones are,” Minerva said softly, knowing how protective the man was of his godson. “Not that I don’t trust you to look after them,” she continued hurriedly, “I just want to know for my own peace of mind.”
Tobias looked at his father with a small smile. “Yeah, sorry about that – but the poor excuse of a potions ingredient was trying to kill me.” A smirk lit his features, as did something no one had seen for a long time – a mischievous twinkle in his green eyes. “And there was also this smug Slytherin that came out of a diary that was attempting to killing my adopted sister as well, urging the damn thing on.”
“Now, if the sweet were to be chewed, rather than sucked,” Tobias nodded at Neville and watched as he put it into his mouth and started chewing, “The person can walk through a house fire and still be cold.” He turned his attention back to Neville, who was completely blue with purple lips. His teeth were chattering that hard that it was surprising he didn’t chip them.
“Can you make me an appointment to see Voldemort, please? I want to talk to him about something that has come to my attention. It concerns you too, Sir.” Severus nodded once and walked out the door, hearing one last word before the boy fell asleep.
“Nothing really,” he grinned at them, pulling out a sheet of parchment and quill. “So who is doing what?” As his Pack playfully argued over who was doing what, Tobias found himself thinking that he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“That day last week I was beyond furious. Thanatos tried his hardest to calm me down, but when that didn’t work; the wolf guardian in me took charge and calmed me down with a hunt.” Remus laughed. What better way to calm down an enraged wolf then for it to hunt? Tobias continued, sending Remus a look saying that he understood what he was laughing at. “Today’s guardian thinks I’m a sweet kit, even if I do grumble about her mothering me.”
“You don’t have to give up sex yet, Bi,” Draco said softly as he carried the unresisting teen to their room. “Algernon only mentioned that it could be a possibility later in the pregnancy.”
“I will also catch up with you,” Pansy said. “I’m going to check up on Professor Snape. He might have some things he wants investigated as well.”
“We already know this Draco. We want to know why you will be going there instead of staying here!” Sev growled.
None of them looked back as they were portkeyed into Hogsmeade. As Draco guided a green-faced Tobias to the nearest seat, Blaise made his way to the local Owl office to send an important letter to The Lord, knowing as he did so that there was a strong chance that he would be disowned and not caring if he was. His was a higher purpose than the Zabini clan now-days.
He opened his eyes and watched as Draco slipped out of his cloths and entered the water, also moaning in delight as the warmth hit his chilled flesh. For a few minutes they stayed locked in their own little worlds, but once the fiery sensation left their bodies, Tobias made his way slowly towards his unsuspecting husband.
Both redheads watched the woman go in amusement before separating; One to the inventing area of the shop and the other to their above-shop apartment.
The residents of Hogsmeade smiled as they watched the large group walk through the street. Every now and then a few members of the group would split off and enter a store before re-joining the group and splitting the purchases between them all. As the day progressed, they witnessed them sitting together around a large feast and eating in a comfortable silence many would have argued against teenagers of any age possessing.
This made all of the men smile. Sev stood and hugged the youth. Reaching into his pocket, he removed and enlarged a small package. “From Draco,” he whispered.
“Remember, we aren’t expected to have the worksheets completed,” Draco stated as he watched Tobias closely. “I think as long as the Professors see that we made an attempt, that they will be happy.”
“Do you, Severus Tobias Snape, give your consent to me – Remus John Lupin – to court you by way of the moon’s children?”
Severus smirked. “I will enquire of your Father as to which house-elf you are permitted to take. What will you do about a Healer?”
“I don’t know,” Draco sighed before growling at himself in frustration. “Tobias is not acting like himself and while I get that it is due to his pregnancy, I don’t understand WHY he has changed so much and when I asked his Healer about it he answered but with so many terms and words I don’t know or understand that I feel more confused than before!” By the time he had finished, Draco was panting slightly and as he slowly calmed himself, he became aware of the soft chuckles coming from the portrait. He scowled at the painted man who raised both arms in surrender.
Even though the kiss was innocent, there was not one person in the Hall who didn’t understand its meaning. MINE. Slowly noise started to refill the Hall. Tobias kept a blank mask on for the rest of the meal, only indicating that he’ll speak to everyone later in the Snake Pit. They nodded their understanding and finished their meal in silence.
Draco smirked. “Good luck while you’re there. Just think: you’ll be having sooooo much fun you’ll forget all about us.”
Tom, Lucius and Remus exchanged looks of amusement and shock as they looked at the package that Thanatos had just delivered to them. In the centre of the triangle the three men made was a red headed male with blank eyes wearing a pale yellow and grey ball gown, lilac choker, silver bracelets and a ring made of mother of pearl. On his feet were a pair of sparkling pink stilettoes and, taped over his mouth, was a scrap of parchment.
Draco smirked. “There are a lot of things that we can do without actual penetration. I would have thought that you would know that by now, seeing you are in a relationship with our Potions Professor. If not then …”
Following this came a scene that no one had ever thought they’d see, even if they lived for a thousand years. Tom Riddle – the darkest Dark Lord of the century – had told his son-in-law to call him either Tom, or Pateras but just leave out the bloody Lord, before sitting on the ground before the tree and handing everyone their presents.
Dedicated to: My Luc! She knows who she is. Love you sis, Happy Birthday and don’t think that because I finally got this posted that you can get rid of the hand-written copy I made for you. I went through nearly eight copies before I got one I was happy with!
Tom chuckled. “Yes Gios. There is going to be a difference, however. These five are not going to be obtaining my mark – they will bare yours, and you will be the one marking them. Do you know what your mark is going to be?”
“I wouldn’t miss it for the world – Now, help me wake Sleeping Beauty there so he can have something else to eat and drink before you leave for the Mansion. I’ll organise for everyone else to get there an hour before the meeting starts.”
Searching for the official, she paused when something caught her eye. She moved towards it and blinked. There on three cots slept six members of The Pack. In the centre cot was her charge and his husband. To their immediate right lay Greg and Vince. To their immediate left lay Neville and Millicent. At the foot of the cot holding her patient lay a dark brown wolf with a caramel snout, saddle, tail and right forepaw. At the head of the same cot lay a petite pale tan wolf with large blue eyes and a black stripe from the tip of its muzzle to the tip of its tail.
“Due to the person I am to bond with,” George said. “While the Patil family is one of the most respected in both the British and Indian magical communities, Pavarti is NOT respected in the least. Since her first year at Hogwarts, she has kept company with one Lavender Brown – who has earned herself the title of Hogwarts Goodtime Girl with the reputation of being a gossip hound with not enough brain cells to rub together. While the first part of Lavender’s reputation has skipped Pavarti, the second part has not. Instead of focusing on lessons, she looks through magazines or talks about boys. If a member of the opposite sex is not rich, famous or ‘cute’,” George grimaced at the word, “they are worthless in her eyes. Her results have decreased until she is only just passing because instead of doing any of it, she spends her time doing Lavender’s hair, nails or make up while listening to her compare the however many males she was with the previous evening.”
Ginny and Gregory had birthed only the one cub that, to the regret of many, formed a close bond with his identical twin uncles and kept all his adopted family on their toes with his pranks and rambunctious attitude.
“So Ickle WonWon couldn’t handle Kyria’s ability,” Fred stated as he poked the blank-eyed shell of his former younger brother.
“And if I miss my guess,” Draco drawled scarily like his father, “Then it isn’t even signed by the Minister or Madam Bones.”
Severus sighed. “Harry doesn’t believe he got that mark for true – which I doubt he did. Not that I don’t think he couldn’t have gotten it, but at that stage in his year, it was surprising he even managed to do as well as he did. I saw what he really got, and it was a high Acceptable. He only missed out on an Exceed Expectation by a half percent, if I remember rightly. I’m going to prove to him that he can be one of the best in my subject if he puts his mind to it.”
Severus stepped out of the floo and into his sitting room, where he collapsed with his head in his hands.
Tobias frowned down at the papers before him. Minerva had been right once again; he had felt better after having an hour’s nap and the wonderfully fragrant tea he had consumed with her, Draco, Severus and Ginny had been refreshing. He lowered the papers with a sigh and rubbed his temples.
Amelia cleared her throat in an attempt to not laugh, knowing by the look on the goblin’s face that he knew the words were an insult to wizards and witches, not to Gringotts itself.
She glanced to the blonde on her left and placed a hand on his shoulder, jolting him from his thoughts.
Tobias looked at her in confusion for a moment. “Excuse me, my mother?” When the Goddess nodded, he continued. “We were told that we would bathe before eating. May I ask why it has been reverse?”
“I did get if Father,” Pavarti said, not being able to lie to the head of the family. “I just … didn’t read it all the way through.” She said the last bit quietly and looked away from the stone-faced man.
Tobias awoke the next morning before the sun rose. He lay in his bed, thinking about the previous night and chuckled softly. The only people – well, those who didn’t follow the light - who had been surprised at his and Draco’s subsequent bonding had been him and Draco. He had a slight suspicion that the adults in their lives had been scheming about them. It was in their self-satisfied smirks.
Hermione pulled her wand up and aimed it at Tobias’ retreating back, shouting, “Trarre attacco di sangue.”
“No. It serves them right. Lucius most of all since he is the only married man of the group: You should have seen some of the things Narcissa put him through when she was pregnant with Draco.”
“Do you mind an extra mouth or two?” Minerva asked. “It would be lovely to go to the village and not need to supervise.”
Both Severus and Tobias were shocked. Neville was the only being other than themselves that knew what each of the four ‘sweets’ did – and he was volunteering to eat them? Tobias looked deep into his second’s eyes and realised this was a silent apology to both him and Draco – a way of punishing himself with shame and embarrassment. Tobias nodded and handed the bags to Severus, who had moved to his side during his inspection.
“May I do the theory section of the exam after supper? I didn’t mean to be away for so long.” He turned to Draco. “I’m sorry, Drakontas. Maybe we can have afternoon tea and a chat some other time. It just can’t be during the last two weeks of the holidays as I’ve been told I’m to go to the Weasel’s Den then – like a dutiful Gryffindor.”
“At first, I think the findings will be few and far between,” Tobias admitted. “The rooms that will be first are unused rooms in the dungeons before moving through to the top. We do have an advantage though.”
“Yes, Bi. I know that Dumbledore is a goat fucker, and I know we had plans, but I’m comfortable right here, so how about we spend tonight like this and go out tomorrow night instead?”
“I know,” Severus responded, exhaling heavily. “It’s just … I was so hurt by what had occurred that for the first time in over twenty years, I signed my name at the end of a letter instead of my usual sign-off. What if he took it as me not wanting to be with him anymore? What if,” Severus started to hyperventilate, “What if he’s called off the engagement?”
Before letting him go to wait for him in the Snake Pit, Tobias nuzzled into Draco’s neck and as Draco’s eyes closed, he placed something into his loose fist. When he opened his eyes, Draco was alone and holding the steam of the most perfect flower he’d ever seen – A black rose with white-rimmed petals. Draco followed his betrothed from the room several moments later, the rose sitting in a vase of pure crystal beside his bed.
Now all he had to do was wait. He would no longer have a spy in Voldemort’s ranks, but it would be worth it if he could get that blasted pain-in-the-arse child back under his control. Laughing to himself, he popped another sherbet lemon into his mouth, not paying any attention to the horror-stricken and sickened faced of the Headmaster portraits around him. It wasn’t as if they could do anything about it.
Theodore told The Pack straight out that he was asexual when questions started flying around about him bonding. To his amusement, no one reacted in the way he thought they would and within a few hours they had informed him that he was now married to his job.
Bill, Charlie and the twins turned to Neville. “Tell Alpha that we are sorry we missed him, but we had to go back to work before we were missed..”
Augusta looked at her grandson in confusion. Smirking, Neville explained about the things Tobias did to Bellatrix. Her laughter echoed in the empty halls.
“And as a treat for you, the other laws against Centaurs were recently passed,” Lucius said enthusiastically, “as such, you will be the first to suff …” he coughed politely into his hand, ‘forgive me. You will be the first to … benefit … from them. Isn’t that just grand?”
“We do. You Father came to wake you and he came out pale and shaking,” Severus explained. “We thought that something bad had happened so we came to see what we could do. However, it seems that all that was wrong was your sheets had slipped and he saw a slight bit too much for his own mental health.”
Neville smirked and held out his hand like he was going to shake someone’s hand and laughed when Ron startled as another misty hand appeared before him.
Amelia sighed in exasperation as she turned away yet another student who wanted to be excused from the medical check-up. She looked up when a throat was softly cleared close to her.
“Over the years there were some teachers who would ask their top students if they would mind volunteering a little f their time to tutor some of the younger students, but once more, it got cancelled by the new Headmaster. He put in new desks which separated the students from each other, so it was uncomfortable for them to work together to improve themselves. Then he started cancelling the school maps and subject guide books and eventually he stopped supplying new resources to the library so even though there are new magics being created every day around the world, we – the staff – cannot teach it to the students because we have no information on them.”
“I’ll do that Severus, Thank you. I’ll go see her after I finish here. You’d best get a decent night’s sleep – it’s going to be a long few days. We got word that the investigators will be here in only a few short days.”
Fudge nodded. “I will ensure that it is so. There is a bill going through at the moment to make Veritaserum usage in trials a necessity. Only those who are pregnant, allergic to one of its components or under the age of 17 will not have to take it – however the strongest truth spells will be used in those cases.”
Draco looked at his intended, eyes of molten silver gleaming like mercury locked onto deep emerald pools. “Yes,” he whispered.
She had been surprised when Lucius asked if she minded having a meeting with him, his son and his son-in-law after the evening meal the night before, but she was happy she had accepted.
“And the good thing about having Dobby speak properly is that I don’t look like an idiot trying to prove that he is smart by surrounding himself with people stupider than he is.” With a slight bow to his Father and godparents and a nod at Neville, Tobias left the room.
“Headmaster. I’d like permission to make some changes to the library,” Madam Pince asked. “I’d like some more individual work spaces around the outer edge of the space and I’d like a few group tables in the centre of study groups. I’d also like permission to re-organise the shelving.”
Draco smirked slightly and manoeuvred himself until he felt the head of this dick press against Tobias’ entrance. ‘Thank Merlin I remembered to add the relaxant Sev gave me,” he thought as he slowly pushed into the tight heat above him. ‘Oh Merlin, he’s tight!’
With a small gulp of what could have been nerves or a dry throat, but was more likely fear, Algernon flicked his wand and muttered a spell. The tension rose and thickened when only a few inches vanished.
“TOBIAS REGULAS BLACK! YOU WILL COME HERE IMMEDIETLY!” Remus growled from the front doors of Hogwarts when the Slytherins arrived for breakfast. Tobias sighed.
Ron glared at the two Slytherins that just ran into the potions lab. Everything was their fault. He would have been better off if he had never met that small dark-haired boy who he’d been assured was easily manipulated.
Watching the show his Pet was putting on, Harry couldn’t resist the urge to stoke himself. Instead of removing the robe, Harry opened it only just enough for him to pull out his thick, pre-cum drenched cock and the large, heavy testicles under it. He smirked as his Pet’s eyes opened, only for him to dance harder as his pale grey eyes focused on Harry’s hands slow progression up and down his shaft.
Theodore cleared his throat. “The Hufflepuff lower years are becoming friendlier towards the Slytherin youngsters. Several of the older students are beginning to thaw towards us as a whole. I have to admit that it is easier without Draco around.” Draco pouted slightly, causing Tobias to chuckle.
“Alpha is going to kill them,” Luna whispered. “They signed their own death warrant. How are we going to keep him calm after he finds out?”
Pansy and Blaise locked eyes. They had been bought up knowing about betrothal contracts and how they affect those who sign it. If the two who are betrothed have strong feelings towards each other, then a strong emotional tie develops between the two. If they didn’t have the emotions there but they still went through with it, then they would still get the tie, but it would develop much slower and be much weaker.
“No offence.” Lee wheezed at Luna when he managed to catch his breath from laughing. “But I don’t think this will happen.”
Ron, however, turned back to them excitedly, clearly not having just called their friend for the sake of it.
He returned looking conspiratorial as he pulled another wand out of its box and handed it to Hal reverently.
At any rate, Fred seemed to love the Lego. Mr Weasley certainly was showing a lot of interest, and when Hal said he and his cousin had loads of those, his eyes were positively sparkling with enthusiasm.
The trial had already been going on for two days, it being centred not just on Lockhart’s attack at the end of the previous school year, but on the decade of fraud it had uncovered, and most witnesses had been heard already. Draco and Hal, though, were considered key witnesses in that, so far, all that Lockhart had done could possible be considered a minor offence, from an eager author who had taken things a little too far, had gotten carried away and had started confusing reality and fiction. It demanded some restitution, sure, but not a heavy sentence. Attacking two students who were technically in his care as a Professor, however, was on a whole different level, and the backlash there would be much harder to evade.
Snape waited until the classroom was cleared to come and stand in front of Hal, who looked up in what he hoped was respectful expectancy. He predicted a lecture, inquisition as to why he thought it was acceptable for him to not pay attention, ten points from Gryffindor and at least an essay to write, possibly detention.
“Actually, he isn’t.” She replied. “The hospital’s policy is very strict as to who they allow in as visitors for what they consider at-risk or vulnerable children. He is going there to answer the Muggle DMLE’s questions about the abduction.”
“Yes.” Dumbledore didn’t bother denying. “You know the prophecy, Severus. You know the part Harry will have to play in defeating the dark side – this time for good.”
As they stepped onto the carriage, Draco spotted the Weasleys – a small hurricane of noise, laughter, chaos and red hair. They always gave him a feeling of bewilderment, and maybe something like envy. The close-knit relationship between siblings was something Draco would never know or have. He day-dreamed about what it would be like to be a twin, sometimes, like Fred and George.
Hal nodded vaguely. He had spoken to the ghost a few times, he was friendly with all the Gryffindors, but there was still something very awkward about it.
.” The door opened with a click and Anthony beamed like he hadn’t actually expected it to work. “Neat!”
She sighed. “On a foot.” She gave him a considering look. “I always end up telling you things when you care like this. Maybe that’s why people think we are siblings sometimes.”
She was looking at that tin now, back down from the loft, sitting on her bed. She had opened it once before, when the bundle that was Harry had shown up on their doorstep, to recover the bank details she remembered James had mentioned. It had been her main argument against Vernon to justify raising her sister’s son – sentiment would not have swayed him, but money definitely could. The Potters had set it all up so that they would essentially be paid monthly child support from the account after confirming Petunia accepted to be his legal guardian.
“Unbelievable.” One of the twins repeated. “The bugger has never played Quidditch in his life, he goes and does a successful Wronski Feint.”
They had gone through the door to a small room, at the centre of which stood a table covered in vials, and a roll of parchment. Hermione had taken it upon herself to solve the riddle, and she had gotten distracted thinking it was just another ‘challenge’ that was conspicuously suited to Hal and his friends’ knowledge and abilities.
He stopped, feeling a little embarrassed at just how much he’d just revealed. But Harry just carried on looking at him like every word he said was relevant, and worth storing away.
their favourite cake – which Ron told him changed every year, and obviously they claimed it was never the same between them.
, in Draco’s opinion), as the Flint’s eyes glossed over their little group, unfocused… and unfortunately snapped right back on him. To Draco’s surprise, however, he didn’t say anything, he just grinned, as if the whole thing was surprisingly amusing, and went to sit with his own friends like it was all completely normal.
Severus had suspected Quirrell would go after the stone, he hadn’t exactly been subtle all year, and it had been a tricky game to play, dealing with this blubbering idiot while being keenly aware that every word he said came back to the Dark Lord’s ears. He had to maintain his cover, do his part as a double agent, while stalling the man. Albus had only given him two instructions: keep an eye on the Potter boy, and don’t let Quirinus get his hands on the stone.
They had also found some powder residue of a Sleeping Draught – instant and highly potent in that formulation, and therefore dangerous and under tightly restricted use – which she must have used on Hal.
“What? Me what?” Hal immediately got flustered, which of course got Sirius to cast him a knowing look.
“Oh they haven’t driven me from the dorms Skoteinos,” Ginny said with a soft smile. “If that were the case, I would have come to you and had you escort me to Professor McGonagall. Luna is the one who has been kicked out of her house and since the girls in my dorm refuse to allow her into ours, I’m going to be moving into the Room of Requirement with her until she finds a new place to sleep at night.”
“You have to understand,” Fred continued with a nod of thanks at his brother, “that we have contracts with a few people and businesses which we are magically bound to silence.”
Tobias made his way into the crowded potions corridor. He knew the potions master had a class and that his spare lesson would be either a tutorial, potions making or inventory calculation. He hoped that whatever it was, that he’d be able to get a few words with Severus away from prying eyes.
“Yes, but that was many many decades ago, the man replied haughtily before joining in with the soft laughter coming from his two companions.
Neville nodded and ate the sweet, clenching his eyes shut as he felt it work. Silence ruled before the Weasley twins roared with laughter – as did Lucius, to everyone’s greatest shock.
“Tobias,” he said with forced calm, “Minerva isn’t going to harm them and you can’t keep doing that. You need to rest to recover from their morning.”
More than half of the students were exceedingly happy that the black-haired teen had been asleep when the twins revealed what the vile woman had planned on doing and those who weren’t were entertaining themselves with imagining what the pregnant teen would have done to her.
“That about sums it up yes,” Algernon said. “Now, other cravings may form. These are things like a particular sound, feel, smell or environment. There may also be times where he craves company and times he craves solitude. If he has a solitary moment, the only person who will be able to get close to him without him blowing up is Draco. I also suggest watching him for feline and canine traits as the pregnancy progresses – and I think we should get the two of them to school before that progresses too far.”
“Dobby, remove the glamour around the one holding my daughter,” he whispered softly. It wasn’t a potion being used, nor was the person a metamorphmagus. He knew this because there was only one metamorphmagus in the UK and she had been warned away from him when it came to light that it was her who had allowed the headmaster to escape and a person’s true eye colour would not reveal itself through a potion.
Tobias smiled and hugged the blonde youth. “It is my first courting gift to you Drakontas. I know we are betrothed – and by contract no less – but I wish to woo you as if the contract had never been created.” Keeping his eyes locked on his Dragon’s mercury ones, he placed a gentle, chaste kiss on the back of his fingers.
“Us three have half of DADA to go and Potions,” Greg informed them, indicating Vince and Millicent as well as himself.
Grapplefang nodded and handed the paperwork – a contract – to the young man, who handed it straight to Amelia.”
Draco visibly melted at Tobias’ whispered apology and allowed him to snuggle slightly into his chest before pushing him away slightly with a regretful look in his eyes. “I need to change, Love. You can have me back when I am presentable,” he said in reply to Tobias’ pout.
“Alpha is sleeping – or he was before Epikindynos and Pontikos left. Beta is making sure he is okay and Professor Snape still believes that you are going to call off the engagement, but have plans to do it face-to-face rather than through a letter,” Luna stated loud enough for the adults to hear.
“Understood,” the three chorused, moving forward as one body – something that came from long hours of training together.
Zog stretched and his mottled green and brown wings spread out behind him with a soft crackling of muscle and tendon. “The bond mark changes for the both of them. During the day, they have my claws. During the night, they have Booph’s. Our claws are there because we are the protectors - I’m on duty during the day and Booph on duty at night.
“We are hoping to get through the staff and the first years before lunch. I recommend remaining in your house common room, your dormitory, the library or the Quidditch Pitch. If there’s a place you know you will be for a long period of time, please tell one of us so we will know where to send a patronus to fetch you when it is your turn. We will begin as soon as breakfast is complete.”
‘My chance of becoming one of the best lawyers in the magical world has become better since I signed,’ she thought as she looked around the close knit group. ‘Without these people I would have seen only half the picture, never realising that there is a difference between dark and evil and never knowing that light doesn’t necessarily mean that they are good.’
“You do that,” Blaise said from his position on the other side of Draco with an odd gleam in his eye, “It’s funny watching Lucius squawk like a peacock every time Draco looks at you.”
Severus waited until Ronald Weasley had processed what he had seen and heard and had raised his wand in retaliation [a solid ten minutes after the fact mind you] before slamming the door closed and stalking to his usual position.
Sitting down, Tobias opened the package to find a small green and grey stuffed toy dragon. He hugged it close and smelt sandalwood and cinnamon. Squeezing it tighter, he heard a click and a soft voice started talking to him.
Severus looked up suddenly, making Amelia jolt slightly in her seat. He smiled genuinely, eyes misted with remembrance.
Soon the entire castle was empty, allowing for a soft girlish squeal of excited delight to echo in its halls.
Severus slumped into his seat once the last student left. The sight that had greeted him when he went to collect the troublemakers had shaken him more than he thought possible. He knew that punishment had been created for use on him over his house-elves – he just hadn’t truly believed the boy would dare use it.
“Do you think he knows how much stuff of his life he put in there?” Severus asked him, not answering the question.
“Ah, Miss Umbitch – sorry – Umbridge. I see you have recovered from your time with the centaurs. They do know how to celebrate, don’t they?” Tobias stretched lazily. “How are things going in your campaign against half-breeds? Pity about the Vampire Laws not going through, I mean, how could they not see that they are dark creatures because they need blood to survive? How could they also not see that creating blood banks where they can go to get blood taken cleanly so that no one is killed will make them more dangerous as they will attack more humans?”
Before him, sliding slowly down the pole, was a young man the same age as Harry, but where Harry was black haired, tanned and with a physique that was suited more for a beater than the seeker he had been in school, this new man was platinum blonde, porcelain-skinned and slender enough to still be mistaken for the seventeen year old seeker he had been in school.
The next morning the students and teachers of Hogwarts were greeted by the sight of an exhausted Tobias and Draco. Severus smirked knowingly at the two of them causing them to flush slightly. Breakfast was going smoothly until the doors of the Great Hall opened to reveal two hard-faced Aurors.
“Of course I do,” George croaked, “but I have to fulfil it. I can’t lose the shop Bi.” He looked up with tortured blue eyes, “And I can allow the Patil family to lose their seat, money and their reputation by having them break the contract.”
“I feel bad for the centaurs now,” George responded, “Remind me to apologise to every centaur we see for the next year. We did them a great disservice when we turned her into one of their number.”
Fred, with the assurance of having done this over a million times before, pointed his wand at George and performed the spell so fast and smooth that it was almost missed by the others in the room.
Ron sat on his bed and fumed. Not only had he had to put up with his ex-best friend for the past three months, but the girl he wanted to marry refused to see him over the holidays. It’s a pity that the Headmaster wouldn’t let him use the potion on her yet. He had to wait for after graduation to administer it to her. Oh well, he’d get her in the end he just wanted her NOW!
“Yes, Drakontas. I’m just not impressed with who you are partnered with,” he sighed. “At least she is better than Granger or Weasley – but if she touches you in any way, I’ll feed her to Hagrid’s newest obsession.”
Once their hands were in front of them, Minerva picked up the ribbons and tenderly tied them around the clasped hands of the boys in front of her. Silently she tapped her wand on their hands, binding them together. No one expected what happened next.
“That was until Ginny stepped in. She got them to leave him alone long enough to spend three hours a day without them so he could talk to us. It was brilliant!”
“Okay everyone!” Minister Fudge said, walking into the room full of O.W.L students. “We have to start soon, so please follow me.” Everyone stood and followed him deeper into the building.
“It was a load of crock!” He looked at Voldemort. “You did the old fucker’s work for him, in killing my parents. He wanted the two of them dead, so he planted everything.” Harry took a deep breath. “He then sent me off to bed and arranged a meeting with Ron and Hermione.  He told them both that I was unsafe to be around people – magical and otherwise – without some kind of control device, so they helped him create the manacles I was wearing at throat, wrist and ankle.  He then had Pomfrey douse me with Dreamless Sleep and put them on me while I was under.”
Tobias walked back to his table to speak to Neville, before indicating for Blaise to walk around casting the stasis spell on the unfinished work. To everyone’s surprise Neville was the first to hand in a sample, followed closely by Hermione. He dismissed the class before taking samples and cleaning Lavender and Draco’s work area, while waiting for his pack to return.
“Headache cure,” Lucius said with an understanding smile. “Medium strength. I know I’ve had one already today and Wu has had three. Of all of us here, you are the only one who hasn’t had at least one of these since we started. We were starting to believe you weren’t human for a while there.”
Harry stifled a sobbing laugh. “That has to be the only good thing about it. I’d better let you sleep. You must be exhausted.”
“He started killing aimlessly – men, women, children, muggle, magical … none of it mattered. Then came the day a prophecy was made to Albus Dumbledore in my hearing. It concerned the Dark Lord so I ran and told him what I had heard. When I discovered he was targeting Lily, I went straight to Albus begging him for their protection. He agreed on one condition – I was to spy for him. I agreed and so began my life on the side of light.”
Draco looked at his husband and smiled before looking back at her. “It makes Bi happy and a happy Bi means there is less chance for a change in his emotions, but if you want a pissed off, hormonal Tobias ...”
“It means that we have all the time in the world to explore each other until we know each other by touch,” he stopped and ran his fingers through the silken platinum hair and down his husband’s cheek. “Sight,” he gazed lovingly at the face before him. “Sound,” he breathed into Draco’s ear softly, eliciting a soft moan of desire from the blonde. “Smell,” he lent forward and took a deep lungful of Draco-scented air, releasing a soft whimper. “And lastly,” he quickly flicked his tongue out and ran it along the outer rim of Draco’s ear. “Taste.”
A sound drew him from his thoughts. Smirking, he silently glided over to were a particular redhead was to be found with his tongue down the throat of a girl.
Nodding decisively, Hermione snapped the book shut and walked from the Hall, searching for an empty room in which to practice. No one would care about what happened to the so-called Saviour anyway, he was a Slytherin after all.
“Thank you, and it’s Mr Malfoy-Jones, not Potter.” Tobias stood and made his way to where his husband was to watch the rest of the proceedings.
“Epikindynos, your parchment is the only one with nothing on it at this point in time. This doesn’t mean you have nothing to do. You can still aid anyone else in their duties and once Alpha agrees to it, you and I hand he will be starting on that job he wanted done – but I think that will now be left until after the cub is born.”
Draco smiled his reply and bowed to the god before him. “Thank you My Father, I will take your words to heart.” He turned his eyes to the Willow and strode confidently towards it, thereby missing the look of pride in the god’s eye.
“Do you think Fred and George will mind if I borrowed one of their owls?” Luna asked Ginny as she slid into the seat beside the red-head. “Daddy said in his last letter that Heron is grounded for a few months. She was showing signs of clutching again.”
“Cotton candy kittens,” he said, not quite hiding his distaste for the words that were falling from his lips.
“HOW DARE YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO SEV!” Tobias’ voice shouted, magnified by four hundred percent. “DID ANY OF YOU STOP TO THINK I OVER REACTED DUE TO HORMONES? YOU CAN’T KEEP STEPPING IN WHEN THIS HAPPENES. I EXPECT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO MAKE IT UP TO HIM BY THE END OF THIS WEEK OR I’LL MAKE ALL OF YOUR LIVES HELL!”
Algernon looked to the bed and chuckled as Bill and Charlie dragged the woman from the room to hand her over to the Aurors that Narcissa had just fire called. He had been worried that his Little Lord would start freaking out at hearing what the woman said, but he hadn’t thought to keep the Malfoy Heir in mind.
“Yes, Luc. He just admitted that he was a bottom – the subservient partner.” Severus glared at Narcissa. “Are you quite happy now, ‘Cissa? We now know more about your son’s soon-to-be-rampant sex life, which I, for one, didn’t need to know about.” Severus stormed out after his too-awake godson, his robes snapping with tension while an amused Lucius and a subdued Narcissa followed him.
Harry shuddered. “How about you throw me in a cage with a basilisk and Acromentula hatchlings instead, it will be more fun, and probably safer.”
The next day no one saw hide or hair of Tobias. Draco awoke to find a letter and a small chocolate love heart on the pillow next to his head – as well as a new bathrobe with a Dragon in Slytherin colours stitched onto the back of it.
Tom nodded in acceptance. “I’m going to go talk to Fudge about getting The Pack to sit their N.E.W.Ts. I am also going to head off any snooping the old Fool will most assuredly do when my son re-joins the world.” He smirked. “Let’s see him try and get rid of THIS child before anyone but the parents know of it.”
Once Ginny heard her name come up, she grabbed her chance and jumped into his sentence, her hands on her hips and scowling at her brother.  “As if you don’t know what him and I want to do together without you two in the room. It has been you, Ron, who has been trying to push us together since your forth year, isn’t it? How do you think we would get to be in a relationship like that if we don’t know anything about the other?” She turned her scowl onto Hermione. “I expected my brother to be this stupid, but you Hermione? If I were you, then I’d stop fucking him every night if his stupidity is spread that way.”
He put his head back in his arms, though he looked up again when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Lupin was leaning over him, looking kind, but serious.
“Hemy.” Pan interrupted, surprising everyone with the nickname. “This is us. Do you really have to ask?”
Hal shot Justin a despairing look, and they actually had a bonding moment as the other boy answered with an eye roll and they both tried not to laugh.
“Aye Lass,” he replied with sparkling eyes. “I found someone who believed my word and oath over that brown-nosing paper-shuffler.”
At his father’s nod of permission, the newly named boy disappeared in a blue flame. One of the Slytherins whimpered.
When the owl had left their sight, Ginny gave the letter to Luna. As she read, Luna’s mind started to work double-time with what she could do to the weasel the next time she saw him. She smiled dreamily as she handed the letter back to its recipient – she could hardly wait.
Laughing at the meetings ending, the Slytherin’s left for their beds. Before separating to find their own beds, both Tobias and Draco hugged the amused men that were still in the room. As they walked away, talking about why Tobias wanted Draco to be the main focus of Dumbledore’s keep-control-of-Potter campaign, both men watched them.
Tom sighed and rubbed his face. “It is that important. Madam Longbottom discovered who is going to be involved in the investigation. One is Lucius, several of the others are neutrals but there are two people I am worried about – one more than the other. The lesser danger is Madam Greengrass. I still have a degree of control over her – as does Lucius. The main problem is the last person on the team. Lucius assured me he did his absolute best to prevent it, but it didn’t work.”
“Then we shall all meet with the Goblins at the pre-arranged time the day after the medical checks are complete to discuss this mess,” Amelia said tiredly. “The only thing we don’t know is how to get the twins here at the right time. We still have a quarter of the seventh years to get through.”
To everyone’s surprise, Tobias rose from his seat and moved until he could gather the young woman in his arms. “You were the Jewel of Ravenclaw Kyria – one of the few that Rowena herself would have chosen to personally train had you attended when she was alive,” he stated as he softly nuzzled the top of her head with his nose and cheek. “Do not feel ashamed or upset by the deplorable behaviour of the jealous.”
“Neogennito. It has been requested that in a quarter mark of the candle for you and young Mister Malfoy to join us in the family room. That is also when everyone else – bare the Weasleys – will be returning to their homes with their families. The Weasleys are welcome to spend the weekend with us. Please enjoy the time you have left. A house-elf will be here to show you the way when your time is up.
Tobias laughed and straightened. ~I will introduce you to my pack, and then may we enter? I will add the blood of those few who will be allowed to enter without me being present, but I wish to explore a bit first. ~
When Draco reached the Slytherin common room, his ears were assaulted by multiple voices, all asking questions at the same time.
“The original plan was to talk to the few students, the staff then eventually to the Headmaster. Unfortunately our plans have been required to change. We are now cancelling all classes until this matter is dealt with. Every person in the school is going to be looked over by a Healer from St Mungos and the results will be duplicated. One copy will be cross checked with the file in the school nurses office; one will be kept at St Mungos. If there is cause for concern, then a letter will be sent to your parents or guardians telling them to come to the school at their closets convenience and we will discuss the problem to see if a logical reason is available for the anomaly.”
“We will explain what we can,” the dark-haired man said with a sigh, much to everyone’s shock, “but I will NOT break the trust he has given me, so don’t even think of asking for more.”
Tobias looked at her incredulously. “Yes, Allies,” he eventually stated after getting his voice back. “You don’t seriously expect me to believe that the entire population would leave their money in the control of their enemy.”
Tobias melted into Draco’s arms, hiding his face in the crook of his neck. The Professors and The Pack smiled at the counter. It was evident – to all who wished to look – that they adored each other. The watched as the two conversed in whispers and soft touches, before Draco gently guided his husband to the Slytherin Table.
“I’ll stay with him while you return to the meeting. Someone needs to be there to put forward what the two of you wish for.”
Harry grinned and harshly pulled Draco to him by his dick. “Of course,” he purred, “But you are going to be punished for yelling at me.”
Before too long, Harry found himself reclining in the large leather arm chair in his secret room in the dungeon, waiting to see what treat his Pet had for him tonight. He gasped loudly as the tiny fairy lights and the single spotlight in the room turned on and focused on the tall pole that resided in the room he was in and the one above it. He felt his dick give an interested twitch as he noted the change that had been made in the usually plain silver piece of metal.
Fred and George exchanged identical smirks over the piece of parchment in their hands. On the table between them lay the letter their youngest brother had written. They knew that if their mother received it, then Ginny would be in trouble – if only because she had sided with Tobias rather than Dumbledore.
He opened his mouth to continue, only to find it obstructed by Draco’s mouth. After an intense kiss that lasted several minutes they parted panting for breath.
“Oh grow UP Anadochos!” Tobias snapped. “We are married and I’m pregnant, it’s more than obvious that I’ve had at least one chance of having a good arse pounding – or did you thing I got it off a fucking toilet seat!”
His small gasp of shock caused everyone else to look at him then turn to face what he was looking at. All three of them gulped. Someone had sent Howlers to them. It wasn’t long before they each had a red envelop before them.
The screaming snapped Severus out of his horrified stupor.  Raising his wand, he pointed it at the man and said, “Stupefy!” He dragged the heavy-set man out of the room, trying to ignore the whimpering coming from the boy on the wall.
The two Daemon snarled. “If the wolf hadn’t destroyed them three humans, we would have. They were lucky that our vows to the Mother and Father prevented us from killing someone unless we see them do something.”
Draco smiled sadly as his thoughts turned to their Pack. A month into the year after they had graduated, Luna and Vincent had been bonded in a double ceremony with Ginny and Gregory. While both bonding ceremonies had occurred between only two people, because they had been held at the same time, the four of them had obtained a fierce comradery between them that only deepened over the years.
It had now been two and a half months since it had been discovered that Tobias was expecting, One month one week since the NEWTs had been sat and three weeks since The Pack refused to have anything to do with Severus. Tobias looked up at the Head Table to see the now familiar site of a red-haired, pink-robed Severus with a quill in one hand and parchment in the other. It turned out that Tom had a larger vindictive streak when you messed with his son than when he was Voldemort and had spelled the man to only talk in quacks and cheeps.
Draco chuckled softly and hugged his intended tighter. “Don’t worry, Bi. If she touches me, I’ll feed her to the Oaf’s newest obsession. I’ll even ask him politely.”
He raised his head and looked into his husband’s lust-filled eyes. He pulled back to stop himself from cuming too soon and to look over the body beneath his. He jumped when he felt hands on his shoulders. Smirking, he removed the hands and pinned them above their owners’ head.
“I am only asking because I overheard something the few times I was allowed near Dumbledore’s Order. He has been trying to convince the Weasley’s to petition for permission to marry them to Fred and George. I don’t know if it has been done, but if it has, I am telling you something that they don’t know. It will be ME that you will be going through if  the papers come in and can’t be reversed, not the older Weasleys. Fred and George are in my Pack so I know them best. Their parents have no say over ANYTHING.”
The man held out two cups containing a thick green liquid. Tobias gleefully took one and started spooning it into his mouth. Draco looked between the other one that was still in the healer’s hand and his husband suspiciously. “What is it?”
“I’m not a cat person,” Severus sniffed. “I don’t do animals. I only like wolves because I will be in horrible trouble with Tobias and Draco if I said that I didn’t.”
He and Lucius removed the metal and at almost the same time, Remus administered the potion while Severus and Lucius removed the clothing from the now silent boy on the bed.
“All of it,” Tobias pouted. “The peas are hard, the potato is raw and the fish is oozing greasy icky stuff … And I don’t even want to know what THAT is supposed to be,” he pointed at the sauce that lay congealed on the side of his plate.
“Explain for us as well, will you?” Pansy requested. “Your Grandmother already contacted McGonagall about you being out of school – as has The Lord and Lucius for Tobias and Draco. The rest of us however …” she shrugged.
“If you say so. How are you? Goyle really laid into you. I did try to get him and Crabbe to leave you alone. I just think that it takes Goyle longer to learn.”
Severus nodded in agreement. “I have all the assignments I received before the holidays as well as quizzes from all my classes to mark. If he agrees, I’ll get him to help me by marking the first and second year assignments as well as all the quizzes. I have the answers written out if he doesn’t know any of them.”
Tobias closed his eyes for a while then nodded. “The snake is Draco, the phoenix is me. The silver colour of the dragon represents all those we think of as family – mainly everyone here, but including those no longer with us. The dragon itself is a symbol of how close we are as a family unit. All of us are protective of each other and I know that each of us will protect the family with dragon-like ferocity.” Tobias paused.
“We will need to work on Occulmancy again this year, Neogennito, so he can’t get into your head. This is going to be more important than last year.”
“I have,” Amelia admitted with a sigh. “Tell him and his over-protective blonde that I will discuss it with those present here and give their answer later tonight. And Lucius?”
Tobias was thinking about what that meant about the bond and the room’s influence on it when the doors to the Great Hall opened and standing in the opening were Luna and Ginny.
Ginny put the quill in her hand down with a soft groan of relief, that quickly turned to a moan as Theo grabbed the hand in question and dug his own fingers into the cramped flesh. Neither of them noticed the glare that a certain body guard threw at the smaller male.
I should also probably mention that I don't own anything that is recognisable and as for the rest ... well ... it is under a thing called 'imagination' I love fooling with things that I shouldn't (can you tell I'm a little bit of a fire bug? hehe)
“Oh Gods I want you ‘Bi. So fucking badly. I want to lick, kiss, suck and bite my way down your body before I sink into you slowly, claiming your depths for me and me alone.” He stopped so he wouldn’t whimper and started to push his groin into Tobias’.
Once again all eyes turned to the bonded couple, where Tobias had wrapped his arms around Draco’s hips, his head on the blonde’s stomach, fast asleep. The men and women who didn’t know the couple well quietly left the room, followed by Lucius, who was to tell the rest of The Pack that they could enter. He knew it would be useless to tell them to leave. He smirked to himself when all the members of The Pack, including the two fifth years, were standing at the entrance.
“You know me far too well. Now, the second and more important, reason I am here is … I would like to hire one of your curse breakers and maybe two of your staff who deal in heavy lifting.”
“He said that I said, ‘If you think that I could love a pathetic freak like you, then you are more delusional than I thought.’”
Tobias sat at his desk, an owl feather quill in his hand. Before him was a list of potions that were safe enough for him to make for his N.E.W.Ts. He read through the short list and circled one. Shaking his head, he reached for another sheet of parchment and started to write.
“Oh yes,” Luna said happily. “I was just making new friends.” The younger girl smiled up at Neville and put the jar into her bag. “Do you mind preparing the Room for me while I go get someone else who I think would love to help with tonight?”
“Only partially,” Pansy responded flippantly from where she and Ginny were conversing. “The rest will be the Cubs.”
The other paused and thought for a moment. “There’s only one way to find out. Draco, is there an adult in the castle that you trust explicitly?” Draco nodded. “Then can you bring them here so we can talk?”
“Oh hush, all of you and let the young ones speak. Yes, Helga, they are cute and if I’m not incorrect they are also highly amused. Now hush.” The elegant lady turned to face the group. Tobias bowed to the four founders.
“Gin, aren’t you supposed to be at the Burrow? What are you going to tell mum and dad when they ask where you’ve been?”
Luna noted the flurescent purple breast and deep pink beak and talons as Ginny exclaimed, “Lycia! What news have you bought form the mischief makers from Tartarus?”
“I’m sure. I miss you Harry. I miss snuggling into you at night and I miss seeing you the moment I wake up. All we’ve been getting time for is a five minute fumble in a closet and I want – no – I need more.”
Draco growled, wandlessly removing the ties around his ankles and flipped them so Tobias was pinned beneath him. “Two hours,” he growled breathlessly into Tobias’ ear. “You have been teasing me mercilessly for two hours – giving me enough stimulation to want more, but not enough to cum.” He laughed darkly, sending chills down his husband’s spine. “I am going to fuck you so hard that the extra protection our child has wrapped around it will be activated.” He pushed in a touch. “You WILL get on your hands and knees. You WILL get my very long, thick cock shoved deeply into your arse. There will be NO touching yourself. You will come from my cock and my cock alone, is that understood?”
As the ceremony faded, Harry stepped forward and laid a hand on Remus’ shoulder. When he pulled it away, he sucked the blood off one of his fingers. His eyebrows rose.
Severus looked from the vial, to Tobias, then to Draco. “May I?” At Draco’s nod, he gently removed the vial from Draco’s hand. Sitting in his chair, he allowed his magic to test the potion’s magical signature. He raised awe-filled eyes to Draco’s. “He is the maker of this potion, Draco.” Severus bowed deeply to Tobias.
“It is an honour to meet the four founders of Hogwarts. My name is Tobias and I would like to ask your permission to stay in these rooms after my intended and I bond. I have met Raithia’s approval and I wish to gain yours.”
“Well, Lykos, the problem is that you and Nonos decided to have your private dance lesson in the sitting room that we were scheduled to arrive in. Now that isn’t a bad thing, but you both fell asleep before you could use a cleaning charm or get dressed and/or covered. Good thing none of us are prudes in this house and as much as my Pack is enjoying the view, I don’t think it is appropriate for men of your age to appear like that for dinner.”
He looked at the table and gasped feeling tears gathering behind his eyes. The table was set for two with the best plates, cups and cutlery the Malfoy family could afford. Two silver candlestick holders sat on either side of the table and in the very centre was a crystal vase holding a bunch of ten roses; three yellow with pink tips, three the colour of Champaign, three pale blue and in the very centre, one single black one. He felt a single tear roll down his cheek.
“The first sweet we just call ‘Chatters’.” Severus gave Neville a half-smile in encouragement and pride before handing him a small purple set of lolly teeth – small enough to sit on Neville’s tongue. “The way the sweet is consumed determines the severity of the reaction. If they are consumed slowly – as Neville is doing now – the reaction is slower and much milder than if it is chewed. The effect is even worse if they are just swallowed. Now, if we watch Neville, you will see the skin around his eyes, lips and fingers go pale blue. His teeth will start chattering softly and he will be cool to the touch. This will last till the sweet has dissolved. A simple glass of water will heat him up again.”
“Oh no you don’t!” Draco smirked playfully, trying to get a decent grip on his wriggling and giggling husband. After a difficult ten minutes, Draco had himself and Tobias in the bath with the blonde gently washing his husband. It wasn’t too long before both teens drifted off into the arms of Morpheus. Half an hour later, Neville, Tom and Algernon walked into the room looking for the missing duo, only to smile at how cute they looked together.
“For some reason, Amelia stated as she walked through the open door, “I believe I agree with you on that.”
“You do realise that Draco won’t hold you responsible right?” Lucius said as he lay a gentle hand on the red-headed girl’s shoulder.
Draco grasped the appendage and placed a soft kiss to the back of it. Almost instantly Tobias collapsed onto the mattress in relief as most of the pain left his body.
She rubbed the mark with her fingers as she looked at the happy group over at the Slytherin Table with a heavy heart. She could have had that had she not been so stupid. She noticed as the Italian snake jumped slightly when the Parkinson girl put her arm around him, obviously asking him how he was after his night’s adventure – if you could call it that.
“No one make eye contact with the guardian. She will not be able to kill you, but she is able to make you very sick.” Tobias watched as everyone nodded before turning to the portrait once more.
Hermione sighed softly and started to tell the Deputy Headmistress the full story, starting from the beginning of the previous year. The more the Transfiguration teacher heard, the sicker she felt in the stomach. She gasped in shock when Hermione explained about the bands they had put on Harry and the spells they had performed on him both before and after they had been applied. By the end of the explanation, Minerva was slightly green.
Amelia sighed and rested her head on her folded arms in exhaustion. It was the morning of the second day after the death of Miss Granger and already it had been a long day and it was about to get longer still.
Once properly attired – Draco in black silk pyjama pants and Tobias in blue – They stumbled over the bed where they quickly fell into a relaxed sleep, with Draco holding Tobias as if he were the most fragile thing on the face of the Earth.
Draco jumped, causing four different people to chuckle. “We were bonded a week ago, Madam Hufflepuff. Last night we fell asleep really early due to what I assumed was magical drain. When I awoke, I was fine, but Tobias here can’t seem to stay awake.”
Draco rolled his eyes good naturedly and obediently opened his mouth. He struggled to chew and swallow the bite but the tears on his face revealed to everyone who could see them at how hard he had to fight the instinct to spit it out.
“Let’s gather in the dining room, it is almost time for supper. Remus? Could you stay and show Harry the way?”
“Lucius,” the creature called out in relief, ignoring the boy beside him. “You have to reverse whatever those horrid kretins did to me! It’s an outrage!”
As he read the letter addressed to him, a huge smile plastered itself onto his face. Grabbing the letter from his son, he read through it quickly before jumping to his feet.
Ron Weasley woke up with a start as his naked back hit cold stone. He sleepily tried to bring his hands to his face to rub the sleepiness away so he could find his pyjama top, only to discover he couldn’t move them. Wide awake with fear, he screamed as he found himself tied naked and spread-eagled to the bottom of a bridge. Below him was a sheer drop between two jagged cliff faces upon which he could see many varieties of insects and arachnids and at the bottom, he could see a thin shimmering line of water with large areas of dullness nestled in it that he assumed to be rocks.
“What if they try something with Kyria when they see the results she gets with what happened a few days ago?” Vincent asked. “I have only just found something to give as her first gift.”
Luna was in her specially designed room within the Room of Requirement, humming softly while getting the room ready for her plans for the next evening, humming a popular children’s song in a slow and eerie fashion, a large insane grin on her face and silver eyes following things only she could see. Life was perfect. Her Alpha and his unborn cub were doing well, she had Alpha’s permission to court a potential mate and she had another session with a red-headed annoyance. Yes, life was very, very good.
Madam Greengrass bowed her head in response. “What is the meaning of this?” she asked, indicating the scene before them. “Tobias was meant to see me at two. It is now five fifteen!”
The Patil family had always believed that the strength of a man was found, not in body or magic, but in the bonds they held to their family, and while some may argue that Mr Fred and Mr George Weasley proved themselves to be weak by abandoning their blood family; Achalendra had heard and witnessed tales and behaviours of older generations of the Weasley and Prewitt families to know that the twins distancing themselves from their blood family was a sign of the strength they had.
The kiss started out sweet, but quickly turned into something else. By the time Draco stopped plundering his husband’s very willing mouth for the second time that morning, the three girls of The Pack were flushed and fanning themselves and Severus and Remus were no longer in the room. A growl and the thud of a body being slammed into a wall gave an indication of where they were.
Smirking at his father shocked face, he led his pack into the seating room. Severus followed them, his eyes lighting up when he spotted his mate. Tobias chuckled and pushed him in the direction of the werewolf. He laughed when Remus dragged Severus out of the room enthusiastically. He and Draco locked eyes, both knowing what was going to happen. Tobias noticed something deep in Draco’s eyes and stepped forwards and let his arms wrap around his beloved. “I know you don’t understand why I’ve been avoiding most contact with you lately, Drakontas. After tonight you will know. You deserve nothing but the best.” He ran his fingers over the sharp lines of Draco’s face. “I want to give you the best.”
“Beautiful,” he whispered, running a fingertip over Draco’s cheek. “You, Drakontas, are perfection personified.” Tobias bowed over the hand in his and planted a soft kiss on the fingers. “May I escort you to our table?”
Draco smiled softly and nuzzled his check on the top of Tobias’ head. “Later is later. This is now. Just relax my special one. Just enjoy.”
Before anyone could open their mouths, the Daemon had vanished. With a shrug, everyone decided on when they were going to go a meet the cub.
The rest of the day passed peacefully for The Pack member who were still in school. The incident of that morning was still fresh in everyone’s minds so nearly no-one was game enough to talk to any of them. Of the few souls brave enough to talk to them, only three enquired after their Alpha’s health and only two asked after Luna. Each of them got a smile from the person they had asked and the latest update that they had heard.
“If you are talking about the cub arriving, then yes it is,” Neville replied with a small grin, even as he winced at another screamed yell of pain.
“They would be having something to eat with Severus in their room,” Lucius stated. “When they become … amorous … it is har –
Fred heaved a sigh of relief while simultaneously shooting his brother a pitying look. Padma, to Tobias’ interest, looked both relieved and angry.
“Master Tobias can have this today instead of food,” the elf squeaked, ‘but you must eat what you get for dinner.”
Everyone turned to look at the two on the bed to find Tobias beginning to rub his head along Draco’s jaw line. Within moments the two boys were back in their room at the school thanks to Thanatos.
Plans are made, new bonds of friendships begun and a new name is given for a fresh start in a new life.
Draco watched his husband as he dozed in his spot. Slowly, so not to disturb him, he manoeuvred himself so Tobias’ head was on his chest.
Vincent smiled and ran a gentle finger over the package in his pocket. He hoped the silver-eyed female liked what he had found for her.
“It’s gotten to the point that the money we get from our contacted investors is pocket change. We could last about eight years if we stopped taking the money they provided us – including what we get from the product sales and just used our share of the money we made selling our pranks from last year to now alone.”
“Are you ready son?” Lucius hid his amusement well, letting only a small amount of it show in his eyes. His son was dressed in his finest clothes – black robes edged with silver and green Dragons. Lucius smirked. “Dressing to impress, my son?”
“Don’t you just love Veritaserum?” Everyone fell silent and looked at him. “What?” he asked defensively. “It was the only thing I could keep down.”  This instantly sobered everyone up.
A matronly-looking woman clasped her hands together and beamed as she looked out over the congregated students.
Chuckling softly, Voldemort rested a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Will those chosen as godparents step forward?”
As Severus and his father rested before removing the last band, he heard himself ask, “Who made them, Sev? Do you know? And if you do, are they going to be punished?” ‘And can I help?’ he added silently.
Without a word Ginny and Theo turned and ran out of the room. As the others closed ranks, Remus approached the one person he knew would tell him the truth.
“I wish to be known as Tobias Regulas Black please, as Pateras named me Tobias Regulas, and I am the heir of the Black line. The person Harry James Potter no longer exists and never did exist. I am the sole heir to both lines. So mote it be.”
“Yeah,” Blaise added with a laugh, “the last thing anyone will need in your shop is a cheering charm.”
Remus nodded, bowed and left with the goblet, which had been licked clean. Voldemort watched his son stretch again and noticed the wild, animalistic grace and strength he seemed to exude.
“That it has,” Tobias agreed with a smile as he slowly led his beloved to the bed they had shared since their bonding so many years ago. With one last kiss for the day, both men fell into dreams where all their loved ones still lived.
“We’ll be fine, son,” Lucius sighed in relief as he sank into his own seat, Narcissa beside him. “We are just tired and -” he wrinkled his nose slightly, “dusty.” He sneezed, causing Pansy to giggle; otherwise the common room was silent at the sight before them – The three most influential people in the wizarding world grey with dust and physically, mentally and magically depleted before breakfast had even been served. The pop of apparition startled everyone into jumping – but none jumped higher than Severus when he saw Tobias.
Draco blinked himself out of his thoughts and smiled at the photo his eyes had moved to. He and Tobias were in their early sixties and looked to be in their mid-thirties. In front of Tobias was Melody, smiling alternatively between her parents and the camera. Beside her and in the gap between the chairs holding the two oldest members knelt a delicately built young man with a slightly rounding stomach who was identical to Draco except for his hands, his hair and his temperament. This was Remi; their youngest and the picture had been taken two months before he had birthed his first born.
“Don’t mind me,” Lord Patil said, raising both hands in the air. “I just came along to get away from the brats. You wouldn’t suspect that they were all over the age of thirty, the way they’re acting at the moment.”
“I’ll be sure to pass it along to him then,” Amelia stated, eyes slightly wider at the organisation and preparation that had gone into the plans in such a short amount of time.
I know you don’t like me, and have no reason to trust or believe me, but I have some things I need to tell you and I can’t risk writing them down.  I also need you to GET ME OUT OF HERE or there will be three muggles dead by my hand, and I will make Voldemort look like a schoolyard bully in comparison.
And with that, they all cracked up again – even Neville, terrified as any mention of Snape always made him look.
Hermione seemed to have gotten mostly books. Ron mostly handmade items – not least among them the knitted jumper with a great big R he was wearing now. Anthony, mostly things related to riddles and adventure. Draco, mostly really pragmatic, practical objects. Neville, mostly confidence-boosting gifts. Hal thought it was quite a good insight into all of his friend’s lives at home, and their relationships with their families.
Lupin looked like he was on the edge of saying something else, but in the end he just shook his head with a smile, bid Hal a good day and left him to finish his bagel.
Muggleborn, Draco would guess from the look of amazement and wonder the boy cast on everything. Though he knew of wizards who did not spend much time in magical cities, they at least would not have looked like they were about to squeal in delight at the sight of a floating measuring tape. That was just everyday household magic.
film – and a black thick smoke escaped the professor’s body with enough force to knock Hal back down.
Hal sat there miserably for the rest of the hour, staring down at the table vacantly, trying not to fall asleep, as his classmates finished their potions and wrapped up. Ron patted him on the back on his way out, Neville gave him a weak smile and Hermione whispered
Neville paused at the entrance of the Potions classroom, looking in warily, as if he was going to see a pool of his blood still on the floor. There was, of course, no evidence left of what had happened, not even a stain or faint marks from the runes the St Mungo’s staff had used to transport him.
Neville, who had been relaxed and having fun so far as he did more and more the longer he spent time with them (they’d all understood his grandmother had been quite strict bringing him up) started panicking immediately.
“Sirius Black.” She spat angrily as she came nearer. “You are a murderer! You should be ashamed to show your face!”
He recognised several of the Weasleys, and a few Slytherins he’d met at one gathering or another. He saw some teens that were clearly couples, including two Hufflepuff boys holding hands, which made him feel a little jolt of… something. He spotted his godfather sitting with the other teachers, looking immensely bored. Severus had already warned him he would be showing no favouritism towards him, and he’d better make him proud in Potions. Draco wasn’t too worried. He liked the idea of brewing potions, and he didn’t think he’d be bad at it. Plus, he knew the man played at being mean, but actually had a real soft spot for him.
“That’s lovely.” Hermione beamed, probably more grateful for the diversion than for the chocolate itself.
“Quirrell tried to kill Hal again.” Draco spilled out, seeing the confusion his words caused on Sev’s face. “The he went after whatever the dog is guarding, and it couldn’t be good, so we went after him, and I came back out to find you, and Neville is going to, but the others are…”
“Maybe.” Hermione explained, taking a breath. “If Slytherin was you ancestor, both yours and… You-Know-Who’s – and I know, those are two massively hypothetical
“I was so scared.” He admitted, looking down, his voice tiny. “I was so scared, I thought I was going to die-”
Hal didn’t really know what he meant by that, but he supposed if his friend wasn’t pissed off, it was good enough for him.
“This is so huge.” Hal laughed when Draco had shown him, maybe, a quarter of the house. “Don’t leave me anywhere because I’d never find my way back.”
“Thank you, Hermione.” Draco nodded his head to her, trying very hard not to laugh in Ron’s outraged face. “Besides.” He added with a sigh. “Gits or not, I’ll probably end up marrying one of them, so.”
, impressed. Boys were reckless, she had always known that, and once it had become clear Hal was unlikely to walk away or wait for teachers to be found, and the others were compelled enough by his sudden show of leadership (and she had to admit, it was somewhat magnetic) to follow him blind, she had thought the best thing to do was come along and at least see if she could do something to ensure the band of
“Yer right.” Hagrid sniffled, shaking his head. “Yer right. I’ll take him. You think they’ll let me visit?”
The rest of the boys snickered – Draco picked out two of the Quidditch players whose names he didn’t know nor cared about, and Jeremy Bullstrode, which was bad news. Due to the uncertainty of his family’s blood status, he had a reputation for wanting to prove himself to the likes of Flint.
They obviously told each other they’d see them later, though when they were gone, Draco caught Hal closing his eyes and breathing deeply for a moment, lying back for a minute before he had to sit up again to eat.
“It’s a big house.” Anthony added with a brief look of almost worship towards his dad. “Not as big as yours, I’m sure, but you still wouldn’t be in anyone’s way.”
More specifically, Marcus Flint and another few players from the Quidditch team, who were not looking happy at all.
He seemed a lot less happy to see the guy, and Draco had an immediate inkling of who that was. It was confirmed a second later when Hal introduced him almost accusingly.
“Good morning, Professor.” Hal greeted her. “I had something to tell you, if you’re not too busy? It’s quite serious.”
Which might have been able to fly, and wasn’t even that far off from the truth. Unfortunately, Ley answered at the exact same time.
They both looked about ready to combust. Under the pretence of walking over to wrap a towel around her son, Petunia came protectively closer to Hal, smiling politely at the two witches (they had to be). Although, the mother pulled a mobile phone out of her pocket, and turned around to have an excited conversation with whoever she called.
The signature was smudged, as if it had been added with damp fingers, and Hal wondered if his dad had been crying. He had to push the letter away from him so as not to smear it with his own tears. When his aunt came downstairs, she simply put the letter and photo back in the tin, closed the lid, and held him as he cried.
Then almost ran into Peeves and, in trying to escape his notice, ended up on a rogue staircase again.
I am convinced that with a loving mother (so to speak) Hal wouldn’t be so reckless. He did promise Petunia not to go looking for trouble! So I made quite a few changes to the ending. Scratched the visit to Aragog, because why in their right mind would they do that – I don’t think they’re close enough to Hagrid for that suggestion to make sense, and also no Ford Anglia to rescue them!
He could see the surprise clear on Sev’s feature for once, if only fleetingly before he composed himself. Draco still allowed a few seconds for that to sink in before he continued.
And the morning of the Quidditch match, after he’d gone to wish Hal (and the rest of the team, but mostly Hal) good luck in the changing rooms, obviously Flint had found himself conveniently in his way, but Draco had fought back the nausea and summoned the courage to tell him to stay the fuck away from him.
The rain didn’t let up, but just as Pan was psyching himself up to get back to his feet and go, before his charms wore off and he had to walk back with a heavy trunk this time, he could hear cheerful chatter, and soon enough, a group of people came into view. Pan recognised Anthony, holding a little girl by the hand who was bouncing up and down beside him. Their parents walked behind them, wands up and holding a water-repellent charms over everyone’s heads.
“You asked Hal?” Draco interrupted, feeling weird at the thought his friends might be discussing him behind his back.
“What.” He was the one to speak. “Happened here.” His tone was cold, but Hal did not miss the worry in his eyes as he looked over at Draco.
“You’re completely safe here.” She shook her head, as if that was meant to be reassuring. “Have you eaten? I can make something else if you don’t like this? What’s your favourite?”
“I’m tired.” He admitted. “Not just physically, that’ll pass, but… I just wanted this year to be normal, and it’s been anything but. Everyone has an
“Minerva.” Severus interrupted her. “We need to contact Albus for him to return right away. I fear what he suspected is true – Quirinus has gone after the stone, and we know it isn’t for himself.”
Hal startled. “Scabbers?” He surmised, gobsmacked. “You’re saying Ron’s rat is someone called Peter Pettigrew?”
He grabbed the broom, and flew right up to where Draco had spotted the key. His Seeker instincts kicking in, he kept his eyes on it even as it zipped left and right, and it didn’t take him much time till he was closing his hand around it.
. These sounded like they dramatically lacked privacy, but when Hal and Hermione challenged the rest of them to send each other Muggle postcards and see who could find the most horrendous one, they all had to agree.
“No, well, I mean, speaking of classes.” Hal really felt proud of himself for not rolling his eyes. “They start at 9.”
After the class, Ron and Neville went straight for food, while Hermione ran to the library as if the books were going to fly off if she didn’t get to them fast enough. They met with the Ravenclaws on the way out, and Draco declared there was no time like the present and went to find Snape in his office. Hal and Anthony had consumed a humongous breakfast that morning, after challenging each other for who could eat the most hash browns, so they elected to make their way to the Astronomy tower where they had their next class together.
She shrugged nonchalantly, once again affecting a careless demeanour. Severus seemed to be satisfied enough, as he nodded solemnly.
A little alarm bell went in Draco’s mind, because he suddenly remembered Sirius Black didn’t just have ties to his family, he had them with Hal’s too, and not in a good way. But if he could steer the conversation away from that, he’d be fine, and they never had to mention him again.
They both must have been up all night watching over them, he realised. Or if they’d gotten any sleep, it wouldn’t have been much. It looked like it was mid-morning now, and they’d gone into the Chamber still fairly early in the evening. The whole ordeal couldn’t have taken more than a few hours, and Draco doubted that Snape would have allowed for his mother – and therefore Hal’s aunt – to be called any later than immediately.
She knew about the previous attacks – all parents and guardians had had to be informed by the school, and Hal had told her too, although downplaying it a bit – and that was probably the only reason she could make any sense of the hiccuped, drowned explanation Hal tried to give her for his current state.
They talked for almost hour, about one stupid thing after another, until Dean asked if he was going to go to bed anytime soon because some people were trying to sleep. Hal complied, but he could not get to sleep. He tried, he did, but he still felt too excited from the afternoon fooling around and from his chat with Ley, so in the end he gave up. He picked up his glasses, pulled on some socks, grabbed the cloak, and went for a wander. He had a few theories he wanted to test.
Lupin hummed, then gave Hal a nervous look. “I wanted to speak to you about something, actually.” He announced. “I saw you put your name up for wanting to have a go at the Boggart next class.”
, he just felt a little bit like a deer who had been ambushed on a hunt and then realised the hunter wasn’t going to cast any spells or release the dogs, and also he’d ran all the way there – he paused to rethink what had just happened. His plan had… worked? It seemed being an honorary Slytherin for the night had somehow made him off-limits for bullying, at least there and then. He’d take that.
“Mrs Malfoy won’t mind.” Hal assured. He didn’t know the woman, sure, but from what Draco had told him of her, she didn’t sound like she would mind if her son brought home a whole marching band dressed in those rhinoceros costumes from the London marathon. “I’ll write to Draco, see what he says?”
Sirius was in the main room of the pub, three empty cups in front of him, as if he’d been waiting down there since he’d been awake – which, really, Hal wouldn’t really have been that surprised. He must be going a little stir crazy by now, stuck here on his own, though Sirius had let slip that he’d received visits from Lupin. The man sprung to his feet when he spotted Hal, a smile breaking onto his face, fuller now, healthier than when Hal had first met him. He looked younger, and a lot more like the heir of a massive fortune than an escape convict, precisely the angle his lawyer was working very hard on.
He’d noticed boys and girls hanging together with no apparent fear of being called gay, something that he didn’t think would happen in the Muggle world, as limited as his experience was in the matter, but he’d not particularly seen a trend towards more Ravenclaws doing that compared to other Houses.
Draco could only imagine that one would be even more visible on his own paler skin. The rest of Hal’s body was covered, but Draco knew there would only be more of the same, matching welts on his wrists and legs, the bite mark – already a scar – on his arm and Merlin knew what else.
, where they could write back should they prefer not to use an owl (Hal ad Ley exchanged a look and tried not to laugh, only chastened by how seriously Petunia was reading all this nonsense) also informing them that their representatives could be found in Diagon Alley – another address and instructions to enter a pub and ask for the DAMSELS were included – to help them with their shopping.
He considered sending her back, but there were potentially berserk keys, a murderous plant, and three giant dog heads that may or may not stay asleep, and she was just a little girl, he thought considering the witch in front of him. Ahead, violent enchanted chess pieces and a mountain troll. He couldn’t leave her standing here either.
“A lot of the charges don’t concern us.” Hal expanded. “But they want me and Draco to testify regarding the attack. Obviously there aren’t really any other witnesses to his previous offences since he’s Obliviated them all.”
The argument carried on all day, Hermione urging Hal to talk to someone if his scar was suddenly hurting, Hal insisting it wasn’t and wanting to hear no more about it, Ron and Neville staying carefully out of it. Anthony and Draco were only filled in at dinnertime, their respective classes having kept them separate till then.
to shine into the room (his mother always allowed him to do magic inside the house). It seemed to be a small library – no doubt full of forbidden texts, dark magic grimoires and other dangerous tomes, knowing his family history. Draco knew better than to open any of them, but as the light from his wand shone upon a small reading desks, he spotted an inconspicuous black notebook, and thought maybe he could learn something from the notes his father may have taken on the content of the shelves.
He had been right, they were in a Muggle neighbourhood. He didn’t know how he found the presence of mind to put his wand away, but he did. The last thing he needed was to get picked up for unlicensed underage use of magic or for breaking the Statute of Secrecy – he didn’t think his bout of magic inside the house would have triggered the trace, as it probably qualified as accidental, but using his wand certainly would. He did need help, and Aurors popping out of thin air would be good for that, but he somehow didn’t think that’d be the best way to stage a rescue.
He put the whole thing out of his mind as they carried on playing, but it came back to him on the way home, as he was trying his very best not to doze off on the train – the day had been amazing, but thoroughly exhausting.
Part of her was really proud of them for standing up to the bully, but she couldn’t commend Hal on his reaction.
“Is he any good with hair-cutting spells?” Pan asked, fingers finding the tips of his straight black hair, somewhere just above his shoulder.
Draco directed a sharp, steely glance up at the older boy. “Oh please.” He knew it was ill-advised to rise to the bait, but the term always triggered something in him. “What does that even mean?”
Confident that he had found the perfect solution, he headed happily to the dungeons to find Severus and ask him immediately. His godfather was happy to see him, offered him a cup of tea, and Draco explained the situation with his mother and made his suggestion, not even pausing to imagine that the answer could be-
“Actually, I wanted to ask.” Hal remembered. “While we’re here, or maybe before I get the train back, could we go to Diagon Alley? I’ve been given a special dispensation to get my own broomstick, since I’m in the squad. I’ll pay for it with the wizard money, it’s not a problem.”
They waited for Hermione at the table she usually favoured – right at the back, so it was often free, but beneath a big window so there was a lot of light, and with an empty shelf above it for piling on additional books.
“So they… they treat you well? I saw you with them, I thought you looked alright, but I wasn’t sure…”
“Glad you’re okay.” He said quickly, already detaching from them to carry on down the opposite direction they were going. “See you around, Harry.”
At first Draco thought it was because the bloke had shouted it pretty much in Hal’s ear, but from the way Hal looked nervously around, and sagged in relief when he spotted the Nils in question (a lanky brown-haired fifth-year guffawing as he threw enchanted sticky bats at his friends), it was clear the name itself had made him react.
will have to think about how you change your behaviour, your social attitudes, you will have to deal with the perception others have of you. It can put a stress on your state of mind, on your relationship with others. This is a life-changing decision, which is often considered much too big to be made by a child your age. As far as I am concerned, you are the best placed to know, but I will ask you this. Are your parents aware of this? Whether your feelings about your gender identity or your decision to transition.”
“Wait.” Hal suddenly remembered what he’d found out in his first year, from his aunt accepting to go through Lily’s old letters to see if she mentioned any friends. His dad’s friends, who were Peter, Remus and Sirius. “Wait, wait.” He repeated, his eyes widening. “You had a friend Remus, right? Is it – it’s not Remus as in Remus Lupin, is it?”
happy.” Pan sighed. “Father’s been ranting about how incompetent Dumbledore is for not even being able to figure this out, while also gloating about Mud- Muggleborns being attacked.”
around the room to keep the Devil’s Snare away, and he didn’t hide his relief when he spotted Draco with his own ray of light.
“I will owl you.” He concluded. “Rubeus, if you would please come with us. Albus guaranteed there was no need to involve the DMLA, I do hope you will not prove him wrong now.”
When they ended up in the ice cream parlour, having collected everything they needed, Hal managed to hide himself in a corner, leaving Ley to chat and laugh with the twins. Draco sat next to him, and once they had fallen onto the first few mouthfuls of their sundaes as if they hadn’t seen food in a week, they paused to breathe and talk.
She heard the tell-tale noises of one of her boys going to the bathroom, then soft footsteps down the stairs. She could safely bet on Hal – Ley tended to sleep until 12 unless forcefully removed from his bed. Putting the lid back on the tin, she took it with her as she went down to the kitchen.
Hal sighed. “It startled me, that’s all.” He said. “I met someone called Nils this summer and I had that second of, you know – can’t possibly be him.”
Hal had a weak laugh, and turning around to get a good look at him now their respective guardians weren’t in his line of sight, Draco realised he really did. He sat up for their friends, but he was pale, his eyes sunken and several bruises visible (Pomfrey always said magic wasn’t the best solution for bruises, the body did a perfectly nice job on its own, and it was better to leave them as an indicator of natural healing, which was just as important as spells and potions) and an angry red stripe along his neck from Lockhart’s rope.
.” The ghost inclined his head – which looks dangerously close to tipping over. “But I suppose you can call me Nick.”
“You know she is.” Hal grumbled back. He had already taken care to lock Little John Silver in his room.
it with stupid Lockhart and his stupid books and his stupid re-enactments. One day he would snap, and he would
Ah. While that made more sense, it didn’t sit right with Draco. He didn’t want his crush on Hal (he didn’t want anything related to Hal) to be a dirty little secret, and he didn’t like the idea of having to pretend. One of the clearest memories he had of his father was Lucius telling him:
“Leaving so soon?” Flint sneered. A moment later, he was in his line of vision, looking down at him smugly. “I don’t think so.”
“You’re mental.” He told his friend, hoping he would hear how hollow his laugh sounded to his own ears.
“Last time I saw her, she was younger than you are now.” Sirius recalled with a fond smile. “But already a handful.”
They moved on to playing Wizard Pictionary, which was like Muggle Pictionary, except that it involved a lot of wand-swishing and an enormous amount of nonsense. Hal found out on that occasion that underage magic was in fact possible outside of school, because, ha,
A third year walking past in the corridor, carrying a pile of books and looking harrowed, cast him a dirty look. They still had days to go. Hermione smacked Ron’s arm and muttered something about being insensitive and having no respect for his peers.
Sirius sighed, and seemed ready to argue, but Hal gave him a look and he dropped it, muttering something about Lily’s eyes being unfair.
over, so Pan couldn’t very well go and knock on his door. The rest of his Slytherin friends… well, they didn’t know, for one, and then they were all Pureblood, and who probably either cast him out as well or take him right back to Parkinson Hall.
The joke fell flat, but Hal forced a tight smile. He didn’t think it was likely Pettigrew would walk free, it didn’t look like the Imperius defence was going to hold, so he would be found guilty, but they were still talking about diminished responsibility and waxing lyrical about what terrifying times he’d had to endure, in an attempt to soften the Wizengamot. And Hal knew the sentence he got would be important to Sirius, that he wouldn’t be satisfied with anything less than, well, twelve years in Azkaban at the very least.
. Everyone in the school was talking (making wild suppositions) about what had happened in the Chamber of Secrets, and the frenzy around the scandal with Lockhart did nothing to help. In spite of that and all the crazy versions of the recent events going around, in-between healing and sleeping off the exhaustion, Hal and Draco had a chance to gather the missing pieces of what had happened.
As soon as Draco released his hold, Little Silver jumped onto the bed and let Hal cuddle him, before he tried to pretend he was barely interested and settled on his lap with typical catlike condescension. Hal just kept stroking him, happy.
“What happened?” Draco crouched down to help him sit up, since he seemed intent on doing so, surreptitiously checking for any broken bones or open wounds.
“No, no, this is all me. I’ll tell her about it of course, but… Look, I don’t know if you know, but the wizarding world right now is… not good.”
Hal was sitting in Dumbledore’s office, waiting for McGonagall the return with the Headmaster, gnawing on his thumb and trying to convince himself that surely, they couldn’t think he was responsible for petrifying a cat, two students and a ghost? He wouldn’t even know where to start.
of course but holding wizarding supremacy ideals strong and therefore considered more worthy of the honour than families like the Weasleys or Ollivanders.
Lockhart was swishing about, apparently telling a story to bewildered-looking students, looking completely unaware that he had lost his charge on the way back from London.
“That memory could have killed Draco.” Hal pointed out, face still in his hands. “It doesn’t matter if he’s not strong enough on its own – he’s still strong enough to use other people or things for his purpose. Draco could have died. I could have died.
That was not him. Those were not his thoughts. They were not. He might have thought like that once, years ago, years and years ago, when his father was still alive and shortly thereafter, but he had changed, he had opened his mind, he
“Really.” Hermione had kept talking. “Well, obviously it’s not always the case in everyone, some witches and wizards stay small, and the usual genetics still apply, but it seems like in the same way a lack of food, light and love can stunt a child’s growth, so can a lack of magic. Well, use of magic, if you have it. I’m guessing that is what is happening to Hal. He’s thriving now he’s started practicing. I wouldn’t be surprised if he grew into a very powerful wizard.”
to reach that level of comfort, he’d spent hours on a broom whizzing around the Manor from when he was about four years old. Hal had first touched a broom at eleven and it’d been effortless ever since.
“He said he thought there was something between us. That we seemed a bit closer than with the rest of the group.”
“I am not telling Hal I’m in love with him.” Draco shook his head. “Not now, not in the foreseeable future. Please leave it.” He made a last bid when Pan opened his mouth again, trying to convey in one look that this was final.
“Don’t think I’ll let you get away with distracting me with bribery, Harry James Potter. But yes.” She held out her hand for Hal to place the mobile phone with a triumphing grin.
Draco smiled tightly at that, storing the hurt with all the other ones he felt whenever Hal’s words were just what he wanted to hear, yet
“There’s been odd coincidences.” Hal provided helpfully, turning back to his aunt. “It actually makes perfect sense that it was magic.”
“She’s got a point.” Draco piped up. “I think Dumbledore would probably let other staff use the school for something important, but it’s more likely to be his.”
They walked some of the way in companionable silence, until Draco had to take a turn down to the dungeons, and Hal carried on up the stairs to the DADA office.
“Not… too much.” Draco therefore answered awkwardly. “I mean, of course I wouldn’t want to keep it a secret from our friends, but other than that, I don’t really want a lot of people to know.”
But the memory turned more serious. Tom gave him a bit of context, made him feel the mood of his time – Hogwarts was home to so many students, Purebloods and Muggleborns alike, and seeing it become unsafe was heart-breaking. Tom, among his Slytherin peers, had this haughtiness about him, but he also harboured a secret, a terrible and dangerous secret in these trouble times: his Muggle father. Something about him desperately did not
He seemed blissfully unaware of his own fame, and his role in defeating the Dark Lord ten years back. Draco guessed his Muggle relatives had not told him much about his heritage, if anything at all. Surely if he had been aware of the wizarding world, he would have made
Confused, Hal looked down at himself, only to find out he… wasn’t there. He could distinctly see the floor, and his discarded shoes, right through where his legs should have been.
“Well, no.” Hermione rolled her eyes. “But we’re not saying just anyone could have taken whatever it was from Gringotts to put it here. It would be something a member of the faculty, probably even Dumbledore himself, wants to keep close.”
. Nobody had really noticed, carrying on with the conversation, but Draco had slipped away as soon as he inconspicuously could to get to the diary.
Anthony, Neville and Pan had wandered nearer Hermione and the group of latest arrivals to see what they knew, figure out what exactly was going on and what the plan was, but Ron and Draco turned to him.
He grabbed one of the photos to hand it to Petunia; it was a large one of Lily, looking straight at the camera as if she was challenging them, a little looped quirk in her eyebrows the only movement.
The first meeting of the Duelling Club happened on the first Friday of December, and the turnout was phenomenal. It seemed like over half the school was interested in the event, in spite of the fact that Lockhart was heading it. Hal had very little hope that they’d learn anything from him, but since Draco had mentioned Snape was the other professor who’d agreed to supervise the evening, he trusted they had a chance of going away with something useful there.
Of course, when by the end of the game Hal was lying in a pool of his own blood with his skull cracked half open, he was sure Oliver didn’t quite mean it like that.
“Well, I'm sure it's a coincidence.” Hal flushed. “But we were talking the other day and...” He shook his head. “Never mind.”
He kissed Hal’s lips again, and pushed his lower body even closer. “You into this?” He asked. One of his hands moved from Hal’s hips to his crotch, and pressed down. “You are.” He grinned.
“Oh, shush. I read that growth and magic are closely connected in wizarding children, and that it isn’t uncommon for Muggleborns to only have their growth spurt after starting school, because their magic would not have been known and encouraged before that point.”
“Don’t you dare TOUCH HIM, you disgusting scum! Murderer!” She screamed again as she launched herself at Sirius, fingers outstretched like she fully intended to claw his eyes out.
“Association with the Dark Lord didn’t go down well, after the war ended. Quite a few people were tried and condemned. My mother’s sister and her husband are in Azkaban too.”
“You have, when you were very little, at a dinner or other.” Petunia said. “Patrick was flattered, but not really very interested in you. We lost touch after your father’s death.” She ruffled her son’s hair. “It’s not a big loss, I promise.”
“Or in the case of Hogwarts, it’s how the House-elves know where to bring your stuff, or how points get knocked off.” Fred added. “It’s like a fingerprint of your magic, of which the school holds the database.”
The excitement and wonder of being new to the team had faded – both for Hal and the rest of them. It had boosted their morale for sure, especially when Hal had returned with his Nimbus 2000 after Christmas.
“Whatever Potter’s part in this war is meant to be.” He concluded darkly. “He is too young. The war hasn’t broken out again yet.” There was no doubt for either of them that it would, eventually. “Leave him out of it.”
“Well.” Rolf said carefully. “None of the victims may have met the creature’s eyes directly. Colin Creevey had his camera in front of his face. Justin would have seen it though the Gryffindor ghost, and he’s, well, already dead. Hermione and Penelope had a mirror.”
, and attacked him in the same fashion, only to get annihilated by what looked from here like sheer dumb luck. He had been a baby, for God’s sake. How did anyone even believe for a second he’d had any kind of special power, any choice in the matter?
They’re out of character for 12 year-old boys, I know, and I don’t care because the ability to have mature conversations makes it a tad more interesting.
After much mayhem in preparing a picnic basket, they made their way to the shore and found a nice spot to sit down. Hal and Ley were out of their clothes and down to their swimsuits in seconds, running towards the lake like two young deer.
This wasn’t a negotiation either, and Pan knew he didn’t mean just the breakfast parlour. He put his napkin next to his plate, got up, and went to fetch the bags he’d packed days ago. Some essentials, and some comforts – not that much, all in all, that he wanted to take with him. The most important thing was the leather purse, filled with the coins he’d been putting aside ever since he’d made Snape the promise to come out to his parents.
Rolf nodded again, apparently unbothered, and Draco and Neville ran out the door and along the corridor, down the stairs that were thankfully there. They paused on the second floor, and Draco turned to Neville.
Which was what found him crying quietly by Hal’s bedside in the infirmary an hour later, distraught, guilty, and with no idea what to do, when Hal opened his eyes. Pomfrey had treated him as soon as she’d arrived on the pitch with a Wound-Cleaning Potion and a bandaging charm on his head, and had taken him back inside for a Blood-replenishing potion.
“It’s due to start sometime in August, I think probably towards the end of the month, so…” He shrugged. He didn’t want to think about it now, if he was honest. “Holidays first. But we thought we could maybe combine that with our shopping in Diagon, meet you guys that day?”
It must have shown, because Snape’s stance softened infinitesimally, going from repressed anger to mild confusion.
“It’s that little wizarding village that’s next to the school.” Dora told them. “From third year, you have Saturdays where you’re allowed to go there, there’s shops, cafés… You should get a permission slip with your letter.”
He didn’t think sass would put him in more trouble than he currently was. Probably? Both Quirrell and Voldemort seemed to have more pressing obsessions than asking him to watch his tone.
The rest of them followed him – Hermione trying to tell him it was rash and irresponsible and Neville whimpering vaguely, but they followed anyway. They quickly reached the forbidden corridor on the third floor – the stairs were very compliant with where they wanted to go, for once – and found the door ajar, a rumbling sound within.
Hal waved him off, and joined the rest of the team for the last “once more unto the breech” injunctions from Oliver.
“We are not taking seven of you to a Muggle hospital, no.” The professor told them sternly. “But Mister Potter will be discharged tomorrow, and you can rest assured that he is no longer in any danger.”
Draco gave him a distressed, disbelieving look, and realised part of him had still been hanging to the hope that this whole thing was just a big misunderstanding.
“Oh.” Now that the idea had been introduced, Hal suddenly felt very much like he wanted a hug. “She’ll be worried.” He thought out loud.
“I don’t think my nickname is what we need to focus on right now.” He pointed out. “Hagrid.” He said firmly, looking straight at the man. “We won’t tell on you or anything, but you can’t keep a dragon in your hut. Think about it. Even as little as he is now, he almost burned your house down. He will need more and more space. He will grow
He knew he hadn’t done anything himself to wrong Quirrell, but he was Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, so having an opinion about him was basically political positioning in the wizarding world. He’d legitimately seen an article questioning if the rise in ink and quills prices was due to his starting school, so who knew what national disaster the professor deemed he was responsible for.
“That’s cool.” Pan nodded. After a moment’s hesitation, he added: “I had a favour to ask your dad, actually. Well. A question first.”
He half wished he’d brought Little Sil, but he doubted cats would be welcome in the infirmary – let alone playful kittens. He’d be fine in the dorm. There was plenty to explore (Dean had learnt to close his trunk) and though Hal had tried to do it himself because he’d promised his aunt he’d be responsible, the castle fed him too. House elves, Draco had corrected him. Hal thought it was the same as the castle. In a corner of his feverish brain, he briefly wondered if cats could catch a cold.
Ron’s Christmas had been as typically chaotic as usual, and he mostly talked about how much food he’d had, and all the amazing things his mom could make. She usually went all out this time of year, to her children’s great delight, and there was so much left over at the end of it, Ron had actually warned them all in advance not to take any food for the journey, and had brought each of them a complete lunch box with sandwiches, homemade lemonade and lots, lots of sweet treats.
Hal could only blink, blinded by the flashes and completely unprepared for this turn of events. Fortunately, maybe, Lockhart did not seem to notice or care about his reaction, because he just blabbered on.
Once dressed in their new attires – and even Draco had to admit, he’d gotten as caught up in as the others, and they were having a lot of fun – Pansy distributed the hair and they drunk the potion, which was honest to Merlin the most disgusting thing Draco had ever put in his mouth (and that included a snails and sprouts purée he’d had to stomach when once staying with a distant French relative of his mother’s).
“Yeah, well it started like now. Threats on the walls, attacks, petrification. And…” He paused, wincing.
Hal had his death predicted to him seven different times, and involuntarily riled up the professor when he commented that Oh yeah, he’d met a big black dog over the summer actually, he’d been very friendly. Apparently it was death omen though, and Trelawney almost howled, tears filling her eyes, as she went on about how brave he was, welcoming death like a friend. Hal was doing no such thing, but he was too busy elbowing Ron in the ribs (who could barely breathe from laughing so hard) to have an argument about it with her.
She leaned in for a hug and a kiss, and repeated she’d see him soon, before heading out to find McGonagall before she left.
“Boys!” Draco’s mother eventually called them after hours of zooming about on brooms, both attempting to explain the rules of Quidditch to Ley and to play something called ‘football’ when they were on the ground (Draco remembered Hal, Dean and Seamus going on about it once, it sounded very complicated) and all in all just having the time of their life.
“It’s because he’s actually good, while you wouldn’t catch a Snitch if it came flying into your face! You are an utter disgrace of a Seeker!”
Draco blinked, allowing his mouth to hang open for as long as Hal was looking at his shoes. He closed it when Hal looked up, a worried frown creasing his brow.
“They’re just waffles.” Hal had replied distractedly, already looking at the rest. “So the trial starts at 11, but Draco and I will need to be there at 10-”
They muttered some goodbyes, and Draco headed out. In doing so, he walked past where Flint and other older students were seated. The former looked up, and grinned at him again.
And he told Ley about the magic mirror, which had shown him what could have been. He hadn’t mentioned it six months previous, the emotions still too raw, and then quite a lot had happened in between and it had kind of slipped his mind, until Ley had spoken those two words.
Hal and Ley ran back towards the house, almost tripping over their own feet, and Petunia came out of the study with a look of panic.
“What the fuck.” Anthony blurted out. He sounded more shaken than Hal had ever heard him sound - that boy was
They found the right department after some wandering about, and a thin, kind-looking wizard got them to sit down in a small office. He seemed delighted to assist
“Going home tomorrow.” She sounded like she was looking forward to it, too. “You’ll get to rest during the holidays, right?”
Sometimes Petunia wondered if things would have been different if she had picked up more on James’ genuine worry that something was
Inevitably, his gaze slipped to Hal’s forehead. Self-conscious, he put a hand over the hair covering it.
“Alright.” Pansy looked at his hand like it was covered in something sticky and didn’t touch it, looking half disgusted and half confused, but she smiled as Draco kicked her ankle. “I’m Pansy. I bloody hate it to, but what can I do.”
I hope you liked this installment are are looking forward to the next – I know I am. Unfortunately, it’s not written yet. I’ve made a start, but there’s a lot to be done. My plan is to work on it and post it before my baby’s born, as I know I won’t have much time (or energy) for fic after that, and they’ll be a hiatus in my activity for a bit. So hopefully, I can deliver the rewrite of Prisoner of Azkaban before the end of March, and I’ll do my best to pick up the next book whenever motherhood lets me!
“She’s still little.” Narcissa said fondly, stroking the owl’s – her – belly. “But she’s young, she’ll grow a bit. She’s a hawk owl.”
“Could be.” Hermione nodded, in a way that indicated quite clearly that theory had been thought of, analysed and dismissed already. “But I’ve checked all those dates.”
“I agree.” Hal said, earning himself a slightly surprised look from Ron. “Though I’m not sure what they’re going to be able to do.”
! This is exceptional.” He beamed. “Unfortunately of course, the shock and trauma caused you to be a little confused as to what happened. But I am sure you will be very grateful for my heroic actions even if you can’t fully remember them.”
Hal realised himself that maybe he himself hadn’t taken the events very seriously, until now, but the fact that it was Hermione...
Hal shrugged. He wished it too – true stories, not the ones from all those people who knew the wizard who knew the witch who’d cut Lily’s hair once. But he didn’t want his aunt to feel guilty about it, and he’d stopped asking her to tell him more about his parents when he was about seven, after he’d realised it was paining her.
There was a pause, and when it became clear Hal wasn’t asking the question Dumbledore wanted him to ask, the old wizard asked it for him.
“Right away, Master Draco!” The creature said enthusiastically, before another crack, and it was gone.
“Likes music.” Hal murmured, looking at the harp that had apparently been enchanted to play, presumably to have this soporific effect on the beast.
“So you’ve been chosen. You don’t want it, well, tough. You’ve been dealt this lot, there’s nothing you can do about it but chose what to do with it. You’d rather be ordinary? You can’t. What does that leave you with? Do nothing, which is an option, sure. Or would you want to make the world a better place with whatever tools you have?”
“Draco?” Hal didn’t mean to interrupt him, but visions from his dream still danced behind his closed eyelids – damn, he’d closed his eyes again – and it seemed like he had to ask.
Draco turned an embarrassed look to Hal in particular. “He’s my godfather.” He confessed. “So I’ll talk to him.”
“Mother, is it wrong to feel…” He started thoughtfully, then interrupted himself, but she encouraged him with a kind look. “It’s just…” He took a breath. “I did love father, and... I know you miss him.”
-	This fic redeems Petunia and Dudley, be prepared to (hopefully) like them. They’re truly Harry’s family.
Just as if he hadn’t endangered the life of a student (again), Lockhart started making shepherding movements towards the students saying “Come now, come now, give him space” cheerfully, while Hooch crouched next to Hal to start stemming the blood flow.
This year was different. He had been feeling a lot more depressed, in the run up to the date, and while he realised that he was probably a little (a lot) homesick and that not being able to dress up with Ley and stuff their faces full of sweets watching horror films did take a lot of fun out of the holiday, he wasn’t sure why it mattered so much. Sure, being in the world his parents had been a part of made a difference, he had been hearing their names a lot more, and that was part of it, but that was a constant. So he wasn’t sure why exactly he felt, now specifically, on the verge of a panic attack, affected by the date to an extent he had never been before. It wasn’t as if he remembered being there.
“Such a shame.” Riddle spoke quietly. “It was a great effort, Harry. But you’ll be dead in under a minute.”
“Sometimes it is.” Hal reasoned. “Sometimes it is, because words alone would not get through the thick skull of someone like that
Hal was briefly surprised that they knew each other, but he supposed wizards were a lot fewer and more closely connected than Muggles were, what with there being
“We’re having a family reunion of sorts.” He said. “The Court’s decision on whether to restore my assets to me is on the fifth of May, so whatever happens, we thought it might be good to discuss it between us remaining living Blacks. And it will be nice to catch up. Cissy’s invited us all to the Manor on the eighth, she got Draco a special dispensation to be allowed to go home for the weekend, and Andy and her family are coming over from France.”
Hermione pursed her lips, like she was trying not to beam, but Hal could take she was chuffed, and she gave in and broke into a laugh when he grabbed her for a one-armed hug.
“Let’s see.” The man breathed out as he pulled a large ledger. “P, Parkinson… Pince… Podmore… Potter! Main account holder, Potter, Harry James, other access to vault…” He looked up with somewhat of a wince. “None.”
Hal had cleared a shelf in his room to lay out all their notes and small gifts, from the first ones they’d all sent over with his stuff when he was still at the hospital. It reminded him daily that he was home safe, and that he’d be back at school soon and be safe there, surrounded by people who loved him in both cases. It kept him sane. After all, though that sounded a bit sad, he’d been through this before, he knew he’d be fine in a while – though he wondered, sometimes, if PTSD was cumulative.
“Oh.” He blinked. No wonder he felt more rested than the few hours he thought he’d slept. “I’m sorry.” He felt like he needed to add.
“I didn’t think I’d say this, ever.” Draco commented lightly. “But I’m starting to miss the giant initial.”
His mother smiled knowingly, extending her arm and the owl towards him. “You can name her.” She said by way of confirmation.
“Oh, Hal makes sense.” She whispered to herself, and blushed when she saw his raised eyebrow. “Sorry, I heard your brother call you that and I wondered what it was short for.”
(and then had to explain it was a series of books, and nothing personal), Neville a box of cauldron cakes and Draco a family tree in a cool typeset showing how they were related, to Ron’s great horror (third cousins, once removed).
Hal saw a breach in the crowd and disappeared into a corridor, confident he hadn’t been seen. There were footsteps following him but he suspected one of his friends, going by the lack of angry shouting for him to
Hermione rolled her eyes, but she was smiling. “She made the case with the Ministry – apparently it’s not the first time it’s been granted, it just takes some doing. The initial agreement is I use it until Halloween, when we have to decide if we want to carry on with the classes we’ve picked or drop some of them. We’ll sort of have to apply again for me to use it for the rest of the year if I want to keep attending at least two that are on the same slot.”
Contritely, they both apologised to the Matron, who checked Hal over, and decreted he was good as new and could go, though made him promise to come back at the first sign of headaches, nausea, trouble with his sight (Hal clearly bit back a comment there, probably related to the fact he was already blind as a bat without his glasses) or any unusual mood or behavioural changes.
“What was that?” Hermione was the first to recover enough to ask, her need for knowledge clearly overcoming any emotions felt in the past few minutes.
He straightened again, having made his point, and turned a cordial smile to the rest of the Slytherins around the table. Most of their mouths were hanging open in stunned silence, except maybe Blaise and Pan who were pursing their lips to contain their glee.
But there were good times as well – most of the school, even people who hadn’t been particularly friendly before or fans of Hal’s, either showed them support, recognising the potential trauma of what they had been through, and/or admired them for their courage and thanked them for “saving the school”. More importantly, the mandrakes had finally matured, and the potion had been brewed, and the petrified people were able to be revived. Hal and Draco ended up getting out of the infirmary at the same time as them, and the first thing they did, the two of them, Hermione and the other three of their friends, was spend a good ten minutes in a massive group hug.
Draco didn’t let that unsettle him for too long, as they climbed into the boats taking them across the lake. Somehow the four of them sat together, without even thinking about it, and Draco thought,
They were standing at the top of the stairs leading up to the dungeons, waiting for Draco, and Hal had spaced out.
Ley snorted behind him, but Lockhart ignored the sass – or it didn’t deter him – and marched right up to him.
He gave the gamekeeper a pointed look. He didn’t seem to care, or worry that the gigantic man could squash him like a bug. Or set a big dog on him. Or even a dragon, for that matter. Even if the students knew Hagrid was harmless – he was around the castle often enough, saying hello, telling people to stop calling him
“I think.” Hal said, catching his breath, and surprising himself with this moment of lucidity. “I think that was the third floor corridor on the right hand side.”
He had gotten his arse handed to him the one (and only) time he’d played chess against Ron, and it wasn’t because he was bad – Anthony was clever, and could hold his own at chess. Ron was just particularly good.
“I don’t have a pet.” Hal managed to slot in. “My aunt always had a strict no-pet policy, we weren’t even allowed a goldfish after what happened to… Never mind that.”
, which made Ron comment it was no wonder she couldn’t make friends. Anthony told her to ignore him, and proceeded that day with using all the most obscure words he could slot into normal conversation (though the conversation quickly stopped being normal, and at several points in the day Hal couldn’t breathe for laughing too hard).
“I’ve got its twin.” Sirius explained. “It’s a means of communication. If we’re both looking at the same time, we can talk and everything. James and I used to use these a lot during our many escapades.”
“Stay here while I fetch Minerva.” Snape told them tiredly at the end of his lecture. “She will decide of the adequate punishment for you, Mister Potter. Draco.” He added more softly. “If you don’t mind staying behind, I’d like to talk to you.”
She smiled at him kindly. “It's a nice coincidence.” She agreed, and played along. “What did he get you for your birthday then?”
“For remarkable level-headedness allowing them both, in different ways, to use their skills and knowledge to protect their friends against danger, I award thirty points to Rolf Scamander, and thirty points to Neville Longbottom.”
Draco’s mother collected the used Portkey they had owled Hal for him to travel, and put it back on the mantelpiece – it was an old clay vase Draco had made when he was six, shortly after his father’s death, and he had no idea why she’d kept it, it was hideous. She kept saying it was useful to charm into a Portkey at a moment’s notice, but really she could have used anything.
Just another note as we are only a few chapters short of the end of this opus. Book 2 is under way, but I've struggled to get it started, because, well, it kind of doesn't happen without Lucius and Vernon. Harry's birthday forgotten and miserable? Doesn't happen. The whole mess with Dobby? Doesn't happen. Harry not getting his letters? Getting broken out by the Weasleys because he's locked in his room? Missing the train and flying there in the car? Lucius slipping Ginny the diary and therefore the ENTIRE PLOT? Well, as you can imagine, I've had to find other ways to make it happen, and it's taking me some time to write. I just hope I can start posting without too much of a gap between books. Don't hesitate to share some of your ideas!
I know James’ parents are meant to have seen him get married to Lily, but I like the idea (so to speak) that he matured in his seventh year at Hogwarts partly because his parents died…
“Honestly, Petunia.” Marge said to her as if she’d had the poor taste to pick him out in a home furnishing store. “Are you sure he’s even British?”
“Let me change your mind.” Niels insisted, putting his hands in Hal’s neck again and drawing him in for a kiss.
“Millicent Bulstrode tripped me in the courtyard and I fell into a pillar.” Luna finally gave him the full account, with a resigned sigh. “I wasn’t looking where I was going.”
Hagrid explained to them how, when he was himself a Hogwarts student, the events currently unfolding in the school had been happening too – which they already knew from Blaise’s gossip, but somehow getting a first-hand confirmation made them all feel a lot more uncomfortable. And as another student had caught him with ‘Aragog’, he’d believed it was him attacking the student, and Hagrid had been expelled. Incidentally, the attacks had stopped after that, but Dumbledore had never believed Hagrid had been guilty of harming anyone, and had offered him a home and a job on the grounds.
“Well.” Anthony grinned. “You know how they say rooming in pairs rather than in dorms fosters studying.”
“But if you’d stayed.” Hal carried on. “I wouldn’t have my aunt and my cousin, and I can’t accept your apology for something that would have deprived me of them.”
His only distraction would be going shopping – they always went on Christmas Eve with his mother, gathering trinkets for people he didn’t care about and she wanted to either subtly impress or subtly insult, and usually he followed along taking advantage of the holiday spirit to get her to buy him a few things he wanted. But this year, he actually had his own gifts to buy, and he was looking forward to that.
Anthony snorted, Hermione looked generally disapproving, and Neville shook his head, amused, though Draco suspected he secretly rather admired Blaise for his brashness and Dementor-may-care attitude.
“I used to think Wizards were so, so superior.” She continued, her eyes sad, but with something like unexpected warmth at the bottom of them. “But here you are. A Muggle woman, who raised her boy as a Muggle, and…”
Hagrid was standing a few paces off, looking extremely sheepish, holding his dog’s nape with one hand and a suspiciously moving bundle of wet rags in the other arm.
“Excuse me.” Draco suddenly got up from the table – he seemed to be shaking – and made his way out of the Great Hall.
“Guys.” Ron intervened again, and since last time he had used that voice, they were about to get their heads bitten off by a giant dog, they all fell quiet and turned to him.
Something has occurred here at Hogwarts that will make our overall plan go much smoother and faster. I believe that Hogwarts is really and truly ours. The only problem we have is Dumbledore. All the teachers bar him have sworn loyalty to me and me only. Every … single … one … of … them. I was wondering if they could come by during the winter holidays to meet the family before the bonding ceremony. Christmas is two weeks away now, and I can’t wait to see everyone again.
Wu opened his mouth angrily and Amelia raised one hand with a finger fully extended in the traditional ‘wait’ sign as the other lifted a mug of sweet-scented tea to her lips. When the mug had been lowered to around chest height, Amelia looked at the man with an eyebrow raised.
The four marked Weasley males sank into their chairs at the kitchen table as the inferno that was Molly Weasley ignited in the sitting room and aimed all her flames at her youngest son and his girlfriend. For a while, no one said anything. Tobias then swallowed the last bite of his breakfast, cleared his throat, drank the rest of his pumpkin juice and looked at Ginny.
A flare of green flames drew the attention of all in the room. From them stepped a cold Remus, a smirking Severus and, moments later, a livid Harry. All motion in the room stopped.
Albus Dumbledore was not in a good mood. The past three weeks had been good. Harry (and he is Harry damn it, not whatever it is the brat was calling himself this week) and Severus weren’t talking and he hadn’t needed to do anything to cause it. Then, at breakfast this morning, the bastard of a child had to go and ruin it all by hugging the man! Now the two of them were closer than before. To make matters even worse, he had received a letter from the Ministry stating that he was to expect the officials who were going to be investigating him in the following three days. Every name on the list was against him becoming the Headmaster of the school for some reason or another and all wold jump at the chance to evict him from his rightful place. He growled in irritation: The day had started off in such a wonderful way as well.
“I think there are lower odds on Hagrid being the offspring of a goblin or a dwarf then there is of this meeting being called for happy news,” Charlie said with a grim smile.
“I am sick of needing to watch both my actions and my words while around people. Just because I am pregnant does not mean that I am a fucking pansy! I am hormonal yes, but that doesn’t mean that I am delicate like you told the lady watching us for our exam – yes I heard that. And while I’m on the subject of exams, how DARE you tell every instructor there that they needed to ensure that there is at least half a metre distance between Draco and me at all times! You are lucky that Fudge had already told the instructors that under NO circumstances were Draco and I to be separated while in those rooms unless absolutely necessary. Yes, I woke up that morning with Draco’s prick up my arse –“
Draco chuckled as he remembered Severus’ face when he realised Tobias was taking notes on his teaching style, the comments he made – both in class and on the marked assignments – as well as the student’s marks, reactions and their strong and weak points in each assignment.
“He was so defiant when I found him. He may have had everything taken from him, but he was defiant til the end. Never stopped insulting the pig of a man he was supposed to call ‘Uncle’ – Not even when the rat’s arsed piece of child molesting niffler shit tried to rape him again did he stop fighting.”
“You bring shame to yourself and dishonour to the Patil family,” Padma stated firmly. “You called a respected member of an old and ancient house a derogative term, without proof I might add, before his pregnant bonded; You knowingly disrespected a powerful man who is not only the heir of more than one family with more power to their name than our own, but is pregnant with the heir of another. Soon after this you insulted the two biggest names in the business world by insinuating that they are of lesser worth than you and finally, you sully your own honour by challenging the Patriarch of your family and accusing him of selling his own child into slavery.”
“I wish to form an alliance.  I do not wish to fight you anymore. I haven’t wanted to since half way through last year.”
“Semolina I believe,” Draco said with a fond resigned chuckle, “With apple and cinnamon. From the disapproving look he had, I think he has concluded that the taste combinations you have been having lately are a crime against kitchen elves so has decided that simple foods with delicate tastes are on the menu these net few days.”
“Your son’s: he wanted to make quadruple sure that all influence of those herbs is out of every house you have visited since the day you got them.”
Dumbledore sat back, slightly scared. “I’ll not start on Severus,” he mumbled to himself, moving towards the door. “I’d best start with the Slytherin’s themselves.” He left, leaving the room in a buzz of conversation as the portraits spoke about that odd meeting.
Tobias stood in once spot until a fae-light fell on him and a song with a bouncy tune started to play. He heard Draco’s laughter as he danced around the area before the bed. The laughter stopped, however, when Tobias seated himself on Draco’s lap, his hips still gyrating to the beat of the music.
“This means Draco and I can’t go to lunch in four days, doesn’t it?” Tobias asked, resigned. He and Draco had decided to take Melody to the Ministry to introduce her to Cornelius, Amelia and Achalendra. The man was going to be back in England for only the one day to talk to the Minister about his transfer to the Indian Ministry for a year and to catch up with his daughter and her intended.
Hermione shakily wrote her essay, face pale. Not one of the spells she, Ron and the Headmaster had cast at Harry near the end of last year was in the books found in the general library. The more spells she researched, the sicker she felt, until she had to run out of the library with hands over her mouth. She had used spells worse than the Unforgivables, which was disgusting – but what is worse was that she had used them on a friend – Her best friend – willingly. She would beg his forgiveness for this for the rest of her life and she would take her punishment without question. She just hoped that it didn’t get any worse, but by look of the book the Deputy Headmistress took, she knew it was going to get worse – so very much worse.
“What is that?” Lucius asked wrinkling his nose in disgust as the dark-haired teen put a large amount of the glop on the fish.
For the first time, Hermione felt worried about being right. “I ... I d-do promise,” she faulted. A snake of magic slithered around the grasped hands, binding them together. Minerva stood.
She glared at the gaping idiots around here, “The Slytherins only attacked us when we provoked them. My fiancée was a Slytherin and he got KILLED in an attack that was labelled ‘a prank gone wrong’. My niece’s mother was a Slytherin and she was the sweetest person you could ever hope to meet. Now, I don’t care if you are Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws, Gryffindors or Slytherins, you are going to stand in line outside the tent you have been assigned in the order I called your names and you will NOT open your mouths to complain, swear, argue or anything that is not yawning, sneezing or answering questions. Anyone who goes against this will be undergoing punishment from this Council due to you endangering other students, us and yourself as well as wasting the time we have in this investigation.”
“The young lady is now unable to carry a child full term due to internal spell damage,” Minerva stated with a wince. “The son removed himself from the family and took on his wife’s maiden name and revealed that not only was his wife’s family the owner of his father’s workplace, but they were the fifth richest family in the Americas when they told him they were cutting all money from him.”
His ramblings were interrupted by a smooth laugh. “I get it Bi. When do you think you’ll have time to do all this?”
“Not exactly, Lady Zleva. I request that all students be gathered by year before getting a thorough health check from an experienced Healer. I talked it over with the head Healer from St Mungos and she agreed to send though a handful of competent Healers if we agreed.”
After removing her toys and healing the damage they had caused, Luna checked the red-haired teen’s vital signs before indicating to Neville that she needed help returning him to his bed.
“Congratulations,” Severus stated in a dry, cool voice. “You just successfully weathered a very mild mood swing.”
“This is the official copy,” he said with a chuckle. “That gets framed and put into an office or bedroom or hallway. The one being posted is for your portfolio.”
“The natural male pregnancy is harsher. The second week after conception is the first indication that a male is a natural bearer. He gets lethargic, has trouble eating and waking and he may start to feel queasy. In men with strong magic or a strong bond to their partner there could be a few days when they become non-responsive while their body adjusts and their magic forms a bond to the magic of the foetus.”
“You will be doing a great deal, as this job is … intense. I need you two girls to go over the castle recording how many rooms are no longer being used, what you think the room was used as and list the items in the room. While in each room, you are to clean it to the best of your ability and sketch it the way it looked when you first arrived. Take photos before and after you remove or clean out something so that you have proof of what you found. Do up tables of each area and write what you find in that area and what condition it is in. Everything you find that isn’t furniture is to be packed into boxes. When each box is full, you stop and one of you brings the box to a room that I will have set aside specially for them. The boxes will be labelled with what room and which area the stuff came from. I will have another box appear so you can continue.
Harry laughed. “You are right, Mr Malfoy, but it is a tribute to the deaths of the Harry Potter and Fawkes of the past, and since the new Harry is dedicated to the death of three certain individuals, it also symbolizes what path my newfound life will take, starting with a weaselby, a chipmunk disguised as a witch and a meddlesome, soon-to-be-ex-headmaster of Hogwarts.”
“He does that very well, doesn’t he?” Millicent asked softly, her voice sounding just as green as she looked.
“I know and I trust our Alpha to take care of us and our well-being but … did they have to give me Pavarti?” he sneered.
“What are the plans for today?” Neville asked The Pack as the student body gradually returned to normal.
With a final glare at the man who she had looked up to for most of her life, she spun and stormed towards the Hall. When she heard something muttered, she turned in time to hear her ex-mentor throw an obliviate at her, which caught her in her chest. As the spell started to work, she felt her mind being pulled back and covered in a crimson dome of magic that vanished as soon as the spell’s effects vanished.
“SHIT! He’s going into psychological and metaphysical shock!” Severus yelled, before running to Harry’s side.
“After all,” Tobias continued with a soft smile, “you cannot have a proper girl’s night without Pansy and Millicent – and since it is a Friday night, how about inviting the younger year girls as well? I’m sure Dobby will know of a trust-worthy elf that will take care of your food and drink needs for the night.”
“A moment before you continue with your morning,” Minerva called out as she stood. “As classes are cancelled until further notice, your Professors will spend today setting a list of things each year level will need to cover by themselves. I will also be setting aside time in my day for each year level for a tutorial if anyone needs aid. I believe your other Professors will also do the same. You are all responsible for picking up those worksheets and guidelines yourself AFTER you are through your appointment with the Healer.”
“What!” Draco’s voice made the three men jump.  Turning to look at him, they saw him hurry from the room.  Following him, they watched as he floo’d into Severus’ study.  Severus and Lucius looked at each other in confusion.
Tobias broke down, crying harder than he’d ever done in his life. “I tried everything to get them to stop, even going as far as promising to take his place and do so without any trouble or freakishness if they stop and leave him alone, but they just laugh and hurt him more. I can’t stop them from hurting him and it keeps on going until one night on of Vernon’s customers pulls a knife out and starts blood games. H-He cuts in t-too deep and I watch him bleed to death, on my bed while someone who doesn’t love him fucks him.”
“Now, if you will please excuse me, I have a red-head to prepare for. Anyone know of a fire-proof room?” He left with the sound of laughter in his ears and the sight of a pouting blonde.
“I will be submitting my memories of that day,” Lucius stated, “as are Randal, Remus Lupin and my wife. I have no doubt that Severus will as well.”
“Both sexes keep house; after all,” he continued, “Who in their right mind would shame their family for releasing a non self-sufficient being into their society?”
“What are everyone’s plans for tonight?” Tobias asked softly after pushing the almost completely empty bowl away from him.
“Shut your filthy mouth, Boy! That headmaster at that Freak School of yours has finally admitted what we’ve been telling you all this time.  You’re nothing but a useless freak.  First you get your parents killed, they you get that other freak killed, followed by that Godfather of yours and yet you still failed to get yourself killed in the process.  He was right to give us full disciplinarian rights for a delinquent like you.”  More fabric was torn, or cut, out of Severus’ sight.
The other three founders, Draco, Severus and Remus winced, not knowing how Tobias was going to react.
The morning of the start of the investigation found one Hermione Granger curled up in her bed, hiding from the other girls in her dormitory. The news that she had been branded had spread like wildfire through the school and not a single person wanted to be seen with her. If she was to be honest with herself, it wasn’t the being alone that bothered her – after all, twelve of her seventeen years alive she has been alone. No, it wasn’t being alone that bother her at all; it was the fact that the pure-bloods had been correct. As a muggleborn she had no rights. Everyone treated her as if she had leprosy – all because of something that had been forced onto her.
He leant over and gave Draco a kiss on the corner of his mouth. “I’m going up to our room. If Dobby doesn’t foresee it, for once, can you direct him there?”
The Pack seemed to relax then tense as they turned to the other adults I the room. “So what are we going to do about Miss Bufo Marinus?” Luna asked in a sickly sweet voice that made those who knew of the girl’s treatment of one Ronald Weasley to shudder. Everyone one of them could tell the blonde female had many ideas – none of which would end happily … for the victim, that is.
“Tell them that no matter what we decided, they have my blessing to begin once they’ve all been checked.”
Tobias was seated on the floor in the Slytherin common room with Draco running his fingers through his hair. Tobias almost purred in ecstasy.
“How do you know?” Severus asked, taking the opportunity to pull Tobias against him and run a calming hand through his godson’s hair. Everyone sighed in relief when Tobias calmed and cuddled into the older man.
Draco lost control and laughed till he fell back onto the cot. “I – I can’t be – believe you just did that. Y – you sh –should have seen the looks on everyone’s faces when y – you mentioned my cock buried in your arse! I’m so going to have to put that memory into a pensieve and play it in the Great Hall after showing our family!”
Salazar smiled. “You’ve got a lot on your mind – so don’t worry about it. Kitten , show them that day, please.”
“Not too,” Draco answered as they lifted their heads. “But we do it anyway in respect for your position. You know this Zog, so why do you keep insisting we not do it?”
“Yes, dikos mou lykos. Have I changed that much?”  As everyone nodded, a phoenix appeared and landed on Harry’s shoulder.  Severus forced himself to breathe as he noticed it was Fawkes, but that he’d changed. He was now the colour of sapphires, emeralds and onyx, with clear silver-green eyes that made you think of the ocean after a thunderstorm.
Both Slytherins swore heatedly and sped up slightly. Neither of them wanted to miss out on today’s activities.
“Thank you for holding this for me Amelia,” he said. “Now I won’t panic when I can’t find them.” He stood and strode out, oozing confidence, but she finally saw through the mask and saw the real man behind it.
“Listen to me. NO! I am not going to eat. I’ve told you, if I eat, I’ll throw up. If you force me to eat and I throw up, then there is going to be trouble, because I can’t just wave my wand and vanish it, because I can’t use my magic, so …”
Draco, Neville and Millicent walked from the practical room as Greg, Vince, Pansy, Blaise, Theo and Tobias handed in their written exams. Tobias’ morning sickness had vanished after they had arrived at the Ministry – as had the hormonal person Draco had woken beside.
Tobias rose, looking down his nose at the older blonde male with disdain. “A house-elf represents the family he or she serves. If the Master or Mistress is happy with their elf, it shows in how that elf appears to others. The will be neater, less hyperactive and will have better control over their spoken grammar. There are many upsides to this: The biggest – to me as an expectant Mother – is that my child will compare Dobby’s speech to those of his fellows and see that I expect him or her to uphold the standards that our household has set. My child will NOT be learning bad speech patterns through the family help.”
With one last wave, he used one of the privileges of being Minister of Magic and apparated out of the building to his own house’s front yard. Blinking to clear his vision of the little white spots that had appeared in his travels, he waved and smiled sheepishly in the direction of his neighbour’s voice and almost skipped with happiness to his door, where Tiddles – his house elf and the son of Kretcher – was waiting with a pot of tea and a plate of food that was both good for him and tastier than what most wizards ate.
Bowing slightly in respect for her, Neville followed the three Slytherins, leaving his Grandmother in the library with tears of pride and joy gathering in her eyes.
Tobias re-read the letter and couldn’t stop the smirk from taking over his face. This was just what he needed! Without a second thought, he reached for a quill and parchment and started to write.
A thin man bowed shallowly from his spot on the Dias, looking out of place in his expensive – but definitely muggle – three-piece suit, tie and glaringly brilliant shirt and shoes.” And Zleva Williams.”
Tobias sighed. “You weren’t told about it because no matter what, I’m going to take over from one of them, and Draco the other. It’s been permanent since I was four. It also only comes into effect once both my and Draco’s hearts no longer beat. When I said we were going to take over from them, we are. We will be first and second defenders of the Natural World. One will be night, the other day.” Tobias stretched.
“I think we are going to try for another two exams before calling it a night. The three awake people jumped at the sleepy voice.
“Five,” a soft male voice interrupted her, startling everyone into staring at the Potions Master, who was lost in his own memories. “One around each wrist, one around each ankle and one around his neck. The old man had him collared like a common mutt.” The man’s voice was soft and distant, almost sad as he spoke of what he had seen.
With a wave of her wand, a series of silencing charms were activated. With another wave a metal table steaming with cold rose from the floor to stop five inches below Ronald’s prone form while another four blade positioned themselves two inches above each of his hips and each of his shoulders.
Remus laughed and nodded. “He did, first night there too. I hope you’re ready for school Draco. You’re going to have to last for two weeks.”
His voice changed as he went back to what he was saying to the group. “Then there was the snake thing with Ron’s father.  The cream of the crop though, was Siri going through the veil.”
“It is not only the children that have suffered I’m afraid,” Amelia stated. “It was bought to my attention last night that while under the control of Headmasters Dippett and Dumbledore, the building and grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry have been neglected and purposefully used in ways that endanger the lives of those within her allowed halls.”
Tobias giggled softly and turned the chair around so he could hug his husband tightly. “I love you,” he whispered.
“Because I would have killed him with my bare hands for doing that to you. I was prepared to do it the day Sev came to us for help. The only reason I didn’t do anything about it was because I heard the Dark Lord promise the muggles to Remus, and I didn’t want to be the one to make him loose control of this wolven side.”
Remus struggled to keep a pouting face but failed as he started laughing. “We are bigger children then our godchildren,” he managed to wheeze. His eyes turned soft as he looked at his lover. “I’ve missed this Sev,” he stated softly. “I’ve missed your playful side. I miss YOU being you. I never see you without your masks on, I admit it is mostly my own fault for taking you and our relationship for granted.”
Tom, Lucius and Severus seated themselves with Tobias curled into a ball at Tom’s side. “You seem to be doing a really good job of everything here, so I was hoping that you will be able to help me with some of my grading. I have to have the surprise tests marked and the assignments I requested for before the holidays marked and graded for the first day back. I was hoping you’d do the marking of the tests and the first, and maybe second year assignments.”
“Go talk to Pateras!” Tobias snapped. “I’m trying to do something that most people take for granted!”
Raithia bowed deeply to him. ~ Greetings young one. You are a fit mate for the Heir. Your magical power balances his out. May your gaze kill and your venom grow stronger by the day.~
Severus nodded and stood quickly, not quiet hiding his worry. Silently he led the way to his rooms. Before he could ask anything, Draco started on him.
The Pack waited patiently at the doors leading into the Dark Lord’s domain. They were all dressed in the same thing with the only difference being a minor one. This uniform – a design created by their Alpha – consisted of a long-sleeved kimono-style bronze shirt tied at the right hip for the females, the left for the males, with long black dragon leather pants with a copper snake curled up the leg opposite that of the shirt’s tie. The top button on the pants doubled as the snake’s eye. The pants were topped with a narrow silver belt with a black snake buckle. Small pockets in the top of the belt hid important items, such as floo powder, shrunken potions vials filled with various potions, shrunken water canisters. Stone and flint and food dried so thoroughly it had to be chewed for hours before swallowing were also added – as Tobias said, they never know what would occur if their wand was ever removed from them in a fight, or worse – snapped, and they were in an uninhabited area.
Both Draco and Severus blinked in surprise. When had the boy had the time to research ancient bonding rules?
“Bi, listen to me. None of what he did to you matters in the cause of my loving you. A muggle cannot take the virginity of some magical unless they are married. To the wizarding world, a witch or wizard is only classified as being deflowered if the witch or wizard involved gives consent with heart, mind and soul. You are still pure in every way until the day you give yourself to someone sexually.”
Harry shrugged. “That he was a strict teacher. One who would be hard to impress and who wouldn’t stand for the mumbo-jumbo bullshit of children unwilling to take him or his classes seriously. I also was under the impression that he disliked me.”
“Luna on the other hand is quiet the quandary. She reacted well to the healing spell, but the blood replenishers I give to her aren’t working all that well. I don’t know if it is because she has built up immunity to them or if she is allergic to one of the ingredients in it. Neville and Pansy have taken it upon themselves to write Xenophillous and inform him of what has happened and ask about her reaction to the potion. At the moment, she is comfortably wrapped in Tobias’ arms, deeply asleep.”
Severus couldn’t keep himself from staring at the transfiguration teacher in shock. The other teachers were silent.
“His plan was to have me destroy you and then for him to destroy me, or have us destroy each other and have him deliver the killing blow to the survivor, as a mercy stroke, of course.”
Tobias sighed. “I assume that it is important that we be there. Why he couldn’t have just waited til lunch and sent it with Thanatos, I have no idea.”
“I’m assuming he is talking about seeing a Ron Weasley that isn’t eating,” Pansy stated in amusement.
“Okay Pack, you heard the man- into Alpha and Beta’s rooms!” Neville called and all members of The Pack left the ballroom, followed closely by Remus, Severus, Narcissa, Lucius, Minerva and Madam Longbottom.
Narcissa narrowed her eyes at Tobias – the first warning sign. “And how does it affect any female that eats it?”
Severus blinked in surprise when he walked into his office. Parchment was everywhere and his dark-haired godson was writing furiously, looking constantly at the parchment around him.
“Uncle Algie, Mr Jones. Mr Jones, this is my Uncle Algie. He’s an ex-healer from St Mungos. He’s specialized in pre-natal care of both male and female pregnancies.”
He reached out for his brother and Alpha through his bond with them for support. After getting a replying pulse of energy, he continued.
“Tobias, you are going to go into my office and work on the assignments I have written on the desk. I will ensure that every student will be properly cleaned of potion fumes before leaving here.”
“He was so light – all skin and bone. He couldn’t eat without throwing up.” He chuckled lightly. “When I came back from Malfoy Manor, I found that my house-elves had surrounded him and kept trying to force him to eat. In the end he threatened to sic Granger on them with her S.P.E.W campaign to get them away from him – this was after threatening me with a painful castration. It made the Dark Lord laugh.”
Here's the next chapter up, my lovelies! It's only a short one, but it doesn't mean I love it less :3
“Just the letter from Remus,” he sighed, running his hand gently through the hair of the teen whose head was on his lap. “He’s apologised for his treatment of the past three weeks towards me. He doesn’t want me to reply to the letter due to something he wants to talk about face to face. The only thing I’m sure of is that our relationship has changed and I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not.”
“Now, now, you three don’t look at me like that. Is it my fault that you didn’t spell yourselves, or each other, against dust? You all knew we were going to the Chamber and that no one has been there since my second year. You should have used your heads like the Slytherin’s you’re supposed to be instead of following trustingly like Hufflepuffs!” The three adults blushed in embarrassment.
“Can you explain something to me?” Blaise asked. Everyone turned to look at him. “Why is he getting the sickness, cravings and other symptoms now rather than them starting later like other pregnancies?”
“You mean to tell me that somehow Albus Dumbledore managed to escape capture from the Aurors and they only just now decided to tell the rest of the Ministry?” Tom asked incredulously.
Tobias picked at the food before him, finding no interest in the fried leftovers of the day before. He glared at the plate, hoping that it would somehow disappear. Bill yelped as the plate by his hand caught fire. Everyone watched as Tobias stormed out of the room.
Tobias and Draco exchanged amused looks. “We completed our bonding and no one will be able to doubt that either of us is taken now,” Draco answered.
Lucius and Remus exchanged shocked looks. They were expecting an argument, if not the cruciatus curse. Their Lord must really love his heir if all he did was accept their irritating distraction.
Tobias felt himself melt into Draco’s arms and he allowed him to remove his robe before doing the same for him. Both boys smiled at the other and turned away from the other to dress in their bedclothes.
That night Tobias had finalised the plans to ensure he and his father were free to do what they wished … well … within reason naturally. While Dumbledore was held in the magic-depleting cells in the Ministry, Tom, Tobias and Severus were planning the end of the war.
Watching the couple, Minerva was astounded by the connection the two boys had formed just by locking eyes, but if she was fully honest with herself, she shouldn’t have been. They’d always had a strong reaction to the other since they’d been at school, and now, she couldn’t wait to see what these two could do now that they were together.
“CRUCIO!” the man hissed, aiming for Tobias, who was making his way to his father, avoiding the other people around him.
Severus nodded decisively, finished his drink and rose from his seat. “No time like the present,” he said before leaving.
“So he can check you again. You’ve been tiring faster than normal. I just want to make sure that no light wizard or witch has hit you with anything.”
“Use this time wisely, Akzant’tra. The robes you will need are in the wardrobe. DO NOT TOUCH THEM! The Mother will gather them both while you are bathing.”
“What are we going to do?” he asked, voice shaking slightly. “How are we going to make this up to him?”
“I forgive you Draco. I’ll just ask Nagini to eat him later,” Harry stated seriously as he cuddled into his husband, “Can we go to bed now, I’m sleepy.”
“In the common room,” Neville replied coldly. “Ginny was with me until about nine, Colin was with my until ten and you, Seamus and Dean left at twelve. Do you want me to prove it?”
The sound of his husband screaming his name in pleasure, combined with the tightly clenched and pulsing passage, pulled Draco’s orgasm from him in only two extra thrusts.
Deloris let out a scream of pain when a long and very sharp piece of wood embedded itself into the fleshy part of her shoulder and spines appeared on it.
“How big was it, Mr Malfoy?” Pansy asked, awed at the site of the large fang. She, like all of the Slytherins who had heard of the events of four years previous, had believed it was just a story that the Headmaster had concocted to increase his Golden Boy’s reputation. By looks of it, the Headmaster had actually talked it down – but to what purpose.
