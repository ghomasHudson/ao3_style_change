“Oh my.”
Hi Mum,
NO. He would love it. He’s right here should I ask?
“Yes,  from what I remember I believe six levels and a rooftop observatory is what the paper from Gringotts said. Although I would think the top level before the roof will be an attic.”
Would you? Just for a couple hours?
“OH magic coming up! There are sparks on the south lawn!”
“Thanks, I really did have fun doing them and Jimmy really did a nice job. I asked for a classic framing to go with the vintage of the house. I thought the silver would be a nice touch instead the traditional gold. Silver seems to be the house theme.”
“I think Degas looks nice in the TV room? Is that Paul Klee?”
“I can see that. So what do you think?”
“You can use the floo in my office.”
“Hey I look good in a suit!”
Potter Cottage(Fidelius)
Bring drinks. I’ll run to the market too. Any requests?
I agree.
“Oh.”
“No, I caught you.”
“No. I’m not really.”
I’m so very happy to know that you’re doing well. Take your time! And you are right. I promise I won’t jump to any conclusions. You are a smart man and don’t take these things lightly, I know and trust you.
What the hell?
I will. And I’m going to sit with Al. I’ll try not to be too much of a distraction.
Well I know you work fast but this time you are ridiculous.
“Rather than a match at the centre we could race to Wales and have a shower when we get there on the cliffs.”
. . . . . . . . . .
We will have another fun day here sometime soon and explore? The upstairs ballrooms and galleries are wild. The grounds behind the manor are truly unbelievable. Overlooking lakes. Grottoes! Pavilions! Pools and Cherub fountains galore! There’s even a maze and outdoor theatre!
“Cute? I’ll tell you what’s cute.”
Give it a rest Hermione!
This couldn’t have been a more perfect stag-do. Thank you so much for it. Jamie really went all out to make this special. We had the best time.
Hi Mum?
“Harry. Sit.”
“Jon. Congratulations on your first broom lesson.”
Your Uncle is over the moon. Already asking me to pick out something for him to wear, and now he’s got Fender on repeat blaring in every room of the house. He’s currently having a dancing party with Jon and Davey in the art room. There is paint everywhere. Very little of it on the canvas. The boys are a mess.
Yeah it got really bad.
Looks like you’re just trying to change the subject. But Ron and I are up for it.
So is this important to Ted or are you just projecting?
Are you interested in it?
“You’re never too old for a blanket fort. Have one whenever you want. And you’re having a baby there are PLENTY of forts in your future.”
“Merlin no. I’m kind of relieved actually?”
“Okay strip, Malfoy! You need a shower!”
I don’t think Arthur would want to teach Muggle studies.
“UGH. . . . . .
“Maybe take a look at the progress on the park?”
___________________
“I don’t even know that one. . . it looks maybe Czechoslovakian? It’s sure something.”
“Can you still be my cousin then?”
“ . . . . . . Lanterns to hang by the doors . . . . . front and back. This is a set, like Jerry’s from the park . . . . . chairs . . . . table. . . . . .
“Teddy’s art is very different from what you are used to. Draco and I really prefer more modern works. I’m going to commission several paintings from Teddy for here at Grimmauld, he could use the special process for those paintings and you could visit those too!”
Insatiable Salamanders Vs. Unbelievable Billywigs. Lemon yellow Vs. bright blue.
“Yes.”
You do not know what you have done.
“Wow. That IS cool. Does it work?”
There’s also peas and soft finger foods in her bag. Don’t need to do anything to the formula bottles it’s all done and in stasis. Classes are going great. Not a single casualty, YET :)
“Well, let me think then. It is a parade and a party. You go start the shower while I give this some further thought.”
“Put on some other trousers then!”
“Yes.”
Just had a nice chat with Miss Parks. Apparently they were expecting a rowdy crowd. They are spoiling us all rotten. It’s starting to get late but everyone is staying up to see the lights. There’s even a balcony on the roof for watching.
The one in which Harry has a meltdown!
“I know. It’s awesome.”
What if I just owled all of the publications and told them to send a representative to the Ministry on Tuesday evening. Put them all on an even playing field. And why are they closed to the public?
In the meantime your main job is to finish your schooling. We’re all so proud of you Hugo.
Wow. Thanks.
Go ahead Hugo.
“I know, but I need to know why it’s so popular. Just why did someone think coloured wax would be a tasty treat for halloween. It’s ugly, tasteless has nothing to do with halloween. It doesn’t even look like real corn! I’m calling it bogus.”
“Let’s go look anyway. I’m going to want a decent kitchen. I’m not overly fond of the one downstairs, It still reminds me of things I'd like to put in the past.”
“Gawd.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes? I don’t know it but okay that sounds good?”
That's all for this weekend. Have a great week.
“She’s so pretty.”
“Narcissa, this is my assistant Grayson Elliot. I’ve asked him to help us with the portraits today.”
That sounds good, but I’m still going to spend time with my Mum.
NO. It just popped into my head!
“Don’t get mad at him. If anyone get’s blame here it’s me.”
“Okay!”
“Stick to the speed limits when I’m in the car with you. Otherwise Draco will ask to have the speed fixed so you can’t go faster. He might even request that Mr. Liogell set if for 30. . . . . Once I’m out of the car you’re good to go.”
No, absolutely not. I’ve been forbidden to disclose without the inheritance and Lordship acceptance tests. I’ve been begging him to do this for years. We’ve not a lot of time. Let’s go.
“How do you feel about Goblin production?”
“Yes. Draco will really love his snarky attitude too. Okay and one more then.”
“Uncle Nev sets you up with a whole ecosystem. It’s really something.”
“Harry? Who you got there?”
In future, please identify Mr. Elliot correctly. And take note that Hugo is also employed by Mr. Potter as chief foundation legal counsel and consultant.
“I guess you’re right. I’ll have to get it cleaned up.”
The manor can’t be like Narcissa’s though. Merlin, I hope not.
“YOU JUST USED WANDLESS FUCKING MAGIC TO START THE CAR!”
It’s not rumors. We need Vault representatives for each of those locations as well.
You need to get those in the store before the holidays. They’ll be a big hit.
. . . . . . . . . .
I need you to help me buy some koi. You said you would.
“EWWWWW. Now I need an acid shower! I thought it was just . . . .oh just NO. Dammit Al. Just . . . . .UGH!”
UGH. Can you wait at least until we’re back home?
“I see. So that deserves another kiss.”
“Wait.”
So get packing!
“It’s okay. We can go together. If I hold your arm you can take me with you.”
From the outside it looked to be just a friendly meet up at the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley. But insiders know that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy have been mysteriously absent in public as of late.
What’s up?
“Give it a minute darling. If it’s like the fountains at the manor it should be working shortly.”
Find some good stuff?
Long story. Dec is bored and we’ve moved his big main portrait from his manor to Grimmauld. We’re going to set up a TV for him to watch. He’s got Draco coming over to help set it up. Once Draco is here maybe I’ll come to the annex.
Hermione! We’ll see you there! Alter the Ron vow at least temporarily?
Scorp’s gran is a total softie.
Scorp is having the best time at Pippin’s. He and Minnie nerded out and answered ingredient questions and directed customers.
Regards,
Because it’s full of priceless works of art and antiquities?
So yes, to clarify what Luna just asked. I’ve spoken to Harry about this interview. I’m not restricted in any way about talking about our relationship or our family. I never have been! There are things that we keep private. As a family, as individuals. Most things are shared with family and friends. I think we can agree that everyone has experiences that are not anyones business. And Luna, you know how we’ve all been depicted in the press over the years.
Potter India Estates (3) - Held by Gringotts India Subsidiary - claimed/unused/no activity (3 Zamindar or Shaikepet properties held in architectural stasis and fidelius) Kashid Beach, Shaikpet Hyderabad and Mandarmani,West Bengal.
“Thanks.”
“Put on the gloves, Potter.”
UGH! You’re going to get into trouble!
It’s looking awfully lonely up here don’t you think? All these empty desks . . . . Mr. Liogell, while I address the proxies would you attend to my first order of business?
“See I like that one. It’s pretty.”
You better talk with Scorp.
“. . . . . . . .No wand and wordless . . . wow.
Okay I get it.
By signing the attached you will then be given further instructions concerning the event. Your prompt reply is appreciated.
“Al had a fire salamander. I think mister blister still lives at the cottage in one of the fireplaces. You feed those pepper or something. You should ask him. Not friendly but still really cool.”
Get down here the coast is clear!
IT'S TOMORROW!
“Then fuck yes.”
“Did I tell you I love you today?”
“I’m already happy.”
Hurling is a sport. Goblin youth league. Meet here at the penthouse Thursday at noon and we’ll go to Grimmauld together?
“I’m alright with that but we’ll keep his office at the penthouse.”
“In five days, but Sean will be in and out to prepare for the dinner. I’ll make sure to tell him to ask you if he needs anything. He’ll get that painting into the dining hall for you alright?”
“Well he always insists that he doesn’t work out . . . . . Hugo’s certainly not complaining.”
We made it to Saturday!
“You do? I love your shepherd’s pie almost as much as I love you.”
“Okay.”
There's progress on the park.
“You knew. Don’t do that, Harry. You know exactly what you were doing.”
“What kind is he?”
“I should hope not. Not if I do it correctly. You said your memory works like a file cabinet or something?”
“Hi Teddy!”
“JAY!?”
(See the end of the chapter for
. . . . . . . . . .
“Okay.”

“Dad? What is this?”
CLICK
SO. HERAALD. In reality, you could probably maintain these properties out of stasis for another 300 lifetimes and still live like a fucking king. AND did you notice the part where YOU ARE THE ACTUAL FUCKING HEIR OF SLYTHERIN????
Ouch. How long ago was that?
4. Mr. Kreacher would like the natural unpolished inlay for the carved names. The descriptor under the name should be in smaller lowercase lettering. All copperplate gothic.
Zebb and I packed it all up. I put my favorite basics in a trunk and shrunk it. It’s in a spare room at the penthouse. The rest went into storage at the centre.
“Well that was interesting.”
This is a bonus chapter. More fluff.
“What?”
“YIKES!”
It's Sunday. Time for a bus trip.
“It’s me . . . . . . Take a breath.”
“One is called “Cat people”. Another is “Dear Octopus”. Those were just the two on top. The film was a little brittle so I fixed that. . . .Should be fun for the kids? I’ll just project the visual without sound and keep my eye on the projectors they’re a little tricky to thread.”
There’s a beautiful collection of jewelry belonging to your Grandmother. Much more interesting than anything in the Black vaults. But we’ll want to show some of that too at some point. There is a photo album that includes pictures of what looks like your Grandfather at the lodge in Iceland pregnant. Photo's of your Father that I'm sure you've never seen. There’s books on magical birthers. I'm not saying we want to show those necessarily, but you should see them, or put them in your library. Did you know that Fleamont collected writing instruments and timepieces?
Okay, I thought it meant if you were home.
Just finished a workout. You?
“What are you doing, Potter?”
“de Kooning.”
Dear Mr. Liogell,
What’s wrong with that? I think it’s cool!
“Davey! He has the crazy hat.”
Do that the next morning. If she argues or refuses to resign you’ll have the Auror team if necessary. Make her and her brat sweat a little overnight. They won't have access to the offices.
Minerva has questions.
Okay I’m dumbfounded.
It is. So I’m working here so they can concentrate. They’re going to fill me in later, but I want this to be Scorp’s project. I think he’ll administer the trials at Mungo’s.
Victoire would be so proud of our 15th century computer skills.
YES THEN!
He’s more than good for her. Harry, he’s exactly who you would want Lily to be with. He may have no magic, but that hasn’t stopped him.
. . . . . nobody asking questions or for your autograph. It’s very possible that I would enjoy a kiss or three . . . . . .”
“She followed the fireworks.”
Can we get the collective OMFG and Congrats over in one?
“What?”
“Hey! Grayson!”
Rose Granger-Weasley, Hugo Granger-Weasley
“Yes. I’m very excited to see.”
“Merlin, Severus you weren’t joking around!”
Meet us there don’t be late.
Finally, the presentation concludes on a very personal note. A gallery containing family photographs, drawings by the Potter, Malfoy and Weasley family children and grandchildren. Also contained in this section is the original concept drawings by Harry for the Harpies Centre and the actual architectural plans of Milicent Bulstrode Architects.
“It’s perfect.”
7. Rather than individual floral receptacles for each niche, Mr. Kreacher would prefer one single receptacle for flowers placed at the foot of the columbarium about 4 feet from the main structure and centered. I think it should stand about 0.5 metres tall. It would be nice if it is more of a ginger jar shape rather than square but matching the black marble material of the columbarium.
“Highly recommend the roasted cauliflower.”
We’ll get Nev, Al and Jerry to help you get the plantings put together. It shouldn’t take too long?
“One . . .Grandchildren. Two . . .the property for said Grandchildren to grow up is where I raised three kids. They’ll manage. Three . . .”Potter Cottage” get’s renamed “Malfoy-Potter Cottage” and Four . . .did I mention Grandchildren? I know it’s not a “manor”, but it would be a be . .”
“Your mother? Please tell me Narcissa isn’t a fucking legilimens!”
HARRY J. POTTER
“They are, but it’s much the same with the Victorian furniture and blackout heavy velvet drapes. . . . Also, Draco moving back a bit these lighting fixtures are Edwardian and the woodwork is Georgian. That’s another reason why the victorian furniture looks so out of place. It’s caught between the two eras I think.”
“And I know it’s better with the woodsmoke flavours. You always say that.”
The Goblins filed the paperwork at my office this morning. At least 30 Goblins showed up to hand deliver it and would not leave until I signed for it and saw I had it in secured in my office. I CANNOT SEE THE DOOR TO MY OFFICE FROM MY DESK ANYMORE.
I need four questions and answers. Your category is “Cocktail or Animal”.
C/O Hollyhead Harpies Centre, Executive Offices
Wow. That’s a change.
Harry gets to see Draco's collections.
“Okay last one on this floor Harry. Check it out.”
My Dear Luna,
“Because the space is limited. No spouses or anything.”
“Ha. Already thought of that. Draco will fix that. It will be comfortable for you I PROMISE.”
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
I know. I just don’t talk about a lot of these things.
Today I’m interviewing my dear friend Ginny. We decided that a great place for our chat would be at the home of the Harpies. It’s recently been renovated and we took the opportunity to wander the new facilities. It’s quite impressive!
I’m in crisis.
Can you be on call for Grayson for the next few days? He might need some help knowing where to go for things?
“UGH!”
So this is his mysterious “storage”.
OMG she says she’s taken a “vow of secrecy”!
“And so . . . . Grayson do you want to do it? My method is cheating.”
I need you to take it off.
—————————————————————————
Do they all check out?
Al, Scorp, Ted and Jamie make final arrangements for the parade viewing.
“No! If I was worried about that we wouldn’t be talking.”
FAIR WARNING WE MAY NEVER LEAVE.
It’s Scorp approved!!
“Merlin.”
Regards,
“That’s a nice thing you did.”
“If you make your way up to the entrance hall for the ballroom, I’ll meet you all up there in five minutes. I just need to check something.”
All the better then, maybe they’ll get sick of following us around.
Give it a rest kiddo.
“Oh thank merlin.”
Okay. Doesn’t mean my nerves aren’t fried just thinking about it!
We can give him a show of magic. Everyone performs their favourite charm, or transfiguration. Or whatever. Call it the Davey Birthday fair or something. Spread out all over the cottage grounds and Davey rides his broom to each person for a demonstration.
LLL: It’s on now.
It’s beautiful. She’s going to love it.
“We did it, Hermione.”
Fascinating.
“You are a fucking crazy man.. We’ll get electrocuted!”
Gringotts
The Goblins hurl on Tuesday.
“That is what’s known as a househelper secret. Keep it to yourself!”
“Where is the kitchen?”
That only works with his grandmother anymore, and even that’s getting questionable.
“Upstairs?”
Emily Johansson.
“One moment."
“UP!”
Ah, okay.
“Remember that first day when we went to open Grimmauld? It’s like that. It’s going to take me a minute.”
“Yes.”
“How about that far wall in the entertainment level reception? Where those eight hideous portraits were.”
17:30
YES. They sent us a consent forms and everything. By owl.
“It’s CUTE!”
Oh that should be good.
“I didn’t think any of it was still around.”
Yes. The rest is just me blathering on about that fucking egg and how horrible the prophet was to everyone the next day.”
I know! And Auntie Luna knew when she did that interview. I don’t think she told though. She said she wouldn’t.
Me either.
did you understand that?"
Next Week! Wednesday afternoon/evening at 12 Grimmauld Place. Grand Dining Room!
“Peach. . . . . .”
“It’s super good.”
James? Named after Our James?
Come for dinner. Ask Agruella to come with you. It’s Dud and Lucy, Lily and Rose, Jerry and Ginny. Draco and me. We’re singing karaoke after dinner with Mr. Trandy in the cellar. I know it’s short notice but tell her its CASUAL and not to worry about dressing up.
Again. I didn’t write the list. Perhaps he fell under the category of Hermione haters. I will copy you the original in your handwriting. I will be more than happy to correct our mistakes in the translation. Back to the topic at hand?
“Would you?”
“Oh no.”
Consult with Draco.
So, do you think people are going to freak out over it?
“Breathe DAD. You’re going to break the new dishes!”
Well this time of year, yes. The season is only 4 months.
“It’s not like you’re doing all this work to sell it. You get to enjoy it and live here. Ginny it's absolutely beautiful here. This countryside is breathtaking.”
——————————————————————————
“How are we getting there?”
“Thanks. I’ll take it as a compliment.”
Sorry to interrupt but:
“Perfect. . . . . de Kooning?”
“Kreacher’s choice. And I do agree with his reasoning.”
“It is a beautiful night and every one of these guests would be willing and able to help you in any way you want with your project tomorrow. Myself included. You only have to ask.”
Seamus is FAST at this stuff, you know that. I’ll get the other guys started on the top floor removing the wall between those bedrooms.
“So I’ll set this to transport in 15 minutes. You will need to be outside on the entry steps. You can’t do it from inside the manor.”
“SECONDS???”
“Most certainly. . . . . Now, I’ve had a great many people speak to me over the weeks on your behalf. Malfoys, Potters, Finnegan and Thomas, a whole array of Weasleys . . . . . that was unusual. . . . . Lovegoods, Longbottoms, even the Headmistress and Ms. Poppy. I must say you have quite a following. . . . . .”
Harry will be ecstatic. He loves them!
"My flame was the quickest!"
Hey Uncle Harry and Uncle Draco! Greetings from Iceland! This place is stunning.
You got on the swings didn't you? Of course you did.
Since there are curious people down there perhaps you could put a note down on the front door. “Opening Saturday”?
“Am I kidding? What do you need?”
12 Grimmauld Place
Well HELLO! Aspen is well and alert. Right now her Dad’s got her. If all goes well he’ll let someone else hold her . . .eventually. I’m totally fine. It wasn’t really painful it’s hard to explain that part but it was fucking weird and intense. I think the weirdest part was the magical cord separation. Poppy really knows what she’s doing though. Aspen Astoria Malfoy-Potter would like to request her Great Grandparent’s to visit first. Just give us a few.
It’s not just that either. Apparently EVERYTHING goes. All new EVERYTHING. Bathrooms all redone. Bedrooms all redone. New floors throughout. New paint.
Stay dry!
“Alright! I like that much better.”
That’s transfiguration work. Half an hour. That’s the last step.
“We’ll see tomorrow. Draco has imposed a news blackout tonight.”
“I should tell Louis he can bring whoever he wants over there too. He definitely should show Bill and Fleur. Gareth and Danika too.”
“And Scorp caught a fish and said it was awesome.”
“I still don’t understand what she did. That spell?”
Edit: The usual. Added some punctuation and fixed some formatting.
You’ll have to have a look. Maybe Hugo’s grandfather would know?
“I do. It’s getting chilly. I need slippers too.”
“Is there another stop you’d like to pull before you lay whatever this is about on me? You’ve pretty much hit all my soft spots at this point.”
10: Dominique and (possible) Guest.
“Okay. Okay.”
I was really thinking that I was going to be in Al’s Wedding in neon green taffeta with a python arm bracelet. You really pulled one on us Narcissa. Truly, I’m laughing my head off, and I really needed a laugh today so Thank You!
“Music changed again. Oh it’s like standing in a waterfall of changing colours!”
“Of course. Always.”
I love you too, Unc.
I guess not.
Who else would I want to work with on that? Mum is the expert. So yes, absolutely without question. The problem is getting something like that even presented let alone passed.
——————————————————————————
Next door is the mysterious “Harry’s Junk”. Mysterious because we don’t know really what to expect. But we did get a glimpse today! In the front display windows are what is described as “Phoenix Quill and onyx inkwell. Collection of Fleamont Potter, c. 1950 - 1960” and “Polished turquoise necklace set in sterling silver. Navajo. 27 stones in various sizes. Collection of Euphemia Potter, c. 1970". Of additional interest is a sculpture in the large viewing window described as “
“It’s old and ugly as hell. Who would want it?”
“Square cut sapphires? Bloody hell. Decram let you take these out of his Manor?”
Aspen. I love it.
“Are you mad?”
Alright.
“That’s not right. . . . . . . Try this. . . . . ”
That’s not what you said this morning!
Grayson provides a transcript.
“I can’t.”
Yes please!
. . . . . . . . . .
“What?”
I would like a simple walk. Perhaps we could visit the zoological exhibits.
“Why not if it get’s people down there? Put a small section in for some personal things. I’ve still got my firebolt. We could find some other stuff. My old school robes? The things people would want to see. They want “Harry Potter” we’ll fucking give it to them . . . .
See you in an hour.
“True.”
Might be interesting if the Minister showed up for a pint at around 16:30?
That sucks. I was looking forward to a ride in the roadster, but I don’t want to use magic on the chocolate or cream cheese and I’m going to need a lot. I also need a couple springform pans. Since I have all the ovens I can bake the cakes all at once.
“Thought you might use it today?”
“There’s something else missing from that display back there too. It should be on your school trunk. The owl cage. I know you have it.”
“And those will bring in a pretty galleon. . . . . I think I’ll donate that to the Harry Potter foundation for the protection and safety of children.”
“Minnie has the books, we believe we’ve already found Draco’s. . . . . .”
They won the karaoke competition singing about outer space!
LLL: Yes, you both spent many a day at that table.
Okay. ANYONE ELSE? BOMBSHELL??? Going once. Going twice. . .
“It is. And I’m making you a scrambled egg. You can make coffee.”
I’ll let you know very soon. I should go now.
We didn’t do anything other that to just say we thought it was a good idea!
“Hermione?”
“I swear I was being discreet! I’m really sorry if I ruined your day. You were in a public place. I didn’t break any rules!”
Because NOW I really just want to move my office, family photos and collections into storage and be done with it. I can move my important paperwork to the Harpies centre and temporarily work from there if needed. Give Jamie the kitchen set he asked about. Send you the Brock breakfast dishes. You should come over here and take a look to see if there’s anything you missed.

“Does her Mother know about this?”
“Zebb. I promise we didn’t do anything dangerous.”
“I know it took quite a while to get done, but now you can have this sanctuary. We know you’ve wanted it forever.”
“It is. Knotty pine paneling though, yours is maple. . . . Oh yes through here Potter! It is a library but it’s really not that small either.”
Nice! You always like a lamb dish!
“You're right! Are those windows or doors? I love the green bubbly glass.”
Dear Mr. Potter,
“Sun catchers. Crystal prism balls that catch the light. That’s what the reflection on the ceiling is from. The rainbows. I’ve charmed them to reflect only upwards.”
I’m confused. How would that work?
I will do that today. What’s next?
Good. Also you can all consider yourselves test subject for the Wheezes. We’re going to try to use a version of Hermione’s charm for a prank product at the Holidays. So there’s that. Everyone get’s a WWW bonus for participating. Okay that’s all I have to say for now. Any Questions?

“I know! How rude of me.”
It’s the opposite. They’re both running smoothly and at a hefty profit for us. I could probably just keep running them from the penthouse office and develop new potions from the lab. Hire a marketing manager maybe.
AP: “Baby Fever!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Of course, sure.
“She picked out the brownish ones to go with the Snabb pendant.”
“Of course we came, we were invited and it’s your birthday! Happy Birthday! Do Uncles get hugs?”
Their dad was Pakistani. Mum East African (?). I can’t explain it you just have to meet them. Jon’s eyes turned to saucers when he saw dad. I think he was expecting another ginger and in walked a stranger who looks like him.
Wait you said Jerry’s thing was really loud. In the Muggle neighborhood?
EXPLAIN. I’m sitting down. Go on, I’ll wait.
“Acceptable! Enjoy your time on the Crazy Mouse!”
“Let me put it on you.”
Thank you.
“No that’s truth, Al. I need you. We need you. Plus, you do have the best hair?”
“He obviously loved it.”
“Yes Ma’am.”
“HA! Told you!”
No, it’s okay I’ll do it.
“Is it plants?”
——————————————————————————
“Grampa Harry look at my hair!”
“Alright then. Time for some fireworks!”
“OH.”
“I’ve never seen anything like this.”
“Oh.”
“I don’t fucking believe it!”
“Harry, I want to show people the lab but we’ve locked the gate.”
“I know! You’re getting married. You make potions and you teach about the plants.”
“Sometimes a little knowledge is dangerous. Stay out of it.”
——————————————————————————
“Ugh. That kinda sucks.”

Dear Mr. Potter,
“Well, I’m not sure to tell you the truth. From back there at the gates, I would have said early paladian but this is not that at all. . . . . . .”
“In a year or more. And I was going to ask Mum if we could do it at her place.”
“Oh Al . . . . It’s beautiful.”
I didn’t know that. And there are photos of my fucking Father???
“Good job.”
I think the best use of my time would be if I took the little ones during the day? If they’re not in school. I’ll bet Gareth and Luna can bring them here after?
Did it go well?
“Why?”
Cinderella. . . . .I think that one was even worse. And again. . . . all about a pair of shoes.
“This might be their year after all.”

It’s going to be so cool!
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”
I’ll agree to that. I can’t do something like that right now anyway, but in the not too distant future.

Grab some tea it’s going to be a while.
“He’s a sixteenth century floppy headed homosexual who built one of the most outrageous manors ever to be seen. Clam shells and cherubs with rubies and diamonds . . . . . to be sure. . . . He also commissioned what is probably the finest collection of baroque and renaissance art on the planet. Don’t get me started on the family collection of jewels. . . . . and yet, he values his connection to Harry more than anything. . . . . He can rattle off the names of every single family visitor and takes great pride in answering the fucking door. We love him and the family loves him and we’re all afraid that you WILL insult him. He’s not like other portraits.”
“Hey Dad!”
Wow! Okay.
“Where’s the gate?”
“Dudley is a Wizard, Harry . . . . . technically.”
“Not really. But I think that will change.”
Not that I’m complaining, but he can’t keep his hands out of it.
He’s on your no contact list. And he sent a message to the cottage.
We’re there! What time?
“I don’t really, Potter. I’m good.”
Mirror ball boys.
Ummm. Funny as hell. Very motivated.
“Do I have to live there?”
This is hilarious.

Okay?
I’ve just spit out my tea.
“That would be traditional Elfs quarters for the time, yes.”
“Well, never but that’s not my point!”
“Let it down . . . .slowly . . . .YES!”
“Perfect. . . . .now we have time for a shower!”
LOL. We’ll be good.
“Oh yes.”
“There is?! Like a little greenhouse?”
“Oh it is still beautiful. It was the best and the worst of the times. Where are you going?”
“Mione chose the hornets! And you’re the one with bats painted on your cheek.”
“Just last night. Scorp is beside himself.”

“I haven’t had time to come up here. It seems bigger now.”
Jay, sorry about this, but it’s an emergency.
“Zebb and Trandy are making dinner. It will be us and all of the boys. And Aspen of course. Teddy and Jamie, Al & Scorp . . . . the grandkids. While we’re working on that you and the boys can play trains for a while.”

Thanks.
“What?”
“No. Not every time. And the prophet reporters won’t come near you. We can’t stop them from taking photos though. That part is still complicated. Witch weekly won’t bother you because they wouldn’t DARE get on Ginny’s bad side.”

I don’t usually hate your ideas. I just need to reel you in sometimes.

You’re on thin ice Hugo.

Harry and I have been looking into some new projects. There are a couple we’ve committed to that are going to be big. I’ll give you an exclusive on those when the time comes. One of these projects you’ll be particularly interested in but we can’t talk about yet! I’m sorry Luna, I have to be pretty vague about these things right now, so no big scoops.
Yes, in concept.
Let me pull out the inventory.
See you then.
Hey DJ Dandy Doodles! Do you take requests?

Mary Bestleyton -
Can’t wait! See you soon.
You do?
“You have plenty of magic. Auntie Luna and Gareth have been teaching you!. Let’s fix that? What would you like?”
“Huh?”
“Yes. Do you know how to use this Muggle kettle?”
“Okay?”
Merlin don’t get him started.
“Come to bed.”
That’s FANTASTIC!!!
“Ha! You’re not quite there yet.”
Can you explain why it’s a “traditional requirement” for the parents to correspond on paper since it’s concerning a marriage????? I’ll start over with a new letter if I need one “for the record”. Your Mother keeps throwing me side eye when I question things and I’m beginning to think she’s just trolling me . . .as usual.
“You do whatever you want with it.”
Actually, I’m working on a new version of the beclawart remover. It contains volatile substances. You can’t help. SERIOUSLY. Please don’t come up here to help.
Harry, take it from here? You’re all SWORN TO SECRECY.
STAY AWAY! Your kitchen will be ready in a few hours. Jerry’s already started building the wall. His guys are FAST. What are you and Al doing?
“Done.”
“Okay, I’ll stop.”

“Wait. That huge guy?”
Totally unrealistic.
Arnaud and Perreault are here to train the goblin crew. They’ve got the production area and warehouse all set up. They just need your approval.
It can’t be THAT bad?
“No, but I think she’s transfigured something into a chef’s jacket.”
“I want to help!”
“He likes art because he learned about it with me when I was younger. He’s very knowledgeable. I think that’s part of the reason he gets on so well with Decram. They chat about art apparently. He's taught Decram all about Toulouse-Lautrec now.”

Oh Merlin. What a morning.

I love you more. Now get back to your husband and turn off your phone.

When you first come into the space you see the very large Moore sculpture and behind it this massive but peaceful painting. Blues, yellows and just a hint of orange or sienna. It gives an impression of sand dunes at sunset. It’s quite striking.

I have to meet with the muggles to perform a spell and have them sign the agreement. Every Single ONE. I need Aurors to organize it and log the paperwork. I’ll get started today but it might not be completed until tomorrow morning. At least it’s not ME cooking for tomorrows dinner!

Very good. What else is on your mind today before I update you on new developments?

“The kids are great.”
It was supposed to be a joke, but yeah sorry. I love coming in to do the patronus class. As long as Molly asks me to do it I’m there.
“Looks like a muggle freighter. We can see what’s going on out on the ocean, but it’s still protected here. I’m not exactly sure how the ward works. We should ask Jay maybe. Or we could ask Snape. He might know.”

“The most.”

There are little animated hedgehogs! SO FUCKING CUTE.
Sorry for the melancholy!
OMFG SCORP!
“Yeah.”

“Soon enough, Potter.”
“Yes!”
Who’s asking?
Serious? Really?!
“If I’m honest I’m pretty tired. But it’s good. What are you doing?”
Yeah, I know.
“Your Father really is pretty amazing, Jaydne. I’ll point out that he put up with me for many years before I finally caved and agreed to my inheritances. And he’s never once complained.”
I was taught privacy charms by my Father and the Minister of Magic herself. I can guarantee that my privacy charms are excellent!
Oh no.

“The music box? The one that plays the Muggle lullaby?”
“Alright. Put those away, I have a question for both of you. More than just showing you the lab. Oh, before that though take a look at this dragon hide apron.”
Do you remember that ministry thing when we saw Draco and Tory in the reception hall?
OH. Yeah. I may have forgotten about that?
I think with a zip like the Harpies hoodies.
Can we make a direct link to the Potter Manor though? Like the one I had to Mungos?
MERLIN! I’m not awake!
RE: @Redsnark
Seconded on the pot pies! How about a ginger and cabbage soup to go with these? I just need one big pot and a stove.
LOL! YOU FORGOT.
Of course. It’s very nice to see you Susan. I do think we will need a proper introduction though. A refresher may be on order.
Teddy will want to be fine tuning Lycanthropy laws to start, and then I think you might not be surprised that he might want to generate some arts legislation. Wizarding Government has done nothing to support any kind of arts ever. It’s time for that to change as well. I hope he will help head up an arts foundation that I have an idea for too.

HI Draco! Miss you!
“Oh Merlin. We’re riding in that?”
The highlight of my week is when I get my time with the kids. Jon is working on his third caboose and Davey is helping me with my mountain. We’re all just about ready to start putting snow on the village! I will be at the school to pick up the boys. They’ll come home with me and we’ll hang out with the Grangers and the Masons before I have to leave.
It’s now the GRANDPARENT’S CHAT ROOM?
POTTER.FAMILY.
Buy him a house in Hogsmead near the cemetery. Both problems solved.
——————————————————————————
Probably not. But put up the artwork that your Grandson’s painted for you that you’ve got hung in the entry next to Decram. Show them your priorities today and not just things from all those years ago. Put out your original doodles for the Harpies Centre next to the architectural drawings. Show your vision for that.

Same with me. I’ve been doing it too, and avoiding seeing anyone now cause suddenly “puffy”.

“Fair warning. Hands off. He’s mine.”
Like you said, fork in the road.
Did you see the Prophet this morning?
So from the beginning of our relationship we were pushed and praised by my family and our friends who absolutely thought they were doing the right thing. We've certainly never had any regrets about our marriage and no regrets when we decided to split for that matter.
“You’re right! That would be cool.”
HERE WE GO!
I don’t think the pools are deep enough for diving Jamie. They look deep, but not that deep.
SM: What am I?
These photo’s look more like a fashion shoot than random prophet sniper photographs.
How much do you still have?
“It should have happened years ago.”
No, she wouldn’t. OH. Draco did that interview with Luna. I forgot he was doing it. Walked into the middle of it in a towel. And you know me I was lucky I had a freaking towel. Made myself scarce pretty quick! Should have seen the eyebrows raised on both of them! And Rose was there. Ouch!

One would think that a couple married the previous day would take time off for a honeymoon. Of course this was not to be the case for Harry and Draco Malfoy-Potter. As previously reported, Harry and Draco married in a private ceremony with family on Saturday evening at their home in London.

NO. Absolutely not. The exact opposite. Just be comfortable please. But then if you’re comfortable in dress robes please feel free to wear that. I know Draco’s putting me in black jeans and comfortable trainers.

Gertie can you come up to the front please? . . . . .Hi. . . .It is my honour to say thank you for your years of service to the Wizengamot. I have decided that it is time for a change and your services are no longer needed. You are dismissed. . . . . I think you’d rather be with your friends at the Cloud Room anyway?

Might be easier to do your meeting virtually instead of making everyone travel. Especially if everyone is going to be busy late into the night on Tuesday.

Just have Phil do the ballroom for the reception. He plays a nice quiet jazz mix. As much as I love Groy’s compositions, they’re too formal. Not meant to be background fodder. They need to be actually listened too. They will be perfect for the wedding in the atrium but not really for the reception. As far as the orchestra? Since it’s already arranged just change the venue and have them play a short concert in the park. It’s going to be beautiful weather. A treat for the tenants.

Yes. I’m just grinding pecans. I’ll put it away and be right home.
That too!
“Can we just disappear it now?”
Oh all right then. But I’m not sticking around for too long.
“No tears Scarhead! Take a look at the pantry.”

Each dish was a beautiful and simplistic in presentation. The freshness and flavors accompanied with the chosen beverage was a great achievement. When Professor Molly Weasley and Narcissa Black-Malfoy approve of your culinary skills you’ve accomplished much more than an award from a publication.
So shall we all meet here at 13:45 then? Would that be acceptable? We can tell the boys 14:00. That will give us a few minutes to go over the details.

Front door opens into a nice entryway and actually a pretty sizable main room with window seats and a fireplace. Did I tell you it’s CUTE?! I’ve got photos. I’m going to get Kreacher over there after our meeting Saturday. I’m SO EXITED!
Several of them are represented here.
“ . . . . . . . . ”
Just what you asked. Calmed everyones last nerve and made them comfortable, yet VERY stylish.
It's midweek somewhere!
“Yes very much. Good choice. So then we have two more housekeeping roles to fill.”
“. . . . but you're surprises have been slipping, Potter.”
I won’t!
“You have to. It will look nice with the seagrass green suit I’ve chosen for you?”
I would hope so but won’t know until we see it. Need to do that extra goblin ritual to open it and see. Are you up for it?
I love it.
“Strap in. We’ll go pick him up!”
“Go take a look at those two paintings by the entrance. Leaning up next to the door.”
Bonus Chapter, because Monday.
See? So that gives us a reason to visit those places. Let’s do the house on the cliff!
You do not. You have apparition capabilities and the floo. Plus you’ve got a fancy portkey. If you get desperate, I’ll loan you my Clam card and you can take the tube.
“Teething biscuits. Really? And I can smell his shampoo.”
We don’t need any wizards bonding ritual.
You need to give notice for something of this nature.

“You’ve probably never heard of it. It’s in a remote area of Scotland. Try your google it’s called Hogwarts. But it’s very exclusive and private. I doubt you’ll find much, if anything.”
“So if I asked my very talented son to paint more than one background for you here at Grimmauld you would be able to visit them as well?”
“Sean?”
"UGH! I call FOUL!"
“That’s even worse!”
“I can’t.”
Again. Are you serious? If you are I’ll do it.
“Of course, sure.”
Mr. Malfoy’s personal assistant Sean McAllroy was our only respondent! Mr. McAllroy replied to our request with a statement that contained profanities that we cannot publish in our honored periodical.
“Merlin. I’ll be back.”
“Uncle Al!”
“Alright. Guest floor sorted. Let’s move on to those classrooms. You’re being very generous to the staff sharing this floor. It will be a collaborative effort for the staff to keep it up. Your Herbology room will be your responsibility but if you need help ask for it. And grow Draco some potion ingredients in there while you’re at it. Not just flowers. There’s plenty of room. Now the music and art rooms should be cleaned and kept under preservation charms. How often do you really think you’ll use them?”
We wouldn’t want that.
NOPE that is your gift to ME for putting this off for all those years HERAALD. I’m thinking official Ministry Decree. From this day forward you MUST be addressed in print and in person as LORD HERAALD!
Yes, I should know soon. The kids will be in a frenzy over fashion issues. So if they get to you before me you know why. Have a good evening.
“Two and one half weeks Mister Mustard. SORT IT! And the last thing you’re going to do is hire Ministry approved muggle security. OWL THE MINISTER.”
Alright I’m there.
. . . . .Draco can you get Hermione here if I text her?”
I don’t know and I don’t care. I’m colouring my fucking hair magenta for this. Harry needs an appropriate outfit. ERA APPROPRIATE.
“FUCK YOU!”
Sue me. I can afford the lawyer. I didn’t give it to him. It’s a loaner until he gets old enough for Ollivander’s. And I always take it back after Luna's practice.
“Oh merlin. Yes.”
I don’t have a choice! I’m four foot eight!
They have a roasted halibut with Morecambe bay shrimps, bok choy and braised butter.
Gringotts
Lucy doesn’t know about my history. We haven’t talked about it yet. Dudley doesn’t really either.
Molly, We need to catch up and we need something to throw the kids off the scent. They’re getting too suspicious.
FUCK! Breathe, Scarhead! Please just focus on me and take deep breaths.
I fucked up.
I’ll spend some time going over my notes. The shampoo I make for Harry would be good.
“We need to label the drawers.”
“Wow.”
"The owl pendant certainly doesn’t look Muggle made. Then there's the beautiful owl looking down at us from the roof? . . . . . .It doesn’t hurt that you mentioned Mr. Malfoy either.”
Snape said the process was like slowly coming out of a dream. He could slowly see things more clearly as it went along. Could observe McCull and his brushes and potions but couldn’t communicate until the painting was completed. Sounds like he performed some kind of ritual too. What did McCull have access to when he painted it? Of the professor’s things?
“It would be my pleasure, Minister!”
“I’d love to.”
“I’m okay with it if you are. I love all of it. Can we put Luna’s painting in my dining room? That spot you see right as you come in next to the elevator?”
I Love You!
It's the Weekend! See you midweek.
I know!

“ . . . . . . . . . .and how are you?”
“Of course.”
“So what do we want to do for the rest of the day? I love you more.”
“Narcissa! Do the LIGHTS!”
“Thank you, yes let's do that."
Cruel but funny.
“Yes. This is PAINFUL, Potter.”
“Yeah I don’t care about that. You’ll do just fine.”
“Well I’m not sure what I was expecting, but this certainly wasn’t it. . . . This is a lodge? I mean just coming up the walk it looks more like a hotel.”
Not like this?
So I’m not just helping out Grayson, we’re going to go on dates. If you people give me grief about it I’ve already had plenty from Rosie and don’t really need more piled on. ALSO we went to Daisy’s for coffee yesterday and there was a photographer. It’s in the morning Prophet and Witch Weekly. AND we’ve decided to call each other boyfriends.
Less employee supervision means you have more time for diving competitions. And more diving practice means you take Al to the pool, which in turn means I get to babysit Aspen AND the boys on Sunday afternoons. Which ALSO means GRAMPA WINS!!!!
“Shite. Good idea.”
Jimmy can do that. I worked with him on them. He’s good.
“Good morning.”
That sucks! What happened?
Are you sure?
“With a better plan and hiring people who know what they’re doing. I’m good with transfiguration, but I’m afraid this one is beyond me.”
“Runes? I don’t see them.”
“On the hexagon bottom left behind you will find the green closets that also connect to the kitchens. Top left and right passageways lead to twin miniature glass arboretum with views of the ocean. The four iron staircases lead to the second level, however there is a levitation veranda to the second level with access through the dining hall.”
“That can be accelerated. We bring in some compost to mix with the existing soil.”
HARRY J. POTTER
“Your Uncle Draco is an amazing dancer. DRACO You’re up next! I love the hook on this song.”
“We’ll know soon. He’s having a baby. It’s going to be a girl!”
“Different types of Cauldrons are stored over there. They all look to be in good shape and well taken care of. Beakers, tubes, boiling flasks and the like are stored here. Funnels of various sizes.”
“Thanks Rose. The portraits are leaving. Teddy, I’m going to need new art!”
It was the time of the great Muggle war. The family closed the conservatory and the courtyards. There was a great explosion that destroyed the conservatory in 1944. It was spring and it came from the sky. I remember the year very clearly. The wards did not hold.
“Of course.”
“Thanks! This is my assistant, Grayson. This is Jackson, Robert and their Mum, Bernadette. They’re part of a hiking club!”
Good evening. Alicia, perhaps I can assist in answering your questions on the final Referendum. You see, I have for many, many years attempted to work with the Wizengamot to accomplish the most basic of reforms, to no avail. As you very well know, the Referendum provides for just the opportunity for myself and Mr. Lovegood-Longbottom to evaluate our programs. No evaluation has been allowed under previous Wizengamot authority and certainly no budget to instigate any reforms or upgrading of systems to reflect current trends and technology. Hogwarts relies on charity for most everything related to technology.
We can do it earlier. Say from 11:00 - 14:00? Then if you want to hang longer that’s okay too.
“Okay, what the fuck is fructose?”
I am here.
YES. John from next door is handing out complimentary coffee. It’s turned into a celebration of sorts. I had to bring Al, Scorp and the baby into the back. Scorp got mobbed. They're watching the activities from upstairs.
“I shouldn’t have said that should I?”
_______________________________________
“HA! Ron, he’s had his way with you give him back to Harry now.”
Perfect. So our ruse is holding?
——————————————————————————
I really just want to do something nice for/and to surprise the boys. Give them a fresh start for this new chapter. They’ve been through a lot and deserve it. . . Plus, you have to admit that their current flat is a dump. . .Such a dump! . . .Okay, rambling again. . . .What I have in mind might be quite an undertaking but we’ve got time before the wedding and we have MAGIC. I would love your input and assistance. I might also require the expertise of Black Family members (Your Mother and Aunt Andromeda). The whole project will be on my galleons.
And then Dad won’t ask anyway because he’s got some idea that the world has to come to a screeching halt until after our wedding. He doesn’t want anything to take away from it. I get it, but we wouldn’t care.

Mediwitch treatments for Hemoines
“Dad, it’s beautiful.”
“Right here.”
“Well, lets get to know her a little more. To the patios?”
“Why would you be in trouble?”
“And they all need housing?”
“You’re going to burn the house down!”
“YOU SWORE!”
“I can’t tell you or I’m subject to the consequences. But for the recipient it’s nothing but bad jokes for 6 hours.”
One more later today.
This should be good. Prepare to have your Mum save your sorry arses again!
“True.”
That’s enough. We don’t need anything more!
“I’ll be teaching classes in the greenhouses. At least two days a week. Depending on how we work out the schedule maybe three half days. First through fifth years.”
About the house. It was beautiful then, but there was the war happening.
“All the kids ganged up on Voldy and pummeled him with water balloons. It was better than a snowball fight. He didn't have a chance against the kids. Especially Davey.”
“HOW.”
“Explain yourself?”
That’s it?
Cauldron

“UGH. I know you’re still sore about that . . . . . yeah I guess the only thing I took away from that was that it was possible for me to have babies . . . . . I said I was sorry!”
I know you keep it in perfect condition. There’s not even a fingerprint smudge on it.
“Well I figured that. I’m just waiting impatiently so I can babysit!”
I like it!
“Is that Al?????!!!”
“I’ve been paying for landline phone service on this place for over 20 fucking years?? DAMMIT!”
So kitchen sorted? Where to next?
“I’m not sure what to say?”
When is the wedding???
Well, I don’t suppose you’ll give us any insight into what Dad and Draco are plotting? And I KNOW YOU KNOW. You are our last resort (before gramps and maybe uncle Nev).
“I did. . . . . . . . .”
Oh, that’s not good Dud.
Support and to meet magic people. Especially younger people. She is your cousin and I know it’s been more than a little separated over the years. I’ve taken up the moniker of Uncle now to make it less complicated FYI.
“Merlin is that?”
“Oh yes sir. We were all here in the time of Miss Euphie. We have been waiting a very long time to return to Potter Lodge.”
Cars.
“Well Harry, Lily’s Eric is pretty wonderful. Looks like my cuddler is all grown up.”
“I CAN!”
We had dinner with Uncle Harry, Draco, Aunt Ginny and Jerry tonight after “the blast”. That was cool. In the wine cellar!
“Good for him.”
Watch out for crossing trains!
“Papa Jamie! I’ve got a snich!”
“I’m almost afraid to go in there.”
“My Dad is the best dancer. But only when it’s just us.”
“A top hat like Uncle Graycie’s. One that’s made for his head though.”
Stay here for a minute I’ll be right back.
And Phil Jones
“Oh Mother, don’t get me wrong. I’m more than thrilled by this change of events. It just hit me rather hard.”
“Shite.”
“Nothing there.”
Hey Dad?
Lois Weasley
WOW That’s impressive! Congratulations.
MEAN HARRY!
“Are you up for it Dud?”
Want a copy?
“Yes, I had to have your Mr. Liogell assist with that. It was a requirement from Chef Cheng.”
“Even the broccoli dishes. What is it with these kids and vegetables? And the asparagus is now gone too. Carrots, cauliflower . . . .these kids are rabbits.”
Done. But think about it. We’ve still got a little bit of time.
“You’re getting ahead of yourself again. Yes Blaise would be ecstatic, but why couldn’t you pick one of the simpler ones like the street preservation thing?”
Well we’re getting married on Saturday, so anytime after that. Next week? But not Tuesday or Thursday. I’m on babysitting duties! So let’s say Wednesday maybe. Then we can turn our attention to the Wizengamot. We need to battle plan that and make sure everyone's available that day. Hugo’s got the elf restrictions legislation ready to go. I want that done first and before Hogwarts is back in session so PROFESSOR Kreacher can teach his history classes!
“That could be a part of it. We don’t know how often they truly fly like that and there’s no way that’s not exhausting.”
I think I will. I’m serious! I’ll do it before I pick up the boys.
We need to have a conversation concerning the wedding.
Wait. Also need bicarbonate of soda and cream of tartar.
“Coming with us?”
“Cleaned up nice. Inside and out.”
It should be noted that #12 can be restored to the pre-Walburga 1952 footprint, however, when that charm is performed please note that the townhouse and it’s furnishings will also revert to the original of that time period. If that avenue is chosen, we would recommend that personal items be removed prior to the charm. It would then be possible to open the newly available rooms in advance to remove items/furnishings you may want to retain to a secured vault before a final restoration charm is performed. Transportation of these items/furnishings would be performed by bulk Portkey directly to the designated vault which could then be sent individually to a restoration expert or refinisher if chosen. This would preserve those items until the time the owner would return them. It would be advised that Mr. Potter select items from the stasis preserved #12 before having Gringotts perform any additional restoration charms on the property. Fortunately, it is understood that Mr. Potter has chosen to tour the property and document for historical purposes. Please advise of a date and Gringotts will make representatives available.

“Open . . . . . . . Not THAT much, I’m not one of Hermione’s parents about to give you a dental exam . . . . . . . that’s better . . . . . ”
“Look at mine. . . . .do you like this? It works just like the Muggle phones but it the magic version. Muggle phones don’t really work at the school anyway.”
“I don’t want to change anything.”
“Yes. We’ll take shifts watching over you both. You just need to relax and try to stay focused.”
““Ogden’s I can agree with. Shite. Ron looks . . . . .well. . . . .unbelievably good.”
“Go on then.”
Okay, well let me go think about that one for a bit. Now I don’t have any more questions today!
“This is the old master. Look. It’s exactly the same except  it's bigger now. And the window isn't crammed into the wall anymore. . . .different linens. . . . What the fuck?”
“Save me four boxes for Mr. Jordan!”
MALFOY-POTTER.LUPIN-POTTER.
“What do you think Mother?”
I completely lost a day or something and thought it was Friday when I woke up. . . ugh. Early post!
? She’s a total fucking bruiser! Worse than Lily even. Don’t let her pretty Potter locks fool you.”
“That’s fantastic. Well, let’s go take a look!”
Yes, then we’ll have to check out the new Potions classroom.
othing’s a deal breaker so far. There’s a lot to think about.”
“Oh Merlin.”
A party to celebrate the upcoming marriage of his brother would also be called a “Stag Do” here and usually quite unruly. Not the same there? We understand and will accommodate. Should we bring in more staff?
I think I’m good. Lily is helping me decide what to wear.
To tell you the truth, I didn’t feel bad about it for a second. Next question. No sex questions. Not allowed.
Yes, let’s do that. OH and can you show the transcript service guy how I'd like the format? I like it like the Gringotts chat. Much easier to read. . . . .Do we need a budget meeting for that? We need a transcription service for every meeting. Does the Wizengamot even have a budget?
“Who?”
“Too big?”
“Us. . . . . he made US a fountain.”
“You too Malfoy! You don’t have to ask me twice. . . . .you brought more clothes didn’t you?”
“It looks like someone actually lives here. It’s not all dark and creepy and depressing and I just don’t know what to think. I mean the furniture needs arranged but. . . .”
“I’ve already done that, Scarhead.”
I don’t believe we’ve been BANNED from seeing the house until the wedding! I want to see it so bad now.
Zebb’s pot pie if I’m honest.
Alright let’s plan on that and hope it works out. Ask Draco if he’s ready for help putting things together at the cottage too?
Malfoy Manor(Fidelius)

“I haven’t figured that out yet. There’s time. Maybe get Ron to go to Trandy’s wine bar and prank him there. I will get him though, when he’s not expecting it.”
“Do we get to op-ed?!”
“That’s my work uniform.”
He’s a temp! He’s only going to be working in the office for another couple weeks. Then it’s just consulting.
“I know. I’m really looking forward to autumn. Get back in here under the covers.”
Merlin. Thank you.
I don’t need time!
Don’t get ahead of yourselves and just leave Rose alone.

“Uncle Sev, We would like for you to join us for dinner, but before we take you down to the kitchens we need to tell you about Decram Potter.”
raid the wine cellar. . . . Date?”
Your Mum and Blaise.
WHY!?
Hey, Dad. How did you do that anyway?
What is Lucy doing today? I know there’s no school.
Whatever.
“David Smith. It’s pretty big though.”
“Groy??”
Yeah, Should have thought this through better. I may have to push it back. I'll have to inform the existing Order members and Family, and Luna and oh god we need Kreacher. I’ll owl Minerva. And your Mum and Andromeda, They should be there.
“Prophet archives. It seems I have an
I’ll take her to see the dragons if that’s okay?
“Best ever.”
Cool then. Is Draco cute?

“Some of them will go to the gallery upstairs. Most into storage so we can switch them around.”
Out of respect for Jay and Agruella. I’m going in deep grey and green accessories. Draco in black and white with yellow trim. And we know the press will be watching.
Cool!
“It smells really good.”
—————————————————————
Now take Lucy to the pet stores.”
You Are COLOURBLIND.
Grayson insisted. I’ll bet he’d teach you too! You need a brush up on your amazing driving skills!
“Oh my.”
“It should. Would you like to try?”
Rose, how many photos are we looking at?
“Okay Grayson. . . . .So now stand back again this next part is a little complicated. . . . .place it there. . . . . .okay. Dean, un-shrink this while I hold it in place.”
“You always seemed like you were worried about something so yeah, kind of?”
“What about the spider?”
Where are you?
Which one is winning?
“NO I want a fucking REFUND! That is hippogriff level bullshite!”
“Well the rest of the place is looking great. Complete transformation from when we were here before. Not a fern in sight.”
Oh that’s just silly. It’s for a BABY!
How about tomorrow. Harpies pitch. 11:AM. I’ll consider it a test run. Actually you can put it through the paces and tell me what you think. I’ll call it an official assessment and evaluation. Go ahead do your acrobatics.
“How so.”
“Yes.”
"It should be here tomorrow. Same jeweler as Luna’s turnip. I’m having several different chains made as well. Different lengths. The portkey device inserts into it from the back. That’s nearly ready."
OPINION ARE NOT AVAILABLE.
That’s kind of fascinating.
“So. Mr. Trandy will be the house manager. You’re going to need a groundskeeper and NO, you can’t do it all by yourself so stop thinking you can.”

“Absolutely. I need it too.”
HARRY J. POTTER
Just big enough for me to go out for coffee. And once I have my driving license I can probably drive it right into Diagon and down Knockturn. Park right in front of the junk shop!
Please do.
Got it! See you then.
Neither! I thought he looked nice.
Ginevra Weasley-Linder,
Dear Tenants,
Alright.
And what’s up with the idiot Sister? Witch is all sparkly and prettied up asking questions about who’s good or bad? You’d think she’d be at least a LITTLE concerned that her own Sister was just murdered by a kid with a flying house!
“Where’s this jumper from Gladrags?”
“Okay what’s up with these fucking fake medieval cabinets!”
“NO, just don’t.”
Okay I’m going to get Dad in here. Hold on a minute.
We’ll be available for both. Just let us know.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . .Hello Geraldo!”
Hey Al,
And it takes a LOT to make Mum cry. Dad is another story. Total meltdown.
I gifted you the ring and Jay says that means I’ve given you the lordship.
“Molly want’s you to take on the mantle so she only does something at the Burrow once every couple months or so.”
You are all asked to gather in my offices at 17:30 just to be safe. I’m not sorry to inform you that we are pulling a fast one on the Wizengamot as it currently exists. As you may or may not know, I’ve been waiting for this opportunity all of my adult life. HUMOUR ME.
I’m nervous.
(See the end of the chapter for
That’s what I’m afraid of, I don’t want to mess it up!
We’ll be over in a few.
Well to be honest Al, She IS hot.
“Dogwood blossoms. I do love them. Harry had those brought in. The greenery is olive branches. We had those sent from Greece.”
Also, If you thought for a second that Draco would have something made with muggle rhinestones you’ve lost your mind. Besides, those earrings are awesome, and I’m jealous of the turnip brooch. I want one!
Okay, If you’re both good I’ll draw up my plan. Get some samples together. We can invite the boys to go over our ideas and see what they think? Maybe tomorrow? Ginny could you do that?
. . . . . . . . . .
Of course, there's side business to attend to.
Draco is itching to come over there. He is literally rocking on his feet and wringing his hands. This will not end well. And dad put him in a pink wide necked crew and black jeans. This is weird! He’s wearing camouflage high top trainers for fucks sake!
Father explain this?
Want me to keep her overnight? I’ll be happy to.
I want to see the owl!
“I couldn’t learn it. I tried and tried. I was taught by the best and could never do it. Draco can do it.”
Thanks again Sean. Meet at the penthouse in the morning.
You have to ask him, but will I help? Absolutely.
Hugo and Grayson have late night plans.
“Alright?”
Check this out:
He didn’t actually come in. Just left a package on the hearth.
“One big massive fucking fountain in the center. Modern. Spiked steel and higher than the townhouses. Like the one you did for the centre but on a really large scale. Two smaller ones to compliment it on either end in the two old planting areas.”
WHY DID YOU DO THAT????!!!! You know I have no idea how it was built. I’ll have to ask. Maybe I should actually get a copy and read that big book file from Gringotts. UGH no that would take years. When do you want to go on our trip? I’ll owl Liogell!
The Dads do some planning after Harry’s meltdown with Hermione.
“I may have gotten into your cookbooks and bribed Trandy.”
“The Fleamont and Euphemia things are all along the span of this wall. The art and sculptures and pottery from the lodge are on the other side. I love what you chose.”
“Yes.”
You should bow out of that.
It’s extremely casual.
Hey Al!
Pub quiz questions?
“They’re trustworthy and they love a joke!”
“It’s for all of us. Take a look around. Davey, go check out the swings.”
ABSOLUTELY NOT! DON’T YOU DARE!
“You’re not? I am. I’m angry with myself.”
“I love it.”
Potter. Are you still shopping? Come home.
What happened to simple?
19:00. I’m making a pear torte for dessert.
“It’s all glass! Don’t let me near it!”
Oh Merlin.
“I won’t  bother them I swear! And I’ll parsel the lab first.”
A Conversation With: Draco Malfoy
“I hadn’t thought that far ahead?”
“I’ll remember that!”
Nope. Team Spinning Boys = Danika and Phil.
How’s you're boyfriend?
That was pretty good.
“Okay?”
“I love the brass buttons. . . . Pansy had a blast making them. . . . yes, they all hang over there opposite the door for when they come over.”
“I’m most certain you won’t remember me.”
“Jamie’s always good with the kids.”
“Golden Oats. I really like the colour next to the metalwork. What do you want to show me?"
“WHAT?”
“The sooner I get the conservatory done the sooner we can get married.”
“Where’d he go?”
“Did you see the tv?”
Wow. Okay.
But remember, those were things we wanted. Plus it wasn’t just that, he set us up with
“I’ll be whoever you want me to be.”
“But you’re moving tomorrow!”
Come out here when you have a minute?
. . . . . . . . . .
We’re not going to play the game where we don’t do things together and enjoy ourselves because someone might take a photo. Fuck it. We’re just not doing that anymore. We’re adults.
“. . . . . . . . . . .
It only seats two but I’ll take everyone who wants for a spin. Just let me know.
“So far I think so?
Agreed.
Why didn’t you tell us there was a lake on the property? Did you not know? Mr. Gunnar says he’ll take us fishing if we get up super early in the morning.
. . . . . . . . . .
“Absolutely.”
Our chat room is a little outdated but it works for us. We’re all pretty used to it.
“We love you too.”
Uncle Harry?  Where are you?
“I suppose . . . . .here you go, he’s all yours!”
——————————————————————————
“I like it just like this? But I’d want to put my books in here too.”
As such, It is my pleasure to inform that, along with his Mother and Family, I whole heartedly approve of the upcoming bond and Nuptual.
Okay. This will be fun.
Is that all of them? I think so.
I don’t know yet. I’ve got to read through them all.
“Shite! See you! Love you bye
Not backing out. We’ll be there on time.
On my way.
“I love root beer, thank you.”
Did you forget about that?
ROAD TRIP MESSAGE BOARD
“Where’d Hugo and Grayson go?”
Don’t do what you don’t want.
Where do we want to start?
“Scorp?”
Okay, I’ll consult with Hermione.
Ginny do you hate Draco’s idea?
“Yes. Don’t panic.”
I can confirm that Brunhilde Aspreng is that prune who's always in the paper. She's the Chief Warlock.
AP: Yep, well you also apparently declared that I was your
After dinner I’m going to have everyone come down to tour the conservatory. It will all be finished then. We’ll just have Arthur do it at the fountain like we planned. Then you get to sign off on the paperwork and it’s done!
“Pillows?”
Now I know you’re trolling me.
“Who’s NEXT!”
“Here we go again.”
Pay off the sitter. Ask Jon if he’ll be my train engineer assistant. We’ve decided to stick around and I need someone to watch after the trains. We’ll have some fun. Davey too. The boys can spend the night. I’ll make some train tickets for Davey to pass out.
“Come on in, Grayson!”
Inflation.
“Okay then.”
“Snabb is bathing in the sunshine from the balcony in my room. How are you today Decram?”
Have a great week!
Waters is the right person for what they plan to do. Uncle Harry and Draco aren’t going to have editorial control. Not going to have much input at all. On purpose. That’s how they’ve set it up. Jen Waters is the woman who exposed "The Wig" back in the early 1990's.
“Right up his alley then!”
“It’s so pretty.”
True.
“Get Bill over to do his curse breaking sweep. I want to do the exterior myself. Wash away the demons as Mother says.”
“Okay.”
I’m trying really hard not to get emotional about moving out.
“Well, find out. I can use mine. We’ll see tomorrow.”
Stay for lunch?
She opened up a freaking chat room and asked me to get you in there!
“And hangover potions!”
“Here’s the thing. . . . . Al is that person who puts his heart right out in the open. And you know how big his heart is.”
“There you are! I’m sorry I didn’t know that Mr. Liogell had you wait here.”
Well he is just Dad.
“Ferret.”
Cassius Marcellus - “Artist”
“But you know better about this and I just want you to be happy, so the only thing I’ll say is some of these have ugly frames. Especially that one.”
Top floor!
1. Yesterday our families gathered together for a private lunch to celebrate the upcoming wedding of our sons. Read all about it in (
“Ahhhhh yes. . . . . Miss Lucy Evans . . . . . Your Great Aunt would be very proud . . . . ”
quite nice . . . . . . your wish is granted. I’ll keep it.”
“I get it.”
I won’t ask any more questions then.
“I’ll come with you to the roof. I want to see those pumpkins you’ve got for the kids.”
“I specifically made that fucking broom so it couldn’t do that! How?!”
“We need to get these two back to their Fathers. We’re late and it’s their bedtime already.”
“Would you prefer something like this to the blue chair?”
“Well, nice to meet you both maybe we’ll catch you on the pier.”
“Okay. We’ll get Andi to come do her ritual with your Mother. We should set that up with them. Maybe Fred will visit again.”
. . . . . . . . .
What brought this on?
She needs Hogwarts school supplies! And maybe Luna’s school. She’s going to need things for that too. I just want her to be able to draw what she needs for things. It’s her Evans family magical scholarship fund. All that stuff isn’t cheap.
(See the end of the chapter for
Not in this outfit.
Love You Bye!
He might curse me for corrupting his only son?
(See the end of the chapter for
Very fair. I would suggest making the disclosures to age fifty.
Is that so?
Yes. My meddling ex husband set me up!
Can’t yet. Brewing. Another hour wait. How’d it go?
Absolutely!
“It’s more than enough.”
“Pretty. It really puts it together nicely.”
“Bernadette, step over here for just a moment, I have another question?.”
“Maybe?”
Okay back to finishing the bills.
“Wouldn’t dream of it.”
Fucking Wizard my arse. The crap behind the curtain looked like the steam punk version of Grampa Weasley’s shed.
“Yes. Front steps then.”
Draco say’s he’ll come. We will be there!
. . . . . . . . . .
“Sorry.”
“Oh?”
LOL back. There are also two other Rolls-Royce models. Another Phantom II from 1930 and a 1909 “Silver Ghost”. Mr. Malfoy would love this automobile.
I’m serious. The entire guest list is just family. We’ve led them to believe it’s going to be a major event with upwards of 300 guests. Those kids don’t want or care about formal dinners or dancing to an orchestra. This is about Albus and Scorpius and their friends, not us. Certainly not me.
Mrs. Granger took us to tour the summer school. She was GREAT. Thanks for getting her to come talk with me. How do you know the guy Gareth?
THE QUIBBLER
You can do it. You can at a later date put the Chief position up for nominations and a vote if you want, but for this first process you need to do it. So once you’ve taken the chief seat you call up each of your designees and assign them their seats. Everyone takes their seats and you decide the next step.
Edit: Formatting. Typos, the usual.
Are you sure?
“I think it needs a tune up!”
“Talk about a delay tactic. . . .Merlin.
I love you
I’m glad we agreed to it. When Auntie Luna sent it over I was shocked at first but then laughed about it for about twenty minutes. Cried a little too though, I’ll not lie It was a bit much.
—————————————————————————
I just need to know how you both think about it.
TWO WORDS.
No murder in your future!
“Yes. They have whole kits that come with instructions. You can pick one up. They have a catalogue you can take to Mrs. Brick too and she can pick out other things if she wants to try it out. They even have owl delivery services.”
I’ll just hang in the background if that’s cool.
Very good. I’ll see you soon. Safe travels.
“I know! We’ll go back up in a minute.”
Cissa
Unfortunately it still does happen on occasion. That’s out of my control. You know I don’t actually write those letters, I just sign them.
Hugo, I’m going to be perfectly clear here. I need you to understand that I’m offering you a job. It will not only be writing legislation but working with me on my charitable foundations drawing up contracts and grants and such. This is a full time, salaried position. I may need you to help with other things too occasionally.
“And there they go.”
“WHAT?!”
Yes I can help. We can meet saturday at hogwart will you bring the miss black?
Fuck. AGAIN????
You have Harry-FUCKING-Chief-Warlock-Potter, His Kid Albus who’s Husband is SCORPIUS MALFOY the virtual potions genius-hero. And if the cousin is who I think it might be that’s Edward Lupin. LUPIN. Son of war heroes and multimillionaire artist.”
“Oh.”
Well you guys know what the “courtyard” looks like from here. We call it the park. It now stretches into the park and the greenhouse thing took a big piece of it too. It's almost the whole end cap of the complex.
“Quite a light show.”
“She lives off her trust fund or something I think? Father travels around with a circus tent “healing” people.”
——————————————————————————
“And now I feel bad because Harry and Draco cancelled their weekend plans and are staying here because I was too nervous to handle this on my own and all of the others are coming to go over things in three hours and. . . . .”
“Yes then.”
Hope you're having a great weekend.
Have a great week!
What?”
Yes, me too.
Quibbler Article is out. I just hit publish. Go check it out. FU Profit!
“You won’t know until I’m done now, will you?”
“This is what’s going to happen. I want you to leave Lucy watching TV and pack an overnight bag for yourself. Then, help get Lucy’s things together for school and have her pack for a sleepover. Tell her she’s spending the night here at Grimmauld because it’s going to be easier for her to get to school for the first day. Explain that she’s having a surprize sleepover with Lily and Rose to celebrate her first day of wizard school. Got it? Lily will take her in the morning, I’ve already told Gareth and Luna. I’m bringing Jon and Davey.”
“YES! LET’S DO IT!”
Dude!
“The cabinet? Those are the memories I put away at Andi’s instruction. You can’t see those. I told Andi that I would keep them for historical purposes, but I’d really like to have them destroyed.”
_______________________________________
Yes, I’m joking.
“I mean, why not? And I know you’re just crazy itching to show Scorp the lab.”
Okay let’s do it.
Quick question?
“Please.”
It’s kind of our thing? We make tea and have quiet time before Mr. Brick and Hugo get up for breakfast.
YOUR CLEANING SPELLS SUCK! They’re too strong for a baby.
“Okay then. Is it alright if I tell your Mother that you came out as Hugo today?”
“And you?”
“It’s not going to work is it?”
He doesn’t want one. He loves his bluebell wand and we’ve been letting him practice with it. We might want to take him to Ollivander and have it looked at for compatibility. He loves his bluebell.
“Yes . . . . My ex. . . . oh, you want to meet her?”
_______________________________________
He’s right Narcissa. It’s the final ruse. Then we can all just relax and enjoy it.
“If he was the first caller then that’s the rules. . . . Put him on. What else do I have to go on?”
“That card room is fine. Clean up the woodwork buy some new games. The chess set is a classic. I don’t know if you noticed, but there are playing cards that border on pornographic, dispose of those. The kids are going to want muggle Jenga. Shay could probably have that whole floor cleaned and brightened up the way you want it in a day after you get rid of that furniture. His charm work is excellent. And then there’s that second “ballroom”.”
You could seriously put water in a diffuser, call it “Aspen” and people would purchase it for their children. That is my market analysis.
Probably.
“Messy!”
We’re all ears?
“I’m better. I’m sorry. Merlin. That just made me so mad.”
“Oh yeah, I know that. Let me tell you he’s got good representation. . . . Did you know he was working with Danika on music composition? It’s really cool. Danika’s taken his music files and transferred them. He and Phil are playing around with it. . .They really are pretty cool. . . . . .Al?”
LOL Al.
“Jon. . . .?”
“Let’s do that.”
We booked you a day at the Manu park. You have a private guide for that one and no tourists to bother you!
If you want to meet Mr. Maeda and his Grandson you should come soon. They’re nearly finished.
I’ll be there!
“Your chariot awaits, Miss Evans!”
. . . . . .
Oh. This might take a minute.
“Yes. You really should come down and sit with us.”
Am I going to regret this?
You know what I mean Pans.
Not yet
We’re finally here.
They did not trick you. They couldn’t tell you.
It makes sense.
We both do. And I’ve been out of the house working!
“Well you certainly weren’t kidding about the manor!
——————————————————————————
“He’ll enjoy it! I’ll even invite him to lunch.”
—————————————
“We’re in. How about you Dud? Lucy?”
“I dare you to  . . . . . not immediately heal the marks I’m going to leave on you up in the greenhouse. Leave them for a whole day.”
“No no no. YES!”
“Look at this one.”
So I guess Witch Weekly figured out we’re engaged because we’ve got rings on. Is it okay with you if I just confirm it?
“True. So if we’re practical we’ll head to bed early.”
————————————
We are?
“What?”
I’ll try but she’s been really busy with some mess. I don’t know what time it is there.
Oh cool. What did you do?
“He’s right beside you dear. Take your time. You’re coming back.”
—————————————————————————
“We came from India just like Grampa Harry!”
Okay now BE NICE!
. . . . . . . . . .
AAAAK.
Very good.
“It’s cute. I don’t believe Jon got him on those rides.”
Harry jinxed the waiter for rolling his eyes and not giving you the lemon?
“Nope. This information has been sitting here for hundreds of years, it can wait another day. . . . . ”
“Yes. I can do that.”
Vegan nut roast with mushroom gravy, spinach and sherry cranberries?
CHANGE OF VENUE!!!!!
Ha Ha Dad. Because this is exactly the kind of thing you would do to prank us!
“Okay last bedroom here. SHIT! WHAT THE HELL!”
I can do that, but I really trust your judgment.
“Do you own any?”
“Likewise.”
I know I was joking.
So then after the Grimmauld tour . . . Family meeting at Potter Manor. That should be interesting.
“Want to find out?”
Do you and Harry really own all of these buildings?
. . . . . .OOF!
Correct answer = 3 points
Ron it is then.
“You know what I like even better than the woodwork? Knowing that at one time this was fucking Walburga’s room and now it’s the custom sanctuary for an elf. Schadenfreude.”
“How do we get that to work? Is it different here?”
First thing tomorrow?
“Okay.”
“At the penthouse. He hates it there.”
. . . . .
“Mr. Kreacher and his lovely Wife, Mrs. Ruby.”
I’ve got to make this a quick one. I’ve got painting to finishing up for testing tomorrow.
Why the fuck isn’t Draco on the top of that list? Or Snape for that matter?
——————————————————————————
“Just here to check on something and then I'm heading back out to tie up some loose ends.”
Everything will be fine. Now, go ahead and get those owls flying. Let me know if you need any help.
No. He’s not going to freak out in a sense that it's bad. He’ll be very excited. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s already taken care of it.
Just do it.
You’ve GOT IT! Love You Bye!
“You will find a similar situation with bath towels. Harry loves his showers. . . . Morning, noon or night. . . . You will frequently have to say, “Harry, you left your towel on the couch”. Or on the bathroom floor . . .almost anywhere really. . . . This takes some getting used to. I hope you’re not bashful or prudish because he comes out of a shower and wanders. Sometimes to his office to write down a thought or to the kitchen to find a recipe. . . . Just drops the towel and leaves it. . . . “Harry you left your towel on the kitchen counter again pick it up”. . . . It’s quite possible he may change this behaviour with you, but Harry is not particularly modest. . . . It is Harry’s responsibility to pick up his towels. He knows this.”
You’re right. I think I want to make them all pendants though. I could have them done out of metal. Maybe something cool like titanium. We could have the same guy cast them. Make it a family thing.
—————————————
This might call for some vintage Aphex Twin.
“HA! That was fun. . . .Whew!”
______________
I think so.
You do?
If I were to hazard a guess, I believe you have your suspicions. I would like to introduce our next petitioner, Mr. Harry James Malfoy-Potter. Mr. Liogel, if you would?
I have an idea you’re going to tell me? I thought you didn’t want to know about that part?
“AAAAAK!!!!”
“I can’t! I’m sorry!”
“It’s my favourite part of the whole park!”
Raven or Magpie.
“ONE MORE!”
And I brought this one home:
See you in 10!
Okay I don’t get it.
“Are you all moved now? Are you comfortable? Biscuits!”
Mentions of child abuse. Please skip this one if you want.
“Ingenious.”
LOL Hermione. Booty call. And so typical of them to broadcast it to the entire family.
“And now I drink my brandy.”
Yes. I found nice rooms at the Corintha. Check in is anytime after 12:00. Don’t forget the portkeys.
“Two more?”
“I’m not sure how much help I’m going to be."
“You get those even if you refused, but I’m taking it as a win.”
Grayson is bringing the car around at 17:00. We should be at yours around 17:30?
“In her room with Lily picking out something to wear.”
“Then we take the loop around the other side. That’s my first Christmas jumper. . . . . first year robes.”
“We’re here to lend our expertise. Jerry will do his ritual to clear out the interior down to the basics and I’ve got a crew on standby to start removing debris and replace that roof before it collapses.”
“I AM SO FUCKED!”
“Yes, of course.”
FISH.
“Before dinner time?”
“I love them, I hope the tenants do.”
“I’m missing something. What happened after the bombing?”
“Teams?”
I’ll give you my honest opinion, I promise. But I’ll be honest in my opinion that this is really weird!
“They know we're pranking them. . . .There’s a difference between the email and the text.”
I’m sorry dear. I’m not going to do that. This is my painting day and I’m not going to use my time with Albus trying to get information. If it comes up in conversation that’s different, but I won’t do that.
SHITE.
“What is it?”
“OH. I thought Grayson was going to lose a lung he was laughing so hard. . . .I do think he did it on purpose though.”
Legislation 3:
The interview was recorded and this is a transcript of the conversation.
Lima did close several years ago. The previous owners bought the space back & re-opened a couple months back. So let’s call it Lima 2.0. and yes, it’s impossible to get a reservation.
