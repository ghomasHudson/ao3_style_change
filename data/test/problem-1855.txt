“Firstly, I’d like to thank you all for taking the time to join us here today for the ribbon-cutting and relaunch party for Lochinvar Quidditch Academy.” A cheer went up from the group. “We will have many more guests joining us in a few hours, but we first wanted to celebrate with the people who have really made this all possible for us. Thank you to each and every one of you for your support, and we look forward to showing you what we have achieved.”
“Not now.” Was all Draco said.
What could he do? He couldn’t beg. Anyone who was an auror wanted to do this to him.
An angry voice sounded from outside, it was the same one who’d noticed the window,” Is it clear or not, Potter!?”
Harry knew the woods were dangerous but he couldn’t bring himself to leave. Not after Draco went missing. It was the only thing he had left of him.
The birds were eerily silent tonight. It was as if somebody had hit an off switch and turned off all manner of noise. He longed for the soft hoot of an owl or the grunt of a mule deer.
His breath caught in his throat as he saw the trembling form hiding in the corner. His slender arms were wrapped around his chest, trying to fight off the chill of the air. The dingy prison garbs he’d been given hung off of his gaunt frame, revealing how skinny he really was. His collarbone stuck out sharply and his skin had an unhealthy pallor to it. He was staring at the floor, his face covered in shadow. His blonde hair hung down and concealed his frightened eyes.
So, he waited. He waited until the sun sunk behind the horizon and the stars twinkled out of the darkness.
But he got something else entirely.
He fought back a curse and approached the frustrated guard with a smile. He tried to mimic Gregory’s voice but was worried it still sounded off,” Hello, where are you taking this prisoner?”
He collapsed on the bed, slipping his shoes and glasses off. Exhaustion and lightheadedness pulled at his eyelids and he passed out almost instantly.
Harry didn’t think he could refuse at this point. But in all honesty he didn’t think that any bandage would stop the bleeding.
It was only copying what it had heard already.
“Harry. What did I say about going out alone?” He sounded annoyed and slightly relieved at the sight of Harry.
Draco waited for Harry to snap out of his shock and call his partner in to arrest him. He couldn’t make himself look into Harry’s eyes. He didn’t deserve to make eye contact with him.
“Hi.”
Once Harry realized something was wrong he dug out a flashlight and scoured the woods for him late into the night. The only thing he’d found was his axe a few yards out from the cabin. It was like he’d vanished into thin air.
He forced himself to glance up at Harry’s face. The bright green eyes instantly found his and he thought he might melt beneath their intensity. His hair was as wild and un-kept as it always was.
After Harry visited Draco in Azkaban he followed one of the guards home. He had known him briefly from when he’d served as an auror but he’d soon tired of the chase and had been transferred. Now he worked as a guard. He knew he didn’t have long to come up with an idea so he was forced to act fast.
“It wouldn’t be the first time you missed one.”
Harry knew he’d been let off extremely easily. If he’d been anyone else he’d have been thrown into Azkaban for life or worse. People had been Kissed for much less. The ministry wasn’t wasting space for Death Eaters or Death Eater sympathizers anymore. They’d escaped too many times. They’d made a fool of the ministry. And the ministry was going to make sure they were taken care of.
There were people who’d been arrested for a lot less. He probably deserved it.
Whenever he dared to venture into town to steal food (no one would ever sell to a Death Eater) he was always put in great risk. Because of this he waited until he was entirely out of food meaning he was desperate. Being desperate meant being stupid.
A harsh red light filled the morning air and the man dropped with a dull thud.
Who knows, maybe if he did fight he could get them to kill him. It was better than the alternative.
But Draco needed to sleep.
It was just a stupid supply run.
Oh, if only he could do today over again. He never would’ve gone out there while Draco was still sleeping.
That’d never work. He would ask to see his hand immediately. As he always did when Harry injured himself.
But he didn’t.
The cobblestone flooring echoed dimly as Harry rushed passed occupied cells. Wizards shouted at him as he passed. Some mockingly, some pleading for help. They all knew their sentence, even if their trial hadn’t come yet.
“You .. you don’t want to see it. Trust me.”
“You not sleeping isn’t going to fix me.” He sighed heavily and slid off the bed, his arm throbbing,” Help me get these bloody sheets off, would you?”
Almost immediately a horrible thought popped into his head. He could lie. Tell him he scratched his hand on something.
After no response he raised his voice,” Yeah, Harry?!”
“Draco.” His voice wavered anyways,” I .. I know. I’m sorry.”
But he couldn’t and now he found himself hesitating outside of the boarded house that Draco was surely awake inside of.
“Harry!”
Harry knew it was only going to be harder the longer he waited. Especially when the symptoms started.
Draco let out a huff as his eyelids slid shut and he was finally able to sleep feeling safe and warm.
Harry had watched as the hours slipped by expecting him to appear from the tree line, only he never did.
He squeezed Draco’s hand until his fingers coiled around Harry’s.
He hurried over to Draco and grabbed his arm, pulling it away from the woman’s grasp. He gently placed one hand on his cheek and caressed it,” Hey. we’re getting out of here, hold on tight okay.”
Harry swallowed stiffly and shook his head,” I don’t know. I..I’ll find a way. I promise.”
All he needed was the hair, which he would soon have. Draco’s trial was tomorrow meaning he had to get him out that same day. They never waited long after the trial to administer the... punishment.
He was sure if he got some sleep all of this would go away.
Of course, Harry teased him for it but it gave him something to do while he was alone.
It wasn’t long after that when Draco failed to return from gathering firewood.
He knew what the bite meant.
“Yes. I do.” He took a strained breath and approached slowly,” At least let me change your bandage. It’s not … working.”
“Draco?” The voice was quiet and full of confusion.
“How..?”
Instead he tossed the crumpled note towards him and quickly backed away, hurrying towards the door he’d entered through.
“What’s wrong? You’re acting…. Strange. You.. you’re bleeding.” Draco’s eyes fixated on the crimson that was dotting the floor and then quickly found Harry’s hand,” What happened?”
“Draco.”
Harry scoffed,” You know the incubation period is two to three days, I can stand just fine, thank you.”
The hideous bloody mess that marred his skin.
“Did you want to sleep more?” Draco asked when he had finished with the bed.
His heart thudded violently in his chest. It was Draco. He would recognize that voice anywhere.
“Harry..” Draco took a shuddering breath,” What.. what did they decide... to do with you.”
The footsteps came to a stop and a surprised gasp sounded from the end of the isle. He waited for the yell that would bring backup but it didn’t come.
In an instant he was at the window, pressing his face against the cold glass.
Even inside the building his skin was covered in moisture. He pushed his discomfort down and focused on why he was there at all. Yesterday, Draco was being held on the third story so it was safe to assume he’d still be there. Harry quickly found the stone staircase and began to climb. He fought to keep his breathing steady as he reached the third level. The corridor seemed to travel on for forever in both directions as Harry exited the stairs.
Priya Patil was a tall, striking woman with black hair that fell to her waist and sharp dark eyes that could make even the bravest witch or wizard shake in their boots. Harry remembered vividly the day she had walked up to him at the Ministry when he’d been leaving the Auror’s office.
Angelina Johnson and George Weasley were the next through, glowing with the excitement of the very freshly engaged. Draco liked Angelina immensely and thus had grown to like George. He was awfully loud, but Draco had to admit that he adored Angelina and made her very happy. He hadn’t missed a Puddlemere match in the two years they had been together and was often seen wearing a
“No one has ever… How did you…” For the first time in perhaps his entire life, Draco looked completely speechless.
Under any other circumstances Harry would have teased him about being such a sap but when he looked back at his best friend he realised that Ron was right: he was a lucky man. He had everything he’d ever wanted and he was perfectly satisfied with it all.
“I just wanted to tell you, before you found out from anyone else, that I’m sort of dating someone,” she said quietly.
The first game took place the day after that initial awkward breakfast. Harry was watching from the bench and, from the offset, it was clear to him that the Thestrals were the weaker team. McManus and O'Flaherty just weren’t gelling, Wood let in a few easy goals, and no one seemed on top form - no one except Malfoy. The casual observer wouldn’t have noticed the skill inherent in the way he played, but Harry could see it all in excruciating detail. He was one of the most controlled, relaxed players Harry had ever seen until he caught sight of the Snitch. It was impossible to tell the exact moment he saw it; one moment he was hovering high above the pitch and the next he was dropping - no - diving towards the flash of gold. As the Snitch darted and sped off, he saw Malfoy lean forward almost imperceptibly, and speed up, arm outstretched. The other Seeker hardly stood a chance.
“Great,” He sneered. But just then Harry saw Snape advancing on them out of the corner of his eye and decided he’d better leg it back to the Gryffindor table before he lost any more points for his house. He gave Colin another apologetic pat on the shoulder, which made the small boy blush furiously and forget about his misery for a few moments. Harry did feel bad really, even though Colin was beyond annoying, he was just a kid, and Malfoy really was being a prize twat.
“He’s rehabilitating his image, and doing a damn good job of it too.” She tapped her quill against her lip thoughtfully. “This has got Parkinson’s grubby little fingers all over it.”
“He’ll be in for a good shot of qualifying, if Campbell keeps playing the way he has been.”
Brisbane was hotter than Sydney, or maybe it just felt that way because it was so bloody humid. Harry could practically hear his hair expanding as soon as he stepped outside.
He chose a pair of black dress pants and a white shirt but left his dress robes hanging up — he’d put them on later when the formal festivities started. Just as he was pulling on his shoes Harry came in, still in his stupid little shorts and a hooded sweatshirt.
“Harry!” He turned to see Dean grinning at him, Seamus by his side. “Ginny said you might be coming. It’s really good to see you, mate.” Harry let himself be dragged into a tight hug, and then another with Seamus.
Thank you to
This was such a bad idea. Harry’s shoulders were tense under the invisibility cloak as he made his way as silently as possible towards the third-floor boys' bathroom. It had only been a few days since the Mrs. Norris incident and so he felt justified in being a little bit anxious. He knew if Hermione knew what he was doing she would probably have an aneurysm, especially as she had absolutely forbidden him from going, but it was too good of an opportunity to pass up. He did feel a little guilty about not waking Ron up, but he wasn’t keen on dragging him into what was objectively a terrible idea. Besides, he’d told Malfoy to come alone so it was only fair of him to honour that too, and if Malfoy had brought any friends Harry could always just slip away in the cloak before he saw them.
“It certainly does, Murph! They’ve been swapping insults in the press since their last game, and it looks as though it might come to blows now.”
Harry awoke from a dream about soft blond hair and cold hands with a start, to Ron’s freckled face staring down at his.
“I’m not a child, Malfoy. Give me some credit,” Harry spat back.
Draco tsked. “If you just cast a light Stasis on them when they were freshly pressed you wouldn’t have this problem. Or better yet, you could purchase some nicer robes.”
“Great,” Harry retorted and hung up on him.
Benjy looked at him with those sharp eyes. “Don’t apologise. You’ve been dealing with things the best you can, that’s all anyone can ask of you.”
He made himself look back at her, pushing the horrible feeling down with another swig of beer. “Right.” He forced a laugh. “Yeah, of course.”
Getting back to England was a relief, but not in the way Harry would have thought. He found that, as he walked through his front door, his house felt dark and a bit miserable after the wide and bright open spaces of Australia. It didn’t help that so many of the rooms were still closed up, with the furniture covered in sheets. The sparseness of his life which had felt safe and cosy a month ago now felt a bit claustrophobic.
He fumbled for the green button and pressed it to his ear.
“Oh,” Draco’s cheeks were very pink. “I see.”
“You looked like you were having a nice time out there.” Harry wished he could just stop but it wasn’t happening.
“Thanks, mate.” Ron’s ears were a bit red but he looked pleased.
“Yes. I mean no. I just… want to understand.” Harry watched him.
Malfoy looked up at him, regarding him lazily and smugly through his lashes, and turned his head slightly. Suddenly, Harry could feel himself through Malfoy’s cheek, and he could feel the pressure of his hand on his own dick. He could feel himself inside Malfoy, and it was almost too much to bear.
Malfoy laughed breathlessly. “Awfully confident, aren’t we?”
And then he remembered that he hadn’t even got Colin’s camera back. Swearing under his breath, he rolled over and, after about 15 minutes of tossing and turning, managed to fall into a restless sleep.
They lay next to each other for a long time afterwards, catching their breath. Harry wasn’t sure if it was the wedding or the sex but something felt different, more settled, in his chest. The sex had been pretty great, to be fair. It was always great with Draco, but they’d never done it like that, and Harry was struggling to process his feelings about it. It wasn’t better or worse than the sex he’d had with women, but it felt different somehow - more intense. Like he hadn’t been certain where he ended and Draco began.
“Subtle?” Harry blinked at him.
Harry sent him a grateful smile. It felt good to have everyone on the team patting him on the back, even if all the attention was a tad embarrassing. When he looked up, he caught Malfoy’s eye from the other side of the table. Harry’s breath caught slightly in his throat at the expression on his face. He looked intense and focused, the way he looked when he was diving for the Snitch.
“Is that why you’ve been staying here?”
As soon as he got to his new room he practically sprinted to the shower, tearing his sweaty clothes off as he went. He didn’t take an actual breath until he felt the water hit him, cold because he hadn’t given it time to heat up. The icy water felt wonderful on his overheated skin, and he leant his head against the tiles miserably, trying to catch his breath.
As it turned out, Draco was loud.
“Alright,” she said slowly. “Would you consider coming to the pub with us all on Thursday then? Ginny won’t be there.”
The team had started training for the World Cup playoffs, as well as gearing up for the regular season with Puddlemere, so most of Harry’s mornings were spent on conditioning and fitness training, followed by strategy and drills practice in the afternoons. By the end of each day, he barely had enough energy to shuck his clothes and collapse into bed.
It didn’t improve much once he’d opened the curtains. The air was thick with dust and the sheets on the sofa and chairs were yellowish and unappealing.
“I’ve been thinking about this all afternoon,” he murmured, trying to undo Harry’s shirt with one hand while the other slid down the back of Harry’s trousers. “I’m going to ruin you.”
There was a prolonged pause. “Well, you certainly know how to kill the mood, don’t you?” Malfoy said dryly.
Harry couldn’t think of anything to say so he just started shoving things back into his bag.
Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood arrived a few minutes late — apparently Lovegood had got it into her head that they needed to bring some special kind of bulb, which had been a nightmare to harvest. Harry accepted the bag that she handed him with a look of extreme trepidation as it seemed to be trying to run away.
His mind wandered to Malfoy. The Scottish team had beaten Belgium about four hours ago, and so he’d probably still be there. Harry wondered if he’d be in his hotel room too.
Her chin began to tremble dangerously.
His eyes strayed in the direction that Krum and Charlie had gone and saw them sharing a plate of hors d'oeuvres, heads bowed together, just a little too close to one another.
Malfoy’s press conferences had also become notorious for his snarky comments and he had gained a few enemies and a legion of fans. Harry couldn’t understand it, but apparently the bad boy of British Quidditch (as he was quickly coming to be known) was irresistible to young witches and wizards up and down the country. There was a rumour that he had received invitations to the Yule Ball from over fifty per cent of the final year girls at Hogwarts.
for more incredible art.
“It’s not a matter of wanting to - there’s nothing else I’d rather do once I finish playing.” The muscle in Draco’s jaw twitched. “It’s just a shame that no one in the wizarding world would trust me with their kneazle, let alone their children.”
She didn’t reply, too busy gazing up at Harry adoringly.
,” Draco read. “Merlin, there’s blood in this one too but I’m pretty sure it’s human.”
Harry made a noise of frustration. “Because it's not fair. Ever since you said that my head’s been all messed up and it’s your fault.”
“Really?” Malfoy drawled, and the tone of it made the hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stand on end.
Thank you to
“Why don’t you hit me?” Malfoy said calmly. They were so close that Harry could have just pushed him off his broom if he wanted to. “Give the people what they want.”
It took him a good few minutes to pull himself together enough to climb down and walk out into the bathroom, by which time Malfoy was long gone. As he walked toward the door Harry caught sight of himself in one of the mirrors in the centre of the room. He moved closer to get a better look, almost not recognising himself at first. The boy looking back at him still had dodgy glasses, unruly hair, green eyes, and a scar, but Harry felt as though he was looking at a stranger. The last time he had looked in the mirror he had been brushing his teeth in the Gryffindor boys bathroom, getting ready to fight Malfoy. The last time he had looked in the mirror he hadn’t been kissed, and now he had, and by Malfoy of all people.
Angelina hugged it to her chest. “It’s nothing,” she exclaimed a little too loudly.
Harry abandoned his packing. “That is not it.”
Harry ignored him.
Harry had a feeling that it was Draco who was avoiding his gaze now, fussing with the cuff a little longer than he needed to. Harry wanted to kiss him but he wasn’t sure whether or not he was allowed to. Was that what they were doing?
Harry started to run towards the living room and had to force himself to walk at a reasonable pace. Before stepping into the Floo, he glanced in the mirror and grimaced. He was still wearing his shirt and suit trousers, but his bow tie had come undone and was hanging loose around his neck, and there was no knowing where his robes had gone. He thought about getting changed, but for some reason he was in a rush to get to Draco’s. He didn’t want to waste any time.
Harry laughed, in spite of himself. “You know, Malfoy said something similar to me last week.”
“Rest,” she replied firmly. “And by that, I mean lying down and having your meals brought to you.” She turned to Draco. “You’ll need someone to keep an eye on you too, at least for the first week. Do you want me to call anyone for you?”
“Thanks for the support,” he groaned, dropping his head into his hands. “What am I going to do?”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow at him. “I just assumed. You never go home with any of the Australians.”
“It is,” Draco snapped back.
Draco paused and then took a small step forward and, with a hand on either side of his face, kissed Harry. He pushed Harry, still kissing him, back into the room and kicked the door shut behind him. “Is this okay?” He breathed and Harry made a noise that he hoped communicated full and complete permission.
It was oddly soothing to watch, like a nature documentary. Ginny had never really been one for intense beauty routines, which had suited Harry just fine, but as a result, he’d never seen anyone put as much work into their appearance as Malfoy. What was extra odd was that, in Harry’s opinion, Malfoy was just as annoyingly good-looking before the routine as he was at the end.
Harry scoffed and tried to shoulder past Malfoy but he stepped in front again, using his height advantage to trap Harry. “Let me go,” Harry ground out.
“Thank you… Oh, Harry!” She beamed as they placed the pan down carefully. Once it was safely deposited, she dusted her hands on her apron and squeezed Harry tightly. “My dear, you made it. You played terrifically! We’re all very proud of you.”
He clutched his beer like a lifeline while Dean and Seamus regaled them with stories of their adventures travelling around America together. It was funny to think that while he had been stewing in his own misery the rest of the world had continued without him. It made his problems seem rather insignificant if he was perfectly honest.
The next few weeks were so hectic that Harry almost managed to forget about the little slip of paper burning a hole in his wallet. Almost.
“Cool things off?” Draco asked, voice perfectly even.
He leant forward, using his hand under Malfoys chin to pull him forward too.
“So.” She looked up again and he glanced away quickly and guiltily. “Are you going to tell me why you’ve moved into a new room or am I going to have to drag it out of you?”
“Chilly?” That exasperated tone was back. “Potter, do you know you’re terrible at this?”
“Since when has Harry Potter cared about what is and isn’t a good idea?” Benjy asked, cocking his head to one side. “You know, my mentor had something that she used to say whenever I was afraid to take a risk. ‘Benjy,’ she used to say. ‘Grow a pair’”
Having completed his errands, he decided to pop into the bookshop to see if he could find something for Hermione. As soon as he stepped in, however, he was instantly distracted. Along one wall was the largest collection of Quidditch magazines he’d ever seen, in every language he’d ever seen.
“I did. Lots of them, but I drove most of them away.” He shrugged and then his brow furrowed and he looked at Harry with concern. “Did you have a nanny who took care of you when you had a cold?”
This self-satisfaction lasted right up until he walked out onto the field and saw him.
“Oh,” Malfoy said again, disbelievingly, this time with a hint of amusement. “You’re a virgin?”
“I wanted to tell you…” Ron paused. “We just found out that we’re having a girl.”
Draco blinked and squeezed Harry’s wrist with his free hand,” W-what’re you doing.. here. You.. you have to be in enough trouble... already.”
Harry blinked himself back to attention and pulled a small slip of parchment out of his robes, quickly writing on it with a strange muggle contraption. Once he was done he moved towards Draco to hand him the note but stopped when he flinched away from him.
“Sorry, ma lad, I didn’t mean to give ya a fright,” he chuckled in an Australian accent which seemed to curl up at the ends.
Eventually, Hermione and Ron left to tell their families about the pregnancy and Harry was left alone again. He couldn’t get Draco’s face when he was stepping into the Floo out of his head, the little edge of fear at the corner of his eyes.
“I don’t know,” he’d whispered. “I always thought I’d be an Auror. It feels like the right thing to do.”
“Right,” Harry replied faintly. He and Ron had never been very good at talking about sex. It had been fine when they were young but then Harry had started dating Ron’s sister and Ron had started dating Hermione and it had just felt a bit sleazy to talk about in any great detail. “What do you want to know?”
She pulled herself up to her full height of just over three foot. “I want to be a student here but I don’t know how to fly.” She jutted her chin bravely but there was something very vulnerable in the set of her jaw.
Harry gaped at her. “What? Really?”
“Let me get this straight,” Ginny said calmly. Too calmly. “You have been sleeping together and calling each other when you’re in separate countries for nearly a year. You aren’t sleeping with anyone else. You went to Scotland for a week to nurse him back to health when he was injured.”
“It was nice,” Harry insisted. “You’re a good host.”
. He padded carefully down the hallway, taking care to keep his footsteps light so that his tattered old trainers didn’t squeak on the grey tiles. The end of the hallway curved around a corner, with a storage cupboard on one side, and then opened up to the bathroom itself. Harry peeked around and caught sight of Malfoy’s shock of white-blond hair and black and green robes. As it was after-hours the only lights in the bathroom were low burning torches in the wall sockets that cast long shadows, giving the high-ceiling room a cave-like quality. In this light, the blond boy looked tiny and somehow even paler than usual, as if Harry could see right through him if he looked hard enough. He was standing in the middle of the bathroom, wand in one hand, nibbling anxiously on the thumbnail of the other. Harry could see a pair of checkered pyjama pants poking out from under his robes and for some reason, it relieved a bit of his anxiety and inexplicably he had to press his lips together to stop a nervous giggle escaping. Honestly, he was a bit impressed that he’d actually shown up. He considered for a moment leaving or hexing Malfoy while he was invisible, but his conscience got the better of him. As far as he could see Malfoy hadn’t brought any of his cronies with him unless Crabbe or Goyle were hiding in one of the cubicles waiting to jump out at Harry the moment he revealed himself.
Harry’s palms began to sweat. “No. I mean - we’ll yes, obviously, but I don’t know what it means.”
Ginny pursed her lips. “Not to be that ex who tells you how to live your life, but I know how bad you are at having fun. You need to let loose once in a while, it isn’t healthy to deny yourself.”
“Sorry,” he’d spluttered. “Who are you?”
Harry did as he was told, flying towards him. He watched in amazement as Malfoy repeated the move he’d used in their first game. Never breaking eye contact, he turned his body and broom towards the left. Harry turned with him, but then, still facing left, his whole body and broom moved to the right and Harry found himself in the empty air where Malfoy had been.
“Yes, my great-aunt was somewhat of an inventor. She had a particular passion for adapting Muggle technology for magical use.” Draco flicked his wand and the doors flew open. “You can see why my father disliked her so much.”
“Both,” he replied finally. “I shouldn’t have made such a big deal out of it, but you shouldn’t have said what you said either.”
“Oi, no fighting, you lot,” Davies said sternly, appearing at Harry’s side. “I don’t want to give the frogs any more reason to look down on us.”
“Shut up,” Harry laughed. “How can you be eligible to play for Scotland though?”
“I thought you were dating that girl, Camille whatshername?”
Finally, thank you to you for opening this and (hopefully) reading it! I hope you enjoy!
“That is not… Am not sorry to win. But you were hurt.” He was rolling his glass between his big hands.
“Uh, hi,” he tried. “Sorry about that. Not very good with international travel.”
“Oh?” Benjy leaned in. “Well, you have to tell me now.”
“It’s no good you trying to be brave - I’ve been through this and worse so I know you must have a bloody sore head.” Harry watched him carefully.
Norway were one of the weaker teams on the table and England beat them without much fuss. It felt good to be back on the pitch and Harry began to get a little excited about the competition.
“Priya Patil, Patil Sports Management.” She had given him a brief and convincing sales pitch and within a week he was considering a contract with Puddlemere.
Maybe he just hadn’t noticed his latent homophobia because he’d never actually been around gay men who touched each other? There was a horrible thought. Harry immediately felt sick with guilt.  He thought briefly about floo-calling Charlie and asking him if he’d ever accidentally offended him, but when he glanced at the time he realised that he’d probably be asleep and waking him up to ask if he had ever offended him felt like a lateral move. He wished that Hermione was there to talk him down.
(See the end of the chapter for
He managed to find one at the station next to Draco’s room. After casting a seemingly endless number of diagnostic charms, she pulled a vial of an emerald green potion from her robes.
“You called me!”
“Look, if we’re not going to fight then I think I’ll go back to bed,” Harry said a bit desperately, turning to walk back towards the door.
“I told her that we were sleeping together,” Harry wondered briefly if that was allowed.
Harry took another step forward while Draco’s eyes tracked him carefully, and sat down on the bed, still in his formal clothes. He ran his fingers gently over the sharpness of Draco’s collarbone, the broad plane of his chest. He felt like he was looking at him for the very first time.
Malfoy shrugged, taking a large sip of bubbles, the tips of his ears very pink. “It wasn’t awful.”
It was hard to think objectively about it because he was still hurt and angry with Draco, but the worst part of it all was the little voice in his head that wondered if he was right. Would he lose interest when he won? He wanted to say no but part of him wasn’t sure. He’d spent so much of the past four years working towards this moment, and being so certain that it would fix everything.
Harry laughed too. “Alright, cheers. I’ll keep that in mind. Goodnight, Malfoy.”
Harry was fuming by the time he got back on the pitch.
Harry watched as he reached waist depth and then dove gracefully into the freezing water.
“Alright, thank you,” Harry sent her a dark look. “That’s very helpful.”
Harry felt euphoric. The club was filled to bursting but the crowd seemed to move out of the way for Malfoy. The lights changed his white-blond hair to pink, purple, red, green. His white shirt was unbuttoned enough to expose his sternum dusted in glitter, the rest of the shirt sticking to the sweat on his stomach and back. Malfoy pushed through the crowd until they reached a back corner where the shadows would prevent any of their teammates who were scattered throughout the club from seeing them, and dragged Harry into a rough kiss.
“Oh.” He cleared his throat. “Hi.”
“Not bad.” Harry turned to see Ginny surveying the scene with an appreciative look on her face. As best man and maid of honour they were the first people to arrive. “Our wedding would not have been this nice,” Ginny said, giving him a wry smile.
Harry paused his packing and swallowed thickly. “I got a letter from Davies.”
“I just, er… I just came to say that what you said was totally out of line.”
“Do they actually do anything?” he asked before he could stop himself.
“You look…” he started, and then swallowed.
“I…” Harry's mouth was suddenly very dry.
Once again, thank you to my incredible editor, flatmate, wine review colleague and friend Lucy for everything you do.
“Hello, Una. This is Harry Potter. He will be staying here for a week or so while I recover.”
The rest of the evening was the most comfortable Christmas he could remember having had for a very long time.
“They had the America’s Cup here in 2000,” Tamsin Applebee told him as they stood on the deck overlooking the boats.
Harry had absolutely no response to that so he settled on giving her a dark look.
“Sorry for interrupting your… alone time.” Harry tried to sound normal.
“You’ve earned it, Potter. I know this hasn’t been the easiest week.” She had to yell directly into his ear to be heard and he winced, hoping no one else at the table had heard her. The bar was much louder than the one in Sydney had been, with the bass almost shaking the tables.
” he read and then stepped back when Draco flipped it open and an overpowering stench of old fish filled the room. “Fucking hell!”
“Oh.” He patted her head warily. “Why don’t we go over and find some of your classmates then? I think a few of them are your cousins.”
He kicked the table leg again.
“Why?” Malfoy demanded, sitting up a bit.
Draco rolled his eyes.
Krum gave him a serious look. “You will win. Like I say: best player.”
Draco yelped and pulled the blankets even closer around himself. He knew he was being childish but he wanted to stay in the perfect, safe warmth for a few more moments.
Malfoy said something back to her which made her throw her head back and laugh, long dark hair glittering in the bar’s low light. They talked in low voices for a few more moments before, to Harry’s alarm, they began to make their way towards Harry.
It wasn’t until he was halfway down the corridor that he realised that the feeling making his heart pound wasn’t anger.
Harry stepped forward jerkily, and Draco didn’t stop. He kept watching Harry with that same intensity. Harry was torn between wanting to join him and not wanting to ruin the picture in front of him.
“Fucking ow,” he hissed as he hopped over to a chair and sat down, massaging his foot.
“I need a drink,” Malfoy announced suddenly.
The next painting depicted a young Catriona McCormack in her Pride of Portree gear, lifting the League Cup above her head and grinning from ear to ear.
“What do you mean?” Harry demanded.
“I don’t know if I’m gay. I might be bisexual.” Harry felt oddly proud of himself for saying it out loud.
“Then why aren’t you out celebrating with the team?”
They took off almost simultaneously, leaning forward and forward on their brooms as they dove. They were so close Harry felt like they were moving in sync.
“Oi, Potter.” Harry nearly fell off his broom in surprise at the sound of Draco’s voice. He turned to see what he wanted. “Maybe if you spent more time looking for the Snitch and less time simpering over your fans you’d have a World Cup already.”
“Like a character,” Harry said, thinking hard.
Harry stared at the cover of Witch Weekly - which sported a half-naked Malfoy, reclining lazily on a pile of Golden Snitches - in abject horror. It was exactly the kind of photoshoot Harry had allowed himself to be talked into early in his career and he’d learned the hard way that no amount of makeup or photo editing could make him look suave while posing. The same, unfortunately, could not be said for Malfoy. He looked ridiculous in his Quidditch leathers and boots, sans jersey, but undeniably cool. The photo was a loop of him throwing one of the Snitches into the air and then catching it and looking directly into the camera with a smirk.
“Alone time?” Harry repeated, his brain moving very slowly.
She flicked a lock of her short black hair over her shoulder and indicated for him to follow her back down the corridor. When they reached a small, empty office, Pansy directed him into it and he went without argument.
He’d heard him wrong. Clearly.
He gasped out,” Draco.”
It would be impossible to get Draco out entering azkaban as a civilian. Everyone entering and leaving was monitored closely. All visitors had their wands removed while they were on the grounds. On top of that all non-staff had a spell placed over them that forbid them from using magic. Just in case you swiped a wand while inside.
He just hoped they would keep their distance today he didn’t need a forced replay of his worst experiences. He had enough to be worried about already.
He felt stuck. If he left he was giving up on Draco entirely, which he couldn’t do.
Harry shrugged,” You need to sleep. If you lay down I’ll lay back down.”
“Yes, it’s clear. You don’t trust my judgement?”
His grey eyes were full of disbelief and despair as realization fully sank in. His jaw tensed and he took a step towards Harry,” Show me.”
“I don’t think so. You don’t even work this floor. Now get back to your station before someone notices you abandoned your post. Excuse me.” She glared at him and continued forwards, pulling a trembling Draco after her.
“Soon.” Harry decided.
He found himself sitting at the dining room table, a lantern lit in the center of it. The inky blackness of the night seemed to permeate inside of the cabin and battled with the faint light flickering from the lantern.
“Oh..” He nodded stiffly and stared into the distance, his lip trembling slightly,” okay.”
He added the hair to his Polyjuice potion and watched as it bubbled and writhed before downing it rapidly. He would never get used to the taste and texture as it inched down his throat. Skin starting to bubble he quickly changed into the stolen robes and watched in fascination as his body morphed to fit them perfectly.
He never should’ve gone out without Draco. He’d known better. But he’d grown complacent.
Pushing himself back up he sauntered to the edge of the bed and sank onto it, leaning against Draco,” We are going to have to talk about it.”
“Yes, well,” Harry sighed. “I think the ship has more or less sailed on that one.”
Harry didn’t see the Bludger coming, but he heard it speed past. He had just enough time to twist around and watch it collide with the side of Draco’s head with that sickening crunch he remembered so well. He didn’t even realise he had turned and was flying towards Draco until he heard Davies bellowing his name through the spell in his ear.
Harry felt the usual pang that came with thinking of Cedric, and then the larger pang that came from remembering anyone who’d died in the war. “Right,” he blinked at the ceiling.
She just shrugged. “Tough love, mate, that’s what you need.”
They lay like that for a while, not sleeping but not quite awake yet, until Harry exhaled gently into Draco’s neck.
“Alright, never mind then,” Harry glowered and started to walk out of the bathroom.
It was an unreasonably cold night, even the paintings seemed to be dressed a little more warmly, and Harry prayed that he wouldn’t pass anyone as his breath was turning to steam in front of his eyes. By some miracle he didn’t, he could hear Peeves creating havoc in some faraway classroom and hoped that that was keeping any nearby teachers occupied. He hesitated a few metres away from the door to the bathroom, nibbling unconsciously on the inside of his cheek before steeling himself.
“He said that I jeopardised the team by abandoning the Snitch during the final and that if I can’t put my ego aside to be a good player he will have to look elsewhere for England’s Seeker.” Harry’s voice sounded hollow and croaky even to his own ears.
“Morgana’s saggy knickers, I cannot believe I almost married you,” Ginny sighed, throwing her hands up dramatically.
He turned his head and body towards the left and she followed, but he wasn’t there. Instead, he’d gone to the right where the Snitch was fluttering about ten meters away. He had reached it and closed his hand around it before she had even realised what had happened.
“I think your pain potion is kicking in,” Harry replied, with some relief. “I should leave you to rest.”
He’d wondered whether the connection between them had weakened over the past few weeks, but as he felt Draco’s strong legs intertwine with his under the water, any lingering doubts dissolved. It was a lovely kiss, not hurried or drunken like so many of theirs had been, just long and gentle and sweet. They kissed until Harry could no longer feel his hands, lips, or, most alarmingly, his lower body.
Draco shook his head. “Never even married.”
“Harry…” He looked up at her finally. She was nearly three months pregnant now, and it had made her cheeks fuller and her eyes brighter. She looked younger than usual, and it made Harry’s heart hurt.
“What? No, I think I saw it in the paper.” Harry felt all prickly with embarrassment. “What is your type then?”
“Alright, alright, break it up you two,” Wood bellowed, just as Harry was reaching for his wand.
“Ooh, touchy,” Malfoy smirked as he took his hands off the broom, holding them up in mock surrender. “I hope I haven’t said anything to upset you. Surely the golden boy doesn’t get ruffled over a few silly comments in the paper.”
“No. Putting his career aside, leave him alone.” She watched him carefully. “He is not as tough as you think.”
“You know, you’re a lot of things, Potter, but I never had you pegged for a bigot. It’s refreshing that even after all these years you can still surprise me with your ability to reach new and exciting heights of wankerdom.”
Draco shook his head in amusement. “It’s possible. I always thought that your adoration of Cedric Diggory was more than platonic.”
“No,” he said again, tugging lightly at the thread.
“No, I just want another one.” He tried not to sound too annoyed - now that he’d made his decision he just wanted to get it over with.
“Why don’t you make me?”
Harry hated international Portkeys with a passion. He was notorious amongst his teammates for being a wet blanket for the rest of the day following one. They made him feel like his insides had been taken out, shaken up and put back in wrong. Australia was the furthest he’d ever travelled via Portkey and it seemed endless, the only things not spinning were his hand and the Portkey - a pink pen with a pom-pom on the end.
He didn’t miss the confused look that Hermione and Ron shared. “How long is a while?” she asked gently.
“It’s a historical artifact,” Draco insisted, reaching for another volume but Harry caught his wrist before he could pull it out.
Parvati’s office was on the 15th floor of a wizarding office building in central London, with a wall of glass that overlooked the Thames. It was spacious and modern, and when he walked in she was sat behind a long glass desk dictating a letter to a frantically scribbling quill.
“Weird.” He directed Harry towards a table in the middle of the store covered in an overwhelming array of phones. “You’ll want something basic, then. Do you need a camera?”
“Oh, right.” Harry couldn’t help the smile on his face. “Well, that’s good then.”
The awful icing on the miserable cake of Harry’s day was when Wood handed him and Malfoy matching room keys upon arrival at the team hotel. The realisation dawned that he would be spending the next month sharing a room with Malfoy. Harry wondered if it was too late to get back on the Portkey.
Harry did his best to ignore him, leaning out towards the little gold ball that was just out of reach, but Malfoy was still bloody talking. “No, I don’t think we’ll be doing that right now.”
“It’s Draco, actually, but I’ll take it.” Harry didn’t need his glasses to know Malfoy was smirking. He groaned again and pushed his face deeper into the pillow. Malfoy sighed. “As much as I wish that we could stay here all day exchanging witty banter you do actually need to get up.”
had managed to get such a flattering photo of Malfoy moments after an international Portkey trip. The last time Harry had returned from a trip abroad, they’d published a photo of him so hideous that George had had it framed and given it to Ron for Christmas.
Harry’s throat tightened. “Fuck off.”
“The World Cup?” Malfoy laughed for real then. “Good grief, Potter, you are something else.”
After that, it was Oliver Wood, Roger Davies and Maxine O'Flaherty in quick succession. Next were Benjy Wiliams and his six-year-old daughter Zoe who, much to Draco’s amusement, was so in love with Harry that she could do nothing but stare up at him.
“Cheers,” Ron snorted, but he seemed a little bit more relaxed.
“I just wanted to say…” He swallowed. “That I didn’t mean to make things weird when I left.”
Draco smirked, and it did extremely odd things to Harry’s stomach. “Ah, but the difference is, I can do that because I’m extremely talented.”
Catriona’s smile grew even wider. “Played against or been beaten by?” she asked in her broad Scottish brogue.
It all started with a commotion at the end of the Slytherin table during breakfast. Harry couldn’t really tell what was going on until little Colin Creevey ran up to him, looking close to tears.
He didn’t really have a plan of where he was going, so he was surprised to find himself in Muggle London, walking down a very charming lane lined with shops. Since he was already here, he thought he might as well see if he could get a mobile phone. Not for Malfoy, of course - just because it felt a bit silly that he didn't have one when so many of his friends did. After a few more minutes of walking, he spied a shop claiming to sell technology and figured that was as good a bet as any.
Draco laughed. “Merlin, no. Do you think I have time to do that sort of thing?”
“No, I suppose not,” Harry replied, lamely. He imagined for a fleeting moment, as he had so many times before, what their wedding would have been like. He’d always pictured something similar to Bill and Fleur’s but that may have been because that was the only wedding he’d ever attended. It suddenly occurred to him that that might not have been Ginny’s style at all. “I didn’t realise that Hermione was so good at this kind of thing.”
Just as he was about to make up his mind there was a noise from the corridor outside and they both jumped away from each other. He glanced over Draco’s shoulder and saw there was no one there, but the moment was broken and Draco was already stepping away. With a mutter, he transfigured his cuffs and fastened them. He glanced back at Harry, running a critical eye over his robes. He did a complicated little movement with his wand and Harry felt his robes lift and then drop, creases gone.
“Ah,” Harry attempted, sending a worried look to Draco who looked like a deer in headlights. “Hello. It’s not… I mean, I can explain…”
Harry fell back onto his pillows, hoping the room was dark enough to hide his embarrassment. “Yeah, well. It’s not like that, okay?”
Malfoy pursed his lips but gave no reply, and Harry took a large bite of his sandwich. They ate in silence for a few minutes before Malfoy finished his food and got up without saying anything. Harry watched with a sense of accomplishment as he stalked out of the cafeteria. He had got the last word, and Malfoy hadn’t tried to hex him. He counted that as a win.
Harry felt a swell of an odd combination of pride, affection and grief in his chest. There was something so straightforward and solid about Hermione and Ron’s relationship, and for a long time Harry had thought that that was what he wanted. He’d struggled to understand why he and Ginny couldn’t be like that, but now, watching the two people he loved most in the world marry each other, he got it.
“I think Williams would be the one more likely to end up with a shiner,” Ron snorted, taking a long pull of his coffee. “Oh, speaking of Wood - I heard he’s been tapped to captain the Scottish team.”
“No one,” Harry insisted. “There’s no she.” It wasn’t
Together they all headed towards the main sitting room, Draco still carrying Rose in his arms even though she was getting a little too big to do so comfortably.
“Oh,” Harry said, without really meaning to and then felt his neck redden when Malfoy gave him a look.
Harry blinked at her. Suddenly he had a lot more questions for Ron and Hermione.
“Don’t,” he said coldly, stepping away from Harry. “Go back to London. We can speak after the World Cup.”
Harry actually had no idea, but he felt a certain level of satisfaction at knowing something Malfoy didn’t so he decided to play it up a bit. “Yeah, it’s a Muggle thing. You wouldn’t know it.”
“Good luck,” he managed after a pause.
Harry couldn’t help himself: he snorted with laughter. He could hear the crowd chattering behind them and knew they were listening. It felt right, like riding his favourite broom.
Harry winced. “I’ve talked to her in the sense that I’ve played against her and last week some of her mail accidentally got delivered to Grimmauld Place and I forwarded it to her.”
“Don’t bring Ginny into this,” he snapped back.
Somehow they managed to keep their hands off each other in the lobby and the elevator, but once they reached Harry’s floor all bets were off.
“I didn’t say we couldn’t talk.” Harry’s heart was beating very fast.
Harry shook his head. The truth was that ever since his injury, his breakup with Ginny and the media frenzy following both, he hated going out. Even walking down Diagon Alley made him feel raw and overexposed like he wasn’t wearing any clothes.
Harry gaped. “You can’t be serious.”
If they hadn’t been before, they certainly would be now, Harry thought miserably as he took in the
The cover showed him standing, holding a broom, with his hair blowing back in the fake wind. Harry remembered that the photographer had asked him to make his ‘heroic’ face; apparently, the closest he’d been able to manage in that moment was ‘constipated’.
Malfoy snorted. “It’s alright, Potter. I’m sure Applebee would give you a go if you asked her nicely.”
“Really?” She asked, eye wide.
Benjy Williams stood just to their left, wand aloft. A breeze blew across the grounds and the sun shone down on all they had built, and Draco’s heart felt a little like it was going to explode. Williams lowered his wand with a sharp flick.
Draco was everywhere, long legs wrapped around Harry, hands in his hair and on his waist and the back of his thighs, pulling him in deeper than Harry thought possible.
Harry instantly reached through the bars and grabbed his hand. It was damp and frigid like ice. He squeezed his shaking hand and stroked the outline of his bones. Doing anything he could to try and warm him up he clasped both of his hands around Draco’s but nothing seemed to work.
He stopped in his tracks as he saw Draco’s slender form limping towards him his legs struggling to support the weight of his body. A female guard was dragging him along and let out an annoyed huff as he stumbled and collapsed to the floor. She roughly yanked him back up by the arm and shoved him forwards which nearly knocked Draco over again.
“Harry! Please! Please! Help me! Help me! Harry!”
To call it a bite was nearly an insult to the amount of damage that had been inflicted.
But if he stayed he was sure whatever found Draco would find him too. Maybe, it was better that way. Maybe he deserved it. If he only would’ve listened to Draco none of this would’ve happened.
Harry dug his fingers into his scalp as he covered his ears and staggered away from the door. When the voice from outside received no response it cut off mid word and silence filled the air once more.
The entrance hall was empty and so was the kitchen.
His partners less than convinced drawl responded as they moved away slowly,” Mm... You’re sure you checked the whole shop?”
What was going on?
Oh, who was he joking? He’d never slipped up this badly before and now he was going to pay for it.
He went to push himself into a sitting position and let out a gasp of pain as he accidentally put pressure on his injured hand. He could also see now that there was a decent amount of dried blood on the blankets but his bandage was mainly untarnished.
“I’m going to help you get into bed, okay?” He carefully wrapped his arms around Draco and lifted him to his feet. Supporting most of his weight he helped him towards his bed and gently lowered him into it.
He knew he wouldn’t be able to stay here long as they would immediately know he did it but he needed to warm Draco up. It didn’t feel fair to drag Draco away to some hidden location when he didn’t even know what was going on.
Sighing, he set his book down and got up to go find him.
“They just took my Auror license, okay? I’m fine. Please, don’t worry about me.” Harry paused and tried to get Draco to look at him,” They... They’ve moved your trial to tomorrow, Draco.”
“Okay.” He whispered.
Draco had begged him to leave this place. Time and time again he’d said,” Harry, please. There’s something in the woods. Let’s just go. I can’t go outside without feeling like I’m being watched. I hear it at night. I feel it all around us. Please. Let’s go before it’s too late.”
He made his way towards the staff entrance and filed in line behind other guards. There was one wizard placed at the door to ensure no one who didn’t belong snuck in through the back. He dipped his head to the young wizard as he entered.
He grabbed his lantern and rushed to the front door. He had to see. He just had to.
He must be hearing things.
“My plant?” Draco was now sitting up, his eyes darting to the windowsill that had held his aloe vera. His poor plant was now sprawled across the floor, dirt spilling out of the pot,” Oh no.”
“Hey.” He mumbled back, completely forgetting about his earlier worries.
The next morning a part of him expected Draco to open the door and come home as if nothing had happened.
The only thing he could do was hide. But there was no where to hide. They were going to find him.
Harry nodded,” Did you not sleep?”
Dread gripped his heart and he went rigid. His mouth opened and closed before he gasped out,” I’m sorry.”
His hand was sloppily bandaged and blood had already seeped through the meager wrappings.
When he opened his eyes he could feel fingers running through his hair and saw the blurry outline of Draco sitting on a chair next to the bed. He reached over, fishing for his glasses and grunted a thanks as they were pressed against his un-bitten hand. Once he slid them back onto the bridge of his nose Draco came back into focus.
Harry gently kissed his forehead before he pulled away and whispered,” Just sleep now. It’ll all make sense in the morning.”
Once he was certain everyone had cleared out and the shops were closed for the night he crept up to a closed window. Pulling his wand out of his robes he pointed it at the latch and whispered,” Alohomora.”
Malfoy snorted. “That’s the most Gryffindor thing I’ve ever heard. It’s not dishonest if it’s what they want or at least what they expect. That’s the way fame works. You’re doing the same thing, you’re just trying to be the character all the time. That can’t possibly be sustainable.”
He watched as Malfoy swooped over the crowd and winked - winked! - at a woman waving a black Montrose Magpies flag, and rolled his eyes.
“Harry, Harry, Harry…”
Ron nodded. “That’s cool. I’m happy for you, mate.” He wrinkled his nose. “But do you have to work it out with the ferret?”
“There are some unbelievably illegal books in here,” Draco said gleefully over his shoulder, reaching up to pluck out a small leather-bound volume.
She shot him a smile. “That’s good.”
“Oh, god.” Harry put his face in his hands. “I’m sorry you had to see that.”
Harry stared at the number for a long moment before stuffing it into his pocket. He wasn’t going to use it - he certainly wasn’t going to buy a mobile phone just so he could call Draco Malfoy - but he couldn’t quite bring himself to throw it away either.
Harry took another step forward, intending to be threatening, and found himself very annoyingly looking up at Malfoy, and far too close to him. It was too late to step back now - that would be admitting defeat. “What would you know about sportsmanship?”
The next morning Harry poked his head into Draco’s room to find him pulling on his shoes and a coat, looking significantly healthier than he had the day before.
“I have a question for you,” Malfoy panted, reaching for Harry’s leaking, unbearably hard dick.
The bar was nicer than the ones they’d been to in Brisbane and Sydney, with warm moody lighting, velvet booths, and none of the urine smell the other bars had.
“Look, if we just blend it here - no, Mrs Granger, don’t take that off!” Padma was red faced and flustered. Harry began to back out of the room, but before he could Ginny spied him and grabbed his arm with surprising strength.
The ceremony was short and sweet, and when they were done with their vows all of the wizards and witches raised their wands together, wrapping Ron and Hermione in beams of white light that bonded them as a married couple.
Harry choked on his beer, and coughed for a few moments before he was able to speak again. “Who? Malfoy?”
He refused to touch himself - that would turn this nightmare of an evening into something real, and he was holding onto reality by a pretty thin thread as it was.
He was so flustered that he virtually fled the shop the moment he had paid, clutching the bag to his chest.
“Did you build this?” he asked in amazement as they walked slowly around the perimeter, taking in the hoops and the stands.
He thought about when he told Draco he was less of a twat off the pitch, all that time ago. It had just been an offhand comment, but it was true: on the pitch Draco was ruthless, but he drew a clear line between that person and the thoughtful, funny person he was the rest of the time. There were crossovers, sure, but ever since they’d come back from Australia he’d made sure that Harry knew that the things that were said on the pitch or in the press were the character, not him. For the first time, Harry wondered if he'd ever reciprocated that.
“I don’t know for sure, but I know Krum’s dating someone and I can’t think of why else he’d be invited.” Harry shrugged, suddenly a bit unsure.
“No!” Harry pulled his arm away sharply, and almost fell backwards into the railing. Malfoy looked startled at his outburst. “I mean… Can I just sit down in your bathroom for a bit?”
His shirt ended up on top of a lamp in the corner and he was just starting to pull at Draco’s Quidditch robes when there was a noise from the Floo.
“No! Well, not no but… It’s complicated.” Harry glanced around quickly to make sure no one was listening.
Harry looked at him finally, trying to convey his anger but as soon as their eyes met he knew that he was done for. Malfoy’s grey eyes were teasing and warm and Harry felt his anger and resolve melt like snow on a hot day. Malfoy’s hands relaxed on his wrists and he intertwined their fingers instead.
Harry nodded, his confidence wavering slightly.
“Molly, love, it’s his wedding. Why don’t you let him decide if it needs another layer?”
He pulled his covers back up over his head miserably and groaned. Luckily Ron seemed to take his groan for nerves because he patted Harry’s foot awkwardly.
He hid out in the waiting room, flipping aimlessly through an ancient copy of Witch Weekly. He was reading an article about Celestina Warbeck’s tomato soup recipe when someone came and sat down next to him. He glanced up and was surprised to see Pansy.
“You want me to stop not complaining?” Harry asked.
Hermione beamed. “Thank you, Harry. That's so sweet of you to say.”
Harry wondered if he should be more embarrassed. He didn’t even know if Draco would be awake, let alone interested in seeing him, but he was tipsy and he wanted to see him.
Hermione looked unimpressed. “You’ll never work this out if you don’t talk.”
Malfoy scowled at him, “I didn’t…No, not as such.” He admitted through gritted teeth. Harry had to clear his throat again to hide the snort of laughter which bubbled up at that. “This isn’t a proper duel anyway, though I wouldn’t expect you to know since you’re practically an honorary Muggle.”
Sadly his maturity had its limits, which he reached when Malfoy began trying to argue that Harry had fudged the numbers on their race times.
Harry hovered above the game. Sometimes when he did this it was like he could see every moving part of the game, like he could predict what would happen next.
Harry tried to ignore him but it was tough when he was so close. “Why don’t you spend more energy on catching the Snitch and less on bothering me?”
He looked out at the water. The wind was ruffling it and distorting the reflections of the lights. It was strange - six months ago hearing Ginny say that would have sent him into a spiral but now he realised that he felt the same: he missed her but he had no desire to get back together.
The gathered crowd erupted into cheers. Draco squeezed Harry’s hand with all his might.
Malfoy was silent for what seemed like an age. “Yes,” he replied, slowly.
“Dizzy.” Draco scrunched his face up. “The potion makes me feel like I might float away at any moment.”
“Right. Whatever.” Malfoy straightened his robes, lips pursed. There was a bit of awkward silence between them as they stood a few metres apart, staring at each other in the soft torchlight.
Harry sat back down and mulled over the conversation. What Benjy said had lodged itself in Harry’s brain. Perhaps he was being a coward for not doing what he knew he wanted to do. Without overthinking what he was doing, Harry reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone.
“I appreciate your faith in my ability to win,” Harry laughed, choosing to ignore the last part.
“When I was a child. I hardly remember it though.” There was something like wonder in his voice and much to Harry’s irritation he stepped away and surveyed the kitchen. “You don’t keep it in very good condition, do you?”
“Oh, bugger off,” he grumbled, putting his wand away. “I’m just trying to get the creases out.”
She looked unsure but began typing on her computer. “Alright, sir, I’ve added the new room to your booking. Here’s your key.”
Finally, he got his chance. Malfoy was briefly distracted by O'Flaherty and so Harry moved, flying leisurely but intentionally towards the spot above the stands where the Snitch was currently hovering.
Draco made a frustrated noise. “That’s what you think the issue is? I wanted you to come out and tell the world about our relationship?”
“I...you can’t just leave!” Again Malfoy didn’t look very convinced at his own words, and Harry raised an eyebrow at him.
Harry almost choked on his own tongue. “An old Weasley jumper. Why?”
Something about Draco’s blank tone rubbed the wrong way at the raw place in Harry’s chest so he continued. “Also, I thought, I know you were upset when Hermione and Ron found out, I thought it’d be a good idea if we cooled things off a bit during the World Cup too, then we can see where we are afterwards.” Harry felt the words he had forgotten about all week spilling out of him.
“I can do it,” Harry said quickly and tried not to look too surprised at himself. Draco and the mediwitch  turned to him in astonishment.
Malfoy’s entire playing strategy seemed to be to get his opponent as pissed off as humanly possible. Harry was well aware of this now but it didn’t seem to make any difference - he still spent most of the game holding himself back from throwing a punch.
Malfoy’s eyes flicked across Harry’s face, and then he smirked slightly. “Or perhaps not. Perhaps the reason you’re moving out isn’t that you were disgusted, but because you’re jealous.” He was looking down at Harry now, voice low. He took another step forward and they were so close together now.  “Is that it? You wish you had your cock in some bloke's mouth?” He paused for a millisecond. “Or would you prefer to be the one on his knees?” His breath washed over Harry’s face, minty and warm.
“Don’t call her that. And no, probably not,” Harry returned but there wasn’t any venom in it.
Harry still didn’t really understand so he stayed silent, hoping Malfoy would continue.
“No.”
“That’s because that is the character he’s playing. You need to ask yourself who the character you are playing is.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Are we really playing mine's bigger than yours?”
Harry didn’t see the point in trying to patch up his hand. Maybe it would be better if he did just bleed out. But Draco had such a terrifying look on his face that Harry wasn’t about to tell him that.
From outside the open window Draco could hear Harry’s breathless explanation,” Shop keep must’ve left the window open.”
Harry sighed and slumped into the chair that Draco had been sitting in. He was quite tired,” Okay.”
“What happened to your plant?” Harry asked innocently.
Draco sighed heavily,” Just don’t do it again.”
Shit.
Once he’d built up enough courage he briefly glanced back at his hand. A large chunk of flesh had been ripped clean from his hand. It was hard to see through all of the blood but the distinct white of his metacarpals shone through just enough to be visible. And if he really focused he swore he saw the quiver of a vein as blood passed through it.
The shouting from outside increased in desperation and volume,” Harry! Leave! Leave! Come with meeee! Come with me! “
Couldn’t say everything was fine and then go into the back room and shove a gun into his mouth.
Right after the war it was announced that anyone wearing the Dark Mark would be taken into custody and given the Kiss. They’d hunted down anyone rumored to have been working for Voldemort. Soon having the Dark Mark wasn’t a necessary requirement. It only sealed you to a fate worse than death.
They couldn’t be taking him to trial already could they?
No. No.
He just needed to grab some food and get out before he was spotted. Heading towards the middle of the shop he started stuffing as many canned goods into his robes as he could. When he’d collected enough to last him for at least two weeks he started back towards the window.
Harry shook himself out of his stupor and instantly snapped back,” It’s clear!”
And a horrible realization hit him.
He had no choice but to tell him.
Now he knew why he recognized the voice. He was doomed. Harry had every reason to hate him. Every reason to drag him kicking and screaming to the dementors himself.
Draco seemed to shake himself out of his stupor and quickly rushed away, digging through a drawer in the bathroom. When he returned he had gauze and more bandages as well as hydrogen peroxide.
Sometimes a civilian would turn a blind eye if they don’t want to get involved. But an auror, an auror, meant a fate worse than death.
He dumped as much of the soil back into the plastic container as possible and then carefully buried the exposed roots. He’d been taking care of it for months. He really liked that plant.
The screaming voice from outside sounded strangely like a radio. It would clip and stutter as if feedback was interrupting it. And then suddenly it would sound crisp and clean. Sounding so much like Draco Harry had to remind himself it was impossible. There was no way. No way he was outside. Right?
Harry landed on his feet in the middle of his warm cottage. Draco slumped to the floor next to him his body trembling so hard it looked painful. The outline of his bones were visible poking against his skin which had a sickly yellow hue to it. His eyes were glossy and he was struggling to keep them open. His teeth were chattering insistently and his eyes had deep rings around them. Harry kneeled down next to him and slowly brushed his hand across his back. He accio’d a blanket from his bed and draped it around him. Draco was nearly invisible in the heavy comforter, only his head was poking out.
His vision blurred as realization of what was about to happen fully set in. He could feel his jaw trembling and bit down hard to steady it. Completely collapsing to his knees he knew there was nothing he could do or say.
Draco frowned at Harry,” of course I didn’t.”
Satisfied with his appearance he took a breath and apparated.
Harry shuttered and fell away from the window which was now freezing cold, his face burning from the contact.
Fully clad in auror robes with his mouth hanging open in shock.
Once Harry had left he hesitantly reached out and grasped the parchment. Slowly opening it he spread it out on the floor, running his fingers over the dried ink.
Maybe it would leave. If he just ignored it, maybe it would go away.
The plastic latch popped open and he slid the window open, climbing through it. It was a tight fit but he’d never weighed much and he frequently skipped meals. Dropping to the floor he kept low to the ground.
He also knew the man had no family. Meaning that there would be nobody to find him tied up in a closet. Once he located his house he went off to meet a very shady looking street peddler who sold him a vial of polyjuice potion for a very inflated price.
“Harry.. please.” He insisted.
His feet settled on wet rock and he peered up at the massive building that was Azkaban. The sea churned violently around him and he scurried away from the spray. It wouldn’t do any good to be soaking wet. Harry hid his real wand deep in his robes and placed Gregory’s wand in his sleeve.
Draco was on his feet in an instant,” I’ll do it. You should just sit down and wait on the couch.”
“I am taking this prisoner to trial. There was a miscommunication.” Harry repeated calmly.
Draco carefully placed it on the windowsill and pushed it as far back as it could go,” Yeah, maybe.”
Draco rolled onto his side and nuzzled his face into the pillow. He blinked up at Harry with round eyes and groggily whispered,” I.. I like this dream. I d-don’t wanna wake up, okay?”
“They sent me to take him.” He hastily explained,” That’s why I was asking where you were taking him. So if you don’t mind.”
Harry sighed heavily and played with Draco’s locks of blonde feeling him relax beneath his fingers,” Okay. You won’t wake up there. I promise.”
A second voice responded,” I’ll check it out.”
Damnit! How did he forget to shut it? How had he been so stupid?
Harry shook his head,” It doesn’t matter, Draco. We need to focus on you right now.”
Draco awoke to Harry gently caressing his face,” Hey, sleepyhead.” He said with a bright smile.
Besides, he couldn’t do that to him.
“I’m sorry.” He repeated, trying to hide his blood riddled hand behind him.
Harry sat on the bed next to him, feeling it dip beneath his weight,” You’re safe now. I got you out of there. This isn’t a dream.”
The woods had become more and more sinister to Harry and he stopped venturing in them. He could barely bring himself to step out of the cabin. He started feeling eyes peering into his back whenever he did.
Harry grunted,” yes, okay.”
For a long moment he just stood there unable to bring himself to move. But he had told Draco that he could see it so he had to.
