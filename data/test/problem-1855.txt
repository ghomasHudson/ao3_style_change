Draco’s cheeks burned slightly, letting him know that his blush had returned. Somewhere in between getting on the bed and the known reciprocation of feelings, his blush had gone away. But of course within a couple of seconds, it had returned - Harry had a way of doing that.
Potter’s gaze flicked to the clock on the wall across from him as Draco followed, his heart already beginning to stutter in his chest - he knew what that meant.
“Professor,” he said suddenly, making the rare gesture of eye contact with Lupin, who looked surprised at the sudden urgency in Harry’s voice.
“Why are you telling me all this?” Harry felt a strange feeling growing in his chest. He couldn’t identify this uncomfortable emotion, but it made him drop his voice to a whisper. “Why
Harry smirked, mockingly and teasingly - knowing that it made the other crazy in the best way possible.
Draco didn’t full trust his voice so he just nodded, sending a questioning gaze to the other as he hoped the other would understand.
The front of Draco’s jeans were embarrassingly damp, Harry only grinned as he gave one last squeeze before letting go - much to Malfoy’s dismay.
hey so from now on - just about - the updates may be a little slower as i need to actually finish writing it but i now have my motivation back for writing so it shouldn't take me too long. thank you so much for reading :)
“We didn’t have a full class then, Malfoy.” He made sure to glance at Harry. Either he was the best matchmaker in the world or it was his goal to embarrass him until he died. Draco groaned in response, the potion not being the main source of smell anymore. Now, he could smell it directly on Harry. Fuck, it was intoxicating.
Draco had just seen the outline of Potter’s cock through his jeans, his mouth dropped slightly. He looked fucking huge. And Draco despised how his mouth watered eagerly at the sight.
By the time he finally reached the door, he was out of breath and had a hand against the wall for stability. The other still covering his crotch with his books, not trusting anyone not to see him. His eyes had closed to purely focus on getting his breathing semi normal, counting his breaths inside his head.
“Harry, remember. I know with this potion you lose your very well kept control, but you know you have a hold on your magic. Remind yourself of that.”
He was also talking down all the sinful visuals and thoughts in his head, he did not need his prick to rise and ending up getting stuck in the zipper or some shit. Draco cringed at just imagining it, that managed to keep his filthy mind at bay for a little.
Harry’s eyes were a captivating mixture of a metallic blood red and the darkest pitch black he’d ever seen, he’d never seen eyes quite like them. He’d never seen Potter’s eyes like this, he couldn’t find a piece of himself that wanted to look away. A prickling warmth that spread through his entire, shaky body - ending in his groin. He so badly wanted to let the moan that was forcibly stuck in his throat out but he couldn’t bare to humiliate himself further.
“If I’m correct it was Rose Oil.” Draco answered confidently, he knew his potions. He just wished that he was the one that had brewed it now, maybe not though.
He wanted it down his throat, wanted Potter to fuck his face and throat so hard that he wouldn’t be able to speak for weeks. Draco’s face flushed even harder - if that were at all possible - at his own thoughts, embarrassed but way too turned on.
“You won’t be keeping those noises from me anymore, sweetheart. Now, do are you were told and look at me. Before I make you.”
Harry, not so subtly, looked the other up and down in an antagonizingly slow and purposeful manner. Shamelessly fucking the other with his eyes, Draco whimpered softly - his body not knowing how to act in this situation.
The blonde hated how he was affected by the other, he could feel his cock beginning to stir and he couldn’t find the determination to stop it. Hell, he hadn’t even been touched by Harry yet. His words and his eyes had got him so worked up, it was shameful. He was forced from his thoughts by the voice that made his body tingle.
Whimper's vibrated through Harry’s cock, causing his hips to jerk slightly; pushing himself further down the blonde’s throat. Draco, once again, choked. But what surprised Harry a little was the unexpected and almost aggressive moan that Draco let out, swallowing around him purposefully this time and using his tongue.
Harry let out a noise that resembled both a scoff and a chuckle, shaking his head as he burnt the other with his gaze.
He then forced his attention away in order to focus on not spilling the damn drink, he reached over and grabbed the glass. It was bitter against his fingers, a welcomed cold when compared to the heat of his body.
A pro and a con was that the potion gave the ability to be incredibly imaginative, any thoughts were turned into something crystal clear and visual. Like watching a movie but just made from horny thoughts, also distracting but Harry couldn’t help but let himself get sucked in.
Potter had grabbed the other’s shirt and began pulling him up from his knees, bringing him back on his feet. Draco’s knees buckled slightly from how long he’d been knelt on them, he recognised the dull ache and probable pain that he was going to feel the next day - he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
Harry was squeezing his hands into fists, trying to do anything to distract his mind from the downright sin that was flowing through it. He felt himself slowly starting to lose control, he could feel it.
“Guys! You asked for this fucking story so stop getting sidetracked and listen!” Ginny snapped, smacking the two of them on the top of the head. Not hard enough to really hurt but hard enough to get the message across.
Draco’s voice was scratchy and croaky, completely fucking wrecked. Harry revelled in the fact that he had been the one to cause it, it was incredibly pleasing to him. It was taking everything inside of him to not just fuck the boy up against the wall, purely from how wrecked his voice was - he quickly decided that what he had planned was infinitely better. Harry’s reaction was immediate.
Draco was obviously there, he had to be. He had also testified against his father, before he had been wracked full of nerves that had electrocuted every cell in his body. Fear had slipped its way up his legs, to his chest - steadily making its way up his body. He had already began to panic, it had soon reached his neck as it constricted tightly like a snake so that he couldn’t breathe.
The blonde’s heart pounded in his chest as he looked back into those obsidian eyes, shaking like a leaf. He had fucking seen.
After towelling himself dry, he stood bare arsed naked in front of his wardrobe - pondering what the fuck he was going to choose. He didn’t want it to seem like he was trying to look good but he did want to look good, Pansy would come in very handy at a time like this. She always knew what looked good on him, he was on his own this time.
“Okay, t-thanks.” He cursed himself in his head, if he was stuttering this bad in front of his friends who knew him better than anyone else, how was he gonna cope with Potter. The same Potter who could make him a complete and utter mess in under a minute, he was fucked.
After Harry made his way past him, an evil smirk appeared on his lips from how the other reacted. He hadn’t even meant for his cock to nudge Malfoy, but it satisfied him how utterly fucked the boy looked already. He hadn’t even begun.
It sounded like a fucking growl. Draco’s cock twitched in his jeans as he instantly felt a heat coming up behind him.
Fuck that, actually. He got off on the thought of teasing the other until he was in tears, filled up to the brim with sexual frustration. All until Harry couldn’t hold himself back anymore and give the boy so much pleasure that he’d probably pass out, that sounded good too.
“Fucking cunt! This fucking potion.” He still had an unnerving smirk playing on his lips as his gaze shifted over to Draco and his friends.
Harry then moved his left hand from his curvy hips to cup the boy’s erection, almost tight enough to be painful. Malfoy keened as his knees buckled after hearing the appreciative sound that came from his former enemy, he felt his grip get stronger.
Draco nodded frantically in response, the warm feeling of Harry’s hand helping to keep him out of his head.
He let his lips slip into a malicious grin, looking at his friends one last time before opening his mouth to speak.
Draco had to admit that he was a little more curvy than other guys his age, his arse much more filled out. More so than most girls, even. He had grown to love it, he was proud of how far he had come with his body confidence.
and pointing his wand inside. There, where there was usually a pile of folded clothes beside a pile of used, unorganized ones, was Dragon, sleeping quietly on top of one of Harry's shirts. In fact, it was the Weird Sisters one he wore to sleep when it was cold.
"What's wrong with me?" he yelled, pulling at his own hair and curling into himself on the couch until his forehead was resting on his knees. "That bastard."
He turned to Teddy— who looked at him with such pleasing eyes— and then to the snake— who, in turn, seemed to be glaring daggers at Harry with much hatred, which was ridiculous, since it was just a bloody snake— and decided to take the wounded animal inside. It took some work, as it was acting very defensively, although it moved in a way that let Harry know it was in a great deal of pain. The only thing the poor animal could do to defend himself, it seemed, was to hiss and bite at Harry's hand until he had small, bleeding wounds making his fingers slightly numb.
"Hey, buddy, slow down," he tried, to no vail, as the child kept pulling on his sleeve and dragging him through the tall grass. Molly had been bugging Ron to help Arthur with it for a while now, so maybe Harry should offer some help as well. With three wands it would be easier than with just one.
The next morning found Harry smiling at Teddy's preoccupied face through the fire place and reassuring him that yes, the snake was fine and that no, he hadn't yet asked its name or anything else important yet.
I had to beg the elves to wash my robes a shit ton of times, just to get the bloody smell off. My relationship with Ginny was just a way to forget him. It didn't work, though. Now she's dating our mutual friend Luna. I'm happy for her. But—"
He walked into the kitchen and, seeing Draco wear nothing but his underpants as he sorted their breakfast, Harry's heart jumped. As he remembered he was allowed, allowed to touch, allowed to kiss and bite and lick and love, he did just that. He wrapped his arms around that thin waist and lowered his mouth to that sinful neck, tasting the morning there.
"So, do you have a name or?" The snake mumbled something that he didn't get at first— but sounded an awful lot like a word he'd never let anyone say in front of his godson. However, when he asked if he could repeat it, louder, he received an open mouthed threat that displayed two sharp fangs. "Those are cool. Venomous?" He knew the answer, as his hand had neither fallen off nor turned black from the previous day's bites.
A low moan escaped Draco, who dropped his head and curved his back, his backside finding Harry's twitching erection.
He'd admitted his own feelings- it was just a crush, anyways- a long time ago. It ad reached an undeniable point when, after the trials, he'd kept, hidden inside a worn book, a picture of Draco's tired face blinking up in surprise as the sentence of his freedom had been passed. When he'd confessed such a thing to his friends, they'd been- instead of surprised- fucking relieved with his realization. He even ignored the whispered "finally" one of them had mumbled.
His bedroom was empty, as was the bathroom and living room. Still, Grimmauld place was fairly big and new rooms appeared when the house felt like it; and now that he'd freed Kreacher, it was harder to keep track of everything.
There is a clear moment of hesitation before he gets his answer, but once Dragon starts explaining, he doesn't seem to be able to stop. "You don't get it, Potter. I'm not who you think I am. Not all of us have nice people who'll come through during the worst of times. I couldn't escape any other way. Not from him. I had to do it. I just-"
A hand pushed him back, sliding up his chest and grabbing his chin roughly, forcing him to look Draco in the eyes.
Draco whispered a spell and cleaned his backside, then kissed the head of Harry's flaccid cock, rising up on the bed until his still hard one brushed Harry's cheek.
"Please, love, just—" he begged, tugging at his wrists, failing at moving his hips, hitting his head against the wall as his eyes rolled back into his head.
"So, Dragon," Harry tried, still thinking that name was absolutely bunkers for such a tiny and adorable creature. "What happened? Like, how d'you get hurt?"
The blond's eyes shot open and he rubbed the sleep away, glancing at the clock on Harry's nightstand and rushing to get up.
"There you go," he whispered, as he made his way to the kitchen and prepared their plates— his with Mrs Weasley's perfect, tasty food and Dragon's with the same thing, but raw. "Better?" he asked, as he tried to separate the snake from his neck.
He was not expecting, however, to stumble upon her living room and come face to face with a very much naked ass of the one and only Ron Weasley, with enough freckled and bite marks for Harry to realize what was happening, not to mention the pair of legs wrapped around his best friend.
Once he was through, a low voice rang in his ears, "Oh, goody, the house of a peasant. Couldn't you have at least tidied up a bit, Potter?"
That night, tired as he was, he and Dragon went to bed and, for the first time in far too long, Harry didn't have any nightmares disturb his sleep.
He turned to the snake, shocked. He still had some difficulty distinguishing between the times he spoke Parseltongue and English, but it always seemed strange to be able to communicate with them.
Harry ran up the stairs, wondering what the hell Draco Malfoy could need from his bedroom. At the door, just as he was about to step inside, his heart decided to do a loop inside his chest at the sight before him: for the second time that day, Draco Malfoy was laying on his bed, covered by only his summer sheets— which covered pretty much up to nothing— silver hair wild and sticking all over his face, especially where there was a visible pillow crease. His cheeks and nose were pink and he looked as if he'd just jumped out of one of Harry's sex dreams.
Soon, he was struggling to push his hips up with Draco's hands holding him still, moving his waist in so many, agonizingly slow waves that Harry swore he was writing each alphabet letter with his movements, just to test Harry's control. He could feel every brush of his cock against Draco's prostate from the way he clenched and threw his head back, or made a sound that came from deep within his chest— which Harry wanted to follow with his tongue and swallow down until neither of them could breathe.
"Wicked!" Ron exclaims, reaching out to touch the snake, only to be met by an attempt to bite his fingers off. "Hey!" he complains, stepping back, to Dragon's clear satisfaction.
"He— Malfoy— was my sort of enemy at school. People told me I was obsessed with him. I didn't understand what they meant until I started spending weeks following him around the halls and not sleeping or eating or playing Quidditch just so I could keep tabs on what he was doing. After this one time, in the bathroom, where I almost killed him— by accident, I mean— I just couldn't bear it anymore. And later, when we did a potions class on Amortentia and the whole room smelled like— like him, his hair, his cologne, just
The Gryffindors and Slytherins rallied around Draco’s petrified body, hoisting it into the air, “Well done, Draco!” Bellowed Goyle and more rowdy hoorays chorused out.
Clark made a horrified noise and everyone turned to look at him. “You can’t intend to just leave her in there,” he exclaimed.
Thanks to everyone for their patience! I hope a nice long chapter helps make up for the long wait. Double thanks to everyone who stopped by, and triple thanks for your amazing comments. I literally cannot properly quantify how encouraging I find them, but please believe that it is a whole lot.
Harry laughed and sprung again, braving it across the centre line, only to be tagged by Michael Corner and frozen in place himself.
“A break would be a great help, yeah,” Harry admitted. “I’m thinking I might have to look for more work, and the bills are stacking up simply because I’ve not addressed them. A few days to myself would be a gift, Molly, truly.” He felt another raucous smack of guilt. He wanted to take care of things, yes, but he also wanted time to see Malfoy. Harry felt his wedding ring suddenly heavy on his finger. He’d not even thought to take it off. He’d been trying to convince himself that the separation was only temporary, at least until he’d seen his account statement at Gringotts. Now, he didn’t know what was the best path. He wanted Ginny to be in their children’s life, of course he did, but whether she’d still have a place in his, well, he no longer could say with any certainty.
“Believe me,” said the healer, catching his glance, “It would be much more cruel to make you try to swallow something other than water right now.”
The professor’s voice was scratchy as ever, and the students silent, focused. Harry felt the pressure of Draco’s thigh and bicep against his. He was sitting too close for plausible deniability. And Harry didn’t care. He was tired of caring. He wanted Draco close, wanted the solid, reassuring physicality of him. He wanted to take Draco’s hand in his, or wrap and arm around him like other couples could, fuck the onlookers, fuck the consequences.
“Is he alright?” Clark insisted, springing forward. Harry flinched at the sudden movement. Clark was talking. No, Clark was dead. Dying? Harry blinked rapidly, smoke burning his eyes, hope and anguish clashing in the small vessels of his scorched lungs.
“Y-Yeah, I’ve never been like that before.” Draco hated the way he stuttered but he could not give a shit anymore, he was just trying to talk his boner down from his mind so that when he stood up and made his escape - nobody would be able to see. He doubted his ability in doing so though, he was just trying to think of how he could escape.
“This is gonna be so fun to listen too.” Draco and his friends were already thoroughly amused, eager to hear more.
Draco looked down for a moment, a small smile on his lips. Harry noticed and couldn’t help but smile too, even when he was literally stroking his dick. It filled him with glee that he had just made the other smile like that, made him feel good. He would be making him feel good every second from this day on, both sexually and emotionally.
Harry just stood there for a second, showing and revelling in the blatant power that he held. Draco looked down to observe the other, eyes widening as he gulped unintentionally. Looking down was a mistake.
“N-No.” Draco’s voice was slightly raspy, absolutely nowhere near the level that Harry’s was, no. There was something about the other’s voice that made his body tense up in pure fear as pleasure constricted around him like a snake of arousal, it made his thighs tingle at his power.
Her annoyed expression soon turned into a smirk, her brother’s not even bothering to argue back as she was right - they really wanted to know. Hermione nodded her head in a silent ‘thank you.”
Draco couldn’t breathe, the boxers did nothing to hide Potter’s size. He was utterly puzzled at how that was supposed to fit inside his mouth, he always did enjoy a challenge though.
He was surprised that spit had managed to escape his mouth, from the lack of room inside. His lips suction cupped around the other’s cock so tightly that he couldn’t believe how it had leaked out and everything had gotten so covered.
“That was interesting.” Professor Snape finally let the grin show on his face, momentarily shocking the students that their teacher was almost smiling - in a way. Hermione was squirming in her seat, wanting to go check on her friend.
“This is Harry speaking, your mother is standing right next to you. I’m holding you and you’re holding me, I’m keeping you grounded.” Harry explained, his voice still soft but loud enough so Draco could focus on it.
“The thing you aren’t allowed to be bitchy about, sexualities.” Blaise spoke in a joke tone but his words were very serious, he knew it wouldn’t be a problem as Hogwarts had an exceptionally varied amount of sexualities - he still wanted it said aloud though.
Even with the lust potion, Harry had seemed to still have amazing control and here he was not being able to think because of how horny he was. The temptation he was feeling was unruly, he could just get rid of the hard on in his boxers and then be able to focus again.
“That gorgeous blush of embarrassment on your cheeks yet you get off on me talking to you like this, don’t you.” His words were not a question, they were a statement. And by the whine that fell so graciously out of Draco’s spit slicked lips, he knew he was right.
Potter’s gravelly voice had been so unexpected that Draco jumped, whipping his head round to find the other staring down at him - those pitch black eyes making his cock twitch. Neville, speaking again, interrupted the overbearing tension
Before that could happen, his focus was off Harry and his ears picked up noises a little away from behind the door. Draco looked up towards the clock, it was 10:30pm - curfew. That meant everyone in the Gryffindor house were now coming up to bed, no idea that their friend had Draco in the room so close to them.
The way Malfoy was reacting to his dark gaze had him questioning whether it was really all that shocking to think that he wanted him back. Regardless, he loved teasing him.
Harry knew for a fact that all he was looking at was his shirt, but he also knew that his strong gaze was affecting Draco in all the right ways. He could see the way his body shook slightly, the harsh grip of his lip between his teeth. Harry relished in it.
“Yeah, I guess.” Ron refused to acknowledge the blush that had made its way on to his cheeks once more and just shrugged his shoulders, attempting to be nonchalant.
“This is so fucking frustrating!” His voice came out louder than he expected it too, his heart hammering harshly against his chest.
“So Goyle added four instead of one. For a love potion, you only need one. But for a lust potion, you need six drops. The lust ingredient has clearly taken over the entire potion, it isn’t a love potion now. Definitely just lust. It shouldn’t last 24 hours, I’m unsure of the correct time though.”
“Four drops, I think.” Draco and Pansy didn’t respond right away. Instead, deciding to look at each other and somehow hope that their brainwaves would connect and figure out the answer.
Potter’s own eyes were flickering from his hand on his neck, back to reciprocating eye contact. That teasing smirk on his features growing wider, the Slytherin couldn’t decide whether he loved or hated how nothing ever got past the other’s scrutinising eyes.
Potter was exploring the other’s mouth with his tongue, Draco had submitted into the kiss immediately; not even bothering to try and challenge Harry from dominating it. The Slytherin wanted it this way anyway.
Harry would absolutely not be turning down the offering of fucking Malfoy’s throat in a way he’s fantasised about for years but he also wanted to make sure the other was comfortable with it. He felt the blonde swallow around him, nodding once again.
“Storage closet?” Harry beat him to it, surprising himself at how calm his voice was despite his nerves.
What Potter was offering had his mouth watering, he wanted everything that the other had to give. He almost got lost in his head at the pure visuals of what was to come if he agreed, pain and pleasure. His hard on had began to throb in time with his heartbeat, shocks of want made their way up his body.
Harry felt sweat start to collect at his nape, using all his self-restraint not to fuck Draco’s mouth until his head bashed against the wall. He wanted to do this gradually, which was hard to do with the way the other was constantly whining around him - sending vibrations of pleasure shooting up into Harry’s body.
Potter was taunting him. Not in the usual way that he was used to though, this was incredibly different. This time, Potter was sexually taunting him. Draco whimpered, he tried to ignore just how many times - in the short time he’d been in the same room as the other - he’d whimpered. It’s not like he could help it though, he had lost control of his noises ever since they had locked eyes in the Great Hall.
“‘Mione! They can probably hear you!” He stopped for a moment, before a horrified look grazed his features.
Draco shook under the other’s eyes as he felt blood rush to his lower half and straight to his prick, at this rate he would be hard in no time. His thoughts were beginning to get jumbled, starting to no longer care that this was Harry Potter, fucking golden boy.
“-I understand why you’d miss out the part where you needed a bloody love potion to tell the girl.” Fred then finished, sending a sharp grin to his brother. The two revelled in the groan of annoyance and eye roll that their younger brother did.
Draco gulped audibly, feeling like the breath had been stolen from his lungs - Harry chuckled deeply.
As they sat at the Slytherin table, their eyes wandered to the Gryffindor’s. Both Hermione and Ron sat together, away from the others. Preferring to be in their own little bubble, rather than mingled with a crowd.
He practically bolted out of the Great Hall, walking as fast as he could without it being considered running. His race to the Slytherin dorms had never been so urgent before, his only goal was to get there without being stopped
He’d seen them drowned in blood, when Potter was really mad, furious. How his eyes changed from a slightly murky, sometimes emerald green to a deep, rustic colour that reminded him of the blood pumping through his very veins. It had shaken him to his core, and he had liked it.
It started with his face, he guessed that Potter had already taken notice of the grey colour his eyes were from the intense eye contact that they had shared before.
Harry frowned at the mention of Lucius, whilst Draco dumbed it down, Harry knew how awful a father he was and blamed him for a lot of what went down between him and Draco.
Ron reluctantly turned the handle, walking through as Harry followed. The class didn’t immediately look up, way too immersed with what they were brewing in their cauldrons.
As he collapsed again, the last thing he heard was, "Vernon! Call an ambulance, that's twice now he's-!" before everything went black.
Bellatrix swore under her breath and begrudgingly continued after her, pulling the hood of her robes closer as the rain poured down. “Couldn’t have waited for the rain to stop, though, could you?” she mumbled sarcastically. Narcissa ignored her as they approached the desired destination.
He was sweating terribly in the lingering heat of the day. He knew he would be much more comfortable without the long-sleeved shirt on, but he would not dare to risk showing anyone the cuts and the scars. When he had begun this terrible habit, sometime in the days after he returned to the Dursley’s and smuggled a kitchen knife up to his pitiful excuse for a bedroom, it hadn’t occurred to him to cut in a less conspicuous place. All he had been focused on at the moment was how very
“I’m sure Harry would enjoy a bit of a pick me up,” said a voice. Ron and Hermione looked towards the doorway to see Remus Lupin standing there. “Don’t mind me, I’ve just arrived.” He walked into the room, standing across from them. He looked quite fatigued, and a tad disheveled, as always.
Mrs. Weasley tutted at the antics of her children, and turned back to Harry. “Harry, would you like to get settled up with Fred and George? You’ll be staying in their room while you're here- I tried to clean up a bit, but those two are an absolute mess!” she shot the twins a disapproving look, and they shrugged.
His aunt then did something very unexpected. She flung herself forward and wrapped her bony arms around Harry, crying into his shoulder. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. You were just a baby, and then the
Narcissa wrung her hands together anxiously and took a deep breath. She hesitantly made her way to the chair across from Snape, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear as she sat. They sat in silence for a moment.
The older man before him sat on an old rickety chair by the window, the one Harry had himself been enjoying in his pseudo-solitude. They sat in silence for a moment.
At the mention of the Order, Harry felt a deep pang in his chest. It reminded him of Sirius. He took a deep shuddering breath and clenched his fists, then unclenched them.
Hedwig hooted rather pitifully from her spot in the cage on his bureau. “I know.” he mumbled. He turned over and pulled his blankets over his head. His mind was unsure of how to process everything that just happened. Should he be grateful? Relieved, even? He had hoped, for years and years that one day the Dursleys would treat him differently, more like a son, and yet now that it was happening, he didn’t know how to feel.
Harry shot Ron a grateful look and Ron nodded. “Goodnight, everyone.” He headed upstairs to the twins’ room, gently closing the door behind him.
In a futile attempt to displace this thought, he thought about Ron and Hermione, wherever they were. He missed them terribly, and his loneliness was emphasized by the fact that they hadn't written to him all summer. He didn't know quite what to feel about this. Part of him wanted to be alone, and he didn’t want any sympathy from them, because none of them had lost what he lost. The other part of him was anxiously awaiting some news from them, because he desperately wanted to tell them how a certain someone’s absence was tearing a hole through his chest, how he desperately wanted to join that someone in peace, and how he was afraid. Harry was afraid of what would happen to them because they loved him.
He saw his uncle and aunt had gotten him a private room. "Wuzzgoinon?" he mumbled. His mouth was bone dry, he noticed, yawning. She smiled and handed him a glass of water, which he accepted gratefully.
He heard the faint clacking of his aunt’s heels make their way down the hallway to his room. She knocked quietly from the other side of his door.
Vernon looked rather flabbergasted at all this. “What do you mean? One of your lot has been killing people? Running around, destroying suspension bridges and whatnot? I won’t stand for this- I-"
Dumbledore sighed and clasped his hands together. “I’ll be completely honest with you, Harry. The magical protections afforded to this location… as your health declines, so does the strength therein. I’m afraid it is no longer safe for you to remain here. The Burrow, however, has quite the protections necessary, and you will be, of course, protected by members of the Order.”
These words did little to reassure Harry, as he suddenly had a horrible sinking feeling in his gut that this year at Hogwarts was going to be very, very rough. But he wasn’t about to let that feeling hurt anyone else- least of all this kind doctor. “Thank you sir.”
Dumbledore glanced down at the boy whose weight he almost fully supported. As old as he was, it did not cause him a problem as it appeared as though Harry had lost a massive amount of weight; a strong breeze could have blown him over. He had deep, dark circles under his eyes, his skin was noticeably paler than usual, and his messy black hair stuck to his forehead from the beads of sweat on it. Apparition would not serve Harry well, but it was the fastest and safest way to transport him to the Burrow.
for Merlin’s sake!” And she dissolved into heavy tears now, the ugly kind of crying with gasps and snot. Ron didn’t know quite what to do, so he wrapped his arms around her hesitantly, relaxing as she turned into his chest, clutching the front of his shirt. He even felt a bit of wetness around his eyes, but he blinked them back. He would be strong for her.
“Now,” began the doctor, before Harry could even get a word in otherwise, “why don’t you tell me what this is all about.” He gestured towards Harry’s arm, and Harry looked down, surprised to see a lack of markings. With a wave of his hand, the doctor removed the concealing magic to reveal the scars and angry red lines once more.
“Come. It will be fun, help you to take your mind off this.” the professor made his way to exit the room when Harry stopped him.
As he approached the door, a horrible wave of dizziness suddenly swept over him and he staggered into the perfectly trimmed hedge. It continued to sweep until he keeled over, quite unconscious.
Next chapter will FINALLY have what you all came for... some sweet, sweet Draco Malfoy!! I hope you enjoyed this chapter, and please leave a  comment if you'd like. One comment = one drop of serotonin for this tired author.
“I see. Well, you might want to reach into your social battery reserves, because I believe you have cake waiting for you downstairs,” he said, standing up again.
“That is... likely, sir, yes. Nothing we tried magically has worked. His illness is completely resistant to all magical interventions. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
I beg you. When the time comes, you must carry out the deed the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform. Please protect him. Despite your harsh tongue, in your heart, you know I am right! Don’t let him become another casualty in these stupid wars!”
“I’ll be right down, Professor- I’ve just got to put on some clothes!” he called down, his voice slightly hoarse from having just woken up.
“So you’re taking him away, then?” she asked, and Harry could have sworn she appeared upset by this, but that would be crazy. Surely they should be overjoyed that he was leaving? That he would no longer be a strain and a burden upon their painfully boring lives, consuming their resources, pissing them off with his mere existence?
"You fainted. Your aunt told us that it wasn't the first time, and also, we couldn’t for the life of us wake you up, so we ran a blood test as soon as it was clear you’d be alright." she said.
Even though his lips were pursed as though he’d like to object, Dr. Payne nodded. “If that is what you wish.” As if sensing that pushing Harry any more might upset him, the doctor refrained from asking any further questions about the cuts. Harry did, however, have some questions for the doctor.
Not really fancying the idea of finding out what that meant, Harry just shrugged. “I mean… I’m just going through a lot right now, sir, and this is what helps. So, I’d much appreciate it if you could, y’know, not tell my aunt and uncle.”
“So what you’re telling me,Thomas, is that Harry might not live to see his seventh year at Hogwarts?”
Harry thought for a minute, and decided that Lupin was right. He sighed and stood up, running a hand through his unruly mess of hair.
Ron’s ears turned red. “Uh, yeah, of course. But what I’m saying is, we should throw him a surprise party!”
“What would you have me do? Hide him away?” Snape demanded. “The Dark Lord has powers I know not, you know not, and Draco definitely knows not. Draco’s best bet is to attempt the task. Dumbledore is weakened- surely the boy can get creative. Slip him some poison, curse an object and gift it to him, whatever he can come up with I’m sure he will succeed.”
Tears welled up in her eyes and she dropped to her knees at the foot of his black robes, clutching them desperately. “Severus,
Harry was not entirely unconscious. He could hear everything going on around him, though sometimes the sounds drifted in and out of his awareness like waves on the beach. He could hear the sirens, his aunt crying-CRYING!-and the feeble attempts of his uncle to wake him. Uncle Vernon was probably more purple than a ripened grape, Harry thought, even though he couldn’t see anything. He couldn't move either; everything felt heavy, especially his eyelids. He distantly felt himself lifted onto a stretcher, carried out the door, and into the back of an ambulance. He definitely felt it when someone inserted a needle into his arm and he would have winced, if he could. It wasn't enough to break him of his stupor, but it was painful nonetheless.
“Cissy- please don’t do this-” hissed Bellatrix, hot on her sister’s tail. “If the Dark Lord had any knowledge of this-”
“But why?” Harry blurted out. “Why now? It’s only the end of July, school doesn’t begin for another month.”
On the dreaded day, Harry was greeted by his old Defense Against the Dark Arts professor around lunchtime instead of the usual Mrs. Weasley.
The doctor, sensing Harry’s uneasiness, placed a hand gently on his shoulder. “No need to worry, lad, you’re probably just severely dehydrated. I just took those tests as a precaution, in case of any- erm, possible complications.”
It had been literal years since he had last had any contact with Muggle medical practices; the time Piers Polkiss and Dudley gave him a particularly nasty blow to the face came to his mind. Petunia had grudgingly taken a pleading (and bleeding) Harry to the ER for twelve stitches, all the while refusing to believe her precious Duddykins had so much as harmed a hair on Harry’s messy head. “He’s awfully clumsy, fell down the stairs,” she had explained to a skeptical staff. He had gone to bed without supper for many nights after that incident- which was even worse than when he had unwittingly, in a moment of emotionally-fueled underage magic, turned his teacher’s wig blue.
His whole body ached, and he assumed it was from lack of sleep and sitting on a brick wall for several hours, the same wall where he had first seen Sirius and when the Knight Bus had almost run him over a few years prior. He had attributed his lack of physical well-being (which had even been deteriorating as of late) to his own private pity party, never once thinking more of it. His own ignorance would be his downfall, yet again.
She drew back, surprised- albeit, annoyed- by his exclamation. In a rare show of concern, she asked, "Are you alright? How long have you been there?" Harry blinked as he took in his surroundings, sitting up and straightening his glasses. His hands were trembling slightly, something that Petunia’s hawk like eyes made sure did not go unnoticed.
Harry responded by hanging his head in shame. Lupin pursed his lips and put his hand on Harry’s shoulder comfortingly.
It suddenly occurred to Harry that none of the folks at the Burrow knew he had his illness. This sent a wave of panic through him. Should he keep it a secret?
Harry pushed her off him roughly. His blood was rushing through his ears, and he recognized this emotion as a deep wound running through his heart, the kind of wound that he didn’t think could be repaired in a single, heartfelt crying session. He swallowed thickly. “Look- I’m having a terrible time, and… Thank you for telling me about my mum, but I really think I need to be alone right now?” He ended the sentence as a question upon seeing her face turn bitter.
"Ugh." he moaned, flopping down on his pillows, and immediately regretted this action, as it sent his vision into a whirlpool of color. He felt nauseous. A little red button was on the wall and he could distinctly make out the words CALL NURSE below it. He reached out with his other, non-impaled arm, struggling to push it. A few minutes later, a rather plump nurse bustled in, beaming at him, and, upon seeing him straining to reach them, handed him his glasses.
“Hey Hermione.” He looked up as she pulled away. “Hello Ron, Ginny.” She blushed when he said her name, but he did not notice. “Fred, George. Mrs. Weasley. Um, I don’t mean to be rude, but how, exactly, did I end up on your couch?”
“It’s alright, don’t worry about it,” he replied, the idea taking root. He looked thoughtful for a moment, which Hermione noticed.
With a loud POP, Petunia watched from the windows as her nephew vanished almost into thin air. She knew in her heart that she would most likely never see him again, and this upset her so greatly that she went and locked herself in his magically empty room for the entire day.
The doctor shrugged helplessly. “Your guess is as good as mine, lad. I’ve been working here in secret for almost twenty years now, which leads me to answer your next question. I’m the only wizard in a Muggle hospital this side of the country. It’s supposed to be forbidden-we’ve got our own hospitals, and they’ve got their ways of handling their illnesses and whatnot. But before you defeated the Dark Lord as a wee babe, he used to love spreading magical illnesses in the Muggle populations to torture them. It was my job to make sure those illnesses didn’t spread, and to keep the knowledge of magic a secret from the infected. I just never left, I suppose.”
“It was your mother.” she interrupted, not unkindly. It was the first time he had heard her refer to his mother without a trace of jealousy or malice. He remained silent.
plagues the Dark Lord. He has been struggling with his physical body. His magic is as strong as ever, but- he coughs blood, Severus. He does not move from his chair for days at a time, he barely eats. He-”
Narcissa clenched her fist. “The Dark Lord is weakened as well,” she said quietly. The air in the room suddenly became so thick she could barely breathe.
Upon taking a closer look at Harry’s face, Mrs. Weasley noticed how gaunt he looked. She very much wanted to try and fatten him up a bit, as he was
In Snape’s heart of hearts, he did indeed feel the smallest pang of pity as he looked down at the sobbing woman at his feet. His mind flashed to that night, all those years ago, where Voldemort had rendered him to this state himself, clutching Lily’s lifeless form to his chest. He shook the memory out of his head. He would not let that happen to Draco.
Many miles away, on that same exact day, Narcissa Malfoy and Bellatrix LeStrange ran in secret to the house of Severus Snape. It was a miserable day; humid as all hell, the rain pounding down at the earth as if it was trying to break the ground.
The rest of them stood around in silence for a moment, before Mrs. Weasley coughed. “Come now, dinner’s ready. Help me set the table, would you, Ginny?” Ginny nodded, and her, Fred, and George headed into the dining room; Ron and Hermione stayed behind.
than strange in the week since his diagnosis. He was too puzzled with the absurdness of his aunt’s sudden interest in his wellbeing and general health that he failed to be grateful for the sudden change; years of mistreatment had wrenched all hope out of him that the Dursleys would ever treat him with an ounce of humanity.
this, but your friends have concocted a very special surprise party for you in the backyard. I would understand if you’d prefer not to join us, but I think moping about in Fred and George’s room won’t do you much good,” he said.
He held her like that for several minutes, until she calmed down a bit. An idea formed in his head as she backed off of him, sniffling and wiping her face. She laughed a little, looking at the tears on his shirt.
There was a moment of silence where the nurse coughed uncomfortably and excused herself, citing that she was needed elsewhere. The doctor and Harry sat in a tense silence for another moment before the older man sighed, and ran a hand through his receding hairline. He pulled up a chair, and sat on it so he was close enough to Harry that he could smell the tuna on his breath from lunchtime. Harry saw the name tag embroidered in neat black script on his lab coat. THOMAS L. PAYNE, MD. They sat in silence for a moment. Harry played with the fringes of his blankets, not looking up.
“Harry,” said Dr. Payne in a soft voice, “As a medical professional, I can assure you that anything you say in this room will be considered confidential. Unless you report abuse-” Harry snorted- “in which case I’ll have to alert child services, or if you have any plans to harm yourself.”
Snape feigned his disinterest, but inside his curiosity churned. “Oh?” He finally looked at her, his face unreadable.
He scoffed. This ought to be pleasant. He waved his hands and the barrier dropped; the gates creaked open, and the two hooded women hurried up the steps to come inside. He watched distastefully as they dripped all over his carpets; a moment later, both were as dry as if they never stepped foot outside. He turned back to his book.
He let his jaw go slack, knowing he’d need too. Harry pushed his hips forward slowly, pushing his head into that pretty mouth.
He watched as Harry’s almost obsidian coloured eyes wretched themselves from reciprocating the eye contact to then glide down.
A stinging sensation across his right cheek was what brought him out of it, his head snapping to the left from the pure force.
He sent them a warm smile and felt his heart swell happily when they reciprocated the smile, all before they went back to whatever the fuck they were doing before.
“Don’t want flies going in there, do we?” Her voice was teasing and Draco felt heat rush to his cheeks, that was even more embarrassing. The sound of Neville’s voice brought all their attention back to the Gryffindor’s.
Draco’s lips could barely stretch to the girth of Potter’s cock, incredibly overwhelming yet everything he needed and craved. He swirled his tongue around best he could, realising that he almost couldn’t move it; his mouth already so full. His lips stretched to their absolute, maximum limit and Draco fucking loved it.
“Hm. I dunno really.” The blonde wanted to slap the back of his head again as he rolled his eyes, he managed to catch Pansy’s attention; she was slightly below Draco in potions so he knew that she could help.
Draco whimpered, feeling how hard he was just because of him. He eyes also widened at just how big Potter was, he knew he was big from looking before but he felt even larger against his hand.
Draco’s heart dropped at the words. At this rate he’d be hard again in no time, Potter really did have a dirty mouth - the Slytherin loved it. He was a little confused by the end of the other’s sentence but quickly caught on from Harry’s next word.
The hands gripping his hips were gone as Harry flicked his eyebrows at him, daring him to not do what he’d been told. Draco had no means of that though, he just didn’t believe that he’d be able to walk.
“Hey, I wasn’t any better. I could’ve put a stop to it.” Harry placed a comforting hand on the other’s shoulder, he smiled.
It was all fun and games until one night, Draco had done something. Either bent over or sat down, he had felt the fabric rip. He thought he had ripped the whole of the jeans at first, that was until he was asked to turn round by Pansy.
Potter’s voice was dangerous and Draco just about sobbed, his whole body trembling as the other began walking towards the bed. He had broken the eye contact as soon as Harry had started making his way over, not having the strength or willpower to force himself to do it.
“Why don’t you go deal with it?” Ginny looked up at him curiously as she absentmindedly rubbed the back of her neck, it should’ve been weird with how nonchalant the group were about it but somehow it was just a “normal” thing.
Narcissa didn’t realize how tense she was until he said that, and relaxed somewhat. “Ah. Of course not. Forgive me. But, you must understand,” and now her voice dropped to but a whisper, and she leaned forward so he could hear, “I do not have faith in the Dark Lord’s power anymore. The Potter boy single handedly fought him off many times, and he still lives! A boy! Severus, why do we follow such a-”
“Oh, I’ve been absolutely horrible, haven’t I?” she cried, wiping her face with her apron. She looked at Harry, mascara running down her thin face. “I was so horrible to her too… I bullied her, ignored her, and eventually, I cut her out, when all she had ever done was be perfectly sweet to me. It wasn’t her fault she was sick, or magical.” Petunia blew her nose loudly.
"Oh -Harry- your blood test results came in!" she wailed, plonking down into the chair by his bedside and crying some more. The doctor came back in with Uncle Vernon and Dudley, who were both pointedly not looking at him.
"Good afternoon Mr. Potter! Alright there?" she said; her voice was much too cheerful for even Harry’s tastes.
“Right.” was all she said, standing up to wipe her face. She sniffled and made her way out of Harry’s bedroom. Her hand, trembling as it was, hesitated at the knob. Harry couldn’t see her face, but he saw her other hand clench into a fist, and she finally opened the door and shut it so quietly behind her that he could have sworn it didn’t make a noise at all.
"You fell on it, and almost dislocated it to boot." said a different voice. Harry turned to see a doctor walking into the room holding a clipboard."Good afternoon, Harry. How are you feeling?" he asked politely.
too skinny, but bit her lip, seeing how dead his eyes were. “Alright, then…” she shook off the somber mood the room had suddenly taken, smiling again. “Rest well, Harry. We’ll see you in the morning.”
Ron pointed to the calendar hanging on the wall. “Today’s July 28th. Harry’s birthday is in three more days.” he said.
Harry awoke to the door knob dinging happily away, and was quite annoyed by this. He rolled over in bed and put his head under his pillow to try and block out the sound of his uncle’s angry footsteps stomping towards the front door.
Harry cleared his throat uncomfortably. “But uh… I’m not really looking to date anyone right now,” he mumbled, looking away.
He awoke, perfectly refreshed and nightmareless for the first time in what felt like forever. The sun wasn't out that day; it was drizzling, and the sky looked ominous. He sighed as he got dressed, noticing for the first time Hedwig was watching him from her perch on his window sill. When she saw he was looking at her, she stuck out her leg and hooted indignantly, as if to reprimand him for not noticing her earlier. "Thanks, Hedwig." he murmured, untying the string and stroking her soft feathers a few times. She closed her eyes lazily, enjoying the sensation.
Ten minutes passed and he heard an awful wail from the waiting room. He sat up straight in alarm, ignoring the ache in his hip. "Now, ma'am, calm down, please-"
Harry blinked. He had no idea that Voldemort did that. He looked up at Dr. Payne. “Do you think magic not working on me might have something to do with
He was dreading his birthday. He knew, although he didn’t want to admit it, that it was probably his last birthday, and the thought brought tears to his eyes. He sniffed them back, determined not to lose it yet. He hadn’t allowed himself to truly accept what was happening to him yet.
“There is a treatment known as chemotherapy. Harry has a chronic form of leukemia which has progressed, unnoticed, for at least a few years now. He’s been symptomatic for several months and never told anyone. In my professional opinion, Professor Dumbledore, I don’t think chemotherapy will do much to help cure him, but it may prolong his life for a bit. However, it’s an aggressive treatment with a lot of side effects that can-”
The doctor sighed and pulled out his clipboard. “Those are two very good questions, Harry. I’ll answer them as best I can for you. First of all,” he flipped several pages on the clipboard till he reached Harry’s chart. Harry looked and noticed it was a magical chart, as the photo of his sleeping form in the top corner moved slightly. “See here, Harry, on your notes- I
"Harry! Come on then, wake up..." she said, shaking his shoulder slightly. His eyes snapped open and he yelped in pain at the slight pressure his aunt had exerted on his shoulder.
to help? Professor Slughorn barely used to give me the time of day, back then. Surely my limited charisma is not convincing enough to get him to willingly come back to teach at Hogwarts.” reasoned Dr. Payne.
He missed him terribly, he knew Sirius would know exactly how he felt, and even so he wouldn't have felt this way in the first place if Sirius hadn't died! If only Harry had just listened to Hermione and waited for someone who knew what they were doing to go to the Department of Mysteries and save Sirius, who had never even needed saving in the first place! It was all just a big testament to what a hotheaded prick Harry believed he was.
Another nurse walked in, a very tall man, and he showed a second clipboard to the doctor and whispered something in his ear. The doctor’s lips thinned. "That… is unfortunate, but how..?" He glanced at Harry in concern. "I need to talk to your aunt and uncle. Excuse us." he said to Harry as he and the two nurses left the room.
Lupin searched Harry’s gaze, and nodded reluctantly. “I strongly implore you to share this information, though, Harry. Especially if time is limited. If I were you, I would want nothing more than the wholehearted love and support of my friends and family.”
“Yes. That is, of course, if Harry wants to go.” Suddenly there were three sets of eyes on Harry, which made him very uncomfortable. Sensing this, Dumbledore smiled.
knowledge of this, Bella, now hush!” snapped Narcissa, glancing around frightfully, praying that they were not being followed. “We must hurry. Now either you come and be quiet, or return home!” She poked her head around the corner of a building, looking both ways.
The first thing he was conscious of was the pain in his hip. He felt the pain even before he was fully awake. He struggled to blink. Everything was fuzzy and white. Utterly bemused, Harry wondered how he got back to the Hogwarts hospital wing. Then he realized he was in a Muggle hospital. An irritating beeping noise sounded nearby. He reached out automatically for his glasses but his wrist was poked, hard, and he couldn't move it any further. He looked down and saw what looked like a needle sticking into his wrist.
you’re alright, Harry!” exclaimed Hermione, who launched forward to wrap him in a tight hug. He coughed and smiled, hugging her back.
Harry did not stir. As Petunia crouched down irritably next to the fainted boy, she noticed how he looked almost as if he was in pain. Dismissively, she thought to herself,
A warm breeze rattled the panes of the bedroom, breaking the sudden silence that had grown between them. Without saying a word, Lupin went to Harry and hugged him tightly.
Harry was thoughtful for a moment. "Well, my hip hurts, my head feels like it’s been trampled on, and I hate IV's." he mumbled.
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake, this is why I prefer working with Muggles.” he muttered, getting up to brush the Floo dust off of his lab coat. He glanced at the fireplace and shook his head. On the one hand, he was rather grateful that he didn’t have to tell Harry there was
“Blasphemy! I will not stay and listen to treasonous words!” cried Bellatrix, pointing to her sister. “If it were anyone else, Cissy, I’d blast you into the chair you’re sitting in, but keep going the way you’re going and the Dark Lord will take care of you himself! And I’m not sticking around to see it. Goodbye!” she turned on her heels and stomped angrily outside, slamming the door behind for good measure. The echo reverberated through the mostly empty house. Narcissa sighed and shook her head as she watched her sister Apparate out of the yard.
"Alright then. Make some breakfast now, would you?" he demanded. Harry obeyed. As he approached the kitchen, the wave of dizziness crashed upon him again like a train wreck.
Mrs. Weasley piped in, “Oh, yes, Harry, I’ve made a delicious meal for dinner, if I do say so myself, I very much think-”
Harry’s heart ached at the word ‘family.’ It was a good kind of pain, because even though Sirius was no longer with them, that didn’t make Harry an orphan all over again, though it had felt like it in his isolation with the Dursleys. He still had Ron, and Hermione, the rest of the Order, and the Weasleys.
Hermione looked a bit doubtful, sniffing again. Her face was red and puffy; her usually bushy hair even more frazzled than usual. “What idea?”
The next few days at the Burrow were rather uneventful for Harry. He stayed in Fred and George’s room most of the time, sleeping or staring out the window. Quite often, someone, usually Mrs. Weasly, would come up and knock, bringing him food without question, asking how he was doing. He was extraordinarily good at feigning his being alright, even when he clearly wasn’t. Most of the time, he made at least an effort to eat what she brought him, and she didn’t say anything when he would return the plate half full. Outside his earshot, his friends whispered secret plans of cakes and gifts and having a good time. No one thought about how Harry might feel about all this hullabaloo.
Hermione smiled, pretending as if she hadn’t just been bawling a few minutes prior. “Hello, Professor! So you think the party’s a good idea?”
Ginny didn’t say anything for a moment, and then shrugged. “Alright, I guess. But it’s your loss. Let me know if you change your mind.”
He sat in silence for a minute, feeling rather like he had whiplash from that strange encounter, and sighed deeply.
With shaky hands he put the bucket next to him, avoiding eye contact. He put his face in his hands and closed his eyes, trying to get the dizziness to fade away.
“Well, thank you anyways,” replied Harry, swinging his legs over to sit upright on the couch. He yawned and stretched, trying to ignore how everyone’s attention was still on him. He cleared his throat.
more shocking. "Ummm... Aunt Petunia, what's wrong, exactly?" he asked uncomfortably, extracting her from himself.
These sorts of unfortunate thoughts continued to haunt Harry Potter as he got up and trudged wearily back to the door of number twelve, Privet Drive. He glanced back towards Magnolia Crescent, and was reminded of last year when those bloody dementors were sent by Umbridge to do him away. He ought to have let them, he mused, and then this whole mess would have never happened.
Perhaps the damage had been dealt too severely. Maybe he could never forgive them. But all Harry could think of was the look on his aunt’s face, the genuine emotions and words she had spoken from the heart, when he had been sure she didn’t have one a long time ago.
“Uh… Look. Ginny…” he turned to face her, scooching himself and the magazine back a few inches away from her. How would he get out of this mess?
Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away until he heard the back door open behind him. He quickly stuffed the magazine under his butt and pretended to act inconspicuous, although his ears were a furious shade of red.
“You’d best watch your tongue, Narcissa, or I will gladly remove it for you!” Snape’s voice was a low growl. He stood up, staring at her with his cold, beady eyes. “As I said, the Dark Lord has power we know not. It is unwise to voice that which you truly believe.” He glanced over to the windows, and shut the curtains with his wand. “It is unwise to even think of it in his presence.”
He went downstairs and handed the note to Uncle Vernon. "My friend's parents are coming to get me next week. Just thought you should know." he said blandly as Uncle Vernon read over the short letter.
After many hours of food, laughter, and several fireworks, Harry was exhausted in a good way for the first time in months. He plopped down on the couch inside while his ragtag family continued their antics outdoors; music and chatter could be heard from inside.
“That is enough.” Snape said. His voice was like ice, and she shivered. “I am one of the Dark Lord’s most trusted Death Eaters. Do you think I am so stupid as to have not noticed these things myself?”
he thought, realizing his embarrassment over the magazine stemmed from the way he was captivated on the long, strong limbs of the men therein;
Dr. Payne was not pleased. Barely awake, he yawned, dressed in his blue and white striped night robes with a matching cap. “Professor, excuse me, but why have you dragged me out into who-knows-where at this time of night?” he asked, voice hoarse with sleep.
“I’m afraid there is nothing you can do further, Mr. Dursley.” interrupted Dumbledore calmly. Vernon turned an unflattering shade of purple and looked as though he would certainly like to say more, but at a gentle nudge from Petunia he simply held his tongue. She looked up at Dumbledore.
At this question, Dumbledore’s smile faltered. He appeared rather somber, in fact. This was not encouraging to Harry, who began to feel a bit dizzy.
"Well, I started back here at around five. So I passed out for two hours." he said, surprised and relieved that he hadn't had any nightmares. She narrowed her beady eyes.
“Deep breaths, Harry. Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, why don’t you come with me. I think Harry needs a bit of time to take all this in.” He led Harry’s estranged relatives out of the room, and he was left spinning once more.
Holy SHIT I am SO sorry this took so long to update. I've has writers' block for MONTHS (cough; years) and I have the worst executive dysfunction a person could have. Please enjoy the second chapter. I apologize again!!!
Harry could care less about who helped who. He just wanted to be alone to sulk in peace. Instead, he sighed, staring at his hands in his lap.
“The Dark Lord may well be punishing your family for the incident at the Ministry, Narcissa.” he said cooly. “And who am I to try standing in the way? To be punished as well?”
The doctor took a quick glance around to make sure no one was watching, before pulling out a slender bit of wood from the inside of his lab coat. It took the exhausted Harry a second to realize that that was a wand, and that Dr. Payne was a wizard. In the next second, he was trying his very best to scramble away from what his tired brain perceived to be a threat.
“I’ve got cancer.” Harry blurted out. It was the first time he’d said it out loud. “It- it can’t be treated with magic, and- and I’m probably going to die from it within a year.”
As soon as the bin was thrust into his lap he vomited spectacularly into it. His whole world spun, as if he was in a Portkey. He had so many questions reeling through his head.
“With gusto. Well then, to answer your question, I think I’ve always known I was gay, but I was in a fair bit of denial about it until my early twenties.”
Harry nodded, he’d been thinking the same thing, but there was a single set of footprints, bright gold atop the fading trail to the first year dormitory, and through the hole Harry had kicked in the last time Clark had been in mortal peril.
It seemed to be working, Draco’s lovely cheekbones had that tinge of pink as he stripped off his undershirt, adding it to the pile. He then crouched to unlace his carefully polished shoes. Those came off along with his socks, trousers, and pants, leaving him standing, utterly bared. Harry let his eyes rake over the other boy for a long moment: the lean muscles of his shoulders and chest, pale trail of hair beneath his navel, keen jut of cock and those long, lean quads and calves, powerful in their own right.
Professor Malfoy waved his wand and the ingredients spread across the counter began to organise themselves and the fresh labels affixed themselves appropriately. The ivory box flew back to its shelf, the powered hooves poured into a jar which was stoppered and tucked neatly away. “I’ve no proof beyond coincidence that such a curse exists. I’m certain if it did, any one of the headmasters or mistresses would have addressed it by now. Besides, even if it does exist, I doubt I would have the capabilities to end it. I’m a potions master, James, not a hexbreaker. But believe me, if anyone could evade a curse issued by the Dark Lord, it is your father. As I’ve said before, he’s a very powerful wizard. Please don’t worry yourself.”
Ron scrambled to his feet, coughing, and scurried from the room, sending a furtive glance at his wife, who looked nearly as furious as Harry.
Harry watched as the starting line kicked off and up, feeling that familiar stirring of excitement gathering with him. He climbed the stands to sit with Ron, who was doing the match commentary. He was surprised to see Draco already there, seated beside the redhead, with Neville on his other side. Most of the other coaches had also grabbed seats nearby.
himself do so. But Potter’s precarious bondage had left him breathless, caught between trying to keep his footing and withstanding the heavy blows which made him ache with pain and soaring need. He’d not expected Potter to put his mouth on him, either, and the way he had done it...it was as if he had been hoping to wind Draco up even further, to deny him and not simply to please him. When he’d pulled off, Draco had almost screamed in frustration. Previous partners came in two unsatisfying flavours: men who neglected Draco’s cock entirely, or men who were too generous with their attentions, desperate to please. Neither sufficed. Potter existed at the boundary between the two: urging forward then pulling back, providing and refusing.
“Yes, of course,” Harry said. He was relieved enough at the interruption to ignore Jamie’s rudeness. “Out you go. I’ll call when pudding’s ready.”
“Excellent, excellent,” Slughorn remarked, unlocking the cabinet. “I’ll leave you two to get started—just realised I’ve left the hog nephroliths in my office! Can’t bound without those!” And with that, he swept out of the classroom.
“'Course,” Harry reassured him with a grin, “Thanks for arranging all this.” He gestured to Dean and Olivier.
The words settled heavily in Harry’s stomach. He wasn’t confident he’d chosen the most helpful path, lately. “But then what do you do when you bollocks things up? Ruminate on what you did wrong, or just forgive yourself instantly and refuse to dwell on it? But if you do the latter, how do you keep from doing the same stupid thing all over again?” he urged, feeling suddenly very unworldly.
Harry wasn’t convinced. What if he got up in front of his first class and couldn’t think of a single thing to say? Worse, what if he embarrassed Al and James? It was not a problem he could ever imagine Draco encountering. “I bet your lesson plans are immaculate.”
Malfoy shifted his knees apart, wrapping his hand around himself. Harry found that spot within him again and Malfoy yelped.
It was a good question, and one Draco didn’t have a ready answer for, save for Potter being so helplessly lost and unwittingly gorgeous. Draco kissed the man’s neck again. He liked the warmth of the skin beneath his touch.
Malfoy’s returning smile was almost warm. “I suppose we could. In that case, yes, Pansy is a dear friend. Ridiculous and self-indulgent, but irritatingly insightful.”
Harry nodded gratefully, relieved that Malfoy had the vocabulary when Harry didn’t, that he was so fearless in naming it, “Either way,” Harry continued, “doesn’t matter, we’re together. Now, I know you probably didn’t know much about the war before coming here, but you’ve probably gathered from the rumour mill that Draco and I were on opposite sides of it.”
“We could have taken the tube,” Clark grumbled, rubbing just above his navel. “Hate those bloody things.”
He toyed with him like this for several minutes, adoring the hypnotic effect it seemed to have on Draco, as he followed Harry’s hand. He startled when Harry hit him, leaned into his palm when he pet him, gagged when Harry forced him to. His pale face was tinged pink, his ice grey eyes wide and shiny.  Drawing the responses out of Malfoy like this was intoxicating. He was so supple, so compliant. Harry hit him again, slightly harder this time and Draco cried out, not in pain, just in
Oh gosh, thanks to everyone for the utterly life-affirming comments on the last chapter, you are too wonderful by half!
"He's perfectly fine, love, our spells took," Draco said, his voice calm, a steadying hand on Harry's low back, but Harry couldn't believe it. He needed eyes on Clark, right this instant. He grabbed a broom someone had stashed in the corner of the stands and leapt onto it without asking, sailing down towards the fallen figure, swiftly as though he were chasing a snitch. By the time he reached him, Clark was standing, a little wobbly and a bit surprised, but fully intact.
“You know, Clark,” Harry said, trying to sound cheerful, “I bet Draco here has never seen anything on telly. Why don’t we watch something.”
Harry wondered if Draco was going to finish in his mouth, and found he didn’t mind, so much had shifted for him in a few short weeks. Now he wanted that which would have freaked him out not long ago.
But then again, maybe he didn’t. Maybe they would all just force a smile, congratulate him, pat him on the back, all while inwardly thinking he’d only gotten this chance because of the war. A decency extended to a public figure. Or maybe they’d be jealous. Not that he didn’t think they would be happy for him, but that uncomfortable feeling of being chosen when others hadn’t, he’d been through it so many times before.
“I know she’s my sister,” Ron muttered, “but you’re my best mate and you’re every bit as much family to me as she is. Whatever you decide to do, I’ll stand by you. You know I will.”
“Most of it just sounds like Lucius’ typical horseshit,” he said quietly, “I knew Draco was receiving letters from him, and I think the one about Valentine’s just arrived yesterday morning. I saw him pocket it at breakfast. The only thing that seems at all suspect is the bit about the injury in September. I saw his knee. It was wrecked. He couldn’t have faked it; I know Madam Pomfrey would not have been fooled. But he wouldn’t name names, either. I never did figure out who was responsible.”
Draco gave himself a once-over in the mirror, but refused to allow himself more than that. There would be, he decided, no changing of outfits or fussing with his hair, like a nervy teenager.
And so his mind went around and around in this manner, drifting from one devastating possible conclusion to the next, and, when he had been through them all, starting over again.
Draco was thankfully spared from answering that particular line of questioning by the reemergence of Potter, hair damp and with a vague scent of cedar about him.
Later that night, Harry had crept into Malfoy’s bed. Somehow over the last few weeks it had become routine—always Draco’s bed, never Harry’s. Harry suspected Draco liked making Harry come to him.
And Harry and Draco have been through wars and Fiendfyre and devastating loss, so of course they can handle any crisis brought to their door by Crystal Tiering.
“Probably let me die, the way things have been going,” Harry muttered darkly, he had that uncomfortable, brittle feeling he always did after a bit of cry. “He’s none too pleased with me.” Nevertheless, he conceded her point. Harry didn’t like to think about Jamie being as distraught and miserable as Malfoy had been that fateful day in the lavatory. He didn’t want any of his kids to face any decisions more difficult than what they might like to do after Hogwarts. He’d give anything to shield them from the atrocities of his youth.
“Yes,” Dudley stood firm. “Listen, I’m not saying I had it bad like Harry. I didn’t, and I know that. But it was fucked up growing up like that. Watching my parents treat a kid like that, and thinking it was normal, accepting as course that I could beat him up whenever I wanted to and that no one would protect him. I must have broken his nose three times, and no one even blinked, let alone comforted him.”
And yet, the middle aged woman standing timidly before him held none of her usual propriety and pompousness; she now wore the face of a concerned mother, the way
and all their attention was focused on her-” Petunia stopped for a moment to choke back a sob. Harry watched in amazement as her walls fell for the first time.
