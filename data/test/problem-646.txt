Bellatrix looks at him softly pursing her lips, “will you be okay for 3 days my flower?”
Sirius was sitting next to James wearing an all-black suit with a complimenting gold watch. He was the only person here with no significant other. This is the only time Harry felt jealous of Sirius. He politely smiled to Ginerva who gave him another peck on the cheek.
Theo nodded, “well things like that get confusing, especially when magic is a factor.”
Harry felt the same. The moment he held his first wand, he finally knew who he was. Being a wizard is who he is, and without magic, he feels he would be lost. These slaves...children must be feeling lost, a part of themselves missing because they never practiced magic.
Fred chuckled at the blonde’s astonishment, as with a wave of his hand dismissing the thankful blonde.
“What’s a phone?” Theo asked as he continued to mess with his grip on the wand.
“A Cure…”
Harry wiped out the sweat from his brow as he looked at his potion. He thinks he did fairly well as the color matched Hermione Jean’s. Professor Snape came up to him looking at the potion as he checked something off his clipboard, “Good Job Harrison” he spoke his voice still soft and contained.
“Cruciatus curse?” Harry asked his voice high. “Umm….isn’t that an unforgivable curse?”
George looked agitated and looked like he was going to complain, but was silenced by a hard glare by Snape.
“My lords, My lady” a smaller black haired bow bowed at Him, Ronald and Hermione Jean.
“Stay safe Harry?”
“Sorry sir,” Harry responded as he took a sip of his tea.
“No, put your arm back up and try again,” Harry said. “Try saying the incantation with meaning, and remember spells do not work without intent.”
Draco chewed his bottom lip look at the ground while still holding the pain reliever potion. Harry let out a soft sigh as he kneeled back on the ground to look up at Draco. “Please drink the potion Draco, as it will help you feel better, please,” he begged as he slowly placed a hand on Draco’s knee rubbing it comfortingly.
Harry grabbed the remote turning on the TV smiling to see a cooking show being played.
Harry picked up Cassiopeia who was now at his feet rubbing her head on his calf. He held the kitten close to his heart smelling her fur. Somehow it was a mix of her own scent as well as Draco’s sweet scent Harry has gotten used to smelling. Harry chuckled to himself. Every time Draco is in this room he always touches and hugs Cassiopeia like he can’t bear to part from her.
“Nope” Luna’s voice entered as she rolled her eyes.
“Why haven’t you told your pathetic parents about what you found?” Snape growled completely ignoring Harry’s words.
Theo let out a deep sigh before saying “Lumos” in a timid tone. Nothing happened. The room was so quiet, you can hear a pin drop. Theo looked defeated as he let his arm down.
Harry’s eyes widen in shock at Snape’s words, “no...no professor!” Harry exclaimed, “I wanted to make sure you weren’t hurting Draco!” he defended himself as he shrunk back into the wall at Snape’s glare.
Harry flipped through more pages,
Draco let out a gasp of horror, as he clenched his hair, “YOU WILL MOST NOT!” He yells. Fred and George chuckle. “Relax princess, wouldn’t want to harm a hair on your little head.”
“May be forever reign? Supreme?” Harry asked his voice going high.
Harry nodded, “Yes sir, I know.” Harry finished the last sips in his tea, “thank you for giving me a brief introduction, and I will do anything in my power to help.”
Harry snorted at the memory, as he flipped through the pages of the book, skimming through some paragraphs. Harry studied the basic physics when he was in primary school with the Dursley’s and he absolutely hated that class. No one, with a sane mind, would study physics for fun. While flipping through the pages of the book, something caught his eye. The Yin-Yang theory. In big, bold and black letters. As Harry read the scientific theory, he was ecstatic as he finally got a deeper understanding of what might be happening to him.
Snape smirked, “Sirius will be your brother-in-law,” he teased to the redhead who simply smacked him in the arm.
“I know Theo, but it needs to be done” Harry comforted the boy stroking his damp hair. Harry grabbed a cold cloth as he placed it on Theo’s ear who hissed at the touch. “H..how is your ear?” Harry asked mentally hitting himself for the stupid question.
Harry looked around the room again to see a variety of people he knew and didn’t know. They will not trust him, but he was, sure enough, he will earn their trust if it is the last thing he will do. Severus and Bellatrix were still talking, Harry wasn’t sure what he had missed as he listened to their conversation again.
“My lords” the voice spoke in a soft commanding tone which Harry didn’t expect. This man still refused to bow down and it showed in how he presented himself even if his outer appearance looks defeated.
Theo smiled again, “o.ok Harry, a..are you going back home?” he asked his voice cracking high with worry.
“Thankfully, Severus created a special potion, to allow this young beauty to stay youthful and be mine forever,” Dumbledore added purring unearthly.
Cassiopeia suddenly came out underneath the couch, her tiny mouth yawning in which you can only see a pink dot. Dahlia cooed at the sight of the calico kitten as she picked her up cuddling her close to her chest.
“You...Did...Not…” Draco stared at Snape before letting out a squeal, “Uncle Sev just made a pun! Wait till I tell the others.”
Neville blinked at Harry unsure of what to make of his tone, “are you….”
Hermione ‘Jean’ looked at Harry as she had a strict face. Ronald sighed, “He fell Hermione Jean
Harry passes by sections A-G before he reaches H. Tracing the books with his fingers until he reaches Hogwarts: A history. Smiling to himself he sneakily takes the book into his bad casting a special charm invented by Hermione when she used to sneak more books out of the library. Harry sighed as he thinks about his actual friends and how he misses them so much. “I will come back guys” he promises softly.
“Rosier,” Snape says his voice low. Snape looks at Harry with his eyes narrowed, but Harry could see a glimpse of fear, “Dahlia Rosier.”
Harry narrows his eyes interrupting the scared boy, “sometimes what?” his voice low.
Harry frowned. He wondered how have Theo and the rest of the slaves coped without using magic. Harry knew he would not survive, as magic is embedded in his very DNA, it is part of who he is as a person.
“But what Potter?” Snape interrupted still holding Harry firmly against the wall.
“Of course dear,” her soft voice whispered glancing at Lucius with mellow eyes. Lucius immediately relaxed at the sight of his wife.
Harry remembered Hermione telling him, about how she finally felt herself, when she got her Hogwarts letter. Hermione knew something about her was different, being a witch is a major factor that defines who she is. She never knew until she got her letter, and was able to fill the missing puzzle piece.
Harry was browsing through the books in the library bored out of his mind. Everyone he knew was in Hogsmeade, but since he refused to go he lied to his ‘friends’ and said he had to study. He wanted to talk to Theo, but he told the brunette to stay in his room for safety reasons.
Harry always wanted a family dinner. He envisioned it. With his parents, his godfather and the people he considered his family. This was not it. Looking around the table, he doesn’t recognize any of these people.
Harry nodded, “right, sorry I forgot to tell you, Ronald, I kept your slave to clean my room as payment for what I did to him,” he said as he kept his hands in his pockets silently hating himself for calling Draco a slave.
“What was the war about?” Nott bit his lip before speaking, “the light and the dark my lord...my family...they fought for the dark and because of that a price must be payed.” Harry took a sip of his pumpkin juice, “but what did they fight about?” Nott gulped, “b..blood purity my lord, t..they want to eradicate all p.purebloods.” Harry shook his head, “But that is impossible! I mean if you continue to marry within magic family a pureblood child will certainly come!”
Theo smiled softly, “t.that must have been nice my lord.” Theo finally with the courage looked up at Harry’s eye studying them. He thought, these eyes were the same yet somehow different from Lord Harrison. Theo felt, this person was telling the truth about alternate worlds. “H.how was I like in your world my lord?”
Dumbledore smiled sickly at the vile while looking at Tom, who was glaring at the people in the room.
“Very well fusty, get up, you will be trying some of my potions,” Snape said as Draco quickly got up wiping his tears. Snape looked at the picture ashes on the floor, then looked at George “because you recklessly cast that spell in the halls, you will clean the ashes yourself without magic.”
Harry looked at Hermione Jean and Ronald who rolled their eyes going to the stockroom getting the ingredients. Harry followed them as he silently eyed others in the ingredients he was supposed to get, silently glad he is good at this solution because he, Hermione and Ron had to make it when they were searching for the Horcruxes.
The trio walked for what seemed to be a while in complete silence when in reality, it was a couple of minutes. They entered a room. The room was completely dark with just a small window in the top corner of the room with grates which allowed some light to flicker through. The room was a big dusty concrete slab. The concrete slab had dark stains all around, Harry could only assume was blood.
“I wanted an actual family, did you know?”
“Yes, master” Pansy whispered as Harry strained to hear her.
Harry nodded, he wasn’t aware the Avery’s had children. He wondered if one world new people can exist compared to his world. But then again, he didn’t know Avery at all. Or any of the death eaters in fact. He wondered if any of them had a family. He felt a sinking pit in his stomach, he wondered if any of the children of the death eaters might have parents who died during the war. They didn’t deserve that, just like how Harry didn’t deserve his parents dying, or Teddy, or even Neville. Just because their parents were on the wrong side of the war doesn’t mean they deserved the consequences of it. Which is what happened severely in this world.
“What was that? You know how I hate your mumbling,” Bellatrix retorts.
Dahlia smiled, “good...but Severus for Potter, I don’t think the Knights will take too kindly to him.”
“You’re more of an idiot Black,” Severus sneers out staring out the window.
Draco nodded, “Thank you, my lord.”
“That dream sucks,” Ron says followed by numerous agreements.
Severus nodded, “I plan to teach him the spell to get back if he goes before we defeat the order.”
“Do you think you can get me the first aid kit?” Harry asked as he stood up and walked towards his bed. “Yes my lord” Nott replied as he got up to a cabinet. When Nott returned, Harry gestured for him to sit on the bed as Harry clipped his shirt up.
Snape and Draco were on the couch and they seemed to be hugging. ”It was all I had of them, Uncle Sev.” Draco wiped a tear from his cheek. “I don’t even remember what they look like, that was the only thing.” Draco buried his face into Snape’s neck letting silent tears fall.
“Okay then, I will be back in 3 days flower,” his mother gives him a soft kiss on his head before he lowers her down for her journey.
----------
Draco’s eyes widen with surprise, as a soft smile curved at his lip. “T..thank you my lord!” he exclaimed. “T..thank you so much!” Draco was extremely happy to have fresh bread. The bread he and his friends have usually is moldy, stale and hard, but this batch smelled fresh, delicious and soft, so he was excited to share the yummy rolls with his friends.
“Who is Teddy?” Harry asked with confusion. He knew in his world, Tonks and Remus had a son nicknamed Teddy before they passed, but in this world, Nymphadora and Remus do have a son and they just call him by his real name, Edward.
“Ok Theo, this is going to sound extremely crazy, but I am not from this world.” Harry blurted out.
Dahlia refusing to be intimidated sniggers out, “I don’t know, I’ve been told I have a very, nice tongue.” She sticks her tongue out licking her lips provocatively at Frank smirking slightly as the man turned bright red in the face in anger and humiliation.
“Sometimes...well...they will use us for demonstrations...just thought you should know” Theo answers looking down. Harry lets out a frustrated sigh as he slams his fists to his bed.
“Today we will be transfiguring people into teacups” Professor McGonagall starts off before smirking, “You never know when you need a nice cup of tea, and there are no teacups available,” she says as she picks up a porcelain white teacup steaming with hot tea as she takes a sip.
Draco snorted, “Uncle Sev, you’re my godfather, not my reckless cousin.” Snape silenced him with a deadly glare. Draco shrunk at his godfather’s hard stare mumbling a soft “I’m sorry.”
While flipping through the pages, something caught his eye. The Contrarium Doctrina [a.ka. Opposite Theory]. In big, bold and black letters. As Harry read the scientific theory, he was ecstatic as he finally got a deeper understanding of what might be happening to him. The book states that the universe is divided into two, which is called the duo universe. The worlds connect, but they don't rely on one another, they coincide peacefully together on its own. The duo universe works like this, In one world you might be an Auror, in the other world, you might be in Azkaban. Completely opposite beings who are the same person. Another way the duo universe can coincide is, in one universe you are dead, but in the other universe you are alive.
Professor Snape nodded, “tell your mother hi when you see her next”. Snape went to the front of the classroom and waved his hand with dismissal “class dismissed”. Harry then realized why Snape’s had a cheerful demeanor. Apparently, in this world, Snape was still in love with his mum, who is still alive.
Lily nodded as she laughed at Remus’s comment in which he whispered in her ear. “Have fun, my child,” the green-eyed witch said as they disappeared into the hall.
The three reached a rocky dead end with the guards closes behind them. “Now, why don’t we make a human ladder, since you two are a little bigger I will climb on you then pull you up?” Harry suggests.
----------
Harry gulped as he whimpered out, “I don’t want any slaves to be tortured, sir.”
Harry gulped, “Are you hungry”? Nott looked at the food his mouth slightly open as Harry heard his stomach growl softly. “I’ll take that as a yes then” Harry spoke as he beckoned Nott to come to him.
Harry reached the end of the corridor to see a painting of a quidditch pitch. “Treacle Tart” Nott spoke, as the painting opened. Harry stepped in his eyes widening with amazement at his room or large studio. It wasn’t all red and gold like the Gryffindor common room, but rather simple and modernistic to his taste. A large Alaskan King with bed laid with 4 polls with soft pillows and plush blankets. Harry could see his closet with tons of grand regal looking clothes…and crowns? Harry’s mouth dropped open to see a TV in a living room with fluffy couches and a coffee table/
Nott nodded again as he started to eat his chicken. Harry sighed, “don’t you talk?” he asked in a gradual manner. Nott looked at him confused, “f..f.orgive me m..my lord, but you said if I e..e..ever spoke out of turn you ww..wwould c..c...cut out my tongue.” he stuttered out. Harry combed his hair back,
Harry, the Gryffindor team and Hufflepuff team all fly to the ground looking at the seeker in concern. Truthfully, Harry could care less what happened to Diggory, but he still had to keep up pretenses of a concerned Harrison.
“I will heal him,” Harry gets the courage to speak out after seeing the blonde’s face with a look he swore he would never forget. Not the look Draco got after being hurt by Buckbeak, but the look in the restroom. When Harry cast a spell he never knew before. When Draco was there lying on the ground with slashes across his chest in a puddle of his own blood, he had this look Harry will never forget. The look, that he wanted to die.
Theo nods beaming to Harry, “my life has gotten a whole lot better now that you’re my master.”
“I mean, from what you said in order to get into the other world, a portal must be made. But no portals were made, there seems to have been maybe a shift in conscious between you two.” Theo said.
“Ginerva’s right mate,” George spoke out as he held a pitcher with steam coming of the top.
Voldemort...Tom glared at Dumbledore, “I will never be yours,
Draco chuckles slightly, “Mine too…So mother…my birthday is coming up.” Bellatrix is humming by the mirror looking at her face, “ummm, I don’t think so flower, your birthday was last year,” she responds. “I distinctly remember.”
“Xavi, my fearless prince!” she exclaimed with joy, peppering soft kisses all over his face. Alexander’s face scrunched up in disgust, as he tried to push her away.
Harry looks at it confused, “uhhh you mean the lanterns the King and Queen put out every year for the missing prince?”
“Am I done. Sir?” Harry’s voice broke through trying to end the animosity with his professors, mother and an upset Tom.
“I want to see the floating lights mother,” Draco says louder looking up at her. “The ones that happen every year ON my birthday.” He gestures to the floating lights he painted on the roof.
Harry perked up at the mention of the Knights, “they fought?”
Fred kissed Poppy on the cheek comforting her, “It’s ok Pops, we will take over our parents legacy to make sure they never hurt an innocent again”
Harry shook his head, “I don’t know, there are many other good foods as well, especially from other parts of the world! I wish Hogwarts served foods like that as well, like curry and rice, or a bowl of ramen, a nice big burrito…” Harry trailed off, his mouth drooling slightly.
Professor McGonagall starts to teach the class diving deeper into the theory of transfiguration, as Harry tried to focus but failed. “Facti PocUlum is the spell to turn your fusties into a teacup,” Professor McGonagall says loudly startling Harry from his trance. “Begin practicing students, and remember to enunciate the U,” McGonagall says. The fusties in the side of the room walked over to their respective master’s sitting in front of them with their head down, as people started to say the spell. [Facti Poculum: become cup]
“Potter, what a surprise.” A feminine voice drawls. Draco looks up to see a brown bushy haired girl sitting down with her legs on another guys lap. The guy, red haired, freckles on his face, also pretty tall spits at Harry’s feet.
“J...just a stomachache Harry,” Theo groaned out as he clutched his stomach harder. “It hurts really bad, I don’t know why!” the brunette wailed out in pain. The wails echoed in the room making Harry feel a pang of sorrow in his chest at his friend’s agony.
“Dahlia, I mean it, do not underestimate the order.”
Harry smiled as he distinctly remembered the conversation.
Ronald looked at him weird, “to get our fusties, remember? We have History of Magic in a bit”
“Not you, I meant him,” Remus says hitting him in the head and then gestured to Draco smiling.
Nott wearily walked over as his feet dragged on the plush carpet. He grabbed the pumpkin juice can as he refilled Harry’s glass and then walked behind Harry standing. Harry sighed as he knew he would have to be more specific. “Come sit and eat with me Theo”. Harry said with an edge to his voice. He heard Nott whimper softly as he cursed himself again. He hated to speak like that.
Harry saw how quickly Draco picked up the fallen bread rolls panting softly. As soon as all the bead rolls were on the tray, Draco handed it back to Fred who looked at it with disgust.
“What? So the muggle-borns family can go accidentally blabbing to their muggle friends, or the muggle-born does magic accidentally in their world!” Snape yelled. “Wizards and witches will be burned at the stake Potter. There will be war!”
Astoria looked shocked at Harry speaking to her as she casted her eyes down, “u…m well my Lord, and y..yourself?” she stuttered out.
“Why did you bring him here?” Bellatrix harshly whispered.”He is the enemy! How can you be so stupid to bring him here? OUR people are hiding here for safety and you go and bring the son of Lord James Potter and Lady Lily Potter.” she spat out the names venomously. “He will go running back to his mummy and daddy and the Order will come and wipe out everyone here, including our elderly, sick and Xavi, a CHILD!”
Dumbledore nodded, “honestly, I just wanted to call you in to wish you luck in the Quidditch match this weekend. Hufflepuff is ahead by Gryffindor and I have a wager going on with Professor Sprout.”
Harry perked up at hearing quidditch. No one talked to him about what happened with Diggory, and even though Cedric deserved what happened, Harry couldn’t help but feel guilty. Harry didn’t understand why Draco would be asking about quidditch, but then again Quidditch gave Harry a source of happiness, watching it, playing it, cheering for your team. Quidditch will always hold a special place in Harry’s heart, as it was one of his first introductions to wizarding tradition.
“Thank you Remus, and don’t forget to live out yours.” Draco gives Remus a hug and went inside the secret door just as the palace guards busted open the door.
“Lucius, I don’t think Severus would lie to us and if he had even one ounce of doubt, he wouldn’t have brought Harrison...Harry here.” Narcissa spoke out. Her voice was soft and gentle.
“Uncle Sev!! Don’t call me that,” the blonde whined softly as Snape and Dahlia chuckled.
“How does it feel, your most trusted person was a spy, Tom?” Tom said nothing but pursed his lips together still glaring with resistance. “Because of your trust in Severus... your side failed and lost miserably,” Dumbledore teased at glaring man.
Draco always made Harry laugh with his snarky pun like remarks. It reminded him of the Draco in his world. Maybe if those remarks weren’t delivered with such malice, Harry probably would have found it funny.
Ronald looked at him with an evil glint in his eye, “P…p…please my lord” he mocked as he pointed his wand again. “Stay still, I want to Ace my practical.” Ronald narrowed his eyes before saying, “Crucio” a red light flew out from his wand hitting Draco in the chest as he let out another scream his body spasming.
“See you never captain,” Harry responds back laughing before suddenly tripping over into the wall next to him falling through. Harry looks to see that the guard rode past him as the vines covered the massive hole in the rock. Harry grabs his satchel and turns around shocked to see a beautiful land with a long tower in front of him/
“Ronald, you can’t expect the fusty to carry your books with the arm like that can you?” Harry spoke up eyeing him up. Ronald looks at Draco rolling his eyes, “well I don’t want to heal him, and Madam Pomfrey won’t cause he is a fusty so…” Ronald shrugs his shoulders, “I probably might later, if I feel up to it, cause you know, they still need to do stuff for us” he grins.
Harry stepped out of the room into a small corridor in the hall as he gathered his breathing.
“I mean he messed up Dean’s drink, your friend, he needs to be punished.”
“Will you teach me more about the wizarding traditions sir?” Harry asked hopefully. Maybe if he learns the traditions here by someone who actually knows it accurately, he will bring it back into his world and it would unite the purebloods, half-bloods, and Muggle-borns as together they can celebrate their wizarding heritage.
“Oh!” She exclaimed giving him a hug back, “what is this now? Harrison hugging his dear old mother” she chuckled.
Harry held back a giggle, he now wanted to see this little calico kitty in action. He always saw the funny cat videos online on Dudley’s computer when the Dursleys were out on a family dinner, and that always cheered him up, to see the cute little creatures act so feisty.
“They caught someone,” Remus speaks out as he was looking out the window.
“The other world?”
The jealous sister stood in the window of the nursery. She sang softly, gasping when the hair of the child lit up golden as she felt the magic wave through her. She used her knife to cut off a strand, before she knew it the magic stopped and that strand went blonde. Now she knew, the hair couldn’t be cut, or the magic would die. She grabbed the sleeping child waking him up with tears and jumped out the window.
Then again...maybe not. Harry  knew he spoke too soon, when Fred looked at him weird again. “Mate, I am saying this because I care for you...um are you okay?” Fred asked genuinely concerned.
Draco stared longingly up at the sky. His birthday was in a few days and he hoped that his mother would finally take him to see the floating lights. Draco gets up walking around the room careful not to entangle his hair which has grown to over 60 feet long. “Mother, this will be by 18th birthday…….no.” Draco lets out a frustrated sigh. As he plops down on the ground.
Remus chuckled, “well, Ronald, you are doing it slightly wrong”. Remus went to the front standing in front of a shivering Draco whose head was down. Remus raised his wand, “you need to have precise accuracy when doing this curse, and you need to mean it”. Remus glared at Draco “Really mean it” before speaking a low “crucio”. The red light brighter than before shot out hitting Draco in the chest again who screamed like Harry never heard before. The scream was high pitched and jarring to the ear.
“Yes, I gathered Potter,” Snape replied taking a sip. “However, looking through your memories, you seem competent enough to help us.” Snape shivered at his words as he rarely gives kind words, and when he does it takes a serious toll mentally.
“Still standing strong and ready to fight Dahlia, he will join us whenever we are ready.”
Authors Note: Hey guys! Another chapter up :) Please let me know what you think
Hermione Jean and Ginvera gasped as their hands went to their mouths. Harry felt his ears pound.
“Fusty is very feisty,” Frank comments as he pulls on the rope hard causing her to fall to the floor. “It might take a longer time to break her.”
“Uhh gurses?” Harry asked questioning. Seamus snickered. “Clueless as ever eh Harrison” as he gave Harry a polite shove.
which caused a ripple of me’s in the cottage. The people stood up with their weapons pointing to Harry. As two buff men come out tying him to the chair.
Harry caught Theo’s eyes and knew with everything that was going on with the atmosphere in the room, he has to keep up with the pretext that he is a cruel and ruthless person. “Well you better hurry up fusty, you got legs for a reason” Harry threatened, adding menace in his voice to sell the scenario happening between him and Theo.
“Do you want more Theo?” Harry asked softly. Nott looked at him with sad eyes then looked back down, “I’m ok my lord.” He spoke so soft, Harry strained his ears to hear them. Harry put another piece of chicken on Nott’s plate as well as a cookie. Nott smiled softly eyeing the cookie as he took a bite.
“Draco, stop with the stars, you will NEVER leave this tower, EVER!” His mother yells, “Do I make myself clear?”
Harry was furious. He was seeing red in that he wanted to track down the red-headed twins and murder them on spot. How could anyone play this cruel of a joke and laugh about it after seeing the look of anguish on the victim's faces? Harry wondered if these people lack empathy, in which Harry would gladly give some of his, considering he has too much of it.
“Tom...how is he?”
“WOahhhh!” Alexander wowed in amazement. “I can’t wait Hawwy!!” the young boy cheered prancing around.
Harry smiles at Theo, “No Theo, I am not your master, I am your friend.”
Theo nodded, “yes, he is slave to the Supreme, may he forever reign on us” before taking a small bite of his pie letting out a groan of pleasure as he ate, “this is really good, L.lord Harrison always ate it in front of me”
Sirius shakes his head angrily, “my idiot brother could have been on the right side of this war but no he had to follow the putrid blood rules and date another putrid blood…..to bad it lead to his downfall.”
Harry looked up from making playful faces at Cassiopeia blushing in embarrassment. “Uh...yes, sir!”
As everyone left Harry immediately grabbed the first aid kit and headed over to a softly crying Theo. “Here Theo, let me” Harry spoke softly as he tilted Theo’s head in the opposite direction so the excess water pours out having Theo cry more as it was still hot.
“Draco that is a 3-day journey.”
“Where will you go?” he whispered to the brunette haired boy back.
Cho nodded, “Sweet Morgana, I know if I fail my practical it’s on the damn putrid-bloods for just being annoying and all whiny”
“AND ICECREAM!” the black haired boy yelled.
“Umm….” Harry trailed off staring at the girl, “Do you think you can make me a nice dinner for two to go please?” He asked with a gentle tone surprised at how his voice got so tender. Her eyes widened as she looked up. Harry smiled gently to her as she blushed slightly. Harry felt his heart flutter knowing he made her smile. The girl probably was abused by the people here all her life. No one showed her one ounce of kindness, which broke Harry’s heart in how they treated an innocent girl.
Harry climbed his way to the top and when he reached Alecto raised her hand “help us up now Potter.” Harry smirked as he showed the satchel. “Sorry guys, got my hands full.”
“Those muggles are pretty creative for making a card game interesting even if they don’t explode,” Theo comments as he reshuffles the deck. Harry, Draco, and Theo were in Snape’s room. Harry got a message saying to meet him there a couple of hours back, but the Slytherin man has yet to show up.
Draco stared at him shaking his head, “no thank you, I never been outside my tower before, I want to feel everything on my feet.” Draco wiggled his toes in the dirt feeling free for the first time as he placed Pascal on his shoulder. The chameleon wanted to come along on the journey and Draco did not want to stop his only friend from joining. Draco and Harry made their way from the cave. Draco turned around staring at the vines guilt settling in.
“Well, Mr. Potter…”
Harry looked down as he fiddled with his hands, he wasn’t sure what to do or say. He saw how close Bellatrix and Rodolphus were embracing, he realized he needed to leave them alone.
Thanks
Harry let Theo mess around for a couple minutes holding a wand before saying,  “Ok, so hold out the wand with a firm grip.”
It was eerily silent for a couple moments before a voice spoke out. It was the bushy haired girl earlier, “I have a dream…I want to be a librarian at the palace library and teach young minds about this world.”
Lucius glared at Snape, “that was your godson, he degraded.”
followed after.
Harry felt his world halt hearing those words. His mother and godfather were the reasons why children were slaves. Harry couldn’t even fathom why they would do that. His mother, the person who always advocated for others and his godfather who went against his family to do what is right.
“Please don’t call me my lord, call me Harry” Harry said as he rubbed Theo’s thigh comfortingly, “when we are alone of course, I don’t want you to get in trouble”
He rushed out of the library to bump into Fred crashing over a tray of small bread rolls.
“It’s Draco.”
Sirius scorned, “the rat also had to escape with dear little perfect, Narcissa.” Harry felt a pang of sadness in his chest. Narcissa was Draco’s mother. The woman who lied to the Dark Lord, just to see her son again. The woman who was at Hogwarts during the battle, without a wand and wanted by both sides, just so she could see her baby boy again. Harry could only imagine what she is going through now.
“Mother is going to be so disappointed,” Draco whimpered softly, “oh my god what have I done, I am a bad son.,” he cried out. “I have to go back…..” Draco trails off eyeing a large tree with a sturdy branch. “maybe….” He weaves his hair through the branches as he swings himself giggling with glee. “I never want to go back to the tower!!!” He yells out swinging his legs to go faster.
Harry chuckled darkly and nodded, “Yeah...coming here was bit of a shock.”
Harry tickled the small boy he was already falling in love with. “Well Mr. Xavi, when you see the sun I want to take you to the beach.”
Harry dropped his mouth unable to hide his shock.
Harry’s eyes widened at the sight before running up to them, “What is going on?” He asked breathlessly. Poppy looked at him smiling, “oh hey Harrison!” she cheered as Fred came up behind her wrapping his arms around her waist, “Hey Harrison” He mumbled kissing the side of her neck as she giggled.
Harry looked at him, “Who does this Lord Ronald have?”
Harry came back to the table, “I..I’m sorry Theo, I.. I just couldn’t believe my parents would do that” Harry explained, as he helped Nott sit on the chair wiping the tears from the dark blue eyes. “In my world, there were two wars, you see, the first war ended when my mom gave her life for me stepping in front of the killing curse which protected me, and the second one ended when Voldemorts killing curse rebounded and hit him”. Harry sighed as he continued, “basically the only people who were punished was the ones who actively participated in the war, and not the families”.
“I agree with that.” Harry immediately blushed at his words with Snape and Dahlia looking at him with raised eyebrows.
Draco believed in the fairytale ending, even if it happens in 100 years, Harry knew Draco would never lose hope and Harry would be damned if he left this earth without giving Draco his Disney ending. The one that ends with a kiss. Harry, Draco, and Theo binged watched all the Disney movies when Draco could escape from Ron and Harry always looked forward to that, as his heart fluttered every time Draco smiled at the television screen.
Dahlia nodded to Harry who nodded back. Draco and Harry looked at each other, “I’ll miss you Harry, and don’t worry I’ll wack Theo over the head if he comes out of your room.”
“Harrison, Ronald, Hermione Jean” his dad spoke. The voice was like ice. It terrified Harry, “I am glad you could make it.” Harry gulped knowing Dad and Mom would not fly with his ‘parents’. “Mother, Father” Harry said bowing his head slightly as Lily and and James smiled doing the same.
“I get that a lot.”
Harry could see Cedric riding around the pitch trying to spot the snitch as well. Harry glared at the brunette teen, as Cedric smirked. “Scared Potter?” he asked in a sneering tone.
Snape rolled his eyes as he dropped a vile on Dumbledore’s desk, “for the fusty.”
Theo looked at Harry confused, “Detention? What did you do?”
That was news to Harry, he always thought wizards and muggles had the same beliefs. “Um no…” Harry trailed off, considering Hogwarts always celebrated Easter, Christmas, Halloween.
Cedric’s body hit the cushioning part of the ground with a loud thud. Chaos erupted in the air as he sees Amos Diggory run to his son followed by his parents and Madam Pomfrey.
Snape nodded, “I would love to Potter, Eostar is coming up, which is the spring solstice.” Snape smiled, “It is the celebration of fertility, birth, and renewal! Spring is coming, and winter is thawing which means plants and animals will thrive. Eostar’s main concept is growth.”
James let out a scoff of irritation, as he stabbed his fork into the leftover pieces of his salmon, “I swear to Merlin and Morgana when I see that filthy rat, I will personally strangle him with my own bare hands.”
“Now could you please let Harry go so he could take my to see the lights?” Draco asks the crowd.
Theo nodded as he grabbed the tart taking a bite. “I changed my mind, this is the best thing I ever ate.” Harry laughed at Theo’s words, as he took a bite of his own treacle tart as the sweet taste of the cream enamored his mouth.
Harry smiled. He needs to go to the library. Harry made a sharp turn as his cape flung against him. He stopped and did it again laughing to himself.
“Lady Ginerva perhaps?” Lavender said smirking, “She is gorgeous, Harrison, consider yourself lucky”
Dahlia stared at Harry her eyes narrowing at him before speaking, “I have news from Regulus.”
, my people will come for all of us.” The way Tom spoke, with such defiance and nerve shocked Harry. He didn’t expect the Dark Lord to become a fighter for the good. In the couple minutes he met with Tom, he gained a huge amount of respect.
As Harry turned to leave, Narcissa gently grabbed Harry’s arm, “please take care of my son?” she begged.
----------
“You’re a legilimens?” Harry questioned to Snape seemed to narrow his eyes even more.
“Sweet Merlin Harrison, I really think you should visit Madam Pomfrey, it seems to me you forgot everything with your little train head bump,” Neville spoke out as Harry bristled.
Theo slowly grabbed the wand, adjusting his grip, smiling. “Wow.” Theo’s smile got bigger, “it feels good to hold one...right.”
Harry heard a soft meow. A small calico kitten jumped to the couch as it nuzzled her face within Draco’s hand. The blonde smiled softly at the gentle creature petting it softly. “Hello Cassiopeia,” Draco cooed. The kitten purred in delight at Draco’s hand as she curled up on his lap. “Such a pretty kitty,” Draco dotted on the small calico who seemed to understand and enjoy the praise.
“I’m sure you do Severus,” Lily comments as she, Alice, Frank, Sirius, and Remus turn to leave with her. “Harrison dear? Are you coming?”
Draco stares at Bellatrix with wide eyes as his mouth is opened softly. “I just…I….I just want to experience things,” Draco says softly.
They all looked at each other grumbling before reluctantly cutting the ropes.
Snape looked around at the group with piercing eyes, “I see...well then your fusty should be punished no?” Harry held back a whimper thinking that Snape wouldn’t punish a slave....but then again, McGonagall has a slave and uses him for transfiguration purposes even though he strictly remembered her words, ‘we don’t transfigure students for punishment’.
Harry made a face of disgust as he heard a voice behind him, “I know right, imagine how I feel, my little sister and best friend together”, Neville spoke out shuddering. Harry looked at him. Neville looked confident. The way he spoke, the way he held himself, nothing like the Neville he knew, shy, timid yet willing to show courage to do what is right.
“Some people here will not trust you, but they are good people Harry. You can earn their trust with time.”
“Well Remus, anyone would be lucky to have you.” Draco responds as he rushes to give him a hug. He feels Remus stiffen before relaxing slightly returning the favor.
“Moving on,” Dahlia retorted. “We are tired, Severus. We are all hungry, hurting, cramped. Our children are fucking slaves! We want to attack now and by the blessings of Merlin and Morgana we may win or may we join them in The Summerland.”
Draco chuckles at the antics of the twins (at least he thinks they are, he isn’t too sure yet). “What about you….” He gestures to the red haired girl.
Draco thinks for a moment rubbing his chin before letting out a cheeky smirk, “how about liber-tea?” Harry had to hold his mouth from laughing out loud at the blonde’s joke, as Snape turns around giving a glare but Harry saw a smirk on Snape’s lip upward, almost as it seems he is trying not to laugh.
Harry scrunched up his face, he knew Snape would probably figure out who he is sooner or later, “yes...but…”
“A true Gryffindor at heart.” Regulus commented.
In the room stood a big round table. Albus Dumbledore sat in a throne like chair. There next to him sat a mirror image of himself and a beautiful red haired woman he only seen in pictures. His mom and dad were sitting right there. Harry felt like he could cry.
Harry’s heart swelled with glee at hearing Draco’s words, he swears to Merlin that the astronauts from space could have seen Harry’s big smile.
“Isn’t he pretty Harry?” Dumbledore’s voice broke his thoughts, “I mean I always had a thing for taking down evil dark lords and making them mine.” he growled at Tom, who simply glared back refusing to acknowledge the advances.
“It was the fusty’s fault Professor,” Fred stated pointing to Draco. Harry held back a growl of protest as he clenched his fists. Draco was still lying on the ground in a fetal position, sobbing quietly to himself.
Harry, Hermione Jean, and Ginvera were waiting outside the hospital wing. Ronald and the Hufflepuff team went inside to see if Cedric was ok.
“Get ready fusty, we got a class” Hermione Jean spoke kicking her leg. Daphne nodded as she quickly woke up the Theo and Pansy, whispering something in their ear. Pansy quickly shot up running out of the classroom, Daphne swiftly behind.
“Try the treacle tart, Theo, that’s my favorite,” Harry said to get his mind off his thoughts. He just knew he will do whatever it takes to help all of them. But he just doesn’t know how.
Hermione Jean shook her head, “Yes many of us complained we had to share a train with those little fusties, so they accorded us and is making them come another way to school”. Hermione Jean replied.
Amycus and Alecto looked at each other before staring back at him with a stony expression. Harry huffed as he handed them the satchel.
Harry grunts in fake sympathy as he enters the classroom sitting in the front where Theo told him earlier.
Harry tried his hardest not to vomit at the thought of dating Ginerva. “Yes, I love her very much Fred, you honestly have no idea...like how much you love Poppy.” Harry winced at his words. He hated Ginerva and he absolutely did not love her like, Fred’s disgusting love for Poppy.
“You are a coward! How can you let them torture Draco like that? Starve him, abuse him, practice dangerous spells, ridicule him.” Dahlia hissed out, “what’s worse is, they show Draco one...ONE ounce of kindness and he thinks they changed and will help him until they humiliate and torment him in front of everyone. And it happens again and again and again.”
“Potter, I will do anything for my family. My husband, my baby sister, my brothers-in-law, my cousin, my godson and my nephew, do you understand?” Bellatrix intimidated, “I will kill for them, protect them and give my life for them.”
“Chocolate frogs?” Harry blurted out. No. “Draconis?” No. Just then Harry hears a small voice, “My lord?” Harry turned to see Theodore Nott, standing there fiddling with his hands. Harry shook his head regaining his voice hoping to sound like Harrison, “What is it?” Theodore shook as he took a deep breath, “um….you do..you have your own quarters you know…” Nott trailed off.
“Harry, we are not allowed in the Potions Lab, so you will be on your own” Theo whispered in his ear.
The man in front of him was Gregory Goyle. He didn’t look bulky like he did when he and Crabbe seemed to be Draco’s bodyguard. Goyle didn’t look sour-faced and intimidating. But a scrawny man, with red skin - probably from the hot tea when he was the teacup -, with a hollow face and a sad expression. Despite what he knew about the other Goyle in his world, his heart reached out to the man in front of him.
Harry looks at him aghast, “what do you want you beautiful angel? Please I’ll give anything.”
Draco smiled at the girl relaxing slightly, “I…I love to read.” Hermione smiled back at him before Ron comments, “I want to be a gladiator, famous all around the kingdom!”
A soft meow was heard. Both Harry and Severus turned to the noise, shocked to see Cassiopeia wandering around.  Harry quickly ran to the kitten who was sniffing something in the corner and picked her up causing her to meow again softly. Harry placed her in the inside pocket of his robe as he felt her move around.
Harry muttered a quiet spell on the books making it lighter for her to carry as he could see her face brighten with surprise. Harry winks at her before nodding to Theo who is helping Draco to his feet.
Harry gave a fake smile, “If you will excuse me, ladies, I have to go to the courtyard”
“So Harrison, did you practice the gurses yet?” Fred asked as he sat on the couch kicking his feet on the table.
Harry ran as fast as he could looking around the forest in something he could hide in as he could hear the captain of the guards, Sirius Black on the royal horse, Maximus, who Harry strongly believes has it out for him, trailing after.
“Where are we going?” Harry asked as he noticed they started to walk in a dusty and dark hall.
Harry chuckled, “bye bye Xavi!”
Narcissa stared softly at Harry, “Ok, Severus…We trust you.”
----------
“So...Harry, if you are here then where is Lord Harrison?” Theo asks. “I mean your body is not here, but your conscious is, so where is Lord Harrison’s conscious? Is he in your body? Is it repressed in his own body and your conscious is taking the wheel? And what is happening with your body in your world?” Theo contemplates out loud.
Bellatrix sang as the flower glowed golden restoring the jealous sister's beauty. Suddenly she heard palace guards coming closer, she quickly covered the flower and fled but the bottom of her hood got caught in the wooden stems and flung the cover off. With that, the guards spotted the magical flower as they carefully lifted it up to give to the queen.
Dahlia bristled as she glared at Harry. Her fiery red hair seemed to match her fiery personality.
“What is it to you, my lord?” Snape mocked.
“This is going to sting a bit Theo,” Harry said as he dabbed a cloth with alcohol on it to the carved cut. Theo winced slightly at the sting as he bit his lip closing his eyes. Harry started to rub the cut trying to clean out the dirt and dried blood from getting it more infected. “W..why didn’t you go to Madam Pomphrey?” Harry dared to ask.
“Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy is it ok if I can take your picture?” Harry asked his voice shaking slightly.
Theo chuckled at Harry’s attempt to get Draco to eat before setting a hand on the blonde, “it is ok Dray, remember what I told you about Harry, he is not Harrison”.
“I will,” Harry responded smiling at the passage.
Theo came in front of him and catches his eyes. Harry mouths ‘I’m sorry’ to him as Theo gives a small nod in acknowledgment his body shaking as he sits down. Harry could see Draco in front of Ronald, who seems to be teasing the poor blonde by saying made-up spells, laughing every time Draco flinches. Harry pushes down his anger and focuses on Theo, thinking to himself, do it once and do it right.
“Right. Ok. Yeah.” Harry murmured, nodding awkwardly. “Good.”
"Do I?" Harry murmured, momentarily flashing back to the graveyard with Voldemort.
"We won't forget the people who help us get started, mate." Fred shook his head.
“Blaise was only a threat to Viktor because he was strong enough to protect you. He’s not a threat to me because I’m not a threat to you.” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear. “Adjust the wards to let him in and then Pansy can bring him back.”
Harry rolled his eyes and checked for the other man’s reaction.
"You want to stay over, hmm?" The brunette leaned his cheek down lightly onto Draco's head. "Great idea."
Draco’s eyes lit up. “Really?”
"I see. That's very thoughtful, Mr. Malfoy. If Lord Potter agrees..." She looked at Harry, who nodded. "I will let the other professors know."
He looked methodically for the snitch, as he’d done before...high and low...near and far... He flew in circular patterns and figure eights. Viktor was once again following him closely but he didn’t seem to notice the glint of gold coming from below the left goal post on the opposite side of the pitch. Harry made a quick decision and dove into a Wronski Feint.
"It almost looked like a horse." Harry shook his head before turning to peer beneath the waves. “But it was blue.”
"Of course I did." Pansy pouted. "It's not my fault you two took so long."
"Do you think you could?" Harry mumbled, slowly blinking his eyes. "Love me, I mean... I know it’s hard because not many people have tried and most of the ones who did try died in the war."
“Grandpa will meet you there, sweetling.” Draco was happy that his daughter was so fond of his father. Except for Harry’s eyes, she was a mini replica of him at that age so she would cheer Lucius up if he ever missed Draco’s presence. “They’ll stay with my parents for a few days before we join them on Christmas Eve.”
"We've got your back and it's nice knowing you've got ours but the changes are piling up too fast." Ron's gruff voice rang with frustration and regret. "I'm not abandoning you. I'm just saying that I don't know how we fit anymore. I need time to figure it out."
"That would be kind of you, Headmaster, but you are needed here. My cousin isn't your student nor is he your responsibility - in fact, he's a squib." Harry gritted his teeth in frustration. "You being who you are, you should know better than anyone that, due to his recent admission to the wizarding world, there are rules in place commanding that he's not to have any direct contact with Hogwarts' headmaster."
“Those will go to my son when he’s born,” Draco nodded in perfect understanding, so Harry summoned a self-inking quill and signed the dotted line before handing the quill and papers to Draco.
Harry’s mouth was watering as he leaned in and licked Draco’s collarbone a few times. He shook some salt over the moist area and poured himself a shot before turning to see that the blond already held a slice of lime. He approached just as slowly as Draco had done and licked up the salt before downing the shot and biting into the lime. Draco gave a slightly needy whine as Harry moved away but soon pulled his thoughts back to the moment. “You’re still alright?”
"Dinki can be doing that, Master Harry," Dinki popped in and snapped her fingers, sending all of their things into the proper drawers or into the closet as necessary.
Sirius made a shoo motion. "Moony's with the twins and Dudley went back to Potter Grove. He wanted to read up on some things. Arthur gave him a list of books that will help him acclimate to being a squib in the wizarding world."
“More frustration for Molly then, hey?” The dark skinned man chuckled as Harry gasped for air.
Harry smiled back. "The little things. Throwing mud at you at the Shrieking Shack in third year. Enjoying the moment when Hermione punched you. Throwing my patronus at you and your cronies when you dressed up as dementors to scare me." He paused as he approached the next topic. "I'm not apologizing for watching you throughout sixth year. I knew you were up to something and nobody would believe me except Dumbledore but he knew what it was you were doing and ignored it. One of the things I want to apologize for is what happened in Myrtle's bathroom...I'm so..."
“Perhaps it has something to do with who is siring the child, Luc. Perhaps that old tale your father told you simply meant that a Malfoy couldn’t sire a girl…” Narcissa smirked.
When Harry saw the cover of the book, he gasped, “Draco where did you get that?”
Draco returned a moment later and approached slowly. “Father has gone and Luna will join Ginevra because, apparently, she brought something back for her to their room.”
Bealush smiled a toothy grin.  "Perhaps, young Potter, your line has been wronged. Perhaps you are meant to get revenge on your enemies."
“The green of her eyes is just amazing when combined with her pale blonde hair, don’t you think, Luc?” Narcissa leaned down to tap the child’s nose.
Harry gritted his teeth but politely accepted the news with a nod.
“I love this, Dragon. I love that I can work you up so much that you’ll beg and plead for more.” Harry withdrew from Draco’s body only to sink back in a moment later. He pressed Draco’s bound hands against his back and whispered, “Don’t forget…you asked for this, my dragon.”
“All sorts... to begin with, the Weasley family means a lot to me, Lucius.” Harry said solemnly. “You used them to get a dark artifact into the school.”
Harry looked skeptical. "Muggle beer?"
When Draco got back to the apartment at the end of classes that day, Harry was seated on the sofa, looking disappointed.
Draco stared up at his father as if he knew what the older man was thinking.
“The crest was a bit on the feminine side when I found it, Harry, so I sent it to the jeweler who did our wedding bands,” Draco explained. “He transfigured the setting and replaced the jewels with our birthstones, as well as selling me a masculine chain to put it on.”
We, at the Ministry, thank you profusely for your abundantly prolific services during the war.
Caelum reached for Harry’s face and patted his father’s cheek. He smiled big and toothlessly as he babbled incoherently.
He started to chatter about their friends and she just smiled and commented on his ideas until their food was gone.
“If you get a chance to go back, I’d like to know that, please.” Harry murmured absently. “Thanks for bringing these. I need to... I need to think. I’ll see you later.”
Over the past few days, the twins had taken more than ‘a few steps’. They’d gotten used to walking a few steps and plopping down on their little bottoms before getting back up and doing it again. It still took a while to cross the room but they got where they wanted to go.
Lucius seemed disgruntled.
“He indicated to me that he intends to clue us in at the meeting.” Draco advised softly.
Harry frowned. “I think they said accidental magic could start anywhere from five to eight months. Why?”
“The healer tried everything possible to save her and remove the child.” Rax gripped his sister’s hand. “There was too much blood…”
“Or bedtime stories with Daddy…” Gregory Goyle whispered in horror at the thought that his daughter would outgrow him.
Harry just sat for a moment, thinking about this request. It wasn’t unreasonable and Harry had just offended the man so some recompense was owed him. Finally he nodded. “So what do you suggest?”
“Harry? You here?” Hermione called from the floo room.
Draco’s jaw started to drop but he caught himself. “Really?”
Draco moaned at the implication of those words. "Should I ward the room, Harry?"
“Harry, Draco… Your first gift is Dinki.” Narcissa announced. “Harry, I know you have the elf from the Black family’s London residence but he’s very old and – from what I’ve heard – not a little insane. Lucius and I want you and Draco to start your married lives with a happy, healthy…experienced...but also pleasant house elf. She knows – among other things – how to care for children so she’ll be able to assist with the twins when they arrive.”
Draco smirked but quickly lost all humor. “You’ve been quiet for the last few weeks, Harry. You said we’d talk. You said we’d be a solid couple – fighting the daily battles and being there for each other. You vowed to take care of me but my vows said that too. Just because I’m pregnant doesn’t let me off the hook, you know…and I had a moment today when I thought maybe I’d failed you…”
Sighing, Lucius took a seat on the edge of the bed beside his son and looked at both Harry and Draco. “I know I place a lot of importance on certain traditions…There’s a reason for that.”
"How do you know anything is wrong?" Harry asked edging around the question. "Maybe I just wanted to visit..."
Harry looked at the post and saw the stone. He then looked at the house where a girl in denim overalls was clearly standing on one hand with her pale blonde hair pooling on the floor around her head. Inspecting the stone closely, he saw a wire wrapped around it and the post. He’d thought it was decorative. He considered his options while making a show of looking the device over but a giggle sounded as he did.
Luna sighed sadly. "Do you really think the nargles were just people who don't like me?"
"Such a horrible thing - to take apart your soul." Harry looked at the Headmaster sadly.
Harry’s smirk widened to a grin as Draco blushed again and they both recalled what that remark had led to. “You must have seer blood.”
"Lord Potter, you're supposed to be in Charms class." Percy burst into the office and looked around, oblivious to the tension he'd disrupted. "Professor Flitwick sent Ron looking for you and Malfoy."
“I want to go shopping, Harry! It's nearly Christmas and we need to buy gifts for my parents as well as our friends.” Draco told Harry at breakfast on the last day of classes before the trip home. “I don’t even have anything for you yet!”
She was officially Cedric's girlfriend after the Yule Ball and that was the main reason that Harry had evaluated his feelings about his dating preferences. That and his behavior toward his date from that night. Parvati Patil and her twin sister were pretty girls. If he was straight or bisexual, he probably wouldn't have ignored her the way he did.
"I'll join you and that way she'll be eased into the Malfoy experience." Draco squeezed his hand before letting go to allow Harry to write a reply.
“I’ve heard of the Quibbler, Sir. It’s nice to meet you.” Harry nodded respectfully to his host. "Please call me Harry."
Harry smiled at them and took a deep breath to try and calm his boyfriend's fears. "Draco, I don't know what the future holds for us, but I do know that I already feel more for you than when we first started seeing each other."
Draco’s eyelids fluttered closed as he nodded. When he opened them again, Draco bit his lip and smirked at Harry’s friend as he made his way to the bedroom they’d been given. He disrobed before silencing and warding the room against anyone except Harry entering before deciding to surprise his husband.
Harry chuckled as she bustled out the door and turned to Dobby. "In half an hour, I'd like you, Ziva, and Roody to move these plants very carefully to the greenhouse for the professor.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I agree that it is best for us to refrain from hiding this – it will become public knowledge soon enough." The blond nodded his acceptance and smoothed his robes as he sat after calling his things to follow him. "Well, this is the letter telling me I've been chosen by you. I've signed and now I just have to owl it back to the proper office, but I thought you'd like to see it."
“The promise rings are meant to represent the person and their partner.” Draco pointed out as he gently took it out of the box. “As you can see, my namesake is represented by the silver scales and black diamond scales surrounded by gold is the person I love.”
"She's missing several items already. She says nargles pranked her." Harry glared when they smirked. "I say bullies and thieves stole her things."
"Shit. You alright, Harry?" Dudley asked, wincing in sympathy.
"Are you even listening to me?" Harry asked in a strangely anxious tone which made Draco slam back to the present and focus.
"Mind?" Draco stared at him. "Italian food is my favorite. As a matter of fact, after school, I plan to tour the Mediterranean."
“I am asking about the part where you were told that when we’re alone or with only Astoria you wouldn’t be allowed clothing,” Harry glared at the blond.
Draco frowned at him. “How will you see the movie?”
A female voice shouted. “Harry? Are you home?”
The brunette took a deep breath and spoke with caution. “I’m saying – sir – that Potter is no longer my only name…”
When they arrived at home, Draco looked relaxed and happy. Harry was smiling and seemed peaceful.
"Arthur has suggested bringing Bill and Charlie in to replace us." Remus chimed in.
“Of course, Cuz! We’d never leave you out, right Harry?” Teddy had a too-wide grin as he took a bite of his sandwich. “What’s a day of flying without you, Draco?”
He received another enthusiastic nod.
“Thank you, Harry...It happens when they – the Slytherin students – decide to snub one of their numbers. They deliberately leave large gaps at the dining table during meals. When the snub-ee gets close to one of those gaps, the students on either side of said gap pick up their meals and slide down the bench to block him or her from sitting.” Draco explained as he started to pull a plate of chocolate cake toward him. “It’s meant to punish someone who’s done something disgraceful, or rather – something that’s been deemed disgraceful by their opinions.”
Draco closed his eyes and followed along step by step. “Harry, who taught you to dance? How did you get so much better between Fourth Year and our wedding?”
Harry sighed and looked at all of his fellow Gryffindors as the food began to appear. A glance at the Slytherin table told Harry that Draco had gotten his mail and the return letter from the ministry was in it because he was staring back. He waved at the other boy – he wouldn't really think of himself or Draco as men until they were married.
"They're just a couple of interesting items that your maternal grandfather tried to acquire a few decades ago and one that I just think your mother will enjoy." Lucius answered vaguely.
“Looks like chicken and stuffing with lots of vegetables.” Harry grinned.
Harry was unsurprised to see the deep red bloom in his hand. He’d even expected it. He’d desired and been fond of Draco for weeks - if not months – before the ceremony and he’d felt the deepening of that fondness in the days since. He quickly braced himself to see a pink or orange colored rose in Draco’s hand – not yet daring to hope it would be as red as his own.
“Please take Lord Potter to his rooms.” She requested. “I’ll be up in a while to confer with him.”
The blond nodded absently.
Harry was proud of his cousin. He didn’t think the other boy would appreciate the sentiment so he kept it to himself but the old Dudley would’ve put his assignments off to the latest point he could and Harry knew this was a big change in his cousin. Another big change was his waistline! Dudley had lost some weight and while he wasn’t sporting a six- pack of abs, it was definitely a vast improvement. "I'll have some things to do too, Dudley."
“You didn’t see his face, Mione. He wanted to pummel Draco. My presence was the only thing stopping him.” Harry’s despairing tone chilled his friends. “I don’t think he’ll stop next time.”
Draco turned to Blaise. "I think we should start at the entrance. Slytherin might've been sneaky and put it outside the common room."
“Dragon!” Harry said softly as he tightened his grip on Draco. “I’m here, baby, I’m here!”
The blonds both quickly shook their heads and Draco hurried to calm him. “No, Harry! Nothing like that!”
“I know...I’m sorry, Harry.” Draco said softly, looking up at Harry.
“I don’t mind helping you...” Harry mumbled awkwardly although the floo room was completely empty.
“What is it Blaise?” The blond looked up from his book.
Harry just whispered. “I will, love. I’m not going anywhere...”
“I remember you saying something like that to me, once… Lucius,” Narcissa whispered as she retook her seat; seeing that her son-in-law had things in hand.
"Between the three of us, we can give you fifteen hundred galleons to start the business off." Sirius suggested. He watched their faces as they thought it over.
The blond Hufflepuff took a moment to decide but finally he took out his wand and made the oath.
"I'll go see." Harry said with a sigh and made his way up close to the register. When he got there, the sight he beheld woke him like a slap to the face. He'd recognize that blond hair and seeker's built body anywhere. He allowed himself to look the other man over since he didn't appear to have noticed Harry.
"Ok." Harry stared at Draco. "I was not expecting that. Which night would it have been?”
“Perhaps they - at least one of them - were more than friends with him?” Blaise offered.
“Draco.” Harry sounded excited to see him so Draco smiled shyly. “Don’t just hover, Draco, come in and sit. Breakfast is in the making but the coffee is done and in the pot.” Harry’s attitude was slowly calming him. “You’re acting strange...”
“Yes, sir; it was wonderful meeting you.” Harry bowed to him.
She looked out the balcony doors and attempted to use the handle to open it until Harry stood up and opened the doors for her.
He tilted the box so everyone could see. “Brooms! I’m sure you recall that mine was destroyed during the war. I’d mentioned it to Harry while we were courting and he confessed that his was lost as well.” Draco sniffed clutching Harry’s hand. “You remembered…”
“One mustn’t be crude, dear.” Narcissa had narrowed her eyes at him. “Now...what shall we do about this?”
Harry's thoughts raced. "I suppose it could be an outcropping of the castle that is under an illusion spell but there's a very real possibility that it was crushed by the water and truly ruined."
The sixth level of training in Potions Mastery was all about observing the chemical reactions and interactions, so Al came over on the first day and brewed ten potions. Each on their own was quite safe but when they mixed with each other… Well, from behind a thoroughly shielded window, Draco observed that ‘BOOM’ was a bit of an understatement, but he also learned why each potion would act the way it did. This level was clearly meant to teach him – or rather any student of this subject – what could happen if they randomly experimented.
"See?" Harry grinned suddenly, rushing over to the desk for the mirror. "You're already helping me. I'll get Remus to find us a tutor. I don't know if you remember but he's sort of my uncle."
The next morning Draco’s healer came and performed a few diagnostic spells.
Harry could see the wheels turning in the blond’s head even as they remained in close contact.
“These are our terms,” She smirked. “My sexual interest in men is minimal and he’s not sexually interested in women or any of the men who have been allowed into our bed. Due to Lucius’ knowledge of Draco’s disability, there is a provision in our marriage contract to allow for infidelity on his part, but only if it is in pursuit of the conception of an heir. After said conception of a male child the contract allows for separation and side lovers or even divorce. We plan for the latter. He’s submissive in everything and I’m the opposite, so he’ll need someone – obviously you if this works out – to be in charge or rather in control of him so that plays right into your desires.”
"Now I've missed my window to enjoy breakfast." Harry growled in the direction his cousin had gone off in. "Dobby, can you get me some fruit or something?" Dobby appeared with a plate of fresh fruit from which Harry took an apple and suggested the rest be placed on the desk in the sitting room.
“We haven’t seen you in months. I hope things are alright.” Harry frowned. He liked Daphne’s husband and whenever they had met up he’d always enjoyed their conversations.
Harry shook the skeleton key out of the envelope and into his hand. It was old and made of bronze. There was a bird at one end with his wings outstretched encircling a deep blue sapphire and it carried with it a sense of something about to happen. He stuck the envelope into his pocket but held the key up to show the others before pushing it into the lock.
Harry chuckled. "Alright then. Let's go."
Harry burst out laughing at first but lapsed back into tears.
“Well,” Harry scrambled for something to say. “It’s Christmas! And red is a bright color! It dominates the tree because the decorations are exactly that color. It has nothing to do with Gryffindor, at all.”
Ron’s eyes bugged out at his best friend. “Beautiful? The Great Blond Git?”
“OK Uncle Sevus,” Alexander replied as Harry set him down on the floor. “Bye bye Hawwy!”
Snape lets out a soft sigh as he clasps his hands together, “oh Draco, you would have loved it! it was an intense game,” Snape blurted out, “Italy was leading England to 240-110, and Taylor caught the snitch moments, Draco, just moments before one of Italy's chaser threw the Quaffle into the hoop.” Snape emphasized his words giving a slight smile.
Harry stares at him, “so if I take you to see the lanterns, then you will give me back my satchel?”
Harry could see Theo sitting on his bed eyeing the food. There is no doubt he could smell it from there. He beckoned Theo to come over to sit with him on the ground. “This is for both of us,” he told the scared brunette.
Harry could only imagine what Snape would do.
Harry felt his heart tug. This young child never saw the sun, he never smelt fresh air or ran in the grass as a normal child should. Instead, he was stuck in a cold, gray, cement prison cell. But this was better than being a slave. To think, at Xavi’s age, Draco was ripped from his mother. He never felt parental love and his parents had to go without seeing their child grow up and know their own baby was being tortured.
“Yes sir,” Harry replied as he heard loud cheers coming from the quidditch pitch. He was sure someone made a goal, but he couldn’t tell which team.
Theo’s eyes went wide, “b..but you s…said pumpkin…”
Snape let out a soft sigh shaking his head, “not for months Draco, it has been tough trying to keep contact.”
Alice Longbottom scowled at Dahlia's resistance as she pushed the redhead girl hard in front of her. Harry got a good look at Alice. She didn’t look skinny and frail like he saw her at St. Mungo's, but fit as an Auror should be. Frank Longbottom came right behind her pointing his wand at Dahlia’s back.
“I..its the pumpkin juice you asked for my lord” Theo spoke in a hushed tone.
Theo smiled looking at all the food. “Looks delicious my lo….harry”
Harry stops smiling, “ruffians and thugs you say?” Draco nods enthusiastically. “Well, are you hungry blondie? Cause I got just the place.”
Nott looked at him instead of fear but confusion, “M..my lord? Are you ok?”
Harry nodded to Theo silently thanking him where the office was. Harry was not nervous to meet this Albus Dumbledore. In fact he was excited, he had loads of things to say to this old coot. Oh, the things Harry wished he could say to the old man.
This Cedric looked good. His light blonde hair swept up to the side, with sparkling yet menacing eyes. The menacing look in Cedric’s eyes scared Harry, as he coming to terms with the fact that the nice Hufflepuff, is not so nice in this world. Cedric looked to be holding a leash as he tugged it hard.
Draco smiles when he sees Bellatrix, wild curly black hair, pale skin with sharp eyes, and a perfect smile. “Took you a while dearie” Bellatrix says. Draco frowns looking up at his mother, who then laughs ruffling his hair, “I’m just kidding my flower, now get the brush.”
Theo silently watched Harry brew the potion in awe. Harry smiled to himself at the watchful eye of his friend. “Have you ever brewed a potion before?” Harry asked, casting the final enchantments with his wand.
“Golden curses?” George spoke up, “remember Harrison?” Harry looked at him nodding trying to rack his brain for the term ‘Golden Curses’.
“Tell me, Potter, how would you like it, if someone came into your home and forced you to celebrate some other tradition rather than your own?” Snape asked. “And if you didn’t you were accused of being a purist?”
“Let’s go back to my room and drop her off,” Severus commented as Harry followed. “Then we could talk.”
Harry chuckled softly, the Peter in his world was a traitor to his friends and family, but the Peter in this world was also a traitor to them but for the right reasons. Harry knew his head was going to explode.
“Sir? About the Knights.” Harry asked. He had so many questions after meeting them and he wanted to know more about their plans to finally win this war.
Ronald nodded, “Thank you Joseph, you may go”. Joseph bowed again and left. Ronald rolled his eyes, “where is my damn fusty” he mumbled to himself as he got up from the table. Harry followed him as Hermione
Theo sat down next to Harry as he took a bite of the chicken pot pie, his eyes widening with delight. “This is delicious!” He exclaimed as he took another bite giggling in delight at the abundance of flavors coursing in his mouth. “This is the best food in the entire planet”
“Coming mother!” He yells back as he runs to the little window throwing his hair down to pull up Bellatrix.
Harry nodded in understanding, “I see what you’re saying, but what would have switched our conscious? Do you think an accidental rift opened up, there could have been a glitch in the systemic universe creating an anomaly in which that brief second switched our conscious!”
“Bless you,” he says to the guard, who turns around in shock yelling. But by then he was already being pulled up by his companions and twins Amycus and Alecto.
Harry moaned out in pain as he felt his mind being prodded in my Snape for what felt like an eternity. Snape loosened his grip on Harry letting him to the ground, his dark eyes widened with shock and mouth slightly open. Snape closed his eyes as he muttered softly to himself analyzing what he just saw. Snape opened his eyes and stared at Harry without any emotion.
The Queen was healed and gave birth to a beautiful baby boy named Draco. His eyes were a beautiful shade of silver as it sparkled with happiness. He was a perfect mix of his father and mother with soft platinum hair and a smile that can light up the room. To celebrate the young prince’s birthday, the King and Queen lit up lanterns to the night sky, as all the citizens in the kingdom followed.
“Harrison, what in the blood hell is Ron, it’s Ronald, do you remember?” This Ronald replied. Harry nodded, “um….yeah, I do remember…..” Harry trailed off. Inside of the train compartment looked regal. The chairs were soft and plush and bright. There was a nice wooden table in front with tons of delicious looking food readily available.
Andromeda face contorted with anger, which made her look like a hippopotamus. Harry silently prayed to all the hippopotamuses saying how sorry he was for comparing them to this ugly witch.
Harry flinched at Snape’s tone, “Unlike in your world, we haven’t forgotten Salem, in which nearly half the wizarding population was burned at the stake. Those filthy muggles burned 6-year-old girls at the stake!” Snape continued angrily. “Besides, muggle-borns get their education at Hogwarts, which is rendered worthless in the muggle world, what use do they have to go there?”
“Remus, now be nice” Harry interjects, just as Remus pulls out a knife holding it to Harry’s throat.
“Sweet Morgana Harrison, why are you so jumpy?” Ronald’s voice entered his ears, as Harry glares at him.
Harry gulped, “I..I’m sorry, I haven’t thought about it like that.”
Hermione Jean came next followed by Poppy, Ginny, Seamus, Dean, Luna, Fred and George. “Hiya Harrison!” Fred cheered. Harry smiled, he missed the twins. Just then George grabbed Theo by the hair pulling it hard, “What fusty?” He asked, “no manners?” He pushed Theo to the ground as Theo looked up his eyes in fear, “Forgive me my Lords and Ladies, can I offer you anything?”
Harry silently listened to the conversation with his family. The dark haired boy knew he needed to be a Slytherin, be cunning and resourceful in order to help the slaves.
As he continued to run from the guards, hearing a loud “POTTER”.
(And for grammar I'll try to look over it again to make sure it's all good! let me know if there are any corrections to be made!)
Snape looked at him baffled. He wouldn’t have expected Lord Harrison to say this. Snape knew something was extremely wrong if someone prominent as Lord Harrison said they will lower their shields. Snape knew faking a memory was impossible and could not be done due to the fact the cognitive memory part of the brain releases different chemicals than the imaginative part.
“Because they know I will be ‘protected’ by Sirius as he will use me to get his brother out,” Dahlia said.
Harry couldn’t stand the look on his face, “ok guys, clearly The…o…I mean f..fusty as learned his lesson, so just let it be?” He asked to the shocked faces in the room.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at the sight. He never saw the blonde so gentle to another creature. Harry always found it adorable when he sees other people, especially men, have a soft spot for defenseless and cute creatures.
----------
Harry held back a glare and forced himself to smile “Yeah...hilarious” he lied. He made a mental note later to create healing potions for the distressed
“Hey what’s your dream Potter,” a voice calls from the crowd. Draco instantly perks up eager to hear this.
“Yeah, I think I will be fine Longbottom,” Harry said as he couldn't help adding bitterness to his voice.
“Touch me again, and you will regret it” Harry growls at his ‘friend’ as Ronald’s eyes widen in surprise and a hint of fear. Harry smirks at fear in his eyes thinking to himself on how he is now knowing how it feels to know fear someone.
“Fruit”
Ginerva came up to him wiping the tears brimming his eyes. “It’s ok Harrison,” she says softly. “They know it was an accident.”  Harry nodded thinking to himself, it was not his fault. It was just an accident. Seekers try to throw each other off all the time.
“This is pretty soft hair Fred, what do ya think?” A red haired person told another person who looked exactly like him. “I agree George, so soft” Fred says as he takes the hair to his face. “Could make a pretty penny selling this for clothes.”
“W..what’s in there?” Harry asked.
“Draco is….Draco is with the Weasley boy.” Snape respond as he rubbed his forehead, “the students are practicing for exams before spring break.”
“I gave you chamomile,” Snape said as he sat next to Draco, giving a soft pet to the sleeping kitten.
Harry smiled softly, “congratulations Theo! Now try again, this time really envision it….like you are lighting up a dark cave deep in the ocean waters.”
“I know Ma’m, but I want to earn their trust as well as yours.”
Draco bites his lip sniffling softly, sniffles softly, “yes mother…..I said know what I want for my birthday now.”
Harry stifled in understanding. Draco liked a boy. Draco had a crush on a boy. Draco is….gay? Harry never paid attention to boys, he was always taught to marry a nice girl and have a family. But two men together can’t have a family right? Thoughts flew around Harry’s head in confusion. Harry knew this world will probably give him a migraine for life.
Draco smiled at Harry’s words before taking a bite of his pizza, eyes widening in delight as it melts in his mouth enhancing his tongue with delicious cheese, a tasty sauce with a perfect blend of herbal spices and a garlicky taste to the crust.
Harry chuckled at her words "uh...yeah" Before a loud clearing of a throat by Professor Lupin interrupted their conversation.
“Are you sure he even is competent?”
. He is usually good at playing Quidditch safely for himself and others. He shouldn’t have let Cedric’s taunts get to him. Even when Malfoy was being a brat to him, Harry still made sure to play it safe. Harry lost his temper and it seriously injured someone, and that scared him.
Theo smirks back at Harry, and Harry was sure he could have seen Snape’s lip twitch upward slightly.
Harry looked at Draco with narrow eyes wondering why the blonde was shaking so much. Why was Draco afraid of his mother.
Harry nodded giving Draco a bone-crushing hug, burying his face into Draco’s neck inhaling his scent. “Always”
The crowd continued to cheer at their victory over the Knights and they actually captured one of the prominent members of the group.
“We usually just have plain bread. The butter is a luxury,” the younger Black spoke softly to Harry. Compared to Dahlia his fiance, who was feisty, loud, and proud. Regulus seemed calm, cool and collected. They fit each other perfectly.
Dahlia nodded as she hugged Severus who hugged her back. “Stay safe.” Severus nodded to the red-haired witch before bending down to hug Draco.
“And I thank them for that every day” Poppy spoke out. “I think about the older brother I could have had, Mother miscarried him during the war” Poppy continued as she glared at Draco who continued to look on the ground not wanting to hold her gaze. “It’s all their fault” she spoke with venom.
When Draco wasn’t with Harry and was with Ronald, Harry’s heart broke knowing the suffering he was going through. Theo often had to comfort him saying, “Draco is used to it”. That made Harry’s heartbreak, even more, none of these children had to be used to torture.
“It is an electronic communication device muggles use,” Harry replied chuckling, “no fire calling or patronuses for muggles.”
“How sir?” Harry asked confused.
“Fine Harrison, but we will be in the courtyard practicing our curses” Hermione Jean said. “Let’s go fusty”
Harry lets out a frustrated groan, “this is going to take a while,” he mutters o himself as he leans on the tree watching Draco go back and forth between disappointing his mother and finally being free.
Snape sighed mournfully as he glanced at Dahlia’s eyes, “I pray to Merlin and Morgana they watch over every single one of them of every second of every day.”
“More than anything,” Severus said, “ I trust him, Bella.”
Snape rolled his eyes, “watch your tongue Potter.”
“Professor Lupin!” Hermione Jean yelled as she waved the professor over cutting off Neville. Harry immediately turned his attention to Remus. He still had scars on his face, but he didn’t look kind and mellow when he first met him on the train. He looked stone faced as he walked over to them.
“But that’s the funny thing about birthdays, they happen every year and I was hoping….,” he gets cut off by Bellatrix, “you know what I see in this mirror Draco?” She gestures to the vanity in front of them. “I see a young beautiful, confident person,” Draco smiles softly straightening a little bit, “oh you’re here too,” his mother laughs. Draco looks down at his hands feeling defeated.
Theo nodding following Harry’s words, “I am going to teach you Lumos, which will make a bright light at the tip of the wand.
“I read his mind.”
Narcissa smiled at him, beckoning him to come over while Lucius just grumbled softly to her. Lucius was one of the people who did not trust him and refused to talk with Harry but had to reconsider as he was forced by Narcissa and Severus.
Draco ties the man up with his hair waiting for him to wake up. The first thing the man says is “hair” Draco slowly walks out with the frying pan in his hand.
“Tom,” Dumbledore acknowledged as his tea was being poured. Harry had to stop himself from falling off the chair. Tom. Harry knew that name. He knows the name of a person who marked him since birth. The name of the man he defeated...killed. This man right here was the Dark Lord, Lord Voldemort himself...looking like a normal young human, and this baffled Harry.
“Hermione Jean, what would I do without you” he sighed.
“I don’t doubt that,” Snape replied pursing his lips.
“I know Severus.”
Pascal stares at Draco not amused as he glares at the little animal. “Fine. But I’m blaming you if something goes wrong.”
“Awwww, the little fusty is getting all sad,” Luna teased tossing the picture to George who imitated Draco’s teary-eyed face laughing. George tossed the picture to Dean. Each time Draco got up to grab the picture, he was roughly pushed back to the ground.
Theo nodded, “Well first, the duo worlds...universes….or whatever, that is confusing. And no matter how you explain it, I will always be confused.” Theo retorted to Harry who agreed silently, “But yes, it is very strange how you are in Lord Harrison’s body, it’s like your conscious is here and Lord Harrison’s conscious is gone.”
Harry shook his head, “no mother, Professor Snape is helping me with my potions homework.”
Dumbledore begins to talk as Harry zones out,
“Sterling, Fusties?” Harry couldn’t help but ask. They both looked at him with their eyebrows up. “Harrison must have hit his head pretty hard Hermione Jean”, Ronald said laughing. “Brush up on Hogwarts: A History Harrison” Hermione Jean said laughing too.
“And eat lots of ice cream!” Harry yelled out to add to the boy's plan, whose mouth dropped to the floor at the mention of ice cream.”
Harry looked at Snape, love is what this man can do. His love for Lily turned him to be a spy for the order and now this Snape’s love for Draco turned him to be a spy for the Knights. Harry smiled, the parallels between these two potion professors is uncanny.
Harry looked at the blonde who was red in the face with puffy eyes. He felt the urge to comfort the blonde. Harry wouldn’t know what to do if the only picture he had of his parents was destroyed so cruelly.
as he made his way to the library.
“It’s ok Dragon,” Snape says, rubbing Draco’s back. “You will see them again, and you will take a ton of more pictures.” Snape comforts softly.
Draco, Harry and Theo looked at each  other before looking back at Severus, “What happened?” Theo finally asked.
“Theo, I think I know what happened to me but I don’t know how,” Harry gulped.
“Orange Juice”
“Believe it, Theo, you are a wizard after all,” Harry exclaimed with joy feeling sparks of euphoria enlight within him. Harry looks back at his potion which is finally the right color. “I think the potion is ready Theo, are you ready to drink and share it with your friends?”
“You got it?” Amycus asked. Harry flashes a toothy grin opening the satchel showing a sparkly crown as they make their way to run from the guards.
“I mean, he could be my Prince Charming,” Draco whispered gleefully.
“Oh sweet Merlin, Fred, I am so sorry!” Harry exclaimed as he immediately bent down to help pick the balls up, only to stare at a bare of black leather coated feet. Harry cautiously looked up, to see a pair of brown eyes looking at him.
Severus smiled as he grabbed the rope from Frank. He knelt down to Dahlia’s eye level smirking in her gaze, “I have big plans for this fusty,” he comments simpering at Dahlia’s deadly glare.
“Stop Potter, in the name of the King,” Sirius calls out as Harry turns around sticking his tongue out at him.
“I plan to sir,” Harry said looking straight in the eyes of Regulus Black. “I will earn the trust of everyone here because I earned it, not because of Severus.” Regulus looked shocked at Harry’s words, as the green-eyed boy continued, “even if it means cleaning the floors, giving secrets, and even my life.”
Both twins took turns speaking as they smirked at him. Harry nodded, as they laughed in delight.
Alecto glared at him “satchel first Potter.”
Harry chuckled nervously, “Oh yeah....I remember.” Everyone around him still didn’t look convinced. “I…I can’t forget my own mother teaching us, cause you know we have to remember the war and how we always need to make sure the dark side doesn’t ever rise up again…,” Harry said timidly trailing off, hoping his end words saved him.
Snape shook his head, “no, when I say magic shuts off, I mean it is not controlled and because magic is not controlled it opened up a rift.” Snape took a deep breath, “I’m guessing you and Harrison were both in the same place, in the same compartment and in the same position of the seat when the shutdown happened, so because magic was unstable during that second, it opened up a rift switching the conscious.”
Bellatrix cackled, “Potter...you have a stupid mouth, you speak before thinking, Gryffindor much?”
“Not with Legilimency, brain chemicals are different regarding what the person is thinking.” Harry couldn’t but smile at Snape’s defense of Harry. For someone who hates Harry in this world and his own, the Slytherin man always seemed to secretly have a penchant for Harry and helps him in saving the world...well both worlds.
‘Well, Ginny, I believe you can do it, I was raised alone by my mother and what she taught me was that women can be strong,” Draco responds back. He feels comfortable now as he realized these people aren’t bad as he first thought.
“Students, you have an exam today on brewing strengthening solutions” Professor Snape started writing some notes on the board. “You will brew this by yourself, I hope you know the procedure and the ingredients, good luck”
They all nodded at him still looking slightly unconvinced as Harry put his hands in his pockets. He fumbled his hands around for a bit before “so did you guys just practice crucio?” In order to throw off the uncomfortable silence.
“Don’t feel bad Harry, you were used to a different life,” Regulus spoke sensing the discomfort.
Harry had to pinch himself to stop him from making a gagging noise at her actions as he thinks of an excuse to not spend time with her. "I want to study potion theory by myself"  Ginerva pouted at his words letting him go with the roll of her eyes.
I think he might have a concussion”. Hermione Jean nodded, “Well Harrison, when we get to Hogwarts go to Madam Pomfrey will you?” she spoke with a hard voice that sent shivers down Harry’s spine as he nodded.
Harry felt his heart sink at Draco’s words, “my name is Harry” he says while he positioned Draco’s bones in the correct way before tightly wrapping the medical tape around the arm, trying to make a cast. Draco bites his lip closing his eyes wincing ever so slightly each time Harry finished a wrap around.
Harry was walking down the hall when he felt someone grab his robe and pulled him into a dark corridor. Harry felt himself being slammed hard against the wall, with a forearm tightly pressed to his throat.
“D.draco” Theo said as tears entered his eyes. “m..me and my friends only have each other, my lord, w..we never met our parents, and they just hoard us all into a tiny room when we are not needed”
“I...I’m truly sorry for what you both went through,” Harry said solemnly before getting up to go out.
(I hope this makes sense! I usually get confused when they try to explain things like this in the movies lol)
Harry watched Draco intently as he giggled running around in the grass cheering with joy. “Do you want shoes blondie?” He calls out chuckling.
“I’m still struggling with the cruciatus curse” Poppy spoke out as her head laid on Fred’s lap as he stroked her hair lovingly. Harry’s eyes bulged wondering if he heard Neville’s little sister right.
Harry hears Ronald saying the spell, voicing the U for the spell, as Draco turns into a teacup. Harry hid his impression, on how quickly Ronald did the spell. Usually, his Hermione always helps Ron in pronouncing the correct vowels for the best spell. Thinking of his friends, makes Harry feel homesick, as he definitely misses Ron’s courage to stand up for others, especially those who cannot stand up for themselves. Hermione who is always advocating equal rights for everyone and especially how she will come up with these crazy yet amazing theories to why they were in this world.
“Ummm….mate we got slaves for that….” Fred paused for a second before snapping his fingers. A beaten Draco appeared a couple of minutes later. The blonde was panting as Harry could see sweat drip down his forehead. Harry wondered what the blonde was doing.
----------
Snape sighed as he sat down on the chair his forearms resting on his thighs as he leaned forward slightly clasping his hands. “You fainted around a time when there was a disruption in the magical world. These disturbances usually once happen every thousand years and magic shuts off for a brief second to recharge.”
Theo laughed at the story, “well, as long as your healing potion works.”
“GIVE IT BACK!” Draco yelled. Harry blinked in surprise he hasn't heard any of the slaves yell like that to their masters without fear of punishment. Harry was extremely proud of the blonde for standing up for himself to these horrendous bullies. No. Harry wouldn’t call them bullies. These people are criminals.
“I looked in his mind Dahlia,” Snape whispered nodding at Harry. “He may be able to help.”
Harry walked into his room and saw a subdued Theo curled into a fetus position on the floor. Theo was clutching his stomach and Harry ran to the hurt boy. “Theo, are you ok??” Harry asked frantically as he took out his wands to cast diagnostic spells.
Draco looked at Theo before speaking, “are you sure this is not a cruel prank, but if you’re right, what happens when Harrison comes back?’
Nott looked up his eyes widened with fear,
Snape pondered for a moment before finally saying, “that is...bold, but what are your plans? The order is strong and by no means stupid, and they have very powerful witches and wizards.”
Draco shakily takes the pizza in his hands as he smells the cheesy goodness. Draco sticks his tongue slightly out giving it a soft lick causing Harry to laugh at his antics. “Draco, I promise I am not going to get mad at you, take a bite”.
Harry was cut off as Bellatrix interrupted, “look, kid, Severus trusts you and that is good enough for me, probably not for some people, but I overrule them so...”
“Well, your dear old headmaster seems to have a thing for pretty young wizards, who he considered to be ‘dark’.” Snape sighed, “and because I was a master’s in potions, in order to actually secure my loyalty to the light, I created this potion for the old coot as with his support, no one would question me.”
Just then someone appears. Harry recognizes her. She has dirty nappy hair, her eyes are hollow and she looks very small and extremely malnourished.
“Right away my lord,” Theo smiles back before exiting the room.
“The ones that end with a kiss,” Draco smirked as Snape rolled his eyes muttering under his breath.
“Merlin, what is this? who said that?” Harry asks angrily.
Sirius snorted, (like a pig in Harry’s opinion), “I wanted Lucius. I wanted to see the blonde git broken.” Sirius put his utensils down as he clasped his hands together on the table. “I want the fusty beg like the worthless slave he is. I want him at my feet, licking the very ground I walk on.”
Sirius smirks, “Apparently the Knights decided to make an appearance in Diagon Alley.”
James Potter looked like Harry in his outfit but more regal and lord like. James snapped his fingers and out came someone who wore dirty and torn rags. Harry could see multiple scars on this person and the person shaking as they came in pouring the tea. Harry distinctly recognized Theodore Nott. Harry gulped. In his world, when he sees Theodore Nott, he looks more powerful and confident, now he looks broken and wearing a industrial metal collar wielding on his neck with the same sigil engraved as the one on his shoulder plates.
Lily was wearing a beautiful gold gown with a slit, complementing the dress was a diamond belt. Her fake laughs echoing around the room. James was wearing an all-black suit with the golden tie to match Lily’s dress, and they both snuck in soft pecks of kisses every now and then. Harry tried not to gag in disgust.
“Go to the kitchen and ask for Jasmine and give this to her please,” Harry says smiling at Theo who nods.
Draco sighed dreamily, “isn’t Gabriel Taylor pretty?” he asks Snape. Harry felt his world stop. Draco Malfoy called a boy pretty. Harry was so confused, even more than how he was trapped in this world. He silently walked a little closer to the duo interested in where this conversation was going.
“But why would it switch? Lord Harrison’s and Harry are completely different people,” Theo remarks. “And wouldn’t it have done that for everyone?”
Harry felt someone grab his bicep and guide him to a darker corner of the room, as eyes stared at him showing no emotion. “Stay here Harry.” Snape’s voice was firm.
Harry took a deep breath before explaining the book he found in the library a couple of days ago, and how there are two universes or duo universes, working together side by side which is called the contrarium doctrina. Harry said the worlds work together at the same time but don’t rely on each other for balance.
A loud slap echoed through the halls as there was a bright red handprint on her face. “Watch your mouth Fusty, you, after all, have no use for that tongue of yours.” Frank hissed back. Harry could see blood leak from her mouth, as Dahlia’s face hardened not showing any emotion.
“My names Ginerva, or Ginny, and I want to be a knight.” Ginny speaks out smiling softly at Draco.
“Harrison, welcome,” Dumbledore said smiling as Harry entered the room. The room was exactly like Professor Dumbledore’s office in Harry’s world. “Lemon drop?” he asked gesturing to the little candy tray in the corner. Harry shook his head in caution as he moved forward to sit down. Dumbledore chuckled, “no need to be so nervous Harrison, after all, I’ve seen you grow up, you’re like a grandson to me.”
Theo looked at him crazily. He opened his mouth then shut it looking back down at the ground fidgeting with the torn hem of his shirt. Harry looked at him bewildered, “Well??? Say something!”
Theo looked at him with hopeful eyes, “y..you at least stopped it Harry…” he wiped his tears, “t..they done it before, they always do it, and s..sometimes my hearing gets messed up because of it.” Theo took a deep breath before continuing, “my ear drum was damaged last time, I…I couldn’t hear for 3 months, and because of that L..lord Harrison finally took me to Madama Pomfrey to heal me, because he got annoyed.”
Harry often enjoyed playing with Cassiopeia with Draco. How Draco’s eyes lit up with joy when he saw the small calico kitten. It didn’t matter if was put under the cruciatus curse hours on end, or starved for days, beaten and ridiculed. The small spotted rascal always put a beautiful smile on Draco’s face which Harry always wanted to see.
The room was cozy. It wasn’t like Harrison’s room, all grand, regal, homely. This room had a small minimalistic kitchen, a little living space with a fluffy loveseat couch, a coffee table and a small television. There was a simple bed with cotton blankets and fluffy pillows, a desk, a bookshelf, and Harry is sure the door on the other side of the room is the bathroom. The room was on the darker side, but it was comforting.
Draco slowly lowers himself down grabbing his hair, he opens his mouth then closes it thinking it’s best to let Harry talk. He follows Harry to the bar his hair trailing behind as the recipients in the bar touch it.
“Well...that’s good because you know, you’re dating my little sister, and she is something” Fred said winking.
Hermione Jean and Ginevra looked at him with wide and surprised eyes. “Well….I guess you’re right Harrison, having passion will negate all the unfortunates that can happen.”
Harry could feel Draco tense, or it may have been himself, he wasn’t too sure. What he did know was he felt blood suddenly rush to his face as he knew he was blushing. Draco slowly let Harry go too and Harry smiled softly knowing the blonde too was blushing hard as the pink in his cheek is very contrasting to his pale face.
Just then Theo appeared as he bowed to him and Fred saying, “my lords.” Theo was shivering with fear and Harry wanted to know why. He was furious with the brunette for leaving the room and because Theo is always in danger by roaming the halls.
“Pumpkin juice?? You insolent idiot, I asked for mango juice” Dean roared out.
Harry felt the wind tousled his hair. He was on his broom up in the air trying to spot the golden blur. He could hear cheers from the Gryffindor stands as he sees Ginerva make a goal. Like Ginny, Ginerva was an excellent chaser. Ginerva wore a proud smirk as she did a flip of victory before joining the rest of her teammates on their side.
“How do you know this Potter brat isn’t lying?” Lucius interrupted harshly.
Harry nodded, “yep! And there we will build big sandcastles in the warm sand...in which we will definitely charm for us to go in.” Harry winked at the giggling boy, “and then we will swim in the big, blue ocean making big waves.”
Snape’s eyes softened at Harry’s words, “you see Harrison...Harry, we have no problem with muggle-borns into our world, but we do have a problem when our traditions are being forgotten, that’s why the war started. People were angry.”
Theo looks at him strangely, “who is Voldemort?”
“Who is that?” Harry asks. He sees a fiery redhead girl with bright blue eyes riddled with anger. She looked skinny, but not malnourished like the slaves here. She was fit thought. Harry wondered if it was from training day and night to fight this ongoing war. Severus had told him, how much the Knights train, physically, mentally and magically.
Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to Grindelwald. There was a rumor by Rita Skeeter in the daily prophet about how Dumbledore refused to move against Grindelwald when he was young due to the fact, he was in love with the blonde haired man.
Remus nodded as he pulled out a beer bottle causing a secret door to open, “go…live your dream.”
“Conscious?” Harry asked confused.
----------
Harry is amazed at how well he is handling this situation, by not talking or showing emotion. Granted he was biting his tongue hard to stop him from speaking. Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing, from people he thought were good. Harry knew he needs to disassociate the people from his world and this world because it is seriously affecting his judgment.
Snape chuckled darkly, “No, I fed him, healed him, played with him as a child, taught him, hugged him, loved him, but I didn’t free him as a slave and because of that I truly never helped Draco….or anyone of them.”
“Come on Ronald, get your fusty up, we have to go to the library to cram for our Potions exam,” Hermione Jean says as Ronald kicked Draco, who let out a yelp struggling to stand up. Harry shook his head as he eyes the blonde’s dangling broken arm.
Harry smiled softly as he stared into the beaten down eyes of Nott, unable to find it in his heart to tell him they were enemies, “we didn’t talk much because we were in different houses, but we seen each other around”. Harry said, “and trust me when I say Hermione and Ron are not like these people here, they are much more kinder, funnier and accepting”
Harry let out a groan as he buried his face within his hands thinking about Theo’s questions, “just when I think I get somewhere I am back to square one, I just don’t know Theo.” Harry let out a deep breath pondering on what to do next.
The jealous sister found an abandoned tower hidden away as she plans to raise the child on her own keep the magic of his hair to herself.
“Wouldn’t you like to know Lord Harrison,” Lucius sneered.
Lucius scoffed at Harry’s statement rolling his eyes, “like hell you are, Severus has been telling me you have been cozying up with Draco again. Wasn’t breaking his heart, humiliating him, dehumanizing him the first time enough?”
“Dahlia, they trust me as you trust me.”
Everyone around was laughing as tears fell down his eyes. “P….p..please my lord” Draco stuttered out.
Harry gulped at Snape’s words. He desperately wanted to know what was going on. Harry knew there was resistance with the putrid bloods, but it has been a while since they were seen. Harry hoped whoever is part of the resistance is preparing because his side has very competent witches and wizards.
“I wish Dahlia, but if I say anything they will immediately know something is wrong.” Snape playfully replied.
Harry blinked at the dark-eyed witch. This Bellatrix was definitely not like the one in his world. This one cared deeply for her family.
“I’ll let down my occlumency shields and you can find out,” Harry said seriously gulping as he found the courage to look into the hard eyes of the professor.
Sirius was about to make a retort but was silenced by Remus’s hand going up as he gestured to Lily and Alice coming to them.
Harry heard a knock on the door as someone entered. Severus Snape walked in laughing alongside Lily. “Good afternoon Albus,” Lily said as Severus nodded in acknowledgment.
Someone opened the door, and Ronald smiled and exclaimed, “Hermione Jean!” and took her hand and have a kiss like a male would do in the Victorian era or something, Harry thought. This girl did not look like Hermione at all. Her hair was longer and slicked straight. She had a tight outfit with leather boots with heels, when she walked that clicked which accentuates her dominance.
“Now dear, Severus will take care of her, about time he chose a fusty for himself,” Alice gently rubs Frank’s arm glowering at a sneering Dahlia.
Harry looks around to find Nott and sees him in the corner standing to facing a wall. Harry gulped.
“Get ready when you come back, we need to practice some spells”. Luna Lovegood said with a smirk on a face Harry never would have imagined Luna could make.
Alexander squealed with delight as he returned the hug, his small arms wrapping around Harry’s neck.
. Harry looked at Theodore who is kneeling at the end of the room still shivering facing the wall. He must be mine as well Harry thought. Harry looks closer to see something engraved on his skin on his hip with what looks like to be a knife,
Harry felt goosebumps hearing a high pitched scream. He ran as fast as he could following it to the courtyard. There stood his so-called friends and a tied up Draco Malfoy.
Infuriated with the Hufflepuff boy, Harry bumps into him again with all his force, which causes Cedric to slip of his broom, falling fast and hard to the ground. For a quick second, Harry stood still and frozen at what just happened, his ears ringing as muffled shouts echoed in his ears. Harry just watches Cedric’s body fall with spells being fired all around the boy trying to protect him.
Snape nodded, “yes there was, I went to the little party hosted by...Lily.” Snape trails off looking at Draco who gulped at the name. “I don’t have to talk about it,” Snape said softly to a quivering Draco.
Harry gets lowered into the crown room slowly as he eyes the Prince’s crown. He grabs it stuffing it in his satchel right before the guard sneezed. Now Harry may be a thief but at least he has manners.
Harry stood in front of the Fat Lady muttering to himself.
“Well, unlike in your world, they didn’t want to enslave muggles or kill the muggleborns but give the muggle-borns a choice. They choose the wizarding world and their family and friends obliviated or the muggle world, but if they choose the muggle world, they cannot practice magic.”
Alexander sat on Harry’s lap staring at the group as well. “Mummy and Daddy say when it is safe they will finally let me go outside!”
He was talking to a friend who had bright hazel eyes. Cedric pulled the leash causing the person attached to fall. Harry recognized her to be Pansy Parkinson. Pansy, unlike Cedric, did not look good. Her hair was badly cut as she seemed to be developing a black eye, and like many others, she looked incredibly skinny.
Harry nodded, “Um...yes….yes I am!” Harry exclaimed a little louder, hoping that his confidence would throw the red-haired twin off.
Draco finally let out a sob as he broke down looking at the pile of ash ignoring the laughter happening around him.
Draco shakes his head, “No, I charted stars and these lights are not it mother, please let me go!”
“Who escaped?” Harry asked as he grabbed a slice of pumpkin pie.
Everyone stopped to look at him. Harry bit his lip wondering if he should have said anything at all.
Bellatrix’s face hardens, “Draco you will not be able to handle yourself. The outside world is a dangerous place, filled with monsters and thugs, men with sharp teeth.” She bares her teeth at him growling causing Draco to flinch.
Dahlia ignored Harry as she continued to talk with Snape, “I’m pretty sure you figured it out, they needed to get someone on the inside.”
Harry hugged the weeping witch tighter. He couldn’t imagine what she went through. “Sev...severus checked me and said that Molly cast a curse of her own which renders the woman barren.”
Harry touches the metal collar looking at it weirdly. The crest embellished on it was a Griffon. The crest on Theo’s collar was a lion. Harry could guess the lion was the Potter family sigil. To Harry that was bullshit. Lion’s symbolize courage, and in this world, the Potter family was anything but courageous.  “Why is there a Griffon on there?” Harry asked trying to make a conversation out of the quiet boy.
The light shines in Harry’s eyes as he lets out a groan of pain as his head pounds. He sees himself on the Hogwarts train as he looks around in confusion.
“Apparently the fusty didn’t hear properly, maybe we need to clean his ears, no?” Ginny said her voice malevolent.
“You say that, but yet you have the son of the top members in your room.” Harry winced at the tone. It felt like a thousand knives cut through him at once at the sharpness of her tongue.
“Lanterns? I knew they weren’t stars!” Draco cheers. He clears his throat, “I need you to take me to them and protect me against any thugs and ruffians trying to attack me.”
Snape nodded, “you would be surprised how many people are secretly part of it.” Snape exhaled, “for reasons, I will not tell you who they are, but in the end, they will join us, in the near future war is coming.”
They both ran to the open window to see Sirius and Remus already there. “What is happening Black?” Snape snorts masking his face with no emotion.
Harry chuckled, “You better.” He preferred if the brunette stayed in his room when Harry was out as it would be safe for his friend. Harry supplied Theo with enough food for the time being.
Harry nodded solemnly trying to figure out his next words, “Ok...next time, if ANY of you are hungry, let me know and I will sneak you food.” Theo smiled at Harry’s words nodding in understanding, before moaning again to lie back down.
“Yes?” Harry wavered out hoping it didn’t sound different. “The Supreme and his council require your presence”.
“Did you eat a dragon or something?” Harry teased causing the blonde to hold back a chuckle.
“I wouldn’t like it, sir,” Harry replied softly. “I understand now where you guys are coming from, and I’m sorry for the way I acted.” Harry really did understand. Now Harry understood, he will learn his traditions and share them again in his world. Harry smiled to himself as he knew Hermione would be pleased to learn something new and be connected with another culture she can call her own.
“She...she said this spell…I never heard it before,” Bellatrix cracked as she tried to keep a joking face but was failing miserably, “It...it hit straight at my stomach.” Harry gulped as he feared he knew where she was going. “Nothing happened at first...I didn’t feel anything, and I wasn’t going to get checked, but what scared me was what she said.” Bellatrix burst into tears as she laid her head on Harry’s shoulder crying. Harry wrapped both arms around her rubbing her softly as he muttered comforting words in her ear. “She said after, that it was good my kind can’t breed anymore.”
Theo looked at him licking his lips, “I don’t know what those are, but they sound really good!” He exclaimed, “I love food, especially when they finally feed us the green bread and maybe water here and there”
“Good,” Luna said, as she kicked Draco's face hard causing fall back to the ground letting a soft cry of pain.
Smiling in victory, Harry gently lifted Draco’s torn shirt off and took the damp cloth to wipe the scars of excess secretion/pus, dirt, and dried blood. There were some scars and cuts that were infected and some that weren’t. Harry tended to the scars that weren’t infected in hopes of stopping the spreading infection. Harry then applied a soft cream to the infected cuts before bandaging the infected cuts with medical gauze that had healing properties.
“Xavi, NEVER talk to strangers again,” Harry heard the man whisper to the young boy. He let out a sigh as he scooted back into the wall bringing his knees into his chest. He wasn’t sure if these people will take to him. They obviously don’t trust him as they should. If he were in their position he would probably be the same.
“Once the person eats it, whenever they open their mouth, beautiful music comes out,” Amycus responded.
“But that’s barbaric!” Harry exclaimed, “Muggle-borns should be allowed to go home because it is part of their heritage! And they should be able to visit their family”
“But apparently they don’t take women knights.”
Theo shook his head, “no...when we were taken….um….we were toddlers and they never taught us magic...I never even held a wand.” Theo stammered slightly.
Draco huffs as he sits down staring at the bartender. He was a tall skinny man with mousy brown hair. What stood out to Draco was the scars on his face, he couldn’t help but stair. “Draw a picture, it lasts longer.” The bartender drawls causing Draco to flush and turn away.
Harry chuckled, not wanting to give satisfaction to Ronald, as he was still furious with what happened to Draco, “I think if you can’t complete the qualifications or even like to do these qualifications, you would be a terrible Auror.”
“I think that is wonderful” Draco exclaims as rushes over to him taking his hand as well as Hermione, “I believe you both can achieve your dream.”
“It was the stupid fusty and his loud obnoxious crying Professor!” Dean yelled, “it distracted us.”
Dean looked around the room his eyes blazing with a sharp glint. “Mates did I say pumpkin juice?” He asked with a smirk
“I love you too my fierce Dragon,” Severus winked to a groaning Draco.
Snape sighed looking at Draco’s hopeful eyes, “Draco...please don’t get your hopes up,” he begged to the blonde softly who wasn’t listening.
Hermione Jean nodded, “Yes Professor, as always” she gave an innocent smile, like how a 6-year-old girl would do to her parents to avoid trouble.
“What are the sla…” Harry was interrupted when Theo came in with a large covered tray. The delicious aroma of food enticed the room, as he heard Draco’s stomach rumble again this time louder. Harry smirked as he gently guided him to the table to eat.
“The resistance?” Harry asked.
Snape’s voice suddenly got low and authoritative, “alright, but Draco be careful and I am serious...I will not lose you.”
However, Harry was surprised to see Andromeda and Ted at the table. Andromeda is wearing a simple yellow dress with a brown belt, and Ted is wearing a simple black and white suit. They were laughing about something Sirius said.
Theo raised his eyebrows at Harry putting a book down, “do tell.”
“Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t slit your throat Potter, not after you stole from me,” Remus snarls.
Harry blinked back surprise at the compliment, “Thank you professor” he spoke keeping his voice steady.
“Stop lying Harry,” the white-blonde haired laughed throwing a pillow at him. Harry and Theo explained to Draco what happened a few weeks earlier, and the blonde was much more receptive of the idea and was extremely delighted that someone of such a high ranking “was the nicest lord he ever met”, in Draco’s words.
(WARNING: THIS SCENE HAS IMPLIED RAPE)
Harry flinched at the mentions of Ronald and Hermione Jean. As much as he would hate to admit it, these people were far worse than the death eaters he encountered. These people were cruel for pure joy rather than fighting for something. Bellatrix was a sadist, but she was a sadist fighting for someone rather than just because she could.
Fred nodded in approval at Harry’s choice of words. “Well...George and I came up with these rolls” Fred smirked, “a special little creation of ours, that creates painful ulcers in the stomach.”
"What are you doing later?" Ginerva asked giving another small kiss, this time on his neck.
Remus and Nymphadora sat together. Remus wearing an oxford button-up tee while Nymphadora wore a bubblegum pink dress that matched her hair. She had a black leather belt with black leather booties. Harry was shocked to see Tonks go by Nymphadora. He made that mistake when he called her Tonks and everyone stared at him with dubiety.
Harry looked at him his heart beating fast,
“I seen Cedric practicing in the Quidditch pitch earlier, and I just wanted to inform you, he has gotten good,” Dumbledore chuckled. “You set a precedent when you became the youngest seeker in the century Harrison.”
“Daddy!!!!” Alexander ran to Antonin Dolohov, “Hawwy said when things get more nice, he will take me to the beach!”
Harry gulped,
The chattering quieted down when the professor entered the room. “Good morning class” the Professor smiled. Harry had to take a second look at the professor in order to realize that the teacher is Snape. His hair stood short and clean rather than greasy. His teeth are straight and white. Professor Snape still stood tall, but his overall demeanor stood happier and Harry wondered why.
“And me!” Another red haired girl interjects,
Draco took a sip of his tea, “have you heard from them yet?”
“What did Harrison do to Draco?” Harry asked looking at the trio of adults.
Theo’s eyes brimmed with tears as he spoke through his sobs, “p..please my lords and ladies, please no..I’m sorry, next time I won’t get your request wrong” Theo continued to sob as a fresh wave of tears came.
“First Years, First Years!” A loud voice boomed. There yelled Hagrid. His facial beard was more trimmed and controlled as he wore a sophisticated outfit. This wasn’t the Hagrid he knew.
“My darling brother, cast incendio on an old picture of my fusty and his parents,” Ginerva spoke out twirling her utensil in her hand.
Harry sets out the dinner on the table smiling at the food. There were 2 hot tomato soup and 2 extremely soft bread roll to go with it. 2 chicken pot pies [which smelt extremely delicious in Harry’s opinion], 2 salads and fruit bowls, an assortment of soft freshly baked cookies, and 2 treacle tarts.
Ronald’s eyes darken with anger, as he takes out his wand screeching “crucio” to the blonde. Draco buckles down in pain screaming, contorting his body. Everyone is laughing as Ronald continues to do the spell a couple more times. It took everything in Harry’s power to not butt into this torture. Harry knows, in order to help Draco and the others in the long run, he needs to play the part of Lord Harrison for now.
Draco smiles at Harry as he rests his head on Harry’s shoulder, “thank you for trying to help us, Harry, it means a lot to every one of us.”
Once the diagnostic spells were complete, Harry let out a soft groan of anger. The spell showed nasty bumps in his stomach. Ulcers. Harry shook his head, “no it is not, the rolls you ate...Fred and George poisoned them.”
Andromeda callously grinned, “why was my putrid blood nephew crying?” Harry took a bite of his steak and chewed it so he couldn’t retort back to Andromeda’s words. He thought bitterly to himself, how she herself was the so-called ‘putrid blood’.
“Harrison open up!” A loud voice boomed as Theo yelped in fear dropping his spoon and rushing to the door opening it widely his head down. Ronald came in as he casted a disgusted look at Theo before kicking him hard in the shin as Theo cried out in pain still standing tall, “hurry up next time fusty” he spoke with venom as he tugged on a metal leash.
“Please continue Uncle Sev, tell me what happened,” the blonde says softly urging for him to go on.
“O.ok, whose idea was it?” Harry asked his chest tightening fearing the worst.
Harry recognized her to be Daphne Greengrass. While he never spoke to the girl in his world, she always seemed nice, and despite being a Slytherin she was pretty popular with the other houses.
Harry nodded,
"Please don’t call me that Theo, I am really sorry I didn’t stop it sooner….” Harry trailed off.
“Fine, but at least tell me your name blondie,” Harry says cheekily, “or shall I keep calling you beautiful angel.”
PS: Do you guys want Snape to be good or evil? Thanks for reading <3
Harry felt terrible, his anger towards this evil Cedric caused him to be blinded at his own Cedric that remembering Cedric’s death in the courtyard caused him to be happy at the sight of a rapist cold on the ground.
“A.albus Dumbledore, my lord, and w..we a.always have to say it like that” Nott whispered. Harry sighed as Nott continued, “In order for my kind not to rule again, they wanted all purebloods, not the sovereign who supported the light, to be eradicated, and if you give birth to a pureblood child you and your family will be like us for supporting our cause”. Nott said as he fidgeted with the hem of his torn shirt.
Nymphadora grimace in disgust, “ew, dearest auntie and uncle...honestly I don’t even know how they escaped.”
“I...I don’t understand sir,” Harry began as he scratched his head, “Don’t you love my mother?” he asked. The Severus Snape in his world was always in love with Lily. His Patronus was even a doe that matched hers. Because of his love for Lily, he was a spy for the order which was one of the turning points in them winning the war.
“Special invention made you yours twoly” Amycus and Alecto both spoke at the same time winking at Harry who glared playfully at them not wanting to open his mouth. [pun intended ;)]
Harry shook his head as he started at Nott eyeing his appearance again. Harry winced seeing the metal industrial collar wrapped tight on his neck, his skin was red around the edges. Harry could imagine how heavy it felt. Nott was barely wearing any clothes and the clothes he wore had tears and was dirty. Through the tears, Harry remembered seeing. Those words. Harry felt a tug on his chest he felt like he wanted to throw up.
----------
Draco let out a cheer, “that is amazing!! Merlin, I wish I was there watching the game.”
“Yes they are, but your other self has the same magical core and because for that brief second of unbalancement prompted the rift to open up because both of the magical cores were in the same place and at the same time,” Snape says looking at Theo. “Magic is unique, like a fingerprint, only two people have the same signature which is you and your opposite. The only thing which connects both worlds is your magical signature. But magic will realize its mistake and will fix it, whether it happens in 10 seconds or 10 years.”
Harry smiles, “well a King needs a castle, he says shaking his satchel as he makes his way to climb the tower.
“Wasn’t there a quidditch match yesterday with Italy and England?” Draco asks as he continues to pet the kitten who is purring loudly at Draco’s pets.
Draco nods, “yes, I will.”
“It’s my master’s family crest” Draco responded louder, because, with the little care Draco received, he felt much more lot better.  Harry noticed the change in voice Draco which made the messy haired boy happy.
Theo chuckled and nodded, “I did, your friends might wonder why your room is so messy you know. And why your stupid fusty is not doing anything.”
“Harry...please,” Harry said as he handed Draco the pain reliever potion to drink. “Is it ok if I can clean up the rest of your injuries?”
Ronald rolled his eyes, “that should be bloody stupid if you ask me, right Harrison?” he asked hoping for his friends' support.
Lavender nodded, “oh yeah, might want to bring some headphones, the screams from the fusty can get quite annoying, I mean we need to practice, but no, he wants to cry and beg for us to stop” she scowled.
Harry gulped as he held back tears. He couldn’t imagine what Narcissa and the parents who were caught went through when their infant children were forcefully taken.
Sirius smirked, “the fusty can be used as bait for Lucius and Narcissa, those putrid bloods love their son and will get him back, and when they do….” Sirius trails off as he grins maliciously taking a sip of his wine, “they will be ours to torture, Lucius, Narcissa, Bellatrix, Carrows, Lestranges, every single one of the traitors in hiding….and let's not forget the rat.”
Harry pinched the forearm to stop him from attacking the old man. This infuriated Harry, that the headmaster he once looked up to, allowed the abuse and enslavement of children happen in the halls of this school.
Harry smiled cheekily, “I perfected it.” as he gave a wink to Theo before starting on the potion, “and I had to clean the spills without magic as well, as remake every potion.” Theo laughed at Harry’s misfortune as the dark haired boy shuddered at the remembrance of being stuck in the hospital wing for an entire month.
“So, Potter, as you know my side is firmly with the resistance. and instead of them being called the Death Eaters, they are called the Knights of Walpurgis.” Snape started off, “Tom Riddle...or Lord Voldemort as you knew him, was not like the evil lord.”
Draco nodded stuttering, “yes…. my lord, I am terribly sorry, I will throw t...t...them away for you.”
Theo came back in the room carrying a tray of juices as he set it down on the table handing everyone their drinks and respective food items. Dean took a sip before splashing it on Theo’s face. “What the hell is this fusty?” He yelled as Theo shrank to the ground.
The girl came back, with a covered tray. Harry took the tray from her smiling, “thank you, love….” He said kindly smiling. Before biting his lip “How….how...” Harry trailed off. “W..what happened that caused you and your family to be like this?” Harry whispered his voice so low.
The boy blushed again, “tank you mista”. Harry chuckled at the boy's pronunciation. Harry hasn’t met many children before, or any children but he knew from experience they had trouble saying some letters which affected their speech.
Harry’s heart fluttered at the sight. It was clear everyone in this room loved each other regardless if they were blood family or not. They were family.
Draco could feel Harry’s heart beat fast, “Hermione, Ron…what a surprise,” Harry chuckles, “don’t worry Weasley clan and friends, I’m just here for a bite to eat.”
“I should have snuck in at night to hug him, Harry!” Snape wailed out, “to show my 3-year-old baby godson that I love him, and how much his parents love him.:  “You helped him,” Harry commented catching Snape’s eye. “Whenever you could, you made sure he was loved and that he knew his parents loved him.”
Theo let out a nod before closing his eyes, flicking his wrist with a louder “Lumos”. There was a slimmer of white light coming out of the wand before is dissipated. Theo brightened and let out a huge smile cheering. “I..I did it!!”
“Of course you don’t! The wizarding world slowly forgot their traditions just to make a few muggleborns more comfortable entering our world, instead of teaching the muggle-borns our tradition...which is essential theirs as well.” Snape interrupted furiously.
He kept repeating the words in his head. Harry felt like he ate a mountain of heavy stones as he feels something sink hard in his stomach.  Harry felt tears brim his eyes. He didn’t mean for anyone to get hurt,
Pascal nudges his knees, “I want to see the floating lights,” he mumbles.
“Honestly Draco, who cares, let me take you to see the darn lanterns so you could give me back my satchel” Harry retorted breaking Draco out of his trance.
Harry shook his head, “I..I don’t want to hurt Draco and his friends,” he explained biting his lip, “I..I am not Harrison sir, I just…..”
Cedric squat down grabbing Pansy harsh by the face smirking, “you liked last night didn’t you fusty” before giving her a slap to her face causing it to bruise slightly as he harshly pulled her up.
Nymphadora glared at Ginerva with contempt, “how dare you to mention that the worthless blonde traitor is my family.” Harry glowered at Nymphadora for calling Draco worthless. Draco was anything but worthless. In the few minutes Harry saw him alone, he saw a person who was extremely funny and witty, someone who loves quidditch and has a small kitten who he absolutely adores. Harry smiles to himself as he remembered seeing Draco kiss Cassiopeia's little tiny head, and the kitten seemed to kiss him back by giving a small lick on Draco’s chin.
Harry chuckled, “Hermione...my Hermione, was always into science like this, with anomalies, consciousness, and all that scientific mumbo jumbo. I think I must have picked up a thing or two.”
“Stop teasing Dahlia,” Severus interrupted holding a bag. “I am all packed Harry, we need to go now when the castle is empty.” The duo is going to be gone for a couple of days. They told Harry’s parents that they were going to get sacred potion ingredients and Harry wanted to become a potion’s apprentice.
“Come on, Uncle Sev, you know I’m punsexual” Draco laughs at his own joke, while Snape lets out a soft chuckle holding up his hand in defense. Harry bit his lip smiling, he didn’t know that the blonde is really hilarious, and Harry wanted to hear more of his jokes.
Draco grimaces slightly at the spell but begins to relax as he feels a soft tingling in his arm. “This spell will heal your broken arm Draco” Harry spoke shuddering at his own experience with Lockhart with this spell. “Don’t worry, I will tell Ron..ald that you need to have this bandage on your arm for a couple of weeks to ensure it is fine.”
He looked at the books confused.
“It was a dark time…the Great War Harrison, many good people died, and now we can avenge them in their good name, do not fail us”
Snape nodded, “listen to your wolf, dog,  Merlin knows he is the smart one out of your little group,” he sneered out.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at the Carrow twins antics. He was sure they were the ones that caused everyone here to smile in the dark gray space. Harry started to moan with closed mouth waving his hands wildly to his mouth.
“I promise I will be careful, Uncle Sev” Draco said softly giving a reassuring smile. Snape let out a soft sigh as he placed the teacup in front of Draco.
Harry entered the kitchen to see people making food. They were wearing dusty and torn rags. Most of them had burns on their hands and some on their face. They were wearing the signature metal collar welded into the neck as that seemed to be the fashion, the same kind he seen with Theo, Draco, Astoria, and Millicent. Harry looked closely to see the engraving his eyes widening in realization at the Hogwarts symbol. The symbol had the same motto engraved and instead of the quartet of houses, there was a trinity with the Slytherin symbol missing.
Harry hated this Lord Harrison, reminded him of Dudley, always spoiled and rubbing it in someone else’s face. “Theo, this room is your safe space ok? If you need anything just do it in here”.
Alexander’s eyes widen. “The beach?”
“oh…I don’t have a dream,” Harry responds, which causes everyone in the entire room to draw their weapons out pointing it to Harry. “You know on second thought….I have a dream to be really rich and swim in piles of money in a castle on my on private island?” Harry’s voice goes high in the end chuckling nervously trying to inch away from the sharp swords pointing his way.
Theo shakily bowed, “Yes my lord,” before exiting the room. Harry hoped that Theo knew he was faking his aggression towards him.
Bellatrix narrowed her eyes, “actual Harrison? What are you going on about Severus?”
Voices shouted at once as Theo nodded quickly standing up, “Right away my lords and ladies” he said as he exited the door.
“Harrison…” Ginny trailed off, “you cannot mean that” she said as she stood up placing a soft kiss on his lips.
Harry thought immediately. Her eyes widened at the sight of Harry or Harrison. “My lord” she immediately said as she fell to the ground to kiss his feet. Harry felt repulsed. He knew he couldn’t say anything until he figured out what is happening. Harry clenched his fists doing everything in his power to act like a Slytherin and not do anything brash.
“For god’s sake Draco, again with the mumbling?” Bellatrix snarls. “Speak up.”
“Right away my lord,” she said, as she went back to the kitchens to make him the dinner. Harry sat on grounds of the kitchen watching the people work. He didn’t recognize anyone in the kitchens. They were busy as they were preparing the dinner meal at Hogwarts starting in a couple minutes.
Snape gently placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder, “Lucius, that is enough, this person is not Harrison, surely you’re competent enough to remember 5th-year astronomy.”
Snape grabbed Harry’s collar lifting him up swiftly before slamming him hard into the wall, Harry’s ear’s started to ring due to the impact on his head hitting the cement wall. “What do you mean you’re not Lord Harrison? You’re parents are James and Lily correct?”
“I want to help all of you.” Harry looked into Lucius’s eyes, “I swear on Merlin and Morgana I will never betray anyone of you.”
“Ok, good to know, is Tom Riddle alive?” Harry asked taking another bite.
“Since you need to clean your ears fusty.” Luna said as took a bite of her fruit with Hermione Jean next to her smile also taking a bite.
Snape scorned at Harry’s words, “Are you that much of a sadist in that you need to see other people torturing kids in order to get off?”
“Different how my lord?” Nott asked confused. Harry sighed softly as he whispered, “First off, you call me ‘My Lord’, why do you do that?” Nott looked at him. “Um...because you have lordship my lord, when your family was one of the major factors in winning the war.”
“Oh...yeah, I know him, he is the Supreme’s, may he forever reign, slave, I think I told you,” Theo responds. “Are you ready for class Harry?” Theo asks as he walks towards the door to exist. “First you have transfiguration.”
“Oh, can I help you, my lord?” Draco asked his voice hoarse.
Sirius snorted in anger, “your dear aunt and uncle escaped because of that bloody traitor.”
Cedric chuckled nodding to his friends, “yeah yeah mate, I got you” he told his friends. He grabbed Pansy as he gripped her hair hard pulling it making her whimper in pain. “She likes it rough,” he said as he started to grind himself on her. Pansy tried to look away but couldn’t as Cedric harshly forces her face to look at him. “Little puggy, you know how I like to look at your precious face, the look of terror and pain is very appealing to me you know?”
“Draco, what I am about to do will hurt, but it will make your arm better ok?” Harry says his voice soft.
Harry walked with Hermione Jean and Ronald. “The potion was really easy” Hermione Jean commented as Ronald agreed. “I really think we all will achieve high NEWTS in order to get into the NEWT Level class next year!”
Theo winced, “the lord supreme, may he forever reign, requests your presence, at his office in the west towers.”
Alexander nodded happily, “yeah and we will build sandcastles big enough for us to go in! And swim in the water and make splashes!”
Ronald placed his head in the crook of Hermione Jean’s neck. “M...Madame Pomfrey says Cedric is paralyzed from the waist down,” Ronald mumbled softly. Harry never saw this Ronald look so sad, even when innocent human beings were being abused and hurt under his care. “He can never play quidditch again....” Ronald continued before gulping, “Madam Pomfrey says Cedric is impotent.”
“It could be fabricated.”
“No Dean, you didn’t” Seamus said.
“Get up boy,” Bellatrix barked as Harry quickly stumbled up.
Harry gently takes Draco’s arm who let out a small wince. Draco keeps his eyes on the ground shuddering at Harry’s touch. The forearm is completely snapped in half, and if Harry lets the arm go, it would be dangling.
Ronald shook his head, “Really Hermione Jean? I would be glad to never step foot into another potions classroom ever again.”
