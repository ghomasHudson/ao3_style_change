Potter was already in his usual spot, ranging across the settee in a sprawl, one hand propped behind his head, and a pillow smushed below a bare foot. Bare feet, again - Draco shook his head as if to clear it. If only Potter would wear socks… Draco normally took the armchair nearer Potter's head, the one with soft, beige waffled upholstery, but tonight he was lingering at the parlour door, the flicker of light from the television on the walls matching the flutter of nerves in his stomach.
“The chateaubriand, with the lemon sorbet for afters.” That sounded good. Very Malfoy. Harry’s stomach growled, and he thought belatedly that he should have at least got someone to bring him back a sandwich or something, because he was fucking starving.
It was warm, and drugging. Potter’s hands pressed hard into the knotted muscle of Draco’s back and shoulder, the top of his spine, down down down to the small of his back, fingers spread wide over his ribs. When the tips of Potter’s fingers travelled far enough on his left flank to just catch Draco’s nipple, Draco allowed himself another rough sound of pleasure, and moved his hips down against the bed. He wanted Potter to feel it.
“Oi,” Harry pointed his chopsticks warningly at Ron, and a bit of sauce dripped on the knee of his pyjamas. “No falling in love with my fiance.”
Frowning, Harry picked up the cock-helmet, still lazily stroking with his other hand, and fitted it over the head of his prick. It felt a little bit unyielding, which wasn’t a promising start. There was a small switch, easily flicked with the tip of a thumb, and-
“You must’ve hated that,” Ron said mildly, and started buttering slices three and four. “Get a good look, did you?”
The cock bush rested on the bench, pricks bobbing ever so gently like a huge, phallic sea anemone. Malfoy let out a low whistle, and approached the bench with curiosity. “So this is the beast itself,” Malfoy looked over his shoulder at Harry, and grinned. “I can see why Throttlebottom would be a bit put out.”
Potter laughed and easily dodged Draco’s hex. “Back here in exactly an hour Potter or I’m leaving without you.”
Taking a deep breath Harry wandlessly conjured some lube in his right palm. The hot prickle of his magic throbs in his fingertips, flowing through his arm from his chest, his heart. It’s intoxicating, and not something he has ever bothered to take the time to savour before. Malfoy’s changed that about him. Malfoy, Malfoy, Malfoy.
“That, ah, should be quite enough, thanks Malfoy,” Harry said, staring down at the readings on his parchment.
Harry set down his glass, too, and straightened up. Andromeda wasn’t one to call unless it was an emergency.
He couldn’t really spend the whole day getting off with himself. For a start, he wasn’t actually fourteen and he was probably going to start finding it difficult to get, well, hard. And sore. He thought he would probably start feeling quite sore soon. No, no more wanking today. Four times was quite enough. He pushed himself away from the sink and strode with purpose to his bedroom, determinedly not covering up his bits this time, or thinking about the soft weight of his cock against his thighs.
The latter seemed to be the cause of the injury Malfoy was currently suffering. By hand, as it were.
“I think there's a case to be made that I turned you hard, actually.” He felt rather than heard Draco’s quiet laugh.
“Yeah,” Harry’s hands went around Draco’s waist, and rubbed softly at his hips. “You look brilliant.”
“I don’t care,” Draco pushed back into Potter’s groin, and they both made embarrassing noises as Potter’s cock, already sticky at the tip and hard as a rock, slid against Draco’s arse. Potter pressed himself against Draco’s body completely, his lips mouthing at Draco’s neck and nipping at his shoulder through the fabric of his shirt. Potter’s hands spread over Draco’s hips, slid up and under the hem of his shirt to stroke his stomach, feather light fingertips that teased past the jut of Draco’s erection, hot and leaking where it pressed against his shirt. Draco’s fingers tightened on the edge of the bench. “Touch me,” Draco’s voice was pleading, but he didn’t care. “Come on.”
Wedderburn nodded obediently, and clamped his lips together so tightly they turned white around the edges.
Harry took the stairs as quickly as possible, and pulled his sweat-soaked tshirt off as soon as the door closed behind him. He was about as sweaty as he’d ever been in his life, and he decided, since he was going to have to do a full strip and re-dress, that he may as well get under the shower for a quick and icy-cold rinse as well. The cold water was shocking, very helpful for banishing impure thoughts about lovely blonds with impressive magical stamina, and he rubbed himself perfunctorily down without soap. Just enough to wash the perspiration off, and he was in a fresh pair of joggers and a tshirt in under five minutes.
Harry wandered out again and found himself in the sitting room, picking up stray case files and stacking them on the old corner desk. He didn’t really want to do any work, nor any housework, but he’s fidgety and doesn't quite know what to do with himself. It’s barely half-eight and he hasn’t any plans until his Sunday night workout.
It was a quiet house. Draco sat in the bath, a huge, claw-footed thing made of cast iron. Steam rose in wisps from the hot water, the dim blue light of the morning filtering through the funny, knobbly glass pane of the window. His bathroom at Grimmauld Place reminded him in so many ways of the Manor - slipper tubs with brass caddies, filled with bristly back scrubbers, soft shaving brushes, and creamy, oval shaped bars of soap that smelled like honey and oats. He wasn't sure how that constant reminder of his old life made him feel. One way or another, it was better than bathing in a copper trough in the gamekeepers hut.
No, not thinking of Malfoy, thinking about himself. His eyes. He’d always liked them too, as soon as the first person had told him they were just like his mothers. They were a nice green, a warm sort of green. Right now the green was almost swallowed up by black. That was definitely a little bit hot.
was well and truly off the script, and Draco hadn’t heard even a whisper of such an intention until right this moment. His eyes met Potter’s across the podium, and Potter shook his head. No inkling from his side, either. “Although this is a sad time for me, and my staff,” Draco stared at Potter, and tried not to make any sort of facial expression at all that might betray him. “I am excited to be entering a new chapter of my life, and I am equally excited to announce that my successor, the man who has been my right hand in many ways, is our own Harry Potter!”
“Y-yeah,” Harry wasn’t sure Malfoy would even hear him over the music, his reply huffed out on a shaking breath.
“Has it?” Draco put every effort into keeping his voice light, and he gestured for another of the Ice Mice things just for something to do with his hands, and mouth.
“Harry, if you’re not seeing anyone there’s a certain massage therapist working for a certain Quidditch team which shall for the time being remain nameless, who has dropped a number of not so subtle hints that he is single and interested. I could set you up, just say the word.”
It was beautiful, peaceful. The rush and fizz of the sea. The stars were starting to come out. The water was beautiful, and it made him wish Potter was here too. He’d like this. Draco clenched his jaw. Potter wouldn’t come to a place like this with him. Maybe with someone else. The things he had with Potter lived in hotter places, places that ached and seared, and consumed. He was freezing, suddenly. His chest ached.
Draco clasped his hand briefly, and took it off his neck. “I’ll be fine. You stay. Have a bit of fun for once.”
Not when they’d usually see each other, which was generally on a Friday - every Friday, for a long while now - after pub night at the Old Mallard. Draco didn’t have a mobile, and Potter had never asked his address, so couldn’t Owl. Which left them to meaningful looks over lukewarm pints, casual touches that lingered too long, innuendo barely concealed as innocent banter.
So Potter had been telling his friends about it. Maybe about them. Draco’s stomach ached. Granger obviously knew, but she was frighteningly perceptive, so that wasn’t necessarily an indicator that she’d officially been
“I’ve heard this hypothesis before,” Draco said, feeling his blush make a sneaking return up his neck. Potter smiled, one of his horrible, charming smiles, and brushed two fingers across Draco’s temple. “What was that?”
Harry shoved his hand in his hair, forgetting for a moment that he was holding his quill and spent the next several seconds untangling it from the knotty mess of his fringe. He cleared his throat. He suspected he had ink on his forehead, now. “Yeah, um. Nev said it’s in good shape, and if you work on it in the greenhouse over the next six months or so, it should be big enough to divide the bulbs, so you can try getting it to take in the Manor woods.”
The front door swung open, and the volume nearly doubled as the Field Division poured in, laughing and pushing each other.
Ron was splayed across the meeting table in their office. “Please tell me we’re going to the pub tonight. I haven’t had a night out since this fucking op began, and I want sweet mother alcohol like I’ve never wanted her before.”
Draco looked at Potter for a long moment. He was still grinning, his teacup held close to his chin, the steam curling upwards and ever so slightly fogging his glasses. “Potter, not for the first time I have to wonder whether you’re a genius, or just an extraordinarily lucky idiot.”
“Once,” Draco said, but that had been a very different experience. He’d been with Mother, and they were resetting the Manor wards. Even then, it had been unsettling to have someone else touch his magic that way, even someone he trusted and loved — he had no idea what this would feel like. The wards were older, the job was bigger, and there was the small matter of his unrequited infatuation.
But Draco couldn’t. This was too much to take in. Too hard to believe. He tossed in the Floo powder, and looked at Potter, then quickly away again. Potter was just standing there, unhappy.
Harry had so many questions he wanted to ask about Malfoy’s bespoke spells, but most of all, he was seriously impressed. Not that it would do to tell Malfoy so.
Potter didn’t say anything in response, but moved behind Draco until his chest was just touching Draco’s back, and brought his arms around to loosely clasp Draco’s wrists. It took everything he had not to shudder. “A little more relaxed — that’s it. Open your stance slightly more. Perfect, Draco.” And this time he couldn’t entirely suppress a shiver. Potter was all but whispering into his ear. “You know, this is a very skimpy vest.”
“Granger and Weasley will need to stay as well, and that means Pansy will want to stay lest she be accused of being less of a super friend than your little pals, and that probably means the Ginger Harpy will bunk with her even though we’ll all pretend it’s not happening.” Draco’s nose wrinkled with disgust, which was mostly performative. Mostly.
Later, after they’d taken a drive to the charity shop and dropped off all Harry’s junk in the loading dock out the back, Hermione stopped the Renault at Grimmauld’s front gate, where Ron kissed him noisily on both cheeks and tried to shout as loudly as possible that Harry must try not to wank too often even if he was terribly lonely.
Which meant cooking the muggle way, and cleaning the hut by hand, and washing his clothes in a tub, by hand. It meant digging the pumpkin patch using a real pick and elbow grease, and shovelling real manure around as required. Repairing the fences and scarecrows by hand. Cutting the grass surrounding the hut with a scythe when it got too tall. Keeping the fire lit using a tinderbox and logs, and chopping said logs with the heavy, old axe. And collecting those logs from the perimeter of the forest.
Malfoy gripped him suddenly by the chin. “I want you to stop talking like that. I want you to treat yourself with the empathy and respect that you’d treat one of your friends, am I clear?”
Harry took the chance to avoid whatever potentially embarrassing conversation had been about to unfold with Malfoy, and stood quickly, holstering his wand at his thigh. He jogged after Ron, Malfoy falling in slightly behind him, and a moment before they stepped into the briefing room, he felt the tingle of someone else's magic drift over his face and fingers.
Potter’s fingers traced the crease along Draco’s hip and thigh. Draco knew that Potter would touch him, soon, but the agony of waiting even a matter of moments kept his breathing ragged and his nerves raw. As his hand closed around Draco’s prick, Potter opened his eyes and looked at Draco, and Draco felt his heart pound harder. He was sticky with need, and Potter smeared his thumb through the wetness until Draco gasped his name, and in the next moment, he was silent, barely able to breathe as Potter first rubbed the tip of Draco’s prick across his bottom lip, then slid his mouth down the length of it entirely. Draco’s fingers went to Potter’s hair, carding through the damp strands and twisting them around his fingers, and Potter groaned around Draco’s cock, his mouth slick heat and suction, and too much, and not enough, all at once. Potter’s hands gripped him, fingertips pressing hard into his flesh until there was no chance of escaping bruising; one hand was splayed at the base of Draco’s cock, holding him still and alternately gripping, stroking upwards to meet the downward slip-slide of Potter’s mouth. The other grasped Draco’s thigh, had hoisted it up and over Potter’s shoulder, and Draco could feel the slight scratch of stubble on Potter’s jaw on the inside of his thigh, could feel it on Potter’s chin as it scraped Draco’s balls. He was going to fucking come, he could feel it in his spine, in the clenching of his calves, he could feel it burning in his chest as if he had run a marathon. The rug bit at his shoulders and heels as Draco’s spine arched, and Potter knew precisely what was coming, had abandoned Draco’s thigh in favour of a hand between his own while the other pressed Draco’s hip to the floor, and all the while his mouth was a constant, wet pressure, too tight, too hot, too fucking much. Potter didn’t stop, wouldn’t stop, and Draco was coming and Potter was taking it all, taking all of him, every drop, every jerk and pulse of his cock, every broken moan and bead of sweat. Then Potter pulled away with a whispered curse, his fist quickening, and Draco felt the hot brand of come on his thighs, and heard Potter say his name on a ragged breath. Draco, for his part, couldn’t imagine ever being able to organise his thoughts enough to ever speak a word again; he suspected the ability had left him at speed along with his orgasm.
Potter raised an eyebrow. “You know, you could at least pretend to be polite to me, Malfoy. Isn’t that what people in offices do?”
Potter was leaning with his hips cocked again. He was frowning down at the notes, so Draco took a moment to appreciate the way his lazy posture made Potter’s hips and thighs look even more firm and delicious than usual. “Probably less than an hour if you’re willing to lend me some magical muscle?” Draco tore his eyes away from Potter’s waist and found himself being watched. Potter’s eyes were unfairly green, really, nearly illegally pretty, with ridiculous black lashes like some sort of fictional stud, a rakish Barbara Cartland hero who was aching to ravish the—
They pulled each other’s clothes off with urgent hands. Potter’s skin was golden in the low light, honey-warm, soft under Draco’s fingertips. Fine, dark hair glinting on his chest and belly. Draco traced his lips, and Potter snapped at his fingers, laughing softly. “I hope you’re gonna be rough with me.” Potter dragged his blunt nails down Draco’s back, and gripped his arse, hard, pulling them tight together. Potter’s cock was a hot brand against Draco’s hip, and he moaned against Potter’s jaw. “I want to feel you tomorrow in the staff meeting. Want to feel you all day.”
“You’ve changed,” Ron said, staring sadly at the toast. “Time was, you would have spared a crumb of toast for a starving man, who hasn’t eaten in days.”
. It was a nondescript door, solid wood in glossy black paint, and with no panes of glass or mail slot or any other mark or sigil to indicate what lay beyond, aside from the business name on a subtle brass plaque fixed around eye level.  The question now was whether to knock, or just try the door and see if it opened.
The crate was down the stairs and hitting the floorboards with an almighty rattle practically before Draco could finish the French prats name.
“Me?” Harry said, and he flashed a quick smile at Malfoy. He tried not to look at him for too long at once, in case he forgot himself, and started staring again. Or worse, choking again. “Never better.”
“No,” he managed, strangled. “I can’t-” Draco stepped back, increasing the space between them. “What feelings?”
“Yeah...but how long could I keep something up with someone like him? I could never tell him the truth about magic, and we could never talk about some of the most important things in my life - like work, and what happened to my parents, or why I have  so many scars. I don’t think it would work with me and a Muggle.”
Harry kissed him quickly on the mouth, and Levitated some plates from the cupboards. “We make the rules in this house, remember, so if dinnertime is at four, it’s at four. Serve the salad, would you, and I’ll slice up the meat.”
It was truly surreal, to be standing in his laboratory with this fingers knuckle-deep in a synthetic pussy, gently fucking it, with Draco Malfoy standing close beside him making small sounds of encouragement. The lube slurped obscenely, loud in the quiet of the lab. Malfoy picked up the King Dong, and coated his hand in lube before he began to palm it in quick, efficient strokes. Harry hardly knew where to look; he could almost
“Please don't tell me you’ve been touching the deer, Ron,” Hermione said, poking him sharply in the knee. Ron stubbornly refused to respond, and Harry shook with laughter as Hermione really got into lecture mode. “Oh, Ron, for god’s sake! I swear, one day I’ll drown you in the bloody fountain-”
Back home, and back on his bed, Harry was still thinking about Malfoy. It was a puzzle to work out, much like any case at Misuse, but he wanted to figure this one out before he saw Malfoy again.
Neville was near howling with laughter. “Oh Circe, your face. Christ, no, Draco, I was only asking. Just one pureblood to another, you know. It can be difficult, when you’re traditional.”
Sleep hadn't been easy the night before - Draco had managed perhaps an hour or so, at best. His stomach was too cramped with misery and humiliation to let him rest, his mind speeding again with better ways he could have said things, other times he could have approached Potter, other ways Potter might have reacted. He was restless, and sick with embarrassment.
“Ah, Bog. I asked for him especially.” Draco glared at him. What a prick. “You know, he can’t actually tell you, right?”
Malfoy raised his hands innocently. “Of course not. I was going to say ‘religious’ - like, have you taken vows of some sort, Potter? Aside from the near terminal embarrassment you seem to suffer from at the very mention of sex, I have literally never seen a verified article of gossip about you in the papers, and you’re still one of their favourite topics. Especially at
Harry blinked, and Malfoy gestured to the bench, and the brown paper bag. He didn't trust himself to speak, so Harry nodded and turned back to the table, pretending his face wasn’t flaming and his mouth wasn’t dry. Malfoy thrust both hands deep into the bag - undetectable extension charm, Harry noted absently - and lifted out what was unmistakably a rubber female. Not a whole woman, but certainly a bit of thigh, and a lot of vagina. Harry abruptly dropped the King Dong, and it landed heavily between his feet.
Eventually Harry conjured himself a stool, and a comfy recliner for Andromeda, leaving Malfoy the standard visitors chair, and Malfoy went and got them all some treats from the canteen, prawn cocktail crisps, chocolate tartlets, and lemon drop biscuits, and a couple of cold cans of Muggle orange fizzy drink, which they sipped out of transfigured cups. Draco gave Ted a big kiss too, and sternly told him he needed to be much more careful in future, as Draco was counting on Teddy to look after him when he was a grumpy old man, which made Ted giggle and Draco grin. Harry loved them so much he felt nearly sick with it.
It took a moment for him to register what he was seeing. There were little coloured squares on the phone, but behind them was a photograph, another of the still ones made by Muggle mobiles. This one was of Draco. He had to look twice, to be sure, but there he was: standing at the back of a Ministry van, the night dark behind him, lit up by the flash of the phone’s camera. He was stretching, both arms above his head. His face was relaxed with pleasure, his torso flexed and bare where his jumper had lifted above his waist. The scars were there, just faint lines in the reflected light of the flash on Draco’s milk-white skin.
“I see,” Draco said. “Your references look excellent. Tell me, Mr Potter…what would you say your biggest weakness is?”
Harry said nothing, his cheeks burning. Malfoy put his glass on the table. “Potter. I know we don’t know each other very well, despite how long we’ve actually been acquainted. With that in mind, I want to assure you that you don’t have to answer this question if you don’t want to. But…” Malfoy paused, a line forming between his brows. “Are you alright, Potter? Did something happen to you, to make all this-” Malfoy waved his hand between them, “-problematic?”
“That’s weird and gross,” Draco lifted the lid of a cast iron pot, and moaned. Harry knew two ways to make Draco moan like that, and one of them was under a Warming charm in that pot. “Have you really?”
“’Morning, sir. If I may, could I have the car keys back, sir? Fleet have threatened to send a Howler every hour starting at lunchtime if you don’t return them today.”
There was a muffled sound of footsteps, and Draco knew that Potter was up. He sat up, and grasped the chain for the plug, pulling it out and watching the water gurgle slowly away. Another day.
Draco looked at his inkwell, and considered throwing it at Potter’s head. “My problem is not that you don’t know enough about security. My problem is that Scrivener idolises you, and your complete lack of understanding of office politics. Do you even know whose job it was to think about security, before our fearless leader appointed a security consultant?” Potter looked blank. “Me. It was me, Potter.”
At that last thought, Harry sat up suddenly, remembering Malfoy had given him something as they parted in the little laneway. A small box - he moved quickly to the washing hamper, where his jeans remained, ready to be laundered when he eventually ran out of clean socks. A quick rummage in the pockets and his fingers found the sharp edges of a rectangular object. Curiously, Harry pulled it out and turned it over in his hands. Inspiration, Malfoy had said. Spend the day in bed, but unshrink this first.
“Rest, remember no magic for the rest of the week, so text Hermione when you’re feeling better and we’ll come by for a Chinese.”
She looked him up and down pointedly. “Are you trying to be?” Draco clenched his jaw, and didn’t answer. He
Draco was grateful for the wall. Potter was running his fingertips gently over his clavicle, and it was doing things to his knees. “You like me.”
Draco had never said no. Even once. He was like a very stupid moth, coming back for more despite being scorched alive every time. They bit, and pulled, and fucked each other, but Draco never stayed the night, and Potter never acknowledged it in the day.
Harry gestured at the shop with his ID before tucking it back into his robes. “So this is your business?”
“Great,” Draco said, dazed. “No idea what the fuck you’re talking about, but thanks for the vote of confidence, I guess. Anything else?”
and your fucking pranks to punish me. They’ll split us up, Potter, or haven’t you thought that far ahead?” Malfoy laughed, and that was cold too. “Of course you haven’t. Or you have, and you don’t care. Maybe you want another partner. Great opportunity to get rid of Malfoy once and for all.”
“What was he doing visiting you at work?” Ginny said, breathlessly. Harry stared at his food, shoved another mouthful in, and when he couldn’t stall any longer, cleared his throat.
“No,” Draco moved toward the fireplace. “I’m not here for niceties. You have something to say, get on with it.” He wanted to be in Floo range. He didn’t have to come here. He didn’t need to listen to any of Potter’s bullshit. He’d leave if Potter pushed him too far, he would just fucking leave.
He could feel Potter's eyes on him - probably wondering why on earth Draco felt the need to sit on the exact same seat as he was, considering there were two armchairs, one of which was Draco's regular, and a whole other settee available. It's a gesture, Draco wanted to say, so you can see I'm
Draco blinked for a moment, then cleared what was now a very dry throat. “What are you doing, Potter?”
He eased out a lemony burp, and glared at the side of Ron’s head. “Telling Malfoy how I feel about him is asking for trouble. Just a bad idea, all round. If he’s not interested, then I might lose my partner and one of my best friends, and if he is, and we don’t work out, then...same outcome. Safer not to risk it.” Harry drained the can, and set about crumpling it into an aluminium disk.
Draco was deep in a fantasy about an alternate future in which he was happily employed at the International Magical Trading Standards Body, perhaps overseeing the import and export guidelines for wands and wand materials, when he rounded a corner and caught sight of Potter exiting the elevator at the far end of the hall. Draco’s stomach lurched. Potter held a take away cup in one hand, and looked distinctly rumpled. It was irritatingly attractive.
had a rotating staff of photographers on twenty-four hour duty, aiming for a snap of Throttlebottom wrestling with a fistful of dongs. He’d made the sensible decision to relocate to an Auror safe house with his wife to get away from the cocks, and the press. Ron wisely kept his mouth shut about it all and didn’t meet Harry’s eyes once during the meeting. Git.
The man crowded back in, and Harry tried not to make a face that might cause offense. “Whatever you’re into, I’ll have a go. Maybe you like being choked during sex. Maybe you want to be pissed on. Maybe you can’t come unless someone calls you ‘daddy’. At the end of the day, I love cock, and you love cock. So are you coming home with me tonight, or am I going back out on that dancefloor to find someone who will?”
Draco looked up, and went a bit pink. “As many as you like. Brie will need at least one playmate, surely?”
When Draco came, their foreheads were pressed together. He kept his eyes open until the very last moment, when he couldn’t anymore, and Potter swallowed every little moan of his own name, and came with his lips pressed to Draco’s throat.
He had a basic Ministry uniform of plain business shirts in various inoffensive shades - strictly without patterns, so that he was never at risk of making any potentially jarring matches using his own judgement -  and in a seemingly endless quantity, because if Harry was indifferent to hanging things up, he was even worse about doing his washing. He could probably go at least a month without washing, and still manage not to wear the same shirt twice. He had trousers in equally inoffensive black, grey and navy, and a collection of neutral ties which Hermione added to every Christmas, and which didn’t clash with anything else he owned. They all hung neatly on hangers and hooks on the left, helpfully ordered by colour.
Potter let out a miserable groan. “Fuck. Draco. Please listen, will you - just listen to me for a second?” Draco looked away from him, and into the cold grate of the fireplace. “How could I have known you wanted something like that? You always leave.”
Potter moaned theatrically. “Unf. There’s something about you when you’re barking orders, Malfoy.” That was about all Potter had time to say, because Draco had decided to shut him up directly with his tongue. Draco could feel Potter’s grin against his own lips, and so bit down, nipping Potter’s lower lip ever so slightly between sharp teeth, and grinning himself at the squawk of protest.
“Absolutely not,” Draco said, always contrary, and he rose suddenly, and straddled Harry’s hips. “I’m the sexy one in this relationship, and everybody knows there’s only one sexy person per couple.”
When Harry pressed his knuckles behind Draco’s balls, he gasped, and hitched one leg over the back of the settee in an effort to give Harry better reach. “Harry, please...where’s the remote, I don’t think I can come with Mary Berry watching.”
“Your magic is clearly back. You always enjoy cooking a little better when you don’t have to clean up by hand. I’ll bet you didn’t make yourself anything nicer than beans on toast, and...” Draco squinted, and sniffed. “Sausages.”
"I'll help you with this," he stated. There was another pause. They seemed unsure of what to say to one another, now.
Potter stuck his head round Draco’s door at half eleven. “Lunch plans?” He caught sight of the chaos, and swore. “Fucking hell, what happened in here?”
Draco started almost as badly as Weasley had. “Jesus Christ, Potter. What are you doing here?” The man himself was leaning inadvisably far back in Weasley’s guest chair, jammed in the corner and ready to ambush a person, and looking thoroughly amused. Draco sniffed, and tried very hard not to let on that his heart was hammering. “Last I checked, you didn’t work for the Aurors anymore.”
For all that Draco was a borderline genius at Potions and Alchemy, he was a fucking terrible cook. Well, to be fair, it wasn’t that he made anything inedible, it was just that nothing came out tasting quite the way it should, or it tasted alright but the texture was strange, or it looked almost too unpleasant to eat. And Harry, who was practically a public menace when he brewed, managed to be quite a natural chef, and he found a satisfaction in cooking for Draco that he’d certainly never felt cooking steak, egg and chips for the Dursley’s as a child. Draco, who had been cooked the finest house elf fare as a child, then the delicious comfort of the meals at Hogwarts, and who had dined at possibly nearly every posh restaurant in London, both wizarding and Muggle - Draco somehow seemed to love the food Harry made him, best.
“Tell me all about it, darling,” Draco said, and brought his chair around to squeeze them both onto the same side of the table, and they sat half turned in to each other, their knees pressed together.
Malfoy smirked. “I assumed you were already well aware of your brewing deficiencies, Potter. I’d be happy to schedule a daily reminder of all your flaws and weaknesses, though, if you’d find that helpful.”
“Merlin’s fucking beard, I was barely gone a minute…” Ginny folded her cards up in a neat movement. “Pass, christ. If we get another minus hand, Harry, I swear-”
Harry sighed, and squatted down until his backside met the next-to-last visible patch of flooring in the area. “God. Look. Technically, it’s called hoarding. I was seeing someone about it for a little while, like right after school. But I sort of stopped, therapy that is, not the hoarding, obviously, and the clutter got worse, and, well…”
Before he could over-think it any further, Harry stood, setting his now empty glass on the table with more force than was necessary. It was muggy now, and so he slipped the leather jacket off and hung it on the back of his chair. “Let’s get this over with.”
Malfoy’s words echoed in his head. Malfoy was sexy. Malfoy was basically sex personified. And Malfoy had awoken something in Harry, the moment he’d encountered him at the shop in Knockturn.
“May I introduce Amy,” Malfoy said. “Amy is easily the most anatomically accurate product on the market, and highly popular. A Muggle line, but like the King Dong you can obtain some optional upgrades; temperature, lubricant. There’s a charm to mimic the sensation of the vaginal walls clenching in climax.”
“Alright,” Draco said, scribbling in his pad. “I think this is how we should start. You should do a full spring clean of Teddy’s room, while I sort out this one, and I’ll make sure everything comes back to Hogwarts with me on Wednesday, and Minerva and Hooch will work out how it gets distributed. What do you think?”
The Friday following that, the pub was packed to the rafters, and there’d been a queue for the bogs that went on for nearly twenty minutes, and Harry would’ve fucked off back to the table, but he suspected if he didn’t stick it out now, when he was really in need of a piss later on, it’d be an even longer wait.
sentencing. To say the least. Rather than a term in Azkaban, the Wizengamot had seen fit to saddle him with a five year term as gamekeeper at Hogwarts. And the added clause that he was only allowed to use magic when dealing specifically with magical creatures - meaning, that all the grunt work was to be done by hand. The muggle way.
Malfoy pursed his lips, amused, as if he knew exactly what Harry was doing. “The chateaubriand is for two, but she had - an eclair…” Malfoy trailed off, noticing the potted flower on his desk. “Potter. Is this…?”
Devlin held the phial up to the light and watched the substance move thickly within. “It’s still warm.” He closed his fingers around the glass and nodded. “Right away, Mr Potter. Are the others...?”
“Good boy,” Draco said against his lips, and he bit down gently on Harry’s mouth. “Now. Let’s get you out of these pyjamas.”
Draco saw Potter freeze, and turn slightly grey in the face. The crowd clapped in congratulations, and flashbulbs popped and sparked from left and right as Scrivener threw an arm around Potter and pumped his hand vigorously while grinning like a loon for the cameras. Draco put his hands together and clapped along with the rest of them, aware of the nervous looks darting his way from his staff in the audience. As discreetly as possible, Draco disengaged from the crowd and made his way steadily across the pavilion, his eyes zeroing in on a small white door marked ‘STAFF ONLY’.
There was a knock at the door some time later, and Harry was surprised to see the time was nearly five o’clock. “Come in,” he called, poked one of the pens into a snarl of hair above his ear and grabbing his cup, grimaced and swallowed a bitter mouthful of now cold tea. Malfoy stepped into the office, silent but looking around with undisguised interest. He held a small paper carry bag.
“I can use unlined paper again,” Draco said dreamily. “I can wear purple. I can order the mixed platter of danish for staff meetings, and no one will make a fuss about the coffee scrolls.”
They fell into silence again, not uncomfortable. Draco could feel Potter watching him, and felt warm.
“That’s a skull, you complete-” he bit the inside of his own cheek to stop the rest of that sentence from exiting his mouth and ruining his chances of coming on Own-brand’s glasses later. “Listen, how would you fancy sucking me off?”
Malfoy walked beside him, but his eyes were straight ahead, and Harry could see his jaw was clenched.
They sat there, quiet, the tense feel of questions which were barely restrained blanketing them. Draco's mouth was dry. The program started. Potter's eyes reluctantly slid from Draco's form to the set. Time passed.
Harry did as told, not bothering to ask how an examination of his throat might reveal whether a curse affecting his magic was cured, or not. He’d long since given up questioning the methods of Healers and Mediwix. Healer Hosford was pointing his wand down Harry’s gullet, and a curl of orange steam seemed to be travelling slowly out, propelled by his long and lusty ‘aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah’. But the orange seemed a friendly colour, and Hosford didn’t seem alarmed by it, so Harry decided he wasn’t alarmed either.
Harry took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. He put them back on, stared at each of his friends in turn, then took them back off again and pressed the tips of his fingers into his eyes again as hard as he dared. “Are you telling me,” he asked wearily, “that there has been some sort of wager going on that I’d end up with Malfoy.”
Potter, to his credit, looked him in the eye. “Good. Very pleased to be alive, thanks to you. I think you’ll be getting Christmas shortbread and Easter buns from Molly for a couple of years or so, after this.”
“Not too much,” Potter said, returning to stand just beside Draco. “I’ll cast, but if you can add your magical energy to it, it’ll allow me to put a lot more punch behind it and find what we need faster.” He turned to face Draco. “Ever done this before?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Do you mean in this department, or in the universe generally?” They had made it to Draco’s office door. Fishing his wand from the sleeves of his robes, he released the lock, and huffed again when Potter followed him in and made himself at home on Draco’s guest chair. With deeply felt irritation, Draco removed his outer robe, hung it neatly on the hook beside the door, and took his own seat on the other side of the desk.
Except Draco. The Undersecretary had been in top form the previous evening, dripping wet and hopping mad, and yelling at Draco at the very top of his lungs for having the carelessness and lack of foresight not to install a safety fence around the perimeter of the Mermish Ambassador’s tank so that innocent guests like himself would not have to suffer the indignity of falling in and nearly drowning. There was no point in using logic to respond; Draco simply nodded, and accepted it. A fence would have effectively isolated the Ambassador of course, and no other guests had been
Good grief, he was going to do this, wasn’t he. He was going to confess all his sexual woes to Draco Malfoy, former schoolyard nemesis and current purveyor of sex toys. He had to, really. He needed some help.
“What sort of favour?” It didn’t actually matter, because Harry would definitely do it, whatever ‘it’ turned out to be. He’d follow Malfoy directly off a cliff if it came to that.
“Yeah, of course,” Potter repeated, and he squeezed Draco’s wrist once before letting go. “I know him from a while back. Later though, right?”
“Luna should probably stay as well as I’m not sure it’s a great idea for her to travel when she’s a bit effervescent. I know Rolf is responsible for her, but really, why take chances. I don’t know about you, but as far as I’m concerned anyone from work can fend for themselves,” Draco paused, his pen on his lower lip. “Having said that, if McGonagall does end up coming, we should set a room aside just in case - I mean, she’s a million years old, so she might go home before the sun even sets, but if she doesn’t, I don’t like the thought of her Flooing back on her own at her age. I’d die if she fell and broke a hip or something...hey. What’s wrong? What’s going on with your face?”
“Hi,” Harry said, breathlessly, as Malfoy stepped out gracefully and with hardly a spot of ash on him.
On the street, in front of the dark, grubby Purge and Dowse shopfront, Harry sighed, and tipped his head back.
Okay. Maybe this was what was missing with the other toys. The fantasy of being with someone else, or having them watch him. If he imagined Malfoy sitting on the end of the bed, looking -
Holy fuck. Harry had never got so far as that, at least not anywhere other than in the privacy of his own fantasies. He’d snogged a handful of men, a Healer at one of Hermione’s Christmas parties, the broom tech from the Harpies after a tense World Cup qualifier a few years back. Charlie Weasley, just once, at the Burrow. Nothing more than a brief pash and some over the trousers groping, each time.  “I don’t know. I don’t know what I like. I’ve only imagined it.”
“I don’t know what’s so funny,” Draco glared at him. “You’re wearing team colours too, practically everyone here is.”
Potter's hand was firm and warm against the small of his back. He led him off the stage, through back passages until they were out in the normal Ministry corridors again, and heading for the big, brown door that would let them leave. A crowd of wizards surged out behind them. So many people, all turned out to see his review. It was amazing what the name Malfoy could still do for ones reputation. It would always be this way. Draco would be first and foremost a Malfoy. Not a war hero, no, never that. Not a philanthropist, should he chose to be, or a friend, should he make one. He'd be a Malfoy. A dangerous criminal from a long line of dangerous criminals. Death Eater family on both sides of his tree, more relatives former residents of Azkaban than not. What was he supposed to do, now? He may have resented his sentence, but at least it had given him purpose, something to rely upon and fight against, something to keep the angry fire burning in his belly to fuel his mind and spirit. What was his purpose now? Where did he belong? What was he meant to do with his life, now?
“Why are we all whispering?” Draco didn’t need to, but he half turned anyway and found Potter standing behind them, calmly eating a pumpkin pasty. There were crumbs all the way down the front of his robes. Draco’s fingers twitched.
here. But he didn't say it. Instead Draco sat stiffly, itchy and hot, and glad that the room was dark except for the telly, and that Potter probably wouldn't be able to see how pink his face was.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “She’s not still - for goodness sake.” He held out the card again. “I’ve got plenty of money, I don’t need free drinks from her.”
“Well, yes Potter. I mean, it's not like some of them aren't a bit embarrassed at first, but it’s an important question to know the answer to. I don’t want anyone hurting themselves on something enormous just because they’re a bit shy about admitting they haven’t had more than a finger back there before. Besides, a happy customer is a repeat customer, so I want them to enjoy their new toy, and come back for something more advanced when they’re ready.” Malfoy grinned at him. “Don’t worry Potter, I’m very gentle on the first timers.” Malfoy pulled the dildo all the way out of Amy with a soft pop. “Enough?”
“On the contrary, it’s now more important than ever that I put you in your place. You’re representing our family, it’s my responsibility to make sure you don’t disgrace us, by applying regular, yet light bullying. Honestly, I don’t know that I understand the point of marriage if one is not supposed to verbally spar with ones intended.” Draco leaned forward to kiss him gently on the cheek. “So, I’m gone for less than one day, and you get yourself hexed half to bits, and you destroy the whole house. Have you eaten?”
Harry gazed wide eyed at the big pot of tea, his favorite earl grey blend by the smell of it, positioned right next to a large jug of orange juice, pips floating on the surface and sticky fingerprints all over the glass. Beside both of them was a giant punch bowl, filled with what looked like the sliced remains of thirty bananas, an entire vine of grapes, whole strawberries, some with the little green bits still on top, and irregularly shaped chunks of apple, peach and pear. And a platter of toast, some of the bottom slices looking suspiciously dark. Draco had even set the table, using all the best silverware and china that he'd inherited from his parents, cut-glass goblets, linen napkins rolled in silver napkin rings.
The ninth time Harry approached Malfoy, he didn’t greet him, or even attempt to ask; he didn’t let Malfoy get a single word out. He simply advanced on Malfoy, and didn’t stop, even when Malfoy’s eyes went wide, and he scrambled backwards, and eventually bumped right into the stone of the wall.
The bloke beside him was enormous in a weird, bodybuilding, probably-has-a-shrunken-cock-from-all-the-‘roids sort of way. Yellow blond hair on top of a head as round as a cabbage and pink as a thrice slapped arse. Blue eyes, ugh. “Don’t flatter yourself,” Cabbage Head snorted. “‘M’not bent. Just asking, since you seem so thingy about it.”
. I’ve never heard a breath of scandal. There’s never once been a leaked naughty photo, or an exposé from a former lover.” Malfoy’s eyes felt like they were looking straight through him. “What’s that about?”
Potter looked irate. “Malfoy, I swear to god I’m going to really lose my temper with you in a minute.”
“I haven’t any plans,” Malfoy said, casually flicking the cap off the tube. “Frankly, this is the most interesting thing to happen to me all week. Are there any rules against having an observer in the lab?”
Potter shook his head. "No. I imagine kicking you out and leaving you homeless would be somewhat of a dampener on the possibility of getting another kiss out of you. And, I'd miss you a lot."
It wasn't really a question; or at least, it didn’t seem like Malfoy was in any doubt as to the answer. Martin was only too happy to step aside and usher Mr Malfoy and his guest right through, ignoring the catcalls and boos from the unhappy queuers left relegated to the chilly street for a while longer. Inside, the foyer smelled like every bar Harry had ever been to, Muggle or magical; a musty combination of stale cigarette, beer, and disinfectant. Malfoy stopped briefly at the ticket window and exchanged air kisses with a woman he called Darling. She beckoned Harry over and both he and Malfoy were duly stamped on the wrist with the club logo in vivid pink ink.
Potter shifted up Draco’s thighs onto Draco’s lap, and he half sat to meet Potter’s mouth in a bruising kiss. His mouth was warm and savoury from the beer and gravy, his lips hard against Draco’s, devouring each other, their fingers in each other’s hair - Potter’s a curly wreck of silky tangles that felt like heaven under Draco’s hands.
“Dickinson, you’re in charge of cream buns. Nothing with coconut, or orange rind. Jam is fine, with or without icing, but if you go
He could start projects at work and actually finish them, and almost nobody ever died on his cases anymore, and he got eight hours of sleep without even really trying very hard these days. It was comforting to know that the tribulations of a relationship would not disrupt Harry’s tranquil, if mundane, life. He didn’t have to negotiate what to watch on telly, or buy shampoo as well as body wash (it’s all just soap, really, so why not use shampoo on everything?), or argue about whether Orange Tango was really better than Fanta (which it obviously was).
Draco decided it probably wouldn’t actually kill any elves if he shouted, since they were normally accustomed to being screamed at anyway. “Get out.” They vanished with a collective squeak. Potter hesitated at the door, and Draco rolled his eyes. “Not
“I wanted to be fucked. By a man.” He quickly raised his glass to his lips and swallowed a large mouthful of mead, trying to work out whether to look at Malfoy or not.
Malfoy went directly to the fridge without needing to be shown, and unpacked several items from his bag, which Harry couldn’t quite see, and wasn’t game to get any closer to take a look at. Malfoy was dressed more casually than he’d been at work. His shirt was light and loose, maybe linen - it looked cool, cooler than Harry’s tshirt, which was starting to stick to his back.
gold cauldron, but the others had to go (and for a moment, Harry’d thought Draco might go off on one again when he discovered there was
holes, was surreptitiously lifting his shirt away from his chest, as if to benefit from some additional air flow. His trousers were a dark blue, with a crisp, pressed line right down the centre of each leg. Malfoy looked very good in blue. Harry looked mostly like he lived under a bridge.
Draco hesitated a beat. “I’ll swap you some wine gums for a couple of the orange creams. I’ve also got Skips.”
“Hey.” Malfoy slotted in beside him, and Harry choked only very lightly on his drink. “You alright?”
Malfoy Transfigured some pebbles from a potted cactus into lovely stone benches for sitting, and tables for putting drinks down on. This was his element, complex charmwork. The stuff Harry never had the patience for, nevermind the aptitude. Harry just fetched more stones according to Malfoy’s specifications, and moved the seating from one spot to another as Malfoy worked out the optimal configuration. He was sweatier than ever by the time they were done, and used his tshirt to wipe his face.
“With a strapping young massage therapist? He has magic fingers, Harry.” Ginny wiggled hers in his face with glee. “
“Yeah,” Harry said, then laughed with relief. “Yes. I’m not just saying that either, because I’m cursed to tell the truth right now.” Draco shifted and pulled out his wand. “What are you doing?”
here, with Harry, to touch him, to tell him he was so pretty, his pretty little tits and his pretty little mouth, and fuck, shit,
Harry made a face. “What are you talking about? It’s only been about twenty minutes.” Ginny picked up her paper serviette and covered her face, making a weird hooting sound that might have been laughter.
Draco frowned. “Potter accused me of wearing it on Finnegan’s behest. Tell me what that’s all about.”
Draco rubbed the back of his neck. “I don’t...sleep around. I believe in,” Draco cleared his throat. “Romance. Monogamy. Building something that lasts.”
Harry sat squashed between Dawlish and some other auror on the Knight Bus-style minivan that had so far carted their tired, sorry arses across Britain for seven days. And thought wistfully about crumpets with honey, and Draco. It was the going away parts that made him want to just pack in the Auror business entirely and live off his inheritance, never leaving Draco's side, never even leaving the house if he didn't want to. He'd wanted to be an Auror since he was a kid, and he loved his job, but being away from Draco
“That ship has sailed, Harry. You should have heard him going on, on Monday night. ‘Why doesn’t Malfoy think I’m the hottest Weasley? Do you think I should work on my arms more, or do more squats?’ Honestly.”
Harry looked from Ron, to the cock, and back again several times. “You want me to… interfere with a piece of evidence, one that was recently buried under a quantity of well fertilised soil, and before that had Merlin knows what done to it?”
Harry could feel his face getting hot. This bit was the part he was most worried about. Malfoy’s favourite take-away breakfast, easy. Taking care of the shittiest part of their job, easy. Lunch somewhere posh, especially on the wizarding-only service day, easy. This, though.
Draco’s mouth went dry, and he took a sip of tea before he spoke. It burned the roof of his mouth. “Actually, sir, I think Perkins would be better suited. She has the greater knowledge of runespoor-based poisons, and they’re going to need our best on this one.”
The helmet jolted abruptly to life and proceeded to deliver an almighty pulse directly to his crown, and it was absolutely far too much. Harry fumbled with the switch, and when blessedly still, carefully removed the cursed thing and flicked it directly off the end of the bed and onto the floor, tossing the lackluster wanking sleeve after it. He lay back for a moment, panting and staring at the plaster mouldings on his ceiling. That really hadn’t gone quite how he thought it would.
“I barely saw him, for like five seconds the year before we -” Draco coughed. “I can’t remember. But fine, we can get rid of those. Absolutely no sentimental value there. I can hardly remember him actually. What’s his name again?” Harry backed Draco against the gilded chair. “Stop that. Harry no, it's dusty. Mmmph. What did I tell you, we can’t shag every time we have a disagreement!”
“I love you,” Harry said, casting Lumos as powerfully as he could in the dim eaves of the house. “Just try to remember that, alright?”
“I am touching you,” Potter’s voice was throaty in his ear, and his infuriating hands wandered across Draco’s thighs, traced maddening circles into the sensitive skin so close to his balls that Draco wanted to scream. “Do you want me to stop?”
“A greater height,” Harry rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I know, mate. Malfoy was ready to commit murder this morning, though, and it was incredibly loud. He stormed into my room in his knickers to chew me out about it.”
Potter grinned at him. “Oh, have a day off, honestly.” Potter kissed him, and Draco’s eyes drooped closed again, and his heartbeat quickened. “As the second most senior person in this department-”
“Potter, I’m suddenly feeling rather exhausted.” Draco licked his lips, and kept his eyes on Potter’s mouth. Red. Wet. “I think perhaps you should escort me home.”
They decided on only a smallish number of balloons, because Harry admitted that balloons and birthdays were basically inseparable in his mind, but the fairy lights were so wonderful that he didn’t want too many, as they might get in the way. Malfoy Conjured them in a riot of colours, and sent them floating up to the plaster medallions with long, silver ribbons, to bob around beside the little gold dots of light.
done it, and called him friend…Draco stepped forward too, clumsily, and pressed his mouth against Potter's. He closed his eyes and kissed, very softly, his heart pounding and his mind whirling, trying to make sense of what he was doing here.
Harry could feel Malfoy’s pulse under his fingertips. His wrists were blood hot. “Yeah,” Harry said, low. “And a tie.”
Draco swallowed, and made a decision. He was going to have to make up with Potter, for Ted’s sake. Obviously, they were never going to sleep together again, not after all that had happened to date, but they couldn’t fight anymore, either. He’d told Granger he would be there for Teddy, and he meant that, and being there for his cousin meant being on good terms with his godfather. There was too much at stake to fuck up just because of some hurt feelings on his part. The child had suffered more than his share, and Draco’s mother and aunt had put a lot of work into repairing more than twenty years of estrangement. He wouldn’t be the undoing of all of that. He said he was trying to make better choices, and be a better man, and this was one of those times.
“Okay, so I’m a bit hungover then, and it seemed like a reasonable move,” Draco made unconvincing agreeing noises as he unlocked his office door. “I
“It would never stick. For a start, you tried to steal food from the very mouth of the Saviour of the Wizarding World. Secondly, you clearly broke into my private home in order to do so. I think I could have
Ron snorted around several fried mushrooms. “We went slowly alright. We didn’t go at all for years and years, and then we freed some house elves in the middle of a battle, and then all of a sudden we went
Harry’s arms came immediately around Draco’s waist, across his chest. “Is this alright for you?” He was hot against Draco’s back. He could feel Harry’s cock, heavy and soft, pressed along the cleft of his arse, and his knees tucked in behind Draco’s. The hair on his thighs scratched the back of Draco’s own thighs.
Draco nodded. “That was precisely the point. I wanted to invoke memories of childhood. Swimming in the Hogwarts lake, that sort of thing.”
Malfoy led Harry to a corner alcove, just big enough to fit three at a squeeze on a battered leather bench, and with a small table. Even so, Harry was painfully conscious of where Malfoy’s limbs were located, though Malfoy seemed not to notice.
at it Potter? Gonna report back to the Ministry about how fabulously unprepared I am for muggle living, and how much of a wonderful punishment this is for me? Just add it to your regular weekly report card Potter -
Draco lifted his flannel to his face, rubbing it over his neck and chin, before dropping it back into the water. They hardly spoke, not that there was any anger between them. Draco spent the hours of the day reading, books about potions and old family histories. It was indulgent, and he was contributing nothing to Potter's household. But Potter never asked anything of him, not even for company, although Draco could see that Potter would have dearly liked his company. And Draco never gave him anything, except a sort of silent companionship, which seemed to please Potter in some small way - almost as if he were just glad Draco hadn't left entirely. Draco had never said thank you. But he wanted to. He thought about it during most of his spare time. He composed things he might say, in his head, and what Potter might say back, and what his face might look like while they talked. He thought often of Potter's face. And Potter's hands. Draco lifted his own hands out of the water, and held the pruny fingers in front of his eyes, frowning. His fingers had always been long, and slender, and slightly pointed and aristocratic, like the rest of him. They were roughened now, a little, from the work at Hogwarts. But Potter's fingers were stronger. They looked capable of anything. Draco lowered his hands and let them disappear below the surface. He'd found himself looking at Potter's hands rather too often as well.
It was strange, for them to live so quietly together, after seven years of fury and noise and curses and rivalry.
“This hard,” he said softly, and then pressed Harry’s hand between his legs. Harry groaned and squeezed him through his robes, and Draco let him for a wild moment before he firmly pushed Harry down into the bedding, and levered himself back off the mattress. “No more. I can’t go to work with come on my trousers, and there’s no time to change again.”
“You enjoy pushing your tongue in, tasting her, opening her lips to get your mouth around her clit and sucking it?” Malfoys lips were so soft, barely brushing against his ear, just behind it.
There was a Playstation, and a Playstation 2, and an XBOX, and a Wii. Two brand new Dyson’s, the models now obsolete. A set of three non-stick frying pans, a vegan cookbook, a salad spinner still in the box. There was a chest - a big one - that was crammed full of baby clothing, things he’d bought for Ted when he was little, then for Rosie and Hugo, but had never given them. There was a camp chair. A tent. A box of Halloween decorations. There were three boxes of the same dinner setting, Christmas patterned. Every Muggle board game ever manufactured. A kite. Another, bigger kite. A model kit for a Ford Anglia. A full set of luggage in a horrible yellow. Worse, though…
Blaise rubbed a soothing hand on Draco’s back. “Deep breaths, please. It’s time to be rational about this. You know our lot will always default to self-preservation mode, never be vulnerable, all that. I just think, this time…” Draco looked up from where his head had been clutched in clammy hands, and Blaise smiled encouragingly. “You’re in love with him, he’s in love with you - why not give it a chance?”
“Alright,” Draco said, and Potter kissed him again with his Earl Grey mouth. With those few words, the mood had changed, and it was no longer just another one of their tussles, a flirtation disguised ever more thinly by bickering; with every kiss and touch, Potter was asking Draco to believe in him, and Draco did his best to tell him ‘yes’ with clutching fingers and gasped breaths. He moved down Draco’s body, eyes closed, his hair a sweaty black tangle at his nape and brow. Where his glasses were now was a mystery, as Draco had not even noticed Potter taking them off. Draco forced himself to watch Potter, fighting his instinct to let his eyes droop closed. Potter’s mouth was red and wet, delivering sucks and bites down the length of Draco’s torso, his hands following where his lips had been, and when he sucked on the skin in the hollow of Draco’s hip, he thought he may very well die of it. Death by Potter. Draco wouldn’t mind if it happened this way. He may not have the distinction of being the first wizard to die by Potter’s hand, but he might be the first to die by Potter’s mouth.
Draco patted Harry’s bum twice, then a third time, which was more of a slap. “Come on, lover boy. Help clean me up before we get any more come on the cushions.”
“One thing at a time, Potter. Let’s get through the engagement party first, before we worry about holding up that particular marriage vow.”
. I declare today a Department of Magical Games and Sport holiday, and therefore have dismissed all staff still at the office. No exceptions.” Without dropping Draco’s hand, he used his forefinger to poke Draco in the chest. “That’s you. You’re the last staff member at the office.”
“What’s the matter, Harry?” Hermione’s hand was gentle on his wrist, his fingers tight around the knob of the gear stick.
“Rubbish,” Draco lied. “You’re paranoid.” Potter’s fingers were so hard on his hips, he was going to leave marks. Draco’s cock was thick in his jeans. “I just changed rotation. Not everything is about you.”
Harry turned abruptly on his heel, scowl deepening, and strode with purpose to his satchel which hung from a hook near the door. He fished around until he laid his hands on his mobile, and again until he came up with Draco Malfoy’s business card.  He tapped in the number and tried not to wheeze as he waited for Malfoy to pick up.
Ginny laughed. She was incredibly loud, incredibly confident. He was reminded every time he saw her of why two thirds of the boys at Hogwarts had fancied her, and about a third of the girls as well. “Ah, I forgot you were such an awkward penguin, Malfoy. You’re allowed to call me Ginny, you know. You won’t lose any hard bastard cred if you do.” She always made him feel a bit stupid, so he just made a noise of acknowledgement rather than bother to answer. “My brother’s eldest is on one of the teams. She’s not very good, bless her, but that’s not the point of these things, is it?” She gave him a sideways look. “How are your bogeys, these days?” Draco was unable to help rubbing his hand across his nose, and she laughed again. “A little bird told me you weren’t coming.”
“You can probably start using the spell, now,” Harry told Ron that morning. He had eggs today, scrambled, maybe seven of them, drowned in a lake of brown sauce.
Malfoy set down his tea, and counted off on his fingers. “You’re not a virgin, nor have you taken religious orders. But you’re also seemingly celibate, and you clearly found our business in the lab completely overwhelming. By your own description, you do absolutely nothing but work, visit your childhood friends, and wash your knickers. Now, as much as fifteen year old me would have found this wildly entertaining, I’m not him anymore, and you have a garden full of cocks you need to sort out. So why don’t you come out with me on Saturday night, have a bit of a drink and a dance, see if someone might snog you, and break the ice a little?”
Potter’s face was thunderous throughout the briefing. Well, throughout the portion he was able to attend, anyway.
Draco strode brusquely along the corridor, hardly pausing except to reach out a hand to adjust a lopsided ornament or a crooked garland of holly on his way past. Celestina Warbeck’s latest Christmas album piped softly though the entire floor, through the whole Ministry as far as Draco could tell, and he thought perhaps that if he heard another chorus of
“Please don’t finish that thought or sentence,” Harry said, alarmed. “Look, I know it's annoying, but he’s not doing it
Draco raised a hand to his lips, pressing his fingers to them in near confusion - had Potter really just kissed him?
“First of all, I’m no such thing,” Draco said, poking Harry hard in the side where he knew he was ticklish, and Harry promptly spilled cold water down his front. “Potter, mind the sheets! And secondly, I think you’ll find my mother accurately predicted that I’d grow up to be the most handsome boy at Hogwarts, so you’ve hardly made a groundbreaking discovery.”
of pressure from above to get this sorted as a top priority. Throttlebottom is already on the warpath with me since I ‘belligerently refused’ to assign the case to Shacklebolt, and haven’t put those C.U.M. clowns in Azkaban yet. Shacklebolt’s actual job as the leader of Wizarding society in Britain is of no concern to him, nor is the fact that C.U.M. have been completely ruled out as suspects.”
“Malfoy.” Weasley sat down in the chair opposite Draco, at the horrible bar off Diagon, and immediately balked. “This place is dead posh. My god, these chairs are grim. Five seconds in, and my arse is already cramping!”
, a swell of magic of some kind, but I can’t quite place it. Doesn’t feel Dark, or unusual. It feels like…” Potter trailed off, as if unsure how to describe it, and instead collected several feathers from the straw and beams. “This will help with my Tracing Charm.” He gestured with his chin at the cluster of Keepers, watching them from the door of the lean-to. “We should get going. Nothing more we can gain here.”
“Ms Parsnip, you do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so, but I must warn you that if you fail to mention any fact which you rely on in your defence in court, your failure to take this opportunity to mention it may be treated in court as supporting any relevant evidence against you. If you do wish to say anything, what you say may be given in evidence.” Draco gestured around them. “Did you abduct these owls?”
Shacklebolt entered the office with what seemed like a single stride, and leaned both hands on Harry’s desk. Harry resisted the urge to lean backward with some difficulty. “Do you have any idea how many times the Chief Warlock has personally visited my office to bother me about this case, Potter?” Harry opened his mouth, but Shacklebolt did not wait for his answer. “The answer is ‘too many’, Potter. I had thought I had impressed upon our Head Auror the urgency with which I would prefer this case to be investigated, and he had assured me that he had communicated this to you. Perhaps I was not sufficiently clear.” Harry swallowed, and Shacklebolt loomed over him. “Sort it out. Reassign whatever you have to, and take care of this personally, and immediately.”
“...Special.” Harry felt drunk with want, and gripped Malfoy’s hips hard. “Malfoy. You’re kissing my neck.”
The door to Potter’s office was open, so Draco rapped his knuckles thrice on the door frame, and stepped inside.
Draco had been right about his stamina. The fairy lights were still twinkling, and the balloons were still floating.
“Don’t care,” Draco said, one hand raised to shush him, the other lifting the last of his drink to his mouth.
“So,” Malfoy said eventually. “Things got a bit weird in there, Potter. I’d go so far as to say you had a bit of a turn.”
Seven o'clock had come that morning - after all the other hours had passed on the face of the clock, one by one, while Draco watched. He didn't move from his place on the bed, knees drawn up to his chest. At just after eight, like always, Potter rose, and this time paused outside Draco's door for a long moment before moving past. Draco's throat constricted almost until he couldn't breathe. He pulled the duvet over his head and squeezed his eyes closed.
This was true even when Draco was a little bit heavy, and his bloody pointy elbow was jabbing Harry in tender places.
“Well,” Malfoy seemed genuinely pleased to tell him more. “It’s triggered as the customer enters the shop; if they’re alone, they see no one else until an attendant approaches them, but if they’ve come with a companion, then they can still see that person – or, persons, as the case may be. But they can’t see any other customer. The staff-” Malfoy raised a tapered finger to point out several moving figures who were neatly dressed in sensible black robes with ‘Ocard’ embroidered in simple white stitching across the chest. “They can see everyone, and each other, but can only be seen by the customer they’re serving at any given time – otherwise you’d have the unnerving experience of seeing attendants all over the place speaking to thin air, and that’s not very conducive to shopping for a ball gag, is it.” Thankfully, that seemed to be a rhetorical question, as Harry really wouldn’t know a thing about the proper etiquette for shopping for a ball gag, nor any other kind of adult product. Considering the number of people in the shop, he was starting to think perhaps he might be the only wizard in London who hadn’t.
He wasn’t sure if he nodded, or said yes, or if Malfoy just decided to come in regardless. He carried a cake plate, and on top sat two, fat little cupcakes, one with a candle in it.
“Fantastic,” Harry said, looking forward to this being over. Hosford started to pack up his bag, and Harry re-buttoned his shirt. “So, is it common for Healers to make house calls?”
“I’ll do that for you, mate,” Ron said eagerly. “Actually, let me call ‘Mione now and get her onto it, and I’ll get mum to do an extra cake this year, one for your place, and then one for the family do on the weekend. I’ll be right back,” Ron stood, then pointed at both of them. “Don’t touch my beer.”
, allowing the buck of his hips to provide the friction and the sheen of butter and Draco's own sticky wetness provide the lube. It was terribly inelegant, he could feel oily butter dripping onto his balls and the buckle of his trousers digging into his thighs, and the jug of orange juice wobbling dangerously on the table, and Draco whining in his pleasure. He couldn't hold onto his orgasm, it didn't want to wait, it wanted to rocket out of his dick at record velocity and paint the top of Draco's skull with its spray. He trembled and came, pulsing and jerking upwards, unable to do anything other than groan deeply and twitch. Draco wasn't far behind, hot come splattering onto Harry's chest, staining his shirt, and he felt so good he wouldn't have been surprised if he was completely unable to walk later on. Draco continued to ride him, bucking erratically, a seemingly endless outpouring of seed wrung from his prick. Eventually he stopped, slumped forward into Harry's chest and his own spunk, and drew a shaky breath.
Twenty minutes later, Harry stepped into the shower behind Draco, who was still rinsing out some sort of hair mask. He plastered himself against the wet warmth of Draco’s back.
“A considerate person would piss against the porcelain, not directly down into the water like a fucking animal.”
“Would you prefer if someone else were riding him, instead?” Her voice was carefully mild, but Ron huffed a laugh directly into his drink, and splattered his cards with fruit punch.
“Nope, it can all go,” Harry said, determinedly. “And no, not all the rooms will be this easy. I made sure I only kept the free Quidditch kit in this one, nothing that was personal. I was trying to be organised.”
“Couples therapy? Before we’ve even made it down the aisle?” Draco’s voice was light, but Harry knew him better than that. “Do you think that’s a bad omen?”
He paused at the sink - last chance for Potter to do it. Potter remained quiet. Eyes downcast, Draco made for the door, already grinding his teeth and clenching his fists until the nails bit into his palm. He should have thanked Potter for cooking lunch, but he already knew he wasn't much chop with thank-yous.
check this morning, could you let Devlin know?” Vicky unlocked a battered filing cabinet which had been squeezed with some difficulty into the space between her counter and the wall, and lifted out a shallow bowl which looked something like a miniature Pensieve. Harry tapped his wand against the lip, and all of the collected words tumbled back out, gathering themselves into their correct order before floating gently away into the slightly cloudy depths of the bowl. “Ta. I’ll be in my office going over those files until half-ten, then I’ll be in the lab working on the cursed toasters if anybody’s looking for me.”
Draco barely had time to wipe his wet hands on a nearby washcloth, before Bog was gone and the folded note was fluttering to the floor. His Seeker skills were not completely rusty, and he managed to snatch it up before it fell victim to a puddle of sparkling wine on the tile beside the tub.
“No idea,” Harry said, and grinned, and Draco grinned back. “Good party. Well done. We’d have had chipolatas and one bottle of Ouzo between us if it had been left up to me.”
The knock that followed was so soft, that Harry almost hadn’t heard it. He leaned up on one elbow, and pushed his glasses back on to be sure he was seeing what he thought he was. Malfoy at his bedroom door.
“I’ve actually got some things shrunk in my pocket, just in case. I could always stay at a hotel, if it’s any impos-”
“Something funny?” Potter’s voice sounded strained, and he drew back from Draco, almost to the very edge, before driving back in with a grunt.
“Standard approach tactic, non-lethal force, contain and apprehend. You good to lead?” Draco nodded. “Right. I have your back. Shall we?”
“Breathing, Potter,” Malfoy was laughing at him, his shoulders shaking gently. “You must remember to keep breathing.” Harry did as he was told and inhaled noisily, his eyes wide. He’d certainly imagined Malfoy keeping it up, and now he couldn’t
The kitchen was cold and quiet. Harry made toast, and after a moment of hesitation, smushed some cold, leftover risotto over the top. He supposed he might have heated it on the stove without magic, but he was far too hungry to wait that long, and he had no idea where the matches might be. Draco’s notebook -
“I’ve already put down everyone I can think of, so I’ll read them out and you stop me if you have any objections.” Draco smoothed the paper out, and Harry sighed heavily, and tipped a ladle of broth over the rice. “Mum, Auntie A, and Tedward. Molly and Arthur, Bill, Fleur and the kids, Hot Weasley-”
“Shush,” Harry let Draco shut him up with a hand over his mouth. “Fool. As charming as I usually find our mutual bullying, I’m trying to be serious and I
Harry turned around when Ron didn’t answer, and found him wedging the last triangle of Harry’s toast into his already crammed mouth, looking only slightly ashamed of himself. “Wathabou ith I mathe yoo Heth Auler?”
And then Potter was closer, looming, his face just a puff of breath away from Draco, then not even that far, and there were lips, a kiss - Potter's lips pressed so very gently against his own, warm and soft, spicy with the taste of lamb and gravy. Draco's heart was pounding, and he was frozen, staring into Potter's eyes, which were staring back at him. Perhaps this was how Potter had felt, last night, when Draco kissed him so abruptly.
.” Draco could only stare at Potter. Speaking was out of the question; firstly, what would he say, and secondly, he was fairly certain his blush was nearing combustible proportions, and it was very important to concentrate on
Potter arranged himself beside Draco on the rug. Draco could only look at him, a dozen clever remarks ripe in his thoughts and ready to be delivered with a smirk – but instead, Draco just looked at Potter, and Potter smiled at him, white toothed and red cheeked, sweaty and sticky with come, and desperately attractive. Draco smiled back, and hardly spared a thought for how sweaty and come-streaked he was himself. Potter found his spectacles, abandoned in the heat of the moment by Draco’s dustbin, and finally disentangled his wristwatch from his shirtsleeve. He propped his head up on one hand, and just looked at Draco in silence. Eventually, he moved his hand to brush a dampened segment of hair from Draco’s forehead, murmuring something about a hair out of place.
“Yeah,” Harry said, and took a deep breath. “Okay, so, this isn’t just me trying to stall for time, but I don’t think we can get through this in time. I mean, this is the weekend before the party, we still haven’t had the elf service in, and I haven’t bought a single posh soap.” Christ, he was panicking again, but Draco squeezed his hand and didn’t loosen it.
“Ouff, yesssss,” Ginny rubbed her hands together, as Hermione took the pasta salad out of the fridge. “I was hoping you’d make this, Harry.”
Draco still felt as if he were underwater, at the bottom of the Hogwarts lake, or somewhere equally as deep and cold and dark. Harry was speaking to him in soothing tones, but the words were muffled, and far away. There were people all around them, flashbulbs bursting brightly in his face every now and again. He thought he could hear them shouting, the press; calling out for a quote please Mister Malfoy, and turn this way if you would Mister Malfoy, and what are your plans now that you're free?
“High fashion is an investment, Blaise knows that, even though he’ll try to scoff. Also, it cost you a disgusting amount of money, which will wind him up for other reasons.”
Hermione coughed into her mineral water, and Ron put down his knife and fork and pushed his plate away from him, eyes closed and a grim expression on his face. Ginny’s mouth was open. “Harry James Potter. You dirty boy.”
But it was impossible not to think of him. This was all Malfoy’s doing, and Malfoy was so fucking gorgeous. He thought Harry was gorgeous. Harry actually felt a bit gorgeous, for the first time in his life. If Malfoy was here, Harry would bet he would be telling him what to do. Harry would like to give him a show, not that he was sure he knew how. Harry looked at his face in the mirror, let his eyes wander down his torso to his cock. He shifted his feet, widened his thighs - yes, that looked good, the light a mellow gold behind him. His cock was wet and slipped between the tight circle of his fist. He tipped his head back, watched the tendons flex in the warm light. He felt so hard in his own hand, his hand felt so good on his prick. He bit his lip, and that felt good too, he looked good doing it. Sultry.
“I’m giving serious thought to quitting the Corps, and throwing my hat in the ring for one of the teaching jobs at Hogwarts.” Harry snapped the wooden chopsticks to separate them, and picked up the biggest piece of beef he could manage in one go. “I could consult part time, the same sort of deal Robards offered Draco.”
“We're not dead, Potter. I’m not sure if anybody’s reminded you of this recently, but you’re young and attractive. You should put on something tight and go out and find someone who’ll take it all back off you again, preferably with their teeth.” At that, Harry choked slightly on his tea and spent several minutes coughing into a hastily Conjured hanky. Malfoy watched him calmly until he’d caught his breath again. “So the idea of a casual pull caused you to inhale your beverage. Potter, I have to ask - are you…?” Malfoy cocked one eyebrow at Harry and left the rest unsaid.
Ginny’s face was making a complicated expression, as she seemingly struggled to contain herself. “And Malfoy was in the shop, was he?”
“Huh,” Harry said, surprised despite himself. The dong really was a very different temperature, not cold as such, but definitely not the human-warm of the cock bush. He lifted the King Dong closer to his face for a better look, while simultaneously reaching towards the lab door. Malfoy turned at the noise, and Harry’s Conjured whiteboard lumbered in and set itself down nearby the bench. With the dong still in his left hand, Harry tapped his fingertips against the spell analysis chart, and slid the undulating blue line representing Gemino out of the grid and onto its own segment. “Okay, so that’s the
“Shit!” Harry turned away from the carnage, startled. “What are you doing home? I told Ron not to call you.”
“Shut it,” Harry said, low, looking over at Malfoy’s closed door. “He was threatening violence, I’ll have you know.”
Once Draco was done serving his food, he plopped down into the chair next to Harry and began buttering toast for himself.
“Even if I come,” Draco stopped when the elf arrived with his gin, and took a desperate sip. “Even if I come this time, what am I supposed to do in five years, when I’m at Ted’s birthday and Potter rolls up with his perfect little wife? And when Ted graduates, and there they are with their perfect children. And I’ll be there with the Dark Mark, married to my work, and
Malfoy shrugged and picked up his tea again. “Why not? Someone needs to do it. You can’t tell me that Granger hasn’t tried to get you back out there.” Hermione most certainly had. Ginny, too. But the idea of going out, looking for a shag, with his well meaning best friend and/or equally well meaning ex girlfriend looking on supportively, occasionally pushing him towards some likely target, was just - it was far too much pressure.
At the bottom of the stairs, he pressed his hand hard to the centre of his chest. “You killed a Basilisk when you were twelve. You stole a dragon from Gringotts. You killed
Ginny seems terribly pleased about something. “I was just going to get myself a little something sweet, as it happens, so you can have my seat, Malfoy.” She stands, and takes Harry’s face in her hands. For an alarming minute, Harry thinks she’s actually going to kiss him, and then she does, planting a peck on top of his head. “Be good, Harrybob Potterpants.”
idiot, thanks.” Potter turned his infuriatingly charming smile on him. Draco sipped his drink determinedly.
it. He'd just tried to pretend it wasn't there, until he couldn't, and when he couldn't he'd tried to pretend it was something else. Admiration, appreciation, loneliness - maybe some sort of life-debt, or something. Just not the kind of
“I’ll be right there with you, Potter. I won’t let anything happen that you don’t enthusiastically consent to. All I’m suggesting is that you look.”
The last time Draco slept with Potter, he felt his heart swell with emotion. He knew what that feeling was. He’d known for a while. It had been manageable before, and he’d thought it could remain so, but it hadn’t taken much to break him in the end. Just a few moments of affection. He’d immediately leapt to the conclusion that Potter felt something more as well. He was mistaken.
up,” she dropped the memo onto his desk. “But I’m pushing back on this one. He outranks you, and he’s Harry fucking Potter, scary bastard.”
“I think these would look nice in the hallway, up near the ceiling,” Malfoy said, still looking up. “The sitting room as well. What do you think?”
“I know why,” Blaise said, knowingly. “Potter likes him. Draco wants to send him some pictures that’ll make up for whatever fool thing he went and said last night.”
Later, the garden was full of all his friends, and all of the Aurors he liked from work. Dean worked out how to get the stereo to work with his iPod, and there was music under the trees and among the flowers. He didn’t need to hold Draco’s hand the whole time, but he wanted to, yet they hadn’t discussed telling people, so they made do with brushing past each other frequently, and looking at each other constantly. Harry had looked at Draco so long and intensely, that Draco had actually started to blush, and laugh into his glass of mandarincello and soda. God, Harry loved him. It was a bit ridiculous.
“We’re going to talk about this later, you know,” Draco gasped between long kisses. “You can’t just fuck me every time you want to change the subject.”
Potter looked again. “You kind of are. No time for pants, but I note you seem to have had time to do your hair?”
“It’s barely four.” Draco had a feeling there would be other kinds of stiffness afflicting him if he let Potter give him a massage.
“Harry’s right,” Hermione said, firmly, squeezing his arm again. She gave Ginny a stern look, and to a lesser degree, Ron as well. This one Harry knew well. It said
Zabini should be green by now, based on the expression on his face. “Guerlain. Guylian are the chocolate seashells.”
As expected, the interviews took very little time to complete. There wasn’t much to tell, though Potter asked all manner of questions of the Gamma shift Keepers, like whether they noticed any unusual odors, did they feel this or that sensation in their magic at any point, and was there a taste of fennel or toadflax? They climbed the ladders to the topmost rafters and took samples of the residual spell residue, which seemed on the surface to be the basic, expected owl magic that anyone would find in a large Owlery, as well as the standard enchantments for owl-keeping.
“Great,” Harry pushed his glasses up, and rubbed his chin. “Just what I need on my next expense report – one artificial, anatomically correct vagina. Easy to explain.”
“Bad idea. Bad idea to tell him you’re taking me to bed. He gets jealous, you know. Even of you,” Harry lifted a hand to his mouth, to try and stem the flow of words. His ribs did not thank him for it. “Oh god, make me stop! He’ll never forgive me for telling you that.”
“Right,” Hermione said firmly. “Ginny, you will shut up going forward or I’ll hex you silent. Ron, stop making that face, you’re not helping. Harry, take a deep breath and stop freaking out. Don’t forget that the kids will be back at half two, so we can’t all carry on over this news for the rest of the afternoon.” She gave them all a stern look. “I’ve waited a long time for this and I won’t have you ruin it.”
the logical next step for a former war hero, trained by specialists to subdue and arrest criminals, and every now and again kill a person. How silly of me.”
Theo had told him that full capitalisation meant shouting. Draco found a fresh pair of pyjama trousers and pulled them on, first, then tapped out his address and sent it.
“I wanted to be the first person to say that to you this year,” Draco said, his voice low. “I think you’re the person I care about the most.”
The elf service had done a remarkable job. Grimmauld had never looked better, certainly not in Harry’s lifetime, anyway. The air smelled softly of roses and beeswax. The soap in the bathrooms was triple milled and luxurious, and the towels were thick and soft. Every bed had a brand new mattress, and expensive sheets, and there were small, square vases of roses on the bedside tables.
been smashing the dildo around between the artificial thighs of a sex doll. How was that fair? In fact, this was all quite horribly
“Fanny Ballhatchet? At a postbox in Cockfosters.” Harry rolled his eyes. “I suspect you’re probably right.” He folded up the list and tucked it back into his notebook, closing the cover and slotting it and his quill back into his robes. “Look – thanks Malfoy. This has actually been a great help to the investigation.”
“And on your holidays, yes,” Potter said, his breath tickling the hair at the base of Draco’s neck. “You mentioned.” Potter’s fingers flexed round his wrists again. “Right, I’m about to start. Just try to stay relaxed just like this, and we should be done in no time.”
“Yeah mate,” Ron said, already halfway across the car park and closing on the cafe. “It can wait a few. Not that I’m not keen to hear, but,” Ron gestured sheepishly. “Full English.”
Orange Singlet had come closer, and was now standing directly in front of Harry. “Your boyfriend has pretty eyes,” he said to Malfoy, his own never leaving Harry.
They pushed and pulled at each other; clothing was wrenched from shoulders and arms, belts hastily unbuckled and dragged through loops. Potter seemed particularly skilled at clutching Draco to his body, rubbing himself hard against any part of Draco he could find, whilst simultaneously divesting Draco of his clothing at a steady pace. It was almost as if he had a very useful extra pair of hands, Draco thought wildly, his head spinning from oxygen deprivation and the sheer lack of blood in most parts of his body but one. The moment came when they were almost entirely naked; Draco’s trousers were caught in a bunch around an ankle, and he was fairly sure Potter’s wristwatch was caught in the cuff of one shirtsleeve. There was nothing between them but a thin sheen of sweat, and Draco breathed hard against Potter’s throat, the pulse which beat against his lips echoed in the heated thrum of Potter’s cock pressed firmly into his hip.
Draco flushed, angrily. “You could have spoken up at any time as well, you know. For someone who allegedly had feelings, you didn’t seem bothered by the fact that I never stayed after sex, or that you could only see me at work, or the pub, or when we were both at Andromeda’s. Why didn’t you ever ask me to stay?” He hated how pathetic he sounded. “It would have been so easy for you to just hold me, after, and ask me to stay.”
to have a little dig at the state of his hair - no, that wouldn’t do. This was serious. This required the big mirror, the long, full length one in the master bedroom that he almost never bothered with, but which thankfully didn't talk back.
“Potter,” Blaise came out to greet him before Harry even had a chance to approach his receptionist. “What an unexpected pleasure.”
Malfoy rapped Harry on the forehead, hard, and yellow sparks came out of the end of his wand as he did it.
Harry rolled his eyes, and handed over the keys. “You’re a few days late returning one little Volkswagen and the administration is ready to toss you in Azkaban.”
Harry dipped his head when Draco’s fingers guided him, and he methodically rubbed shampoo into Harry’s thick hair in silence for a little while. “I can be a bit insecure,” Draco said eventually. “It might be time for me to make a few appointments myself.”
“Yeah, this is good,” Draco whispered. It was perfect, actually. “What time should I wake you tomorrow? You’ll need to go home and change.”
“That’s Ron,” Harry said, already slumping halfway back onto his ruined pillow. He recognised Ron’s noisy pissing. This was nothing new for those who’d ever shared a dorm with him, or an attic bedroom, or a tent. “I’m not in charge of Ron’s penis.” He was barely in charge of his own, to be fair.
“Yes, milady,” Malfoy said mockingly, but Harry could see there was nothing behind it but banter. He picked up the glasses in one hand, and the neck of the bottle in the other. “Come along, Potter.”
“No need. Already pulled them, and had a quick go through. I’ve made some notes for Potter and I to guide the secondary interview, if the Keepers can manage to stop their weeping long enough to be intelligible.”
Etchells went next, but Harry had no idea what she said, because he was staring fixedly into his lager with ringing ears, and thinking about a world in which he was married to Malfoy. Surely it wouldn’t all be nagging and sexlessness. If Harry were married to Malfoy, he didn’t think he’d be able to stop himself pestering him for sex virtually all the time. Maybe that was where the nagging came in, after all.
A model ship in a bottle, but the bottle was the size of a motorcycle, and the ship launched real cannon balls at the glass on a sickeningly rocking sea.
“I think I might be sitting on your wand, Potter,” Malfoy said, and took a whole strip of bacon off Harry’s plate.
He gripped the mantle until his knuckles went white. “What the fuck were you doing talking about me to Longbottom?” And what the fuck was Longbottom doing talking to Potter about Draco?
Draco’s laugh was one of Harry’s favourite things. “You can tell her that, then. Just update your will first and leave everything to me.” Harry blinked up at Draco, then kissed him, softly at first, then more deeply, until Draco pulled away with a desperate gasp. “Harry. You really make this hard, you know.”
Draco slowly removed his handkerchief from his robe pocket, and laid it across the seat of the chair. “How dare you. And as always, Potter, you are a disgrace.”
it’s more than that,” Harry said defensively. “I know that. It’s just really hard for me to let go of things, especially things people have given me. Apparently growing up in a cupboard with nothing for the first third of your life can have psychological consequences.”
Given there was no chance of an honest conversation in his near future, Draco did what he could to limit the overlap. He put in for a permanent shift change, and now he was on late, 1pm to half-ten. It was absolute hell on his body clock, he felt like he had the flu for a week, and kept getting up for those dawn runs, at first. Until he’d run into Potter near the Tate Modern gardens. Potter was sprawled out on the steps near the Millennium Bridge, with a cigarette in one hand, and a Costa cup in the other. Potter called out to him, and Draco had nearly tripped over his own feet.
Fivepennies caught his eye, and Draco nodded stiffly at her. It was hard to be grateful to the person who had caused this whole fucking mess in the first place.
“You’re useless,” Malfoy snapped eventually. He twisted, snatched the tie from Harry’s hand, and unrolled it with a hard snap of his wrists.
“Merlin, Harry,” Draco’s hands went down the back of the trousers, and Harry felt his cheeks part slightly with the force of Draco’s grasp, grinding Harry hard downwards as he bucked up, his cock a hot and hard length against Harry’s hip and thigh. “Why is it never enough?” Harry rolled his hips. He’d leaked all over the front of his pyjamas. “Have you put a spell on me?”
Draco stared at it, his eyes widening in horror. “Oh good grief. It does, doesn’t it.” He rubbed a hand over his face. “This explains why Orange Robes was so determined to get his lips on it, at least.”
Draco gave Potter a small smile. There wouldn’t be a ‘later’, Draco could already tell. “I’ll see you then.”
Ron looked sympathetic. “Well, what do you do now? What would you do if this was a fire-breathing toaster?”
“I’ve never had a sexual fantasy about you, Ron,” Harry said, and a nearby witch on crutches began to chuckle. “I had one about Hermione once, but never you.” Ron grabbed a handful of powder, and glared at the woman, before dragging Harry through the Floo rather ungently.
Harry huffed into his office and dropped onto the lumpy divan which was jammed into one corner. The chair made a warning creak, and Harry stuck his feet up on one arm and leaned his head on the other, and said a little prayer in the hope that today would not be the day that the aged couch collapsed under his weight.
“Just a couple of things, really. He’s been so sweet to me this week, and I’m not really allowed to buy him any more clothes since I got in trouble for spending about a million pounds,” Harry gave Blaise his most exaggerated cringe, as if to say ‘what am I like?’, as he lifted items from the bag to flash just long enough for Blaise to confirm their quality. “Anyway, it's just a few accessories, a scarf from this McQueen fellow-”
Hermione rolled her eyes again. “Ron, it’s not like I was especially thrilled about it either. I wasn’t going looking for it, it was an accident.”
“Sorry Vicky, just a little internal debate that became external.” He took the cup from her extended hands, and balanced it on top of his Out tray. “You’re a star, thank you.” Vicky left as silently as she had come in, and Harry gave his mental Hermione a stern glare, and turned his mind toward his reports with determination. There was nothing wrong with his personal life, no matter what Subconscious Hermione, or actual Hermione, had to say about it.
He tried to regulate his breathing as he collected his his belongings. Wallet shrunk, as he couldn't actually fit it in his ridiculous jeans otherwise. Mobile likewise stowed. Wand holster fitted to his right thigh and Disillusioned so that he could keep it at hand but invisible to Muggles and magical folk alike. He was ready, as he ever would be, anyway. For better or worse, he was going out tonight; going out for the first time in years, going out on the
Morgan pressed himself even more closely against the wall, and raised a pair of purple opera glasses to his face. A row of small, golden letters along the handle caught the light: WWW.
made himself, from an old Zabini family recipe. It was cool and sweet on his tongue, and Harry had a wild thought that he now knew what Malfoy’s mouth tasted like, because his mouth would taste just like this, in this moment.
Harry waited until Devlin had gathered the samples and left the lab, before allowing himself to take a proper look at the floral arrangement on his workbench. The cocks trembled in concert, quivering ever so slightly in response to vibrations in the air – the sound of Vicky slamming the filing cabinet drawer closed outside in the foyer was faint to his ears, but he could see the bush rustle immediately in response. Harry could only imagine what the rest of the garden looked like, what with the constant rumble of bin trucks and lorries making their way along Throttlebottom’s busy street. It was almost like they were waving to you, inviting you to come over. Harry looked at the closed door briefly, then extended his wand to poke just the very tip against the side of one cock. It bobbed in reply, excitedly.
probably, of clothing, and accessories, and fucking - fucking cologne Harry, and jewellery! Just sitting in their bags and boxes! With tags on! Harry! Beautiful, incredible items! That are all in my size, Harry! Just sitting here! In their
you fancy, I mean.” He forced a laugh, and it sounded strange, which was just fucking perfect. “Think the heat’s getting to me. Melted my brain.”
Greg or no, his friends gave him shelter, as did the press of strangers all around them. It gave him time to come down, compose himself. Potter was like a Class A drug, and Draco was an addict, and far from strong enough to handle this shit right now. He needed to get the fuck out of the club, before he had the misfortune of bumping into Potter getting blown by Trent, or anyone else. When he felt like he had more of his wits about him, with his feelings stuffed sufficiently back into the box and no longer written across his face, he told his friends he was going home.
Ignoring Ginny, he picked up his fork again and smushed some beans on his toast. “No, it wasn't like that. He was very professional. Well, I think he was flirting with me a little bit, but he didn’t ask me to go out with him until he stopped by at work the next evening.”
Ron dragged him off, wetting himself laughing. “‘Come back with a warrant!’ I think I’m going to like post-Voldy Malfoy.”
“None of you ever do, but it seems at every turn lately all I find is another Gryffindor asking intrusive questions, then telling me it’s because we’re friends.”
“I suppose that qualifies you for,” Harry paused for dramatic effect. “Not-Mousse, with raspberry sauce.”
“It’s nothing weird.” Harry paused, then corrected. “It’s nothing biological. The hoarding behaviour is obviously weird.”
Ron turned in his seat and put both hands on Harry’s shoulders. “It’s not a problem, Harry, I mean it. Not for any of us. We’ve all had so much therapy. Loads of it. It’s okay.” He nodded seriously at him until Harry nodded back. “Just spare me the naughty details, or if you really have to, try and tell me things when I’m not eating, or about to eat, or have just eaten.”
Harry wasn’t paying too much attention to the cricket, anyway. He already knew Bangladesh had beaten England by two wickets, and Harry wanted to know where exactly Draco was going with this.
“Let’s go to Hampton Wick, Harry,” Ginny was barely in the car before Ron started. Ginny groaned loudly.
“Oh, have a day off, Malfoy.” He sipped his whisky, and Draco did his best not to notice the smooth movement of Potter’s throat, or to gulp his own champagne. “So, I expect you’re going to celebrate my genius in your closing speech, then?”
The pasta salad was no complicated dish. The spirals only needed a little time to boil, and the lardons came in a pre-chopped packet from Waitrose, so he could fry them off at the same time as the pasta was cooking. The rest of the veg just needed a fine chop and by the time he was done, so was the pasta. While it was still hot and slippery in the colander, he tossed through a spoonful of the mayo, to stop it from sticking together in a horrible noodle lump, then dumped his curry powder and mustard in the jar, and gave it a quick stir, then an almighty shake.The spirals were dressed in golden yellow in moments, and the bacon, and scallions, and peppers, and coriander mixed through, and then there was nothing else to do but wait for Malfoy, and quietly implode.
Draco looked at him softly. “Yeah, the boss gave me a compassionate day because my fiance nearly got killed to death in a workplace accident.”
Harry could just roll him over and start the whole process over again, Draco looked so delicious. He sipped the water as best he could with a giant grin on his face. “Who knew you’d turn out so cute, Malfoy?”
“I promise I’ll behave. I promise I won’t let them split us up. I promise,” Harry swallowed, nervous. This was something new, a line he hadn’t crossed before. “I don’t want another partner. I don’t want anyone else but you.” He thumbed gently at the inside of Malfoy’s wrists.
“Why are you so proud of that,” Ginny asked, looking disgusted. “What’s wrong with it, that it’d be so memorable? Is it a funny colour, or just very small?”
Draco shrugged and felt his ears grow hot. Potter tipped his bottle and drained the last of his beer. Draco’s was half drunk, and going warm in his hands. Potter stood, and looked down at Draco.
anything. But Ginny...professional Quidditch players were not generally known for their powers of deduction. What the fuck was Potter about, anyway? Was it a secret, was it not? He took a sip of his water and took his time responding. “Well I had a change of heart. I was visited by quite a persistent bird, myself.”
Draco heaved what felt like his millionth sigh, and hopped off the stool. “You might as well come and look at it. I could do with a second opinion anyway.”
Ted’s breath was hitching, but it seemed the surge of tears was a brief one. “S-sorry Uncle Harry. I know I’m not a baby, I don’t know why I’m c-crying.”
“Yeah,” Harry said firmly. If he hesitated, then he’d just find a hundred reasons to keep them, or he’d procrastinate further over whether or not to start a new hobby that he really didn’t have the time or energy for. He was never going to make his own mince meat, if he was being honest. Or doughnuts, or ice cream, or candles, or soap. “There are some things I’d like to keep though.”
Draco was silent for a few moments, just watching him work. Ladle, stir, stir, stir. “You know, that whole incident with Smith was when I realised I’d fallen in love.”
He knew his face was getting red. “You’re not going to believe it. And if you believe it, I’m not sure you’re going to like it.”
Malfoy didn’t seem ruffled in the least. If anything, there was an air of amusement about him, as he led Harry down an aisle of whips and handcuffs and to a discreet door at the back of the shop, marked ‘Staff Only’. He held the door open for Harry, and they stepped into a vast space, which, as the door was closed by Malfoy behind them, Harry realised had one entirely transparent wall.
“Yeah,” Harry said, “and raspberry sauce, enough so we can have some with ice cream tomorrow if you feel like it.” Not-Mousse was his easiest dessert, given it was really just a lot of whipped cream with some lovely dark chocolate melted in, and a great dollop of Nutella for good measure.
When he did lift his eyes from the glass to Malfoy, he looked completely neutral. And the bastard continued to wait, silently. Harry sighed. “She was really good about it. Amazing, really. At first it was just talk, you know. Pillow talk, like.” Christ and Hades. He didn’t dare look at Malfoy now. “When we were in bed she used to whisper things to me, and it would have me in pieces. And eventually that became, um. Touching.” He coughed. “Fingering when she went down on me, that sort of thing. Once she had her fingers in me, and she suggested we brew some Polyjuice so she could fuck me properly next time.” Harry huffed a wry laugh. “I came so hard I thought I’d gone blind.”
“That’s hot,” Draco said, with annoyance. “Show off. Merlin, why am I such a slag for you doing wandless.”
That was well and truly enough. Time to go. Harry didn’t look at the mirror again, but as he turned his back he was sure he heard a low and glassy “Phwoar!”.
“Quite alright Potter,” Malfoy did the thing again, the thing where he looked Harry up and down. Harry swallowed, then leaned in with the dildo in hand.
“I think it was more morbid curiosity than fantasy,” Harry picks a piece of beetroot from the bowl and lifts it to Teddy’s mouth. He chomps with enthusiasm. There are little bits of feta sprinkled in, he can see now. Ted loves a bit of feta. “Anyway, she’s moved on. Shagging someone else, in fact.”
“Ugh,” Draco scratched a hand through his hair. “It just means I don’t do casual. I don’t sleep around, have lots of flings. You were different.” Draco looked away. “It’s not that I wanted to be a casual thing with you, more that I decided I couldn’t live with not knowing what you’d be like. Since I’d wanted you for such a long time. I thought I’d be able to manage it, going in with no expectation of more than sex, but,” Draco lifted his chin, and met Potter’s eyes. “I should have known better than that, since I already had too many deeper feelings about you before I ever touched you. I wasn’t careful with my emotions, and eventually I cracked.”
It had gone so well, that Harry had gotten started on the other two rooms on the second floor that afternoon as well. Loads more dust, not as many Lego’s or stuffed moon calves. He left the beds stripped down to their mattresses for Draco to inspect, although Harry felt strongly that those should probably just be Vanished, and if there were any lingering, even slightly dark or creepy whispers of magic remaining, they were scoured out of existence now. The rooms now smelled just slightly of vanilla, and Windolene. One was a twin, ideal for Narcissa and Andromeda, and the other a small single room that they’d mutually decided would be ideal for McGonagall.
After, he lay in plum-coloured sheets and smelled nothing but Potter, and his heart felt like it might never slow down.
Harry opened his mouth, and closed it again. Malfoy snorted slightly into his cup. “Good lord, Potter, I haven’t asked you out to slaughter a litter of kneazles in a midnight ritual. Its a few drinks and maybe some awkward shuffling on the dance floor - from you, that is. I’m as graceful as a peacock.” At this, it was Harry’s turn to snort, and Malfoy pretended he wasn’t smirking into his tea. “I’m not going to try and convince you, Potter. Frankly I consider this a public service. For the record, I’m going out to a Muggle club, so this isn’t a set up to papp you, or anything like that. Just an offer for a bit of fun. You seem like you might need it.”
. Every morning was a reminder that they were separated. Every dutiful mouthful of slop he spooned up from his tin plate an empty parody of their morning ritual together. No matter what happened during the rest of the day, the hours they would be apart while Harry was at work and Draco was holed up in his study-cum-office investing here, and vice-presidenting there, the inevitable squabbles over what to watch on telly or who forgot the dry cleaning, breakfast was their time together. Breakfast was sacred.
“Standard operating procedure, Potter, don’t get excited. You’re still a ranking officer, and it’s my duty to at least make a show of checking that you’re not about to be poisoned.”
Draco looked at her incredulously, thrust forward into the cabin by the crowd behind them as the lift doors rolled open. “What? From the Ministry?”
One side of Malfoy’s mouth quirked up. “Yes, for the night. An old friend from Beauxbaton’s is visiting, and I think we could both do with a night away from each other. I think he’s met some barista at my usual coffee shop, and if possible I’d like to be out of the house if he’s brought her back for a shag tonight.”
Harry let himself out onto the top step of Grimmauld Place, ignored the anxious thrumming of his pulse, and consoled himself that at least if he died of a heart attack on the way, he would be wearing decent pants for once.
So Harry gave him a proper kiss, and Draco went through the Floo ten minutes later with his hair once again in disarray.
“I think you’re making a mistake, there, mate,” Ron said, doing more of the silent but obvious eyeball speak with Hermione.
As such, his part in Yellow Stripe ended when the fieldwork began, until he was needed towards the end to do something heroic, as Malfoy teased him, like rip through Wards like wet tissue, or Protego and entire class of schoolchildren in one go, without a wand.
“She was telling me about Veela wings,” Teddy mumbled. The tears had stopped, but his cheeks were still wet, and his lashes were spiky. “I didn’t think it through very well.”
“Yeah, up to giving no fucks, by the look. Oh, your face, Harry. Sorry to be disloyal, but that was solid gold, mate.”
“Night, Ron,” Draco called absently, Weasley already halfway down the hall to his own office. He turned the phone over in his hands. God, it was dreadful. Requisitions were pricks. Weasley was tolerable. And tomorrow he would be on his way to Greece. Draco slipped the phone into his own pocket, and hurried to finish his paperwork so he could get home already.
” Ginny said so loudly that several Muggles returning to their cars turned to look at them as they rolled past. “Who is he Harry? How did you meet him? How long have you been seeing him -
“Let’s not test it, though,” Ron said, and he stabbed six fat chips and as much pasta as he could manage, and forked the lot into his mouth. “Wassinit ma’ae?”
He felt he’d lost the power of speech, so moved aside so that Potter could come in, and shut the door carefully behind him.
“Yes,” Potter’s voice was obscene, and he pulled Draco down on top of him, legs parting and wrapping around Draco’s hips. “I knew it. I knew I was right about you. You fancy the
“So we’re going to check the central wards and see if anything pinged, interview the Owl Keepers and see if we can find anything residual there, and then head off to speak with the only suspect we have so far.”
. Harry pressed down, felt coarse hair brush the tip of his nose. He felt the push of Draco in the back of his throat. Harry wished for a dozen hands, so he could touch Draco everywhere at once, and a dozen eyes to watch it all, the way Draco’s spine curved and his neck arched, and the flush which bloomed down his chest, and the way his straight, dark brows would draw together in pleasure, his hair a sweaty mess.
that was an unreasonable notion and I didn’t say I still thought that was true.” Draco glared at him. “And thank you for making it sound even more absurd aloud. But that aside, I really didn’t think you would be able to compromise – don’t make that face. We hardly have a history of cooperation or trust, do we?”
“Oh god,” Verity moaned into her hands. “This was all a horrible mistake. I mean, I did do it, I definitely am the one who took the owls,” Verity gestured around herself, where the unmistakable evidence was roosting. “But I didn’t quite mean to do
Some sweaty, heady minutes later, Draco pulled away with a gasp. “Brute. Let me up for a minute.” Harry rumbled a protest, about how Draco had only just said that brutishness was what he wanted, and Draco hummed in agreement, forgetting to be difficult for just a moment. “Harry...mmmf, just one minute, my love.” He briefly tightened his arms around Harry before he was allowed to roll away to the edge of the bed to pull on his pants. Harry watched him pad quietly into the ensuite with bare feet - he loved any opportunity to watch the bunch and stretch of Draco’s tight little arse and long thighs, he could just take a
Peering into his cup, Harry stared for a long moment at his reflection in the dark brown tea. “Hermione thinks - that I’m hiding behind my job so I don’t have to deal with stuff. Life stuff. Relationships.” Merlin’s arse, it felt weird to say that aloud, weird enough that he was saying it to Malfoy, a man he’d barely spoken to for a decade - but it also felt a bit like relief. “And this case, well, it leads to a lot of banter about sex, doesn't it? And once that sort of chat is going on, then it’s never too long before I start getting harassed about my love life, and how unhealthy my coping mechanisms are.” Harry sighed again, and it felt like it was coming from the pit of his stomach.
Weasley slammed both hands down on his desk, and upset his mug of tea a second time. Golsby appeared at the door again but was clever enough to leave immediately without asking any questions.
Weasley snorted softly. “Right. So, Nev said something at the pub the other night about birthday drinks. Do you think you’ll come?”
with each other. Everything was very hot, charged, whether they were getting along or had their hands at each other's throats.
There was still silence, as they stared at each other for several moments - there was always so much silence between them, too much, but Draco had a feeling it wouldn't always be that way.
And she had done. She had pulled him to her and sucked his cock, and Harry had come so hard, had struggled to keep quiet.
“The thing is,” he started eventually, and then he paused, shovelling several large bits of egg into his mouth to buy some more time. “I mean, it’s not really anything. Yet. It might not become anything, actually. But you know. That’s still more than I’ve done in forever, so, it's something. Well. It’s nothing. I don’t know.”
The owl returned nearly three hours later, which was astonishing considering it was nearly five hours by train.
Draco mumbled against his neck, where he seemed to be trying to lick his way to his internal organs.
Well. Perhaps not quite in the face. More like an inch above the papery forehead of what seemed to be an elf.
“You’re not thinking of Throttlebottom anymore though, are you.” He was forced to admit, he was not. “So. Anyone you fancy at the moment?”
Malfoy’s laughter ricocheted through the quiet alley like a rogue hex. “Potter, that line was pure shite. I take back everything I said. You’ve done terribly and you’ve learned nothing.”
When the box had been placed on his bed and enlarged from the size of a matchbox to the size of his old Hogwarts trunk, and Harry had eased back the lid, it took him several long moments to absorb what he was looking at. Fucking hell. It looked like there was one of everything from Malfoy’s shop, or at the very least, one of everything from the dildo aisle.
exactly was starting to become more and more difficult to recall. He forced himself to remember. Draco would get attached. Potter would get bored of him. They’d fight. Potter would leave, Draco would be ruined for other men forever. Potter was just a flirt, anyway, he’d watched it in action a dozen times before. He was just friendly, it was just banter. It was Potter’s natural and innocent way of getting people on-side. Nevermind that with Draco, it skewed more towards bickering, but it was the same sort of thing. Getting a crush on Potter was stupid and absolutely pointless. He must ignore the flirting and concentrate on solving the case, so he could re-book his Portkey, and be checking in to The Poseidonion at the earliest possible moment.
“Don’t you think it strange,” Malfoy said calmly, “that she married Scamander, even though surely she knew she preferred women? Maybe she did it just so he could get her up the duff. She certainly left him quickly enough once she’d had them. Or maybe she wanted to cash in on the family name for professional reasons-”
There must be something in his tone. He hadn’t meant to blurt it out quite so abruptly. Harry could feel three pairs of eyes looking at him expectantly. He heard the wings of the Snitch buzzing in Ginny’s hand, and when his fingers tightened on the steering wheel he could just about hear the old leather creak.
“I want you to do something for me, Potter. The horde is about to be let into the club, and it’s going to be humid, and loud, and filled to the brim with half-nude strangers who are here for the music but also are largely here to find someone to get off with. I want you to come out there with me, right into the thick of it, and just look. See how they react to you - they’re Muggles, so it's not going to be your reputation, or your magic. It’s going to be just you. Just Harry.”
