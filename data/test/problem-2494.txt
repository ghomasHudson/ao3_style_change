Harry let that thought go, drifting off like wood on the water … only for another one to replace it.
The doors banged open and the sunlight burst in from above.
Nobody has ever done that to me before... Saw a moment, wanted to do something, and just gone for it. I... I’m speechless.
He never saw her, but from conversations, the clone learned about her strawberry blond hair. Red hair of almost any shade was tied to the infamous Weasley clan. Everyone knew Potter's best friend was a Weasley. Mrs. Black kept her hair carefully hidden but that did not stop her from sharing the latest Harry Potter news at any provocation.
"He saved my life, you know?" Harry said quietly
“Thing is, mate,” Ron said, taking another biscuit, “this is your house. Your house, your rules. If you agree to this, we make that clear up front. This is for their convenience, not yours, and that comes with responsibility to keep you from chucking them out.”
Harry was not the first person to go into the hold. His people were good and he trusted them to do their job. He was the last.
Also a small snippet in the corner about a WNN interview with the couple by Lee Jordan featuring a photo of the pair in headsets on the air, laughing and dressed in t-shirts.
Without warning, Draco jumped up from his chair and Harry heard “I'm gonna be sick” as his husband rushed past them and into the house, his hand clamped over his mouth.
“It’s beautiful,” he said, stepping forward and running his fingers over the wooden carvings depicting various scenes of the holidays.  “Where did you get it?”
“Of course,” Draco said, brushing his cheek with a tender kiss before pulling away. “Wine? Or perhaps beer would better suit your barbecue?” The sarcasm was thick, indicative of his sometimes grudging tolerance of Harry and Arthur’s exploration of all things Muggle.
"Diggory, your group will take the stern, mine will take the bow. Pettigrew, you're with me."
“You OK?”
Harry nodded and continued to hold Draco until he felt him take a deep breath and pull away. He handed Draco a tissue and then smiled at him. “We're going to have girls, Draco! Two of them. I’m just..” Harry started to laugh. When he had calmed down again, he smiled at Draco and touched his cheek. “Don’t worry about anything. I’m going to take good care of you.”
Robards cleared his throat. “Yes, well, because of his position, he knew about how she really died as soon as that information was divulged, and he decided revenge was the answer. He coldly planned your deaths even though he knew you did not kill her. We found notes in his satchel that outlined plans to murder any further Death Eaters we managed to find before they could be sentenced. By all appearances, he was acting alone.”
Kingsley had the good grace to look sheepish but nodded solidly. “You have my word, Harry.”
“Very good.  Darby will be informing Master Draco.”  With a pop, he was gone and Harry sipped his coffee, its warmth trailing down his throat and spreading throughout his body.  Despite his illness, he’d come to cherish the peacefulness here and the space to just breathe and recover.
“Yeah, I will. Thanks, both of you,” Harry said with a grin. “Just don’t be surprised if I need someone to scream at from time to time. This being-an-adult thing is just hard as fuck.”
“You wish, Harry. Let’s go.”
Harry had found more than one sailor knocked out from behind even though the fighting was going on in front of them. Luna would smile and shrug as she called her little ones back to her.
Yours,
When Harry looked back down, he saw Scorpius' little finger touching the girls' cheeks gently while Draco and Scorpius talked quietly, and it pulled at Harry's heart. How was this his life?
The clone pressed himself against the cold stone as the others scrambled away. No one wanted to risk being touched. The lanterns flickered and went out. Light came in from the small windows lining the ceiling and enabled him to see the disembodied dark lord fling himself through a far wall.
Not everything he overheard was good news. Lucretia insisted that the pirates hated all black magic. "They kill any dark wizard they meet," she assured whoever would listen. "And never cast any corrupt spells."
“No! That’s not even possible.”
“You got it,” Harry said and promptly popped two slices of bread into the toaster.
“Yeah,” Harry said quietly. “Thanks, mum.”
“Wait, there were toys and things?” Harry looked slightly horrified, his voice squeaky. “Really?”
“She thinks that perhaps it was me wishing for a baby of my own and my magic accommodating. Which, I admit, I have wished for a number of times,” Harry said. “I mean, I know we talked about adopting or surrogate and both of those are wonderful options but there have been moments,” he paused, taking Draco’s hand and brushing his lips over the pale knuckles, “when I’ve felt such deep love for you, for us, that I’ve wished we could have our own children that are just fully ‘us’, you know?”
"With this new aerial attack they are doing, they've got a shot. They'll have a huge head start by the time we show up and the more combat spells they cast the larger their share of the plunder."
He’d seen Draco slowly reconnect to the father he’d once adored and might again. Saw Lucius repentant and apologetic towards his only son and even towards Harry himself. Harry’s lips thinned slightly when he remembered his less than warm reception of it, but Lucius had remained calm and kind in the face of Harry’s cold demeanour, which just made Harry angrier. Their family was intact and when this was over, the Malfoys would go home together. Draco would have both of his parents and his fortune and his palatial house, and Harry wouldn’t begrudge him that at all. They had begun a tentative friendship. He was happy for his friend but he wondered, not for the first time even today, why his life hated him so much. His parents were dead, hell, all his relatives were dead (except for the Dursleys, but he didn’t want to dwell on that), and all he had was money, this old house and his godson. Teddy was one of the few things that made him smile these days. He sighed softly and fought the tears that threatened to break free.
The occupants of the room stood still for several long-drawn-out moments. Then, with a sigh of relief, they went back to work.
“You didn’t look like the toys or the posters. You looked like a street urchin, Harry. No one knew...no one knew that you weren’t a spoiled, well-dressed young wizard. That’s what I was expecting.”
“They’re so beautiful, Harry. I just can’t stop looking at them.”
Things were different on the single squadron ship to survive the attack.
Where was I? Oh yes, I want to know your quirks and habits. I also want to know what you want in the future, where you’d like to visit, what sort of house you’d like to live in. Do you want pets? If you ever have children how do you want to raise them? What’s on your bucket list? I’d like to spend hours, days, months, years, learning everything about you. You fascinate me endlessly.
“Can you do the voices like Papa does? I love the voices. Nana Cissa says that Papa makes the bestest voices.”
“Yes, Daddy!” Scorpius beamed at Harry. “I’m a good big brudder.”
“They’re identical,” Draco whispered, looking from one to the other.
Nothing.
A dissected lung lay in pieces in the middle of the table. The clone often thought he had more in common with the disassembled parts of the dead than the living.
Afterwards, they made their way to the kitchen, Draco close by in case Harry felt ill again.
The two sun-browned sailors stood side by side as they contemplated the battle to come. The squadron, ten of Voldemort's strongest ships, were now close enough Harry could see frantic movement on the deck. Harry's little fleet had been spotted. Ten against three were not normally bad odds, ...but they knew who they faced.
“No one left behind,” Harry called but need not have bothered. Pirate brothers were already picking up their fallen comrades.
Harry was still holding Draco's hand, and both men nodded, Draco's grip tightening. Dr. Smithers waved his wand over Draco’s belly and a 3-D image appeared in the air.
“Me too, mate,” Ron said as he sipped on his drink, “but it was too good to resist.”
Saturday was amazing. The looks on their faces when you turned up in my old school scarf! Not to mention the look on mine. I had to practically sit on my hands to keep from reaching out and touching you. I wanted to put my arm through yours and lean against you or put my arms around your waist while we waited for the game to begin. Sixteen-year-old me would have been so bloody smug if he could see you in his scarf, then he would have wanked himself raw thinking about it. Although in all honesty sixteen.year-old me did wank himself raw thinking about it. If he actually saw it he’d probably have come in his pants untouched.
Harry took a deep breath and put his glasses back on. “This would be easier if it were just Narcissa and Draco. As shitty as he was to me in school, he was simply a bully and then just fucking scared. I can forgive that. It’s Lucius. The idea that I have to have that arsehole here in my house, to put up with his arrogant bullshit, it’s just …”
"Potter-Malfoy Romance!!!" and features a photo of Harry and Draco together in their red and green robes, smiling and looking quite cozy.
"Catch them by surprise," Neville nodded.
A week and countless cobwebs, doxy nests and other pest infestations later, Harry had apparently had enough.
chores in
The Daily Prophet Headline reads:
"They put on more speed, he's not going to give the enemy ships enough time to turn out of the way." Neville said.
"I'm not doing anything the same way Voldemort does, especially if it's stupid." Harry snapped and then took a deep breath and softened his tone. "That's an old argument, Peter. And if money is why you’ve decided to come today ..."
I’m sorry.
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I know you must be confused and worried. I didn’t mean to run off like that.
There’s a plate of toast and bacon, a bowl of fruit, coffee, tea and Harry’s glasses. There’s also a copy of the prophet and scattered about are a few of the owls they’ve received.
We’ve been managed, manoeuvred, manipulated etc. etc. Given the fact that people have been doing that my whole damn life, I’m not happy about it. Her intentions were good, I know. She was trying to help as were our fellow professors but bloody hell, it just rankles. They were concerned that with our past, it would be best if we were just kept apart to settle in, to get past these first few months without a confrontation or whatever the hell it is they thought we’d do. I, for one, have had enough fighting to last a lifetime. Once you’ve died, the rest is just meh.
The huge castle overwhelmed the clone, vast compared to the small grouping of rooms where he spent his whole life. The doors to get out of the passageways had simple handles and gave him easy access to the entire building. Tunnels criss-crossed throughout every level. Following his nose, he found stores of fruits and vegetables, meats and cheeses, ...and the wines. The clone fell in love with the wines.
“Was it?” Narcissa asked, her voice quiet in contrast to Harry’s. “Perhaps you see it that way and perhaps technically, you are correct but there is much you likely do not know. You see, Draco did all of those things for me. My life was Voldemort's bargaining chip, the way he kept my son in line. I did my best to protect him and to control my husband. It is difficult when surrounded by pure evil like that lunatic and my equally insane sister. Did you know, in fact, that I thought I had bargained to keep Draco from taking the mark? Then, one night while I was sleeping, he called Draco in and gave him a choice, the mark for my life. I was horrified. Draco was resigned. He knew that mark meant the end to everything, his hopes, his plans, his career, his entire future. After that, he just gave up, feeling that nothing was left to him but protecting me. That's still where he is, protecting me and feeling hopeless about everything else. I know it's hard for you to understand, Mr Potter, as the Saviour and not the Death Eater, but that is his reality.” She paused, then added. “In his place, what would you have done to save your mother, even if only from her own short sightedness? Perhaps consider that before you judge him too harshly.” She took a deep breath. “If you'll excuse me, I need to check on my son.”
“I think that’s the very definition of a successful party,” Molly added from the swing she and Narcissa shared.
Calling you Harry is still a little odd to me, but in the interest of professional cooperation I’ll give it a try. My apologies, I’m not sure why you are so hell-bent on speaking to me. You’ve hardly shown any inclination before…I suppose I’m wondering why you care?
“Thank you, Mr Potter,” Lucius offered, then stood. “If you don’t mind, I would like to rest for a while. It’s been an emotional day.”
As they left the lab, the clone wanted to call her back. He opened his mouth.
Just then Harry sneezed and froze, the sound of footsteps drawing close before the pantry door was yanked open and an angry Draco Malfoy was staring him down.
This was an expression he caught his own face making, mirrored off shiny beakers and burner plates, usually in response to Voldemort's presence. The clone was unsure what he had done to make the young Malfoy view him in such a way as he remembered nothing before that moment.
“No argument from me.”
Draco paced the length of the sitting room, muttering under his breath. His pale skin had a pink undertone which grew darker by the minute. He was visibly stressed because he and his mother had been ordered to stay in hiding ‘as a precaution’ during these last few days of the trials while Lucius was in front of the Wizengamot in his role as key witness.
“I sincerely doubt it, but we can ask.” Draco sleeved his wand and looked at his now filthy hands. “I think I’d like to get cleaned up. We can ask her at dinner.”
“What friends, mother?” Draco asked quietly. “Pansy and Blaise are on the continent, consoling each other, no doubt. Crabbe is dead, and Goyle is still on house arrest. The rest all buggered off after the war ended.”
They both turned back toward the stars, and Draco didn’t even try to fight the smile on his face, still holding Harry’s hand. Merlin.
“Well, we wanted children, as in more than one,” he said with a nervous laugh.
Fuck. I think I just ruined this.
Scorpius turned his wide grey eyes on Harry.
He was a pirate, after all.
The clone retreated to his mental treasure chest as Voldemort whirled around the lab ranting about Harry Potter.
“But wait, Papa didn’t finish the story yet.”
“Me too.”
Apparently, they think we’re still the two teenagers we used to be.  I pointed out that we’re adults
“What about it, Mr Potter?” Narcissa asked. Lucius said nothing, and Draco, well, Draco hadn’t spoken to him since the incident this morning.
Cedric was in front of Harry all the way. Their wands were out, hands on their weapons, but none of them anticipated the iron door slamming down behind them when Harry cleared the last of the stairs.
“Twins,” Harry said for the fourth time.
"That's not open for debate, Pettigrew. If you're coming on the charge, you better be ready."
“Of course,” Harry said, standing and Harry performed the ritual to allow Kingsley access.
Harry chuckled as he allowed Draco to help him off the floor and into the shower.
"Hands to quarters!" The quartermaster on deck repeated the order, which was echoed  by all the gunnery sergeants. High on the stern three sets of drum sticks lifted themselves into the air to beat out a distinctive rhythm into the large kettle drums. The sound pounded in the bones of the ship itself.
“Harry,” Kingsley’s voice carried through the empty hall, “would you get the Malfoys? There’s been a development.”
“You go, warm up in the sitting room by the fire. Winky will be making the chocolate for you.”
“Please?” Draco’s voice was thick with emotion, his eyes still fixed on the bassinet, and Harry nodded.
Harry
“How is that even possible?” Harry asked. “We had to work so hard the first time.”
"They say that the wife of his best friend is personally championing the independence of house elves" she said a few nights later.
house, and you were in
Later that night, Harry wrote a note to Hermione and apologised for their fight before falling into an exhausted, but restful sleep.
*Later that day*
“You’re insane,” Draco said with a laugh.
I’m just...I...I don’t know what to do.
No one made an effort to replace any of it.
At the helm Neville flipped the wooden handles, turning the wheel with almost unearthly speed, competence borne out of years of practice. 'The Phoenix' veered even further to port, exposing their right side to the oncoming squadron. As they turned, Harry got a clear look at the chaos Fred, George and the others created as they wrecked their enemies.
“Harry, I know we thought this was just dodgy takeout, which, given that place you got it from, it still could be, but it might be wise to go and see a healer. Just to be sure, of course.” Draco’s voice was so kind that it made Harry’s heart melt.
At that, Draco smiled and visibly relaxed. “Very well.”
“Because they don’t let little boys be there until after your sisters are born,” he explained patiently. “You need to stay with Nana and Poppy tonight so I can take care of your papa.”
Later that morning, Scorpius was running across the lawn towards Harry. “Daddy, I want Papa!" The soft whimper and accompanying snuffles broke Harry’s heart.
Draco grimaced. “I tried breakfast but that didn’t go well.”
July 31st dawned with a clear, blue sky. By noon it had turned into a warm and sunny day as though even nature was celebrating with them. After they had completed the renovations on Grimmauld Place, they had begun work on Malfoy Manor, Harry working alongside the Malfoys on the project. The five-year transformation of the manor was finally finished and today they would gather and celebrate Harry’s birthday on the Manor grounds. Harry strolled out among the house-elves preparing for the party and made his way down the path toward the front gates. He heard steps behind him and smiled, his right hand instinctively reaching for his companion. A moment later, Draco’s left hand slipped into place and they walked together to the gates, content in each other’s company. The gates had been moved further from the house during the renovations, leaving more space for an expansive front lawn and ornamental flower patches. The forebidding walled gardens were gone as well.
"Sorry, sir. It should have received your basic functional knowledge."
“I can imagine,” Harry said, his voice kind. “None of us came out of this mess unscathed. I’m truly sorry about your home. When this is over, you can go back and reclaim it, if you want.”
"Go tell your brothers to launch. We've got him this time."
“And if I say no?” Harry said gruffly. After the blowup with Hermione earlier, he was too heartsore to deal with more pushing.
"Oh, no sir. We did a memory wipe right before he ... I mean it ... woke up, to be certain. It will know nothing but what we tell ... it."
He loved his long hair, though, and struggled to keep it clean using the lab sink.  Anything that made him look like his own person rather than Draco Malfoy was good.
"Who did?"
A few hours later, they were finally driven back inside by the cool night air, chilly despite it being early summer. As they put their brooms away, Harry suggested hot chocolate and Draco readily agreed. They moved carefully down the stairs, trying not to disturb the elder Malfoys and made their way into the kitchen.
"That kid's a spoiled brat," the scientist grumbled.
Maybe he should consider giving it up. He was decent at normal magic but he hated the idea of losing the progress he had made.  If it bothered Potter then he should do it but … perhaps he could wait. His spells continued to grow stronger. If he worked with dark magic for a little longer, he might be strong enough to give it up later. Every time Lucretia went off about the evils of dark magic, he was filled with guilt, but it wasn't enough to motivate him to change just yet.
Readers, from here to the end, we’ve deviated just a touch from format because it helped us wrap things up better.
“Of course, anytime.”
You took a leap of faith and I ran away. That’s twice now. Once in a letter baring your soul and making your intentions clear that received no reply, and once in a hungry, mind-blowing kiss that I fled from. I know what you must be thinking, but stop. It’s just complicated and new and I didn’t want to mess things up, but I think I just did anyway.
The clone unconsciously straightened up. Harry Potter. He allowed his mouth to form the shape of it. The mighty 'He' that even Voldemort feared. Long arms wrapped around the clone's pale torso and a bit of smile played at the edges of his lips as he mouthed the name again and again.
“Are you two alright?”
Harry nodded. “Thank you, Winky.”
Draco snuggled closer into Harry's embrace and they slept.
“Hello Draco, Harry,” the doctor said with a smile.
The only time they had been separated was the long awful months Sirius had spent in Azkaban when Harry was a teenager. Despite the difficult circumstances, Harry had grown into the role of leading the ragtag bunch of pirates. By the time they freed Sirius, no one disputed Harry's right to command, causing Harry to realize he could do anything he set his mind to.
Harry looked over, their eyes locking for a moment before he nodded. “Thanks.”
“Thanks, Andi.”
“Pain and emotion that deep and intense can tear you apart if they’re never expressed,” Narcissa said quietly. “I know this from experience. Both you and Draco do that, hide things away and stuff them down until they eat at you from the inside or finally burst out, and it’s not healthy.”
Harry smiled, leading them into their bedroom. The men undressed quietly, then entered the large ensuite. Harry started the shower and followed Draco in. “Let me,” he said quietly when Draco reached for the shampoo. He was rewarded with a gentle smile. Harry washed Draco’s hair and then ran a soapy sponge over his body, caring for his beloved tenderly. While Draco dried off, Harry completed his own shower quickly. Draco was already in bed when Harry emerged, still toweling his hair dry. As he slipped into bed, he stifled a yawn and realized just how tired he was as well. He slipped his arm around Draco’s waist and curled up behind him, smiling to himself as his husband moved back into his warmth.
On pale parchment with a header that reads Narcissa Black Malfoy, done in an elegant hand -
Draco,
In the clone's opinion, creating multiples of a megalomaniacal narcissist would create a whole new set of problems, though no one asked him. Voldemort did not have a body to clone and so while everyone waited for that problem to be solved, they ran a cloning test on someone else.
The clone developed some ideas from watching the failures. If he snatched some components, the lab workers would assume another attempt had been made and wave away the disappearance. But the explosive outcome of a failed endeavour left a mark. Attempting to create his own stone was not something the clone could try here.
“I’d like to keep them overnight, just to be sure. Everything went well, but Draco’s been through a lot. Let’s give him a night to rest and recover.”
“Draco,” Harry said for the fourth time, “please calm down, You’re going to make yourself ill again.”
Love,
Draco nodded and Harry saw emotion in those gentle grey eyes that matched his own. “Me too,” Draco whispered.
The clone worked the loss over in his mind. The tightening in his chest when he thought of the lost items hurt, but he had plenty of time for such minor discomforts. After all, he was a thing, and things did not feel pain.
Why this wall?
“Whatever makes you most comfortable, Harry.”
They kept all four of the minerals required to make the stone in the vault. Each one of the techs hoped that someone else would figure the secret out.
*3 months later*
"Well," Draco said, "the first part is breakfast.  Your favorite, beans on toast topped with a poached egg, bacon and tomatoes.  The rest is in the Advent calendar."
I was so overwhelmed, and I wanted it so much it… it frightened me. I felt my hands suddenly tangle in your hair, and I heard you moan, and it was suddenly so real. Not just a dream, it was you, and you were there... and I... panicked.
It boosted morale to hear all the wonderful ways the Pirates were making their enemies' lives miserable and the effect on the fighters being attacked was as dramatic. They always won battles faster when Jordan reminded them how well they were doing.
A wicked smile tweaked at the corners of Harry's mouth. "Yeah. Wouldn't want this to get boring."
Draco laughed and hugged his son. “Well, they lived happily ever after, of course.”
“Yes, you will, my little man,” Harry said with a grin and ruffled scorpius' hair. “Yes, you will.”
"You're probably right," Harry agreed, "but this won't be the first time he's rammed someone. He's built for it."
“This is where I come when life is too much for me, it recentres me and helps me carry on,” Harry explained. “I love it here.”
I shoved you away and ran.
“ Salazar and Circe,” was Draco’s response.
Narcissa nodded quietly, but never verbally corrected herself.
Suddenly, Draco stopped and his eyes flew wide, staring at Harry.
The relief was palpable in the room, a collective sigh and the release of tension could be felt. Robards spoke then.
Harry paused, trying to determine the answer to her question but his unsteady emotional state seemed to make the decision for him. “No, not really.”
Technically they had achieved their aim, had captured the Horcrux and destroyed it with all speed the moment they were in the clear.  As victories went, it was hollow, an open wound that ached.
“I wasn't skulking, you self-important arse,” Harry countered, his anger growing. “I was tending to
Harry stared after him for a moment, then jumped up, eyes wide in panic, stammered “Oh no,” and followed him in.
“Yes, well, you do often defy the laws of, really, everything.” Draco chuckled. “What’s her guess?”
His body's dependency on the stone was an unfortunate side effect of the magical cloning process no one knew how to solve. They prepared his dose with aching slowness that had him grinding his teeth at the incompetence. Snatching the completed potion, he downed it in one gulp.
Peter had been a friend of his father’s, a link to his parents that Harry had treasured despite his dislike of the man himself. But it was not a pain Harry had time to dwell on. “We’re going to need to push them back to get to the door.”
“Yeah, you are,” Harry said quietly.
If I’m honest, I’ve called you Draco in my head since seventh year, though I’ve never had the guts to call you that to your face for fear of being hexed.  I appreciate the effort on your part. I just really wanna move forward, you know and well, hmm, the truth is, I had a lot of shit to sort out after the war and I guess I wasn’t ready before.  Seeing you here all the time has reminded me of the years
“Merlin, Harry,” he mumbled. “It’s a miracle.”
“I can walk. Merlin.” Draco groused but he got up slowly, reaching back for Harry’s arm to steady himself when the lightheadedness hit hard. Harry eased him back onto the sofa and went to grab their cloaks. Both now properly attired, and Draco back on his feet, Harry wrapped his arms around his husband’s slender frame and apparated them to St. Mungo’s entrance.
"I'm sure. The old ghost is really moving it this time. He must be getting desperate."
"And when we destroy them all ...?"
"Don't be like that. She's just excited." Harry patted the mizzenmast. The wood vibrated under his hand as though in response.
‘The Marauder’ ploughed into the enemy like a dog into a flock of birds. The quick and clever ones managed to scatter, ships going every direction, a couple running into each other. The lead ship tried to turn but too late. The galleon rammed the middle, wood and weapons and sailors flying off in every direction. The loud crack of the collision was followed by the ear-splitting screech of the hull cleaving in two.
“We did, we do, but, Harry,” Draco said, his eyes trained fully on his companion, “I can’t manage this on my own.”
“No one deserves it more, sweetheart,” Andi said, then raised her hand and smiled. “I’m going to say hi to Cissy.”
Before Harry could answer, Draco grabbed Harry's arms.
The major project of the lab revolved around constructing a body for the Dark Lord to be reunited with his ghost. Unfortunately, most of the avenues under investigation stalled out as they required the blood of his mortal enemy. No one could figure out how to take the man down, let alone extract blood.
"No harm done." The tech wandered off.
“That you are,” Harry laughed as Draco slipped his arm around Harry’s waist and pulled him closer. Harry felt the familiar tug of apparition in his belly that threatened the relative calm he had so recently found.
Draco
Ron laughed. "Merlin knows how, but yes. 'The Burrow' is still back there."
Merlin, I’m sorry. That’s why this note is so incoherent, I didn’t want to waste any time. I didn’t want you to think you’d done anything wrong. You didn’t. Merlin I hope you are in your rooms… Please be there to get this note. I had prepared my return letter, I just hadn’t finished looking it over, I must have rewritten it thirty times. I wanted to be certain I had said it all the way I wanted. But it’s too late, I’m sending it as is.
A couple of hours later, sat at their kitchen table with multiple cups of coffee (Harry) and herbal tea (Draco) and a half eaten box of pastries (mostly Harry) between them, the couple looked at each other and both began to laugh, chuckles at first and then full out laughter. They laughed until they were out of breath. Still smiling, Harry drained his cup and stood, holding out his hand to his husband.
“Why doesn’t he feel well, Daddy? I bet I could make him feel better,” the toddler offered. “He likes it when I make him laugh.”
in protective custody?”
“Mr Potter–”
Draco’s smile dimmed a little and he shook his head slowly. “Don’t feel well,” he mumbled.
Gathering his courage, Harry spoke to Draco as he rose to leave after lunch. “Draco?” he asked hesitantly.
Then those things were his.
Harry let the adrenaline from their unexpected arrival carry him forward, assured that Neville would take care of his ship. The mark of a great leader was delegation and allowing his men to do their job. Harry’s job was to make the lives of the men on board
“Seriously? Even if it was horrible attention?”
“Dr. Smithers,” Harry said, a confused look on his face, “I didn’t expect to see you tonight.”
As long as it worked, Harry decided.
Harry cringed inwardly, knowing he was in no frame of mind to handle anything emotional but he also didn’t want to undo the progress they’d all made. Reluctantly, he nodded and went to get up to get her a chair when one popped into place next to his right arm. He looked over, watching her sit while behind her, her husband and son left the room without a sound.
"My lungs still hurt," the clone said. It was the truth, but not the reason. He had no intention of sharing the real reason for his hurry.
The book was not his. Was there truly nothing that was his?
shocking people.  Seriously, Draco, I suspect you’re much more pleasant to be around than you want to let on.  High maintenance, no doubt, but at least I won’t be bored and fawned all over like so many others that I’ve tried to date.  Sometimes being “The Saviour” sucks. I mean, seriously, I hate all those fucking labels. It might be a challenge keeping up with you but at least you’ll treat me like a real person.  Let's make plans. It's a date!
Bright red hair stood out like a beacon against all the wood as Harry's best friend came to stand by his side, broom in hand. "We ready?" Harry asked, glancing up at his much taller shipmate. Harry was not short but Ron's long lean frame dwarfed even him.
The techs shut down about dinner time. The clone concluded that if he skipped the kitchens until later he did not run into anyone there. While he waited, he would follow people around by tracking the sound of footsteps, or conversations.
“But why?” Draco’s quiet voice interrupted the two, “Why of all doctors are you here?”
“No, that’s not possible,” Harry said.
“Not before a shower and breakfast, you cretin,” Draco snapped, his sharp words accompanied by a gentle cuddle and then a nudge up.
The techs in the lab would speak freely around him. Intrigue and political maneuverings were often discussed as well as occasional secrets of state that should be carefully guarded. Whoever shared such information would look around before speaking. Their eyes would slide right over him.
The next day, the lab techs experimented on the clone's lungs. The day passed with the slowness of a decaying body. They pushed him to exercise so hard that his chest burned, and he felt blood coming up the back of his throat as he fought to breathe.
The Malfoy estate sat on one of the islands clustered along the Narrows, near the capital, alongside many of the ancestral homes of the rest of the sacred twenty-eight. The capital sat on one of the largest land masses centrally located in the magical archipelago, a large chain of islands magic users migrated to generations ago.
Harry gave him that half amused half challenging look that answered without words.
‘Definitely far easier,’ he thought as he watched Draco interact with their shared families and friends. Finally, the emptiness Harry carried inside him was gone, and love had filled those empty places.
Sighing, the clone remembered fondly the days when the techs tested easy stuff, like how fast he aged. They decided to track his growth by not cutting either his hair or his nails. The thin, fragile nails did not last long. The clone started biting them to keep them at a reasonable length.
They looked at each other and then Ron cleared his throat. “The thing is, mate, well, you know the Malfoys were in protective custody after their trials, waiting for Lucius to finish testifying and remaining Death Eaters to be captured.”
There was a long silence, and Harry realised he'd been holding his breath. He let it out slowly, quietly, not wanting to reveal himself if it could be avoided. He hoped they would just leave and be none the wiser to their certainly unwelcomed interloper. After such an awkward breakfast, he felt himself horribly on edge and off centre in his own home.
if you prefer. I invite you to call me
"Is it even capable of understanding us?" Draco asked with a sneer.
“Hey, love,” Harry said quietly. “How are you feeling?” Harry watched as Draco’s hand went instinctively to his abdomen and saw those grey eyes pop open and search for him, panicked.
The man himself stood on the raised quarter deck of his flagship. He cut an impressive figure, broad chested with muscled arms and legs. The tricorn caught under one arm allowed the wind to play through his curls, concealing and revealing his famous scar, as it whipped his long black coat around his legs. Under the coat he wore a white shirt, ties open to display the firm chest beneath and loose brown trousers tucked tight into well fitted tall boots with shiny buckles.
Neville held his port course until the last cannon discharged before flipping the wheel hard to starboard, correcting to head back into the battle. 'The Phoenix' turned with an ease that seemed to defy the water she cut through.
Lee Jordan was brilliant.
Just another experiment.
There was a moment when everything paused in the face of the bright light. As his eyes adjusted Harry saw further than he could in the gloom. On the far side of the hold Peter Pettigrew stood next to the floating ghostly form of the disembodied Voldemort.
"My Horcruxes were expertly hidden!" Voldemort continued to rant about his latest loss.
“Try not to worry, I'll be there for you as much as work allows” Harry assured him. “We’ll sort it all, I promise. For now, just relax and rest, yeah?”
Sirius and 'The Marauder' were one of the deadliest combinations to sail the seas.
Harry snorted. “That’s an understatement, Kingsley. I paid my dues, did my duty and then some! We're not making this a recurring theme here, is that clear?” Harry looked him in the eye and waited.
"Time to dance," Harry said. "Start the zig zag attack pattern."
Placing his fork on his plate, Harry wiped his hands and mouth with his napkin and took a sip of juice. “Tell me the theme of the dinner.”
The next morning he awoke surrounded by the remains of his meal, lying on the floor of the passageway and shot to his feet, panicked. If they discovered him gone, they would track him down and his new-found freedom would be stolen away.
Ron threw his head back and laughed.
Just then, the door opened and Molly came in, followed by Arthur carrying Scorpius, his hand firmly over the toddler’s mouth. Wide grey eyes underneath a shock of white blond hair locked onto Harry's, and Harry moved quickly to relieve Arthur of his burden.
Rather than flying an identifying flag, someone had painted the words "The Burrow" on the side of the hull in lopsided letters. The name referenced an early home the Weasleys had been forced to abandon in their fight against the increasing power of Voldemort and his new government.
Squaring off right in front of where Voldemort retreated, he cast the first spell.
Glad you found this note under your breakfast plate. Would you like to know a secret? I put you in charge of dishes so I would have time to get ready. I know you always start with the cups and saucers, then the silverware, finally the plates. You are easy to predict. I’m yours, Harry Potter. I’m somewhere in the castle students can't find. Using the map is cheating. Come and find me. I love you, I’m in love with you, and when you reach this mystery location, I will not be wearing nearly enough clothing for my mother's sense of propriety and decorum. Hurry up, I'm waiting...
With the current test, the clone focused on enduring the pain without making a sound, a game he played to engage his mind. It helped keep him distracted but also his screams would bother the other residents of the lab. When he lost control, they would have him gagged.
Finally, it's the night of the Yule Ball and their "coming out" with a few cuddles along the way.  Enjoy!
“I know we decided their names at home,” Harry said, “but I didn't want to make it official without you, love. Our baby girl with the purple blanket was born first.”
Cedric was as good at deflecting spells with his double handed iron axe as he was with his wand. Iron had always been impervious to magic. The magnificent weapon absorbed the Avada Kedavra as easily as any other spell.  No one else was as good as Cedric at casting with a two handed weapon.
“Yes, love?”
The clone sighed and leaned back, the wall cold against his bare back except where his long hair protected him. He didn't get a chair, and was used to standing for hours. No one else in the lab moved.  Voldemort was just getting started.
I never expected that I’d one day find myself in charge of the Ravenclaw team, but they needed a coach. My Slytherin roots will never leave me, but that said, I now have two teams to root for to destroy Gryffindor. And trust me, we will. Calcagno is an excellent keeper and I’ve taught Piper some of my finest moves. I may not have beaten you in school, but this is the year Gryffindor goes down.
Harry, I liked you since before we first met. You were a story my mother used to tell me about a boy my age who was loved by his mother and was so special he saved the world from a bad man. I didn’t know what that meant, but I had a mother who loved me, and she said I was special, but I couldn’t save her from the bad man.
Throwing knives were the specialty of Luna Lovegood. She preferred them to spells and they were much harder to block. Luna would enchant them with her own brand of magic that made them seem to turn corners at her command. It was like she told them to seek out the enemy and they would obey.
"Did you need that today more than normal?" the tech inquired.
“If there is nothing else, Mr Potter, I would very much like an early night. It has been a difficult twenty-four hours,” Narcissa said with a tired smile.
“It’s your turn, Cedric,” Harry said again. “I’ll see you on the other side.”
No one viewed the clone as anything but an 'it'.   Not human. Not real.
Curse bombs splashed the water around the ships, transforming it into mud; this prevented any fast manoeuvring and made them easier targets for the brooms. The decks themselves were covered in smoke. The closest broom riders used a modified Bubble-Head charm that allowed them to breathe easily, but everyone near the enemy fought blind.
“Thanks, love. I think I’ll start with toast and tea and go from there.”
“No need for Ron and Hermione. I set the charms and spells myself with Professor Flitwick’s help and they are tuned to their DNA and polyjuice doesn’t change that. I can key you in as well.”
The clone had never been given a wand, but several of the journals discussed wandless magic. The trick, he discovered through trial and error, required focusing his mind. More so than wand-based, wandless magic tended to be wild as it needed a channel to focus it. Harnessing it demanded he brought his mental energies to a sharp point, allowing no distractions, before engaging his magical core. It took several long nights of practice, but the clone had plenty of time.
"Not the last," Harry replied, "but close. Really close."
Harry's boarding team started scrambling out from the lower deck to join in the well wishes, Peter Pettigrew with them. The small rat of a man immediately came to stand by Harry's side as one well practiced in positioning himself next to the most powerful person available.
Harry,
Draco paused and finally looked up then, looking as though searching Harry’s face for something before shaking his head. “Thank you,” he said quietly, “but I think I will rest as well. Yesterday was...difficult.”
The characteristic bowspirt that traditionally stuck out the front had been moved and now functioned either as a fourth mast ... or a clothesline.
Harry and Cedric both shook from exhaustion when the tide of the battle unexpectedly changed again.  A rain of spells from above came down on the heads of their enemy.  The Marines fell back under this new attack.
On dark parchment with singed edges, done in a small, tight hand -
“What about you?”
“But that is a hero, Harry. A hero is someone who does the right thing as best they can, in spite of being scared, in spite of being unsure, in spite of being uncomfortable. You were our hero, that day you took us in to protect us.” Draco said quietly, his regret rising like a physical lump in his throat. “I know that wasn’t easy for you, especially with my father or with me, really. I was so horrible to you. I’m not sure I’ve ever properly said thank you. I have my family back, alive and much wiser, so thank you.”
“Here they are, Scorpius, your sisters. This is Lily in the purple blanket and Narcissa in the yellow one.”
Harry teased Cedric that no one that handsome should be put in the thick of combat, but the truth was there were few sailors as proficient as he at subduing a ship.
“Eavesdropping, Potter? This is rude, even for you.”
With a heavy sigh, Harry dragged himself upstairs and tossed his glasses on the bedside table. Casting a silencing charm, Harry dropped across the middle of the bed and fell into a hard, deep sleep.
The end of day rituals the techs executed seemed to take forever. The Sorcerer's Stone was removed from the safe and a small amount extracted. After so many nights of watching the procedure, the clone knew he could execute the steps to make the elixir of life twice as fast as any wizard. Unfortunately, he was not allowed to touch.
Voldemort was so careful to function as though he had a body. He would float through the door only when someone opened it and remained with his feet in proximity to the floor. Only when upset, usually in regard to Harry Potter, would he act like a disembodied spirit.
“Yes, just like us.” Draco’s voice dropped into a soft whisper. “One day, they got the best news ever. They weren’t just having one baby, they were having two babies. Two little girls, and their son would be a big brother to both of them.”
It was a dream.
Switching topics again, you need to be more careful. You left a mark on me. Minerva noticed and asked if I was seeing someone and reminded me that if I was, I was welcome to bring them back to my rooms as long as, and I quote, ”the lady and I could be discreet and professional around students, and she passed a ministry background check for the safety of the children.” I shot tea out of my nose, and I think I turned so red the mark just blended in at that point. Luckily, (unluckily? I can’t decide) Sybill interrupted, pointing out that marks that appear on the body have different meanings and omens based on their location. She then spent 10 minutes trying to decide if it was technically on my neck or my shoulder as she poked and examined it while I tried to bat her off to no avail. Say, Harry, did you know that a mark on the right side of your neck portends auspicious events in your home, but a mark on the right shoulder means unpleasant news? Because I do now! Thanks, ever so. Oh, and guess where she decided, in the end, the mark was? Merlin, I hope she’s wrong and it’s the neck. Somebody please kill me. I thought once I was an adult my days of being embarrassed about hickies would be over…
He was on the hunt for such a place when he stumbled upon another wonder.
The doctor frowned slightly, checked something in the chart and then turned back to Draco. “Your weight is up, but this could just be due to stress-eating.”
“Yes, two of them. Your daughters, gentlemen.” The doctor stilled the image so that the babies’ faces were turned toward their dads.
“Mr Harry Potter, sir, Winky is being ready to make dinner now.”
“Draco, love, everything is fine, I promise. I wouldn’t lie to you,” Harry assured him.
Harry nodded, then released his hold, got to his feet and held out his hand to help his friend up.
The boarding party cleared the deck in no time.
“I have a board meeting at 11, but I can take you to Mungo’s first. If you want me to stay with you, just say the word and I’ll reschedule.”
“Come on, sweetheart,” Molly said gently. “I am going to make cookies, and I need a helper if I’m going to finish them on time. If we work quickly, we can take them to George at the shop before we go to meet your sisters tomorrow, ok?”
"You sure it's going to be there?" Ron asked.
“Okay, not Muggles, a Muggle holiday I’m not familiar with perhaps? No? Hmm, okay. A picnic, celebrating with a summer picnic in the dead of winter? No. Okay, let’s break this down. You aren’t sick. Special dinner with the good china and balloons. Muggle candy, barbecue, baby greens salad, baby vegetables, buns in the-”
“In here, love,” he responded as he placed the pancake and a slice of bacon on Scorpius’ plate.
Harry thought for a moment, then looked at Winky. “Will that work for you, Winky?”
“Are you happy about the baby?”
“Kingsley,” Harry said, taking his usual chair, “what is the development?”
“You wouldn’t.”
“Aww, thanks. I’m glad you’re enjoying it,” Harry said between bites. “I still want you to guess the theme though.”
"We're upstairs," Harry called out and looked at Draco before putting down the paintbrush and walking towards the stairs. When he saw Kingsley and Head Auror Robards followed by Ron and Hermione, he swallowed hard. This was something serious. "Kingsley?"
"Close the gun ports! Secure the guns!" Came the frantic cry of the gunnery sergeants.
Laughs, you’re right of course.  Detention never stopped me
Draco paused, a sauce-covered rib held carefully between delicate fingertips. “Harry, what does that mean? What, exactly, is going on?”
. I hadn’t noticed.
Long fingers caressed softly where their babies were growing. Harry could hear the awe in Draco's voice.
Harry,
No one dared suggest Voldemort's ideas were anything less than brilliant. Any hint at such a thing often led to death and dismemberment, which may have been where they got all the extra corpses. No, everyone agreed the fault must lie with someone else.
“I feel like we’re the lions on Noah’s Ark,” he whispered to her, giggling at the absurdity of it all.
“I wish I bloody was,” Pansy muttered into his ear.
Such fickle friends Maude and Victoria were; not long ago they were clinging to Draco’s robetails like lost little lambs. Daphne, by contrast, had always been something that scared Draco; her own person. As the only muggleborn Slytherin in their year, one might assume her blood status was the reason she never moulded to Pansy’s clique but honestly, Pansy had never given a shit about all that until Draco began to. No, truthfully, Daphne was resistant to their beguiling charms. Suppose it all came good for her in the end, Draco thought bitterly.
“SLYTHERIN,” the hat repeated once more as if everyone hadn’t already heard.
“C’mon Draco, open your eyes.” The irritated voice of his friend Millicent was entirely unwelcome.
“Huh,” Pansy replied absentmindedly, rubbing her hand over her left forearm.
“No song this year,” croaked the Hat apologetically. “Simply wasn’t time to write two. Took enough convincing for me to go along with this façade—.” A look from McGonagall stopped it mid-sentence.
“You’ve got no right to talk, Zabini,” hissed Potter in a barely contained whisper. Draco suppressed an eye roll. Why does he always have to be so bloody impassioned?
Headmistress McGonagall chose that moment to walk primly into the entrance hall, taking her place on the tall stone steps in front of the students. She wore the same emerald green robes Draco had seen her in so many times as a Professor, but they were accentuated by a new cool shroud of authority. “Students,” she spoke, voice as thin as ever.
God, Draco just wanted to go home. But the wheels of the Hogwarts Express had begun to turn and he rolled out of the station with it. Watching the hills blur, his own words were stuck on rotation in his mind.
at the transfiguration skills needed for healing. Had an aptitude for it, as McGonagall once told him, so no, his father had not made any kind of donation, thank you very much. Of course, plans changed once Minster Shacklebolt announced a ban on all former Death Eaters and their children taking roles as healers or teachers. He knew he would survive, adaptable as he was; but still, the memory stung.
Her voice grew marginally more sympathetic when Mandy’s waterworks set off Lisa Turnip and several other girls from their house. “Albus Dumbledore was of the belief that we sort too soon. After all you have been through this year, it seems to me that none of you are the same people you were aged eleven.”
Feeling like Anne Boleyn on the way to the chopping block, Draco took his seat as his name was called. From this vantage point, he could see Blaise giving him an ironic thumbs-up and Millicent looking more out of place than a Basilisk in a barnyard. He tried not to meet the disapproving stares of anyone else.
“Like we all had a chance,” Millicent hissed back. Pansy’s head, previously impassive and downturned, shot up, as if she meant to spew venom like they did when back they thought there was nothing they were capable of losing.
“Our old friend has switched ranks,” Blaise intoned, crossing his legs disdainfully like some kind of peeved cat. “He’s being fraternising with Antony Goldstein and Michael Corner. That lot.”
“No,” Draco muttered, eyes defiantly squeezed shut, hands glued tight to his luggage. “I shan’t. You can’t make me.”
“That’s enough,” McGonagall’s lips couldn’t help but twitch into a smile. “While I am sure you all expected to be elsewhere by now, these are unprecedented times. I want to begin by thanking you for returning despite the horrific conditions many of you endured here last year.”
“Goyle’s, er, not doing so great,” Pansy replied cautiously. The unarticulated agreement to avoid mentioning Vincent at all costs felt dense in the air, trapping words behind Draco’s teeth. “I doubt he’s going to turn up. I haven’t spoken to him since-”
Blaise rolled his eyes derisively. “What, like Witch Weekly? S’not like anything I hear is enough would be enough for whatever expose you’re planning.”
“Shit, sorry, I didn’t realise–” he stammered, stepping back as if he was the one with a reason to hide. The carriage froze over with an icy silence; no one moved to break it.
Shocked gasps and noises of protest echoed around the room. Draco’s hand’s balled into nervous fists. Somewhere across the room, Mandy Brocklehurst of Ravenclaw started crying.
“Lucky you, then,” muttered Pansy. Silence fell over the carriage like a cloak. Blaise’s bewitching mother, hailed as the closest a human has come to enchanting as many men as a siren, had whisked him away to muggle Rome for much of the war. Jealousy threatened to rise up Draco’s throat but the thought that Blaise didn’t have to be sitting here with them right then forced it back down into his lungs.
Draco supposed he should pay attention to the endless welcoming speeches; it was his last year, after all. But the names of the dead would be brought up incessantly and he didn’t have the mental fortitude to deal with guilt right then. Instead, he turned his attention to the slim book of Granger’s creation.
That earned her a serious nod from Millicent: “why, I always knew you saw through my hard exterior to the cuddliness within.”
Draco rested his forehead against frosted glass and let their bickering fade into a murmur. “Chin up,” his mother had said that morning, with the breezy faux-positivity upper-class women performed so well. Draco scowled inwardly. Knowing his mother, it was likely just a jab at his pointy chin. Letting the cold centre him, he gave into his weighted eyelids once more. In and out, in and out. He could get through this.
Slowly, Potter re-joined his friends, avoiding all eye contact with his new housemates. Draco snorted. “Practice what you preach.”
“Potentially,” he nodded, guarded as ever. “Why do you ask?”
“SLYTHERIN,” it bellowed.
“Thank you, Miss Granger,” McGonagall returned to the stage with the Sorting Hat resting on a wobbly stool. “Without further ado, come up and be Sorted when your name is called.”
Ah. Here they were then. Draco thought it quite impressive how Blaise Zabini’s voice managed to carry his signature haughtiness even when muffled. Millicent caught his eye with a slight smirk, then slid open the carriage door.
Beneath his racing thoughts an idea was beginning to form.
A reflective tranquillity fell across the group as their boats bobbed gently along the water. Draco knew everyone’s mind was on the last time they’d been here; he just hoped no one lingered on his particular role.
He looked around at his friends as Hannah Abbott was placed into Gryffindor, much to the delight of Neville Longbottom. Everything was happening far too suddenly.
Conversations dipped in and out of focus like an old radio: “…can you believe what Trevor…”, “…not a chance mate!”, “…I told you we wouldn’t be late…” and Draco winced every time a voice sounded familiar. The suitcase clipping at his heels felt a little like karma.
“Parvarti told me you weren’t coming back,” he said simply. It took a beat for Draco to realised it was directed his way. There was no bite to it, but he shifted in his seat regardless.
“Although your place of learning was desecrated, I would like to ensure that the following year is as fulfilling for you as possible,” the headmistress continued. “It is my belief that healing would be better achieved through unity and as such I have elected to create a space exclusively for Eighth Years. You will be sharing a common room.”
“That’s not an answer, Draco,” he prodded.
They boarded the rickety little boats in twos and Draco was reminded of his first year, when he fit in one boat with Blaise, the Patil twins and Lavender Brown. The place they were now would have seemed unthinkable; Lavender dead, the twins mourning, and Draco left trying to catch a breath whilst picking up the pieces of his old life. Sitting alone with Pansy, he yearned for that budding optimism he felt before the future fell into place.
“As you may have been informed, there will be greater changes to this school year,” Minerva said sternly, as if pre-empting controversy. “These decisions have been reached through consultation with your representatives on the Student Council.”
Etched into the leather-bound cover was a portrait of a hummingbird in flight. Inscribed below were the words ‘mea navis aëricumbens anguillis abundant’. On the inside cover, Granger had inked in gold a list of instructions. Essentially, the book was to be used to share information on classes, job openings and events. How awfully boring.
“Don’t pretend you know what it was like for them,” Blaise interjects sharply. Draco is grateful that Potter’s gaze settles elsewhere.
He couldn’t help but disagree.
Potter sat down gently, placing the old hat on his head. Barely had it touched his hair when it opened its mouth to answer. Here we go, Draco thought.
“Thanks for all your help, Princess Draco,” Millicent glowered as she finally took her seat. “Anyway, I wouldn’t worry about it. S’not like any one of us is going to end up in a different house.”
“SLYTHERIN.”
Draco couldn’t stop thinking about Harry Potter.
“Keep your hair on,” Pansy hissed back. “We’re all just as rotten as the day we arrived.”
The remainder of the Sorting was relatively uneventful. Granger and Weasley, of course, remained Gryffindor’s. A surprise, although not an unwelcome one, came when his old friend Parvarti joined him in Slytherin.
Soon, dinner was to begin and a new year was to be marked. Millicent’s attempts to rejoin them on the way in were repeatedly rebuffed by McGonagall; eventually, she relented and left Draco with an elbow to ribs and a promise of death “if you ever leave me alone in the common room with Sally-Anne Perks.” Parvarti separated from them as they cascaded through the Great Hall entrance way for the feast, the thought of which had reawakened Draco’s stomach. Presumably, she was going to chaperone Potter.
Draco looked at Pansy with wide-eyed horror.
“The snakes, more like,” she whispered back darkly. The furtive looks cast at them by other returning students concurred with her statement.
The evening September air was something of a tonic. Piling out of the train in freshly changed robes with his fellow students, or ‘the great unwashed’, as the clipped tones of Blaise described them, felt familiar if not quite comfortable.
“God help us.”
Potter’s stare was fixed right on him. Draco wished he could send himself to Coventry.
Draco’s eyes flickered to Granger’s. The steel in her gaze, neither cold nor forgiving, made him recoil back into himself. His own words rung in his mind like a cacophony.
“Hush,” McGonagall commanded the chaos. “I do not mean to separate friendships. The common room with ensure time can be spent with those closest to you. But you will room with and wear the colours of your new house.”
Humiliation coiled in Draco’s stomach. Potter took one last impenetrable glance into the carriage before taking off after his friends.
The wait with bated breath went on for a long time. Almost long enough that Draco expected Millicent to roll her eyes, declare herself Slytherin and be done with it, but then—
Returning for eighth year had never been the plan. Ever since fifth year, he’d had a cushy St Mungo’s apprenticeship lined up for post-graduation; despite what everyone thought, Draco was
“Information is power. That’s what you always say,” he spoke, raising his voice slightly as a first year was loudly welcomed into Gryffindor. “What if we controlled the spread of information? If we were the spiders in the web?”
“…well, I modified it to create a yearbook of sorts!” Hermione continued brightly. “You can write whatever you’d like in your copy, and everyone else will see it in theirs for a one-day period.”
“Protect him from the nasty Death Eaters, I suppose,” Pansy helpfully supplied, lowering her tone as she uttered the dirty phrase.
Oh. Draco felt his face reddening. He had forgotten that many of his classmates had been here more recently than him, even staying for weeks at a time to help mend the castle’s lacerations.
“Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in,” Pansy Parkinson drawled, albeit with just a shadow of her former bite. Draco flipped her off begrudgingly before flopping down next to her and resting his head on her shoulder. Her formerly gaunt cheekbones had filled out a little since he last visited, Draco noted approvingly. Maybe the pride in her that seemed as fragile as a wounded bird in the weeks following the battle was somewhat reanimated.
The sprawl of Platform 9¾ was punctuated by the shouts of excitable preteens and proudly sported house colours. Parents in robes that must have made the muggles of King’s Cross shake their heads in conservative disapproval held onto the sleeves of teens desperate to take the first train away from home. And there it was, brick red coat unchipped since he first saw it seven years ago, the Hogwarts Express. Bursts of chattered excitement exploded above the heads of the teeming crowd all around them; it gave Draco a headache.
Before Draco could interject and say something disgustingly soppy, McGonagall saved him: “Bulstrode, Millicent”. Milly grinned at them, hiding her nervousness, before taking the hat to her head.
The leaden weight that has been resting in the pit of Draco’s stomach drops. “Re-Sorted? What the fuck?”
“So much for house unity,” Blaise remarked icily, relaxing his posture despite barely appearing tense during the interaction.
Bouncing on the balls of her feet nervously, Draco watched Fay Dunbar join Millicent, Terry Boot and Susan Bones become Gryffindor’s and Maude Davis return to Slytherin, much to Pansy’s chagrin. Potter was up next, an obvious one, Pansy thought decidedly. No way could their glorious saviour, the Boy Who Lived himself, be from any house but Gryffindor.
A smattering of applause began courtesy of Seamus Finnegan, before all around Draco, hands were taken up in rapturous clapping. Dutifully, he joined in but his enthusiasm was tempered by the memory of McGonagall banishing his entire house to the dungeons. Millicent’s hands, too, hung loosely by her sides.
Draco darted a glance at Pansy. While the gamekeeper was selling it as a luxury, he guessed it had more to do with the vast numbers of students in their year group who would now be able to see the thestrals pulling the horseless carriages. Draco shivered in a way that had little to do with the autumn chill and pulled the sleeve of his robe further past his left forearm.
“You’ve even got the stubbornness of a Hufflepuff,” the Hat hummed, amused. Oh, holy mother of Merlin. “But you want to return to Slytherin, don’t you? Your pride could never let you be anywhere else. Well, make use of it then. Channel that ambition; for whatever purpose, just don’t let it go to waste.”
carriage. Standing in the doorway was the Boy Who Lived himself, looking like he’d just rolled out of bed after a night on the firewhiskey.
Following Millicent’s lead through the masses of foolishly optimistic young witches and wizards, Draco kept his head determinedly down. He hadn’t glanced anyone from his year yet but he couldn’t help the shame that bubbled up in him at the prospect; the losses of the previous year were still too raw for his presence not to feel like an aberration. Millicent looped a protective arm round his shoulder, pulling him into her side as if reading his thoughts. Draco almost wanted to laugh; at school, Milly had always been the bodyguard to his queen bee.
“You interrupted my tirade,” said Blaise in lieu of an introduction as Millicent hefted their luggage into the overhead carriers. “Don’t you want to know the gossip?”
By ‘that lot’ he meant the Ravenclaw’s with decent bloodlines. So that’s why Nott had stopped returning their owls. Shrewd of him, Draco noted. He’d picked friends who erred on the right side, both of history and his family’s approval.
“I don’t mean like the Prophet,” he returned, excited now the idea had taken root in his mind. “I’m talking about in Hogwarts. What if we could get some kind of leverage back? You think I’m onto something, don’t you Pans?”
“Didn’t think any of you would have the nerve to show up.” Weasley spat back, lip curled in disgust.
“Must we mention the boggart in the closet?” Draco sighs. “Surely people must understand that we were children?” It sounds weak even to his ears.
“Go on then Rita Skeeter,” Draco indulged sardonically. He knew Blaise would tell him regardless of his teasing. He so adored being the gatekeeper of information; knowledge is power, as he was fond of saying with dramatic intonation.
And of course, like their luck hadn’t been bad enough that year already, Potter flung open the door of
“Oh, you’ve grown up, that’s for sure,” the Hat read his thoughts. “And seen things you shouldn’t have. I’m half a mind to put you into Gryffindor.”
Shrugging off the silence, he asked, “where are Greg and Theo?”. Millicent suddenly found something very interesting out of the window. Please; Draco had only asked about Theodore Nott for Milly’s sake, that great lumbering git with eyebrows like fat slugs.
Draco hummed irritably. “Do you really want to spend a whole year repenting? It’s not like us to just lie down and play dead.” He was met with half-hearted noises of acquiescent.
“Eighth years, this way! Yeh won’ be going by carriage this year, get yer selves on the boats with the first years!”
Blaise snorts. “You’d better be nicer Pansy. You’re going to be doing a lot of kissing arse this year. Even to the Hufflepuffs.”
“Not likely,” Blaise grimaced. “That same friend mentioned something about penalties for students involved in the Dark Arts.”
Milly’s face was a mirror when she caught his eye, stumbling down to the Hufflepuff’s as if in a daze. The only comfort was the terror etched onto the face of Earnest Macmillan.
Since the funeral. That subdued, ill-attended affair. Attending the wake of a Death Eater’s son felt like something akin to drinking in a speakeasy during Prohibition. If anything, it made Draco thank Merlin that the Slytherin’s hadn’t fought; he wouldn’t be caught dead at his own funeral if was as drab as that.
Draco was grateful for the confines of the train’s aisle when Millicent had finally hauled his on board with a quick, “our lot are waiting in the usual carriage”. His luggage was noticeably lighter than years past; he had not thought it quite appropriate to outshine the other students with his collection of superfluous silk robes given the current climate. Oh well, he would find another superficial trait on which to stake his pride and identity, he was sure.
“Ow!” Draco yelled, indignant, but he was soon distracted by the reality he had been unsuccessfully trying to forget.
Ignoring them, Draco set his sights ahead on the castle where his formative years had played out. Even Hogwarts seemed smaller, as if it had been bent backwards into the wind; another remind that this was the year he was supposed to have graduated to bigger stages. Yet even Draco had to admit, there was a whimsical beauty to it, the reason that first boat trip brimmed with excitement. Orange candlelight flickered from turrets against the midnight sky, sending cascading reflections down onto the resting lake before him.
“Everyone within an eighty-foot radius can hear you, mate,” Blaise muttered. Draco, on the other hand, was more concerned with why they weren’t getting into the carriages like usual.
It didn’t matter what they thought; he had a purpose once more. Draco was going to rage, rage against the dying of his light.
“…you’d think that in eight years we’d turn up early at least once.” came the sudden voice of Harry Potter, somewhere down the train. Draco head snapped around, tension rising up his spine in an instant. Glances at the others echoed his silent prayer: please pick any other carriage but this one, you absolute buffoon.
A delicate laugh from just outside made Draco’s blood ice over. “I told you, Ron, that’s the clock your dad was tinkering with yesterday.”
“HUFFLEPUFF,” the hat roared.
Chatter about potential resorting was abuzz as they boarded the waiting boats. “I, for one, wouldn’t mind at all,” Daphne Greengrass, a fellow Slytherin with an outspoken orange fringe, loudly remarked. Maude Davis and Victoria Nettlebed were quick to hum to agreement.
“Representatives?” Blaise snorted under his breath, receiving a sharp glance from Potter that Draco could sense without even turning around. “More like Potter’s cronies and one token Ravenclaw.”
“A friend of my fathers’ who knows Flitwick,” Blaise leaned forward conspiratorially, “tells me that we’re going be re-Sorted this year”.
“We will spare you the dramatics and sort quietly in here; then you may go and join your new house to watch the first year’s Sorting Ceremony,” McGonagall informed them. “But first, a few words from your duly elected Student President, Miss Hermione Granger.”
Draco and Pansy shared a rare kind of mutual understanding that ran beyond friendship. That’s not to say it always involved tolerating the other’s presence, but Draco knew that she’d be there for life regardless. Since his grandmother’s death last year, the pool of those who truly knew him had been halved to one. Which was, he supposed, a little bit sad.
“Dumbledore’s Smarmy little arsewipes, more like,” Blaise whispered from his right. He shushed him, but secretly he was grateful for the attempt to lower the tone to the level they were used to. He needed a degree of spitefulness to combat the ugly, hot feeling of envy he felt when Hermione spoke about Transfiguration; even though no one credited him for it, in Draco's mind it was his talent.
Don’t, he thought with all his might.
Fucking hell, that was advanced magic. Draco had to hand it to her. Copies were passed around the room and everyone’s interested seemed to have been piqued.
“Love you too, Pansy.”
“You can do better anyway,” he smirked at Millicent. Blaise tittered. “Just the four of us then, I suppose”.
“…as I’m going to end up a Hufflepuff, I don’t care if I was friends with people who worked for Osama Bin Laden, it’s not my fault that your dad…”
Hurry up, Draco thought pointedly. The Hat merely laughed.
A painting depicting a young girl in Tudor dress was crowded full of girls painted in similar styles, giggling together as they looked beyond the frame. He watched as a Renaissance redhead’s face lit up at the words of another girl sporting a Victorian petticoat.
“Did you find any?” Ron asked, trying to keep the smirk off his face. No one but Luna and her dad believed that the Crumple Horned-Snorkack even existed.
Again, thank you so much for reading!
“I suppose it’s the
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” greeted McGonagall, her eyes gliding over the tables of students. “I am the Headmistress, Professor Minerva McGonagall and I know that all you new first-years will find a home in this school of witchcraft and wizardry. Before we begin the feast, I do have a few announcements to make.
“I’m reviewing,” she said. “We’ve been away from school for a whole year, and I don’t want to fall behind. If you knew what’s good for you, you’d do the same.” She looked pointedly at Harry and Ron.
He faced away from the snake cage and started towards the front door, but a flash of white and tan caught his eye. Harry whirled around and saw a small, spotted puppy.
“Oh good, you’re down!” Mrs. Weasley bustled over to the three friends when they reached the kitchen. “Your Hogwarts letters have arrived!”
The dog immediately noticed Harry and gave a tiny yip of recognition. It started to scratch at the fence of its pen. Harry smiled and made his way over to the little dog. He bent down over the enclosement and caught sight of a name tag reading
“HUFFLEPUFF
“Tell me about it.” Harry smiled. Even though Neville wasn’t quite as much of a media sensation as The-Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still saw quite a few articles gushing over Neville and his slaughter of Nagini.
He couldn’t seem to finish his sentence, but Neville finished it for him.
“What about Romania?”
“Cute ain’t she?” An older wizard seemed to appear out of thin air. He stood next to Harry and gave the puppy a pat on the head.
“We were going to stop by Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes,” Hermione said. “George is showing Charlie the ropes.”
“Great ‘Mione. Very authoritative,” Ron grinned and Hermione smiled back.
“Oh, well, er- I suppose a Galleon will do it. Though you’ll also need some food, a bed, toys...” Harry handed the man two golden coins and walked around the shop to pick up some supplies. “Very well. Let me get you a leash.”
“Probably will,” A voice piped up from the end of the table. Everyone turned to see George. It was as if the now lone Weasley twin had aged five years over the course of two months. He was smiling, but his eyes looked tired, sad. Harry noticed he had lost weight, so his clothes now hung off of him limply. “They really had a field day when you went into town with mum.”
The rest of the train ride passed in a blur of chocolate frogs and laughter. They changed into their school robes and stepped out of the Hogwarts express. All the laughter stopped as soon as the students caught sight of the carriages.
Harry shrugged. He stepped up and Madam Malkin began to measure him. He was thankful that she still treated him the same as she always had; it was nice to not be gawked at. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a flash of white blond hair and he gritted his teeth.
Malfoy turned around to face Madam Malkin, a snarl on his face. He opened his mouth to retort but something stopped him and his expression softened.
Madam Malkin smiled.
“Is she for sale?” Harry found himself asking. He wasn’t looking for a pet when he came in, but the cuddly puppy in his arms was starting to grow on him.
“Well yeah,” The man paused. “Though I don’t suppose most wizards would want a non magical dog. She’s been here a few weeks and no one’s shown any interest.”
“What do you mean?” Hermione asked.
Charlie originally came home for Fred’s funeral, but he had stuck around that entire summer. Even though he never said it, Harry suspected that Mrs. Weasley wanted someone around to help keep an eye on George once all the other Weasley siblings had gone off to Hogwarts.
“What? No!” Harry exclaimed, pushing himself into a sitting position behind the crouched Hermione. He kept his hand pressed against his skull. “I just hit my head against the floor when I fell out of bed. Thanks for that, by the way,” he added sarcastically.
“Blade, Balthazar!”
Harry felt himself relax when he stepped onto the Hogwarts express. Ginny left to find her friends and Hermione headed off to the Prefect’s cabin, leaving Ron and Harry to find an empty carriage. They found Neville and Luna in the back of the train and joined them.
Sure enough, three tawny owls were sitting on the table carrying three wax sealed envelopes. Harry, Ron, and Herminone hurried over to their owls and untied their letters. Harry felt the familiar sting of grief as he thought of Hedwig, but pushed the thought out of his mind and ripped open the envelope.
“The girl next to him?” Ambrose pointed at the dark skinned little girl Malfoy had told off.
Harry nodded. He had briefly forgotten Malfoy’s outburst in Madam Malkin’s two years ago. It seemed Madam Malkin had not.
Harry Potter, aged 18 years old, is returning to Hogwarts to finish his seventh year. Potter was supposed to complete his final year of schooling last year, but it’s common knowledge that he opted out of his studies to instead pursue his mission to defeat Voldemort, formerly known as He Who Must Not Be Named, alongside his sidekicks and companions, Hermione Ginger and Ronald Weasley.
“Who?” Harry heard an American accent pipe up from next to him. He turned to see Ambrose Kirk, one of the Gryffindor first years.
Hermione smiled and gave Ron a hug. After the initial excitement of Hermione’s announcement wore off, the three friends went back to examining their school lists.
“What are you reading anyways?” Ron asked while they were walking downstairs for lunch. “It’s not like we have any homework.”
The snake made no movement in its cage; it had barely even registered that Harry was there.
“Welcome back,” Dean answered. The Gryffindors filed into the common room, Hermione jogging in at the back end of the group. Ron turned to Harry.
The headline read
The Hogwarts students had never had the same DADA professor two years in a row. This year would be no exception.
“They wouldn’t have another Tournament.” Hermione paused. “Would they?”
“Dress robes are on the list again. I hope mum can get me some decent ones this time.”
“Oooh yeah, you could punch him in the face again. That’d be a nice warning,” Ron suggested. Harry laughed, remembering a sniveling third year Malfoy recoiling in horror after being punched by a girl.
“Professor Rubeus Hagrid: Head of Gryffindor House.” Hagrid stood, accidentally shifting the table due to his massive size.
“Alright,” Hermione nodded, standing up. “Anyway, breakfast is ready downstairs.” She offered her hand to Harry. He took it and stood alongside her.
There was a moment of quiet as the Gryffindors let McGonagall’s words sink in. Then, a smattering of applause and appreciative shouts erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione screamed louder than the rest of the table combined. Harry always wondered what house Hagrid had been in before he was expelled; now he didn’t have to guess anymore.
Mrs. Weasley came bustling into the room, carrying several plates teeming with various breakfast foods. She set the platters down on the table and smiled at Harry.
“Well we don’t know what’s good for us,” Ron joked. “That’s why we’ve got you.” He grabbed Hermione’s hand and squeezed it. She blushed and Harry looked away, pretending like he hadn’t noticed.
How Neville found Herbology so interesting was a complete mystery to Harry, but he was glad that his friend was happy. They continued talking, with Luna occasionally looking up from her edition of
He gazed up at the stars, thinking. Everything had changed, yet so much was still the same. Voldemort was gone, people had died, a war had been fought, but he was still shopping for school books in Diagon Alley and stressing about his N.E.W.Ts.
The next morning and the morning edition of The Daily Prophet over breakfast and then...
Harry smiled.
"Darling, perhaps Mr Potter can arrange for you to see your friends."
“For now, we use their blankets and bracelets in two different colours to keep them apart,” the doctor explained.
Harry,
“The house-elf heads,” Harry said as he walked past Draco and toward the stairs. Once in the entry, he stopped in front of the gruesome display and fought down a flush of bile. “This, this just…” Harry clamped his lips down and tore his eyes from the heads to look at Draco before continuing. “They don’t just come down, I tried. I also tried simple spells but then I stopped because I wasn’t sure if there might be some sort of curse attached.”
Good Morning Harry,
“She wants them here, in my house, with me protecting them,” he said with a sigh.
“For what? For cursing?” Narcissa asked kindly. “I’d think – given everything – that I can forgive a few odd words. I’ve learned to get over a lot of my previous... prejudices about people’s behaviours and to remember that only they know what they’ve gone through. And of course, I will call you
Draco,
“I’m worried,” Draco admitted.
“This is just … bizarre,” Draco said quietly. “There has to be an explanation.”
"Yes, love, so am I."
“Yes?” Draco replied, his voice still a bit frosty.
I can’t believe you just kissed me.
Harry and Neville exchanged a look but said nothing.
“Yes, Winky, we have guests. Would you provide full tea for eight, please?
While the lab techs tested his healing factor, he appreciated any distraction. A scholar applied intense heat to one area of his chest for extended periods of time. They were careful not to leave a scar, but a lot of pain could be inflicted without scarring. Prior to that, they'd used a scalpel.
“Right.”
Harry raised his captain's hat in greeting as the brothers circled above his head. The others joined in, creating a whirlwind of color and energy around their leader. He was their captain, their hope and their chance at a better world. Then the twins broke off with the rest of the broom brigade streaming behind, headed for the enemy ships.
“Mr Potter,” a kind voice said above his right shoulder.
“Come with me,” Harry said, holding out his hand.
His things were placed on a shelf near the spot he stood when he wasn't being poked and prodded. After a visit from Draco where the two of them exchanged almost identical expressions of disdain, one of the techs checked his stack of items.
Harry reclaimed his tea, cradling his favourite mug in both hands to keep them occupied. After taking a sip, he continued. “As for the rest, well, Winky is a Hogwarts house-elf who will be taking care of us. I don’t actually have a house-elf anymore, I just care for myself. Kreacher is far too old and has retired to Hogwarts. Headmistress McGonegall was kind enough to loan Winky to me for as long as we are in this situation. She will cook and clean, do laundry and such. To be clear,” Harry said, looking directly at Lucius now, his voice stern, “she is to be treated with respect and kindness. You will ask for what you need, not order her about. If there is a problem, bring it to me. You are not to discipline her in any way. Understood?”
Harry nodded. “Of course.”
“I will,” Harry said, and with a wave and a whoosh, Kingsley was gone.
Harry stared for a long time, barely noticing the tight grip Draco had on his hand. They were beautiful, his daughters, their daughters. Finally, one of his hands came up and wiped away the tears that had started to fall. “Merlin, we have two baby girls,” he breathed.
His fingers carded gently through Draco’s blond hair.
Fuck it.
“Would you like that, to have two little sisters to help and love?”
“How are you feeling? Do you need more sleep?”
“Partly, if I’m honest,” Draco admitted, looking over at his companion. “I mean, I grew up with the books and posters and toys of you. I was sent to Hogwarts directed to make friends with the great Harry Potter. Thing was, you weren’t what my parents or I expected.”
Harry sighed and took in several deep, cleansing breaths as he attempted to pull himself together.
He turned his head towards the question but the tears streaming down his face made it impossible to see. "The book should be on my ... on the shelf." They rarely corrected the clone when he used a possessive term except when Draco was around. Still, best not to get in the habit in case he slipped when it mattered.
“That’s true, they are,” Draco said, smiling at their son. “And you’ll be the best.”
I don’t know why they’d be concerned. I sit only a few places down from you at the head table and I’ve yet to launch a chicken breast in your direction, although I can’t say it hasn’t been tempting. Honestly Potter, could you please have a modicum of decorum and wear proper robes to the table? Jumpers and denim may make you look like the “cool teacher” but perhaps
The bohemian vessel settled back in the water with what looked like a big sigh.
On a greytoned, artfully singed parchment with a flourish on the side in a bold hand -
“Perhaps,” Draco murmured, “Perhaps.”
“Incredibly. There’s nothing I want more than to be married to you,” Harry said, leaning in for a kiss.
Teddy nodded and took off running.
“You heard the man,” Cedric called out. “Over the side.”
He looked at the man he loved and touched his cheek tenderly.
Narcissa’s words haunted him, an unexpected glimpse into all that Draco lost that day, and his heart broke a little, for Draco and the choice that was never really a choice, for the future Draco’d lost, and for all of those that he couldn’t save. A lump rose in his throat and he fought down sadness and anger and frustration. Maybe it was time to start moving forward, beginning perhaps with Draco.
Who am I kidding? I’m not going to tell the teacher. I’m much more creative than that when I want my way...
given your commanding presence and obvious intelligence.
“Nope,” Harry laughed as he dug into his dinner.
If you wear that grey top I picked out for you, I’m sure any touch of green would do to complete the outfit for the match this weekend. I might have an old scarf laying about from our school days. I quite like the idea of you in my old school scarf. But honestly, you are such a shameless flirt. It doesn’t matter what you wear, you can always sit next to me. I thought that was well established by now.
“With all due respect, that was his choice. He chose to take the mark, to let Death Eaters into the castle. I know he regrets it now, but still. It was his choice.” Harry's anger was now a living thing.
“Of course, Harry,” Kingsley said, offering a smile and taking a seat at the kitchen table, joined a moment later by Ron and Hermione.
Epilogue: 3 years later
“You is needing Winky, Mr Harry Potter, sir?”
“They are very good,” Harry assured him as Draco finally took his seat. “So, have you guessed the theme of our dinner yet?”
"We're going to be a family."
“So, you said you wanted to talk about me. What do you want to know?” He had been down this road before and didn’t particularly want to revisit it.
To his delight, he also heard tales of Harry Potter.
kitchen having your chat.”
Nobody has ever been so eager to touch me that they just...pounced...
“One down, eleven to go,” Draco said dryly.
“Captain … Potter … Harry …” Cedric’s voice broke.  Harry’s lieutenant did not need anyone to tell him this was a no-win scenario.
Draco Malfoy proved an exception. Upon graduation from Hogwarts, Draco's mother gifted him with an iron-hulled clipper, the 'Narcissa Star', one of the most cutting edge ships to sail the seas. The gleaming prize, the envy of each captain who caught a glimpse of her, was paraded out in full regalia as often as Draco could manage. Many of those trips resulted in him standing in Voldemort's secret lab, glaring at the clone.
The scenarios that unfolded in his head carried him through his days and strengthened him against his fears.  It was a promise he told himself when he felt brave and secure. These thoughts were foolish and impossible, but he whispered them to himself as he lay quietly at night and mouthed the words as he suffered the tortures of the lab.
Harry could tell that it was difficult for Lucius to ask Harry for this favour and he shook his head. “There’s no rush, all of you are welcome to stay until this is finished. We still have work left to do on the house, right, Draco?” Harry grinned at him, hoping to diffuse the tension.
“Yeah, I agree. It’s not my strong suit. Are you good at them?”
.  I’ve seen Calcagno fly and I agree on his skills.  Piper has some talent, no doubt, just needs some time.  Richmond is a promising seeker and the Olsens are killer beaters for Gryffindor so don't count us out just yet.  We can’t overlook Underhill’s seeker skills for Hufflepuff either. I watched him train the other day and he’s fearless.
“Hmm,” Harry said. “Merlin, that’s really disturbing and more than a little embarrassing,” he said, his lips held tightly as though fighting the urge to laugh. When an actual giggle pushed past his lips, Draco joined in and they laughed until they were breathless.
The cry went up from Jordan and the broom brigade wind tamers echoed it along. They all scattered in the face of the cannon-shot.
“Thanks, buddy,” Harry said, kneeling down and giving him a warm hug. “I’m so glad you’re here. You gonna go play with the others?”
“What would that be, then? Did you move into a Muggle flat that had hot and cold water coming from separate taps?” Harry asks, trying to lighten the mood, and feels more giddy than he should when Draco gives him a small smile.
“Yes and no,” replies Malfoy. He makes a bashful face then—and also a bit eager, like he has a story to tell. Another one to add to the ever-growing list of expressions his face can apparently take on, but which Harry has never seen.
“Potter,” Robards says, somehow soft but firm at the same time, “you’re doing this or nobody is.”
“What happened?”
Later, in the breathlessness of the afterglow, Draco collapses on top of him on the living room carpet, his lovely thighs clinging onto him still, his nose nuzzling Harry's neck; his hot mouth leaves soft, lingering kisses on Harry’s fluttering pulse, and he blabbers sweetly, senselessly in his ear about
Draco stands up and walks towards them, pulling his chair behind him. He sits down next to Harry. He’s close enough that Harry can smell the sweet scent of him.
And then he feels, with a greedy sense of clarity, that it’s not enough, and he grabs the back of Draco’s thighs and pulls him as close as physically possible, flush against him.
“Shut up, Potter,” Malfoy mutters into his wine, the tips of his ears going red almost instantly. And it’s so endearing, how he retreats into the shell he took a risk to come out of, that Harry’s heart swells with it, and he has to laugh.
The platform sneakers from before have made a return. They’re paired with light wash jeans, strings hanging out all over the bottom. But Harry suspects that’s a fashion thing. Over his cream jumper, he’s wearing a deep purple windbreaker. Harry notes how well it matches with his own jumper.
“Erm... I came to see Will?” He casts a quick glance at the post box just to double check.
Harry looks at her, and he feels so much gratitude. “I don’t care that you hate it when I’m sappy,” he says, grinning, “I appreciate you so much.”
He needs to stop. He needs to stop before he can’t, because he’s at the beginning of a slope now. He knows the pattern.
“Hermione is a vegetarian, too,” he says. Malfoy smiles at him. And it doesn’t make Harry feel anything warm, or think any silly thoughts. It makes him feel nothing at all.
Harry just stares and keeps staring, until Malfoy’s face blurs in front of him, until his eyes and his cheekbones and his nose don’t make sense anymore, until he has to zoom back out to see him again.
“They don't have magic, but—but the only way that makes them different is that they don't feel superior to others because of that. They're... just as brilliant and just as terrible as we are. In the same ways. The human condition, whatever it is, it's... nearly invariable."
He wonders if that, too, is on purpose, or if Robards is just the type of person who paid too much attention in Interrogation Techniques during Auror training and this is how he thinks normal human communication works.
“Potter, come have a smoke with me,” Malfoy says into the stretching silence, standing.
Harry is so shocked at first that he doesn’t know what to say, but then he gets sort of annoyed. Malfoy has refused to deem a single question of his with a proper answer, and now he expects Harry to know why the hell he’s acting the way he is? What for?
“Wait,” Malfoy says, his eyes glued to one of the paragraphs on the parchment. “I—I have to come to work with you? As in, I’ll have to come to the Ministry every single day?”
Harry frowns. “You mean... he’s out somewhere?”
“Yes,” Chandra says slowly.
“Merlin’s beard, Harry, calm down.” Chandra fixes him with a curious look. “He’s probably gone to the loo or something.”
“What happened?”
Harry sees it in slow motion, almost, a true pang of sympathy hitting him for the first time: the way people stop mid-conversation, the way their hurried steps stutter just to stare at Malfoy like he’s a particularly rare zoo animal. If Harry can relate to anything, it’s the utter feeling of disgust that comes with that.
Draco sits back on his knees and looks away. “I’m not,” he mutters. And that’s when Harry notices the faint flush on his cheeks; the way he clutches at his jeans. And oh—
After he drops Malfoy off at the cafeteria, Harry goes straight to the department. He motions for Chandra to follow him into one of the smaller meeting rooms.
. His gaze doesn’t leave the table. “Well, then what if it’s—it’s someone else, or something else? Someone you wouldn’t suspect, normally, like, I don’t know, a centaur, or—” he huffs out a little breath. “I don’t know, you’re the Aurors. I just—maybe you need to think outside the box. Maybe consider that this isn’t like the cases you’ve had before, and so—and so you need to have a different approach too.”
Harry shakes his head. “Not really, no. The official case eval came out this morning, but there was nothing in it we hadn’t already figured out by ourselves. Macnair had been involved in the illegal dragon egg trade since the end of the War. The evaluation concluded that revenge and intimidation were probably behind the public display of the body. Nothing new there.”
, not a mistake made that could help them pick up the invisible thread and start going somewhere.
Narcissa is unfazed. “I have to warn you, Mr Potter—he will not be pleased about your visit, nor will he want to accept your help. But please... do not be deterred by his demeanor. He needs help, and if you don’t give it to him, no one will.”
While the doctor checks for Draco’s vitals and casts a diagnostic spell, Harry gives him a rough breakdown of the events without revealing too much. He breathes a sigh of relief when the doctor confirms Draco was just hit with a Stupefy. He asks Harry if he wants him to arrange a bed for him anyway. Harry shakes his head.
But the feeling that settles over his skin is too nice to think about safely. If he wants to be able to have a say in how his wretched vessel of a body, his stupid brain should react to Malfoy, he has to put his foot down now.
“Draco lives in Muggle London?”
Draco’s leg twitches under his hold; he looks at Harry, gaze fierce. Then he closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and says, “I want to.”
“We weren’t friends.” Harry swallows.
Malfoy never invites him in, so Harry spends an awkward ten minutes talking to Katie outside the house, answering questions about friendships and anecdotes and classes that never happened. He has to make it all up on the spot, and he hopes he is vague enough not to contradict anything Malfoy might have told her during their who knows how long friendship; he’s really not in the mood to deal with the paperwork that comes with obliviating a Muggle right now.
“May I?”
“If you must know, all the taps in the Manor had hot and cold water coming from separate taps. Old as all hell estate and all. Fucking terrible insulation as well.”
He walks toward the bartenders, zeroes in on the bloke pouring a pint of ale from the tap, a head taller than him, high cheekbones and a trimmed beard. Harry leans over the bar and takes out his most polite tone. “Excuse me.”
If that’s the case, is Malfoy pretending to be this way? And if he is... is it because he’s hiding something?
Harry contemplates everything that could have happened to them, everything that still can. All the ways he’s tried to rebel against the turn of the tide. All the blood and sweat and tears he’s poured into damming his river.
Malfoy stares at him; his eyebrows carry a stubborn set of haughtiness still, but his mouth has taken on an embarrassed pout that Harry, to his own amazement, instantly knows to mean Malfoy has realised he’s in the wrong.
Malfoy’s eyes seem to light up a little as he nods.
And that Harry is.
Robards’s office has always made Harry nervous. The two chairs placed opposite the hardwood desk are so uncomfortable that Harry has often found himself wondering if it’s on purpose. If it’s supposed to serve as a constant jab to the summoned Auror’s subconscious, wordlessly whispering something along the lines of
“Firewhiskey,” Harry replies.
“Don’t play daft, Potter. You obviously think I have something to do with these murders. Do you honestly expect me to believe you’re keeping me under surveillance like this just to make sure I’m safe?”
So he does.
is he meant to tell them? Realistically, he knows
He swallows past the lump in his throat, and says, not taking his eyes off Malfoy, “I don’t think you need to be an entirely different person to be good.” Malfoy looks up at him, face hesitant. “You can’t be. You’re you, and... you always will be. It’s not like—well, it’s hard to know how much of us is really us, or what that means even, it’s... building yourself up, when you put it like that, it—sounds exhausting.”
And Harry squeezes the back of Draco's neck and strokes his hair, and thinks,
Draco's mouth takes on one of those devastating, slow grins. “I don’t know,” he says. “But I have other questions, too.”
But as he looks at Malfoy, chin resting on his drawn-up knees, book open at his feet, he knows exactly what is wrong with him.
“I’ll talk to Head Auror Robards, but no promises.”
“Did you sleep well?” Harry croaks, turning back to the stove, busying himself with flipping the crêpe on the pan.
“Yeah,” Malfoy replies, staring at the menu intently like he hasn’t already ordered. The tips of his ears are red.
“The killer targeted their previous victims at their most vulnerable,” he continues. “And—no offense, Malfoy—you’re extremely vulnerable here. You don’t even have any wards up—”
“Well, besides the fact that he’s an elitist little shit living the life of a Muggle, he was very reluctant to come with me yesterday. He insisted he didn’t need the Aurors to protect him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s Friday,” Harry says.
Something about the edge of his tone alarms Harry; it’s desperate, almost. He feels as if this
Despite the undeniably similar nature of the two murders, the cases get assigned separately. When Chandra not-so-gently inquires why, Harry trying his best to soften her edges, Robards simply tells them there are too many factors at play. Both victims could have been wanted dead by dozens, and the murders were committed by a generic Avada; no message, no nothing, and
Draco sucks his bottom lip into his mouth and releases it with a subtle
Harry sighs. “Many.”
Harry freezes in place. That voice—
“It isn’t just him who’s in danger, though,” Chandra argues. “There are plenty of ex-Death Eaters and associates out there who could use our protection. More than we can spare resources for.”
“Psych profile?”
“And—it’s not like that.” Harry laughs. It’s a bitter, throaty sound. “People haven’t magically changed. Corruption hasn’t magically disappeared just because Voldemort is dead. I guess, in a way, after you spend half your life fighting and running for your life, chased by the manifestation of evil itself, you don’t really have time to stop and consider that that’s what he is. A manifestation. But the people who allowed him to be, followed him, created him... they’re here. We’re all here.”
Harry takes a deep breath, swallows past the lump in his throat. “He cast it wordlessly. But I think it was just a Stupefy.”
When he falls asleep for the last time that night, he dreams about a river. It’s fast and swollen wide after heavy rain, washing out mud and rocks from the depths of its bed while Harry watches on.
The question echoes in his head. Draco doesn’t answer for a long beat, just stares ahead, somewhere behind Harry. Slowly, he takes a sip of his wine, and says, “Nothing that hasn’t happened to any ordinary person.” Then, “But, you know,” he gestures at himself, “raised in a pure-blood supremacist family following an unhinged madman, and all.” He makes a face. He looks a bit lost, like he doesn’t know how to go on.
He also can’t help but notice that Malfoy is still wearing Muggle clothes, despite the fact that they are about to enter the wizarding world. Black jeans and a black zip-up hoodie and—Christ, are those
“Hold on,” Chandra says. “I need to take this down for the psych profile.”
He pauses, then, looking at Harry like he wants to ask him something, but then seems to decide against it.
He takes long in the shower, meticulously scrubbing at his skin. And as he comes to his senses, as the events of last night crash into him in waves the more he wakes up under the hot spray of the shower head, the harder he scrubs at himself.
Draco is still looking at the table, but he clears his throat and keeps talking. And Harry thinks, despite the calamity, despite everything that’s going on right now, that he’s so brave. So different. So full of potential. “Well—you’ve interviewed everyone you were suspicious of, right?”
Harry’s heart sinks. “I know,” he says.
Harry sighs. “I have no clue.”
“For you and me.”
“So, for a long time, I didn’t even know what music was, really. Then, when I must have been around ten, my father went away for a few days. Business trip. And my mother, she... you see, she was a strange creature. She never really minded anything, never really cared about any of my father’s eccentricities, she just… accepted them. She never tried to fight him, but I don’t think it was because she was weak. She simply… didn’t care enough to.”
sound at the Hermione residing in his head, because
“What have you figured out so far?” Draco asks quietly.
Then he remembers him sitting on the ottoman in the Ministry bathroom, like something broken and tired, and he feels like he doesn’t know anything.
“No, no, no—that was a good
“Come in.”
“Yeah.” Harry clears his throat. “Katie told me where you worked, but I decided to go home in the end. Didn’t want to bother you on your shift.”
Harry frowns. Why is Malfoy so calm about this?
we’ve considered a bloody dead end?” Chandra asks him on Thursday, pulling at her bangs like she does when she’s frustrated.
, and forgets feeling guilty at once.
Then they’re in Diagon Square. Harry can’t help but remember that the last time he was here, there was a dead body in the fountain. Shit, maybe this was a bad idea—if the killer was after Malfoy, getting him here would be his only chance while he’s staying with Harry. An uneasy feeling overcomes him.
Malfoy stares back. Katie claps her hands together excitedly. “That’s bloody brilliant! William, you never said you had such a close group of friends back in school! When are you leaving?”
Robards looks at Harry with the slight arch of an eyebrow, clearly leaving it up to him to make his case. Typical.
has the courtesy to pretend like Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy walking towards Head Auror Robards’ office to sign papers to live together is not the Event of the Month.
His eyes cut to Harry. “I don’t know how it must look from the outside. What you must think of it. Me being this way.” He swallows, his Adam’s apple bobbing with the movement of it. “But—it’s, what I know is that I don’t—I don’t want to be here.” Then he seems to realise what he’s just said. “Here as in—here, protected by you. I don’t want to be—saved.”
The blush has spread from Malfoy’s ears to the apples of his cheeks now, and Harry can’t stop looking at it. “Five years.”
After the first, Harry pours them another one. And another one. And another one. Neither of them talk. In the utter silence of the night, with not even the telly on as a comforting source of white noise in the background, Harry grows oddly unnerved. The way the whiskey splashes into their glasses, the way he can hear himself swallow, the way the glass thuds dully back onto the coaster as he puts it down—it all suddenly sounds loud and important.
“Why are you even—how’d you even know—”
Then Malfoy finally emerges, a duffel bag slung across his chest—a colour very similar to that of his bathrobe, Harry notes—and Katie hugs him and kisses him on the cheek, says she's going to miss him. Harry can’t help but wonder if they’re just flatmates who are also friends, or something more.
“Ah,” Malfoy says, averting his eyes. “I’m vegetarian, actually.”
“What is it, Harry? What happened?”
“Yeah,” Harry says slowly. “I need to go. And so does William.” Malfoy’s eyes widen again, and he opens his mouth, but Harry is faster. “You see, Katie, the reason I was over the moon when I ran into his mum was actually because all of us who were friends at school are planning a big trip to, erm, Italy. We went there on a school trip once, and it turns out that one of the guys bought the hotel we were in at the time,” he says.
“Oh my God,” Harry groans. “First of all, this is the second time in as many days that you’ve betrayed me—”
“What do you want me to play?”
Eventually, Chandra leaves, and they sit in silence at the table for a while, sipping away at their whiskey.
Mr Diggory scoffs. “You think I’m stupid enough to make the same mistake that let you escape after letting my son die? Don’t be daft, Harry. It was a one-way Portkey.”
“What are you talking about?” Harry’s eyes roam the area around him, looking for the letter that brought them here.
And it’s true, Christ, Harry knows it’s true, he’s always known. It’s always been there, a shapeless thought of sorts, sharpening the edge of his annoyance with Malfoy. Malfoy used to be horrible and cruel, disdainful and disgustingly arrogant. And that amorphous thought that Harry never quite moulded into full sense—the
“An hour tops,” Harry replies.
“Well, I’m strong. Indulge me.”
“Hmm,” Hermione says. “No luck tracking the Portkey that was next to him?”
He feels almost guilty that he gets to see a side of him that he’s evidently uncomfortable showing most of the time. But the shy tilt of Malfoy’s mouth makes him look so lovely, and his eyelashes cast shadows over his cheekbones as he looks down at the table. And Harry thinks,
Harry doesn’t know what to say. So he doesn’t say anything.
Draco sits at the kitchen table; Harry has a better idea.
Harry can feel his wand slide out from his back pocket, helpless. He turns around, just barely able to make out the shadow of a person 15 or 20 yards from them in the dark, just as Draco reaches for his wand—but as soon as he touches it, the same voice shouts a disarming spell at him.
Harry stares. First at Chandra, who looks like she’s trying not to laugh. Then at Robards, whose nose is slightly scrunched up, his eyebrows arched in a perfect, wordless rendition of
“In what way?”
“I assume you are not aware of my son’s… circumstances of present,” she says.
Maintaining a straight face as if this were the most obvious and natural thing in the world, Harry nods. “Seeing as there is a serial killer on the loose, Auror resources are stretched thin. Round-the-clock protection, were you to stay in Muggle London, would cost the Department two Aurors, and Robards won’t hear of that. This is the only possible solution.”
“But… I don’t quite get it,” Draco says, frowning. “It was you he was targeting—then why was it me he tried to kill?”
“Well,” he says, “it’s—I sing in pubs, I’ve never—I don’t know if I can do that.”
And their attention doesn’t pass fast enough not to realise who it is standing there, in the middle of the Ministry Atrium, after a five-year disappearing act: Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater. Son of Lucius Malfoy, one of Voldemort’s most loyal followers up until the very end—well, almost.
He cuts himself off, because he can hear the slight hysteria that creeps into his voice by the end, and he wants to discuss this rationally. He wants to rationally talk Robards and apparently his traitor of a partner out of why this is
“Wanna paint a picture?”
Harry clears his throat. “Right. Let’s go, then.”
Draco’s body drops in front of the shadow figure. Then, without warning, the figure points his wand at Draco, and Draco falls unconscious.
light grey joggers Draco is wearing, and the fact that he’s not wearing a shirt.
They both stare at him. Harry doesn’t know what to say. He hasn’t considered anything like that before. He’s been so wrapped up in thinking about who could have such a strong sense of hatred for anything to do with Death Eaters based on Chandra’s psych eval.
“Of course you didn’t.”
“Nothing,” Malfoy says. His voice is so small and vulnerable, and Harry hasn’t got his defenses at the ready; he doesn’t know how to dodge the saltwater waves of empathy crashing into his chest.
Harry has had enough. He’s well and truly had enough of his stupid heart this evening. He doesn’t know what to say not to make himself look stupid with longing, but also not to hint at him trying to be too casual, so he doesn’t say anything. And that’s worse,
Harry thinks of many possibilities. That someone is polyjuicing themselves to look like Malfoy, and the real Malfoy is chained up in a hole under a trunk. It would explain why he hasn’t been the same since he’s returned from France. Or perhaps he’s under the Imperius curse, a furious Muggleborn playing an elaborate prank on him. Or maybe someone is blackmailing him.
Harry looks at him, amused and a bit charmed. This isn’t really what he was expecting Draco to ask him, but he’ll take it; he rarely acts so open and unguarded, and Harry wishes he were able to let go like this without the alcohol.
, or whatever, if not to let them rip him apart.
But maybe, he thinks, it’s not just that, but also something more rational. A kind of dim understanding that Malfoy has gone through something meaningful that simply can’t be ignored.
“Yep,” Chandra nods.
“Why did Cedric have to die?” Mr Diggory interrupts, clearly angrier by the second. “He was caught in your crossfire. He died because of you. And after all that, after finding out there was a way to save him, you still refused to help. And you still don’t understand, Harry. All this is for you. All of it has been for you. Your misplaced saviour complex—I know it must have been killing you inside that you couldn’t save them. I know it must have been eating you up that you failed to find any clues. But I even left some to see what you’d do with them! How’d you like the Portkeys?”
Harry smiles at him, so content and full of love that he thinks, madly, like he’s never going to feel anything else. Just this. Just Draco.
As Malfoy opens his mouth, a protest at the ready without a doubt, Harry quickly continues. “Of course, the best option would be if you were to move back in with your mother for the time being—”
He feels like he’s at the peak of whatever he’s able to feel, full capacity; and then, in an instant, it’s out the window when Draco, rising up on his knees and leaning slightly towards Harry, says, quiet and breathy, “Do you want to kiss me?”
In any case, Harry needs to return to London and talk to Malfoy; it was a mistake to run away yesterday without talking to him, but he needed to digest what he saw. He’s still unsure how to approach the situation, because Malfoy is obviously not himself, whatever that means.
Malfoy shrugs. “I don’t think most people can put themselves in her shoes. Most people don’t understand her. Merlin’s tits, I don’t understand her, and I’m her son. She doesn’t hate Muggles, you know. She never has.”
There’s a white owl sitting in the open kitchen window, and Harry instantly thinks it’s Robards; that they found another dead body. He walks to the window, takes the parchment and unfolds it. As soon as his eyes scan over the short letter and he grasps what the words mean, he freezes.
“Stop being a drama queen. All she said is that you were somewhat obsessed with him in school, and kept saying the same thing you’re saying now—”
He’s known since sixth year, at least. A most inconvenient time to discover such things, really, what with people dropping around him like flies, and him and Malfoy being at the centre of it all, two opposing forces struggling to push each other out of the ring.
“Have the Muggles made you stop eating pork as well?” Harry grins at him.
Harry hesitates before nodding. He has to admit that’s reasonable.
“What happened?” Harry asks.
Draco grins. “A genuine compliment is due for the observation there. Never took you for someone to recognise wine so quickly.”
Chandra gives him one of her looks. The one where she narrows her eyes so subtly that it took Harry months to pick up on it, then jerks her head slightly to the left. Harry has figured it out to mean she’s not happy with the direction a conversation is going. “What do you suggest we do, then?”
Harry knows what he means: he wasn’t even a Death Eater, never officially; only his father was.
Hermione snorts. “And I’m sure there’s
But it’s a feeble attempt, one that tries halfheartedly to blow at the flickering kindle of Harry’s rational brain to no use. He’s so far gone, so profoundly gone for Draco that everything else is just white noise, so easy and so reasonable to tune out. Infinitesimal.
Much like she attempted—and successfully so—in her letter, she’s doing her best to appeal to Lethe: she lead him through the Manor deliberately fast, chose a deliberately peaceful room to sit in; created an intentional ambience in which it’s not glaringly obvious that this is the place where the man who destroyed nearly everything Harry loved found shelter and assistance for his unspeakable crimes.
It still catches Harry off guard to hear Draco swear so freely. In a good way.
“Yeah,” Harry nods, “And do you know what else I have?” He pulls out a vinyl peeking out from the bottom of the pile and holds it up for Draco to see.
“Makes sense,” Harry nods. “Thank you, sir. I promise I will not be wasting any more of your time. Well, this week,” he grins, standing.
He juts his chin out, looking somewhere behind the space between Harry and Chandra, still scratching at his face absentmindedly. “The only way I’m seeing this happen is if he’s placed under the care of a working Auror. That means he would have to give up whatever he’s doing in the Muggle world for the time being, though. That or nothing.”
“Where are your house elves?” The words tumble out of Harry’s mouth without his permission, but he doesn’t have time to berate himself for them before Narcissa gives him a tiny, crooked smile.
“When I kill him, I want you to know why he had to die. When the light leaves his eyes, I want you to feel exactly the kind of pain I had felt.”
Harry and Draco look at each other. Harry looks away first.
, Harry realises that he’s staring, that his eyes keep moving between Malfoy’s stomach and the goosebumps around his nipples—
But under all that, there is something else Harry knows to be true, calming in the face of this childish calamity, this reluctance, this shame he feels—it’s a sense of sureness. Of inevitability. On some level, without letting the sentiment fully form in his head, he knows that Draco was always going to happen to him.
“I know Nott was your friend,” Harry says. “And I’m sorry about what happened to him. And believe me, I don’t want to be here any more than you want me to be here. But what happened to Nott and all those other people isn’t right, and it wouldn’t be right if it happened to you.”
Harry laughs, stands up and puts the record on the turntable.
, and with the laugh, too, so silly and obvious, Christ—
, and that isn’t even the issue. He just really doesn’t want to deal with their inevitable reactions, or put energy into explaining himself. He has enough on his plate as it is.
“I packed up and left in the middle of the night one day. Went to a Muggle hotel, simply because I didn't know the area well. It was there that it occurred to me first. That I needed to experience the Muggle world. I—don’t exactly know why, even now.” He says, frowning.
For the rest of the day, Malfoy ignores him. Not in a haughty, nose-in-the-air way; he tries very hard to make their lack of interaction seem coincidental. But he’s embarrassed about earlier, Harry can see right through him, even if this side of Malfoy is not known to him. He just can, he always could.
Malfoy looks at him, jaw set at a hard, determined angle that says,
Chandra stops chewing and looks up from her notes. “What?”
“I saw you, you know.”
“Where?” Harry asks, holding his breath.
And then he suddenly realises something. “You’re coming to Diagon in Muggle clothes,” he says.
They eat in silence for a while. Harry’s head is overloaded with the case, and he doesn’t feel like he has enough energy to feel uncomfortable right now, or to strike up meaningless conversation.
“Wait!” Narcissa’s shout—scream, really—makes Harry’s hand freeze on the copper handle, not because it scares him with its suddenness, but because it’s the first time Narcissa has been honest with him today, desperately real instead of deliberately aloof.
He’d have never even thought that scars and wounds as ugly as they have given each other could heal over enough that you could ever touch that area again with the hopes of not hurting it. But here they were; and just how strong was Harry meant to be, here?
Something ugly and terrible is unfolding from behind his navel, spreading to his stomach and his intestines, and he fears that if he were to open his mouth again, bile would come out.
“Another body?” he asks instead of a greeting.
different from the Draco he had known at school, the boy who would have sneered at the very idea of wearing Muggle clothes, of such blatant immodesty.
Chandra nods at him. “I get it, Harry, don’t worry about it.”
“You don’t know him,” Harry interrupts.
“What do you mean by that?” Harry asks, gentle. He doesn’t want to interrupt Malfoy, doesn’t know if it’s helping at all, but he tries.
refuses to hand it over as a package of facts that belong together.
“In—in what way?”
Harry doesn’t even realise he’s breathed out a quiet
“Yeah,” Chandra interrupts. It’s no accident they’ve been partners for three years; they understand each other all too well, how the other works, what their gestures and habits mean all the way down to their nervous tics. “They’re too similar and too close in time to be a coincidence. Two bodies of would-be Death Eaters within a week. Both put on public display for all to see, with a Portkey next to them. Macnair wasn’t a mob kill.”
“I know you don’t want me here,” Malfoy says into the stretching silence, like he’s read Harry’s thoughts. His voice slices sharply across the strange, quiet atmosphere. “I know you’re uncomfortable with it, and I—I don’t blame you.” He casts his eyes down, pressing his lips together. “After all I did to you, to your friends, and just, just me being part of all that utter shite—”
