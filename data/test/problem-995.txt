“And what about for you?” Harry asked, feeling cautiously optimistic at the thought that Draco cared about their future enough to ask, and more than a little happy that he hadn’t ruined everything the previous day. “Will it bother you if I use magic around you?”
Harry snorted. “It’s a kids’ toy—you’re supposed to ask a question, and it’ll give you an answer. It’s just a toy, not really magic.”
Once he’s started to settle, no longer crying out pleas for Draco to stop and pulling against his restraints in vain, Harry feels Draco switch hands and fleetingly wonders if he’s getting tired. Draco continues to work him for another minute, until Harry’s gone soft, no longer whimpering. Then Draco stops.
“Someone put some sort of magical bomb in my house,” Harry said. “I opened the door and it went off.” He felt his hands start to tremble as he remembered flying through the air, the noise, the panic. He clasped his hands around his knees, holding them tight and trying to will his body to relax.
Harry turned to leave but before he made it a single step, Draco was in front of him, coming through the open doors.
Draco finished fixing up his tea and sat on the other end of the sofa from Harry, tucking a leg under himself, looking right at home.
They’d spent the morning divvying up the list of people that needed to be interviewed, putting the least likely candidates on the lists that would be going to Junior Aurors. While they were happy for the help, Harry and Mel would only be giving themselves more work in the long run if one of the probies missed something and they accidentally crossed off the wrong suspect.
“Oh,” Percy continued “Well, you should. I heard there’s a new wizarding dating app. You should try it out. I heard from the Director of the Department of International Magical Cooperation that his daughter used it and found her husband within a month.”
“Good,” she replied. “Bentley has been messing around, but that only means he’ll be less competition on Friday.”
Knowing Draco enjoyed the burn, Harry didn’t bother to loosen him further. He cast a wandless lubrication spell on each of them and then shuffled forward on his knees, not bothering to even pull his jeans down or off.
Harry landed on the pavement. The heavy wooden door landed fully on top of him, having been ripped off its hinges from the blast.
The pub came into view, sporting a large pride flag hung vertically in the window next to several band posters. Harry’s pulse jumped.
“Hi, sorry to drop in,” Draco said, shuffling nervously. “Can I come in? It’s bloody cold out here.”
“We need a list of all of his contacts and acquaintances,” Mel said, looking up at Harry, pulling him out of his thoughts.
Harry didn’t really have a good answer, his mind spinning through all the hundreds of scenarios he’d played out in his head over the years. He realised, at that moment, that he’d never actually allowed himself to imagine them being completely supportive, and he felt like an idiot. He’d spent so many years building the whole moment and situation into something huge. He wasn’t so naive as to think it would be this smooth sailing if he were to come out publicly. He was certain the scenarios he had imagined with the
Harry was starting to wonder if he should just give up the whole teaching thing—finish out the year and find a new profession. What profession, he didn’t know. The Aurors had brought up too many of his issues from the war, and he’d quit during training. Both charity work and Quidditch required engaging with the press, something that had quickly proved impossible for him. He wondered if he should just become a hermit; was that a possible career path? He could just hole up in Grimmauld and yell at the press when he went out in public. Might as well lean into the crazy rumours, right?
Just as he was about to sit down, there was a knock at his door, and then he heard it creak open. Harry made his way to the entryway of the sitting room to find Draco hanging up his coat and hat, before straightening out the cardigan he was wearing over a dark purple t-shirt. He leant toward the entry mirror and shook out his hair before starting to arrange it back into place.
He cast a quick Silencing Charm at the heavy metal door and pushed his way in. The space was one large room, dimly lit except for the far corner, where he could see people milling around. There was a large table where several people appeared to be working.
Harry apparated to an alley a couple of streets from the pub and tossed the strap of the satchel over his head so that it crossed his chest, leisurely making his way to the old building. Londoners bustled by, no doubt on their way back to the office from lunch. Harry rarely went out for lunch, usually taking it at his desk so that he could keep working. He wondered if the trainer position would be more relaxed, if he’d have time to grab lunch with Ginny more often. The trainers never seemed particularly stressed out, in Harry’s recollection.
“—I started thinking about wizarding pubs. So I checked out the other competition, and frankly, the pub scene in wizarding Britain leaves a lot to be desired. So I thought, well, I could bring what I know about trendy Muggle pubs into wizarding London.”
Harry’s partner, Mel Shaw, knelt beside him on the ornate rug, adjusting her Auror robes while she pulled out a pad of parchment.
“Good, Professor!” Jacob said. His knee had fully healed, and Harry had noticed his form was surprisingly good for a first-year student.
Harry heard someone snort just behind them and saw Malfoy smirking. Harry didn’t bother to hide his glare this time.
Harry smiled. “No, but I’ve had some experience with being left things I didn’t necessarily want to inherit.”
A petite woman with short brown hair sat across the table from them. She didn’t look like she could hurt a fly, but Harry’d seen more than a few criminals that looked like upstanding members of society but did horrible things in life. Next to her sat Abe Montgomery, one of Harry’s least favourite lawyers. He tended to pick up the cases of the more terrible criminals that were arrested. More terrible and far richer, that was. Isabelle George must have some family money to have afforded him.
Once his bollocks are tickling Harry’s nose, Draco holds him still for a moment. Harry fights the initial panic from the inability to breathe; he knows Draco won’t push him too far. But even in his exhausted state, his body reacts, adrenaline starts to course through him, his heart starts racing.
The small plant with little innocent starbursts of white flowers expelled out another puff of smoke at the two men.
“Thanks. Appreciate the confidence you have in me.” He plopped down next to her on the swing, his arm pressed against hers.
He nodded and then gestured for her to hold on with a raised finger. He cast a series of strong silencing spells and protective wards on the room, pushing out as much power as he could even as his body ached in protest. His head got increasingly fuzzy from the effort, but he pushed through.
Harry’s chest was heaving by the time it was over, but he forced himself to keep position, stretched out against Draco’s chest, arms high and back behind Draco’s neck, legs stretched wide, hooked over Draco’s knees. His entire world narrowed to his throbbing bollocks.
“Well, then I think you are on your own,” Harry said, trying to keep himself from looking too entertained by the whole ordeal.
Draco pulled his arm away, Harry’s heart clenching at the loss, and stretched overhead with a yawn. Harry scrubbed his face, carefully turning over in the tight space, and then looked cautiously at Draco.
Harry squeezes his eyes shut, tears gathering in the corners as his body keeps trying to thrust. It’s been so long that they’ve done it like this, having settled for quick fucks since the kids were babies. For years, they’ve seemed to stay in a constant exhaustion from parenting. Harry forgot how intense it is, how his body becomes bowstring tight, how every nerve ending is on high alert. Draco continues the slow drag in and out, the angle driving Harry mad.
“I recommend we use real lube, though,” Draco said with a smile, as he pulled Harry down and repositioned him on the bed.
motions that Draco keeps making. Eventually, a second finger is added, and Harry cries out in relief. His hips stutter, trying to move against Draco’s weight which is still pressed up against him.
“They paid him and then paid him some more to keep quiet about the money. But since it wasn’t the first time I’d had an issue that had needed to be settled with the press, they decided I was too much of a liability.”
Draco stopped pacing and looked at him. “This is because of a case, though, right? Are they going to take you off of it?”
Ginny finished off her pint and wiped her mouth on a napkin. “So what else have you been up to? Other than almost dying a few times.”
She looked up and blinked, and he could see the moment where she recognised him. And while he hated doing it, he had hoped for exactly that—hoping that she’d let him see the files without a warrant or a message from any of her higher-ups.
“He’s been known to be seen around the Ministry with Malfoy,” replied Mel. “Which by itself doesn’t mean anything. But the Junior Aurors who interviewed him said he was acting ‘squirrely’ and sweating a lot. He could just be a nervous guy, but it’s worth checking out.”
“For fuck’s sake.” Malfoy let out a low whistle. “What a piece of shit. So the league just canned you?”
Harry leaned in and licked up his neck, still continuing with the light touches, never enough to be satisfying until Draco let out a positively ruined whimper.
“We’ve got a likely cause of death for the Malfoy murder then,” Harry said, and Mel hummed in agreement. They’d need to let Auror Hardy know that her thoroughness researching possible causes of death had been a job well done. They’d just had too many missing puzzle pieces at the time to know it.
His body, which had tensed, ready to fight, slowly deflated. He felt like he should be happier to see the man but instead he was overwhelmed by the adrenaline that had so quickly flooded his veins. It was too many times in one day, and he was exhausted.
The witch cast something strong, sending Bradbourn off balance before she began turning towards Harry. Dark magic swirled out of the tip of her wand and curled towards him. He put up a shield just before it could hit and moved in front of Bradbourn, who was clearly injured but trying to pick himself back up.
“Is it weird—” Ron started to say, before pausing to send off another offensive spell. “—that I miss this?”
Harry entered the lift after it dinged and announced its arrival and then leant up against the back wall. The fatigue was catching up with him quickly. He allowed his eyes to rest as the lift barrelled up to the second floor. He’d thought that most of the fatigue had been due to the potion treatment that had finished its course the day prior, but the spell and physical damage was still clearly taking their toll. Only now, he also had the mental clarity to be frustrated by it all, ready to go back to work and more than ready to find whoever was responsible for this.
“Oh, there’s more than a few…” Draco replied. “So, how have you been? How’s the case? I know you can’t go into the details, but I also assume it’s still open since I haven’t heard otherwise.”
Harry smiled, relishing in Draco being the frustrated one, before pushing in slow enough for Draco to adjust with the minimal prep. They both groaned in unison as Harry bottomed out. He waited a long moment for Draco to finish adjusting until a quick nod of his let Harry know he was ready.
Harry felt his eyes widen in shock and then let out a surprised laugh. “Wow. You just went right for it.”
He felt a tear spill over and quickly went to wipe it with his sleeve, clearing his throat. “No, it’s fine.”
As saliva starts to pool in his mouth, Harry has to work at not sucking it back to swallow; he lets a strand slowly drip out of the corner of his mouth. It never fails to surprise him how such a simple thing can make him feel so debauched—so used and dirty in all the best ways.
“Agreed,” Ron said, pressing his lips together. “Let’s see what else she knows, but we might finally have a lead. If they are somehow involved in the potions ring, we’ll need to combine teams on this, start comparing notes.”
Draco scraped his teeth across the hard nub, and Harry cried out, his hips thrusting automatically. His cock was hard in his pyjama bottoms where it pressed up against Draco’s stomach.
Harry could see Mel fighting back a laugh at the ridiculous expressions on the two men’s faces, but he was starting to lose his patience. After a long moment of silence, Harry said, “You aren’t in any kind of trouble. And we honestly do not care what you are smoking in here, we just need to ask some questions.” The men both exhaled simultaneously.
“Gave my notice this morning. Well, actually,” Harry said as he thought through the conversation, “I just kind of quit. I didn’t really give an end date.”
Draco nipped at his inner thigh. “Sensitive, isn’t it?” Draco leant back down and Harry felt his tongue, firmer this time, trace his rim. Harry threw his head back, body wound tight.
There was no way for this to not be awkward. It wasn’t like they hadn’t seen each other naked before, and touched quite a bit, even. But it was complicated and messy. A drunken night here, a lonely night there. Nothing that they ever talked about maturely in the light of day.
She smiled at the praise and then turned and got back to work. With the situation in good hands, Harry turned to find Mel and head back to the Ministry.
Harry wasn’t sure what he’d see there—regret, confirmation of his fears—but when Draco finished his loud yawn and met Harry’s eyes, it was only warmth and a smile, his grey eyes crinkling at the corners.
“What did we have to throw out when we were cleaning out my cellar a couple years ago?” Harry asked.
“So, you’re just going to leave in the middle of a lesson?” Harry asked. That couldn’t be a good idea with potions students.
“I thought I didn’t want any of it and that I’d eventually sell it or get rid of it all. And while I would to this day trade all of it back for more time with him, with my parents, I can’t, you know? It doesn’t actually change anything. So, all I can do is live with it, and do with it what I think would have made them happy. So I fixed up the house into something I think he would have liked, or at least not hated, and into a home for me, which he would have wanted to see; that way I feel like I’m still honouring his memory the best I can.”
“Okay, so,” Mel said, picking up a paper and staring at the symbol. “There were different spells that activated the different runes, but they all worked similarly. It was contextual, but also people would use the meaning of the rune as the way to unlock it—that way you didn’t have to know some exact spell.”
Harry sat, returning a commiserating smile. It was likely going to take the whole department a month to catch up on the amount of paperwork a case like this generated. Normally, he would have cringed at the thought and immediately started looking for active cases to work on, but, at the moment, he couldn’t muster up the energy to care.
“I haven’t been teaching as long as Binns.” Malfoy cocked a smile. “But I have a few years under my belt.”
“Shit.” Harry hadn’t even thought to check up on him, so caught up in his own issues for the past couple days.
“Yep,” Harry replied with a laugh. “Well, maybe. Ron offered me a different one that I’m seriously considering.”
He pulled back, but left his hands in place, as he added, “I’d love to go to dinner with you, Draco.”
What should have been just one night, both of them getting each other out of their systems, inexplicably turned into breakfast, and then dinner, and then regular dates. Draco didn’t even have a clear recollection of agreeing to date Harry. One night he was having the fuck of his life and two months later, he was spending his evenings at Grimmauld Place, talking about the latest budget report over dinner.
The conversation came freely, and Harry found himself once again surprised by this older Draco Malfoy—this time by how much he enjoyed his company.
Draco huffs a laugh but starts unbuttoning his shirt hastily. After Harry finishes undressing, he rummages through the discarded clothing for his wand and then casts locking, silencing, prepping and lubing charms in succession.
Harry begs and pleads as Draco continues to work his cock back up to full hardness. He’s soon babbling for him to stop again, his nerve endings shot as pain and arousal thrum through his veins.
Harry pushed open the door as a bell dinged overhead. The bright fluorescent lights made him blink. Everything felt a bit surreal—that feeling of being somewhere mundane when everything in life is exactly the opposite. Harry felt as if the world around him should be in chaos too, what with everything that had happened to him. He went up to the case of pay-as-you-go phones, and grabbed the same make and model as his own so that the magical case would fit. The last thing Harry needed was the new phone getting fried with errant magic within minutes.
Harry got up, stretching his muscles, which were stiff from sitting all morning, and walked behind her desk looking at the parchment she was focused on.
Harry groans and drops his head back down. It’s one of their softer ones, more of a solid thud than a sting, but given his current state, he has no idea how intense it will be.
He froze as he looked to the back of the large cage. Where he’d expected to see another large magical creature, sat a dozen people huddled in the far corner. Several of the adults kept their arms wrapped tightly around children who had looks of terror on their faces.
James is outside playing, hunting for rocks. The twins are doing an art project that Harry has no doubt will require cleaning the entire kitchen by the time they are done, but it’s keeping them occupied, and really, that’s all he can ask for. Ten minutes, that’s all he needs. Draco’s leaving the bedroom just as Harry reaches the top of the stairs to come find him.
Harry flicked his wand to bring his still hovering broom back to him, before flying up to Noah. “Okay, try it again,” Harry said.
Draco reached out a hand and pulled Harry onto the bed, his expression softening. “Sorry I was pissy.”
Harry blinked, his mind clearing at the news. It was the obvious choice, but Harry had completely forgotten about the position now being available. “Ron, that’s fantastic!”
“Absolutely not. I’m fine. Stop, wait—” Harry put his hand up as Ron opened his mouth to interject. “I know I’m still injured from earlier this week, and I have depleted my magic from all this,” Harry said, waving his hand at the door. “But all I need is rest. I was done with the potions from the Healer.” Technically, he still had one to take but Ron didn’t need to know that. He’d been on that particular potion enough to know it wouldn’t be a problem if he didn’t finish out the course.
The rest of the team looked like it had been pulled from other departments. Harry realised Ron must have gone with whoever he felt he could trust; Clara White from Spell Containment and a couple of Magical Law Enforcement Officers. As he saw Scott Knight, the Ministry worker from the Potions lab, he wondered how many of them had ever been in a fight, let alone a raid.
“What?” Harry put his glasses back on. “We knew this operation had been going on for some time from the letters, but he was involved this whole time?”
“Mate, I need to call this in. We need to get you to Mungo’s.” Ron stood up and started casting spells around the area, which Harry immediately recognised as spells that would keep wix and Muggles alike out of the newly active crime scene.
“Granted, that also can lead to far more disasters. I have a first-year that is giving Seamus Finnigan a run for his money with cauldron explosions this year.”
When this one was pulled tight, he moaned from the pressure of the two ropes along his sensitive hole.
“Okay, erm— thanks. I’ll keep an eye out for that,” Harry replied, as Neville snorted quietly beside him.
“Well after many trips to the infirmary, levitating the unconscious students, and, later that evening, drinking half a bottle of firewhiskey while questioning every life choice that had led to that moment, I implemented new safety protocols in my classes.”
Harry added a few logs to the fireplace and lit them with his wand, the fire roaring to life immediately. He then waved his wand to put out the lights in the room, leaving only the glow from the hearth and the fairy lights from the Christmas tree in the corner of the room. They’d have to remember to get Teddy’s presents out once he fell asleep
Sybill leaned toward him, voice low. “I have seen the Signs. You will be betrayed before the next full moon.”
“I know, Harry. Just do whatever you guys can do. And any resources you need on this, I’ll try to get you. We’ve got our hands full with this potions case and the Neo-Death Eater cult up in Scotland, but if putting some extra resources on this will get it off our plate, then we can focus on the more important cases anyway. Even Quarrington has asked us to speed things up.”
When Harry got to the staff room, he was relieved to find it empty. He just needed a few minutes to decompress before dealing with his colleagues.
Now, there was yet another way he was different. And as much as he hated to give credence to anything the Dursley’s had ever said or thought, he couldn’t help remembering what they said about people like him. Dudley’s taunts about Cedric, the Muggle boys in the neighbourhood and their homophobic slurs, the choice words his aunt and uncle had for “poofs.”
When Harry got to Draco’s belt, Draco started to stand and then hesitated as if he was trying to decide something. Harry raised an eyebrow in question, wondering if he managed to pull off Draco’s signature expression.
“They have their own houses and lives too, Teddy,” Andromeda said, before turning to Harry and Draco. “Thank you both so much for watching Teddy this week. I don’t know what I would do without you two.”
Harry huffed, blowing a strand of blond hair out of his eye as he hunched over the workplace accident report and painstakingly recorded every detail of their morning.
Draco chuckled, his voice reverberating against Harry’s body, as he slid to the side, the bed dipping as he settled next to Harry before continuing to tease his nipples. Soon non-stop sounds were spilling out of Harry—sounds he barely recognised as coming from himself. Harry’s cock tented his pyjama bottoms, searching for touch, friction, but finding only the maddening light touch of the thin, loose fabric.
Harry pretended to pay attention, nodding and humming his agreement every so often, grateful when George had finally had enough and interrupted Percy’s stream-of-consciousness rant about the Accounting Department to change the topic to his new Wheezes products.
“We’ll be sure to explore that more later, then.” Draco chuckled softly, trailing kisses away again and pulling Harry’s leg off his shoulder before running his hands up and down his thighs. Harry was too worked up to even be concerned about what was coming next, reduced to a babbling mess. He could hear his voice and the words coming out, but nothing made any sense.
Harry nodded, feeling a bit overwhelmed to hear his feelings mirrored in Malfoy’s sentiments. It had felt completely out of control at the time, but all the other players and the coach just kept telling him it came with the territory. Harry didn’t remember any of the other players being unable to walk through Diagon Alley, however, or having to spend every waking minute in a polyjuice disguise when they weren’t home. Or being afraid for their friends and family members as private addresses were leaked to the public.
“So the story goes,” Mel replied with a smile. “The idea caught on, and queer wix started coding their letters and locking them with a rune. Nauthiz was the most commonly used—like most runes, it can have several meanings but for the queer wix that used it, it meant ‘resistance out of necessity.’ It was a closely guarded secret in the queer community for many years, and became how many could safely communicate amongst themselves. You’ll still see the Nauthiz rune sometimes on the door of wix places, signalling that it’s a safe space.”
Harry looked up, locking eyes with Draco. He’d looked into those eyes what felt like a million times, years of taunting and bullying glares that had turned into hesitant glances which had, in turn, become looks of commiseration during meetings and creases in the corner of his eyelids during a joke. Now they were soft and hard, intense while still caring. And Harry got lost in them. His breath caught, their hands working furiously as they both approached orgasm.
“Yes, yes, you’re ‘just friends,’ and it’s ‘not like that.’ I heard you at lunch,” she replied as she lightly shoved him back toward the changing room. “You’re still getting the jeans.” Her eyes gleamed as she broke out in a big grin. “Keep these on and try on the shirts.”
Harry yelps as a white-hot sensation burns a line down his thigh. He looks up to see a soft red glow coming out of the tip of Draco’s wand. Oh god. They’ve used this spell before. It’s always intense, but never as much as today, the potion continuing to amplify every single sensation.
Harry’s phone buzzed, and Ginny gestured that she was off to the loo. He unlocked it to see a text from Draco.
Harry smiled and leaned over to press a small kiss on Draco’s lips, before running a finger along the edges of the ropework, light touches, maddeningly slow.
Hermione opened her mouth and then shut it quickly, pressing her lips together. The pity was evident in her eyes even still.
He went to the next filing cabinet on his list, and then the next, and the next. In each instance, he got the same result. There were no requests in any of the files. Every alarm bell in Harry’s head was going off as he continued through the notes for any that had dates at all and duplicated parchments that were anywhere near the month in question. There was nothing.
She huffed a laugh and rolled her eyes. “Tell me about it. I got stuck with two Saturdays this month,” she said. “Just make sure you leave everything where you found it, or I’ll never hear the end of it from Crane.”
Draco flipped another card. Seven of Clubs. Harry tried to think of the cards that had been revealed so far, tried to think if there had been more lower cards flipped or higher. But his brain was too muddled.
Fortunately, Draco decides to be merciful and hooks his fingers in the lace, pulling it down just enough to free Harry’s cock and then wraps his hand around Harry’s length. Harry is nearly shaking from the strain of forcing himself to stay still as Draco slowly works his cock, but he can’t stop the sigh that escapes his lips at a particularly firm tug.
Harry knew well enough at this point in his life that there were no guarantees— that he would make it out alive, that Mel, Ron or his other Auror colleagues, which he considered family more than friends, would all survive. Harry clenched his fists to stop the slight trembling, feeling some adrenaline kicking in already, and set his jaw.
Harry reached in, rifling around through the contents until his hand closed around the small vile. He pulled it out, uncorking it and putting it to his lips, before downing the sour fluid. He let his head fall back as it did its work. It would only give him a few hours before he would need to rest.
Harry cleared his throat and turned on the taps, trying to keep his focus on washing his hands and not the sinking realization that Draco never looked like that around Harry. He was always guarded, always closed off. Harry never knew what he wanted, whether they were friends at this point or Draco merely tolerated him. Harry wondered if that’s what Draco saw when he looked at him—someone who wore his feelings on his sleeve… or on his face, as it were. He reminded himself it didn’t matter. They worked well together; Harry even enjoyed his company most of the time. Even if he was an emotionally unavailable enigma.
Draco stood frozen for a moment and Harry worried he’d gone too far—this friendship of sorts still so new.
Once the ropes settle, Harry pulled as tightly as possible without hurting him, Draco walks around him, ducking under the ropes where necessary. He runs a hand down Harry’s side, and Harry’s entire body lights up from the touch. He jerks to the side before he can stop himself, his body already trying to get away from the sensation. The potion is starting to do its work, and Harry can feel a subtle tingling spreading along his skin.
Harry made a clean dive toward the ground and then banked to the left, his toes nearly skimming the grass, before coming to a stop in front of his class.
“I’m assuming you eat them. Is there another use that I’m too plebeian to understand?” Harry asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
“I’ve got it, just stop,” Harry whispered back, elbowing Malfoy as he tried to adjust Harry’s levitation spell again. “Just hold the shield over it.”
“My whereabouts? Are you kidding me?” Malfoy asked in a harsh whisper, eyes narrowed as they flicked back and forth between the two Aurors. “I haven’t set foot in the wizarding world in
“If you’re wrong, you’ll get something else,” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear. Harry could hear the smile in his voice, and his cock twitched again even though he knew whatever Draco had planned was likely to not be as fun as the strokes.
His old phone powered down after the press of a button, and then he zapped it with a charging spell from his wand. As usual, his spell work overpowered the device, smoke curling out of it, rendering it useless. He then tossed it in the bin and then ducked into a nearby alley, before making another jump to a more touristy area where he might find a hotel.
“Please… fuck—” Harry tries to rock into him, but Draco presses his body down, locking him into position.
“Right,” Harry replied, wondering not for the first time that morning how they could possibly pull this off. He had to give Scott credit, though—he didn’t look nearly as nervous as some of the other members of the team.
more comfortable?” Harry asked, nervousness rearing its head through the fatigue. He started to sit up, his body protesting. “I can stay on the sofa. I should have asked—”
Draco plopped back down, irritation growing but not enough to actually do anything about it yet. He loved staying in bed for far too long on the weekends. But that was in part because he liked staying in bed with Harry… his husband… who had better not have forgotten about Draco’s birthday again. The last time had been years ago and when they’d just first started dating, but still.
“Sex, now.” Harry pulls his own shirt off, tossing it on the floor, and immediately starts in on his belt. There’s no time for romance; Harry just needs to be fucked—the sooner the better.
Harry glanced at his watch; it was already after noon. A part of him wanted to keep going, just cancel his plans for the day and evening so that he could keep digging. He was getting that buzz that he got from a good case, one that gave him just enough leads to make him a little obsessive. He tried to push down the feeling that some of his desire to keep going might be so that he could avoid something he had spent the better part of his adult life avoiding.
After another minute of teasing Harry with the flogger, Draco sends it back to the table. He then runs a finger along Harry’s cock before wrapping his forefinger and thumb around the tip, stroking in small motions—only enough to tease. Harry’s hips thrust involuntarily.
At the time, Harry had thought he was just embarrassed with the flirting. He’d never been comfortable with overt sexuality even in his established relationship, so someone he barely knew clearly throwing that type of attention his way was far too much. He felt his face heat at every glance, his skin tingling with growing embarrassment. Harry tried to focus, not let his eyes linger too long on the smooth skin of his back or the broadness of his shoulders that was now so apparent.
The lift dinged, announcing Magical Law Enforcement; Harry straightened up and made his way to his office. The floor was thankfully empty. When he reached his office door, he tapped his wand on the knob to unlock it. The locking spell probably hadn’t done much good from what Ron had told him, which made him uneasy. The idea someone had possibly been in his office rifling through his things set his teeth on edge.
“Should we maybe wait until we sober up?” Draco asks, a little concerned about accidentally hurting Harry at this point. “Take a nap? Try to sleep it off?”
Once afternoon classes were done for the day, he made his way to the staff room to meet up with Malfoy.
He finally settled on a teal t-shirt that Ginny had once told him looked good against his olive complexion and his least ill-fitting jeans. Giving himself a once over in the mirror, he resolved to let Ginny take him shopping. She’d be thrilled. He told himself it wasn’t that he
“Well, sorry to say, that’s really all I do. Dinner at the Weasleys on Saturdays, hanging out with your ‘exceptional’ self on Wednesdays.”
“I don’t think my mother’s been involved in anything recently, but I don't want her getting dragged into this. If something—if there was evidence that showed… I know I’m not the best son, and I haven’t even spoken to her in well over a decade, but I’d rather not be the reason she was dragged off to Azkaban.”
Harry walked over to the table against the wall, dropping the chastity cage on it, before heading back to Draco. “You look surprised, pet.”
They’d spent their first year miserable, floundering at teaching and baiting one another at every opportunity. After failing to get through to them both together and separately, Minerva finally locked them in her office with the instruction to “work their shit out.” That, of course, led to yelling and even a few punches thrown.
Harry made his way to the staff room, feeling far less worried than he had at the end of the previous day. His Tuesday classes had gone significantly better. For one, the elective classes had fewer students, but more importantly, they already knew basic broom safety. With his fourth and sixth year students that day, he’d been able to get into a groove by setting them on a task and then go around and work with the ones who needed help.
“Ah—well…” Draco opened his eyes as they crinkled in a smile. “I got really into yoga for a few years.”
There was a long pause, and Harry rubbed his face and then adjusted his glasses before leaning back to look at his friends.
He scanned the room. Scott was fighting back two wix with flourish. The man might have spent his days analysing potions, but Harry had to admit: he could duel.
The minutes crept by quietly, both engrossed in their reading, which was more often dull than not. Short of a few letters of interest and a few more humorous ones given some of the ridiculous things Lucius Malfoy deemed letter writing worthy, most of the reading was horribly boring. It seemed the man had pulled out a quill and parchment if anything even remotely inconvenienced him.
Most of the others seemed to be holding their own as well, and Harry finally found Bradbourn duelling a younger witch along the far south wall. It looked like he’d lost ground, and he had been pushed back mid-fight.
“Yes, sir.” And he was. He really had expected that Harry would let him out and the fun would start immediately—especially after all the teasing he’d endured all week. He wondered how long Harry was going to toy with him, if he’d have to wait until the end of the night. He wondered how many times Harry might fuck him first. None of these thoughts was helping the throbbing arousal settle.
“Right.” Harry took a seat in the chair opposite the fireplace, feeling a bit self-conscious at their placement. While they’d have a clear view of anyone entering or exiting the staff room, they looked a bit like they were holding court, facing out to the room. “So which do you do?”
Once Harry’s arms wrapped around him, Draco let the tears fall freely, shaking against Harry. He vaguely knew that Harry was worried, but he didn't have the ability to put his thoughts into words just yet. Even some of the more intense impact play they occasionally engaged in had never affected Draco this strongly.
“Well, suffice it to say, there are a lot of regulations around them now. Which is great, really,” Harry added. “I’d be happy to pay a reasonable salary, but it’s been a bit of a mess with older house-elves refusing pay, and I don’t know—from what Hermione’s explained, there’s just generations of damage to be undone that led to that practise in the first place —it just seemed better to stay out of it for now.”
Once they were at the building, Harry and Mel carefully walked around the building, keeping close to the exterior walls with their wands at the ready. Signals were difficult while disillusioned, so they relied on a Cogitatio Spell to share their thoughts. Unlike Legilimency, they could easily control which thoughts to send the other person, and it required casting from both parties to form the temporary mental link. It was a tricky spell to learn, but standard Auror training.
Harry feels a hand wrapped around the base of his sensitive bollocks, pulling them down. A dull pain sears through them, and he gasps.
And thank you, readers, for sticking with this to the end. This fic was very much a labor of love for me, and I hope you enjoyed it ❤️.
Harry focused on the menu, not wanting to relive some of their worst shared moments while he was trying to sit here and make polite conversation with this grown-up version of Malfoy. The whole thing was just surreal.
“The unfurling?” Harry asked. This one he could understand deeply. Harry knew he wasn’t anywhere near a place of self acceptance himself yet, but he hoped that he was at least starting that journey.
After a moment of incredulity, Draco finally sighs. He knows Harry’s been tired lately. So, Draco climbs off the bed, careful not to rouse him and grabs an afghan from their side chair. He covers him up and drops a soft kiss on his messy hair. Draco has no idea if Harry just needs a nap or if he’s tired enough to sleep straight through the night. There’s always the morning, he supposes.
Harry continues to babble incoherent complaints as Draco works him over, trailing the feather up his sides, dipping into his armpits, along his extended neck. He then moves to Harry’s back, dragging it along his shoulder blades, his spine, and then lower.
Harry pressed another small kiss in the centre of the compass before moving down the rest of his back. There were some swirls and other nonspecific designs, and Harry traced those as well, goose pimples breaking out on Draco’s skin. But Harry was looking for the ones with a story, so he moved past those and down his back to a small symbol above his arse cheek.
“No,” Harry pleads with a rough voice, turning his head to the side. He can’t watch anymore, his body is too exhausted, too overstimulated as Draco continues to lick and suck.
He let out a cry that he was glad no one was around to hear and tightened his grasp around his wand, before casting a shaky Levitation Charm on the door. He managed to lift it only a couple of inches off of his chest, but it was enough. He slid out and dropped the door, which landed with a thud.
Harry pressed his lips together, but the corners tugged up anyways. He was really going to miss working with her. “Deal, Assistant Head Auror Shaw.”
Eventually, Kevin saw the Snitch and caught it while Harry was still focused on how the muscles in the man’s back rippled when he changed directions.
“Not anymore. Not much of a point really, but I did for the first few years. I just didn’t feel safe without it. Particularly with the leftover war trauma and then being hexed whenever I showed my face in Diagon Alley for a few years after that.” He grimaced. “But then over time, I realised that no one was coming for me, and I couldn’t use it anyway. A few times I just accidentally left it at my flat, and then I stopped carrying it for the most part. It got easier the more I got used to doing things the Muggle way as well.”
There was only one way to find out, so with a quick goodbye to Mel, insisting once again that he was fine, Harry headed back to the safe house to grab his phone.
Harry’s lips pulled back in a tight grimace of a smile, already seriously considering killing the man after only a few days of sharing the castle as him. Harry had come to Hogwarts determined to be a professional. Minerva had gone on about how much Malfoy had changed, how valuable of a staff member he was, and how he even went as a chaperone on Muggle Studies trips each year. But from what Harry had seen so far, Malfoy was the same as ever.
“Let’s see it then,” Perry shot back from where he was still laying on the mat. “You and Shaw against me and Higgins.
Ron took a long look at the two of them, and Harry could see the guilt written on his face. He knew that his friend took his position as the Assistant Head very seriously and considered it his responsibility to make sure they were all safe—an impossible task for Aurors even at the best of times, but that didn’t stop Ron from trying.
“I haven’t decided,” Draco whispers in Harry’s ear. “If I want to make you come so many times today that you beg me to stop—”
“You and me…” Harry looked back at the mirror, and then with a jolt it hit him. He spun to face Draco. “Wait,
“You’d grab the soap, suds yourself up. You’d start with the safe areas, of course—arms, chest, but then you’d need to wash everywhere right, Harry? Your hands would start to wander lower—”
Harry let her think. He’d been rolling it over in his head all morning. Everything still felt so disconnected. Even though they could connect things through Lucius now, there were too many things they couldn’t connect. They hadn’t even conclusively tied it back to the potions case that the Aurors had been working on.
“That was always the one thing—the one thing I could do to grab his attention, to get him to forget about all the ways I was a disappointment, when I was struggling in classes, when I turned out to be rubbish at Quidditch, when he figured out I was gay.
“Just until it’s safe to go back to work,” Harry said. “Hopefully, I’ll be able to go back sometime next week, at least during the day when everyone is there.”
Harry stepped into the Floo and called out for the Burrow, landing in the familiar sitting room a moment later.
Harry leaned forward, draping himself over his boyfriend’s back, kissing along his exposed upper back, before whispering in his ear. “Touch yourself.”
It wasn’t until they had attended a weekend retreat for Ginny’s Quidditch team that it had finally come to a head. The Holyhead Harpies players, their significant others, and families had all been invited to a fun weekend away before the start of another season.
So by Monday, he was more than a little glad to be back at work. This he could do—focus on the job, push back everything else. But frustratingly, while he’d been antsy all day wanting to get out to the field so he could give himself something to fully engross himself in, they hadn’t been able to get the go ahead until the work day was long over. In the end, though, it was just as well since it would be easier for them to have a look around at night. Disillusionment Charms were more likely to be caught out in bright sunlight, not that London had much of that, but Harry always felt more covered at night.
Harry didn’t know. If he asked to come, Draco would let him and then he’d be over-sensitive as the plug inevitably sped back up once Draco was done playing with him. If he didn’t, he’d continue to be on edge. There was no good answer.
Draco finds his wand first and starts hollering out some spells that Harry doesn’t recognise, but nothing is working. “How the fuck do you stop water?” he yells.
Harry shot a series of Stinging Jinxes her way in response, moving quickly over the training mats to keep himself from being an easy target.
Harry moaned in agreement as Draco licked the bone of his ankle and started making his way back up his body, this time sticking to the inside of his leg, which was far more sensitive.
She nodded and looked like she didn’t quite believe him, but gave him a small smile and pulled open the door.
“Okay, first—” Draco started, dropping a kiss on Harry’s jaw. “I am really not upset about taking a day off work. I don’t know about you and your job, but I actually enjoy an extra day off now and then. Second, I was not about to leave a sexy Auror in my bed to go deal with drunks for the evening.”
Harry tapped on the arm of his chair. They’d still need to go through all the Manor files and papers, but now they might not even be able to trust enough other people to help them. If nothing else, whoever was behind this had bought themselves more time.
They laid in satisfied silence for a few minutes, and Harry's eyes travelled over the room from his vantage point on the floor, seeing the dust and mess that still needed to be cleaned.
After some raised voices and a lot of back and forth, Draco had stopped mid-argument, taken a long look at Harry, and agreed to clean the house without another word of complaint. Harry didn’t trust it. Draco was up to something.
“Is this still my father’s case? Because I can tell you with absolute honesty that I do not give a shit if you find the person responsible.”
He let his mind wander as he walked, turning over the details of the case. They were missing something, but he couldn’t work out what. So far, they had a wealthy ex-Death Eater, a “consultant,” and a Floo Regulation worker from the Ministry. Lucius Malfoy and Abner Astor fit together well enough—they were acquaintances, and both ran with the same crowds of dubious politicians and other criminal members of society. Ernest Foxley didn’t fit at all. Other than having been seen talking to Lucius Malfoy on occasion, which put him in good company with half the Ministry, his record was squeaky clean.
“Don’t worry, Potter,” Scott said as he started putting potions in a small field bag. “I might not have field experience, but I compete internationally in duelling competitions.” He hoisted the bag over his head, straightening the strap across his body, and then smiled. “And, sometimes, I even win.”
Draco just nodded and gave him a small smile as he gestured to the hallway they presumably needed to take to her flat.
“Whoa—You’re going to be in so much trouble with Grandma,” Teddy said as he looked around the mess in the kitchen.
Harry levitated a few training dummies to the side of the large room as the trainees cleared the mats, stacking them in a corner.
Harry’s shoulders are tight, so Draco climbs up on the bed, straddling Harry’s hips and firm arse. He’s able to put more pressure into it this way, and while he’s certainly got plans for after this, he knows that Harry really does need a massage. While it’s not as bad as when he was a player, Harry still does a lot of flying and demonstrating as a coach, and he’s not as young as he used to be. Plus, Draco’s become quite proud of his masseuse skills over the years. Being married to a professional Quidditch athlete meant learning a certain amount about sports injuries—particularly with a husband as stubborn as Harry.
He pushed off the wall and started towards the alley to apparate when he noticed that he forgot his coat. He’d draped it over the stool next to him. Fuck. He took another deep breath and headed back to the pub.
The smaller cages were stacked one on top of the other, and some cages had far too many creatures crammed in for the space. It was so unnecessary, Harry thought in anger, given that magic could have easily created better spaces for these creatures. Even if the bastards were doing whatever they were doing with them—selling them, Harry assumed—the mistreatment was only cruelty, given that even an OWL student could have enlarged the cages and given them more comfortable conditions. He felt his magic bubble up as rage filled him, but he fought to tamp it down as he moved to the next cage.
“No, but thanks. I’m just going to grab a takeaway and collapse on my sofa.” Harry smiled. She always seemed to worry about him going home alone as if he hadn’t been doing this for twenty years. He appreciated the concern, even if it was misplaced.
“We didn’t,” Mel said, as she added to her notes. She made eye contact with Harry and nodded. “That was all we needed to check. Thanks for your time.”
Once Harry opened his flies, he paused. There were just so many ways this could go wrong. He wanted to make sure he didn’t take it too far; he didn’t even know what might be too far for Draco.
“Thought you might need a break from that conversation,” Justin added, once Anders was out of earshot, holding out a drink to Harry.
Harry couldn’t keep his eyes shut for long; the show was all too enticing. He looked back up to see Draco on his hands and knees, his pert arse facing Harry.
Once he made his way back to the party, he headed to the kitchen for some water. He needed to clear his head a bit. As he stepped into the stark white room, he saw Draco by the counter talking animatedly to a tall blond man, his eyes bright and happy. The man let out a loud laugh and touched Draco’s arm, and Harry felt his stomach twist uncomfortably, quickly deciding the water wasn’t that important.
“Don’t worry, Teddy. We just have a little more to do for dinner,” Draco said, moving away from the wall.
Harry’s left stretched in the middle of the room with no stimulation for the first time in what feels like hours.
Malfoy waved a hand at him. “Fine, fine. Monday then. I’ll come up with a plan over the weekend,” he said, before turning and walking off without so much as a goodbye.
“Two weeks,” Draco repeats as he trails his finger up Harry’s chest. “That sounds about right.” He then runs his finger over Harry’s nipple, causing it to pebble.
“Let’s go celebrate, then,” Malfoy said, shuffling his stack of parchment back into a neat stack. “Grab a drink in Hogsmeade?”
He pulled out his notepad and the stack of parchment from the file. They had both too few and too many leads at this point. Normally, they’d look at anyone who might have an issue with the victim, someone who might be angry or have reason to want the person dead. That list was ridiculously long where Lucius Malfoy was involved. But at the same time, they didn’t have any good leads to start with. This case was only a few days old and already he felt like he was slogging through it.
Harry took a slow drink, processing that information. “What about your mother? Wouldn’t it have gone to her?”
Wednesdays were a light day for Harry. Since flying classes only met once a week and most were electives, he had a lighter course load than most of the other professors—something Malfoy made sure to frequently comment on.
Draco deepened the kiss and ran his hands down Harry’s back, slipping under the fabric. Harry’s whole body sang at the contact. But he needed more. He let instinct take over and pulled back, pulling his shirt off a little too fast, getting his head stuck in the movement. He heard Draco huff a laugh beneath him, and Draco helped free him from the collar before tossing it across the room.
As he entered the toilets, he tried not to think about it. About how this cock felt familiar in his hand, even soft, as he pulled out and relieved himself. About how the trouser fastenings reminded him of a night after the pub a few weeks ago—Harry drunkenly fumbling with the clasps, unable to get to Draco fast enough. Draco had insisted they swap clothes after the accident that morning, something about not being seen around the office in ill-fitting clothes. Harry’d been too flustered by the whole showering in another person’s body situation to give it much thought. He’d gone as fast as he could and tried to touch Draco’s body as little as possible while still cleaning off any of the remains of the potions. But now, the clothes just added to Harry’s memories of Draco’s body—the way the expensive fabric felt against his legs, the tightness of the cut.
She had a few employees left over from the old guard, from back when the department focused on regulation instead of rights. From what he’d gathered, they were neither bad enough at their jobs nor oppositional enough for her to fire on merit alone. And most of them had been around the Ministry long enough that she’d be causing herself political grief for firing them without cause.
“Sorry, Professor,” the student said, as Harry shuffled around Jacob. “I thought I had it under control.”
“No, just—” Mel was clearly fighting back a smile. “That was just—when you two saw each other, I’d wondered—”
“You alright?” Draco asked as he held another glass of water out to Harry, trading him for the empty one. “I really should have warned you not to take any drinks from Riley,” he added with a grimace. “They are an absolute menace with mixed drinks.”
“You were perfect, Harry, so good, love,” Draco whispers as he lays him back, covering him with a blanket. “I’m going to take such good care of you all weekend.”
Harry has no idea how much time has passed when Draco finally shifts and starts to slide his chair back. Harry opens his mouth, letting Draco slide out of him. Strands of spit glisten as they stretch away from Harry’s mouth.
Harry could hear the conversation continued, but their voices dropped too low for him to hear, and he slowly drifted back to sleep.
A heavy silence fell over the otherwise empty room as Harry fiddled with the cuff of his sleeve. He apparently had no idea how to talk to Malfoy if they weren’t insulting one another. After a long moment, Malfoy crossed his legs, pulled out a large stack of parchment and a quill and got to work, his papers balanced on one knee. Harry let out a silent sigh, letting his shoulders relax marginally. Right, they could get work done. Harry didn’t have anything to grade but pulled his folio out of his satchel. Might as well get started on next week’s lessons.
Harry closes his eyes, eyelashes wet against his cheeks and feels the warm glow of submission fill him even as his body shakes. “Yes, yes, green,” he sobs out.
“Oh my god.” Harry scrambles into a seated position, his hands hovering over Draco’s cock. “That doesn’t look good.”
, what they’d still likely say if their Golden Boy came out of the closet. But then he thought of Ron and Hermione and his other friends, and then Draco, and found himself caring less and less about those consequences than he previously had. And like Mel had said, at least he didn’t have to worry about legal ramifications for something that was completely natural. “When was that? The coded letters?”
“I suppose that’s for the best,” Harry replied, imagining the Muggle version of Seamus Finnegan getting drunk and then throwing axes.
“Maybe just stick to shots and beer, Head Auror Weasley.” Draco laughed. “Call me over if it’s anything more complicated.”
Harry pulled his notebook back out and took Malfoy’s suggestions into consideration as he worked through the second year lesson plan. Worst case, it didn’t work and he was back at square one.
Harry noticed other small indicators of age—fine wrinkles in the corners of her eyes and forehead, grey hair streaked amongst blonde—and was struck by how long it had been since he’d spoken to the woman.
“Sorry, what?” Now it was Harry’s turn to be shocked. He looked around the pub; there were a few other patrons, and the owner was sorting through some bottles behind the bar.
“Oh.” A red flush crept back up Draco’s face as he pressed his lips together. “They’ve moved onto… well…” Draco trailed off, his face deepening with color as his eyes followed some movement in the reflection that Harry couldn’t see.
On a few occasions over the past few weeks, Harry had found himself caught off-guard around the castle, haunted by visions of the war, echoes of screams hitting him like a punch to the chest. So, the new pub had been a good choice.
Draco sighs and then takes a deep breath before folding up his copy of the Daily Prophet. He vaguely remembers a time when he was able to read an entire article in one sitting without being interrupted every few minutes.
“Of course, Teddy. You know I come by nearly every week,” Harry reminded him with a laugh, before turning and giving Andromeda a hug, promising her he’d see her soon.
“Stay put, put up a shield if anyone comes this way, and call through the Cogitatio if you need backup.” Harry waited for a nod of affirmation and then turned back to the fight. It was nearly over. Scott appeared to be assisting Clara in taking down an older grizzled-looking wizard, and Ron and Proudfoot were each duelling their own combatant. The others appeared to be tending to the injured, Hardy hovering over Savage with the healing supply bag.
Harry freezes and then pulls off Draco’s cock while Draco props himself up on his elbow. They share a look before they both turn to the door.
Just as he starts to feel the urge to thrust his hips, his body trying to chase another orgasm, the pressure disappears. Harry blinks and strains his neck up to see Draco lower his head, holding Harry’s eye contact as he wraps his lips around the length, a smug look in his eyes.
“Day off of work?” Arthur asked as Harry took a seat at the table. “It’s Friday, right? I can’t ever tell any more. Retirement, you know.” He smiled as he folded up his newspaper.
Harry’s gut twisted at the fallout that two of his closest friends were going to be dealing with for months to come. While Ron was safe from the worst of the scrutiny given that he led the team that brought down the operation, Hermione and her department were being hammered by the press. But Harry knew if anyone could weather this storm and come out stronger for it, it was Hermione. And if he knew her at all, both her department and Magical Creature rights would come out stronger in the end too.
Harry’s vaguely aware of Draco yelling about something as he starts to push himself up with a groan. He’s already feeling the future bruising along the length of his body and where the sink landed on his upper thigh when he notices a wet sensation hitting his back from behind. He turns, unprepared for the stream of water that blasts him in the face.
They discussed the various ways they could set up the large Manor in increasingly ridiculous ways. Their shoulders shook, and Draco even teared up at a few of his more wild ideas, enjoying the thought of Lucius rolling over in his grave at the idea of the familial home being treated in this way.
“Higgins and Perry,” Ron replied, his expression hardening. “They apparently also saw you at the Ministry on Saturday and called it in. Jyce had both ward experts and Dark Arts experts on staff. They set up a quick illegal connection through your Floo and dismantled just enough of the wards to slip the Dark device into your house—no one even had to enter the premises.”
“I’m fine,” Harry replied firmly. “I got around this morning just fine. Went to the kitchen and made myself toast and everything.”
Harry placed the last broom in a line on the grass. Now all there was to do was wait for the students to arrive. Having no classes during the first hour, he had nothing to do after breakfast but set up for his second hour. He wiped his palms on his robes for what must have been the tenth time in the past few minutes and closed his eyes, taking a breath and feeling absolutely ridiculous. There was no reason a group of first-years should be this intimidating. He had to keep reminding himself that he certainly knew more about flying than they did, particularly as most of them would have never been on a broom in their lives.
Harry found himself staring at the man, not for the first time in the past few days. Draco’s eyes were crinkled in the corners, pure joy written on his face. Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever seen him so free and happy; he looked beautiful. Draco’s eyes flicked up to Harry’s and the laughter settled down. Harry could feel the tension in the air and wondered if it was possible that he wasn’t the only one whose feelings had been shaping into something new that week, something that could possibly be beyond friendship.
Draco flipped the next card, a five, and gave the cursory tugs before adding them to the pile. Another card was then flipped. Seven.
Harry wondered if he had it wrong; maybe Malfoy really wasn’t the yoghurt thief, and someone was going around stealing all sorts of things out of the staff pantry. Then again, it could just be a ruse to throw Harry off his track. “Well,” Harry replied, hesitantly. “I already tried that. Didn’t work, but I’m open to suggestions.”
Draco huffed a laugh and dipped back down, sucking Harry’s bollock right into his mouth as Harry keened. Harry’s hands hurt from how tightly he was gripping Draco’s sheets, and he fleetingly wondered if he was damaging them. He couldn’t hold onto that thought for long before he felt Draco’s hand pull up on his bollocks to place a wet kiss beneath them. A sound ripped out of Harry that was nearly a sob as Draco continued to move lower.
It made sense to Harry. He could absolutely see the draw of Draco’s life. Living his own way, no one to judge or pressure him in any way, especially given the amount of pressure and expectations Draco had been raised with. And really, Harry could see the appeal of this lifestyle even for himself.
He landed on his stoop a bit more unsteadily than normal, a bead of sweat dripping down his neck from the strain. He hoped his exertion hadn’t actually set his healing back, but there was nothing to be done about it now. So he grabbed the doorknob and pushed in.
“Go ahead, you can ask.” Harry sighed. It was everyone’s question—even when he’d spent a few years going to the various charity events to help raise money, it seemed it was all anyone wanted to talk about.
Harry feels the feather move up, over his perineum, then to his balls. He can’t fight it anymore and he lets his body squirm and writhe. “Oh god,
“I know we’ve only been partners for a few years, but I consider you one of my closest friends,” she said, leaning back against the sink. “I hope you see me that way too, and I just want you to know you can tell me things… you know, if you want to.” She bit her lip before turning to busy herself with preparing the tea, leaving a heavy silence that fell over the room.
“You know me,” Ron replied, a smile in his voice. “Okay, get some sleep. I need you in top shape tomorrow.”
“Sorry, dear. We can try again next weekend if you would like.” She gives him a commiserating smile. “I know you two need a break.”
“How are you doing? You feeling alright?” Ron asked, his eyes roaming over Harry as if looking for an outward sign of injury. “I still wish we could have had you seen by a Healer.”
“Go back and talk to the roommates. Find out where he might go if he was trying to disappear. We’ll talk to his co-workers,” Harry said.
As Harry checked that the equipment had all made it back into the shed, several of the brooms fell over.
Harry pinched his side, earning him a yelp, and then leaned in, running his free hand down Draco’s chest. “I’m currently removing your shirt one button at a time.”
Harry pants, feeling his body trying to pull away from whatever spot Draco is hovering over, trying to avoid the zap that’s coming.
Harry nodded again, blinking back the tears. It was okay. They still loved him. It might not be perfect—he knew Molly might not really understand, that in her heart she probably wanted him to settle down with a nice witch and have lots of babies, but it was a start.
Harry nodded. Draco likely wasn’t wrong there. While the Malfoys might have escaped any real legal consequences, they were widely hated after the war. It had mellowed somewhat as a new generation grew up and came of age. But anyone who had been directly involved in the war wasn’t likely to forget anytime soon. Had Harry not been presented with such a drastically changed Draco several weeks prior, even he’d still have the same opinion of the man as he had during the war.
“Why don’t you explore this new body?” Draco’s voice rumbled, soft and firm. He clearly wasn’t having the same hangups as Harry. He hadn’t so much as glanced towards the door since this all had started.
Neville stopped his explanation of how he was going to change up the Sixth Year’s lessons on Snargaluffs and greeted the other professor.
But then Draco puffed out a breath, sending a cloud of flour out from his face. “Oh, you’re going to so regret that.” He rubbed the flour off his face and broke out into a mischievous grin. He grabbed his water glass off the counter and tossed the contents at Harry, who wasn’t able to jump out of its path fast enough.
Harry thought about the frenzy of reporters hanging around the Ministry and decided a trip through Diagon Alley wasn’t on the top of his list of things he wanted to do.
“It’s my birthday, Black! Of course I’m drunk. Why don’t you make yourself useful and get me another drink?” She made a shooing motion to him.
“Maybe…” Mel tapped on the rune again with her wand and tried a few more variations to no avail. “Wait—what about,
Draco looked up over his glasses and then sighed and pushed them up into place again. “To come up with an antidote for a random collection of illegal potions that shouldn’t even have this effect?”
Once they were on the path to Hogsmeade, they fell into easy conversation about Quidditch, moving from discussing the Hogwarts teams into discussing the league and various teams’ chances.
“Erm. I’m not sure, Draco got me some sort of lager that was really good the other day. It had oranges in it or something?” Harry wondered if Draco generally worked in the office or would be out and around the pub soon.
The embedded levitation charm in them will keep his wrists and ankles from bearing the weight of his body as he floats a few feet above the ground. The ropes will keep him strung tight, unable to do much more than wriggle his torso. His head isn’t supported though, so he has to alternate between holding it up and dropping it back when it becomes too tiring.
The lube is everywhere at that point, Harry’s arse cheeks, Draco’s arm, both of their legs—Draco doesn’t even want to think about what their sofa and rug look like. He’ll deal with it in the morning. Grimacing and knowing he’s going to regret it in the morning, he wipes the back of his hand on the side of the sofa cushion beneath him. Then he rubs the rest onto Harry’s arse, down his crack, pushing some into his furrowed hole as Draco massages the area. At least they won’t have any issues with not having enough lube. Draco slips a slick finger in and then another, slowly working Harry open.
“Just imagine how sensitive you’ll be,” Draco says almost reverently as he slowly lets go of Harry’s head and goes back to running a hand down his body, pulling goose pimples up Harry’s chest in the process.
“Well, I have to say, I expected you to be a bit more freaked out by this,” Draco said with a laugh.
“Yeah.” Draco sighed and then ran his hands over his face with a grunt, before propping himself up on his elbow, facing Harry. “So work,” he said, running a finger down Harry’s arm with a smile. “Nothing I can do to convince you to take a sick day or three?”
“Yeah,” Harry replied, “right when I got here, before the debriefing. Mild magical exhaustion, otherwise I’m right as rain.”
“Thanks again, Ron,” Harry said, hoping his friend could understand just how much he appreciated him—how much he appreciated having someone he knew was on his side no matter what. Ron smiled and nodded, and Harry turned and apparated on the spot.
“Oh god,” Harry replied, mildly mortified. “I should have never told you. You’re going to be awful about this now.”
Harry rolled his eyes, but after a moment of stubborn reflection, he realized Malfoy had a point. “Okay, fine then. What do you want, Malfoy?”
Ron shook his head and then closed his eyes. “Okay, we’re going to talk about this later. We’ve got a bigger problem right now,” he said, looking up at the house with a quick jerk of his head. “So who saw you?”
Draco pulled off his own shirt, and Harry shifted off his lap so Draco could pull off his trousers and pants. They scooted down in bed until they were laying down, facing each other.
A shudder rolls down Harry’s spine as he feels Draco’s fingertips playing with the edge of the lace knickers. He feels the light pressure as they trace his skin along the low of his back, around the skin just about the jut of his hip. A sigh escapes him as Draco traces along the front of the knickers, following the scalloped lace edge along the lowest part of Harry’s abdomen. His cock throbs, pulling against the lace as it fills out.
“Yes,” Harry replied. “It’s a very good thing.” He smiled, trying to express just how much it was not a problem that Mel had got the promotion. While he was sure Mel knew that Harry had turned it down first, he really wasn’t keen on spreading that information around. She had more than earned the position and deserved not to feel like the second choice.
The first time, Harry had got so hard that he’d come at the first touch from the other man. So, it became a regular scene, perfect for when Draco had to work and couldn’t spend his time on other activities.
“I’m okay—no one else has been attacked.” She pulled back and looked him over. “What about you? Ron told me about your home, the spell.”
Draco ran his hands down Harry’s side soothingly as he kept pressing in. Harry panted as the pressure grew, a burn replacing the gentle stretch. Just when he thought he was going to have to ask Draco to stop, to give him a minute, Draco’s hips pressed against Harry’s arse.
Longbottom already offered to get her set up,” Draco said, knowing full well Luna had plenty of help from their last discussion. Draco had been helping her with the necessary paperwork already.
Just as the pressure and the stimulation started to become too much, Draco cried out, body tensing and stilling. Harry felt a new warmth and wetness added to the mess between them. He released them both and slid his hand just around Draco’s cock, gently working him through his orgasm until he cried out again and collapsed onto Harry.
His exhausted body continues to try to escape the torture, pulling at the restraints, twisting and bucking away. Even though Harry knows he can’t escape, he can’t stop trying to get away from the sensations that wrack his body. It’s too much, and each time feels longer than before even though in the recesses of his mind he knows that’s probably not the case. He lets himself react and doesn’t try to control his body or the sounds coming out of his mouth as he protests the continued torment.
leads here. We have about a million little possible leads. This is going to take time, and we don’t need to burn ourselves out just yet.” He stretched as he stood up, bones cracking as they popped back into place.
The rope around his wrists was pulled down firmly, forcing his elbows back and his chest out as his back arched ever so slightly.
When they left some time later, they paused just outside the door. Harry wanted to say something, how Draco could call any time, how they could be friends, how he wanted to spend more time with him. But he couldn’t seem to get any of it out.
“Time for a break,” Draco says as if it’s just another day at the office. He stands up and stretches, his crisp white shirt tugging at his waistband. His soft cock hangs out of his grey trousers, and Harry can’t look away. Draco must catch Harry’s interest because he huffs a laugh. “Over here, pet.”
A Jack of Spades was flipped and Harry let out a sigh. His bollocks continued to throb, but the growing arousal as Draco’s hand worked him for another ten strokes soon drowned out the pain.
Harry couldn’t watch for long, as his composure was hanging on by a thread. He needed to keep it together so that he could be a steady presence in the room.
Harry waited as a few of his fellow Aurors cleared out of a meeting in Ron’s office, still talking about the latest illegal potions case as they walked out. As frustrating as his current case was, Harry was glad to not be on that one. From what he’d seen so far, it was pretty disturbing—batches of off-market healing potions had sent several witches and wizards to St Mungo’s with permanent brain damage.
Harry closed the last drawer and steadied himself on the front of the cabinet. He really should have stopped for lunch hours ago. He looked at his watch. It was nearly dinner, so it was no wonder he was feeling so faint. Between over-exerting himself and being hungry and thirsty, he was feeling the residual effects of the spell damage in full. No matter. He had what he needed, he’d take it all home and see if he could find any more connections. If nothing else, it seemed very likely that someone had been tampering with the Floo records—yet another clue pointing to a mole inside the Ministry.
They’d come in early that morning, trying to get a head start on the evidence before Monday. There was just so much to go through. Harry was finding himself unable to focus, at least on what amounted to the more innocuous letters. Even though they were sticking to more recent correspondences, using the spell Harry had the Magical Forensics Team teach him, he couldn’t help but feel a tightening of anxiety every time he picked up a new stack. He didn’t want to read any more of the bastard’s thoughts about homosexuality, and, frankly, he didn’t want to read one more word about Draco from the man. The building anxiety around what he might find in the letters was twisting around his feelings about going to Lila’s birthday party that evening. His stomach was actually sick with nerves, no matter how many times he tried to remind himself that this wasn’t him coming out. Actually, no one there needed to know anything about him.
Harry could tell Draco was already getting antsy again, though. And while Draco hadn’t said anything of having bigger plans, Harry saw how he eyed every abandoned shopfront in both wizarding and Muggle London. He had a feeling Draco was well on his way to being quite the proprietor of trendy pubs.
Abandoning the shed in its messy state, Harry flicked his wand behind him to close and lock the doors. He headed toward the castle, stretching his arms side to side as he walked. He knew he’d fallen a bit out of shape during the time he attempted charity work after leaving the Falcons, but he was still surprised at how sore he was from just one day of teaching.
Just one more day and then it was the weekend. Somehow he’d got through Thursday after apparating Draco to his flat, but just going through the motions was taking a lot out of him. Mel and he had conducted what felt like non-stop interviews all day—mostly with the wix found at the crime scene. Harry knew that Ron and Quarrington, the Head of the DLME, had spent the day conducting the interrogations with Higgins, Perry, and Robards. Harry was sure to hear about what came from those interviews soon enough. Nothing good, he was sure.
Unable to stand much longer as the weariness set back in, Harry sat back on the bed, loosening his grip on his wand but unable to put it down.
Draco’s careful not to touch Harry as he shifts on the bed and travels lower. And Harry isn’t sure he’s going to be able to take another minute; his cock is already hard and leaking where it rests against his leg. The teasing movement, the tickling breaths heighten every sensation. And after a whole month of failed attempts at sex with Harry’s only orgasms coming from a couple of quick and rough wanks in the shower, he’s not sure he’s ever been so desperate.
“Fuck.” Draco started to rub his face, accidentally knocking Harry’s glasses askew and swearing again under his breath. “Okay. Yeah, okay.”
There was a light, wet pressure on the skin around his hole, setting off every nerve ending in Harry’s body. A moan escaped his lips. Then there was a breath, air teasing the surface, just shy of too much, and Harry’s muscles flexed involuntarily, nearly pushing Draco away with his leg.
Draco continued to pump him, twisting at the head, not slowing down. Harry whimpered, his hips jerking, trying to get away.
The right size for what exactly, Harry didn’t have to wait for long to find out, as Draco had ordered him naked and on his back, before spreading him out, and carefully and methodically securing him to the heavy mahogany furniture.
Harry let himself get lost in the movement, the sensations—in Draco’s hand tightly grasping his hip, the stretch and fullness as Draco pushed in, the sounds from both of them that filled the air. He lost himself in the push and pull, the sounds of bodies moving against each other, the groans and cries as each of them came in succession. And once they’d cleaned up, curling around each other on the small bed, Harry let himself drift to sleep, thinking only of how happy he was in that moment.
“Hey, Shaw—if I haven’t told you both enough times today—that was some excellent work. I want you to take the rest of the day off.”
Ron sighed as he walked over to Harry. “This is going to be a lot to go through. I can’t decide if I’m ecstatic about the amount of things we might uncover, or horribly depressed at how many work-hours this is going to take. We’ve still got the potions ring case along with a few smaller ones we need to be focusing on.”
Draco grabbed the cocktails from the bar, nodding to the bartender, before scanning the hall for the best path back to Harry. Preferably, whatever route took him furthest away from Ellis from Accounting. Draco was one accounting pun away from upending a table. It was bad enough he had to listen to those terrible jokes every time he dropped the Magical Maintenance department monthly budget off; Draco certainly didn’t need to be regaled with them during the Annual Ministry Spring Ball.
“I’ve been so fucking worried about you, you bastard,” she said as she released him, lightly knocking him on the arm.
After a few minutes, Draco felt his erection start to calm, the urgent need to come being replaced by a general throbbing arousal.
Once again, Draco holds him there, and Harry has to fight his body—he knows it will be okay, knows he’ll be able to breathe again in just a few seconds, but his body reacts of its own accord. Harry also knows the chemicals coursing through his veins are also adding to the mix. He was already starting to feel a bit floaty after his last orgasm, and this is likely to push him right over the brink. He has no doubt that Draco knows that as well as he holds Harry’s head with firm hands for just a few seconds longer as Harry’s throat convulses around the intruder.
His entire body feels overly sensitised, between the feather and the potion all his nerve endings are on high alert. Even the air moving subtly around his body, under his back, across his chest starts to feel like torture. His cock is hard and straining, already desperate for release.
Harry let out a shaky breath and wrapped his fingers around his hard cock, again not moving without specific direction. He looked up at Draco, locking in on the green eyes staring back at him. Somehow, it was still so clearly Draco. Nothing about his expression or mannerisms was Harry.
,” Harry cries out as Draco picks up the pace, doing exactly as promised—fucking Harry until he can’t remember a single thing he had been worried about at the start of the weekend.
Of course, the quiet only lasted so long, as they eventually fell back into an easy friendship. Now, much to Harry’s annoyance, it seemed it was her life mission to get him to find a relationship of his own.
One by one, the team members announced they were ready until they were all set. Harry felt his heartbeat kick up a notch, the all-too-familiar adrenaline rushing through his veins. He slightly loosened his grip on his wand, just enough to give himself better dexterity, fighting back his body’s instinct to hold it tighter.
Harry sat down on the edge of the bed. The strain of the day was hitting him, and the potion was wearing off. He found his eyes were drooping shut and he fought to stay awake. It was a losing battle, so he toed off his shoes and laid down on the bed, resting his head on one of the pillows. A faint trace of Draco’s cologne, woodsy and a little sweet clung to the pillows, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from turning his head into it. He inhaled deeply, letting a sense of peace settle over him, and fell asleep almost immediately.
Ron checked his watch. “We’re going to need to wrap this up or suffer my mum’s wrath for being late to my dad’s birthday dinner.”
“We’re not—” Harry huffed, his face burning. “It’s not like that. We’re just friends,” He supposed he should be glad that was the sticking point for Ron. Even still, the whole conversation was going better than many of Harry’s hypothetical scenarios he had played out to himself over the years.
Harry unlocked it to find another message from Ron, asking about how much experience he had with kids Hugo and Rose’s age.
Once Draco bottoms out, he pauses for a painfully slow moment. Finally, he starts to move, a deliberately slow pull out, a painstakingly slow press in, Harry is moaning and writhing beneath him. His cock is trapped between then, unable to get enough pressure or friction. Draco shifts, changing the angle, and Harry feels his prostate light up, just a slow drag, just enough to pull another desperate dry sob out of him. His entire body is screaming with the need to come. He tries to focus on Draco, on the blaze in his darkened eyes, on the bead of sweat on his forehead, on the way his breathing is becoming unsteady even as he continues to fuck Harry in an unbearably controlled pace.
Harry put down the notebook he had been going through and stood up, stretching his legs as he did, stiff from sitting for so long on the floor. He walked over to where Draco was camped out, careful not to disturb the piles of papers and parchment now littering the room. Carefully shifting a few piles to the side, he sat down next to him.
Draco instinctually cups his throbbing painful cock before recoiling and howling at the added pain from the pressure of his own touch.
“Okay, enough of that,” Draco continued, shaking his head slightly. “I don’t really want to talk about it. How are you doing? What do you do for fun anyways besides hang out at terrible pubs with terrible food in Diagon Alley, or pubs with exceptional company on Wednesdays?” Draco lips tugged into a smile.
The other Junior Auror, Bradbourn, spoke up. “No way. Erm, I mean, no, sir, it’s not possible. The reason it’s untraceable is because the poison dissipates so quickly once it’s left the creature. From the research we found from the Wizarding University of Manilla, they’ve been unable to preserve it to study even under a stasis.”
“What do I get? And make it good, no trying to get out of your punishment if you lose. You won’t like what I come up with.”
Harry whimpered in agreement and forced his legs wide to ensure that he wouldn’t close them accidentally. Each smack sent pain deep, his cock flagging from the abuse enough that Draco had to use his other hand to hold it out of the way while he finished off the final five.
Draco exhaled through his nose, trying to not visibly pout. That had not been the idea behind this. The last thing he needed was more rules. Rules were the boring part.
“Keep going,” Draco huffed out, his own hand moving quickly across his cock. “Milk yourself dry for me.”
“I’m going to need a little more detail than that, otherwise, I’m going to think I made a bad deal here.”
And when Harry wrapped his hand around Draco’s cock again, Draco cried out, and his body still rocked, but he no longer worried if he’d be allowed his release. Time became unimportant; the future no longer significant. And Draco only existed in the moment—there to take what Harry would give, give what Harry would take.
Harry stood up with a deep breath and brushed off his shirt, straightening it from where it had slightly bunched up while he was seated.
“Girlfriend.” Malfoy huffed a humourless laugh. “No, Potter. There’s no ‘girlfriend,’ but my two flatmates were there. Now what the fuck is going on?”
“Where did these come from?” Harry asked, confused. He had just assumed they were doing their gift exchange on Boxing Day.
“That’s what I thought, now get back upstairs if you want to be able to play with your toys at all this weekend.”
While during the war it was likely not only necessary but beneficial, as an Auror, it tended to consume his life. It kept him from having sustained parts of his life outside of work. Other than Mel and Jess, he hadn’t made any new friends since Hogwarts, and he had never even picked up a hobby. He sometimes wondered if his fixation was healthy, but then he’d catch a criminal, put away another dangerous wix and it would feel necessary.
Harry settled back into the pillow, not upset by the change of scenery—Draco’s mussed hair falling down around his face as he leant over Harry.
“Harry! Those are perfect.” She tugged him over to the mirror on the wall and turned him around, so his arse was facing the mirror.
The students smoothly dove back towards their gear bags by the stand nearest the path to the castle. These students all had their own gear, most of which was far superior to anything in the school broom shed. He reassured a few of the more intense students that they were doing just fine, and they’d keep working all semester long on getting them league-ready, before heading to the staff room.
As it turned out, Ron was more than happy to lend them whatever manpower they needed. Lucius was connected to enough high-ranking Ministry officials that there was a general sense of unease at his murder, even with the equally present sigh of relief.
“Well, it’s better than your idea of setting a trap on the entire pantry,” Malfoy muttered, carefully placing his chocolate back on the shelf. “This will alert our wands that someone took the items, and then we can come in here and catch the culprit.”
“Doxy skeletons,” Ron answered, and Harry sagged in relief, dropping the spell. Mel lowered her wand and sighed.
“That was terrible.” Draco laughs and spins them around, pushing Harry onto the bed on his back. “I can’t believe I married you.”
“The party was outside in the gardens of their house. The adults were all drinking and making boring small talk, but there were quite a few children, so we were running around and playing on the lawns and in the kitchen gardens around the side of the house.
Monday morning found Harry buried in case notes and evidence as he flipped through yet another file of a witch connected to Ernest Foxley, the missing wizard from Floo Regulation. Even though they had pulled the files during the previous week, Mel and Harry were still making their way through them. They’d been working day and night on the case for nearly two weeks, and he was pretty sure his blood pressure was reaching unstable heights. There weren’t enough solid connections, so everything just felt like drudgery—pointless work that was leading to nowhere. Mel was looking like she was in the same boat, given her generally greyish complexion as of late.
Draco huffed a laugh. “As good as I can be, I suppose. I’ve been torn this whole time about whether I wish I knew what else all these other letters and notebooks say, and really not wanting to know. Probably just as well they are out of my possession at this point.”
Harry allowed himself to relax. Draco didn’t seem like he was going to bring up Harry’s weird behaviour from the previous day. So, Harry worked on being as normal as possible. Well, as normal as it could be with the two of them out to lunch. It was strange being so close to the other man. Most of their youth had been spent hurling insults from half a classroom away. The only times they’d been closer had generally ended in some sort of bloodshed.
“Right,” Harry replied. It was hard to think of Malfoy as being somewhat of an expert here, but he guessed it made sense. He’d been teaching for nearly six years by then. Harry had just assumed the man ruled his class like Snape, by scaring the students into submission. But Malfoy seemed to actually consider how to best work with the students.
“No, I’m fine,” Harry replied. “Er—thanks? I’m just going to—” He gestured to the hallway before heading down the hall.
Harry tilted his head, resting it on the top of Hermione’s and trying to blow away a stray curl before it made its way into his eye. They’d been catching up, not that Harry had much going on in his life outside of work—at least not that he felt comfortable sharing. At first, he’d decided to keep his new friendship of sorts a secret because he thought it would be weird to explain how he kept going back to visit Draco. And he knew his friends wouldn’t leave that alone if they found out. But now… now that Draco knew about Harry, now that there was something else shared there, the idea of sharing their friendship felt too raw, like he’d be overly exposed. Even if he kept that part out of the conversation, it was just too close to a vulnerability that he wasn’t ready to share.
“No,” Harry said. “Absolutely not. I will find a Muggle hotel, somewhere out of the way. I’ve got a good few hours left on this potion, so I can apparate.”
After a somewhat disastrous morning class with the second year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws, Harry had the afternoon Hufflepuff and Slytherin second-year class run basic flying drills before moving on to lessons. The entire class had been insistent that they knew the basics, but so far, nearly the entire class needed to work on them.
Harry continued to whisper soothing things, rubbing his back, until Draco finally settled. He took a few shaky breaths and pulled back, knowing that Harry would need to be reassured after that.
Harry keeps his head strained up, watching Draco’s every move, hoping that he’ll touch him soon, even though somewhere in the deep recesses of his brain, he knows there’s only more torture coming after.
Harry laughed and leaned back as well, letting his body release some of the tension from the day. “I take it the slowing charm didn’t work?”
“Yeah?” Harry asked, raising his eyebrows. Having been a field Auror for so many years, he found himself more than a little unsure of what else he could be cut out for. He’d never even tried to do anything else.
“Ah, good. It appears we are all present,” Minerva said, peering over her glasses at the staff. Harry brushed the crumbs from his hands and did his best to look attentive.
“Fuck.” Draco ran a hair through his hair. “And you like it? Not the attempted murder part, obviously, but I mean you actually like the job?”
But it’s been a few weeks now, and Draco seems like he’s doing better; he’s at least not checking his cock in the mirror every morning from various angles to make sure there’s no lasting damage. So, Harry takes that as a sign that he’s emotionally and mentally recovering from the ordeal as well. And if not, Harry figures there are other ways they can have fun. Maybe Draco will feel more comfortable bottoming; they’ve not done that in a while. While Harry prefers being fucked—that feeling of being stretched open, his prostate pounded—at this point, he’ll take whatever he can get.
He could feel himself relaxing under it, even as his body coiled with the need to release. His brain slowed down; his thoughts stopped spinning. He could just be.
Harry opened up the panty, wondering if there was any chance that Trelawney’s presence had deterred the thief. After a moment, he sighed and closed the pantry doors. He should have known they wouldn’t have been so lucky.
When he opened the door, Harry saw the pub was still mostly empty. It was too early for the after-work crowd, particularly on a Wednesday. He hoped Malfoy’s schedule really was as predictable as he’d told them back when they did their initial interview. Harry wasn’t keen on the idea of sitting in this pub alone—it wasn’t a “drown your sorrows in solitude” kind of place, but more of a “meet up with your mates after work or on the weekend” kind of place.
Draco muttered an incantation and Harry felt ropes wrap around his thighs pulling outward. He looked down to see the ropes snaking around the sides of the bench where they were most certainly tying themself off. A second later, ropes tied themselves around his wrists, still behind Draco’s neck, locking them into place. Draco dropped his wand back on the table and ran his hands up Harry’s chest, stopping to pinch his nipples before continuing up and pulling his face to the side for a rough kiss. “There. Now isn’t that better?”
“Fuck,” Harry eventually says. He can’t remember the last time he’s come that hard, and really his brain isn’t working well enough to attempt to work it out.
“That’s over in Park Royal.” Harry pulled out his phone, looking up the London address on the Muggle internet. A map showed the building in an industrial area with train tracks crisscrossing the area. Using Muggle transport wasn’t unheard of in illegal magical operations. It tended to fly under the radar of most of the magical regulation departments, and a well-placed Obliviate solved any Muggle law enforcement issues. If anything, this address made Harry all the more sure they were on to something here.
When Ron had been promoted to Assistant Head Auror, Harry’d been worried about partnering with someone new. He’d been notoriously difficult to work with during his early days as an Auror, having issues with both authority and trust. But Mel was easy to work with in every way. She was laid back, thorough, and, most importantly, didn’t mind picking up the slack on paperwork when Harry forgot to finish it.
Draco held him tight and milked Harry through his release until he was trembling. After a moment, Harry blinked his eyes open, clearing the tears that had gathered in the corners. His chest was still heaving as he looked up to see Draco sitting back on his haunches between Harry’s legs, his eyes drunk with lust. He had his pyjama bottoms pulled down around his hips, a hand tightened around the base of his own flushed and hard cock.
“Agreed,” Harry replied quickly, wondering if self-obliviation was possible. Time to come up with the next plan—as quickly as possible and, ideally, forgetting this plan had ever happened.
Before Harry could get much farther from that thought, there was a creak in the flooring and Harry pulled back quickly, seeing Teddy standing in the entryway to the kitchen.
He rifled through the contents at the bottom of it until he felt the parchment. During the summer, he’d had visions of using the map to make rounds easier, laughing at the thought that he might gain a reputation from students for just happening to know which students were out of bed and exactly where they were at all times.
Just then, Lila came by with Harry’s sandwich, and a glass of water for Draco, with a reminder that he didn’t hydrate enough. Draco seemed to be debating on how to answer, so Harry started in on his sandwich and let Draco collect his thoughts.
After a moment, Draco leaned forward and placed his teacup on the table, a hair’s breadth from Harry’s hip.
Harry pulled the door open, stepping into the quiet hallway—a stark contrast from the growing volume of the party—and then headed down the stairs, holding tightly onto the handrail to keep himself steady. He could hear Draco following behind but didn’t acknowledge him. Harry knew he was being unreasonable but it felt like years of frustrations were bubbling up, even if none of them were Draco’s fault. His brain was far too fuzzy, and he could barely distinguish the swirling feelings, but a few were clear. Embarrassment, loneliness, shame. His skin tingled with the intensity of them as he pulled open the door to the street.
Ron walked in the room a moment later looking concerned, but Harry kept his wand levelled at the man. Mel started to drop hers but then seemed to think better of it and kept it steady.
“We were just wondering,” Opal said. “Did you really get fired from the Falcons because you were, erm…”
With another pop, it reappeared on the other side of the group. Harry quickly cast another Incarcerous.
“How should I know where your yoghurt is going, Potter?” Malfoy asked, still looking far too amused. “Maybe someone just really likes yoghurt.”
Harry and Draco finished cleaning up after dinner while Teddy played with his dragon keepers and dragons set in the sitting room. The day had been a stark contrast to the previous one. A well-rested Teddy turned out to be an agreeable Teddy. They’d also kept his sugar intake at a reasonable amount… well maybe a slightly over reasonable amount; it was Christmas Eve after all. But it was nowhere near the nutritional disaster that the previous day had been.
“So someone in the Ministry is in on this. God, this keeps just getting better—dead bodies, missing people, and now they’re trying to kill off some Aurors.”
Draco filled Ewan in on he and Harry’s shared history in very vague and somewhat inaccurate terms as Harry slowly drank his water. His head was too fuzzy, and it was all a bit confusing. It was one thing to find Draco attractive, have a bit of a crush, but Harry knew he needed to cool it with the jealousy. So, he sipped his water and tried to pull himself together.
Harry smiled and ran his hand back down the ropework on Draco’s back before grabbing another bundle of rope. Then, just as slowly as the first time, he unwrapped it, doubling up and gathering a starting point. He deftly joined that rope to the existing one and then worked it down the front of the harness before wrapping it around Draco’s body at his hips.
Harry turned the corner to see Malfoy approaching from the other direction. Before Harry could think too long on how good Malfoy looked in his robes, they arrived at the staff room door to hear muffled, and slightly panicked, voices.
Draco continued to toy with his oversensitive cock, alternating between faster strokes and slow long tugs. Harry continued to babble through his sobs, his hips pistoning side to side as his cock tried to escape its torture.
Harry slowly came to consciousness, becoming aware of a small puddle of drool on the cushion that his face was currently pressed into. He pulled back and closed his mouth, swallowing to ease the roughness in his throat. He’d probably been snoring.
“I think we’re going to get you to five today, pet.” Draco steps into Harry’s view, lifting his head up and kissing him soundly. “We all need goals, after all, right?”
“You need to rest, dear.” She started the dishes in the sink washing themselves, as Harry cleared the scraps of food off the second pile of dishes on the worktop.
“So good, Harry,” Draco murmurs in his ear as he leans up against Harry, clearly spent from his orgasm. Harry flexes his arms, bearing both their weights to keep them from collapsing forward on the desk. His vision goes fuzzy around the edges, arousal coursing through his veins.
“It’s raw poultry, Harry. I don’t think you understand how disgusting this is.” Draco pulled out his hand, looking white as a sheet before grabbing another handful.
Whatever hesitation Draco had seemed to break, and he pulled Harry to him, sliding a knee between his legs. They rocked up against one another, both pulling at the other’s clothes, impatiently pulling at buttons and belts and zippers. Once their shirts had been discarded somewhere in the near vicinity, Draco pulled Harry to the floor, leaning him back and climbing over him.
They’d need to put a few Aurors or MLE officers on watch, keeping an eye on his office and home so that they could interview him when he showed up. This street was going to be a nightmare to monitor. With the doors so tightly packed together on both sides of the street, there wasn’t a good hiding location, even for a disillusioned Auror. If this were a less shady case, he might send an owl requesting the wizard or witch of interest come to the Ministry for an interview. But he and Shaw had agreed that in this case such a direct approach was likely to result in a suddenly missing witness. Well, they’d figure something out… a rooftop perhaps, he thought, looking up.
Harry rushed over, casting stunners at the attacker’s back, the first glanced off whatever protective shield she’d cast over herself. He didn’t recognise her or any of the other wix in the fight—an unusual thing in a community as small as the wizarding world.
He walked slowly back to the door, one hand grasping the stack of papers and the other hand massaging the ache in his side. As he pulled open the door, he heard muffled voices and froze. He was still far enough in the backroom that he couldn’t see most of the office, but the door was also clearly open now, so he weighed his options.
Harry fidgeted with the worn blanket, unable to sit still. His body was sore and he was still exhausted from the spell damage, but he was getting increasingly agitated sitting around and not doing anything. He’d passed out shortly after Ron and Hermione had left last night, and he still hadn’t been able to see Mel.
Everyone stopped what they were doing. Mel stepped up next to Harry and squeezed his shoulder, and he felt a wave of gratitude that he had a partner that he trusted with his life.
“No.” Now it was Harry’s turn to smirk as he ran his fingers along the edge of the garter, along the top of his arse, meeting the edge of the lace panties and following the fabric back down along the edges of his crack, going lower still.
Harry balled up his napkin and threw it at her. As always, she plucked it out of the air before it bounced off her nose—damn Quidditch players.
“Perfect, bring your green sweater—the soft one—and some trousers. Not jeans, Harry; I’m not wearing jeans, even in your body.”
“Don’t you have some small helpless animal to dissect for potions ingredients or something?” Harry replied, rounding the corner and not waiting for a response. He could only hope that once classes were in session, there was little reason for someone who taught near the Quidditch pitch to cross paths with someone who taught in the dungeons.
Harry's still soft. In the back of his mind, he’s not even sure he can get hard again. Draco's slick hand slowly strokes him, up and down. Harry's grateful that he is using an abundance of lube. His cock is already sore from being the focus of so much attention for the last couple of hours.
The rest of the family slowly spilled into the enlarged room, and Harry greeted everyone, as he was dragged into the seat next to Ginny. Hermione had helped Molly enlarge the space as the family continued to grow. At this rate, they were just going to need an addition, as Harry was sure they must be getting close to the limits of what even magic could do to expand a space.
Draco gave him a flat look, clearly not impressed with the conversation manoeuvre, but he let it drop. “Not until five, so you’re stuck with me for the day.”
Draco exhaled, slow and loud. “I woke up around nine, lounged around my flat for a few hours, and then came to work.”
“I know it’s hard with your fame, dear. But there’s a young woman out there for you, I’m sure. But you’re never going to find her if you don’t put yourself out there.”
But it’s no use, unless he safewords, Draco is seeing this through. Harry has no doubt of that. Draco knows how to push him just enough, and Harry knows he’ll be floating high for some time. He’ll love everything about it later, even as tears stream down his face for the moment.
“Well, I slept today, so we can move on,” Harry replied before it dawned on him that he probably didn’t want to move on to the next topic.
The room fell silent—tense and awkward. Aubrey looked down, pursing her lips, and Percy’s eyebrows rose. Harry closed his eyes and took a breath.
“Ronald, I said to let everyone know, not scream through the house!” Molly’s voice rang out from the kitchen.
The Dragon’s Lair had been an instant hit within a couple of months of its opening. Draco hadn’t been wrong—the pub scene in wizarding London hadn’t been updated since the 18th century and had been desperate for some new life to be breathed into it. But even with that success, Draco had found himself not quite content, missing his Muggle friends too much.
So, this was what Draco was up to—clearly expecting Harry to call off the whole cleaning thing in lieu of other activities. Harry gritted his teeth and tried to focus on the game, his eyes soon wandering back to the edge of the skirt. But Harry wouldn’t be diverted so easily. If Draco wanted to pretend nothing was out of the ordinary, well, two could play at that game.
How Malfoy Senior escaped prison was still up to much speculation. Some people called it Malfoy luck; there hadn’t been any witnesses that actually had seen him do anything that would warrant a prison sentence. But Harry was convinced Lucius had bribed someone even though Harry had never found any evidence. So, Lucius had got hit with the maximum fine for his complicity, but none of the prison-worthy charges stuck. Even twenty years later, it still made Harry’s blood boil every time he saw the man strutting around the Ministry as if he hadn’t helped murder and torture countless wix and Muggles alike.
After Draco dropped several more crumbs, he looked at Harry with an apologetic smile, his eyes crinkling. “I promise I’m not normally this atrocious of a guest in someone’s bed.”
Harry was about to type out his reply when he stopped, remembering that he didn’t know who he could trust. Every fibre of his being rebelled against the idea that Draco would be somehow involved in this—bartender, tattooed, adult Draco. But his Auror instincts had to override his emotions on the matter, at least for the moment.
Harry didn’t know how much longer he could hold it, how long he could keep the magic from seeping in around the sides of the door as it swirled around him. But eventually, the pounding got lighter, the swirling clouds turned grey, and then everything had stopped.
Harry sat back on his haunches, anticipation building in his gut. They were so close. This had to be the answer.
A moment later, Harry gasps as Draco strokes down Harry’s chest and starts thumbing his nipple, making it harden instantly. A silver clamp then bites into the hardened nub, causing Harry to drop his head back and cry out. The other nipple quickly receives a similar treatment, and Harry is left panting through the stinging pain. It’s not their cruellest set, but it does enough on Harry’s overly sensitised nerves. He tries to breathe through it, to wait for the pain to settle into a dull throb.
He wants to thank him for giving him this, for breaking through all of Harry’s anxieties, stress, the pressures of his life. For letting him be free. But he can’t find the words as sleep pulls at him.
“Merlin, no.” Malfoy laughed. “I had to keep adjusting them for years. There is always one student who will find a way to slip through the safety cracks.”
“Teddy, what time is it?” Harry asked, staring up at the ceiling, the exhaustion seeping back in now that the initial alarm had passed.
His own cock hardens at the thought and his hand itches, wanting nothing more than to wrap his fingers around his cock and jerk himself off to completion. He’s so turned on. But that’s not what they are doing here. He’s here to service Draco, to be at his command. And he’s definitely not permitted to touch himself.
Harry sighed in relief as the staff room started filling up in preparation for the first staff meeting of the year. He’d seen most everyone at the welcome banquet, but the long staff table didn’t allow for much conversation.
Anticipation building, he rose as smoothly as he could. Harry’s hands hovered nearby, ready to steady him if he stumbled after kneeling for so long. Draco then put his feet hips-distance apart and locked his fingers behind his neck, elbows out. Goose pimples broke out across his skin at the motion. Being on display like this was always hardest—and most exciting—when they first got started.
Harry bit back a moan. It was too soon to get desperate. Draco’s hand felt so good, but he knew it wouldn’t be that simple.
“Door’s already locked and silenced.” Draco slips his arm around Harry, running his hand under Harry's shirt and tracing the muscles along his warm back.
Harry released the final loops around Draco’s waist so that his arms were no longer forced back. A tear slipped down Draco’s face, and he inhaled sharply.
Harry smiled, but he knew it didn’t reach his eyes. As much as he loved the idea of spending another few minutes with Draco, short as they might be, he was running out of willpower to force himself to go to work. “Sure, I can do that.”
Harry had attempted pairing off his second-year students to work with each other as Malfoy had suggested, but it was still too chaotic. They were flying into each other and not paying attention to the lesson. The lesson had ended with him yelling at the whole class and taking away points from both houses—not the way he was hoping the lesson would go.
Draco pulls himself up, sitting back on his haunches on the end of the bed, staring at his husband in disbelief. Draco bristles in indignation, his ego struggling between satisfaction that he’d helped Harry relax so thoroughly and absolute offence that Harry would fall asleep with Draco’s tongue in his arse.
Harry hooks his fingers, knowing he’s found the spot when Draco cries out below him. He smiles around his cock and then speeds up, enjoying the increasingly erratic breathing coming from Draco.
Harry let out a sound of frustration and then headed to his rooms. He needed to focus on preparing for try-outs anyways, and if he happened to check the map once or twice, just to glare at a particular dot and name, well, no one needed to know but him.
When he finally pulled back, Draco raised an eyebrow, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips. “So, what you’re saying is you liked that.”
Harry laughed and settled back against the steps. They sat in companionable silence, watching the Diricawl as it got smaller in the distance, disappearing with a pop every few minutes before reappearing a few feet further away until it was no longer visible amongst the thick growth on the edge of the forest.
The water slowly freezes, icicles forming as the water solidifies. Harry watches as it reaches the pipe, letting out a sigh of relief as the water stops. He dries off his glasses with a quick spell and puts them back on. But a quiet cracking noise pulls Harry’s focus back to the pipes. Little crystals are forming on the length of the pipe moving downwards as an ominous louder cracking sound comes from the pipe.
Draco’s lips were pressed in a thin line, and he looked like he was restraining himself from saying anything else.
Harry leaned in and kissed his jaw. “You know how I’ve had to work late on Thursdays for the last few months?”
Harry tosses his head back and cries out as the shock travels through the toy, dispersing along his insides. As soon as it’s over, Harry pulls his head back up, his body taut in anticipation as Draco continues his ruthless assault.
Harry snorted. “Yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare cleaning out the place. The house-elf was named Kreacher, but he died a few years ago.”
Draco sighed before continuing, “We actually haven’t spoken since. Part of it was knowing that my father would always have influence in wizarding England—knowing I wouldn’t actually be able to get away from him.
Harry huffed a laugh as he freed his hand from between their bodies, wiping it on his trouser leg that was still bunched around his thighs. His other hand came to rest on Draco’s back, making small circular motions.
“Celebration? Does that mean you wrapped up the case and don’t have to go in today?” Draco’s hands are already wandering, no question to what’s on his mind this morning.
“Not bad. The second-year classes have had a lot of the same problems as the first years, but I’ll be trying the same with them on Thursday. The fifth through seventh-year classes are really fun to teach.”
Harry pushes into Draco’s hand, feeling good and warm and loved. He’s too far down for doubts and nagging thoughts about how he should act or be. Draco whispers soothing words to him, running his fingers through Harry’s hair, gently pulling through the tangles.
Once the spell was around the bird, Harry turned to the nearest Hufflepuff student. “You—what’s your name?” He really needed to learn their names.
“So, just remember, you only need to lean into it a little bit. It’s really easy to overcompensate and send yourself off-course.” Harry looked across the line of his sixth-year students. All of the houses were combined for this class as there were only twenty students who had signed up for it. And even though there had been some trash talk here and there between rival houses, all of these students played for their house Quidditch teams and were far more focused on learning the lesson.
“I imagine you got everything you ever wanted,” Harry said. He wasn’t as irritated at the thought as he might have been years ago. He knew Draco had long grown past that spoiled boy; he’d survived a war the same as Harry, regardless of his alignment at the time.
“I think we should try this together,” Harry said. “Go ahead and mount your broom, so I can see your grip.”
Draco balanced the wax paper on his lap, looking like he was trying to eat the toast with little mess but failing miserably as bits of avocado and crumbs went everywhere.
“Yeah, okay—” Draco tossed the condom on the bedside table and leant back on the bed. “Go ahead. I keep forgetting.”
Harry stands, stumbling a bit from having been on his knees for so long. Draco steadies him with a hand on his elbow and waits patiently as Harry gets into position. Harry relishes how exposed he feels in this position, how on display. If anything, the lace knickers only heighten his awareness of his own nakedness, of Draco’s buttoned-up state.
The meal continued with laughter and stories. In the end, a few of their less shining moments came out as Teddy regaled his grandmother with his exciting week, but she simply raised an eyebrow and snorted a laugh, and they moved on. Harry found himself becoming quieter as the evening went on, letting himself just enjoy the moment. The feeling of being a part of this family was so strong, it was nearly overwhelming. He knew the Weasleys saw him as one of their own, every one of them, and he certainly felt they were family as well. But sitting around the table at the Burrow, as they reminisced about the past, sharing funny stories from their childhood, he was often reminded that there would always be this divide. He was family in the way that Hermione was, in the way someone that married into the family belonged. Which was to say fully, but never sharing the same memories. But here, in this little make-shift family that Andromeda had put together, as she had attempted to slowly survive the family she’d lost, Harry felt complete. He decided at that moment that he may be spending more Boxing Days at the Weasleys’ and more Christmases at Andromeda’s.
“He has put himself in the infirmary in every one of my classes so far.” Harry was determined to cast extra-strength cushioning charms under his zone during their next lesson.
“I was going to call you today, actually. The Manor has officially passed into my possession, and I should have access to some items that I previously hadn’t based on the protective spellwork on certain areas of the Manor.”
Harry pulled Draco close and slipped his hands between them, working the small buttons that his mirror self had just finished. “And what am I doing?”
Draco inhaled sharply as he met Harry’s lips halfway. Draco’s lips were slightly chapped, and Harry ran his tongue along them- softly, carefully. Draco sighed against him, opening his lips to deepen the kiss.
Six hours. It had been six hours since their morning Auror raid. Six uncomfortable, awkward, surreal hours.
“I don’t want to be set up, and I don’t want to use a damn wizarding dating app,” Harry finally snapped.
Carefully he pulled Draco’s head back enough for him to breathe as aftershocks swept through his body. Draco inhaled sharply through his nose and then continued to work Harry through the last of his orgasm until Harry pulled him off.
“Draco, for fuck’s sake. I’m not a blushing virgin, even if it has been a long time.” Harry rolled himself to the side and propped himself up again on an elbow, his mouth quirking into a smile. “I’ll have you know I’ve had a very healthy relationship with my hand and
“Official business?” Malfoy asked. Harry could see the moment he worked out that it was likely Ministry business. “Right. Okay. Lila, can you? I have to—”
“What a month.” Draco pulls out slowly, and Harry winces. He’s going to feel it tomorrow and is honestly thrilled at the thought. As Draco slides off him, tucking himself close, Harry stretches out, his legs protesting at the movement.
Once there, he slammed his door shut and paced back and forth in front of the fireplace. He knew it was just yoghurt; it didn’t really matter. But the idea that Malfoy was fucking with him was just the icing on the cake for the shitty first week of classes he was having. Ignoring the little voice in his head reminding him to behave like an adult, he strode into his bedroom and pulled open his wardrobe.
“I didn’t know that was even possible. And the whole time, I knew I didn’t even deserve it. I had Muggles that I had just met, and not just Muggles, Harry… but gay men, drag queens and transgender folks who had all been disowned by their own families, who had pulled themselves up and made lives for themselves. They gave me sofas to sleep on, helped me find work, made sure I was fed. I realised pretty quickly that I didn’t know shit about the world.
“Harry, dear,” Molly reached out with a hand. Harry obligingly put his hand in hers. “You can always tell us anything. You’re family.”
But even with a bit more success, Harry still found himself exhausted as he entered the staff room; he still had quite a bit of class prep left to do, as well.
Draco thrust his finger in, and Harry worked his tongue to clean it, hoping the man would remember how good he was with his tongue and stop working for the day. But Draco only smiled, eyes heated, and pulled his finger out. Standing up, Draco straightened his shirt and trousers, and then flicked his wand, sending the tea cup back to the side table.
Harry reminded himself to act normal, not interested in revisiting the awkward conversation he’d had with his partner the previous year. After a few months of working as partners, Mel had invited him to a party for her wife’s birthday. It hadn’t dawned on Harry that a large portion of her friends might also be in the queer community, so he had spent the evening being generally awkward and panicking at any subtle flirtation thrown his way.
Harry hesitated for a moment, his brain short-circuiting on just how terrible of an idea this probably was. But, in the end, he only had so much self-restraint. With a deep breath, he threw a wandless locking charm followed by a wandless silencing charm at the door.
Draco pulled down the knickers, feeling the full weight of the cage pull at his cock, and added them to the laundry bin. Then he headed into the ensuite. Harry would be home soon, and Draco wasted no time cleaning up.
Harry adjusted the satchel on his shoulder and nodded, placing a hand on her shoulder before he walked out the door, knowing that there weren’t enough words to express how much he was going to miss having her as a partner.
“Nothing, absolutely nothing,” Harry lied. It was fine. Just a pesky crush. It would be totally, completely fine.
Harry turned to see the rest of the team frozen, eyes trailing along the far wall. He turned back, unable to stop staring in horror.
Draco sat on his bed, leaning against the wall, legs stretched out in front of him, his phone in his hand. Several emotions passed over Draco’s face before he seemed to settle on irritation.
“Good, boy,” Draco said. “Clean the rest up too. Can’t have you dirtying up the place while I work.”
Harry quickly gave his colleagues the finger with a laugh and sent more spells Mel’s way with increasing power behind them. A strong Tickling Charm finally broke through causing her to burst out laughing and drop the Shield Charm.
“How about you Malfoy? How are things in the Budget and Coordination office for Magical Maintenance?” Justin asked. The question sounded polite, but Draco didn’t miss the condescension. That was a tone and inflection that Draco had perfected himself during his youth.
As he got to the lifts, he let out a long breath. He shouldn’t have snapped at her like that, but he hated what she was implying. He didn’t know if it was worse that she was hinting at his most hidden secret or that she was implying that about
As soon as the phone hit the surface, Draco used the shift in position to grab Harry and pull him on top of him. Harry went willingly, his wavy hair falling in his eyes. Draco looked up at him, eyes heated.
Draco groaned underneath him and shifted so that Harry could slide a leg between Draco’s. Any insecurity Harry had vanished when he felt Draco’s already half-hard cock pressing up into his hip. His own cock had also filled out considerably over the last few minutes.
Draco murmured in his sleep and buried deeper in the covers. His mussed up hair was splayed out on the pillow and his face relaxed. Harry leant over and placed a soft kiss on the top of his head, careful to not wake him as he crawled out of bed. He got dressed in the same clothes he’d been wearing for half a week and slipped his trainers on.
“Since Accioing them didn’t work, and you said you already tried a tracking spell, I thought we should try an alarm spell next,” Malfoy said, his long legs easily keeping up with Harry’s quick pace as they strode across the pitch.
“So, we could possibly offer her a deal if she knows something about the Malfoy case?” Harry asked, knowing exactly where Mel was going with her question.
Draco stretched forward while pushing his arse further back, his arse cheeks spreading at the motion, and a choked sound escaped Harry. Draco glanced back over his shoulder, a smug look on his face. Harry didn’t bother trying to hide his reaction this time and slid off the sofa onto his knees.
“Everyone else okay? Can you let Ginny know I’m alright? She’ll freak out if I don’t reply to her texts.”
Once the office was empty, Harry went in and took a seat across from Ron. “Assistant Head Auror Weasley.”
Harry knew he had the knowledge—several years playing Seeker for the Falmouth Falcons certainly gave him that—but actually putting together lesson plans and seeing them through for a full year was intimidating. He didn’t really feel like they should be leaving him in charge of anything, let alone so many students. He barely felt old enough to be a teacher, really.
“I’m not sure I’m familiar with this creature.” It reminded him of a basilisk, if a bit smaller, and he seriously hoped this wasn’t what they were dealing with.
“On Lucius Malfoy?” Harry asked, incredulously. “If anything, I would have thought most people would have been relieved. No way was he not blackmailing at least
Harry took a good look at his friends and saw black circles under both their eyes. “How long was I out?”
The idea of having to hear any of those sentiments from people in the wizarding community was too much. And that any of those thoughts could come from someone he cared about was terrifying. Mrs Weasley always made it very clear how much she wanted Harry to find a nice young witch, settle down, and have a family of his own.
“Okay?” Harry asked. He was too exhausted to trust that he was reading Draco’s response right, too tired to chance being wrong again after the party.
The forensics team was now onto the potions and other items in the room, so Harry hung back in the study, watching as they took their time to ensure there was neither an accident nor an accidental curse from one of the clearly magical items around the room.
“Can I open them now?” Teddy asked, pulling Harry out of his thoughts. Teddy was standing over his pile, hands on his hips, practically vibrating with excitement.
“Okay, understood. While we won’t rule out that someone broke in, then, we’ll need a list of anyone that had access through the wards.”
He plopped down on the sofa as he flicked his wand to the wireless to turn on the match. With doing the bulk of the household chores, Harry hadn’t had a day to just relax in far too long, and he was determined to enjoy it… even with the niggling knowledge that Draco wasn't actually going to make it this easy for him. Harry had never known the man to go down without a fight when he dug in his heels about something, not that Harry was particularly better about that front. But somehow, they made it work. At least, most of the time.
Unfortunately, Isabelle George hadn’t had any more information for them, other than who she’d seen Damien Fegan talking to in her organisation, but they at least had a possible connection. Another dead body, but it was an avenue to run down, nonetheless.
Justin gave him a subtle smirk and turned back to Harry. “Were you planning on going out to Luna’s new magical creature reserve soon? I’ve heard she’s looking for volunteers on the weekends.”
Harry feels his cock stir to life at the words. Draco loves to plan, sometimes well in advance, and if he’s been waiting for the right day then Harry knows this is bound to be good.
A fresh late-summer breeze caught Harry in the face, and he breathed in deeply. The last few years spent living in London gave him a new appreciation for the grounds at Hogwarts and their remote location. He allowed himself to slow his pace and enjoy the beautiful weather as he made his way down the path to the Quidditch Pitch, an armful of brooms balanced in his arms. Levitating charms were tricky with brooms, as they would often take the spell as a sign to fly off.
“Done for the day?” Malfoy asked with a judgemental drawl and then breaking out into a smirk. “Missing your yoghurt again?”
Harry feels Draco’s clothes brushing up against the inside of his thighs and looks up to see Draco unfastening his trousers, pulling his hard cock out.
“Oh, I’m sure I can figure something out. Now that I know that, with the right stakes, it’s on the table. I’m willing to come up with something good if it means seeing you in ruffles and heels, my love.”
He skimmed through the file, looking for anything of interest. Foxley had apparently dated this witch for nearly a year; they’d broken up just that summer. Her name looked familiar, but Harry couldn’t place it… Isabelle George.
“Old man, my arse,” Harry said as Mel flopped down on one of the mats once the spell wore off, holding her sides.
“Jesus,” Harry said under his breath, as he imagined being forced into that life. Married to someone he didn’t even like, not able to be himself at all, playing a part. His stomach turned sour the more he thought about it. Was it really that different than how Harry lived now? His situation was self-imposed to be sure, but there was nothing genuine about the way Harry was living his life.
Draco pulled him down for another kiss. “Apparently my patience and morality only stretch so far—unless you aren’t feeling well?” His expression turned serious as he held him at arms-length, his eyes searching Harry’s face.
Teddy finished making his pile of presents and then started pulling out other gifts. “Draco! Here’s one for you!”
His mind wandered as he towelled off, his work woes quickly forgotten as he wondered what Harry would have in store. Harry had told him that if he was good, maybe he’d get to come this weekend. That wasn’t a promise, but Draco knew his husband well. And after a week in chastity, his first week, Draco knew he had some fun in store for him. This was the longest he’d ever gone, and every nerve ending felt on high alert after a week of fucking, of teasing, and absolutely no contact to his cock.
Draco walked slowly into the sitting room, ignoring Harry altogether, before heading to the mantle of the fireplace. He pulled out his wand, poofy feathers sticking out of the tip. Bending over ever so slightly, Draco then began dusting the surface. His skirt bounced up at the motion giving Harry a glimpse of the curve of his arse, the bare skin above the top of the net stockings peeking out. Harry found himself unable to look anywhere else—wondering what was hidden underneath the ruffles.
Harry nodded, unsure if that was even his primary concern anymore. Maybe it would be easier if he were more obvious, really. There was something almost freeing about Draco’s reaction, him already having known. Almost validating, in its own way. That he was seen by someone. And accepted.
Harry laughs and props himself up on their pedestal sink; it wobbles a bit but it’ll have to do. “Shut up and get over here.”
Once Draco’s thigh and calf relaxed, Harry moved to the other leg, slowly undoing the ropework. The sensations were as arousing this time around, but Draco was too relaxed, too floaty to react much. He sighed as his leg was released, shivered when the rope grazed a sensitive part of his body, but his body stayed pliant, calm.
“Yeah—I was really angry at the world back then, so I kind of pushed people away. Being a Black trans girl in this world with bigoted parents does that, you know?” She raised an eyebrow, but her expression was commiserating.
The next door down was the bathroom. He closed the door behind him and took a minute to steady himself, holding onto the sink. He was really drunk. His reflection in the mirror stared back at him, looking softer and more relaxed than he’d seen it in some time. The usual lines of stress on his face had faded away, leaving only a few soft creases by his eyes, the only real indicator of his aging so far. He didn’t look half bad, really, he thought. The clothes and his attempt at styling his hair helped, even if he’d never hope to be as stylish as Draco and his friends.
Once he had about half of them working on turns, he pulled back to the stands again to keep an eye on the class. He hadn’t quite believed this would work with so many students, but it did. Harry found himself looking forward to seeing Malfoy later on. Not so much to continue their investigation but to tell Malfoy that the lesson had actually worked. The attempt at finding the yoghurt and chocolate thief seemed less important by the day. Now that he was sure Malfoy wasn’t the culprit, Harry found his interest in catching the thief waning. But even as the need to find the thief faded—really, he could just have another snack—he found himself not wanting to end the chase. It had hit him like a Bludger the previous week when he realized he was actually enjoying Malfoy’s company.
“Of course.” Draco rubbed his thumb on the back of Harry’s hand where they were still linked, before dropping it. He went to the dresser and pulled out a drawer, rifling through some of the clothes. “Here—I think these should fit you.”
Harry read the address written on the slip and committed it to memory before subtly tapping on it with his finger and wandlessly banishing it.
He’d still been heartbroken. He loved her even if it hadn’t been physical, but he knew she deserved something better, so he let her go.
Then, he slipped his hand under Harry’s leg, lifting it over his shoulder and kissing back down his leg, slowing down where the thigh met his arse.
The other man looked up sharply. “I don’t go by that name anymore,” Malfoy hissed, sharply looking around the bar.
“Okay, Jacob. I’m going to immobilise your leg so that we don’t do any more damage to it on the way to the infirmary.” Harry looked at the student for confirmation. Once Jacob nodded, Harry cast the spell. Fortunately, he’d picked up a few essential spells from his years playing professionally. He wouldn’t trust himself to do the mending, but he could at least get students to and from the infirmary safely. Hiding a grimace, he hoped this wasn’t a skill he was going to be using with any sort of regularity.
Post-orgasm torture is bad enough on its own, but coupled with the potion, Harry’s squirming and begging within seconds.
Harry gasped in surprise as the water soaked through his jumper and then grabbed his own glass of water. Ingredients started flying, the flour mixing with the water on both of them and creating a particularly sticky situation in Harry’s hair. Draco scanned the room and started toward the other end of the counter. Harry saw the giblets that Harry had pulled out of the turkey earlier, much to Draco’s horror. Before he could reach them, Harry grabbed him around the waist and pulled him to the other side of the kitchen, both of them gasping for air between laughs.
He fought back a rising flush. “I’m going to a party with Draco tomorrow. Not as a date—get that look off your face—just as friends. His friend is having a birthday party, and he’s invited me.”
Harry hummed noncommittally. While he still loved the game, he always felt the twinge of regret around his former team.
Draco still hadn’t texted by the time Harry left the Burrow, stuffed but featherlight with relief. He walked a few steps from the house, unsure about where he wanted to go for the rest of the day. The mid-December chill cut through him, so he set down his leather satchel and rifled through it for this coat. Fortunately, he had kept some spare Muggle clothes in his office for when he needed to go into Muggle areas on a case with little warning. Auror robes, with all their in-laid spell work, didn’t transfigure well. He shrugged on the coat and considered his options.
“There’s a witch I work with who is really nice, Harry. I could set you up with her if you want,” Percy’s wife, Aubrey, piped up.
“Absolutely.” Harry felt a wave of excitement at the idea of getting his hands on anything Lucius Malfoy would have deemed important enough to lock in a hidden room. But he knew Draco’s feelings about his father were complicated enough that Harry would need to tread lightly.
Molly turned, smiling. “So you got the promotion! We were wondering after Ron firecalled last night to tell us about his own promotion.”
The first flight seemed to have taken the worst damage—parts of the bannister were splintered off, the walls cracked. He glanced down the hall on the first floor. It looked like there was some damage but not as much as the ground floor. When he’d renovated the house, he’d turned the ground floor into his sitting room, leaving the original sitting room as a perfect space for his study. His study was easily his favourite room in the house, mostly because it had his favourite sofa and the television. He found the thought of surveying the damage to that room too overwhelming, so, instead, he continued up to his bedroom.
They pull off their shirts—Harry’s glasses flying somewhere in the process with a clatter—and then struggle to get out of their trousers, their feet getting tangled up in their haste. But eventually, they manage to get fully naked and stretch out on the sofa, and Draco kisses his way down Harry’s torso.
That part of his life was supposed to be over and done with. It wasn’t supposed to follow him home. He was supposed to be a professional Auror: catch the criminals and go home… Harry remembered the dream, back when he was angry and hurting and always in danger—the dream of going to a job he was good at and then coming
Before he can complain too much, Harry climbs on top of his naked body, straddling his hips. “Like you weren’t going to cast ironing charms on them before putting them back on anyways.”
“I planned on it, pet.” Draco smirked. He loosed his grip even more and ran a finger down Harry’s cock, around the base, back up along the length. The teasing touch was threatening to put Harry over the edge, and he was panting now.
